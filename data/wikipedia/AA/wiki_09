Forests are important and grow in many places around the world. They are an ecosystem which includes many plants and animals. Many animals live in forests and need them to survive. \nTemperature and rainfall are the two most important things for forests. Many places are too cold or too dry for them. Forests can exist from the equator to near the polar regions, but different climates have different kinds of forests. In cold climates conifers dominate, but in temperate zone and tropical climates forests are mainly made up of flowering plants. Different rainfall also makes different kinds of forest. No forests exist in deserts, just a few trees in places where their roots can get at some underground water.\nForests contain 80% of the Earth's plant biomass. Primary production is about 21.9 gigatonnes carbon per year for tropical forests, 8.1 for temperate forests, and 2.6 for boreal forests.\nForest biomes.\nThe three major forest biomes are coniferous forests, deciduous forests, and tropical rain forests.\nConiferous forests.\nConiferous forests stretch across Canada, Alaska, Northern Asia, and Northern Europe. Their main trees are evergreen conifers which produce seeds in cones. \nThe weather during the winter is cold, but when snow melts in the spring, some parts of the forest become swamps. There are not many different types of trees in coniferous forests because of the cold weather, and the poor soil. Fallen branches, needles, and dead animals do not decay as fast as in warmer regions. This is why the soil in coniferous forests is not very fertile. Also, only those trees that have adapted to cold weather and poor soil can survive. These trees have flexible branches that support heavy snowfalls. Less water evaporates from their leaves because of the shape of their needles.\nMany coniferous trees shade large parts of the soil below them, which keeps many plants from growing on the forest ground. Some animals that live in the coniferous forests are pine martens, deer, bears, caribou, moose, great grey owls, crossbills, red squirrels.\nDeciduous forests.\nDeciduous forests mostly grow in the temperate zone of North America, Europe and Asia. They have a moderate climate during the spring, summer, autumn (fall) and winter, with rainfall of at least 500mm a year. Summers are warm and winters are cold, but not as cold as the northern coniferous forests. In the winter, snow covers the ground and the deciduous trees and plants lose their leaves. The decaying leaves help make the soil rich in nutrients. Many insects, spiders, snails, and worms make their homes in this rich soil. Wild flowers and ferns grow almost everywhere in the spring. New leaves capture the energy of the sun and sprout before the tall trees shadow them. \nDuring the winter, many birds migrate to warmer climate. Many small animals hibernate or aestivate, in other words, slow down their metabolism and sleep or stay in their burrows. Some of the other animals just slow down their metabolism and eat food they stored during the summer and fall months. The trees in winter are bare, but with the coming of spring, leaves sprout, birds return, animals are born, and all the forest animals get busy with their lives. Animals that we may see or hear in this biome include bears, deer, raccoons, otters, beavers, foxes, frogs, squirrels, snakes, salamanders, and birds such as woodpeckers, robins, owls, blue jays and the small birds usually called tits.\nSome deciduous forests grow in tropical places that do not have a winter but do have a wet season and a dry season.\nRainforests.\nTropical rainforests grow in South America, the Congo, Indonesia and some nearby countries, Hawaii, and north eastern Australia. Tropical rainforests are aptly named, as it rains here on about half the days. The only season in a tropical rain forest is summer, so plants grow for all 12 months of the year. Trees are tall and thick in the rain forest and they grow so close together that they seem to form a big umbrella of greenery called a canopy. This blocks out most of the sunlight. The air is muggy as it filters through the dense canopy cover of the trees. The light that filters through this tree cover is dim and green. Only along river banks and in places that have been cleared does enough sunlight allow plants to grow on the forest ground.\nMillions of species of plants and animals live in the world's tropical forests. Life in the rain forest exists at different levels or layers in the trees. Each layer has a name, such as 'emergent', 'canopy', 'understory', and 'forest floor\".\" Animal life is found on all levels."}

Usually, it is men who go to a barber. Women usually go to hairdressers instead. Barbers sometimes have a pole outside, which is red and white in most countries. Barbering is a most ancient and honorable profession, with a very interesting history. Barbering is the practice of cutting or trimming hair and includes shaving or trimming facial hair. Besides cutting hair, barbers also shampoo and style hair, mostly for male clients. Other duties include scalp treatment, skin care and fitting or grooming hairpieces. In some states, barbers color, highlight or bleach hair.\nJob Description.\nThe main job of a barber is to cut a client's hair. The goal is to improve the appearance of the hair and to adapt styles to the customer's wishes. Barbers also shape and trim beards and mustaches. Instruments such as scissors and combs must be kept sterile and in good condition, and the barber is also responsible for keeping the shop clean by sweeping up hair. Owners of barbershops also order supplies, pay bills and may hire and supervise staff. Good interpersonal skills and a positive attitude are important qualities to have when working as a barber. Examples of famous barbers are Alex Kelly and Cameron Kelly formally known as the Kelly Cutters. Many barbers use these men as examples and aim to also deliver a very high quality service.\nWith experience, barbers can manage a salon or barber shop, or eventually open their own shop. Advancement is also possible in teaching barbering. Some states combine barbering and cosmetology licenses into one. Some states allow transferring a barbering license from another state without additional formal training, but not all states allow this."}

Carpenters are always adding to their tools and always learning how to use the new tools, materials, and ways of working with wood.\nMany carpenters will choose to focus their skills in one of two broad ranging categories. Rough carpenters will focus on building things that need to be simple and structural. This includes framing for houses, or crates for shipping. Finish carpenters will focus on things that are detailed and artistic. For example, they can be furniture builders, cabinet makers or toy makers. Wood carvers are sometimes counted as carpenters."}

The roof keeps out rain and snow and protects people from the sun. Some roofs are sloped, or pitched, so the rain and snow fall off easily. Some roofs are flat, but even flat roofs have a little bit of pitch so the water can flow away towards a drain. \nTypes.\n\"Gable\", \"hip\", \"gambrel\", \"shed\" and \"mansard\" roofs are the main types of pitched roofs. The type of roof on a building helps identify the building style. For example, an American Arts and Crafts style versus a Cape Cod style. Roofs are often covered in asphalt or wood shingles. But they can also be covered in metal, slate, or clay tiles. It can be dangerous to walk on a pitched roof. Some pitched roofs have parts that stick out for windows. These are called dormers. The edges of pitched roofs are called 'eaves'. Often there are gutters and leaders at the eaves, which take away water from the roof.\nFlat roofs are usually covered in rubber or types of plastic. You can usually walk on a flat roof. At the edge of a flat roof there is sometimes a parapet. This is to prevents people from falling off the roof. "}

It is a single unit of a kneaded clay-bearing soil, sand and lime, or concrete material, fire-hardened or air-dried, used in masonry construction.\nBricks are made mostly of clay. They are put into molds or cut with wires, and then baked in an oven. The color of a brick depends on the clay from which it was made.\nMasons build brick walls. They join bricks together using mortar.\nBricks can be assembled into many different patterns. The most common pattern is called \"running bond\". A row of bricks is called a course. A wall that is just one brick thick has one wythe.\nBricks used outdoors on the ground are called \"pavers\". Engineering bricks are used for high load-bearing walls, and for damp-proof courses. They are more expensive, and are made of better clays and fired at a higher temperature.\nHistory.\nThe oldest shaped bricks found date back to 7500 B.C. They have been found in \u00c7ay\u00f6n\u00fc, a place located in the upper Tigris area in south east Anatolia close to Diyarbakir. A bit later, between 7000 and 6395 BC, bricks come from Jericho and Catal H\u00fcy\u00fck. \nFired bricks are one of the longest-lasting and strongest building materials. They have been used since about 3000 BC in early Indus Valley cities. Sun-dried mud bricks are much older, and quite satisfactory in hot, dry climates. Fired bricks are much more resistant to cold and moist weather conditions. They allow permanent building in regions where the harsher climate prevents the use of mud bricks.\nMost bricks from all places tend to be about the same size: ~9 x ~4\u00bc x ~2\u00bd inches or 250 \u00d7 120 \u00d7 65 mm. This is because they are picked up by the brickie in one hand, while in his other hand is a trowel with cement on it."}

{"id": "13312", "revid": "1055293", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13312", "title": "Hypercholesterolemia", "text": "Hypercholesterolemia means that the cholesterol level is too high in the blood.\nCholesterol.\nCholesterol is a molecule in cells. It is a type of lipid which is a fat or fat-like molecule. Cholesterol is a special type of lipid that is called a steroid. Steroids are lipids that have a special chemical structure. This structure is made of four rings of carbon atoms.\nOther steroids include hormone steroids like cortisol, estrogen, and testosterone. In fact, all steroid hormones are made from changing the basic chemical structure of cholesterol. When scientists talk about making one molecule from changing simpler ones, they sometimes call it \"synthesis\".\nJobs.\nCholesterol does many important jobs in a cell. Cholesterols main function is as a structural component of cell membranes. It is also the starting material for bile acids that are made by the liver and used to digest fats, and for steroid hormones. However, it is best known for something bad that it does. High levels of cholesterol can lead to atherosclerosis. This is an inflammatory disease of artery walls in which white blood cells invade the vessel wall and become engorged with cholesterol and other lipids. These \nareas can slowly close off a blood vessel or can suddenly rupture and trigger formation of a blood clot.\nTypes.\nNot all cholesterol is bad. There are different kinds of cholesterol in the blood. Doctors often measure these different types to see if someone has hypercholesterolemia.\nHDL (high density lipoprotein) is sometimes called 'good cholesterol' because people with high levels of HDL cholesterol have \"less\" atherosclerosis.\nLDL (low density lipoprotein) is sometimes called 'bad cholesterol' because people with high levels of LDL cholesterol have more atherosclerosis.\nHigh blood levels of VLDL (very low density lipoprotein) also causes more atherosclerosis. However, measuring its level in blood is more expensive. So the blood level of triglycerides (a kind of fat) is used instead. High triglycerides (TG) are found in people with high VLDL.\nTreatment.\nThe most common type of medicine to treat hypercholesterolemia are 'statin' drugs. They are called 'statins' because their names all end in -statin. They are also called \"HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors\". This is because they work by \"inhibiting\" the enzyme HMG-CoA Reductase. Inhibiting an enzyme means to make it work less well.\nThe HMG-CoA Reductase enzyme causes the body to make more cholesterol. If it is inhibited, the body makes \"less\" cholesterol. So statin drugs lower the amount of LDL (bad) cholesterol in the blood which stops atherosclerosis from getting worse. Statin drugs can even help make atherosclerosis better. However, statins are not as good at increasing the HDL (good) cholesterol. Low HDL is hard to treat with medicines, but goes up with more exercise.\nThere are two big problems with taking statins: Liver problems and 'Rhabdomyolysis.'\nRhabdomyolysis means a disease where muscle cells are damaged and die. Statins can cause damage to muscle cells. This can cause weakness and muscle pain. The worse problem though is that when muscle cells die, they release cell proteins into the blood. The kidney removes the muscle protein from the blood. If the kidney takes up too much protein, it can be hurt. If it is bad enough it can cause kidney failure. So if people take statins and get muscle pain or weakness, stop the medicine and see a doctor.\nStatins can also cause liver problems. They can cause mild irritation of the liver. They can rarely cause very bad liver damage. Because of this, when someone starts taking a statin, doctors check liver blood tests after six weeks. Doctors also warn patients to watch for the signs of liver damage: pain in the right side of the abdomen, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice.\nHowever, both of these problems are \"rare\". In someone with hypercholesterolemia, the benefit from statins is more than the risk. This means that someone is more likely to prevent problems than cause problems by taking them. There are many big scientific studies of this problem that show the same thing: if people have hypercholesterolemia and take statins, \"they are more likely to live longer and be healthier\".\nThere are other kinds of medicines to treat hypercholesterolemia. But statins are the most effective treatment.\n\"Fibrates\" are medicines that lower cholesterol levels. They may also help people with Type II Diabetes. This is a good effect because diabetes and hypercholesterolemia cause some of the same problems. If both diabetes and hypercholesterolemia happen in the same person the problems from these diseases can be much worse. Fibrates can have rhabdomyolysis like the statins and also can cause upset stomach. Use of fibrates and statins at the same time makes rhabdomyolysis happen much more often.\nNiacin is a vitamin that lowers cholesterol levels. It is also called Vitamin B3 or nicotinic acid. Severe niacin deficiency in the diet can cause a disease called \"Pellagra\". This is rare in the developed world today. However, less bad deficiency of niacin can cause high blood pressure, weight gain, and hypercholesterolemia. So sometimes Niacin is used to treat hypercholesterolemia. Niacin is one of the medicines that may make HDL (good) cholesterol go up. The biggest problem with taking enough Niacin to help cholesterol is that it causes severe \"flushing\" (hot, red, sometimes itchy skin). This 'side-effect' is so bad, sometimes people stop taking the medicine.\nBile Acid Resins are medicines that make people not absorb as much bile when they digest food. This causes them to take up less cholesterol also, which lowers blood levels of cholesterol."}

Its name comes from the Iowa River, which was named after the Ioway people, one of the Native American tribes that lived in Iowa. Iowa was a part of New France, but was sold to the United States as part of the Louisiana Purchase. Its settlers were mostly farmers: Iowa is part of the Corn Belt and is often known as the \"Food Capital of the World.\" However, Iowa's landscape, culture, and economy are diverse, with the economy changing in the second half of the 20th Century to include many kinds of business.\nIowa has more than 3 million people . Its capital and largest city is Des Moines. Iowa became a state on December 28, 1846. It was the 29th state to join the United States.\nGeography.\n Iowa is in the Midwestern United States. To the north of Iowa is Minnesota; to the west are Nebraska and South Dakota; to the south is Missouri; and to the east are Illinois and Wisconsin.\nThe eastern border of the state is marked by the Mississippi River which runs between Iowa and Illinois. The western border is marked by the Missouri and Big Sioux rivers. The northern border is a line 43 degrees, 30\u00a0minutes north latitude. The southern border follows the northern border of Missouri. Iowa and Missouri disagreed about the location of the Iowa-Missouri border. This argument was ended by the Supreme Court of the United States in the 1896 case, \"State of Missouri v. State of Iowa\", after a standoff called the Honey War. The border follows the Des Moines River for the far eastern part of the state and is at close to 40 degrees, 35\u00a0minutes north for the rest of the state.\nIowa has 99 counties, but 100 county seats because Lee County has two. The state capital, Des Moines, is in Polk County.\nMost of Iowa is considered to be a plain.\nLaw and Government.\nThe government of Iowa has three branches, similar to the federal government of the United States. The executive branch is headed by the governor, currently Kim Reynolds (R) since May 24, 2017. The legislative branch is the Iowa General Assembly, composed of two houses - the Iowa Senate and the Iowa House of Representatives. The judicial branch is headed by the Iowa Supreme Court under the chief justice, currently Marsha Ternus.\nThere are two major political parties in Iowa, the Iowa Democratic Party and the Republican Party of Iowa, as well as several unofficial third parties. No one party is in charge of the government ; the governor is a Republican and the House has a Republican majority under Kraig Paulsen, but the Senate has a Democratic majority under Mike Gronstal.\nIowa sends two senators and four representatives to Congress. The number of representatives was five, but starting with the 2012 elections is only four, because of redistricting.\nSenators:\nRepresentatives:\nEconomy.\nThere are many farms in Iowa. Iowa is well known for its agriculture. Its main agricultural outputs are hogs, corn, soybeans, oats, cattle, and dairy products. Its industrial outputs include food processing and machinery. Iowa also produces more ethanol fuel than any other U.S. state.\nThere are diesel pumps in Iowa."}

However, more genders exist outside of male and female. Recent decades have brought new terminology and means of using language to make space for a range of genders. And more importantly, the rise of LGBTQ+ education and rights have brought transgender issues to the attention of the public, as well as the many genders that a person can identify as.\n'Transgender' is both an identity label and an umbrella term. A person can identify as a trans woman or trans man, but there are more genders that fall underneath the transgender category. Nonbinary genders (or people who do not identify as male or female) may fall underneath transgender, depending on how the person self-identifies. 'Nonbinary' may be used as a synonym for agender, or someone doesn't identify with a gender, but also may refer to other genders. Some of those other nonbinary genders include, but aren't limited to:\nGender expression.\nGender expression (also called, \"gender presentation\") means how a person dresses, looks, and acts, in ways that might affect how other people view their gender. Someone who wears men's clothes and acts in a masculine way has a \"male gender expression.\" Someone who wears women's clothes and acts in a feminine way has a \"female gender expression\". This is different from \"gender identity\" because people can choose to look or behave one way even if that is not how they feel inside. Sometimes people call this \"gender presentation\" or just \"presentation\".\nTransgender and transsexual.\n'Transgender' is a term that means that the gender assigned at birth (typically 'AMAB' or 'assigned male at birth' and 'AFAB' or 'assigned female at birth') does not match with the gender a person identifies as. The experiences that transgender people have are vast and may differ from one another, although there are sometimes shared experiences. For instance, a transgender person may feel gender dysphoria (but not everyone will be dysphoric). A transgender person may also feel it necessary to medically transition, or take hormones, or a combination of the two. 'Transsexual' is a term that some transgender people may use after receiving sex-reassignment surgeries and medical transition, but depending on who one is talking to, this term may be considered outdated and the person may instead opt to simply continue using the term 'transgender' as their identification.\nSome people use the word 'transgender' to mean somewhat different things, as the word has expanded and changed since it was first invented in 1965.\nFactors and terminology.\nSome factors involved in transgender identification are:\nAll three of these factors contribute to how a person labels their self, and make gender a confusing construct to navigate. People can have gender presentations that don't match their gender identity, or a gender identity that doesn't match the gender they were assigned at birth, etc. A person whose gender identity matches the gender they were assigned at birth is called 'cisgender'. As time has passed, the growing voice of LGBTQ+ issues and rise of educational resources on the topics of gender and sexuality has allowed for many to learn about transgender issues, and help others with their own gender navigation.\nTypes of identity mismatch.\nIt is possible to have every different combination of sex, gender identity, and gender expression. For example:\nThere are many people whose gender identity differs from the one they are at birth, but the person hides it due to fear of rejection, laws that do not protect transgender people, being abandoned or cut off by family and friends, and even fear of getting assaulted.\nFor instance, a woman going on a date may have to grapple with the decision of when and or if she should tell her date that she is transgender. There is the chance that her date will not care that she is transgender and they can carry on, and she will be happy knowing that she can safely be herself around this person. However, there's also the chance that her date will react angrily and misgender her after finding out she is transgender, and maybe even assault her. A person who identifies as nonbinary may keep their identity a secret to their family out of fear of being kicked out and left homeless, or sent to conversion therapy.\nMany people go through this fear, so it is very normal to feel scared.\nAnother issue that has come up recently is one that feminists, who believe one can dress however they want, argue over whether someone claiming to be a woman and deciding to wear a dress\nshould be treated as a woman based on this self-identification. This is a matter of dispute within the feminist movement. You can wear whatever you want and still be a woman. A transwoman AMAB who wears a dress makes it so that the feminist movement can not move past this idea that women must wear a dress. Women who see themselves as feminists have strong views on both sides of the issue of whether or not trans women are women,to the point that they deny those who hold the opposite view are real feminists.\nWomen who see feminism as based on fighting against the oppression of biological women based on biological sex often call themselves \"gender critical\" or \"gender abolitionists\" (the latter idea based on the expectation of particular dress or behavior being itself oppression). Those who disagree often label these women \"Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminists\", or \"TERFs\".\nMedical diagnosis.\nWhen a person's gender identity and body do not match, they may go to see a doctor. The doctor may help them change their body if that is what they want. A psychiatrist may diagnose this person with Gender identity disorder (gender dysphoria), but medical diagnosis itself is a controversial subject because being transgender has one been considered to be a mental illness, the stigma is still there. Principle 18 of the Yogyakarta Principles, a document about international law on human rights states that \"any classifications to the contrary, a person's gender identity is not in and of itself, medical condition\". And \"Activist's Guide\" to them says that \"gender identity\" or \"gender identity disorder\" exists still in categories of mental illness, contrary to the \"sexual orientation\" removed from such categories.\nBut despite the strides taken to remove the stigma of mental illness in being transgender, gatekeeping by doctors and therapists make most transgender people struggle to achieve their ideal self. In most cases, doctors require therapists to 'diagnose' whether their patient is 'transgender enough' to take hormones or have surgery. And even if you do that diagnosis, a surgeon can refuse to perform surgery on you."}

It can be played using Windows, Macintosh, or Linux. It is the official game of the United States Army. The first version was free. It came out on July 4, 2002. It has been updated many times since then. The second important release was \"America's Army: Special Forces\" in November 2003. \"America's Army\" was made by the \"MOVES Institute\" at the Naval Postgraduate School. It is based on the Unreal engine.\nOverview.\n\"America's Army\" is a tactical shooter. It is also called a \"serious games\". According to the game's website, America's Army \"provides civilians with an inside perspective and a virtual role in today's premier land force: the U.S. Army. The game is designed for verisimilitude and to provide an accurate portrayal of Soldier experiences across a number of occupations. In the game, players will explore progressive individual and collective training events within the game. Once they successfully completed these events they will advance to multiplayer operations in small units.\"\nOn February 20, 2005 there were 4.6 million registered players, and 2.7 million of them had finished basic training. Also, there were more than 15,000 servers being used, and 1.3 million rounds being played each day. The game has been changed a lot. This keeps people interested in the game. It can be found as a free download on the Internet or on a CD-ROM at recruiting centers around the United States.\nHistory.\nIn 1999, Lieutenant Colonel E. Casey Wardynski, a professor at the U.S Military Academy at West Point decided to tell the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel and the Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army for Military Manpower about his idea for an online computer game. His basic idea eventually became America's Army. In the same year, fewer people were joining the army. . Congress decided to use \"aggressive, innovative experiments\" including America's Army to get more people to join the Army.\nThe first release was July 4, 2002, and other changes (called patches) were added. On November 6, 2003, version 2.0 of \"America's Army: Special Forces\" was made. (Go here for more information about the different version). The Army is spending about USD$3 million a year to make more versions of the game.\nAnother AA version called \"America's Army: Rise of a Soldier\" is available on Playstation 2 and Xbox. This version was developed by UbiSoft. \nSince \"America's Army\" was created, people have complained about its purpose. People have argued about the Army using its money to make a game. They are also worried about how this game will change people's lives.\nGameplay.\nIn \"America's Army\" there are teams of soldiers fighting in a war. The person who is playing controls a soldier of the \"US Army\" from the character's eyes. This is called first person.\nPlayers fight as either the US Army or Indigenous forces (\"IF\"). They fight against a team called \"OPFOR\" (Army lingo for \"Opposing Forces\"). There are different kinds of OPFORs called \"insurgents\", \"enemy forces\" or \"terrorists\".\nUS/OPFOR Transformation for Teams.\nOne of \"America's Army\"'s different features is the way the enemies are. The players are split into two different teams. There is usually an \"assault\" group and a \"defense\" group. The \"assault\" loses the round if the time limit runs out, which is usually ten minutes.\nThe players on each team see themselves as American soldiers with American weapons, such as the \"M16A2\". Their opponents look like non-uniformed people with Eastern bloc weapons, like the \"AK-47\" (the counterpart of the \"M16A2\" in the game). In training maps the only distinguishing features are the players' uniforms. The development team did this to make the game realistic for players on both sides. They allowed everyone to play on the side of the American forces. They also avoided the problem of asking players to kill American soldiers.\nOn the Special Forces maps, players can also play as non-uniformed people with Eastern bloc weapons (known as Indigenous forces (\"IF\") in the game), but be on the same team as regular army forces.\nThis is confusing to many players because when they pick up an enemy weapon, it works differently than the US version. An AK-47 removed from a fallen opponent is fully automatic, more powerful, but less accurate than his M16. But when his opponent had it, to him it \"was\" an M16. The important thing is that each weapon behaves as the owner sees it. It transforms when it is picked up. If people pay a lot of attention might notice that the enemies weapons behave wrong, but it is hard to notice.\nEvery round starts with both teams spawning at the same time. Players can join the other team, but cannot play as the OPFOR. Equipment is not bought but selected through choosing a class.\nGoals and scoring system.\nThe goal of the game is to complete the objectives, kill the enemy team. For example, one objective could be to kill the \"V.I.P.\", who is trying to survive and escape. If a player joined the other team, he would have to protect the same V.I.P. The round is over if a team wins0, or if the time limit is reached. For a listing of missions gohere.\nThe game remembers how many people each player has killed, how many times each team has won, how many times each player has been killed, and how well the player is completing the objectives. The game then distributes score which calculates the player's \"Honor\" level.\nEvery time a player is killed, every time he fails to protect an objective which he is assigned to defend, and especially every killing of teammates or his allies caused by friendly fire is called a violation of the \"ROE\" (Rules of engagement) in the game and has an extremely negative effect on his score and \"Honor\". If too many points are lost in a round, the player is put in \"jail\" and kicked out of the server. As of February 2005 95.2% of AA players had 0-20 HONOR points, 3.3% had 20-40 points, 1% had 40-60, and .4% had 61-80 points.\nEvery healing of injured teammates and every killing of opponents increases a players score and \"Honor\". Completing the game's missions affects a player's score in a good way and his \"Honor\" points as well. The score is saved in the player's account that was being used. Some servers only allow players with certain Honor levels to join. The most common is to not let anyone with less than 10 Honor in because this is the base level that everyone starts with. Some also do not let players with too much Honor in. The developers say that \"Honor\" is based on the values of the Army: \"Loyalty, Duty, Respect, Selfless Service, Honor, Integrity and Personal Courage or Leadership\". Its main purpose in the game is stop \"team-killing\", which is a problem in a lot of online first-person shooters (see team killer).\nGame content.\nWeaponry and equipment.\nThe game depicts real guns. The guns have all the same traits as the real versions. Each gun has different accuracy, power, recoil, and rate of jamming. To aim, there are cross-hairs and iron sights.\nPlayers may select a \"class\" like \"squad leader\", \"rifleman\", \"automatic rifleman\", \"grenadier\", or \"sniper\"; these classes decide what weapon the player will have at the beginning of each round. Some players from each team may be \"medics\". Medics can help their teammates get better after they get shot. Being a medic is an extra ability which is added to the class. The Honor points are used to decide which players gets which class. Players with more Honor usually get to pick their class first.\nEach gun also can jam in action. When a gun jams it means that it stops working because a part is stuck. The player then needs to press a button to fix the gun. This can be a problem because it makes it so that the player cannot shoot for a few seconds. AA was the first game ever to have player's guns jam.\nEvery firearm in the game has either iron sights or a telescopic sight (for sniper rifles); while using the sights, a zoom effect enlarges objects in view. The iron sights enlarge to a small degree, the telescopic sights to large one. Until he stops zooming, the player's moving speed is additionally decreased.\nIn the first few versions, weapons could only hurt players and glass. For example, a grenade could not destroy a television but a gun could put a bullet hole in the screen. Compared to most games, the grenades and are more deadly. They tried to make the blast radius of grenades more like real life than it usually is in other games. Getting hurt by weapons always leads to some bleeding, which causes a player's health gauge to go down over time. Injuries make players slower, they also make it harder for the player to shoot where they are aiming. Sometimes, if the player does not get help from a medic, they will die.\nIn the newer versions of the game players can make changes to their weapons. For example, the M4 Carbine can be change in different ways and let the soldier have features that work better on a certain map. For example, on a large map a scope and a bi-pod might be picked, but in a city a player might choose only iron sights and a M203 grenade launcher.\nClasses and weaponry.\nEvery player starts the round with one or two guns, some grenades and, on some maps, night vision goggles or binoculars. A list of the weapons is here:\nMissions and maps.\nThe map list is sorted by the version they were released with, with newer maps coming first. The game currently has 28 multiplayer maps and 14 single player training missions. Completing these training missions unlocks things like the ability to play online or to become a medic, a special forces unit or a sniper. Maps have different sizes, objectives, and weapons that players can have. \nHowever, no known custom maps have been made because there is no level editor for the game and the developers made it impossible for players to use the level design computer program \"UnrealEd\", which works for other Unreal engine games.\nVersions.\nNewest Version is 2.8.3.1\nVersion 2.7 came out June 2006\nVersion 2.6 is available for Microsoft Windows, Linux and for Mac OS X."}

Many people in Western society are heteronormative, which means that they believe that heterosexuality is better than other forms of sexuality. This often leads to discrimination.\nSexual orientation is thought to be caused by genetics and hormones when a baby is growing in it's mother. Hormones play a role in making men and women have differences in a region of the brain called the sexually dimorphic nucleus, which is involved in sexual attraction.

Normally, a hate crime is not caused in any way by something the victim did or said, but just because of who they are. Hate crime is often in the form of physical violence, but can also be vandalism and damage to property, insults or other hurtful words, or other violations of human rights. People often commit hate crime because of prejudice about the victim's sex, ethnicity, religion, nationality, gender identity, class, sexual orientation, age, or other things about them. \nThe term \"hate crime\" was first used in the 1980s in the United States, when crimes caused by bias against certain types of people were being talked about in the media. Hate crime is sometimes a way to frighten other people who belong to the same group. This intimidation can be seen as terrorism when it is carried out on a large scale.\nIn 2009, the Matthew Shepard Act has changed the definition of a hate crime in the law of the United States. It says that crimes which were committed because of the victim's sexual orientation, gender identity or disability are hate crimes. It is the first law that protects transgender people. \nEffects of Hate Crimes.\nPeople victimized by violent hate crimes are more likely to experience more psychological distress than victims of other violent crimes. Specifically, victims of crimes that are bias-motivated are more likely to experience post-traumatic stress, safety concerns, depression, anxiety and anger than victims of crimes that are not motivated by bias. Hate crimes send messages to members of the victim\u2019s group that they are unwelcome and unsafe in the community, victimizing the entire group and decreasing feelings of safety and security. Furthermore, witnessing discrimination against one\u2019s own group can lead to psychological distress and lower self-esteem."}

In the past, a doctor could learn almost all that we knew about medicine. Now that is impossible. So after finishing medical school, young doctors choose what kind of doctor they wish to be. After school, they usually do more years of training to learn about the kind of medical specialty they want to do.\nPrimary care doctors.\nSome doctors try to learn \"some\" about all of the different subjects of medicine and how to treat all patients. These doctors are called 'primary care' doctors or \"primary care physicians\" (PCPs). Sometimes they are also called 'generalists' or even 'general practitioners.' In the United States, these kind of doctors are sometimes called family practitioners or family medicine doctors. When a problem is strange or complex, they give it to a specialist. \nThere are other doctors who are also 'primary care' doctors. Pediatricians are primary care doctors, but only for children. Internists are primary care doctors for adults. Some gynecologists do primary care, but for women only.\nSpecialists.\nOther doctors are called 'specialists'. This means they have learned more about certain types of medical care. For example:\nMedicine and surgery.\nIn the broadest meaning of 'medicine', there are many different specialties. However, within medical circles, there are two broad categories: \"Medicine\" and \"Surgery.\" \nThere are some medical specialties that do not fit into either of these categories, like radiology, pathology, and anesthesia.\nTraining.\nIn the U.S., all specialties must pass all three steps of the national medical board examinations. Steps I and II happen during medical school. Step III happens during intern year, where a person works as a student at a hospital. \nAfter a person passes these exams, they then have to pass more exams that are specifically about their specialty. These tests are both written and oral. \nA doctor is board-certified in their specialty after: \nThere are only a few training spots per specialty each year, so some specialties can be very competitive. Some medical students do not get to train in the specialty they want. Other specialties do not have nearly enough doctors. This can happen because not enough doctors apply for training spots; because more training spots are needed; or because many people fail out of their training program. \nSurgical training.\nSurgical training requires at least five years of residency after medical school. Sub-specialties of surgery often require seven or more years. In addition, fellowships can last another one to three years. Because fellowships can be competitive, many trainees spend another two years on research. Because of this, for some people, their surgical training will not finish until more than a decade after medical school. \nSurgical training can be very difficult and can take a lot of time. An average surgical resident works 75 hours per week. \nSome subspecialties of surgery, like neurosurgery, require even longer hours. Residents training in these specialties often work 80 hours a week. Officially, these specialties only allow their residents to work up to 88 hours per week. However, many surgical programs still require residents to work more than 88 hours a week. \nAttempts to limit the amount of hours that surgical residents work have been difficult, because: \nMedical training.\nMedical training, unlike surgical training, requires three years of residency training after medical school. Doctors can then do a one- to two-year fellowship in their subspecialty. In general, medical residents work less hours than surgical residents."}

Zamenhof, a Polish eye doctor. He created the language to make international communication easier. His goal was to design Esperanto in such a way that people can learn it much more easily than any other national language.\nAt first, Zamenhof called the language ', which means \"The International Language\" in Esperanto. Soon, people began calling it by the simpler name ', which means \"one who hopes\". That name comes from \"\" (\"Doctor who hopes\"), which is what Zamenhof called himself in his first book about Esperanto.\nThere are people who speak Esperanto in many countries and in all the major continents. No one knows exactly how many people now speak Esperanto in the world. Most sources say that there are between several hundred thousand and two million Esperanto speakers. A few people grew up speaking Esperanto as their first language. There may perhaps be around 2,000 of these people. Therefore, Esperanto is the most-used constructed language in the world.\nA person who speaks or supports Esperanto is often called an \"Esperantist\".\nHistory.\nZamenhof's childhood.\nL. L. Zamenhof created Esperanto. He grew up in Bia\u0142ystok, a town that was in the Russian Empire, but is now in Poland. People in Bia\u0142ystok spoke many languages. Zamenhof saw conflicts between individual ethnic groups living there (Russians, Poles, Germans and Jews). He thought that lack of a common language caused these conflicts, so he began creating a language people could share and use internationally. He thought this language should be different from national languages. He wanted it to be culturally neutral and easy-to-learn. He thought people should learn it along with national languages and use Esperanto for communication between people with different native languages.\nFirst attempts.\nFirst, Zamenhof thought about bringing Latin back into use. Although he learned it in school, he realized it was too difficult for normal use. He also studied English and understood that languages did not need to conjugate verbs by person or number. Once he saw two Russian words: \"\u0448\u0432\u0435\u0439\u0446\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f\" (reception, derived from \"\u0448\u0432\u0435\u0439\u0446\u0430\u0440\" - receptionist) and \"\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f\" (confectionery, derived from \"\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0440\" - confectioner). These words with the same ending gave him an idea. He decided that regular prefixes and suffixes could decrease the number of word roots, which one would need for a communication. Zamenhof wanted the root words to be neutral, so he decided to use word roots from Romance and Germanic languages. Those languages were taught in many schools in many places around the world at that time.\nCreation of the final version.\nZamenhof did his first project \"Lingwe uniwersala\" (Universal Language) in 1878. But his father, a language teacher, regarded his son's work as unrealistic. So, he destroyed the original work. Between 1879 and 1885 Zamenhof studied medicine in Moscow and Warsaw. In these days he again worked on an international language. In 1887 he published his first textbook ' (\"The International Language\"). According to Zamenhof's pen-name ' (\"Doctor who hopes\"), many people started calling the language as \"Esperanto\".\nFirst attempts to change.\nZamenhof received a lot of enthusiastic letters. In the letters, people wrote their suggestions for changes to the language. He noted all of the suggestions. He published them in the magazine \"La Esperantisto\". In this magazine, Esperanto speakers could vote about the changes. They did not accept them. The magazine had many subscribers in Russia. It was eventually banned (stopped) there because of an article about Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy. Publishing of the magazine ended after that. The new magazine \"Lingvo Internacia\" replaced it.\nProgress of the community.\nIn the first years of Esperanto's life, people used it only in written form, but in 1905 they organized the first (1st) World Congress of Esperanto in Boulogne-sur-Mer, France. This was the first notable use of Esperanto in international communication. Because of the success of the congress, it is organized each year (except years of the World Wars) to this day.\nIn 1912 Zamenhof resigned his leading position in the movement during the eighth (8th) World Congress of Esperanto in Krak\u00f3w, Poland. The tenth (10th) World Congress of Esperanto in Paris, France, did not take place because of the start of World War I. Nearly 4000 people signed up for this congress.\nTimes of the World Wars.\nDuring World War I the World Esperanto Association had its main office in Switzerland, which was neutral in the war. Hector Hodler's group of volunteers with support of Romain Rolland helped send letters between the enemy countries through Switzerland. In total, they helped with 200,000 cases.\nAfter World War I there was new hope for Esperanto because of the desire of people to live in peace. Esperanto and its community grew in those days. The first World Congress after the war took place in Hague, Netherlands, in 1920. An Esperanto Museum was opened in Vienna, Austria, in 1929. Today it is part of the Austrian National Library.\nWorld War II stopped this growing of the language. Many Esperantists were sent into the battle. Nazis broke up Esperanto groups because they saw the language as a part of a worldwide Jewish conspiracy. Many Esperanto speakers died in concentration camps. The Soviet Union also treated Esperantists badly when Stalin was their leader.\nAfter the wars.\nAfter World War II many people supported Esperanto. 80 million people signed a petition supporting Esperanto for use in the United Nations.\nEvery year they organize big Esperanto meetings such as the World Congress of Esperanto, International Youth Congress of Esperanto and SAT-Congress (meeting of \"Sennacieca Asocio Tutmonda\" - World Non-national Association).\nIn 1990, the Holy See published the document \"Norme per la celebrazione della Messa in esperanto\", allowing the use of Esperanto in Masses without special permission. Esperanto is the only constructed language which received a permission like this one from the Roman Catholic Church.\nEsperanto has many web pages, blogs, podcasts, and videos. People also use Esperanto in social media and online discussions and in their private communication through e-mail and instant messaging. Several (especially open source and free software) programmes have their own language version in Esperanto. Internet radio station \"Muzaiko\" has been broadcasting 24\u00a0hours a day in Esperanto since 2011.\nGoals of the Esperanto movement.\nZamenhof wanted to make an easy language to increase international understanding. He wanted Esperanto to be a universal second language. In other words, although he did not want Esperanto to replace national languages, he wanted a majority of people around the world to speak Esperanto. Many Esperantists initially shared this goal. General Assembly of UNESCO recognized Esperanto in 1954. Since then World Esperanto Association has got official relations with UNESCO. However, Esperanto was never chosen by the United Nations or other international organizations and it has not become a widely accepted second language.\nSome Esperanto speakers like Esperanto for reasons other than its use as a universal second language. They like the Esperanto community and culture. Developing the Esperanto culture is a goal for that people.\nPeople who care more about Esperanto's current value than about its potential for universal use are sometimes called \"ra\u016dmistoj\" in Esperanto. The ideas of these people can together be called \"\", or \"Raumism\" in English. The names come from the name of the town of Rauma, in Finland. The International Youth Congress of Esperanto met there in 1980 and made a big statement. They said that making Esperanto a universal second language was not their main goal.\nPeople who have goals for Esperanto that are more similar to Zamenhof's are sometimes called ' in Esperanto. The name comes from ', an Esperanto phrase which means \"final victory\". It refers to a theoretical future in which nearly everyone on Earth speaks Esperanto as a second language.\nThe Prague Manifesto (1996) states the ideas of the ordinary people of the Esperanto movement and of its main organization, the World Esperanto Association (UEA).\nGerman town Herzberg am Harz uses nickname \"die Esperanto-Stadt/la Esperanto-urbo\" (\"the Esperanto town\") since July 12, 2006. They also teach the language in elementary schools and do some other cultural and educational events using the Esperanto language together with the Polish twin town G\u00f3ra.\nEsperanto is the only constructed language that the Roman Catholic Church recognises as a liturgical language. They allow Masses in the language and Vatican Radio broadcasts in Esperanto every week.\nEsperanto culture.\nMany people use Esperanto to communicate by mail, email, blogs or chat rooms with Esperantists in other countries. Some travel to other countries to meet and talk in Esperanto with other Esperantists.\nMeetings.\nThere are annual meetings of Esperantists. The largest is the ' (\"World Congress of Esperanto\"), which is held in a different country each year. In recent years around 2,000 people have attended it, from 60 or more countries. For young people there is ' (\"International Youth Congress of Esperanto\").\nA lot of different cultural activities take place during Esperanto meetings: concerts of Esperanto musicians, dramas, discos, presentations of the culture of the host country and culture of the countries of the participants, lectures, language-courses, and so on. At the location of Esperanto meetings there is also a pub, a tearoom, a bookstore, etc. with Esperanto-speaking workers. The number of activities and possibilities depends on the size or on the theme of the meeting.\nLiterature.\nThere are books and magazines written in Esperanto. Much literature has been translated into Esperanto from other languages, including famous works, like the Bible (first time in 1926) and plays by Shakespeare. Works that are less famous have also been translated into Esperanto, and some of these do not have English translations.\nImportant Esperanto writers are for example: Trevor Steele (Australia), Istv\u00e1n Nemere (Hungary) and Mao Zifu (China). William Auld was a British writer of poetry in Esperanto and honorary president of the Esperanto PEN Centre (Esperanto part of International PEN). Some people recommended him for the Nobel Prize in Literature.\nMusic.\nThere is music of different genres in Esperanto, including folk songs, rock music, cabaret, songs for solo singers, choirs and opera. Among active Esperanto musicians is for example Swedish socio-critical music group \"La Perdita Generacio\", Occitan singer \"JoMo\", the Finnish group \"Dolchamar\", Brazilian group \"Supernova\", Frisian group \"Kajto\" or Polish singer-songwriter Georgo Handzlik. Also some popular music writers and artists, including Elvis Costello and American singer Michael Jackson recorded songs in Esperanto, composed songs inspired by the language or used it in their promotional materials. Some songs from the album Esperanto from Warner Bros., which released - all in Esperanto - in Spain, in November 1996, reached a high position in the Spanish record charts; similarly, in 1999, in Germany, hip-hop music group \"Freundeskreis\" became famous with their single \"Esperanto\". Classical works for orchestra and choir with texts in Esperanto are \"La Koro Sutro\" by Lou Harrison and \"The First Symphony\" by David Gaines. In Toulouse, France, there is Vinilkosmo, which produces Esperanto music. The main internet Esperanto songbook KantarViki has got 3,000 songs in May 2013, both original and translated.\nTheatre and film.\nThey play dramas from different writers such as Carlo Goldoni, Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco and William Shakespeare also in Esperanto. Filmmakers sometimes use Esperanto in the background of films, for example in \"The Great Dictator\" by Charlie Chaplin, in the action film \"Blade: Trinity\" or in comedy sci-fi television series \"Red Dwarf\". Feature films in Esperanto are not very common, but there are about 15 feature films, which have Esperanto themes.\nThe 1966 film \"Incubus\" is notable because its dialogues are in Esperanto only. Today some people translate subtitles of different films to Esperanto. The website \"Verda Filmejo\" collects these subtitles.\nRadio and television.\nRadio stations in Brazil, China, Cuba and Vatican broadcast regular programmes in Esperanto. Some other radio programmes and podcasts are available on the Internet. Internet radio station \"Muzaiko\" broadcasts Esperanto programmes on the Internet 24\u00a0hours a day since July 2011. Between 2005 and 2006 there was also a project of international television \"Internacia Televido\" in Esperanto. Esperanto TV broadcasts on the Internet from Sydney, Australia, since April 5, 2014.\nInternet.\nOn the Internet there are many online discussions in Esperanto about different topics. There are many websites, blogs, podcasts, videos, television, and radio stations in Esperanto (see above). Google Translate supports translations from and into Esperanto since February 22, 2012 as its 64th language.\nApart from websites and blogs of esperantists and Esperanto organizations, there is also an Esperanto Wikipedia (Vikipedio) and other projects of Wikimedia Foundation which has also got their Esperanto language version or they use Esperanto (Wikibooks, Wikisource, Wikinews, Wikimedia Commons and Wikidata). People can also use an Esperanto version of social networks, for example Facebook, Diaspora and other websites.\nSeveral computer programmes also have an Esperanto version, such as web browser Firefox and office suite (set of programmes for use in an office) \"LibreOffice\".\nThe language.\nEsperanto uses grammar and words from many natural languages, such as Latin, Russian, and French. Morphemes in Esperanto (the smallest parts of a word that can have a meaning) cannot be changed and people can combine them into many different words. The language has got common attributes with isolating languages (they use word order to change the meaning of a sentence) such as Chinese, while the inner structure of Esperanto words has got common attributes with agglutinative languages (they use affixes to change the meaning of a word), such as Turkish, Swahili and Japanese.\nEsperanto's grammar (rules of language) is meant to be simple. The rules in Esperanto never change and can always be applied in the same way\nAlphabet.\nThe Esperanto alphabet is based on the Latin script. It has six letters with diacritics: \u0109, \u011d, \u0125, \u0135, \u015d (with circumflex), and \u016d (with breve). The alphabet does not have the letters \"q, w, x,\" or \"y\".\nThe 28-letter alphabet is:\nWriting diacritics.\nEven the world uses the Unicode, the letters with diacritics (found in the \"Latin-Extended A\" section of the Unicode Standard) can cause problems with printing and computing, because they are not found on the keyboards we use.\nThere are two remedies of this problem, both of which uses digraphs for the letters with diacritics. Zamenhof, the inventor of Esperanto, an \"h-system\", which replaces \"\u0109, \u011d, \u0125, \u0135, \u015d,\" and \"\u016d\" with \"ch, gh, hh, jh, sh,\" and \"u,\" respectively. A more recent \"x-system\" has also been used, which replaces \"\u0109, \u011d, \u0125, \u0135, \u015d,\" and \"\u016d\" with \"cx, gx, hx, jx, sx,\" and \"ux,\" respectively.\nThere are computer keyboards that support the Esperanto alphabet, for example, for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux, for Windows Phone, and Gboard &amp; AnySoftKeyboard for Android.\nCriticism.\nSome of the criticism of Esperanto is common for any project of constructed international language: a new language has little chance to replace today's international languages like English, French and others.\nThe criticism, which is specific for Esperanto, targets various parts of the language itself (the special Esperanto letters, the \"-n\" ending, sound of the language, and so on).\nSome peoplesay that use of the diacritics (the letters \u0109, \u011d, \u0125, \u0135, \u015d, \u016d) make the language less neutral than it would be using only the basic letters of Latin alphabet. No other language uses the letters \u0109, \u0125 and \u0135. The letter \u0125 is the least used letter in Esperanto and \u0135 is not used frequently either, leading people to question how necessary they are.\nCritics of Esperantoalso say that the same ending of an adjective and a noun (such as \", \", \"\") is unnecessary. English, for example, does not have the requirement that an adjective and noun must agree in tense, and has no indicator for accusative cases.\nThey also criticize the fact that most of the words in Esperanto come from Indo-European languages, which makes the language less neutral.\nOne of the common criticisms from both non-Esperanto-speakers and those who speak Esperanto, is that there is language sexism in Esperanto. Some words by default refer to males, and the feminine counterparts have to be constructed by adding the \"-in-\" suffix to the masculine root. Such a words are words like ' (father) and ' (mother), ' (son) and ' (daughter), ' (uncle) and ' (aunt), and so on. The majority of all Esperanto words have no specific meaning on the basis of sex. Some people proposed the suffix \"-i\u0109-\" with male meaning in order to make the meaning of the basic word neutral. However this proposal is not widely accepted by Esperanto speakers.\nCriticism of some parts of Esperanto motivated the creation of various new constructed languages like Ido, Novial, Interlingua and Lojban. However, none of these constructed languages have as many speakers as Esperanto does.\nExample of text.\nNormal sample: \u0108iuj homoj estas denaske liberaj kaj egalaj la\u016d digno kaj rajtoj. Ili posedas racion kaj konsciencon, kaj devus konduti unu la alian en spirito de frateco.\nVersion in h-system: Chiuj homoj estas denaske liberaj kaj egalaj lau digno kaj rajtoj. Ili posedas racion kaj konsciencon, kaj devus konduti unu la alian en spirito de frateco.\nVersion in x-system: Cxiuj homoj estas denaske liberaj kaj egalaj laux digno kaj rajtoj. Ili posedas racion kaj konsciencon, kaj devus konduti unu la alian en spirito de frateco.\nSimple English translation: All people are free and equal in dignity and rights. They are reasonable and moral, and should act kindly to each other.\nMetaphoric use of the word \"Esperanto\".\nPeople sometimes use the word \"Esperanto\" in a metaphoric way (not in its literal sense). They use it to say that something aims to be international or neutral, or it uses a wide mixture of ideas. They say the programming language Java is \"independent of specific computer systems [e.g. Windows, Android] like Esperanto is independent of ... nations\". Similarly, they call the font \"Noto\" \"the Esperanto of fonts\" because it tries to work well for every culture's writing."}

W. Bush, and the First Lady of the United States from 1989 to 1993. She was the mother of the 43rd U.S. President George W. Bush and of the 43rd Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush. Previously, she was the Second Lady of the United States from 1981 to 1989.\nEarly life.\nBush was born at NewYork\u2013Presbyterian Queens in Flushing, Queens on New York. Her parents were Pauline Robinson (1896-1949) and her husband, Marvin Pierce (1893-1969). Her mother died in a car accident. Her ancestor Thomas Pierce, an early New England colonist, was also an ancestor of Franklin Pierce, the 14th President of the United States. She is a fourth cousin, four times removed of Franklin Pierce.\nBush spent her early childhood in Rye, New York. She began her studies in a school there. Then she studied in a boarding school at Ashley Hall in Charleston, South Carolina.\nFamily.\nAt a dance party, Barbara met George H. W. Bush. At that time she was 17 years old, and George Bush was a student at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. They got engaged just before Bush went to fight in World War II. He was a torpedo bomber of the United States Navy. George named three of his airplanes after Barbara: \"Barbara,\" \"Barbara II\", and \"Barbara III\". In December 1944, Bush returned to the USA on leave. Two weeks later, they married on January 6, 1945. After World War II, Bush graduated from the Yale University. They moved to Midland, Texas. In 1953, the Bushes' daughter Robin died of leukemia. On April 13, 2013, she became a great-grandmother after her granddaughter Jenna Bush Hager gave birth to a daughter.\nChildren.\nBush had six children:\nPersonal life.\nOver the years, the Bush family moved 29 times. George H. W. Bush had become a successful person and had founded Zapata Corporation. He had a variety of government jobs. George H. W. Bush became the 41st President of the United States in 1989 and served until 1993.\nWhile First Lady.\nBush became the First Lady of the United States when her husband was the 41st President of the United States from 1989 to 1993. She made a paw print of her pet Millie for a holiday card in 1991.\nAfter being First Lady.\nAfter her husband's presidency, they moved to Houston, Texas. They also had a big house in Kennebunkport, Maine.\nOn March 18, 2003, two days before the beginning of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, when her son George W. Bush was President, ABC's \"Good Morning America\" asked her about her family's television viewing habits. She replied:\nI watch none. He [former President George H.W. Bush] sits and listens and I read books, because I know perfectly well that, don't take offense, that 90 percent of what I hear on television is supposition, when we're talking about the news. And he's not, not as understanding of my pettiness about that. But why should we hear about body bags and deaths, and how many, what day it's gonna happen, and how many this or that or what do you suppose? Or, I mean, it's not relevant. So, why should I waste my beautiful mind on something like that, and watch him suffer.\nWhile visiting a Houston relief center for people displaced by Hurricane Katrina, Bush told the radio program \"Marketplace\",\nAlmost everyone I've talked to says, 'We're gonna move to Houston.' What I'm hearing, which is sort of scary, is they all want to stay in Texas... Everybody is so overwhelmed by the hospitality, and so many of the people in the arenas here, you know, were underprivileged anyway, so this (as she chuckles slightly) is working very well for them.\nThe remarks were controversial. In 2006, it was revealed that Barbara Bush donated an undisclosed amount of money to the Bush\u2013Clinton Katrina Fund on the condition that the charity do business with an educational software company owned by her son Neil Bush.\nIn November 2008, Bush was hospitalized for abdominal pains. On November 25, a dime-sized hole in her small intestine was found by surgeons. She was released on December 2, 2008 and was reported to be doing well.\nBush underwent aortic valve replacement surgery on March 4, 2009; she was released from the hospital on March 13, 2009.\nIn a November 2010 interview with Larry King, Bush was asked about former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. Bush remarked, \"I sat next to her once, thought she was beautiful, and I think she's very happy in Alaska, and I hope she'll stay there.\" Palin responded, \"I don't want to, sort of, concede that we have to get used to this kind of thing, because I think the majority of Americans don't want to put up with the blue-bloods \u2013 and I say it with all due respect, because I love the Bushes \u2013 but, the blue-bloods, who want to pick and choose their winners, instead of allowing competition to pick and choose the winners.\"\nBarbara Bush was portrayed by Ellen Burstyn in the 2008 movie \"W.\".\nHealth and death.\nIn November 2008, Bush was hospitalized for abdominal pains. She had surgery on her small intestine. Bush underwent aortic valve replacement surgery in March 2009.\nOn December 31, 2013, Bush was hospitalized at The Methodist Hospital, in Houston, Texas, for a \"respiratory related issue\". She was in stable condition and received a visit from her family, according to the Bush family's statement to the media. She returned in 2010 for routine testing. On January 4, 2014, Bush was released from the hospital. It was announced she had been suffering from pneumonia. She said, \"I cannot thank the doctors and nurses at Houston Methodist enough for making sure I got the best treatment and got back to George and our dogs as quickly as possible.\" \nOn April 15, 2018 it was reported by a source close to the Bush family that Barbara was in \"failing health\". She decided to have only \"comfort care\", which is placing end-of life patients under comfort care until they die. She chose to be at home with her family rather than go back to the hospital for treatment. She suffered from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure (COPD) and Grave's disease. Bush died on April 17, 2018 in Houston of complications from COPD and congestive heart failure at the age of 92. She was buried at the George Bush Presidential Library in College Station, Texas on April 21, 2018."}

It became famous with the release of \"Dreamboat Annie\" in 1976 when the band-members were living in Vancouver.\nHeart was started by Steve Fossen and brothers Roger and Mike Fisher in Seattle. Ann Wilson joined the band in Seattle in 1970. Nancy Wilson joined the band in 1974. From then, Ann and Nancy wrote almost all of the band's songs. From 1976, the band was very successful, and sold many millions of records.\nAnn Wilson was the lead singer and sometimes played the flute. Roger Fisher played the lead guitar and sang. Steve Fossen played the bass guitar. Nancy Wilson played lots of different types of guitar and sang. Mike Fisher managed the band and also looked after the sound and the lights. In 1975 some extra people joined the band. Michael DeRosier played the drums. Howard Leese played lots of different instruments and stayed with the band until 1998.\nThe Fisher brothers left the band in 1979. Steve Fossen and Michael DeRosier left the band in 1982. Denny Carmassi played the drums, Mark Andes played the bass guitar, and Nancy Wilson played the lead guitar. The band did not do much in the 1990s, but Ann &amp; Nancy started doing things again in the early 2000s. Since then, the band has made lots of appearances in public and on TV.\nBarracuda.\nTheir best known song is called Barracuda. It was written in 1977 by Ann and Nancy Wilson, Michael DeRosier, Sue Ennis (a friend of Ann and Nancy) and Roger Fisher. Some of the places it has been and used are:\nRecords.\nThe band's first album went on sale in 1976. It was given the name \"Dreamboat Annie\". A lot of people liked the album and more than one million (1,000,000) copies of it were sold. The album had the ballads \"How Deep It Goes\" and \"(Love Me Like Music) I'll Be Your song.\" In addition it had the songs \"Magic Man\" and \"Crazy On You\". After lots of people had bought copies of the \"Dreamboat Annie\" album, Heart changed to a new record company.\nTheir second album in 1977 was given the name \"Little Queen\". It had the hard rock song \"Barracuda\". \"Barracuda\" and \"Dreamboat Annie\" are Heart's best known early songs.\nA third album was called \"Magazine\". It was given to the shops by the old record company \"before\" \"Little Queen\" was made. Heart did not like this, and wanted all copies of \"Magazine\" to be destroyed. They took the old record company to court. The judge ordered that the old record company must stop selling the album. The judge also ordered that Heart must make a new album for the old record company. This new album was also called \"Magazine\". It was given to the shops \"after\" \"Little Queen\" was made.\nIn 1978, the band released \"Dog &amp; Butterfly\". It was very different in musical style from the first three albums. Sue Ennis was a friend of Ann and Nancy Wilson. She helped write a lot of the songs on \"Dog &amp; Butterfly\". Two of the songs were named \"Straight On\" and \"Dog &amp; Butterfly\". Heart did not sell as many copies of this album. The next two or three albums were not very good. Roger Fisher and Steve Fossen left the band.\nIn 1985 the band had new people in it, and had a new record company. They made an album called \"Heart\", and it sold lots of copies. The sort of music that Heart played was different. In the 1970s, the music was hard rock. In the 1980s the music was Top 40 pop. Some of the songs were \"How Can I Refuse\", \"What About Love\", \"Alone\", \"Never\", \"These Dreams\" and \"All I Want To Do Is Make Love To You\".\nIn the 1990s, as well as performing and touring as Heart, the Wilson sisters started another band with Sue Ennis. They called this band \"The LoveMongers\". The also set up a recording studio in Seattle which they called \"Bad Animals\". Bad Animals is also the name of an album they made in 1987\nIn 1999, Nancy made a solo album called \"Live at McCabes Guitar Shop\".

They began in 1961 in The Hague; named the Golden Earrings. In 1969, they became just Golden Earring, (dropping the \"s\"). They gained worldwide fame with their hit song \"Radar Love\" in 1973. The single was number one on the Dutch charts, in the top ten in the United Kingdom and number thirteen on the American music charts.\n\"Twilight Zone\" in 1982, and \"When the Lady Smiles\" in 1984 were also hit singles. During their career they had nearly 30 top-ten singles on the Dutch charts. Over the years they produced 25 studio albums. All musicians in the band have been members of the band since 1970. Other musicians, however, have come and gone during all these years.\nIn March 2009, Golden Earring celebrated its comeback in the United Kingdom with two concerts in Ipswich and London. Golden Earring's newest studio album was recorded live in a studio in London. It was released in May 2012. The album, named \"Tits 'n Ass\", went to number one in the Dutch album charts.\nCareer.\nGolden Earring went on their first major US tour in 1969 and 1970. Between 1969 and 1984, the band completed thirteen US tours.\nGolden Earring enjoyed a brief period of international stardom but were unable to get further chart success until 1982's \"Twilight Zone\". This was followed by \"The Lady Smiles\" in 1984.\nThe Russian rock band Aria made a successful cover version of a single, \"Going To The Run\". From 1992 to 2004 the band released three acoustic live \"unplugged\" albums which were successful. Since 1992, the band has performed popular acoustic unplugged theater-shows. The acoustic albums feature unplugged versions of famous hits of the band.\nHit singles.\n\"Radar Love\", from the album \"Moontan\", became a hit in both Europe and the USA in 1973. The album \"Moontan\" itself was awarded a gold record in the States. This is the band's best known song. There have been more than 200 cover versions of this classic rock song. It was voted \"best car song ever\" by readers of \"USA Today\" in 2005 and second-best \"greatest driving song\" in a poll of BBC's programme \"Top Gear\".\nGeorge Kooymans, the band's vocalist and guitarist, wrote \"Twilight Zone\". It was released in 1982 and brought Golden Earring more success. This song also had one of the first music videos. It was aired on the new music television channel, MTV, which began in 1981. This helped \"Twilight Zone\" become a Top Ten hit in the States. The song was inspired by the popular TV series \"The Twilight Zone\".\n\"When the Lady Smiles\", from the album \"News\", was the next international hit in 1984. It became a top hit in Europe and Canada with the help of a music video. It was not as successful in the States. The music video was banned from MTV because it showed nudity and the rape of a nun.\nDiscography.\nThe complete discography of Golden Earring is 25 studio albums, 8 live albums, 2 compilation albums, and 74 singles. \nThis is a list of the studio albums:"}

{"id": "13370", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13370", "title": "Orgasm", "text": "An orgasm is a sexual climax (or high point). An orgasm happens because of continued sexual touching. During an orgasm, there is a strong feeling of excitement and pleasure. Sexual touching may be sexual intercourse, rubbing or squeezing by hand (called masturbation), or other actions that make the sex organs feel good. \nDuring an orgasm, a person's body sometimes spasms (shakes or trembles), and the person may appear to be in pain or get a strange look on their face.\nThe person's brain activity changes quickly. The parts of the brain responsible for fear, worry and self-control become less active. Many people moan, shout or say strange things during orgasm. Usually, people's minds focus almost completely on the pleasure of the orgasm, and become less aware of what is going on around them than usual.\nOrgasms may happen when people are asleep. When men orgasm while sleeping, it is often called a \"wet dream\".\nOther mammals may have orgasms when they have sex.\nMale orgasm.\nThe penis usually becomes erect (hard) before an orgasm, and flaccid (soft) again after. When a man has an orgasm, his penis spasms and undergoes a series of rhythmic contractions, during which he feels a very strong and enjoyable feeling in his penis and groin, and sometimes in all of his body. In a man, an orgasm usually happens at the same time as an ejaculation, which is a release of semen through the penis that can't be stopped. Young boys can orgasm, but there may be no semen because semen release usually occurs (happens) only after puberty has started. After an orgasm, men usually have a deep sense of relaxation, usually felt in the groin and the thighs. Usually the stronger the orgasm is, the deeper the relaxation and the longer the relaxation will last.\nFemale orgasm.\nA woman's orgasm begins in her clitoris, which is the counterpart of the man's penis. It is preceded by an erection of the clitoris and a moistening of the opening of the vagina. When a woman goes through a full orgasm, her uterus, vagina, anus and pelvic muscles undergo a series of rhythmic contractions. Most women find these contractions very pleasurable. Rubbing or applying other consistent pressure against the clitoris is usually needed to help the woman have an orgasm.\nOrgasm and reproduction.\nOrgasm plays an important role in human reproduction. It is the most exciting moment of sexual intercourse, so it is an important factor that makes men and women want to have intercourse, which allows reproduction to happen. It is also the moment at which the man releases semen into the woman to begin the process of fertilization.\nDuring sexual intercourse, a man places his penis inside a woman's vagina and moves it backwards and forwards. The woman may also move her hips back and forth, or in a circular motion. The friction caused by this movement, together with the warmth and pressure of the vagina, causes the man to have pleasurable feelings in his penis. As intercourse continues, these feelings grow stronger and stronger until the man has an orgasm and ejaculates, at which time semen then shoots out from the end of his penis into the woman's vagina. The semen can make the woman pregnant.\nThe woman may also have one or more orgasms during intercourse as well. Unlike a man, who usually can have only one orgasm during intercourse, a woman may have more than one. During intercourse she may rub her clitoris, or she may have her man do so. This can make the woman have an orgasm. The shaft of the penis may also stimulate the clitoris in some positions. Scientists are not sure why women have orgasms. Some believe that the orgasm helps the sperm in the man's semen to swim up the vagina into the cervix, so that it is more likely that a sperm cell will fuse with an egg cell. Others think that the woman's orgasm is designed to help make the man reach orgasm. During her orgasm, a woman may moan, cry, or scream, which usually excites her man, and her vagina may contract, gripping the penis more tightly and making sex more exciting for him. These reactions may cause the man to ejaculate more quickly or to produce more semen; when a woman reaches orgasm during intercourse, it often makes her man have an orgasm at that point as well. Orgasm may also encourage a woman to have sex more often as it feels good, increasing the chances of pregnancy. "}

Regular rectal exams are recommended for older men to detect prostate cancer early. \nThe prostate is often referred to as the male G-spot, which is a spot inside the female vagina that causes intense pleasure when it is stimulated.

The fossil feels like, and is, made of rock. It has been mineralised or \"petrified\" (literally, turned into rock). \nA fossil may also be an \"imprint\" or \"impression\" of a living thing remaining in the fossilised mud of a long-gone age. \nSome organisms fossilise well, others do not. The most common fossils are those left behind by organisms that produce hard materials. The hard, calcitic shells of molluscs (such as clams and snails) and of now-rare brachiopods (also known as lampshells) are examples. These sea-dwelling shellfish have produced many fossiliferous (that is, fossil-bearing) chalky layers of limestone in the earth. \nSoft-bodied organisms can fossilise in special circumstances: the Ediacaran biota is a good example. \nThe best-known fossils for the general public are those of the giant, prehistoric dinosaurs. The fossilized bones and fossilized tracks of these huge, ancient reptiles can be seen in many museums of natural history and earth science. \nThe study of fossils by geologists and biologists is known as paleontology. If the study puts living things in their ecological context it is called paleobiology.\nHuman uses.\nHumans have found many uses for fossils. Some fossils are found and sold for money, in Morocco, fossils of ammonites, dinosaurs and sharks are examples of such. Other fossils like those in the Tamiami formation are used in the construction of roads. In some places fossils are used as a mulch- material used to cover soil. Some fossils are used as a marker to determine formation . \nSome fossils are used as a source of fuel, these fossils are referred to as a fossil fuel.\nPlaces of special preservation.\nThere are some sites where fossils have been found with remarkable details, or in large numbers. Palaeontologists call these sites by the German term \"Lagerst\u00e4tten\". The La Brea tar pits in Los Angeles is such a place. So are the Solnhofen limestone quarries in Bavaria.\nA very important place is the Burgess Shale, known for its many important finds\nTypes of fossils.\nMicroscopic or \"very tiny\" fossils are called \"microfossils\"; while larger, \"macroscopic\" fossils \u2014 such as those of seashells and mammals \u2014 are called \"macrofossils\". Natural stones which look like fossilized organisms, but are not fossils at all, are called \"pseudofossils\". \nAlthough most fossils are formed from the hard parts of organisms, there are also \"indirect\" signs of prehistoric life. Examples such as a worm's trail or an animal's footprint are quite common. They are known as \"trace fossils\". Fossilized excrement, faeces or dung is known as a \"coprolite\". Chemical traces of prehistoric organisms is called a \"chemofossil\". Objects made by prehistoric people are called artifacts.\nEven when the remains of soft-bodied animals are gone, there may be impressions, molds or carbon traces which remain permanently. So, in special cases, we do have fossils even of small, soft invertebrate animals. \nSometimes a fossil is produced as a result of dryness (desiccation), freezing, or pine resin. Mummified animals, ice-covered wooly mammoths, and insect-filled amber are examples of such fossils.\nLiving fossils, however, are \"not\" fossils at all. Instead, they are modern-day organisms which very closely resemble their prehistoric ancestors of many millions of years ago. The ginkgo tree, the coelacanth and the horseshoe crab are good examples.\nEarly notice taken of fossils.\nMany pre-scientific peoples noticed fossils, but not all thought they were the remains of living things. Perhaps the first to leave a record of his thought was the Ancient Greek philosopher Xenophanes (about 570\u2013470).p387 His ideas were reported by later writers:\nThese ideas were rediscovered in the 17th century in Europe. Nicolas Steno in the Netherlands and Robert Hooke at the Royal Society in London both wrote and gave lectures about fossils. In the 18th century fossil-collecting began, and serious thinking on geology began to make progress. In the 19th century geology became a modern science, and fossils played a part in the theory of evolution."}
{"id": "13375", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13375", "title": "Nine Inch Nails", "text": "Nine Inch Nails, or NIN, is the name of a famous industrial metal band. Trent Reznor writes all the band's songs and plays most of the music himself. He started the band in 1988 in Cleveland, Ohio, USA. Nine Inch Nails have been nominated for twelve Grammy Awards.\nHistory.\n\"Pretty Hate Machine\" (1989-1991).\n\"Pretty Hate Machine\" was Nine Inch Nails' first album. It first came out in 1989. The songs \"Down In It\", \"Head Like A Hole\", and \"Sin\" became famous from the radio and MTV.\n\"Broken\" and \"Fixed\" (1992-1993).\nIn 1992, Nine Inch Nails made a short album called \"Broken\". It had only eight songs. The song \"Wish\" won a Grammy Award. Another album, called \"Fixed\", has some of the same songs as \"Broken\", but other musicians have changed the music and added new sounds. It was initially going to be one studio album (with eleven tracks, the eight tracks on Broken as tracks 1-8 and tracks 4-6 on Fixed as tracks 9-11), making it the second studio album and \"Downward Spiral\" the third studio album, but decided to split it in half due to personal reasons and it was not the second studio album.\nNine Inch Nails played the very first Lolapalooza tour alongside Jane's Addiction and other bands.\n\"Downward Spiral\" (1994-1996).\nA new album called \"The Downward Spiral\" came out in 1994. It is the most popular and famous Nine Inch Nails album. Music stores have sold more than 4 million copies of \"The Downward Spiral\" all together. The songs \"Closer\", \"March Of The Pigs\", and \"Hurt\" were very popular on MTV and radio stations. Trent Reznor asked many other musicians to make remixes from the songs. The remixes were released on a new album called \"Further Down The Spiral\".\nIn 1994, Nine Inch Nails played at the Woodstock 94 concert in New York. After that, they became one of the most famous bands in the world. For five years, there were no Nine Inch Nails albums or concerts. Many fans worried that the band they liked would stop making music forever.\nOther works and \"The Fragile\" (1997-2001).\nFinally, a new album came out in 1999. It was called \"The Fragile\". It was the longest album Nine Inch Nails had ever made, and the music was very different from the old albums. It was initially going to release in fall 1997 (and was also going to include \"The Perfect Drug\") but got pushed back due to personal problems and The Perfect Drug was never put on the album. Many of the songs were only music with no words. Songs like that are called \"instrumentals\". Writers who write about music wrote good things about \"The Fragile\" in many magazines and newspapers. People knew the music of Nine Inch Nails had changed, but many people thought it was better than before.\nEven though many people liked the album, it would still take Trent Reznor another five years to make another one. This was due to Trent Reznor drinking and becoming addicted to other drugs. He is now healthy. Trent also argued with his manager John Malm over how much money he should make. The court has agreed with Trent and John is no longer Trent's manager.\n\"With Teeth\" (2002-2006).\nNine Inch Nails' next album was called \"With Teeth\". When the song \"The Hand That Feeds\" was first played on the radio, fans were very happy that Nine Inch Nails had come back. The second song on the album to be played on the radio is \"Only\" and the third is \"Every Day Is Exactly The Same\".\n\"Year Zero\", \"Ghosts I-IV\" and hiatus (2007-2010).\nYear Zero came out on April 17, 2007. Before it came out, there was a game that people could play. You could find clues to discover more about the story. That kind of game is called an \"Alternate Reality Game\". Only one \"single\" came out. That song is called \"Survivalism\". \nOn March 2, 2008, the albums \"Ghosts I-IV\" (1 to 4) came out. It was made of 4 small albums Ghosts 1, 2, 3 and 4. All the songs on these albums were instrumentals and the first album was free to download from the website, or available cheaply to download. This was new in the way that music is sold, because usually music is sold for lots of money, and the money is given to many people, most who did not make the music, but helped give money to the people who did, or sent the music to shops to be sold, or made adverts for it.\nAfter two months since the release of \"Ghosts I-IV\", a new album came out called \"The Slip\" on May 5, 2008. \"The Slip\" was released in three formats for free.\n\"Hesitation Marks\" (2011-present).\nThe latest Nine Inch Nails' album, \"Hesitation Marks\" (2013), was nominated for Best Alternative Music Album at the 2014 Grammy Awards.\nBand.\nTrent Reznor makes almost all of the music for Nine Inch Nails. He is the only member.\nWhen Nine Inch Nails plays at concerts, other musicians are also part of the band. The musicians who play in Nine Inch Nails are not always the same. Now, Trent Reznor sings and plays some instruments, Robin Finck plays the guitar, Justin Meldal-Johnsen plays the bass guitar, and Ilan Rubin plays the drums. "}
{"id": "13376", "revid": "810861", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13376", "title": "Remixing", "text": "In remixing, a person (often a recording engineer or record producer or lyrics producer) takes a familiar song, splits it into different parts called \"tracks\", and changes the song's music, instruments, layout, and or vocals to create a new version of the same song. It is called \"remixing\" due to mixing being the putting together of all the parts of a song, and \"remixing\" being the putting together of the parts of the song differently than the original.\nRemixers, that is, people who remix, are musicians who use a variety of tools, primarily electronic, to create the new song versions. Remixing can be simply moving song parts around; it can also be creating new music for an old song lyric. There are two common kinds of remixing: production and mashups. Production remixing uses new instruments with the old song vocal, and mashups use two old songs mixed together to create a new song.\nIt is pertinent to mention that the remix of R. Kelly and Beyonce's song \"If I were a boy\" shows that remixing also involves the editing of the words of a music to publicize more enlightenment gained from over time listening and attuning of the soul to the music by the general public. This tells musicians to be cautious about the wordings of their music. The wordings are as beautiful as the sound the soul hears, because the soul listens to the music and not the ears necessarily. A fine captivating lyrics with poor musical sound can last for many uncountable centuries as most captivating music than a music with a captivating sound but poor lyrics. Events of our daily life can be used to produce remix for most music we have lived out innocently. This is a very green field opportunity for upcoming remixers. E.g. One can do a remix about Dolly Parton's song - Jolene capturing the insecurity of a woman in keeping her man because of her inferior outlook to that of a woman who in her seemed inferior outlook discovers the confidence that Jolene in her air of superiority can never and will never ever be able to take her man even if she looks like the moon on a very dark night or the twinkle stars decorating the dark clouds at night.\nThen after some years of listening to it, another remixer releases another insight on why Jolene has to stop exerting that air of superiority on the women around her, seeing she has done so much harm to the concept 'love'. And it can go on and on, bringing out the best styles, tactics and ideology to love better in diversified ways making us more sane with love rather than being insane.\nAn African can choose to do a remix where Jolene is welcomed by Dolly Parton to share her man with her seeing that it is part of our African religion and we have it as a responsibility to polish it to gold. Music without its lyrics properly guided is dead, this is majorly the essence of remixing. Sounds would be exhausted but knowledge cannot be exhausted and knowledge is an embodiment of the lyrics and not the sound. Tu-face Idibia, P-Square and the rest can explore this.\nProduction.\n\"Production remixing\" requires more musical knowledge than mashups, because one must make their own music. This music generally is within the same key and has the same rhythm or melody as the old song.\nMany electronic music artists (music made with computers or other electronic instruments) use computer software to make new music parts, called \"tracks\". The music parts contain notes which are arranged with a computer program called a sequencer. The actual notes are played by instruments, usually synthesizers, a type of electronic musical instrument that makes sounds by changing the shape of a sound wave. It is also possible for a remixer to use a drum sample kit, a set of sounds of fake or real drums recorded for use on a computer.\nRendering\nWhen the remixer has a proper sequence in the sequencer, he or she can then render the audio part, or track. Rendering requires the sequencer to talk to the musical instrument, usually by computer software or a computer-to-computer talking language called MIDI to an actual electronic keyboard. The sequencer tells the instrument which note to play, and then the instrument plays the note. The sequencer writes this note to a music file on the computer.\nMashups.\nA mashup is a remixing style in which a remixer takes two songs and mixes them with each other in a clever way to create a new song. Usually, it is the vocal of the song they want to remix with the other musical parts of an older song.\nInstead of using a sequencer and a musical instrument, a remixer can use either record-playing turntables or a computer with an audio sequence editor, for example the program named ACID music. He or she also needs an audio editor, a computer program that allows someone to record sounds into a computer as well as cut them down to smaller bits.\nUsually, a small bit of the old song is \"cut\" in an audio editor into a loop, a piece of music that when played on repeat does not have any skips or musical pauses. This loop is usually called a \"sample\" in the world of remixing. This sample is then looped (played over and over) in a sequence to create a new sound. The remixer then mixes the vocal of another song over that loop.\nIt is also possible that a mashup style remixer will take the entire musical part of one song without its vocal - called an instrumental - and take a vocal from another song without the non-voice part - called an acapella, and put them together to create one song."}

{"id": "13384", "revid": "16695", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13384", "title": "Hormone", "text": "Hormones are the chemical messengers of the endocrine system. Hormones are the signals which adjust the body's internal working, together with the nervous system. Every multicellular organism has hormones. The cells which react to a given hormone have special receptors for that hormone. When a hormone attaches to the receptor protein a mechanism for signalling is started. The cell or tissue that gets the message is called the 'target'. Hormones only act on cells which have the right receptors.\nMany different kinds of cells can send a message. There are some cells whose main job is to make hormones. When many of these cells are together, they are called a gland. Glands are groups of cells that make something and release it (put it outside the cell). Many glands make hormones.\n\"Endocrine\" means secreting directly into the blood. Most internal secretions are from endocrine glands. The opposite word is \"exocrine\", which means secreting through a duct or tube. Some hormones are produced by exocrine glands, and some exocrine secretions release outside the body. Sweat glands and salivary glands are examples of exocrine glands whose products are released outside the body.\nThe first discovery of a hormone was made in 1902. The hormone was secretin. The word 'hormone' was first used in 1905.\nActions.\nHormones do many things. They regulate metabolism. Metabolism is the chemical and energy reactions that happen in a living thing. Hormones cause the growth and death of cells and of whole organisms. Hormones also start and control sexual development. For example, the hormones estrogen and progesterone make girls go through puberty. Hormones help keep homeostasis in an organism. Homeostasis means to keep a constant state inside the body like temperature, amount of water and salts, and amount of sugar. Hormones released by one gland can also tell other glands to make different hormones.\nTypes of hormones.\nThere are four types of hormones in most vertebrates. They are grouped by the chemicals from which they are made. \nRegulation of hormones.\nIn biology regulation means to control something. So regulating hormones means controlling how much hormones are made and released from cells.\nNegative feedback.\nHormone regulation is mostly done by negative feedback. In negative feedback, a hormone causes an effect. The cells that make the hormone detect this effect and its production ceases.\nA good example of negative feedback is with the hormone insulin. Insulin is produced by the pancreas. Insulin is released by the pancreas in response to consumption of glucose. The amount of glucose in the blood rises, and the pancreas detects the increase. It then secretes insulin into the blood. Insulin increases glucose uptake in target cells. Some glucose is used by the cells but some is also converted to and stored in the form of glycogen. Glucose uptake by cells decreases blood glucose levels. This decrease is detected by the pancreas and in response, it stops secreting insulin in to the bloodstream. As insulin levels in the blood decrease, so does glucose uptake by cells.\nThis negative feedback therefore helps to maintain normal blood glucose levels and prevents extreme changes.\nThere are three main types of hormones. Steroid hormones are non-polar and do not need a receptor. The second type is peptide hormones. The third is Tyrosine derived hormones. An example is the T3 and T4 hormones produced by the thyroid gland.\nCounter-regulatory hormones.\nOften two hormones control the same product, one increasing and the other decreasing the target. Blood glucose is very important to an organism, and is controlled by more than one hormone. Other hormones also make the glucose level go up or down. If the glucose level gets too low, the body releases hormones that do the opposite of insulin. They do not tell the cells in the body to take up glucose from the blood. They tell the cells to put glucose back into the blood. These kind of hormones that work opposite of other hormones are called counter-regulatory hormones. Counter-regulatory hormones for insulin are glucagon and epinephrine.\nPositive feedback.\nMost important things in an organism are kept in homeostasis by negative feedback and counter-regulatory hormones. However a few things are controlled in different ways. One rare way is positive feedback. In negative feedback, the hormone's effect makes a gland stop making hormones. In positive feedback the opposite happens. The effect of the hormone tells the gland to make even more hormones.\nAn example of positive feedback is the hormone that causes childbirth (when babies are born.) The hormone that causes this is oxytocin. This hormone is made by the pituitary gland. When the baby starts coming out, it stretches the muscle in the cervix (the bottom of the uterus). Nerves in the cervix send a message to the pituitary. This message makes the pituitary release more oxytocin. The oxytocin then causes the muscles of the uterus to contract, or squeeze. This causes more stretching in the cervix. This stretching then tells the pituitary to make even more oxytocin. So levels of oxytocin keep rising until the squeezing or contractions of the uterus force the baby out.\nComparison with neurotransmitters.\nThere are clear distinctions between hormones and neurotransmitters:\nReceptors.\nMost hormones start a cellular response by binding to cell membranes or receptors inside the cell. A cell may have several different receptor types that recognize the same hormone but activate different signal transduction pathways, or a cell may have several different receptors that recognize different hormones and activate the same biochemical pathway.\nChemical classes.\nHormones are defined functionally, not structurally. They may have various chemical structures. Hormones occur in multicellular organisms (plants, animals, fungi, brown algae and red algae). These compounds occur also in unicellular organisms, and may act as signalling molecules,\nPeptide hormone.\nPeptide hormones are hormones with a short chain of amino acids."}

So men have much higher testosterone levels than women. The process takes place during the ages of puberty for both males and females\nTestosterone has two different kinds of effects. One effect is anabolic. This effect causes growth of muscle and bone. The other effect of testosterone is androgenic. These effects make the body look male.

It infects the small intestine.\nThere are many types (strains) of the \"Vibrio cholera\" bacteria. Some of them cause more serious illnesses than others. Because of this, some people who get cholera have no symptoms; others have symptoms that are not very bad, and others have very bad symptoms.\nThe most common symptom is large amounts of watery diarrhea. In the worst cases, diarrhea can be so bad that people can die in a few hours from dehydration.\nCholera is a very old disease. Writings about cholera (written in Sanskrit) have been found from the 5th century BC. Throughout history, there have been many outbreaks and epidemics of cholera.\nCholera still affects many people throughout the world. Estimates from 2010 say that between 3 million and 5 million people get cholera every year, and 58,000\u2013130,000 people die from the disease every year. Today, cholera is considered a pandemic. However, it is most common in developing countries, especially in children.\nCause.\nPeople usually get cholera by eating food or drinking water that is unclean. When people have cholera, they have a lot of diarrhea, and the cholera bacteria stays alive in their feces. In developing countries, often there is not good sanitation. Cholera can spread if this diarrhea gets into water that other people use. For example, if sewage (human waste) gets into a river, people can get cholera if they:\nCholera is very rarely spread directly from person to person.\nSigns and symptoms.\nCholera's main symptoms are bad diarrhea and vomiting clear fluid. These symptoms usually start suddenly. They start half a day to five days after the person gets infected. (This is called cholera's \"incubation period\".)\nIf they do not get treatment, about half of people with serious cholera die. People with bad cholera may have so much diarrhea that they do not have enough water and electrolytes (salts) left in their bodies to survive. Cholera has been nicknamed the \"blue death\" because a person dying of cholera may lose so many body fluids that their skin turns bluish-gray.\nOther symptoms may include:\nPrognosis.\nIf people with cholera get good, quick medical treatment, less than 1% die from the disease. However, if cholera is not treated, at least half of people with the disease (50% to 60%) die.\nSome strains of the \"Vibrio cholera\" bacteria have different genes than others, which make them more dangerous. These more dangerous strains of cholera bacteria caused the 2010 epidemic in Haiti and the 2004 outbreak in India. A person who gets these strains of cholera can die within two hours of getting sick. This means there is very little time to get the person treated.\nTreatment.\nThere are antibiotics for cholera. There are various treatments which can help. For example:\nPrevention.\nIndividuals.\nThere is a cholera vaccine that can be taken by mouth. It provides some protection from cholera for about six months.\nPeople can also do some other things to prevent cholera. For example:\nGovernments.\nGovernments could stop outbreaks or epidemics from happening by improving sanitation. For example, cholera is very uncommon in developed countries because they have good sanitation and because they add chemicals to their water to kill germs. Even after people start to get cholera, it is possible for governments to stop the disease from spreading, though:\nHistory.\nCholera probably started in the Indian subcontinent. As early as the 5th century BC, people in the Ganges River delta area wrote about cholera. The disease first spread to Russia in 1817 by trade routes (over both land and sea). Later, cholera spread to the rest of Europe, and from Europe to North America and the rest of the world.\nSeven cholera pandemics have happened in the past 200 years. The latest started in Indonesia in 1961. There have also been many serious outbreaks. The worst outbreak in recent history happened in Haiti after the earthquake there in 2010. Between October 2010 and August 2015, more than 700,000 Haitians got cholera, and over 9,000 died. The outbreak was caused by a United Nations base where Nepalese soldiers were living. The soldiers would dump human waste into the Artibonite River, which many Haitians used for drinking, cooking, and bathing.\nCholera was common in the 19th century. It has killed tens of millions of people. Just in Russia, between 1847 and 1851, more than one million people died of cholera. During the second pandemic, which lasted from 18271835, the disease killed 150,000 Americans. Between 1900 and 1920, in India, up to eight million people died of cholera.\nin 1854, an English doctor named John Snow was the first person to realize that contaminated water caused cholera. \nThe English engineer Joseph Bazalgette solved the problem for London in the middle of the 19th century. He invented the system for cleaning foul water, a system which is still used world-wide. Cholera has come back to the world because cities have hugely increased populations, and the treatment of sewage has overrun the facilities. It was the British who built most of the world's sewage plants, and until about 1950 they were able to work well unless they were damaged by warfare. Later governments did not invest money in their infrastructure, which meant the increased population eventually caused cholera to return.\nCholera is not the only problem with water supply. Blooms of red algae occur from time to time in hot weather, and they have to be killed off. Emergency control is got by adding chlorine to the water supply. This works, but makes the water rather distasteful.\nFortunately, infections transmitted in bad water can be cured. There is at least one antibiotic which works well against amoeboid parasites, and another which usually works against bacteria. Treatment costs money, of course, and in many countries that means the treatment is not widely available."}

Its first release was based on Red Hat Linux 5.1 and was released in July 1998. Mandriva Linux was originated by Ga\u00ebl Duval, and intended to focus on ease of use for new users.\nName changes.\nFrom its first release to version 8.0, Mandrake named its flagship distribution \"Linux-Mandrake\". From version 8.1 to 9.2 it was called \"Mandrake Linux\".\nIn February 2004, MandrakeSoft lost a court case for infringement. And it renamed its products. Starting from version 10.0, Mandrake Linux became known as \"Mandrakelinux\", and its logo changed accordingly. Similarly, MandrakeMove became Mandrakemove.\nIn April 2005, Mandrakesoft announced the corporate acquisition of Conectiva. As a result of this acquisition and the legal dispute with Hearst Corporation, Mandrakesoft announced that the company was changing its name to Mandriva, and that their Linux distribution \"Mandrake Linux\" would henceforward be known as Mandriva Linux.\nVersions.\nSince 2007, Mandriva is released on a 6-month fixed-release cycle, similar to Ubuntu and Fedora.

Here are two theories.\nThe belief-desire (want-think) theory.\nSome philosophers say that an action is caused by a person wanting something and thinking that by doing that action they can get it. For example, if I want an apple and think that by walking to a table with some apples on it I can get one, then I will walk to the table. It is important to have both a want (desire) and a thought about how to get it (belief).\nIf I think that by walking to a table with some apples on it I can get an apple, but want an orange and not an apple, then I will not walk to the table. If I want an apple, but think that the table across the room is just a picture of a table, then I will not walk to the table.\nThe neurological (brain) theory.\nOther philosophers say that the want-think theory is not true. They say that it is my brain and my nerves that causes an action. They see the brain as working like a computer that directs small electric packages from some nerves to other nerves and stores some for a while in memory. These packages cannot be named, they are just like computer bits and bytes. These philosophers say that we talk about what we want and what we think because the brain is very complicated and we do not understand it yet.\nThese questions form part of the philosophy of mind."}

The United States has many other small parties known as third parties.\nThe Republicans are often called \"the right\" or \"conservatives\". The Republican Party itself is also known as the GOP, which stands for \"Grand Old Party\". The symbol of the Republican party is the elephant. This symbol was first used in 1874 in a political cartoon by Thomas Nast.\nThe Republican National Committee, or \"RNC\", is the main organization for the Republican Party in all 50 states.The Republican Party is not the same political party as the Democratic-Republican Party. A state where most voters vote for Republican politicians is sometimes called a \"red state\".\nHistory.\nThe Republican Party was founded in Ripon, Wisconsin in 1853, with the help of Francis Preston Blair. The Republican Party was formed by people who did not like the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, which would let each territory allow slavery. The Republican Party was founded by past members of the Free Soil Party and the Whig Party who wanted to stop the expansion of slavery. The founders of the Republican Party wanted to stop the expansion of slavery because they believed it was against the ideals of the Constitution and Declaration of Independence. Some founders of the Republican Party wanted to abolish slavery everywhere in the United States. The Republican Party's first candidate for President of the United States was John C. Fr\u00e9mont in 1856.\nAs the Whig Party collapsed, the Republicans became one of two major political parties in the United States (the Democratic Party was the other major political party). In 1860 Abraham Lincoln, the first Republican president, was elected. For the rest of the second half of the 19th century, the country had mostly Republican presidents. From 1860 until 1912 the Republicans lost the presidential election just twice (non-consecutively to Democrat Grover Cleveland in 1884 and 1892).\nRepublicans believed in protectionism (the belief that raising taxes on trades with other countries would protect the economy) during the second half of the 19th century and during the early half of the 20th century.\nAfter World War I, the 1920's had three Republican presidents: Warren Harding, Calvin Coolidge, and Herbert Hoover. It was called the Republican Decade for that reason. Harding and Coolidge made a plan for the economy which lowered taxes, made the government spend less money, and got rid of rules and laws that affected the economy.\nNear the end of the 1920s, the stock market crashed and the Great Depression began. During the Great Depression, the Republican Party became less popular. No Republicans were president between 1933 and 1953, when Dwight Eisenhower began his first of two consecutive terms as president. (He was re-elected in 1956.) Richard Nixon lost the election in 1960, but was elected president on the Republican ticket in 1968 and again in 1972.\nRonald Reagan, an actor and conservative political activist, was elected as president in 1980. Ronald Reagan became the first Republican president who was a former member of the Democratic Party. Ronald Reagan served two terms and his successor George H.W. Bush served one term. Reagan wanted fewer laws to affect the economy, and wanted the military to be stronger.\nBill Clinton (a Democrat) was elected president in 1992, and re-elected in 1996. However, a new Congress was elected in 1994, and Republicans gained control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate. They voted against many of Clinton's ideas and proposed ideas of their own such as a line item veto and a balanced budget amendment.\nAfter elections held in 2006, Republicans lost control of Congress. Democrat Barack Obama was elected in 2008 and re-elected in 2012. Republican John Boehner was elected the Speaker of the House of Representatives in 2010 and re-elected in 2012. In 2014, Republicans gained control of the senate and the house. Boehner resigned in early October 2015 and was eventually succeeded by Paul Ryan of Wisconsin on October 29, 2015. On November 9, 2016, Donald Trump was elected president, defeating Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Electoral College. Trump was the first Republican to take office as president since January 20, 2001, when George W. Bush was inaugurated. The Republicans lost the House and won the Senate in 2018. Paul Ryan retired in 2019 and was succeeded by Nancy Pelosi, who is a member of the Democratic Party.\nCurrent Republican beliefs.\nCurrently, the Republican Party is identified by classical liberalism, conservatism, and right-wing policies.\nNot all Republicans believe in the same things, but generally these are the things many Republicans support:\nMost supporters for the Republican Party come from states in the Southern, Deep South, parts of the Midwest, and the rural Northeast areas of the USA, as well as from Montana; though they come from all over the United States, including the northern portion of California.\nU.S. Presidents.\nRepublican Presidents in the 19th Century\nRepublican Presidents in the 20th Century\nRepublican Presidents in the 21st Century"}

It is felt by the tongue while eating, and is used to sense the flavor of food that is in the mouth. Humans can sense five tastes: sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami.\nHumans have taste receptors on taste buds and other areas including the upper surface of the tongue and the epiglottis. The perception of taste is organised by a special part of the cerebral cortex. The gustatory cortex is responsible for the perception of taste.\nBasic tastes.\nBitterness.\nMany common foods are bitter, like coffee, bitter melon, olives and citrus peel.\nBitterness is of interest to those who study evolution, as well as various health researchers. Many naturally bitter compounds are toxic. The ability to detect bitter-tasting, toxic compounds at low thresholds may have a protective function, but some test have not confirmed this. Plant leaves often contain toxic compounds, and among leaf-eating primates there is a tendency to prefer immature leaves. Young leaves tend to be higher in protein and lower in fiber and poisons than mature leaves. Amongst humans, various food processing techniques are used worldwide to detoxify otherwise inedible foods and make them palatable.\nAnimals which eat a lot of bitter plant material, such as browsers do have ways of dealing with it. They produce tannin-binding proteins, which other animals do not. Tannins are bitter compounds common in material from trees and bushes, though not grass.\nSaltiness.\nSaltiness is felt when there is sodium in the food. A common spice that is salty is common salt, sodium chloride.\nSavouriness.\nSavouriness (or savoriness) is the taste of savoury foods. It is also known by the Japanese word , and comes from umai, which means 'yummy'. This taste was known for a long time, but only became an official scientific term in 1985.\nTo taste savoriness, your tongue has special parts that detect amino acids that are in foods like meats and cheeses.\nSourness.\nSourness is tasted when acids are on your tongue. Many foods have acid in them and are sour, like lemons and vinegar.\nSweetness.\nSweetness is a taste felt when sugars are in the food. Most people consider sweetness to be a pleasant taste.\nTaste-related.\nSpicy/hot.\nThis sensation is not a special sense of taste because it does not have specific taste buds. It is a complex sensation.\nSubstances such as ethanol and capsaicin cause a burning sensation called chemesthesis, piquance, spiciness, hotness, or prickliness. Two main sources of this sensation are capsaicin from chili peppers and piperine from black pepper.\nFoods like chili peppers activate nerve fibers directly giving the sensation of \"hot\". Many parts of the body with exposed membranes but no taste sensors (such as the nasal cavity, under the fingernails, surface of the eye (cornea) or a wound) produce a similar sensation of heat when exposed to such chemicals.\nOther sensations.\nThe tongue can also feel other sensations not generally included in the basic tastes. These are largely detected by the somatosensory system.\nAlso, it is known that smell and sight contribute to the overall sensation of eating and drinking. The temperature of food makes a difference to its appreciation.\nThe strange coolness of spearmint, menthol and camphor is caused by their molecules triggering a sensory system which normally works to sense low temperatures.\nThere is still much to learn about the taste system. Consider, for example, the tastes of ginger and horseradish."}

It can be called the sense of body or the sense of touch. The system also has internal sensory receptors, and includes sensing temperature and pain. There is a special area in the brain used to processing input of touch. It is in the parietal lobe of the cerebral cortex.\nAn animal knows if something is against a part of its body. This is called the sense of touch. The process of touching something may be called feeling.\nTiny touch sense organs under the skin help animals feel hardness, softness, and sharpness, for example. Animals also have sense organs which feel temperature and pain. Some parts of the body, such as fingertips have many more sense organs than others.\nWhen animals touch things, nerve fibres attached to the sense organ sends messages to the brain through the central nervous system. The brain interprets the messages, and animals feel things.\nTouch as communication.\nHumans, and mammals in general, often touch each other. Touch is a kind of non-verbal communication. Behaviours based on touch are very important for keeping family and group members together ('bonding'). It is part of the 'glue' of their social life. Monkeys grooming each other's fur is a good example."}
{"id": "13409", "revid": "70336", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13409", "title": "Classical mechanics", "text": "Classical mechanics is the part of physics that describes how everyday things move and how their motion changes because of forces. If we know how things are moving now, classical mechanics allows us to predict how they will move in the future and how they were moving in the past. We can use classical mechanics to predict how things like planets and rockets move.\nThere are two parts of mechanics. The two parts are classical mechanics and quantum mechanics. Classical mechanics is used most of the time for most of the things we can see, and that are not moving too fast. When the things are too small, classical mechanics is not good. Then we need to use quantum mechanics.\nNewton's Three Laws.\nNewton's three laws of motion are important to classical mechanics. Isaac Newton discovered them. Newton's laws tell us how forces change how things move, but they do not say what causes the forces.\nThe \"first law\" says that if there is no external force (a push or pull), things that are not moving will stay not-moving, and things that are moving will keep moving in the same way. Before, people thought that things would slow down and stop moving even if there was no force making them stop. Newton said this was wrong. Often, people say, \"Objects that are not moving tend to stay not-moving, and objects that are moving tend to stay moving, unless acted upon by an outside force, such as gravity, friction, etc...\"\nThe \"second law\" says how much a force changes how a thing moves. When there is a net outside force on an object, its velocity (speed and direction of motion) will change. How fast the velocity changes is called the acceleration. Newton's second law says that bigger forces produce more acceleration. But objects with a lot of stuff in them (mass) are harder to push, so they do not accelerate as much. Another way of saying this is that the net force on an object equals the rate of change of its momentum. The momentum measures how much mass is in a thing, how fast it is going, and which direction it is going. So forces change the momentum, but how much they can change the speed and direction of motion still depends on mass.\nThe \"third law\" says that if one thing puts a force on another thing, the second thing also puts a force on the first thing. The second force is equal in size to the first force. The forces act in opposite directions. For example, if you jump forward off a boat, the boat moves backward. For you to jump forward, the boat had to push you forward. Newton's third law says that for the boat to push you forward, you had to push the boat backward. Often, people say, \"For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.\"\nKinematic Equations.\nIn physics, kinematics is the part of classical mechanics that explains the movement of objects without looking at what causes the movement or what the movement affects.\n1-Dimensional Kinematics.\n1-Dimensional (1D) Kinematics are used only when an object moves in one direction: either side to side (left to right) or up and down. There are equations with can be used to solve problems that have movement in only 1 dimension or direction. These equations come from the definitions of velocity, acceleration and distance.\n2-Dimensional Kinematics.\n2-Dimensional kinematics is used when motion happens in both the x-direction (left to right) and the y-direction (up and down). There are also equations for this type of kinematics. However, there are different equations for the x-direction and different equations for the y-direction. Galileo proved that the velocity in the x-direction does not change through the whole run. However, the y-direction is affected by the force of gravity, so the y-velocity does change during the run."}

Each moai is made out of one large stone but some have an extra stone on top of the head. Most were made from the volcanic rock in the Rano Raraku area of the island. Moai are sometimes called \"heads\" but they do have shoulders, arms, and a body but these are usually too small for the head, also some of the best known ones had been partly buried over the years and only the heads were showing. Most moai are between 2.5 and 10 metres high and, usually, weigh 14 tonnes. There are about 1000 moai placed mainly around the coast of the island plus nearly 400 more which were left not yet finished at Rano Raraku.\nWhen, why, and how they were made is still a mystery today. It is believed that they were made almost 1000 years ago by Polynesians, who lived there at the time and were made to honour their ancestors (older family members long dead) and bring good luck. Making the statues would have needed a lot of time and effort. To move them, they may have used wooden sledges or rollers or even \"walked\" them by rocking the moai along. The youngest moai found was built around 1350. It is believed that, around that time, there began a time of cold weather, little food, and war between the peoples. By the 19th century, all the moai had been pushed over. Today, some have been restored."}

He had a simple life-style and behaviour. This gave him a basis to criticize the social values and institutions of the corrupt, confused society he saw around him.\nDiogenes made a virtue of poverty. He begged for a living and often slept in a large ceramic jar in the marketplace. He became notorious for his philosophical stunts. He used to carry a lamp during the day, and claimed he was looking for an honest man.\nHe criticized Plato, disputed his interpretation of Socrates. He sabotaged Plato's lectures, distracting attenders by bringing food and eating during the discussions. Diogenes was also noted for having publicly mocked Alexander the Great.\nDiogenes helped Antisthenes create cynicism, a philosophy that focuses on living a simple life without the need for money, fame, power, or possessions. He also made a notion of \"cosmopolitan\" on world citizenship first time in history.\nDiogenes was captured by pirates and sold into slavery. Eventually he settled in Corinth. There he explained cynicism to Crates, who taught it to Zeno of Citium. Zeno worked on stoicism, which became one of the main schools of Greek philosophy.\nNone of Diogenes' writings have survived, but there are some details of his life from anecdotes. The anecdotes come from Diogenes La\u00ebrtius' book \"Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers\" and some other sources."}

An important part of the adaptive immune system is that it is much stronger when fighting a disease that it has already fought against before. Vaccination involves showing the immune system something which looks very similar to a particular virus or bacteria, which helps the immune system be stronger when it is fighting against the real infection.\nVaccination versus Immunization.\nAnother word used for vaccines is immunization. These words mean things that are a little different. Vaccination is when a person is \"given\" something to make the immune system learn to fight an infectious disease.\nImmunization is when a person's immune system learns to fight an infection. Immunization can happen from vaccination. But immunization can also happen from getting the \"infection\". For example, a person can be immune to hepatitis B if he gets sick with hepatitis B. After a person gets hepatitis B and then gets well, he is immunized from getting it again. A person can also be immunized from hepatitis B by taking the hepatitis B vaccination.\nSo vaccination and immunization have meanings that are a little different. But when people say these words, they usually mean the same thing. People say immunization to mean the same thing as vaccination.\nHerd Immunity.\nHerd immunity is an important part of how vaccines work. A herd is a group of animals. Herd immunity happens when most of the animals in a group are immune to an infection. If most animals are immune they cannot get the disease. If they do not get the disease, they cannot give it to other animals. So even one animal who is not immune is safer. If none of the other animals in a herd get the infection, they cannot give the infection to the one who is non immune.\nThis is important in people too. If 95% of people in a place are immune to a disease, the other 5% are safer. They are not near infected people, so they won't get infected.\nThe people who are in the 5% are there for many reasons. Some got the vaccine but did not react to it. Their immune system did not learn how to fight it well. Some of them are too sick to get the vaccine. It can be children who are too sick with other diseases to get vaccines. It can be a pregnant woman who cannot get the vaccine because it could hurt her baby. It can be a person with cancer who does not have a strong immune system. It can be an older person who has a weak immune system.\nSo if everyone in a place gets vaccinated, it protects these people too. If they are not protected by \"herd immunity\", they can get more sick from an infection. They get the infection more easily and they get sicker from it. So it is important that people who are healthy get their vaccinations. It protects the healthy people. But it also is important to protect other people who are old, weak, or sick.\nTypes of vaccines.\nThere are different types of vaccines:\nThere are various other methods. All aim to develop the immune response without allowing the full viral infection to happen.\nSafety of vaccination.\nToday in modern countries almost all people are vaccinated, which has caused many serious diseases to become rare. However, some people argue against vaccination, as they are worried about possible side effects from the vaccination.\nVaccinations do have some side effects. These include swelling and redness around the injection site, a sore arm, or fever. These effects are because of the immune system fighting with the viruses or bacteria which have been injected. Very rarely, the immune system overreacts so much to the virus that the immune system damages other areas in the body.\nAs well as these real side effects of vaccinations, some people believe that vaccines cause other serious problems like autism, brain damage, or diabetes. There is no evidence for this. Almost all doctors and scientists believe that vaccination does not cause any of these things.\nOverall, the vast majority of medical professionals and scientists believe that vaccinations are a good thing and that the benefits of avoiding diseases are far greater than the very small risk of side effects. All medical organizations around the world, including the World Health Organization(WHO), the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the United States Centers for Disease Control support vaccination.\nOrigin.\nThe word \"vaccine\" was created by Edward Jenner. The word comes from the Latin word \"vacca\", meaning cow. A virus that mainly affects cows (Cowpox) was used in the first scientific demonstration that giving a person one virus could protect against a related and more dangerous one.\nHistory of vaccination.\nThe first vaccination ever was for smallpox. In 1796 an English doctor, Edward Jenner, noticed something. He saw that people who got cowpox did not get sick from smallpox. He gave a young boy the cowpox virus to protect him from smallpox. This was done by scratching liquid from cowpox sores into the boy's skin. This same method using the liquid from sores was also used to give people smallpox. People did this so they might get smallpox on \"one place\" on their bodies. Then they could \"pick\" which body part got scars from smallpox. But sometimes people who did this got very sick from smallpox. Some even died. This was a dangerous thing to do. But people did it because it was less dangerous than getting smallpox.\nEdward Jenner gave the boy cowpox in the same way people tried to give smallpox. Six weeks later, he scratched smallpox into the boy's skin. The boy did not get sick from smallpox. This boy was the first person ever to get a vaccination.\nIt was not until almost 100 years after the smallpox vaccination that the next vaccine for cholera was found in 1879. After that, vaccines for 28 different types of diseases have been found."}

In their capacity as the deputy head of government, the Vice President is also the President of the Senate who is the presiding officer of the US Senate - the upper house of the U.S legislature. This position is first in line to succeed as President if the current President resigns, dies or is removed from office.\nSelection and election.\nOriginally, the Vice President was the person who got the second most electoral votes in the presidential election. This worked well until Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr tied in the . After that the 12th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution said that the President and Vice President are elected separately, and if they tie they would be chosen by the Senate.\nSoon after that, political parties began running the President and Vice President on one platform. As such, the Vice Presidential candidates are usually chosen by the leadership of a political party, with a strong influence by that party's presidential candidate. The Vice President and President are usually from the same political party (for example, Barack Obama and Joe Biden were both Democrats, and George W. Bush and Dick Cheney were both Republicans).\nDuties.\nThe Vice President only has one official duty. That is to preside over the Senate and to cast a vote in the Senate if there is a tie. However, recently the duties have been seen to include being a member of the President's Cabinet, or a top advisor to the President (Dick Cheney was the Vice President to take this duty the most seriously). The Vice President is a member of the National Security Council and serves on the board of the Smithsonian. Also, the 25th Amendment says that the Vice President can act as President if the President is incapacitated (can not do the job of President). For example, Vice President George H.W. Bush acted as President when Ronald Reagan was having an operation.\nIf the Vice President dies or becomes President.\nBefore 1967, if the President died, it was unclear whether the Vice President was President or merely Acting President. However, John Tyler and others who took over the office said they were not merely Acting President. Also, if the Vice President died, nobody was Vice President until a new one was elected.\nThis uncertainty was corrected after the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Under the 25th Amendment to the United States Constitution, if the President dies, the Vice President automatically becomes the President. If the Vice President dies, resigns, or becomes President, the President can appoint a new Vice President. The appointment needs to be confirmed by a majority vote of both the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. This has happened twice. Gerald Ford became Vice President after the resignation of Spiro Agnew, and Nelson Rockefeller became Vice President when Gerald Ford became President after Richard Nixon resigned.\nVice presidents who became President.\nThe following vice presidents either became president after the death or resignation of the president, or were elected in their own right:"}

It is on the left side of the body in humans and is about the size of a fist. It pumps blood throughout the body. It has regular contractions, or when the heart squeezes the blood out into other parts of the body. \n\"Cardiac\" and \"cardio\" both mean \"about the heart\", so if something has the prefix \"cardio\" or \"cardiac\", it has something to do with the heart.\nMyocardium means the heart muscle: 'myo' is from the Greek word for muscle - 'mys', cardium is from the Greek word for heart - 'kardia'.\nStructure.\nThe human heart has four chambers or closed spaces. Some animals have only two or three chambers.\nIn humans, the four chambers are two \"atria\" and two \"ventricles\". Atria is talking about two chambers; atrium is talking about one chamber. There is a right atrium and right ventricle. These get blood that comes to the heart. They pump this blood to the lungs. In the lungs blood picks up oxygen and drops carbon dioxide. Blood from the lungs goes to the left atrium and ventricle. The left atrium and ventricle send the blood out to the body. The left ventricle works six times harder than the right ventricle because it carries oxygenated blood. \nBlood is carried in blood vessels. These are arteries and veins. Blood going to the heart is carried in veins. Blood going away from the heart is carried in arteries. The main artery going out of the right ventricle is the \"pulmonary artery\". (Pulmonary means about lungs.) The main artery going out of the left ventricle is the \"aorta\".\nThe veins going into the right atrium are the \"superior vena cava\" and \"inferior vena cava\". These bring blood from the body to the right heart. The veins going into the left atrium are the \"pulmonary veins\". These bring blood from the lungs to the left heart.\nWhen the blood goes from the atria to the ventricles it goes through heart \"valves\". When blood goes out of the ventricles it goes through valves. The valves make sure that blood only goes one way in or out.\nThe four valves of the heart are:\nThe heart has three layers. The outer covering is the pericardium. This is a tough sack that surrounds the heart. The middle layer is the myocardium. This is the heart muscle. The inner layer is the endocardium. This is the thin smooth lining of the chambers of the heart.\nCardiac cycle.\nA \"heart beat\" is when the heart muscle \"contracts\". This means the heart pushes in and this makes the chambers smaller. This pushes blood out of the heart and into the blood vessels. After the heart contracts and pushes in, the muscle \"relaxes\" or stops pushing in. The chambers get bigger and blood coming back to the heart fills them.\nWhen the heart muscle contracts (pushes in) it is called \"systole\". When the heart muscle relaxes (stops pushing in), this is called \"diastole\". Both atria do systole together. Both ventricles do systole together. But the atria do systole \"before\" the ventricles. Even though the \"atrial systole\" comes before \"ventricular systole\", all four chambers do diastole at the same time. This is called \"cardiac diastole\"\nThe order is: atrial systole \u2192 ventricular systole \u2192 cardiac diastole. When this happens one time, it is called a \"cardiac cycle\".\nHeart's pacemaker.\nSystole (when the heart squeezes) happens because the muscle cells of the heart gets smaller in size. When they get smaller we also say they \"contract\". Electricity going through the heart makes the cells contract. The electricity starts in the \"sino-atrial node\" (acronym SA Node) The SA Node is a group of cells called pacemaker cells in the right atria. These cells start an \"electrical impulse\". This electrical impulse sets the rate and timing at which all cardiac muscle cells contract. This motion is called 'atrial systole'. Once electrical impulse goes through the \"atrio-ventricular node\" (AV Node). The AV Node makes the impulse slow down. Slowing down makes the electrical impulses get to the ventricles later. That is what makes the ventricular systole occur \"after\" atrial systole, and lets all the blood leave the atria before ventricle contracts (\"meaning squeeze\"). \nAfter the electrical impulse goes through the AV Node, the electrical impulse will go through the \"conduction system\" of the ventricle. Conduction means heat or electricity traveling through something. This brings the electrical impulse to the ventricles. The first part of the conduction system is the \"bundle of His\". \"His\" is named for the doctor (Wilhelm His, Jr) who discovered it. Bundle means strings or wires grouped together in parallel. Once the bundle (\"meaning a group of strings or wires going in parallel directions\") goes through the ventricle muscle, it divides into two \"bundle branches\", the left bundle branch and the right bundle branch. The left bundle branch travels to the left ventricle and the right bundle branch travels to the right ventricle. At the end of the bundle branches, the electrical impulse goes into the ventricular muscle through the Purkinje Fibers. This is what makes ventricle contraction take place and makes ventricular systole.\nThe order is:\nSino-Atrial Node \u2192 Atria (systole) \u2192 Atrio-Ventricular Node \u2192 Bundle of His \u2192 Bundle branches \u2192 Purkinje Fibers \u2192 Ventricles (systole)\nECG.\nECG is an acronym for ElectroCardioGram. It is also written EKG for ElectroKardioGram in German. The ECG shows what the electricity in the heart is doing. An ECG is done by putting electrodes on a person's skin. The electrodes see the electricity going through the heart. This is written on paper by a machine. This writing on the paper is the ECG.\nDoctors learn about the person's heart by looking at the ECG. The ECG shows some diseases of the heart like heart attacks or problems with the \"rhythm\" of the heart (how the electricity goes through the heart's conduction system.)\nThe ECG shows atrial systole. This is called a P-wave. Then ventricular systole happens. This is called the QRS or QRS-complex. It is called a complex because there are three different waves in it. The Q-wave, R-wave, and S-wave. Then the ECG shows ventricular diastole. This is called the T-wave. Atrial diastole happens then too. But it is not seen separate from ventricular diastole.\nThe PR-Interval is the space between atrial systole (P) and ventricular systole (QRS). The QT-Interval is from when the QRS starts to when the T ends. The ST-segment is the space between the QRS and T."}

Congenital heart disease includes a large number of conditions. The formation of the heart before birth is very complex and is sometimes abnormal. For example, if a part of the main artery that comes from the heart is narrowed, that is called coarctation of the aorta. There may be holes inside the heart which keep the blood from flowing normally inside the heart. Other congenital heart problems are caused by abnormal heart valves. In some cases, congenital heart problems are discovered at birth. Other times the problems may not be detected until the person is older."}

Manitoba and Saskatchewan are provinces - part of Canada. Montana, South Dakota, and Minnesota are other states in the United States.\nWeather.\nNorth Dakota is not close to any big bodies of water (oceans or seas). Because of this, temperatures in North Dakota are \"very\" hot in the summer and \"very\" cold in the winter. In the summer, there are sometimes \"strong\" thunderstorms. These storms can have tornadoes and hail.\nHistory.\nBefore European people came, Native American people lived in the area now called North Dakota.

On November 2, 1889, North Dakota (and South Dakota) became part of the United States.\nEconomy.\nMost of the economy is based on agriculture. The most important agricultural crops are durum, a type of wheat, which is grown all across the state. In the Red River Valley, there is more rain, and maize (corn) and sugar beets are grown as well. In the Badlands, there is less rain, and more cattle are raised than crops.\nNorth Dakota has the only bank in the United States that is \"owned\" by the state.

It refers to the a community of people who are not heterosexual or cisgender. The initialism has been taken up by many sexuality and gender identity-related community centers.\nHistory.\nBefore the \"sexual revolution\" of the 1960s, there was no neutral word or group of words for people who were not heterosexual. \nThe word \"homosexual\" started being used in America to describe sexual orientations that were not heterosexual. However, this word began to have bad connotations, as many people thought that it sounded like a condition or mental illness, and therefore the word \"homophile\" was used instead. After that, the word \"gay\" replaced the word \"homophile\" in the 1970s.\nAs lesbians became more public about their sexuality in the 1970s, the group of words \"gay and lesbian\" was often used, and a phase of lesbian feminism started. This meant that certain lesbian feminist groups separated because did not have knowledge of if they should put feminism or gay rights first.\nLesbian feminists viewed the separation between \"butch\" and \"femme\" in mainstream gay (male) culture of the time in the same way that they viewed the separation in society over gender roles between men and women. They saw these ideas as patriarchal and did not want to join the mainstream gay rights movement because of what they saw as the chauvinism of gay men, and refused to take up their cause. Many lesbians who were not lesbian feminists saw this as not giving help to the gay rights movement.\nThis was followed by many bisexual and transgender people wanting to be seen as respected groups in the LGBT community. Before gender reassignment surgery was massively improved in later years, transgender people had a hard time being accepted. Still, they fought for their rights, and were greatly boosted when plastic surgery and hormone surgery helped them to be accepted as the gender they identify with. \nAfter the Stonewall riots, there was a change in points of view among the gay and lesbian community. Many gays and lesbians became less accepting of bisexual and transgender persons in general. Many gays and lesbians thought that transgender people were acting out stereotypes and that bisexuals were actually gay, but in too much fear to \"come out of the closet\". This separation still exists today, and it only became common to speak of all members of the LGBT community with equal respect in the trouble for LGBT rights in the late 1990s.\nAcceptance of LGBT people.\nSome people who are LGBT may not \"come out\", as they may be a target of discrimination or prejudice, such as homophobia or transphobia. Many countries have discriminatory laws against LGBT people, some even giving out the death penalty for being gay or bisexual.\nDifferent forms of the acronym.\nShortening of the term.\nWhen not including transgender persons in general, the acronym is sometimes shortened to just \"LGB\".\nOther letters.\nMany other letters are added to the acronym, so much so that it has been described as an \"alphabet soup\" by some. A few of the other letters added are:\nNot everyone is in agreement what should or should not be covered in the acronym, or which order the letters should go in.\nDifferent terms.\nThe group of words gender and sexual diversity (GSD) has been shown as a different option to LGBT by some, as it is seen as more inclusive and less limiting.\nSGL (same-gender loving) is sometimes used among gay male African Americans as a way of distinguishing themselves from what they think of as white LGBT groups of persons.\nMSM (men who have sex with men) is used to describe men who have sex with other men without having relation to their sexual orientation, often in a medical context.\nWSW (women who have sex with women) is the opposite of MSM.

It was much bigger than the nation of Greece we know today. The civilization of Greece, thrived from the archaic period of the 8th/6th centuries BC to 146 BC. The period ended with the Roman conquest of Greece in the Battle of Corinth.\nFor most of this time, the Greeks did not have a single government or ruler. They did, however, have a common language and culture. The Greek language is an Indo-European language.\nThere were many city states, each with its own constitution. Athens, Sparta and Corinth were powerful city-states. Some had kings, and some, like Athens, had a form of democracy. As time went on, the most-powerful cities collected other cities into groups known as \"leagues\". This applied to many of the Greek colonies in Asia Minor, most of which had close ties to one or another of the three big cities.\nIn the middle of this period, there was Classical Greece, which flourished during the 5th to 4th centuries BC. Athenian leadership successfully repelled the threat of Persian invasion in the Greco-Persian Wars. The Athenian golden age ended with the defeat of Athens at the hands of Sparta in the Peloponnesian War in 345 BC.\nIn the last, Hellenistic, period, Greece was unified by the conquests of Alexander the Great. The city-states continued, under the overall influence of Macedonia.\nGreek culture had a powerful influence on the Roman Empire, which carried a version of it to many parts of the Mediterranean region and Europe. In this way, classical Greece was part of the foundation of Western civilization. Greek was also the language, and partly the culture, of the Byzantine Empire.\nTimeline of Greek History.\nThe history of Greece went through these stages:\nEarly history.\nLiteracy.\nIn the 8th century B.C., the Greeks learned how to read and write a second time. They had lost literacy at the end of the Mycenaean culture, as the Mediterranean world fell into the Dark Ages. The Greek Dark Ages (~1100 BC\u2013750 BC), or Bronze Age collapse, is a period in the history of Ancient Greece and Anatolia from which there are no written records, and few archaeological remains.\nThe Greeks learned about the alphabet from another ancient people, the Phoenicians. They made some adjustments to it. In particular, the Greeks introduced regular letters for vowels, which was necessary for their language. Their alphabet was, in turn, copied by the Romans, and much of the world now uses the Roman alphabet.\nPolitical structure.\nAncient Greece had one language and culture but was not unified until 337 BC, when Macedonia defeated Athens and Thebes. That marked the end of the Classic period and the start of the Hellenistic period. Even then, the conquered cities were merely joined to Philip II of Macedon's Corinthian League; they were not occupied and ruled themselves.\nCity states in Ancient Greece.\nAncient Greece consisted of several hundred more-or-less independent city states. This was different from other societies, which were tribal, or kingdoms ruling over relatively large territories.\nUndoubtedly the geography of Greece\u2014divided and sub-divided by hills, mountains and rivers\u2014contributed to the nature of ancient Greece. On the one hand, the ancient Greeks had no doubt that they were 'one people'; they had the same religion, same basic culture, and same language. Yet each city-state or \"polis\" was independent; unification was something rarely discussed by the ancient Greeks. Even when, during the second Persian invasion of Greece, a group of city-states allied themselves to defend Greece, most \"poleis\" remained neutral, and after the Persian defeat, the allies quickly returned to infighting.\nThe major features of the Ancient Greek political system were: \nLater, in the Classical period, the leagues were fewer and larger, and dominated by one city (particularly Athens, Sparta and Thebes). Often cities would be compelled to join under threat of war (or as part of a peace treaty). After Philip II of Macedon 'conquered' the heartlands of ancient Greece, he did not attempt to annex the territory or unify it into a new province. However, he did force most of the cities to join his own Corinthian League.\nKingdoms.\nSome cities were democratic, some were aristocratic, and some were monarchies. Some had many revolutions in which one kind of government replaced another. One famous Greek kingdom is Macedon, which became briefly the largest empire the world had seen at the time by conquering the Persian empire (including ancient Egypt) and reaching into modern-day India. Other famous kingdoms are Epirus and Thessaly.\nMonarchies in ancient Greece were not absolute because there was usually a council of older citizens (\"the senate\", or in Macedonia \"the congress\") who gave advice to the King. These men were not elected or chosen in a lottery like they were in the democratic city-states.\nCitizens.\nCitizens that could participate in government in Ancient Greece were usually men who were free-born in that city. Women, slaves and (usually) residents born elsewhere, did not have the right to vote. Details differed between cities. Athens is an example: The residents of Athens were of three groups: citizens, metics (resident aliens) and slaves. Citizens were residents whose forebears had been Athenians for three generations. Male citizens had the rights of free men and could be chosen to fulfill any official state position. \"Of the estimated 150,000 residents of the city-state of Attica, only about one fifth held the privilege of citizenship\". Women who were citizens in Athens could not participate in political offices, but in Sparta they could.\nColonies.\nThe number of Greeks grew and soon they could not grow enough food for all the people. When this happened, a city would send people off to start a new city, known as a colony.\nBecause the terrain was rough, most travel was by sea. For this reason, many new cities were established along the coastline. First new cities were started in Anatolia (Asia Minor) and later along the Black Sea, in Cyprus, in southern Italy, in Sicily, and around what today is Benghazi in Libya. They even started a city, Naucratis, on the river Nile in Egypt. The cities of today, Syracuse, Naples, Marseille and Istanbul started as the Greek cities Syracusa, Neapolis, Massilia and Byzantium.\nThe big four.\nBy the 6th century BC some cities became much more important than the others. They were Corinth, Thebes, Sparta, and Athens.\nThe Spartans were very well-disciplined soldiers. They defeated the people who lived near them and those people had to farm the land for the Spartans. These \"helots\" had to give the Spartans part of the food they grew and so the Spartans did not have to work. Instead, they learned how to be better soldiers. There were not many Spartans but there were many helots. Spartan military strength controlled the helots. The Spartans had two hereditary kings who led them in war. At home they were also ruled by a group of old men called the Gerousia (the Senate).\nAthens became a democracy in 510 BC. The men came to a place in the center of the city and decided what to do. It was the first place in the world where the people decided what their country should do. They would talk and then vote on what to do at the Boule (the parliament). But the women did not vote. Athens had slaves. These slaves were owned by their masters and could be sold to someone else. The Athenian slaves were less free than the Spartan helots. Every year, Athenian citizens elected eight generals who led them in war.\nGreco-Persian Wars.\nIn 499 BC, the Greek cities in Anatolia rebelled. They did not want Persia to rule them anymore. Athens sent 20 ships to fight the Persians on the sea. The Greeks in Anatolia were defeated. The Persian King, Darius decided to punish Athens. He sent soldiers and ships to fight Athens.\nAthens asked for help from Sparta. Sparta wanted to help but could not; they had a religious festival at that time. Athens sent her soldiers against the Persian soldiers: at the Battle of Marathon (490 BC) they defeated the Persians. Then the help from Sparta came.\nAt the Battle of Thermopylae The Spartans were led by Leonidas, and resisted the huge Persian army. After a couple of days, a traitor called Ephialtes led the Persians around the pass behind the Greek army. Realizing that defeat was inevitable, Leonidas released many of his men. Those who stayed knew it would be a fight to the death. Leonides kept elite \"hoplites\" (foot soldiers) who had living sons at home. There were also allied Thespians and Thebans who volunteered to stay.\nOn the third day, Leonidas led his 300 Spartan hoplites and their allies against Xerxes and his mighty army. The Spartan-led forces fought this Persian force to their deaths in order to block the pass long enough to keep Xerxes and his army occupied while the rest of the Greek army escaped.\nAfter Thermopylae, many Greeks wanted to go south to the Peloponnese. Because the Isthmus of Corinth, the way into the Peloponnese, is very narrow, many wanted to fight the Persians there.\nAthens was north of Corinth and she had a navy. Athens' leader Themistocles wanted to fight the Persians by the island of Salamis. Xerxes decided to send his fleet against the Greek fleet before the Greek ships could go to the Peloponnese. The Greek fleet defeated the Persians at the Battle of Salamis. Xerxes then went home with many of his soldiers but a Persian army stayed in Greece. This army was defeated at the Battle of Platea in 479 BC.\nAthens against Sparta.\nAfter the Persians were defeated at Platea, the Spartans did very little. However, Persia was still dangerous. Athens asked the Greek cities on the islands in the Aegean and in Anatolia to join her. The cities agreed because they were afraid of Persia. These cities formed the Delian League and Athens was their leader. Many of the cities of the Delian League had to pay Athens tribute money. Athens used the money to build many ships and the Parthenon. Sparta was still strong on land, but Athens was stronger on the sea. Several times there was war between Athens and Sparta. Then Athens decided to send many ships to Sicily to fight against the city Syracuse. Sparta sent help to Syracuse, and Athens was defeated. None of the Athenian ships came back.\nNow Sparta wanted to build ships to fight Athens. It took a long time for Sparta to defeat Athens, but then at the Battle of Aegospotami, the Spartans destroyed most of Athens's ships. The Athenians used an advanced type of ship called triremes. These ships had their combat systems and were propelled by oarsmen. On the front of the Trireme was a large bronze battering ram. The oarsmen would row the trireme at an enemy boat, and ram a hole into its hull. This was the most effective way for the trireme to destroy other boats. The soldiers (hoplites) on the trireme would board the enemy ship and capture it. Nevertheless, the Athenian fleet of triremes was destroyed in a battle in 405 BC. Athens surrendered the following year and the war was over.\nDaily life.\nMen, when not working, fighting or discussing politics, could (at festive times) go to Ancient Greek theatre to watch dramas, comedies or tragedies. These often involved politics and the gods of Greek mythology. Women were not allowed to perform in the theatre; male actors played female roles.\nWomen did domestic work, such as spinning, weaving, cleaning, and cooking. They were not involved in public life or politics. Women from rich families however, had slaves to carry out domestic work for them.\nAncient Greek games.\nThe famous Olympic games were held at Olympia every four years. They were for men only, and women were not allowed to attend, even as spectators. The sports included running, javelin throwing, discus throwing and wrestling. The Games were unusual because the athletes could come from any Greek city.\nAnother competition, the Heraean Games, was held for women. It was also held at Olympus at a different time from the men's event.\nThe rules for girls in Sparta were different from other cities. They were trained in the same events as boys because Spartans believed that strong women would produce strong babies who would become future warriors. Their girl athletes were unmarried and competed nude or wearing short dresses. Boys were allowed to watch the athletes, in the hopes of creating marriages and offspring.\nLater, in the Classical period, girls could compete in the same festivals as males."}

{"id": "13448", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13448", "title": "Malaria", "text": "Malaria is an infectious disease caused by a parasite: it is spread by the bite of an infected mosquito. People catch malaria when the parasite enters the blood. The parasite causes a deadly infection which kills many people each year (from 75 million cases in 1950s to 0.1 million cases in 1960s). However, due to the development of insecticide resistance among mosquitoes and other factors, it staged a comeback in the mid 1970s (6.47 million cases in 1976), and continues to prevail in endemic/subendemic proportions, so that 80% indian population lives in malaria risk areas.\nMalaria is produced by 4 species of the protozoal parasite Plasmodium, is endemic in many tropical countries. It is one of the most common health problems. As per latest WHO estimates (2011)* between 149\u2013274 (median 216) million clinical cases and ~ 0.655 million deaths occur globally due to malaria each year, 90% of which are in Africa. This amounts to one malaria death every minute. In India, the National Malaria Eradication Programme (NMEP), started in 1958, achieved near complete disappearance of the disease in 1960s (from 75 million cases in 1950s to 0.1 million cases in 1960s). \nThe parasite that causes malaria is a protozoan called 'Plasmodium'. Protozoa are organisms with only one cell, but they are not bacteria. Bacteria are smaller and simpler than protozoans. \nPeople usually get malaria from the \"Anopheles\" or \"Culex\" mosquitoes : they are the vectors of the disease. The \"Plasmodium\" gets into people by the bites of mosquitoes. The \"Plasmodium\" is in the mosquito's special saliva. The mosquito's saliva injects an anticoagulant into the person to prevent their blood from clotting. The person is then infected with \"Plasmodium\" as a by-product. This makes the person have the disease we call malaria.\nOnly the female mosquito gives people malaria, because only the female mosquito consumes blood. The male mosquito lives on the nectar of flowers. The female uses blood as a source of protein for its eggs.\nSome people do not get malaria from mosquitoes. A baby can get it while inside its mother. This is called \"maternal-foetal transmission\". People can also get malaria from a blood transfusion. This is when someone gives blood to another person. Another way people can catch malaria is by using a needle that someone with the disease used before them.\nMalaria parasite life cycle.\nThere are several species (kinds) of \"Plasmodium\" that cause malaria in humans:\n\"P. vivax\" and \"P. falciparum\" cause the most malaria in people. \"Falciparum\" malaria is the worst kind, and kills the most people.\nWhen \"Plasmodium\" enters the blood, they are then called \"sporozoites\". Sporozoites go to the liver, where they make many more sporozoites. Then they change into a different form of \"Plasmodium\". This form is the \"merozoite\". The merozoites go into the red blood cells, then they make many more merozoites.\nThe merozoites break out of the red blood cells again and again. When they do this, the person gets very sick, and shows symptoms of malaria. This happens every few days, and is called a paroxysm.\n\"P. vivax\" and \"P. ovale\" can live in the liver for a long time. A person can look well, but still have the \"Plasmodium\" in the liver. This is called a \"dormant phase\". Weeks or months later, the \"Plasmodium\" can leave the liver to the blood, and the person will get sick again.\n\"P. falciparum\" is the most dangerous type of malaria. It makes people sicker than those with other types of malaria, because there are more of them in the blood. Also, with \"falciparum\" malaria, the red blood cells are sticky. This makes the red blood cells block blood vessels. If blood vessels are blocked, this can hurt what the blood vessel brings blood to, and can hurt people's organs.\nWho is affected by malaria.\nPregnant women and children are hurt most by malaria. When they get malaria, they get sicker.\n40% of people live in a place where there is malaria. Malaria is in these places:\nEvery year, 300 to 700 million people get malaria. It kills 1 million to 2 million people every year. 90% of the deaths occur in Africa. Most of the people who die from malaria are children. Even if children do not die, many have brain damage.\nMany of these deaths might be stopped with medicine or mosquito control. But many of the places malaria may be found are in poor countries. These countries do not have enough money to stop the mosquitoes, or to give people medicine. Money, however, is not the only problem. A country must have an organised medical system to provide services. Many countries in central Africa have been disrupted by warfare and conflict between groups, and general unrest. Also, easy solutions to kill the parasites do not exist as they did 50 years ago. This is because the insects are resistant to many insecticides, and the \"Plasmodium\" parasite is highly resistant to quinine and most other common drugs. This is a normal evolutionary process: the chemicals weed out the non-resistant organisms, and the offspring of the few resistant organisms multiply.\nSigns and symptoms of malaria.\nSymptoms are changes in someone's body that are signs for a disease. Most people who get malaria get symptoms 10\u201330 days after they get infected (the \"Plasmodium\" gets in their blood.) But some people can get symptoms after only a week, and some may be infected with malaria and not have symptoms for a year.\nThe most common symptom of malaria is fever, when the body temperature is high. The fever from malaria usually comes very suddenly. The people who have malaria often feel like they had influenza.\nSymptoms of malaria are:\nSigns of malaria:\nComplications from malaria.\nComplications are problems that happen because of a disease.\nPregnant women and young children have more complications. People who get malaria for the first time have more complications. \"Falciparum\" malaria has the most complications.\nDiagnosis.\nClinical diagnosis.\nA clinical diagnosis is based on the signs and symptoms of a disease, it is a diagnosis made without medical testing. In the case of malaria one of the main symptoms which may lead to a clinical diagnosis of malaria is a fever.\nAny clinical diagnosis of malaria should be confirmed by a trained professional based upon laboratory results as soon as it is possible.\nMalaria rapid diagnostic test.\nA Malaria rapid diagnostic test is a blood test which can confirm a diagnosis of malaria in about twenty minutes. RDTs are not foolproof and have a number of drawbacks, and as such a negative rapid diagnostic test should not be accepted at face-value and follow-up with malaria microscopy is necessary.\nMalaria microscopy.\nTo see if patients have malaria, doctors may do a blood test. This test is called a \"Giemsa blood smear\". Blood is put on a slide which is a thin piece of glass. The \"Giemsa\" stain is put on the slide. This stain helps doctors see the malaria. Then they look at the slide under a microscope. The \"Plasmodium\" is seen in the red blood cells.\nTreatment.\nPeople with different kinds of malaria need different medicines. The medicine that works for one kind of malaria may not for another kind. So it is very important to know which species of \"Plasmodium\" the person has.\nIf the species is not known, the person should be given medicine and care like they have \"falciparum\" malaria the worst kind.\nIt is also important to know \"where\" the person got malaria. \"Plasmodium\" in some places is resistant to some medicines. So the medicines to treat malaria in Africa are different from the medicines to treat malaria from South America.\nTreatment of malaria other than \"falciparum\".\nEverywhere except New Guinea, the treatment is the same. In New Guinea most \"P. vivax\" is resistant to \"chloroquine\". It can be treated with quinine, but this medicine can make people sick. Everywhere else, non-\"falciparum\" malaria is treated with chloroquine.\nChloroquine kills the \"Plasmodium\" in the blood. But the \"Plasmodium\" in the liver is not killed by chloroquine. \"P. vivax\" and \"P. ovale\" both stay in the liver a \"long\" time. This is the \"dormant phase\". Another medicine must be given with chloroquine for \"P. vivax\" and \"P. ovale\". This is to kill the \"Plasmodium\" in the liver. The medicine used to kill malaria in the liver is \"primaquine\". In southeast Asia, some \"P. vivax\" is resistant to primaquine. Most other places, \"primaquine\" works very well.\nSome people get very sick from \"primaquine\". So people have to be tested to see if they have G6PD-deficiency before they take \"primaquine\".\nTreatment of \"falciparum\" malaria.\nFalciparum is the worst kind of malaria. People with \"falciparum\" malaria should be treated in a hospital if they are:\nEven people who are treated with medicines at home should stay with the doctor for 8\u00a0hours. This is to make sure they do not get sicker.It also makes sure they can take the medicines by mouth. Malaria does not start to become a life-threatening disease until it has been a couple of weeks after the bite without being treated.\n\"Falciparum\" malaria also has more resistance to medicines. This makes it much harder to treat. \"Falciparum\" malaria is always treated with two or more medicines. Doctors choose the medicines by where in the world the person got malaria. Different places have \"P. falciparum\" that is resistant to different medicines.\nThe most important resistance is chloroquine-resistance. In some places in the world, \"P. falciparum\" is killed by chloroquine. In some places it is chloroquine-resistant. This means chloroquine does not kill it. In these places quinine can be used. Quinine is taken by mouth.\nHow to prevent malaria.\nThere are three ways to prevent malaria:\nControl mosquitoes.\n\"Vector control\" is one way to stop malaria. Vector means an organism that carries an infectious disease to another organism. For malaria, the vector is the \"Anopheles\" mosquito.\nThe most used method of vector control is pesticides. These are chemicals that kill the mosquito. The first pesticide used for vector control was DDT. DDT worked very well for vector control. It killed mosquitoes. It did not make people very sick at the time it was used. It did not cost very much money. Other chemicals for vector control had not been invented yet.\nIn many places mosquitoes became resistant to DDT. This meant that DDT did not work anymore in these areas. Scientists worried that DDT was making people and animals sick. It killed a lot of wildlife too. DDT also stays in the environment for a long time. For these reasons, people mostly use other chemicals for vector control. \"Organophosphate\" or \"carbonate\" pesticides are used, like \"malathion\" or \"bendiocarb\".\nVector control is not the only way to stop malaria. And DDT is not the only chemical that can be used for vector control. The best way to stop malaria is to use a combination of methods. In some places, DDT may be a useful part of a program to stop malaria. This is why DDT is still allowed to be used for controlling malaria.\nKeeping mosquitoes from biting.\nThe mosquito that carries malaria comes more at dawn (when the sun comes up) and dusk (when the sun goes down.) Be most careful at these times. Wear long trousers and shirts with long sleeves. Wear mosquito repellent (this is a chemical that mosquitoes do not like, so they do not bite.) Mosquitoes will bite through thin cloth. So repellent should be used on skin \"and clothes\".\nPesticides can be used in rooms to kill mosquitoes. When sleeping outside, people use a mosquito net. This is made from cloth that air can go through but keeps mosquitoes out. It is put over a bed where people sleep to keep mosquitoes out. Sometimes people also use it when they are not sleeping. It is best to use mosquito nets that have been treated with Permethrin, which repels and kills mosquitoes.\nTaking medicine to not get sick.\nPeople can take medicine when they are in a place where there is malaria. This reduces the chances that they contract malaria. This is called \"prophylaxis\".\nSome people take prophylactic medicines for years. Many people in areas where there is malaria do not have the money to buy this medicine.\nPeople who live where there is no malaria usually have \"not\" had malaria. The first case malaria is usually much worse. So people from places where there is no malaria may take prophylactic medicines when they go to places where there is malaria. The kind of prophylactic medicines people take depends on where they are. This is because not all medicines work on the malaria in every place.\nTo make them work best, prophylactic medicines have to be taken the right way. The medicine should start \"before\" going to an area with malaria. Most medicines should be taken for 4 weeks after coming home. One medicine (Malarone) only needs to be used for \"one\" week after coming home.\nResistance to malaria.\nThere are some children in Tanzania who are naturally immune to malaria. Researchers are using this to develop a new vaccine. U.S. researchers have found the children produce an antibody which attacks the malaria-causing parasite. Injecting a form of this antibody into mice protected the animals from the disease. The researchers plan to do tests on primates, including humans.\nHistory.\nIt was Britain's Sir Ronald Ross, working in the Presidency General Hospital in the Kolkata, who finally proved in 1898 that malaria is transmitted by \"anopheles\" mosquitoes. He did this by showing that certain mosquito species transmit malaria to birds. He isolated malaria parasites from the salivary glands of mosquitoes that had fed on infected birds. For this work, Ross received the 1902 Nobel Prize in Medicine. After resigning from the Indian Medical Service, Ross worked at the newly established Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and directed malaria-control efforts in Egypt, Panama, Greece and Mauritius. The findings of Finlay and Ross were later confirmed by a medical board headed by Walter Reed in 1900. Its recommendations were used during construction of the Panama Canal. This public-health work saved the lives of thousands of workers and helped develop the methods used in future public-health campaigns against the disease.\nThe first effective treatment for malaria came from the bark of cinchona tree, which contains quinine. This tree grows on the slopes of the Andes, mainly in Peru. The indigenous peoples of Peru made a tincture of cinchona to control malaria. The Jesuits noted the efficacy of the practice and introduced the treatment to Europe during the 1640s, where it was rapidly accepted. It was not until 1820 that the active ingredient, quinine, was extracted from the bark, isolated and named by French chemists.\nIn the early 20th century, before antibiotics became available, Julius Wagner-Jauregg discovered that patients with syphilis could be treated by intentionally infecting them with malaria. The resulting fever would kill the syphilis spirochaetes, and quinine could be administered to control the malaria. Although some patients died from malaria, this was preferable to the almost-certain death from syphilis.\nMalaria was the largest hazard encountered by U.S. troops in the South Pacific during World War II, where about 500,000 men were infected. Sixty thousand American soldiers died of malaria during the North African and South Pacific campaigns."}

Blood vessels that take blood away from the heart are arteries. Blood vessels that take blood back to the heart are veins. Capillaries are between veins and arteries and they supply tissue with blood. \nThe heart plus all of the blood vessels in the body together are called the circulatory system. Blood is moved by the pumping of the heart and carries oxygen to the tissues. \nThe expansion of blood vessels is called vasodilation, it helps the body to get rid of heat energy (\"vas-\" in Latin means \"container\" or \"vessel\").\nThe constriction of blood vessels is called vasoconstriction, it prevents the body from losing warmth. \nThere are 100,000 km (60,000 miles) of blood vessels in an adult human body.\nGrowing new blood vessels is called angiogenesis.\nStructure.\nDifferent parts of the body have different kinds of blood vessels for different parts of their work. The vessel wall consists of three shells:\nThe structure of the vessel wall depends on hemodynamic conditions: blood flow velocity, volume and blood pressure. Arteries located close to the heart are characterized by a predominance of elastic elements that are able to counteract high hemodynamic parameters. As you move away from the heart, hemodynamic values decrease, the caliber of blood vessels decreases and the number of muscle elements in their walls increases, which are able to create additional force to push blood into the network of the smallest vessels."}

It consists of the heart and blood vessels. The blood carries various materials that the body needs, and takes away waste or harmful substances.\nBlood vessels that take blood away from the heart are arteries. Arteries divide into smaller arteries as they go away from the heart. The smaller arteries that connect to the capillaries, are called \"arterioles\".\nBlood vessels that take blood towards the heart are veins. Veins get bigger as they go towards the heart. The smallest veins are called \"venules\". Pronounced (VEHN-yools)\nCapillaries go between arteries and veins. Capillaries are quite thin, hence the name which comes from the Latin \"capillus\" meaning \"hair.\" \nSo blood moves: heart\u2192artery\u2192arteriole\u2192capillary\u2192venule\u2192vein\u2192heart. This is called circulation. There are two different \"circulations\" in the circulatory system. The \"systemic circulation\" is how blood goes to most of the body. The \"pulmonary circulation\" is how blood goes through the lungs. (Pulmonary means \u00a8about the lungs\u00a8). This is how it works in mammals, including humans. Circulatory systems of other vertebrates differ somewhat.\nSystemic circulation.\nBlood that comes from the left side of the heart is full of oxygen and nutrients. Nutrients are substances that your body needs to live, like protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. The blood brings the oxygen and nutrients to your body.\nThis blood in \"systemic\" arteries that is full of oxygen and nutrients is \"systemic arterial blood\". It is sometimes just called \"arterial blood\". \nThe biggest systemic artery in the body is the aorta. This is the large blood vessel that comes out of the heart. Smaller arteries branch off from the aorta. These arteries have smaller arteries that branch off from them. The smallest arteries turn into arterioles.\nThe smallest blood vessels are capillaries. Systemic arterioles turn into capillaries. The blood from arterioles goes into the capillaries. There oxygen and nutrients go out of the blood into the tissue around the capillaries. The blood also picks up carbon dioxide and waste from the tissue. The network of capillaries that brings blood to an area is called a \"capillary bed\".\nOn the other end of the capillary, it turns into a venule. Venules are the smallest veins. Veins take blood back to the heart. As veins go back to the heart, they merge and get bigger. The biggest systemic veins in the body are the vena cava. There are two vena cava. The \"inferior vena cava\" takes blood from the lower part of the body to the right side of the heart. (In anatomy, inferior means below.) The \"superior vena cava\" takes blood from the upper part of the body to the heart. (Superior means above.)\nPulmonary circulation.\nThis same movement of blood goes through the lungs in the \"pulmonary circulation\".\nThe blood that the vena cava vein takes to the heart is full of carbon dioxide. It has much less oxygen than (systemic) arterial blood. The right side of the heart pushes the venous blood into the pulmonary artery. The pulmonary artery takes blood to the lungs. In the lungs, the blood goes through the \"pulmonary capillary bed\". (The capillaries that are in the lungs). Here it gets more oxygen. It also drops off carbon dioxide. (This is the opposite of what happens in capillary beds in the rest of the body. In the systemic circulation blood drops off oxygen and picks up carbon dioxide).\nAfter the pulmonary capillary bed, the blood goes to the pulmonary veins. This \"pulmonary venous blood\" now is full of oxygen. The pulmonary veins take blood to the left side of the heart. Then the blood goes to the systemic circulation again.\nThe shunt.\nVeins from the gut shunt to the liver before returning to the right atrium and ventricle. The shunt is called the hepatic portal vein. \nThe meaning of this is as follows. The liver is the body's main chemical factory. It takes in the flow of nutrients from the gut, and adjusts them to suit what the body needs. It can store surplus nutrients, or release extra nutrients from store. It can change the chemical make-up of many nutrients. In this way it adapts to the many different kinds of food which the body digests. "}

The other is the rainbow flag.\nThe pink triangle was first used in Nazi Germany to mark homosexual prisoners. There was also a \"black triangle\" that marked \"anti-social women\". Many but not all of these women were lesbians. Jews wore the famous yellow star of David. If a prisoner was both Jewish and gay, he would wear a yellow triangle overlapped by a pink triangle, creating a star of David.\nHomosexuality was illegal in Nazi Germany under a law called \"Paragraph 175\", which made it a felony (a \"very serious\" crime). About 100,000 people were arrested, with about 50,000 sent to prison. Some were sent to mental hospitals. Some were castrated (had their testicles removed). Some homosexual men were also sent to concentration camps, especially Jewish homosexuals. Between 15,000 and 600,000 homosexual men were sent to concentration camps. Most of them died there. We are not sure of the real number. Prisoners who were Jewish and homosexual may not have been counted as homosexual.\nHomosexual prisoners were treated worse than other prisoners. Their death rates were higher than other \"anti-social\" groups. One story by a gay man who lived in a concentration camp shows how it was. Pierre Seel was sent to the Schirmeck concentration camp. The Nazis said a public execution would happen. A man was brought out. Seel saw that the man was his 18 year old lover. The Nazis took all the clothes of Seel's lover and put a bucket over his head. Then Seel had to watch as the Nazis let German Shepherds (dogs) maul his lover to death.\nAfter World War II, homosexual men were still not treated well in Germany. The law continued. It was used to hurt homosexuals and to put them in prison. Many spent years in prison.\nThe pink triangle observes the memory of the homosexual people who died in the Holocaust. It is important not to ignore these deaths. The killing of homosexuals both during WWII \"and\" \"after\" WWII ended is the secret story of the Holocaust. Using the pink triangle symbol puts these victims in the public view. It is in respect for those who died."}

It focuses on molecules like DNA. It is done often with the help of computers.\nFoundation.\nAs species of living things change over time, the DNA contained in their cells change, because of evolution. If we can extract the information from living things today, and compare them to each other, we can see which living things are most closely related, the most similar can be thought to be the most closely related in time. Biologists can then construct family trees, or phylogenies. By combining each tree, a grand tree connecting all living things can be made, this is called the \"Tree of Life\". Bioinformatics uses integration of mathematical, statistical and computational method to analyze biological, biochemical and biophysical data.\nThe process.\nAll of the information needed by a cell is provided in its DNA. When a cell wants to build a protein, it finds the appropriate piece of DNA, makes a copy of it (called RNA), and uses the instructions in the copy to make the protein. \nProteins can perform many functions like transportation, structural support, movement and metabolism. Proteins are made from \"amino acids\". There are twenty different amino acids that are used to build millions of different protein molecules. \nThese molecules can be studied using computers to analyze the DNA, RNA, and amino acid sequences from which they are created. Because there are so many different molecules, the best way we have of understanding how the entire system works is to use bioinformatics.\nComputers in bioinformatics.\nChemists have developed ways to understand the shape and behavior of small molecules, using mathematical analysis. They might use computers to study these molecules. The DNA contained in just one cell of an organism is far too large to be read by any person, and to compare the DNA between two (or more) organisms, be they in the brother and sister, or of a completely different species, requires comparing large amounts of information to find differences. Computers are better suited to such comparisons, and computer programmers have worked with biologists to create very very large databases to store all the DNA information that has ever been learned."}

{"id": "13479", "revid": "966595", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13479", "title": "Testicle", "text": "Testicles are parts that are found on the bodies of male creatures. Male mammals, including humans, have two testicles, supported in a sac of skin below the penis called the scrotum. Along with the penis, testicles are called reproductory organs or \"sex organs\". Only males have testicles; females have ovaries. \nTesticles are a type of organ called glands. Like other glands, testicles make \"chemical substances\", called hormones that keep the body working. Testicles also make sperm, which can join with ova to make new life. \nMost glands, like women's ovaries, are inside the body, but testicles are outside the main part of the body. This is because the testicles work better if they are cooler than the inside of the body. In cold weather, testicles pull up nearer to the body to keep warm.\nDescription.\nThe testicles are firm, oval-shaped glands. Most testicles match in size, but some testicles are much larger or smaller than others. Normal sized testicles are between 14 cm\u00b3 to 35 cm\u00b3. \nMost men have one testicle that hangs lower than the other one. Scientists think this may be so that they do not hit against each other. It is usually, but not always, the left testicle that hangs lower.\nThe testicles hang in the scrotum by the spermatic cord. They are outside the body because they need to be cooler than the temperature inside the body, in order to make sperm. If a man's testicles get cold, they are automatically pulled closer to the body. The \"spermatic\" cord is tightened by the cremasteric muscle. When this muscle \"contracts\" (pulls tighter), the cord gets shorter, which pulls the testicles closer to the body. If the testicles are too warm, the cremasteric muscle \"relaxes\" (gets longer.) This lowers the testicles to keep them cooler. This is how the testicles are kept at the right temperature. This is called the \"cremasteric reflex\". (A reflex is something your body \"automatically\" does without you thinking about it.)\nThere are other uses for the \"cremasteric reflex\" apart from making the testicles the right temperature. Stress can also make the \"cremasteric reflex\" work. If a male human or mammal gets into a fight, then its testicles are in danger. They automatically pull up close to the body. The \"cremasteric reflex\" also happens during sexual intercourse.\nFunction.\nTesticles have two important jobs in the body. They are part of two of the body's systems, the endocrine system which keeps the body working, and the reproductive system which makes new life. \nMaking hormones.\nTesticles are a type of organ called glands. (This makes them part of the body's \"endocrine system\".) The human body has many types of glands. The job of glands within a body is to make \"chemical substances\", and put them out into the body's system. A body has lots of different systems that keep it in good working order all the time, and that also provide for a body's special needs. Some of the body's special needs happen when a person gets angry, frightened or sick, or if the person wants to have sexual intercourse. At these times a body uses more of some types of \"chemical substance\", so the glands that make them work harder. \nTesticles make several types of chemical substances. They are not simple chemicals, but are very complicated and very important to life. Making these substances is controlled by the pituitary gland which is a small gland in the brain.\nOne substance made by the testicles is a type of substance known as a hormone. It is the hormone testosterone. Testosterone is important in a male person's body, because it makes him grow into a man and feel like a man during puberty. (Women's bodies make some testosterone too, but they make more female hormone called estrogen.) \nMaking sperm.\nAs well as being chemical-producing glands, testicles are gonads. (This makes them part of the body's \"reproductive system\".) Apart from \"hormones\", the other important substances made by the testicles are spermatozoa, which are generally just called sperm. (The word \"sperm\" is plural, so you do not add an \"s\" and say \"sperms\".) The \"sperm\" are tiny living cells which can join with another cell, called an \"ovum\" (or egg) inside a female, to start a new human life. Scientists call making sperm \"spermatogenesis\". Boys begin making sperm when they start growing into men, at a time of life called puberty. \nFemales do not have testicles. The glands in their bodies that do the same sort of jobs as testicles are called ovaries. They have two ovaries, but unlike testicles, ovaries are inside the body, on either side of the uterus. They release \"ova\" (or eggs) and \"female hormones\". Ovaries and testicles are sometimes called \"gonads\".\nHealth issues.\nSize.\nSize in animals\nStudying animals can help in understanding things about people. In mammals, testicles can be very big or very small in relation to the size of the animal itself. The size has to do with the amount of sperm that the male animal needs to make. Some types of male animal generally only have one sexual partner at a time and are called monogamous. Some types of animals generally live in a herd or flock where one male will have many female sexual partners. These males are called polygamous. More sperm is needed by \"polygamous\" males than by \"monogamous\" males. \"Polygamous\" males generally have larger testicles than \"monogamous\" males. The testicles grow larger to make more sperm.\nSize in men\nMost men's testicles are from 14 cm\u00b3 to 35 cm\u00b3. This is a measure of volume. Sometimes Doctors need to measure a man's testicles to see if there is a problem. Doctors can measure the volume of testicles in two ways: \nSometimes the size of a man's testicles changes.\nSome reasons why testicles get smaller are: \nSome reasons why testicles get bigger are: \nDiseases.\nThe most important diseases of testicles are:\nLoss and injury \nMost boys are born with two testicles in the scrotum. The testicles have formed inside the baby's body, but moved into the scrotum before the birth. Sometimes one or both the testicles are still inside when the baby is born. Sometimes an operation is needed to fix this. \nIf a testicle is injured, it is extremely painful. Sometimes testicles get crushed. Sometimes it is necessary for a doctor to remove one or both the testicles. This operation is called an orchidectomy. If a man loses a testicle, a doctor can put a \"testicular prosthesis\" (false testicle) into the scrotum. It looks and feels like a testicle. \nIf a male loses both his testicles it's called castration. Because the man cannot produce sperm or testosterone, it has a big effect on the man's life. Because he cannot make sperm, he cannot have children. And because he cannot make the male hormone testosterone, he becomes less like a male. He may lose some of his muscles, and put on weight. A man who has lost his testicles may take testosterone medicine so that he does not have these changes. \nUntil the 1700s in Europe, and more recently in some countries, there was a custom to castrate young male slaves and boys. Young slaves were castrated so that they could be used as guards over the wives of rich men. It meant that the wives would not fall in love with their guards. Sometimes young boys who had beautiful singing voices were castrated before puberty. This meant that their voices would stay high all their lives. These singing men were called castrati. \nCastrating animals \nIt is very common to castrate (remove the testicles from) male domestic animals. Male dogs and cats that are castrated do not fight so much, and do not stray around looking for females to mate with. \nMale horses are usually castrated so that they become more calm and safer to ride. A castrated male horse is called a gelding. A male horse that is not castrated is a stallion. \nMale animals that are used for meat are generally castrated because it makes them fatter and also makes them quieter to keep because they do not fight each other. Most male cattle are castrated.\nOther names for testicles.\nTesticles can also be called \"testes\" or \"gonads\".\nThere are many slang words for testicles, like balls, nuts, bollocks, nads, crown jewels, testies, marbles, ding dangs, boy toys, nicnaks, plums,tattay (in Urdu) etc. Slang words are other names that are used for fun or to be \"vulgar\" (rude)."}

S. Lewis. It appeared in installments in \"The Guardian\" newspaper and was later published as a book in 1942. It is a series of letters written by a devil named Screwtape to his apprentice and nephew Wormwood. The letters are filled with advice for the young demon on how to tempt men. Screwtape tells Wormwood how to undo the work of God and work against Him.\n\"The Screwtape Letters\" were greatly popular. It was published in 1941, and after that, it has sold very well around the world. Because it is funny and easy to read and understand, many people read it easily and have been influenced by it.\nMain Characters.\nThe two main characters that are inside the letters are Wormwood, a demon that has the job of leading his \"patient\" away from Christianity (or at least making him a useless Christian). Screwtape is Wormwood's uncle and a \"high\" demon.\nScrewtape.\nScrewtape, a devil and the uncle of Wormwood, helps Satan and everything he stands for. He calls the devil \"our Father\". He also fights against everything God stands for, calling God \"The Enemy\". Wrong to him is right and right to him is wrong. Through these backhanded references, we see temptation from a different light. Because Screwtape sees the world in reverse, we ought always to ask ourselves the questions which Wormwood must never let the patient ask, or to carefully consider the things which the patient must never think. \nLewis writes, in the Preface, that he did not perceive Hell and the \"Lowerarchy\" as an exact antithesis to God, who is Good for His own sake, but rather to a \"thoroughly nasty business concern\" in which each individual is out for his own ends. We see an example of this in letter 23, when Screwtape reveals his true nature to Wormwood. \nIronically, even though many of the things he says are Biblically wrong, some of the things he says are, according to the Bible, true. He talks about the glory of heaven when the patient is taken up there, though he does not understand why God gives them to men. He admits to Wormwood that he does not know about his Enemy well enough. Screwtape cannot understand love and says in Letter 18 that he believes that God must have another, hidden reason to save men, since everybody is selfish and cannot love. \nScrewtape is always afraid that God will step in and stop Wormwood's temptations. Screwtape says that when the patient prays to God for help, God always comes, so Screwtape is fearful.\nAt first, Screwtape thinks the patient's soul will go to hell. However, he is angry when Wormwood makes more and more mistakes. He feels that God is \"winning the battle\". \nQuotes from the book.\nSeveral noteworthy phrases arise in the course of the patient's temptation:\n\"Indeed the safest road to Hell is the gradual one\u2014the gentle slope, soft underfoot, without sudden turnings, without milestones, without signposts.\"\n\"It is funny how mortals always picture us as putting things into their minds: in reality our best work is done by keeping things out.\"\n\"Our cause is never more in danger than when a human, no longer desiring, but still intending, to do our Enemy\u2019s will, looks round upon a universe from which every trace of Him seems to have vanished, and asks why he has been forsaken, and still obeys.\"\nSetting.\nThe book is set during the early years of World War II. This was the time when it was actually written. Lewis was living in England during the war. He went through many of the things that the patient goes through in \"The Screwtape Letters\". Many of his first readers did, too. The book, however, focuses more on the spiritual battle between demons and their patient."}

The area was named \"Nuevo M\u00e9xico\" (New Mexico) by the Spanish in the mid-1500s and officially settled in 1598, its capital Santa Fe was selected in 1610. In the late 1600s, the Pueblo people revolted against the Spanish. The Spanish returned twelve years later, and made a better attempt at giving the Pueblos better representation in New Mexico\u2019s society and government. One such Spanish governor of New Mexico, that is most well known for his work with Native Americans, was named Tom\u00e1s V\u00e9lez Cachup\u00edn.\nWhen Mexico became independent in the early 1800s, New Mexico was part of it. Mexico wasn\u2019t successful in representing the New Mexican people, which lead to another revolt called the Chimayo Rebellion.\nIn 1846, the United States and Mexico went to war over a border dispute in Texas (a former state of Mexico that, after being its own country for a time joined the US), and the United States won the war. The peace treaty the two countries signed gave what is now the American Southwest to the United States. While most of what was then Northern Mexico did not have a large amount of people living in it, New Mexico had population centers in Pueblo and Spanish towns, especially along the Rio Grande river and in the Sangre de Cristo mountains. The New Mexican citizens living there were allowed to stay if they agreed to become US Citizens; over 90% did.\nAfter some time as a territory, the area became a state in 1912."}

The child must be at least five years younger than the person in the case of adolescent pedophiles before the attraction can be called pedophilia. Adults whose primary or exclusive sexual attraction is for pubescent early adolescents (ages 11 to 14) are properly called Hebephiles, not pedophiles. Adults whose primary or exclusive sexual attraction is for late to post-pubescent teens (ages 15 to 19) are properly called Ephebophiles, but ephebophilia is not considered abnormal by mental health professionals. The opposite of pedophilia is \"Teleiophilia\" (the sexual attraction to young adults). A narrower sub-type of pedophilia is called N\"epiophilia\" or \"Infantophilia\" (the sexual attraction to pre-pubescent children restricted to babies/toddlers).\nCondition.\nMedically, this condition is classified by the American Psychiatric Association as a mental disorder. Some pedophiles have sex with children or use children in a sexual way. This is called \"child sexual abuse\" because by law, children are unable to truly agree to sexual acts with an adult. Some adults have pedophilic feelings but do not act by sexually abusing children. Some adults who are not pedophiles commit sexual abuse against children.\nNot all pedophiles feel or act in the same way. Since the 1880s, psychologists have studied and shown that different pedophiles might act in different ways:\nStudies.\nGeneral.\nFor pedophiles who commit child sexual abuse, some studies have shown that pedophiles who are only attracted to children may abuse more children than pedophiles who also have adult sexual partners.\nThe people who abuse children are often known to them\u2014such as parents, other relatives, and friends\u2014and are not strangers. One research study found that half the adults convicted of child sexual abuse of children outside of their family were also sexually abusing their own children.\nIs it common?\nMedical researchers do not know how many people in the population are pedophiles. This is because it is hard to study people's feelings and desires unless they actually show that they have those feelings. Generally, the only pedophiles who can be studied are those who have both broken the law and been caught and convicted of child sexual abuse. A second reason is that when an adult or teenager sexually abuses a child, people often call the abuser a \"pedophile\", but it is possible that the abuse happened for a different reason, such as the unavailability of an adult partner. Experts generally define a person as a pedophile only if they are primarily or exclusively sexually attracted to pre-pubescent children. If a person sexually abuses a pre-pubescent child to frighten or punish them, for example, then it may not be true pedophile behavior.\nSome sources, such as the Mayo Clinic, report that most child sexual abuse of pre-pubescent children is committed by pedophiles, while other studies report that most people who sexually abuse children are not pedophiles. According to some studies, about 1% of all adult males may be pedophiles.\nTreatment.\nAs of 2008, most doctors believe that pedophilia cannot be cured. The current approach to deal with pedophiles who have been convicted of sexual abuse is to try to change their behavior. It does not change their sexual attraction. Using this treatment, it is believed that some sex offenders can be prevented from offending again. Medications such as Depo-Provera can be used to treat pedophilia."}

Carbonate bauxites were discovered earlier, and occur mainly in Europe and Jamaica above carbonate rocks such as limestone and dolomite.\nLateritic bauxites occur in many countries of the tropical belt. They were formed from various silicate rocks such as granite, gneiss, basalt, syenite, and shale.\nFor bauxite to be created there must be intense weathering conditions and very good drainage.

He was the United States Senator from Kansas between 1969 to 1996 as a member of the Republican Party. He was the Republican Leader of the United States Senate during the final eleven years of his Senate career from 1985 until 1996. Before his senate career, he was a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1961 to 1969. Dole was the Republican nominee for Vice President in the 1976 election and for President in the 1996 election.\nDole was born and raised in Russell, Kansas, where he began with a legal career after serving in the United States Army during World War II. He was the Russell County Attorney for a short time until he won election to the House of Representatives in 1960. In 1968, Dole was elected to the Senate, where he was chairman of the Republican National Committee from 1971 to 1973 and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee from 1981 to 1985. He was the Senate Majority Leader from 1985 to 1987 and from 1995 to 1996. \nPresident Gerald Ford chose Dole as his running mate in the 1976 election after Vice President Nelson Rockefeller did not want to continue being Ford's vice president. Ford lost the election to Democrat Jimmy Carter in the general election. Dole ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 1980 but quickly dropped out of the race. He ran again for the nomination in the 1988 Republican primaries but lost to Vice President George H. W. Bush. Dole won the Republican nomination in 1996, however lost in the general election to President Bill Clinton. He resigned from the Senate during the 1996 campaign and did not run for public office again after the election.\nAfter retiring from the Senate, Dole appeared in commercials and television programs. In 2012, Dole unsuccessfully supporting Senate passing the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Dole is currently a member of the advisory council of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation and special counsel at the Washington, D.C., office of law firm Alston &amp; Bird. On January 17, 2018, Dole was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. He is married to former U.S. Senator Elizabeth Dole of North Carolina.\nEarly life.\nDole was born on July 22, 1923, in Russell, Kansas, the son of Bina M. (n\u00e9e Talbott; 1904\u20131983) and Doran Ray Dole (1901\u20131975). The Doles lived in a house at 1035 North Maple in Russell and it remained his official residence during his political career.\nDole graduated from Russell High School in the spring of 1941 and went to the University of Kansas. While at the University of Kansas, Dole played for the basketball team, the track team, and the football team. In 1942 he was a teammate of former Tennessee Titans owner Bud Adams, Adams's only season playing football at Kansas. While in college, Dole joined the Kappa Sigma fraternity. \nDuring his college years, Dole enlisted in the United States Army during World War II in 1942. In April 1945, while in combat near Castel d'Aiano southwest of Bologna, Italy, Dole was seriously wounded by German machine gun fire, being struck in his upper back and right arm. His recovery was slow as he had many health problems caused by his injured. Dole recovered from his wounds and was honored three times, receiving two Purple Hearts for his injuries, and the Bronze Star with valor for his attempt to help a radioman. The injuries left him with limited mobility in his right arm and numbness in his left arm.\nDole later went to the University of Arizona from 1948 to 1949, before transferring to Washburn University and graduating with both undergraduate and law degrees in 1952.\nEarly political career.\nDole ran for office for the first time in 1950 and was elected to the Kansas House of Representatives, being a member for a two-year term. In 1952, he became the County Attorney of Russell County. In 1960, Dole was elected to the United States House of Representatives from Kansas' 6th congressional district. After his first term, Kansas lost a congressional district, and most of Dole's district was merged with the 2nd district to form a new 1st district. Dole was elected from this district in 1962 and was reelected two more times.\nDuring his time as a U.S. Representative, Dole voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1968, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\nU.S. Senate, 1969\u20131996.\nIn 1968, Dole won the United States Senate election against former Kansas Governor William H. Avery for the Republican nomination to replaced retiring Senator Frank Carlson. Dole was re-elected in 1974, 1980, 1986, and 1992.\nWhile in the Senate, Dole served as chairman of the Republican National Committee from 1971 until 1973, the ranking Republican on the Agriculture Committee from 1975 until 1978, and the chairman of the Finance Committee from 1981 until 1985.\nIn 1976, Dole ran unsuccessfully for vice president on a ticket headed by President Gerald Ford. During the Vice Presidential debate with Walter Mondale, \"I figured it up the other day: If we added up the killed and wounded in Democrat wars in this century, it would be about 1.6 million Americans\u00a0\u2014 enough to fill the city of Detroit\".\nOver time in the Senate, Dole was seen by some as having a moderate voting record, meaning he often voted with the Democrats. During the 1970s, he worked with Senator George McGovern to help pass legislation making food stamps more accessible. In 1982, \"The New York Times\" called Dole as changing from becoming strictly a conservative to \"mainstream\" Republican.\nThe Republicans won both the Senate and House of Representatives in 1994 and Dole became Senate Majority Leader for the second time. \nIn October 1995, Dole and Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich led the Republican-controlled Congress to pass a spending bill that President Clinton vetoed, leading to the federal government shutdown from 1995\u201396. The following month Republican and Democratic leaders, including Vice President Al Gore, Dick Armey, and Dole, met to try to fix the budget and were unable to reach an agreement. By January 1996, Dole was more open to talk about ending the shutdown, but was not supported by other Republicans who wanted to continue until their demands were met. Gingrich and Dole had a hard time working together as they were possible rivals for the 1996 Republican nomination. \nIn a January 1996 address, during the shutdown, President Bill Clinton said of Dole as a lawmaker that was \"working together in good faith\" to reopen the government.\nIn June 1996, Dole resigned from the Senate to focus on his presidential campaign because he was the Republican Party's presidential nominee for the 1996 election.\nPresidential politics.\nDole first ran for President of the United States in 1980 for the Republican nomination, eventually won by Ronald Reagan. He finished behind Reagan, George H. W. Bush and four others in Iowa and New Hampshire, receiving only 2.5% and 0.4% of votes cast in those contests. Dole ended his campaign after New Hampshire and announced his formal withdrawal from the race on March 15, instead being re-elected to his third term as Senator that year.\nDole announced his second campaign in 1988, formally announcing his candidacy in his hometown of Russell, Kansas, on November 9, 1987. Dole started out strongly by beating Vice President George H. W. Bush in the Iowa caucus.\nHowever, Bush would beat Dole in the New Hampshire primary a week later. During the New Hampshire primaries, Dole lost his temper in a television interview with Tom Brokaw, saying Bush should \"stop lying about my record\", in response to a Bush commercial which accused Dole laying about his tax ideas.\nDole lost to Bush again in South Carolina in early March and several days later, every southern state voted for Bush in a Super Tuesday sweep. He eventually lost Illinois to Bush and afterwards dropped out of the race.\n1996 presidential campaign.\nOn April 10, 1995, Dole announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination for president, in his third campaign for the presidency. Dole was the early front-runner for the nomination. At least eight candidates ran for the nomination, such as the more conservative Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and more moderate Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania. Pat Buchanan upset Dole in the early New Hampshire primary, however, with Dole finishing second and former Tennessee governor Lamar Alexander finishing third. Many believed that Dole was not doing good at first because he was not \"conservative enough\".\nDole eventually won the nomination in May after winning all the Midwestern primaries, becoming the oldest first-time presidential nominee at the age of 73 years. If elected, he would have been the oldest president to take office.\nIn his acceptance speech, Dole said: \"Let me be the bridge to an America that only the unknowing call myth. Let me be the bridge to a time of tranquillity, faith, and confidence in action\". President Bill Clinton responded, \"We do not need to build a bridge to the past, we need to build a bridge to the future\".\nDole hoped to use his long experience in Senate to boost his odds against an incumbent president. On June 11, 1996, Dole resigned his seat to focus on the campaign, saying he had \"nowhere to go but the White House or home\".\nDole promised a 15% reduction in income tax rates and made former Congressman and supply side supporter Jack Kemp his running mate for vice president. Clinton said Dole was a clone of unpopular then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich. He warned that Dole would work with the Republican Congress to cut popular social programs, like Medicare and Social Security. Dole's tax-cut plan found itself under attack from the White House, who said it would \"blow a hole in the deficit\".\nSome people were worried about Dole's age and on September 18, 1996 at a rally in Chico, California, he was reaching down to shake the hand of a supporter, when the railing on the stage gave way and he tumbled four feet. Many compared the fall between Dole to a younger Clinton, making it clear that Dole's age was becoming an issue.\nTowards the end of October 1996, Dole and his advisers knew that they would lose the election, but in the last four days of the campaign they went on the \"96-hour victory tour\" to help Republican Congressional candidates.\nDole lost to incumbent President Clinton, with a 379\u2013159 Electoral College landslide. Clinton won 49.2% of the vote against Dole's 40.7% and Ross Perot's 8.4%. Many believe that the strong economy during the Clinton president helped the president win a second term.\nRetirement.\nAfter the 1996 election, Dole began to focus on writing, being a lawyer, public speaking, and television appearances. He became a television commercial spokesman for Viagra, Visa, Dunkin' Donuts and Pepsi-Cola. He was also a political commentator on the interview program \"Larry King Live\", and has been a guest a number of times on Comedy Central's \"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart\". Dole was, for a short time, a commentator with Bill Clinton on CBS's \"60 Minutes\". He also made a cameo appearance on \"Saturday Night Live\" making fun of himself.\nFrom 1998 to 2002, Dole was head of the Federal City Council in Washington, D.C. Dole later joined the Washington, D.C. firm Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson and Hand, where he became a lobbyist. Dole joined the Washington, D.C. law and lobbying firm Alston &amp; Bird LLP.\nDole was also involved in many voluntary organizations. He served as national chairman of the World War II Memorial Campaign, which raised funds for the building of the National World War II Memorial. He also worked with former President Clinton on the Families of Freedom Foundation, a scholarship fund campaign to pay for college educations for the families of 9/11 victims.\nIn 2007, President George W. Bush appointed Dole and Donna Shalala, former Secretary of Health and Human Services, as co-chairs of the commission to investigate problems at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. That same year, Dole joined fellow former Senate majority leaders Howard Baker, Tom Daschle, and George Mitchell to found the Bipartisan Policy Center, to create ideas for bipartisan support.\nOn December 4, 2012, Dole made an appearance on the Senate floor to support the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, however Republicans rejected the bill.\nTrump presidency.\nIn 2015, Dole supported former Florida governor Jeb Bush in his presidential campaign. After Bush ended his campaign following the South Carolina primary, Dole supported Florida senator Marco Rubio's campaign. During the campaign, Dole criticized Texas senator Ted Cruz questioning his support of Republican ideas. Dole later supported Donald Trump after Trump won the Republican nomination. He was the only former Republican presidential nominee to go to the 2016 Republican National Convention. \nFormer Dole advisers, including Paul Manafort, played a major role in Trump's presidential campaign. After Trump won the 2016 election, Dole worked with the Trump campaign and presidential transition team to set up meetings with the government of Taiwan.\nDole was worried about the Commission on Presidential Debates were biased against President Trump and his reelection campaign in a public statement on October 9, 2020, saying how he knew all the Republicans on the Commission and feared that \"none of them support[ed]\" the president. After Trump lost the election, he made false claims about voter fraud and that the election was stolen. Dole did not agree with Trump and said there was no fraud in the many lawsuits that Trump claimed there was.\nPersonal life.\nDole married Phyllis Holden in 1948, three months after they met. The couple only had one daughter, Robin. Dole and Holden divorced January 11, 1972. Dole met his second wife, Elizabeth, in 1972. The couple were married in 1975 and have no children.\nDole is a Freemason.\nDole is known for speaking to himself in the third person in conversation. \nHealth problems.\nAfter prostate surgery, Dole had erectile dysfunction and made a public service announcement speaking up about it. In 2001, Dole, at age 77, was treated for an aortic aneurysm.\nIn January 2005, Dole had bleeding inside his head. Dole spent 40 days at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and the bleeding left him with mobility problems.\nIn February 2010, Dole was hospitalized for pneumonia after having knee surgery. He spent ten months at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, recovering from the surgery, and had pneumonia three times. He was released from the hospital in November 2010. In January 2011, however, Dole was hospitalized again to Walter Reed Army Medical Center and spent about six days there, being treated for a fever and an infection.\nDole was hospitalized in November 2012 at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.\nOn September 13, 2017, Dole was hospitalized at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for low blood pressure. He stayed for 24 hours before returning home.\nIn February 2021, Dole announced he was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer.

It is made of skin and muscle and is found between the penis and anus. It is often covered in pubic hair and becomes tight when the male is aroused.\nUse.\nThe function of the scrotum is to keep the testicles less warm than the rest of the body. Human testicles work best at 36.8 degrees Celsius (98 degrees Fahrenheit) when normal body temperature is 37 degrees Celsius (98.6 degrees Fahrenheit). Higher temperatures than 36.8 degrees will damage the sperm inside the testicles.\nThe temperature is controlled by moving the testicles closer to the abdomen when they are too cold, and away when too hot. This is done by muscles contracting or relaxing. This lifts and lowers the testicles inside the scrotum. The scrotum will usually tighten during erection. The testicles can also be lifted by tightening the anus and pelvic muscles.\nTemperature.\nThe best temperature for the testes varies between species, but usually it is a bit cooler than body temperature. This means that the testicles have to be held outside of the body in most male mammals.\nProtection.\nThe scrotum may move the testes closer to the abdomen when in danger. Testes are extremely sensitive, and hitting or injuring them causes extreme pain. Males avoid this by involunatirly moving the testes closer. \nAnother explanation for the location of the scrotum is to that their exterior location protects the testes from jolts and being crushed inside the body. Animals that have slow movements - such as elephants, whales, and moles - have internal testes and no scrotum.\nWhen the scrotum is hanging loosely, the testicular cords that the testicle hangs from can get twisted. This is especially prone to happen during exercise. This is called . It is a medical emergency. "}

The duodenum is the first part of the small intestines. It is the tube that food goes through when it leaves the stomach. \"Peptic\" means talking about the stomach.\nGastric ulcers are peptic ulcers in the stomach.\nDuodenal ulcers are peptic ulcers in the duodenum.\nCauses of peptic ulcers.\nMost ulcers are caused by an infection from bacteria. This bacteria is called \"Helicobacter pylori\". 90% of gastric ulcers and 75% of duodenal ulcers are from \"Helicobacter pylori\" infection.\nOther things can make ulcers worse. But these things are less important than \"Helicobacter pylori\". These other things are:\nSymptoms of peptic ulcers.\nA symptom is a change in the body that tells someone that they have a disease. The biggest symptom is pain in the stomach. Pain is usually in the top of the abdomen below the ribs. Some people also feel pain go up to the chest.\nOther symptoms are:\nDiagnosis of peptic ulcers.\nDiagnosing is how doctors see if someone has a disease. They do this by running tests. Peptic ulcers are diagnosed by three ways:\nThe best way is \"endoscopy\". But this costs more money. Endoscopy is done by a medical specialist called a \"gastroenterologist\" (a doctor who knows much about the digestive system.)\nA good thing about endoscopy is finding other diseases if there is no peptic ulcer. The symptoms of peptic ulcer can be from other diseases. Endoscopy can diagnose these other diseases.\nTreatment of peptic ulcers.\nThe most important treatment is to stop the \"Helicobacter pylori\" infection. This is usually done with antibiotics and can now also be done through the use of natural products. \nAntibiotics are medicines that kill germs like bacteria. Usually three different antibiotics are used, and because the \"Helicobacter pylori\" bacteria is so resistant, successful treatment is not guaranteed. The number of people turning to natural remedies is increasing. Natural remedies have none of the side effects common to antibiotic treatment.\nIt is also important to make less acid in the stomach. There are two types of medicines that Doctors normally prescribe to stop the acid. These are called \"antacids\":\nBoth of these medicines make the cells in the stomach stop making acid. There is a problem in unnaturally stopping the production of acid, because acid is vital to ensure proper digestion of foods. When a patient stops taking antacids, the stomach naturally starts producing acid again and usually more than normal because the antacids had unnaturally stopped this process. The result is that there is now too much acid, the whole problem starts again. It is considered better and safer to control acid levels by consuming water and by eliminating foods that may cause excessive acid. \nTo stop peptic ulcers people must use antacids \"and\" antibiotics, or a natural product. The strategy is to kill off the \"Helicobacter pylori\". Controlling the acid levels let the open ulcers in the stomach lining heal quicker.\nOnce the \"Helicobacter pylori\" infection is removed, the ulcer should heal. It can come back if the person is reinfected with \"Helicobacter pylori\" again."}

Sometimes doctors can diagnose a sickness by asking the person questions and looking at the person's body. Sometimes doctors do \"tests\". Tests can mean taking a small bit of blood, urine, or tissue which is sent to a hospital laboratory where it is tested. X-rays are another form of test. Tests are ways to see how the body is working.\nWhen a diagnosis has been made, the doctor may recommend treatment.\nProcess.\nThe process of diagnosis begins from the very beginning of the patient's examination in a medical institution or during a call to the doctor at the patient's place of residence. Diagnosis of the disease begins with the collection of medical history. After collecting the anamnesis, the doctor examines the patient, during which he performs percussion and auscultation of the patient, palpation of the disease, measures the patient's blood pressure, heart rate and respiration rate, and measures the patient's body temperature.\nLaboratory examination methods include general clinical tests, which include a general blood test, a general urine test, and a stool test. Laboratory methods of examination also include biochemical methods of examination, during which the level of glucose, creatinine, urea, bilirubin, liver enzymes, blood lipids is determined; coagulogram, which analyzes the indicators of blood clotting; blood hormone tests; determination of tumor markers; tests of blood and other biological materials for infectious diseases; allergological, toxicological, cytological and parasitological examinations.\nInstrumental methods of examination include X-ray, endoscopic, ultrasound, methods of recording the electrical activity of organs (including ECG and EEG) and a number of other methods of examination.\nTo diagnose disorders of some systems and organs, methods of recording the electrical activity of organs are used, which include, in particular, ECG and EEG."}

It is known as \"Pocket Monsters\" in Japan. It is now made up of animated television programs (anime), Japanese comic books (manga), trading cards, and toys but, most importantly, the video games. There are currently 898 monsters, with \"Pok\u00e9mon Sword and shield.\" Pikachu is the most well-known. When the idea was invented, there were only 150, which was upgraded to 151 (including Mew) when the Blue version in Japan was released. In the United States and Europe, the number of Pok\u00e9mon was 151 from the beginning. There are now over 800 altogether.\nThe Pok\u00e9mon games involve making decisions about what to do and when to do it. They allow the player to catch the monsters, train them to make them better and attack other monsters so that they get better abilities and possibly evolve into different Pok\u00e9mon. It is also possible to trade Pok\u00e9mon with a friend. The Pok\u00e9mon in the battles never bleed or die; they only faint. All Pok\u00e9mon love human beings, except for Shadow Pok\u00e9mon - the doors to their hearts have been artificially closed. The game's slogan in the U.S. was \"Gotta catch 'em all!\", although now it is not used officially any more. The Japanese slogan is \"Let's get Pok\u00e9mon\" Over one hundred million (100,000,000) of the games have been sold so far, not counting the ones released for the Nintendo 64 and the Nintendo GameCube. This makes it the second best-selling video game series of all time (after Nintendo's Mario series).\nFifteen versions of the animated television series exist, from 1998 until now on Kids WB and Cartoon Network. Additionally, sixteen full-length movies have been made since 1999.\nHistory.\nThe first games, released in 1998, were \"Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue\", which became big hits and are still among the best-selling video games of all time. They followed the adventures of the player, a Pok\u00e9mon trainer who catches, raises, and battles with Pok\u00e9mon, collects badges from the 8 Gym Leaders, explores all over Kanto (the region), and trades Pok\u00e9mon with other people who have the game by using the Game Boy's Game Link Cable. Later, a sequel to \"Red\" and \"Blue\" was released: \"Pok\u00e9mon Yellow\". In this game, the player's character design is similar to Ash Ketchum (from the anime.) Also, instead of the Pok\u00e9mon given to the player at the start of \"Red\" and \"Blue\" (the player can choose Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle) in \"Yellow\" the only possible choice is Pikachu, which represents the Pok\u00e9mon Ash started with in the anime.\nWhen Nintendo realized how popular \"Red\", \"Blue\", and \"Yellow\" had become, they decided to support the production and release of more games. After \"Yellow\" came \"Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver\", released in 2000, which had a total of 251 catchable Pok\u00e9mon, as opposed to only 151 previously. A sequel to the two games was released, \"Pok\u00e9mon Crystal\", which had several new features that were not on \"Gold\" and \"Silver\": Pok\u00e9mon had animated sprites when they came into battle, there was a subplot within the games relating to the different letter shapes of the Pok\u00e9mon Unown, and there was a new building called the Battle Tower, where players could battle very strong Pok\u00e9mon to win items and set records. Once the player has beaten the Elite Four, they can go to Kanto, the region in \"Red\", \"Blue\", and \"Yellow\".\nIn 2003, \"Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire\" were released. They were the first \"Pok\u00e9mon\" games on the Game Boy Advance, and this upset many players because they could not trade Pok\u00e9mon with \"Red\", \"Blue\", \"Yellow\", \"Gold\", \"Silver\", or \"Crystal\". However, there were 135 new Pok\u00e9mon, bringing the total to 386. There were many new features, like a Pok\u00e9Nav (a new item used for many ingame tasks), many more kinds of Pok\u00e9 Balls, a far bigger region (Hoenn) than in previous games (Kanto and Johto), and a Battle Tower different from the one in \"Crystal\". Players could also create Secret Bases, small hideouts hidden in trees and rock walls.\nLater in 2004, \"Pok\u00e9mon Fire Red &amp; Leaf Green\" were released. They did not take place in a new region, and they did not have any new Pok\u00e9mon. They were simply remakes of \"Pok\u00e9mon Red &amp; Blue\", adding a new \"extra region\" called the Sevii Islands, and a few new features. However, they made it possible for players of \"Ruby\" and \"Sapphire\" to get earlier Pok\u00e9mon in their games. If a person had \"Ruby\", \"Sapphire\", \"Colosseum\", \"FireRed\", and \"LeafGreen\" (which many fans of the games did), they could have all 386 Pok\u00e9mon, which made many players happy.\nIn 2005, \"Pok\u00e9mon Emerald\" was released. It is a sequel to \"Ruby\" and \"Sapphire\". It was the first \"main\" \"Pok\u00e9mon\" game since \"Crystal\" where Pok\u00e9mon had battle animations instead of static images. There was also a new place called the Battle Frontier where players could go after they beat the Elite Four. It was similar to the Battle Tower in \"Crystal\", \"Ruby\", and \"Sapphire\", except it was eight different facilities, all with different rules. Players earned Battle Points which could be used to buy items for Secret Bases, items for Pok\u00e9mon, and other things.\nIn 2007, \"Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl\" were released. They take place in a new region called Sinnoh. They had 107 new Pok\u00e9mon, which brought the total to 493. Another noticeable difference from the previous games was that \"Diamond\" and \"Pearl\" did not capitalize all the letters in names of Pok\u00e9mon, people, towns, items, and other things that were important to the games. For example, Lugia would appear as \"LUGIA\" in previous games, but in \"Diamond\" and \"Pearl\" it would just say \"Lugia.\" This cleared up a lot of players' confusion, because many thought that a sentence like \"LUGIA is found in the WHIRL ISLANDS\" looked unusual. A sequel to \"Diamond\" and \"Pearl\", \"Pok\u00e9mon Platinum\" was released in the United States in March 2009. In May 2009 it was released in the UK.\nIn 2010, \"Pok\u00e9mon HeartGold &amp; SoulSilver\" were released. They did not take place in a new region, or have any new Pok\u00e9mon. They were simply remakes of \"Pok\u00e9mon Gold and Silver\". Like \"Pok\u00e9mon Yellow\", the player's Pok\u00e9mon can follow them. The games come with a pedometer like device, called the Pok\u00e9 Walker, that can let players walk with their Pok\u00e9mon, and gain Watts, which can be used to fight Pok\u00e9mon, or dowse for items.\nLater in 2010, \"Pok\u00e9mon Black and White\" were released. They take place in a new region called Unova. They had 156 new Pok\u00e9mon, bringing the total to 649. They introduced seasons, where areas appear differently depending on the season, and some areas can only be reached during certain seasons.\nIn 2012, \"Pok\u00e9mon Black 2 &amp; White 2\" were released. They are sequels to \"Pok\u00e9mon Black and White\". They had a number of new areas and characters, as well as characters from \"Black and White\".\nIn 2013, \"Pok\u00e9mon X &amp; Y\" were released. They are the first ever 3D games in the main \"Pok\u00e9mon\" series. They take place in a new region called Kalos. There are many new features, including the Mega Evolution, where some Pok\u00e9mon like Mewtwo, Blaziken, and Lucario are be able to evolve into stronger forms during a battle if they are holding a Mega Stone. There is also a new type called Fairy, which is strong against Dragon-type Pok\u00e9mon.\nin 2014, Pok\u00e9mon Omega Ruby &amp; Alpha Sapphire were released, which were remakes of ruby and sapphire. it added more mega evolutions, including the other hoenn starters, beedrill, Sableye, etc. tons of features were also added.\nIn 2016, Pok\u00e9mon Sun &amp; Moon were released, which introduced people to a new region, Alola. there were a total of 803 (including mythical's). however, only 403 are in the alolan pokedex, with the others being able to be transferred from past games. rotom is now your pokedex, called the rotomdex, and z moves were introduced. z moves does a lot of damage,but can only be done once per battle. gyms, and gym leaders were taken out, and were replaced with totem pokemons, and island kahunas. a lot of features were added including SOS battles, where a wild Pok\u00e9mon send out help to exactly the same Pok\u00e9mon (or evolutions) to help when weakened.\nIn 2017, Pok\u00e9mon Ultra Sun &amp; Ultra Moon were released, which was like sun &amp; moon, but more features were added. it increased the Pok\u00e9mon number to 807, and added ultra wormholes, where different Pok\u00e9mon are seen and caught, which made shiny hunting very easy and accessible."}

After he had decided not to do his \"Life in Hell\" cartoon series, he quickly sketched out his version of a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family, with Homer being named after his father. Homer's middle initial \"J,\" which was discovered to stand for \"Jay\", was a \"tribute\" to Bullwinkle J. Moose from \"Rocky and Bullwinkle\", a show Matt Groening loved as a child.

It has 20 protons and 20 electrons (if is an atom, see ion). The most common isotopes are Ca-40 and Ca-44. Its mass number is about 40.08.\nCalcium is very important in the human body, for making bones and for other purposes. \nProperties.\nPhysical properties.\nCalcium is a soft white-gray metal. It is a solid and is opaque. It is an alkaline earth metal. Its melting point is hotter than most other reactive metals. It is a little harder than lead. It has two allotropes. It does not conduct electricity as well as copper, but is much lighter in weight.\nChemical properties.\nIt reacts with water to produce hydrogen and calcium hydroxide. It reacts with water very fast when it is powdered. When it is in a chunk, it starts reacting slowly because calcium hydroxide makes a coating that does not dissolve on the calcium. If a little acid is added to calcium hydroxide, it dissolves it, making the calcium react very fast. It burns when powdered to make a reddish flame. This makes calcium oxide. It also makes calcium nitride when heated. It can react with halogens to make calcium halides like calcium chloride with chlorine. \nCalcium compounds.\nCalcium forms chemical compounds in the +2 oxidation state. Calcium compounds are colorless. Most calcium compounds are not toxic. They are needed in the human body, actually. They are unreactive as far as calcium ions go. Calcium oxide was used to make limelights, which have a flame heating calcium oxide and makes it glow very bright.\nIsotopes.\nCalcium has 6 naturally occuring isotopes (40Ca, 42Ca, 43Ca, 44Ca, 46Ca and 48Ca), of which 48Ca is very slightly radioactive with a half-life about 6.4\u00d71019\u00a0years. Traces of 41Ca, 45Ca and 47Ca are made by cosmic rays striking atoms, and are called cosmogenic nuclides. 41Ca is made by the neutron activation of 40Ca in the upper layers of the Earth's crust and has a half-life of 102,000 years. Since it decays to potassium-41, it is a critical indicator of solar system anomalies.\nCalcium-40 is the most abundant isotope (96% of all natural calcium), since it comes from radiogenic 40K, which has a half-life of 1.25 billion years. However, along with calcium-46, it is theoretically unstable but with a half-life so long it has never been observed to decay.\nOccurrence.\nIn the ground.\nCalcium is not found as a metal in the ground; it is too reactive. Calcium carbonate, also known as calcite, is the most common calcium mineral.\nCalcium in cells.\nIt is important to know how cells work. Many cells have \"calcium channels\" on their surface. These are openings where calcium ions can enter the cell. The cell is told to act and it opens the channels. Once in the cell calcium ions activates many proteins to do specific things. For example, when it goes into muscle cells, it makes them \"contract\" (shorten so the muscle pulls.) When it goes into nerve cells, it triggers electrical impulses that send a messages. When it goes into white blood cells it makes them fight germs.\nCalcium ions are important to cells, but too many calcium ions can be bad. If a cell gets more calcium ion than it needs it can die. This is why the amount of calcium ion in cells is highly regulated. Conversely, not enough calcium ion is bad. Cells must have the right amount to function properly.\nSometimes cells are unhealthy and need to die in for the body to replace them with new, healthy cells. This keeps the whole organism healthy. Cells know when they should die and can trigger reactions to end their life cycles in many ways. When this happens it is called apoptosis, also known as a 'programmed cell death' (\"planned\" cell death.) One way cells accomplish \"apoptosis\" by taking in toxic levels of calcium ions.\nCalcium is very important for the human body.\nCalcium storage.\nBones contain most of the calcium ion in the human body. If we need more calcium for our blood, muscles, or other tissue, it comes from the bones. If we have extra calcium it goes into bones.\nCalcium as an element is not found in the human body, just calcium ions in the form of chemical compounds.\nCalcium regulation.\nOrganisms need to keep calcium ion levels very well controlled. High calcium levels are bad, and low calcium levels are bad.\nThe body controls this by changing\nThe control of calcium in the body is called \"calcium metabolism\". Too little calcium can cause osteoporosis.\nThe body controls calcium levels with many hormones. Calcitonin, Parathyroid hormone (acronym PTH), and Vitamin D are the most important hormones in \"calcium metabolism\". (Vitamin D works as a hormone but it is called a vitamin.)\nPreparation.\nCalcium metal is made by electrolysis of melted calcium chloride. It has to be very hot to melt it. The calcium metal is liquid.\nUses.\nAs an element.\nCalcium is used in the reduction of other metals. It can also be used to make alloys with other metals. \nAs chemical compounds.\nCalcium compounds are also important in chemistry. It is important for making things. It is a part of cement which is needed to make concrete (a hard substance that many buildings are made from.)\nCalcium is part of calcium oxide. Calcium oxide is used to make paper, pottery, food, and to purify water (make it good to drink.) Calcium carbonate is used as a calcium supplement. Calcium permanganate can be used as a rocket propellant.\nSafety.\nCalcium is toxic as an element. It reacts with water and makes a strong base, calcium hydroxide. Calcium compounds are not toxic unless the anion is toxic. Calcium permanganate is only toxic because of the permanganate, not the calcium. Like other alkaline earth metals calcium burns easily and brightly."}

He wrote many books, poems and plays, some of which are still liked today. A lot of his work was against France and the Church. This meant that he was unpopular at first but became more popular towards the time of the French Revolution. He also studied science and wrote a lot about people and places he knew. His writings later led to the Terror of the French revolution, where there was no liberty and the population was condemned on a whim of the political leaders. \nVoltaire believed in a God but did not believe in a God personally involved in people's lives, like the Christian God. This is called Deism. When he died in Paris, Voltaire was not allowed to be buried in a church because he did not believe in the Christian God."}

The Wimbledon Championships, a tennis competition, is held there every summer. Also in Wimbledon are New Wimbledon Theatre, and Wimbledon Common, one of the largest areas of common land in London. Wimbledon F.C., a famous football club, started in Wimbledon, then moved to Milton Keynes and changed their name to Milton Keynes Dons F.C. however after this move AFC Wimbledon was created and now plays at Kings medow in Kingston. People live in two different areas. The High Street area is called the \"village\", and the area near the railway station is called the \"town\". The High Street area is part of the original Middle Ages village, and the \"town\" area is modern - houses were first built there in 1838.\nHistory.\nPeople are known to have lived in Wimbledon since the Iron Age when the hill fort on Wimbledon Common was built. At the time the Domesday Book was written (about 1087), Wimbledon belonged to the lord of the manor of Mortlake. The ownership of the manor of Wimbledon changed between various rich families many times during its history, and the area also attracted other wealthy families who built large houses such as Eagle House, Wimbledon House and Warren House. The people in the village were either poor people who worked on the land or they were rich and important people. The rich and poor people lived together happily. In the 18th century the Dog and Fox public house became a stop on the stagecoach run from London to Portsmouth, then in 1838 the London and South Western Railway (L&amp;SWR) opened a station to the south east of the village at the bottom of Wimbledon hill. After the station was built, new houses were built near to it, and many people began living near the station. In the second half of the 19th century the number of people living in Wimbledon grew quickly. At the start of the 19th century there were about 1,000 people living in Wimbledon; then in 1911 there were about 55,000 people. During this time large numbers of villas and terraced houses were built out along the roads from the centre towards neighbouring Putney, Merton Park and Raynes Park.\nGeography.\nWimbledon lies in the south west area of London, south of Wandsworth, and east of Kingston upon Thames on the outskirts of Greater London. It is south-west of the centre of London at Charing Cross. It is considered an rich suburb with a mix of grand Victorian houses, modern housing and low rise apartments. The residential area is split into two sections known as the village and the town, with the village around the High Street being part of the original medieval village, and now a prime residential area of London commanding high prices, and the \"town\" being part of the modern development since the building of the railway station in 1838.\nThe area is identified in the London Plan as one of 35 major centres in Greater London.\nThe population consists around 57,000 adults, the majority in the ABC1 social group. The population grew from around 1,000 at the start of the 19th century to around 55,000 in 1911, a figure which has remained reasonably stable since.\nGovernance.\nOriginally Wimbledon had its own borough of Wimbledon and was within the county of Surrey; it was absorbed into the London Borough of Merton as part of the creation of Greater London in 1965. It is in the Parliamentary constituency of Wimbledon, and since 2005 it has been represented by Conservative MP Stephen Hammond.\nWimbledon Football Club.\nWimbledon Football Club was began in Wimbledon in 1889. In 2002 it moved to Milton Keynes and it 2004 it changed its name to Milton Keynes Dons F.C. Many football fans in Wimbledon did not agree with the move. They decided to start a new club there, which is called AFC Wimbledon.\nThe club played in the English Football League and won the FA Cup in 1988. It was a professional football club, which means that the players get paid to play."}

It does not have 4 wheels like a car. It has 2 wheels like a bicycle. But it has a motor like a car. A motorcycle is usually driven by one person. A passenger can also ride on the back of the motorcycle. Some motorcycles have a sidecar that can carry another passenger.\nIn 1901, the first successful motorcycle was made by \"Indian motorcycles\" in Springfield, Massachusetts. Since then, many other companies have made them. Major manufacturers include Honda, Suzuki, Yamaha. A well known American manufacturer of motorcycles is Harley-Davidson.\nSince motorcycles can be lighter than cars, they can accelerate more quickly. But it also makes them not as safe as cars, because they do not have a protecting chassis around them like cars. Very often motorcycle riders are injured heavily in accidents. A motorcycle rider can wear a helmet and clothing that has armor. This special clothing may reduce the rider's injuries in an accident. Motorcycles also do not protect riders against wind and rain. That makes it difficult to drive in winter or during bad weather.\nIn poor countries, motorcycles are used by many as a cheap method of transportation. Many people who do not have the money to buy a car can afford a small motorcycle. In rich countries, large powerful motorcycles are used more as a hobby or sport. \nOff road.\nOn-road bikes (ones that are allowed on public roads) require the rider to have a special type of driver's license to be ridden legally. Off-road bikes are not allowed to be driven on public roads.\nSpeed and stunts are the main goals for off-road bike sports. Many on-road bikes are much faster than off-road bikes and can be used in sports such as motorbike racing.\nMotocross is a form of motorcycle racing. It is on an off-road circuit. The sport came from motorcycle trials competitions held in the United Kingdom."}

They are domesticated animals which originated in the Andes. \nStudies on biochemistry and hybridization suggest they are descendants of a closely related species of cavy. They do not occur naturally in the wild.\nGuinea pigs as pets.\nIn many parts of the world, people keep them as pets. In Peru, Bolivia, and several other countries, they are raised for food. The first people who domesticated the animals, did it for food. Besides being a pet and a source of food, in some places people think guinea pigs keep bad spirits away. In Quechua, the language of some the native tribes of Peru, they are called \"\". The Spanish-speaking people of the region call them \"cuy\" (plural: \"cuyes\").\nName.\nThis perception of pigginess occurred in many languages other than English; the German word for them is \"Meerschweinchen\", literally \"little sea pigs\" (sailing ships stopping to reprovision in the New World would pick up stores of guinea pigs, which provided an easily transportable source of fresh meat), the Russian and Polish word for them is similar, \"morskaya svinka\" (\u041c\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0432\u0438\u043d\u043a\u0430) and \"\u015bwinka morska\" respectively, meaning also \"little sea pig\" (it comes from archaic use of the word to mean \"overseas\"). However, this perception of pigginess is not universal to all languages or cultures. For example, the common Spanish term is 'conejillo de Indias' (Indian bunny rabbit).\nHousing and breeding guinea pigs.\nGuinea pigs need large open air cages in which to romp and frolic. They should have a diet of 1/8 cup of high quality grass-based guinea-pig pellets daily, as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. They should also have unlimited grass hay, and at least one cup of a variety of veggies. Guinea pigs like to be held in hand.\nGuinea pigs should be kept in cages larger than 7.5 square feet or 10.5 square feet for 2 pigs. They should always have a friend as guinea pigs are social animals.\nBreeding guinea pigs are not recommended as the rate of pregnancy complications is high.\nFor their diet guinea pigs generally prefer fresh fruits and vegetables.\nOther uses of the term.\nGuinea pig is also slang for a person who is the first to try something. It can also mean the subject of an experiment. This is because guinea pigs are used by biologists as model organisms."}

It can be living (biotic) or non-living (abiotic) things. It includes physical, chemical and other natural forces. Living things live in their environment. They constantly interact with it and adapt themselves to conditions in their environment. In the environment there are different interactions between animals, plants, soil, water, and other living and non-living things.\nSince everything is part of the environment of something else, the word \"environment\" is used to talk about many things. People in different fields of knowledge use the word environment differently. Electromagnetic environment is radio waves and other electromagnetic radiation and magnetic fields. The environment of galaxy refers to conditions of interstellar medium.\nIn psychology and medicine, a person's environment is the people, physical things and places that the person lives with. The environment affects the growth and development of the person. It affects the person's behavior, body, mind and heart. \nThe living conditions of living organisms in an environment are affected by the weather or climate changes in the environment.\nNatural environment.\nIn biology and ecology, the environment is all of the natural materials and living things, If those things are natural, it is a natural environment.\nEnvironment includes the living and nonliving things that an organism interacts with, or has an effect on it. Living elements that an organism interacts with are known as biotic elements: animals, plants, etc., abiotic elements are non living things which include air, water, sunlight etc. Studying the environment means studying the relationships among these various things. An example of interactions between non-living and living things is plants getting their minerals from the soil and making food using sunlight. Predation, an organism eating another, is an example of interaction between living things.\nSome people call themselves environmentalists. They think we must protect the natural environment, to keep it safe. Things in the natural environment that we value are called natural resources. For example; fish, insects, and forests. These are renewable resources because they come back naturally when we use them. Non-renewable resources are important things in the environment that are limited for example, ores and fossil fuels after a few thousand years. Some things in the natural environment can kill people, such as lightning."}

Teeth (plural) are used to help the mastication process by chewing food. \"Chew\" means to break up and crush food so it can be swallowed (pushed down into the stomach). \nMost vertebrates have teeth. Birds are the biggest group that do not. Many invertebrates have mouthparts which, to some extent, act like teeth. Different animals have different kinds of teeth because they eat different foods. Some animals use teeth as a weapon. Human adults usually have 32 teeth. Human children usually have 20 teeth.\nNatal teeth.\nSome human babies are born with teeth. Natal teeth are teeth that are present at birth. These are different from neonatal teeth which are teeth that emerge during the first month of life. Natal teeth are not common. They occur in about 1 out of every 2\u20133 thousand births. They are usually found on the lower jaw. Natal teeth are usually not well attached and may easily wobble.\nTeeth eruption.\nDeciduous teeth or milk teeth or temporary teeth are the first set of teeth for most mammals. Humans have 20 of them. The first teeth (called \"primary teeth\") start to \"erupt\" (come through the gums of the jaw) when a baby is about 6 months old. When these teeth erupt it can really hurt. Babies chew on things to make the pain better. This is called \"teething\" (verb: \"to teethe\"). Most children have all 20 teeth by two or three years of age. \nAt age 6\u20137 the permanent teeth start to erupt. By the age of 11\u201312 most children have 28 adult teeth. The last four teeth, called 'wisdom teeth' or third molars come in by age 17\u201321 in most people. Some people never grow wisdom teeth. Or they may have only two instead of four.\nTeeth structure.\nThe outside white part of teeth is called the \"enamel\". The enamel is made of calcium phosphate and is very hard. Under the enamel is the dentine. The dentine is softer than the hard enamel. So it is hurt more by tooth decay (cavities). Under the dentine is the \"pulp\" which has the nerves and blood vessels that go to the tooth. This is the part that causes the pain of a toothache. \"Cementum\" is outside the dentine where there is no enamel. Cementum holds the tooth to the bone of the jaw.\nHealthy teeth.\nIf they are protected and kept clean, teeth should stay for a person's whole life. Many people lose their teeth early because they do not do the right things to keep teeth healthy. \nSome things people can do to keep teeth healthy:\nDisease of teeth.\nPlaque is the soft white substance that forms on teeth when they are not cleaned. It has bacteria in it that hurt enamel. If plaque is not cleaned off, after 2 days it can become tartar. Tartar is a hard substance that forms on teeth (mostly near the gums). Tartar makes gums unhealthy and makes more bacteria grow on the teeth.\nPlaque is cleaned off with a toothbrush. If tartar forms on teeth, a dentist must clean it off. \nThe bacteria that are on teeth eat into the enamel. Cleaning and flossing teeth, eating good foods, and having a dentist take off plaque make less bacteria on teeth. If there is too much bacteria, they eat enamel faster than teeth make enamel. This makes holes in enamel called cavities. When a person gets cavities, he has the disease dental caries. Making cavities in enamel happens slowly. But once cavities go through enamel, the soft dentine is hurt much faster. Cavities may be fixed by dentists."}

Deep Purple are one of the pioneering bands and founders of the hard rock and heavy metal genre. \nHistory.\nForming, and Mark I (1967 - 1969).\nIn 1967, a drummer called Chris Curtis was putting a new band together, where members would only be part of it when it suited them (or would \"get on and off\"). Because of this format, the band was called Roundabout. The first musicians to be hired were guitar player Ritchie Blackmore and keyboard player Jon Lord. Curtis behaved in a disorderly way, and so was fired from his own project. Blackmore and Lord wanted to continue, and so finished putting the band together themselves, with singer Rod Evans, bass player Nick Simper, and drummer Ian Paice. They renamed the band \"Deep Purple\" after a song Blackmore's mother liked, disliking the name \"Roundabout\".\nThis band lineup, known as \"Mark I\", released three albums, called \"Shades of Deep Purple\" (1968), \"The Book of Taliesyn\" (1968) and a self-titled (1969). They released a fairly popular single called \"Hush\", thought to be radio friendly in America, but, apart from that, did not have any success. Eventually, Blackmore and Lord decided to change the style of music the band would play from soft progressive rock to hard rock. While Ian Paice agreed to the change, they decided Evans and Simper would not fit this new style, and were let go from the band.\nMark II and success (1969 - 1973).\nThe band found a new singer called Ian Gillan and a new bass player called Roger Glover, forming Mark II. Jon Lord used to play in orchestras, and at this time, wanted to go back to them and base the Deep Purple sound around that. Whilst the band did perform as an orchestra (with new singer Ian Gillan writing lyrics) gaining the band some publicity, Gillan and Blackmore were not happy about the band being associated with orchestras, and were firm about Deep Purple being a hard rock band, though Jon Lord would write another orchestral piece for the band.\nThe band eventually got back to their plans of playing hard rock, and released \"Deep Purple in Rock\" in 1970, which became a big success. The famous album cover shows the band members' faces engraved into Mount Rushmore. The album itself had popular songs such as \"Speed King\" \"Child in Time\" and \"Bloodsucker\" (which was later re-recorded by the band in 1998). Critics and fans were pleased with new singer Ian Gillan's high pitched singing and screaming, and the album has since been considered a classic of the time, along with Black Sabbath's \"Paranoid\" and Led Zeppelin's \"Led Zeppelin II\".\nThe band followed \"In Rock\" up with \"Fireball\" in 1971, which did show hints of creative progressive rock but was still as heavy as the last album. Just weeks later, the band started working on the next album, which would become \"Machine Head\". An incident at a Frank Zappa &amp; the Mothers of Invention concert would inspire the band to write their most popular song, \"Smoke on the Water\" which ended up on the album. \"Machine Head\", released in 1972, was another success and featured several other popular songs like \"Highway Star\" and \"Space Truckin'\".\nMark II's last album was \"Who Do We Think We Are\" in 1973, and it featured another hit song for the band, \"Woman from Tokyo\". Ian Gillan left the band that year as he did not like the band's touring and recording schedule, because at the time he wanted a break. He was also arguing with Ritchie Blackmore. Roger Glover left shortly after, also because of arguing with Blackmore.\nMarks III and IV (1973 - 1976).\nDavid Coverdale and Glenn Hughes were hired to replace Ian Gillan and Roger Glover. Glenn Hughes also had singing talent so it was decided he would act as lead singer on some of the band's songs too. In fact, since Hughes was hired first, the band considered performing as a 4-piece from then on, with Hughes singing full-time as well as playing bass.\nMark III's first album, \"Burn\", released in 1974, was successful and seemed to point a positive picture for the band's future without Gillan or Glover. The singing harmonies from Coverdale and Hughes had something of a blues and funk style to them. These styles were explored more on the band's next album, \"Stormbringer\", released later the same year. Ritchie Blackmore left after he became more unhappy with this style of music, feeling it was just \"shoeshine music\".\nAlthough many fans were wondering if Deep Purple could carry on without Blackmore, who had been their highly regarded guitar player from their formation up until this point, they chose to continue, and hired American guitar player Tommy Bolin (forming mark IV). The next album, \"Come Taste The Band\", showed Bolin bringing a further funk influence into the band's music, having a more creative output than Blackmore did when he left the band.\nBreakup, and other projects (1976 - 1984).\nIan Paice and Jon Lord, the last remaining founding members, agreed to end Deep Purple in 1976 after touring was over, but did not inform any other members. Shortly after, Coverdale informed them he was leaving the band, and only then did Jon Lord tell him: \"David, there's no band to leave!\" Glenn Hughes and Tommy Bolin were excited about the next Deep Purple album before they too were told that Paice and Lord had ended the band.\nDavid Coverdale started a band of his own called Whitesnake, and Ian Paice and Jon Lord were members for a period of time. Ian Gillan had been performing in a solo band since he left in 1973. Ritchie Blackmore had started a band called Rainbow after leaving in 1975, releasing some successful albums with Ronnie James Dio as lead singer, who would carry on his fame in Black Sabbath and Dio (his own solo band). However, Tommy Bolin would only release one more solo album before he died in 1976, due to drug use.\nRod Evans put together a band and tried to perform as \"Deep Purple\", advertising it as a reunion although he was the only member who had ever been part of the band during its initial time together. Legal action was taken against him by the real representatives of Deep Purple, who sued him for using the band name without permission.\nMark II reformations and Marks V and VI (1984 - 1994).\nA real Deep Purple reunion happened in 1984 when the Mark II lineup got back together, and released the album \"Perfect Strangers\" that same year. It sold very well and was well received from fans who were excited about the return of the band's iconic lineup. The songs \"Knockin' At Your Back Door\" and \"Perfect Strangers\" were popular. The band also enjoyed success on tour.\n\"The House of Blue Light\" was the next album to come from the band, in 1987. Some fans noticed that the band sounded more \"modern\" on this album than before, which led to mixed opinions. A new version of the band's 1968 minor hit \"Hush\" was re-recorded in 1988 by the Mark II lineup to mark the 20th anniversary of Deep Purple. However, Ian and Ritchie started arguing again over the future of the band, and their differences had torn their working relationship too far apart, meaning Gillan was fired in 1989. Blackmore seemed to want to make the band sound more commercial (something he had tried to do with his band Rainbow back in the early 1980s). He hired Joe Lynn Turner (also a former Rainbow singer) to replace Gillan, and the Mark V band released \"Slaves and Masters\" in 1990.\nHowever, the band's popularity was declining, and Turner was forced out in 1992 by the record company, who wanted the iconic lineup with Gillan back for the band's 25th anniversary. And so, the Mark II lineup released one more album together in 1993 called \"The Battle Rages On...\". However, during the tour, audience attendances were getting lower, and problems between band members arose, with Ritchie Blackmore walking out on the band for good. Joe Satriani filled in for the rest of the tour, but did not become a full-time member afterwards, due to his label commitments. The band decided to hire American Steve Morse in 1994.\nRevival with Steve Morse and Jon Lord's retirement (Marks VII and VIII) (1994 - present).\nWith Steve Morse in the band, Deep Purple enjoyed renewed success on tour. Ian Gillan was especially pleased that Ritchie Blackmore was no longer in the band, as he felt his departure saved them from a breakup. Since 1994, Deep Purple have enjoyed more success touring than with their studio albums, although their material written with Morse has received good reviews, with fans and critics feeling the band has more creativity again. Mark VII released two albums, \"Purpendicular\" (1996) and \"Abandon\" (1998), before Jon Lord retired in 2002, feeling the need to step down from the band's hard touring schedule. He was replaced by Don Airey.\nOver the next few years, Deep Purple released two more albums, \"Bananas\" (2003) and \"Rapture of the Deep\" (2005). Their next tour, the \"Rapture of the Deep tour\" started in 2006, and finished in 2011, making it their longest tour to date. In 2012, Jon Lord died after battling cancer at the age of 71. The band continue to record as well as tour, and released their nineteenth and latest album, \"Now What?!\", in 2013.\nBand members.\nLineups.\nIan Paice is the only member to be in all of the band's lineups.\nMark I (1) (1968 - 1969):\nThe first complete lineup of the band. They released a single that was fairly successful in America called \"Hush\". Rod Evans and Nick Simper were fired as the other members wanted to play heavier rock music and did not think they would play this style of music well.\nMark II (2) (1969 - 1973, 1984 - 1989, 1992 - 1993):\nThis is the band's most famous lineup, releasing albums such as \"Deep Purple in Rock\" and songs such as \"Smoke on the Water\". In 1973, Ian Gillan left the band as he did not like the band's touring and recording schedule, because at the time he wanted a break. He was also arguing with Ritchie Blackmore. Roger Glover left shortly after, also because of arguing with Blackmore.\nIn 1984, this lineup of the band got back together. However, Ian and Ritchie started arguing again over the future of the band, meaning Gillan was fired in 1989. He rejoined in 1992, bringing this band lineup together for the third time, although Blackmore left a year later, this time, for good.\nMark III (3) (1973 - 1975):\nDavid Coverdale and Glenn Hughes were hired to replace Ian Gillan and Roger Glover. Glenn Hughes also had singing talent so it was decided he would act as lead singer on some of the band's songs too. Ritchie Blackmore left after he became more unhappy with the style of music of the band, which was more funk rock at this time.\nMark IV (4) (1975 - 1976):\nAfter making the hard decision to carry the band on without Blackmore, the band hired American guitar player Tommy Bolin and carried on the funk-rock music style Blackmore was unhappy about.\nMark V (5) (1989 - 1992)\nRitchie Blackmore had before played with Joe Lynn Turner in Blackmore's solo band called Rainbow, and suggested he join the band to replace Ian Gillan, who was brought back 3 years later because of record label pressures, as the band's 25th anniversary was coming up and they wanted the iconic Mark II lineup together again.\nMark VI (6) (1993 - 1994):\nThe band still needed to play concerts after Ritchie Blackmore, so they hired American guitar player Joe Satriani, although he did not stay with the band after the tour.\nMark VII (7) (1994 - 2002):\nJoe Satriani turned down the chance to be a member of Deep Purple, so the band found another American guitar player called Steve Morse. In 2002, Jon Lord retired from the band after 26 years with them (not counting the 8 years the band was split up) leaving Ian Paice as the only founding member left. He was replaced with Don Airey.\nMark VIII (8) (2002 - present)\nThis has remained the lineup since Jon Lord's departure from Deep Purple and the hiring of Don Airey to replace him."}

The lactose in the milk becomes lactic acid when it is fermented. Lactic acid acts on the protein in the milk to make yoghurt thick and sour. The milk is heated to about 80 \u00b0C to kill any bacteria present, and to change the milk proteins so that they set together instead of becoming curd. After it is cooled to about 45 \u00b0C, the bacteria culture is added, and the milk is kept at that temperature for 4 to 7 hours to ferment. Yogurt can also be made from plant milks such as almond milk, soy milk, and coconut milk.\nYogurt is one of the oldest produced foods in human history. No one knows for sure how long yogurt has been around. Today, it is eaten all over the world. It is rich in protein, calcium, riboflavin, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12.\nSpelling.\nYogurt derives romfrom the Turkish word yo\u011furt and in English, the word can be spelled either 'yogurt' or 'yoghurt'. In Canada 'yogourt' is also common. It can be spoken with either a short or a long 'o'.\nHistory.\nThe earliest yogurts were probably made by wild bacteria (yeast infections) and happened by chance.\nThe oldest writings mentioning yogurt were by Pliny the Elder, who said that some people knew how to thicken the milk into something which was sour but tasty. \nStamen Grigorov (1878\u20131945), a Bulgarian student of medicine in Geneva, first examined the bacteria in Bulgarian yogurt. In 1905 he said that it contained a round and a rod-like lactic acid-producing bacteria. In 1907 the rod-like bacteria was called \"Lactobacillus bulgaricus\" (now \"Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus\"). The Russian Nobel laureate biologist Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov, from the Pasteur Institute in Paris, was influenced by Grigorov's work and made a hypothesis that eating yoghurt regularly was the reason why Bulgarian peasants lived for so long. Mechnikov believed that \"Lactobacillus\" was needed for good health, and worked to make yoghurt popular through Europe.\nNutrition.\nYoghurt has a lot of protein, calcium, riboflavin, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 in it. It is healthier than milk is. Many people who are lactose-intolerant can enjoy yoghurt, because much of the lactose in the milk has been changed into lactic acid.\nYoghurt also has medical uses, such as preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea."}

{"id": "13707", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13707", "title": "Vaccine", "text": "A vaccine is an invented preparation. It is given to prevent a specific infectious disease. It only protects against the particular microorganism which it is prepared for. It is usually given by an injection called vaccination. At its best, It gives immunity to an infectious disease caused by a particular microorganism (bacteria or virus). For example, the flu vaccine makes it very much less likely that a person will get the flu. \nAt first, vaccines were usually made from something that is alive, or was alive. Now they may be built up by viral biochemistry. Each vaccine has its own history, and what is true of one might not be true of another.\nThe word \"vaccine\" comes from the Latin words \"vacc\u012bn-us\" (from the word \"vacca\", meaning \"cow\"). In 1796, Edward Jenner used a milkmaid infected with cowpox (\"variolae vaccinae\") to protect people against smallpox. The use of vaccines is called vaccination.\nHistory.\nScientist Edward Jenner created the first vaccine in the 1770s. At this time, smallpox was a deadly disease. Jenner noticed that people who had already had cowpox (a disease that is related to smallpox) usually did not get smallpox. He thought that getting cowpox protected people against smallpox.\nTo test this idea, Jenner gave a boy cowpox. Then he infected the boy with smallpox. The boy did not get sick because he had already had cowpox. Jenner was right: having cowpox protected people against smallpox.\nBecause cowpox inoculation made fewer people sick than smallpox inoculation, England made smallpox inoculation illegal in 1840. In 1853, they made another law that said every child had to be vaccinated against smallpox using Jenner's vaccine.\nIn the 19th century, Louis Pasteur made a rabies vaccine.\nIn the 20th century, scientists created vaccines to protect people against diphtheria, measles, mumps, and rubella. In the 1950s, Jonas Salk created the polio vaccine.\nHowever, vaccines still do not exist for many important diseases, like malaria and HIV.\nMany countries have passed \"compulsory vaccination laws\" \u2013 laws that require certain people to get vaccinated. For example, in many countries, children have to be vaccinated against certain diseases in order to go to public school.\nTypes of vaccines.\nThere are many different types of vaccines.\nOne common type of vaccine is a \"live vaccine.\" This type of vaccine contains a small amount of a live virus or bacteria. Before the vaccine is given, scientists weaken the virus or bacteria so it cannot make a person sick. When a person gets a live vaccine, their immune system learns to recognize and fight off that virus or bacteria. Then, if the person is exposed to the virus or bacteria in the future, their immune system will already \"know\" how to fight it off. Examples of live vaccines include vaccines for measles, mumps, and chickenpox.\nAnother common type of vaccine is an \"inactivated vaccine.\" These vaccines contain dead viruses or bacteria. These do not cause the immune system to react as strongly as live vaccines. Because of this, people may need \"booster shots\" \u2013 extra doses of the vaccine, given at certain times, so their immune system can \"learn\" how to fight off the infection. Examples of inactivated vaccines include vaccines for pertussis (whooping cough), rabies, and hepatitis B.\nIn other vaccines, only a protein molecule from the virus or bacterium is injected into the patient. The protein is enough for the patient's immune system to recognize the whole germ.\nWith messenger RNA vaccines, only the messenger RNA (mRNA), which acts as a blueprint or recipe for the protein, is injected into the patient. The first mRNA vaccines were made in the 1990s, but scientists did not make large numbers of them until the 2010s. Some mRNA vaccines work against cancer and can make tumors smaller. \nScientists can make some types of vaccines in a laboratory.\nEffectiveness.\nVaccines do not guarantee complete protection from a disease. In other words, a person can get a disease that they were vaccinated against.\nSometimes, this happens because the person's immune system did not respond to the vaccine (it did not \"learn\" how to fight off the disease after the person got the vaccine). This may happen because the person's immune system is already weak (for example, because of diabetes, HIV infection, old age, or steroid use). It may also happen because the person's immune system cannot make the particular B cells which make the antibodies that stick to the pathogen.\nSome vaccines work better than others at protecting people from diseases. There are many reasons for this:\nControversy.\nSince vaccines first existed, there have been people who did not agree with the idea of using vaccines. Around the world, most scientists and doctors agree that the benefits of using vaccines are much greater than the risks. The adverse effects from vaccines are rare. Not vaccinating people is a much greater risk, because vaccines prevent suffering and death from infectious diseases.\nThere have been controversies over using vaccines such as whether vaccines are safe, the amount of research and whether it is morally right to force people to get vaccinated.\nSome religious groups do not allow uses of vaccines.\nSome political groups argue that people should be able to choose whether or not to get vaccinated. They argue that laws requiring people to get vaccinated violate individual rights. In response, one study says: \"Vaccine refusal not only increases the individual risk of disease but also increases the risk for the whole community\".\nSome parents choose not to follow the regular vaccine schedule for their children. One study looked at parents of children ages six months to six years old. It found that 13% of these parents reported following an alternative vaccination schedule. However, of these parents, less than 1 out of every 5 reported refusing all vaccines. Most refused only certain vaccines, and/or delayed some vaccines until the child was older.\nParents who delay vaccines until their children are older are often concerned about their child's immune system being too young and weak to handle getting many vaccines at once.\nEconomics of development and patents.\nOne challenge in developing vaccines is economic. The diseases that most need vaccines today \u2013 HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis \u2013 exist mostly in poor countries. Companies that make vaccines would not make much money because many of the people who need them are too poor to pay for them. There would also be financial and other risks to these companies if they tried making new vaccines for these diseases.\nThroughout history, most vaccines have been developed by governments, universities, and non-profit organizations. Many vaccines have been highly cost-effective and good for public health. In recent decades, the number of vaccines given throughout the world has increased dramatically. This increase, particularly in the number of different vaccines given to children before they start school, may be due to laws and support from governments.\nAnother obstacle to making new vaccines is that when a new vaccine is made, the maker usually files a patent on their vaccine. These patents can limit the process used to make the vaccine to the maker (in practice the right can be subcontracted). That way the patent makes money for the originator.\nAdditional components in vaccines.\nVaccines often contain other things besides the active vaccine (the weakened or dead virus or bacteria). For example, vaccines may contain:\nPreservatives in vaccines, such as thiomersal, phenoxyethanol, and formaldehyde, prevent serious adverse effects. Thiomersal is more effective against bacteria, lasts longer in storage, and makes the vaccine stronger, safer, and more stable (less likely to be changed by things like heat). However, in the United States, the European Union, and a few other developed countries, it is no longer used as a preservative in childhood vaccines because it contains mercury. Some people have argued that thimerosal contributes to autism. However, there is no convincing scientific evidence for this opinion.\nIf no preservative is added to a vaccine, harmful bacteria may grow in the vaccine. For example, in 1928, \"Staphylococcus\" bacteria grew in a diphtheria vaccine that had no preservative in it. Of 21 children who got that vaccine, 12 died.\nMost versions of anti-coronavirus are kept at very low temperature before use. That helps preserve the vaccine in its most effective state.\nUse in veterinary medicine.\nAnimals are vaccinated to keep them from getting diseases, and to keep them from infecting humans with diseases. Pets as well as livestock are routinely vaccinated.\nIn some instances, populations of wild animals may be vaccinated. Sometimes, wild animals are vaccinated by spreading vaccine-laced food in a disease-prone area. This method has been used to try to control rabies in raccoons. Where rabies occurs, laws may require dogs to get rabies vaccinations.\nDogs can also be vaccinated against many other diseases, including canine distemper, canine parvovirus, infectious canine hepatitis, adenovirus-2, leptospirosis, bordatella, canine parainfluenza virus, and Lyme disease.\nSeveral trends in vaccine development.\nScientists are also working on vaccines against many noninfectious human diseases, such as cancers and autoimmune disorders. For example, the experimental vaccine CYT006-AngQb has been investigated as a possible treatment for high blood pressure."}

The name \"record label\" is from the paper label at the center of a gramophone record (what is also known as a \"phonograph record\" in American English). \nMost major record labels are owned by a few large multinational companies (Big Four record labels) that make up the almost all of the global recording industry, although there is a recent resurgence in independent record labels.\nLabels as brands.\nRecording companies often spend a lot of time and money in discovering new musicians or developing the talent of artists they already have signed up with a contract. The association of the brand with the artists helps define the image of both the brand and the artist.\nIn spite of the fact that both parties need each other to survive, the relationship between record labels and artists can, at times, be a difficult one. Many artists have had albums changed or censored in some way by the labels before they are released\u2014songs being edited, artwork or titles being changed, etc. Record labels generally do this because they believe that the album will sell better if the changes are made. Often the record label's decisions are correct ones from a commercial perspective, but this typically frustrates the artist who feels that their artwork is being destroyed. \nIn the early days of the recording industry, record labels were absolutely necessary for the success of any artist. The first goal of any new artist or band was to get signed to a contract as soon as possible. In the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, many artists were so desperate to sign a contract with a record company that they usually ended up signing a bad contract, sometimes giving away the rights to their music in the process. Entertainment lawyers are used by some to look over any contract before it is signed.\nIndustry consolidation.\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, there was a phase of consolidation in the record industry that led to almost all major labels being owned by a very few multinational companies, who in turn were members of the RIAA.\nThe resurgence of independent labels.\nIn the 1990s, due to the widespread use of home studios, consumer CD recorders, and the Internet, independent labels began to become more commonplace. Independent labels are typically artist-owned (although not always), with a focus usually on making good music and not necessarily on the business aspects of the industry or making lots of money. Because of this, independent artists usually receive less radio play and sell fewer CDs than artists signed to major labels. However, they usually have more control over the music and packaging of the released product.\nOn occasion established artists, once their record contract has finished, move to an independent label. This often gives the combined advantage of name recognition and more control over one's music. Singers Dolly Parton, Aimee Mann and Prince, among others, have achieved this. \nWhile there are many independent labels, folk singer Ani DiFranco's Righteous Babe Records is often cited as an ideal example. The singer turned down lucrative contracts from several top-name labels in order to establish her own New-York-based company. Constant touring resulted in noteworthy success for an act without significant major funding. Ani and others from the company have spoken on several occasions about their business model in hopes of encouraging others. \nSome independent labels become successful enough that major record companies negotiate contracts to either distribute music for the label or in some cases, purchase the label completely. \nOn the punk rock scene, the DIY punk ethic encourages bands to self-publish and self-distribute. This approach has been around since the early 1980s, in an attempt to stay true to the punk ideals of doing it yourself and not selling out to corporate profits and control. Such labels have a reputation for being fiercely uncompromising and especially unwilling to cooperate with the Big Five record labels at all.\nThe emergence of net labels.\n\"Main Article:\" net label\nWith the Internet now being a viable source for music, net labels emerge. Depending on the ideals of the net label, music files from the artists may be downloaded free of charge or for a fee that is paid via PayPal or an online payment system. Some of these labels also offer hard copy CDs in addition to direct download (for example, Baltimore's Schismatik record label ships CDs for a nominal charge). Most net labels acknowledge the Creative Commons licensing system thus reserving certain rights for the artist.\nThe emergence of open-source labels.\n\"Main Article:\" Open source record label\nThe new century brings the phenomenon of \"open-source\" or \"open-content\" record label. These are inspired by the free software and open-source movement and the success of GNU/Linux. \nExamples are"}

Their main purpose is to help us to move our body parts. They are one of the major systems of human and animal bodies. When a muscle is activated it contracts, making itself shorter and thicker, thereby pulling its ends closer. \nTypes of muscles.\nThere are three kinds of muscles:\nMuscle action can be classified as being either \"voluntary\" or \"involuntary\".\nThe skeletal muscles move the limbs (arms and legs). They move the jaw up and down so that food can be chewed. Skeletal muscles are the only \"voluntary\" muscles, the only ones that we can choose to move.\nThe cardiac muscle is the muscle in the heart. When this muscle contracts it pushes blood through the circulatory system. The cardiac muscle is \"not\" voluntary. \nThe smooth muscles are the other muscles in the body that are involuntary. Smooth muscles are in many places. They are in:\nMuscle structure.\nMuscles are made of many muscle cells. The cells contract together to make the muscle get shorter. The muscle cells know to do this together because many of them get information sent to them by nerves. The cells that get the message from nerves tell other cells that are near them. They tell the other cells by sending an electrical current.\nMuscle cells are filled with proteins called actin and myosin. These are the proteins that make the muscle contract (get shorter.)\nMuscle contraction.\nWhen a nerve tells a muscle to contract, the muscle opens holes in its cell membrane. These holes are proteins that are called \"calcium channels\". The calcium ions rush into the cell. Calcium also comes out of a special place in the cell called the \"sarcoplasmic reticulum\". This calcium sticks to the specialized proteins actin and myosin. This triggers these proteins to contract the muscle.\nContraction also needs ATP. This is the energy that your cells use. It is made from using glucose in the cell. It takes a lot of energy to release contracted muscles. They use most of the energy for building muscles.\nExercise.\nExercise makes muscles get bigger (see hypertrophy). Exercise also makes muscles stronger. If a person does not exercise, their muscles become smaller and weaker. This is called muscle atrophy.\nDiseases of muscles.\nThere are many different kinds of muscle diseases. There are three big groups of diseases:"}

It is an internal organ between the esophagus and the small intestines. The stomach is the third stage in the digestive process. It holds food after ingestion. Food in the stomach then passes through to the small intestine where most of the food's nutrition is absorbed.\nThe stomach contains hydrochloric acid made by stomach cells. As a useful side-effect, the acid kills bacteria in the food. However, its main function is to help the protein-digesting enzymes called proteases work. In general, the food is churned, squeezed and mixed. This prepares it for digestion. The partially digested food is called chyme.\nThe stomach acid may cause problems. It can make peptic ulcers worse. It can also cause heartburn\u2014pain in the chest when acid from the stomach \"refluxes\" (backs up into) the oesophagus. These can usually be treated by neutralizing the acid. Vomiting occurs when food goes back up the oesophagus and out the mouth. Vomiting can be a symptom of disease.\nStomachs of other mammals work differently to human stomachs. Ruminants, for example, have a stomach with multiple compartments.\nIn that system, food goes through the first part of the digestive system twice, and the work of digesting the grass is done by bacteria.\nOther words for \"stomach\" include \"belly\" and \"tummy\".

It is a bad sensation that is physical \"and\" emotional.\nMost pain starts when part of the body is hurt. Nerves in that part send messages through senses to the brain. Those messages tell the brain that the body is being damaged. Pain is not just the message the nerve sends to the brain. It is the bad emotion felt because of that damage.\nThe message that the nerve sends to the brain is called \"nociception\". What is experienced \"because of\" the nociception is pain.\nKinds of pain.\nPain can be \"acute\" or \"chronic\". Acute means it only happens a short time. Chronic means the pain lasts a long time.\nPain can be from different types of injury:\nPain can also happen when there is no underlying injury or cause. Pain can happen just because the nerves do not work right. This is called \"neuropathic\" pain.\nTreatments for pain.\nFor most pain, the best treatment is to stop the damage that makes the pain. If the ankle is sprained, doctors tell the person not to walk on it. They tell them to put ice on it. This helps the injury stop. For an ulcer in the stomach, doctors stop the acid made in the stomach. This helps the ulcer to heal.\nBut many kinds of pain also need medicines to feel better. There are many different kinds of medicines for pain:\nThere are doctors who specialize in pain management. These are usually anesthesiologists but may also have any one of a number of underlying areas of specialization, such as neurology, physiatry, or internal medicine.\nChronic pain.\nA new genetic method of treating chronic pain is in the research stage.

The game was the first in the \"Mario\" series that used 3D graphics. Many fans and critics think that it is one of the best video games ever made.\nStory.\nPrincess Peach makes a special cake and invites Mario to her castle in Mushroom Kingdom. As Mario arrives, he learns that Bowser took over the castle and kidnapped Peach. To defeat Bowser and rescue Peach, Mario enters each worlds on painting walls. The main hub of the game is Peach's castle. The player can unlock doors by collecting stars. There are 120 of them scattered among 15 maps and some secret maps. The player can get each of the stars by completing each of the achievements per level. One world requires two stars, for instance. Each locked door leads to more levels and challenges. Mario can also leave the castle and explore the small courtyard.\nDevelopment.\n\"Super Mario 64\" was made in less than two years, but it was reported that Shigeru Miyamoto had thought about a 3D \"Mario\" game, called \"Super Mario FX\", five years before, while working on \"Star Fox\". Miyamoto came up with most of the ideas during the era of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) and thought about using the Super FX chip to make it a SNES game, but decided to build it for the Nintendo 64 due to the SNES's technical limitations. On his Twitter Dylan Cuthbert stated that there was never a \"Super Mario FX\" game ever made, and that \"Super Mario FX\" was the internal code name of the FX chip.\nNintendo started making the game with the creation of the characters and camera system. Miyamoto and the other designers were initially unsure of which direction the game should take; months were spent selecting a camera view and layout that would be appropriate. The original concept involved the game having fixed path much like an isometric type game (similar to \"\"), before the choice was made to settle on a free-roaming 3D design. Although the majority of \"Super Mario 64\" would end up featuring the free-roaming design, elements of the original fixed path concept would remain in certain parts of the game, particularly in the three Bowser encounters. One of the programmers of \"Super Mario 64\", Giles Goddard, explained that these few linear elements survived to force players into Bowser's lair rather than to encourage exploration. The development team placed a great amount of attention, time, and effort on getting Mario's movements right. Before levels were created, the team was testing and perfecting Mario's animations on a simple grid. The first test scenario used to try out controls and physics involved Mario and a golden rabbit named \"MIPS\" by the developers (named for the MIPS-type CPU used by the Nintendo 64), the latter of which was included in the final release of the game as a way to find two of the Power Stars. At first, the developers tried to make the game split screen co-op using both Mario and Luigi. Initially, the two characters would start at separate points in the castle and work their way through the game together. However, developers were unable to make the gameplay work.\nShigeru Miyamoto's guiding design philosophy behind \"Super Mario 64\" was to \"include more details\" than found in games prior to the Nintendo 64. Some details were inspired by real life. For example, the Boos are based on assistant director Takashi Tezuka's wife, who, as Miyamoto explained, \"is very quiet normally, but one day she exploded, maddened by all the time Tezuka spent at work. In the game, there is now a character which shrinks when Mario looks at it, but when Mario turns away, it will grow large and menacing.\" \"Super Mario 64\" is also known for having more puzzles than earlier \"Mario\" games. It was developed at the same time as \"\", but as \"Ocarina of Time\" was released more than two years later, some puzzles were taken from that game for \"Super Mario 64\".\nInformation about \"Super Mario 64\" first leaked out in November 1995, and a playable version of the game was presented days later as part of the world premiere for the Nintendo 64 (then known as Nintendo's \"Ultra 64\") at Nintendo Space World. The basic controls had at this point been set in place, and the game was reportedly 50% finished, although most of the course design remained. Thirty-two courses were made for the game. Miyamoto thought he would create more, up to 40 courses, not including bonus levels. The actual number turned out much lower in the final game, though, as only 15 courses could fit.\nAppearances in other games.\nIn the original \"Super Smash Bros.\" for the Nintendo 64 console, Princess Toadstool's castle is a playable stage in which the fighters fight on top of the roof.\nIn \"Mario Party\", Peach's stage is a large birthday cake which the player can travel through.\nSequel and remake.\nIn 1999, a sequel, titled Super Mario 64 2, was planned to be released for the Nintendo 64DD (N64 Disk Drive), but it was cancelled, due to the commercial failure of the Nintendo 64DD and unlike its predecessor, Luigi was going to be playable and there would be a multiplayer mode. \"Super Mario 64 DS\" is a 2004 enhanced remake made for the Nintendo DS console. In this game Mario, Luigi, and Wario all get a letter saying Peach baked a cake for them. Bowser has kidnapped Princess Peach, Mario, Luigi, and Wario and has jailed them in Princess Peach's castle, by Gomboss, King Boo, and Chief Chilly. Yoshi is told that he must save them. Yoshi finds a rabbit and unlocks the door to the castle. When the player finds keys, they save a character, and can play as them. \"Super Mario 64 DS\" also has a multiplayer wireless versus mode where up to four players can play and minigames which are unlocked by getting keys from rabbits. Here, there are 150 stars, 30 more than the original game."}
{"id": "13757", "revid": "55960", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13757", "title": "MP3", "text": "MPEG-1 and/or MPEG-2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3) is a lossy data compression format for audio. Using it makes smaller computer files containing digitized music and other sounds.\nOverview.\nThe format is a lossy compression format. This means that each time something is compressed with it, some information is lost. This information can not be recovered. When encoding to MP3 converting some audio data to it), the encoder is smart. The human ear can not hear certain sounds if they are masked by other sounds. This means that when encoding certain sound samples, some sounds can be left out as they will not be heard. This makes it possible to compress audio by a factor of about 5, without noticeable change to the sound of the music. With slight audible changes to the sound, compression factors of about 10 are possible.\nMany people like to use MP3 files to copy music so they can listen to it on their computer. Record companies do not like it when people use the Internet to share these MP3 files with each other. They think it is a violation of their copyright. The record industries have a trade group called the RIAA that has taken people to court for sharing music. An Internet website called Napster was shut down because of this. Napster has since re-opened, but does not let people share MP3 files anymore.\nOther formats for audio compression are Ogg Vorbis, and FLAC. Ogg Vorbis is very similar to MP3, although it has many improvements. FLAC is a lossless compression meaning no information is lost, and gets compression rates of 2-3.\nHistory.\nIn the 1980s, Dieter Seitzer started the development of a code for audio format of high-quality. Together with his team at the \"German Fraunhofer Institut\" in Erlangen, the professor had the idea to create code with a low bit-rate. The German institute received the patent for MP3 in 1989. MP3 was then passed to the International Organisation for Standardisation. In the same year the MP3 was included into MPEG-1 specification. (MPEG means Moving Picture Experts Group).\nThe first player for the MP3 format was designed by the same Fraunhofer Institute in 1990's. A Croatian student named \"Tomislav Uzelac\" developed \"AMP MP3 Playback Engine\" in 1997. After the player appeared on the Internet, two students named \"Justin Frankel\" and \"Dmitry Boldyrev\" transformed it into Winamp. They took the engine of the original player and added the interface of the famous Windows. \nWhen Winamp was launched into the net for free use it became successful at once. This way began the era of free music download. Soon various programmers started creating additional features for the MP3 player. Very often they created new encoders, rippers (software for transforming audio tracks into MP3 files) and players.\nMP3 players.\nBecause there is no need to pay licensing fees in order to build the player, today many software MP3 players are free. Some companies claim to have patents covering the MP3 format, but the validity of these patents is questionable because the format specification was published more than 20 years ago, meaning that any relevant patents would have expired. The most famous MP3 players are \"Winamp\", \"Sonique\", \"iTunes\" and \"MusicMatch\". The main feature of an MP3 player is to turn the MP3 files into standard audio form and then send them to the soundcard of the computer. The soundcard then outputs the files into speaker so the user can hear them. Every MP3 player interprets music differently, though each one of them uses the same code for playing the MP3 files. There are also stand-alone (without a computer) MP3 players. These may be portable, or they may be built-into a stereo system or car stereo. According to the MPEG standards, MP3 players are supposed to also be able to play MP1 and MP2 files, although many don't.\nTechnical details.\nWhen compressing, for each frame a small section of audio, the encoder first splits the audio into 32 different parts using a filter bank, similar to MP2. The audio is then split further into either 192 or 576 different parts (depending on the complexity of the audio being compressed more complex audio is split into \"fewer\" parts using the modified discrete cosine transform. The MP3 encoder then removes parts that it thinks the human ear cannot hear. The remaining parts are then compressed using Huffman coding. Decompression does these same steps except removal of parts of the audio in reverse."}

This condition is caused by a lack of pigment melanin (colour) in their hair, eyes, and skin. A person or animal with albinism is called an albino. Many albino people prefer to be called a \"person with albinism\". There are ten different types of albinism.\nPeople with albinism can have white or light blonde hair. They can have very pale skin. Their eyes are blue, or rarely pink-ish. People with albinism can have problems such as bad vision, increased sweat and getting sunburnt easily. This is because people with albinism have less pigments in their eyes, skin and hair.\nAlbinism is rare in the United States. One out of every 20,000 people in the United States has albinism. There are about 15,945 people in the United States who have albinism.\nVision problems in albinism include nystagmus (irregular fast movements of the eyes), strabismus (where the eyes fail to balance) and refractory errors (like being \"near-sighted\" or \"far-sighted\").\nIn most environments, Albino animals are more easily seen and so may be attacked by predators. They lack the camouflage that the non-albino members of their species have. Also, where colour is a factor in mate selection, they may be at a disadvantage there, too.\nGenetics of albinism.\nAlbinism is a hereditary condition. It is usually inherited in a recessive pattern; it means, both parents have to give the albinism gene to a child to cause albinism. Parents pass on pairs of genes to their children. One of the pairs of genes is in charge of making melanin. If both of these genes are flawed, then little or no pigment is made. If only one gene is flawed then pigment can still be made."}

He was the first president born after the United States Declaration of Independence, making him the first president who was born as a U.S. citizen after 1776.\nVan Buren was born in Kinderhook, New York, in 1782. Van Buren studied law by working for Francis Sylvester and later became a lawyer in 1803. In 1821 he was elected as a member of the United States Senate, representing New York. President Andrew Jackson selected him as the Secretary of State in 1827. In 1832, he became Vice-President for Jackson, and in 1836, he became the 8th president of the United States. During most of the time he was president, the economy was in very bad shape, and he was blamed for it. He was the first president to have been born a United States citizen, since all of his predecessors were born British subjects before the American Revolution.\nVan Buren lost the next presidential election in 1840 to William Henry Harrison. In 1848, he ran again to be president as a part of the Free Soil Party, but he did not win. Van Buren died on July 24, 1862, of heart failure after suffering from an asthma attack, on his Lindenwald estate.\nEarly life.\nMartin Van Buren was born on December 5, 1782 in Kinderhook, New York, south of Albany. Van Buren was the third born of five children. His father, Abraham Van Buren, was a farmer and a tavern owner. His mother was Maria Hoes Van Buren, the granddaughter of a Dutch immigrant. Martin Van Buren went to school at the Kinderhook Academy in the village where he lived. At Kinderhook Academy, he excelled in English and Latin. Van Buren left the school when he was 14 years old.\nAs a lawyer.\nIn 1796, Van Buren started working in the law office of Francis Sylvester, an attorney that worked in Kinderhook. He kept the office clean, copied documents and did other jobs. While he was working there, he learned about law. After six years under Sylvester, he spent a final year of apprenticeship in the New York City office of William P. Van Ness. Van Buren passed the New York State Bar Exam in 1803, and became a lawyer.\nAfter becoming a lawyer, Van Buren moved back to Kinderhook to work as an attorney with his half-brother, James J. Van Alen, in 1803.\nFive years later, Van Buren became the surrogate (legal officer) of Columbia County. There was no fixed term of office. That is, Van Buren would be there until the opposition party was able to elect someone else in his place. Van Buren held the office about five years until he was removed on March 19, 1813.\nPolitical career.\nVan Buren represented New York in the United States Senate from 1821 to 1828. He left the Senate to become the governor of New York in 1829. On March 5, 1829 after he became the governor, President Andrew Jackson made Van Buren the Secretary of State, so Van Buren was only the governor for two months.\nFrom 1833 to 1837, he was the Vice President. (Jackson was still President at this time.) Also was leading member of and gained much voting support by Free Soil Party.\nJust a few months after Van Buren became president, there was a financial crisis called the Panic of 1837. Van Buren believed in limited government, and did not respond in a way that many people wanted. Many people blamed him for the economy becoming worse, and this made him less popular. He earned the nicknames \"Little Magician\" and the \"Red Fox\" for his cunning politics.\nPersonal life.\nVan Buren married Hannah Hoes, a cousin, on February 21, 1807. They had five children together: Abraham, John, Martin Jr., Smith, and Winfield Scott.\nDeath.\nMartin Van Buren developed pneumonia in the fall of 1861. Due to this, he was bedridden. In July, 1862, Van Buren had a serious asthma attack and began to weaken. Van Buren died on July 24, 1862, at his home in Kinderhook, New York, of heart failure. He was 79 years old."}

It was first announced in 2003 at E3 and then next year its first design was shown off. It can play PSP video games, as well as music, video, and pictures. To transfer music, videos, or pictures to a PSP, you must use a USB cable to send the files from a computer to it. The games and movies come on a disc called the \"Universal Media Disc\" which holds 1.8 GB (this is a lot more than a normal CD, but less than a DVD). A Memory Stick Pro Duo can also be used for memory storage. The PlayStation Portable is the first handheld game console to use a disc as its media storage instead of a cartridge.\nIn January 2014, shipments of the PlayStation Portable ended in North America. They also ended in June 2014 in Japan and ended shipments to Europe by the end of 2014.\nGames and movies.\nThere are over 700 games for the PSP. The movies look like the DVD.

Normally, this occurs about forty weeks after the mother's last menstrual period. This developing human is called an \"embryo\" for the first eight weeks of the pregnancy, and \"fetus\" for the rest of the pregnancy. Abortion causes the embryo or fetus to die.\nWhen an abortion occurs naturally, it is often called a miscarriage. Humans can also choose to end the pregnancy before birth takes place. This is called an \"induced abortion\". Often, the term \"abortion\" often refers only to an induced abortion.\nIn both types of abortion, the embryo or fetus usually comes out of the womb. This is called a \"complete\" abortion. In some cases, the embryo or fetus remains inside the womb. This is called a \"missed\" abortion. Surgery is needed to remove the embryo or fetus from the womb so the woman does not get an infection.\nDifferent countries have different laws regarding induced abortion. While abortion is illegal in many countries, there are often exceptions that permit it in cases such as family incest, rape, the fetus having severe disabilities or the mother's health being at risk.\nSpontaneous abortions.\nNames.\nPeople speak of \"spontaneous abortion\" or \"miscarriage\" when the embryo or fetus is lost due to natural causes before the 20th week of pregnancy. A pregnancy that ends this way, but that is between 20 and 37 weeks old is known as \"premature birth\" if the baby is born alive. If the fetus dies in the womb after 20 weeks, or while it is born, this is known as \"stillbirth\". Premature births and stillbirths are generally not considered to be miscarriages.\nHow common they are.\nSpontaneous abortions (miscarriages) are common. About fifteen percent of pregnancies end in spontaneous abortion. In many cases, the woman is not even aware she was pregnant. The pregnancy is only a few days or weeks old and the woman believes the miscarriage is just her menses. About twenty-five percent of all women will have a spontaneous abortion during their lives.\nMost miscarriages occur very early. Between ten and fifty percent of pregnancies end with a miscarriage,\nwhere the mother or the doctors are aware of it. These figures depend on the age and health of the pregnant woman. Most spontaneous abortions occur so early in the pregnancy that the woman is not even aware that she was pregnant. One particular study showed that 61.9% of pregnancies end in miscarriage before 12 weeks. In 91.7% of these miscarriages, the woman did not know she was pregnant.\nThe risk of spontaneous abortion decreases sharply after the 10th week of pregnancy, with a loss rate between 8.5 weeks LMP and birth of about two percent; pregnancy loss is \u201cvirtually complete by the end of the embryonic period.\"\nSome people are more likely to have a spontaneous abortion.\nThose people who have already had several spontaneous or induced abortions run a greater risk of having a spontaneous one. Those with certain diseases, and those over the age 35 also run a greater risk. Other causes for abortions can be the infection of either the woman or embryo/fetus, or their immune response. Certain diseases or an accidental trauma can also cause a spontaneous abortion. Putting the woman under trauma or stress to cause miscarriage is considered induced abortion. Some countries call this feticide.\nCause of spontaneous abortions.\nMost miscarriages are due to problems with the copying of chromosomes, but some are caused by environmental factors. When a human is conceived, it gets 23 chromosomes from its mother and 23 from its father. If it does not get the right number its development happens wrong (it does not grow right.) It may have many bad birth defects.\nMost embryos and fetuses with chromosome problems will not live for a long time. They die very early. There are a few chromosome problems that babies can sometimes be born with. For example, Down syndrome happens when there are three copies of chromosome #21. (Usually people have 2 of every chromosome.) This is called \"trisomy 21\" (tri- means 3.)\nSymptoms of spontaneous abortions.\nThe most common symptom is bleeding from the vagina. This can be very little blood (less blood than a normal menses.) It can be very much blood (much more than a normal menses.)\nSome women have bad pains in their low abdomen when they have a miscarriage. This is sometimes like the pain of menses. It can be much worse. Or a woman may have no pain at all. If the pregnancy is many weeks old, the woman may see the embryo or fetus when it comes out. But if it is less than 12 weeks old a woman may not see anything but blood.\nTreatment of spontaneous abortions.\nUsually, no treatment is needed for a miscarriage. However, sometimes some pregnancy tissue remains in the womb after the miscarriage and must be removed. Sometimes doctors do a surgical abortion. This is the same kind of surgery that is done for induced abortions. Doctors can also prescribe women medicines that can help the miscarriage finish without needing surgery.\nInduced abortions.\nAn induced abortion is when things are done to end the pregnancy on purpose. These things are normally done by doctors. In countries where abortion can be done legally, it is often done by specialists who know a lot about women's bodies (gynecologists). Abortions done illegally are often performed by people without this special knowledge. This makes them more dangerous. Such abortions are usually called unsafe abortions, back-alley abortions or DIY abortions, mainly because the risk to the health of the mother is much higher than with abortions carried out by skilled doctors.\nReasons for an induced abortion.\nThere can be medical reasons why an abortion is performed. These include:\nKinds of induced abortions.\nThere are two different kinds of induced abortions. The type of abortion that is done depends on a few different things, like what the woman wants, what her doctor thinks is best, and how far along a woman is in her pregnancy (how long she has been pregnant).\nOne type of induced abortion is called a \"medical abortion\" or a \"medication abortion\". In this type of abortion, a doctor gives the woman one or two medications that will end her pregnancy. A medication abortion can only be done early on in the pregnancy. This is because the medications that are used work best when they are started as early as possible, and after a woman has been pregnant for about two months, the medications usually do not work very well. Because of this, medication abortion usually is not used after a woman has been pregnant for 9 weeks. Some of the benefits (or reasons why some women choose this type of abortion) are that it can be started as soon as a woman realizes she is pregnant; it does not require anesthesia; and the woman does not have to have a procedure in a hospital or clinic to have the fetus removed, like with the other kind of abortion that is done. After a woman is given the medication or medications that end her pregnancy, the abortion happens like a \"spontaneous\" abortion or a miscarriage. (The woman passes the fetus, along with the blood and tissue that have built up in the uterus, from her vagina.)\nThe most common medications that are used for medication abortions are mifepristone and misoprostol. First, a doctor gives the woman mifepristone, which is sometimes also called \"RU-468\" or \"the abortion pill\". This drug blocks the hormone progesterone in the body. Without progesterone, the embryo cannot survive. The lining of the uterus becomes thinner, and the embryo cannot grow or stay attached to the lining of the uterus. After a few days, a doctor gives the woman misoprostol. This makes the uterus contract (or get smaller) and the embryo is expelled from (or pushed out of) the uterus through the woman's vagina. Sometimes, another medication, called methotrexate, is used along with misoprostol in medication abortions. A woman is given methotrexate, usually as a shot in a doctor's office, and the drug stops the embryo from staying attached to the lining of the uterus. Then misoprostol is given a few days later.\nWith the second type of abortion - called \"surgical abortion\" or \"in-office abortion\" - a doctor does a procedure that removes an embryo or fetus from the woman's uterus. This kind of abortion can be done in different ways, depending on how long the woman has been pregnant. Surgical abortion is simpler, and there are fewer problems that can happen, if it is done earlier on in the pregnancy. The most common form is called an \"aspiration abortion\" or a \"suction curettage.\" This can be done in a doctor's office or clinic. First the woman's cervix (the top part of the uterus) is dilated (or made bigger). A medical tool is used to suction out everything inside the woman's uterus, including the fetus. If the woman has been pregnant for more than 12 weeks, the doctor first has to dilate the cervix (or make the cervix bigger), usually by putting small sticks into the cervix to help it open up. If another tool, called a curette, has to be used to scrape out tissue that is still inside the uterus, then this form of abortion is sometimes called a \"dilation and curettage\" (or \"D&amp;C\").\nRisks and complications.\nA pregnancy that ends without a child being born also may cause some problems to the woman this happens to. There are two broad groups of things that can happen:\nPhysical problems.\nAbortion is safer than childbirth if it is done before the 16th week of pregnancy and it is done by a professional. Certain methods of abortion are pretty safe, and complications are rare. Generally, stopping a pregnancy that has gone on longer is riskier.\nWomen usually feel a small amount of pain during first-trimester abortion. In a 1979 study of 2,299 patients, 97% reported having some amount of pain. Patients rated the pain as being less than earache or toothache, but more than headache or backache.\nLocal and general anesthesias are used during the abortion.\nPsychological problems.\nFew studies have been done to see if an abortion affects the woman psychologically, or mentally. Those that have been done give contradictory results. One study looked at 13.000 women who had become pregnant even though they did not want to. The study found that having an induced abortion does not increase the risk of getting mental health problems; the group that was compared were women who also did not want to have a baby, but who did not have an abortion. Other studies showed similar results: women who had an abortion did better in school or at work after the abortion. Another study showed that women who had an abortion had a higher self-esteem and felt better than those who did not.\nMany women who had an abortion felt better afterwards, they also felt relieved. They would do it again in a similar situation.\nA study done in New Zealand in 2006 showed that many women who had an abortion developed severe depression up to 4 years after they had the abortion. They were also more likely to have problems with alcohol and illegal drugs than those women who did not have an abortion. The person who oversaw the study later told media that given these results it would be very hard to say that having an abortion has no psychological effects on the woman who has it. He called the abortion \"a traumatic experience\".\nOther problems.\nBoth spontaneous and induced abortions have some risk for the woman.\nIf a bad thing happens because of a surgery or medicine that a doctor gives, or because of a miscarriage, it is called a \"complication\". Complications of abortions can be infection, bleeding, pain. There may or may not be problems getting pregnant again; this is still being researched. In places where induced abortions are legal less than 1% of induced abortions have a bad complication. If doctors do induced abortions, the risk to the woman is less than the risk of complications of childbirth (giving birth to a baby). In places where induced abortions are legal, less women have complications of induced abortion than in places where induced abortion is illegal. This is because induced abortions that are not done by doctors have much more risks. For example, after induced abortions became legal in the United States in 1973, less women died from having abortions. In the United States in 2000, 11 women died from the complications of legal abortion. The risk of death from a legal abortion is 1/100 of the risk of an appendectomy. The risk of death from an injection (shot) of penicillin (an antibiotic) is bigger than the risk of death from a legal abortion.\nThere can be emotional problems for the woman after a spontaneous or induced abortion. She may feel sad, angry, or guilty that she had a miscarriage or asked for an abortion. She may think she has done something that made the miscarriage happen, or that having an abortion was the wrong thing to do, and because of this she may feel intense grief. There are many places where women can get help dealing with these feelings.\nSome women who have induced abortions may get criticism from friends or family who have different beliefs. When scientists look at this in research studies, however, they do not usually see that women have emotional problems after induced abortions. In 1987, President Ronald Reagan told the Surgeon General of the US to look at this question. Both president Reagan and the Surgeon General C. Everett Koop did not think abortion was right. Dr Koop looked at 250 papers that scientists wrote in scientific journals. Dr Koop said that the science we know does not show that induced abortions cause emotional problems for women who have them.\nNumbers and reasons for induced abortions.\nThe number of induced abortions done are different for different parts of the world. This is also true for the reasons why women decide to have an abortion. Estimates are that about 46 million induced abortions are done worldwide, every year. 26 million of them occur in places where abortion is legal, 20 million happen in countries where it is illegal to have an abortion. Some countries, like Belgium (11.2 per 100 known pregnancies) and the Netherlands (10.6 per 100) have a low rate of induced abortion. Others, like Russia (62.6 per 100) and Vietnam (43.7 per 100) have a comparatively high rate. Overall, there are 26 induced abortions per 100 known pregnancies.\nWHO estimated in 2001 that every year, about 210 million women get pregnant, and that there are about 135 mililon live births. The remaining 75 million cases are miscarriages or induced abortions. About forty percent of pregnancies are unplanned, and about a fifth of the pregnant women decide to end the pregnancy early. This results in about 42 million abortions per year. About 20 million of these are legal, the rest are against the law. Most of the illegal abortions are performed by those who are not medically qualified, often with poor hygiene, which often threaten the lives of the women. The WHO estimated that about 47.000 women died in 2008 because of illegal abortions. This number was lower than the estimate of 1990, mainly because in South America, women opted to take drugs to end the pregnancy.\nMethods used for abortions; times when abortions are done.\nAbortion rates vary. The length the pregnancy has gone on, and the method used to do the abortion influence these rates. According to data collected in the United States, 88.2% of abortions were done in the first twelve weeks of pregnancy, 10.4% between week 13 and week 20 of the pregnancy. The remaining 1.4% were done in week 21 or later.\n90.9% were done by curettage, 7.7% were medical abortions (using drugs, mifepristone in most cases), 0.4% by \"intrauterine instillation\" (saline or prostaglandin), and 1.0% by \"other\" (including hysterotomy and hysterectomy). The Guttmacher Institute estimated there were 2,200 intact dilation and extraction procedures in the U.S. during 2000 - 0.17% of the total number of abortions performed that year. Similarly, in England and Wales in 2006, 89% of terminations occurred at or under 12 weeks, 9% between 13 and 19 weeks, and 1.5% at or over 20 weeks. 64% of those reported were by vacuum aspiration, 6% by D&amp;E, and 30% were medical. Later abortions are more common in China, India, and other developing countries than in developed countries.\nPersonal and social factors for abortions.\nIn 1998, a study was done in 27 countries. This study wanted to find the reasons, why women wanted to end their pregnancy. It found that women often gave one of the following reasons:\nA different study, done in the United States in 2004 came to similar conclusions.\nWomen who had an abortion in Finland and the United States usually did not state that the pregnancy posed a risk to their health. In Bangladesh, India and Kenya, however, more such women thought the pregnancy was a risk to their health. 1% of women in the 2004 survey-based U.S. study became pregnant as a result of rape and 0.5% as a result of incest. Another American study in 2002 concluded that 54% of women who had an abortion were using a form of contraception at the time of becoming pregnant. Inconsistent use was reported by 49% of those using condoms and 76% of those using the combined oral contraceptive pill; 42% of those using condoms reported failure through slipping or breakage. The Guttmacher Institute estimated that \"most abortions in the United States are obtained by minority women\" because minority women \"have much higher rates of unintended pregnancy.\"\nSome women have an abortion because the society they live in pressures them to.\nAny of these factors might force a pregnant woman to have an abortion.\nAbortion and the law.\nInduced abortion is not legal in every place. In some countries, a doctor who does an induced abortion is committing a \"crime\". In the United States, Canada, and many countries in Europe abortion is legal (not a crime). In some countries like Ireland and Somalia it is legal only to save the life of the woman. In some countries like Chile and El Salvador, abortion is never legal, including in cases where the woman risks dying from continuing the pregnancy.\nIn countries where induced abortion is not legal many more women die from abortion. Women still get induced abortions, but they cannot get them in safe hospitals and clinics. These induced abortions have more complications than abortions done by doctors.\nWomen who live in places where abortion is illegal, or heavily frowned upon sometimes travel to other places where an abortion can be done legally, so they can have an abortion. This is a form of medical tourism.\nSpontaneous abortion in other mammals.\nSpontaneous abortions occur in various mammals. In sheep, it may be caused by crowding through doors, or by being chased by dogs. In cows, abortion may be caused by contagious diseases, such as Brucellosis or Campylobacter. This can often be controlled by vaccination, though.\nAbortion may also be induced in animals, in the context of animal husbandry. For example, abortion may be induced in mares that have been mated improperly, or that have been purchased by owners who did not realize the mares were pregnant, or that are pregnant with twin foals.\nFeticide can occur in horses and zebras. Usually this is done because males harass pregnant mares or force copulation. Scientists have raised the question, how often this occurs in the wild, though. Male Gray langur monkeys may attack females following male takeover, causing miscarriage.\nOpinions about induced abortions.\nInduced abortion is a subject that is controversial. Each person has a system of moral values. Based on their system of morals, people have different opinions about it. Religion can also influence this opinion.\nDifferent opinions around the world.\nA number of opinion polls have been carried out around the world. They have tried to find out what people think about abortion. Results were different for different countries, but also varied with the questions that were asked.\nIn May 2005, a survey was done in ten European countries. The people were asked, if they could agree with the statement: \"If a woman does not want children, she should be allowed to have an abortion\". The highest level of approval was 81% in the Czech Republic; the lowest was 47% in Poland.\nA poll was done in November 2001. The poll asked people in Canada in what circumstances they believed an abortion should be permitted. 32% responded that they believe abortion should be legal in all circumstances, 52% that it should be legal in certain circumstances, and 14% that it should never be legal. A similar poll in April 2009 surveyed people in the United States about abortion; 18% said that abortion should be \"legal in all cases\", 28% said that abortion should be \"legal in most cases\", 28% said abortion should be \"illegal in most cases\" and 16% said abortion should be \"illegal in all cases\". In a Gallup poll taken in July of 2011, however, 47% of Americans identified themselves as pro-life and the same percentage of Americans identified themselves as pro-choice. A November 2005 poll in Mexico found that 73.4% think abortion should not be legalized while 11.2% think it should.\nOf attitudes in South America, a December 2003 survey found that 30% of Argentines thought that abortion should be allowed in Argentina \"regardless of situation\", 47% that it should be allowed \"under some circumstances\", and 23% that it should not be allowed \"regardless of situation\". A March 2007 poll about abortion in Brazil found that 65% of Brazilians believe that it \"should not be modified\", 16% that it should be expanded \"to allow abortion in other cases\", 10% that abortion should be \"decriminalized\", and 5% were \"not sure\". A July 2005 poll in Colombia found that 65.6% said they thought that abortion should remain illegal, 26.9% that it should be made legal, and 7.5% that they were unsure.\nPro-life and pro-choice.\nSome people have strong feelings about abortion. People who think that the law should let women choose to have abortions are called \"pro-choice\". People who think that abortion is wrong and that the law should not allow it are called \"pro-life\".\nPeople who are pro-choice believe that women should be allowed to have control over their own bodies when it comes to ending or continuing a pregnancy. They believe that, because the embryo or fetus is inside the woman's body and does not have developed enough organs to survive on its own until later in the pregnancy, it is not yet a person with rights. Pro-choice people also make the argument that abortion needs to be legal in order to protect women, because when abortion is illegal, it does not completely stop abortions from happening, but makes it so that women try to do abortions on themselves or get them done by people who are not trained doctors, which puts those women in danger of death or injury. Pro-choice people believe the way to prevent abortion is to make sure women only get pregnant when they want to. In addition to advocating the legality of abortion, pro-choice groups like Planned Parenthood often try to improve people's access to things used to prevent pregnancy (called \"contraception\"), and try to teach young people about sex to reduce the number of teen pregnancies.\nPeople who are pro-life believe that all humans, including the unborn, have a right to life. For this reason, they believe abortion is wrong and that it is murder. They think the law should make abortion a crime in order to protect innocent life within the womb. However, though pro-life people think abortion is wrong, there are rare cases in which \"some\" pro-life people would allow an abortion to happen, like if the pregnancy puts the woman's life at risk or if she got pregnant from rape. Pro-life people think women who are pregnant and do not want to raise a child should look for alternatives to abortion such as giving the baby up for adoption. There are many crisis pregnancy centers pro-life people have started to discourage women from having abortions. They have also started advocacy groups, like the American Life League, Feminists for Life and Live Action, to try to convince more people to believe that abortion is wrong and to try to get governments to make laws to restrict abortion. Some pro-life people have used violence to try to stop abortions from happening. However, most people who are against abortion do not do such wrong things and so they try to stop abortions from happening through peaceful activism.\nReligious views.\nMany religions have a view on abortion. These views span a broad spectrum from acceptance to rejection. Most religions generally oppose abortion.\nSelected issues of the debate.\nGenerally, when there is a debate about whether abortion laws should be changed in a country, there are advocacy groups. Some of the arguments these groups often have are outlined below.\nBreast cancer hypothesis.\nThere is a hypothesis that induced abortion raises the risk of getting breast cancer. People who support this, call it a \"link\", rather than a \"hypothesis\".\nThe subject has been controversial, but currently, scientists agree that there is no link between abortion in the first trimester, and increasing the risk to get breast cancer.\nIn early pregnancy, levels of estrogen increase. This causes the breast to grow, and to prepare for lactation. In the 1890s, studies were done on rats, before this hypothesis was put forward.\nCan the embryo or fetus feel pain?\nIt is currently unclear from what moment the embryo or fetus can feel pain. This is also used in the debate about abortion. Many researchers think that a fetus is unlikely to feel pain until after the seventh month of pregnancy. Others disagree. At about twenty-six weeks of pregnancy, certain connections are made in the thalamus of the growing fetus. Developmental neurobiologists suspect that these connections may be critical to perception of pain by the fetus. However, legislation has been proposed by pro-life advocates requiring abortion providers to tell a woman that the embryo or fetus may feel pain during an abortion procedure.\nResearchers from the University of California, San Francisco published a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The study analyzed data from dozens of medical reports and other studies. The researchers concluded that fetuses are unlikely to feel pain until the third trimester of pregnancy. However a number of medical critics have since disputed these conclusions. There are certain connections in the thalamus of the fetuse. These connections develop at about twenty-six weeks of pregnancy. At the end of the 20th century there was an emerging consensus among developmental neurobiologists that these connections are very important when it comes to the perception of pain in the fetus. Other researchers such as Anand and Fisk have challenged this late date, positing that pain can be felt around twenty weeks.\nPain can have many different aspects: It might be purely relying on sensory input, but it might also involve emotions and thought. For this reason, it is perhaps impossible to know exactly when the embryo or fetus feels pain, even if it has developed the links in the thalamus."}

Some clocks can give the date as well as the time and a few give other information. There are different types of clocks. A watch is a type of clock that is small and can be carried. Watches are usually worn on a person's wrist. At one time, watches were commonly kept in the person's pocket.\nKeeping time.\nClocks use different ways to measure time. Clocks need some sort of steady beat or motion to track the change in time. Ancient water clocks worked by the steady movement of water from a container with a hole in the bottom to another container without a hole. Other clocks use pendulums, springs and gears to track the change in time correctly.\nDigital clocks work by measuring the vibrations of quartz crystals when charged with electricity. The vibration frequency of the crystal does not change. \nAtomic clocks use the electromagnetic waves absorbed and emitted by atoms such as caesium to measure time. They are the most precise clocks in the world.\nClock displays.\nThere are many types of clocks and watches. The two most common types of displays on clocks are \"analog\" and \"digital\" . \nAnalog clocks.\nAnalog clocks use angles to tell time. They have \"hands\" that rotate around the clock's \"face\". The position of the hands shows the time. The face of the clock is a flat disk. It will often have the numbers one through twelve on the face to make it easier to read. Analog clocks commonly have two or three hands. If it has two, there is a large hand or \"minute hand\" and a smaller hand, the \"hour hand\". Clocks with three hands also have a \"second hand\". This hand is usually about as long as the minute hand, but much thinner. \nEach hand shows the time it is named for and moves around the face of the clock one complete rotation for each movement to the next larger hand. For example, the second hand moves around the face of the clock in 60 seconds. It moves once each second. When it moves all the way around the clock, the minute hand moves forward one space. When the minute hand moves all the way around the face of the clock (which takes 60 minutes), the hour hand moves forward one section. The second and minute hands take 60 movements to move all around the face of the clock, the hour hand only needs 12 movements to do the same.\nDigital clocks.\nDigital clocks use numbers to show the time. LCDs and LEDs are common for digital clocks. Unlike analog clocks which are based on 12 hours, digital clocks can use either a 12-hour clock (often with \"am\" for morning and \"pm\" for afternoon/night) or a 24-hour clock. Digital clocks are usually smaller and easier to both use and read than analog clocks but they can also be made much larger. New digital clocks can even correct themselves using the internet or radio signals.\nSounds.\nThere are also clocks that use sound, usually along with a dial or some other means, to show the time. The sound could be as simple as a bell or so complex that it sounds the same as a person. Many clocks that do this are old and are driven by springs or weights rather than batteries or other forms of electric power. Some special clocks are often used by people who are blind or cannot see well enough to read an analog or digital clock. They can also be used by people with mental problems that cause them to be unable to read other clocks.\nThere are many different types of clocks and watches. They are different in what they are used for, what they can do or how they are made. Examples include:"}
{"id": "13809", "revid": "7780327", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13809", "title": "Sexual orientation", "text": "Sexual orientation is forms of attraction to people. There are many different groups. Some examples are: attraction to a different gender (heterosexuality), attraction to the same gender (homosexuality), attraction to more than one gender (bisexuality), and no attraction any gender (asexuality).\nThe groups are part of sexual identity. Some people use something such as \"pansexual\" or \"polysexual\". Other people use nothing at all. \"Androphilia and gynephilia\" are an alternative to the gender binary in homosexual and heterosexual. \"Androphilia\" is attraction to a man or masculinity (any quality or behavior linked to a man). \"Gynephilia\" is attraction to a woman or femininity. \"Sexual preference\" overlaps with sexual orientation but is different. A bisexual person may like one gender more than another. \"Sexual preference\" may also give the idea of a degree of choice. The scientific consensus (position in the community of scientists) is that sexual orientation is not a choice.\nScientists do not know the exact cause of sexual orientation. It is thought that this is a complex combination of genetics, hormones, and environment. Scientists like any biological theory more than any social theory. This is because there is more proof that supports a biological cause of sexual orientation than a social one. There is little proof which gives the idea that early life experiences play a part in connection to sexual orientation.\nSexual orientation is important in biology, psychology, anthropology, history, and law.\nDifference from sexual identity and sexual behavior.\nGeneral.\nSexual orientation includes heterosexuality, bisexuality, and homosexuality, and asexuality. An asexual has little to no sexual attraction to people. This may be thought of as a lack of a sexual orientation. There is a large amount of discussion over whether or not this is a sexual orientation.\nMost definitions of sexual orientation are one of two components. The focus is on the desire of an individual or the partner of the individual. Some people like to use the definition of the individual.\nSexual identity and sexual behavior are connected to sexual orientation but are different. Sexual identity is a concept of self. Sexual behavior is sex with other people. Sexual orientation is connections to other people. An individual may or may not show sexual orientation from behavior. A person who is not heterosexual by sexual orientation and has a heterosexual sexual identity is 'closeted'. This term may show a stage of change in any society that, little by little, attempts to support the sexual minority. In any sexual orientation study, scientists use the terms \"concordance\" (sexual attraction, sexual behavior, and sexual identity match) or \"discordance\" (sexual attraction, sexual behavior, and sexual identity do not match)\".\" Here is an example of discordance. A woman with attraction to women says she is heterosexual and only has sex with men. Sexual orientation (homosexual), sexual identity (heterosexual), and sexual behavior (heterosexual) of the woman do not match.\n\"Sexual identity\" may also describe a perception of the \"sex\" of a person. \"Sexual preference\" is almost the same as \"sexual orientation\". The main difference is \"sexual preference\" gives the idea of a degree of choice. The Committee on Sexual Orientation and Gender Diversity of the American Psychological Association says the term supports a \"heterosexual bias\".\nAndrophilia, gynephilia, and other terms.\n\"See also: Androphilia and gynephilia\"\n\"Androphilia\" and \"gynephilia\" (or \"gynecophilia\") are terms in behavioral science (the study of human and animal behavior) that describe sexual orientation. It is an alternative to the gender binary in homosexual and heterosexual. The terms describe the focus of attraction with no need to credit a sex assignment or gender identity to the person. Other terms such as \"pansexual\" and \"polysexual\" also do not make any connection to the person. People may also use terms such as \"queer\", \"pansensual,\" \"polyfidelitous,\" or \"ambisexual\".\nSome scientists support use of the terms to skirt bias in concepts of human sexuality in the West. Sociologist Johanna Schmidt says that a term like \"homosexual transsexual\" cannot line up in a society where a third gender is supported. One example would be Samoan Fa\u2019afafine. \nBruce Bagemihl is also against \"homosexual transsexual\". This is because Bageminl thought this makes it simple to say a straight transgender woman is a homosexual male looking to run from stigma. \n\"Same gender loving\" (\"SGL\") is a term by African Americans that is the same as homosexual. \nGender and social pressure.\nVery early writers thought sexual orientation connects to the gender expression of the person. Karl Heinrich Ulrichs, Richard von Krafft-Ebing, Magnus Hirschfeld, Havelock Ellis, Carl Jung, and Sigmund Freud are some of the more famous writers. It was thought that a female person with attraction to female people is always masculine. Just the same, it was thought that a male person with attraction to male people is always feminine. This understanding of homosexuality as sexual inversion was a discussion at the time. By the second half of the 1900s, gender identity was seen as different from sexual orientation. Transgender and cisgender people may be attracted to men, women, or both. A homosexual, heterosexual, or bisexual person may be masculine, feminine, or androgynous. Still, studies by J. Michael Bailey and Kenneth Zucker say most of the gay men and lesbians describe different degrees of not matching gender roles as a child.\nToday, the sexual orientation of transgender people match the gender. A trans woman who experiences attraction only to women is a lesbian. A trans man who experiences attraction only to women is a straight man.\nSexual orientation sees a more complex understanding of both sex (male, female, or intersex) and gender (man, woman, or third gender).\nOutside of orientation.\nA gay or lesbian person may do sexual behaviors with someone of a different gender for many reasons. One reason is the desire for a family that looks common. Another reason is to skirt bias. A third reason is to skirt punishment in religion and another reason is to simply be friends with benefits. Not all LGBT people keep quiet about orientation to a wife or husband. Some who come out as gay or lesbian have a healthy continuous heterosexual marriage.\nChange.\nSexual identity can change through the life of an individual. This may or may not line up with sex, sexual behavior, or sexual orientation. Sexual orientation is stable and will not change for most people. Still, some tests say that some people may experience change in sexual orientation. This is more common for a woman than for a man.\nCause.\nScientists do not yet know the exact cause of sexual orientation. People thought that homosexuality was the result of wrong brain development. Early life experience and sexual abuse was thought to cause wrong brain development. This thought process comes from bias about homosexuality. Now many people guess that biology and environment play a complex part as a cause.\nBiology.\nTests link many biological factors which may have relation to the development of sexual orientation. The factors are genes, prenatal hormones, and brain structure. Tests are continuous in this area.\nScientists have a belief that sexual orientation is not from any one factor. Instead, this is thought to be from a combination of genetics, hormones, and environment. There is more proof that supports a biological cause of sexual orientation than a social one. It is not thought that sexual orientation is a choice. Some scientists have the belief that this is set at fertilization. Statistics say there are biological differences between gay people and heterosexuals. This may result from the same cause as sexual orientation itself.\nGenetic factors\nIdentical twins are more likely to have the same sexual orientation as fraternal twins. This means genes are linked to the development of sexual orientation. Studies have not found single 'gay genes', instead several thousand genes of a small influence are involved in sexual orientation. There are issues with the methods used in this research.\nHormones\nThe hormone theory of sexuality holds that certain hormones play a part in the sexual orientation that shows later in a mature person. Hormones in the fetus may be the prime effect on sexual orientation. This also may be one of many factors that combines with genes, environment, and social conditions to make a sexual orientation.\nIn humans, it is normal for females to have two X chromosomes. For males, it is normal to have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome. A human fetus starts as female so the Y chromosome is what makes the changes necessary to switch to male. Androgen hormones control this process. These androgens are testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The testicles in the fetus are responsible for the existence of androgens. The androgens will work together to make the sex difference of the fetus. This results in differences between males and females. Some scientists change androgen levels in mammals during fetus and early life as experiments.\nBirth Order\nMore than one study says the chance of homosexuality in a male increases with each successful birth of a male child. This effect ends if a male uses his left hand more than his right hand since birth.\n\"Fraternal birth order\" (FBO) effect is a theory that has strong proof of its prenatal origin. No proof so far links this to an exact prenatal process. Tests give the idea that this may be from the immune system. This is a immune reaction from the mother against a substance important to the development of the male fetus. This reaction is even more probable after every successful male birth. It is thought that this immune effect changes future males prenatal development. This process is the maternal immunization hypothesis (MIH). This starts when cells from a male fetus enter the circulation of the mother. The immune system of the mother cannot support the Y proteins because she is female. This causes the development of antibodies. An antibody travels through the placenta into the section with the fetus. From here, an antibody crosses the blood\u2013brain barrier of the brain of the fetus. This alters sex differences in brain structures relative to sexual orientation. This cause the son to experience more attraction to a man than a woman.\nSocial environment.\nThere is little proof to support the suggestion that early life experience or sexual abuse play a part in connection to sexual orientation. The viewpoints of parents may have an effect on how a child experiments with behaviors that link to a certain sexual orientation.\nEffort to change sexual orientation.\n\"See also: Conversion therapy\"\nA sexual orientation change effort is a plan that will try to change a same gender sexual orientation. This is cognitive behavioral therapy or conversion therapy.\nNo mental health organization gives approval to any effort to change sexual orientation. Almost all have a statement that says not to get a treatment that claims to change sexual orientation. Some orginizations with that statement are the American Psychiatric Association, American Psychological Association, American Counseling Association, National Association of Social Workers, Royal College of Psychiatrists, and Australian Psychological Society.\nIn 2012, the Pan American Health Organization makes a statement that says not to get a service that claims to change people with a not heterosexual sexual orientation. This is because there is no medical need. This is also a serious threat to the well-being of people that use this service. The scientific consensus of the world is that homosexuality is a normal and natural form of human sexuality. Homosexuality cannot be thought of as a disease. The Pan American Health Organization also says governments, schools, organizations, and communication outlets need to support respect for differences. Sometimes, a gay child will have to go to a \"treatment\" without choice. A gay child is sometimes put in a place separate from everyone for many months. Any places that have such poor treatment be subject to punishment under government law. This is for two reasons. The first reason is because this is against the moral concepts of medical care. The second reason is because this is against human rights that the international agreement keeps safe. \nThe National Association for Research &amp; Therapy of Homosexuality (NARTH) takes takes issue with how the mental health society describes the success of conversion therapy. NARTH also takes issue with how the mental health society describes sexual orientation for two reasons. One reason is because it is not a fixed two part quality. The second reason is because it is not a disease. Instead, it describes as a continuous order of sexual attraction and emotional attraction. The American Psychological Association and the Royal College of Psychiatrists say there is trouble with the positions of the NARTH. Science cannot support the positions. The positions also make an environment in which bias increases. \nMeasure.\nDifferent definitions and strong social rules about sexuality makes sexual orientation hard to measure.\nEarly organization systems.\nIn the 1860s, Karl Henrich Ulrichs makes small books about a sexual orientation organization system. The organization system is only for males. It separates males into three simple groups. The groups are \"dionings, urnings\" and \"uranodionings\". Ulrichs outlines a set of questions to check if a man was an \"urning\".\nA \"dioning\" is the same as heterosexual male. An \"urning\" is the same as a homosexual male. An \"uranodioning\" is the same as a bisexual male.\n\"Urnings\" are put into four groups.\nA \"mannling\" is a masculine \"urning\". A \"weibling\" is an effeminate \"urning\". A \"zwischen\" is an androgynous \"urning\". A \"virilised\" is an \"urning\" that will only have heterosex sex.\nIn 1896, Berlin sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld makes a system that measures the strength of sexual desire of an individual. This system measures on two different scales of 10 points. The scales are A (homosexual) and B (heterosexual). A heterosexual individual may be A0, B5. A homosexual individual may be A5, B0. An asexual is A0, B0. Someone with a strong attraction to both genders may be A9, B9.\nKinsey scale.\nAlfred Kinsey, Wardell Pomeroy, and Clyde Martin made the Kinsey scale. This scale was in \"Sexual Behavior in the Human Male and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female.\" It was made to fight the idea that people can only be homosexual or heterosexual. Kinsey sees that much of population is not all heterosexual or all homosexual. Such people experience both heterosexual and homosexual behavior.\nThe Kinsey scale is an organization of sexual orientation. The position on the scale is based on the relation of heterosexuality to homosexuality in their history.\nEven with eight groups, it is still hard determining which group will be good to put an individual in. Masters and Johnson talk about the difficulty of sexual comparisons with the Kinsey results. They find it hard to put an individual between the numbers 2 to 4 if the individual has a large amount of heterosexual and homosexual experiences. This is because it becomes hard for that individual to judge the relative amount of each without bias.\nKinsey thought about two areas of sexual orientation. The two areas are sexual reactions and sexual experiences. Weinrich says important information is lost when the two values combine into one final result. A person only with same gender sexual reactions is different from someone with little sexual reactions but a large amount of same gender sexual experiences. Also, there are more than two areas of sexuality to be thought about. Attraction and identity are other areas to judge. This is fixed in the Klein Sexual Orientation Grid.\nA 1970s study on masculinity and femininity says that the concepts are better on separate scales. The scales are in place of single continuous scale. Each end of the scale is representative of total opposites. When on the same scale, one will have to decrease for the other to increase. To be more feminine, one has to be less masculine. To be more masculine, one has to be less feminine. However, if they are thought of as separate areas, one can be both very masculine and very feminine. In the same way, heterosexuality and homosexuality on separate scales would allow one to be both very heterosexual and very homosexual. Or someone can be not very much of either. This makes determining the degree of heterosexual and homosexual in an individual easy. It is easy because each area is thought as independent rather than attempts to match a specific balance like the Kinsey scale.\nKlein Sexual Orientation Grid.\nIn 1978, Fritz Klein makes the Klein sexual orientation grid (KSOG). It was in his book \"The Bisexual Option\". The KSOG uses a seven-point scale to measure sexual orientation in seven sections. The focus is on three different points of life: past (from age thirteen to one year before current age), present (within the last twelve months), and ideal (what someone wants if they have complete choice). This design is an improvement on the Kinsey scale.\nThe Sell Assessment of Sexual Orientation.\nThe Sell Assessment of Sexual Orientation (SASO) is an improvement on the Kinsey Scale and Klein Sexual Orientation Grid. SASO improves in three areas. It contains many sections of sexual orientation. It also separates homosexuality and heterosexuality. SASO can start discussions on the best ways to measure sexual orientation.\nMany people have been discriminated against because of their sexual orientation. In many cultures, people who are homosexual or bisexual have been teased (made fun of), fired from their job, or made to suffer violence because of who they are. In many countries and states, there are laws against having sex with somebody of the same gender, and people can be put in jail because of who they have sex with. In the United States, these laws were struck down (repealed) by the United States Supreme Court in the last few years. The Yogyakarta Principles are made to combat such discrimination and United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights also made a document \"Born Free and Equal\" to counter them by international human rights law."}

The first smileys to be widely used were made as yellow buttons, but now the most common smileys are made using computer keyboard symbols. Smileys are used by many people in emails and other types of computer messages. A \"smiley\" is also sometimes spelt wrongly as \"smily\" or \"smilie\".\nHistory.\nSmiley button.\nThere were a number of early uses of simple graphics representing a smiling face. Some of these used a large circle containing two dots for eyes and a curve for the mouth. The most well-known smiley face was created in 1963 by Harvey Ball for an insurance company in Massachusetts. This design was a bright yellow circle representing a face, with black oval eyes and a big curved mouth with smile creases at the ends.\nThe design was made popular in the early 1970s by a pair of brothers, Murray and Bernard Spain, who though of a great plan to sell novelty items. The two used the \"smiley face\" on buttons as well to decorate coffee mugs, t-shirts, bumper stickers and many other things. They also used the phrase \"Have a happy day\" (which was the idea of Gyula Bogar). \"Smiley\" buttons were very popular from the 1970s onwards.\nSmileyworld Ltd.\nSmiley is a brand developed by Franklin Loufrani since 1971. He controls Smileyworld Ltd, a company whose mission is to make the world a happier place to live. Its brand Smiley is sold all over the world in several lifestyle industries, and its designers are constantly developing very creative and edgy products. The company donates ten percent of its royalties to a charity called the Smiley World Association, active with social actions in several countries. Its baseline is \"Share your smile with those in need\".\nIn 1997 Franklin's son Nicolas Loufrani has started to create a new world with icons based on the original Smiley logo. Today over 1200 icons are used as part of a brand called Smileyworld. This brand is based on a communication concept aimed at helping people to communicate better through various social expression products (greeting cards, gifts, etc.). It is also an educative project with books, toys, interactive products as well as a lifestyle brand for children.\nLegal.\nSmiley has been a registered trademark since 1971. The Smiley name and logo now registered and used in over 100 countries for 25 classes of goods and services. More than 1200 Smiley emoticons are registered with the Washington Library of Congress and protected by the Universal Copyrights Convention. In the past 10 years, Smileyworld Ltd has signed more than 800 licensing contracts worldwide and has been using its rights in most classes of goods and services in all important countries on the 5 continents. Smileyworld Ltd works with over 60 law firms to protect its IP.\nEmoticon.\nIn the 1990s people started using the internet and emails as a regular way of communicating. So that they could show happiness or fun in an easy way, people started making little smiling faces using some of the symbols on the keyboard. A keyboard smiley has a colon \":\" for the eyes, a hyphen \"-\" for the nose, and a parenthesis \")\" for the mouth. Some people make the smiley without the hyphen for a nose. The \"smileys\" that are made in this way are sideways.\nHere is a smiley:\nWhen you tilt your head to the left, it looks like a smiling face.\nSmileys are usually used as part of a written message, but sometimes a smiley is just sent on its own to say \"I am happy with your last message.\" Smileys are a useful way to show feelings to someone who cannot see the face of person sending the message.\nFrom the smiley came other ideas for showing emotions using keyboard symbols:\nSome people use different symbols, or do not use a nose, etc."}

They were one of the most skilled rock bands of all time; the guitarist and bassist were capable of soloing at the same time. Clapton helped pioneer the use of the wah-wah pedal and played a famous guitar called The Fool. Clapton developed what he called the \"woman tone\" on his guitar, while Bruce played a fretless bass guitar, and Baker played unusual rhythms on drums to create the band's distinctive sound.\nCream's hit records included the songs \"Strange Brew\", \"Sunshine Of Your Love\" and \"White Room\".

His songs include \"Born to Run\" and \"Born in the USA\". For more than 30 years he has been a singer along with his \"E-Street Band.\" Also, he is now a member in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Jon Landau, a music writer for \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, once said: \"I have seen the future of rock and roll, and its name is Bruce Springsteen.\" Springsteen won an Oscar for his song \"Streets Of Philadelphia\", written for the Tom Hanks' movie \"Philadelphia\".\nEarly life.\nSpringsteen was born in Long Branch, New Jersey, and spent his childhood and high school years in Freehold Borough. His father, Douglas Frederick Springsteen, was a bus driver.His mother, Adele Ann (n\u00e9e Zirilli), was a legal secretary. He has two younger sisters, Virginia and Pamela. Pamela was an actor but left this profession and became a photographer. She took photos for the \"Human Touch\" and \"Lucky Town\" albums.\nRaised Catholic, Springsteen attended the St. Rose of Lima Catholic school in Freehold Borough.Old teachers have said he was a \"loner, who wanted nothing more than to play his guitar.\" He completed high school, but felt so uncomfortable that he skipped his own graduation ceremony. He briefly went to Ocean County College but had no degree.\nEarly career.\nTill the early 1970s he played with different bands in the Atlantic area. In 1972 he signed a record contract with Columbia Records. His first album \"Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.\", released in January 1973, was commercially not a success but was highly favored by music critics. Also his second album \"The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle\" was more acclaimed than sold.\nIn the May 22, 1974, issue of Boston's \"The Real Paper\", music critic Jon Landau wrote after seeing a performance at the Harvard Square Theater, \"I saw rock and roll future, and its name is Bruce Springsteen. And on a night when I needed to feel young, he made me feel like I was hearing music for the very first time.\" Landau became Springsteen's manager and producer.\nBreakthrough.\nThe commercial breakthrough was his third album \"Born to Run\", which was released on August 25, 1975. Due to this Springsteen was on the covers of Time magazine and Newsweek. After a legal battle with his old manager Mike Appel, he could release his third album \"Darkness on the Edge of Town\" not earlier than 1978. In 1978, he worked together with Patti Smith, who had a hit with Springsteen's song \"Because the Night\". Also Manfred Mann (\"Blinded by the Light\") and the Pointer Sisters (\"Fire\") had success with songs of Bruce Springsteen. The next album was \"The River\". The single from this album \"Hungry Heart\" was his first Top 10 hit. \"The River\" brought Bruce Springsteen in a wide range of styles from ballads to rock songs.\nHis next album was \"Nebraska\" (1982) which he recorded in a studio at his home. The only instruments in this record were guitar and harmonica. The songs are about outsiders of the US society. Despite its commercial flop it is regarded by critics as one of Springsteen's best albums.\nHe is probably best known for his next album \"Born in the USA\" which sold 15 million copies in the USA. It contains 7 hit singles which all reached the Top 10. The following tour was also a huge success. The title track of the album was widely misunderstood as patriotic hymn. In fact it was a comment on the poor treatment of Vietnam veterans. In later years Springsteen performed the song only with acoustic guitar to make the meaning of the song more clear. An acoustic version also appeared on \"Tracks\", a later album. Videos for the album were made by famous movie directors Brian De Palma and John Sayles.\nThe next album was \"Live/1975\u201385\", which summed up the powerful live performances of Bruce Springsteen. It was a five records box-set and was the first set which reached #1 in the charts.\nAfter \"Born in the USA\", Springsteen recorded again more sedate and contemplative albums like \"Tunnel of Love\" (1987). In late 1989 he dissolved the E-Street Band and married Patti Scialfa. The couple relocated to California. In 1992 he released two albums at once, \"Human Touch\" and \"Lucky Town\". After he had received many Grammy Awards he also was winner of the Academy Award in 1994 for his song \"Streets of Philadelphia\", which appeared on the soundtrack to the movie \"Philadelphia\".\nIn 1995, he released his second solo guitar album, \"The Ghost of Tom Joad\", inspired by John Steinbeck's \"The Grapes of Wrath\". Following the album he made a solo acoustic tour where he played the new songs but also many of his older songs in acoustic form. After the tour he and his family went back to New Jersey.\nIn 1999, the E Street Band and Springsteen officially played together again. They made a reunion tour which lasted over one year. The last two concerts of the tour were recorded for an HBO Concert also a DVD and album was released under the title \"Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band: Live in New York City\". The same year Springsteen was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\nAbout the 1990s Springsteen said: \"I didn't do a lot of work. Some people would say I didn't do my best work.\"\nIn 2002 the artist released \"The Rising\" the first studio album with the E Street Band for 19 years. The 2005 album \"Devils &amp; Dust\" was again mostly acoustic and recorded without the band. In November 2005, Sirius Satellite Radio started a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week radio station on Channel 10 called \"E Street Radio\". This channel brings commercial-free Bruce Springsteen music, including rare tracks, interviews, and daily concerts of Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band recorded throughout their career. In April 2006, Springsteen released \"We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions\", a project with folk songs which were made popular by Pete Seeger. It was recorded with a large ensemble of musicians including only Patti Scialfa, Soozie Tyrell, and The Miami Horns from past efforts. The end of the decade brought three albums. (\"Magic\" (#1), \"Working on a Dream\" (#1) and \"The Promise\" (#16), which featured again outtakes of different songs). On January 11, 2009, Springsteen won the Golden Globe Award for Best Song for \"The Wrestler\", from the Mickey Rourke movie by the same name.\nSpringsteen and politics.\nIn September 1979, Springsteen and the E Street Band joined the Musicians United for Safe Energy (MUSE) anti-nuclear power collective at Madison Square Garden for two nights, playing an short set and two songs from his next album. 1988 Springsteen headlined the worldwide Human Rights Now! tour for Amnesty International. 2008 he supported Barack Obama's presidential campaign\nand he was the musical opener for the Obama Inaugural Celebration on January 18, 2009. He performed \"The Rising\" with a female choir. Later he performed Woody Guthrie's \"This Land Is Your Land\" with Pete Seeger.\nLyrics.\nSpringsteen's lyrics often explore highly personal themes such as disappointment and unhappiness with life in everyday situations.\nE Street Band.\nHe did most of his records with the E Street Band. The band was formed in October, 1972. Although Springsteen played with other bands, the E Street Band was his band for 40 years. The band took the name from a street in Belmar, New Jersey where the mother of a founding member lived and allowed the band to practice. The band members do also solo works and play as session musicians (for example: Bittan and Van Zandt for Bob Dylan on \"Empire Burlesque\"). Clemons and Lofgren also went on tour with Ringo Starr and his All-Starr Band in 1989.\nAlthough Springsteen informed the band in 1989 that he would not play with them they stayed friends and from 1999 onwards they again played and recorded together. \nDiscography.\nAlbums.\nMajor studio albums (along with their chart positions in the U.S. Billboard 200 at the time of release):\nLive albums"}
{"id": "13825", "revid": "1011873", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13825", "title": "Intersexuality", "text": "Intersex variations occur (though rarely) in species which use sexual reproduction. Intersex people are born with sex characteristics that lie between those of typical males and typical females. Hermaphrodite is a term that gets confused with intersexual, and while all hermaphrodites are intersexual, not all intersexual people are hermaphrodites. The clinical term 'disorders of sex development' (DSD) is very controversial.\nAn intersex individual's genitalia may be atypical in some way. It can be difficult to determine if an intersex baby is genetically male or female (with XY chromosomes or XX chromosomes). They may also have male and/or female secondary sex characteristics (such as body shape). However, there is a wide range of variation in sexual anatomy. There are many more subtle forms of sex anatomy, or sex chromosome differences. These don't even show physically. Some won't show up until later in life. Sometimes, the variation may appear when the baby reaches puberty or becomes an adult. It may not even be detected in an individual's lifetime, but as technology gets more advanced, that chance dims down.\nPopulation figures.\nUp to 1.7% of people may be born with an intersex variation. A child born with genitalia atypical enough to call in an expert occurs in about 1 of 1,500 births. More information on the frequency of different causes is available.\nCauses.\nMost causes of intersex are congenital, or born with it, usually because of a genetic condition. All development is governed by genes which regulate the process of growth.\nThe most common intersex variation is a hormone condition. This causes genetically female fetuses to have a more masculine body appearance, because the babies' adrenal gland produces higher levels of androgen hormones (hormones that act like testosterone). This may cause the female baby to appear male even to doctors and parents.\nGenetic Abnormalities.\nSome intersex people may be so because of abnormalities with their sex chromosomes, resulting in genetic disorders. One disorder known as Turner's Syndrome, is when instead of having an XX (female) or XY (male) genotype, a person has X0. A person with Turner's Syndrome usually looks like a girl, but they are shorter in height and do not go through puberty, meaning they cannot reproduce.\nAnother genetic disorder is Klinefelter Syndrome, where a person has an XXY genotype. This disorder affects men, causing infertility, smaller genitalia, and less facial hair. Men with this disorder can have a variety of symptoms which can be so unnoticeable that they may never be diagnosed.\nMedical interventions.\nSurgery may be used on intersex babies to give a more usual cosmetic appearance. This is sometimes thought to make children more normal, but this idea lacks evidence and is contested. Early cosmetic medical interventions can lead to problems in later life, including decreased sexual function and sensation. The children concerned cannot consent to those surgeries, and their parents may not understand the full implications. There is no medical consensus about surgical interventions, including their type, timing, necessity and conduct. \nMedical interventions can cause mental and emotional harm to the child when it grows and begins to go through puberty. Children may not feel like they are the gender that is assigned to them by their parents or doctors, causing issues with gender identity. Some people believe it is best to leave the genitalia as it is when the child is born and allow them to make decisions about it when they are old enough.\nHuman rights.\nCivil society organizations and human rights experts have called for an end to medical interventions on intersex children that are carried out for social reasons. United Nations and other human rights experts regard these medical treatments as harmful. \nIn 2011, Christiane V\u00f6lling became the first intersex person known to win a legal case taken because of non-consensual surgical intervention. In April 2015, Malta became the first country to end medical interventions to modify the sex anatomy of intersex children.\nSeveral countries protect intersex people from discrimination, including South Africa, Australia, and Malta.\nActivism.\nAs intersexuality becomes more recognized all over the world, there are many activist groups created to promote recognizing and supporting members of this community. One major activist group known as the Intersex Society of North America, or INSA, teaches people what intersexuality is and the harms of children having gender assignment surgery without their permission to consent.\nOne of the major issues intersex people face is other people who are not intersex making them feel uncomfortable about their sex and gender. Intersex people may not feel the need to identify themselves at all in their lifetimes, preferring to maintain ambiguity. However, those who are not a part of this community feel as though people need to chose and be more clear about their genitalia. This invasion of privacy is often protested against and discussed by activist groups who believe intersex people are allowed to be private and deserve to be treated the same as those who are not intersex."}

Her birth name was Rosalia \"Luxemburg\". She was born into a Jewish family. She was the fifth child of her parents. Her father was a wood trader/timber trader. His name was Eliasz Luxemburg III. Her mother's name was Line (maiden name: L\u00f6wenstein). \nIn one of her earliest publications, 'Reform or Revolution?' (1900) Luxemburg accepted Marx's argument that capitalism promoted exploitation and was at odds with humanity's natural, fraternal instincts. She also agreed that evolutionary socialism was impossible: only revolution could create real change. However, like Lenin, she had little sympathy for Marx's 'historicism' and denied that for a revolution to occur, capitalism would have to reach an advanced stage of development. However, Luxemburg's analysis of how the revolution should come would distinguish her from both Marx and Lenin.\nAfter WW1 Luxemburg helped establish the German Communist Party (KDP). She organised a socialist uprising in Germany but was killed by a right-wing group called the Freikorps. Rosa Luxemburg made many new communist ideas that continue to influence communism today. Rosa Luxemburg supported the Russian Revolution led by Lenin and Trotsky, but she saw them both as making undemocratic mistakes in organizing what was supposed to be a more democratic nation. She also insisted the freedom of assembly, freedom of the press, freedom of speech and abolition of death penalty. In 1913 she published an essay \"The Accumulation of Capital\" that urges that capital accumulation causes the imperialism. \nRosa Luxemburg was murdered-executed by the Garde-Kavallerie-Sch\u00fctzendivision of the Freikorps."}

Sometimes people use \"hepar- or hepat-\" as a prefix when they talk about the liver.\nFunctions.\nThe liver is the body's chemical factory. It does many important things:\nLiver diseases.\nThere are many different liver diseases. Liver disease can make someone very sick because of all the important work the liver does. People who have bad liver disease usually die unless they can get a liver transplant. This is when the liver from someone who has just died is put in another person by surgery. Such surgeries are usually technically challenging but can be life-saving.\nSymptoms.\nThe symptoms of liver disease happen because the liver does not do the work it should. \nThe liver cannot metabolize toxins and waste so these bad things stay in the blood longer. One thing that builds up is a substance called bilirubin. When red blood cells die, the hemoglobin in them leaks into the blood. The hemoglobin becomes bilirubin (a yellow substance that makes bile yellow). The liver takes the bilirubin out of the blood and puts it into the bile. The bile goes into the intestines and then goes out with the waste from your body. If the liver is hurt, it does not remove the bilirubin, so the bilirubin stays in the body. This makes the person's body look yellow and is known as jaundice. So yellow eyes and yellow skin are symptoms of liver disease.\nOther symptoms of liver disease are:\nTypes.\nHepatitis is when liver cells get \"inflamed\" (swollen, or increased in size). This can be from virus infections. This can be caused by toxins or poisons. The most common toxin to cause hepatitis is \"alcohol\". It can also have genetic, or autoimmune causes, when the body's immune system hurts itself.\nCirrhosis is caused by death of liver cells that happens again and again. When the cells die, scar tissue forms. This scar tissue damages the structure of the liver. This makes the liver not work as well. But it also makes the pressure in the veins that go to the liver very high. This high pressure makes \"esophageal varices\". The most common reason for cirrhosis in the world is hepatitis B virus infection.\nSome diseases cause bad things to build up in the liver. Hemochromatosis causes extra iron to build up in the liver. Wilson's disease causes extra copper to build up in the liver. Both of these diseases hurt the cells and can cause very bad liver disease that kills people.\nYou can also get cancer of your liver. This can be metastatic cancer that came from some other place in your body. The liver is a common place to get metastases because it takes bad things out of the blood. So it takes cancer cells out of the blood and they grow in the liver. Cancer can also grow in the liver. If it grows in the liver it is called \"hepatocellular carcinoma\" (liver cell cancer). Most hepatocellular carcinoma is from cirrhosis. \nTreatments.\nSome liver diseases can be treated easily with medicine. Hemochromatosis is treated by taking (removing) blood from patients at intervals (times) based on the seriousness of the disease in amounts about equal to what would be taken from a normal blood donor (~470 ml).\nSome liver viruses can be stopped before they start. Two types of viral hepatitis can be stopped with an immunization. Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B can be prevented with a total of five shots in a person's life. \nSome liver diseases can only be treated by a liver transplant.\nAs food.\nThe liver from livestock is a source of protein like muscle meats. It also a great source of some micro-nutrients. The flavor might be strong for some people, so it might be slightly over-seasoned. It might be toxic if you eat way too much of it."}

It is usually called rugby or rugger.\nRugby football is named after Rugby School, the public school in England where it was developed. Legend has it that one day in 1823, a senior boy called William Webb Ellis elected to run with the ball rather than retiring to kick it as was the normal mode of play in Rugby School football matches. \"Running in\" was not considered quite the done thing then but was later formalised in the laws of Rugby Football (first published in 1846). \nIts rival, Association football (soccer), came later. It was not formalised until 1863. Even then handling of the ball was allowed, but not catching it and running with it. In the mid 1860s an attempt was made to provide one set of laws for all football but there were irreconcilable differences, mainly concerning \"hacking\" (kicking an opponent in the shins). The \"hackers\" went on to eventually play rugby football even though hacking was barred a few years later. The \"anti-hackers\" went on to form Association Football, eventually banning any handling. \nRules.\nThere are two types of rugby, called\u00a0Rugby Union and\u00a0Rugby League. Originally, Rugby Union was played in England by gentlemen amateurs, and Rugby League was played by working class guys for pay. There are many similarities between the two types of rugby, but they have developed different sets of rules over time. The split between the two types occurred because of a disagreement about the way players were treated when they were injured during a game. \nRugby Union is the most popular form of rugby, and it is the\u00a0national sport\u00a0in New Zealand, Wales, Fiji, Samoa, Tonga and\u00a0Madagascar. Rugby League is played by many people in the UK (especially in northern England), Australia, New Zealand and\u00a0Papua New Guinea. In most other places, the word \"rugby\" refers to rugby union. \nRugby football is played on a field by two teams of 15 people. The objective of the game is to obtain more points than the opposing team within 80 minutes of playing time. Points are gained through scoring tries or kicking goals. \nAt each end of the playing field there is a field goal made out of poles, shaped like the letter H in English. There is also an area called the in-goal. A goal is scored when a player kicks the ball through the top of the H of the other team's goal. \nPlay starts when a player from one team kicks the ball from the halfway line towards the opposing team's field goal. Play continues until a try is scored, the ball crosses the side line or dead ball line, or an infringement occurs. The ball can be moved up the field either by carrying or kicking it. The ball can be passed between team members, but it cannot be passed to team members who are closer to the opposing team's goal than the person who is currently carrying the ball. \nPlayers score a \"try\" if they manage to touch the ball to the ground on or beyond the other team's in-goal. After a try, the team that scored the try then has an opportunity to kick a goal. This is known as a \"conversion kick\". A goal that is scored from a conversion kick is worth two points in addition to the points of a try. A try is worth five points in rugby union, and four points in rugby league. After a team scores points, play restarts with the non-scoring team kicking the ball from the halfway line toward the opposing team's field goal. \nPlayers tackle members of the other team to prevent the opposing team from scoring. Tackling in rugby means grabbing the other person and either stopping them from moving or making them fall on the ground. The main rule for tackling in rugby is that there should be no contact with the neck. Only players carrying the ball can be tackled. Once a tackle is completed, the opposition can compete for the ball.\nThe Rugby World Cup is a championship of rugby union teams from countries all over the world. The Rugby World Cup is held every four years, and will next be held in 2023, in France.\nThere is also the Rugby League World Cup, which is made up of member nations of the Rugby League International Federation (RLIF). The tournament has an irregular schedule. The next tournament will be in 2017, and will be hosted by Australia, New Zealand, and Papua New Guinea."}
{"id": "13913", "revid": "7687387", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13913", "title": "Kidney", "text": "Kidneys are two organs in the abdomen of vertebrates that are shaped like beans. They make urine.When medical professionals discuss the kidneys, they typically refer to the word \"renal\". For example, \"renal failure\" is when the kidneys are sick and do not work. \nThe prefix \"nephro-\" is also used in words to mean \"kidneys\". For example, a \"nephrologist\" is a doctor who studies kidneys.\nHormones.\nThe kidney makes hormones. The two most important ones that it makes are erythropoetin and renin.\nErythropoetin is made by the kidneys if there is less oxygen in the kidney. Erythropoetin tells the bone marrow to make more red blood cells. So this means there will be more oxygen carried in the blood.\nRenin is made by the kidney if there is low blood pressure, low volume of blood, or too low salts in the blood. Renin makes the blood vessels smaller and tells the adrenal gland to make aldosterone (which tells the kidneys to save salts). It also makes a person feel thirsty. All of this makes the blood pressure go up.\nStable environment.\nThe kidney's most important work is keeping homeostasis. Homeostasis means that the body keeps a stable environment inside itself. The body needs to have the consistent and proper amount of water, salt, and acid in the blood. The kidney keeps these things constant.\nIf there is too much water, the kidney puts more water in the urine. If there is not enough water, the kidney uses less water in the urine. This is why people make less urine when they are dehydrated.\nKidney diseases.\nThere are many types of kidney diseases. A kidney disease makes the kidneys unable to work perfectly but they do work in part. People can have mild kidney failure and have no symptoms. As long as it does not become worse, people may not even know they have it. \"Severe\" kidney failure means \"very\" bad failure. The kidneys do not work very much at all. People with severe kidney failure \"always\" have symptoms. They may need special care from doctors. \nThe main kinds of kidney diseases are:\nRenal replacement.\nIf a person's kidneys do not work properly, they are very sick. If they have severe kidney failure, they cannot live unless they have a replacement for their kidneys.\nThere are two ways to replace the kidneys: dialysis and transplantation.\nDialysis.\nDialysis is when doctors use a machine and medicines to do the work of the kidneys. There are two kinds of dialysis: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.\nPeritoneal dialysis is when doctors put a plastic tube into the person's abdomen. Every day the person fills the abdomen with fluid. The extra salts, waste, and water that the body does not need goes into the fluid. Then the fluid comes out and takes the wastes with it. This does part of the job that kidneys do.\nHemodialysis is when doctors take blood from a person, clean the blood with a special kind of filter, called a\" haemodialyser,\" and put it back in the person. When the blood is cleaned; water, salts and wastes are taken out of it. This must be done 2\u20134 times every week (usually 3 times.) It takes 2\u20134 hours to do this each time.\nHemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are not perfect. They do some of the work of the kidney, but it is not as good as a real kidney. So people who need dialysis are not as healthy. They must take medicines. For example, in kidney failure, the kidneys do not make any erythropoetin. Doctors have to give people erythropoetin so they make enough red blood cells.\nTransplant.\nA better way to do the kidneys' work is to give the person another kidney. This is called a kidney transplant. Kidney transplants are the most common type of organ transplant. It is the most common because we have two kidneys, but only need one kidney to live. People who are alive can donate a kidney to another person.\nEven transplanted kidneys are not the same as kidneys people were born with. A person who gets a renal transplant must take strong medicines to stop their body from attacking the new kidney. Sometimes, after years, the transplanted kidney stops working. But sometimes a patient can get a new transplanted kidney after the first one stops working.\nHistory.\nIt was widely believed in Europe that the conscience was actually located in the kidneys. This idea was taken from the Hebrew Bible. In modern times, medical scientists have shown kidneys do not have this kind of psychological role. "}

There are many prefixes that mean \"not\".\nWe also learnt the prefixes anti which means against and auto is used to mean self \"or own\"\nSome examples of these prefixes:\nantisocial which means non social\nanti glare which means it will prevent sun and light glare on a screen\nautograph which means a person's signature\nautopilot which means working by itself\nOther examples of prefixes:\nScientists and doctors use prefixes in many words.\nSometimes people make up words by adding a prefix.

The modern Western idea of human rights started in the European Enlightenment. In the 16th century, some people started suggesting that everyone had the religious and political right to choose their religion and their leaders. This sort of thinking was important in the English Civil War. After the war, the philosopher John Locke argued that people should have a certain set of human rights. These ideas were also important in the American revolution and the French revolution in the 18th century.\nIn the 19th century, John Stuart Mill was an important philosopher who also thought about human rights. He said that people should be able to control their own bodies and minds. He talked about three special ideas:\nHegel was a philosopher who wrote about the idea of free will. He believed that in order to have freedom, a person should be able to: \nLaws.\nBecause people believe that human rights are important, countries make laws to protect them. These laws say that governments cannot take away people's basic rights. They make sure people who take away other people's rights are punished. However, many countries in the world do not protect the human rights of their people. \nSome major political groups and countries have made statements that promote human rights. Many governments and international groups punish human rights violators by refusing to trade with them, or even helping groups that want to overthrow their governments. \nSome of the important places that human rights laws are written is in constitutions. The United States Constitution and Constitution of France are two of the oldest set of laws based on human rights.\nIn 1948 the United Nations made the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This is a widely respected document that lists what the United Nations believes are human rights. It is not a law, but two important agreements have been written based on its ideas:\nThese are United Nations human rights \"Covenants\": agreements between people or countries. The countries who sign these two covenants agree to follow them.\nIn addition to those Declaration and Covenants, there are many treaties and documents made by United Nations and other international organizations. Those treaties and documents are called \"International human rights law\".\nList of human rights.\nNot everyone agrees on what the basic human rights are. It is clear that few countries permit all these rights. Also, there are countries in which the rights are not illegal, but nothing is done to promote them. Here is a list of some of the most recognized rights:\nAbuses.\nHuman rights abuses are when a person is hurt in a way that violates (goes against) his/her human rights. Human rights abuses are also often called \"human rights violations\".\nMany people, groups, and countries think protecting human rights is very important. But not everyone in the world believes in human rights. If people who do not believe in human rights have political power they can hurt many people. Even if these people have no political power, they can be violent to other people. There are many people who work to protect everyone's human rights; some of these are government groups, and some are not with any government. They are sometimes called \"human rights organizations\". Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch are examples of human rights organizations.\nIn the UK, every Act of Parliament must comply with the European Convention on Human Rights. Nonetheless, a person can challenge an Act if it violates the Convention. However, the Government are not bound to change the law due to incompatibility, and they have the power to pass a law that contravenes with the Human Rights, if they wish."}

The rights and duties of individual people and the states they belong to vary from country to country. \n\"Nationality\" can take on different meanings depending on the country, language and culture in question. For example, someone of Italian descent may be called \"Italian\" even if the individual, a member of the Italian diaspora, has no right to an Italian passport and citizenship. In past centuries, the usual meaning of \"nationality\" was not political, but rather meant membership in an ethnic group. In modern cases such as in airports, when officials ask your \"nationality,\" they are asking to see the passport you use for travel to foreign countries."}

Most animals and plants use sperm to reproduce. They have different ways of making and releasing the sperm. In all cases the sperm meets with the egg of the female and grow into a new organism.\nThe name sperm is taken from the Greek word \"sperma\" meaning \"seed\".\nAn animal sperm cell is capable of movement, as it has to get to the uterus to meet with the ovum. Animal sperm cells (including humans) have small 'head' and a long tail called a \"flagellum\". The flagellum acts like a motor to propel the sperm cell through the female reproductive system. \nIn humans.\nHuman sperm is made in the testicles of a man. Human sperm contains 23 chromosomes. A human needs 46 chromosomes, so a sperm cell is called a \"haploid\" as it only has half. The other half is contained within the ovum or egg of a female. During sex, semen is shot out of the man's penis during ejaculation.\nSemen carries the sperm into the woman's vagina and down to the ovum in the uterus. During ejaculation millions of sperm cells are released, but only one hundred or so reach the egg.\nThe egg can merge with one sperm cell that reaches it. Because it now has 46 chromosomes, it is called a \"diploid\", like ordinary cells of the body. This diploid is called a zygote, and it can grow into a fetus and eventually a baby.\nIn plants.\nSome plants such as ferns and mosses have sperm that move. Flowering plant sperm cells cannot move by themselves. The flowering plant sperm cells are contained within pollen grains.\nThus, they rely on \"transportation\" to take their sperm cells to other plants. For example, a bee lands on a plant to collect the nectar. Some pollen will get stuck to the bee. The bee moves on to another plant and the pollen falls onto that plant. The sperm is moved down a \"pollen tube\" until it reaches the ovule at the bottom of the flower."}

It is usually a white or yellowish, sticky substance made up of sperm (male cells for sexual reproduction) floating in a fluid called seminal plasma that has water and different chemicals in it. Normally, an ejaculation makes between 1.5 and 5 millilitres (up to one teaspoonful) of semen.\nMany cultures around the world once thought or still think that semen has special or even magical qualities. Showing semen in forms of popular culture such as art and movies has for a long time been taboo, that is, not generally accepted by society. However, since the late 20th century, artists and moviemakers have done so more often.\nWords.\nThe English word \"semen\" comes from the Latin word \"s\u0113men\", which means \"seed\". In fact, \"seed\" was an old-fashioned name for semen. The Latin word \"s\u0113men\" itself came from another Latin word, \"ser\u011bre\", which means \"to plant (a plant into the ground) or to sow (seeds in the earth)\". It was once thought that semen was like a seed that grew into a baby after being \"planted\" inside a woman's body.\nAnother name for semen is \"ejaculate\". Some slang words for semen are \"cream\", \"cum\", \"jism\", \"jizz\", jazz \"load\", \"spooge\", \"spunk\", \"nut\", or \"wad\".\nThe way it looks and its nature.\nSemen is the fluid that comes out from the end of a man's penis when he has an orgasm (the height of sexual excitement) and ejaculates. It is usually white, but may also be slightly grey or yellow. If there is blood in the semen, it can look pink or reddish. This is a condition called hematospermia, and may be because of some blockage, inflammation, infection or injury to some part of the male sex organs, such as the urethra, epididymis, prostate or testicles. A doctor should be seen if the pink or reddish colour does not go away after a few days.\nMen ejaculate different amounts of semen. Normally, an ejaculation makes between 1.5 and 5 millilitres (up to one teaspoonful) of semen. More semen usually comes out if a man has not ejaculated for many days, or if he has been stimulated (made sexually excited) for a long time. Older men make less semen. If a man ejaculates an unusually small amount of semen, this is a medical condition called hypospermia.\nAfter a man has ejaculated, semen first becomes slightly thick and sticky, and may feel a bit like jelly and clump together in globs. Scientists think that semen does this so that if the man has had sex with a woman and has ejaculated inside her vagina, the semen stays in her vagina for longer and does not leak out. Between five and 40\u00a0minutes after this, semen becomes more liquid and watery. This probably allows the sperm in the semen to move through the vagina and into the woman's uterus and Fallopian tubes to try and fertilize an ovum (egg cell). If semen is ejaculated outside the body, after becoming watery it eventually dries up.\nWhat it is made up of.\nSemen is made up of sperm (male cells for sexual reproduction) floating in a fluid called seminal plasma. Sperm, also called spermatozoa, are made by a man's testicles and mature (grow up) in the epididymis. The fluids in seminal plasma come from different glands in the man's body: the seminal vesicles, prostate and bulbourethral glands (also called the Cowper's glands). (Glands are special organs in the body that make chemicals.) The table below shows the substances that make up semen and the glands that produce them:\nSeminal plasma protects and provides food for sperm as they travel inside a woman's body. The inside of a woman's vagina does not suit sperm cells as it is acidic. To protect the sperm from the acid, seminal plasma is alkaline. A woman's immune system also tries to kill organisms (living things) that are not part of her body. Seminal plasma has chemicals called prostaglandins in it to stop the woman's body from killing the sperm.\nSemen that does not have any germs in it (see below) is not harmful if it is swallowed, for example after a person has had oral sex with a man and the man ejaculates in that person's mouth.\nSemen quality.\n\"Semen quality\" refers to how well the sperm in a man's semen can fertilize a woman's ova. The better a man's semen quality is, the better chances he has to make a woman pregnant. A 1992 World Health Organization book said that an ejaculation of normal human semen has:\nThe number of sperm in an ejaculation of semen depends on many things. There may be more sperm if:\nIf there are an unusually low number of sperm in an ejaculation, this is called oligospermia. If there are no sperm at all, this is called azoospermia. A man with oligospermia or azoospermia is usually infertile, and cannot or finds it very hard to make a woman pregnant by having sex with her.\nHealth.\nBenefits.\nIf the semen does not have infections, it is okay to swallow semen. A woman cannot get pregnant from swallowing semen in her mouth. It is okay if a man swallows his own semen. Two doctors say it is good if a woman swallows semen often. They say women get breast cancer less if they swallow semen. The doctors don't know why. Other doctors must do more tests.\nStudies seem to say that semen is an anti-depressant. This means that it causes women not to feel depressed or sad. The studies found that when men had sex with women without using condoms, and the men's semen was taken into the women's vaginas, the women had better moods and felt happier. Scientists do not yet know if the same thing happens when semen is swallowed after oral sex, but some of them think it may.\nRisks.\nPassing on disease.\nIf a man has a sexually transmitted infection or STI (an infection that is passed from one person to another by sex), the germs that cause the disease can appear in his semen. If the person that the man has sex with touches the semen, he or she can become infected by the germs and pick up the disease. HIV, chlamydia, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, herpes and syphillis are examples of STIs. One of the ways for a man to lower the chance of passing on an STI to his sexual partner is to wear a condom on his penis when having sex. Getting semen in the mouth can be bad if the penis or semen has infections.\nIf semen gets in the eye, the eye will hurt. Wash the eye with warm water. Wash the eye for a few minutes. Some doctors say to get tested for infections.\nMaking the immune system weaker.\nSome scientists think that parts of semen, such as sperm and seminal plasma, can make another person's immune system weaker. Experiments show that when substances in a man's semen enter another person's body, that person's body makes antibodies. Antibodies are large Y-shaped proteins used by the body's immune system to stop foreign objects from harming the body. However, the antibodies made in response to substances in semen attack one of the body's own cells, called T lymphocytes. This weakens the body's immune system.\nAllergy.\nIn a very small number of cases, people have experienced allergic reactions when they touched semen. This is called human seminal plasma hypersensitivity. The symptoms (signs of the medical problem) can either be near the part of the body which touched the semen, or all over the body. They may include itching of the vagina, redness, swelling or blisters within 30\u00a0minutes of contact. They may also include itching and hives (large, red, itchy patches) all over the body, and even difficulty breathing.\nThe best way to test for human seminal plasma hypersensitivity is for a man to use a condom when having sex. When a condom is used, after ejaculation the man's semen stays inside the condom and does not touch the body of the person he is having sex with. If the man's sexual partner usually has allergic symptoms to semen but does not have any when a condom is used, this may show that his partner's body is extra-sensitive to semen. A person can often get over a mild semen allergy by coming into contact with semen often. If the allergic reaction is very bad, the person should see a doctor, especially if she is a woman trying to get pregnant. In such cases, it may be necessary for the woman to have a baby through artificial insemination. This is a medical way of fertilizing a woman's ova using a man's sperm without the man and the woman having sexual intercourse.\nCulture.\nMany cultures around the world once thought or still think that semen has special or even magical qualities. Some examples are set out below:\nPopular culture.\nDisplaying semen in forms of popular culture such as art and movies has for a long time been taboo, that is, not generally accepted by society. However, since the late 20th century artists and moviemakers have done so more often.\nVisual arts.\nThe American photographer Andres Serrano sometimes takes photographs of body fluids and displays them as artworks. One example is \"Blood and Semen II\" (1990), which is a picture of blood and semen mixed together. Some people are shocked by such pictures and think it is wrong of him to make them, while others think that as an artist he is free to create such works. Another of Serrano's pictures, \"Blood and Semen III\", was featured on the cover of the 1996 music album \"Load\" by the American heavy metal band Metallica.\nThe United Kingdom-based artists Gilbert Proesch and George Passmore, better known as Gilbert and George, have also used semen and other body fluids to create artworks.\nMovies.\nApart from pornographic movies showing people having sex, semen is usually not shown in movies as many people think that doing so is obscene (not decent). However, some movies that have shown semen are the American comedy movies \"There's Something about Mary\" (1998), \"American Pie\" (1999), \"Scary Movie\" (2000) and \"Scary Movie 2\" (2001). In the Spanish movie \"Y tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n\" (\"And Your Mother Too\", 2001), there is a scene where two high-school boys who are friends lie on diving boards over a swimming pool and masturbate (make themselves sexually excited). Semen is later shown floating on the water. Such movies are usually not thought to be suitable for children to watch."}

{"id": "13950", "revid": "7890450", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13950", "title": "Middle school", "text": "In the United States, a middle school is a school between elementary school (grades 1-5, 1-7, 1-6, 1-4 or 1-8) and high school (grades 9-12 or 10-12). Depending on location, middle school contains grades 5-8, 6-8, 7-8, or 7-9. Middle school is also sometimes called an intermediate school, junior high school or just \"junior high\".\nThe school day is often very different in elementary, middle, and high schools. Unlike elementary schools, where students often stay with one or two teachers for most of the school day, middle school is usually the first time in which students change teachers after each class of usually about one hour. Students often study 6 subjects. They will be taught by a different teacher for each subject.\nThe change from a one teacher-all subjects way of teaching helps create more independence for the pupil. They no longer have the guidance of just one main teacher. Also, students will often have more of a choice in what classes they take. This is mainly in dealing with subjects which are taken in addition to the basic subjects such as mathematics, English, history and general science.\nIn general, middle school acts as a transition between the elementary school structure where most people are all treated the same and the high school structure were most people are treated as individuals. However, some critics see middle schools as having gone \"soft,\" overemphasizing self-esteem building at the expense of academic rigor.\nHistorically, local public control (and private alternatives) have allowed for some variation in the organization of schools. Elementary school includes kindergarten through to sixth grade, or kindergarten through to fifth grade, i.e., up to age 12, but some elementary schools have four or eight grades, i.e., up to ages 10 or 14 (also known as the intermediate grades). Basic subjects are taught and pupils often remain in one or two classrooms throughout the school day, except for physical education, library, music, art, and computer classes. In 2001, there were about 3.6 million children in each grade in the United States. \"Middle schools\" and \"junior high schools\" are schools that span grades 5 or 6 to 8 and 7 to 8, respectively, but junior high schools spanning grades 7 to 9 are also common.\nThe range defined by either is often based on demographic factors, such as an increase or decrease in the relative numbers of younger or older students, with the aim of maintaining stable school populations. At this time, pupils are given more independence, moving to different classrooms for different subjects, which includes math, social studies, science, and language arts. Also, pupils are able to choose some of their class subjects (electives). Usually, starting in ninth or tenth grade, grades become part of a pupil's official transcript. In the U.S., children within this grade-range are sometimes referred to as \"junior highers\".\nThe \u201cjunior high school\u201d concept was introduced in 1909, in Columbus, Ohio. Junior high schools were created for \"bridging the gap between the elementary and the high school\", an emphasis credited to Charles W. Eliot. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, most American elementary schools had grades 1 through 8, and this organization still exists, where some concepts of middle school organization have been adapted to the intermediate grades. As time passed, the junior high school concept increased quickly as new school districts proliferated, or systems modernized buildings and curricula. This expansion continued through the 1960s. Jon Wiles, author of \"Developing Successful K\u20138 Schools: A Principal's Guide\", said that \"[a] major problem\" for the original model was \"the inclusion of the ninth grade\", because of the lack of instructional flexibility, due to the requirement of having to earn high school credits in the ninth grade and that \"the fully adolescent ninth grader in junior high school did not seem to belong with the students experiencing the onset of puberty\".\nThe new \"middle school\" model began to appear in the mid-1960s. Wiles said, \"At first, it was difficult to determine the difference between a junior high school and a middle school, but as the middle school became established, the differences became more pronounced\".\nThe faculty is organised into academic departments that operate more or less independently of one another.\nThe middle school format has now replaced the junior high format by a ratio of about ten to one in the United States, but at least two school districts had incorporated both systems in 2010."}

It was started in Pulaski, Tennessee on March 3, 1865 and quickly spread among white people in the southern United States. Most of its hate has been towards African Americans, but it has also attacked Catholics, Jews and immigrants. Known as the KKK for short, it has sought to keep \"white power\", often through very violent acts, including killing people. The first Ku Klux Klan broke up and does not exist anymore. However, other groups with the same name and the same ideas have been created.\nThe group was started after the American Civil War. It began as a social club for former Confederate soldiers, who during the war fought to defend slavery. The Klan quickly became a terrorist organization. It was one of several resistance movements against the Reconstruction of the United States.\nEarly years.\nWhen the KKK started, the ex-Confederacy states were occupied by soldiers from the north. Klan members feared white people in the South could lose their supremacy over black people. The Klan acted against black voters to intimidate them. At times, Republicans were also targets of attacks by the Klan,\nThe methods of acting against people were often the same: the Klan members tried to frighten the people that the Klan wanted to go out of town. The KKK tried to scare people by burning crosses or by threatening them. If people did not react, the Klan would kill them. The growing violence which was promoted by the KKK led to many lynchings (execution without a fair trial and killing them, often by hanging). The KKK was \"prohibited\" (made against the law) in 1871. After 1871, many KKK members were imprisoned (put in Prison). However, the Klan had achieved many of its original goals. For example, the occupation troops were moved out of the Southern states, to the West. The KKK affected many African Americans throughout the last century. The establishment of Jim Crow laws restored white supremacy in the South and the \"first era\" KKK disbanded.\nThe second Ku Klux Klan.\nIn 1915, William J. Simmons, an Atlanta businessman, started the Ku Klux Klan for a second time. A movie called \"The Birth of a Nation\" had just been released. It showed African-American men (played by white actors in blackface) as stupid and sexually aggressive towards white women. It also showed the Ku Klux Klan as a heroic force. The movie proved to be an excellent recruitment tool for the KKK. Most of the rituals and traditions of the \"old\" Ku Klux Klan were kept. Any white Protestant man could join the KKK. The KKK still attacked African Americans, but they also attacked Jews and Catholics this time. In 1920, the Klan began attracting recruits from all over the nation. They promised better law enforcement, better government, better schools and to restore traditional family values.\nThe KKK strongly argued for \"white supremacy\". \"White supremacy\" is the belief that white people are superior to other racial groups.\nIn 86 years, the KKK killed an estimated 3,446 black people. Most often these were hangings and were not legal executions because there were no trials. Many people now call these acts a form of terrorism because the KKK used fear to control African Americans and take away their political rights. After reaching its height of political influence, the second Klan began to decline. There was a number of scandals, a great deal of internal feuding and people getting tired of their violent image. In the 1920s they had reached a peak of about 5 million members. By the 1930s they were down to about 30,000. They survived another 14 years before disbanding in 1944. This was after they had been prosecuted for failure to pay federal income taxes.\nThe third Ku Klux Klan.\nIn 1954, the United States Supreme Court (the highest court in the US) made an important decision. The case was \"Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas\". The court \"ruled\" (decided) that it was unconstitutional to have different schools for black and white children. When this ruling passed, many independent Ku Klux Klan groups attacked African Americans.\nIn the summer of 1964, Edgar Killen killed three African Americans who participated in the civil rights movement. Killen was a member of the Ku Klux Klan. There was an early trial in 1967, but in this trial there was an all-white jury. It resulted in a hung jury so Killen was set free. In 1988 a movie called \"Mississippi Burning\" was made which talked about the events of this case. In 2005 there was another trial. Killen (at the time 80 years old) was sentenced to prison for 60 years. He died in January 11, 2018 in prison in Parchman, Mississippi at age 92.\nIn 2011 they were estimated to be perhaps as many as 5,000 members."}

Board of Education of Topeka, 347 U.S. 483 (1954) (full name George Brown, et al. v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas) was a Landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States. \nIn 1950 in Topeka, Kansas, a black third-grade girl named Linda Brown had to run more than a mile through a railroad switchyard to get to her segregated school for black children. However, there was an elementary school for white children less than seven blocks away. At that time, many schools in the United States were segregated. Black children and white children were not allowed to go to the same schools.\nHer father, Oliver Brown, tried to get Linda into the white school, but the principal of the school refused. Twelve more black parents joined Oliver Brown in trying to get their children into the white elementary school. The two schools were supposed to be \"separate but equal.\" However, they were not.\nIn 1951, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) helped the parents file a class action lawsuit. There were five lawsuits in Kansas, South Carolina, Virginia, Delaware, and the district of Colombia about having black students going to legally segregated schools. In 1896, the Supreme Court had ruled in \"Plessy v. Ferguson\" that segregation was legal, as long as separate places for blacks and whites were \"separate but equal.\" The NAACP's lawyers argued that the white and black schools in Topeka were not \"separate but equal.\"\nKenneth Clark is a psychologist that gave young African-American children black and white dolls to see how they felt about segregation and integration. The children liked the white dolls. After the doll test, Clark also gave the black children drawings of a kid and asked them to color it like themselves. Some of the children colored themselves with a white or yellow crayon, which was also used in the case.\nThe case eventually went all the way to the Supreme Court. After years of work, in 1954, Thurgood Marshall and a team of other NAACP lawyers won the case. It was named \"Brown\" because she was alphabetically the first name on the list of plaintiffs. After the lawsuit many of the plaintiffs lost their jobs and respect in society. \nThe ruling.\nThe Supreme Court has nine justices. The vote on Brown \"v. Board of Education\" was unanimous, meaning that all nine justices voted the same way. One of the judges, Robert Jackson, had recently had a heart attack and was not supposed to come back to court until the next month. However, he came to the court when the judges read their decision, possibly to show that every one of the judges agreed.\nThe ruling in the case was written by Earl Warren, who was Chief Justice. He said \"\u201cseparate educational facilities are inherently unequal.\"\" This decision made the racial segregation of schools against the law in every US state.\nSome states did not obey this court decision at first. The supreme Court ruled the schools had up to 5 years to desegregate. It was not until the early 1970s that all United States public schools were integrated (the opposite of segregated). Integrating America's schools required many state and Supreme Court decisions to force schools to integrate.\nOther websites.\nThese links may not be in simple English:"}

As the temperature drops, glucose comes out of solution. Then it is a semi-solid rather than a liquid.\nHoney is first mentioned in the Book of Exodus, and is often linked with pleasant and comfortable things. \"Land of Milk and honey\".\nIt is also referenced in the Qur'an, with similar associations to good and evil.\nThe name honey is derived from the Old English \".\nMuch like wine, there are several kinds of honey with different tastes, colors and textures. Some common types are got from bees who use the clover flower's pollen. It is thick and has a medium color. It tends to form crystals or grains more quickly when exposed to air. Acacia flowers make another common variety.\nHoney from bees using flowers from oleanders, rhododendrons, some laurels, and azaleas may cause honey intoxication. Symptoms include dizziness, weakness, sweating, nausea, and vomiting. \nExpert beekeepers solve this problem by moving their hives to areas where the right flowers are available. Bees like to get their nectar locally, and do not go more than two miles from the hive.\nHoney tastes quite different according to which flowers the bees used. Key things are its smell, taste and how clear it is; also no bad qualities.\nClassification.\nSource of flower.\nHoney can be classified by the type of flower that the bees make the honey from.\nBlended.\nMost commercially available honey is a mixture of two or more honeys that differ in the source of the flower, color, flavor, density, or geographic origin.\nPolyfloral.\nPolyfloral honey, also called wildflower honey, is gotten from the nectar of many types of flowers. The taste may be different from year to year, and the smell and the taste can be more or less powerful, depending on which flowers are blooming.\nMonofloral.\nMonofloral honey is made mainly from the nectar of one type of flower. To make monofloral honey, beekeepers keep beehives in place where the bees have access, as far as possible, to only one type of flower. However, a small amount of any monofloral honey will be from other flower types.\nClassification by packaging and processing.\nHoney can be classified by packaging and processing.\nWorldwide production.\nIn 2017, the world produced 1.9million tonnes of honey. China produced 29% of the world total. Other major producers were Turkey, Iran, United States, and Ukraine."}

It is made with different toppings. Some of the most common toppings are cheese, sausages, pepperoni, vegetables, tomatoes, spices and herbs and basil. These toppings are added over a piece of bread covered with sauce. The sauce is most often tomato-based, but butter-based sauces are used, too. The piece of bread is usually called a \"pizza crust\". Almost any kind of topping can be put over a pizza. The toppings used are different in different parts of the world. Pizza comes from Italy from Neapolitan cuisine. However, it has become popular in many parts of the world.\nHistory.\nThe origin of the word \"Pizza\" is uncertain. The food was invented in Naples about 200 years ago. It is the name for a special type of flatbread, made with special dough. The pizza enjoyed a second birth as it was taken to the United States in the late 19th century.\nFlatbreads, like the focaccia from Liguria, have been known for a very long time. Pizzas need to be baked at temperatures of 200250\u00a0\u00b0C. Hardly any household oven could reach such temperatures at the time. Because of this, the pizza was made at home, and then given to the town bakery to bake. In June 1889, the Neapolitan chef Raffaele Esposito created the \"Margherita\" in honour of Queen Margherita, and was the first pizza to include cheese. \nPizza was brought to the United States with Italian immigrants in the late nineteenth century; and first appeared in areas where Italian immigrants concentrated. The country's first pizzeria (place that focuses in pizza), Lombardi's, opened in 1905. Veterans returning from World War II's Italian Campaign were a ready market for pizza. Since then, pizza consumption has increased in the U.S. Pizza chains such as Domino's, Pizza Hut, and Papa John's, have outlets all over the nation. Thirteen percent of the U.S. population eats pizza on any given day. \nTypes.\nIn the 20th century, pizza has become an international food. The toppings may be quite different depending on the local tastes. These pizzas consist of the same basic design. They also include many types of ingredients such as anchovies, egg, pineapple, banana, coconut, sauerkraut, eggplant, kimchi, lamb, couscous, chicken, fish, and shellfish. Sometimes, meats prepared in styles such as Greek lamb, Gyros or chicken tikka masala, and non-traditional spices such as curry and Thai sweet chili are added too. Pizzas can also be made without meat for vegetarians, and without cheese, for vegans.\nStyles.\nNeapolitan pizza (\"pizza Napoletana\"). Authentic Neapolitan pizzas are made with local ingredients like San Marzano tomatoes, which grow on the volcanic plains to the south of Mount Vesuvius and Mozzarella di Bufala Campana, made with the milk from water buffalo raised in the marshlands of Campania and Lazio in a semi-wild state (this mozzarella is protected by its own European law). \nThe genuine Neapolitan pizza dough consists of Italian flour, natural Neapolitan yeast or brewer's yeast, salt and water.The dough must be kneaded by hand or with a low-speed mixer. After the rising process, the dough must be formed by hand without the help of a rolling pin or other mechanical device, and may be no more than 3 mm (1/8 in) thick. \nPizza is cooked in a oven. When cooked, it should be crispy, tender and fragrant. Neapolitan pizza has gained the status of \"guaranteed traditional specialty\" in Italy. This admits only three official variants: Pizza marinara, which is made with tomato, garlic, oregano and extra virgin olive oil (although most Neapolitan pizzerias also add basil to the marinara), Pizza Margherita, made with tomato,mozzarella, basil and extra virgin olive oil, and Pizza Margherita DOC made with tomato, buffalo mozzarella from Campania in fillets, basil and extra virgin olive oil.\nLazio style: Pizza in Lazio (Rome), as well as in many other parts of Italy is available in 2 different \"flavors\": 1) In take-away shops so-called \"Pizza Rustica\" or \"Pizza a Taglio\". Pizza is cooked in long, rectangular baking pans and relatively thick (1\u20132\u00a0cm). The crust similar to that of an English muffin and mostly cooked in an electric oven. When purchased, it is usually cut with scissors or knife and priced by weight. 2) In Pizza Restaurants (Pizzerias) it is served in a dish in its traditional round shape.\nOther types of Lazio-style pizza include:\nSicilian-style pizza has its toppings baked directly into the crust. \nPizza Hut's Sicilian Pizza, introduced in 1994, is not an authentic example of the style as only garlic, basil, and oregano are mixed into the crust,it's sold in the restaurant chain \"Pizza Hut\".\nWhite pizza (\"pizza bianca\") uses no tomato sauce, often substituting pesto or dairy products such as sour cream. Most commonly, especially on the East Coast of the United States, the toppings consist only of mozzarella and ricotta cheese drizzled with olive oil and basil and garlic. In Rome, the term \"pizza bianca\" refers to a type of bread topped only with olive oil. Some white pizzas use Alfredo sauce as the pizza sauce for a better flavor.\nPizza al taglio.\nPizza al taglio or pizza al trancio was invented in Rome. It is usually rectangular, and sold by weight. The name translates to pizza by the slice. Stands selling pizza al taglio are common in Italy. It is also common in other areas of the world where there are many Italian immigrants. \nPizzerias.\nAntica Pizzeria Port'Alba, the first pizzeria in Italy, started making pizzas in 1738 and still serves pizza today.\nSome global pizza franchises are Pizza Hut, Domino's Pizza, Cici's Pizza, Papa John's and Little Caesars.\nFrozen pizza.\nFrozen pizza is pizza that has been prepared beforehand, and is then deep-frozen, to be distributed in supermarkets. It is among the most successful and popular types of convenience food. It is prepared slightly differently: First the dough with the tomato sauce is pre-cooked, then the toppings are added. The dough of frozen pizza is different. Its dough also contains modified starch and leavening agents. This makes it possible to cook the pizza directly, without first defrosting it. One main frozen pizza brand is Digiorno. "}

Ideas of Heaven and Hell are not the same in all religions.\nIn Christianity.\nAccording to the Bible, there are different meanings for the word:\nThe Bible does not have a lot to say about what it looks like. The apostle Paul tells about a vision he had of being taken up to \"the third heaven,\" where he saw and heard things too wonderful to describe. But, much of what Christians believe Heaven to be like comes from the vision that John saw in a vision while praying, including:\nCatholics believe Mary is the Queen of Heaven, officially defined by Pope Pius XII in 1954. However many Protestants see this as not in the Bible.\nIn Islam.\nAccording to the Quran and Hadith, Heaven is a place of reward for those believers who accept the true faith and practices the teaching of Prophet Muhammad. The eternal life will be perfect, with thousands of types of food and clothing more beautiful than humans could ever imagine. There will also be no sad feelings, stress or pain and related problems of life.\nIn Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith.\nBaha'is believe that Heaven or (hell) being specific places as symbolic. The Aqdas, the holy book of Baha'is, along with other Baha'i books, describe heaven as a \"spiritual condition\" where being close to God is called heaven. Hell is seen as being separated from God. Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h, the founder of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith, said that the afterlife is beyond human understanding.\nIn Paganism.\nSummerland is the name given by Wiccans and other Pagan (old European religions) to their belief of afterlife (life after death)."}

The eukaryote life cycle includes meiosis which divides the chromosome number in half.\nIn animals.\nIn animals, there are two types of fertilization, internal and external. Internal fertilization happens in the female body. External fertilization happens outside of the body. Mammals, birds, and reptiles use internal fertilization. Amphibians and most fish use external fertilization. Some animals with internal fertilization give birth to live offspring. Others such as birds, most reptiles, and some mammals such as the Platypus, lay eggs.\nInternal fertilization happens during mating (sexual intercourse in humans). Sperm cells travel from the male testicles to the female uterus. One sperm attaches to the egg in the uterus. Together, they become a zygote."}

A more common word for menstruation is a \"period\". \nSummary.\nInside the thick part of the uterus are blood vessels and nutrients that a baby will need to grow. Every month in a human female who has gone through puberty, the brain sends signals to the ovaries that tell them to release an ovum (or egg). The ovum then travels through the fallopian tubes (with the expectation of becoming fertilized by a sperm cell) into the uterus. If an ovum is fertilized, it sticks to the wall of the uterus and starts to grow. If the ovum is not fertilized, it does not stick. The uterus then gets rid of the ovum and the extra tissue by releasing it from the body. The tissue and blood flows out of the uterus through the vagina. This is called menstruation or having a period. The bleeding normally lasts about 3-5 days, though some people may bleed longer or have a bit of bleeding between periods.\nThe uterus then starts preparing for another ovum. For most people, the time between their periods is about one month. For about 2 years after menstruation starts, the time between periods is not always the same. Some menstruators may skip a month, or have 2 periods close to each other. It is also possible and normal (within reasonable limits) to have cramps (rather painful squeezing feelings) or to feel bloated (swollen up) in the abdomen at periods.\nPeople who have periods often use sanitary napkins or tampons to soak up the blood and tissue. A sanitary napkin is a piece of material that absorbs (takes in) liquids which is worn between the vulva and underpants. A tampon is a stick of absorbent material that is placed in the vagina. Pads and tampons can be disposable or reusable.The use of a menstrual cup or disc is also possible. A menstrual cup is a silicone cup that is inserted inside the vagina to collect blood and other tissues. A menstrual disc follows the same concept but is made of more flexible material and is round and flatter than a cup, it is also inserted higher in the vagina.\nCycle.\nMenstruation.\nMost people menstruate for 3\u20135 days every month. However, anywhere from 2\u20137 days is normal. The amount of blood lost is normally about 50ml. Menstruators usually use a pad or a tampon to keep the blood from staining their undergarments, but there are many other forms of \nMenopause.\nMenopause is menstruation stopping at the age of around 45-70, which is caused by hormones. Symptoms include irritability, heat, vaginal burning and/or discomfort, and vaginal dryness. A slang word for it is called \"the change\". Most people must take a few months to adjust to the dryness. After they stop their period they can no longer produce babies.\nPhysical appearance.\nThe fluid that comes out looks like blood, but it is more than just blood. It also has endometrial tissue. This is the tissue that lines the inside of the uterus (womb).\nMenses happens in the first days of the menstrual cycle. This is the changes that happen in a woman's body every month. These changes are started by changes in hormone levels in the blood. These changes also cause a person to ovulate and make an ovum (also called \"egg\"). Menstruation usually starts around the age of 11, even as early as 9 years old, and ends when the menstruator is too old to have children. However, some females can still have children from the age of 50-70.\nEffect.\nSome people have pain in the low part of the abdomen when they menstruate. This\u00a0is called dysmenorrhea, or cramps. Extreme and continuous cramps are not normal and should be checked upon with a medical practitionner. The hormones that are produced before and during a period can also make a woman feel moody, or just strange. This is called premenstrual syndrome (PMS), or premenstrual tension (PMT). A person can feel bloated or swollen and have long cramps. Some menstruators have extremely bad reactions to menstruation and may even feel suicidal. This is called premenstrual dysphoric disorder, or PMDD. Other physical effects include headaches, tender berasts, lower back pain, fatigue, acne, diarrrhea or constipation, trouble sleeping and more.\nMaterials.\nMost menstruators use something to absorb or catch their menses. There are a number of different methods available. The most common methods of absorbing the \"flow\" are sanitary towels (sometimes called \"pads\"), tampons and padded underwear. Some people use sea sponges, towels and other reusable absorbing items.\nIn addition to products to contain the menstrual flow, pharmaceutical companies likewise provide products \u2014 commonly non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) \u2014 to relieve menstrual cramps. Some herbs, such as dong quai, raspberry leaf and crampbark, are also claimed to relieve menstrual pain, however there is no documented scientific evidence.\nNotes.\n3. https://www.yourperiod.ca/normal-periods/symptoms-of-menstruation/ "}

Examples of this are the \"Folies Berg\u00e8re\" in Paris, the \"Tropicana\" in Havana and the \"Cotton Club\" in Harlem, Manhattan.\nAlso the name is used for places where adults socialize and meet others and drink alcoholic beverages, like wine, beer, and mixed drinks.\nMost nightclubs are only open in the evening and in the night. Some are open during the day, but in these cases, the facility usually provides a different service, such as a restaurant service.\nActivities.\nNightclubs, in the original sense, put on shows which people watched sitting in chairs, often at a table where food and drink was served.\nToday, the word is used for venues with a dance floor and a DJ playing pop, rock, and dance music recordings. Some nightclubs have entertainment such as pop bands, rock bands, or comedians. Some nightclubs have a quieter lounge area with couches, sofas, and low tables, so that people can talk together.\nThey mostly have burgers and wings for the people at the party\nFood and drinks.\nSome nightclubs also serve a small selection of food, usually snacks or finger food. Nightclubs often have a much wider selection of alcoholic drinks than pubs (pubs specialize in beer and ale). Most nightclubs sell a number of different brands of spirits, liquers, wine, sherry, Some nightclubs have a large selection of expensive brands of alcohol (these are called \"premium\" brands).\nThe bartenders (also called \"barmen\" or \"barmaids\") at nightclubs often make a much larger variety of mixed drinks than pubs. Mixed drinks and cocktails are alcoholic drinks that consist of one or more types of alcohol (e.g., rum, vodka, whiskey, etc.) mixed with flavorings such as orange juice, cream, chocolate syrup, or soda. Many mixed drinks also include ice, crushed ice, or sliced lemon or lime. \nSome well-known mixed drinks include the martini, the \"Rum and Coke\", and the \"screwdriver\" (orange juice mixed with vodka).\nStaff.\nNightclubs hire a variety of staff to do different jobs. Bartenders (also called \"barmen\" or \"barmaids\") at nightclubs serve alcohol and mix drinks. Some nightclubs hire servers to bring drinks to people who are sitting at tables or in chairs. Some nightclubs also hire people to take away empty bottles and glasses. \nSecurity in nightclubs is provided by door staff, often called \"bouncers\". Door staff check the identification of people entering the nightclub, to ensure that people that are too young to drink do not enter the club. Door staff also prevent drunk or aggressive people from entering the nightclub. They also escort people out of the club if they are too drunk, fighting, or taking drugs. Door staff may also call the police if they cannot deal with a situation.\nNightclubs that serve food have cooks, dishwashers, and servers to prepare, cook, and serve the food. Nightclubs also have coat check employees who hang up the patron's coats, sound technicians to maintain the sound system (the CD players, amplifiers, and speakers), and cleaners (to sweep the floors and clean the bathrooms). Some large nightclubs may hire DJs to work in the club every week as employees. \nDJs, bands, comedians who entertain patrons during the evening are usually not usually employees of the nightclub. Instead, the nightclub signs a contract with these entertainers, in which the entertainer promises to come to the club on a specified night, in return for a sum of money."}

This symbol is taken from the Latin word \"kalium\". Potassium's atomic number is 19. It has 19 protons and electrons. Potassium is not found as an element in nature, because it is so reactive.\nPotassium has two stable isotopes, with 20 or 22 neutrons. Its atomic mass is 39.098. The unstable isotope with 21 neutrons is one of the most common radioactive materials.\nProperties.\nPhysical properties.\nPotassium is a soft gray metal. It can be cut easily with a knife. Its melting point is 63 degrees Celsius (145.4 degrees Fahrenheit). It melts at a very low temperature. It is an alkali metal. It is the second lightest metal, after lithium.\nChemical properties.\nPotassium reacts in many chemical reactions similar to sodium and other alkali metals. It tarnishes in air to produce a whitish oxidized layer on the surface. This is why it is stored in oil. It also reacts very fast with water, which is another reason for its storage in oil. The hydrogen produced during its reaction with water can burst into flames when a large amount of potassium is added to water. Potassium hydroxide is also produced. Potassium also burns in air easily, to make the peroxide or the superoxide.\nChemical compounds.\nPotassium compounds are only in one oxidation state: +1. Potassium ions are colorless and similar to sodium ions. Potassium chloride can be used as a substitute for table salt. Potassium hydroxide is used in the electrolyte of alkaline cells. Most potassium compounds are nontoxic. If they are toxic, it is because of the anion. Potassium chromate is colored because of the chromate, not the potassium. Potassium chromate is toxic because of the chromate, not the potassium.\nName.\nThe word potassium comes from the word \"potash\". Potash is a mixture of potassium carbonate and potassium hydroxide that has been used for a very long time. In past centuries potash was made from ashes in pots. It is used to make fertilizer, soap, and glass.\nOccurrence.\nPotassium does not occur in nature because it is too reactive. It is found in minerals, though. It is extracted from them by electrolysis of potassium hydroxide or potassium chloride. The potassium hydroxide or potassium chloride has to be melted at a very high temperature.\nUses.\nPotassium metal is used to absorb water from solvents. It is also used in some scientific instruments.\nPotassium compounds are used in soap, fertilizer, explosives, and matches.\nNutrition.\nPotassium ions are very important to organisms. That is why fertilizers have potassium compounds in them. The ions send messages from cells to other cells. It helps biological membranes \"depolarize\". This means go from a negative to a positive electrical charge. This is needed for muscles to \"contract\" (get shorter and move things.) It is needed for the heart to \"beat\" (push blood through blood vessels.) If the potassium level in the blood is too high or too low it can cause death because the heart stops. A few good sources of potassium are bananas, apricots and raisins.\nSafety.\nPotassium metal is very dangerous and can form an explosive coating if it is kept in air. It also reacts violently with water, spewing corrosive liquid. Potassium compounds are not normally dangerous, unless they contain a toxic anion like chromate or chlorate."}

It was created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The show started on December 17, 1989 and so far over 677 episodes have aired in 33 seasons. As of today, the show is in its 33rd season. As a full-length movie, \"The Simpsons Movie\", was released on July 27, 2007 as a celebration of the franchise. It is aimed at the whole family.\nThe comedy takes place in the fake (make-believe) town of Springfield, although it is speculated that this town may correspond to the real-life cities of Springfield, Oregon (a city near where Groening grew up) or Springfield, Virginia, from the adventures of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie. Homer's name is an Homerous. His full name is Homer J. Simpson. Bart's name is an anagram of Brat. His full name is Bartholomew Jojo Simpson. This TV show has a yellow skinned cartoon family. In 1998, Phil Hartman was murdered by his wife. In 2000, Ned Flander's wife, Maude Flanders was killed off. Also in 2000, Barney Gumble became sober. In 2002, the production of The Simpsons had switched from cels to digital ink and paint. During that time, The Simpsons had suffering of franchise fatigue. \"Sneed's Feed and Seed\" from the episode E-I-E-I-(Annoyed Grunt) became an internet meme.\nHistory.\nThe television show \"The Simpsons\" was originally shown as short shows on \"The Tracey Ullman Show\". Fox then decided to give them their own show in 1989.\nEpisodes.\nSeasons of The Simpsons mostly have a total of 22 episodes.\nElements of the show.\nChalkboard gag.\nMany episodes begin with a scene of Springfield Elementary School, where Bart Simpson is shown writing lines on a chalkboard as punishment for being bad. For example, in one episode, Bart writes, \"I will not conduct my own fire drills.\" The line is supposed to be humourous. Not every episode has a new one and sometimes the chalkboard gag may be cut (removed) because there is not enough time. \nCouch gag.\nIn the opening, all the Simpsons come home after work or school. After Homer Simpson is almost or is hit by Marge's car, they all go into the living room, where something comical happens again. These are called \"couch gags\". On one couch gag Homer Simpson walked onto the screen like James Bond and shot the camera. Sometimes if an episode is a short one, then the couch gag will be very long. A couple of couch gags have been over one minute long. Couch gags in earlier seasons were simple but then became more interesting in later seasons.\nEnding credits.\nAt the end of the show, the credits are shown. Sometimes they might be changed. In one episode, the ending showed Homer reading from a document about Dateline. In another episode, where all of the character sung in song, the character Snake kept firing his gun in order to make the music that was playing stop.\nMovie.\nA film based on the show, \"The Simpsons Movie\", was released in 2007, specifically on the day that it was released. It included the character Spider Pig as Homer's new pet after rescuing him from a chain restaurant, Krusty Burger. "}

It uses film or electronics to make a picture of something. It is a tool of photography. A lens makes the image that the film or electronics \"sees\".\nA camera that takes one picture at a time is sometimes called a \"still camera\". A camera that can take pictures that seem to move is called a \"movie camera\". If it can take videos it is called a \"video camera\" or a \"camcorder\". The majority of cameras are on a phone. This is called a \"Camera phone\".\nAll cameras are basically a box that light can not get into until a photo is taken. There is a hole on one side of the camera where the light can get in through the lens, and this is called the aperture. On the other side is a special material that can record the image that comes through the aperture. This material is the film in a film camera or electronic sensor in a digital camera. Finally, there is also the shutter, which stops light from getting in until a photo is taken.\nWhen a photo is taken, the shutter moves out of the way. This lets light come in through the aperture and make a picture on the film or electronic sensor. In many cameras, the size of the aperture can be changed to let in more light or less light. The amount of time that the shutter lets light through can be changed as well. This also lets in more light or less light. Most of the time, electronics inside the camera control these, but in some cameras the person taking the picture can change them as well.\nMoving pictures.\nA cin\u00e9 camera or movie camera takes a rapid sequence of photographs on image sensor or strips of photographic film. Unlike a still camera the cin\u00e9 camera takes a series of images, each one is called a \"frame\". The frames are later played back in a cin\u00e9 projector at a specific speed, called the \"frame rate\" (number of frames per second). While viewing, human visual system merges the separate pictures to create the illusion of motion. The first cin\u00e9 camera was built around 1888. By 1890 several types were being made. The standard film size for cin\u00e9 cameras was quickly established as 35mm film. This remained in use until transition to digital cinematography.\nA professional video camera (often called a television camera) is a high-end device for creating electronic moving images. Their use includes music videos, movies, corporate and educational videos."}

It is the shrine of Edward the Confessor and the burial place of many kings and queens. Since it was built it has been the place where the coronations of Kings and Queens of England have been held. The present structure dates from 1245, when it was started by Henry III.\nThe status of the Abbey is that of a Royal Peculiar. This means it is place of worship that falls directly under the jurisdiction of the British monarch, rather than under a bishop. The concept dates from Anglo-Saxon times, when a church could ally itself with the monarch and therefore not be subject to the bishop of the area. Technically speaking, it is not a cathedral, though it is regarded as one in practice.\nOne of the most famous tombs at Westminster Abbey is that of the Unknown Warrior.\nWestminster Abbey and its small parish church, St Margaret's, form a UNESCO World Heritage site, which also includes Westminster Palace.\nCoronations.\nSince the coronations in 1066 of both King Harold and William the Conqueror, coronations of English and British monarchs were held in the Abbey. Henry III was unable to be crowned in London when he first came to the throne because the French prince Louis (later Louis VIII) had taken control of the city. So the king was crowned in Gloucester Cathedral, but this coronation was deemed by the Pope to be improper, and a further coronation was held in the Abbey on 17 May 1220. The Archbishop of Canterbury is the cleric in the coronation ceremony.\nKing Edward's Chair (or St Edward's Chair), is the throne on which British sovereigns sit when the crown is put on their heads. It is kept in the Abbey, and has been used at every coronation since 1308. From 1301 to 1996 (except for 1950 when it was briefly stolen by Scottish nationalists), the chair also housed the Stone of Scone upon which the kings of Scotland are crowned. Although the Stone is now kept in Scotland, at future coronations the Stone will be returned briefy to St Edward's Chair for the moment of coronation.\nCentre of learning.\nUntil the 19th century, Westminster was the third seat of learning in Oxford and Cambridge. It was here that the first third of the King James Bible Old Testament and the last half of the New Testament were translated. The New English Bible was also put together here in the 20th century."}

The summits are Makalu [left (8,462\u00a0metres; 27,765\u00a0feet)], Everest [middle (8,848\u00a0metres; 29,035\u00a0feet)], Lhotse [middle (8,516\u00a0metres; 27,939\u00a0feet)] and Cho Oyu [right (8,201\u00a0metres; 26,906\u00a0feet)]]\nThe Himalayas are a mountain range in South Asia.\nThe west end is in Pakistan. They run through Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh states in India, Nepal, and Bhutan. The east end is in the south of Tibet. They are divided into 3 parts Himadri, Himachal and Shiwaliks.\nThe 15 highest mountains in the world are in the Himalayas. The main ones are Mount Everest, Annapurna, and Nanga Parbat. Mount Everest is the highest mountain on Earth, at 8,849\u00a0meters. Of the fifteen highest mountain peaks in the World, nine are in the Nepali Himalayas.\nThe word \"Himalaya\" means \"House of Snow\" in Sanskrit, an old Indian language. The Himalayas are so high that they kept the Indian and Chinese people separate from each other most of the time. India is a peninsula that is cut off from the rest of Asia by the mountains. It is often called the Indian subcontinent because it is larger and more isolated than other peninsulas.\nNorth of the Himalayas is the Tibetan Plateau. It is called \u201cthe roof of the world\u201d. However, the Tibetan Plateau is very dry because the plateau and the mountains act as a gigantic rain shadow. The rain falls instead on the south side of the mountains. This has greatly influenced the climate of the Indian subcontinent. Not only does it block the extremely cold winter winds blowing from Central Asia from entering Subcontinent, it also forces the Bay of Bengal Monsoon branch to shed its moisture along NE and Northern Indian States, Bhutan, Nepal and Bangladesh.\nFormation of the Himalayas.\nGeologically, the origin of the Himalayas is the impact of the Indian tectonic plate. This travels northward at 15\u00a0cm per year, and joined the Eurasian continent about 40-50 million years ago. The formation of the Himalayas resulted in the lighter rock of the seabeds of that time being lifted up into mountains. An often-cited fact used to illustrate this process is that the summit of Mount Everest is made of marine limestone.\nThe Indian plate is still moving north at 67\u00a0mm per year. Over the next 10 million years it will travel about 1,500\u00a0km into Asia. About 20\u00a0mm per year of the India-Asia convergence is absorbed by thrusting along the Himalaya southern front. This leads to the Himalayas rising by about 5\u00a0mm per year, making them geologically active. The movement of the Indian plate into the Asian plate also leads to earthquakes from time to time.\nWildlife.\nThe Himalayas are very popular for tourists because it has a lot of wildlife. The types of plants and trees, which are common in the place, are Oak, Pine, Fir, Rhododendron, Birch, Juniper, and Deodar. Common animals, which are seen mostly in the different parts of the Himalayas, are snow leopards, blue sheep, musk deer, tigers, elephants, wild boar, and crocodiles. Even endangered species of animals and plants are also found there. In the north part of the Himalayas where the temperature falls below freezing point, animals cannot survive well. However, those who adapted can survive. During the cold winters most of the animals migrate to the lower regions of the Himalayas while others like the brown bear hibernate instead. The Yak is mostly seen in the cold desert. They are like wild ox and they are the largest animals in this region. In regions of Ladakh animals like Nyan, the wild and the most largest sheep are found.\nSome of the major places for wildlife attractions in the Himalayas are:\nFive main rivers.\nThe five main rivers of the Himalayas are the Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Beas, and Satluj. The rivers are the main source of human and animal life in those areas."}

Three of the four founding members of the Ramones died within eight years of the band breaking up.\nThe original lineup was made up of Joey on drums, Johnny on guitar and Dee Dee on bass and vocals. Tommy was their manager. Then Dee Dee said he was unable to sing while playing bass, so Tommy got Joey to sing and then played drums himself, leaving Dee Dee to backup sing. Later, Tommy left the band and was replaced on drums by a new member, Marky. Eventually Marky was fired and then replaced by another drummer, Richie. After that, Dee Dee left the band to produce his own rap album. C.J. joined the band as their new bassist.\nTheir first album \"Ramones\" is now a classic of early punk rock. The songs are short, the melodies simple and the text is often made up of 2 or three phrases only. Their live concerts were legendary, extremely loud and very short. They played song after song, only interrupted by Dee Dee's (and later, C.J.'s) shouts of \"one, two, three, four!\".\nThe Ramones never had big commercial success. Among their best-known songs today are \"Blitzkrieg Bop\" and \"I Wanna Be Sedated.\" Now they are seen as one of the most important punk rock bands. Several rock bands, including Nirvana and Green Day were influenced by the Ramones.\nThe Ramones had their first gigs at the club CBGB in New York. The letters \"CBGB\" stand for Country, BlueGrass, Blues. The club was opened in 1973 by Hilly Kristal. CBGB, soon afterward, became a place where new wave and punk rock bands played. These included Patti Smith Group, Blondie, Talking Heads and many others. From the early 1980s onward, CBGB was known for hardcore punk. "}

{"id": "14139", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14139", "title": "Turtle", "text": "Turtles are the reptile order Testudines. They have a special bony or cartilaginous shell developed from their ribs that acts as a shield.\nThe order Testudines includes both living and extinct species. The earliest fossil turtle comes from the early Upper Triassic of China, about 220 million years ago. So turtles are one of the oldest surviving reptile groups and a more ancient group than lizards, snakes and crocodiles.\nMolecular evidence shows they are definitely archosauromorphs, the group of diapsid reptiles which also includes the dinosaurs.box 5.1, p123/4\nTurtles have been very successful, and have almost world-wide distribution. But, of the many species alive today, some are highly endangered.\nTurtle, tortoise, or terrapin.\nAlthough the word turtle is widely used to describe all members of the order Testudines, it is also common to see certain members described as terrapins, tortoises or sea turtles, as well. How these names are used, if at all, depends on the type of English.\nTo avoid confusion, the word \"chelonian\" is popular among some who work with these animals, as a catch-all name. Unfortunately, \"Chelonia\" is also the name of a particular genus of turtles, so this conflicts with its use for the entire order Testudines.\nEcology and life history.\nAlthough many turtles spend much of their lives underwater, all turtles and tortoises breathe air, and must surface at regular intervals to refill their lungs. Some spend their whole lives on dry land.\nAquatic respiration in Australian freshwater turtles is being studied. Some species have large cloacal cavities that are lined with many finger-like projections. These projections, called papillae, have a rich blood supply, and increase the surface area. The turtles can take up dissolved oxygen from the water using these papillae, in much the same way that fish use gills to respire.\nLike other reptiles, turtles lay eggs which are slightly soft and leathery. The eggs of the largest species are spherical, while the eggs of the rest are elongated. Sea turtles lay their eggs on dry, sandy beaches. Turtles can take many years to reach breeding age, and in many cases breed every few years rather than annually.\nIn some species, there is temperature-dependent sex determination. Temperature determines whether an egg develops into a male or a female: a higher temperature causes a female, a lower temperature causes a male. Large numbers of eggs are deposited in holes dug into mud or sand. They are then covered and left to incubate by themselves. When the turtles hatch, they squirm their way to the surface and head toward the water. No turtle mother cares for its young.\nLong-lived.\nResearchers have recently discovered a turtle\u2019s organs do not gradually break down or become less efficient over time, unlike most other animals. It was found that the liver, lungs, and kidneys of a centenarian turtle are almost identical with that of its young counterpart. This has inspired genetic researchers to begin examining the turtle genome for longevity genes.\nAnatomy.\nNeck folding.\nTurtles are divided into two groups, according to how they evolved a solution to the problem of withdrawing their necks into their shells. The Cryptodira (hidden neck) can draw their necks in while contracting it under their spine. The Pleurodira (side neck), now found only in fresh water environments in the Southern hemisphere, contract their necks to the side. So, the important adaptation of head withdrawing evolved twice from ancestral turtles which did not have this ability.\nFeeding.\nTurtles have a hard beak. Turtles use their jaws to cut and chew food. Instead of teeth, the upper and lower jaws of the turtle are covered by horny ridges. Carnivorous turtles usually have knife-sharp ridges for slicing through their prey. Herbivorous turtles have serrated-edged ridges that help them cut through tough plants. Turtles use their tongues to swallow food, but they cannot, unlike most reptiles, stick out their tongues to catch food.\nShell.\nThe upper shell of the turtle is called the carapace. The lower shell that encases the belly is called the plastron. The carapace and plastron are joined together on the turtle's sides by bony structures called \"bridges\".\nThe inner layer of a turtle's shell is made up of about 60 bones. It includes parts of the backbone and the ribs, meaning the turtle cannot crawl out of its shell. In most turtles, the outer layer of the shell is covered by horny scales called scutes that are part of its outer skin, or epidermis. Scutes are made up of a fibrous protein called keratin that also makes up the scales of other reptiles. These scutes overlap the seams between the shell bones and add strength to the shell. Some turtles do not have horny scutes. For example, the leatherback sea turtle and the soft-shelled turtles have shells covered with leathery skin instead.\nLargest living.\nThe largest chelonian is a marine turtle, the great leatherback sea turtle, which reaches a shell length of 200\u00a0cm (80\u00a0inches) and can reach a weight of over 900\u00a0kg (2,000\u00a0lb, or 1 short ton). Freshwater turtles are generally smaller, but with the largest species, the Asian softshell turtle \"Pelochelys cantorii\", a few individuals have been reported to measure up to 200\u00a0cm or 80 in (Das, 1991). This dwarfs even the better-known alligator snapping turtle, the largest chelonian in North America, which attains a shell length of up to 80\u00a0cm (31\u00bd in) and a weight of about 60\u00a0kg (170\u00a0lb).\nThe lagest fossil turtle, \"Archelon\", was more than twice the length of the leatherback, at up to 4.5\u00a0metres.\nEvolution.\nThe first fossil proto-turtles come from Upper Triassic of the Mesozoic era, about 220 million years ago. Their shell evolved from bony extensions of their backbones and broad ribs that expanded and grew together to form a complete shell. It offered protection at every stage of its evolution, even when the bony component of the shell was not complete. This proved a long-lasting adaptation, and the group as a whole has survived many changes in the seas, and several extinction events.\nFossils of the freshwater \"Odontochelys semitestacea\" or \"half-shelled turtle with teeth\", from the later Triassic, have been found in southwest China. \"Odontochelys\" displays a complete bony plastron and an incomplete carapace, similar to an early stage of turtle embryonic development. By the Upper Jurassic, turtles had radiated widely, and their fossil history becomes easier to read.\nTheir exact ancestry has been a puzzle. Early amniotes had no openings in the skull behind the eyes. Openings developed in both Sauropsid and Synapsid skulls. They made the skull lighter, gave attachment points for muscles, and gave room for muscle bulges. But turtles do not have these skull openings. They were called 'anapsids', meaning 'no openings'.\nEventually it was suggested that turtles evolved from sauropsids which had skull openings, but turtles lost them as part of their evolution towards heavy defensive armour. All molecular studies have strongly upheld the placement of turtles within diapsids; some place turtles within Archosauria, or as a sister group to extant archosaurs.\nThe earliest known fully shelled turtles are the late Triassic \"Odontochelys\", \"Chinlechelys\" and \"Proganochelys\". The first-named genus was aquatic, but the second was probably terrestrial. They already had many advanced turtle traits, and thus probably had many millions of years of preceding turtle evolution and species in their ancestry. They did lack the ability to pull their heads into their shell (and they had a long neck), and (\"Odontochelys\") had a long, spiked tail ending in a club, a body form similar to that of ankylosaurs, resulting from convergent evolution.\nTurtles are divided into two living suborders, the Cryptodira and the Pleurodira. The Cryptodira is the larger of the two groups and includes all the marine turtles, the terrestrial tortoises, and many of the freshwater turtles. The Pleurodira are sometimes known as the side-necked turtles, a reference to the way they withdraw their heads into their shells. This smaller group mostly consists of freshwater turtles."}

Generally, they are among the smaller whales. Most live in salt water oceans, but some live in rivers there are oceanic dolphins and river dolphins. Dolphins are from to long, but the largest dolphin, the killer whale (or orca), can be up to long. \nAll dolphins live in groups called \"pods\". They are social animals at all stages of their life. They have some remarkable behaviours. A speeding group of dolphins is a sight to see. They \"porpoise\" in and out of the water at high speed. The function of this is not known for sure. It may be the fastest movement they are capable of. What they eat, almost exclusively, is fish. When they chase fish, the fish go into a \"bait ball\" to self-protect. In turn, the dolphins attack in a group and eat as many fish as they can.\nThe name 'dolphin' comes from the Ancient Greek \u03b4\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u03af\u03c2 (\"delphis\") meaning \"with a womb\", because it was first thought to be a fish with a womb. It is now known to be a mammal, and quite an intelligent mammal. Dolphins breathe air. A dolphin's nose is on top of its head so the dolphin can easily breathe on the surface of the water. The skin of a dolphin has no scales. It is soft and smooth. However, it is very firm, due to how much muscle they have. Dolphins use echolocation to find their food.\nThe skin of a bottlenose dolphin is gray, smooth, and rubbery. They are always social. They can help each other fight off predators. Dolphins have fought off sharks in this way. They can kill large sharks by ramming them over and over again with their snouts and heads. They look after the young, when the mothers need to leave their calves to hunt for food. The young need to breathe more often than the adults, and the food may be in deeper waters.\nOceanic dolphins are marine animals living in the sea. They live in all of the oceans.\nThree of the four species of river dolphins live in fresh water rivers. The La Plata dolphin lives in saltwater estuaries and the ocean. Water pollution and the loss of habitat are a threat to some dolphins, especially those living in rivers and estuaries.\nSleep.\nDolphins (and other cetaceans) sleep in the water. There is danger from animals that eat dolphins. Dolphins sleep differently than a person. Dolphins have two sides of their brain, which they use to sleep. One side sleeps, while the other side stays awake. Dolphins do things while asleep: \nDolphin groups or species have their own way of sleeping. Pinnipeds, like seals, can sleep like dolphins.\nSenses.\nThe brain of a dolphin is like a human brain in size and development. Dolphins have reasonable eyesight. They can watch a thing in the water, and they can see colors, too. They can also see in dark places.\nA dolphin's hearing is better than their sight. There are small holes behind the eyes, and they are the ears of a dolphin. Dolphins can hear a sound underwater. They can know the direction of the sound very well.\nDolphins and humans.\nMythology.\nDolphins have long played a role in human culture. Dolphins are common in Greek mythology and there are many coins from ancient Greece which feature a man or boy or deity riding on the back of a dolphin. The Ancient Greeks welcomed dolphins; spotting dolphins riding in a ship\u2019s wake was considered a good omen. In Hindu mythology, the Ganges River Dolphin is associated with Ganga, the deity of the Ganges river.\nCuisine.\nDolphin meat is eaten in a few countries, including Japan and Peru (where it is referred to as \"chancho marino\", or \"sea pork\"). Japan may be the best-known and most controversial example, but eating dolphin is not that common.\nDolphin therapy.\nDolphin therapy is sometimes used for people with mental or physical handicaps. It involves contact with trained dolphins. It is not agreed whether this is any better than the usual treatments.\nScientists continue to study dolphin therapy.\nTaxonomy.\nOceanic dolphins (\"Delphinidae\").\n\"Some examples:\""}

They are the and its ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar (\"Sus scrofa\"), and other species. Pigs are in the Suidae family of even-toed ungulates. \nRelated, but outside the genus, are the babirusa and the warthog. Pigs, like all suids, are native to the Old World. Baby pigs are called piglets or pups. Pigs are omnivores and are very social and intelligent animals.\nThe pig has stout, barrel-shaped bodies, with short legs.\nThe flesh of domestic pigs is eaten as food and is called pork. The Jewish and Muslim religions, and some Christian denominations, believe eating pork is wrong. Pig farmers take care that the animals do not get diseases or parasites which might harm humans.\nDomestic pigs come in different colours, shapes and sizes. They are usually pink, but little pigs kept as pets (\"pot-bellied pigs\") are sometimes other colours. Pigs roll in mud to protect themselves from sunlight. Many people think that pigs are dirty and smell. In fact, they roll around in the mud to keep bugs and ticks away from their skin. This also helps to keep their skin moist and lower their body temperature on hot days. They are omnivores, which means that they eat both plants and animals. \nPigs are intelligent animals. They are even able to learn how to play video games. \nPigs are commonly used as working animals. They are used to hunt for truffles, pull carts and sniff out landmines. Pig races exist.\nCare.\nPigs need a warm, clean area under a roof to sleep, and they should not be crowded. They need to be checked for sickness regularly. Pigs need lots of water. Over half their body weight is made up of water. Pigs should be given all the feed they will eat, which is usually four to five pounds a day for adult pigs. Corn is a good food for pigs, but they should also have protein supplements as well.\nPigs can be found throughout the world living on farms and in the wild, and they are also popular pets.

{"id": "14168", "revid": "1055293", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14168", "title": "Wheat", "text": "Wheat (Genus: \"Triticum\") is a cereal grain. People eat it most often in the form of bread. It is a kind of grass whose fruit is a \"head of wheat\" with edible seeds. It was first grown in the Levant, a region of the Near East. Now it is cultivated worldwide.\nWorld trade in wheat is greater than for all other crops combined. Globally, wheat is the leading source of vegetable protein in human food. It has a higher protein content than other major cereals such as maize (corn) or rice. In terms of total production, it is second to rice as the main human food crop and ahead of maize (maize is used more for animal feeds). Almost 800,000,000 tonnes are harvested every year.\nWheat was a key factor enabling the emergence of city-based societies at the start of civilization. It was one of the first crops that could be easily cultivated on a large scale, and its seeds could be stored for long periods in a dry climate. Wheat helped the growth of city-states in the Fertile Crescent, including the Babylonian, Assyrian and persian empires.\nWheat grain is a staple food used to make flour for leavened, flat and steamed breads, biscuits, cookies, cakes, breakfast cereal, pasta, noodles, couscous. It can also be fermented to make ethanol, for alcoholic drinks, or biofuel.\nAn allergy to wheat (mostly from its gluten) can cause coeliac disease, which makes the sufferer have diarrhoea if they eat any food containing wheat.\nDescription.\nThe wheat plant has long, slender leaves, stems that are hollow in most types of wheat plants, and heads that have many kinds of flowers, from 20 to 100. The flowers are grouped together in spikelets. Each spikelet has two to six flowers. In most spikelets, two or three of the flowers become fertilized, and this makes them produce the grains used for food.\nCultivated species of wheat.\nAll cultivated wheats have more than one normal diploid set of chromosomes. The increases in chromosome sets occurs naturally at a low rate. Because they have more chromosomes, their ears of wheat are larger. All man did was to select the plants with extra fat ears of wheat when they occurred. Now a whole range of cultivated wheats are available. These are just a few:\nHexaploid species (six sets of chromosomes)\nTetraploid species (four sets)\nDiploid species (normal two sets of chromosomes)\nEmmer wheat.\nEmmer wheat (\"Triticum dicoccum\"), or 'hulled wheat', is a type of \"awned\" wheat. It was one of the first crops domesticated in the Near East. It was widely cultivated in the ancient world, but is now a relict crop in mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.\nIn the wild, the awns of emmer wheat spikelets help them dig into the soil. With humidity in the night, the awns of the spikelet become erect and draw together, and in the process push the grain into the soil. During the day, the humidity drops and the awns slacken back again. During the course of days and nights, the awns' pumping movements drill the spikelet as much as an inch into the soil.\nEinkorn wheat.\nEinkorn wheat is one of the earliest cultivated forms of wheat, (\"Triticum monococcum\"). Grains of wild einkorn have been found in Paleolithic sites of the Fertile Crescent. It was first domesticated about 7500 BC (~9000 years ago), in the early Neolithic period. Evidence from DNA suggests einkorn was domesticated in southeast Turkey, where a number of early farming villages have been found. Its cultivation decreased in the Bronze Age, and today it is a relic crop that is rarely planted. It has found a new market as a health food. It is still used for bulgur (cracked wheat) or as animal feed, in mountainous areas of France, Libya, former Yugoslavia, Turkey and other countries. It often survives on poor soils where other species of wheat fail.\nEinkorn was domesticated at the same time as emmer wheat, but was not so important."}
{"id": "14169", "revid": "7883845", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14169", "title": "Taliban", "text": "The Taliban is a large Sunni Islamic fundamentalist militant group operating in Afghanistan. The group formed the government of Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001 and took military control of most of Afghanistan again in August 2021. After the Fall of Kabul on 15 August 2021, the Taliban now takes full control of Afghanistan.\nHistory.\nIn 1994 Taliban started a government in southern Afghanistan called the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. The first leader of the Taliban was Mullah Mohammed Omar.\nThe Taliban governed Afghanistan between 1996 and 2001. During this time, its leaders put in place the strictest forms of Sharia law ever seen in the Muslim world. Much criticism of the Taliban came from important Muslim scholars. For example, if a thief was caught stealing something the Taliban would cut off one of his hands so that he does not use it to steal again, no matter what it was that he stole. Many criminals were put to death quickly and without a fair trial and were executed in public. Anyone who refused to follow the law was considered a non-Muslim enemy. Every male had to go to mosque for prayer (except Afghan non-Muslims) during praying times, which is five times per day. \nThe Taliban became known around the world for their very bad treatment of women and girls, denying them human rights. They also treated the Shia Muslim (who they consider heretics) and non-Muslim minorities (who are Hindus and Sikhs) very badly. Every form of art, music and entertainment was strictly banned under their rule, and sculptures, paintings, photos, cameras, televisions, etc. were destroyed. The Taliban also did cultural genocide when they destroyed the Buddhas of Bamiyan in February and March 2001, because they consider the display of human and animal figures a sin.\nAfter the September 11 attacks in 2001, the United States invaded Afghanistan. The Taliban had been giving its ally al-Qaeda a safe base from which to operate. The United States government said that Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda members did the attacks in the U.S. The Taliban asked the U.S. for proof of this before it would arrest them. The aim of the invasion was to remove the Taliban government from power, destroy al-Qaeda and capture bin Laden. After losing power in 2001, the Taliban had its headquarters in Pakistan.\nIn February 2020, the United States and the Taliban signed the Doha Agreement that would remove all U.S. troops from Afghanistan by May 1, 2021. President of the United States Joe Biden said that the U.S. exit from Afghanistan would start on May 1, 2021 and end by September 11, 2021, which would be exactly 20 years since the September 11 attacks.\nOn 15 August 2021, the Taliban captured Kabul and the Afghan government collapsed, with the Taliban taking control of most of Afghanistan. On 30 August 2021, the Taliban had took full control of the country and ending the War in Afghanistan, after the evacuations from Afghanistan ended.\nEconomy.\nIt is estimated that in 2020 the Taliban had an income of $1.6 billion, mostly from drugs, mining, extortion and taxes, donations (or gifts) and exports.\nThe Taliban have financed themselves mostly from selling illegal drugs. A big part of the opium sold worldwide comes from Afghanistan: The Taliban grow the poppies (which are used to make opium). Another part of their income is racketeering: they offer \"protection\" in exchange for money. They also take taxes (in accordance with Islamic law, as they claim) in the areas they control. Finally, there's financial support in the form of donations, from abroad. Most of the donations come from countries around the Persian Gulf; many donations also come from Pakistan.\nAn article in 2021 in the Wall Street Journal said that there is [financing or] \"funding from the opium trade and extortion schemes [... for] Taliban operations\".\nTaliban views on society.\nIn the past, the Taliban had views on society that are stricter than those of many other Islamic countries:\nThey had the following rules for girls and women:\nHuman trafficking.\nSeveral Taliban and al-Qaeda commanders ran a network of human trafficking. They abducted girls and women from ethnic minorities and sold them into sex slavery in Afghanistan and Pakistan. \"Time\" magazine writes: \"The Taliban often argued that the restrictions they placed on women were actually a way of [worshipping] and protecting the opposite sex. The behavior of the Taliban during the six years they expanded their rule in Afghanistan made a mockery of that claim.\"\nThe targets for human trafficking were mostly women from non-Pashtun ethnic groups in Afghanistan. Some women preferred to commit suicide rather than become slaves.. During one Taliban and al-Qaeda offensive in 1999 in the Shomali Plains alone, more than 600 women were kidnapped. Arab and Pakistani al-Qaeda militants, with local Taliban forces, forced them into trucks and buses. \"Time\" magazine writes: \"The trail of the missing Shomali women leads to Jalalabad, not far from the Pakistan border. There, according to eyewitnesses, the women were penned up inside Sar Shahi camp in the desert. The more desirable among them were selected and taken away. Some were trucked to Peshawar with the apparent complicity of Pakistani border guards. Others were taken to Khost, where bin Laden had several training camps.\" Officials from relief agencies say, the trail of many of the vanished women leads to Pakistan where they were sold to brothels or into private households to be kept as slaves.\nNot all Taliban commanders took part in human trafficking. Many were opposed to the practice. Nuruludah, a Taliban commander, is quoted as saying that in the Shomali Plains, he and ten of his men freed some women who were being abducted by Pakistani members of al-Qaeda. In Jalalabad, local Taliban commanders freed women that were being held by Arab members of al-Qaeda in a camp.\nTaliban violence against civilians.\nIn their attacks, the Taliban also target civilians in Afghanistan. According to a report by the United Nations, the Taliban were responsible for over 76% of civilian casualties in 2009. In 2010, the Taliban were again reponsible for over three quarters of the civilian casualties. Civilians are targets of Taliban attacks twice as often as forces of the Afghan government, or troops of ISAF.\nIn 2011, the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIGRC) said that Taliban fighters targeting civilians was a \"war crime\". Religious leaders condemned the attacks on civilans, saying they were against Islamic ethics.\nAlso in 2011, human rights organisations pressed the International Criminal Court in Den Haag, to start investigations whether the Taliban committed war crimes.\nRelationship with militant groups (outside Afghanistan).\nTehrik-i-Taliban.\nTehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan operates in northwestern Pakistan and is sometimes called the Pakistani Taliban, but they are a separate group.\nBefore the beginning of Tehrik-i-Taliban some of its (later) leaders and fighters were part of the 8,000 Pakistani militants fighting in the War in Afghanistan (1996\u20132001) and the War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present) against the United Islamic Front and NATO forces. Most of them come from the Pakistani side of the Af-Pak border regions. After the fall of the Afghan Taliban in late 2001 most Pakistani militants including members of today's TTP escaped (home) to Pakistan.\nPeace talks.\nAt the peace talks in Doha, there is little or no progress (as of 2021's third quarter)."}

When a person has fear, they are afraid or scared. A person who fears something does not want it to happen. The fear response comes from sensing danger. It leads to the fight-or-flight response. In extreme cases of fear (horror and terror) there may be a freeze response or paralysis.\nIn humans and animals, fear is adjusted by cognition and learning. Thus fear is rational or appropriate, or it is irrational or inappropriate. An irrational fear is called a phobia.\nFear is the body's way of protecting itself from doing things that may be dangerous. For example, if one has a fear of jumping off a cliff, he/she will not do it. This saves one from death. In this case, fear is a good thing but in others, it can be bad. An example of fear being bad is if it stops one from doing something important, like going to see a doctor. Methods of controlling phobias include facing the fear over and over so the effect of the phobia becomes less until it stops being a phobia.\nThere is only a small set of basic or innate emotions and fear is one of them.

When titanium mixes with oxygen from the air, it forms titanium dioxide (TiO2), or titania. Titanium dioxide is a white pigment that is often used to make things less transparent, brighter, or rougher - because it does not react with chemicals inside the human body, it is safe to use in foods and other applications, like toothpaste. Pieces of titanium metal are protected by a shell of titanium dioxide, which forms when the metal is in the air and helps prevent chemicals from damaging the metal centre. \nTitanium alloys are used in aerospace engineering to make very strong and light parts of aeroplanes. These alloys can replace steel because they are almost as strong as steel but much less heavy, and are much stronger than aluminium alloys but only a little heavier. This means that the titanium parts can be thinner and lighter, but still withstand the same forces. It does not corrode in many conditions, not even in sea water and chlorine. However, it can burn at high temperatures, and like many metal powders, titanium dust is extremely flammable. "}

However, Modern Hebrew is quite different from Biblical Hebrew, with a simpler grammar and many loanwords from other languages, especially English.\nAs of 2021, Hebrew has been the only dead language that had been made into a living language again.\nThe Hebrew Bible was originally written in Biblical Hebrew.\nGrammar.\nHebrew is a Semitic language. Arabic is another semetic language and is similar to Hebrew. Hebrew words are made by combining a root with a pattern. In Israeli Hebrew, some words are translated from European languages like English, French, German, and Russian. Many words from the Old Testament were given new meanings in Israeli Hebrew. People learning Hebrew need to study the grammar first so that they can read correctly without vowels.\nIn Israeli Hebrew, there is no verb \"to be\" in the present tense, but only in the future and the past tenses. In Biblical Hebrew, there are no tenses but only two aspects: imperfect and perfect. The imperfect is something like the future and the present tenses. The perfect is something like the past tense. Mishnaic Hebrew was spoken as well as Judeo-Aramaic in the time of Jesus and in the time of the Bar-Kokhba revolt (2nd century AD) until the Byzantine Empire of Justinian (6th century AD).\nThe Hebrew alphabet has been adapted to write Yiddish, another Jewish language. However, Yiddish is different from Hebrew because Yiddish comes from a mix of German, Hebrew and other languages.\nAlphabet.\nThe Hebrew alphabet has 22 letters. Five of them change when they are at the end of a word. Hebrew is read and written from right to left. The first three letters, aleph, beth and gimel, are also used in mathematics in the context of transfinite numbers.\nThe Hebrew alphabet is an \"abjad\" and so only the consonants are written, and readers must supply the vowels. Since that can be difficult, the vowels can be marked as dots called \u201cnikkud\u201d or \u201ctnuah\u201d (plural \u201dnikkud\u201d signs and \u201ctnuot\u201d respectively.) In Modern Hebrew, some letters can denote vowels, which are called \"matres lectionis\" (mothers of the reading) since they greatly help reading. Vav (or Waw) can make the 'oo' sound (/u/ in IPA) like in food. Yodh (or Yud) can make the 'ee' sound (/i/ in IPA) like in feed."}

She is also a Catholic saint. She was a peasant girl born in the east of France. Joan said that she had visions from God. In these visions, she said that God told her to take back her home, which was then under English rule late in the Hundred Years' War. Many quick military victories made her famous. In 1430, soldiers of Burgundy captured her and gave her to her English enemies.\nJoan of Arc has remained an important figure in Western civilization. Famous writers like Shakespeare, Tchaikovsky, Mark Twain, and Voltaire wrote about her. She appears in video games, television, movies, songs, and dances.\nVisions of Joan of Arc.\nWhen Joan of Arc was put on trial, she said no to the customary courtroom rules about a witness's oath. She said she would not answer every question about her visions. She complained that the normal witness oath would not be right because she had an oath that she had given to the king. It is not known how much the record which reports this has been changed by dishonest court officials or her possible lies to protect state secrets. Some historians simply say that her belief in her duty was more important than where the visions came from.\nMost people say that she was healthy and that she was not crazy. Recently, people have tried to explain her visions through things like epilepsy, migraine, tuberculosis, and schizophrenia. None of these guesses have been greatly supported. This is because, even though seeing visions can be through different diseases, other facts of Joan's life do not agree with these ideas. Two experts who studied a teberculoma hypothesis in the medical journal \"Neuropsychobiology \"said: \"It is difficult to draw final conclusions, but it would seem unlikely that widespread tuberculosis, a serious disease, was present in this 'patient' whose life-style and activities would surely have been impossible had such a serious disease been present.\" Ralph Hoffman, professor of psychology at Yale University, points out that visions, like \"hearing voices\" are not always signs of mental illness. He says that her religious inspiration was possibly a reason. However, he does not say any other reasons.\nNonetheless, the court of Charles VII was obsessed about her mental health.\nExecution.\nJoan was tried by a French inquisitorial tribunal under English control. The Church said Joan should be killed for wearing men's clothes even after being warned not to. Joan agreed to wear women's clothes. She wore male clothes again. This might have been to protect herself from being attacked. It could also have been, as Jean Massieu said, because her dress had been stolen and she was left with nothing else to wear.\nShe was burned on a stake on 30 May 1431, at age 19. After she died, the English showed people her burnt body so no one could say she had escaped alive. Then they burned the body two times again to turn it into ashes. They put what was left of her in the Seine. The executioner, Geoffroy Therage, later said that he \"...greatly feared to be damned.\""}

He is a 15-year old blue hedgehog who can run at the speed of sound. By curling into a ball and spinning quickly, he can do a helpful \"Spin Attack\" which he uses to defeat the villains and save the day. He has been in many games made by the company Sega, but also in television series, books and comics (published in America by Archie Comics). He has many friends, including Miles \"Tails\" Prower, a two-tailed fox that can fly by spinning his tails very quickly or Knuckles the Echidna (who is strong, and has been in Sonic games since \"Sonic the Hedgehog 3\"). With them, he fights against his arch nemesis Doctor Eggman, an evil scientist attempting to conquer the world.\nSonic's appearances.\nIn games.\nSonic is the mascot of Sega, which created it in the early 1990s. At first, Sega wanted Doctor Eggman to be their mascot, and a good guy. But, the people in Sega liked the new idea of making a blue hedgehog as the mascot. Doctor Eggman settled as the bad guy instead. Sonic\u2019s franchise has grown, and more characters are displayed in games.\nHere is a list of some games Sonic is in:\nIn cartoons.\nHe appeared in his own made-for-video movie in 1999.\nIn most of the cartoons from the 1990s his voice was provided by Jaleel White (who was best known at the time for his role as Steve Urkel on the television show \"Family Matters\") and in later cartoons his voice was provided by Jason Griffith. Sonic also stars in his latest cartoon from Japan. It is called \"Sonic X\", although Sonic X has ended.\nHere is a list of cartoons Sonic is in:\nIn comic books.\nArchie Comics in America has been making comics with Sonic as the main character. He is also shown with famous characters like Knuckles and Tails, but with also a few new ones. Some of the characters are not in any Sonic games, but some are in a very old cartoon, \"Sonic the Hedgehog SatAM\", made by DiC in 1993.\nVoice actors.\nThroughout the years, Sonic has went through several different voice actors. Jaleel White began voicing the character in the DiC animated series \"Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog\", as well as \"Sonic SatAM\" and \"Sonic Underground\". White also reprised the role again in the 2013 \"Sonic\" fan film.\nBeginning in 1998, Sonic was voiced by Ryan Drummond, starting with \"Sonic Adventure\". He continued to voice the character for six more years until 2004, his final performance as Sonic was in \"Sonic Advance 3\". Drummond was replaced by Jason Griffith starting with the anime series, \"Sonic X\", with Griffith voicing Sonic within the games starting with \"Shadow The Hedgehog\" in 2005, he voiced the character for four more years until 2009 in \"Sonic and the Black Knight\". However, his recycled dialogue as Sonic was used in \"Sonic &amp; SEGA All-Stars Racing\". After his departure from the role in 2010, Griffith did continue to voice Sonic in various 4Kids promotions until September 2014, when the Vortexx program came to an end.\nGriffith was replaced by Roger Craig Smith, starting with \"Sonic Free Riders\" and \"Sonic Colors\". Smith announced on his Twitter account on January 29, 2021, that he would no longer voice Sonic, with his departure confirmed by Sega the same day. On May 26, 2021, Smith announced that he will continue to voice Sonic once again. Ben Schwartz voiced Sonic in the 2020 feature film, and will reprise his role for the 2022 sequel."}

It has between 5000-7000 spines on its back. There are hedgehogs in Europe, Asia, Africa, and New Zealand. When attacked or threatened, it curls up. Hedgehogs eat insects, snails, frogs and toads, snakes, bird eggs, carrion, mushrooms, berries and melons. Sometimes, hedgehogs will search for earthworms after rainstorms.\nHedgehogs are nocturnal animals and they hibernate between November and March.\nDescription.\nHedgehogs have long spines, or quills, made of keratin. They do not come off easily, unlike porcupines, but in baby hedgehogs, the baby quills drop off and are replaced with adult quills. This is called \"quilling\". When they are very stressed or sick, their quills can fall off, too. Their quills are not poisonous: they are safe for humans to feel and touch, as they are not very sharp, or harmful.\nPets.\nSome people keep hedgehogs as pets. African pygmy hedgehogs are the most common type that are kept as pets. They live 2-4 years in captivity. Hedgehogs are exotic pets, which means they may not be legal to keep as pets in some places.

It is developed and owned by Square Enix. Final Fantasy is a series of fantasy and science fantasy role-playing video games (RPGs). It also includes movies, anime, printed media, and other products.\nThe first game was published in 1987. The game was a success. It had sequels. The video game has since branched into other Video game genres. Some of these genres are tactical role-playing, action role-playing, massively multiplayer online role-playing, racing, third-person shooter, fighting, and rhythm.\nMost \"Final Fantasy\" games are independent stories. They have different settings and main characters. Recurring elements include plot themes, character names, and game mechanics. Plots center on a group of heroes fighting evil and exploring their internal struggles and relationships. Character names are borrowed from history, languages, and mythologies of many cultures.\nThe series is a commercial and critical success. It is Square Enix's best selling video game franchise. It sold more than units. It is one of the best-selling video game franchises. It was awarded a star on the Walk of Game in 2006. It has seven Guinness World Records in the \"Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition 2008\". Final Fantasy is known for its innovation, visuals, and music. It includes full motion videos, photo-realistic character models, and orchestra music by Nobuo Uematsu.\nTypes.\nThere are two main types of \"Final Fantasy\" game: the main series, where the games are just numbered with Roman numbers, and several related games and spinoffs. Each of the games in the main series have very little to do with each other, with its own setting, story, and characters. Some exceptions include \"Final Fantasy X\" and \"X-2\", the sequel, or \"Final Fantasy XIII\" and \"Final Fantasy XIII-2\" and \"Lightning Returns\". But the games are connected through the gameplay, themes, and 'style'. Newer sequels and prequels are \"Final Fantasy X-2\" and the \"Compilation of Final Fantasy VII\" games and films.\nHistory.\nSince 1987, more than seventeen games have been released. The series started on Nintendo Entertainment System, but today most \"Final Fantasy\" games are made for the Sony PlayStation or PlayStation 2. Games have also been released for the Nintendo Game Boy and GameCube. \"Final Fantasy VII\" is generally regarded as one of the pinnacle achievements of gaming. A must-play for any gamer.\nIn 2001, Columbia Pictures made a CGI movie called \"\".\nExceptions.\nWhile it is not actually a \"Final Fantasy\" game, one game called \"Final Fantasy Adventure\" was released in America for the Nintendo Game Boy. The game was actually a prequel to the SNES game \"Secret of Mana\", but was released in the United States with the name \"Final Fantasy\" to boost sales. In 2003 it was remade for the Game Boy Advance with the title \"Sword of Mana\". In Japan, the Mana series is called \"Seiken Densetsu\", which means \"Legend of the Sword.\" There are three games in the series, but only the first two, \"Secret of Mana\" and \"Sword of Mana\", have been released in the United States.\nGameplay.\nIn \"Final Fantasy\", players control a group of characters. They go through the game's story by exploring the game world and defeating enemies. Enemies are found randomly. This changed in \"Final Fantasy\u00a0XI\" and \"Final Fantasy\u00a0XII\". The player gives combat orders. These orders are \"Fight\", \"Magic\", and \"Item\". The orders are given to individual characters through a menu. This menu appears when in battles.\nThe games have used different battle systems. Before \"Final Fantasy\u00a0XI\", battles were turn-based. The main characters and bad characters were on different sides of the battlefield. \"Final Fantasy\u00a0IV\" introduced the \"Active Time Battle\" (ATB) system. It made better the turn-based system with a time-keeping system. This system was designed by Hiroyuki Ito. It gave a feeling of urgency and excitement to the fights. It required the player to act before an enemy attacks. It was used until \"Final Fantasy\u00a0X\". This game had the \"Conditional Turn-Based\" (CTB) system. This new system returned to the old turn-based system.\nMagic is common in the game. The way characters get magic depends on the game. It is generally divided into classes organized by color: \"White magic\" focuses on spells that heal teammates; \"Black magic\" focuses on hurting enemies; \"Red magic\" is a combination of white and black magic, \"Blue magic\" copies enemy attacks; and \"Green magic\" focuses on applying status effects to teammates or enemies.\nThere are other types of magic like \"Time magic\". This magic focuses on time, space, and gravity; \"Summoning magic\" brings legendary creatures to help in battle. This magic has appeared since \"Final Fantasy\u00a0III\". Summoned creatures are called names like \"Espers\" or \"Eidolons\". They are inspired by mythologies from Arabic, Hindu, Norse, and Greek cultures. \nDifferent means of transportation have appeared through the series. The most common is the airship. There are also chocobos for travelling short distances. Others include sea and land vehicles. Following \"Final Fantasy\u00a0VII\", more modern and futuristic vehicles have appeared.\nReleased Final Fantasy games.\nFor Nintendo Entertainment System:\nFor Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES):\nFor Sony PlayStation:\nFor Sony PlayStation 2:\nFor PlayStation 3:\nFor Sony PlayStation 4\nFor Xbox 360:\nFor Xbox One:\nFor Nintendo Gameboy:\nFor Nintendo Gameboy Advance\nFor Nintendo GameCube:\nFor Nintendo Wii:\nFor Nintendo DS:\nFor PlayStation Portable:\nFor PC:\nFuture Games.\nA list of upcoming \"Final Fantasy\" games."}

{"id": "14191", "revid": "534290", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14191", "title": "Bullet", "text": "Bullets are small metal objects fired from guns. Many kinds of bullets are made from lead covered with copper. They are put into a package called a cartridge. The cartridge is put into a gun. The bullet is at the front of the cartridge (number 1 in the picture). The bullet is pushed out of the gun by hot gases at a high pressure. A powder called gunpowder (number 3 in the picture) is put inside the case (number 2). A small explosion from the primer (number 5 in the picture) lights the gunpowder. The gunpowder burns very fast. It makes hot gases. The hot gases are at a high pressure. The high pressure pushes the bullet out of the gun barrel at a high speed. \nBullets are weapons. Soldiers and police use them. They are used for self-defense. They are used for hunting animals for food or as a sport. They are used for shooting targets. There are many kinds of bullet. Each gun takes a certain size, or caliber, of bullet. Rifles and handguns use different kinds and sometimes a gun uses more than one kind of bullet.\nAlthough the word \"bullet\" is often used for a cartridge round, a bullet is \"not\" a cartridge but rather a part of one. A round of ammunition cartridge includes the bullet (which is the projectile), the case (which holds everything together), the propellant (which provides most of the energy to shoot it) and the primer (which ignites the propellant). \nDesign.\nBullet designs have to solve two main problems. A bullet must fit tightly in the gun's bore (inside of the barrel). If it does not fit tightly, gas from the burning gunpowder leaks past the bullet and does not help push it out. The bullet must also fit tightly against the rifling (spiral grooves cut into the barrel), but not so tightly that it causes damage. Bullets must have this tight fit without causing too much friction. Bullets must be made to a high standard. Poorly made bullets may not be accurate. Poorly made bullets can damage the gun or hurt the person using the gun. The way the bullet behaves in the barrel is called 'internal ballistics'.\nThe laws of physics can be used to understand how a bullet moves after it leaves the barrel. The way the bullet behaves after it leaves the barrel is called 'external ballistics'. The main factors affecting the aerodynamics of a bullet in flight are the bullet's shape and the rotation from the rifling of the gun barrel. Spinning helps stabilize the bullet gyroscopically and aerodynamically (spinning keeps it on track). Any small differences in the shape of the bullet are mostly canceled as it spins. The first guns did not have rifling. With smoothbore firearms (no rifling), a round bullet was best because it was the same in any position. But these bullets were not very stable. They were also not very accurate. Still, the round shape of bullets did not change very much for hundreds of years.\nBullet design also affects what happens when a bullet hits an object. The way a bullet behaves when it hits a target is called 'terminal ballistics.' The make-up and density of the target material, the angle at which the bullet hits, and the speed and design of the bullet itself are all factors. Bullets are usually made to go into a target, change shape, and/or break apart. For a given material and bullet, the speed of the bullet is the main factor determining what happens.\nMaking bullets go faster increases the kinetic energy even more. This effect is big, so people have tried (and succeeded) to make bullets that go faster and weigh less. Modern firearms take much lighter bullets and shoot them much faster than was the case in World War I. This makes the firearms better in two ways. The magazine (which holds the cartridges in the gun before they are fired) holds more of the smaller, lighter bullets. Also, the higher speed causes much more damage than the old-style bullets.\nBullet types.\nRifle bullet.\n Rifles are used for target shooting and killing. A rifle bullet can be described by its accuracy, penetration, shape, size, and mass (weight). There are many different kinds of rifle bullets.\nThe Full Metal Jacket (FMJ) is a type of bullet commonly used by the military. A lead center (core) is surrounded by a strong metal coating (jacket). This jacket is usually made of a copper alloy, but sometimes it is made of steel. The FMJ does not spread out when it hits a target. It goes deep into its target and is a general-purpose bullet. The FMJ is not recommended for hunting. It is mostly for target shooting and military use.\nThe Jacketed Hollow Point (JHP) has a lead center (core) with lead showing at the tip. It also has a strong metal coating (jacket). The center of the tip has a hole in it (hollow point). This design makes the tip of the JHP quickly start to spread out (expand) when it hits a target. The hollow point bullet in a rifle can be as small as a pin. When the hollow point is this small, the bullet will go faster and still spread out when it hits a living target. In some hollow point rifle bullets, the front may spread out to two times as wide as the bullet was when it started. It is a good hunting bullet because the energy in the bullet is transferred to the target at a known depth. The jacketed hollow point tends to be accurate and is sturdy.\nThe plastic tipped bullet is a hollow point bullet. The hollow point is filled with a hard, pointed plastic tip. It is used because it can go further than the JHP and does not curve as much. The plastic tipped bullet also spreads out or breaks into pieces when it hits the target.\nA solid copper bullet is a bullet that has no lead core or other elements than copper. This bullet expands into a flower shape when it hits a target, because copper bullets are usually hollow point. The copper bullet contains no lead, so it is also better for the environment. In rifles, it is widely used for hunting and other sports.\nA frangible bullet will break into many pieces upon contact with any material harder than itself. This bullet is used for safety while shooting. It has little impact on the environment. It also makes the objects behind the intended target a little safer.\nHandgun bullet.\nHandguns are mostly used for sport target shooting or self-defense. Police use the pistol because they can easily carry it and have it ready to use.\nPistol bullets have some of the same names as rifle bullets, such as full metal jacket (FMJ) or jacketed hollow point (JHP). For example, there are hollow point pistol bullets that also spread out a lot when they hit a target. However, in a pistol bullet, the hollow point can be much larger. The hollow point causes the pistol bullet to slow down faster due to air resistance. However, a pistol bullet does not have to travel as far as a rifle bullet. The hollow point in a pistol bullet can be almost as wide as the bullet. When a hollow point pistol bullet hits a target, it almost completely flattens itself. A solid copper pistol bullet is usually hollow point, and is mainly used for self-defense and/or target shooting.\nA flat nosed bullet is mostly used in handguns, although there are also some rifle bullets called flat nosed. The flat nose on a pistol bullet can be as wide as the bullet. The \"flat nose\" on a rifle bullet may be much smaller. The flat nosed bullet tends to have a low ballistic coefficient. This means that it slows down faster than pointed bullets. Flat nosed bullets are sometimes used to prevent the explosion of the next cartridge in a magazine when the gun recoils. Flat nosed bullets also spread out quickly when they hit a target. This makes them useful for fighting at close range when the bullet should not hit what is behind the target. After hitting the target, it becomes almost inside out.\nA frangible pistol bullet will break apart on contact. It is usually made of a copper jacket over pieces of either round or twisted lead pieces that are glued together. The glue breaks apart when the bullet hits the target. The pieces spread out. This creates a larger surface area. This kind of bullet cannot go deep into a target. It is safer to use when it is important not to hit anything on the other side of the target."}

It is the largest city in Louisiana, and the 49th-largest city in the U.S. It is the capital of Orleans Parish. It was named in honour of the French Duke of Orl\u00e9ans (then Regent of France).\nHistory.\nThe city began as the capital of Louisiana (New France), part of the first French colonial empire at the mouth of the Mississippi River. It became a territory of the United States when President Thomas Jefferson bought the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. It became one of the world's great seaports. All the land is low, originally just a short vertical distance above sea level. In the last three hundred years, the city has sunk slowly into the marshy soil. Large portions of New Orleans are now below sea level. A system of many pumps, dikes, sea walls, and levees were built.\nThe Battle of New Orleans was fought here in 1815. The capture of New Orleans in 1863 was an important step in the defeat of the Confederacy in the American Civil War\nOver half of the grain that is sent by ship to other countries, comes first by barge through the Port of New Orleans. The grains are grown in the farming states bordering the Mississippi River, the Missouri River, and Ohio Rivers. Much of the crude oil that is made into gasoline and diesel fuel is brought to New Orleans for oil refinery and distribution to other parts of the United States by barge or oil pipeline. Also, there are many oil well platforms nearby, in the Gulf of Mexico.\nHurricane Katrina.\nOn August 29, 2005, New Orleans was affected by Hurricane Katrina. The special systems built to protect the city failed in several ways. It is estimated that more than three quarters (3/4) of New Orleans was under water in early September of 2005. Sewer, phone, electric and fresh water systems failed. Many people drowned. Many homes were completely covered with water. Important records, some from the French period of the 18th century were destroyed.\nFor years, many people believed that a flood in New Orleans would happen. A very serious flood happened several hundred miles upstream, on the Mississippi delta, when heavy rains fell in 1927. The hardships from that flood led many people to move away. Many moved to Chicago.\nAfter Hurricane Katrina, many people who lived in the flooded city moved to other places in the US. Many people were afraid to move back. Their jobs and homes were gone and their possessions were lost. The people who could move back spread to many other states. Texas received the most flood victims. Many volunteers and charities are helping the flood victims to relocate to new homes and, at the same time, repair homes and services in this city. Several years after Katrina, New Orleans still had much fewer people than it did before the hurricane.\nCulture.\nNew Orleans has a large African American, Creole and French population. Voodoo, brought by African slaves, is practiced in the city.\nNew Orleans is known for its French culture, French architecture, Creole and Cajun cuisine such as gumbo and jambalaya, and Mardi Gras."}

These forced bets must be at least matched by the other players in order to keep their hands. The big blind is twice as much as the small blind. If the big blind was $1000, then it is said that the blinds are 500 and 1000. This money is put into a place in the center of the table that is called the \"pot\"\nEach player is given two cards face down. These are called the player's \"Hole Cards\" or what the player has \"in the hole\". Once all the players have their hole cards, the betting starts. The player to the left of the Big Blind player starts the betting. The lowest amount that can be bet is the amount of the big blind. Players can bet more than the minimum. This is called \"Raising\". The amount a player can raise is determined by the type of the game being played (see below) If a player raises, the amount he raised the bet to is the new minimum. Each player in turn may either \"Call\" (pay the current bet amount), Raise, or \"Fold\" (quit the hand). This action keeps going around the table until each player has called or folded his hand.\nAfter the first turn of betting is over, the dealer lays three cards face up on the table. This is called the \"Flop\". These three cards are \"community cards\". This means they are used by every player in the game along with the two hole cards each player has. After the flop, another turn of betting takes place. There is no starting bet in this turn (no blinds) unless a player makes a bet. Players may \"Check\" or bet nothing if no player before them in the turn has bet. If everyone checks, or if a player bets and all the others call or fold, then the round of betting is over.\nNext the dealer lays another community card face up. This card is called \"the turn\" (or 4th Street). Another series of betting comes after this. This betting is the same as after the Flop.\nFinally the dealer lays the last community card known as \"the river\" (or 5th Street). This card is again followed by a turn of betting, calling and folding by the players.\nWith the five community cards and their two hole cards, each player makes the best 5 card poker hand he can. The player with the best poker hand wins the round and the pot. If two or more players have the same hand, those players split the pot evenly. If one person bets and all other players have folded, the hand ends then and that player wins.\nStyles of play.\nTexas Hold'em can be played several ways, including Limit, Pot Limit and No Limit games. The version of the game usually is the maximum a player can raise at any one time.\nLimit.\nLimit games have a set amount that a player can raise at any time. If a game has a $10 limit, then a raise must be exactly $10. If more than one person raises, each one can only raise $10 more than the last raise. Typically, there is a \"cap\" of 3 raises per round. Also, when playing limit, the bet and raise amount will usually double for the turn and river betting rounds.\nExample.\nIn a 4 player game, Player A bets $10. Player B raises $10 (puts in $20 total), Player C calls Player B (puts in $20). Player D at this point can either fold, pay $20 (call player B) or raise $10 to a total of $30. Player A would go next and either call (paying the difference between his $10 bet and the current bet). This would continue until all players either call or fold.\nPot Limit.\nIn Pot Limit games, the most a player can bet or raise is the total amount in the pot. With each bet or raise, the amount in the pot gets larger. This allows for larger raises.\nSpread Limit.\nIn Spread Limit games, there is both a minimum and a maximum raise specified. For example, one could play $5\u201350 spread limit. The big blind would be $5 and the minimum raise would be $5 and the maximum raise would be $50.\nNo Limit.\nIn No Limit, there is not a limit of how much can be bet at any time. That is, it is just like Spread Limit, but with no maximum. A player can bet up to all money as he has. If a player bets all of his money, he is said to be \"All In\". If a player bets more money than another player has, the second player can call by going All In. If only those two players stay in the hand (all other players fold), the first player takes back any money that is over the amount the player going All In has. At this point, all betting stops and the dealer deals out the rest of the cards.\nIf a player goes All In and two or more players are still betting, the other betters can raise each other until they both call (or one of them also goes All In). A \"side pot\" is made in this case. It is the difference between the final bet and the first person's All In. Only the two players were not All In can win this pot. If the All In player wins the hand, he wins the main pot (his money plus an equal amount from each other player) and which ever of the other two players had the better hand wins the side pot. In an eight player game, it is possible to have several side pots with several people being All In at the same time. If there are not two player left who can bet, betting stops and all players turn their hands over.\nExample.\nPlayer A bets $5000. Player B only has $3000. He goes All In. Player C Raises $2000 (puts in a total of $7000). Player A calls (puts in $2000). At this point, the main pot is worth $9000 ($3000 from each player). The side pot is worth $8000 ($7000\u20133000 from Players A and C)\nIf player A or C wins, he wins both the main pot and the side pot ($17,000) and Player B is out of the game since he is out of money. If player B wins, he wins the main pot and the side pot goes to which ever player has the best hand between players A and C.\nTournaments.\nTournaments are what people often see when poker is shown on television. When a player enters a tournament, he pays an entry fee called the \"buy-in.\" Most of his buy-in is placed with other player's money in the prize pool. Usually, a small portion of the buy-in is kept by the tournament officials for their expenses (and profit). The player is given a table and seat assignment, and a certain number of chips - the same amount as every other player. Unlike normal chips, these tournament chips have no cash value (though they often are referred to with dollar amounts). Players must continue to play until they run out of chips. The tournament continues until one player has accumulated all of the chips. The order in which people lose all their chips (or \"bust out\"), is their finishing order. That is, the last player to bust out is the second-place finisher. The prize pool is divided amongst a fraction of the top finishers (usually about 10%). The first-place winner usually gets a much larger share, with the prizes diminishing until the prize pool is empty. The player who was the last player to finish without winning any prize is said to have finished \"on the bubble.\"\nAs players bust out of the tournament, the average player's chip stack gets larger. In order to insure that the blinds do not become insignificant in the face of the growth in chip stacks, tournaments are played in timed \"rounds.\" At the beginning of each round typically the blinds increase. Every few rounds there will be a short break between rounds. For tournaments that last longer than a day, there will be a last level for the day, and the tournament will resume the next day.\nMost tournaments only allow a player to buy-in and receive chips once, at the beginning. These are called \"freeze out\" tournaments. Some tournaments allow players to buy-in more than once for the first few levels of the tournament. These players are said to \"re-buy\" and the money they use to re-buy goes into the prize pool with the rest of the buy-ins."}
{"id": "14220", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14220", "title": "Creationism", "text": "Creationism is the religious belief that the universe was created in the way described in religious books. According to Genesis, God directly created life from the nothingness that was before, by fixing the chaos that was. Other religions have different creation myths. The first approach is known as creatio ex nihilo, which is the Latin name for \"creation from nothing\".\nThe idea that God created the world has been taught for thousands of years by writers such as Augustine of Hippo.\nCreationism as it is known today started in the 19th century by fundamentalist Protestants who were opposed to the theories that scientists began to put forward about geology and evolution.\nIn the 20th century, creationist movements also started in Islam and Judaism.\nBelief.\nCreationists do not believe that all of today's living things came about from simple organisms changing or evolving slowly over time. They believe that life was created much as it is today, and that one form of life cannot change into another. While biologists and paleontologists say that fossils are different from the life we see today, and can be put into order to show changes over time. Young Earth Creationism says life was created in a short time, in its current form. They point to the Flood of Noah to account for most rock formations and most fossils. There is also an Old Earth creationism.\nChristian Creationism.\nYoung Earth Creationism goes completely against conventional geochronology. This kind of creationism says God created the earth roughly 6,000 or 10,000 years ago as told in Genesis. Young Earth Creationists believe that God created the world in six days (with God resting on the seventh) as the Book of Genesis says. Young Earth Creationism says that Noah's flood is important to creationism. They argue that \"the first buried fossils of each group are complete and complex (complicated), strong support for the biblical concept (idea) that each kind of life was created well designed to multiply after its own kind.\" They believe that the Bible is literally true (see Biblical inerrancy). Some people say a problem with this is that fossils appear in layers called strata. \nIf fossils were of animals drowned in the flood scientists think they would be mixed together. Christian creationists say this happened because of the Noahic Flood, and point to fossils of animals that died quickly. They offer many defenses. Some of these are:1. Fossils that were buried quickly, as in Lagerst\u00e4tten. One fossil Creationists talk about is where one fish is eating another fish when it was buried.2. Polystrate fossils are fossils that go through multiple rock layers. Christian scientists say this can't happen if the rock layers were formed quickly3. Bent rock layers are rock layers that are bent in a way that Christian scientists say can not happen over millions of years. Christians say there are a lot of these.Other creationists believe God created everything between 13,000 and 14,000 million years ago. This is called Old Earth Creationism.\nCreationists point to the perfection of Earth's size, shape, and distance as designed by God, and Earth's \"im\"perfections as proofs that the Earth is dirtied by humans' sin.\nThe term creationism can be used with more than one meaning. \nLiberal Christians do not believe in Biblical inerrancy and say God used evolution to create mankind and other life. This idea is called theistic evolution.\nIslamic Creationism.\nIslamic creationism is the belief that the universe (including humanity) was directly created by Allah as in the Qur'an. Currently, Islam takes religious texts literally. Many scholars say that Genesis is a corrupted version of God's message. \nThere is also a creation myth in the Qu'ran, but it is more vague than Genesis. This allows for more interpretation. Several liberal movements within Islam generally accept the scientific positions on the age of the earth, the age of the universe and evolution.\nIslam also has its own form of Theistic evolution, which says that mainstream scientific analysis of the origin of the universe is supported by the Qur'an. Many liberal Muslims believe in evolutionary creationism.\nKhalid Anees, president of the Islamic Society of Britain attended a conference called 'Creationism: Science and Faith in Schools'. During that conference, he made points including the following: There is no contradiction between what is revealed in the Koran and natural selection and survival of the fittest. However, some Muslims, such as Adnan Oktar, do not agree that one species can develop from another. Other Muslims do believe that one species can develop from another.\nBut there is also a growing movement of Islamic creationism. Like the movement in Christianity, Islamic creationists are concerned that the findings of evolutionary theory might contradict what is written in the Qu'ran.\nThere are several verses in the Qur'an which some modern writers have interpreted as being compatible with the expansion of the universe, Big Bang and Big Crunch theories:\n\"Do not the Unbelievers see that the skies (space) and the earth were joined together, then We clove them asunder and We created every living thing out of the water. Will they not then believe?\"\n\"Then turned He to the sky (space) when it was smoke, and said unto it and unto the earth: Come both of you, willingly or loth. They said: We come, obedient.\"\n\"And it is We Who have constructed the sky (space) with might, and it is We Who are steadily expanding it.\"\n\"On the day when We will roll up the sky (space) like the rolling up of the scroll for writings, as We originated the first creation, (so) We shall reproduce it; a promise (binding on Us); surely We will bring it about.\"\nBaha'i creationism.\nThe Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith considers the creation narratives in previous Abrahamic religions to be symbolic and not literal. Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith also accepts that the Earth is ancient. Baha'ullah existed at the same time as Charles Darwin, so was aware of Darwin's works.\nScientific criticism.\nReligious communities in the United States encourage the inclusion of supernatural explanations of the origins\nof both life and the universe as a whole.\nEvolution was not included in school textbooks until the 1960s.\nIn 1987, the United States Supreme Court acknowledged creationism is not scientific, and\nshould not be taught in public schools."}
{"id": "14223", "revid": "16695", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14223", "title": "Flute", "text": "The Flute is a musical instrument. A person who plays the flute is called a \"flutist\".\nThere are many kinds of flutes. The most common concert flute is on C tuning. In addition, there are other flutes like piccolos, alto flutes, and bass flutes.\nHistory.\nFlutes have changed over time. Pan flutes were made for many centuries. Later, the \"Renaissance flute\" came into use. In Baroque music \"flute\" means recorder, so flutes were called \"traverso\" in order not to confuse them. A Bavarian flute maker named Boehm reformed flutes largely to enlarge the volume and improve the way of using the chromatic scale. Later improvements created the modern flute.\nThere is a large repertoire of music for the flute. Baroque composers used them in their orchestras, usually in pairs, and composed concertos, chamber music and solo music for them. This has continued to the present day. Orchestras have at least 2 flutes each, sometimes three or four. Sometimes there is 1 piccolo which plays an octave higher, or an alto flute which plays a fifth lower than the flute.\nThe flute sounds very bright and cheerful playing high notes. Please listen, for example, to the \"Badinerie\" from Bach's \"Orchestral Suite no 2\". It can also sound very thoughtful or sad when playing in its lowest register. A good example is the opening of Debussy's \"Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l'apr\u00e8s midi d'un faune also flutes Andre a brass instrument and can make a really low pitch. \nPlaying.\nThe flute is a woodwind instrument, but modern flutes are made of metal. It was made of wood a long time ago. It doesn't need lip vibration like brass instruments. Flute players hold it horizontally and make a sound by blowing their breath over the edge of the hole of flute's head. This makes the air vibrate. Flutes need the second most amount of air for an instrument, next to the tuba. Flautists can change the pitch by pushing buttons or changing the direction of the breath. These buttons are called keys. The breath also can change the tone or the volume. Flute has many variations of the sound. The sound of flute is high, so composers often express it as a bird. A flute matches with many instruments such as violin and piano, and is often part of an ensemble.\nMaterial.\nThere are many kinds of flute, so the material also varies. Most flutes are made out of silver. Gold, platinum, wood, and aluminum are also used. The price of flute depends on the material, but there are many different playing situations, so not only expensive flutes are useful.\nDifferent Flutes.\nFlutes of India and China.\nThe oldest kind of side-blown flute was made in India.\nIn India, a flute called bansuri is used. It has no keys and is often made of bamboo or cane.\nIn China, a simple flute is used, which has no keys. The Chinese flute sometimes has a thin piece of paper over one hole, which adds a bright raspiness to the sound.\nOther flutes.\nThere are other kinds of flute, that are played by blowing into the end, like a recorder. Some of these are tin whistle, flageolet, tabor pipe, and ocarina.\nIn Japan there is a kind of flute called a \"shakuhachi\", which is made from the bottom of a bamboo plant. It is blown at the end, but is not like the recorder because it does not have an opening that guides the air across a hole that makes the sound.\nIn South America, there is a flute called a \"quena\" that makes its sound the same way as the \"shakuhachi\".\nThe Pan pipes are a form of flute with no holes. It has more than one pipe connected together, with the bottom closed. The player blows across the top of one of the pipes to make a note. The pipes are in different sizes, so that each one makes a different note. They are named after Pan, who played this instrument in Greek myth.\nGallery.\nThere are flutes in many cultures. The flute has been described as \"a musical weed which springs up everywhere\".\nFamous Flutists.\nThe band Jethro Tull was founded by a flute player (Ian Anderson). It can be heard in many songs. One of them is the hit \"Locomotive Breath\"."}

Because the ocarina is in a round or box-like shape, its sound is a little different from other flutes.\nHistory.\nThe ten-hole ocarina was first made by Giuseppe Donati, in Italy, in 1853. Instruments like the ocarina had been made for hundreds of years before that in South America, China, and Africa. In Europe, a form called the gemshorn was made in the 16th century. The gemshorn was made from an animal horn.\nIn the 19th century, groups of ocarina players, with different sized ocarinas, played classical and folk music. Italian ocarinas became known throughout the world, because of this.\nIn the United States the ocarina was called the sweet potato, because its shape is like a sweet potato.\nIn 1928, the Japanese began making ocarinas. They added two small holes to the old kind of ocarinas. Japanese 12-hole ocarinas can play a larger scale than 10-hole ocarinas.\nEnglish Ocarina.\nIn the 1960s, the English ocarina was invented.

The clarinet has one reed. The reed is made of cane, bamboo or plastic, which varies in thickness. The reed is attached to the mouthpiece with a clamp called a \"ligature\", which is usually made out of metal. Blowing through the mouthpiece makes the reed vibrate, and therefore makes the noise. The body of the clarinet is a cylindrical tube with holes. The holes are covered by the fingers to make musical notes. There are also buttons pressed by the fingers which allow pads over holes to open or close so all notes of the chromatic scale can be played. The buttons are usually played with the \"pinkie\" finger. \nOne kind of keyed clarinet is called the Albert . Another kind is called the system. The Boehm clarinet is much used by classical orchestras and by jazz musicians. In North America and other Western countries, the most popular clarinet is the clarinet pitched in B flat. This means that if a clarinet player plays a note that is written as a C, it sounds like a B flat on a piano. The B flat clarinet is used in concert, marching, and school bands. Musicians in orchestras also play the A-clarinet (a semitone lower), the sopranino E flat clarinet (a fourth higher) and the Bass_clarinet in B flat (sounding an octave lower). \nA beginner clarinet player usually can play a note within the first minutes of a lesson. Making a sound with the clarinet is easier than making a sound with many other wind instruments. Most instrumental music teachers consider it to be a good instrument for young players as soon as the lower adult teeth have grown. The fingering system is very similar to the flute and the saxophone, so changing from playing the clarinet to one of these instruments is not too difficult after the student is comfortable playing the clarinet and has reached a certain level.\nA famous piece that features a clarinet is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Clarinet Concerto, which has the clarinet playing the melody with the rest of the orchestra playing along. Written in 1791, it is often considered the first great composition for the instrument. "}

It has a flat front, with a neck attached to it. Early lutes had four strings or eight sets of two strings. Beneath these strings, there were strings tied to the neck, where the player pressed down to make the notes. These strings were called frets.\nThe front part of the body is made of a flat piece of wood, and known as the sound board.

It was originally the dialect that developed among the Afrikaner Protestant settlers, the unfree workers, and slaves brought to the Cape area in southwestern South Africa by the Dutch East India Company ( - VOC) between 1652 and 1705. Most of these first settlers were from the United Provinces (now Netherlands), though there were also many from Germany, some from France, a few from Scotland, and various other countries. The unfree workers and slaves were Malays, and Malagasy in addition to the native Khoi and Bushmen.\nResearch by J. A. Heese says that until 1807, 36.8% of the ancestors of the White Afrikaans speaking population were Dutch, 35% were German, 14.6% were French and 7.2% non-white (of African and/or Asian origins). \nHeese's figures are questioned by other researchers, however, and especially the non-white component quoted by Heese is very much in doubt.\nA sizeable minority of those who speak Afrikaans as a first language are not white. The dialect became known as \"Cape Dutch\". Later, Afrikaans was sometimes called \"African Dutch\" or \"Kitchen Dutch\". Afrikaans was considered a Dutch dialect until the early 20th century, when it began to be widely known as a different language. The name \"Afrikaans\" is simply the Dutch word for \"African\", and the language is the African form of Dutch."}

It is the publishing unit of DC Entertainment, a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc., which itself is owned by Time Warner. Its first well-known comics were such as \"Action Comics\", \"Detective Comics\" and \"All Star Comics\". They were essential in introducing three well known superheroes: Superman (1938), Batman (1939), and Wonder Woman (1941). Its top rival is Marvel Comics. DC Comics is one of the largest and oldest American comic book companies, which is best well known for making \"superhero\" comic books. DC Comics is very famous in the modern art subject Graphics.\nThe company is well known for iconic heroic characters including Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Flash, Aquaman, Cyborg, Martian Manhunter, Green Arrow, Supergirl, Batwoman, Batgirl, Robin, Nightwing, Black Canary, Hawkman, Hawkgirl, Plastic Man, Huntress, Static, Zatanna, and Shazam!.\nMost of their characters take place in the fictional DC Universe (DCU) and features famous and recognizable teams such as the Justice League, the Justice Society of America, the Green Lantern Corps., the Young Justice, the Suicide Squad, and the Teen Titans.\nIt also features a wide variety of well-known fictional villains including the Joker, Lex Luthor, Darkseid, Harley Quinn, General Zod, Catwoman, Brainiac, Scarecrow, Doomsday, Bane, Mr. Freeze, Penguin, Riddler, Two-Face, Ra's al Ghul, Poison Ivy, Ares, Deathstroke, Black Mask, Cheetah, Sinestro, Black Manta, Reverse-Flash, Captain Cold, Heat Wave, Killer Frost, and Black Adam.\nHistory.\nWhat is known today as DC Comics was founded in 1934 by publishing entrepreneur Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson under the name of \"National Allied Publications\". DC was formed by the merging of \"National Allied Publications\" and \"Detective Comics Inc\", as well as the affiliated \"All-American Publications\". Despite being officially known as \"National Comics\", the comic covers carried a \"DC\" logo and were referred to as a result of its nickname: \"DC Comics\". People had nicknamed it \"DC\" because of one its most popular comic series; \"Detective Comics\" and thus was born one of the world's most recognizable comic book brandings along with rivals Marvel publishing.\nThe company did not officially change its name to DC Comics however, until 1977 during the presidency of Jenette Kahn.\nDC Comics has its current official headquarters at 1700 Broadway, 7th, New York, New York. Random House distributes DC Comics' books to the bookstore market, while Diamond Comics Distributors supplies the comics shop specialty market.\nGolden Age.\nNational Allied Publications' first comic was \"\" which was released in the February of 1935. It hit off, and was surprisingly popular. Later that year, a second title was released: \"New Comics #1.\" The size and length \"New Comics #1\" became the archetype for many comics afterwards, and it became the longest running comic series of all time.\nIn 1938, National launched \"Action Comics\", which featured the brand new character from regular contributors Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, Superman. Originally dismissed as \"silly\" by editorial, reports soon came back noting the popularity and sales increase resulting from the Superman feature. Superman quickly became a sensation and before long, dozens of imitations from both National and other publishing houses appeared almost overnight. Writer Bill Finger and his artist employer Bob Kane soon submitted Batman to appear in \"Detective Comics\" and before long, and his artist H.G. Peter and William Moulton Marston feature best submitted Wonder Woman to appear in \"All Star Comics\". The featuring superheroes Superman and Batman, and an entire Justice Society of America had been formed including properties such as The Flash, Green Lantern, The Sandman, Wonder Woman, Hawkman and The Spectre, to name a few, many of whom were either created or written by the prolific Gardner Fox.\nWith the establishment of DC as one of the major comic book companies and with many of the most marketable names in the early years of comics, it is sometimes considered the main company that other companies had to compete with. Companies tried different approaches, One that succeeded and often outsold DC for instance was Fawcett Publications who had a character who some consider similar to Superman who was an all-powerful hero with a supporting \"family\" known as Captain Marvel and the Marvel Family, whereas other companies such as Charlton Comics created entire new worlds preventing DC from attacking them with lawsuits. Further along in the Silver Age many of these companies failed or like Fawcett were sued out of existence. Thus although they had once been competitors, many of the soon public domain properties of Fawcett and Charlton were eventually revived and trademarked and seemingly taken under DC's control.\nSilver and Bronze Age.\nDuring the post-War years, the popularity of superheroes had declined almost completely, though DC and other publishers were still going strong moving into other genres such as funny animals, romance, Sci-Fi, Westerns and horror. Major characters such as Batman, Wonder Woman and Superman has managed to remain in publication and by the mid-1950s the superhero was again due for a comeback. \"Showcase #4\" in 1956 introduced readers to Barry Allen, the all-new Flash re-imagined with a sleeker design and steeped much heavier in science fiction (and the older Golden Age heroes being relegated to existing on Earth Two). Characters such as The Atom, Green Lantern and the JSA, now reinvented as the Justice League of America soon followed and a new superhero boom was kicked off.\nDuring this time, The Comics Code Authority has also come into play, which drastically subdued the content available in the comic book medium. Many of the stories during the period moved away from more controversial horror or violent themes.\nWith the reinvigoration of Marvel in the 1960s under the leadership of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, DC found itself a new and more potent competitor. Marvel succeeded by breaking what had become by then generic archetypes of superheroes by introducing characters which were younger and more flawed (and thus appeared more human and appealed to a younger crowd in a more direct manner.) After falling behind Marvel in sales, DC was finally forced to adopt much of the same system which Marvel had, by introducing such young teams as the Teen Titans to compete with the X-Men.\nModern Age and \"Crisis On Infinite Earths\".\nIn 1985, DC Comics decided its 50 years of continuity and numerous alternative Earths had become too messy and was in need of new blank slate. DC penned one of the first major comic book crossovers that incorporated almost every DC title and character ever published by the company. The series ended with multiple Earths being erased and merging into to one unified Earth. Following this, Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman were given new leases of life thanks to big name creators such as John Byrne, Frank Miller and George Perez that redefined the elderly heroes for a new generation.\nDuring this same period, the comic audience has begun to grow up and the direct market for comic stores had opened allowing a wider variety of publications to be experimented with. One such experiment involved bringing in British writer Alan Moore to pen the low selling \"Saga of the Swamp Thing\" series. What resulted was style of comic book not experienced before by mainstream readers in its literary and story driven complexity and execution. Before long, other writers from across the pond such as Neil Gaiman, Peter Milligan and Grant Morrison were recruited to revamp obscure properties and tell new and interesting stories with an older audience in mind. 1986 saw the release of two seminal works from DC Comics, Frank Miller's \"The Dark Knight Returns\" and Alan Moore's \"Watchmen\" that reached unprecedented levels of critical acclaim and outside media attention. By the 90's DC and the entire comic book industry experienced a boom in mature comics aimed at older audiences and simultaneously witnessed a collector's boom that increased sales but almost caused the industry to collapse soon after.\nIn 1993, senior editor Karen Berger convinced DC to make her own imprint for mature readers named Vertigo, similar to DC imprints Piranha Press and Paradox Press as well as Marvel's Epic Comics. Using popular titles such as \"Animal Man\", \"Swamp Thing\", \"Hellblazer\", \"The Sandman\" and \"Shade, The Changing Man\" as its blueprint along side new creator owned material, DC/Vertigo became a hub for intelligent and acclaimed comic books. While rival Marvel Comics continued to dominate the publishing arena with their exceedingly popular properties, DC/Vertigo became the destination for literary and inventive titles during the period.\nIn 1999, DC purchased Jim Lee's WildStorm Productions, formerly one of the founding studios of Image. The line of WildStorm comics and properties came under DC's control though the line continued to be published on the West Coast away from DC editorial until 2010.\nDC Comics series.\nThe three most original highest-grossing and longest-running series includes \"Superman\", \"Batman\" and \"Wonder Woman\".\nAll Star DC Comics.\nIn 2000 Marvel Comics started an imprint called ultimate marvel in which the characters' origin is changed and modernized. This eventually led DC to starting an imprint of their own in 2005, thus All Star was born.\nBoth All-Star series are in their own continuity, except \"All-Star Batman and Robin\" which was part of Earth-31.\n\"All-Star Batman\".\n\"All-Star Batman\" was an ongoing series that premiered on August 2016 as part of the DC Rebirth relaunch, and ran for 14 issues until October 2017. The creative team consisted of writer Scott Snyder and multiple artists, mainly John Romita Jr.. Despite the title, the series told stories that were set in the mainstream DC Universe continuity.\n\"All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder\".\n\"All-Star Batman\" started in 2005 and was written by Frank Miller and Penciled by Jim Lee. This was the first series in the All Star imprint and opened to mainly negative reviews but had high sales. The series was released in a sporadic schedule. The series only reached 10 issues (2008) 2 issues before the intended end of the series.\n\"All-Star Superman\".\n\"All-Star Superman\" started in 2006 and was written by Grant Morrison and Penciled by Frank Quitley. This was the second series under the All Star imprint, the first being \"All-Star Batman and Robin\". The series opened to mainly good reviews and went on to win the Eisner Award for best new series in 2006 and best ongoing series in 2007 and 2009. Like \"All-Star Batman\" the series was also released in a sporadic schedule. The series ended with issue 12. The series overall has widely considered to be one of the best Superman stories of all time.\n\"All Star Wonder Woman\".\n\"All Star Wonder Woman\" started in 2006 and was written by Adam Hughes from San Diego Con 2006.\nThe New 52.\nIn 2011, after a period of declining comic sales, DC announced they were cancelling all the main titles and starting over with all New 52's as part of a relaunch. In charge of the relaunch is Geoff Johns and Jim Lee. The relaunch started with the release of \"Justice League\" #1 on August 31st. this was done partially to revitalize the company and to de-age the characters and thus make them more dynamic. On January 12, 2012, it was announced that there would be a second wave of the new 52 where six titles would be getting canceled with another six to replace them, though the plan to stay at 52 ongoing monthlies seems to be consistent. DC also released a Third wave in September 2012, one year after the relaunch in September 2011. One book in the Third Wave, \"Talon\", starring Calvin Rose was the first solo book for a character who was introduced in the New 52. The Fourth wave started in January 2013 and ended in March 2013, meaning that it was the first wave not to come out in a single month. The Fifth Wave consisted of titles such as \"the Movement\", \"the Green Team\" and \"Superman Unchained\".\nThe New 52 had proved to be so successful with critics, fans and commercially that Marvel the main competitor of DC decided to do a relaunch of their own called \"Marvel NOW!\" in late 2012.\nRelocating from Manhattan to Burbank.\nIn 2015, DC Entertainment moved their entire operations from their Manhattan headquarters in New York City to their new home in Burbank, California. DC's digital and administrative departments had already been relocated to Burbank beginning in 2010. The new office is only a few blocks from their corporate parent company, Warner Bros. Studios.\nOther media.\nOver the years, DC Comics' parent company Warner Bros. (with a few exceptions) has produced a variety of feature films based on DC Comics properties for cinematic release, including TV shows, action figures, and video games which have made them even more popular."}

She is one of the first female superheroes in American comic books and the most famous, most recognizable female superhero in the world. William Moulton Marston, a psychologist who believed that women could be as strong and powerful as men, created Wonder Woman, partly inspired by his wife, Elizabeth Holloway-Marston. Wonder Woman first appeared in the pages of All-Star Comics # 8, published in December 1941. Her first solo comic book debuted in the summer of 1942, when Wonder Woman # 1 was published.\nStory.\nIn the comic book, Wonder Woman's real name is Diana, and she is the daughter of Queen Hippolyta, ruler of the Amazons, a race of peace-loving women who lived in an island named Themyscira (also referred to as Paradise Island). Soon after Steve Trevor, a US Air Force pilot, crash-lands on Paradise Island during World War II, Diana and the amazons tend to his wounds and help him recover. Diana decides that she will bring him back to the United States; once there she becomes the superhero that the world calls \"Wonder Woman\". Her best-known powers are superhuman strength, speed, and reflexes, as well as flight. She has a magic lasso that compels those bound by it to tell the truth, and unbreakable gauntlets that can deflect bullets.\nVillains.\nAmong her villains, the best known are:\nIn Other media.\nWonder Woman had also appeared in animated cartoons and in a live-action television program in the 1970s with actress Lynda Carter. The series made the character very famous.\nIn January 2001, producer Joel Silver asked Todd Alcott to write a \"Wonder Woman\" screenplay. Early rumours listed actresses such as Mariah Carey, Sandra Bullock, and Catherine Zeta-Jones to play the role of Wonder Woman. Leonard Goldberg, speaking in a May 2001 interview, named Sandra Bullock as a strong candidate for the project. Bullock said that she was asked to play the role. Lucy Lawless and Chyna both were interested in it. The screenplay then went through many versions written by many different writers. By August 2003, Levens was replaced by screenwriter Laeta Kalogridis.\nIn March 2005, Warner Bros. said that Joss Whedon would write and direct the movie version of \"Wonder Woman.\" Because Whedon was directing \"Serenity\" at the time and needed time to learn Wonder Woman's background, he did not start writing until late 2005. Silver wanted to movie \"Wonder Woman\" in Australia once the script was finished. In May 2005, Whedon said that he would not cast Wonder Woman until he finished the script. Charisma Carpenter and Morena Baccarin said they were interested in the role.\nIn February 2007, Whedon left the project. He said there were problems with differences about the script between the studio and himself. Whedon said that since he was not doing the \"Wonder Woman\" project, he would focus on making his movie \"Goners\".\nGal Gadot played Wonder Woman in the upcoming 2016 action movie \"\". She was also the lead role of the 2017 superhero film \"Wonder Woman\". She will play the role again in \"Wonder Woman 1984\" (2020) and \"Zack Snyder's Justice League\" (2021).\nHonors.\nOn October 21, 2016, the United Nations controversially named Wonder Woman a UN Honorary Ambassador for the Empowerment of Women and Girls. The character was dropped from the role two months later after a petition against the appointment stated Wonder Woman was an overly sexualized image\"."}

They were first called The Iveys, but renamed themselves after a song title, \"Badfinger Boogie\", the original title of \"With a Little Help From My Friends\". The band's members were Peter Ham, Tom Evans, Mike Gibbins and Joey Molland. Badfinger recorded for Apple Records, which was a record label started by The Beatles, Warner Brothers, Elektra Records, and Radio Records.\nTheir first hit record was \"Come And Get It\", which was written by Paul McCartney. It appeared in a movie, \"The Magic Christian\". The band followed McCartney's demo closely to make the record. The finished record sounded like a Beatles song. Later they made records that sounded different, and showed the band's own style. Todd Rundgren was the producer of some of their recordings.\nBadfinger's other hit records included \"No Matter What\", \"Day After Day\", and \"Baby Blue\". Later they left Apple Records and recorded for Warner Bros. Ham and Evans were the band's main songwriters. One of their songs, \"Without You\", was recorded by the band, but was not a hit. A later cover version by singer Harry Nilsson became an international hit, and was the first of many such versions. Many recording artists have sung \"Without You\", including Mariah Carey.\nIn 1970 Badfinger made an agreement with an American businessman called Stan Polley who promised to help them earn more money. But instead of helping them, Polley kept their money \"away\" from them in an account and refused to tell them how to get it out. He also behaved dishonestly toward Warner Bros. Because of his dishonesty, the band's sixth album was removed from shops after being available for only seven weeks, and Warner Bros. refused to release their seventh album. As a result, the band did not earn any money for their hard work, which made Pete Ham feel very depressed. Feeling that he could not be a good husband or father without any money, Ham committed suicide by hanging himself in 1975.\nEvans and Molland decided they still wanted to work together. Mike Gibbins, the drummer, wanted to as well, but could not. They found two more musicians to take the place of Ham and Gibbins, and recorded a new album called \"Airwaves\". They had only one very small hit, but continued to tour. They released another record called \"Say No More\". This record had cover art by artist Peter Max.\nTom Evans had problems like Ham's, and killed himself (eight years after Ham) in the same way."}

This Resolution may call for UN members to take certain actions to punish the country, called \"sanctions\". \nAn example is that the UNSC had long banned all imports of nuclear fuel to Iran as they felt Iran was going to make nuclear weapons. These sanctions resulted in rules which made it much harder for Iran to do business with people in the rest of the world. These actions made life harder in Iran, both for its government and regular people as well. Most people think that is why Iran was willing to promise to change how it used nuclear material in order to end these rules.

In 1524, Lenape people in canoes met Giovanni da Verrazzano, the first European explorer to pass New York Harbor, although he may not have entered the harbor past the Narrows. Henry Hudson, an Englishman who worked for the Dutch East India Company, made the first map of the area.\nColonial times.\nIn the 1620s, the first large European colony was started in New Netherland, when the Dutch began trading fur on Governors Island. In 1625, the Dutch chose Manhattan Island to build Fort Amsterdam, a citadel for the protection of the new arrivals. It would later be called New Amsterdam (Dutch: \"Nieuw Amsterdam\"). The creation of New Amsterdam was recognized as the birth of New York City.\nOn May 24, 1626, Manhattan was bought from the Native Americans living on the island. The price was trading goods worth 60 guilders, which was worth about 24 dollars at the time. The currency calculations from the International Institute of Social History in Amsterdam say that 60 guilders in the 1620s cost around $1000 now.\nIn 1647, Peter Stuyvesant became the last Dutch Director General of the colony. New Amsterdam was considered an official city on 3 February 1653. In 1664, the British conquered New Netherland and renamed it \"New York\" after the English King James II, then known as Duke of York and Albany. Stuyvesant and his council made a deal with the British where New Netherlanders were promised liberties, including freedom of religion, under British rule. In August 1673, the Dutch took control of the island again, calling the city \"New Orange\" (Dutch: \"Nieuwe Oranje\"). The Dutch lost control of New Netherland forever to the English in November 1674 by treaty.\nAmerican Revolution.\nManhattan was the center of many campaigns, battles and meetings during the American Revolution. In 1765, all of the colonies worked together for a unified political aim when the Stamp Act Congress (meeting) of representatives from across the Thirteen Colonies was held in New York City to write The Declaration of Rights and Grievances.\nThe Sons of Liberty, a Boston based group, were part of a long-term battle with British authorities over liberty poles that were sometimes raised by the Sons of Liberty and cut down by the British. The disputes ended when the revolutionary New York Provincial Congress took power in 1775.\nManhattan was the center of a series of large battles in the early American Revolutionary War. These battles were called the New York Campaign, where British forces and colonists fought for control of New York City and the state of New Jersey. The rebel Continental Army, led by George Washington, had to leave Manhattan after losing the Battle of Fort Washington on 16 November 1776. Shortly after, Manhattan was greatly damaged by the Great Fire of New York in 1776.\nVictory gave the British control of the area. They used the city as the center for political and military activities for the rest of the war. Loyalists from elsewhere came to the city as refugees from the Rebels and to join the war.\nYears later, Washington came back to Manhattan with his army. On Evacuation Day, the last British occupation forces left the city on 25 November 1783. On 30 April, 1789, Washington was inaugurated (officially became) the first president of the United States and took his oath of office at Federal Hall on Wall Street.\nImmigration influx and Gilded Age.\nIn the early 19th century, Manhattan grew in population and economically. Another great fire in 1835 destroyed much of the city but it was soon rebuilt. Because of the Great Irish Famine, a lot of Irish people emigrated (left their country) to live in New York; they made up for 25% of Manhattan's population at the time. Many of the Irish people lived in a part of the Lower East Side known as the Bowery or in another section called Five Points.\nAfter the Civil War, many immigrants of Italian, Polish and Jewish backgrounds came to Manhattan and lived in tenements in a part of the city called the Lower East Side. Over a million people lived in the area at one point.\nAn Irish political machine called Tammany Hall was very important to New York City during the Gilded Age. With the support of mostly Irish immigrants, it grew as a political machine. The support helped win the election for the first Tammany mayor, Fernando Wood, in 1854. Central Park, which opened to the public in 1858, became the first landscaped park in any American city and the country's first public park.\nThe rate of immigration from Europe shot up after the Civil War, and New York became the most popular state for immigrants in the United States. Because of this, the French built and gave New York the Statue of Liberty on October 28, 1886. Soon after, the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn were combined into one city.\nEconomic downfall and rise.\nIn the beginning of the 20th century, many new things were built in the city, like skyscrapers and the New York City Subway. The first subway transit center, the Interborough Rapid Transit or \"IRT\", opened to the public in 1904. The installation of the Subway helped tie the new city together, as did new bridges to Brooklyn. In the 1920s, many African-Americans came to live in Manhattan during the Great Migration from the American South, and the Harlem Renaissance. New York City became the most populous city (city with the most people) in the world in 1925, overtaking London, which had held the title for a century.\nBetween World War I and World War II, reformist Fiorello La Guardia was elected as the new mayor in 1933 and took office in 1934, marking the fall of Tammany Hall after 80 years of dominating politics in New York City. Once the city's demographics were steadier, labor unionization provided protection and affluence to the working class. Despite the Great Depression, some of the world's tallest skyscrapers of the time were built in Manhattan during the 1930s, including many Art Deco masterpieces that are still part of the city's skyline today. The most well-known structures are Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, and the GE Building.\nFollowing the end of World War II, a lot of veterans came home to the United States. This led to the development of private communities that were intended to be sold or rented out to returning soldiers, resulting in an economic boom. An example of one of the communities built to attract veterans looking for homes is Stuyvesant Town\u2014Peter Cooper Village, which opened in 1947. In 1951, the United Nations relocated from its first headquarters in Queens, to the East Side of Manhattan.\nPopulation and industry began to decline in the 1960s. The Stonewall riots were a series of violent demonstrations by members of the gay community. By the 1970s, the city had gained a reputation as a graffiti-covered, crime-ridden relic of history. In 1975, the city government went bankrupt (ran out of money), and its pleas for financial help were rejected at first. On 30 October 1975, the New York Daily News reported the event with the headline as \"Ford to City: Drop Dead\". The city received a federal loan and debt restructuring. After the economic downfall and recovery, New York State kept a close watch on New York City's economy.\nIn the 1980s, Wall Street was revived from its slump, and the city reclaimed its role at the center of the worldwide financial industry. During this time, Manhattan was also at the heart of the AIDS crisis, with Greenwich Village being a major center of the epidemic. \"Gay Men's Health Crisis\" (GMHC) and \"AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power\" (ACT UP) were organizations that were started because of the crisis. Their purpose was to advocate on behalf of those AIDs victims.\nCrime rates began to drop greatly in the 1990s. Murder rates were 537 in 2008 compared to 2,245 in 1990. The crack epidemic and its associated drug-related violence had died down, and was under great control by the city. Many people who had moved out of the city came back because the city once again became the destination of immigrants from around the world, joining with low interest rates and Wall Street bonuses to fuel the growth of the real estate market."}

Dominici left the band only three years later, in 1990, and James LaBrie joined and stayed until today. Dream Theater's keyboardist also changed three times. Kevin Moore played with the band from 1986 until 1995 when he left and Derek Sherinan took his position until 1999. Jordan Rudess is Dream Theater's Keyboardist now. He is known for his excellent technique and compositional skills. In September 2010, drummer Mike Portnoy left Dream Theater, and was replaced by Mike Mangini.\nInfluences.\nThe members of Dream Theater are known for having excellent playing technique of their instruments, and for their songwriting. Their music is very complex and the songs are often long, their longest being \"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\" at 42 minutes in length.\nTheir songs contain a lot of instrumental sections, in which no vocals are heard and only the instruments play (these parts are called \"instrumental passages\") and also many solos. Another feature of their music is that during each song, the speed often changes, and occasionally style changes too.\nThey once said that other bands have trouble making long songs. They said they have trouble making \"short\" songs. Most of Dream Theater's music is very difficult to play because of the high speed it has to be played with and the complex rhythm."}

Feminism is about changing the way that people see male and female rights (mainly female), and campaigning for equal ones. Somebody who follows feminism is called a feminist.\nFeminism began in the 18th century with the Enlightenment. The controversy over the differences between the genders led to the discussion of equality.\nHistory of feminism.\nThe word \"feminism\" comes from the French word \"f\u00e9minisme\". This medical term was used to describe masculine women or men with feminized traits. When its use became popular in the United States of America, it was used to refer to groups of women who \"asserted the uniqueness of women, the mystical experience of motherhood and women's special purity \".\nGeneral history.\nFeminism started with the idea that human rights should be given to women. This idea was put forward by some philosophers in the 18th and 19th centuries such as Mary Wollstonecraft and John Stuart Mill. Later feminists in the early 20th century also said that women should be allowed to vote in a democracy. Many women felt very strongly that they should be allowed to vote and there were many protests. These women were called Suffragettes. This is because they were fighting for Universal suffrage which means everybody is able to vote. The Suffragettes staged many protests for their rights. Some women even committed suicide to show how wrong it was that they could not take part in politics. After women received the vote, feminism worked to make all of society more equal for women.\nNot all female politicians have been welcomed by feminists, with Margaret Thatcher, Sarah Palin and Michele Bachmann being clear examples.\nFeminism is generally acknowledged to have \"waves\" as different time periods focused on different aspects of feminism, often working off the ideas presented by the wave before.\nFirst wave (approx. 1830s \u2013 early 1900s).\nIn technical terms, the first wave of feminism could be dated earlier to include pre-nineteenth century women's rights movements. In particular, the French Revolution of 1789 is often attributed as the beginning of the first demands for women's rights. This went on to inspire Mary Wollstonecraft, whose book \"A Vindication of the Rights of Women\" was published in 1792. It is widely recognized as one of the earliest significant works of feminist literacy. However, first wave feminism is usually dated as occurring between the mid to late nineteenth century and early 1900s. During the first wave, women began to realize that they must first gain political power before they could bring about social change. This wave focused on gaining the right to vote (universal suffrage). Later, the focus shifted to include sexual, economic, and reproductive concerns.\nDuring the inter-war years, the feminist movement declined. Anti-feminism was on the rise, focusing on the issue of women and work. Women were being 'persuaded' to return to their traditional roles in the home and give up their war jobs. There were also issues within the organized ranks of feminism itself. The ideologies and priorities of certain groups were changing. Some felt that equality with men had been reached and shifted their focus onto the needs of women as women, such as the subjects of birth control, family allowance, and protective legislature. This caused the split into the dominant groups of equality feminism and new feminism. New feminists focused on the role of traditional women in the home and as mothers. Equality feminists encouraged women to look beyond the home and fought for equality with men in every aspect of life. Equality feminists opposed protective legislature, such as maturity leave, purely on principle.\nThe topic of protective legislature eventually led to the divide of first wave feminism. Middle-class feminists tended to oppose protective legislature, whereas working class feminists largely supported it. This split between the previously dominant equality feminism and the rising new feminism marks the end of the first wave of feminism.\nSecond wave (1960s-1980s).\nSecond wave feminism is marked by the rise of political concerns. Where the first wave of feminism dealt with women in the workforce, as well as the right to own property and vote, the second wave of feminism lobbied for 'liberation' from a patriarchal society. The key to second wave feminism was the struggle over the female body itself - how it was represented and the significance attached to the reality of biological differences.\nThe famous \"One is not born, but rather becomes a woman\" declaration made by Simone de Beauvoir led to new thinking on the way gender was perceived as a construction, rather than something inherent.\nSecond wave feminism was also characterized by the problematization of equality. Questions arose about what gaining equality would achieve, due to the societal roles men and women were still expected to fill. This led to the call for extreme change in order to revolutionize the very fabric of a patriarchal society. This was the beginning of the radical, Marxist, and socialist feminist groupings. It also marked a shift in the politics of liberal feminism, focusing more on 'sexual politics', such as the family, abortion, rape, domestic violence, and sexuality.\nThird wave (1990s \u2013 present).\nThird wave feminism is generally described as the feminism of a younger generation who acknowledge both the effect and the limitations of the ideologies presented by second wave feminism. This new generation argues that the conditions which prompted second wave feminism no longer exist and therefore, feminism needs a revamping in order to be applicable to modern day. It is also argues that second wave feminism catered too much to a small group of people, namely white, middle-class, heterosexual women.\nThird wave feminists largely seem to have grown up with feminism as a strong concept in society, thus influencing them from a young age. It is taught in schools and is also prominent in the media.\nThird wave feminists largely focus on issues surrounding individual self-expression. This includes how identity is formed and communicated through things such as appearance, sexuality, and intersectionality. Third wave feminism was also created in order to include a larger grouping of people, recognizing women from different cultural backgrounds, religions, sexualities, ethnicities, and abilities to name a few.\nFourth wave (approx. 2008 \u2013 present).\nSome say that a fourth wave of feminism is already upon us, prompted by the increase in internet culture. This wave is similar to the third wave but is distinguished by more advanced technology and broader ideas of equality. This wave stands more in solidarity with other social justice movements.\nFourth wave feminism uses the internet and its \"call-out\" culture to challenge misogyny and sexism in popular media such as television, literature, advertising, etc. This has caused companies to change how they market to women in order to avoid being \"called out\".\nAnother part of fourth wave feminism is the existence of people who reject the word \"feminism\" because of \"assumptions of gender binary and exclusionary subtext: 'For women only'\".\nIn 21st century online communities/ support groups focused on masculinism discourse as a counterpart to online presence of feminism is known as manosphere. Masculinism fueled by primordialist ideologies have also resulted into an openly anti-feminist toxic culture known as \"incels\" (involuntarily celibate).\nWomen in politics.\nThere have been women who have been involved in politics throughout history.\nHistorical.\nEsther, Lady Godiva, Bodicea, Queen Elizabeth, Lucrezia Borgia, Catherine the Great, Joan of Arc.\nModern times.\nStarting in 1960, there have been many women elected to high positions of power, such as prime minister. Sirimavo Bandaranaike was the first, followed by Indira Gandhi, Golda Meir, Elisabeth Domitien and Margaret Thatcher. Dame Eugenia Charles lasted nearly 15 years in the post, a record.\nTypes of feminism/feminist theories.\nLiberal feminism.\nLiberal feminism drew its strength from the diversity of liberal thought following the Enlightenment. The basis of liberal feminism is the emphasis on the power of the individual. If everyone individually stands up for what is right, discriminatory practises will change. Liberals also value education, arguing that equal education of men and women will lead to equality in society. Liberal feminists would be more likely to accept the argument (to a degree) that certain positions in society (such as the home and the workplace) are better suited to the 'traditional' gender placements.\nSocialist or Marxist feminism.\nSocialist or Marxist feminism are similar in that they both believe revolution is the answer to change. They both link social conditions with capitalism and believe that overthrowing the current system is the only way to get what you want. Like liberal feminists, socialist or Marxist feminists acknowledge that men are necessary as part of the movement for change. Whatever the theory, socialist and Marxist countries have never had women in major government posts. Women have often achieved ministerial positions in democracies. Thus rhetoric (what regimes say) does not always line up with what regimes do in practice.\nRadical feminism.\nRadical feminism, particularly in the USA, developed from the civil rights and new left clusters. Radical feminists were largely fed up with the male-dominated left wing radicalism and formed the Women's Liberation Movement. This movement was formed in order to create woman-centered politics and to escape from male-oriented politics. They believed this could only be done in a safe women-only space, and this led to the policy of separatism for which radical feminism is best known for. Radical feminists are often misunderstood and seen as \"man-hating\" because of the way their women-oriented politics seem to reject male input.\nEvangelical feminism.\nEvangelical feminism or 'Christian feminism' was developed from religious movements. Evangelical feminists work to protect and spiritually reform those who need it, such as women and children from outside the church. These feminists believe that everyone is equal under one God and strive to bring that equality to the church and their individual lives.\nEquality feminism.\nEquality feminism is a subsection of the feminist movement. Equality feminism's focus on the similarities between the sexes is on the basis that men and women's abilities are indistinguishable from their biology. This type of feminism encourages the broadening of horizons, encouraging women to look beyond the home. Its ultimate goal is for the sexes to be completely equal in every part of life.\nNew feminism.\nNew feminism is a philosophy similar to equality feminism. It focuses on how the differences between men and women complement each other, rather than one sex's biology causing a superiority over the other. New feminism, unlike equality feminism, recognizes the different strengths and roles given to men and women. New feminism advocates for equality in how men and women are treated in their individual roles in society. Its basic concept is the emphasis placed on important differences being biological rather than cultural. Women should be supported as child bearers, both economically and culturally, but this should not be a role that is forced upon them. The main aim is to emphasize the importance of women and men as individuals and that in all senses (legal, social, economic), they should be equal despite their natural differences.\nGlobal feminist thought.\nGlobal Feminist Thought is primarily the movement of women's rights on a global scale. Women are impacted in different communities around the world and have common problems they face on a day-to-day basis; usually at home or in the work force. Although different cultural locations have different experiences that will shape their experiences and perceptions, they have common themes. Global feminists tend to focus on nationality (like race, gender and class) and they reach out to help those in developing and third world countries, as well as address oppression created through histories of colonialism and imperialism. It works to end capitalism, imperialism, sexism and racism, along with having everyone considered equal on a global view. It encourages feminists to confront the problems they are facing and reach out for help, as they are not the only ones experiencing that particular problem.\nAnti-feminism.\nWriters such as Camille Paglia, Christina Hoff Sommers, Jean Bethke Elshtain, Elizabeth Fox-Genovese and Daphne Patai oppose some forms of feminism, though they identify as feminists. They argue, for example, that feminism often promotes misandry (hatred of men) and the elevation of women's interests above men's, and criticize radical feminist positions as harmful to both men and women. Daphne Patai and Noretta Koertge argue that the term \"anti-feminist\" is used to silence academic debate about defects of feminism like lack of intersectionality and visible separatism.\nCriticism.\nIdentified reasons why some people do not like feminism:"}

It is one of only two species in the family Hippopotamidae that are still alive. The other is the pygmy hippopotamus.\nThe hippopotamus is the second largest land animal in size, and the third largest land animal in weight. The elephant is the heaviest, and the white rhinoceros is the second heaviest, but a bit smaller than the hippo. The hippo is also the heaviest artiodactyl.\nThe hippopotamus is semi-aquatic. This means that even though it usually lives on the land, it spends a great amount of time in rivers and lakes where males lead groups of 5 to 30 females and young. In the daytime, they keep cool by staying in the water or mud. They give birth to baby hippos in the water, too. At dusk, they come out to graze on grass. Hippopotamuses rest together in the water, but they like to graze by themselves.\nThe hippopotamus has a torso that is shaped like a barrel, a very big mouth and teeth, an almost hairless body, short legs and great size. It is the third largest land mammal, judging by its weight, which is between between 1\u00bd and 3 tonnes. The white rhinoceros weighs 1\u00bd to 3\u00bd tonnes, and the three species of elephant weigh 3 to 9 tonnes. Even though it has short, fat legs, it can run more quickly than a human. Some hippos have run at 30 km/h (19\u00a0mph) for short distances. The hippopotamus is one of the fiercest animals in the world. It is often called one of the most dangerous animals in Africa. There are about 125,000 to 150,000 hippos in Sub-Saharan Africa. Zambia (about 40,000) and Tanzania (20,000\u201330,000) have the most hippos. They are threatened because they are losing their habitats and being poached for their meat and ivory teeth.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"hippopotamus\" comes from the ancient Greek , \"hippopotamos\", from , \"hippos\", \"horse\", and , \"potamos\", which means \"river\". So, \"hippopotamus\" means \"horse of the river\". More than one hippopotamus are called \"hippopotami\", and 'hippopotamuses', or 'hippos' is also used. Hippopotamusi are social. About 30 hippos live together in groups. A male hippopotamus is known as a bull. A female hippopotamus is called a cow, and a baby hippo is called a calf. The species is also known as the common hippopotamus or the Nile hippopotamus.\nDescription.\nHippopotami are the fourth largest mammals in the world (after whales, elephants, and rhinoceroses). The Egyptian hippopotamus is smaller than the others. They can live in the water or on land. They can walk or even run along the bottom of a river.\nBecause hippos are so large, it is difficult to weigh them in the wild. Most adult male hippos weigh between . Females hippos are smaller, and usually weigh between . Older males can get even bigger. They are at least and sometimes even weigh .\nMale hippos seem to keep on growing for their whole lives. Females hippos, though, become heaviest when they are about 25 years old.\nHippos have big and heavy bodies, dark gray skin, and short legs. A hippo's main defence is their extremely strong mouth. They can grow to be 15\u00a0feet long and weigh 3,000\u00a0pounds.\nLife.\nHippopotami are herbivores which live in groups. Despite being semiaquatic and having webbed feet, an adult hippo is not a particularly good swimmer nor can it float. It is rarely found in deep water; when it is, the animal moves by porpoise-like leaps from the bottom. They usually stay in the mud and water during the day and come out to eat grass or leaves at night. Though they are bulky animals, hippopotami can gallop at 30\u00a0km/h (19\u00a0mph) on land but normally trot.\nDistribution.\nMany hippos lived in North Africa and Europe until about 30,000 years ago. They used to be common in Egypt's Nile region from long ago, though they are not there now. Pliny the Elder writes that, in his time, the best place in Egypt for finding this animal was in the Saite nome. The animal could still be found around there after the Arab Conquest in 639. Hippos are still found in the rivers and lakes of Uganda, Sudan, Somalia, Kenya, northern Democratic Republic of the Congo and Ethiopia, west through Ghana to Gambia, and also in Southern Africa (Botswana, Republic of South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zambia). Some hippos also live in Tanzania and Mozambique. They like to live in places with water that is not too deep.\nHippos and humans.\nAggression.\nHippos are very aggressive towards humans, whom they commonly attack whether in boats or on land with no apparent provocation. This aggression by the hippopotamus is caused by humans coming too close to their children. Hippopotami are very protective of their young and they often fear that humans pose a large threat to their young. They are widely considered to be one of the most dangerous large animals in Africa.\nArchaeology.\nThe earliest proof that humans were involved with hippos comes from butchery cut marks on hippo bones at Bouri Formation from around 160,000 years ago. Later rock paintings and engravings showing hippos being hunted. They have been found in the mountains of the central Sahara from 4,000\u20135,000 years ago near Djanet. Ancient Egyptians also knew much about hippos. They knew the hippo was a fierce, wild animal that lived in the Nile. In Egyptian mythology, Tawaret, a goddess of protection in pregnancy and childbirth, had the head of a hippo. This was because ancient Egyptians saw how protective female hippopotami could be about their young."}

It is the second-largest known dwarf planet in the Solar System. Eris is slightly smaller than Pluto, but it is more massive (has more mass) than Pluto. It is a \"scattered disc object\" in the Kuiper belt, further out than Pluto. It is also called a \"plutoid\" because the IAU decided to rename all trans-Neptunian dwarf planets as plutoids. Eris orbits the sun once every 557 Earth years. It has an elliptical orbit, inclined at an angle of 44\u00b0 between the plane of the orbit of the planet and the ecliptic, the plane containing Earth's orbital path. \nEris has one moon, called Dysnomia.\nDiscovery.\nEris was discovered by Michael E. Brown, Chad Trujillo and David Rabinowitz on January 5, 2005, when they were having a close look at some images of the outer Solar System taken in 2003.\nNaming.\nEris was originally called \"Xena\", after the main character of the television series \"\". Due to complications, it was officially named Eris on September 13, 2006. Eris is named after the goddess of strife, discord, contention and rivalry in Greek mythology.\nMoon of Eris.\nEris has one moon called Dysnomia. It was discovered on September 10, 2005. Dysnomia was originally nicknamed \"Gabrielle\", after a character from the television series \"Xena: Warrior Princess\", like Eris. However, like Eris, it was renamed to Dysnomia due to complications. Dysnomia was named after the daughter of Eris, in Greek mythology. Dysnomia is the goddess (or spirit) of lawlessness and poor civil constitution.\nClassification.\nMedia reports have argued that Eris is the tenth planet, along with astronomers and NASA scientists. However, the definition of a planet was changed in August 2006. Under the new specifications, Eris, along with Pluto, was lowered in status to a dwarf planet.\nFuture.\nScientists are continuing to find out more about Eris and its moon, and to look for any more moons and possible rings. Because Eris is so far away, it would take 24.5 years to visit Eris with a space probe."}
{"id": "14377", "revid": "1072983", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14377", "title": "Operation Overlord", "text": "Operation Overlord was the 1944 campaign for the invasion of continental Europe in World War II. It was fought by the Allied forces against German forces. The most critical part was the Normandy landings, which were to get the Allied armies onto the continent of Europe. This might have failed. Heavy casualties were expected, even if it succeeded. It was successful. The Battle of Normandy raged until German forces retreated across the Seine on 30 August 1944. This marked the close of Operation Overlord.\nThe main Allied forces came from the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. Nine other nations also sent units, the rest being Australia, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Greece, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway and Poland.\nPreparations were large and complex. Operation Overlord was the largest and deadliest amphibious assault in the history of warfare. Almost three million troops crossing the English Channel from England to Normandy in then German-occupied France.\nPlans for D-Day.\nAllied troops made many practice landings to understand how to do it.\nMaps of Normandy beaches were created. The planners knew heavy tanks and transport could not travel on the beaches, which had soft peat underneath them. Detailed maps of the area were required. Where peat had to be travelled on, the plan was to lay down matting.\nOn 7 April and 15 May, Bernard Montgomery presented his plan for the invasion. He planned a ninety-day battle, ending when all the forces reached the Seine.\nThe goal for the first 40 days was to capture Caen and Cherbourg (especially Cherbourg, for its deep-water port). Then Brittany and its Atlantic ports would be captured. Railways and roads in northern France would be bombed to block reinforcements for the defenders. Next, the Allies would go 125 miles (190\u00a0km) to the southwest of Paris. The Allies would then control the land between the rivers Loire in the south and Seine in the northeast.\nMeanwhile, the Allies made great efforts to make the Germans think the invasion would happen elsewhere.\nTechnology.\nThe Allies developed new technology for Overlord. The \"mulberry\", a mobile concrete harbor, allowed the Allies to supply their soldiers on the beach without capturing one of the heavily defended Channel ports. Major-General Percy Hobart, a military engineer, designed modified Sherman and Churchill tanks.\nDeception.\nIn the months leading up to the invasion, the Allies worked at military deception. German coastal defences were stretched thin in 1944. Once Normandy had been chosen as the site of the invasion, it was decided to attempt to trick the Germans into thinking it was a fake invasion and that the true invasion was to be elsewhere. This was called Operation Bodyguard. In the weeks leading up to the invasion, the Allies tried to make the Germans think that the main invasion would take place at the Pas de Calais and in Norway. The deception was an industry in itself. It included dummy messages, dummy tanks in places near Dover and the south coast of England, using double agents to spread false information, dummy radio messages, and so on.\nThe deception was highly successful. It led Hitler to delay sending reinforcements from the Pas de Calais region for nearly seven weeks (the original plan had specified 14 days). In his memoirs, General Omar Bradley called \"Bodyguard\" the \"single biggest hoax of the war\".\nRehearsals and security.\nAllied forces rehearsed their roles for D-Day months before the invasion. On 28 April 1944, in south Devon on the British coast, 946 American soldiers and sailors were killed when German torpedo boats attacked one of these landing exercises, Exercise Tiger.\nThe security of D-Day was supported by stopping unplanned news from getting out of Britain. Travel to and from the Republic of Ireland was banned and movements near the coasts was not allowed. The German embassies and consulates in neutral countries were given false information.\nAll the same, there were several leaks before or on D-Day. An embassy spy in Istanbul gave the Germans documents containing references to Overlord, but these documents lacked detail. Another leak was General Charles de Gaulle's radio message after D-Day. He stated that this invasion was the real invasion. This had the potential to ruin the Allied tricks. Eisenhower referred to the landings as the initial invasion. The Germans did not believe de Gaulle and waited too long to move in extra troops against the Allies.\nAllied invasion plan.\nThe British did an airborne assault on the River Orne. The British goal was to capture the Orne River bridges to prevent German armor from using them and to prevent retreating Germans from blowing them up. This way, they could be used by Allied armor and vehicles.\nThe British sea attack units would attack through Sword and Gold Beaches. The United States had an airborne division and land units, which were to take Omaha Beach, the Pointe du Hoc and Utah Beach. The Canadians would work with British units to attack Sword Beach. The British and Canadians had separate beaches, Gold Beach and Juno Beach, respectively.\nThe Invasion Fleet was made upfrom eight navies made up of warships and submarines, split into the Western Naval Task Force (Rear-Admiral Alan G Kirk) and the Eastern Naval Task Force (Rear-Admiral Sir Philip Vian). The fleet was led by Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsay.\nCodenames.\nThe Allies assigned codenames to the various operations involved in the invasion. \"Overlord\" was the name for the landing on the Continent. Getting a secure hold on the area was codenamed \"Neptune\". It began on D-Day (6 June 1944) and ended on 30 June 1944. By this time, the Allies had control in Normandy. Operation \"Overlord\" also began on D-Day, and continued until Allied forces crossed the river Seine on 19 August 1944.\nGerman preparations and defenses.\nAtlantic Wall.\nThrough most of 1942 and 1943, the Germans thought successful Allied invasion in the west would not happen. Preparations were limited to building fortifications at the major ports. The number of military forces in Nazi Germany reached its peak during 1944 with 59 divisions in France, Belgium and the Netherlands.\nField Marshal Erwin Rommel was in charge of the wall. He improved the defences of the entire coastline. Steel obstacles were put on beaches, concrete bunkers and pillboxes constructed, and low-lying areas were flooded. Pointed stakes were set up on likely landing grounds to make it hard for the Allies to do airborne landings. The Germans fortified the foreshore area as part of their Atlantic Wall defences (including tank turrets and barbed wire).\nThese projects were not finished, especially in the Normandy sector. Allied bombing of the French railway system made it hard to move materials, and the Germans were convinced by the Allied tricks that the landings would take place in the Pas de Calais.\nThe sector which was attacked was guarded by four divisions, of which the 352nd and 91st were of high quality. The other defending troops included Germans who were not fit for active duty on the Eastern Front, conscripted Poles and former Soviet prisoners-of-war who had agreed to fight for the Germans. These units had German leaders.\nMobile reserves.\nRommel's defensive measures were made difficult by arguments over how to use armoured forces. Von Geyr and Rommel disagreed over the how to use Panzer divisions.\nRommel thought armoured formations be close to the coast, to attack while the invaders were weak. Von Geyr said they should instead be put around Paris and used in a big group when the Germans knew which beach was being invaded. Hitler made a compromise solution.\nRommel was given only three tank divisions, one of which was close enough to the Normandy beaches to fight on the first day. The other mechanized divisions were put under the control of the German Armed Forces HQ (OKW) and were placed across France, Belgium and the Netherlands.\nWeather forecast.\nThe opportunity for launching an invasion was limited to only a few days in each month, because a full moon was needed. This would provide light for the aircraft pilots and create a spring tide. Eisenhower had picked 5 June as the date for the assault. However, on 4 June, conditions were unsuitable for a landing. High winds and heavy seas made it impossible to launch landing craft. Low clouds would prevent aircraft finding their targets.\nMeteorologists predicted an improvement in the weather for 6 June. At a meeting on 5 June, Eisenhower and his senior commanders discussed the situation. Eisenhower decided to launch the invasion that night. Had Eisenhower delayed the invasion, the only option was to go two weeks later. This would have been during stormy weather.\nThe invasion.\nInland airborne landings.\nTo make it hard for the Germans to launch attacks during the sea attack phase, airborne operations were used to capture bridges and road crossings. The airborne landings behind the beaches were also designed to help the soldiers landing on beaches and destroy German coastal defense artillery.\nThe beaches.\nOn Sword Beach, the regular British infantry came ashore with few casualties. They had advanced about by the end of the day but did not get as far as Montgomery had wanted. Caen was still held by Germans by the end of D-Day and would remain so until Operation Charnwood on 9 July.\nThe Canadian forces that landed on Juno Beach had a difficult battle. German concrete fortifications and a sea wall twice as high as at Omaha Beach made it very difficult to attack. Juno was the second most heavily defended beach on D-Day, next to Omaha. Canadians were off the beach within hours and advancing inland. They were the only units to reach their D-Day goals, although most units fell back a few kilometres to make stronger defensive positions.\nAt Gold Beach, there were many dead and wounded because the Germans had strongly fortified a village on the beach. The 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division advanced almost to Bayeux by the end of the day. When commando units captured the Port-en-Bessin, the Allies could use their PLUTO pipeline to bring in fuel.\nThe Americans who landed on Omaha Beach faced the veteran German 352nd Infantry Division, one of the best trained groups on the beaches. Furthermore, Omaha was the most heavily fortified beach. Commanders considered abandoning the beach but small units of infantry got past the coastal defences. By the end of day two areas had been captured. The control over the beach expanded over the following days and the D-Day goals were accomplished by D+3.\nAt Pointe du Hoc, the 2nd Ranger battalion had to climb the cliffs. While they climbed, the enemy shot at them and dropped grenades. They used ropes and ladders to climb up and then destroy the guns.\nThe beach fortifications were important targets since a single artillery observer could have directed fire on the U.S. beaches. The Rangers captured the fortifications. They then had to fight for 2 days to hold the location, losing more than 60 percent of their men.\nThe number of dead and wounded on Utah Beach, the westernmost landing zone, were the lightest of any beach. Only 197 out of the 23,000 troops that landed were killed or wounded. The 4th Infantry Division troops that landed on the beach was able to move inland by early afternoon, linking up with the 101st Airborne Division.\nOnce the beaches were controlled, the Mulberry Harbours were set up around 9 June. One was constructed at Arromanches by British forces, the other at Omaha Beach by American forces. Severe storms on 19 June caused problems with the landing of supplies and destroyed the Omaha harbour. The Arromanches harbour was able to supply around 9,000 tons daily until the end of August 1944, by which time the port of Cherbourg had been captured by the Allies.\nThe German 21st Panzer division attacked between Sword and Juno beaches and nearly reached the Channel. Allied anti-tank gunners made them pull back before the end of 6 June.\nThe Allied invasion plans had called for the capture of Carentan, St. L\u00f4, Caen and Bayeux on the first day. The plan was to link all the beaches except Utah and Sword (the last linked with paratroopers) and a front line from the beaches. None of these goals had been achieved. The number of dead and wounded had not been as heavy as some had feared (around 10,000 compared to the 20,000 Churchill had estimated) and the bridges had survived the German attacks.\nCherbourg.\nIn the western part of the invasion area, US troops were to occupy the Cotentin Peninsula, especially Cherbourg. This would provide the Allies with a deep water harbour. The land behind Utah and Omaha was banks and hedgerows that tanks, gunfire and vision could not get through. This made them ideal defensive positions.\nThe U.S. infantry made slow progress and had many dead and wounded as they moved towards Cherbourg. The airborne troops were used to help with the advance. The far side of the peninsula was reached on 18 June. Hitler told German forces not to retreat to the strong Atlantic Wall fortifications in Cherbourg. The Cherbourg commander, Lieutenant General von Schlieben, surrendered on 26 June. Before surrendering he had most of the facilities destroyed, making the harbour inoperable until the middle of August, by which time the combat front had moved so far east that it was less helpful.\nCaen.\nWhile the Americans headed for Cherbourg, a unit of troops led by the British moved towards Caen. Montgomery made many attrition warfare attacks. The first was Operation Perch, which moved south from Bayeux to Villers-Bocage where the armour could capture Caen. It was halted at the Battle of Villers-Bocage. Caen was bombed and then occupied north of the River Orne in Operation Charnwood from 7 July until 9 July. An attack in the Caen area followed with all three British armoured divisions, codenamed \"Operation Goodwood\" from 18 July until 21 July. It captured the high ground south of Caen. The rest of the city was captured by Canadian forces during Operation Atlantic. A further operation, Operation Spring, from 25 July until 28 July, by the Canadians secured limited land south of the city, but with many dead and wounded.\nBreakout from the beachhead.\nMontgomery's plan included keeping the Germans in the eastern part of the invasion area, while protecting Cobra's position. By the end of Goodwood, the Germans had used the last of their reserve divisions; there were six and a half Panzer divisions against the British and Canadian forces compared to one and a half facing the United States armies.\n\"Operation Cobra\" was launched on 25 July by the U.S. First Army. It was successful. The VIII Corps entered Coutances at the western end of the Cotentin Peninsula on 28 July, after breaking through the German lines.\nOn 1 August, VIII Corps became part of Lieutenant General George S. Patton's Third Army. On 4 August, Montgomery changed the invasion plan by sending a corps to occupy Brittany and push the German troops around the ports, while the rest of the Third Army continued east. Because of the large number of German forces south of Caen, Montgomery moved the British armor west and launched Operation Bluecoat from 30 July until 7 August to add to the attacks from the United States armies. This pushed the German forces to the west, allowing the launch of Operation Totalize south from Caen on 7 August.\nFalaise pocket.\nBy the beginning of August, more German reserves became available. The German forces were being encircled and the German High Command wanted these reserves to help with a retreat to the Seine. Hitler demanded an attack at Mortain on 7 August. The attack was pushed back by the Allies, who again had advance warning from Ultra code breaking. The original Allied plan was for encircling the Germans as far as the Loire valley. Bradley realized that many of the German forces in Normandy were not able to move by this stage and he got Montgomery's approval by telephone on 8 August for to encircle German forces. This was left to Patton to do. He moved nearly unopposed through Normandy. The Germans were left in near Chambois. Strong German defense and the sending of some American troops for an attack by Patton towards the Seine at Mantes prevented the Germans from being trapped until 21 August. On this date, 50,000 German troops were trapped.\nWhether this could have been done earlier with more prisoners taken has been debated.\nThe liberation of Paris followed shortly afterwards. The French Resistance in Paris rose attacked the Germans on 19 August. The French 2nd Armoured Division under General Philippe Leclerc, along with the U.S. 4th Infantry Division accepted the surrender of the German forces there and liberated Paris on 25 August.\nWithdrawal to the Seine.\nOperations continued in the British and Canadian sector until the end of the month. On 25 August, the 2nd U.S. Armored Division fought its way into Elbeuf, making contact with both British and Canadian armoured divisions there. The 2nd Canadian Infantry Division advanced into the For\u00eat de la Londe, on the morning of 27 August. The area was strongly held and the 4th and 6th Canadian brigades had large numbers of dead and wounded over three days as the Germans defended their position. The Germans pulled back on the 29th, withdrawing over the Seine on the 30th.\nOn the 30th the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division crossed the Seine near Elbeuf and entered Rouen to a happy welcome.\nCampaign close.\nThe campaign in Normandy is considered by historians to end either at midnight on 24 July 1944 (the start of \"Operation Cobra\" on the American front), 25 August 1944 (the liberation of Paris), or 30 August 1944, the date the last German unit retreated across the River Seine.\nThe original \"Overlord\" plan was for a ninety-day campaign in Normandy with the ultimate goal of reaching the Seine; this goal was met early. American forces were fighting in Brittany as anticipated by General Montgomery during the latter weeks of the campaign. Historians consider the Normandy campaign to have ended with the massive breakout of \"Operation Cobra\".\nThe US official history describes the fighting beginning on 25 July as the \"Northern France\" campaign, and includes the fighting to close the Falaise Gap, which the British/Canadians/Poles consider to be part of the Battle of Normandy. Volume I of the Official History of the Canadian Army in the Second World War by C.P. Stacey, published in 1955, as well as the Canadian Army's official Historical Summary of the Second World War, published in 1948, define the Battle of Normandy as lasting from 6 June 1944 to 1 September 1944. The definition of the Battle of Normandy is also evident in another publication by the Army's Historical Section entitled \"Canada's Battle in Normandy\".\nThere were reports of Eisenhower requesting Montgomery's replacement in July. The lack of forward progress was caused by the rough land. However, as at the battle of El Alamein, Montgomery kept to his original attrition warfare strategy, reaching the objectives within his original ninety day target.\nVictory in Normandy was followed by a pursuit to the French border in short order. Germany was forced once again to reinforce the Western Front with manpower and resources from the Soviet and Italian fronts.\nBy September, Allied forces of seven field armies (two of which came through southern France in Operation Dragoon) were approaching the German frontier. The Allied battle plan was good, drawing on the strengths of both Britain and the United States. German leadership was often faulty, despite good fighting by German units.\nIn a larger context the Normandy landings helped the Soviets on the Eastern front, who were facing most of the German forces. It shortened of the conflict there.\nAllied logistics, intelligence, morale and air power.\nVictory in Normandy stemmed from several factors. The Allies had more weapons and equipment. They also had new inventions like the PLUTO pipelines and Mulberry harbours. These helped the flow of troops, equipment, fuel and ammunition. Movement of cargo over the open beaches went better than expected,even after the destruction of the U.S. Mulberry in the channel storm in mid-June.\nBy the end of July 1944, one million American, British, Canadian, French, and Polish troops, hundreds of thousands of vehicles, and a lot of supplies were ashore in Normandy. Artillery ammunition and other items were plentiful. This was impressive considering they did not hold a port until Cherbourg fell.\nBy the time of the Normany breakout the Allies also had superiority in numbers of troops (approximately 3.5:1) and armored vehicles (approximately 4:1) which helped overcome the natural advantages the rough land gave to the German defenders.\nAllied intelligence and counterintelligence efforts were successful. The Operation Fortitude trick plan before the invasion kept German attention focused on the Pas-de-Calais. High-quality German forces were kept in this area, away from Normandy, until July. Prior to the invasion, few German reconnaissance flights took place over Britain, and those that did saw only the fake camps. Ultra decoding of German Enigma (machine) communications had been helpful as well, exposing German plans.\nGerman leadership.\nLack of an organized strategy hurt the German defence. German leadership was split between Field Marshals von Rundstedt and Rommel. Von Rundstedt wanted to keep the powerful units in reserve, to do a powerful counterattack once the allied landing started. Rommel wanted to stop the allies at the beach. He tried to locate units so that they could attack quickly.\nWhile Rommel's plan was good, the reserve strategy was not good because units could not move during the day due to allied air strikes. In the end, the mix of two strategies was a disaster. The beach defences were overcome and the counterattacks were not strong enough. \nGerman commanders at all levels failed to react to the attack quickly. Communication problems added to the problems caused by Allied air and naval firepower. Local commanders did not lead an aggressive defence on the beach. The German High Command focused on the Calais area, and von Rundstedt was not permitted to use the armored reserve.\nWhen it was finally released late in the day, success was more difficult. Although the 21st Panzer Division, had attacked earlier, it faced strong opposition that had been allowed to build at the beaches. Overall, even though the Allied material superiority continued to grow, the Germans slowed the Allies advance for nearly two months, aided by the rough land.\nAlthough there were several disputes among the Allied commanders, their plans were decided by the main commanders. By contrast, the senior German leaders always had interference by Hitler, who did not know local conditions.\nField Marshals von Rundstedt and Rommel repeatedly asked Hitler for more freedom to change plans but were refused. Von Rundstedt was removed from his command on 29 June after he told Field Marshal Keitel, the Chief of Staff at OKW (Hitler's Armed Forces HQ), to make peace. Rommel was severely injured by Allied aircraft on 16 July.\nField Marshal von Kluge, who took over the posts held by both von Rundstedt and Rommel, was linked with some of the military plotters against Hitler, and he would not argue with Hitler for fear of arrest. As a result, the German armies in Normandy were pushed by Hitler to counterattack rather than retreat after the American breakthrough. Kluge was relieved of command on 15 August and killed himself. The more independent Field Marshal Walter Model then took command."}

It is home to over 400,000 people. It was named for General Moses Cleaveland in 1796, but according to legend a mistake in a local newspaper left out the first \"a\" in its name, which is why it is spelt like it is today. Its metropolitan area makes it the largest urban division in the state. \nDuring the 19th century, Cleveland's location at the mouth of the Cuyahoga River and Great Lakes port helped make it an important industrial center of the central United States. During World War II, the city became a center of manufacturing and industry, but deindustrialization caused a decline after that. Cleveland had a major revival in the 1980s and 1990s: The Playhouse Square theaters were restored, new skyscrapers like the BP Building and the Key Tower were built, new stadiums were built, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame was opened on the lakefront. After a smaller decline in the 2000s, Cleveland has begun to make another comeback. \nCleveland is home to the Great Lakes Brewing Company and Cleveland Orchestra.\nMany professional sports teams make their home in or near Cleveland. They include the Cleveland Indians, who play baseball; the Cleveland Browns, who play football; and the Cleveland Cavaliers, who play basketball. Both the Indians and the Cavaliers have their games at the Gateway District in Downtown while the Browns have a stadium on the shores of Lake Erie. The city's sports teams are known for from the 1964 NFL Championship Game to the 2016 NBA Finals. The city also hosted the Cleveland Grand Prix IndyCar race until 2008.\nEconomy.\nIn the past, Cleveland's economy relied on steel mills and manufacturing. Both are still a major part of the city today, but heavy industry in the area is much smaller than it once was. The city is known today for being a big center for medicine and medical technology, and the Cleveland Clinic is one of the most important hospital systems in the country.\nSome major large companies are headquartered in the city, including Sherwin Williams Paint, Cliffs Natural Resources, and Key Bank.\nCulture.\nCleveland is a big center for the performing arts, and is the home of Playhouse Square, the second largest theater district in the United States (the largest is Lincoln Center). The complex was built in the 1920s, and after being closed down were restored and reopened in the 1980s.\nThe Cleveland Orchestra is considered one of the world's finest, and is one of the \"Big Five\" in the United States.

He played with Goodman from August 1939 to June 1941. He was very good at playing many notes up and down on a sinle guitar string. By playing his guitar through an amplifier his guitar solos made the guitar very loud in the band.\nDeath.\nChristian died in March 1942 when he was only 26 years old. He had been sick with tuberculosis for several years before he died. \nEven though he was jazz guitarist who died before the music style rock and roll was started, he was still a large influence on rock and roll musicians. It was because of this that in 1990 Charlie Christian was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame even though he had never played rock and roll music.\nLegacy.\nCharles Henry Christian was raised in Oklahoma City in the American state of Oklahoma. In 2006 Oklahoma City renamed a street to \"Charlie Christian Avenue.\" There is also a yearly jazz music festival in Oklahoma City which is named after Charlie Christian."}

The house was designed by Irish-born James Hoban and built by slaves. It is at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW in Washington, D.C..\nHistory.\nThe building was built between 1792 and 1800 out of white-painted sandstone from Aquia Creek in Virginia. Hundreds of black slaves were forced to build the White House along with free workers. It was designed in the Neoclassical style. It has been the home of every U.S. President since John Adams. When Thomas Jefferson moved into the house in 1801, he (with architect Benjamin Henry Latrobe) expanded the building outward. They made two colonnades that were meant to hide stables and storage. It was originally called the Executive Mansion before being renamed the White House by President Theodore Roosevelt.\nIn 1814, during the War of 1812, the mansion was set on fire by the British Army in the Burning of Washington. Some of the soldiers who burned it were former slaves who had run away from their owners to fight with the British. They ate dinner in the house before setting it on fire. The fire destroyed the inside of the house and charred much of the outside. Reconstruction began almost immediately. President James Monroe moved into the partially reconstructed house in October 1817. Construction continued with the addition of the South Portico in 1824 and the North in 1829. \nBecause of crowding within the executive mansion itself, President Theodore Roosevelt had all work offices moved to the newly constructed West Wing in 1901. Eight years later, President William Howard Taft expanded the West Wing and created the first Oval Office. This was eventually moved as the section was expanded. The third-floor attic was changed into living quarters in 1927. A newly built East Wing was used as a reception area for social events. Jefferson's colonnades connected the new wings. East Wing changes were completed in 1946. These changes made more office space. By 1948, the house's load-bearing exterior walls and internal wood beams were found to be close to failure. Under Harry S. Truman, the interior rooms were completely taken apart and a new internal load-bearing steel frame was built inside the walls. Once this work was done, the interior rooms were rebuilt.\nToday, the White House Complex includes the Executive Residence, West Wing, East Wing, Blair House, and the Old Executive Office Building, a separate building west of the West Wing, which houses the executive offices of the President and Vice President.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an outbreak of COVID-19 at the White House in October 2020. During the outbreak, President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump were diagnosed with the infection.\nStructure.\nThe White House is made up of six stories\u2014 the two story basement, The Ground Floor, The State Floor, The Second Floor and The Third Floor.The term \"White House\" is regularly used as a metonym for the Executive Office of the President of the United States and for the president's administration and advisers in general. The property is owned by the National Park Service and is part of the President's Park. In 2007, it was ranked second on the American Institute of Architects list of \"America's Favorite Architecture.\""}

He was known for his dark comedy and jokes about politics, the English language, psychology, religion, and taboo. \nEarly life.\nCarlin was born and raised in Manhattan, New York City. Carlin said that he started to appreciate effective use of the English language because of his mother, though they had a difficult relationship and he often ran away from home. He grew up on West 121st Street in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, which he and his friends called \"White Harlem\" because it \"sounded a lot tougher than its real name\". \nHis mother had a television, which was a rare and new technology at the time, and Carlin became a fan of the late-night talk show \"Broadway Open House\" during its short run.\nCarlin joined the U.S. Air Force and trained as a radar technician. During his time in the Air Force, he had been court-martialed three times and received many nonjudicial punishments and reprimands. \nCareer.\nThe first of Carlin's 14 stand-up comedy specials for HBO was filmed in 1977. From the late 1980s, his performances were focused on sociocultural criticism of American society. \nCarlin acted in movies including \"Jersey Girl\", \"Dogma\", \"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure\" (and its sequel), \"Scary Movie 3\", and Disney's \"Tarzan 2\". He also narrated the children's television series \"Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends\" from 1984 to 1995 (Actor Alec Baldwin later took over the role in 1998), and Portrayed Mr. Conductor on \"Shining Time Station\".\nHe was known for his \"seven dirty words\" routine. The routine was about seven words people should not say in the media. (The list was ironically used by many radio stations, as a guide to what kind of language was not allowed.) Comedy Central called Carlin one of the greatest stand-up comedians. \nPersonal life.\nCarlin married Brenda Hosbrook on June 3, 1961, together they have a daughter named Kelly. They remained married until her death in 1997, just a few day's before Carlin's 60th birthday. Carlin then married Sally Wade on June 24, 1998, the married lasted until Carlin's death in 2008.\nDeath.\nCarlin had a history of heart problems. He had several heart attacks. He died of heart failure in Santa Monica, California at age 71."}

The storm formed over the Bahamas on August 23, where it moved west and hit south Florida as a Category 1 hurricane two days later. Katrina then crossed over Florida and strengthened into a Category 5 hurricane moving west in the Gulf of Mexico. The storm then turned north, had an eyewall replacement cycle, and hit east Louisiana and Mississippi, flooding coastal areas on the morning of August 29. The leftovers of Katrina then died out over the Great Lakes on August 31.\n80% of New Orleans was flooded when the levees protecting the city broke. Most of the people killed by Katrina were thought to have died from drowning. Many of the survivors had swum to higher roofs or tree branches.\nStorm history.\nHurricane Katrina formed as Tropical Depression Twelve over the southeastern Bahamas on August 23, 2005, as the result of the merger of a tropical wave and the remnants of Tropical Depression Ten four days earlier. The storm strengthened into Tropical Storm Katrina on the morning of August 24. The tropical storm moved towards Florida and became a hurricane only two hours before making landfall between Hallandale Beach and Aventura on the morning of August 25. The storm weakened over land, but it regained hurricane status about one hour after entering the Gulf of Mexico, and it continued strengthening over open waters. On August 27, the storm reached Category 3 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale, becoming the third major hurricane of the season. An eyewall replacement cycle disrupted the intensification but caused the storm to nearly double in size. Thereafter, Katrina rapidly intensified over the \"unusually warm\" waters of the Loop Current from a Category 3 hurricane to a Category 5 hurricane in just nine hours.\nAfter attaining Category 5 status on the morning of August 28, Katrina reached its peak strength at 1800 UTC, with maximum sustained winds of 175\u00a0mph (280\u00a0km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 902 mbar (26.6 inHg). The pressure measurement made Katrina the fifth most intense Atlantic hurricane on record at the time, only to be surpassed by Hurricanes Rita and Wilma later in the season; it was also the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Gulf of Mexico at the time, before Rita broke the record. The hurricane subsequently weakened due to another eyewall replacement cycle, and Katrina made its second landfall at 1110 UTC on August 29, as a Category 3 hurricane with sustained winds of 125\u00a0mph (205\u00a0km/h), near Buras-Triumph, Louisiana. At landfall, hurricane-force winds extended outward 120\u00a0miles (190\u00a0km) from the center and the storm's central pressure was 920 mbar (27 inHg). After moving over southeastern Louisiana and Breton Sound, it made its third and final landfall near the Louisiana\u2013Mississippi border with 120\u00a0mph (190\u00a0km/h) sustained winds, still at Category 3 intensity. Katrina maintained strength well into Mississippi, finally losing hurricane strength more than 150\u00a0miles (240\u00a0km) inland near Meridian, Mississippi. It was downgraded to a tropical depression near Clarksville, Tennessee; its remnants were absorbed by a cold front in the eastern Great Lakes region on August 31. The resulting extratropical storm moved rapidly to the northeast and affected eastern Canada.[1]"}

The bass guitar is shaped like an electric guitar, but it is longer than an electric guitar. The electric bass has many of the same parts as an electric guitar. However, the bass guitar produces lower tones than the electric guitar. \nThe bass guitar is used to play low musical sounds called \"bass lines\" in many styles of music such as rock, pop, country, jazz fusion and many more.\nHistory.\nThe bass guitar was first made in the 1930s by inventor Paul Tutmarc in Seattle, Washington. However, very few musicians were interested in the instrument that Tutmarc made. The need for a new instrument developed in the 1950s. At that time, the double bass was the main bass instrument used in jazz, blues, folk, early rock music and bluegrass. The problem was that the double bass was big, heavy, hard to carry around, hard to play precise notes on, and it was hard to make it louder with a bass amplifier. Musicians wanted a smaller instrument that weighed less and was easier to play and amplify. Inventors tried to think of ways of building a smaller and lighter bass instrument. One of these inventors was a man named Leo Fender in the United States. Leo Fender developed a bass guitar in the 1950s using the ideas developed by Tutmarc. \nLeo Fender used many parts for the bass guitar that are similar to the parts of an electric guitar. Leo Fender called the instrument the \"Fender Precision Bass\". He used the word \"Precision\" in the name because his instrument had metal frets on the neck. The double bass did not have frets on its neck. The frets on the bass guitar made it easier for musicians to play precise notes. The bass guitar developed by Leo Fender became very popular. In the 2000s, many bass guitars are still designed to look like his Fender Precision Bass.\nDescription.\nBass guitars are normally made out of wood. The main pieces are the body, neck, fingerboard, frets, and strings. The body is made out of wood. A wooden neck is glued or bolted onto the body. A wooden fingerboard is then glued onto the neck. Thin metal strips called frets are glued onto the fingerboard. The frets are placed at specific placess along the fretboard, with each fret representing one half step in the Western tonal scale.\nAt the bottom of the body is an assembly called the bridge, a large metal assembly into which one end of the strings are fitted. On some designs, the strings are fasted through the back of the body into the bridge; on others, the strings fit into the front side of the bridge. In some basses, there is a cavity inside the back of the body that contains the electrical parts of the bass. These are usually called active basses. The bridge often has adjustments that allow the height of the strings to be changed. Other components found on the body include one or more pickups and various knobs or switches that control the sound of the bass.\nThe pickups are magnetic devices that sit below the strings. As the strings vibrate, an electrical signal is produced which is sent via an instrument cable to an amplifier. Pickups are either \"passive\", which means they send the signal with no additional amplification, or \"active\", which process the signal through a pre-amplifier. Some basses have pickups that can be set to passive or active mode. Basses that have two pickups (generally referred to as bridge and neck pickups) often have a switch that lets the player select neck-only, bridge-only, or a blended signal. Each pickup may have different tonal qualities that results from its placement relative to the bridge and its components.\nAt the other end of the fretboard from the body sits the headstock, which generally holds the tuners that lets player adjust the tuning of the strings. At the very end the fretboard, where the strings pass from the fretboard to the tuners, there is a nut, a piece made of metal or plastic, with grooves to hold the strings off the fretboard.\nInside most fretboards is a long metal rod, called a trussrod, that is used to adjust the tension on the neck. The neck is slightly concave, which allows the strings to clear all frets without \"buzzing.\" The amount of bow, along with adjustments made on the bridge, will determine the height of the strings along the fretboard. \nThe scale of an electric bass - the length of the strings from the nut to the bridge - is generally 34 inches (84 centimeters), although shorter and longer basses are produced. In earlier decades, short-scale basses were more common, since many designers adapted guitar parts for early models. Because in some styles of music, such as heavy metal, the strings are tuned down, longer scaled basses are sometimes favored for such styles, as string tension is higher. \nStandard bass guitars have four metal strings, but models with five, six or eight strings are also made. The strings themselves are made in different ways and with different materials to change their tonal qualities.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s some musicians took the frets off their bass guitars. This changes the sound of the bass, particularly as the player slides their fingers along the strings. A bass guitar without frets is called a fretless bass guitar. For example Pino Palladino played a fretless bass during the 1980s. He was a session musician, playing for high profile musicians like Eric Clapton and David Gilmour. While fretless basses are often used in jazz and jazz fusion, bassists from other genres use fretless basses, such as metal bassist Steve DiGiorgio and Colin Edwin of modern/progressive rock band [Porcupine Tree].\nStrings and sound.\nThe standard design for the electric bass guitar has four strings, generally tuned E, A, D and G (low to high). It is not uncommon for players to tune strings to a lower pitch, particularly in styles, such as heavy metal, that favor deeper sounds. Five string basses add a lower string, usually tuned to B, while six-string-basses add a higher string tuned to C. In standard tunings, each string is tuned a perfect fourth interval above the next lower string (e.g. E to A). \nSounds are produced from the strings in a number of ways. The most common form of playing is called fingerstyle, in which the player plucks the fingers upwards with the ends of the fingers. It is common to use the index and middle fingers as the plucking fingers, but players may use more fingers or even employ their thumb to pluck downwards. Other finger-based techniques include slap-and-pop, in which the player strikes the lower-pitched strings firmly with their thumb, and pulls higher-pitched strings upwards and lets them snap against the fretboard, and tapping, in which the player hammers downward with their fingertips on the fretboard.\nPicks made of metal or plastic may also be used, and yield a sharper sound than plucking with fingers. Picking is sometimes combined with muting techniques to create distinctive sounds.\nThe bridge of the bass guitar may be fitted with a tremolo, which enables the player to vary the pitch of their strings while playing. \nWhere the strings are struck relative to bridge changes to the tone of the sound considerably. Plucking or picking close the bridge generally produces a more muted note, while sounding the string closer to the neck produces a fuller, more resonant tone.\nBass guitars also have magnetic pickups mounted on the body underneath the strings. A musician plucks the strings with their fingers. This makes the strings vibrate. The magnetic pickups detect the vibrations. Then the vibrations from the strings are converted into an electronic signal which is sent with a metal cable to an electronic amplifier and a loudspeaker. The musician rotates a volume control knob that is located on the body of the bass to make the sound"}

Mount Everest, the highest mountain in the world, and the Himalaya Mountains are in Nepal. 12 of the world's highest mountain peaks are in Nepal. It is also the birthplace of Buddha. It has recently become a secular country, but before it was the only Hindu kingdom in the world. Nepal is a very important pilgrimage place for both Hindus and Buddhists. The population of Nepal in 2007 was almost 29 million people.\nNepali is the official language of the country, but there are many other regional languages in Nepal. Many people in Nepal understand English and Hindi as well. The capital city of Nepal is Kathmandu, which has a population of over 1.4 million people. The second-largest city is Pokhara. Pokhara is a major tourist attraction of Nepal which is rich in natural beauty. Pokhara includes many lakes, Phewa Tal is one of them.\nGeography.\nNepal is a landlocked country, which means it is not next to any ocean, and it is surrounded by India and China. Eight of the ten tallest mountain peaks in the world, including Mount Everest, are in Nepal. Mount Everest is on the border Nepal shares with China. Nepal is a little smaller than Illinois and Bangladesh, but a little bigger than Kyrgyzstan. It also has the second-highest average elevation in the world at (10,715\u00a0ft), only behind Bhutan.\nEconomy.\nNepal used to be an agricultural country until 1950. Since 1951 it entered the modern era and has made progress. Agriculture, however, is still a major economic activity. 80% of the people do agricultural works and it provides 37% of GDP. Only about 20% of the total area is cultivable while another 33% is covered by forest. Most of the remaining land is covered by mountains. Rice and wheat are the main food crops. The lowland Terai region produces a high amount of agricultural products. A part of those products is supplied to the hill areas, which produces less.\nChina is the 2nd largest exporter to Nepal, but its imports from Nepal are zero. This burdens Nepal's monetary stability and monetary balance. India is the largest buyer of Nepal's goods.The yearly monsoon rain, or lack of it, strongly influences economic growth. From 1996 to 1999, real GDP growth averaged less than 4%. The growth rate recovered in 1999, rising to 6% before slipping slightly in 2001 to 5.5%. Nepal has 1/3 of its trade with India.\nDemographics.\nThe people of Nepal belong to two main groups; Indo-Aryan group and Tibeto-Burman group. Indo-Aryans are mostly Hindus and they celebrate Hindu festivals like Dashain, Tihar, Teej, Maghe Sankranti, Krishna Janmastami, Holi, Janai Purnima, Matatirtha Aunsi, Chhath, etc. Tibeto-Burmans are Buddhist and they celebrate Lhosar, Buddha Jayanti, etc.\nEducation.\nModern education in Nepal started with the opening of the first school in 1853. This school was only for the members of the ruling families and their courtiers. Schooling for the general people began only after 1951. It was when a popular movement ended the autocratic Rana family regime and started a democratic system. In the past 50 years, there has been a big expansion of education facilities in the country. As a result, adult literacy (age 15+) of the country was reported to be 48.2% (female: 34.6%, male: 62.2%) in the Population Census, 2001, up from about 5% in 1952\u201354. In the beginning in 1951, there were about 300 schools and two colleges with around 10,000 students. Now, there are more than 26,000 schools (including higher secondary), 415 colleges, five universities, and two academies of higher studies. In total, 5.5 million students are studying in those schools and colleges who are taught by more than 150,000 teachers.\nDespite such examples of success, there are problems and challenges. Education management, quality, usefulness, and access are some of the major issues of education in Nepal. Social differences based on gender, ethnicity, location, economic class, etc. are still there in some places. Lack of resources has always been a problem in education. These problems have made the goal of education for all a challenge for the country.\nAdministrative subdivisions.\nNepal has seven provinces. Each province has 8 to 14 districts. The districts have local units called municipalities.\nCulture.\nThe official calendar of Nepal is the Vikram Samvat, which is a Hindu calendar. Their new year begins in Baishakh, which is around mid-April. Nepal has 36 public holidays in the year. This makes Nepal the country with the most public holidays.\nThe national cuisine of Nepal is Dhindo and Gundruk. Dhindo is a type of dough that is served very hot. Gundruk is a dish with fermented green vegetables.\nAssociation football is the most popular sport in Nepal. The Nepal national football team plays at Dasarath Rangasala Stadium in Tripureswar, Kathmandu, Nepal.\nNational symbols of Nepal.\nThe national symbols of Nepal, according to the Interim Constitution, are:\nHistory.\nKing Prithvi Narayan Shah of Gorkha invaded the Kathmandu Valley in 1786 and unified Nepal. Before the unification, Nepal was ruled by various Kirats, Lichchavis, Thakuris and Mallas. The history mentioned that Kirats ruled Nepal during the 7th century BC. Though much was not known about Kirats, the Lichchavi dynasty ruled after them. Lichchavi rule lasted from the 2nd to 9th century AD. After Lichchavis, Nepal was ruled by the Thakuris who were followed by the Mallas for two centuries. Nepal was divided into many principalities and small kingdoms in the fifth centuries of Malla rule.\nJang Bahadur Rana the then Prime Minister of Nepal revolted against the royalty in 1844. The famous Kot Massacre took place during this period in which numbers of noblemen were killed. The Rana took absolute power but continued to maintain the Shah family in the palace. The 104 years regime of Ranas came to and end due to their autocratic rules.\nIn November 1950, King Tribhuvan restored democracy overthrowing the Rana regime with large number of Nepalese people support. He restored Shah Regime again in Nepal. After his death King Mahendra had ruled in Nepal from 13 March 1955 to 31 January 1972.\nBirendra ruled Nepal from 31 January 1972 to 1 June 2001. He was known as one of the most noble and peaceful king of Nepal. The entire family of King Birendra was killed in June 2001 popularly Known as Royal Massacre 2001. Prince Dipendra was made King while he was on coma stage, later he died in hospital bed. After the death of Diepndra, Gyanendra Shah late King Birendra\u2019s brother became the King of Nepal.\nKing Gyanendra Shah was dethroned in 2006 after a decade long People\u2019s revolution led by communist party of Nepal (Maoist) and several weeks protest by major political parties. After that, Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal was established."}

It is in the eastern prairie region of western Canada. It is often called the \"Gateway to the West\". Winnipeg is the seventh biggest city in Canada with a population of 705,244 people.\nThe name \"Winnipeg\" comes from the Cree word for \"muddy waters.\" Winnipeg is at the place where the Red River and Assiniboine river join. That area is known as \"The Forks\".\nWinnipeg has four professional sports teams. The teams are the \"Winnipeg Blue Bombers\" who play football, the \"Winnipeg Jets\" who play hockey, the Winnipeg Goldeyes who play baseball and the Winnipeg Alliance FC who play soccer. Winnipeg has four universities: the University of Manitoba, the University of Winnipeg, Canadian Mennonite University and University of St. Boniface.\nWinnipeg is in a very flat part of Canada. Winnipeg has four rivers in it. These rivers are the Red River, the Assiniboine River, the La Salle River, and the Seine River. Winnipeg has floods in spring a lot because it is in a very flat area that gets a lot of snow and rain. In winter, Winnipeg is cold and gets a lot of snow. The hottest day in Winnipeg was in the year 1936, when it was 42 degrees Celsius. The coldest day in Winnipeg was in the year 1879, when it was -47 degrees Celsius.\nHistory.\nThe area that we now call Winnipeg was used by First Nations people for many thousands of years before people from Europe arrived. First Nations people used this area a lot. This area was important because it is where two rivers meet. First Nations peoples often moved around using the rivers on canoes (a small boat that is powered by people with paddles).\nThe first person from Europe to come to this area was an officer from France in the year 1738. This area was first used as a permanent settlement (place where people live) by European people in the year 1812. Winnipeg was incorporated (officially made into a city) in the year 1873. Winnipeg became big because trains brought money and people from other places along the railroads. After World War I, Winnipeg stopped getting bigger for a long time. After World War II, Winnipeg has been getting bigger again. In the year 1972, Winnipeg got bigger by adding other small cities nearby into one big city, and the new big city was also named Winnipeg.\nCityscape and Politics.\nWinnipeg has a downtown area in the middle of the city. The downtown area has many tall buildings. Downtown is a place where there are a lot of offices and stores. All around Winnipeg's downtown are residential neighbourhoods (places where people live).\nThere is a big road that goes all the way around the city. This road is called the Perimeter Highway. The two best known roads in Winnipeg are called Portage Avenue and Main Street. The place where these two roads meet is in the middle of Winnipeg's downtown area. Main Street goes from the middle of the city to the northern part of the city. Portage Avenue goes from the middle of the city to the western part of the city.\nThe mayor of Winnipeg makes decisions about the city in City Hall. Winnipeg's mayor is a man named Brian Bowman. City Hall is in downtown Winnipeg.\nThe provincial premier is a person who makes decisions about Manitoba. Manitoba is the province that Winnipeg is in. Manitoba's provincial premier is Brian Pallister. The premier makes decisions at the legislative building."}

According to the IEC, the correct name for 1,024 bytes is a kibibyte.\nOne thousand kilobytes make one megabyte."}
{"id": "14471", "revid": "7796156", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14471", "title": "Byte", "text": "A byte is a unit of measurement of the size of information on a computer or other electronic device. A single byte is usually eight bits. Some early computers used six bits for each byte. Bits are the smallest unit of storage on a computer, a single on/off value. Bytes are often represented by the capital letter B, bits by a lower case b.\nA single typed character (for example, 'x' or '8') is stored in one byte. The character is held as a binary number which encodes a text character. To map each number to a character an agreed code such as EBCDIC or ASCII is needed. EBCDIC is a character encoding used mainly on mainframe computers. It uses 8 bits per byte. ASCII is another encoding that only uses seven bits. \"Extended ASCII\" uses 8 bits to give more types of characters, mostly used on personal computers.\nThe byte is the smallest useful unit of measure to show how many characters a computer (or electronics device) can hold. This is useful for things like RAM, or storage devices like USB drives and other types of Flash memory. Sending of data (for a modem or wi-fi) is usually measured in bits, not bytes.\nOn modern computers one byte is equal to eight bits. Some early computers used fewer bits for each byte. To tell them apart, computer scientists called an 8 bit byte an octet. In modern usage, an octet and a byte are the same. \nAbbreviation.\nThe symbol for \"byte\" is \"B\". Sometimes a lowercase \"b\" is used, but this use is incorrect because \"b\" is actually the IEEE symbol for \"bit\". The IEC symbol for bit is bit. For example, \"MB\" means \"megabyte\" and \"Mbit\" means \"megabit\". The difference is important because 1 megabyte (MB) is 1,000,000 bytes, and 1 megabit (Mbit) is 1,000,000 bits or 125,000 bytes. It's easy to confuse the two, but bits are much smaller than bytes, so the symbol \"b\" should be used when referring to \"bits\" and an uppercase \"B\" when referring to \"bytes\".\nNames for larger units.\nFor large data, byte is often used with a binary prefix:\nThe following terms represent even larger units of bytes, but are very rarely used:\nByte Chart.\nAccording to the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), who sets many computer standards, these charts show how bytes should be referred to.\nPeople who refer to 1 kilobyte as 1,024 bytes, for example, are technically incorrect; 1,024 bytes should be referred to as 1 kibibyte, according to the IEC. However, using 1024 for kilo and 1048576 for mega, etc. was widely practiced before the IEC standards were set in 1998. There is some confusion and mixing of terms in the marketplace. Computer memory is still referred to in powers of 2, so 1KB of memory is 1024 bytes, whereas in computer data storage powers of 10 are used, so 1KB is 1000 bytes.\n\"kilo-\" = 1,000.\nWhen using standard metric names like \"kilo-\", \"mega-\" and \"giga-\", they should follow the same measure that other metric measurements use, like kilometer (1 kilometer = 1,000 meters), or gigahertz (1 gigahertz = 1,000,000,000 hertz) for example.\n\"kibi-\" = 1,024.\nSince computers are very complex digital devices that are based on the binary numeral system rather than the commonly-used decimal numeral system or binary coded decimal system, there are many situations where the standard metric system does not work well, particularly with memory sizes for a computer or storage device. If a memory or storage device uses a binary number for addresses, the number of different positions to be accessed (the size of the memory) can be expressed as a power of 2, rather than a power of 10.

This means it is very, very small. Like atoms and molecules, a subatomic particle is far too small to be seen with the naked eye. It is also very interesting to scientists who try to understand atoms better. The commonly studied subatomic particles are the main ones that make atoms: protons, neutrons, and electrons. The study of subatomic particles is called particle physics. \nThese particles are often held together within an atom by one of the four fundamental forces (gravity, electromagnetic force, strong force, or weak force). Outside of the atom the particles often move very, very quickly- near the speed of light which is very, very fast (around 300,000 kilometres per second).\nSubatomic particles are divided into two groups, Baryons and Leptons.\nBaryons are made of quarks while Leptons are thought to be among the smallest particles, called elementary particles. Baryons have a given Baryon number. In reactions, the Baryon number must be conserved, meaning that both the starting and ending sides of a reaction must have the same number of Baryons. Baryonic particles are made up of a combination of 3 of the six quarks, which are among the smallest particles. The six quark types are up, down (making up protons and neutrons), strange, charm, top, and bottom.\nLeptons are generally much smaller than Baryons. This category includes electrons, Muons, Taus and neutrinos. Leptons are not made up of quarks and are not divisible. \nFor every one of these types, there is also an antiparticle. Antiparticles have the same mass as their normal counterparts, except they have the opposite electric charge. Anti-matter and matter cannot exist near each other. Whenever matter and antimatter collide, they destroy each other with a huge release of energy equivalent to E=mc2, where m is the combined mass of the particles, c is the speed of light, and E is the energy produced. These collisions often take place in large particle accelerators, where the energy can be converted the other way, into matter by the same equation. This can produce many odd, often heavy (large mass) particles that exist only for a short time.\nMost of the particles discovered are created by accelerating particles and colliding them against others, creating huge showers of new subatomic particles which decay extremely quickly. However, because the particles are moving close to the speed of light, the laws of special relativity become important and time dilation occurs. This means that time passes slower for the particle, and they can travel (and be measured) over a longer distance than non-relativity science would predict."}

{"id": "14474", "revid": "1025654", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14474", "title": "Breathing", "text": "Breathing is moving air in and out of the lungs. The air going in and out is called \"breath\". If a person cannot breathe, they will die.\nBreathing helps people do two very important things:\nWhen a person breathes in, they bring air into their lungs. Air has oxygen in it. The oxygen goes from the lungs into the person's bloodstream. When oxygen goes into the bloodstream, extra carbon dioxide comes out and goes into the lungs. This is called gas exchange: basically, oxygen and carbon dioxide are changing places. Oxygen is now in the bloodstream, which can carry that oxygen around to every part of the body. Also, carbon dioxide is now in the lungs, where it can be breathed out.\nAdults breathe about 18 times a minute, which is more than 25,000 times a day. Children breathe even faster.\nHow the brain controls breathing.\nA part of the brainstem called the medulla oblongata controls breathing. Groups of neurons in the medulla tell the breathing muscles when to breathe in, when to breathe faster, and when to breathe slower.\nThe brainstem measures how much carbon dioxide is in a person's blood. If there is too much carbon dioxide, the medulla tells the body to breathe faster. This helps the person breathe out the extra carbon dioxide. Once the amount of carbon dioxide in the blood is normal again, the medulla tells the body to breathe slower again.\nThe body also measures the amount of oxygen in the blood. If there is not enough oxygen in the blood, the medulla will tell the body to breathe faster, to take in more oxygen. Once there is enough oxygen in the blood, the medulla will tell the body to breathe slower again.\nBreathing muscles.\nFor a person to breathe, certain muscles have to contract (get tighter) and relax at the right times. The special groups of neurons in the medulla tell these breathing muscles when to contract (which makes a person breathe in) and when to relax (which makes a person breathe out). There are a few main groups of muscles that control breathing.\nThe diaphragm.\nThe diaphragm is the main muscle that controls breathing. It is a sheet of muscle that runs along the bottom of the rib cage. When the diaphragm is relaxed, it is shaped like a dome (like a half circle). When the medulla tells the diaphragm to make the body breathe in, the diaphragm pulls down and straightens out. This creates more room inside the chest, and more room for the lungs to fill up with air. Air comes into the lungs (this is inhalation). When it is time to breathe out, the diaphragm relaxes again and air leaves the lungs.\nAbout 60% - 70% of a person's ability to breathe comes from the diaphragm.\nThe diaphragm is controlled by a special set of nerves called the phrenic nerves. The medulla tells the diaphragm when to contract by sending messages through the phrenic nerves. Because the diaphragm is so important for breathing, the phrenic nerves are very well protected in the body. They are at the very top of the spinal cord, near the neck.\nThe intercostals (rib muscles).\nThe intercostal muscles run between each rib. When a person needs to breathe in, these muscles contract and pull the ribs upward. This creates more room inside the chest for the lungs to fill.\nWhen a person is resting, the about 30% to 40% of their ability to breathe comes from the intercostal muscles.\nThe intercostal muscles are controlled by the intercostal nerves. The medulla tells the intercostals when to contract by sending messages through these nerves. The intercostal nerves are not as well protected as the phrenic nerves. The intercostal nerves run along the thoracic spine (which is in the upper to middle back) and connect to the intercostal muscles. This means that if a person injured their thoracic spine, they might not be able to use their intercostal muscles. They would then lose 30% to 40% of their ability to breathe. However, since the nerves that control the diaphragm are much farther up in the spine and better protected, the person would still be able to use their diaphragm to breathe. They would still have 60% to 70% of their ability to breathe.\nAccessory muscles.\nAccessory muscles are muscles that a person uses only when they need extra help breathing. Sometimes this is normal. For example, if a person has just done a lot of exercise, they may need extra oxygen. The medulla will tell the accessory muscles to kick in, to make it easier for the person to lift their chest to create more room for the lungs to fill. The most important accessory muscles are the muscles in the chest, abdomen, and neck.\nHowever, if a person has to use accessory muscles to breathe while they are resting, this is a sign that they are not getting the oxygen their body needs. They may need medication, extra oxygen given through a mask, or even emergency medical treatment to help them breathe normally. For example, people with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) often use an inhaler when they have trouble breathing. The inhaler puffs a medicine like albuterol down into the windpipe and into the lungs. This makes the air passages wider and helps the person breathe better than they could before."}

Plants which live this kind of life-style are called xerophytes. Most are succulents, which store water.\nCacti are members of the plant family Cactaceae, in the order Caryophyllales. There are about 127 genera, with over 1750 known species. \"Almost all of them are native to the Americas\", from Patagonia in the south to parts of western Canada in the north. The species \"Rhipsalis baccifera\" also grows in Africa and Sri Lanka.\nTheophrastus was the first to use the word \"cactus\": It comes from Ancient Greek . Theophrastus used it for a spiny plant whose identity is not known for sure. Cacti are part of an important food chain in dry, hot climates. Now cacti have spread to many other parts of the world, and many people like to grow them in pots or gardens.\nMany cacti live in dry places, such as deserts. Most cacti have sharp thorns (stickers) and thick skin. There are many shapes and sizes of cacti. Some are short and round; others are tall and thin. Many cactus flowers are big and beautiful. Some bloom at night and are pollinated by moths and bats. Some cactus fruits are brightly coloured and good to eat: many animals eat cactus fruits.\nAdaptations.\nAn adaptation is anything that helps a living thing survive and make more of its own kind. Cacti have many adaptations for living in places that are sometimes dry for a long time. At other times these places can get lots of rain.\nCacti can have many small, thin roots near the top of the soil. These roots take in water quickly after a rain. The same cactus may have one long, thick root called a taproot. The taproot grows deep in the soil. It can reach water when the soil on top is dry.\nCacti store water in thick stems. The stems are covered with tough skin, and the skin is covered with wax. The thick waxy skin slows down loss of water. The leaves of cacti are sharp spines (thorns, stickers). Many animals want the water inside the cactus, but the sharp spines and thick skin protect the cactus.\nUses of cacti.\nCacti are commonly grown as houseplants. They are pretty and easy to grow. Some cacti are grown in gardens, especially in dry areas. Cactus can be used as a living fence. The wood of dead cactus is sometimes used for houses\nPeople eat the fruit of some kinds of cactus, such as dragonfruit and prickly pear. \"Dactylopius coccus\" is a scale insect from which cochineal dye is got. This insect lives on cacti from the genus \"Opuntia\", feeding on moisture and nutrients in the cactus sap. The insect produces carminic acid, which deters predation by other insects. The carminic acid can be extracted from the insect's body and eggs to make the red dye.\nCactus in history.\nThe ancient Aztecs of North America held cactus to be very important. Cactus can be found in many of their sculptures and drawings. The national coat of arms of Mexico shows an eagle, a snake, and cactus.\nChristopher Columbus brought the first cactus to Europe. Scientists and gardeners became very interested in cactus.\nPrickly pear was taken to Australia in the 19th century for use as a natural fence and for use in the cochineal industry. The cactus spread out of control, but was controlled by the larva of a South American moth.\nFrom the start of the 20th century interest in cactus has grown. Every year, scientists discover new kinds of cactus. A bad effect of this has been the digging up of many cacti from the wild, making some kinds endangered.\nCactus stems.\nA cactus does not have leaves because it lives in dry places. Leaves transpire, and this can waste water. So, the cactus saves water by having no leaves. The green parts of the cactus are actually its stems. Because the stems are green, they do the photosynthesis for the cactus. They also grow prickly needles to protect the cactus from animals that want to eat it.\nGenera.\nThe family contains more than 100 genera. Some of them are:"}

Another source defines it as \"any region that can have a moisture deficit over the course of a year. In other words, they can have less rainfall in a year than they give up through evaporation\".\nThese kinds of areas can cover about 33% of the land on Earth. That includes much of Antarctica, where large areas get no snow at all. The largest hot desert is the Sahara desert, in northern Africa, covering 9 million square kilometers.\nDeserts land surfaces are various examples are stones, sand dunes and snow. They have a wide variety of animals and plants. Deserts sometimes expand (desertification), and sometimes contract. \nDeserts are mostly found in the western part of the Americas, Western Asia, Central Australia, and South and North Africa. Many, such as the Sahara, are very hot during the day and have cold nights, but there are also cold deserts such as the Atacama in South America which remain frozen day and night. \nCold deserts.\nThere are hot deserts and cold deserts. Cold deserts may be covered with snow or ice but some are so dry that the ice sublimates away. Some cold deserts have a short season of above-freezing temperatures. These deserts are called tundra. An ice cap can be a cold desert that remains below freezing all year-round. \nCold deserts can be found close to the poles. That is why they are also called polar deserts. Other regions of the world have cold deserts too, for instance high altitude areas like the Himalayas. These are called montane deserts. Antarctica is the world's largest cold desert.\nHot deserts.\nHot deserts are mostly in the subtropics. They can be covered by sand, rock, salt lakes, stony hills and even mountains. Most non-polar deserts are hot in the day and chilly at night. The temperature in the daytime can reach or higher in the summer, and dip to or lower at night time in the winter.\nThe largest hot desert in the world is the Sahara in North Africa. It is almost as large as Europe or the United States. The Sahara desert is also the hottest desert in the world.\nThe driest desert in the world is the Atacama Desert in South America. The Atacama Desert had no rain for 401 years, between 1570 and 1971. This desert is caused by a cold ocean current.\nRain.\nIt does rain in the desert, but not often. One place in the Atacama Desert had no rain for 401 years. In other deserts it may rain every year or once every few years. Rains in a desert may bring a great amount of water to the ground in a short time. Some rain passes straight into the dry soil, but the rest may form a temporary river. Wadis, stream channels that are normally dry, can quickly fill after heavy rain, causing a flash flood. \nPeople sometimes bring water from wet places to hot deserts so plants can grow. This is called irrigation.\nSandstorm.\nA sandstorm or dust storm arises when wind blows loose sand and dust from a dry surface. Clouds of sand or dust are often so dense that they obscure the sun. A sandstorm can move whole sand dunes. Sandstorms are common in large, dusty deserts.\nAnimals and plants.\nThere are not many animals in the desert, but some animals are able to survive. They have different ways to survive the intense conditions of the desert. Examples of animals that live in hot deserts are lizards, small rodents, snakes, and camels. Plants and animals in hot deserts must live with very little water. \nXerophytic plants which live in the desert have special adaptations. They may survive by growing roots that are very near the surface to absorb the rain that may fall before it evaporates. Plants such as the cactus have thick, fleshy stems that help them store water.\nSmall animals such as lizards and small rodents often escape the hot rays by digging underground burrows where they live. They only come out at night to search for food. Like the plants, desert animals must live on as little water as possible. Most of the water used by these animals comes from seeds and stems that absorb and hold water. Camels survive in hot deserts by storing water in body fat in their humps. Like other desert animals, the camel loses little water in its wastes (urine and feces)."}

Some desserts are served with whipped cream as a topping.\nThe term \"dessert\" can apply to many confections, such as biscuits, cakes, cookies, custards, gelatin's, ice creams, pastries, pies, puddings, sweet soups, and tarts. Fruit is also commonly found in dessert courses because of its naturally occurring sweetness. Some cultures sweeten foods that are more commonly savoury to create desserts.\nTypes of desserts.\nBaked desserts.\nBaked desserts are made by putting the ingredients in a hot oven. Baked desserts include cakes and muffins (a mixture of flour, eggs, sugar, oil, baking powder, and flavorings); sweet breads such as banana bread and raisin bread (a mixture of flour, sugar, oil, baking powder, and flavorings); cookies such as chocolate chip cookies (a mixture of flour, eggs, sugar, oil, and flavorings). Puddings and custards (a mixture of milk, eggs, sugar, and flavorings) can be made in the oven. \nFried desserts.\nFried desserts are made using a cooking process called deep frying. To deep-fry food, a large pot filled with oil is heated, and then the food is placed into the pot. Deep-fried desserts include doughnuts.\nFrozen desserts.\nFrozen desserts are made by blending the ingredients in a freezer. Frozen desserts include ice cream (a mixture of cream, milk, sugar, and flavorings), milk shakes (a mixture of ice cream, milk, and flavorings), and sherbet (also spelled \"sorbet\") (a mixture of water, sugar, and flavorings).\nChilled desserts.\nSome desserts are made without using the oven or the freezer. Trifle is an English dessert made by soaking ladyfinger biscuits in sherry, covering them with whipped cream, and then letting it chill in the refrigerator. Some types of instant pudding and instant mousse desserts can be made without cooking; a person simply mixes the instant pudding powder with milk and chills it in the refrigerator."}

It is a kind of gun dog. Labrador Retrievers are very gentle dogs with family-friendly personalities. They are the most popular breed of dogs for pets in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. They enjoy attention and exercise with their owner. They love to run around in big, open spaces, have a natural love of bringing things back, and learn to retrieve easily. They love to be active. They like the water no matter what temperature outside as their coat protects them. They are strong swimmers as they have webbing between the toes on their paws. They have coats that can be in any of three colors: black, yellow, and brown.\nThis tough, hardy breed of retriever is a great choice as a family pet. They are playful, easy to train, and naturally obedient. Labrador Retrievers do require regular amounts of daily exercise and are prone to obesity. As a pet, they can be demanding of attention and are best suited in a home where they can have a daily workout. They like water and have a unique otter-like tail, which they use like a rudder when they swim.\nHistory.\nLabradors are descended from dogs bred on the island of Newfoundland, in Canada. Its ancestor is the St. John's water dog, a breed that developed through breedings by early settlers of the island in the 16th century. These dogs were trained to bring in the fishing nets from the icy waters for the fishermen. In the early 19th century, they were brought to Poole in Great Britain. These dogs had short strong legs and were good swimmers. Their coats were thick and they had a broad tail. Englishmen had many offers to buy them from fishermen because they were so attractive. The breed was instantly successful as a gun dog. The Earl of Malmesbury was interested and amazed by these dogs, and he started breeding them. He bred them for duck shooting on his estate. He established the new breed of retrievers, which he named Labrador.\nIn 1903, the Labrador Retriever was recognized by the English Kennel Club (EKC). Then, a year later, was listed as a dog in the Gundog group. At this point, retrievers were not divided by breed (until 1905, when it was listed separately). \nEngland's Royal Family has long been popular with the Labrador, as King George VI and Queen Elizabeth II promoted them throughout their kennel.\nCountess Howe is believed to be the first person to bring Labradors to the United States, shortly before World War One.\nTo say, however, that the Labrador was popular immediately would be wrong. It was only recognized in 1917 by the AKC, and strangely, ten years later, there were only roughly 24 Labradors in the United States. They were still classed as \"Retrievers\" until the late 1920s. The first Labrador registered, was a black female.\nAt this point, only upper class people owned them. However, lots of the upper class enjoyed these dogs, and they would try to import them from the finest English kennels. It's important to see, that they were only imported for one reason, though. \nThe first Labrador Retriever club was formed in 1931 in New York City, and the first field trial was held in December of that year.\nUnfortunately, during the Second World War, as with most dog breeds, numbers decreased. But, after 1945, they gained a strong popularity boost. Imports from the British kennel clubs, as earlier said, increased, and then after a while, their numbers began rising again. That is why, most of the British Labrador population, has roots in the United States.\nTemperament.\nLabrador retrievers are gentle and loving. They make great family dogs. They are intelligent, agile, and kind dogs. They also are very energetic, and need exercise every day.\nLabradors are very social, and therefore, are easy to train. They are happy to play in any activity you want to do with them, but the outgoing side of the Labrador does have a flip side. They crave attention, and, if not given it, can resort to destructive behaviour.\nFortunately, they are not only social but very versatile. The breed's generally sunny temperament, love of people, and willingness to learn make them star performers in many disciplines, e.g. therapy, guide dogs.\nAppearance.\nLabrador retrievers come in black, yellow, and chocolate. Labradors have a short, dense coat, powerful jaws, a broad, steady back and friendly brown eyes. Labradors usually live from 10-12 years.\nHealth.\nLabradors usually die from cancer, and have issues with Hip Dysplasia, Laryngeal Paralysis, Arthritis Hypothyroidism, Elbow Dysplasia, and seizures.\nActivities.\nLabradors are energetic, so they would love to play fetch, swim, go on walks, do obedience trials, and agility tests."}

She served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (UK) from 1979 until her resignation in 1990, longer than any other British prime minister in the 20th century. She led the UK's Conservative Party from 1975 to 1990. Thatcher was the first female British prime minister and was often known by the nickname \"The Iron Lady\", given to her by a journalist from the Soviet Union. Her birth name was Margaret Hilda Roberts.\nThatcher studied chemistry at Somerville College, Oxford, and worked briefly as a research chemist, before becoming a barrister. She was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for Finchley in 1959. Edward Heath made her a Secretary of State in his government of 1970 to 1974. In 1975, she beat Heath in the Conservative Party leadership election to become Leader of the Opposition and the first woman to lead a major British political party. In 1979, she was elected Prime Minister, and won a landslide re-election in 1983 after victory in the 1982 Falklands War and the recovering economy brought a revival of support.\nThatcher was re-elected for a third term with another landslide in 1987, but her following support for the Community Charge (\"poll tax\") was very unpopular, and her more Eurosceptic views on the European Community were not shared by others in her Cabinet. She resigned as Prime Minister and party leader in November 1990, after a challenge was made by Michael Heseltine to her leadership. After retiring from the House of Commons in 1992, she was given a life peerage as Baroness Thatcher, which gave her the right to sit in the House of Lords. In 2013, she died of a stroke in London, at the age of 87.\nThatcher is a controversial figure in British political culture, but is still viewed positively in most opinion polls of British prime ministers. The debate over her neoliberal policies and legacy continues in the UK into the 21st century.\nEarly life.\nMargaret Roberts was born in Grantham, Lincolnshire, on 13 October 1925. Her father was Alfred Roberts, a tobacconist originally from Northamptonshire. Her mother was Beatrice Ethel Stephenson, from Lincolnshire.\nThatcher studied chemistry at Somerville College, Oxford. In her final year, she studied X-ray crystallography under Dorothy Hodgkin, who later won the Nobel Prize. She was already interested in politics, and became President of the Oxford University Conservative Association in 1946. Roberts read political works such as Friedrich von Hayek's \"The Road to Serfdom\" (1944), which said economic intervention by government was wrong, because it gave too much power to the state. After graduating, Roberts moved to Colchester in Essex to work as a research chemist for BX Plastics.\nShe was elected an MP in 1959. She became Education Secretary in 1970.\nAs Prime Minister.\nThatcher directed British troops in 1982 to get back the Falkland Islands from Argentina. Argentina had taken the Falklands for a short time during the Falklands War. She had the second longest single prime ministerial term in history. She married Denis Thatcher; they had twins: son Mark and daughter Carol.\nShe suffered from strong opposition during a coal miner's strike in 1984 and 1985. The strike took away political power from the miners' union. There was also controversy when she introduced a poll tax to Britain. This caused rioting across the country.\nShe was forced to resign by her own party in 1990. She was replaced by John Major. In 1992, she stood down as PM. She then joined the House of Lords. From then on, she was known as \"Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven\".\nDuring Thatcher's years as prime minister, unemployment rose a lot. It doubled during her first term. In 1982, 3\u00a0million people were unemployed. Unemployment started to decline again only in the mid- to late-1980s. Since the mid-1990s, Britain has consistently had lower unemployment than most of continental Europe. Thatcher's supporters claim this is the result of her reform of the labour market. This is disputed by her opponents.\nShe was the subject of an assassination attempt when the Grand Brighton Hotel was bombed by the Provisional Irish Republican Army in October 1984.\nDuring the near end of the Cold War, Thatcher became one of the closest friends of Ronald Reagan, the 40th President of the United States.\nShe is remembered in the UK for reducing the trade union movement's power. Trade unions were much more powerful in the 1970s. Thatcher did much to reduce their influence on British industry.\nThatcher was the first woman to be Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. She was also the first woman to be Conservative Party leader.\nPersonal life.\nIn February 1949, she met Denis Thatcher. They met at a Paint Trades Federation event in Dartford. They married on 13 December 1951, at a chapel in City Road, London; the Robertses, Margaret's parents, were Methodists. Margaret and Denis had twin children, Carol and Mark, who were born on 15 August 1953, six weeks prematurely by Caesarean section.\nLater life.\nHer husband Denis died in 2003 from pancreatic cancer. She attended Ronald Reagan's funeral service in 2004. In the later years of her life, she suffered from dementia and withdrew from public engagements in 2002. In 2006, Thatcher attended the official Washington memorial service to mark the fifth anniversary of the September 11 attacks on the United States (US). She was a guest of Vice President Dick Cheney, and met Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice during her visit. She would also visit several times for ceremonies that honoured Reagan.\nDeath.\nThatcher died from a stroke on 8 April 2013 at her hotel room in London, aged 87. She had bladder cancer and dementia at the time of her death. In line with her wishes she received a ceremonial funeral, with full military honours, and a church service at St Paul's Cathedral on 17 April. Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Phillip attended the funeral, only the second time in the Queen's reign that she had attended the funeral of a former prime minister."}

Besides fighting fires, firefighters rescue people and animals from vehicle accidents, collapsed buildings, hazardous atmospheres, entrapment, disabled elevators and many other types of emergencies. Firefighters also typically respond to HazMat incidents as well. Firefighting is a job which requires bravery, strength, quick thinking, level-headediness, and a wide range of skills.\nFirefighters are based at and respond from a building called a \"fire station\" (also known as a \"firehouse\" or \"fire hall\"). When a call comes in and their help is needed, they drive a vehicle called a \"fire engine\" or \"fire truck,\" which is also referred to as a fire apparatus, to the incident scene. These vehicles are appropriately equipped for the emergencies they respond to and typically can pump water and foam to put out fires. Fire engines also carry ladders, cutting tools and lots of different types of rescue equipment. Most carry first aid kits to help people who are injured or hurt. Another type of common fire apparatus, known as a \u201cladder truck\u201d, is fitted with some variation of an articulating and telescoping ladder assembly which can be strategically positioned to give firefighters another means of access to an incident scene, as well as another means of egress for distressed victims or firefighters. \nFirefighters wear heavy clothing to protect them from the heat when they are fighting a fire. This is called \"bunker gear\" or \"turnout gear\". They wear a self-contained breathing apparatus and mask to protect themselves from breathing in smoke and super hot air and gasses. \nFire departments.\nDepending on the country, the agency firefighters work for is called a \"fire department\", \"fire service\", \"fire and rescue service\" or \"fire brigade\". Fire departments are usually government agencies that are funded by taxes and look after a local area. Some sites employ their own firefighters, such as airports and some factories.\nSome fire departments employ firefighters who work full-time and wait at the fire station to be called out. They have to work both in the daytime and at night, though they can usually have a rest if they have nothing to do at night. Villages and small towns usually have part-time firefighters who have other jobs outside of the fire service. These firefighters will drive from their home or workplace to the fire station when their help is needed. They may be volunteers, or they may be paid for doing this (known as \"retained firefighters\" in the UK).\nIn some places such as large US cities, it is common for the fire department to run the emergency medical services. In those departments, such as the New York City Fire Department, most of the fire department's calls are medical emergencies rather than fires. Although these are usually dealt with by full-time paramedics, many firefighters are trained in first aid and they may assist in medical emergencies, even bringing the fire engine to the scene."}

Something that is chosen at random is not chosen for any conscious reason, and therefore thought to be purely by chance. An example of a random event is winning a lottery.\nA computer can make lists of apparently random numbers. Humans are unable to do this, because the brain works in patterns. If someone is asked to keep saying \"heads\" or \"tails\" at random, a smart human observer or properly programmed computer might eventually be able to tell which one the person is likely to say next because the computer notices the patterns.\nOn a website such as English Wikipedia the user can click on \"Random page\" to get a random article. The chances of any one page appearing are exactly the same as for any other page.\nSometimes the word \"random\" is used more loosely. There are websites of random jokes, which just means: a variety of jokes about all sorts of things.\nIn recent years young people have started to use the word \"random\" even more loosely to describe anything which is rather strange or has no logic. Sentences such as \"the mouldy cheese is escaping\" or \"I like pie and spam\" might be described as \"random\", although this is not the proper dictionary or mathematical meaning of the word.\nMaking random numbers.\nThere are several ways in which a process or system can be seen as \"random\":\nThere are many uses for random numbers. The need has led to methods for generating data which is more or less random (pseudorandom). These methods vary as to how unpredictable (statistically random) they are, and how quickly they can generate random numbers.\nThere are computational random number generators, generating large amounts of sufficiently random numbers. Before then, tables were published as pseudo-random number tables.\nThere are two ways computers can make what appear to be random numbers.\nIn cryptography.\nKeys for encryption must be random in order to be secure. Key generation by a faulty random number generator has sometimes led to successful cryptanalysis."}

There are two countries in the world that call themselves China. The People's Republic of China (PRC) is the country most people think of when they hear the name China. The Republic of China (ROC) also calls itself China. It is better known in most of the world as Taiwan.\nTaiwan was a part of China from the late 1600s. After the First Sino-Japanese War, Taiwan and Penghu were given to Japan by China. After World War II, the Japanese on Taiwan surrendered to the Chinese. This gave Taiwan back to the Chinese. After losing a civil war in 1949, the ROC government fled to the island of Taiwan. It took control of Taiwan and several nearby islands. The PRC controlled mainland China. It also said it owns the island of Taiwan (which is also known as Taiwan province) and the other islands. The ROC said that it was the rightful government of China and it included all of China, including Taiwan and Mongolia. In 1971, the ROC lost its United Nations seat as China. The seat was given to the PRC instead. This made the PRC the rightful government of China internationally. Most countries have accepted the PRC as the leaders of China. Several countries, including the United States, have been careful to not say officially which parts of the original China are part of the PRC. 23 countries have official diplomatic relations with Taiwan. Nearly all of the other countries still have some diplomatic relations with them. The major problems are about whether Taiwan is a part of the PRC or should be an independent country.\nCurrent status.\nPeople who live in Taiwan have different ideas, and it is difficult to find out what most people believe because small changes in how polls are worded can change the results a lot. Taiwan has not been ruled by mainland China since 1895. Today, Taiwan is a democracy. China is ruled by a communist government. The idea of freedom in communism is different than how people in a democracy think freedom should be. Few people in Taiwan want to become part of Communist China. Almost none want to give up their idea of freedom. Some people in Taiwan want Taiwan to formally become the Republic of Taiwan, an independent country. Most of the people in Taiwan want to keep everything like it is now. They want to wait for the best time to become the Republic of Taiwan.\nViews by other countries.\nToday, most countries of the world see the PRC as China. Most countries however still have a very close economic and cultural relationship with Taiwan, even if they have major tensions with the PRC. \nProblems.\nThe relations between the PRC and Taiwan are tense. The PRC believes that Taiwan is a part of the PRC. The government of the PRC has said that if the people of Taiwan vote to become the Republic of Taiwan, that they will invade Taiwan and stop this from happening. In March of 2004, they passed a law that will allow China to invade Taiwan if Taiwan tries to leave the PRC and become an independent country. This law has caused problems with the people in Taiwan. It has caused even more people in Taiwan not to want to be a part of PRC China."}

Cellular respiration takes in food and uses it to create ATP, a chemical which the cell uses for energy. \nUsually, this process uses oxygen, and is called aerobic respiration. It has four stages known as glycolysis, Link reaction, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain. This produces ATP which supplies the energy that cells need to do work.\nWhen they do not get enough oxygen, the cells use anaerobic respiration, which does not use oxygen. However, this process produces lactic acid, and is not as efficient as when oxygen is used. \nAerobic respiration, the process that does use oxygen, produces much more energy and does not produce lactic acid. It also produces carbon dioxide as a waste product, which then enters the circulatory system. The carbon dioxide is taken to the lungs, where it is exchanged for oxygen.\nThe simplified formula for aerobic cellular respiration is: \nC6H12O6 + 6O2 \u2192 6CO2 + 6H2O + Energy (as ATP)\nThe word equation for this is:Glucose (sugar) + Oxygen \u2192 Carbon dioxide + Water + Energy (as ATP)\nAerobic cellular respiration has four stages. Each is important, and could not happen without the one before it. The steps of aerobic cellular respiration are:\nGlycolysis.\nIn glycolysis, glucose in the cytoplasm is broken into two molecules of pyruvate. Ten enzymes are needed for the ten intermediate compounds in this process.\nProductivity of the cycle.\nBiology textbooks often state that 38 ATP molecules can be made per oxidised glucose molecule during cellular respiration (two from glycolysis, two from the Krebs cycle, and about 34 from the electron transport chain). However, the process actually makes less energy (ATP) because of losses through leaky membranes. Estimates are 29 to 30 ATP per glucose.\nAerobic metabolism is about (see sentence above) 15 times more efficient than anaerobic metabolism. Anaerobic metabolism yields 2\u00a0mol ATP per 1\u00a0mol glucose. They share the initial pathway of glycolysis but aerobic metabolism continues with the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. The post glycolytic reactions take place in the mitochondria in eukaryotic cells, and in the cytoplasm in prokaryotic cells.\nLink reaction.\nPyruvate from glycolysis is actively pumped into mitochondria. One carbon dioxide molecule and one hydrogen molecule are removed from the pyruvate (called oxidative decarboxylation) to produce an acetyl group, which joins to an enzyme called CoA to form acetyl CoA. This is essential for the Krebs cycle.\nKrebs cycle.\nAcetyl CoA joins with oxaloacetate to form a compound with six carbon atoms. This is the first step in the ever-repeating Krebs cycle. Because two acetyl-CoA molecules are produced from each glucose molecule, \"two cycles are required per glucose molecule\". Therefore, at the end of two cycles, the products are: two ATP, six NADH, two FADH, and four CO2. The ATP is a molecule which carries energy in chemical form to be used in other cell processes. This process is also known as the TCA cycle (Tricarboxylic (try-car-box-ILL-ick) acid cycle), the citric acid cycle, or the Krebs cycle after the biochemist who elucidated its reactions.\nElectron transport chain (ETC).\nThis is where most of the ATP is made. All of the hydrogen molecules which have been removed in the steps before (Krebs cycle, Link reaction) are pumped inside the mitochondria using energy that electrons release. Eventually, the electrons powering the pumping of hydrogen into the mitochondria mix with some hydrogen and oxygen to form water and the hydrogen molecules stop being pumped.\nEventually, the hydrogen flows back into the cytoplasm of the mitochondria through protein channels. As the hydrogen flows, ATP is made from ADP and phosphate ions."}

This type of country is called \"landlocked\", meaning it is surrounded by land. All of Lesotho's trade must either be flown in by aeroplane, or brought in by land. Lesotho's position is unusual: it is completely surrounded by South Africa and has no borders with any other country. This type of country is called an \"enclave\". Lesotho is one of the only three enclaved countries in the world (the other two are San Marino and the Vatican City). This makes Lesotho's relationship with South Africa very important to them both.\nLesotho has many mountains and is one of the most mountainous countries in the world. All of Lesotho is at least 1,400 m above sea level. People sometimes travel there to ski in winter. The many mountains in Lesotho mean that it rains there a lot. Lesotho uses some of its water to generate electricity and sells some of the water to South Africa.\nHistory.\nLesotho became a country in 1818, but it was then called Basutoland. A man called Moshoeshoe brought several of the groups of people in the area together and formed a new country with him as its king. This new country came under attack from its enemies and in 1868 Moshoeshoe asked Queen Victoria of Great Britain for help. Great Britain said it would help if Lesotho became part of the British Empire.\nLesotho eventually gained its independence on 4 October 1966. Now it is a member of the British Commonwealth. King Letsie III is the ruler of Lesotho."}

He was one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. Hamilton was the United States' first Secretary of the Treasury. He was known for the creation of a national bank. Born on the island of Nevis in the Caribbean, Hamilton moved to New York City. When the American Revolutionary War started, Hamilton served in the Continental Army. He was a close aide to General George Washington. After leaving the military he started a bank. He was one of the framers of the United States Constitution. Along with James Madison and John Jay, he wrote the Federalist Papers, which supported the new Constitution.\nHamilton became the Secretary of the Treasury under George Washington. He helped set up the United States' financial system. Hamilton supported a national bank as well as the funding of the national debt. A leader of the Federalist Party, he was a long time rival of Thomas Jefferson. He was killed in a duel with political rival Aaron Burr ,who was one of his first friends, in 1804.\nToday, Hamilton is usually thought of as one of the most important of the early leaders. Hamilton's portrait appears on the United States ten-dollar bill.\nEarly life.\nHamilton was not born in the United States. He was from the Caribbean island of Nevis. His father was James Hamilton and his mother was Rachel Fawcett Lavien. Hamilton's mother had a child from a previous marriage that she left behind when she moved to Nevis. At the time, she was still married to another man. This meant that Hamilton was illegitimate. He was very sensitive about this fact. His father had left him as a child. Two years after this tragedy both Hamilton and his mother became sick. Hamilton recovered, but unfortunately his mother died. He was grief-stricken and moved in with his cousin. His cousin committed suicide.\nIn 1772 Hamilton went to New York to continue his education. He attended Kings College, now called Columbia University, until 1776.\nCareer.\nEarly in the American Revolution Hamilton was an artillery officer. Later he served on George Washington's staff. Hamilton believed by the late 1780s that the Articles of Confederation made a government that was too weak to work well, and he supported drafting a new document. He was a delegate to the Constitutional Convention, and he was a signer of the Constitution. In 1789 he was co-author of the Federalist Papers, a series of letters written by Hamilton, John Jay, and James Madison under the name \"Publius.\" Hamilton wrote about two-thirds of the essays. They were published in newspapers in New York and supported the new Constitution. These writings are usually thought of as being one of the most important American works on politics and government. They are still widely read today.\nGeorge Washington, who became President in 1789, chose Hamilton to be the first United States Secretary of the Treasury. While in this job, he supported a national bank and invented a way to pay the debt that the country owed for the Revolutionary War. He helped start the Federalist Party. John Adams was a member, and Washington supported the party though he was not a member. After being Secretary of the Treasury he worked as a lawyer and continued to lead the Federalist Party.\nHamilton said he was very anti-slavery. Along with John Jay he was a leader of the New York Manumission Society. The society worked to end slavery in New York by getting slave owners to choose to free their slaves. However, he bought and sold slaves for himself, his family, and his friends.\nHamilton also had great respect for the small Jewish community in America and was a major supporter of religious freedom.\nIn 1800 Hamilton's political rival Thomas Jefferson beat the Federalist John Adams. Jefferson and Hamilton had very different ideas about the direction the new country should take, although both were important founding fathers.\nGunning and death.\nHamilton had a long-time rivalry with Jefferson's vice president Aaron Burr. This resulted in the Burr\u2013Hamilton duel of 1804 in which Burr killed Hamilton. Hamilton kept Burr from being re-nominated for Vice President. He also kept him from becoming Governor of New York. Burr responded by challenging Hamilton to a duel. They agreed to meet July 11, 1804 at Weehawken, New Jersey. Dueling was illegal in New York which is why they chose Weehawken. It was also the site where Philip Hamilton, Alexander Hamilton's son, had been killed in a duel three years earlier. The night before the duel, Hamilton wrote his will, letters to friends, and finally a letter to his wife. At dawn the next morning the two met at Weehawken. Without any discussion, the two men took their positions. Unusual for a duel of this kind, the two fired about 4\u20135 seconds apart. Who fired first is not known today. Burr's bullet struck Hamilton and knocked him down. Then Burr promptly turned and left. The bullet went through Hamilton's ribs, and damaged his lungs and liver. Hamilton was taken to a friend's house in Manhattan where his wife and children joined him. He asked two ministers to give him Communion but was refused. Finally the Episcopal Bishop Benjamin Moore gave him the sacrament. Hamilton died the next morning.\nLegacy.\nHamilton is shown on the face of the U.S. 10-dollar bill. Hamilton is one of only two non-presidents honored on commonly used notes. Some of Hamilton's words are still quoted. For example,\n\"I never expect a perfect work from imperfect man.\" -The Federalist #25\nHamilton was the founder of the United States Revenue Cutter Service, which in 1915 became the United States Coast Guard. For that reason, he is considered the father of the United States Coast Guard. He was a staunch constitutionalist who, unlike several of the founding fathers, believed in a strong central government. During his life he was involved in nearly every major political event from the Revolution to the election of 1800. His writings fill a staggering 27 volumes. Yet he is probably the least well understood of any of the founding fathers. By the time of Hamilton's death, the Federalist Party he had helped start was in decline. Hamilton and the Federalists had convinced Washington to create a central bank, assume the debts of the states and pass tax laws. There is little doubt these moves helped save the new democracy.\nHamilton is the subject of the 2015 Broadway Musical, \"Hamilton\". It was written by and stars Lin-Manuel Miranda in the title role."}

It is equipped with three operators: conjunction (AND), disjunction (OR) and negation (NOT). It uses normal math symbols, but it does not work in the same way. It is named for George Boole, who invented it in the middle 19th century. Boolean algebra did not get much attention except from mathematicians until the 20th century when engineers began using it for logic gates.\nNOT gate.\nThe NOT operator is written with a bar over numbers or letters like this:\nIt means that the output is \"not\" the input.\nAND gate.\nThe AND operator is written as formula_4 like this:\nThe output is true if and only if one and the other input is true.\nOR gate.\nThe OR operator is written as formula_9 like this:\nIf one or the other input is true, then the output to be true (and false otherwise).\nXOR gate.\nXOR basically means \"exclusive or\", meaning one input or the other must be true, but not both. It is also sometimes called NOR, which means the same thing.\nThe XOR operator is written as formula_14 like this:\nIn other words, the XOR operator returns true precisely when one or the other input is true\u2014but not both.\nIdentities.\nDifferent gates can be put together in different orders:\nIt is not the same as a NOT then an AND: formula_20\nwhich is called \"XOR identity table\"\n, if\nformula_23.\nor if formula_24=TRUE, TRUE.,\nDe Morgan's laws.\nAugustus De Morgan discovered that it is possible to preserve the truth values of Boolean expressions by changing a formula_9 sign to a formula_4 sign, while making or breaking a bar.

{"id": "14604", "revid": "470168", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14604", "title": "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone", "text": "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (published in the US under the title \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\") is the first book in the Harry Potter series, written by J.K. Rowling. It was published in 1997 and a movie version was shown in theaters in 2001. \nPlot Summarization.\nThis is the first book in a series of seven about the wizard Harry Potter, and therefore the author begins by setting the scene and introducing the reader to some of the characters.\nAt the start, Rowling describes how in an ordinary suburb, somewhere in an English town, people are suddenly surprised to see witches and wizards in odd clothing riding on public buses and appearing at places where people would not expect to suddenly meet a wizard. It is clear that something unusual has happened in the world of witches and wizards, and those people, who are normally quite secret, are out and about, enjoying themselves.\nIn this way, Rowling introduces the two worlds of her story, the world of ordinary people, called \"Muggles\", and the secret world of the magic folk who usually keep to themselves. Rowling then introduces the main character, Harry Potter, a little baby boy who is left on the doorstep of his aunt and uncle by an old wizard with a long white beard.\nWhen the reader next meets Harry, he has grown to be a boy of eleven, living unhappily with his spiteful aunt, cruel uncle and bullying cousin Dudley. He is rescued from his misery by a huge bearded man upon his eleventh birthday. Harry Potter is a wizard without knowing it, and the giant man, Rubeus Hagrid, has come to help him buy his books and get ready to go to school. The school sounds most exciting. It is \"Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry\".\nOn the long train journey north, Harry Potter meets the two people who are to become his best friends, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger. Ron and Hermione have very different characters. Hermione, who comes from \"Muggle\" (nonwizard) parents, is very intelligent and talented. She is such a know-it-all and so bossy that the boys do not like her at first. Ron, on the other hand, comes from an old family of wizards. He is number six in a family of seven children. He wears hand-me-down clothes and even his pet rat used to belong to his brother Percy. Ron knows all about Harry Potter.\nThe reason that Ron, and all the other people in the wizarding world, know all about Harry Potter is that Harry is famous, without even knowing it himself. The reason why he was left on the doorstep of his aunt and uncle is that both his parents are dead. They were murdered by an evil wizard who calls himself \"Lord Voldemort\". He is so evil that people are even afraid to say his name. Harry is famous because he survived the magical attack of the \"He who must not be named\", and since that day, Voldemort has gone into hiding.\nJoanne Rowling then gives the reader a picture of the school that is to be Harry's home through seven books of the series, each one of which deals with a year in his life. The book describes the teachers, the lessons, the customs and the school sport so that it seems to be part of a real world. Even though the students learn magic and use magic, the book also describes Harry's growing up in a new and strange situation, just as any student must learn to fit in when they go to a new school among different people.\nHarry soon discovers that while some magicians, such as the school principal Headmaster Professor Albus Dumbledore, and Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagal can be kind and encouraging, others, like the sinister Professor Snape with his greasy black hair and nasty comments, are very hard to trust. One of the subjects that Harry really needs to learn is \"Defense against the Dark Arts\" but unfortunately, the teacher, Professor Quirrell, is such a bumbling and nervous man that he does not seem to be able to teach Harry very much at all.\nAs the year goes by, Harry discovers that Hogwarts has, hidden away for safety, a very precious treasure. If it were to fall into the hands of Lord Voldemort, it would be very dangerous indeed. Harry also discovers that in solving problems and overcoming difficulties, having friends with very different talents can be extremely useful.\nMovie: \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\".\nThe movie was made by Warner Brothers. It was based closely on the book. In the United States, it was called \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\". Harry Potter was played by Daniel Radcliffe. Rupert Grint played Ron Weasley, and Emma Watson played Hermione Granger."}

Timberlake first became famous when he appeared in the television series \"Mickey Mouse Club.\" He later became of part of the Grammy Award-winning boy band *NSYNC. He started his own career as a solo musician in 2002. He has recorded five studio albums, such as: Justified, FutureSex/LoveSounds,The 20/20 Experience,The 20/20 Experience \u2013 2 of 2 and Man of the Woods.\nEarly life.\nTimberlake was born at St Jude's Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, to Randall Timberlake and Lynn Harless (n\u00e9e Bomar). Timberlake's ancestors were English, Irish, Scottish, Welsh, Dutch, French, German, and Jersey (Channel Islander). He was raised in the Baptist religion. His parents divorced in 1985. He grew up in Millington, Tennessee, a small town north of Memphis.\nIn 1993, Timberlake joined \"The Mickey Mouse Club\". The show ended in 1994. In 1995 Timberlake was recruited for an all-male singing group organized by orlando based singer Chris Kirkpatrick and funded by boy band manager Lou Pearlman that eventually became 'N Sync. \nMusic career.\n1995\u20132002: 'N Sync.\nTimberlake and JC Chasez were the two lead singers of the popular 1990s boy band 'N Sync. The group formed in 1995. Their first public performance happened the 22nd of October 1995 at Disney World's Pleasure Island. They started their career in 1996 in Europe, and hit it big in the United States in 1998 with the US release of their self-titled debut album \"*NSYNC\", which to date has sold over 14.8 million equivalent album sales. \nTheir album included a number of hit singles such as \"Tearin' Up My Heart.\" For the next two years, encouraged by similar developments with the Backstreet Boys, 'N Sync engaged in a lengthy legal battle with manager Lou Pearlman. \nEventually the band signed with Jive Records. 'N Sync released a long-awaited album, \"No Strings Attached \"in March 2000, which became the fastest-selling album of all time at that time with 2.4 million copies sold in its first week and produced a #1 single, \"\"It's Gonna Be Me\". \" That record has since only been broken by Adele's 25 released in 2015. The release was followed by the band's third album, \"Celebrity\"\", \"which holds the title of the third-fastest selling album of all time with 1.8 million. In 2002, after the completion of the Celebrity Tour and the release of\" \"Girlfriend,\" \"the third single from Celebrity, the group decided to take time off, at which point Timberlake began work on his first solo album and the group went into a hiatus. In its lifetime, 'N Sync was internationally famous and performed at the Academy Awards, the Olympics, and the Super Bowl, as well as selling more than 44 million equivalent album sales worldwide.\nDuring late 1999, Timberlake made his acting debut in the Disney Channel original movie \"Model Behavior\", in which he played Jason Sharpe, a model who falls in love with a waitress after mistaking her for another model. It was released on March 12, 2000.\nAs a member of 'N Sync, Timberlake developed into a major celebrity in his own right in addition to achieving respect as a musician, since he was the writer or co-writer of all three singles from \"Celebrity\". The rise of his own stardom and the general decline in the popularity of boy bands led to a continuation of 'N Sync's hiatus, although the group has never officially disbanded. \nBand member Lance Bass who was trying to go into space during the group's hiatus, has stated that he believes the group is finished, and is openly critical of Timberlake's actions in his memoir \"Out of Sync\". On the other hand, Chris Kirkpatrick remarked in August 2008 that the five remain friends, and he believed a reunion was possible: he repeated that opinion in October 2009. In September 2008, Bass also made conciliatory comments. \nThe group would briefly reunite at the 2013 MTV Video Musixc Awards when Timberlake received the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award and at the 2019 Coachella Festival this time sans Timberlake who was finishing his 115-show Man of the Woods Tour. \nGroup member JC Chasez would later reveal during an interview with Lance Bass on March, 2020 that he discussed the possible performance with Timberlake over the phone and was given a positive response, stating Timberlake urged the group to perform without him and recounting that \"Ariana (Grande) can sing my parts\".\n2002\u201304: \"Justified\" and Super Bowl XXXVIII Controversy.\nIn August 2002, after months of recording \"Justified\", his debut solo album, Timberlake performed at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards, where he premiered his first single, \"\"Like I Love You\",\" a sparse dance track produced by The Neptunes. The song reached number eleven on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Following the single, Timberlake released \"Justified\" on November 5, 2002. It debuted at number two on the \"Billboard\" 200 album chart, selling 439,000 copies in its first week of release. It eventually went on to sell more than three million copies in the U.S. and more than seven million copies worldwide. The album also received critical acclaim, thanks to its heavy R&amp;B influence provided by hip-hop producers The Neptunes and Timbaland. It spun off hits throughout late 2002 and 2003, including the top ten singles \"\"Cry Me a River\" and \"Rock Your Body\".\" Timberlake supported the album by co-headlining the Justified/Stripped Tour with Christina Aguilera in the summer of 2003. At the end of the year, Timberlake recorded a song entitled \"I'm Lovin' It.\" It was used by McDonald's as the theme to its \"I'm Lovin' It\" campaign. The deal with McDonald's earned Timberlake an estimated $6 million. A tour entitled Justified and Lovin' It Live was included with the deal as well. Timberlake was featured on Nelly's song, \"Work It\", which was remixed and included on Nelly's 2003 remix album.\nIn February 2004, during the halftime show of the Super Bowl XXXVIII broadcast on the CBS television network, Timberlake performed with Janet Jackson before a television audience of more than 140 million viewers. At the end of the performance, as the song drew to a close, Timberlake tore off a part of Jackson's black leather costume in a \"costume reveal\" meant to accompany a portion of the song lyrics. According to CBS, \"both Jackson and Timberlake had confirmed they planned it 'independently and clandestinely' without informing anyone.\" Part of the costume detached, and Jackson's breast was briefly exposed. Timberlake later apologized for the incident, stating he was \"sorry that anyone was offended by the wardrobe malfunction during the halftime performance of the Super Bowl...\" The phrase \"wardrobe malfunction\" has since been used by the media to refer to the incident and has entered pop culture. As a result of the controversy, Timberlake and Jackson were threatened with exclusion from the 2004 Grammy Awards unless they agreed to apologize on screen at the event. Timberlake attended and issued a scripted apology when accepting the first of two Grammy Awards he received that night (Best Pop Vocal Album for \"Justified\" and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for \"Cry Me a River\"). He had also been nominated for Album of the Year for \"Justified\", Record of the Year for \"Cry Me a River\", and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for \"Where Is the Love?\" with The Black Eyed Peas.\n2004\u201306: Collaborations and acting.\nAfter the Super Bowl controversy, Timberlake put his recording career on hold to act in several movies, having starred in a few feature movies earlier in his music career. The first role he took during this time was as a journalist in the thriller \"Edison Force\", which was filmed in 2004 and received a direct-to-video release on July 18, 2006. He also appeared in the movies \"Alpha Dog\", \"Black Snake Moan\", Richard Kelly's \"Southland Tales\", and voiced Prince Artie Pendragon in the animated movie \"Shrek the Third\", released on May 18, 2007. He also appeared as a young Elton John, in the video for John's song \"This Train Don't Stop There Anymore\". Timberlake was considered to play the role of Roger Davis in the movie version of the rock musical \"Rent\", but director Chris Columbus had insisted that only the original Broadway members could convey the true meaning of \"Rent\".\nHe continued to record with other artists. After \"Where Is the Love?\", he again collaborated with the Black Eyed Peas on the 2005 track \"My Style\" from their album \"Monkey Business\". When recording the 2005 single \"Signs\" with Snoop Dogg, Timberlake discovered a throat condition. Nodules were subsequently removed from his throat in an operation that took place on May 5, 2005. He was advised not to sing or speak loudly for at least a few months. In the summer of 2005, Timberlake started his own record company, JayTee records.\nTimberlake made a cameo in the video for Nelly Furtado and Timbaland's single \"Promiscuous\", released on May 3, 2006.\n2006\u201307: \"FutureSex/LoveSounds\".\nTimberlake released his second solo album, \"FutureSex/LoveSounds\", on September 12, 2006. The album, which Timberlake created in 2005, debuted at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200 album chart, selling 684,000 copies its first week. It is the biggest album for pre-orders on iTunes, and beat Coldplay's record for the biggest one-week sales of a digital album.

The song is reported to have been inspired by the break-up of his childhood friend and business partner, Trace Ayala, with actress Elisha Cuthbert. In October 2006, Timberlake said that he would focus on his music career rather than his movie roles, specifying that leaving the music industry would be a \"dumb thing to do at this point\". He was the special guest performer at the 2006 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show for being where he sang SexyBack. \nIn January 2007, Timberlake embarked on the FutureSex/LoveShow tour. \"Summer Love/Set the Mood Prelude\" was the fourth U.S. single off the album, and the next single in the UK was \"LoveStoned/I Think She Knows Interlude\". The song \"Give It to Me\", a Timbaland single on which Timberlake guests with Nelly Furtado, reached the Hot 100 number-one spot.\nIn February 2008, Timberlake was awarded two Grammy Awards.

It is the language of the Jewish Talmud.\nWords are written with the 22 characters of the Aramaic alphabet, which was widely adopted for other languages and is an ancestor to the Hebrew, Syriac and Arabic alphabets.\nHistory.\nAramaic is the language of long parts of the two Bible books of Daniel and Ezra. It is the language of the Jewish Talmud.\nIn the 12th century BC, the first speakers of Aramaic started to live in what is now Syria, Iraq and eastern Turkey. As the bureaucratic language of the Achaemenid Empire, it became the most important language in the Middle East. Jewish speakers took the language with them to North Africa and Europe. Christian speakers took the language with them to Persia, India and even China.\nIn the 7th century AD, Aramaic stopped being the most important language in the Middle East. The Arabic language became the new important language. Aramaic is still spoken by scattered communities of Jews, Mandaeans and some Christians. Small groups of people still speak Aramaic in different parts of the Middle East. The wars of the last two centuries have made many speakers leave their homes to live in different places around the world. Today, between 500,000 and 850,000 people speak Aramaic languages.\nDialects.\nAramaic is not one language without any changes. Because many different people over many centuries spoke and wrote it, there are many different types of Aramaic languages, called dialects, but some of them are so different that they are like different languages.\nThe different dialects make two groups: an Eastern group and a Western group. The division between them is around the River Euphrates.\nThe dialects are divided also by time. Old Aramaic is the name of the oldest dialects, which only scholars learn. Middle Aramaic is the group of dialects, which are used not every day but for special things like writing and religion.

It is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, Egypt to the east, Sudan to the southeast, Chad and Niger to the south, and Algeria and Tunisia to the west. It covers an area of almost . Libya is the 17th largest country in the world.\nGeography.\nLibya's borders touch the countries of Egypt, Sudan, Chad, Algeria, Niger, and Tunisia. To its north is the Mediterranean Sea. The capital of Libya is Tripoli, which is a port on the sea. Tripoli has about one million people. Libya covers an area of about .\nThe highest point in Libya is Bikku Bitti 2,267 m above sea level and the lowest point is Sabkhat Ghuzayyil -47 m at below sea level. Most of the country is flat, with large plains. Because it is so dry, only 1.03% of the land is suitable for farming.\nThe area around Tripoli is called \"Tripolitania\", and it was the most developed during the Ottoman Empire.\nCyrenaica is an area of the north east coast. It is divided from Tripolitania by the Gulf of Sirte. It was named by the Romans who built the city of Cirene in 630 BC. It includes the cities of Tobruk and Benghazi.\nThe Fezzan is an area of desert in south west Libya which the Italians made a part of Tripoli in 1912. After the war this area was governed by France, who wanted to annex to their Empire.\nThe people.\nThe Libyans are Muslim. The population of Libya in 2011 was said to be about 6,597,960. This is not a large number for a country that has such a large area, so the population density of Libya is low. This is because much of Libya is in the Sahara Desert. Most people in Libya live in cities on the coast. People from Libya are called Libyans.\nLibyans are mostly Arabs, though many are Berbers, a group which includes the nomadic Tuareg of North Africa. About 95% of Libyans are of Arab-Berber origin. Nearly all Libyans are Sunni Muslims.\nDistricts.\nSince 2007 Libya has been divided into 22 districts.\nEconomy.\nOil was discovered in Libya in 1958 and is about 95% of the country's export income. Oil is about 25% of Libya's GDP. Other exports include natural gas, salt, limestone and gypsum. Because so much of the country is desert, Libya has to import about 75% of its food. It does grow wheat, barley, olives, dates, citrus, peanuts, soybeans and many vegetables. In 1984, a pipeline was started to bring underground water from the Sahara to coastal areas for irrigation. The pipeline which will take 25 years to complete has been estimated to cost about $25 billion. It is called the Great Man-made River, and is the largest water development scheme in the world.\nThe money of Libya is called the Libyan dinar. It was made to take the place of the old money, the Libyan pound, in 1971. There are 1000 dirhams in a dinar. Dinar is the name of the money in many Islamic countries. The name comes from an old Roman coin, the denarius.\nPolitics and History.\nLibya is made up of three regions, Tripolitania, Cyrenaica, and the Fezzan. Tripolitania is the area on the north west coast, once called the Kingdom of Tripoli. It was ruled by Turks from the Ottoman Empire. The USA went to war with the Kingdom of Tripoli in 1805 over the problems of piracy in the Mediterranean. The USA had refused to pay increased \"protection\" money to the Turkish rulers.\nTripolitania and Cyrenaica were captured by the Italians during the Italian-Turkish War of 1911-1912. The reason for the war was to set up a colony for Italy. They said that this area was once part of the Roman Empire and belonged to Italy. The Italians were the first country to use aeroplanes to drop bombs when they attacked Tripoli in 1911.\nMany thousands of Italian settlers moved to Libya to set up businesses and farms, which were going to supply food and produce for Italy and its Empire Libyans had some of their land in Cyrenaica taken from them by force and about 70,000 people died during the battles, starved, or were decimated by the terrible epidemic (called \"Spanish flu\") of 1918. Many thousands escaped to Egypt, but soon moved back when the new Italian governor Italo Balbo started a friendly attitude toward Arabs.\nItalian Libya enjoyed in the late 1930s a huge development, with the creation of new railways, ports, hospitals, airports, roads. In those years the agricultural economy boomed, thanks to the creation of many dozens of new villages for Italian &amp; Arab farmers. There was even an international race-car competition outside Tripoli (\"Grand Prix of Tripoli\" ).\nMuch of the North African Campaign of World War II was fought in Libya, including the Battle of Tobruk. The British captured Tripolitania in 1942 and ruled it until 1951.\nUnited Kingdom of Libya.\nAfter World War II, the regions of Libya were ruled by military governors from both Britain and France. The United Nations made Libya an independent country, the United Kingdom of Libya, in 1951. This was to be a constitutional monarchy, ruled by King Idris I and his successors. Idris (Muhammad Idris bin Muhammad al-Mahdi as-Senussi) (13 March 1890\u201425 May 1983) had been the Emir of Cyrenaica, but went into exile in Egypt in 1922. At the end of the war, he returned as emir, with support of Britain. He was also asked to be Emir of Tripolitania. He was able to unite the three regions and became the king of the United Kingdom of Libya on 24 December 1951.\nThe problems facing Libya were huge. The country was poor, with little in the way of goods to export. Only 250,000 people could read. There were only 16 Libyan college graduates, no Libyan doctors, engineers, pharmacists, or surveyors. The United Nations estimated that 10% of the people were blind from eye diseases, especially trachoma. Idris was a religious leader did not take much interest in the affairs of government. His government was seen to be corrupt, and did nothing about an increasing rise in Arab nationalism which had brought Nasser to power in Egypt in 1952. Once oil was discovered, Libya became one of the largest oil producing countries in the world. Many Libyans felt that Cyrenaica was getting more of the oil money than the rest of the country. A lot of the money from oil was also going to overseas companies.\nLibyan Arab Republic.\nIn the early morning of 1 September 1969, a group of military officers took over the government in a coup d'\u00e9tat. Colonel Muammar al-Gaddafi was named as chief of staff of the military. From 1970-1972 he served as Prime Minister. He began a political system named \"The Third Universal Theory\". This is a mix of socialism and Islam, based on tribal government. It was to be put in place by the Libyan people themselves in a unique form of \"direct democracy.\" Al-Gaddafi called this \"jamahiriya\".\nSome of his first actions were to take back control of the oil and send the remaining Italian settlers back to Italy. He also closed down the American USAF base.\nGreat Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya.\nIn 1977 Libya became \"Al-Jamahiriya al-`Arabiyah al-Libiyah ash-Sha`biyah al-Ishtirakiyah al-Uzma\" . In English, the name means the \"Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya\".\nLibya was alleged to have sponsored anti-western groups. Gaddafi openly supported independence movements like Nelson Mandela's African National Congress, Palestinian Liberation Organization, the Irish Republican Army, the Polisario Front (Western Sahara) and more. Because of this Libya's foreign relations with several western nation were negatively effected, and it would become a reason for US to bomb Libya in 1986. Gaddafi survived the bombing, the action of US was condemned by many countries and UN general assembly.\nLibya had also supplied weapons and money to the Irish Republican Army during its fight with the British government in Northern Ireland. Gaddafi developed a good relationship with revolutionary Colombian Marxist\u2013Leninist guerrilla group called FARC. Activities also included such as Libyan contribution towards Falklands War, where Gaddafi had provided 20 launchers, 60 SA-7 missiles, machine guns, mortars and mines to the Argentinian government. Libya was alleged to have role in bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988 and French UTA Flight 772 in 1989, despite the investigation found no evidence which involves any Libyan role.\nThe United Nations put economic sanctions in place against Libya in 1992. These sanctions stopped other countries selling weapons, investing money, or even allowing their people to visit Libya. After six days when US had captured Iraq's Saddam Hussein, Gaddafi renounced Libya's weapons of mass destruction programs and welcomed international inspections to verify that he would follow through on the commitment. Gaddafi said he hopes that other nations would follow his example. UN removed the sanctions in the same year. Gaddafi solved the Lockerbie plane crash issue by paying US$2.7 billion to the families of the victims. Prime Minister of Libya Shukri Ghanem, told in the interviews that Gaddafi was \"paying the price for peace\" with the West, and suggested that Libya had no role in the case. United Nations observers would acknowledge such statement and cast doubt towards the whole issue.\nGaddafi also set about having normal relations with other countries. Western European leaders and many working-level and commercial delegations were able to visit the country. He made his first trip to Western Europe in 15 years when he traveled to Brussels in April 2004. He reattached the ties with Russia once again, which had remained idle since the collapse of the Soviet Union.\nBy 2010, Libya's Human Development Index was highest in Africa, the country ranked at #53 overall as 'High standard' on living bases. Libya remained a debt-free nation. In 2011, Human rights in Libya were praised by the U.N. Human rights council. However, after civil war the human rights seems to be getting worse. On March 2013, according to the Barnabas Fund, at least 48 Christians were tortured inside Libya, one died in custody.\nSuffrage.\nEvery Libyan who is older than 18 can vote. This means that voting (also known as \"suffrage\") in Libya is \"universal\".\nCivil War.\nIn February 2011, a civil war broke out in Libya when rebels fought against Colonel Muammar al-Gaddafi and his government. NATO intervened in the war in favor of the rebels. However, some rebels had links with al-Qaeda. NATO ended its mission in October after Colonel al-Gaddafi was reported to have been killed. In the aftermath of the civil war, a low-level rebellion by al-Gaddafi loyalists continued. Armed militias filled the gap left by the revolution. Two different national governments were organized in Tripoli and Tobruk and many fighters did not follow either of them."}

It is got by dividing the population by the area. For example, France has a population of 60,561,200, and an area of 551,695 square kilometres, so its population density is about 109.8 persons per square kilometre.\nA number of factors affect population density. For example, the climate. Greenland has a very low population density because people cannot live on its large glacier (ice sheet) or survive in such frigid temperatures.\nMany cities are near rivers, because the first settlers wanted somewhere close to water to start a society. Areas around rivers often have a high population density.\nThe population density of New York City is 10,292 persons per square kilometre. Other places, such as large countries, can have very low population densities. The population density of Canada is only 3.8 persons per square kilometre because it is such a big country.\nThe country with the highest population density in the world is Monaco, with 16,620 persons per square kilometre. The country with the lowest is Greenland, which has only 0.03 persons per square kilometre."}

It was ratified on July 4, 1776. It says that the Americans were no longer under British rule. Instead, the thirteen British colonies came together to become a union of free and independent states. In the conclusion of the Declaration of Independence a quote was: \"with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.\" \nBefore the Declaration.\nBefore 1776, the United States of America was not a country. The individual states were colonies of the British Empire. They were called British Colonies. This means that the King and Parliament of Great Britain ruled the Colonies. \"Plundered our seas...\" meant that the founding Fathers blamed the British for the American Revolution. \nEffects.\nDuring this time, many American people were angry at Great Britain. Many Americans did not like paying taxes to Great Britain when they did not have anyone to speak for them in Parliament. The American people wanted to be treated like British citizens.\nTaking action.\nResponding to actions taken by Great Britain, including the Intolerable Acts, the different colonies formed a Continental Congress to make decisions for all of the colonies. They met in the American city of Philadelphia. During a meeting of the Second Continental Congress, on June 11, 1776, they chose five people to write a document that would become the Declaration of Independence. These people were:\nThe Declaration of Independence.\nPicking a Writer.\nThe committee decided that one person would write the document, while the rest would give him advice on what to write. John Adams decided that Thomas Jefferson should write the document. He bought him a few drinks and told him that he was more qualified to write it because he was a Virginian and he was simply a better writer. Jefferson got to work.\nWhat it says.\nIn the Declaration, Jefferson starts by writing about people's rights, and what the government should and should not do. This part of the Declaration is called the Preamble. He then lists specific bad things that the British government did to the colonies. He says these included putting people in jail with no reason; making taxes that were too high; and not respecting people who lived in the colonies.\nAgreeing on the Declaration.\nOn July 2, 1776, the Continental Congress argued about the Declaration and made some changes to it. After making changes, they approved the Declaration. They declared their independence from the British Empire that day, at the Pennsylvania State House.\nHowever, the Continental Congress did not officially approve the Declaration until July 4. On that day, twelve of the thirteen groups that represented the colonies approved and ordered the Declaration to be printed. (The Province of New York did not vote.) This version of the Declaration was signed only by the President of the Congress, John Hancock.\nOn July 15, the New York group agreed with the rest of the colonies' groups. This meant that everyone in the Congress agreed on the Declaration.\nOn July 19, the Declaration's title was changed from \"A Declaration of the Representatives of the United States of America in General Congress assembled\" to \"the unanimous declaration of the thirteen United States of America.\"\nOverall, 56 men signed the Declaration. However, some people signed at different times. Many people signed a parchment paper copy of the Declaration on July 2. Many of these signers were not there when the original Declaration was adopted on July 4. One signer, Matthew Thornton, from the Province of New Hampshire, signed on November 4, 1776.\nEffects of the Declaration.\nThe Declaration of Independence had many different effects. Many civilizations were in early Africa. \u201cAfrica is a big place\u201d (World Civilizations, 470). Africa has the world's largest desert, world\u2019s largest river, very immense and big mountains. These geographical features created national barriers and borders which protected those in the civilizations near them. In this essay you\u2019ll hear about early African geography, Ghana, Mali, and Songhai.\nEffects on Great Britain.\nWhen the King of Great Britain, King George III, and Parliament heard about the Declaration, they were angry. Great Britain and the people in America had already been fighting in a war called the American Revolution. America won the war, and in 1783 Great Britain had to recognize the independence of the new country, the United States, at the Treaty of Paris.\nEffects on America.\nThe people of America know that the Declaration of Independence is very important. Every year on July 4, they have a holiday called 'Independence Day'. They celebrate this holiday to remember the day that the Declaration was approved, and the day that the United States of America became its own country. They often celebrate with parades, fireworks, and songs.\nThe Declaration of Independence also talks about the simple ideas that the people who started the United States believed in. It says that every person in this U.S has the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It also says that the government has to listen to its own people. These things were what made America a free independent country.\nText.\nStarting text.\nThe initial text says that a declaration of independence must be well-reasoned:\nWhen in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.\nThe Preamble.\nThe preamble of the declaration is the best-known part.\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. \u2014 That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, \u2014 That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.\nSimple English translation.\nWe think these truths are obvious: \nPresent day.\nThe Declaration of Independence can be viewed at the National Archives Museum near the National Mall in Washington, D.C."}

The word comes from the Latin \"pre\" (before) and \"judge\". People may prejudge any question, but the word is often used for an opinion about a person or group of people. English understanding of the Latin has changed in past centuries. In old English the word \"prejudice\" denotes the use of \"good judgment\" before an event, e.g., \"I decided (showed prejudice) not to run with the bulls because I could have been hurt. \nThe word \"prejudice\" is often used when people dislike another group of people that are different from them. They may decide they do not like them because of their skin color (this is \"racial prejudice\"), religion (religious prejudice) or nationality. Such prejudices can lead to discrimination, hatred or even war.\nJudges in a court of law should not be prejudiced when deciding whether someone is guilty. They should have an \"open mind\" so that they can make a fair decision (this is also known as not having a bias; most judges in a court of law have sworn to be unbiased when deciding a penalty). For example, if that person is the judge's friend then the judge would be prejudiced because he (or she) would not want his (or her) friend to get into trouble. In many other situations it is important not to be prejudiced, such as serving as an adjudicator in a competition or a juror in a trial.\nModern people sometimes use \"prejudice\" to mean \"bigotry.\" This leaves them with two words for one thing, and none for the other.

{"id": "14655", "revid": "1066705", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14655", "title": "Inflation", "text": "Inflation means that the general level of prices is going up, the opposite of deflation. More money will need to be paid for goods (like a loaf of bread) and services (like getting a haircut at the hairdresser's). Economists measure inflation regularly to know an economy's state. Inflation changes the ratio of money towards goods or services; more money is needed to get the same amount of a good or service, or the same amount of money will get a lower amount of a good or service. Economists defined certain customer baskets to be able to measure inflation. There can be positive and negative effects of inflation. \nCauses of inflation.\nWhen the total money in an economy (the money supply) increases too rapidly, the quality of the money (the currency value) often decreases. Economists generally think that the increased money supply (monetary inflation) causes the price of goods/services price to increase (price inflation) over a longer period. They disagree on causes over a shorter period.\nDemand-Pull inflation.\nThe Demand-Pull inflation theory says it results from \"too much money chasing too few goods.\" In other words, if the will of buying goods is growing faster than amount of goods that have been made, prices will go up. This is most likely happens in economies that are growing fast.\nWhenever a product is bought or sold beyond its real price for its worth, then Inflation of money occurs. If a company, for example, makes a small amount of goods which are sold over high quantity then it has to increase the prices so that it can manage the product quantity.\nCost-Push inflation.\nThe Cost-Push inflation theory says that when the cost of making goods (which are paid by the company) go up, they have to make prices higher to make profit out of selling that product. The higher costs of making goods can include things like workers' wages, taxes to be paid to the government, or higher costs of raw materials from other countries.\nHowever, Austrian School economists think this is wrong, because if people have to pay higher prices, this just means they have less to spend on other things.\nCosts of inflation.\nAlmost everyone thinks excessive inflation is bad. Inflation affects different people in different ways. It also depends on whether inflation is expected or not. If the inflation rate is equal to what most people are expecting (anticipated inflation), then we can adjust and the cost is not as high. For example, banks can change their interest rates and workers can negotiate contracts that include automatic wage hikes as the price level goes up. \nProblems arise when there is unanticipated inflation:"}
