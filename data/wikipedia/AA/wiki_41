After incorporation as a private for-profit company in 1999, Craigslist expanded into nine more U.S. cities in 2000, four each in 2001 and 2002, and 14 in 2003. By September 2007, Craigslist had established itself in approximately 450 cities in 50 countries.\nIn 2007 Craigslist operated with a staff of 24 people.\nIts sole source of revenue is paid job ads in select cities ($75 per ad for the San Francisco Bay Area; $25 per ad for New York, Los Angeles, San Diego, Boston, Seattle, Washington, D.C., Chicago and recently Portland, Oregon) and paid broker apartment listings in New York City ($10 per ad).\nThe site serves over nine billion page views per month, putting it in 56th place overall among web sites worldwide, ninth place overall among web sites in the United States (per Alexa.com on January 10, 2008), to over thirty million unique visitors.

Classified advertising allows private individuals (not simply companies or corporate entities) to try to sell products or services. \nClassified advertising is called that because it is generally grouped within the publication under headings classifying the product or service being offered (headings such as Accounting, Automobiles, Clothing, Farm Produce, For Sale, For Rent, etc.) and is grouped entirely in a distinct section of the periodical, which makes it distinct from display advertising, which often contains graphics or other art work and which is placed near to editorial content. \nNewspapers are continuing to make less and less money from classified advertising because more and more people are using the Internet now and fewer people are reading newspapers. Classified advertising at some of the larger newspaper chains has dropped 14% to 20% in 2007 while traffic to classified sites has grown 23%.\nAs the online classified advertising sector develops, there is an increasing emphasis toward specialization. \nReferences.\n http://classifiedadslink.com"}

People used to think his name was \"Thomas \u00e1 Becket\", but it is now known to be wrong.\nBecket was born in Cheapside, London. He was an intelligent child, who also enjoyed playing sports and hunting. At age 16, he left England to study in Paris.\nIn 1143, Becket joined the household of Theobald of Bec, as a clerk. He became Archbishop of Canterbury in 1162. He had been a close friend of King Henry II, but they argued about the rights of the Church. This argument between Henry and Becket ended their friendship. Becket resigned as Lord Chancellor and sought to extend the rights of the archbishopric. This led to a series of conflicts with the King. One was on the jurisdiction of secular courts over English clergymen. \nAttempts by Henry to influence the other bishops against Becket began in Westminster in October 1163. The King sought approval of the traditional rights of the royal government over the church. Henry held a meeting with most of the higher English clergy at Clarendon Palace on 30 January 1164. Becket was officially asked to agree to the King's rights.\nHenry summoned Becket to appear before a great council at Northampton Castle on 8 October 1164, to answer allegations. Convicted on the charges, Becket stormed out of the trial and fled to Europe. King Louis VII of France offered Becket protection. He spent nearly two years in the Cistercian abbey of Pontigny, until Henry's threats made him return to Sens.\nBeckett returned to England, but the dispute continued. He excommunicated his enemies in the Church, and threatened to do the same to Henry. \nUpon hearing reports of Becket's actions, Henry said things which were understood as wishing Becket killed. The king's exact words are unknown and several versions have been reported. The most commonly quoted, as handed down by oral tradition, is \"Who will rid me of this troublesome priest?\".\nBecket was killed by four of the King's knights on 29 December 1170. He became a saint in 1173. His major shrine is in Canterbury, but was destroyed by order of Henry VIII during his reign."}

Brine shrimp are Artemia, a genus of aquatic crustacea which has changed little (externally) since the Triassic period. They can often be found in saltwater ponds and marshes, and cannot live very long in fresh water. \"Artemia\" avoid most types of predators, such as fish, because they live in waters of very high salinity: (25 parts per thousand). The optimum for \"Artemia\" is 100 to 150 parts per thousand. The shrimp grow to be about one centimeter long. Females tend to be larger than males.\nBrine shrimp circulatory and respiratory systems work together to remove extra salt from their body and distribute oxygen. They breathe through gills on their feet. The oxygen taken in is carried through the bloodstream. The heart pumps the blood around the body. Brine shrimp have a protein called hemoglobin in their blood. This helps the oxygen to be more efficiently transported to cells around the body. They need hemoglobin because oxygen levels can be very low in salty water. Then, the gills pump the excess salt, water, and carbon dioxide out of the body. Additional salt is pumped out through exocrine glands.\nThe brine shrimp's body has a head, thorax, and abdomen. A hard exoskeleton covers the entire body. Inside this exoskeleton, which is made of chitin, is where the brine shrimp\u2019s muscles are located. Their muscles are attached internally. They move by beating their tails and by the continuous movement of the legs along their body.\nReproduction.\nMales differ from females by having the second antennae enlarged, and modified into clasping organs used in mating.\nAdult female brine shrimp ovulate about every 140\u00a0hours. In favourable conditions, the female brine shrimp can produce eggs that almost immediately hatch. But in extreme conditions, such as low oxygen level or salinity above 150\u2030, female brine shrimp produce eggs inside cysts. They are metabolically inactive and can remain in total stasis for two years in dry oxygen-free conditions, even at temperatures below freezing. While in cysts, brine shrimp eggs survive temperatures of liquid air () and a small percentage survive above boiling temperature () for up to two hours.\nOnce placed in normal briny (salt) water, the eggs hatch within a few hours. The nauplius larvae are less than 0.4\u00a0mm in length when they first hatch. Brine shrimp have a biological life cycle of one year"}

Usually this is done to convince other people of one's own beliefs. It is common with Christianity but also occurs with other religions. The word is a made up of television and evangelism. The term was started by \"Time magazine\". Today it is also used for preachers who use modern mass media, such as radio, or the internet to spread the gospel.\nPlease note, that televangelism is different from watching a Christian mass (or other religious programme, for example, the blessings Urbi et Orbi of the Pope) on television, or other media.\nIn Christianity.\nTelevangelists often give speeches, or sermons. There they tell about the good news, and they ask people to do specific things. Most often, they want donations either for their organisation, or for a specific cause. Most televangelists make a connection between wonders or miracles, and the donations of the faithful. What they preach is a form of prosperity theology, and this connection is a defining characteristic.\nIn Christianity, televangelists often have positions that are close to those of the Charismatic Movement, or of Pentecostalism.\nIn Islam.\nTelevangelism also exists in Islam. There, the people are either Salafi Sunni Muslims, or they are Shiites or Alevites.\nYusuf al-Qaradawi is a very popular Islamic tellevangelist.\nHarun Yahya is an Turkish Islamic televangelist who has creationist ideas. Politically, his ideas are close to the G\u00fclen movement.

Their message is not the true Gospel of Jesus Christ. There is nothing spiritual or miraculous about their on-stage chicanery. It is all a devious ruse designed to take advantage of desperate people. They are not Godly ministers but greedy impostors who corrupt the Word of God for money's sake. They are not real pastors who shepherd the flock of God but hirelings whose only design is to fleece the sheep. Their love of money is glaringly obvious in what they say as well as how they live. They claim to possess great spiritual power, but in reality they are rank materialists and enemies of everything holy.\""}

Le Guin", "text": "Ursula Kroeber Le Guin () (October 21, 1929 \u2013 January 22, 2018) was an American writer. She wrote books, poetry, children's books, essays, short stories, fantasy and science fiction.\nLife.\nEarly life: California.\nUrsula K. Le Guin was born Ursula Kroeber in Berkeley, California, on October 21, 1929. Her father, Alfred Louis Kroeber (1876\u20131960), was an anthropologist at the University of California, Berkeley. Le Guin's mother, Theodora Kroeber (1897\u20131979; born Theodora Covel Kracaw), had a graduate degree in psychology. She started writing in her sixties and became a successful author. Her best known work was \"Ishi in Two Worlds\" (1961). This was a biography of Ishi, an indigenous American who was the last known member of the Yahi tribe.\nUrsula had three older brothers: Karl, Theodore, and Clifton. The family had a large collection of books. Ursula and her brothers all liked to read when they were young. Le Guin read science fiction and fantasy. She and her brothers often read issues of \"Thrilling Wonder Stories\" and \"Astounding Science Fiction\". She liked myths and legends. She especially liked Norse mythology and Native American legends that her father would tell her.\nMany people visited the Kroeber family. Some of the visitors were well-known academics such as Robert Oppenheimer. Le Guin used Oppenheimer as the model for her lead character in \"The Dispossessed\", a physicist named Shevek. The family lived in a summer home in the Napa valley and a house in Berkeley during the school year.\nEducation.\nLe Guin studied at Berkeley High School. She graduated with another student who became a famous science fiction author, Philip K. Dick. She received her Bachelor of Arts in Renaissance French and Italian literature from Radcliffe College in 1951. She was a member of the Phi Beta Kappa honor society. Le Guin then studied at Columbia University, and earned a Master of Arts in French in 1952. Soon after, she began a Ph.D. program. She won a Fulbright grant to continue her studies in France from 1953 to 1954. Later, Le Guin also received Fulbright grants to travel to London in 1968 and 1975.\nFrance.\nIn 1953, while traveling to France aboard the \"Queen Mary\", Ursula met historian Charles Le Guin. Charles was also a Fulbright Scholar. They got married in Paris in December 1953. They returned to the United States in 1954.\nMarriage and children.\nLe Guin said that getting married meant she had to stop studying for her doctorate degree. While her husband finished his doctorate at Emory University in Georgia, and later at the University of Idaho, Le Guin taught French and worked as a secretary until the birth of her daughter Elisabeth in 1957. The couple had another daughter, Caroline, and a son, Theodore (born 1964).\nReturn to the West Coast: Portland.\nIn 1959 Charles became a history instructor at Portland State University, so they moved to Portland, Oregon. They lived there for the rest of their lives.\nWriting life.\nShe first wrote in the 1960s. She was awarded many Hugo and Nebula awards. Her agent was Virgina Kidd.\nShe was given the Gandalf Award in 1979 and the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America Grand Master Award in 2003. She got eighteen Locus Awards, more than any other writer. Her book \"The Farthest Shore\" won the National Book Award for Children's Books in 1973.\nLe Guin was the Professional Guest of Honor at the 1975 World Science Fiction Convention in Melbourne, Australia. She got the Library of Congress \"Living Legends\" award in the \"Writers and Artists\" area in April 2000 for her additions to America's cultural history. In 2004, Le Guin was the was given the Association for Library Service to Children's May Hill Arbuthnot Honor Lecture Award.\nDeath.\nLe Guin died on January 22, 2018, at her home in Portland. She was 88 years old. Her son said that she had been sick for several months. He said that she probably had a heart attack. There was a private memorial service for her in Portland. There was also a public memorial service in June 2018. At this service, many writers gave speeches, including: Margaret Atwood, Molly Gloss, and Walidah Imarisha\nBeliefs and values.\nPolitical Freedom.\nIn 1975, Le Guin won a Nebula Award for her story \"The Diary of the Rose.\" She did not accept the award. This was a protest against the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America. The SFWA had recently canceled Stanis\u0142aw Lem's membership in the group. Le Guin believed they kicked Lem out because he criticized American science fiction and chose to live in the Soviet Union, She said she could not take an award for a story about an unfree society from a writers' group that did not protect freedom.\nReligion.\nLe Guin said she was did not learn any religion and was not taught to be religious as a child. But, she became very interested in Taoism and Buddhism. She said that Taoism was a tool to help her understand her life as a teenager and young adult. In 1997 she published a translation of the \"Tao Te Ching\".\nAuthor's rights.\nIn December 2009, Le Guin quit the Authors Guild. She did this to protest the Guild's agreement with the Google's book digitization project. \"You decided to deal with the devil\", she wrote in her letter when she quit. She wrote that they had given control over authors' rights and copyright to a company for nothing. Le Guin made a speech at the 2014 National Book Awards. She explained that Amazon's control over the publishing industry was bad and dangerous. She was especially concerned about how Amazon blocked the Hachette Book Group from selling all books because the companies disagreed about how to sell ebooks. The speech was broadcast twice by National Public Radio. And, many other news organizations reported on it around the world.\nWriting career.\nEarly writing-1951-1968.\nLe Guin's first published work was in her fictional country called Orsinia. These were a poem and a short story. The poem, \"Folksong from the Montayna Province,\" was published in 1959. The short story was \"An die Musik\", in 1961. Between 1951 and 1961 she also wrote five novels that all happened in Orsinia. But, publishers did not want them because they thought they were hard to read or understand. Some of her poetry from the 1950s was published in 1975 in a book called \"Wild Angels\". Le Guin was rejected by many publishers. Then she turned to science fiction because she knew that clearly labeled SF would sell well. Her first professional SF publication was the short story \"April in Paris\" in 1962 in \"Fantastic Science Fiction\". Seven more stories followed in the next few years, in \"Fantastic\" or \"Amazing Stories\". One of them was \"The Dowry of the Angyar\", which introduced the fictional Hainish universe, Two more were \"The Rule of Names\" and \"The Word of Unbinding\". These introduced the world of Earthsea. Most critics ignored these stories.\nLe Guin published her first novel in 1966. It was called \"Rocannon's World\". Ace Books published it. Two more Hainish novels, \"Planet of Exile\" and \"City of Illusions\" were published in 1966 and 1967. These three books became the Hainish trilogy. The first two were each published as half of an \"Ace Double\": two novels bound into a paperback and sold as a single low-cost volume. \"City of Illusions\" was published as a standalone volume. Le Guin was getting greater name-recognition. Critics paid more attention to these books than to Le Guin's short stories. Several science fiction magazines reviewed them, but the critical response was still muted. The books had many themes and ideas also present in Le Guin's better known later works, including the \"archetypal journey\" of a protagonist who undertakes both a physical journey and one of self-discovery, cultural contact and communication, the search for identity, and the reconciliation of opposing forces.\nGetting more attention.\nLe Guin's next two books in 1968 and 1969 brought her much more attention and praise. The Wizard of Earthsea in 1968 was a young adult fantasy novel. The Left Hand of Darkness in 1969 started her Hainish universe, explored sexuality, and won awards. These two books changed Le Guin's career and made her a major writer. \"A Wizard of Earthsea\" and \"The Left Hand of Darkness\" have been described by critic Harold Bloom as Le Guin's masterpieces.\nLe Guin had not planned to write for young adults. But, the editor of Parnassus Press asked her to write a novel for young people. He thought they could sell many books to that group. \"A Wizard of Earthsea\" published in 1968. It was a fantasy coming of age story for teenagers. In the book, Le Guin created a fictional archipelago called Earthsea. She also created the first wizarding school. Readers and reviewers in the US and the UK liked the book very much.\nHer next novel was \"The Left Hand of Darkness\" in 1969 showed the strength of her writing and won awards. It was in her Hainish universe on a fictional planet where humans have no fixed sex. Le Guin explored experiences of gender and sexuality. The book was Le Guin's first about feminist issues. The book shocked and surprised science fiction critics. It won both the Hugo and the Nebula Awards for best novel. Le Guin the first woman to win these awards.\nFor the next couple of years in the 1970s, Le Guin continued and extended the work she had started.\nLe Guin continued to develop themes of equilibrium and coming-of-age in the next two installments of the \"Earthsea\" series, \"The Tombs of Atuan\" and \"The Farthest Shore\", published in 1971 and 1972, respectively. Both books were praised for their writing, while the exploration of death as a theme in \"The Farthest Shore\" also drew praise.\nShe won the Hugo Award again in 1973 for \"The Word for World is Forest\". The book was influenced by Le Guin's anger over the Vietnam War, and explored themes of colonialism and militarism: Le Guin later described it as the \"most overt political statement\" she had made in a fictional work.\nHer 1974 novel \"The Dispossessed\" again won both the Hugo and the Nebula awards for best novel, making her the first person to win both awards for each of two books. Also set in the Hainish universe, the story explored anarchism and utopianism. Scholar Charlotte Spivack said Le Guin was making her science fiction writing more about discussing political ideas.\nSeveral of her speculative fiction short stories from the period, including her first published story, were later anthologized in the 1975 collection \"The Wind's Twelve Quarters\". The fiction of the period 1966 to 1974, which also included \"The Lathe of Heaven\", the Hugo Award-winning \"The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas\" and the Nebula Award-winning \"The Day Before the Revolution\", constitutes Le Guin's best-known body of work.\nLater writing.\nLe Guin published the novel \"Lavinia\" in 2008. Lavinia is a character from Virgil's \"Aeneid\",\nThe \"Annals of the Western Shore\" was a series of three books: \"Gifts\" (2004), \"Voices\" (2006), and \"Powers\" (2007). Each book has a different main character and happens in a different place. But, the books all share some characters and places.\"Gifts\" won the PEN Center USA 2005 Children's literature award. \"Powers\" won the Nebula Award for Best Novel in 2009.\nNear the end of her life, Le Guin wrote less fiction. She wrote essays, poems, and some translations. Her last publications included the non-fiction collections \"Dreams Must Explain Themselves\" and \"Ursula K Le Guin: Conversations on Writing\". She also wrote a book of poetry called \"So Far So Good: Final Poems 2014\u20132018\". These were released after she died.\nAbout the writing.\nInfluences.\nMany other writiers influenced Le Guin.\nCultural anthropology was important to her writing.\nCarl Jung's archetypes may be seen in her work.\nTaoism was part of Le Guin's life and work.\nThemes.\nPolitical systems.\nThe story of \"The Dispossessed\" happens on twin planets called Urras and Anarres. Urras was richer than Anarres. But Anarres is more advanced ethically and morally. Sttlers from Urras planned the Anarres society. It is an anarcho-socialist society that is an \"ambiguous utopia\". Anarres society is neither perfect nor static, unlike classical utopias. The main character, Shevek, travels to Urras to do research. Urras society is authoritarian, hierarchical, and misogynistic. But these the anarchists on Anarres do not have those problems. In their society cooperation and individual liberty are most important.\nResponses to her work.\nReception.\nLe Guin became popular and got good reviews quickly after publishing \"The Left Hand of Darkness\" in 1969. She was very well known among SF writers by the 1970s. Readers bought millions of her books. And, her writing was translated into more than 40 languages. Some of her books stayed in print many decades after their first publication. Academics studied her work carefully and discussed it often. Later in her career, mainstream literary critics wrote positively about her work. In an obituary, Jo Walton said that Le Guin \"was so good that the mainstream couldn't dismiss SF any more\".\nLe Guin earliest work stayed the most popular and got the most recognition. A reviewer in 2018 said that she often lectured the reader in her later works. John Clute, wrote in \"The Guardian\", that she felt responsible for explaining important things clearly, and that this was difficult for her. Some critics disliked some of her work. \"The Compass Rose\" had a mixed reaction. Even the critically well-received \"The Left Hand of Darkness\" was criticized by some feminists.\nOther authors liked her work. According to Zadie Smith, her prose was \"as elegant and beautiful as any written in the twentieth century\". After Le Guin's death in 2018, writer Michael Chabon called her the \"greatest American writer of her generation\", and said that she had \"awed [him] with the power of an unfettered imagination\". Author Margaret Atwood praised Le Guin's \"sane, smart, crafty and lyrical voice\", and wrote that social injustice was a powerful motivation through Le Guin's life. Literary critic Harold Bloom described Le Guin as an \"exquisite stylist\", saying that in her writing, \"Every word was exactly in place and every sentence or line had resonance\". According to Bloom, Le Guin was a \"visionary who set herself against all brutality, discrimination, and exploitation\".\nAcademic and author Joyce Carol Oates highlighted Le Guin's \"outspoken sense of justice, decency, and common sense\", and called her \"one of the great American writers and a visionary artist whose work will long endure\". China Mi\u00e9ville described Le Guin as a \"literary colossus\", and wrote that she was a \"writer of intense ethical seriousness and intelligence, of wit and fury, of radical politics, of subtlety, of freedom and yearning\".\nPraise for Le Guin frequently focused on the social and political themes her work explored. \"The New York Times\" described her as using \"a lean but lyrical style\" to explore issues of moral relevance. In the introduction to an interview in 2008, \"Vice\" magazine described Le Guin as having written \"some of the more mind-warping sf and fantasy tales of the past 40 years\".\nAwards and recognition.\nLe Guin won many annual awards for individual works. She was nominated for Hugo Awards twenty-four times and won seven times. She won six Nebula Awards from eighteen nominations. Four of her Nebula Awards were for Best Novel, more than any other writer. Le Guin won twenty-two Locus Awards. Her third Earthsea novel, \"The Farthest Shore\", won the 1973 National Book Award for Young People's Literature, She was a finalist for ten Mythopoeic Awards, nine in Fantasy and one for Scholarship. Her 1996 collection \"Unlocking the Air and Other Stories\" was one of three finalists for the 1997 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. Other awards won by Le Guin include three James Tiptree Jr. Awards, two World Fantasy Awards, and three Jupiter Awards. She won her final Hugo and Locus awards in the year of her death, for the essay collection \"No Time to Spare: Thinking About What Matters\", and an anthology of the Hainish cycle, respectively.\nOther awards were for Le Guin's contributions to speculative fiction. She was voted a Gandalf Grand Master Award by the World Science Fiction Society in 1979. The Science Fiction Research Association gave her its Pilgrim Award in 1989 for her \"lifetime contributions to SF and fantasy scholarship\". At the 1995 World Fantasy Convention she won the World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement. She became a member of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame in 2001. The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America made her its 20th Grand Master in 2003. She was the second, and as of 2019, one of only six women to receive that honor. In 2010, Le Guin was awarded the Lyman Tower Sargent Distinguished Scholar Award by the North American Society for Utopian Studies. In 2013, she was given the Eaton Award by the University of California, Riverside, for lifetime achievement in science fiction.\nLater in her career Le Guin was also recognized her contributions to literature more generally. In April 2000 the U.S. Library of Congress made Le Guin a Living Legend in the \"Writers and Artists\" category for her significant contributions to America's cultural heritage. The American Library Association granted her the annual Margaret Edwards Award in 2004, and also selected her to deliver the annual May Hill Arbuthnot Lecture. The Edwards Award recognizes one writer and a particular body of work: the 2004 panel cited the first four \"Earthsea\" volumes, \"The Left Hand of Darkness\" and \"The Beginning Place\". The panel said that Le Guin \"has inspired four generations of young adults to read beautifully constructed language, visit fantasy worlds that inform them about their own lives, and think about their ideas that are neither easy nor inconsequential\". At its 2009 convention, the Freedom From Religion Foundation awarded the Emperor Has No Clothes Award to Le Guin. A collection of Le Guin's works was published by the Library of America in 2016, an honor only rarely given to living writers. The National Book Foundation awarded Le Guin its Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters, stating that she had \"defied conventions of narrative, language, character, and genre, and transcended boundaries between fantasy and realism to forge new paths for literary fiction\". The American Academy of Arts and Letters made her a member in 2017.\nLegacy and influence.\nLe Guin strongly influenced the field of speculative fiction. Jo Walton argued that Le Guin was important in both making the genre more open and accepting of new ideas, and in helping genre writers get mainstream success. \"A Wizard of Earthsea\" introduced the idea of a \"wizard school\", which would later be made more famous by the \"Harry Potter\" series of books, and with popularizing the trope of a boy wizard, also present in \"Harry Potter\".\nLe Guin created the word \"ansible\" for an instantaneous interstellar communication device in 1966. Several other writers, including Orson Scott Card and Neil Gaiman, used the word later. The notion that names can exert power is also present in Hayao Miyazaki's 2001 film \"Spirited Away\"; critics have suggested that that idea started with Le Guin's Earthsea series.\nAdaptations of her work.\nLe Guin's works have been adapted for radio, film, television, and theater.\nMovies.\nHer 1971 novel \"The Lathe of Heaven\" has been adapted twice, in 1979 by WNET with Le Guin's participation, and the in 2002 by the A&amp;E Network. In a 2008 interview, she said 1979 adaptation is \"the only good adaptation to\" a movie of her work to date. In the early 1980s Hayao Miyazaki asked to create an animated adaptation of Earthsea. Le Guin, who was unfamiliar with his work and anime in general, initially turned down the offer, but later accepted after seeing \"My Neighbor Totoro\". The third and fourth Earthsea books were used as the basis of \"Tales from Earthsea\", released in 2006. Miyazaki's son, Gor\u014d Miyazaki directed the movie, not Hayao Miyazaki himself. Le Guin was disappointed by the change. Le Guin was positive about how the movie looked. She wrote that \"much of it was beautiful\", but she did not like the moral sense of the movie. She disliked the physical violence, especially the death of a villain as the movie's ending. In 2004 the Sci Fi Channel adapted the first two books of the Earthsea trilogy as the miniseries \"Legend of Earthsea\". Le Guin was highly critical of the adaptation, calling it a \"far cry from the Earthsea I envisioned\", objecting to the use of white actors for her red-, brown-, or black-skinned characters.\nTheater.\nLe Guin's novel \"The Left Hand of Darkness\" and novella \"Paradises Lost\" have both been adapted for theater. In 1995, Chicago's Lifeline Theatre presented its adaptation of \"The Left Hand of Darkness\". Reviewer Jack Helbig at the Chicago Reader wrote that the \"adaptation is intelligent and well crafted but ultimately unsatisfying\", mainly because it is extremely difficult to compress a complex 300-page novel into a two-hour stage presentation. She also said she was better pleased with stage adaptations, including \"Paradises Lost\", than screen adaptations of her work till date. In 2013, the Portland Playhouse and Hand2Mouth Theatre produced a stage adaptation of \"The Left Hand of Darkness\", directed and adapted by Jonathan Walters, with text adapted by John Schmor. The play opened May 2, 2013, and ran until June 16, 2013, in Portland, Oregon.\nOpera.\n\"Paradises Lost\" was adapted into an opera at the University of Illinois. The opera was composed by Stephen A. Taylor; the libretto has been attributed both to Kate Gale and to Marcia Johnson. Adapted in 2005, the opera premiered in April 2012. Le Guin described the effort as a \"beautiful opera\" in an interview, and expressed hopes that it would be picked up by other producers.\nBooks.\nHainish Cycle (science fiction).\nx"}

He led a mutiny (take over) to stop Lieutenant William Bligh returning to England. (See Mutiny on the Bounty). He left Bligh and 18 seaman in a small boat, and went back to Tahiti in the \"Bounty\". Christian and some of the other sailors then sailed to Pitcairn Island to live. Christian was later killed in a fight between the Tahitian men and the seamen.\nEarly life.\nChristian was born in 1764 at the family home of \"Moorland Close\", near Brigham, Cumbria. He was one of 10 children of Charles Christian and Ann Dixon. He could trace his ancestry back to William the Conqueror. The name Christian is an English way of saying the Manx name \"McCrystyn\". Fletcher's mother came from Cumberland and he was named after his grandmother, Mary Fletcher. After his father died, Christian went to sea. He was 18 years old. He was a sailor on the ship 'Cambridge'. William Bligh was also on the ship. Christian later sailed on two trips with Bligh to Jamaica on the ship 'Britannia'.\nAfter the mutiny.\nAfter the mutiny, Christian wanted to settle on the island of Tubuai. The sailors were scared of the natives who lived on the island. The sailors went back to Tahiti. Christian married Maimiti, the daughter of one of the chiefs on June 16, 1789. He then left Tahiti with 8 of the mutineers, 13 Tahitian women and six men. They sailed to the remote Pitcairn Island. Sixteen sailors from the Bounty stayed at Tahiti. At Pitcairn they took everything they could from the Bounty. After that Matthew Quintal set it on fire. The sexual imbalance (more men than women) and the slavery of the Tahitian men by the mutineers led to fighting and the deaths of most of the men. Fletcher Christian was killed in the fighting. He had a son with Maimiti, Thursday October Christian and two additional children."}

They are found in marine strata from the earliest Triassic to the Cretaceous, though the early proto-ichthyosaurs are sometimes put in the broader category of Ichthyopterygia. After transitional Triassic types like \"Mixosaurus\" and \"Cymbospondylus\", they have essentially the same body shape. \"Californosaurus\" was one of the first to have the typical dolphin-like body shape.\nAlthough isolated ichthyosaur vertebrae are quite common, the first fossil which showed the ichthyosaur form was found by Mary Anning (1799\u20131847) and her brother Joseph. Mary Anning was an early British fossil collector, dealer and paleontologist. Many of her finds may be seen today at the Natural History Museum, London.\nEarly discoveries.\nThe genus \"Ichthyosaurus\" was first described in 1699 from fossil fragments discovered in Wales. The first fossil vertebrae were published twice in 1708. The first complete ichthyosaur fossil was found in 1811 by Mary Anning in Lyme Regis, along the Jurassic Coast. She later discovered three separate species.\nThe first major find.\nMary Anning's first great discovery was made shortly after her father's death when she was just twelve. In 1810 her bother Joseph found what he thought was a crocodile skull, but the rest of the animal was not in evidence. Mary kept searching and a year later a storm weathered away part of the cliff and exposed part of the rest of the skeleton of the 17\u00a0ft (5.2m) long creature, which she was able to dig out of the cliff and collect with a little help from local quarrymen.p33\u201341 Anning later discovered three more species.\nInterpretation.\nIn 1821 William Conybeare and Mary\u2019s old friend Henry De la Beche, published a paper which analyzed the specimens found by Mary and others. They concluded that ichthyosaurs were a previously unknown kind of marine reptile, and they decided there had been at least three species.\nAnatomy.\nIchthyosaurs were reptiles that evolved fish-shaped body outlines. Some of their characteristics were unique: they had enormous eyeballs, sometimes more than 25\u00a0cm in diameter. They had large hands ('manus') with up to 20 bones in a single digit, and up to 10 digits per manus.\nThey had streamlined form, paddles, fish-like tail, and no neck. Ichthyosaurs averaged about 2\u20134m (6\u201313\u00a0ft) in length; a few were smaller, and some species grew much larger. They had a porpoise-like head and a long, toothed snout. Built for speed, like modern tuna, some ichthyosaurs appear also to have been deep divers, like some modern whales. It has been estimated that ichthyosaurs could swim at speeds up to . Similar to modern cetaceans such as whales and dolphins, they were air-breathing.\nWeight.\nAccording to weight estimates by Ryosuke Motani, a \"Stenopterygius\" weighed around whilst a \"Ophthalmosaurus icenicus\" weighed 930\u2013950\u00a0kg (1.03\u20131.04 short tons).\nBody size and metabolism.\nScientists have wondered whether ancient reptiles like ichthyosaurs were warm-blooded or cold-blooded. Scientists from the University of Plymouth studied many animals that dive and hold their breath, from insects to whales. They found that larger animals can hold their breath longer than smaller animals because they can store more oxygen for their size, and they found this difference was much bigger for warm-blooded animals than for cold-blooded animals. They said this could be why modern whales became so large. They concluded that the large size of ichthyosaurs, like whales, meant they were more likely to be warm-blooded than cold-blooded.\nConvergent evolution.\nBiologist Stephen Jay Gould said the ichthyosaur was his favourite example of convergent evolution. Its similarities to fish are not \"homologous\", caused by common descent, but \"analogous\", caused by selection in the same environment:\nEyes.\nThe eyes of ichthyosaurs are large in comparison to the size of the body, suggesting they hunted by sight even in dimly-lit waters or at night. In fact, ichthyosaurs hold the record for eye size: the largest was 264mm in diameter (~10.4\u00a0inches), from the species \"Temnodontosaurus platyodon\". This is the largest eye ever recorded for any vertebrate; the colossal squid eye is larger still. The eyes of ichthyosaurs are protected by sclerotic rings. These are circlar bony plates inside the outer edges of the cornea of the eye. Their function is mechanical support of the eye. They are well preserved in fossil ichthyosaur skulls.\nFins.\nAt first, the downward-pointing tail bones were hard to interpret. Then, later in the 19th century, a remarkable find was made. Some specimens of \"Mixosaurus\" and \"Stenopterygius\" were well preserved in the black mudstones of Germany. These fossils were preserved in such fine sediment that the fossils were almost perfect, with only a few bones disturbed or missing. The outline of the body shape could be seen as a thin carbon film.p10 Even though the soft parts had rotted away long ago, they left their imprint behind. For the first time, scientists could see clearly that the tail of ichthyosaurus was shaped like the tail of a fish. And on its back, like a shark, there was a dorsal fin.\nLive birth.\nLive birth was always assumed for ichthyosaurs, because with their paddles they could never have manoeuvred on land to lay eggs like turtles do. As reptiles, they produced cleidoic eggs, but they were entirely aquatic and their eggs developed inside the mother. Once more, evidence came from the early Jurassic of Germany, where several fine examples clearly show embryos inside the rib cage of the adult. Other examples exist of the young actually being born.p125 They came out tail first. No doubt, some complication of birth had killed both mother and offspring together.\nA recent study of the earliest ichthosaur, \"Chaohusaurus\", from the Lower Triassic shows an early example of live birth. A remarkable feature was a baby close to emerging \"head-first\". The authors comment:\nIn other words, ichthyosaurs gave live birth when they were still land dwellers. Then, later, they adapted to an aquatic life.\nExtinction.\nIchthyosaurs became extinct during the Upper Cretaceous, about 30 million years before the K/T extinction event. There was an ocean anoxic event at the Cenomanian\u2013Turonian stage boundary. The deeper layers of the seas became anoxic and poisoned by hydrogen sulphide (H2S). As life died off in the lower (benthos) levels of the sea, so did the predators at the top of the food chain. The last pliosaurs and ichthyosaurs became extinct.p251\nIchthyosaurs had been dwindling in numbers for some time; they were no longer the force they once were in the Upper Triassic and Lower Jurassic. By the middle Jurassic, it was thought thought they all belonged to the single clade, the Ophthalmosauridae. By the Cretaceous it was thought that only three genera survived. For the last 50+ years it has been thought that only one genus, \"Platypterygius\", was known at the time of the anoxic event in the Upper Cretaceous.\nHowever, a recent review looked at the main collections in western European museums. This review found evidence for four genera of ichthyosaur only a few million years before the extinction event.\nThese genera occupied various \"feeding guilds\". They were:\nThis means that there was still diversity in ichthyosaurs a few million years before the extinction event. They may have survived right up to the extinction event.\nIt is true, though, that the ichthyosaurs had declined from their peak. By the Cretaceous they certainly had more competitors than in the Triassic, and more elusive prey. The adaptive radiation of teleost fish meant their new prey were fast swimming and highly evasive. The teleosts also included fast-swimming predatory fish, which must have been competitors. From what we know now, the ocean anoxic event must have ended the last ichthyosaurs.\nThe ichthyosaurs and pliosaurs were replaced in the marine ecology by the giant mosasaurs. The mosasaurs were probably ambush hunters, whose sit-and-wait strategy apparently proved most successful."}

The babies were born tail first to prevent them from drowning in the water.\nHundreds of well-preserved, fossilised skeletons have been found in Jurassic rock at Holzmaden.

Like other ichthyosaurs, \"Cymbospondylus\" probably gave birth to live young, as it had no way to lay eggs. These, on reaching adult size, probably had few, if any, predators that could harm them.\nThe eel-like tail of \"Cymbospondylus\" made up almost half the total body length, and it is possible that the tail was used as a primary swimming mechanism.

He was best known for the powerful positions he held in the 1990s when Boris Yeltsin was president of Russia.\nBerezovsky was deputy secretary of Russia's security council, and a friend of Boris Yeltsin's daughter Tatyana. He had a lot of power over what the newspapers were allowed to print and what the television stations could say. They were not allowed to say anything bad about Yeltsin.\nBerezovsky made his fortune importing Mercedes cars into Russia in the 1990s. He made a lot of money from Avtovaz cars and he owned the Sibneft oil company.\nWhen Putin came to power Berezovsky fled to London where he was given political asylum. He said that he was trying to put an end to Putin's power. The Russian authorities accused him of trying to murder several leading critics of Putin's regime, including Alexander Litvinenko and journalist Anna Politkovskaya, in order to make Putin look bad. The Swiss accused him of taking money illegally.\nIn 1994 someone tried to kill Berezovsky. Several other people may have tried to kill him. He said these people were Russian agents.\nBerezovsky died on 23 March 2013 in Sunninghill, Berkshire, England, aged 67. He lived in London, England. On March 25, police said that his death was caused by hanging. There were no signs of a struggle.\nInvestigation of his death.\nOn 23 March 2013, Berezovsky was found dead at his home. His body was found by a bodyguard in a locked bathroom, with a ligature around his neck. His death was announced in a post on Facebook by his son-in-law. Alexander Dobrovinsky, a lawyer who represented Berezovsky, wrote that he may have committed suicide. He added that Berezovsky had fallen into debt after losing a protracted lawsuit against Roman Abramovich, and had spent the last few months of his life selling his possessions to cover his court costs. Berezovsky was also said to have recently been depressed and to have isolated himself from friends. He reportedly suffered from depression and was taking antidepressant drugs. A day before his death he told a reporter in London that he had nothing left to live for.\nWhen Berezovsky's death became known, there was speculation by mainstream British news media that Moscow might be somehow involved. The Thames Valley Police classified his death as \"unexplained\" and launched a formal investigation into the circumstances behind it. Specialists in chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear materials were sent to Berezovsky's home as a \"precaution\". These specialists later \"found nothing of concern\".\nA post-mortem examination carried out by the Home Office pathologist found the cause of death was consistent with hanging and there was nothing pointing to a violent struggle. However, after an inquest into the death in March 2014 the coroner, Mr Peter Bedford, recorded an open verdict commenting, \"I am not saying Mr Berezovsky took his own life, I am not saying Mr Berezovsky was unlawfully killed. What I am saying is that the burden of proof sets such a high standard it is impossible for me to say\".\nDespite his death in March 2013 Berezovsky's Interpol Red Notice continues to remain active."}

Whether it hopped on two legs or ran bipedally is still a matter of debate.

It is the capital city of Greece and the most important financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural center of the country. \nIt is also one of the world's oldest cities. Scholars disagree on whether the city is named for the goddess Athena, or the goddess for the city. Athens has a population of about 4 million people and is growing. It is in the prefecture, or division of the country, of Attica. Its port, Piraeus, is the largest passenger port in Europe, and the second largest port in the world. \nAthens has a borderline cold semi-arid climate (\"BSk\" in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification) and a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (\"Csa\" in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification). The average rainfall is relatively low, due to the rain shadow from the Parnitha mountains. Frost is infrequent and snow does not occur every winter.\nHistory of Athens.\nAncient Athens was a powerful city in Classical times. It was known for its philosophy and learning. The city was home to various ancient philosophers. Its schools of philosophy included Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum. \nThe Parthenon, a temple dedicated to the goddess Athena, is the most famous of its ancient monuments. It was built between 447 BC and 438 BC and its decoration continued until 431 BC. Athens had its own Constitution and it created the world's first known democracy.\nThe city started to decline in 529 AD, when the Emperor Justinian I closed its philosophical schools. The Parthenon was made a Christian church. That saved it later from the destruction of non-Christian temples, in the theocracy which followed Justinian's conversion..\nThe Ottoman Turks took control of Athens in 1458. The Turks made the Parthenon into a Muslim mosque. The Parthenon was later damaged in 1687 when gunpowder exploded inside it.\nAthens was freed from the Turks during the Greek War of Independence (18211833). It was an unimportant little town then, but the Greeks made it their capital.\nAthens is home to two UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the Acropolis of Athens and the 11th century Daphni Monastery.\nMuseums.\nThere are many museums in the city. Some of the most important ones are:\nInfrastructure.\nThe Athens International airport \"Eleftherios Venizelos\" is the largest international airport in Greece and it opened in 2001.\nThe Athens Metro, inaugurated in January 2000, is the only metro system in Greece. It has a total of three lines. It is famous for many of its stations that feature works of art and displays of the archeological remains found during its construction.\nThe Athens Tram has a total length of 27 km and covers ten Athenian suburbs from Syntagma Square (the central square of Athens) to the southwestern part of the city. The tram network is still under construction as it will be extended toward the port of Piraeus.\nThe Attiki Odos is a modern motorway system that runs in the greater Athens metropolitan area and has a total length of 65 kilometres.\nSister cities.\nAthens has these sister cities:"}

It was governed from the capital of Lima. \nHistory.\nIn 1542, the Spanish created the Viceroyalty of New Castilla, that shortly afterwards would be called the Viceroyalty of Peru. In 1544, Holy Roman Emperor Charles V (King Charles I of Spain) named \"Blasco N\u00fa\u00f1ez Vela\" Peru's first viceroy, but the viceroyalty was not organized until the arrival of Viceroy Francisco de Toledo in 1572. \nFrancisco de Toledo, \"one of the great administrators of human times\", established the Inquisition and created laws that applied to both Indians and Spanish alike. So he broke the power of the encomenderos and reduced the old system of forced native labor. He improved the safety in the viceroyalty with fortifications, bridges and \"la Armada del Mar del Sur\" (the Southern Fleet) against the pirates. \nThe Amazon basin and some large regions nearby had been considered Spanish territory since the Treaty of Tordesillas. But this treaty meant not much during the time Spain controlled Portugal (1580 - 1640). \nThe first Jesuit reduction to convert and \"civilize\" the Indigenous population was founded in 1609, but some areas were occupied by Brazilians as Bandeirantes gradually extended their activities throughout much of the basin and adjoining Matto Grosso in the 17th and 18th centuries. These groups had the advantage of remote geography and river access from the mouth of the Amazon (which was in Portuguese territory) making it impossible for the Spanish authorities to control them. One famous attack upon a Spanish mission in 1628 resulted in the enslavement of 60 000 indigenous people. In fact as time passed they were used as a self funding occupation force by the Portuguese authorities in what was effectively a low level war of territorial conquest. Finally the reality of the situation was recognized with the transfer of sovereignty over the much of the basin and surrounding areas to Portugal in the 1750 Treaty of Madrid."}

The location of Vilcabamba was forgotten.\nThe ruins of the city were rediscovered by Hiram Bingham in 1909 in a remote forest site 130\u00a0km west of Cuzco, but he failed to realize its significance, because he believed that Machu Picchu, which he also rediscovered, was the fabled \"Lost City of the Incas\".

These are the \"great apes\", living and extinct. At present there are humans, chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans.\nThe word \"hominid\" has been used in various ways. The classification of the great apes has been revised several times in the last few decades. These revisions led to different uses of the word \"hominid\". The original meaning of the taxon Hominidae meant only humans and their closest relatives. Now this group is called the Hominina.\nThe primatological term hominid is easily confused with a number of similar words:\nThe dispute is really about whether humans and Australopithecines are sufficiently different from chimpanzees to rank as a separate family. In morphology and life style they are, in genetics they are not.\nA move from rainforest to savannah and woodland led first to bipedalism (walking on two feet). Later, hunting and social needs led to larger brains and the making and use of tools. These differences between human beings and the other great apes are certainly important. However, a genetically based taxonomic classification shows the genetic differences are not enough to divide us into separate families. Genetics, rather than morphology, is generally more widely accepted as the critical standard. However, many scientists, including anthropologists, use the term \"hominid\" to mean humans and their direct and near-direct ancestors."}

In the case of miaphysitism, the separate things are Jesus' divine and human traits. \nMiaphysitism has often been considered by Chalcedonian Christians to be a form of monophysitism, but the Oriental Orthodox Churches themselves reject this characterization, Recently, the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic Churches have begun to take this position more seriously."}

It says that Christ only has one nature, namely the divine one.\nViews.\nThere are two main doctrines that can be called Monophysite ():\nEutychianism.\nEutychianism says that the human and divine natures of Christ were combined into one new single (mono) nature: his human nature was \"dissolved like a drop of honey in the sea\".\nApollinarism.\nApollinarism or Apollinarianism says that Christ had a human body and human \"living principle\" but that the Divine Logos had taken the place of the \"nous\", or \"thinking principle\" . This is analogous but not identical to what might be called a mind in the present day.\nOpposition.\nAfter Nestorianism, taught by Nestorius, Archbishop of Constantinople, was refused at the First Council of Ephesus, Eutyches, an archimandrite at Constantinople came up with new views. Monophysitism and Eutyches were also refused at the Council of Chalcedon in 451. \nMonophysitism is also rejected by the Oriental Orthodox Churches, but was widely accepted in Syria, the Levant, and Egypt. This caused many tensions in the early days of the Byzantine Empire.\nLater, Monothelitism was developed as an attempt to bridge the gap between the Monophysite and the Chalcedonian position, but it too was rejected by the members of the Chalcedonian synod, despite at times having the support of the Byzantine emperors and one of the Popes of Rome, Honorius I. Some are of the opinion that Monothelitism was at one time held by the Maronites, but the Maronite community, for the most part, dispute this, stating that they have never been out of communion with the Catholic Church.\nMiaphysitism, the christology of the Oriental Orthodox churches, is sometimes considered a variant of Monophysitism, but these churches view their theology as distinct from Monophysitism and anathematize Eutyches."}

He won the Stanley Cup, a trophy for the best hockey team, two times with the Canadiens, in 1916 and 1924. V\u00e9zina played in 327 consecutive regular season games and 39 playoff games, before leaving early during a game in 1925 due to illness. V\u00e9zina was diagnosed with tuberculosis, and died on March 27, 1926. He was nicknamed the Chicoutimi Cucumber.\nThe only goaltender to play for the Canadiens between 1910 and 1925, V\u00e9zina helped the team win the Stanley Cup in 1916 and 1924, while going to the Stanley Cup Finals three more times. V\u00e9zina allowed the fewest goals against in the league seven times in his career: four times in the NHA and three times in the NHL. In 1918, V\u00e9zina became the first NHL goaltender to record a shutout and the first to earn an assist on a goal. At the start of the 1926\u201327 NHL season, the Canadiens donated the Vezina Trophy to the NHL as an award to the goaltender who allowed the fewest goals during the season. Since 1981, the award has been given to the best goaltender as chosen by a vote of NHL general managers. In V\u00e9zina's hometown of Chicoutimi, the sports arena is named the Centre Georges-V\u00e9zina in honour of V\u00e9zina. When the Hockey Hall of Fame opened in 1945, V\u00e9zina was one of the original twelve inductees.\nPersonal life.\nGeorges V\u00e9zina, the youngest of eight children, was born on January 21, 1887 in Chicoutimi, Quebec, to Jacques V\u00e9zina, a local baker and an immigrant from St. Nicolas de La Rochelle in France, and his wife Clara. V\u00e9zina attended school at the Petit S\u00e9minaire de Chicoutimi until the age of fourteen, when he left the school to help at his father's bakery. He played hockey from a young age, participating in informal street hockey matches with others his own age. V\u00e9zina played in these matches in his shoes, and used skates for the first time at age sixteen when he joined the local team in Chicoutimi. As Chicoutimi was in a remote area of Quebec, more than 200 kilometres from Quebec City, the hockey club was not in any organised league. Instead or scheduled games the club, known as the Saguen\u00e9ens (\"People from the Saguenay\", the region where Chicoutimi is located), toured the province, playing informal games against different clubs.\nV\u00e9zina married Marie-Ad\u00e9la\u00efde-Stella Morin on June 3, 1908 in Chicoutimi. After V\u00e9zina's death, it was reported that he had twenty-two children. This rumour was started when the Canadiens' manager, Leo Dandurand, told newspapers that V\u00e9zina \"speaks no English and has twenty-two children, including three sets of triplets, and they were all born in the space of nine years.\" The V\u00e9zinas actually only had two children and Georges spoke some English. In 1912 they had their first child, a son named Jean-Jules. A second son was born the night of the Montreal Canadiens' first Stanley Cup win in 1916. To honour the event, Georges named the child Marcel Stanley. When not playing hockey, V\u00e9zina operated a tannery in Chicoutimi, living a quiet life.\nPlaying career.\nNHA.\nOn February 17, 1910, the Chicoutimi Hockey Club played an informal game against the Montreal Canadiens, a professional team in the National Hockey Association. Though playing an weaker team the Canadiens did not score a goal, losing the game. This prompted Joseph Cattarinich, goaltender for the Canadiens, to convince his team to offer a tryout to Georges V\u00e9zina, who was Chicoutimi's goaltender. V\u00e9zina at first refused the offer, staying in Chicoutimi until the Canadiens later returned in December of that year. This time they convinced Georges, along with his brother Pierre, to come to Montreal. The two V\u00e9zina brothers arrived on December 22, 1910. While Pierre failed to make the team, Georges impressed the Canadiens, especially with the use of his stick to block shots. V\u00e9zina was signed to a contract for C$800 per season, and made his professional debut December 31, 1910 against the Ottawa Senators. He would play all sixteen games for the Canadiens in the 1910\u201311 season, finishing with eight wins and eight losses, while giving up the fewest goals in the league.\nThe following season V\u00e9zina again had the fewest goals against in the league, and won eight games, along with ten losses. V\u00e9zina recorded his first career shutout during the 1912\u201313 season, defeating Ottawa 6\u20130 on January 18, 1913 for one of his nine wins in the season. The Canadiens finished first in the NHA for the first time in 1913\u201314, in a tie with the Toronto Blueshirts. Once again, V\u00e9zina led the league with the fewest goals against, while posting thirteen victories and seven losses. Under the NHA rules, the first place team would play in the Stanley Cup Finals, but due to the tie for first, the Canadiens had to play a two-game, total goals series against Toronto. V\u00e9zina shut out the Blueshirts in the first game, a 2\u20130 win for Montreal, but let in six goals in the second game, allowing the Blueshirts to play for the Stanley Cup, which they won.\nAfter losing fourteen games and finishing last in the NHA in 1914\u201315, V\u00e9zina and the Canadiens won sixteen games during the 1915\u201316 season, and the team ended up first in the league. As league leaders, the Canadiens were chosen to play in the 1916 Stanley Cup Finals, where they played against the Portland Rosebuds, champions of the rival Pacific Coast Hockey Association. The Canadiens defeated the Rosebuds three games to two in the best of five games series, winning the Stanley Cup for the first time in team history. V\u00e9zina's second son was born the night of the fifth game, which coupled with a bonus of $238 each member of the Canadiens received for the championship, led to him considering the series as the best part of his career. The next season V\u00e9zina again led the NHA with the fewest goals against, the fourth time in seven years he did so, helping the Canadiens to again reach the Stanley Cup Finals, where they lost to the Seattle Metropolitans.\nNHL.\nThe NHA was replaced by the National Hockey League (NHL) in November 1917, with V\u00e9zina and the Canadiens joining the new league. On February 18, 1918, he became the first goaltender in NHL history to record a shutout by defeating the Torontos 9\u20130. On December 28, 1918, he became the first goaltender to have an assist, on a goal by Newsy Lalonde, who had took the puck after a save by V\u00e9zina. He finished the season with twelve wins, allowing the fewest goals against. V\u00e9zina also set a record, which was shared with Clint Benedict of the Ottawa Senators, for the fewest shutouts needed to lead the league in that category, with one.\nIn 1918\u201319 V\u00e9zina won ten games, and helped the Canadiens defeat the Ottawa Senators in the NHL playoffs for the ability to play for the Stanley Cup against the PCHA champion, the Seattle Metropolitans. Held in Seattle, the two teams were tied in the best of five series when it was cancelled due to the Spanish flu epidemic, the first time the Stanley Cup was not awarded. In the ten playoff games prior to the cancellation, V\u00e9zina had won six games, lost three and tied one, with one shutout. V\u00e9zina recorded nearly identical records the next two seasons, with thirteen wins and eleven losses and a goals against average above four in both 1919\u201320 and 1920\u201321. He won twelve games the following season, as the Canadiens again failed to qualify for the Stanley Cup.\nAfter winning thirteen games in 1922\u201323, V\u00e9zina led the Canadiens into the NHL playoffs, where they lost the two game, total goal series to the Ottawa Senators, who would win the Stanley Cup. The following season saw V\u00e9zina return to leading the league in fewest goals against. His average of 1.97 goals per game was the first time a goaltender had averaged fewer than two goals against per game. With another thirteen win season in 1923\u201324, the Canadiens reached the NHL playoffs, where they again faced the Ottawa Senators. This time the Canadiens won the series, then defeated the Vancouver Maroons of the PCHA before reaching the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in five years. Playing the Calgary Tigers of the Western Canada Hockey League, V\u00e9zina and the Canadiens won the best of three series two games to none, as V\u00e9zina recorded a shutout in the second game. The championship was the Canadiens' first as a member of the NHL and second as a club. After a seventeen win season in 1924\u201325 where V\u00e9zina recorded a goals against average of 1.81 to again lead the league, the Canadiens reached the Stanley Cup Finals. The Canadiens only qualified after the Hamilton Tigers, the regular season champions, were suspended for refusing to play in the playoffs unless they were paid more. Facing the Victoria Cougars, the Canadiens lost the series three games to one.\nReturning to Montreal for training camp for the 1925\u201326 season, V\u00e9zina was noticeably sick, though he said nothing about it. By the time of the Canadiens first game on November 28 against the Pittsburgh Pirates, he had lost 35 pounds in a span of six weeks, and had a fever of 102 Fahrenheit. Even so, he took to the ice, and completed the first period without allowing a goal. V\u00e9zina began vomiting blood in the intermission before returning for the start of the second period. He then collapsed in his goal area, and left the game, with former US Olympic team goaltender Alphonse Lacroix taking his place.\nThe day after the game, V\u00e9zina was diagnosed with tuberculosis and advised to return home. He made a last trip into the Canadiens dressing room on December 3 to say a final goodbye to his teammates. Dandurand would later describe V\u00e9zina as sitting in his corner of the dressing room with \"tears rolling down his cheeks. He was looking at his old pads and skates that Eddie Dufour [the Canadiens trainer] had arranged in Georges's corner. Then, he asked one little favour\u2014the sweater he had worn in the last world series.\" V\u00e9zina returned to his hometown of Chicoutimi with his wife Marie, where he died in the early hours on March 27, 1926 at l'H\u00f4tel-Dieu. Though he played only one period for the Canadiens during the entire season, the team paid his entire $6,000 salary, showing how important V\u00e9zina had been to the team.\nLegacy.\nOne of the best goaltenders in the NHA and early NHL, V\u00e9zina led the Canadiens to five Stanley Cup Finals, where they won the Cup twice. Seven times in his career, V\u00e9zina had the lowest goals against average in the league he played, and he had the second best average another five times. From when he joined the Canadiens in 1910, until having to retire in 1925, V\u00e9zina never missed a game or allowed another person to replace him, playing in 328 regular season games and an additional 39 playoff games in a row. Though he played most of his career in an era when goaltenders could not leave their feet to make a save (the rule was changed in 1918), V\u00e9zina is considered as one of the greatest goaltenders in hockey history; the \"Montreal Standard\" referred to him as the \"greatest goaltender of the last two decades\" in their obituary.\nWell liked in Montreal, V\u00e9zina was often seen as the best player on the ice for the Canadiens, and was respected by his teammates, who considered him a leader of the team. Referred to as \"le Concombre de Chicoutimi\" (the \"Chicoutimi Cucumber\") for his cool actions on the ice, he was also known as \"l'Habitant silencieux\" (the \"silent Habitant\", Habitant being a nickname for the Canadiens), because of his quiet personality. He often sat in a corner of the team's dressing room alone, smoking a pipe and reading the newspaper. When news of V\u00e9zina's death was announced, newspapers across Quebec paid tribute to the goalie with articles about his life and career. Hundreds of Catholic masses were held in honour of the devout V\u00e9zina, and more than 1500 people went to the Chicoutimi cathedral for his funeral.\nAnother legacy of V\u00e9zina was the trophy named after him. At the start of the 1926\u201327 season, Leo Dandurand, Leo Letourneau and Joseph Cattarinich, owners of the Montreal Canadiens, donated the Vezina Trophy to the NHL in honour of V\u00e9zina. It was to be awarded to the goaltender of the team who allowed the fewest goals during the regular season. The inaugural winner of the trophy was V\u00e9zina's successor in goal for the Canadiens, George Hainsworth. He also won the trophy the next two seasons. In 1981, the NHL changed the format of awarding the trophy, giving it to the goaltender deemed best in the league, chosen by NHL general managers. The Hockey Hall of Fame was established in 1945 and among the first twelve inductees was V\u00e9zina. In 1998 V\u00e9zina was ranked number 75 on \"The Hockey News\"' list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players. In honour of the first professional athlete to come from Chicoutimi, the city renamed their hockey arena the Centre Georges-V\u00e9zina in 1965."}

{"id": "111342", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=111342", "title": "Sokker", "text": "Sokker Manager is a realistic, browser-based online football manager game (MMOG) with an exclusive 3D match engine and a 2D match engine. The game, developed in Poland, began in early 2004 and currently has 98 FIFA countries which users can register to, and as of February 2012, there were over 52,000 registered users world-wide. Each month, Sokker is voted one of the best sports game on the internet, out of the top 50 sports game.\nThe game is free to play, however there is an optional \"Plus\" service which will give users access to additional in-game tools that can help them progress as a manager. As a manager, you are in complete control of a team, where you must select players and use strategic tactics in order to defeat the opponent.\nGameplay.\nThe basic idea of Sokker is to manage your own football team, trying to promote yourself without going financially bankrupt. To do this, you must buy and sell players, optimizing your teams performance while making money to improve the club. You will also have to be able to use the tactical editor to take advantage of your players skills. However, this all depends on the playing style of a user, each have their own. Whether you play to train up players, or to try to beat your friend, you will encounter many economical and tactical barriers that will force you to expand your knowledge as a manager. Sokker is different to many other soccer management games, due to it having a 2D Flash match viewer and as from 2012, a new exclusive 3D Flash Match Viewer. This enables users to watch their managerial skills in action through the comfort of an animated football match.\nPlayers.\nEach player has 8 main skills, which will define them where they play on the pitch. These are;\nThere are also several other parameters that will affect a player during a game and their career;\nJuniors System.\nOn Sokker, you can choose whether your club will have a youth school or not. This is where young players are coached. The juniors are young players with too little experience or skills to play in official matches. In a youth school, you can occupy up to a maximum of 30 occupants to train. The juniors will stay in the youth school for a set number of weeks, during that time, they will increase in skills as they are coached. For your youths to train however, you will need to assign a Junior Coach. His general appraisal will determine how quickly the juniors will improve their skills. He will also decide when a player is ready for testing in the first team line-up. Your junior coach\u2019s general skill decides on how accurately the general skill of each junior is estimated. The higher the coach level, the more exact the junior level determined. Also, the more matches your junior plays, the more adequately the coach knows his total skill and shows it to you. You are only shown an overall skill of the junior and will not see their individual skills until you contract them when they leave the youth school. However, by playing them in youth matches, managers can use that to estimate their skills and positions.\nTraining.\nIn order for player's skills to increase, players must be properly trained. Most types of training demand that the player played in the selected position during the week, in the friendly/cup game and/or the league game. A player who played in the same position (i.e., as a def) twice during the week will train better than one who played in only one game. Similarly, a player who played in an official match will train better than one who just played in a friendly. If a player played in two different positions during the week, the last match counts. Each player will train at different speeds based up to their hidden individual talent and the coach training them. If a player has a high talent, he is more likely to train faster than a player with a lower talent. When selecting a coach, the feature that counts most is his individual skills; his general appraisal does not influence the effectiveness of training. Select a head coach who has a high ability in training the skill you have chosen for the individual training.\nTactical Editor.\nThe Tactics Editor is used to create your tactics and formations for future matches. You can find it by going to the match orders page of any future match and then clicking on the [Edit] link underneath the pitch image. Or alternatively, you can go to the training page, then at the top, click on \u201cTactics\u201d. There are default tactics that can be used during the match, however users are able to create their own tactic. It is the Tactical Editor, that for many users, defines Sokker from all other online soccer manager games. There are 35 squares in the tactics editor, making the number of tactics you could create limitless, and allowing the user to select where they would like to put a player. However, there is a maximum of 100 tactics you could save. The tactics you create and choose could ultimately be the decider whether a football match is won or lost.\nStadium.\nEvery team has a stadium to host their home games. Optimizing the stadium size, stand types and ticket prices is very important to keep the team's financial health, as revenue coming from tickets is one of the main sources of income of every team.\nThere are four stand types:\nThere are many factors which will affect the attendance at a match, some of these include supporter mood, match type, size of supporters club, ticket prices, weather and stand preferences. It is possible to change the ticket prices from a range of 1 \u00a3 to 150 \u00a3. However, there are also a default price for stand types:\nGrass and Field.\nIn June 2012, Sokker introduced a new modification to grass the playing field. A new aspect, implemented in 2012, includes modifications and implementations around Grass and the Field. These features include;\nPlus features.\nAlthough Sokker is entirely free to play, the game also has a premium feature called Plus. The purchase of Plus unlocks additional features that helps managers with their career, it does not however, give any unfair advantage over other users; \"They just get more fun from the game - if you are not a subscriber, you have the same chance to achieve your goals in Sokker, as those with Plus.\" Match kits, Training effects monitoring, graphs, unlimited access to watch all matches, are just few of the features gained when you subscribe to plus.\nCommunity.\nThe community of Sokker has expanded the enjoyment far beyond the Sokker.org website. There are many supplemented websites and third party add-ons that enhance the Sokker experience. \nAlso, forum exists in many formats. There are international forums, national forums, division forums, friendly league forums, association forums, private forums and many more that enhance the communication between the Sokker users, enhancing the game enjoyment.\nThird Party Tools.\nPrograms and scripts, both standalone and browser-based are welcomed by Sokker as they enhance the experience of Sokker users. Sokker data can be downloaded through XML-files provided on the sokker.org website. Applications and programs take many forms. Managers Assistants such as oSokker and Android Application for Androids and Blackberry playbook generally help managers by organizing various team data and displaying it graphically and/or archiving it. There are also other tools, such as NT Database, designed specifically for NT managers that help NT managers organize the NT players."}

They live in the cold northern seas around North America and Europe.\nDescription.\nWalruses have lots of things similar to true seals and eared seals. Like true seals, they just have a hole for an ear - not ear flaps. Like eared seals, they can rotate their back flippers forward to walk on land. Like both true seals and eared seals, they are very good swimmers and divers. However, walruses do have some features that neither true seals nor eared seals have.\nThe most famous thing about walruses are their \"tusks\". Even though they are called tusks, they are actually teeth growing out of their mouth, a bit like the narwhal. The tusks grow for about 15 years before they reach their full length, which is about for males and for females.\nBoth the male and female walrus grow tusks. They can use it to protect themselves from polar bears and killer whales, and use them when they eat. When they eat bigger prey such as seals and small whales, they first tear them apart with their tusks to make them easier to eat. Another important use of a walrus's tusks is to pull itself out onto the ice. Pushing its tusks into the ice, the walrus gets extra help hauling its huge body out of the sea. This is probably how walruses got their family name \"Odobenidae\", which comes from Greek words meaning \"one that walks with teeth\". They do not walk with their teeth, but it can look as if they do when they pull themselves out of the water. Their tusks can also be used to cut holes in the ice. Tusks are slightly longer and thicker among males, who use them for fighting, dominance and display; the strongest males with the largest tusks typically dominate social groups. Tusks are also used to form and maintain holes in the ice and aid the walrus in climbing out of water onto ice.\nWalruses are very big, even compared to big male sea lions. When they are all grown up, they can weigh more than 3,000 pounds. The walruses that live in the Atlantic Ocean are a little smaller than the ones in the Pacific Ocean. Both kinds like to stay in the cold north. With all their blubber, which can be as much as six inches thick, they are very comfortable in icy water.\nFeatures.\nWalruses are usually brown, but walruses can change colour depending on how warm they are. They are usually different kinds of brown, but as they get warmer, their skin can turn pink. This is because as they get warmer, blood rushes to the skin to try to cool it.\nThe walrus has an air sac under its throat which acts like a flotation bubble and allows it to bob vertically in the water while sleeping. \nThe males have a large penis bone, up to in length, the largest of any land mammal, both in absolute size and relative to body size."}

{"id": "111407", "revid": "1061539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=111407", "title": "Torres Strait", "text": "Torres Strait is the narrow sea between Australia's Cape York and New Guinea. It is about wide and filled with islands, coral reefs and sand banks. The first European to sail through the strait Vanessa uis Vaez de Torres in 1606. There are about 240 islands but only 17 of them have people living on them. While there are about 6,800 Torres Strait Islanders living on the islands, about 42,000 islanders now live on the mainland. The islands belong to Australia and are a part of Queensland. They are governed from Thursday Island by the Torres Strait Regional Authority. They are the only part of Australia to share a border with another country, New Guinea.\nGeography.\nIt is an important sea lane for ships, but because the water is not deep and is filled with many reefs and islands, it is very difficult to sail through safely.\nThe islands are a mix of island types. Some of the islands near New Guinea are low lying islands made from soil washed down from the rivers. The hilly and steep granite islands in the west were once the tops of mountains which became islands when the sea levels rose 8,000 years ago. The islands in the centre are mostly coral cays. The islands in the east of the strait were made by submarine volcanos which grew above the surface of the ocean.\nIn 2009, the islanders asked the Australian government for AU$ 22 million to build new sea walls. Because some of the islands are quite low, rising sea levels and big tides have meant many areas are now being flooded. This has damaged houses and put salt into the fresh water supplies. People may have to leave two of the mud islands, Boigu and Saibai, unless something can be done about the rising sea.\nThe people.\nThe islands' people are called the Torres Strait Islanders. They are Melanesian peoples related to the Papuans of New Guinea. The islanders have their own culture and long history. They traded with the Papuans to the north and the Australian Aboriginal people for thousands of years.\nThe islanders talk two different languages:\nThere is also a language called Brokan (Broken), or Torres Strait Creole. This is a mix of different languages and islander words that started when the islanders started working on ships searching for pearls in the 1860's.\nHistory.\nThe level of the sea was much lower up to 8000 years ago. Torres Strait would not have been covered by water which means people and animals could walk between New Guinea and Australia. Some animals and birds can be found in both New Guinea and Queensland, such as the cassowary. Other animals, such as pigs, arrived in New Guinea after the sea levels rose and closed the land bridge and were not able to get to Australia.\nThere is evidence of people living on the Torres Strait islands for at least 2,500 years. It is likely that people were living there long before that, but rising sea levels will have covered earlier sites.\nEuropean discovery.\nThe first known European to sail through the strait was Luis V\u00e1ez de Torres, a Spanish or Portuguese sailor. He was second-in-command of the Spanish led by the Portuguese Pedro Fernandez de Quir\u00f3s who sailed from Peru to the South Pacific in 1605. After Quiros's ship went back to Mexico, Torres kept going to the Moluccas and then to Manila. He sailed along the south coast of New Guinea. He may have seen Cape York on the Australian mainland, but there is no evidence to prove this. Torres wrote a letter to the Spanish king about his discoveries but this was kept secret until 1762.\nIn 1769 the Scottish geographer Alexander Dalrymple, was translating Spanish letters found in the Philippines in 1762. He read Luis V\u00e1ez de Torres' letter about a passage south of New Guinea. Dalrymple wrote a book, the \"Historical Collection of the Several Voyages and Discoveries in the South Pacific Ocean\" in 1770-1771. This book caused a lot of interest in the idea of an unknown continent. Dalrymple named the strait after Torres. This led Captain James Cook to go on another voyage into the South Pacific. Dalrymple was angry that it was Captain Cook and not him who was put in charge of the expedition which led in 1770 to the discovery of the east coast of Australia. In 1770 Cook sailed through the strait after sailing up the east coast of Australia. He landed on Possession Island and claimed all the land of Australia for Britain.\nWith people like James Cook, William Bligh, and Matthew Flinders exploring and making maps of the strait, many more ships started to sail through it on their way from Sydney to India or Asia. It was still hard for ships, and many were wrecked on the reefs. A Scottish woman, Barbara Thompson, was the only person saved when the ship \"America\" hit a reef in 1842. She was saved by the islanders and lived with them on Prince of Wales Island for five years until another ship came to take her back to Sydney.\nTrade.\nThere was an important pearling business in the strait from the 1860s until about 1970. Pearl-shelling brought many experienced divers from many countries, especially Japan.\nMissionaries.\nThe London Missionary Society arrived on Erub (Darnley Island) in 1871. The islanders still celebrate the coming of the missionaries as \"The Coming of the Light\", and it is holiday every year on the islands.\nGovernment.\nAlthough some of the Torres Strait islands are just off the coast of New Guinea, they were taken over in 1879 by Queensland, then a British colony. In 1978 an agreement between Australia and Papua New Guinea worked out the correct position of the maritime border in the Torres Strait. The Torres Strait also has its own flag. It was designed by Bernard Namok from Thursday Island. It has a background of five stripes, green for the land, blue for the sea, and black for the people. It has a big white Dari, or headress, and a five pointed star for the five main island groups. In 1995 is was officially made a flag of Australia.\nWorld War II.\nIn World War II, Horn Island in Torres Strait, north of Cape York, became Australia's most northerly air base. In 1940 two big runways were built. It was used by thousands of Allied aircraft. With eight Japanese air raids in 1942, it was the most attacked place in Queensland. Conditions on the island were hard for the soldiers, with poor food, not enough water, diseases, and attacks from the Japanese. The airport is still working as the main airport for far north Queensland. It is now a tourist resort, especially well-known for its fishing.\nBooks and music.\nJules Verne wrote about Torres Strait in his novel, \"Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea\". It was a dangerous place where the submarine \"Nautilus\" was stranded for a short time."}

Goals from penalty shootouts are not included.\nA \"flawless\" or \"German\" hattrick is close to the hat-trick described above but is different since the 3 goals have to be scored within a certain period of time. Another example is the \"classic\" or \"perfect\" hat-trick which means that the player scored one goal with each foot ( 1 goal with the right-foot and one goal with the left-foot) and a header.\nOccasionally Germans would award the hatrickees with 3 medals to signify their achievement."}

It is mainly in the Northern Territory, but also in the north of South Australia and western Queensland. It covers about 176,500 square km, about 2.3% of Australia. The Simpson Desert gets less than 150 ml of rain each year. It is made up of big red sand dunes up to high, long and about apart. At most times there is no surface water, but after rain there can be rivers which flow into normally dry lakes. Temperatures in summer can be more than 50 C, and in winter can be below 0 C.\nEarly explorers into the Simpson Desert were Charles Sturt 1845, J.McKinlay, W.O. Hodgkinson, C.Winneke 1883, A.Poeppel 1879. The desert was named after A.A.Simpson, President of the Royal Geographical Society of Australasia in 1929. The first European to cross the desert was Ted Colson in 1936. \nNo proper roads cross the desert. There are many tracks that were made during the search for gas and oil during the 1960s and 1970s. These tracks include the French Line, the Rig Road, and the QAA Line. Such tracks can be driven on by well-equipped four-wheel drive vehicles which must carry extra fuel and water.\nTowns close to the edge of the Simpson Desert include Oodnadatta to the southwest, and Birdsville in the east. On the western side is the Mount Dare hotel and shop. Before 1980, part of the Commonwealth Railways Central Australian line passed along the western side of the Simpson Desert. Within the Simpson people go to see the ruins at Dalhousie Springs, Purnie Bore wetlands, Approdinna Attora Knoll and Poeppel Corner (where Queensland, South Australia and Northern Territory meet)."}

Saint Laurent completed six fashion collections before he was called up for military service in 1960.\nMilitary service was a disaster for Saint Laurent, who was invalided out, suffering from mental illness. The House of Dior fired him, but he was able to set up his own fashion house with backing from an American millionaire. For the rest of his life the Yves Saint Laurent fashion house was at the top of Parisian couture.\nSaint Laurent was openly gay.

The same rocket appears on Earth, takes EVE and returns to outer space, with WALL-E following it.\nAs the rocket returns to the ship, WALL-E notices that all humans had gained weight and lost some bones, while sitting on each chairs, and every robots serve them. The AUTO and Captain McCrea examine EVE's body in the main dock, only to find the plant gone.\nWhen WALL-E inadvertently destroys the security system at the repair ward, he and EVE escape from the hallway. EVE attempts to send WALL-E to the escape pod, but they discover that Gopher placed the plant in the pod, when he stole it from EVE. WALL-E uses a fire extinguisher to save himself and the plant, before the pod self destructs.\nThe robots return to the ship. As McCrea watches each videos EVE recorded on Earth, he realises they must return to Earth. However, AUTO refuses, revealing he stole the plant for Gopher, and its outdated secret directive no-return issued to all AUTOs by BNL inaccurately believing Earth to be to toxic to live and that humans should survive in space forever. A furious McCrea argues how the plant is proof against the directive, but AUTO and Gopher stage a treacherous mutiny: Gopher discards the plant in a waste shaft, WALL-E hides it, before he is electroucted by AUTO and EVE is shut down, and both are sent down to the shaft, and McCrea is trapped in the room.\nEVE wakes up and saves WALL-E from being sent into space. They help all humans and robots take control of the ship. WALL-E is able to prevent AUTO from closing the machine, despite getting crushed afterwards, and McCrea recovers and disables Auto. After the ship returns to Earth, EVE repairs WALL-E's body. Though WALL-E cannot remember EVE, the spark makes them remember each other. The movie ends with all humans and robots restoring all life on Earth."}

He described the Murray, the Murrumbidgee and Darling Rivers. Sturt searched the desert areas of Australia in the hope of finding an inland sea.\nEarly life.\nSturt was born in Bengal, India where his father was a judge. He went to England to go to school and in 1813 he joined the British Army. He served in France and Ireland. In 1826 Sturt went back to England and was then sent to Australia in charge of a group of convicts. He married a lady named Charlotte Christiana Greene\nDarling River Expedition.\nPeople at this time thought that Australia's inland rivers which flowed west, must have flowed into an inland sea. Another explorer, John Oxley had been stopped from going west down the Lachlan and Macquarie Rivers by a marsh which he thought was the edge of the sea. Sir Ralph Darling, Governor of New South Wales thought that it would be easier to travel in a drought (a long time without rain). This would mean the swamps and marshes would be dry. Darling put Sturt in charge. On 10 November 1828, Sturt and a group of 13 men, including explorer Hamilton Hume, went to find the path of the Macquarie River. They followed the Macquarie River, the Bogan River and the Castlereagh River and found the Darling River which he named after the Governor. They followed the river near from the present town of Bourke for about downstream towards the south west. They then went back to Sydney.\nMurrumbidgee - Murray Expedition.\nOn 3 November 1829, Sturt led another group of eight men to follow the path of the Murrumbidgee River. Governor Darling wanted to know where the river went and to find out if it joined the Lachlan River. They went west from Sydney until they reached the Murrumbidgee near the present site of Jugiong and traveled along the river bank as far as the Lachlan River. From there Sturt used a small boat to travel down the river and reached the Murray River on 14 January 1830. The river had already been visited six years earlier by Hamilton Hume and William Hovell and named the Hume River. Sturt, probably hoping for a reward, renamed the river after Sir George Murray, a British politician. After several days, they found a large river joining the Murray from the north, and Sturt correctly guessed that this was the Darling River. He set up a flag pole and raised the British flag, the Union Jack, and had his men give three loud cheers. The group continued down the river and reached Lake Alexandrina which he named after Princess Alexandrina, later Queen Victoria on 9 February 1830. After finding where the Murray entered the sea, the group then had the difficult and tiring work of rowing the boat back up the river. They left the river near the present site of Narrandera on 11 April 1830 and walked back to Sydney, getting there on 25 May 1830. Sturt became very sick after the trip and became blind.\nRetirement from the Army.\nSturt was sent to Norfolk Island in August 1830 on military duty. Norfolk Island was a penal colony where difficult prisoners were sent. He stayed there until January 1832 and then went back to Sydney. Unable to get more important work and still unable to see properly, he went to England and left the army in July 1833. He wrote a book called \"Two Expeditions into the Interior of Southern Australia, 1828\u20141831\". Sturt was rewarded with of land in New South Wales, and in September 1834 sailed to Sydney with his new wife, Charlotte Green.\nFarmer.\nWhen he got back to Australia, he took up land near Canberra, then land at Mittagong, and in 1837 moved to Varroville, a farm near Liverpool. Sturt took a herd of cattle overland to Adelaide in 1838. He did more exploring around Adelaide including a trip back to Lake Alexandrina, and north to St.Vincent's Gulf. He moved his family to Adelaide in 1839.\nGovernment Administrator.\nSturt was made the Surveyor-General (the person in charge of surveying) by the Governor of South Australia, but a new surveyor arrived who had been put in charge by the government in England. He worked as Assistant Land Commissioner until this job was abolished by England. For a short time worked as the Registrar-General, but this job did not pay as much money. He was unhappy, and hoped a new expedition would improve his chances of a better job. He wanted to go into the middle of Australia and look for an inland sea. Another explorer, Edward John Eyre had found his way to the north blocked by what he thought was a huge salt lake, shaped like a horse shoe. It was really six large dry salt lakes. Sturt hoped that he could get around the lakes by going farther to the east.\nCentral Australian Expedition 1844.\nDepot Glen.\nSturt and 16 men left Adelaide on 15 August 1844, with 11 horses, 200 sheep, 32 bullocks, six dogs, a number of carts, wagons and a boat. They followed the Darling River north to Menindee Laidley's Ponds. On 15 January 1845 the group reached a waterhole west of the present site of Milparinka. They called this creek Preservation Creek, and named their camp by the waterhole Depot Glen.\nBecause of the heat and drought, Sturt decided to rest the expedition there for six months. They dug an underground room to try and get away from the heat. It was so hot the lead fell out of their pencils, and the wood of their equipment boxes shrank so much that the screws fell out. The man who was second in charge, an Irish surveyor named James Poole, died from scurvy. His grave can still be seen. Sturt and his men stacked a large pile of rocks to create a cairn on top of Mount Poole. John McDouall Stuart was made second in charge to assist Sturt. When Sturt's eyesight got worse and he became nearly blind, Stuart took over the job of drawing up the maps.\nFort Grey.\nSturt divided the group into two, with one group going back to Adelaide. Following some rain, Sturt moved the other group west to a waterhole on Frome Creek, which they named Fort Grey. His path west was blocked by a dry salt lake, Lake Blanche, so he took a small group north west between Cooper Creek and the Diamantina River. Here he found a desert of stones, called gibbers, which was difficult to cross. The stones hurt the feet of the horses and bullocks. This desert has been named Sturt's Stony Desert. By September 1845 he had reached the Simpson Desert and could go no farther. He went back kilometres to Fort Grey.\nHe then tried to go north, getting close to the present site of Birdsville but again the Stony Desert stopped him. It was very hot, his thermometer burst at 53 degrees Celsius and Sturt decided to go back to Adelaide. He was so sick that he could not ride and had to be carried in a cart. They arrived back on 19 January 1846. He was unhappy as he had not found an inland sea, or reached the centre of Australia.\nReturn to England.\nIn February 1846 Sturt was made Colonial Treasurer, he also received a gold medal from the Royal Geographical Society. He went to England and wrote a book \"Narrative of an Expedition into Central Australia\" before going back to Adelaide. He was made a member of the South Australian parliament. He retired from work at the end of 1851 and in 1853 took his family back to England. He asked to be made Governor of Victoria, and later Governor of Queensland, but it did not happen. He died suddenly in 1869, just after being nominated for K.C.M.G., a British knighthood.\nSturt today.\nCharles Sturt is remembered in Australia with many memorials. There are rock cairns and signs that show many of the places he explored. Two plants were named after him, Sturt's Desert Pea (Swainsona formosa), the floral emblem of South Australia, and Sturt's Desert Rose (Gossypium sturtianum), the floral emblem of the Northern Territory. Sturt found the plant in creeks near the site of Broken Hill, New South Wales in 1844. He collected the seeds and brought them back for Robert Brown (1773\u20131858), a Scottish botanist, to study.\nThe Sturt Highway is the main road between Sydney and Adelaide.\nThe Charles Sturt University is a large university with campuses in country New South Wales. These are in Albury, Bathurst, Dubbo, Orange and Wagga Wagga.\nThe Sturt National Park is a large park in the north west corner of New South Wales. The park covers hectares of semi desert country. There are several historic Sturt sites in the park including Fort Grey."}

It was published by Macmillan &amp; Co. in 1894. The stories tell about life and legends of the Indian jungle. Parts of \"The Jungle Book\" have been adapted to television, movies, the theater, and other media.\nBackground.\nKipling was born in India, and spent the first six years of his life there. After about ten years in England, he went back to India and worked there for about six-and-half years. All of the \"Jungle Book\" stories were published in magazines in 1893-4. The original publications contained illustrations, some by Rudyard's father, John Lockwood Kipling. These books were written when Kipling lived in Vermont.\nThe tales in the book (and also those in \"The Second Jungle Book\" which followed in 1895, and which includes five further stories about Mowgli) are fables, using animals in an anthropomorphic manner to give moral lessons. Kipling put in them nearly everything he knew or \"heard or dreamed about the Indian jungle.\" Other readers have interpreted the work as allegories of the politics and society of the time.\nThe best-known stories are the three about an abandoned 'man cub' Mowgli. They boy is raised by wolves in the Indian jungle. The most famous of the other stories are probably \"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi\", the story of a heroic mongoose, and \"Toomai of the Elephants\", the tale of a young elephant-handler. Kotick, The White Seal seeking for his people a haven where they would be safe from hunters, has been considered a metaphor for Zionism, then in its beginning.\nAs with much of Kipling's work, each of the stories is preceded by a piece of verse, and succeeded by another. The title of each is given in \"italics\" in the list of stories below.\n\"The Jungle Book\", because of its moral tone, came to be used as a motivational book by the Cub Scouts, a junior element of the Scouting movement. This use of the book's universe was approved by Kipling after a direct petition of Robert Baden-Powell, founder of the Scouting movement, who had originally asked for the author's permission for the use of the \"Memory Game\" from \"Kim\" in his scheme to develop the morale and fitness of working-class youths in cities. Akela, the head wolf in The Jungle Book, has become a senior figure in the movement, the name being traditionally adopted by the leader of each Cub Scout pack.\nChapters in The Jungle Book.\nThe complete book, having passed into the public domain, is on-line at Project Gutenberg's official website and elsewhere.\nCharacters.\nAdaptations.\nThe book's text has often been abridged or adapted for younger readers, and there have also been several comic book adaptations."}

It took place on April 3, 2005 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California. The official theme song for the event was \"Big Time\" by The Soundtrack of Our Lives. The secondary theme song was \"Behind Those Eyes\" by 3 Doors Down. The tagline for WrestleMania 21 was \"\"WrestleMania Goes Hollywood\".\"\nThe event was a joint-promotion pay-per-view, featuring performers from the Raw and SmackDown! brands. The main match on the Raw brand was Triple H versus Batista for the World Heavyweight Championship, which Batista won by pinfall after executing a Batista Bomb. The main match on the SmackDown! brand was John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield versus John Cena for the WWE Championship, which Cena won after performing an FU. The featured matches on the undercard included The Undertaker versus Randy Orton, Kurt Angle versus Shawn Michaels, and the first ever Money in the Bank ladder match, which featured six participants from the Raw brand.\nWrestleMania 21 was the first WrestleMania held at the Staples Center, but the fifth to take place in the Southern California metropolitan area (following WrestleMania 2, WrestleMania VII, WrestleMania XII and WrestleMania 2000). Tickets sold out in less than one minute for the event, making it the fastest ticket sell-out in the company's history as well as the fastest ticket sell-out at the Staples Center. The event drew a Staples Center record attendance of 20,193 people from 14 countries and 48 states and grossed more than $2.1 million in ticket sales, making it the highest grossing WWE event ever at the Staples Center, and the highest grossing of the five WrestleManias held in California. In addition to those in attendance, the event was seen by millions of fans in more than 90 countries.\nReport.\nBackground.\nThe main feud heading into WrestleMania on the Raw brand was between Triple H and Batista for the World Heavyweight Championship. Batista won the 2005 Royal Rumble, last eliminating John Cena, earning the right to participate in the main event of WrestleMania 21 against the World Champion of his choice. In an attempt to persuade Batista to challenge WWE Champion John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield rather than Batista facing Triple H at WrestleMania, Triple H concocted a scheme to have Batista run over in a limousine resembling the one used by Layfield. Initially, Batista did not want help from Evolution and wanted to confront JBL by himself. Triple H insisted that Evolution accompanied Batista anyway, saving him from the oncoming limousine. Batista became aware of the plot while eavesdropping on fellow Evolution members and signed a contract guaranteeing him a match with World Champion Triple H at WrestleMania, thus leaving Evolution and officially turning face. Batista pretended to sign with the SmackDown! brand, giving Triple H and Flair the \"thumbs up,\" but turned it into a \"thumbs down\" before attacking the pair. This lead to Batista's departure from the stable.\nThe main feud heading into WrestleMania on the SmackDown! brand was between John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield and John Cena for the WWE Championship. At No Way Out, Cena defeated Kurt Angle to earn a spot in the SmackDown! main event. As a result of Cena's win, he began a feud with WWE Champion John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) and his Cabinet. In the feud, Cena lost his United States Championship to Cabinet member Orlando Jordan. The following week, JBL proceeded to \"blow up\" Cena's U.S. spinner version belt and reintroduce the traditional style belt.\nA heavily promoted match for the event was an Interpromotional match between SmackDown! superstar Kurt Angle and Raw superstar Shawn Michaels. Their match stemmed from the Royal Rumble, the pay-per-view event two months before WrestleMania. At the Royal Rumble, Kurt Angle relentlessly attacked Shawn Michaels after Michaels had eliminated him from the Royal Rumble match. The next month at No Way Out, Angle lost a number one contenders match to John Cena, losing a spot in the SmackDown! main event at WrestleMania. The next night on \"Raw\", Michaels told SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long to inform Angle that he had challenged him to a match at WrestleMania.&lt;ref name=\"PWWEW - 2/21 Raw\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"OWW - 2/21 Raw\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On the February 28 edition of \"Raw\", after Michaels defeated Edge in a Street Fight, Angle attacked Michaels and accepted his challenge.&lt;ref name=\"PWWEW.net - 2/28 Raw\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"411mania.com - 2/28 Raw\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nThe other Interpromotional match on the card was between Randy Orton and The Undertaker, with Orton representing Raw and Undertaker representing SmackDown!. The feud first started on the March 7 edition of \"Raw\" when Orton challenged The Undertaker to a match at WrestleMania billed as \"Legend vs. Legend Killer\".&lt;ref name=\"PWWEW.net - 3/07 Raw\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"OWW - 3/07 Raw\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later on \"SmackDown!\", Undertaker accepted Orton's challenge.&lt;ref name=\"PWWEW.net - 3/10 SmackDown!\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"SLAM! Sports - 3/10 SmackDown!\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On the March 14 edition of \"Raw\", Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts, attempted to give Orton advice about his match with Undertaker at WrestleMania, but was RKOed when Orton was not cooperating.&lt;ref name=\"411mania.com - 3/14 Raw\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"OWW - 3/14 Raw\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Later that week on \"SmackDown!\", Orton and Undertaker had a contract signing for their match at WrestleMania.&lt;ref name=\"PWWEW.net - 3/17 SmackDown!\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"411mania.com - 3/17 SmackDown!\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After both men signed, Orton told Undertaker that he has nothing but respect for him. Shortly afterwards, Orton slapped him and claimed that his 12-0 undefeated streak at WrestleMania, would soon be 12-1. The next week on \"Raw\", Orton claimed that his confidence was at an all-time high, despite what happened on \"SmackDown!\" the week before. Afterwards, Orton turned heel and furthered his \"Legend killer\" gimmick by RKOing his then-girlfriend Stacy Keibler.&lt;ref name=\"411mania.com - 3/21 Raw\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"OWW - 3/21 Raw\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; \nAnother match on the card was the Money in the Bank ladder match between Chris Jericho, Christian, Chris Benoit, Edge, Kane, and Shelton Benjamin. The idea for the Money in the Bank match was introduced by Chris Jericho who proposed a six-man Ladder match, for the event in which the winner would receive a contract for a World title match at the place and time of his choosing. Raw General Manager, Eric Bischoff, booked the match at WrestleMania 21 soon after.\nEvent.\nBefore the event went live on pay-per-view, a dark match was held. A 30-man Interpromotional Battle Royal, which featured: Booker T, Paul London, Heidenreich, Spike Dudley, Nunzio, Funaki, Doug Basham, Danny Basham, Orlando Jordan, Mark Jindrak, Luther Reigns, Scotty 2 Hotty, Hardcore Holly, Charlie Haas, Billy Kidman, Akio from SmackDown! and Simon Dean, William Regal, Tajiri, Rob Conway, Sylvain Grenier, Snitsky, The Hurricane, Rosey, Chris Masters, Viscera, Rhyno, Val Venis, Tyson Tomko, Maven from Raw. However, Booker T won the Battle Royal, as he eliminated Chris Masters.\nLilian Garcia sang \"America the Beautiful\" at the start of the event. The first televised match of the night was between Rey Mysterio and Eddie Guerrero. In the beginning of the match, Mysterio jumped over the top rope, knocking Guerrero down. Mysterio also attempted another aerial attack but was countered by Guerrero into a Powerbomb. Guerrero placed Mysterio into the Three Amigos and attempted a Frog splash but was unsuccessful. Following a Hurricanrana by Mysterio on Guerrero, Mysterio pinned Guerrero to win. After the match, both shook hands in the ring.\nJohn \"Bradshaw\" Layfield and Orlando Jordan were then shown backstage talking about Layfield's match against John Cena. As Triple H and Ric Flair walked by, Triple H mocked Layfield. Layfield retaliated by advising Triple H to worry about losing the World Heavyweight Championship to Batista and assured him that John Cena would be unsuccessful at defeating him for the WWE Championship. Triple H then stated that only the end of the night would reveal who would still be champion.\nThe match that followed was the first Money in the Bank ladder match which featured Chris Jericho, Chris Benoit, Shelton Benjamin, Edge, Kane, and Christian with Tyson Tomko at ringside. The match contained many notable moments, including points where Jericho, Christian, Benjamin and Kane all jumped over the top rope to the outside of the ring to knock down multiple opponents. Another moment included Benjamin executing a T-Bone Suplex on Edge off the top of a ladder and later using an inclined ladder as a ramp to run up a standing and hit Jericho with a Clothesline maneuver. Benoit also executed a Diving headbutt from the top of a ladder onto Kane. In the conclusion to the match, Benoit climbed a ladder to attempt to retrieve the Money in the Bank briefcase hanging above the ring but was stopped by Kane who had also climbed the ladder. Benoit used repeated headbutts to knock Kane to the ground and attempted to retrieve the briefcase once more but was knocked down by Edge who hit him with a steel chair. Edge then climbed the ladder and successfully obtained possession of the briefcase to win the match.\nIn an interlude, Eugene entered the ring and shared his excitement about being at his first WrestleMania with the crowd in attendance. While attempting to recall his favorite WrestleMania moments, Muhammad Hassan and Daivari interrupted him with Hassan expressing his outrage for not being included in a match for the event. Hassan concluded that since he was not scheduled to compete at the event and was therefore denied the opportunity to experience his own WrestleMania \"moment\", he would have to create a \"moment\" of his own. Following this remark, Hassan and Daivary began to assault Eugene. With Eugene placed into a Camel clutch hold while Daivari verbally attacked him, Hulk Hogan came down to the ring to save Eugene from the assault, knocking Hassan and Daivary out of the ring. Hogan celebrated posing in the ring for the crowd.\nThe third match featured The Undertaker and Randy Orton. Bob Orton, Randy's father and ringside manager, interfered and attacked Undertaker with his arm cast resulting in Randy Orton gaining control of the match. Undertaker attempted to chokeslam Orton, but Orton countered the maneuver with an RKO that led to a two-count. Orton then attempted to use Undertaker's own finishing maneuver against him with the Tombstone piledriver, however, it was reversed by Undertaker into Tombstone piledriver of his own which led to the definitive pin fall. The Undertaker won the match and continued his undefeated streak at WrestleMania with a 13-0 record.\nThe next match was for the WWE Women's Championship, between Trish Stratus and Christy Hemme with Lita at ringside. Stratus controlled most of the match though Hemme attempted many pinning maneuvers that were unsuccessful. Hemme then executed a Twist of fate on Stratus and attempted another pin, which was also unsuccessful. After a Roll-up attempt by both Stratus and Hemme, Stratus hit Hemme with a Chick kick and followed it with the decisive pin, thus winning the match and retaining the WWE Women's Championship.\nThe fifth match was the encounter of Shawn Michaels and Kurt Angle. Mid-way in the match, Michaels hit Angle with low blow, after he countered a suplex attack from Angle. Following the low blow, which was not seen by the referee, Michaels leapfrogged from the ring and laid out Angle onto the announce table. Angle would then gain control of the match, as he would apply the Ankle Lock on Michaels, forcing him to submit, thus Angle winning the match.\nThe next match was between Akebono and The Big Show in a Sumo Match. The match went for a minute and Akebono won the match after he threw The Big Show out of the ring, thus winning the Sumo Match.\nThe next match was John Cena vs. John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield for the WWE Championship. The match was dominated a lot by JBL. At the end Cena would win the match and the WWE Championship after ducking a Clothesline from Hell attempt from JBL into an FU and pinning JBL to become the WWE Champion.\nThe eighth and final match of the night was Triple H defending his World Heavyweight Championship against Batista. The match was dominated a lot by both men. At the end Batista would pin Triple H after a Batista Bomb and would win the World Heavyweight Championship.\nAftermath.\nBatista and Triple H's feud would continue. It would continue to Backlash where Batista and Triple H had a rematch for the World Heavyweight Title. Batista won the match after a Batista Bomb out of a corner. Following that, the two concluded their rivalry at Vengeance where Batista scored the third and final win over his former mentor inside Hell in a Cell. Shortly thereafter, Batista was drafted to the SmackDown brand, and Triple H opted to take time off.\nJohn Cena and JBL's feud would continue until Judgment Day where Cena and JBL would have a rematch for the WWE Championship in an \"I Quit\" match, which Cena won after he was going to hit JBL with an exhaust pipe but made JBL say \"I Quit\" instead. After Judgment Day Cena and JBL's feud ended. Cena was subsequently drafted to the Raw brand shortly after.\nPromotion.\nIn line with the event's location and tagline, WrestleMania 21 was promoted on television with a series of parody movie trailers with wrestlers playing the starring roles from famous modern movies."}

It is 344\u00a0km south west of Sydney on the Hume Highway. The first people to live in the area were indigenous Australians, the Wiradjuri people. The first Europeans were the explorers Hamilton Hume and William Hovell on their trip in 1824.\nHenry O'Brien, an Irishman, started farming sheep in 1825. His farm, called the Jugiong Run, was 125,000 acres. Explorer Charles Sturt reached the Murrumbidgee at Jugiong in 1829 at the start of his travels down the river.\nTavern.\nIn 1845 another Irishman named John Philip Sheahan (1816\u2013December 9, 1877) built the Sir George Tavern (an hotel) which made Jugiong an important resting place on the new road, the \"Great Southern Road\", to Melbourne. The building was destroyed in a flood in 1852. The flood also destroyed the buildings at the town of Gundagai. Sheahan rebuilt the hotel with walls up to 500\u00a0mm thick and it is still in use; remaining in the family throughout the preceding years. It is the oldest family owned hotel in Australia.\nThe Village.\nThe first blocks of land at Jugiong were sold at auction in 1853. Three years later a post office was opened. In 1858 a police station was built, and work started on a catholic church, \"St.John the Evangelist\". About 120 people were living at Jugiong by 1862. An Anglican church was started in 1872. The Jugiong Public school opened in 1883 with 56 students. Australian cricket player Richie Benaud started his schooling at Jugiong in 1935.\nBushrangers.\nOn 15 November 1864 bushrangers (thieves) stopped all traffic including the mail stagecoach (a cart pulled by horses) 5\u00a0km south of Jugiong.

In currently sold models, white is opposite yellow, blue is opposite green, orange is opposite red, and some might replace blue with black or purple.\nTypes of Cubes.\nThe standard Rubik's Cube is 3x3x3. 3 blocks across, 3 blocks down, and 3 blocks deep. Cubes can be made in 2x2, 4x4, or larger versions. the largest cube is 33 x 33, which is also 3d printed.\nCuboids are cubes with uneven sides. Some options are the 3x2x2 or 3x5 or 4x3. Some cuboids can \"shapeshift\" or \"jumble\". That means the cube goes out of its original shape. To solve a shapeshifting cube it must return to the original shape before it is considered solved.\nGear cubes include gears which cause both sides of a cube to turn.\nOther versions include the Megaminx, Pyraminx, Rubik's clock, Mirror Cube, and Square 1.\nStructure.\nA Rubik's Cube is a cube split into a number of smaller cubes with different colored faces attached to a rotating piece of metal in the middle. Total, there are 26 small cubes. The Rubik's Cube have six sides with 9 little cubes attached to it and each side has one color: red, yellow, blue, orange, white and green are the most common colors. \nThe cubes can be rotated and twisted along rows and faces. The aim of the puzzle is to make each face of the cube have the same color. Solving a Rubik's Cube requires logic and thinking. There are many different ways to learn how to solve a Rubik's cube.\nMethods.\nThere are many methods that people use to solve a Rubik's Cube. Today the most common one is called CFOP, also called Fridrich Method, named after the popularizer Jessica Fridrich. In this method first the white cross is solved, then F2L(First 2 Layers) followed by OLL(Orientation of the Last Layer) and PLL(Permutation of the Last Layer). Other methods include Petrus, ZZ, Roux, Keyhole and others. \nRecords.\nThe record for one Rubik's Cube solve is 3.47 seconds by Yusheng Du at the Wuhu Open 2018 (in China).

The flag is called the Saltire or the Saint Andrew's Cross.\nHistory.\nAccording to legend, in 832 A.D. King \u00d3engus (II) (or King Angus) led the Picts and Scots in battle against the Angles near modern-day Athelstaneford in East Lothian. King Angus and his men were surrounded and he prayed for deliverance. During the night Saint Andrew, who was martyred on a saltire cross, appeared to Angus and assured him of victory. On the following morning a white saltire against the background of a blue sky appeared to both sides. The Picts and Scots were heartened by this, but the Angles lost confidence and were defeated. According to the legend, this saltire design has been the Scottish flag ever since.\nMaterial evidence of the saltire's use dates from many centuries later. In 1385 the Parliament of Scotland decreed that Scottish soldiers should wear a saltire as a distinguishing mark. The earliest surviving Scottish flag consisting solely of the saltire dates from 1503: a white cross on a red background. By 1540 the legend of King Angus had been altered to include the vision of the cross against a blue sky. Thereafter, this saltire design in its present form became the national flag of Scotland.\nFlying the flag.\nScottish Parliament.\nThere are five flagpoles outside the Scottish Parliament Building in Edinburgh. The flag of Scotland is flown every day, alongside the Union Flag and the flag of Europe. The fourth flagpole is used for special occasions such as Commonwealth Day and United Nations Day. The fifth pole is used for the Royal Standard of Scotland.\nEdinburgh Castle.\nEdinburgh Castle is managed by Historic Scotland, and has a military garrison of the British Army. Like all British Army bases, it flies the Union Flag (in ratio3:5) and the Army flies it every day from the Clock Tower. The Saltire is flown every day at the Half Moon Battery.\nThe flying of the Union Flag at Edinburgh Castle has sometimes caused controversy. In 2001, a group of 20 Scottish National Party MSPs called for the Union Flag to be replaced by the Saltire.\nScottish Government.\nThe Scottish Government has decreed that the flag of Scotland will fly on all its buildings every day from 8 am until sunset. An exception is made for \"national days\". On these days, the Saltire shall be lowered and replaced with the Union Flag. These days are the same as the flag days of the United Kingdom with the exception of 3 September (Merchant Navy Day), which is a specific flag day in Scotland and during which the Red Ensign may also be used. \nAnother difference with the rest of the UK's days is that on Saint Andrew's Day, the Union Flag will only be flown if the building has more than one flagpole \u2013 the Saltire will not be lowered to make way for the Union Flag if there is only one flagpole. This difference arose after Members of the Scottish Parliament complained that Scotland was the only country in the world that could not fly its national flag on its national day.\nOthers.\nThe flag can be flown at any time by any individual, company, local authority, hospital or school. There is no need to get consent to fly the flag from a vertical flagpole. The flagpole itself may need planning permission. \nIn recent years, embassies of the United Kingdom have flown the Saltire to mark St Andrew's Day.\nMost local authorities in Scotland fly the Saltire. Glasgow City Council fly the flag from the City Chambers building in George Square, while the City of Edinburgh Council fly the flag from their own city chambers.\nIn 2007 Angus Council led by Robert Myles decided to change the Saltire for a new Angus flag. This move led to public outcry across Scotland with more than 7,000 people signing a petition opposing the council's move, leading to a compromise whereby the Angus flag would not replace but be flown alongside the Saltire on Council buildings.\nColour and dimensions.\nAt various times throughout history colours as light as sky blue or as dark as dark navy blue have been used (a selection apparently motivated by which colour of blue dye was available at the time). When incorporated as part of the Union Flag, the navy blue colour used was that of the Blue ensign belonging to the historic 'Blue Squadron' of the British Royal Navy. Dark blue was primarily used for reasons of expediency\u2014it suffered less from the effects of fading resulting from prolonged exposure to the elements (namely sunlight and salt spray). \nAlthough this navy blue colour was used specifically for depicting the Union Flag on maritime flags on the basis of durability, it soon became standard on Union Flags, both on land and at sea. This navy blue colour trend was adopted for the Saltire itself by many flag manufacturers, resulting in a variety of shades of blue being depicted on the flag of Scotland ranging from \"sky blue\" to \"royal blue\" to \"navy blue\". Eventually, this situation resulted in calls to standardise the colour of Scotland's national flag. \nIn 2003, a committee of the Scottish Parliament met to examine a petition that the Scottish Government adopt the Pantone 300 colour as a standard. (Note that this blue is of a lighter shade than the Pantone 280 of the Union Flag). Having taken advice from a number of sources including the office of the Lord Lyon King of Arms, the committee recommended that the optimum shade of blue for the Saltire should be Pantone 300 (that is, 0, 101, 189 in the RGB colour model, or #0065BD as hexadecimal web colours). Recent versions of the Saltire have therefore largely converged on this official recommendation, though dark blue has continued in use. \nThe flag's proportion is not fixed, but is generally taken as 1:2, 2:3, 3:5 or 4:5. The bars in the cross should be 1/5 (i.e., 20%) the width of the flag.\nOutside Scotland.\nInverse representations (blue saltire on a white field) of the Scottish Saltire are also used outside Scotland. In Canada, an inverse representation of the Saltire, combined with the shield from the Royal Arms of the Kingdom of Scotland, forms the modern flag of the Canadian Province of Nova Scotia, the first colonial venture of the Kingdom of Scotland into the Americas. \nIn Russia, during the period before and after the Soviet Union, the naval ensign of the Russian Navy has been an inverse representation of the Cross of Saint Andrew. (Saint Andrew is also a patron saint of Russia). The very same Saltire was also flown as the flag of Galicia in Spain until 1891, when Russia requested the Galician flag to be modified in order to avoid confusion between Galician ships and Russian Navy ships. The current Galician flag is actually the original blue-over-white saltire but without one of the arms of the cross.\nThe U.S. state of Alabama's flag is officially \"a crimson cross of St. Andrew on a field of white,\" but the reference is used only to describe the shape without using the vexillological term saltire as that flag's origins are from either or both of the Confederate Battle Flag or the , both of which have saltires and are associated with the history of that state. Similarly, the Spanish island of Tenerife and the remote Colombian islands of San Andr\u00e9s and Providencia also use the saltire on their flags.\nThe Scottish Saltire is also used unofficially by students and graduates of Xavier University because of the university's blue and white official colors and the resemblance of the flag to the letter \"X\". It is also the flag for St. Andrew's Scots School, Argentina (founded in 1838) and its \"spinoff\" university Universidad de San Andr\u00e9s.\nThe Dutch municipality of Sint-Oedenrode, named after the Scottish princess Saint Oda, also uses the Saltire as the basis of its flag.\nIncorporation into the Union Flag.\nThe Scottish Saltire and field is one of the key components of the Union Flag. The Union Flag has been used in a variety of forms since 1606, when the flags of the Kingdom of Scotland and Kingdom of England were first merged to symbolise the Union of the Crowns. (The Union of the Crowns having occurred in 1603.) In Scotland, and in particular on Scottish vessels at sea, historical evidence suggests that a separate design of Union Flag was sometimes flown to that used in England. Following the Acts of Union of 1707, which united the Kingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England, the standard Union Flag became the national flag of the new United Kingdom of Great Britain. \nFrom 1801, in order to symbolise the union of the Kingdom of Great Britain with the Kingdom of Ireland, a new design was adopted for the Union Flag of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The 1801 design did not change with the partition of Ireland in 1921 and creation of the Irish Free State, and is the flag of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland today.\nLion Rampant.\nThe Royal Standard of the King of Scots, also known as the Royal Flag of Scotland or the Lion Rampant, is the flag used historically by the King of Scots. It remains the personal banner of the monarch and use of this flag is restricted under the Act of the Parliament of Scotland 1672 cap. 47 and 30 &amp; 31 Vict. cap. 17.\nDespite the legal restrictions concerning the use of this flag, it is often regarded as a second, albeit unofficial, national flag for Scotland, most often seen at sporting events."}

It can make pictures of atoms on a surface and move the atoms to different places. It was invented by Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer in 1981 at IBM, in Z\u00fcrich. In 1986 they won the Nobel Prize in Physics for inventing it. \nHow it works.\nThe STM is called a microscope because it makes pictures of tiny objects. But it is different -- it doesn't have anything to look into with our eyes. It is similar to feeling the shape of objects on a table in a dark room: you can draw a picture of the shape even though you did not seen it with your eyes. The STM does this for very tiny objects. It works by scanning a sharp metal needle back and forth across a surface, and uses electric current instead of force to sense the shape. When the tip of sharp metal needle is brought very close to the surface of a thing being studied, a voltage between the two causes electrons to flow through the space between them. The electrons cross this space by a process called quantum tunneling, which gives the STM its name. This tiny current of electrons flows when the tip is almost touching the surface. The current changes as the probe moves along the surface. This change is recorded by a computer, which makes it into a picture that we can see. \nThe surface and the tip must conduct electrons, so they must be made of a metal or semiconductor. A related kind of microscope senses the force instead of the electric current. This kind of microscope is called an atomic force microscope.\nSTM is a hard thing to do, because it needs a very clean surface and a very sharp needle tip. The STM usually works in a vacuum to keep the air molecules from disturbing the surface, but it can also work in air or water.\nWays it can make a picture.\nFirst, the tip is brought very close to the surface of thing being studied. This distance is about half of a nanometer. Then the tip is moved very carefully back and forth across the surface. The electrical current is measured while the tip is moved back and forth (constant height method). The STM can also work by adjusting the tip so the tunnel current stays the same (constant current method). Using the constant-height method is faster. Using constant-current method helps avoid bumping the tip into things on the surface, so it can study things that are rougher.\nMoving atoms.\nThe STM can move an atom (or a molecule) to a new place on the surface. To move an atom, the tip is moved so it touches the atom. Then the tip pulls or pushes the atom to a new place. Moving atoms allows scientists to arrange them into tiny objects, so they can test their properties and try out new ideas.\nParts of the STM.\nThe parts of an STM are: scanning tip, something that moves the tip, something that stops it from vibrating, and a computer that controls the tip and makes the picture.

A quantum mechanical system can only be in certain states, so that only certain energy levels are possible. The term energy level is most commonly used in reference to the electron configuration in atoms or molecules. In other words, the energy spectrum can be quantized (see continuous spectrum for the more general case). \nAs with classical potentials, the potential energy is usually set to zero at infinity, leading to a negative potential energy for bound electron states. \nEnergy levels are said to be degenerate, if the same energy level is obtained by more than one quantum mechanical state. They are then called degenerate energy levels.\nThe following sections of this article gives an overview over the most important factors that determine the energy levels of atoms and molecules.\nAtoms.\nIntrinsic energy levels.\nOrbital state energy level.\nAssume an electron in a given atomic orbital. The energy of its state is mainly determined by the electrostatic interaction of the (negative) electron with the (positive) nucleus. The energy levels of an electron around a nucleus are given by : \nwhere formula_2 is the Rydberg constant (typically between 1 eV and 103 eV), \"Z\" is the charge of the atom's nucleus, formula_3 is the principal quantum number, \"e\" is the charge of the electron, formula_4 is Planck's constant, and \"c\" is the speed of light.\nThe Rydberg levels depend only on the principal quantum number formula_3.\nFine structure splitting.\nFine structure arises from relativistic kinetic energy corrections, spin-orbit coupling (an electrodynamic interaction between the electron's spin and motion and the nucleus's electric field) and the Darwin term (contact term interaction of s-shell electrons inside the nucleus). Typical magnitude formula_6 eV.\nHyperfine structure.\nSpin-nuclear-spin coupling (\"see hyperfine structure\"). Typical magnitude formula_7 eV.\nElectrostatic interaction of an electron with other electrons.\nIf there is more than one electron around the atom, electron-electron-interactions raise the energy level. These interactions are often neglected if the spatial overlap of the electron wavefunctions is low.\nEnergy levels due to external fields.\nZeeman effect.\nThe interaction energy is: formula_8 with formula_9\nZeeman effect taking spin into account.\nThis takes both the magnetic dipole moment due to the orbital angular momentum and the magnetic momentum arising from the electron spin into account. \nDue to relativistic effects (Dirac equation), the magnetic moment arising from the electron spin is formula_10 with formula_11 the gyro-magnetic factor (about 2). \nformula_12\nThe interaction energy therefore gets formula_13.\nStark effect.\nInteraction with an external electric field (\"see Stark effect\").\nMolecules.\nRoughly speaking, a molecular energy state, i.e. an eigenstate of the molecular Hamiltonian, is the sum of an electronic, vibrational, rotational, nuclear and translational component, such that:\nwhere formula_15 is an eigenvalue of the electronic molecular Hamiltonian (the value of the potential energy surface) at the equilibrium geometry of the molecule. \nThe molecular energy levels are labelled by the molecular term symbols.\nThe specific energies of these components vary with the specific energy state and the substance. \nIn molecular physics and quantum chemistry, an energy level is a quantized energy of a bound quantum mechanical state.\nCrystalline materials.\nCrystalline materials are often characterized by a number of important energy levels. The most important ones are the top of the valence band, the bottom of the conduction band, the Fermi energy, the vacuum level, and the energy levels of any defect states in the crystals."}
{"id": "111794", "revid": "1143779", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=111794", "title": "Atomic nucleus", "text": "The nucleus is the center of an atom. It is made up of nucleons called (protons and neutrons) and is surrounded by the electron cloud. The size (diameter) of the nucleus is between 1.6 fm (10\u221215 m) (for a proton in light hydrogen) to about 15 fm (for the heaviest atoms, such as uranium). These sizes are much smaller than the size of the atom itself by a factor of about 23,000 (uranium) to about 145,000 (hydrogen). Although it is only a very small part of the atom, the nucleus has most of the mass. Almost all of the mass in an atom is made up from the protons and neutrons in the nucleus with a very small contribution from the orbiting electrons.\nNeutrons have no charge and protons are positively charged. Because the nucleus is only made up of protons and neutrons it is positively charged. Things that have the same charge repel each other: this repulsion is part of what is called electromagnetic force. Unless there was something else holding the nucleus together it could not exist because the protons would push away from each other. The nucleus is actually held together by another force known as the strong nuclear force.\nThe word \"nucleus\" is from 1704, meaning \u201ckernel of a nut\u201d. In 1844, Michael Faraday used nucleus to describe the \u201ccentral point of an atom\u201d. The modern atomic meaning was proposed by Ernest Rutherford in 1912. The use of the word \"nucleus\" in atomic theory, however, did not happen immediately. In 1916, for example, Gilbert N. Lewis wrote in his famous article \"The Atom and the Molecule\" that \"the atom is composed of the \"kernel\" and an outer atom or \"shell\"\".\nComposition.\nThe nucleus of an atom is made up of protons and neutrons (two types of baryons) joined by the nuclear force. These baryons are further made up of sub-atomic fundamental particles known as quarks joined by the strong interaction. The nucleus is more or less a spheroid and may be somewhat prolate (long) or oblate (flat) or otherwise not entirely round.\nIf the nucleus can be considered to have a radius of the order of 5 fm (= 10 \u00d7 10-15 m), this means its cross-section is of the order of 10-28 m2, and its volume is about 10-42 m3.\nIsotopes and nuclides.\nThe isotope of an atom is based on the number of neutrons in the nucleus. Different isotopes of the same element have very similar chemical properties. Different isotopes in a sample of a chemical can be separated by using a centrifuge or by using a mass spectrometer. The first method is used in producing enriched uranium from regular uranium, and the second is used in carbon dating.\nThe number of protons and neutrons together determine the nuclide (type of nucleus). Protons and neutrons have nearly equal masses, and their combined number, the mass number, is about equal to the atomic mass of an atom. The combined mass of the electrons is very small when compared to the mass of the nucleus; protons and neutrons weigh about 2000 times more than electrons.\nHistory.\nThe discovery of the electron by J. J. Thomson was the first sign that the atom had internal structure. At the turn of the 20th century the accepted model of the atom was J. J. Thomson's \"plum pudding\" model in which the atom was a large positively charged ball with small negatively charged electrons embedded inside of it. By the turn of the century physicists had also discovered three types of radiation coming from atoms, which they named alpha, beta, and gamma radiation. Experiments in 1911 by Lise Meitner and Otto Hahn, and by James Chadwick in 1914 discovered that the beta decay spectrum was continuous rather than discrete. That is, electrons were ejected from the atom with a range of energies, rather than the discrete amounts of energies that were observed in gamma and alpha decays. This was a problem for nuclear physics at the time, because it indicated that energy was not conserved in these decays. The problem would later lead to the discovery of the neutrino (see below).\nIn 1906 Ernest Rutherford published \"Radiation of the \u03b1 Particle from Radium in passing through Matter\". Geiger expanded on this work in a communication to the Royal Society with experiments he and Rutherford had done passing \u03b1 particles through air, aluminum foil and gold foil. More work was published in 1909 by Geiger and Marsden and further greatly expanded work was published in 1910 by Geiger, In 1911-2 Rutherford went before the Royal Society to explain the experiments and propound the new theory of the atomic nucleus as we now understand it.\nAround the same time that this was happening (1909) Ernest Rutherford performed a remarkable experiment in which Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden under his supervision fired alpha particles (helium nuclei) at a thin film of gold foil. The plum pudding model predicted that the alpha particles should come out of the foil with their trajectories being at most slightly bent. He was shocked to discover that a few particles were scattered through large angles, even completely backwards in some cases. The discovery, beginning with Rutherford's analysis of the data in 1911, eventually led to the Rutherford model of the atom, in which the atom has a very small, very dense nucleus consisting of heavy positively charged particles with embedded electrons in order to balance out the charge. As an example, in this model nitrogen-14 consisted of a nucleus with 14 protons and 7 electrons, and the nucleus was surrounded by 7 more orbiting electrons.\nThe Rutherford model worked quite well until studies of nuclear spin were carried out by Franco Rasetti at the California Institute of Technology in 1929. By 1925 it was known that protons and electrons had a spin of 1/2, and in the Rutherford model of nitrogen-14 the 14 protons and six of the electrons should have paired up to cancel each other's spin, and the final electron should have left the nucleus with a spin of 1/2. Rasetti discovered, however, that nitrogen-14 has a spin of one.\nIn 1930 Wolfgang Pauli was unable to attend a meeting in T\u00fcbingen, and instead sent a famous letter with the classic introduction \"Dear Radioactive Ladies and Gentlemen\". In his letter Pauli suggested that perhaps there was a third particle in the nucleus which he named the \"neutron\". He suggested that it was very light (lighter than an electron), had no charge, and that it did not readily interact with matter (which is why it had not yet been detected). This desperate way out solved both the problem of energy conservation and the spin of nitrogen-14, the first because Pauli's \"neutron\" was carrying away the extra energy and the second because an extra \"neutron\" paired off with the electron in the nitrogen-14 nucleus giving it spin one. Pauli's \"neutron\" was renamed the neutrino (Italian for little neutral one) by Enrico Fermi in 1931, and after about thirty years it was finally demonstrated that a neutrino really is emitted during beta decay.\nIn 1932 Chadwick realized that radiation that had been observed by Walther Bothe, Herbert L. Becker, Ir\u00e8ne and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Joliot-Curie was actually due to a massive particle that he called the neutron. In the same year Dmitri Ivanenko suggested that neutrons were in fact spin 1/2 particles and that the nucleus contained neutrons and that there were no electrons in it, and Francis Perrin suggested that neutrinos were not nuclear particles but were created during beta decay. To cap the year off, Fermi submitted a theory of the neutrino to \"Nature\" (which the editors rejected for being \"too remote from reality\"). Fermi continued working on his theory and published a paper in 1934 which placed the neutrino on solid theoretical footing. In the same year Hideki Yukawa proposed the first significant theory of the strong force to explain how the nucleus holds together.\nWith Fermi and Yukawa's papers the modern model of the atom was complete. The center of the atom contains a tight ball of neutrons and protons, which is held together by the strong nuclear force. Unstable nuclei may undergo alpha decay, in which they emit an energetic helium nucleus, or beta decay, in which they eject an electron (or positron). After one of these decays the resultant nucleus may be left in an excited state, and in this case it decays to its ground state by emitting high energy photons (gamma decay).\nThe study of the strong and weak nuclear forces led physicists to collide nuclei and electrons at ever higher energies. This research became the science of particle physics, the most important of which is the standard model of particle physics which unifies the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces.\nModern nuclear physics.\nA nucleus can contain hundreds of nucleons which means that with some approximation it can be treated as a classical system, rather than a quantum-mechanical one. In the resulting liquid-drop model, the nucleus has an energy which arises partly from surface tension and partly from electrical repulsion of the protons. The liquid-drop model is able to reproduce many features of nuclei, including the general trend of binding energy with respect to mass number, as well as the phenomenon of nuclear fission.\nSuperimposed on this classical picture, however, are quantum-mechanical effects, which can be described using the nuclear shell model, developed in large part by Maria Goeppert-Mayer. Nuclei with certain numbers of neutrons and protons (the magic numbers 2, 8, 20, 50, 82, 126, ...) are particularly stable, because their shells are filled.\nMuch of current research in nuclear physics relates to the study of nuclei under extreme conditions such as high spin and excitation energy. Nuclei may also have extreme shapes (similar to that of American footballs) or extreme neutron-to-proton ratios. Experimenters can create such nuclei using artificially induced fusion or nucleon transfer reactions, employing ion beams from an accelerator.\nBeams with even higher energies can be used to create nuclei at very high temperatures, and there are signs that these experiments have produced a phase transition from normal nuclear matter to a new state, the quark-gluon plasma, in which the quarks mingle with one another, rather than being segregated in triplets as they are in neutrons and protons.\nTopics in nuclear physics.\nNuclear decay.\nIf a nucleus has too few or too many neutrons it may be unstable, and will decay after some period of time. For example, nitrogen-16 atoms (7 protons, 9 neutrons) beta decay to oxygen-16 atoms (8 protons, 8 neutrons) within a few seconds of being created. In this decay a neutron in the nitrogen nucleus is turned into a proton and an electron by the weak nuclear force. The element of the atom changes because while it previously had seven protons (which makes it nitrogen) it now has eight (which makes it oxygen). Many elements have multiple isotopes which are stable for weeks, years, or even billions of years.\nNuclear fusion.\nWhen two light nuclei come into very close contact with each other it is possible for the strong force to fuse the two together. It takes a great deal of energy to push the nuclei close enough together for the strong force to have an effect, so the process of nuclear fusion can only take place at very high temperatures or high densities. Once the nuclei are close enough together the strong force overcomes their electromagnetic repulsion and squishes them into a new nucleus. A very large amount of energy is released when light nuclei fuse together because the binding energy per nucleon increases with mass number up until nickel-62. Stars like our sun are powered by the fusion of four protons into a helium nucleus, two positrons, and two neutrinos. The \"uncontrolled\" fusion of hydrogen into helium is known as thermonuclear runaway. Research to find an economically viable method of using energy from a \"controlled\" fusion reaction is currently being undertaken by various research establishments (see JET and ITER).\nNuclear fission.\nFor nuclei heavier than nickel-62 the binding energy per nucleon decreases with the mass number. It is therefore possible for energy to be released if a heavy nucleus breaks apart into two lighter ones. This splitting of atoms is known as nuclear fission.\nThe process of alpha decay may be thought of as a special type of spontaneous nuclear fission. This process produces a highly asymmetrical fission because the four particles which make up the alpha particle are especially tightly bound to each other, making production of this nucleus in fission particularly likely.\nFor certain of the heaviest nuclei which produce neutrons on fission, and which also easily absorb neutrons to initiate fission, a self-igniting type of neutron-initiated fission can be obtained, in a so-called chain reaction. [Chain reactions were known in chemistry before physics, and in fact many familiar processes like fires and chemical explosions are chemical chain reactions]. The fission or \"nuclear\" chain-reaction, using fission-produced neutrons, is the source of energy for nuclear power plants and fission type nuclear bombs such as the two that the United States used against Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II. Heavy nuclei such as uranium and thorium may undergo spontaneous fission, but they are much more likely to undergo decay by alpha decay.\nFor a neutron-initiated chain-reaction to occur, there must be a critical mass of the element present in a certain space under certain conditions (these conditions slow and conserve neutrons for the reactions). There is one known example of a natural nuclear fission reactor, which was active in two regions of Oklo, Gabon, Africa, over 1.5 billion years ago. Measurements of natural neutrino emission have demonstrated that around half of the heat emanating from the earth's core results from radioactive decay. However, it is not known if any of this results from fission chain-reactions.\nProduction of heavy elements.\nAs the Universe cooled after the big bang it eventually became possible for particles as we know them to exist. The most common particles created in the big bang which are still easily observable to us today were protons (hydrogen) and electrons (in equal numbers). Some heavier elements were created as the protons collided with each other, but most of the heavy elements we see today were created inside of stars during a series of fusion stages, such as the proton-proton chain, the CNO cycle and the triple-alpha process.\nProgressively heavier elements are made during the evolution of a star.\nSince the binding energy per nucleon peaks around iron, energy is only released in fusion processes occurring below this point. Since the creation of heavier nuclei by fusion costs energy, nature resorts to the process of neutron capture. Neutrons (due to their lack of charge) are readily absorbed by a nucleus. The heavy elements are created by either a slow neutron capture process (the so-called \"s\" process) or by the rapid, or \"r\" process. The \"s\" process occurs in thermally pulsing stars (called AGB, or asymptotic giant branch stars) and takes hundreds to thousands of years to reach the heaviest elements of lead and bismuth. The \"r\" process is thought to occur in supernova explosions because the conditions of high temperature, high neutron flux and ejected matter are present. These stellar conditions make the successive neutron captures very fast, involving very neutron-rich species which then beta-decay to heavier elements, especially at the so-called waiting points that correspond to more stable nuclides with closed neutron shells (magic numbers). The \"r\" process duration is typically in the range of a few seconds."}

The city grown up very fast and in 1294, became a \"libero comune\" (independent municipality). In the early 14th century the island of Sardinia was occupied by the Aragonese, the municipality sent a delegation to the court of Aragon, but they did not achieve any agreement. So with the support of the Republic of Genoa and the Doria's family, the people of Sassari rose up against the invaders, until 1417 when the king Alfonso V granted an acceptable status to the town. In 1617 in town the Jesuits founded the University. In 1713, after the Treaty of Utrecht, in the island of Sardinia started the brief period of the Austro-Hungarian administration. In fact since 1720 the island was annexed by the House of Savoy and since then was born the Kingdom of Sardinia. But in 1793, after years of political struggle, in the island started an uprising, called \u201cSarda rivoluzione\u201d (Sardinian revolution), led by the patriot Giovanni Maria Angioy, who entered triumphantly in the city of Sassari, followed by thousand of revolutionaries coming from all over the island. But the Savoy, stifled the rebellion with ferocity, reconquered the town. But the rebellion in town will continued until the middle of the 19th century.\nIn 1861 the Kingdom of Sardinia, after the campaign to unify Italy and the annexation of many small states, it became the founding state of the new Kingdom of Italy.

It was founded by singer and guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic. Nirvana had many drummers, but the final and most well known drummer was Dave Grohl, who joined in 1990. The band ended in 1994 after the death of Cobain. Since they formed, they have sold over 75 million records all over the world.\nNirvana were part of a rock music genre from Seattle called grunge. The genre comes from both punk rock and heavy metal. They released their first album, called \"Bleach\", for record label Sub Pop in 1989. Nirvana's style was songs with quiet verses and loud choruses. After signing to record label DGC Records, in 1991, Nirvana became very popular after releasing the song \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\". This song was the first single from their second album \"Nevermind\" (1991), which sold over 30 million copies worldwide. Nirvana becoming popular also made alternative rock popular. Cobain was then called by some people the \"spokesman of a generation\".\nAfter many tours and the 1992 compilation album \"Incesticide\" and EP \"Hormoaning\", Nirvana released their third studio album \"In Utero\" (1993). It was well liked by critics and sold 15 million records worldwide. Nirvana ended after the death of Kurt Cobain in 1994. Some live albums have been released since. \"MTV Unplugged in New York\" (1994) won a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album in 1996.\nHistory.\nFormation and early years (1987-1988).\nSinger and guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic met while they were at Aberdeen High School. Cobain said they didn't speak much while there. They became friends after high school while they were both often in the practising space of the Melvins Cobain wanted to start a band with Novoselic, but Novoselic did not answer for a long time. Cobain sent him a demo of his band Fecal Matter. Three years later, Novoselic told Cobain he had listened to the tape and said they should start a band.\nBreakup.\nFollowing a tour stop in Munich, Germany on March 1, 1994, Kurt was diagnosed with severe Bronchitis. He flew to Rome the next day for treatment, and his wife Courtney Love met him there a few days later. On March 4, Kurt was rushed to the hospital after an overdose of Rohypnol, which he had consumed with Champagne. On March 18, Courtney called the Seattle Police to their home over one dispute, informing them that Kurt was suicidal and that he had locked himself in a room with a gun. When the police arrived, Kurt explained to them that he was not suicidal and that he only wanted to leave Courtney. On March 25, Courtney arranged an intervention for Kurt, however it was unsuccessful, with Kurt insulting its participants. On March 30, Kurt and his best friend Dylan Carlson went to buy a shotgun, which he told him he needed for home protection and because of prowlers. The guns Kurt owned previously had been seized by the police, leading Dylan to buy the gun in his name, and not Kurt\u2019s. That same day, Kurt checked into Exodus Recovery Center, and flew to Los Angeles. After two days at the treatment center, Kurt jumped over a 6 foot perimeter wall and bought a plane ticket back to Seattle. On the flight, he sat next to Guns N' Roses\u2019 Duff McKagan, who knew that in all of his instinct that something was wrong. When Kurt arrived back in Seattle, people reported sightings of him in the days following. When Courtney learned that he left Exodus, she began trying to locate him. On April 4, she called in a missing person\u2019s report for him, pretending to be his mother Wendy when making the call. The day after, she instructed an assistant to hire electricians to install security lighting and motion censors on a greenhouse above the garage of the Cobains\u2019 home. On April 7, Nirvana pulled out of that year\u2019s Lollapalooza music festival. The next day, one of the hired electricians named Gary Smith found Kurt\u2019s body lying in the greenhouse, and called the police. No attempt was ever made to reform Nirvana. \nAfter the band.\nAfter Nirvana broke up, Dave Grohl started a new band called the Foo Fighters. Krist Novoselic became interested in politics and also kept making music. He was the bassist for Flipper, which Kurt Cobain was a fan of, but later left the band. Novoselic later founded alternative rock band Giants in the Trees in 2017."}

It took place on March 31, 1985 at Madison Square Garden in New York, New York. The attendance for the event was 19,121 fans. The event was viewed by over one million fans through closed circuit television, making it the largest event on closed-circuit television in the United States at the time. The event was the start of the Rock 'n' Wrestling gimmick, which brought together professional wrestling and the music industry.\nReport.\nBackground.\nFor the first WrestleMania, Vince McMahon began cross promoting with MTV and several celebrities like Muhammad Ali, Liberace and Cyndi Lauper appeared during the build up to and at the event. To build up the show, the WWF aired two wrestling specials on MTV. The first one was The Brawl to End it All, aired on July 23, 1984, in which a match from a live MSG broadcast was shown on MTV. Wendi Richter defeated The Fabulous Moolah to win the WWF Women's Championship on the card, with Lauper on her side. At The War to Settle the Score, which aired on February 18, 1985, Leilani Kai, accompanied by Moolah, defeated Richter, again accompanied by Lauper, to win the Women's Championship.\nIn the months leading up to the first WrestleMania, Roddy Piper began a talk-show segment on WWF television entitles \"Piper's Pit\". On one episode of the show, he hit Jimmy Snuka over the head with coconut, leading to a feud between the two men. As part of the storyline, Piper recruited Cowboy Bob Orton to be his bodyguard. On another episode of \"Piper's Pit\", Piper spoke out against the burgeoning Rock 'n' Wrestling connection, which led to a confrontation with Hulk Hogan. In February 1985, the two men faced each other at The War to Settle the Score, where Hogan won by disqualification. Their on-going feud led to their match at WrestleMania.\nEvent.\nWWF announcer Gene Okerlund did the singing of the National Anthem, with Gorilla Monsoon and Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura calling the action. Gene Okerlund also did interviews backstage, with \"Lord\" Alfred Hayes doing interviews near the entrance to the locker room, right outside the ring. Howard Finkel began the first of his many times ring announcing WrestleMania events, on this broadcast. The opening theme for the event was the instrumental portion of the Phil Collins and Philip Bailey hit \"Easy Lover\", while the closing theme for the credits was \"Axel F.\" by Harold Faltermeyer. Celebrity guests in attendance for this WrestleMania included Billy Martin, Cyndi Lauper, Mr. T, Muhammad Ali, and Liberace accompanied by The Rockettes.\nThe first match was between Tito Santana and The Executioner. Santana won the match after slamming The Executioner from the apron into the ring and then performing a flying forearm. This caused The Executioner to submit. Following the match, King Kong Bundy, accompanied by Jimmy Hart, and Special Delivery Jones made their way to the ring. After performing an avalanche and big splash, Bundy defeated Jones in record making time. The WWF's official time for the match is nine seconds.\nThe next match was between Ricky Steamboat and Matt Borne. Steamboat took the early advantage in the match-up, until Borne performed a belly-to-belly suplex on Steamboat. In retaliation, Steamboat used a several knife-edged chops, a belly-to-back suplex, and a flying double chop off of the ropes. After performing a flying crossbody, Steamboat pinned Borne for the win. After the match ended, David Sammartino, accompanied by his father Bruno Sammartino, and Brutus Beefcake, accompanied by Johnny Valiant, made their way to the ring. The action favored both contestants, as each wrestler alternated having the advantage. After Beefcake threw David Sammartino out of the ring, Valiant performed a body slam on him onto the cement floor. He then pushed Sammartino back into the ring. A short while later, all four men began fighting in the ring, and the match ended in a no-contest.\nThe first championship defense of WrestleMania was between Junkyard Dog (JYD) and the reigning WWF Intercontinental Champion Greg Valentine, who was accompanied to the ring by his manager Jimmy Hart. JYD began the match in the offensive position, performing headbutts and roundhouse right hands on Valentine. As the action went back and forth, Hart climbed on the ring apron, where Valentine accidentally hit him. Later, Valentine pinned JYD with his feet on the ropes for leverage, which is an illegal maneuver. As a result, Tito Santana ran down to the ring and explained what had happened to the match's official. The match was restarted, and JYD eventually won the match by count-out. Valentine, however, kept his title as titles do not change hands through count-out. The following match was a for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Nikolai Volkoff and Iron Sheik, accompanied to the ring by Freddie Blassie, challenged the reigning champions, The U.S. Express (Mike Rotundo and Barry Windham), who were accompanied by Lou Albano. The U.S. Express dominated the early part of the match until Volkoff and The Sheik began to gain the offensive advantage over Rotundo. After Rotundo tagged in his partner Windham, Windham performed a bulldog on The Sheik. After nearly being pinned, The Sheik hit Windham in the head with Blassie's cane as the referee had his back turned. After Volkloff got the pin, Volkoff and The Sheik were crowned as the new tag champions.\nThe next match on the card was a $15,000 Body Slam Challenge between Andr\u00e9 the Giant and Big John Studd, who was accompanied by Bobby Heenan. The stipulation of the match was that Andr\u00e9 the Giant had to body slam Studd to win $15,000, and if he failed, he would be forced to retire. After beginning the match in the defensive position, Andr\u00e9 countered with chops and a headbutt. After weakening his knees with multiple kicks, Andr\u00e9 was able to lift Studd over his shoulders and execute a body slam to win the match. After Andr\u00e9 collected his prize money, he threw some of it into the audience. Heenan, however, grabbed the bag holding the remainder of the winnings and ran from ringside. As a result of the match, Andr\u00e9 was able to continue his undefeated streak unscathed. After all the men had left ringside, it was time for the WWF Women's Championship match between Wendi Richter, managed by singer Cyndi Lauper, and Leilani Kai, managed by former champion The Fabulous Moolah. Shortly after the match began, Moolah grabbed Richter as she was outside on the floor, but Lauper saved her from an attack. Kai then performed a flying crossbody from the top rope, but Richter used Kai's momentum to roll-up Kai in a pinning position. With this pin, Richter became the new Women's Champion.\nThe main event and last match of the night pitted Hulk Hogan, the reigning WWF Champion, and Mr. T, accompanied by Jimmy Snuka, against Roddy Piper and Paul Orndorff, accompanied by Cowboy Bob Orton. Professional boxer Muhammad Ali was the special guest referee. First, Piper, Orndorff, and Orton made their way to the ring as drums and bagpipes played, causing the crowd to boo. Crowd favorites Hogan, Mr. T, and Snuka made their way to the ring next. The match began with Mr. T and Piper in the ring and the two traded blows. Mid-way through the match, all four men began brawling in the ring, and Muhammad Ali punched Piper in an attempt to restore order. After the match's order was restored, Orndorff and Piper had the offensive advantage. As Orndorff locked Hogan into a full nelson, Orton climbed the top rope to attempt to knock out Hogan. Instead, Orton mistakenly hit Orndorff, and Hogan pinned him to win the match. In frustration, Piper knocked out the other official, Pat Patterson, and went backstage.\nAftermath.\nApproximately three months after WrestleMania, Nikolai Volkoff and Iron Sheik lost the title back to The U.S. Express (Mike Rotundo and Barry Windham). They held the title until August, when the team of Brutus Beefcake and Greg Valentine became the new champions. The duo, later known as The Dream Team, revitalized the WWF's tag team scene and feuded with The British Bulldogs.\nAfter Andr\u00e9 the Giant defeated Big John Studd at the event, Studd formed a tag team with King Kong Bundy, and the duo faced Andr\u00e9 and Hulk Hogan on a number of occasions.\nIn late 1985, Wendi Richter was defeated by The Fabulous Moolah, losing her WWF Women's Championship in controversial fashion. Moolah, who wrestled as a masked female wrestler known as The Spider Lady, won the title after convincing an official to call the match in her favor, but Richter was unaware of the planned title change. Richter left the WWF shortly after, and Moolah held the title for approximately two years.\nIn a new storyline after WrestleMania, Roddy Piper began training Cowboy Bob Orton as a boxer. Hulk Hogan accepted a challenge on the behalf of Mr. T to face Orton in match on an episode of \"Saturday Night's Main Event\". After Mr. T won the match, Orton and Piper attacked him, leading to a boxing match at WrestleMania II between Piper and Mr. T. At the second annual WrestleMania, Piper was disqualified in the third round.\nBroadcast.\nThe event was viewed by over one million fans through closed circuit television, making it the largest event on closed-circuit television in the United States at the time.\nA technical glitch ended the closed circuit broadcast early into the showing at the Civic Arena in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. To appease angry fans who pelted the screen with garbage, WrestleMania was broadcast in its entirety on a local television station two weeks later."}

He played for the Montreal Canadiens from 1953 to 1963; during this time, the team won the Stanley Cup six times, including five wins in a row.\nPlante first retired in 1965, but he was asked to come back to the NHL to play for a new team, the St. Louis Blues, in 1968. Plante was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1970, and then to the Boston Bruins in 1973. He joined the World Hockey Association, first as coach and general manager for the Quebec Nordiques in 1973\u201374. After his time with Quebec was not successful, Plante played goal for the Edmonton Oilers in 1974\u201375. Plante retired for the last time during training camp in the 1975-76 season.\nPlante is considered one of the most important inventors in ice hockey. Most importantly, Plante was the first NHL goaltender to always wear mask when playing. With the help of other experts, he made and tested many versions of the goalie mask, including a version of today's mask/helmet combination. Plante was the first goaltender to regularly play the puck outside his crease in support of his team's defencemen, and often instructed his teammates from behind the play, as the goaltender usually has the best view of the game.\nPlante was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1978. He was chosen as the goaltender of the Canadiens' \"dream team\" in 1985. He was inducted into the Quebec Sports Pantheon in 1994. Lastly, the Montreal Canadiens retired Plante's sweater, #1, in 1995.\nPlante was the eldest of 11 children. In 1949, he married Jacqueline Gagn\u00e9; they had two sons, Michel and Richard. In 1970, Plante met his second wife, Raymonde Udrisard, with whom he eventually moved to Switzerland.

Letourneau sold his stake in the club in 1930, and Dandurand and Cattarinich continued as owners until selling the team in 1935 for $165,000.\nAlong with hockey, Dandurand and his partners were heavily involved with horse racing. In 1932, they bought Blue Bonnets Raceway in Montreal. They owned 17 tracks in Quebec, Ontario, New York, Ohio, Delaware, Illinois, Utah, and Louisiana at the time of Cattarinich's death in 1938. Dandurand was also a boxing and wrestling promoter in Montreal and a director of the Montreal Royals baseball team.\nIn 1946, Dandurand founded the Montreal Alouettes football team with Eric Cradock and Lew Hayman. The team played in the Interprovincial Rugby Football Union, which later became the CFL's east division.\nIn his later years, Dandurand owned a successful restaurant in downtown Montreal. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1963 and died of a heart attack on June 26, 1964 at age 75.\nThe Leo Dandurand Trophy is a CFL award presented each year to the most outstanding lineman in the East Division."}

Jennings Trophy is an award in the National Hockey League (NHL) given each year to \"to the goalkeeper(s) having played a minimum of 25 games for the team with the fewest goals scored against it. Winners are selected based on regular-season play.\" Up until 1981, the Vezina Trophy had been awarded under that definition, but it was later changed and replaced by the Jennings Trophy. Since it began in 1982, it has been awarded at the end of 25 seasons to 27 different players. The most recent winners are Corey Crawford of the Chicago Blackhawks and Carey Price of the Montreal Canadiens, who both allowed only 189 team goals against for their teams in the 2014\u201315 NHL season.\nHistory.\nUntil the 1980\u201381 season, the Vezina Trophy was awarded to the goaltender(s) of the team allowing the fewest goals during the regular season. However, it was discovered that this often meant the trophy went to the goaltender of the better team rather than the individual, so they changed it to offer the Vezina to the most outstanding goaltender, as voted by the NHL General Managers. The William M. Jennings Trophy was created as a replacement and is given to the goaltender(s) playing for the team with the fewest goals scored against them.\nThe Jennings Trophy was donated by the NHL's board of governors and first handed out at the end of the 1981\u201382 season. It is named for the late William M. Jennings, who was a governor and president of the New York Rangers and who helped build ice hockey in the United States. Normally the lowest number of games a goaltender must play to be eligible for the trophy is 25, but for the lockout shortened 1994\u201395 season, the lowest was fourteen games.\nFive players have won both the Jennings and Vezina Trophy for the same season: Patrick Roy (1988\u201389 and 1991\u201392), Ed Belfour (1990\u201391 and 1992\u201393), Dominik Hasek (1993\u201394 and 2000\u201301), Martin Brodeur (2002\u201303 and 2003\u201304) and Miikka Kiprusoff (2005\u201306). Roy has won the trophy five times, the most of any goaltender. Belfour and Brodeur are tied for second, having each won the trophy four times. It has been won most often by the Montreal Canadiens, on 5 occasions. The New Jersey Devils have won four times, and Buffalo Sabres and Chicago Blackhawks have three wins each.\nWinners.\nBold Player with the fewest goals ever scored against in a season.\nNotes.\n\"For the 2002\u201303 season, there was a tie between Martin Brodeur of the New Jersey Devils and Robert Esche and Roman Cechmanek of the Philadelphia Flyers.

In 2006 \"ECW\" was added to the draft.\nHistory.\nRAW and SmackDown!\nBackground.\nAfter buying World Championship Wrestling (WCW), its business opponent through the 1990s, in March 2001, the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) wanted to find a way to split itself into two separate brands, because of the numbers of Superstars that it had gotten as part of WCW's purchase. On March 18, 2002, Linda McMahon announced the \"brand extension\" in which the company would be split into two distinct brands.\nIn terms of storyline, Ric Flair had become co-owner of the WWF following Survivor Series 2001 where Shane and Stephanie McMahon sold their stocks to Flair in order to buy WCW and Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW). Vince McMahon did not like having to share his creation with Flair and looked for a way to stop their partnership. After entering a feud with The Undertaker, Flair sought a match with him at WrestleMania X8. However, the WWF Board of Directors would only allow the match if Flair were to give all control of the WWF to McMahon. Flair agreed, however, the Board also reserved the right to review the ownership status of the WWF following WrestleMania. Their decision was to split the entire WWF roster into two separate brands, with Vince McMahon in control of the SmackDown! brand and Ric Flair in control of the RAW brand. A draft was started the following week on \"RAW\". Each owner would get a total of thirty picks. The brand extension officially began on April 1, 2002. By having two brands in place, the WWF was able to increase the number of live events held each year from 200 to 350.\nSuperstar selections.\nThe 2002 World Wrestling Federation (WWF) Brand Extension Draft took place at Penn State University in State College, Pennsylvania on March 25, 2002. The first half of the draft was televised live on TNN for two hours, on WWE's flagship program, Raw. The second half, or the supplemental draft, was conducted over the internet on WWF's official website, WWF.com. There were thirty draft picks, with sixty superstars drafted overall by co-owners of the WWF, Ric Flair and Vince McMahon, onto their respective brands, RAW and SmackDown!. For the televised half of the draft, ten brand selections were manually made by Flair and McMahon. The supplemental draft was however conducted as a draft lottery, with each brand receiving twenty random draft selections.\nOn the March 18, 2002 episode of \"RAW\", Vince McMahon won a coin toss to determine who would receive the first draft selection.\n\"Note:\nAftermath.\nOn the June 10, 2002 edition of \"Raw\", McMahon became the only owner of World Wrestling Entertainment when he defeated Flair in a No Holds Barred match.\nECW.\nBackground.\nAfter World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) bought all of Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) in 2003, the company began releasing DVDs showing the original ECW. Soon afterwards, the company promoted two ECW reunion shows for ECW Alumni entitled, ECW One Night Stand in 2005 and in 2006.\nOn May 26, 2006, WWE announced a new brand, ECW, a revival of the 1990s show. The new brand debuted on its current network, the SCI FI Channel on June 13 2006.\nSuperstar selections.\nThe 2006 World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) Brand Extension Draft took place from the Tacoma Dome in Tacoma, Washington on May 29, 2006, where ECW representative, Paul Heyman, drafted two superstars, one from SmackDown! and one from RAW onto the new ECW brand.\nAftermath.\nIn late 2007, SmackDown! and ECW superstars began to appear on both shows as part of a (kayfabe) deal between ECW General Manager Armando Estrada and SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero.\nImpact.\nInterbrand competition.\nInterbrand competition was kept at a minimum, with superstars from all brands competing together only at pay-per-view events. However, in 2003, all pay per view events became brand exclusive, leaving the \"big four\" pay-per-views (WrestleMania, SummerSlam, Survivor Series, and the Royal Rumble) as the only interbrand shows.\nStarting in late 2006, in an attempt to add more star power to the shows, interbrand matches became more common. Most notably, MNM and The Hardys reformed, despite the fact that the teammates were on separate brands. Bobby Lashley is also notable for his interbrand action, who was involved in a storyline with the WWE Chairman, Vince McMahon. The return of \"Saturday Night's Main Event\" to NBC has also lead to more interaction between the brands.\nPay-per-views.\nThe separation of the WWE roster between two brands also intended to split the pay-per-view offerings, which began with Bad Blood in June 2003. The original idea had the \"major\" pay-per-view events at the time (Royal Rumble, SummerSlam, Survivor Series, and WrestleMania) would contain the only instances where wrestlers from different brands would interact with each other, and even among the four shows only the Royal Rumble and WrestleMania would have wrestlers from different brands competing against each other. Wrestlers, as a result, appeared only in 2/3 of the shows. Eventually, WWE abandoned the practice of single-brand pay-per-view events following WrestleMania 23. December to Dismember and New Year's Revolution were cancelled following the announcement.\nChampionships.\nInitially, the WWE Undisputed Championship and WWE Women's Championship were available to both brands. The other championships were exclusive to the brand the champion was a part of. With several specialty championships being exclusive to one brand, numerous wrestlers were left with no title to fight for.\nThis issue was solved in September 2002 when the Undisputed Championship became the WWE Championship again and was moved to SmackDown! while Eric Bischoff created the World Heavyweight Championship for RAW.&lt;ref name=\"WWE/World\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, SmackDown! created their own\nRaw created WWE Raw Tag Team Championship, revived the United States Championship, and became the exclusive home of the Cruiserweight Championship. Meanwhile, Smackdown became the exclusive brand for WWE's original WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship, the Intercontinental Championship, and the Women's Championship. The end result was each brand having four championships. When ECW was revived in 2006, the ECW Championship was re-established and is that brand's world title."}

{"id": "112000", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=112000", "title": "Royal Rumble", "text": "The Royal Rumble is a yearly professional wrestling pay-per-view event, aired every January by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). The show's main event is a Battle Royal-type match, named the Royal Rumble match. The pay-per-view is part of WWE's \"Big Four\", along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series. The Royal Rumble is also one of WWE's more popular pay-per-views.\nSince 1993, the winner of the Rumble match has received a title match at that year's WrestleMania.\nHistory.\nMatch.\nThe idea behind the Royal Rumble match is credited to Pat Patterson. Before the match begins, the contestants draw spots in the Rumble. The match consists of thirty men, beginning with the two men who chose entry numbers one and two in the ring. At regular timed intervals, usually ninety seconds, one of the remaining 28 wrestlers enters the ring. Participants must eliminate all other opponents, and the winner of the event is the last wrestler remaining after all others have been eliminated. \nSimilar to a Battle Royal, a wrestler is eliminated when thrown over the top rope, with both feet touching the floor. A referee, who is seated at ringside, must see an elimination in order for it to be valid. A wrestler who is eliminated without a referee noticing may sometimes sneak back into the match. For example, Stone Cold Steve Austin was eliminated during the 1997 event, but he re-entered without the referees' seeing and eventually won the match. A wrestler who leaves the ring without going over the top rope is not eliminated from the match. During the 1999 Rumble match, both Vince McMahon and Steve Austin left the ring, only to return later in the match. In the 1994 match, the last two wrestlers, Bret Hart and Lex Luger were declared co-winners when it was decided that both of their feet touched the floor at the same time. A similar situation occurred in the 2005 match, however the match was restarted after Batista and John Cena eliminated each other at the same time. Batista eliminated Cena afterwards to win the match.\nThe reward for the 1992 Royal Rumble was the WWF Championship. The tradition of granting a WWE Championship match at WrestleMania started in 1993. Beginning in 2004, the winner had their choice of a World Heavyweight Championship or WWE Championship match at WrestleMania. Due to the revival of the ECW World Championship as a brand championship in mid-2006, the 2007 Rumble added this championship as a choice to the winning wrestler. From 2001 to 2007 the Royal Rumble match winner has gone on to win a World Championship title at WrestleMania. After winning the 2008 match, John Cena became the first to use his championship opportunity at an event other than WrestleMania. He also became the first man since 2000 to win the Royal Rumble match but fail to win the title in his championship opportunity as a result.\nPay-per-view.\nThe Royal Rumble is a pay-per-view consisting of the Royal Rumble match, championship matches, and various other matches. The first Royal Rumble took place on January 24, 1988 and was broadcast live on the USA Network. The following year, the event became a pay-per-view. It is part of WWE's \"classic five\" pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Survivor Series, SummerSlam, and King of the Ring.\nThe Royal Rumble match is usually at the top of the card. However, it is not always the case, as the 2006 event had the match in the middle of the pay-per-view.\nThe first Rumble match featured only twenty men, and it was called the Rumble Royale. It lasted about 33 minutes of the 2-hour broadcast. Today, Rumble matches are much longer, with the longest match, at the 2002 event, lasting over 1 hour and 9 minutes of a 3-hour pay-per-view.\nWith the brand extension introduced in mid-2002, the 30 entrants from 2003 to 2006 had 15 wrestlers from both the RAW and SmackDown! brands. At first, the winner of the match received a shot at his brand's champion. Starting in 2004, the Rumble winner had the option of challenging either brand's champion. For instance, Chris Benoit switched brands in 2004 and won the World Heavyweight Championship. The 2007 Royal Rumble marked the first year participants from the ECW brand competed along with the RAW and SmackDown! brands. The winner of the Royal Rumble now has the option to challenge for the ECW World Championship as well.\nThe 2008 Royal Rumble was the first WWE pay-per-view to be aired in HD.\nVideo box set.\nOn March 13, 2007, WWE released a full DVD box-set called \"Royal Rumble: The Complete Anthology\", which showcases every Royal Rumble event in its entirety.\nOther websites.\nGeneral\nSpecific"}

The event also had the returning Undertaker beat Kane after a Tombstone Piledriver.\nBackground.\nThe main feud at the start of the pay-per-view was on the Raw brand, with Triple H, Shawn Michaels and Chris Benoit feuding over the World Heavyweight Championship. Triple H was the champion going into the event. At the Royal Rumble event two months before, Triple H and Michaels had fought each other with the World Heavyweight Championship, they were both trying to win the Last Man Standing match. The match ended in a draw after neither of them could answer a ten-count when Michaels did the Superkick. As a result, Triple H kept the title. Also at the pay-per-view, in the real Royal Rumble match, SmackDown!'s Benoit won the contest, eliminating The Big Show last. The next night, on the January 26 edition of \"Raw\", Michaels and Triple H had a in-ring promo when Raw's Sheriff, Stone Cold Steve Austin then came into the ring. He said that, even though Michaels should have a rematch, he had to \"enforce the law.\" He also said that, in the rules it says that the winner of the Royal Rumble may face either the WWE Champion or World Heavyweight Champion. The winner of the Royal Rumble, Benoit went into the ring, and said that he would be fighting the World Heavyweight Champion at WrestleMania XX. On the February 2 edition of \"Raw\", Benoit was booked to play in his first contest on the brand, defeating Mark Henry, while making him submit to the Crippler Crossface in front of Triple H, who tried to distract Benoit. Both Triple H and Michaels were also in singles action later in night, defeating Spike Dudley and Randy Orton respectively. After the Michaels fought Orton, Triple H tried to attack Michaels, but Benoit chased Triple H away. Benoit and Michaels then went on to shake hands. The next week on \"Raw\", after Benoit defeated Ric Flair, a contract signing for the World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania XX took place. Triple H signed the contract for the match, but just as Benoit was about to sign the contract to confirm the match, Michaels made his way to the ring. Michaels stated that he wanted to finish his long-running feud with Triple H at Madison Square Garden. As Benoit was about to say that is not going to happen, Michaels cut him off by Superkicking him. Michaels then went on to sign the contract. On the February 16 edition of \"Raw\", Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff said that Triple H should defend his championship against either Michaels and Benoit on that night, but Triple H rejected the proposal. Benoit, however, made his way to the ring, and put Triple H in the Crossface submission maneuver. Because Triple H rejected the proposal, Bischoff booked a match between Michaels and Benoit for the main event. Benoit looked set to win, but Triple H distracted him, allowing Michaels to perform the Superkick on Benoit. Triple H began to celebrate with Michaels, but instead did the Pedigree on Michaels. Moments later, Austin came to ringside, and said that Triple H would defend the title against both Michaels and Benoit at WrestleMania in a Triple Threat match.\nEvent.\nThe event began with the Boys Choir of Harlem singing \"America the Beautiful\". The first match that aired was a singles match between The Big Show and John Cena for the WWE United States Championship. In the beginning of the match Cena scoop slammed The Big Show twice. Cena then grabbed his signature chain and attacked Big Show with it. However the referee saw Cena and took the chain from him. With the referee holding the chain with his back turned, Cena hit Big Show with hidden brass knuckles. And then did his signature FU maneuver. Cena then quickly pinned The Big Show to win the match and the United States Championship. This match was the first time that the United States Championship had been defended at a WrestleMania.\nThe next match was a Fatal Four-Way tag match between Rob Van Dam and Booker T, Garrison Cade and Mark Jindrak, The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray and D-Von) and La R\u00e9sistance (Ren\u00e9 Dupr\u00e9e and Rob Conway) for the World Tag Team Championship. The match ended when Conway was pinned by Van Dam after Booker T used his Scissor kick maneuver on Conway. That was followed by Van Dam's Five-Star Frog Splash. Booker T and Rob Van Dam kept the titles as a result.\nThe third match was between Christian and Chris Jericho. Christian won the match after Trish Stratus hit Jericho on the face with her elbow. Next up was a Handicap match with Evolution (Randy Orton, Batista and Ric Flair) and The Rock 'n' Sock Connection (The Rock and Mick Foley).

Kidman was then pinned and eliminated by Rey Mysterio. Tajiri was next to fight, but was pinned by Mysterio. Akio was the next scheduled fighter, but was not able to compete because he was inadvertently attacked by Tajiri when Mysterio ducked. The Crusierweight Champion, Chavo Guerrero was the final entrant and pinned Mysterio to win with the assistance of his father Chavo Guerrero, Sr., thus keeping the WWE Cruiserweight Championship.\nThe seventh match had Brock Lesnar and Goldberg with special guest referee, Steve Austin. The beginning of the match began with both men staring each other down, making much heat from the fans throughout the match. Goldberg then took Lesnar down with a Spear, that would only draw a two count after a pin attempt. Lesnar then did the F-5 maneuver on Goldberg, but also resulted in a two-count pin attempt. Afterwards, Lesnar missed an attempt to knock Goldberg down, allowing Goldberg to execute another spear and a successful Jackhammer maneuver that led to a three count for Goldberg, thus winning the match. After the match, Steve Austin did a Stone Cold Stunner on both fighters to the crowd's delight and celebrated with beer in the ring.\nThe eight match was the encounter of Victoria and Molly Holly for the WWE Women's Championship, where Holly would have to be shaved bald if she lost. Victoria would counter a Widow's peak maneuver attempt by Holly into a Backslide pin, drawing a three count, thus winning the match and retaining the WWE Women's Championship. Holly tried running towards the backstage area to escape the match's stipulation, but was eventually stopped by Victoria who would knock her out and place her onto the barber's chair, shaving her bald.\nThe next match had Eddie Guerrero and Kurt Angle fighting over the WWE Championship. Guerrero used a DDT and Frog Splash maneuver on Angle that would result in a two-count pin attempt. Angle then secured Guerrero with an Ankle lock hold. However, Guerrero escaped the hold by rolling through it and throwing Angle out of the ring. As Angle was outside, Guerrero loosened his ring boot to relieve the pain. As Angle returned to the ring, he applied another Ankle lock on Guerrero that would end up being unsuccessful with Guerrero escaping the hold by pushing Angle off with his other foot leaving Angle holding the Guerrero's loosened ring boot. With Angle confused, Guerrero did a Roll-up pin maneuver leading to a successful pinfall, thus winning the match and retaining the WWE Championship.\nThe tenth match of the event was the encounter of The Undertaker and Kane, which would be Undertaker's first match since he was buried alive at Survivor Series 2003. The Undertaker made his return under his \"Deadman\" gimmick, as he was accompanied to the ring by Paul Bearer. The two wrestlers brawled in the beginning of the match, until Kane used a Chokeslam maneuver on Undertaker, which made no effect as Undertaker sat up immediately afterwards. The Undertaker then retaliated by Chokeslamming Kane and executing a Tombstone piledriver into a successful pinfall, thus winning the match and remaining undefeated at WrestleMania with a 12-0 record.\nThe main event was a Triple threat match over the World Heavyweight Championship between Triple H, Chris Benoit, and Shawn Michaels. This was the seventh title defense of the night, the most in WrestleMania history. Benoit gained control over Michaels when he did the Crossface hold. As Michaels was about to submit, Triple H would save the match. Triple H and Michaels teamed up to suplex Benoit through the announcer's table. Michaels then attempted to hit Benoit with a Sweet Chin Music maneuver, but Benoit countered it, throwing Michaels out of the ring. As this occurred, Triple H attempted to Pedigree Benoit. However, Benoit also countered it and held Triple H with Crossface hold that would force Triple H to submit. As a result, Benoit won the match and the World Heavyweight Championship.\nAftermath.\nEven though WWE tried hard to promote the Brock Lesnar versus Goldberg contest, some critics were not happy with the match. Many in Madison Square Garden booed the fighters, and only cheered for Steve Austin because both of the fighters were leaving the WWE after the event.\nAt Backlash, the original main event match was between Chris Benoit and Shawn Michaels for the World Heavyweight Championship. But on the March 29 edition of \"Raw\", after being traded to SmackDown! and brought back to Raw, Triple H said that the match at Backlash be changed to Benoit against Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship. Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff liked the idea of the match, but ended by saying that he made a promise to Michaels to give him a World title match at Backlash; instead, Bischoff booked a Triple Threat match between Benoit, Michaels and Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship. At Backlash, Benoit kept the World title, after he made Michaels submit to the Sharpshooter.\nThe feud between Kurt Angle and Eddie Guerrero continued. On the March 25 edition of \"SmackDown!\", Angle was made the on-screen General Manager of SmackDown!, as part to the storyline of Angle's legit neck problems. This angle would also play on the April 15 edition of \"SmackDown!\", when he said talked abou the injuries he got when The Big Show chokeslammed Angle off a ledge. In reality Angle said that he would be heaving neck surgery in May and would not be fighting until August. At The Great American Bash, Angle cost Guerrero the WWE title in a Texas Bull Rope match against John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield, after Angle changed the result of the match when Guerrero looked to have won the title. In the same month, Angle's position as General Manager of SmackDown! came to an end when he was fired by WWE Chairman Vince McMahon, after McMahon had exposed that Angle was not really injured. At SummerSlam, Angle and Guerrero were booked in a match, in which it saw Angle defeat Guerrero after he made Guerrero submit to the Ankle lock."}

In most cases, the position of power is important. The child is either unwilling or unable to consent. Children below the age of consent are unable to consent. In some cases activities such as kissing and hugging may be included. \nSexual abuse does emotional harm to children. Some of the effects do not show right away, and appear when the child has grown up. These effects can include depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, borderline personality disorder, a higher chance of later abuse, and physical injury. Suicide is one of the effects with victims being six times more likely to commit suicide and eight times more likely to attempt suicide over and over again throughout their lives. \nThere are different types of offenders. When a child is sexually abused by a family member, it is called \"incest,\" and causes even more serious long-term psychological trauma than abuse by a stranger, especially when the incest is done by a parent. Child sexual abuse may committed by pedophiles (adults who are sexually attracted to children have not begun puberty) or by people who are not pedophiles; there are different reports on the number who are or are not pedophiles.\nChild sexual abuse is not rare. Around a quarter of all women and a tenth of all men were sexually abused when they were children. Different places in the world have different rates of child sexual abuse. Disabled children are more likely to be sexually abused than non-disabled children. For most children who are sexually abused, the person who abused them is somebody that they know. Around a third of child sexual abuse is by a relative of the child, most often fathers, uncles or cousins. Only around a tenth of child sexual abuse cases were abused by strangers, and the rest are other people whom the child knows such as friends of the family, babysitters, or neighbors. Men are the offenders in most child sexual abuse; women are the offenders in around 10% of the cases."}

There are two varieties of Kudu. The Lesser Kudu and the Greater Kudu. The Lesser Kudu live in Eastern Africa and Kenya and Tanzania. The Greater Kudu live in Eastern and Southern Africa. \nAppearance.\nThey are a brown-grey color with white stripes that go down the center of their body. They are very fast and stealthy. For these facts their other African name is Grey Ghost. The males have tall spiraling horns. The females regularly have no horns. Greater Kudus are more slender than lesser Kudus. Baby Kudus usually are a lighter brown than adult Kudus.\nGrouping and behavior.\nMale Kudus live widespread from the group, or in bachelor groups. The males do not normally have long fights over dominance. They normally prepare to fight but one stands up more lateral, making himself look larger and more of a threat. Males are only seen with females during mating season, in groups of 6-10 with their offspring. The calves grow very quickly and are usually ready to leave their mother at around six months. \nDiet.\nThey do not eat meat, they eat plant shoots, and in dry season they eat fruit like wild watermelon for the liquid and natural sugars. The lesser kudu is less dependent on water sources than the greater kudu."}

He played 12 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL). He played 10 seasons with the Boston Bruins and two seasons with the Detroit Red Wings. He won the Vezina Trophy, given to the NHL's best goaltender, four times. He was added to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1959. He won the Stanley Cup once, in 1929 with Boston. At the start of the 1938\u201339 season, after ten entire seasons with Boston, he was traded to the Detroit Red Wings, where he played the rest of the season, and played another full one before stopping. During his time in the NHL, Thompson made 81 shutouts. This is the sixth-most of any goaltender. After stopping playing, he coached some lower-league teams before becoming a famous professional . Thompson helped to make common the technique of catching the puck as a method of making a save. He was good at using his stick to play the puck. He was the first goaltender in the NHL to record an assist by passing the puck with his stick to a player on his team.\nEarly life.\nThompson was born in Sandon, British Columbia, on May 31, 1903. He grew up in Calgary, Alberta. In 1906, his brother Paul was born in Calgary. Paul would also become a professional ice hockey player. When Cecil was a child, he enjoyed playing baseball and ice hockey. At first, Cecil was not a goaltender. He became a goaltender so that the other children would allow him to play with them. When he became a teenager, other persons on his team began to call him \"Tiny\" since he was the tallest player. He would be known as \"Tiny\" for the rest of career.\nThompson began playing junior hockey when he was 16 with the Calgary Monarchs. In his first season, he competed for the Memorial Cup. The Memorial Cup is given to the best junior ice hockey team in Canada. In the two games in which he competed for the Memorial Cup, he gave up 11 goals, which was an average number of goals to give up in that period of ice hockey.\nIn the 1920\u201321 season, Thompson played for Calgary Alberta Grain. In the next three seasons, he played for a team in Bellevue, Alberta. In the 1924\u201325 season, he joined the Duluth Hornets. He played 40 games for the Hornets. In those 45 games, he had 11 shutouts.\nIn the next season, Thompson joined the Minneapolis Millers of the American Hockey Association (AHA). He played for the Millers for three seasons. During that time, he appeared in 118 games, making 33 shutouts. He had a 1.37 goals-against average, which is an average of goals surrendered in a span of sixty minutes).\nNHL career.\nBoston Bruins.\nThompson started playing in the National Hockey League (NHL) in the 1928\u201329 season. He joined the Boston Bruins since Boston manager Art Ross bought his contract from Minnesota. He did so because he had heard that Thompson was a very good goaltender.\nIn his first-ever game, Thompson made a shutout. He is the only goaltender that is in the Hockey Hall of Fame that has made a shutout in his first game. I In his first season, Thompson played in all of Boston's 44 games. He made 12 shutouts and has a 1.15 goals-against average. In one full season, a goals-against average of 1.15 is the second-lowest ever in NHL history. George Hainsworth has a lower goals-against average of 0.98 that season, which is the lowest-ever goals-against average for a full season. The Boston Bruins were in first place in the American Division, and they made the playoffs. In the playoffs, they won all of their five games, as they won the Stanley Cup for their first time. In the five playoff games, Thompson made three shutouts, and gave up only three goals during the playoffs. In that season, two brothers, Cecil and Paul, played against each other for the first time in the NHL. Cecil and Paul also played against each other in the Stanley Cup Finals, which was also the first time when brothers played against each other.\nIn the next season, Cecil played in all of Boston's 44 games again. He made three shutouts and he had a 2.19 goals-against average. Thompson made much less shutouts and a much higher goals-against average because the rules were changed so that players were allowed to pass forward in the attacking area. That season, Boston won all but six games, finishing with a 38\u20135\u20131 record, which is the highest-ever winning percentage of any team in the NHL. In the playoffs, they lost two games in a row for the first time in that season. The lost the Stanley Cup finals against the Montreal Canadiens. Earlier in the playoffs, his streak of winning his first seven games was ended. It remains the longest winning streak to start a playoff career. Thompson won his first out of four Vezina Trophies that season.\nIn the 1930\u201331 season, he played all 44 games again, and was named to the Second All-Star team. In the next season, Boston lost the semi-finals of the playoffs to Montreal. In the second game of the series against Montreal, Thompson was removed from the net near the end of the game. That was so done so Boston would have six attacking players against Montreal's five. Having more attacking players gave Boston a bigger chance to score. Although Boston lost, their coach's idea was described as \"amazing\".\nIn the 1931\u201332 season, Boston did not play in the playoffs for the first time when Thompson played for them. He missed five games during that season, which was the only time that happened to him. In the 43 games he played, Thompson won only 13. The next season, Boston made the playoffs again, but they lost to the Toronto Maple Leafs.\nThe last game of the playoff series against the Maple Leafs was described as Thompson's best. In that game, Boston and Toronto were tied after three usual periods of 20 minutes. Since the game was tied, it proceeded to overtime. After five periods of 20 minutes, the game was tied. At end of the fifth overtime period, managers Conn Smythe of the Maple Leafs and Art Ross of the Bruins ask the president of the NHL, Frank Calder, to stop the game, and finish it later. Calder refused. Early in the sixth overtime period, a pass from Boston player Eddie Shore was intercepted. Ken Doraty of the Maple Leafs went for a breakaway, meaning that he had the puck and was skating toward the other team's net with out any defender between him and Thompson. He scored on Thompson at 4:46 of the sixth overtime period. Even though he lost the game, he was applauded loudly by the fans at Maple Leaf Gardens. This game was the second-longest ever played in the NHL. Even though Thompson lost more games than he won in the playoffs, he finished wit a 1.23 goals-against average.\nThompson got his second Vezina Trophy in the 1932\u201333 season, making 11 shutouts and getting a 1.76 goals-against average. The next season, Boston missed the playoffs. In the 1934\u201335 season, Boston placed first in the American Division. Thompson was chosen to the Second All-Star team for his second time. The Bruins won only one of their four playoff games. Their only win came when Thompson had a shutouts. He finished the playoffs with a 1.53 goals-against average.\nIn the 1935\u201336 season, Thompson made 10 shutouts, but Boston won only 22 out of 48 games. During that season, Thompson made an assist, meaning that he had made a pass on purpose to a teammate, who scored a goal as a result of getting the puck from him. At that time time, it was very rare for a goaltender to do that. At the end of the season, he was named to First All-Star team for his first time. He also won the Vezina Trophy for his third time. In that season's playoffs, Boston's series against the Toronto Maple Leafs was a series of contrasts. Boston lost the two-game, total-goal series eight goals to six. In one game, Boston won against Toronto 6\u20130, but they lost the other game 8\u20130.\nIn the 1937\u201338, Thompson played his last entire season with the Bruins. He won 30 out of the 48 games, but Boston lost to the Maple Leafs once again in the playoffs. At end of the season, he won his fourth and last Vezina Trophy, and was named to the First All-Star team for the second time.\nDetroit Red Wings.\nThompson played only five games in the 1938\u201339 season, because the Bruins decided to replace him with Frank Brimsek. To make space for Brimsek, Thompson was traded to the Detroit Red Wings for Normie Smith and $15,000. Thompson also received $1000 from Boston. Art Ross, still the manager of the Bruins, predicted that Thompson would play five more years for Detroit; however, he only played two. Although Detroit lost more games than they won, they made the playoffs in both seasons, but they did not win the Stanley Cup. Overall, Thompson appeared in 85 regular season games for Detroit, recording a 32\u201341\u201312 record, seven shutouts, and a 2.54 goals-against average, and in 11 playoff games, posting a 5\u20136, with one shutout and a 2.41 goal-against average.\nPost-NHL career.\nAfter stopping being a professional player, Thompson became a coach. In the 1940\u201341 season, he started to coach the Buffalo Bisons of the American Hockey League (AHL). He coached the Bisons for 56 games in two seasons. They missed the playoffs both times. In the 1940\u201341 season, he played one game for the Bisons as an emergency goaltender.\nDuring World War II, Thompson served in the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). He was also the coach of the Calgary RCAF Mustangs of the Alberta Senior Hockey League. He led the Mustangs to the league championship series in 1942\u201343 against the Calgary Currie Army team. In March 1943, injuries to the Mustangs' goaltenders made him play again. With Thompson in goal, the Mustangs won against Currie Army, 8\u20134, to tie the best-of-five series at two wins each. He played the deciding game, but his team fell short of winning the Alberta title with a 3\u20131 loss.\nAfter the war, Thompson became chief Western Canada scout for the Chicago Black Hawks. He was one of few scouts who tried to find a player's personality along with their playing skills, often talking with players as part of efforts to learn about the players he was watching.\nPlaying style.\nThompson was stand-up goaltender, which mean he rarely fell to both knees to try to stop the puck. He was one of the first goaltenders in the NHL to catch the puck in order to stop it. He was the best puck-catcher when he played. With gloves smaller than one of other players, Thompson did not have a lot of padding when he was in net.\nHe often used the same, or very similar method, to stop pucks. He dropped to one knee with the paddle of his goalstick covering the space between his legs, and extending his glove to cover the left side of the net. Although he caught the puck with his glove, he did so without gloves that were like the modern blocker and trapper. The blocker is a glove which is worn on the hand which holds the stick and is used to hit shots on goal back. The trapper is a glove which is worn on the other hand and used to catch shots on goal).\nThompson was described by Johnny Bower, a former goaltender who was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, as being able to play the puck well with his stick, and one of the best of his time at passing the puck. In the 1935\u201336 season, Thompson became the first goaltender to get an assist by intentionally passing the puck with his stick to a fellow player.\nLegacy.\nThompson's points percentage in a season of .875, recorded in the 1929\u201330 season, still remains a record. His 38 wins during that season was a Boston record that was beat only in the 1982\u201383 season, by Pete Peeters; since then, no Bruins goaltender has had more than 37 wins in a season. Thompson is the all-time Bruins leader for games, wins, shutouts and goals-against average. Throughout his entire NHL career career, Thompson made 81 shutouts, which is sixth all-time in NHL history, which was second to only George Hainsworth (who had 94) when Thompson stopped playing. He also made seven shutouts in the playoffs. He is fifth all-time in goals-against average, allowing on average only 2.08 goals in a 60-minute span. He led all goaltenders in regular season games played 10 times, and in regular season wins five times.\nIn 1959, Thompson was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. He died in Calgary on February 9, 1981. He was survived by his wife, Edith, and his daughter, Sandra."}

The voting is conducted by members of the Professional Hockey Writers Association at the conclusion of each regular season to determine the winner.\nHistory.\nThe trophy is named in honor of Frank Calder, the former President of the National Hockey League from its inception in 1917 to his death in 1943. Although \"Rookie Of The Year\" honors were handed out beginning in 1932\u201333, the Calder Trophy was first presented at the conclusion of the 1936-37 NHL season. After Calder's death in 1942 the trophy was renamed the Calder Memorial Trophy.\nIn 1990, Sergei Makarov of the Calgary Flames became the oldest player, at age 31, to win the Calder, even though he had played professionally in the Soviet Union as a member of HC CSKA Moscow. After that season, the rules for awarding the Calder were amended so that players could only be eligible if they were 26 years old or younger by September 15 of their rookie season.\nTo be eligible for the award, a player cannot have played any more than 25 games previously in any single season, nor have played in more than six games in two separate preceding seasons in any major professional league. The latter fact was perhaps most prominent when in 1979\u201380, first-year phenom Wayne Gretzky was not eligible to win the Calder Trophy despite scoring 137 points (the previous rookie record at the time being 95), due to him playing a full season the previous year in the World Hockey Association. The trophy has been won the most times by rookies from the Toronto Maple Leafs, who have won it on nine occasions.\nThe voting is conducted at the end of the regular season by members of the Professional Hockey Writers Association, and each individual voter ranks their top five candidates on a 10-7-5-3-1 points system. Three finalists are named and the trophy is awarded at the NHL Awards ceremony after the playoffs."}

The empire was founded after Muhammad's death in 632 and lasted until 'Ali's death in 661. At its height, the power of the Rashidun Caliphs extended throughout North Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Iranian highlands.\nOrigin.\nAfter Muhammad's death in 632, the Medinan Ansar were debating who -among them- should succeed prophet Muhammad in running the affairs of the Muslims. They chose Abu Bakr. So he became the first Khalifa Rasul Allah (\"Successor of the Messenger of God\"), and started a campaigns to for the Muslim Religion. At first he the Arabian tribes which had left the Islamic community. As a Khalifa or Caliph he was not a monarch and never claimed such a title. His three successors also never claimed a title as monarch.\nThe first general of the empire was Khalid ibn Walid. During his campaign against the Persian Empire(\"Iraq 633 - 634\") and Byzantine Empire (\"Syria 634 - 638\") Khalid developed brilliant tactics. The Caliph Abu Bakr's way was to give his generals their mission, the geographical area in which that mission would be carried out, and the resources that, could be made available for that purpose. He would then leave it to his generals to accomplish their mission in whatever manner they chose, on the other hand Caliph Umar in later part of his Caliphate used to direct his generals as to where they would stay and when to move to the next target and who will be commanding the left and right wing of the army in the particular battle, this made the phase of conquest comparatively slower but provided well organized campaigns. Caliph Uthman used the same method as of Abu Bakr, he would give missions to his generals and then leave it to them how they accomplish it. Caliph Ali also followed the same method.\nReligion.\nThe state religion was Islam. The non-Muslim people were allowed to practice any religion they want to follow. But the Sharia Law was practiced in the state.\nIslam was the guiding force of the Caliphate. Any act of state was first to be approved by the Qur\u2019an and the Traditions of the Prophet Muhammed. If there were no such guide lines available then wisdom or Hikmat was used, after which if the act would go against the established principals, norms,system etc. it was not carried on with.\nReferences.\nNotes"}

The title became \"Undisputed\" in January 1981 when no other United States title was recognized in other promotions governed by the National Wrestling Alliance. In 1986, the title became a secondary championship in Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling when Jim Crockett Promotions gained control of the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. The title was renamed the World Championship Wrestling (WCW) United States Heavyweight Championship in 1991 when Jim Crockett Promotions became World Championship Wrestling.\nIn March 2001, the World Wrestling Federation purchased World Championship Wrestling from AOL Time Warner.

They are sometimes just called \"pipes\". They have a bag that holds air. The player keeps the bag full of air by blowing into it with a tube or pumping it with a bellows. To make music, the bag is pressed and the air comes out through a kind of flute or \"chanter\". There are usually one or more other tubes coming from the bag that make sounds whenever the bag is squeezed, called \"drones\". Each drone normally plays a different note, and stays on the same note the whole time it is playing, to play a harmony with the \"chanter\". The sounds are made by a single or, more commonly, double reed which vibrates when air is blown over it.\nScotland is traditionally linked to the bagpipes, and many pipe tunes come from there. Many, many other places, however, also have different types of bagpipes: over all of Europe, some of North Africa, and into the Middle East such as the Ottoman Empire.\nThe Scottish pipes, the Great Pipe, or piob-mohr, first had only one drone pipe. The second pipe was added in the mid 1500s and the third pipe was added in the 1700s."}

Rating is voluntary. Game publishers do not have to submit their games for ratings. There are seven ratings: E (Everyone), E10+ (Everyone 10+), T (Teen), M (Mature 17+), AO (Adults Only), and RP (Rating Pending). Some retailers make people show identification to prove their age if they want to buy M-rated games. Many retailers will not buy and sell AO games so it is very hard for gamers to find AO-rated games.\nOn the back of each game's box, the ESRB also rates elements of the game. The back of \"Super Princess Peach\" has the words \"comic mischief\" on it to tell parents that it contains comic mischief.\nControversy.\nThe AO rating.\nSome critics come to believe that the ESRB only rates games AO if they have sex in them, regardless of how explicit the language, violence or even blood is. This also lead them to think the ESRB is not doing its job. Twenty-three games have received and kept adult ratings, but apparently twenty (almost all) games were given it for sexual themes and content. Two had violence, and the other one was given the \"Adult\" rating for real gambling.\n\"Tone Down\" controversy.\nSome publishers of games decide to tone down the game's explicitness in order to qualify for an \"M\" rather than an \"AO\" rating. For example, the game had an original M rating, but the game that could be unlocked by bypassing the patch, called \"Hot Coffee\", seemed to spark major controversy with the game, because it features sex and erotica. Thus, the ESRB decided to re-rate the game as an AO. Rockstar Games then chose to leave the game out of the release, then release an exploit fix that completely disallowed access to the game. However, other games have trouble being \"toned down\". Thrill Kill, for instance, was given an AO, and then Electronic Arts decided to purchase the publisher, Virgin Entertainment. The release of the game was then canceled, and the game never was toned down."}

The Stanley Cup is the third trophy to be used as the league's championship, as for the first nine years of the NHL's existence, it remained a multiple league challenge cup.\nHistory.\nThe NHL's first championship trophy was the O'Brien Trophy, which was created by the National Hockey Association in 1910 and was acquired by the NHL in 1918, after which it was awarded to the playoff champion until 1923. The O'Brien Trophy was retired in favour of the Prince of Wales Trophy in 1924, which became the league's championship until the end of the Western Hockey League following the 1926 season, leaving the Stanley Cup exclusively in the hands of the National Hockey League.\nThe Prince of Wales Trophy remains an active award. It is presently awarded to the playoff champion of the Eastern Conference, while the Clarence S. Campbell Bowl, created in 1967, is currently awarded to the Western Conference champion. The youngest team trophy is the Presidents' Trophy, which has been awarded to the NHL's regular season champion since 1986.\nThe first individual trophy was the Hart Trophy, first awarded in 1924 to the league's most valuable player. The Lady Byng Trophy followed a year later, awarded to the most gentlemanly player in the league. Two years later, the Vezina Trophy was created for the NHL's top goaltender.

He was one of the best known composers of madrigals.\nLife.\nMarenzio may have been born in 1553. We think this because his father once wrote down his son\u2019s age. The date may have been 18 October because that was his saint\u2019s feast day.\nHe had his early education in Brescia possibly in Mantua. Then he moved to Rome, where he worked as a singer for Cardinal Cristoforo Madruzzo. After the cardinal's death he worked at the court of Cardinal Luigi d'Este. Here he started to become known as a composer. By 1581 his music had become extremely popular. His books of madrigals were often reprinted. His madrigals were often included in published collections.\nIn 1587 he moved to Florence where he worked for Ferdinando I de' Medici for two years; in 1589 he returned to Rome, where he spent most of his last years, except for a trip to Poland from 1596 to 1597, during which time he worked at the court of Sigismund III Vasa in Warsaw. It seems from what some people wrote that his trip to Poland ruined his health, and he died in Rome in 1599, shortly after returning from Poland.\nMusic.\nMarenzio wrote some religious music: motets, and madrigals based on religious texts. However, most of his famous music consists of secular (not religious) madrigals. They were written during a period of twenty years, and they vary a lot in style.\nMarenzio published at least fifteen collections of music, mostly madrigals but also \"canzonette\" and \"villanelle\". These were similar to madrigals but very light in character. Some of his later works are very chromatic: they use harmony that was unusual for the time. He often makes the music fit the meaning of the words. This is called word-painting. For example: the phrase \"sinking in the sea\" is sung to notes which go lower and lower.\nInfluence.\nMarenzio\u2019s music had a lot of influence on composers in Italy, as well as in the rest of Europe. There were several of his madrigals in \"Musica transalpina\", a collection of madrigals published in 1588 by Nicholas Yonge in England."}

The Italian words of the madrigals were also translated into English. \"Musica transalpina\" had 57 separate pieces by 18 Italian composers, including Alfonso Ferrabosco and Luca Marenzio. Ferrabosco was living in England at the time.\nThe publication of this book had a huge influence on music in England. It made madrigals very popular in England and during the next twenty years composers such as Thomas Morley, John Wilbye and Thomas Weelkes composed a large number of English madrigals.\nIn 1597 Yonge published a second book of \"Musica transalpina\" which was also very influential.\nThe title \"Musica transalpina\" means: \"music from across the Alps\" because the music came from Italy which was the other side of the Alps."}

It was first shown on television on December 17, 1989. It is the first time the Simpson family is seen on half-hour (30 minutes) television. \nIn the episode, Bart Simpson gets a tattoo without permission from his mother Marge. Marge uses all of the money for Christmas to get the tattoo off. Homer's boss will not give him a bonus for Christmas. Homer gets a job to be Santa Claus at a shopping mall, but he does not get enough money. He loses more money when he loses a bet at dog racing. Santa's Little Helper, the dog they betted on, did bad at the race and is abandoned by his owner. Homer and Bart keep him as a pet for the family.\nMimi Pond wrote the dialogue of the episode. David Silverman is the director of the episode. \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\" was nominated for two Emmy Awards in 1990. Critics of television gave good reviews for the episode. About 13.4 million people watched the episode when it was first shown on television. \"The Simpsons\" was first going to start with the episode \"Some Enchanted Evening\". The animation of that episode was not good enough at that time to be the first episode. \nStory.\nThe Simpson family go to the Christmas pageant at Springfield Elementary School. After that, Bart and Lisa write letters to Santa Claus. Lisa wants a pony and Bart wants a tattoo. Marge does not want Bart to get a tattoo. On the day after that, the family goes shopping at a mall. Bart gets a tattoo that says the word \"Mother\". He thinks that Marge will like it. Marge sees the tattoo and takes Bart to a dermatologist to get it removed. She has to use all of the money that would have been used for Christmas. She thinks that his husband Homer will get a bonus for Christmas.\nHomer works at a power plant. His boss Mr. Burns says that there will be no bonuses for Christmas. Homer wants to get more money, so he gets a side job as being Santa Claus at the mall. Bart goes to the mall on Christmas Eve. He takes Santa's beard off and sees that he is Homer. Bart apologizes and is happy that Homer is trying to get more money for the family. Homer does not get a lot of money because of tax deductions. His friend Barney Gumble tells him to go to a greyhound racing track.\nHomer bets all of his money on a dog named Santa's Little Helper. The dog does very bad at the race. His owner is angry and abandons him. Bart and Homer see Santa's Little Helper and keeps him as a pet. When they get home, Homer tries to tell the family that he did not get a bonus. The family is very happy to see Santa's Little Helper. \nProduction.\nStart of \"The Simpsons\".\n\"The Simpsons\" was made by Matt Groening. He got the idea for the show in the lobby of James L. Brooks's office. Brooks was the producer of \"The Tracey Ullman Show\". Brooks wanted to make short films with Groening during comedy sketches in the show. Groening wanted to make his comic strip \"Life in Hell\" as short films. If he did this, he would have to give up his publication rights for \"Life in Hell\". He did not want to, so he made the Simpson family.\nThe family was first seen in the shorts on \"The Tracey Ullman Show\". The first short they were in was on April 19, 1987. Groening gave the animators simple sketches. He thought that the animators would make them look better. The animators only made the sketches have color. This made the family look very rough in the shorts. In 1989, a few production companies wanted to make \"The Simpsons\" its own 30 minute television show. The episodes would be shown on the Fox Broadcasting Company. Brooks put a statement in a contract that said Fox can not make changes to the episodes. Groening said that he wanted to give the audience something that was not \"mainstream trash\" (bad things that many people know). The show started on December 17, 1989 with \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\".\nHow the episode was made.\nThe Fox Broadcasting Company was worried about \"The Simpsons\". They thought that their audience would get bored of the show. They said to the producers that one episode should have three stories that were 7 minutes, and that four episodes would be longer. They thought that this should happen until the audience liked the show. The producers got Fox to let them make 13 regular episodes. The show was going to start in Autumn of 1989 with the episode \"Some Enchanted Evening\". That episode had problems with its animation, so it could not be shown on television at the time. \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\" did not have the opening sequence. It was first put on the second episode (\"Bart the Genius\"). \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\" was the 8th episode made, but it was the first to be shown on television. This means that it has better animation than some of the episodes shown after this one.\nPart of the Christmas pageant is similar to an event Groening had in second grade. He had to talk about Christmas in Russia. He also talks about it in his comic strip \"Life in Hell\". In the comic, a boy's grandmother is in Russia. He learns that his grandmother can not celebrate Christmas because it is illegal in Russia. Groening said that people thought the episode made another form of the song \"Jingle Bells\". While Lisa is on the Christmas pageant, she is seen to be not wearing anything lower than the waist. David Silverman said that she is wearing clothing, but the animators made it the same color as Lisa (yellow).\nThis episode is the only one that was written by Mimi Pond. Al Jean made the name of the episode. It is an allusion to the song \"The Christmas Song\" (also named \"Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire\"). David Silverman is the director of the episode. Rich Moore made the storyboard and the design of Ned Flanders. Eric Stefani animated some parts of the episode. Barney Gumble is seen with blonde hair in the episode. His hair color was changed to brown because Groening wanted the Simpson family to only have yellow hair. These characters are first seen in the episode: Principal Skinner, Milhouse Van Houten, Sherri and Terri, Moe Szyslak, Mr. Burns, Barney Gumble, Patty and Selma, Ned Flanders, Todd Flanders, Santa's Little Helper, Snowball II, Dewey Largo, and Lewis. Waylon Smithers talks in a speaker, but he is not seen in the episode."}

Thereafter, only Divas on the Raw brand were able to compete for the WWE Women's Championship, while the Divas on the SmackDown brand were unable to compete for a women's-exclusive championship. The ruling was, however, ignored on rare occasions as Melina and Ashley have been the only divas who were on the SmackDown brand to challenge for the title. This led to the creation of the WWE Divas Championship, which was announced on June 6, 2008 during an episode of \"SmackDown\" by SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero. In order to determine the competitors for the new title, two 'Golden Dreams matches', the object of which was to retrieve a star that was hanging on a pole above one corner of the ring, were held. The first Golden Dreams match was won by Natalya, and the second by Michelle McCool. The championship belt was officially unveiled on the July 4, 2008 episode of \"SmackDown\" prior to the second Golden Dreams match. Natalya and McCool competed against each other at The Great American Bash, which McCool won and became the inaugural champion.\nAt WrestleMania 32 on April 3, 2016, Lita announced that a new WWE Women's Championship would be created.

It grows up to 1.5\u00a0metres (5 feet) tall, and is usually grown for its large, white, tapered root.\nThe unbroken horseradish root has very little smell. When cut or grated, however, enzymes from the now-broken plant cells causes changes. The enzymes break down sinigrin to produce allyl isothiocyanate (mustard oil). This irritates the mucous membranes of the sinuses and eyes. Once exposed to air (by grating) or heat, it needs to be mixed with vinegar. Otherwise it becomes unpleasantly bitter-tasting.\nHistory.\nHorseradish has been cultivated since ancient times. Supposedly, the Delphic Oracle told Apollo that the horseradish was worth its weight in gold. Horseradish was known in Egypt in 1500 BC. Both root and leaves were used as a medicine during the Middle Ages. The root was used as a condiment on meats in Germany, Scandinavia, and Britain. It was brought to North America during Colonial times.\nThe word \"horseradish\" is known in English from the 1590's. The root is similar in shape and size to a horse's genitalia. Despite the name, this plant is poisonous to horses.\nCultivation.\nHorseradish is a perennial plant in hardiness zones 2\u20139. It can be grown as an annual in other zones. After the first frost in the autumn kills the leaves, the root is dug out and divided. The main root is harvested for use in the kitchen. One or more large offshoots of the main root are replanted to produce next year's crop. Horseradish left undisturbed in the garden spreads via underground shoots. The plant can become invasive. Older roots left in the ground become woody. They are then no longer useful for cooking. Older plants can be dug out and divided to start new plants.\nPests and diseases.\nThe larvae of \"Pieris rapae\" are a common caterpillar pest in horseradish gardens. They are called cabbageworms. The adults are white butterflies with black spots on the forewings. They are seen flying around the plants during the day. The caterpillars are green with faint yellow stripes running lengthwise down the back and sides. Full grown caterpillars are about in length. They move slowly when poked. They overwinter in green pupal cases. Adults start appearing in gardens after the last frost and are a problem through the remainder of the growing season. There are three to five overlapping generations a year. Mature caterpillars chew large, ragged holes in the leaves leaving the large veins intact. Handpicking is effective for control.\nCulinary uses.\nCooks use the terms \"horseradish\" or \"prepared horseradish\" to refer to the grated root of the horseradish plant mixed with vinegar. Prepared horseradish is white to creamy-beige in colour. It will keep for months refrigerated but eventually will darken, indicating it is losing flavour and should be replaced. The leaves of the plant, while edible, are not commonly eaten, and are referred to as \"horseradish greens\".\nHorseradish sauce.\nHorseradish sauce made from grated horseradish root and vinegar is a popular condiment. In the United Kingdom it is usually served with roast beef, often as part of a traditional Sunday roast. It can also be used in a number of other dishes, including sandwiches or salads. A variation of horseradish sauce, which in some cases may substitute the vinegar with other products like lemon juice or citric acid, is known in Germany as \"Tafelmeerrettich\". Also popular in the UK is Tewkesbury mustard, a blend of mustard and grated horseradish originating in medieval times and mentioned by Shakespeare (Falstaff says: \"his wit's as thick as Tewkesbury Mustard\" in Henry IV Part II). A very similar mustard, called \"Krensenf\" or \"Meerrettichsenf\", is popular in Austria and parts of Eastern Germany.\nIn the United States, the term \"horseradish sauce\" refers to grated horseradish combined with mayonnaise or salad dressing. Prepared horseradish is a common ingredient in Bloody Mary cocktails and in cocktail sauce, and is used as a sauce or sandwich spread.\nThe distinctive pungent taste of horseradish is from the compound allyl isothiocyanate. Upon crushing the flesh of horseradish, the enzyme myrosinase is released and acts on the glucosinolates sinigrin and gluconasturtiin, which are precursors to the allyl isothiocyanate. The allyl isothiocyanate serves the plant as a natural defense against herbivores. Since allyl isothiocyanate is harmful to the plant itself, it is stored in the harmless form of the glucosinolate, separate from the myrosinase enzyme. When an animal chews the plant, the allyl isothiocyanate is released, repelling the animal. Allyl isothiocyanate is an unstable compound, degrading over the course of days at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. Because of this instability, horseradish sauces lack the pungency of the freshly crushed roots.\nVegetable.\nIn Central and Eastern Europe horseradish is called \"khreyn\" (in various spellings like \"kren\") in many Slavic languages, in Austria, in parts of Germany (where the other German name \"Meerrettich\" is not used), in North-East Italy, and in Yiddish (\u05db\u05e8\u05d9\u05d9\u05df translitered as \"khreyn\"). There are two varieties of khreyn. \"Red\" khreyn is mixed with red beet (beetroot) and \"white\" khreyn contains no beet. It is popular in Ukraine (under the name of , \"khrin\"), in Poland (under the name of ), in Lithuania (krienai) in the Czech Republic (), in Russia (, \"khren\"), in Hungary (), in Romania (), in Bulgaria (, \"khryan\"), in Slovenia (, \"hren\") and in Slovakia (under the name of ). Having this on the table is a part of Christian Easter and Jewish Passover tradition in Eastern and Central Europe. A variety with red beet is called or simply \u0107wik\u0142a in Poland. In Ashkenazi European Jewish cooking beet horseradish is commonly served with gefilte fish. Red beet with horseradish is also used as a salad served with lamb dishes at Easter called \"sfecla cu hrean\" in Transylvania and other Romanian regions. Horseradish (often grated and mixed with cream, hard-boiled eggs, or apples) is also a traditional Easter dish in Slovenia and in the adjacent Italian region of Friuli Venezia Giulia; it is used also in the other nearby Italian region of Veneto. In Croatia freshly grated horseradish(Croatian: Hren) is often eaten with boiled ham or beef. In Serbia \"ren\" is an essential condiment with cooked meat and freshly roasted suckling pig.\nHorseradish is also used as a main ingredient for soups. In the Polish region of Silesia, horseradish soup is a common Easter Day dish.\nRelation to wasabi.\nThe Japanese condiment wasabi, although traditionally prepared from the wasabi plant, is now usually made with horseradish because the wasabi plant is rare. The Japanese plant name for horseradish is , or \"Western wasabi\". Both plants are in the family Brassicaceae.\nNutritional and biomedical uses.\nHorseradish has compounds that have health benefits. Horseradish contains volatile oils, notably mustard oil. This oil has antibacterial properties. The fresh plant also contains average 79.31\u00a0mg of vitamin C per 100 g of raw horseradish. The enzyme horseradish peroxidase (HRP), found in the plant, is used extensively in molecular biology and biochemistry."}

Usually the Swiss army helps secure the area.\nThese meetings are often critizised because they are seen as a vehicle to further capitalism in the world by anti-capitalists and supporters of antiglobalization. There is an organisation called \"Public Eye On Davos\" that organizes public information during the meeting. During the meetings, which invole the G8, access to the village of Davos is heavily controlled. A small demonstration happens every year in Davos during these meetings.

The land is disputed between Serbia and the self-declared Republic of Kosovo, which currently has actual control over the land. Before the Republic of Kosovo, the area was controlled by Serbia (while Serbia was part of Yugoslavia) between 1912 and 1999.\nThe Constitution and laws of Serbia say that Kosovo in the southern part of Serbia and covers the areas of Kosovo and Metohija. The capital is Pristina. In the past, Kosovo was an autonomous province of Serbia when Serbia was part of Socialist Yugoslavia (1946\u20131990). When Socialist Yugoslavia ended in 1990, Kosovo became part of Serbia until the Kosovo War (1998\u201399). After the war, it became a United Nations (UN) controlled area due to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244 but legally it was still part of Serbia. In that time, the United Nations Interim Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) governed. In 2008, some Albanian politicians said that Kosovo would be its own country. 98 member countries of the United Nations agree, but Serbia does not. It still thinks that Kosovo is part of it.\nIn 1990, when Kosovo was part of Yugoslavia, Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107's Anti-bureaucratic Revolution happened. This meant that Kosovo's government became less powerful and that Serbia had more control, like in 1971\u201374. That year, Kosovo's Albanian majority and also the Republic of Albania agreed with the declaration of independence of the Republic of Kosova. Because of the Kosovo War in 1999, the Serbian army was kicked out of Kosovo.\nIn February 2008, the Republic of Kosovo declared independence. Serbia does not agree, but in the Brussels agreement of 2013, it got rid of the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija government.. Kosovo's independence is currently recognized by 95 UN member states. In 2013, the Serbian government said it was getting rid of the Serb minority councils it had made in northern Kosovo, in order to allow the Kosovo Serb minority to become more like the general population of Kosovo."}

The French Grand Prix was open to international competition. It is the oldest Grand Prix race. It was first run on 26 June 1906, under the Automobile Club de France in Sarthe. The first race had a starting field of 32 automobiles.\nHistory.\nThe first World Championships were organized in 1925. It included the French Grand Prix, the Italian Grand Prix, the Belgian Grand Prix and the Indianapolis 500. The French Grand Prix was part of the Formula One championships from their start in 1950. The last F1 Grand Prix was held in 2008. It was called the European Grand Prix four times between 1924 and 1966. During this time, the title was an honorary name. It was given to one grand prix race held in Europe each year\nThe race has been held at several racetracks in France, such as the Autodrome de Montlh\u00e9ry. Since 1991 its permanent home was the Circuit de Nevers Magny-Cours (often called just Magny-Cours). The move to Magny-Cours was an attempt to stimulate the economy of the area, but many within Formula One complained about the remote nature of the circuit.\nOn 29 March 2007 it was announced by the FFSA, the race promoter, that the 2008 French Grand Prix was put on an indefinite \"pause\". This suspension was due to the financial problems of the circuit. Many in F1 did not like the circuit because of the remote location. On 31 May, Bernie Ecclestone confirmed that the 2007 French Grand Prix would be the last to be held at Magny-Cours.\nAfter negotiations, the future of the race improved. Ecclestone himself stating \"We're going to maybe resurrect it for a year, or something like that\". On 24 July, Ecclestone and the Prime Minister of France met. They agreed to try to keep the race at Magny-Cours for 2008 and 2009. On 27 July, when the FIA published the calendar with a French Grand Prix scheduled at Magny-Cours. The 2009 race, however, was again cancelled on 15 October 2008, with the official website citing \"economic reasons\". \nThe future.\nA major remodeling project of Magny-Cours (\"2.0\") was planned, but canceled in the end. FFSA, the race's promoter, started looking for an another host circuit. There were five different proposals for a new circuit. One in Rouen with 3 possible layouts: a street circuit, in the dock area, or a permanent circuit near the airport. A street circuit located near Disneyland Resort Paris. A location in Versailles. And one in Sarcelles (\"Val de France\"). They were all were canceled. A final location in Flins-Les Mureaux, near the Flins Renault Factory was considered, that was canceled as well on 1 December 2009. In 2010 and 2011, there was no French Grand Prix on the Formula 1 calendar, although the Paul Ricard Circuit has proposed itself for 2012.

It started in the late 1950s and had its climax in the middle of the 1960s. \nHistory.\nBlues came to Britain from the 1930s onwards. Seamen brought records to British ports. During the Second World War and in the Cold War GIs brought them to Britain. During the 1950s Blues was popular with the British Jazz fans ( Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith and the blues influenced Boogie-woogie of Jelly Roll Morton and Fats Waller). Also British labels like HMV and EMI began to sell jazz and blues records. Many people heard Blues for the first time when during the skiffle hightime when acts like Lonnie Donegan covered the songs of Leadbelly. When skiffle faded some of the musicians began to play pure blues music. Two of them were the guitarist and blues harpist Cyril Davies and the guitarist Alexis Korner. They ran a skiffle club in London but they closed the venue and reopened it as \"The London Blues and Barrelhouse Club\". The skiffle club was a center of early blues concerts in Britain. Cyril Davis brought different acts to Britain like Big Bill Broonzy. He played a folk blues set and blues was seen in Britain mainly as form of folk music. This opinion had chanced when Muddy Waters came to Britain and played electric Chicago blues.\nInfluenced by Waters Davis and Korner formed an electric band named Blues Incorporated. The band was important for the development of blues and rhythm \u00b4n blues in Britain. Alexis Korner is often referred to as \"father of the British blues\". Many important musicians of the 1960s played in the band. These included future Rolling Stones, Keith Richards, Mick Jagger, Charlie Watts and Brian Jones and the Cream founders Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker. Also Graham Bond and Long John Baldry were members. Blues Incorporated played at the Marquee club. There they recorded the first British blues album R&amp;B from the Marquee for Decca. The band splited up before the release. Another important band leader was John Mayall, whose band The Bluesbreakers hosted many important musicians of British blues ( Jack Bruce, Aynsley Dunbar and Mick Taylor).\nThe most important band which was founded in the early 1960s were The Rolling Stones. Other bands from London were The Yardbirds, The Kinks, Manfred Mann and The Pretty Things. They played rhythm \u00b4n blues influenced music. The British blues boom overlaped with this bands. The most important band were John Mayall\u00b4s Blues Breakers and Fleetwood Mac. In the late 1960s Cream, Fleetwood Mac, Ten Years After and Free played the first blues rock in Britain. But Blues still had a bias in Britain. American bluesmen like John Lee Hooker, Eddie Taylor, and Freddie King are well received in the United Kingdom . The home scene was led by Dave Kelly and his sister Jo Ann. They kept the acoustic blues alive. Dave Kelly also was member of The Blues Band, which included also former Manfred Mann members Paul Jones and Tom McGuinness, Hughie Flint and Gary Fletcher. In the 1990s great blues festivals were founded in Britain like The Swanage Blues Festival, The Burnley National Blues Festival, The Gloucester Blues and Heritage Festival and The Great British Rhythm and Blues Festival at Colne.\nOne of the most important things of British blues was the reexport of blues to the USA. The success of bands like the Rolling Stones woke the interest of many white young people in the USA in blues music."}

Baleen whales strain plankton out of the water, whereas the Odontoceti (toothed whales) eat larger prey.\nThe suborder contains four families and fourteen species.\nBaleen.\nBaleen whales do not have teeth, except as embryos. Fossil adult baleen whales did have teeth, but modern adults have only baleen. The embryo teeth are replaced by baleen, which look like a curtain of long plates hanging down from the top of the whale's mouth. Those plates might be 12 feet long, and a foot or more wide. Looking at them from the outside, they look like straight knives hanging down, but from the inside, they are like a big toothbrush or comb. Baleen is made of keratin, a tissue also found in mammalian hair and nails.\nFeeding.\nA baleen whale uses its baleen to eat. In order to feed, a baleen whale opens its mouth widely and scoops in dense shoals of plankton and other small prey (such as krill, copepods, small fish and sometimes birds that happen to be near the shoals), together with a large volume of water.\nThe whale then partly shuts its mouth and presses its tongue against its upper jaw, forcing the water to pass out sideways through the baleen, thus sieving out the prey which it then swallows.\nBehavior.\nMany baleen whales make sounds. These sounds can be simple or complicated. Scientists think whales sing to communicate over long distances.\nSize.\nBaleen whales are generally larger than toothed whales, and females are larger than males. The group includes the largest living animal species, the blue whale.\nBreaching.\nAlthough they are very heavy, baleen whales are able to jump completely out of the water. Humpback whales are known for their jumping skills, but other baleen whales also jump out from the water with their body or beat it loudly with their fins. Nobody knows for sure why the whales do this. It may be a type of communication.\nEvolution.\nThe oldest true fossils of baleen are only 15 million years old, but baleen rarely fossilizes, and scientists believe it originated considerably earlier than that. Genetic evidence from DNA sequence analysis supports this idea.\nBaleen-related skull modifications have been found in fossils from considerably earlier. Baleen is believed to have evolved around thirty million years ago, possibly from a hard, gummy upper jaw, like the one a has. In fact, it resembles baleen closely at the microscopic level. Many early baleen whales also had teeth, but these were probably used only peripherally, or perhaps not at all (again like Dall's porpoise, which catches squid and fish by gripping them against its hard upper jaw).\nImportance to humans.\nFrom the 11th to the late 20th centuries, baleen whales were hunted for their oil and baleen. Their oil can be made into margarine and cooking oils. Baleen was used to stiffen corsets, as parasol ribs, and to crease paper."}

It contains the well-known hedgehogs of Eurasia and Africa and the moonrats of South-east Asia. This family was once in the order Insectivora, but that order is not used anymore.\nCharacteristics.\nErinaceids are generally shrew-like in form, with long snouts and short tails, but they are much larger than shrews. All but one species have five toes in each foot (in some cases with strong claws for digging) and they have large eyes and ears. Hedgehogs have hair modified into sharp spines to form a protective covering over the upper body and flanks, while gymnures have only normal hair. Most species have anal scent glands, but these are far better developed in gymnures, which can have a powerful odor.\nErinaceids are omnivorous, with the major part of their diet consisting of insects, earthworms, and other small invertebrates. They also eat seeds and fruit, and occasionally bird's eggs, along with any carrion they come across. Their teeth are sharp and suited for impaling invertebrate prey. The dental formula for erinaceids is: upper=2-3.1.4.3; lower=3.1.2-4.3.\nHedgehogs are nocturnal, but gymnures are less so. Many species live in simple burrows, while others build temporary nests on the surface from leaves and grass, or shelter in hollow logs or similar hiding places. Erinaceids are solitary animals outside the breeding season, and the father plays no role in raising the young.\nFemale erinaceids give birth after a gestation period of around six to seven weeks. The young are born blind and hairless, although hedgehogs begin to sprout their spines within 36 hours of birth.\nClassification.\nThere are 10 genera and 24 species of erinaceid."}

The player controls the main character Samus while exploring the game's cave-like environment. Because Samus starts only with a weak attack and a short jump, players must find power-ups to make the attack and jump stronger, in order to get to new areas of the game.

The monument is made of marble, granite, and sandstone. The monument was started in 1848 but was not finished until 1884. This was because the American Civil War started soon after construction started. Construction continued after the war ended, but the type of sandstone was changed.

It has many museums, like the Smithsonian and the National Gallery of Art. It is found between the United States Capitol and the Washington Monument, which are about one mile apart. It is a popular place, and is used for exercise, recreation, music concerts, festivals, and protests. It is also visited by many tourists - over 25 million people come to the Mall each year.\nArea.\nOfficially, the Mall is the area between the U.S. Capitol and the Washington Monument. However, there is another park that is right next to the Mall, which is from the Washington Monument to the Lincoln Memorial. The Reflecting Pool is in this park, as well as many monuments and museums. Many people say that this park is also part of the National Mall.\nThe National Mall has many trees. Most of them are elm and cherry trees. The cherry blossom trees were given to the United States by Japan in 1912.\nHistory.\nPierre L'Enfant, the man who planned Washington D.C., wanted to have a park in the middle of the city. However, the National Mall was not always a park. In the 19th century, there was a railroad that ran through the Mall. Cows also grazed (ate grass) on the Mall. There was a large market on one side of the Mall. During the American Civil War, there were many buildings on the Mall. There were even slaughterhouses on the Mall - places where animals are killed and turned into meat. In 1901, the Senate passed the McMillan Plan. This cleaned up the National Mall and moved the railroad to Union Station.\nEvents.\nMany events happen at the National Mall. The National Park Service says that over 3,000 events happen each year, but most of these are tours. Some of the biggest events that happen each year are the Cherry Blossom Festival, the National Book Festival, an Earth Day festival, and parades on Veteran's Day and Independence Day.\nProtests and rallies also happen at the National Mall. One of the most famous was the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963, where Martin Luther King, Jr. gave his I Have a Dream speech. A rally in 1969 to end the Vietnam War was the biggest protest on the Mall. Over 2 million people came and marched to the White House. In 1995, the Million Man March was held on the Mall.\nNear the Mall.\nThere are many places very close to the Mall. The Library of Congress and the United States Supreme Court building are just east of the Capitol. The White House, the National Archives, the Old Post Office, and, Ford's Theater (where Abraham Lincoln was killed) are just north. The National Postal Museum, and Union Station are northeast. The Jefferson Memorial, the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, and the Bureau of Engraving and Printing are to the south."}

They are sometimes called \"white ants\", incorrectly, because ants belong to the Order Hymenoptera. \nThey are \"eusocial\" animals, as are ants and some bees and wasps. Termites mostly feed on detritus, mostly wood, leaf litter, soil, or animal dung. There are an estimated 4,000 species (about 2,600 taxonomically known). About 10% are pests which can cause serious structural damage to buildings, crops or plantation forests. \nTermites are major detrivores in the subtropical and tropical regions. Their recycling of wood and other plant matter is very important for ecology.\nA termite colony starts when winged termites (called \"alates\") swarm and mate. After mating, they fall to the ground and rip off their wings. The female looks for a good place to start the colony, and the male follows her. Most termites nest underground their entire lives, but termites in Africa and Australia actually build really big mound structures that look like little mountains and can be more than 20 feet tall (see photo below).\nTermites live in colonies that, at maturity, hold from several hundred to several million individuals. They are a prime example self-organised systems which use swarm intelligence. They use this cooperation to exploit food sources and environments which would not be available to any single insect acting alone. A typical colony contains nymphs (semi-mature young), workers, soldiers, and reproductive individuals of both genders, sometimes containing several egg-laying queens."}

They are usually known as praying mantids because of their prayer-like stance.\nThe group contains about 2,300 species. They occur in temperate and tropical habitats. Most are in are in the family Mantidae, and are called Mantids.\nIn Europe, the name \"praying mantis\" refers to only a single species, \"Mantis religiosa\". They are sometimes confused with phasmids (stick insects).\nThe closest relatives of mantids are the order Blattodea (cockroaches and termites), and these two groups together are ranked as the Superorder Dictyoptera.\nLife habit.\nMantids are notable for their hunting abilities. They are predators, and their diet usually consists of living insects, including flies and aphids. Larger species have been known to prey on small lizards, frogs, birds, snakes, and even rodents.\nMost mantids are ambush predators, waiting for prey to stray too near. The mantis then lashes out at remarkable speed. Some ground and bark species, however, pursue their prey rather quickly.\nPrey are caught and held securely with grasping, spiked forelegs ('raptorial' legs); the first thoracic segment, the prothorax, is commonly elongated and flexibly articulated, allowing for greater range of movement of the front limbs while the remainder of the body remains more or less still.\nThe movement of the head is also remarkably flexible. It gives nearly 300 degrees of movement in some species. This allows for a great range of vision (their compound eyes have a large binocular field of vision) without having to move the rest of the body. As their hunting relies heavily on vision, they are mainly diurnal, but many species fly at night, when there is less chance of being taken by birds.\nMantids are masters of camouflage and most species make use of protective colouration to blend in with the foliage or substrate. This helps to avoid predators themselves, and to better snare their victims. They not only blend with the foliage, but mimic it, appearing as either living or withered leaves, sticks, tree bark, blades of grass, flowers, or even stones. Some species in Africa and Australia are able to turn black after a molt following a fire in the region to blend in with the fire ravaged landscape (fire melanism).\nMantids bite, but have no venom, and are not dangerous to humans. They are not chemically protected; nearly any large predatory animal will eat a mantis if it is able to detect it. Mantids are generally quite aggressive towards one another, in fact, and most species are readily cannibalistic when given the opportunity."}

Most of them are 10-14mm long, some species can reach 80mm. Most earwigs are omnivores they also eat some insect larvae.\nPhysical Characteristics.\nAll earwigs are insects. All earwigs have three body parts, head, thorax, and abdomen. Earwigs are about the same size as a peanut.\nEarwigs are dark brown, red, or black. Earwigs use their antennae for smelling and feeling. Their antennae are attached to their head. All earwigs are a little flat. Earwigs have thin back wings and two thick wings to cover the thin wings.. They don\u2019t fly often. Some earwigs have stripes on the thorax and abdomen.\nAll earwigs have six hooked legs.\nMale earwigs have curved cerci(which are little pinchers to grab food) and females have straight cerci on their abdomen. Some times male earwigs use their cerci (little pinchers to grab food) to fight other males.\nHabitat.\nEarwigs live all over the world, except Antarctica. \nEarwigs usually live in damp, shady places such as under leaves or in fallen trees. Earwigs can also be found in your home, mostly in basements or bathrooms, where there are damp and shady places.\nDiet.\nAll earwigs eat plants. Earwigs eat pollen out from flowers. Some times fruit in the fall like apples. Some times when they live in houses they eat some of our pests like spiders and flies. Only some times they can get honey to eat. On trees you might find them eating moss or fungi.\nTo eat insects an earwig has two choices, bad smell or its cerci (little pinchers).\nbirds will usually avoid eating earwings due to their bad taste and smell."}

The main focus of the memorial is Daniel Chester French's sculpture of Lincoln, seated on a throne. It is surrounded by thirty six columns which are high. There is a large reflecting pool right outside the steps.\nInside.\nA sculpture of Lincoln sitting on a chair is inside the Memorial. The statue shows the President looking towards the reflecting pool and the Washington Monument. The statue is 19 feet 9\u00a0inches (6 m) tall and wide, and was carved from 28 blocks of white marble.\nThese words are written on the wall behind the sculpture: \nThis is a complicated sentence and was written long ago. It means that Abraham Lincoln will forever be remembered here, just like he will be remembered by the people of the United States, who he saved.\nLincoln's famous speech, the Gettysburg Address, is written into one of the walls at the Memorial. There are also several murals on the other walls. One of the murals shows an angel, and another one shows a slave being freed.\nFamous events.\nDue to Lincoln being associated with freeing the slaves, the Memorial has been a center for civil rights protests in the United States. In 1939, Marian Anderson sang there because she could not sing at Constitution Hall. The Memorial has been used many times for famous events. Martin Luther King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech was given on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. President Richard Nixon once met with protesters of the Vietnam War, who were at the Memorial.

They are among those insects which changed least during evolution. They first appear in the Devonian period along with the arachnids (Spiders). The name Archaeognatha is derived from Greek \"Archaeos\" meaning \"ancient\" and \"gnatha\" meaning \"jaw\". This refers to the articulation of the mandibles, which has a single condyle, where all higher insects have two. An alternate name, \"Microcoryphia\" comes from the Greek \"micro\" meaning \"small\" and \"coryphia\" meaning head.\nThe Order Archaeognatha has previously been combined with the Order Thysanura, or bristletails. Both groups have three-pronged tails with two cerci and an epiproct. Archaeognatha differ from Thysanura in that they are able to use their tail to spring up to 30\u00a0cm into the air. Like Thysanura, the body is covered with scales, with a thin exoskeleton that is susceptible to dehydration.\nThere are approximately 350 species in the two families. They are distributed worldwide, and unusual in the insect world in that they can even be found in the Arctic where they live in leaf litter and rock crevices. They feed primarily on algae, but also lichens, mosses, or decaying organic materials.\nThere are no species at current conservation risk, though the order is one of the most poorly-studied among insects, and therefore it may simply be that no one has yet recognized that any species are at risk."}

The term \"eusocial\" was introduced in 1966 by Suzanne Batra. E.O. Wilson gave it a more precise meaning.\nMeaning of the term.\nAt the start, it was used for invertebrates only, usually social insects. These are its main features:\nPresociality is a term for simpler (basal) kinds of sociality.\nDefinition debates.\nAfter Wilson's original definition, others discussed it, and some wanted to change its details.\nExamples.\nThe most familiar examples of eusociality are insects such as ants, bees, wasps, and termites. All of these are colonial animals which have queens for reproduction. The animals that are workers or soldiers are usually sterile - they cannot have offspring.\nThere were only two known mammal species which are eusocial. These are the naked mole rat and the Damaraland mole rat.\nEusociality with sterile individuals is the most extreme form of kin altruism. They do specialized tasks, often caring for the reproductive members. It includes individuals whose behaviour, body shape and function is modified for group defence, including self-sacrifice (altruism).\nEusociality played a key role in the development of theories in sociobiology.\nNaked mole rat.\nNaked mole rats are eusocial mammals. Colonies averaging 75-80 individuals live together in complex systems of burrows in arid African deserts. The tunnel systems built by naked mole rats can stretch up to two or three miles in cumulative length.\nOther examples.\nRecently, some species of gall-making aphids (Order Hemiptera) and thrips (Order Thysanoptera) are eusocial, with many separate origins of the state (convergent evolution). These species have extremely high relatedness between individuals. This is due to their mode of reproduction: sterile soldier castes are of the same clone as the reproducing female. The gall-inhabiting behavior gives these species a resource which sets them apart from related species with similar genetics. In these groups, therefore, high relatedness alone does not lead to the evolution of social behavior, but requires that groups occur in a restricted, shared area.\nSimilarly, eusociality occurs in some crustaceans and other arthropods. On some tropical reefs, several species of minute \"Synalpheus\" pistol shrimp are eusocial. They depend on certain sponges for the survival of their colony, and have a single breeding female and a number of male defenders armed with large snapping claws. Again, there is a single shared domicile for the colony members, and the non-breeding members act to defend it.\nTheories of social evolution.\nIn colonies of eusocial animals, some animals are sterile. They can not pass on their genes at all. How can these animals evolve and persist? Since they do not breed, their fitness should be zero and any genes causing this condition should be eliminated from the population immediately. In \"On the Origin of Species\", Darwin called this eusocial behavior the \"one special difficulty, which at first appeared to me insuperable, and actually fatal to my theory\". Darwin thought that the resolution to the paradox would lie in the close family relationship.\nDarwin could not say more because he did no know what the mechanism of heredity was. The first explanations were kin selection, and inclusive fitness. Both rely on the discovery of how genes are inherited. This discovery was made after Darwin had published \"On the Origin of Species\", and not understood until after 1900.\nEarly ideas on eusociality included suggestions that trophallaxis or food sharing was a basis for sociality. The most widely accepted model to explain eusociality is based on W.D. Hamilton's idea of inclusive fitness.\nInclusive fitness.\nHaplodiploidy determines the sex in \"all\" members of the insect order Hymenoptera (bees, ants, and wasps), and the Thysanoptera ('thrips').p408\nIn this system, sex is determined by the number of sets of chromosomes an individual receives. An offspring formed from the union of a sperm and an egg develops as a female, and an unfertilized egg develops as a male. This means that the males have half the number of chromosomes that a female has, and so are haploid.\nThe haplodiploid sex-determination system has a number of peculiarities. Most importantly, the relatedness between the sisterhood of worker bees in a hive or nest is 0.75. This means the workers are significantly more closely related than siblings in other sex determination systems. It is this point which drives the kin selection theory of how eusociality evolved.p465\nConsequences.\nIf the theory of inclusive fitness is accurate, the haplodiploidy makes kin selection easier. \"Sisters are more related to each other than to any offspring they might have\". Hamilton called them \"supersisters\". On average, two supersisters have 75 percent of the same genes. If they breed, they would share only half of their genome with their offspring. From the selfish gene's point-of-view, it is better to raise more sisters. Even though workers often do not reproduce, they are potentially passing on more of their genes by caring for sisters than they would by having their own offspring.\nThis unusual situation may explain why eusociality evolved several times in the haplodiploid group Hymenoptera \u2014 ants, bees and wasps. As of 2009, 11 separate cases are known. However, Hymenoptera is a large group and the majority of its species are not social. Furthermore, highly developed eusociality also exists in non-hymenopterans, perhaps most obviously in termites. Most such cases involve organisms that display high levels of inbreeding, so that colony members share more than half of their genes. Therefore the same model is considered to apply to these species.\nReeve and Holldobler put forward a theory of a superorganism. They look at competition and co-operation \"between\" groups as well as \"within\" groups. In their model, an individual's inclusive fitness varies according to how much it invests in within-group competition (e.g. hoarding a private food cache) versus between-group competition (e.g. contributing to common foraging); and on its relatedness to the other group members.\nIn a colony with one breeder (queen) and many workers, the evolutionarily stable state is for each individual to invest entirely in helping the group. This leads to a perfect \"superorganism\". In other words, the eusociality is stable, a result that agrees with Hamilton's findings. Also, they show that the effect is reinforced if there are many groups competing for the same resources."}

As the son of double Formula One world champion Graham Hill, he is the only son of a world champion to win the title, until Nico Rosberg, son of 1982 World Champion Keke Rosberg, clinched the title in 2016 . Despite the famous family name, Hill had an uphill struggle to reach the ranks of F1.\nDamon Hill came to professional motorsports relatively late: he began racing motorcycles in 1983 at the age of 23. The following year, he won the 350\u00a0cc Clubman's cup at Brands Hatch. In 1985, he moved on to four-wheel single-seater racing with Team Van Diemen in the Formula Ford championship, before moving up into the UK Formula 3 championship in 1986. After three seasons in Formula 3, where he won four races, Hill ascended another tier of open-wheel racing by joining Mooncraft in the International Formula 3000 championship, where, although often competitive, he never won a race. \nHill started his Formula One career in 1992 with the then uncompetitive Brabham team. His debut race was at the British Grand Prix where he qualified on the back row. He took the first of his 22 victories at the 1993 Hungarian Grand Prix for the Williams team the following year. In 1994, he won the British Grand Prix, a race his father had never won in his long and successful career. During the mid 1990s, Hill was Michael Schumacher's main rival for the Formula One Driver's Championship, finishing runner-up in the German's 1994 and 1995 title seasons. The two had a series of controversial clashes on and off the track, including the collision at the 1994 Australian Grand Prix that gave Schumacher his first title by a single point. Hill took eight victories and the world championship in 1996. Despite this, Williams decided in mid-1996 not to renew Hill's contract for 1997. He went on to record the Jordan team's first ever win at the 1998 Belgian Grand Prix, and came within a few miles of being the only driver to win a Grand Prix for the Arrows team and their Yamaha engine supplier at the 1997 Hungarian Grand Prix. He retired from the sport at the end of the 1999 season, after 122 races. In 2006, Hill became president of the British Racing Drivers' Club, succeeding Jackie Stewart.\nHill's son Josh is a racing driver.\nFormula One results.\nRaces in bold indicate pole position"}

As of 2008, Jack Brabham's 1966 drivers' championship remains the only victory by a car bearing the driver's own name.\nBrabham was the world's largest manufacturer of customer open wheel racing cars in the 1960s, and had built more than 500 cars by 1970. During this period, teams using Brabham cars won championships in Formula Two and Formula Three and competed in the Indianapolis 500. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brabham introduced innovations such as the controversial but successful 'fan car', in-race refuelling, carbon brakes, and hydropneumatic suspension. The team won two more Formula One drivers' championships in the 1980s with Brazilian Nelson Piquet, and became the first to win a drivers' championship with a turbocharged car.\nBritish businessman Bernie Ecclestone owned Brabham during most of the 1970s and 1980s, and later become responsible for administering the commercial aspects of Formula One. Ecclestone sold the team in 1988. Its last owner was the Middlebridge Group, a Japanese engineering firm. Midway through the 1992 season, the team collapsed financially as Middlebridge was unable to make repayments against loans provided by Landhurst Leasing.

It is known from only two specimens, which were taken near the locality of Bismarckburg, near Yege, Togo in 1890.\nDescription and natural history.\nThe entirety of known material for this species consists of a single poor quality dry skin, a fluid preserved animal, and a cranium and mandible. The cranium and mandible are from different animals. The material is deposited in the Zoologisches Museum of Humboldt University in Berlin, Germany.\nThe head and body length is 118 mm with a tail of 37 mm. This tail is unusually short relative to the body length (ratio of 37%) and is considered an important diagnostic feature. The animal is dark to grey brown above and pale grey brown below. Ears are small and hairy. Feet are also somewhat hairy. The tail may be naked or slightly haired. \nIncisors are shallowly grooved. The snout is long and wide, interorbital width broad, and zygomatic plate large (Musser and Carleton, 2005). \nBased upon skull morphology, the Togo Mouse is presumed to be insectivorous (Dieterlen, 1976). Very little is known about the habits of this unusual mouse.\nClassification.\n\"Leimacomys\" has been transferred back and forth between the Dendromurinae and the Murinae since its discovery. It most closely resembles \"Lophuromys\" which has been transferred to a newly erected Deomyinae on the basis of molecular data. The association with \"Lophuromys\" is thought to be due to convergent evolution due to a similar diet (Dieterlen, 1976). Tooth characters resemble dendromurines, \"Mystromys\" or basal gerbils. Denys et al. (1995) generated a phylogeny that suggested with limited support that \"Leimacomys\" is a sister taxon to the Gerbillinae.\nMusser and Carleton (2005) chose to erect a new subfamily, Leimacomyinae, to house this species. They placed it in the family Muridae due to its potential connection to either the Gerbillinae or Deomyinae, but emphasized that a broad phylogenetic study including \"Leimacomys\", and a host of nesomyids and murids is needed to determine its appropriate position.\nConservation status.\nThe Togo Mouse is considered to be either critically endangered or extinct depending on the authority. Schlitter (1989) classified it as extinct, because subsequent surveys to the area failed to recover it. Grubb et al. (1998) noted that these surveys inadequately sampled appropriate habitat in Togo and neighboring Ghana, and they were reluctant to declare the species extinct. Musser and Carleton (2005) emphasized that insectivorous muroids as a group have proven difficult to capture, and that intense surveys of high elevation forest in this region are required to determine if it still persists.\nThe IUCN currently describes the Togo Mouse as \"data deficient\"."}

With almost 600 species, it is the second largest family of mammals, and has animals in it in the New World, Asia, and Europe.\nCharacteristics.\nThe cricetids are small mammals, ranging from just 5 to 8\u00a0cm and 7\u00a0grams in weight in the New World Pygmy Mouse, up to 41 to 62\u00a0cm and 1,100\u00a0grams in the Muskrat. How long the tail is depends on how big the body is, and the tails can be either with hair or a little hair. Most species have brown fur, with a white colored underbelly, but there are also many other patterns, especially in the cricetine and arvicoline subfamilies.\nLike the Old World Mice, cricetids live in a wide range of habitats, in the high Arctic to tropical rainforests and hot deserts. Some are good at climbing, with long balancing tails and other way to help them to climb, while others can swim, with webbed feet and small external ears. Yet others are burrowing animals, or ground-dwellers, which live in the ground.\nTheir diet is also variable, with herbivorous, omnivorous, and insectivorous species known. They all have large, biting and chewing, incisors separated from grinding molar teeth by a gap, or diastema. \nThere can be a lot of these animals in a very short time, because the mother gives birth to them after 15 to 50 days, and they have a lot of babies at one time. The young are usually born blind, hairless, and helpless.\nTaxonomy.\nThe cricetids are thus classified to contain one prehistoric and 5 living subfamilies, around 112 living genera and approximately 580 living species:"}

Instead of asking about what we \"really\" are, it focuses on \"phenomena\". These are experiences that we get from the senses - what we see, taste, smell, touch, hear, and feel. Phenomenology does not ask if what we are seeing is \"actually\" there: for example it is not where we see an object (whether in real life, a dream or a hallucination) that is important, but it is the significance of the object that is important to the phenomenologist. It also does not ask if we are missing something, or if we have all the facts. Instead, phenomenologists (those who do phenomenology) believe we should look at the world just as it appears to us. \nMartin Heidegger, a famous phenomenologist, said that philosophers should be looking at how we live in our \"average everydayness.\" In his book Being and Time, he uses many examples of how people live in their normal lives. Jean-Paul Sartre did the same in his book Being and Nothingness. For example, he writes about meeting a friend at a cafe. However, the friend, named Pierre, never shows up. Sartre writes that he can feel the absence of Pierre in the cafe. Because of this, he says that non-Pierre (or the lack of Pierre) is something that exists, at least for him.

It is based in the Symphony Hall, Birmingham, England. It became particularly famous during the years when it was conducted by Sir Simon Rattle.\nThe orchestra was founded in 1920 by Neville Chamberlain, the man who later became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. At that time it was called City of Birmingham Orchestra. Appleby Matthews conducted its first concert. In November of the same year the composer Edward Elgar conducted the orchestra in a programme of his own music in Birmingham Town Hall. Adrian Boult was chief conductor from 1924 to 1930.\nHistory.\nThe CBO became a full-time organisation in 1944. It changed its name to the \"City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra\" (CBSO) in 1948. Chief conductors since then included Rudolf Schwarz and the composer Andrzej Panufnik.\nThe CBSO became internationally famous when Simon Rattle became chief conductor in 1980. The orchestra became known for their playing of late romantic and 20th century works, especially those of Sibelius and Gustav Mahler. During this period, the orchestra moved from Birmingham Town Hall to a new concert hall: the Symphony Hall, which was inside Birmingham's International Convention Centre.\nRattle was named music director of the CBSO in 1990. That same year, a new job was created for a composer who would be associated with the orchestra. It was called \"Radcliffe Composer in Association\", and the first person to have this post was Mark-Anthony Turnage. In 1995 Judith Weir became Fairbairn Composer in Association, followed in 2001 by Julian Anderson.\nAfter Rattle gave up his job with the CBSO in 1998 and the Finnish conductor Sakari Oramo became chief conductor that year, and music director in 1999.\nIn October 2007, the orchestra named the Latvian conductor Andris Nelsons as the CBSO's 12th music director, starting with the 2008-2009 season.\nThe CBSO has made many recordings for EMI Classics and Warner Classics, as well as smaller labels. The Orchestra's chief executive is Stephen Maddock."}

His father was Andrew Hamilton Hume, who came to Australia in 1790 in charge of convicts (prisoners) and later became a farmer.\nAt 17 he began exploring the Sydney area, and went as far as Berrima. On these journeys Hume learned how to live safely in the bush (the area far from the cities). In March 1817 he went on a journey with James Meehan, the deputy surveyor-general, and came to Lake Bathurst and the Goulburn Plains. Later he went with John Oxley and Meehan to Jervis Bay, and in 1822 was with a group which sailed in a boat down the east coast of New South Wales looking for rivers.\nJourney to Port Phillip.\nOn October 2, 1824 Hume and William Hovell left Sydney to try and get to Spencer's Gulf in South Australia. The explorers took six servants, five bullocks, three horses and two carts. Much of the journey was over rough mountain country with many rivers to get across. On November 16 they found a \"fine river\" which they called the Hume. This river was later renamed the Murray River. They made a boat to get across the river near the present site of Albury. After a journey of 11 weeks, on December 16, 1824 they reached Corio Bay, Victoria near the present site of Geelong. Hovell made an error in his navigation, and they believed that they were on the shore of Western Port Bay. The journey back was made on path more to the west, the land was more level, and they were back only 5 weeks later. They ran out of food before the end of the journey, and the whole group was very, very tired.\nHume and Hovell received grants of of land as a reward. Hume had to sell his land to pay for the cost of the journey. This journey discovered the overland path (now called the Hume Highway) between Sydney and Melbourne.\nDarling River Journey.\nIn November 1828, Hume journeyed with Charles Sturt into western New South Wales, where they explored the Darling River. Hume was able to talk with some aborigines who agreed to help them on the journey. There was a long drought (no rain) and it was very hard to find water. It was only Hume\u2019s good bushmanship (knowledge of the land) saved the group.\nLater life.\nAs a reward Governor Ralph Darling gave Hume of land at Yass Plains where he lived with his wife, Elizabeth Dight, and his nephew (son of his brother). In December 1853 a speech Hovell made at Geelong led to an argument between the men. This argument was over who had been the leader of the expedition, and had Hume thought Corio Bay was Westernport Bay. There were many letters and books written about the argument. Governor Ralph Darling had always said Hume was the leader, and Hume's own letters at the time show he agreed with Hovell's navigation mistake.\nHume later worked as a magistrate until his death at Yass on 19 April 1873. He is buried in the Yass Cemetery."}

The VOC had the power to start wars, make treaties, make its own money, and start new colonies.\nIt was an important company for almost 200 years until it became bankrupt in 1800. The VOC's colonies became the Dutch East Indies which later became Indonesia.\nFounding: 1602-1620.\nIn the 16th century, trade with Asia was mostly controlled by Portugal. The Dutch government wished to take a foothold in the spice market, as Portugal could not keep up with the demand and rising prices in Europe. With government funding, the VOC set up its first trading post in what is now Jakarta, which eventually became its main base of operations in the continent.\nExpansion: 1620-1669.\nIn 1620, the VOC created a trade agreement with their biggest rival in Asia, the English East India Company. This lasted until 1623, when the Amboyna Massacre forced the EEIC to move its trading posts from Indonesia to other areas in the continent.\nIn the 1620's, the VOC extended their reach to the remaining Indonesian Islands, and established plantations on the colonised islands to increase the volume of their exports. This expansion continued, until eventually the VOC was the richest company in the world. \nIn 1640, the VOC founded a trading post in Ceylon (Sri Lanka), the last place where the Portuguese had a foothold. The VOC now had a total monopoly over trade between Europe and Southern Asia.\nExploration of Australia.\nShips from the VOC were among the early explorers of Australia. The first Europeans to live in Australia were left behind after the mutiny on the VOC ship Batavia in 1629.

It is the fifth largest empire in history.\nIt was ruled by the Umayyad Dynasty (, \"Banu Umayyah\") who came from Mecca, in present-day Saudi Arabia. Damascus was the capital from 661\u2013744, Harrran from 744\u2013750, and in exile their capital was C\u00f3rdoba (756\u20131031).\nOrigins.\nAccording to tradition, the Umayyad family (also known as the Banu Abd-Shams) and the Islamic Prophet Muhammad both have a common ancestor, Abd Manaf ibn Qusai. Muhammad descended from Abd Munaf via his son Hashim, the Umayyads descended from Abd Munaf via a different son, Abd-Shams. The two families are therefore considered to be different clans (those of Hashim and of Umayya, respectively) of the same Arabian tribe (that of the Quraish).\nThe Umayyads and the Hashimites were bitter rivals. The rivalry came from the initial opposition of Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, the grandson of Umayya, to Muhammad and to Islam. He tried to get rid of the new religion by waging a series of battles. But eventually he accepted Islam, as did his son (the future caliph Muawiyah I), and the two provided much-needed political and diplomatic skills for the management of the quickly expanding Islamic empire.\nThe origins of Umayyad rule date back to the assassination of Uthman in 656. At this time Ali, a member of the Hashim clan and a cousin of Prophet Muhammad, became the caliph. He soon met with resistance from several factions, and moved his capital from Medina to Kufa. The resulting conflict, which lasted from 656 until 661, is known as the First Fitna (\"time of trial\").\nAli was first opposed by an alliance led by Aisha, the widow of Muhammad, and Talhah and Al-Zubayr, two of the Companions of the Prophet. The two sides clashed at the Battle of the Camel in 656, where Ali won a decisive victory.\nWhen Ali was assassinated in 661, Muawiyah marched to Kufa. There he persuaded a number of Ali's supporters to accept him as caliph instead of Ali's son, Hasan. Then he moved the capital of the caliphate to Damascus. Syria would remain the base of Umayyad power until the end of the dynasty."}

This was the first season since the 1969\u201370 season that teams would wear their dark jerseys at home. For the fourth time in eight years, the all-time record for total shutouts in a season was shattered, as 192 shutouts were recorded. The 2003\u201304 regular season was also the first one (excluding the lockout-shortened regular season of 1994\u201395) since 1967\u201368 in which there was neither a 50-goal scorer, nor a 100-point scorer.\nThis was the final season that ABC and ESPN televised NHL games.

All of the top teams had weaknesses. Tampa Bay and Boston were both young teams with no history of recent postseason success. Detroit, Ottawa, Colorado, and Philadelphia all had major questions in goal. New Jersey was marred by injuries to Scott Stevens and Brian Rafalski, while Vancouver was missing the suspended Todd Bertuzzi.\nThe first-round Eastern Conference matchups were notable for the number of heated rivalries. The Ottawa Senators met the Toronto Maple Leafs for the fourth time in five years in the always passion-filled Battle of Ontario. The Boston Bruins and Montreal Canadiens met in a resumption of the most common of all NHL playoff series, and one which the Canadiens have thoroughly dominated, including an upset win two years prior. The Philadelphia Flyers also played a hated division rival in the New Jersey Devils. The only non-rivalry was the Tampa Bay-New York Islanders series.\nThe West saw the resumption of the Vancouver-Calgary rivalry, which had been somewhat dormant as the Flames made the playoffs for the first time since 1996. In a less passionate but still interesting matchup, Detroit played division rival Nashville (whom they had struggled against during the regular season) in Nashville's first ever franchise visit to the playoffs. San Jose met the St. Louis Blues, while the always difficult four-five matchup saw Colorado and Dallas meet.\nThe Calgary Flames, a sixth seed, defeated three straight division champions, the Canucks, the Red Wings and the Sharks to become the first Canadian team to reach the Stanley Cup Finals in ten years, since the Canucks lost to the Rangers in the Finals in 1994. They faced the Tampa Bay Lightning, who defeated the Islanders in five, swept the Canadiens and defeated the Flyers in seven games.\nThe Flames and the Lightning battled hard in the Stanley Cup Finals, eventually pushing the series to seven games. By game 5, the Flames took the 3\u20132 series lead back to Calgary, and in game six, a puck appeared to have gone into the net, which would have made the game 3\u20132, but the goal light did not go on, the referee did not signal that a goal had been scored, and play went on, no goal counted. Extensive replays showed the play was inconclusive. The Lightning would win the game in double overtime, and go on to win the Stanley Cup with a 2\u20131 win in game seven, with two goals from Ruslan Fedotenko. Brad Richards, with a team-high 25 points in the playoffs, was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy.\nScoring leaders.\n\"Note: GP = Games Played, G = Goals, A = Assists, Pts = Points\nNHL awards.\nThe NHL Awards presentation took place in Toronto.\nFirst games.\nThe following is a list of players of note who played their first NHL game in 2003\u201304 (listed with their first team):\nLast games.\nThe following is a list of players of note that played their last game in the NHL in 2003\u201304 (listed with their last team):"}

The district is named after the main city - Mirpur. The District of Mirpur comprises mostly plain and some hilly areas. Its hot and dry climate and other geographical conditions closely resemble those of Jhelum and Gujrat, the adjoining Districts of Pakistan.\nAdministration.\nMirpur District is now located in the south west of the Kashmir region. Azad Jammu &amp; Kashmir is administered by Pakistan from Islamabad. Azad Kashmir has been considered politically, constitutionally and geographically as part of a separate state, i.e. Jammu and Kashmir. This state is a disputed territory and has been controlled by both Pakistan and India, since their independence, 14 / 15th August 1947, respectively. Azad Kashmir is under the indirect control of Pakistan, however its defence, foreign policy and currency are under the direct control of Pakistan.\nConsequently, fiscal issues, i.e. budget and tax affairs have been dealt with by the 'Azad Jammu &amp; Kashmir Council', instead of the Central Board of Revenue. Azad Jammu &amp; Kashmir Council is a supreme body, consisting of 11 members - 6 of these members are from the Government of Azad Jammu &amp; Kashmir, and 5 members are from the Government of Pakistan.\nAlso its chairman / chief executive is always the President of Pakistan. Hence, the rest of members are Azad Kashmir's own Prime Minister and President and some ministers, (also note that Azad Kashmir has its own president, prime minister and legislative assembly also supreme-court and high-court &amp; other departments). The Central Board of Revenue (CBR) is responsible for tax affairs of rest of all Pakistani territory, i.e. all four provinces and the capital, Islamabad.\nEmigration.\nPeople from this former Punjab region now known as Azad Kashmir are ethnic Pahari who have historically looked abroad for employment. Many a ship employed Mirpuri boiler men in the age of steam. During the two world wars many Mirpuris enlisted in the merchant navy and armed services. During the last four decades a large number of people from this district have gone abroad, especially to United Kingdom for earning their livelihood. The Mangla Dam project in the early sixties resulted in the displacement of a large number of people, who under an agreement between the Pakistan government and the British government, were allowed to settle in the UK, where they are usually known as Mirpuri and play a role in the British society, economy, and politics.\nAs such, they are today the major foreign exchange earning resource for Pakistan. Around 50,000 people were moved from this district in the mid-sixties to make way for the construction of Mangla Dam, but corrupt handling of funds meant long drawn out delays in completing the project. Most of these people settled in new Mirpur whilst some moved elsewhere in Pakistan or to the UK.\nTehsils of Mirpur.\nMirpur is divided into the following tehsils\nNotable places.\nNotable places within the district are\nCastes in Mirpur.\nMirpur became part of Kashmir in 1846 as part of the treaty of Amritsar between the British and the Maharaja Gulab Singh.Before the treaty Mirpur was part of the Punjab. Although they are citizens of Kashmir the peoples of Mirpur are ethnic Pahari's in much the same way as Attock has a large Pashtun population even though it only became part of the Punjab in 1970 when Ayub Khan removed it from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\nThe caste system in Mipur is very strong despite the most of people living in UK. The famous castes in Mirpur are:"}

It involved the WCW wrestlers \"invading\" WWF television to try to \"take over\" the WWF.\nThe idea of a match showing the top 2 shows of the Monday Night Wars was considered to be a \"dream match\" show in the eyes of many fans, because it let fans to see which show would be superior. The storyline began when Vince McMahon's son, Shane McMahon, said on \"RAW\" that he bought WCW. This led to many appearances of WCW wrestlers during \"RAW\" and \"SmackDown!\" after WrestleMania X-Seven.\nIn June 2001, the storyline got more intense as more WWF storylines ended to make room for the central Invasion storyline. WCW and Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) merged to make The Alliance and challenged the WWF's control over the wrestling industry. An Inaugural Brawl took place at the WWF Invasion pay-per-view, where Stone Cold Steve Austin defected and joined the Alliance. Many inter-promotional matches occurred after the Invasion between The Alliance and the WWF, leading up to the climax of the angle at Survivor Series 2001, when Team WWF (The Rock, Chris Jericho, Big Show, The Undertaker, and Kane) defeated Team Alliance (Stone Cold Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, Rob Van Dam, Booker T, and Shane McMahon) in a Winner-Take-All match.\nA very large storyline that went for 5 months from June 2001 to November 2001, the storyline has been heavily criticized.\nHistory.\nMonday Night Wars.\nDuring the Monday Night Wars, the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and World Championship Wrestling (WCW), the top 2 North American wrestling shows, competed for ratings. Through developments such as the nWo and the Montreal Screwjob, fans compared the two promotions, and the Internet wrestling community was full of arguments as to which of the two was the best.\nAmong other things, however, mismanagement within WCW (such as allowing wrestlers themselves to book matches) eventually led WCW to a downward spiral from which it never recovered. The Monday Night Wars came to an end on March 23 2001, when the WWF bought WCW for what was considered to be a bargain price.\nThe final night of the Monday Night Wars occurred on March 26 2001: \"RAW\" primarily focused on the major storylines heading into WrestleMania X-Seven, while \"Nitro\" held their final episode with a \"Night Of Champions\". Vince McMahon opened up \"Nitro\" and announced a simulcast later that night to address the future of WCW. Throughout \"RAW\", McMahon publicly named several WCW wrestlers who would not be retained. After Sting defeated Ric Flair in WCW's final match, the simulcast began. McMahon talked about the buyout of WCW and toyed with the idea of making WCW into a huge media conglomerate, much like the WWF. He asked the crowd who he should keep under his belt by mentioning names of WCW wrestlers and asking for a reaction. Lex Luger received a negative reaction from fans, and Hulk Hogan, Buff Bagwell, Booker T, Scott Steiner, Sting, and Goldberg received positive reactions. Vince then proceeded to fire them all, however, to the cheers of the \"RAW\" crowd and the jeers of the \"Nitro\" crowd. McMahon then announced that he would sign the contract and make the purchase official at WrestleMania. Shane McMahon, however, appeared on \"Nitro\" and announced that he had signed the contract and purchased WCW out from under his father's nose, planting the seed for what was considered a lucrative future storyline opportunity. The Invasion did not begin immediately afterwards, as the WWF was preparing for WrestleMania X-Seven, the year's largest show, mere days away.\nThe Invasion.\nThe WWF had effectively doubled the size of its roster through its purchase of WCW, and as a result, there was not enough screen time for everyone. The original plan was to find a time slot on TNN to continue running WCW as a separate entity. Polls were even put up on WWF.com and WCW.com to decide the name of the new show. These plans fell through when no TV station would touch WCW because of its reputation for losing money. The WWF eventually carried out a brand extension, effectively reviving WCW under its own auspices and running two separate promotions, each with one of the WWF's two existing televised shows, \"RAW\" and \"SmackDown!\".\nAs part of its plans, Lance Storm became the first WCW wrestler to appear on WWF programming, by running in during a match on the May 28 episode of \"RAW\" while a match was being held. At King of the Ring 2001 on June 24, then-WCW wrestler Booker T interfered during the Triple Threat Main Event match for the WWF Championship and almost cost Stone Cold Steve Austin the title. Also, Austin suffered fractured bones in his hand from the side slam he took from Booker into an announce table. The next night, a confrontation occurred between WCW owner Shane McMahon and WWF owner Vince McMahon. While Vince was in the ring, Booker T came from behind to deliver his trademark scissor kick to Vince. The WWF roster ran to the ring to the aid of Vince, but Booker T and Shane McMahon escaped through the crowd. This incident marked the official start of the Invasion storyline, to which \"RAW\" announcer Jim Ross announced, \"The battle lines have been drawn!\"\nThe WWF eventually began to recognize WCW and tested the idea of a brand extension by giving WCW the final twenty minutes of \"RAW\" with Scott Hudson and Arn Anderson doing announcing duties in place of Jim Ross and Paul Heyman. During a match between Buff Bagwell and Booker T for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, WWF wrestlers Kurt Angle and WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin interfered in revenge by beating Booker T up, with Bagwell joining Angle and Austin by attacking Booker T. A\nAddition of ECW.\nOn the July 9 episode on \"RAW\", Kane was scheduled to go into a handicapped match against Mike Awesome and Lance Storm. Chris Jericho came out and offered to be Kane's partner, thus turning it into a tag team match. Near the end of the match, Jericho applied the Walls of Jericho on Lance Storm. As the move was being applied, however, Rob Van Dam and Tommy Dreamer ran through the audience and into the ring and started to beat on Kane and Jericho. In response, WWF wrestlers consisting of The Dudley Boyz, Tazz, Justin Credible, Rhyno, and Raven ran to the ring. After a brief stand-off, the WWF group turned around and attacked Kane and Jericho. This prompted Paul Heyman to leave the announce table and enter the ring. After high-fiving the wrestlers, he announced that ECW has been brought into the Invasion. Heyman talked about how tired he was sitting beside Jim Ross and discussing WCW vs. WWF, stating that he felt that everyone had forgotten about ECW and announced, \"This Invasion just got taken to the extreme.\"\nLater during the night, Shane and Vince McMahon bumped into each other backstage. Shane told his father that ECW needed to be taken care of and pointed out that there were 10 ECW wrestlers under Heyman's belt. He suggested that he would take five of his WCW wrestlers and have them team up with five of Vince McMahon's WWF wrestler's later that night to take out ECW. Vince agreed but insisted that WCW would eventually meet its demise when all was said and done.\nAt the end of the night, the WCW wrestlers came into the ring, accompanied by Shane McMahon. The WWF wrestlers then came into the ring and, before ECW entered, the WCW and WWF wrestlers started to brawl. The WWF wrestlers cleared the ring but then were stormed by the ECW wrestlers and taken out. After this, WCW's men came into the ring and high-fived the ECW men. Paul Heyman and Shane McMahon then hugged and started to dismantle the WWF wrestlers. Vince McMahon, stunned, came out and asked what was going on. Shane McMahon responded that he was responsible for all the events that just transpired and announced that ECW and WCW merged to form The Alliance. He then announced that the new owner of ECW was Stephanie McMahon.\nWWF InVasion.\nAt InVasion, the Inaugural Brawl took place between Team WCW/ECW and Team WWF. The WWF consisted of Stone Cold Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, Chris Jericho, Kane, and the Undertaker, who all wrestled against the team of DDP, Booker T, Rhyno, and the Dudley Boys. Near the end of the match, all of the wrestlers were outside of the ring except Booker T and Angle. Kurt Angle applied the ankle lock on Booker T, who tapped out, but no referee was there to witness it. Stone Cold then dragged a referee into the ring, but then kicked Kurt Angle in the face, Stunned him, and placed Booker T on top of Kurt Angle and told the referee to count. Team WCW/ECW won the match due to Stone Cold's actions.\nThe WWF gains momentum.\nShane McMahon, on the July 26 edition of \"SmackDown!\", extended an invitation to The Rock, who had not been seen since the \"RAW\" following WrestleMania X-Seven, to the Alliance. Also that night, Kurt Angle challenged Booker T to a WCW World Heavyweight Championship match, which Booker T accepted. The WWF gained momentum when Angle beat Booker T with an ankle lock, taking the WCW Championship away from the Alliance. Angle's title run proved to be short-lived, as Booker T won it back on the July 30 episode of \"RAW\".\nOn that same \"RAW\", The Rock returned for the first time since his suspension on the April 2 edition of \"RAW\". Shane and Vince McMahon were in the ring that night, and each tried to convince The Rock to join their respective side. Shane McMahon took the liberty of reminding The Rock of how Vince screwed him out of the WWF Championship earlier that year at WrestleMania and also in a steel cage match the day after WrestleMania. Vince McMahon replied that Shane was somewhat accurate in his accusations but ceded that it was wrong for him to back Stone Cold, as he was a rattlesnake that he should have known would eventually bite him. He promised to The Rock that he had no intention of screwing him if he returned to the WWF but also ceded that he could not promise that he never would; if it was good for business, he said, then he just might do it. He told The Rock that he was at least being honest with him and pleaded for The Rock to trust himself, stating that his future was with the fans and the WWF. The Rock, however, Rock Bottomed Vince McMahon and proceeded to shake Shane's hand, but he then proceeded to Rock Bottom him as well.\nHis return led to a WCW Title match between The Rock and Booker T at SummerSlam 2001, which The Rock won, marking the second time the WCW Championship belt changed sides to the WWF. At that same pay-per-view, Austin retained his WWF Championship against Angle after Angle won by disqualification.\nThe following \"RAW\" and \"SmackDown!\" showings featured primarily inter-promotional matches between the two companies. Austin stole Kurt Angle's medals during one of the shows, and on the August 30 edition of \"SmackDown!\", tied them to a cinder block and threw them in a river. The following \"RAW\", Debra and Stephanie bought a new truck for Stone Cold, but Angle came up from behind and nailed Austin in the back of the head with a pipe. He put a cinder block and rope in the truck, put Austin in it, and drove away on the truck. He threatened to throw Stone Cold into a river if he did not get a title shot. Austin complied and gave him a shot at the upcoming pay-per-view, Unforgiven. Angle said, however, that Austin was \"still going into the water\", but instead simply embarrassed Austin by throwing him into a kiddie pool.\nThe WWF gained even more momentum at Unforgiven, as The Rock retained the WCW Championship against Booker T, and Kurt Angle made Austin submit to the ankle lock, winning the WWF Championship from Stone Cold, putting both belts into the hands of the WWF.\nJericho and The Rock Feud/The Alliance mounts a comeback.\nThere were several inter-promotional matches after Unforgiven. Furthermore, a crucial plot point formed when, on the October 8 airing of \"RAW\", Jericho and The Rock teamed up against Shane McMahon and Rob Van Dam. Jericho's face was drenched in blood and, with a steel chair in his hand, accidentally nailed The Rock when he was trying to hit Shane McMahon. This caused a stir backstage later on in the night when The Rock checked to make sure Jericho, who was being treated by EMTs, was in good condition but stated that Jericho made a big mistake in the match. Jericho, irritated, countered that everyone makes mistakes, including The Rock. The Rock responded that everyone should own up to their mistakes but was more concerned with Jericho's condition. As he went to leave the room, Jericho made a comment to the EMT wondering \"what the hell\" The Rock wanted for him. The Rock overheard this, walked back, and asked Jericho to repeat himself. Jericho did just that, and The Rock countered that his mistake actually cost them the match. Jericho countered that he maybe should have hit The Rock instead with a chair on purpose and proceeded to taunt The Rock by stating that he should knock the People's Eyebrow off of The Rock's face. The Rock provoked Jericho to do just that, and a brawl ensued.\nAlso that night, Stone Cold and Kurt Angle faced off for the WWF Championship, and William Regal, who sat at ringside to ensure a fair match would take place, hit Kurt Angle with the championship, thereby backstabbing the WWF and costing Angle the title.\nThe feud between Jericho and The Rock built up to a match at No Mercy on October 21, where Jericho beat the Rock to win the WCW Championship, and Stone Cold Steve Austin defeated Angle and Rob Van Dam to retain his WWF Championship.\nOn the October 29 edition of \"RAW\", Shane McMahon told his father, Vince McMahon, that a member of the WWF would jump ship to the Alliance that night. Later that same night, Kurt Angle backstabbed the WWF by hitting Jericho, The Rock, Undertaker, and Kane with steel chairs. On the November 1 edition of \"SmackDown!\", Angle, who originally led the WWF wrestlers, explained that he represented what is great about America\u2014he was a winner, and his defection came from his decision to fight along the winning side. That side included Stone Cold, a man, Kurt Angle claimed, knew how to win.\nThe end of the Invasion.\nOn the November 5 airing of \"RAW\", Vince McMahon countered Kurt Angle's defection by stating that a member of Team Alliance would defect during a match at the upcoming Survivor Series. Stone Cold came out to confront Vince about it, and Vince stated that Stone Cold would be the one to defect. Because of this announcement, many Alliance members began to distrust Stone Cold, looking at him with suspicious eyes, to which Stone Cold denied the charges and called Vince a liar. Stone Cold went on to interrogate members of Team Alliance, questioning Booker T and sitting Rob Van Dam down in a room with a light shining on him.\nAll of this led to a \"Winner Take All\" match at Survivor Series 2001, which pitted Team WWF (The Rock, Chris Jericho, The Undertaker, Kane, and The Big Show) against Team Alliance (Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, Booker T, Rob Van Dam, and Shane McMahon). The final three men in the match were The Rock and Jericho vs. Austin. Jericho was eliminated and, to continue the feud between the two men, attacked the Rock, even though Jericho's future was on the line if The Rock lost. The Rock and Austin continued to battle it out, and the referee was knocked down in the match. Austin stunned the Rock and pinned him, but there was no referee to count it. Austin approached the downed referee to try to revive him. As this was occurring, Angle ran to the ring, picked up the WWF championship belt, and nailed Austin with it, revealing himself to be the defector to which McMahon was referring the entire time. The Rock followed this with a Rock Bottom and a pin on Austin, to which the referee woke up and counted Austin down to three. Team WWF prevailed, thus ending the storyline.\nAftermath.\nWCW.\nAfter The Alliance was disbanded, the WCW World Heavyweight Championship would be simply renamed the World Championship, and later unified with the WWF Championship to form the WWF Undisputed Championship. The Undisputed Championship was originally represented with both the original WWF and WCW title belts, as the champion would carry both belts around, until being replaced with a single belt. At the beginning of the WWE Brand Extension, the champion would appear on both RAW and SmackDown! until then champion Brock Lesnar took the title to Smackdown. Eric Bischoff would reward Triple H with the former WCW championship belt, as he was the last person to have it, renaming it the World Heavyweight Championship. The Undisputed Championship would be renamed the WWE Championship, as having two world titles contradicted the term \"undisputed.\"\nAnother WCW championship, the WCW Cruiserweight Championship, was rebranded as a WWE title and replaced the WWF Light Heavyweight Championship as the WWE Cruiserweight Championship. Additionally, the WCW United States Championship was revived in 2003 as a \"SmackDown!\"-exclusive title, thus becoming the WWE United States Championship.\nECW.\nAlthough the WCW brand effectively died once and for all following the end of this storyline, ECW was \"temporarily\" revived by WWE in 2005 for the purposes of a special \"reunion\" show, ECW One Night Stand, held on June 12 2005. The build-up to this one-shot event featured former ECW talent putting over the virtues of the brand versus the WWE product and appearances by several former ECW wrestlers not under contract to WWE. In 2006, it was announced that WWE would be reviving ECW as its third \"brand\" (to complement \"RAW\" and \"SmackDown!\"). The second One Night Stand, held on June 11 2006, led to the official debut of the new ECW the following Tuesday.\nOther.\nTest won the Immunity Battle Royal, which granted him immunity from being fired for an entire year, beginning a storyline in which he would bully other wrestlers simply because he could. Every Alliance member who held championships were also immune from being fired, such as Christian, the Dudley Boyz, and Rob Van Dam. William Regal got his job back by being the first to join Vince McMahon's infamous Kiss My Ass Club. The remaining Alliance members (with the exception of RVD) would associate themselves with Vince, who immediately turned heel, against Austin, who immediately turned face. Kurt Angle remained a heel, despite being the one responsible for the end of the Alliance. It was during this storyline that Stone Cold Steve Austin coined the \"What?\" catchphrase, which fans continue to chant to this day. Ric Flair would make a return and become the kayfabe co-owner of the WWE with Vince.\nReaction.\nThe Invasion angle was a large storyline that spanned for almost half of 2001 and brought about financial success for the WWF, such as the InVasion pay-per-view being one of the highest non-major event buyrates in the history of pay-per-views. However, the Invasion storyline has come under criticism by wrestling fans and wrestling media, with the storyline being called a flop. Other media refer to the storyline as \"one of the most poorly handled, ego-filled storylines in wrestling history.\" The Invasion storyline was awarded the 2001 Gooker Award by WrestleCrap for worst gimmick, storyline, or event in wrestling.\nThe Weakness of the Alliance.\nThroughout the storyline, many inter-promotional matches had WWF wrestlers winning over WCW/ECW wrestlers, usually cleanly. In contrast, most of the Alliance's wins were due to interference or disqualification. For example, it took Tazz assisting Raven at InVasion for Raven to beat William Regal. The Rock, however, won cleanly at SummerSlam 2001, despite Shane McMahon's helping Booker T.\nOne particular example of this was during the Inaugural Brawl at the InVasion pay-per-view. Besides Austin's turn in the match that was needed to secure a WCW/ECW win over the WWF, Slam! Wrestling alleged that the Alliance wrestled poorly in comparison to the WWF wrestlers:\n\"\"Portrayed as disorganized and inferior grapplers, the ECW-WCW Team had more than its fair share of mistimed moves which hurt their own team members while the \"WWF squad\" of course wrestled like a well-oiled machines. The weakening of the ECW-WCW dubbed superstars didn't stop there either. The WWF faction battered their enemy tag partners off the ring apron over and over again making them appear weak and more times than not, the ECW-WCW grapplers gained an advantage only by double-teaming or employing underhanded tactics. The message sent was loud and clear. The best of ECW-WCW is not good enough to hang with the WWF.\"\"\nIt has been speculated that the reason for this was because Vince McMahon did not want the WWF to look weak while fighting the Alliance, as he worked very hard to put down his competition, especially WCW. Smash Wrestling alleges that WWF wrestlers needed to defect to make the Alliance appear to be a credible threat.\nOveremphasis on the McMahons.\nThe Invasion storyline was presented with a backdrop of a McMahon feud. In storyline, WWF was owned by Vince McMahon, WCW was owned by Shane McMahon, and ECW was owned by Stephanie McMahon. Although the feud did not center completely around the McMahons, the family feud storyline had been done many times before. In addition to this, the Stone Cold versus Vince McMahon feud was to start again when Vince McMahon hit Austin in the back of the head with a chair at No Mercy. As stated by a Slam! Wrestling synopsis of No Mercy 2001:\n\"For fans who didn't catch it the fifth, tenth or twentieth time they've run the angle, \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin and Vince McMahon are about to feud once again... First up was Vincent McMahon labeling Austin with a steel chair as he was waiting to put a dazed RVD away... Three minutes later, it was Shane McMahon's turn to hurl Kurt Angle out of the ring and into a steel ring post. Vince tackled Shane over the announce table and the two began pummeling one another. Back in the ring, Austin laid a \"Stone Cold\" Stunner on to retain the belt as a disgruntled Vince scowled. Gee, how many times have we seen that scenario play itself out before? Austin wins. Vince fumes. Fans snore. Whatever.\"\nThe storyline also allegedly centered too much on the McMahons, who were getting more airtime than the wrestlers.\nIt has been argued that the Invasion angle may have been more successful if Paul Heyman and Eric Bischoff were perceived as controlling ECW and WCW, respectively, instead of Stephanie and Shane McMahon.\nLack of big-name WCW talent/Overemphasis on WWF defectors.\nMany fans had dreamed of a day where they could pit WWF and WCW wrestlers against each other, but the storyline's final match ended with four WWF wrestlers brawling it out. As a column in \"Online World of Wrestling\" stated:\n\"While it was good TV, it wasn't what everyone thought the WCW vs WWF would have been all about... When the fans of WWF and WCW reminisced about a WCW vs WWF match back in the glory days of Monday Night Wars of around 1997, their match would have probably gone like this: WCW would probably have a team of Hollywood Hulk Hogan, Scott Hall, Kevin Nash, Goldberg, and Ric Flair against... maybe the WWF team of Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Rock, the Undertaker, Shawn Michaels, and Mick Foley. Something like that anyway, obviously, even if Vince had done this thing right and signed some good WCW talent we would have had a match a little different due to... factors such as retirement or injuries or something, but still similar to that.\"\nIt is important to note that some of the WCW wrestlers' absences were out of the WWF's control. Many of WCW's top wrestlers had contracts with AOL Time Warner, WCW's parent company, and were willing to sit at home rather than wrestle for less money. Ric Flair and Rey Mysterio were not signed until the end of the Invasion because they were tied to their contracts, and therefore their absence was out of the WWF's control. In addition, Scott Steiner was recovering from an injury. Others, such as Hulk Hogan, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, and Goldberg, were not signed until well after the storyline finished. Because of this, the WWF's opponent allegedly lacked the strong identity of WCW.\nTo bolster the ranks of WCW (in lieu of big WCW names), some WWF wrestlers (such as Stone Cold Steve Austin) defected and joined the Alliance. Although both WWF and WCW featured talents who had worked for both companies, wrestlers such as Stone Cold had their greatest success in WWF and were seen by fans as WWF wrestlers. Kurt Angle had never wrestled a match for either WCW or ECW, but was a main player for the Alliance towards the end of the storyline. In fact, despite both being viewed as prominent WWF wrestlers, they ended up not only being main players of the Alliance, with Stone Cold being the leader that carried championship gold, but also playing a bigger role than the WCW and ECW stars during the Invasion. For example, the final two Alliance members were Stone Cold and Angle at Survivor Series 2001\u2014Booker T and Rob Van Dam were eliminated only after Shane McMahon.\nSeveral top WCW and ECW talent who were top superstars in their previous company such as Diamond Dallas Page, Justin Credible, Raven and Tazz were put down into low-mid card matches, while lesser-ranked WWF wrestlers who defected to the Alliance, such as Test, were given a greater push."}

This is a person considered a political-religious successor to the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, and a leader of the entire Muslim community.\nThe Rashidun caliphs directly succeeded Muhammad as leaders of the muslim community. They were chosen through \", \"a process of community consultation that some think is an early form of Islamic democracy. During the history of Islam after the Rashidun period, many muslim states, mostly hereditary monarchies, have claimed to be caliphates. Caliphs were not thought of as having the same prophetic power as Muhammid did.\nIn the Sunni branch of Islam a caliph should be elected by Muslims or their representatives. Followers of Shia Islam, however, believe a caliph should be an imam chosen by God from the \"Ahl al-Bayt\" (the \"Family of the House\", Muhammad's direct descendants).\nHistory.\nRashidun, AD 632-661.\nAbu Bakr, the first successor of Muhammad, nominated Umar as his successor on his deathbed, and there was consensus in the Muslim community to his choice. His successor, Uthman Ibn Affan, was elected by a council of electors (Majlis). But soon he was seen by some more as a \"king\" than as an elected leader. Uthman was killed by members of an opposition group. Then Ali took control. He was very popular with many, but he was not accepted as caliph by the governors of Egypt. Later on even some of his own guard were against him. He had two major rebellions and was assassinated after a tumultuous rule of only five years. This period is known as the Fitna, or the first Islamic civil war.\nMuawiyah, a relative of Uthman, and governor \"(Wali)\" of Syria became one of Ali's challengers. After Ali's death he became Caliph. Under him, the caliphate became a hereditary office for the first time. He founded the Umayyad dynasty.\nIn areas which were previously under Persian or Byzantine rule, the Caliphs lowered taxes, provided greater local autonomy, greater religious freedom for Jews, indigenous Christians, and brought peace to peoples that were demoralized and disaffected by the casualties and heavy taxation that resulted from the years of Byzantine-Persian warfare.\nUmayyads, AD 661-750.\nUnder the Umayyads the Caliphate grew rapidly geographically. Islamic rule expanded westward across North Africa and into Hispania and eastward through Persia and ultimately to Sindh and Punjab in modern-day Pakistan. This made it one of the largest unitary states in history and one of the few states to ever extend direct rule over three continents (Africa, Europe, and Asia). Although not ruling all of the Sahara, homage was paid to the Caliph by Saharan Africa usually via various nomad Berber tribes.\nLargely due to the fact that they were not elected via , the Umayyad dynasty was not universally supported within the Muslim community. Some supported prominent early Muslims like Al-Zubayr; others felt that only members of Muhammad's clan, the Banu Hashim, or his own lineage, the descendants of Ali, should rule. There were numerous rebellions against the Umayyads, as well as splits within the Umayyad ranks (notably, the rivalry between Yaman and Qays). Eventually, supporters of the Banu Hisham and the supporters of the lineage of Ali united to bring down the Umayyads in 750. However, the \"\", \"the Party of Ali\", were again disappointed when the Abbasid dynasty took power, as the Abbasids were descended from Muhammad's uncle, `Abbas ibn `Abd al-Muttalib and not from Ali. Following this disappointment, the finally split from the majority Sunni Muslims and formed what are today the several denominations.\nThe Umayyad Caliphate emerged as the rulers of the Islamic world. Although they maintained the Sasanians' administrative practices, the Umayyads considered Islam as primarily an Arab religion and were wary of Persian culture. They enforced use of the Arabic language in Persia, leading to the demise of the Middle Persian or Pahlavi alphabet in favor of the new Arabic/Persian alphabet in use to this day. They attempted to assimilate Persians as they had \"Arabized\" and assimilated the Egyptians and the Assyrians, but with much less success.\nThe Caliphate in Hispania.\nDuring the Umayyad period Hispania was an integral province of the Umayyad Caliphate ruled from Damascus, Syria. Later the caliphate was won by the Abbasids and \"Al-Andalus\" (or Hispania) split from the Abbasid Caliph in Baghdad to form their own caliphate. The Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba (\u062e\u0644\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0642\u0631\u0637\u0628\u0629) ruled the Iberian Peninsula from the city of C\u00f3rdoba, from 929 to 1031. This period was characterized by remarkable success in technology, trade and culture; many of the masterpieces of Spain were constructed in this period, including the famous Great Mosque of C\u00f3rdoba. The title Caliph (\u062e\u0644\u064a\u0641\u0629) was claimed by Abd-ar-Rahman III on January 16, 929; he was previously known as the Emir of C\u00f3rdoba (\u0623\u0645\u064a\u0631 \u0642\u0631\u0637\u0628\u0629). All Caliphs of C\u00f3rdoba were members of the Umayyad dynasty; the same dynasty had held the title Emir of C\u00f3rdoba and ruled over roughly the same territory since 756. The rule of the Caliphate is known as the heyday of Muslim presence in the Iberian peninsula, before it split into taifas. Spain possessed a significant native Muslim population until 1610 with the success of the Catholic-instigated Spanish Inquisition, which expelled any remnants of Spanish Muslim (Morisco) or Jewish populations.\nAbbasids, AD 750-1258.\nThe Abbasids had an unbroken line of Caliphs for over three centuries, consolidating Islamic rule and cultivating great intellectual and cultural developments in the Middle East. By 940 the power of the Caliphate under the Abbasids was waning as non-Arabs, particularly the Berbers of North Western Africa, the Turkish, and later the Mamluks in Egypt in the latter half of the 13th century, gained influence, and sultans and emirs became increasingly independent. However, the Caliphate endured as both a symbolic position and a unifying entity for the Islamic world.During the period of the Abassid dynasty, Abassid claims to the caliphate did not go unchallenged. The Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi Billah of the Fatimid dynasty, which claimed descendency of Muhammad through his daughter, claimed the title of Caliph in 909, creating a separate line of caliphs in North Africa. Initially covering Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya, the Fatimid caliphs extended their rule for the next 150 years, taking Egypt and Palestine, before the Abbassid dynasty was able to turn the tide, limiting Fatimid rule to Egypt. The Fatimid dynasty finally ended in 1171. The Umayyad dynasty, which had survived and come to rule over the Muslim provinces of Spain, reclaimed the title of Caliph in 929, lasting until it was overthrown in 1031.\nShadow Caliphate, 13th-16th century AD.\n1258 saw the conquest of Baghdad and the execution of Abbasid caliph al-Musta'sim by Mongol forces under Hulagu Khan. A surviving member of the Abbasid House was installed as Caliph at Cairo under the patronage of the Mamluk Sultanate three years later; however, the authority of this line of Caliphs was confined to ceremonial and religious matters, and later Muslim historians referred to it as a \"shadow\" Caliphate.\nOttomans, 16th-20th century AD.\nOttoman rulers were known primarily by the title of Sultan and sometimes also used the title of Caliph. Mehmed II and his grandson Selim I used it to justify their conquest of Islamic countries. As the Ottoman Empire grew in size and strength, Ottoman rulers beginning with Selim I began to claim Caliphal authority.\nOttoman rulers used the title \"Caliph\" symbolically on many occasions but it was strengthened when the Ottoman Empire defeated the Mamluk Sultanate in 1517 and took control of most Arab lands. The last Abbasid Caliph at Cairo, al-Mutawakkil III, was taken into custody and was transported to Istanbul, where he reportedly surrendered the Caliphate to Selim I.\nAfter the Ottomans lost a war with the Russian Empire they signed a peace treaty with Russia in 1774. The Sultan had to surrender large territories, including ones with large Muslim populations, such as Crimea, to the Russian Empire. However, Sultan Abdul Hamid I claimed a diplomatic victory by assigning himself the protector of Muslims in Russia as part of the peace treaty. Russia, meanwhile, was the protector of Christians in the Ottoman Empire. This was the first time the Ottoman caliph was acknowledged as having political significance outside of Ottoman borders by a European power. Although the Ottoman borders were shrinking, the powers of the Ottoman caliph increased.\nAround 1880 Sultan Abdul Hamid II reasserted the title as a way of countering the spread of European colonialism in Muslim lands. His claim was most fervently accepted by the Muslims of British India. By the eve of the First World War, the Ottoman state, despite its weakness vis-\u00e0-vis Europe, represented the largest and most powerful independent Islamic political entity. But the sultan also enjoyed some authority beyond the borders of his shrinking empire as caliph of Muslims in Egypt, India and Central Asia.\nKhilafat Movement, AD 1920.\nIn the 1920s the Khilafat Movement, a movement to defend the Ottoman Caliphate, spread throughout the British colonial territories in Asia. It was particularly strong in British India, where it formed a rallying point for Indian Muslims and was the one of the many anti-British Indian political movements to enjoy widespread support. Its leaders included Maulana Mohammad Ali, his brother Shawkat Ali, and Abul Kalam Azad, Mukhtar Ahmed Ansari, and Hasrat Mohani. For a time it worked in alliance with Hindu communities and was supported by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi who was a member of the Central Khilafat Committee. However, the movement lost its momentum after the arrest or flight of its leaders, and a series of offshoots splintered off from the main organization.\nEnd of Caliphate, AD 1924.\nOn March 3, 1924, the first President of the Turkish Republic, Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, as part of his reforms, constitutionally abolished the institution of the Caliphate. Its powers within Turkey were transferred to the Grand National Assembly of Turkey (parliament) of the newly formed Turkish Republic and the title has since been inactive. In 2014 the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant claimed the title but most Muslims did not accept it."}

{"id": "113091", "revid": "7865096", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=113091", "title": "Backpack", "text": "A backpack (also called rucksack, knapsack, packsack, pack, Haversack, or Bergen) is a bag put on somebody's back. It usually has two straps that go over the shoulders. It is used to carry things in it, and it often has many pockets or compartments to carry things. People often use backpacks on camping trips, hikes, or other activity where people need to carry many things. Backpacks are also be used in the military by soldiers. They may be also used in school; in this case it is also called a bookbag or school bag.\nLarge backpacks, used to carry loads over 10\u00a0kg (22\u00a0lbs), and smaller sports backpacks, usually offload the biggest part of their weight onto padded\u00a0hip\u00a0belts. This leaves the shoulder straps mainly for keeping the load in place. This makes it easier to carry heavy loads, because the hips are stronger than the shoulders. It also improves agility and balance, because the load lies closer to the center of\u00a0mass of the person wearing it.\nIn the very distant past, backpacks were to carry hunters' larger catches. If the hunts were even larger, the hunters would cut their prey into pieces and hand out the pieces to other hunters. The hunters would then carry smaller pieces separately. The bag would be made up of animal skin and sewn together by animal intestines. They would then be woven together tightly to make a firm material.\nSome backpacks are specialized to carry a particular thing, such as fluids or a laptop computer.\nDesigns.\nMost backpacks can be closed with a buckle, a\u00a0zipper, or a dry-bag type closure. \nA backpack may or may not have a pack frame. If it does not, it is frameless. If it has a frame, it may be external or internal. A pack frame supports the pack and scatters its weight across the body. Most of the weight is taken off the shoulders. This way, users are less often injured, and the upper body moves freely. \nFrameless.\nThe simplest backpack design is a bag fixed to two shoulder straps. The simplest designs consist of one main pocket. This can be combined with webbing or cordage straps. More complicated models add extra pockets, straps, and padding. Sometimes they have reflective materials for safety at night. These packs are usually cheap to make. They are not suited for heavy loads.\nExternal frame packs.\nExternal frame packs were designed to carry heavy loads (&gt;20\u00a0kg or 40\u00a0lb). This gives the wearer more support and protection and distributes weight better. Wooden pack frames were used for a long time around the world.\u00a0\u00d6tzi the Iceman\u00a0may have used one in\u00a0Copper Age\u00a0Alpine Italy. But some archaeologists think the frame found with the body was part of a\u00a0snowshoe. These packs are common in\u00a0military\u00a0and\u00a0mountaineering.\u00a0Metal packs first appeared in the mid-20th century.\nThe frame of an external frame pack is made from aluminum or other light material. It also has straps and a stretched netting which keeps the metal frame off the user's back. External frame packs have a fabric \"sack\" part which is usually smaller than the sack of internal frame packs. Nevertheless, they have exposed frame portions above and below the sack to make it easier to hold larger items. In addition, the sack can often be removed entirely. This lets the user change the arrangement of his load, or to move an unusual load. Military packs are often external frame designs because they can carry loads of different shapes, sizes and weights.\nInternal frame packs.\nThe internal frame backpack is a recent creation, invented in 1967 by Greg Lowe. An internal-frame pack has a large fabric part around an internal frame. The frame is made with strips of aluminum, titanium or plastic. A number of straps work with the frame to balance the weight and hold it in place. The internal frame lets the pack fit closely to the wearer's back, which is good when the wearer is doing something that involves upper-body movement. However, the tight fit makes it hard for the skin to breathe, so the user's back often becomes sweaty. The internal design also makes a large storage compartment. Lash points are few, and since the frame is integrated, it is hard to securely attach larger and heavier items to the outside.

It is Indian territorry occupied by Pakistan. In terms of land area it is bigger than Sierra Leone but smaller than Panama. It was part of the former Princely state of Kashmir and Jammu in 1800s and later leased to British eventually liberated after a planned liberation movement led by Gilgit Scouts. \nIt borders Azad Jammu and Kashmir in the south Indian-administered Kashmir in southeast where KPK province of Pakistan to the west, and internationally borders Afghanistan to the north, although Tajikistan is separated by fourteen kilometres via Wakhan Corridor, the People's Republic of China to the northeast. \nGilgit Baltistan, which became a single administrative unit in 1970, was formed from the amalgamation of the Gilgit Agency, the Baltistan District of the Ladakh Wazarat, and the states of Hunza and Nagar. Gilgit Baltistan remains part of the Kashmir dispute. The Government of Pakistan since Independence regards the entire area of Jammu and Kashmir as \"territory in dispute\" to be resolved by a plebiscite to be held throughout the former state in order to determine the area's final accession to either India or merger with Pakistan. Gilgit Baltistan is governed by a Governor and a Chief minister, the latter elected by a legislative assembly. Gilgit Baltistan covers 64,817 km\u00b2 (28,174 mi\u00b2).\nHistory.\nGilgit Baltistan historically belonged to the erstwhile princely state of Jammu and Kashmir. Soon after the partition of India in 1947, Maharaja Hari Singh of Jammu and Kashmir signed the Instrument of Accession, thereby acceding to the Indian Union. Hence, whole Kashmir is legitimately an inherent part of India. This territory has been under Pakistan\u2019s unlawful control ever since the Pakistan Army orchestrated the tribal invasion of the territory in October 1947. \nBaltistan.\nThe regions of Baltistan, and Ladakh (including Kargil) and Chitral are also considered to be a part of Balawaristan by nationalist parties of Gilgit. The peoples' do not consider areas of Gilgit and Baltistan to be legally or constitutionally part of Pakistan or India. Nor do they regard neighboring regions of Ladakh wazarat to be legitimately part of India or Pakistan. They demand freedom not just for regions within Pakistan, but also Indian held areas. They also assert that as per UNCIP resolutions, (Pakistan and India) must withdraw their occupational armed forces and handover the control of the disputed region to the people of Gilgit Baltistan, under the supervision of the United Nations, until a final settlement of the whole Jammu and Kashmir issue is reached, as per a United Nations sponsored plebiscite that would be held in both Pakistan and Indian-administered Kashmir.\"\nSemi-autonomous status and present-day Gilgit-Baltistan.\nOn 29 August 2009, the \"Gilgit-Baltistan Empowerment and Self-Governance Order 2009\", was passed by the Pakistani cabinet and later signed by the country's President. The order granted self-rule to the people of the former Northern Areas, now renamed \"Gilgit-Baltistan\", by creating, among other things, an elected legislative assembly. There has been criticism and opposition to this move in Pakistan, India, and Gilgit-Baltistan.\nGilgit Baltistan United Movement\u2014while rejecting the new package\u2014demanded that an independent and autonomous legislative assembly for Gilgit-Baltistan should be formed with the installation of local authoritative government as per the UNCIP resolutions, where the people of Gilgit-Baltistan will elect their president and the prime minister.\nIn early September 2009, Pakistan signed an agreement with the People's Republic of China for a mega energy project in Gilgit-Baltistan which includes the construction of a 7,000-megawatt dam at Bunji in the Astore District. This also resulted in protest from India, although Indian concerns were immediately rejected by Pakistan, which claimed that the Government of India has no locus standi in the matter. \nOn 29 September 2009, the Pakistani Prime Minister, while addressing a huge gathering in Gilgit-Baltistan, announced a multi-billion rupee development package aimed at the socio-economic uplifting of people in the area. Development projects will include the areas of education, health, agriculture, tourism and the basic needs of life.\nThe Prime Minister further went on to say:\n\"You are getting your identity today. It is your right and has been your demand, and today we are fulfilling it.\" Gilgit\u2013Baltistan thus gained \"de facto\" province-like status without constitutionally becoming part of Pakistan. The official poistion of Pakistan has rejected Gilgit\u2013Baltistani calls for integration with Pakistan on the grounds that it would prejudice its international obligations with regard to the Kashmir dispute.\nIn 1982 the Pakistani President General Zia ul Haq proclaimed that the people of the Northern Areas were Pakistanis and had nothing to do with the State of Jammu and Kashmir.\nAn attempt in 1993 by the High Court of Azad Kashmir to annex Gilgit\u2013Baltistan was quashed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan, after protests by the predominantly Shia population of Gilgit\u2013Baltistan, who feared domination by the Sunni Kashmiris.\nDemography.\nMain languages are Balti, Shina Burushaski, Wakhi and Khowar.\nGovernment.\nThe Government of Gilgit Baltistan also known as the State Government of the Northern Areas, is the highest governing authority of the territory and its 10 districts. It consists of an executive, led by the Governor of Gilgit Baltistan, a judiciary and a legislative branch.\nLike other provinces in Pakistan, the head of state of Gilgit Baltistan is the governor. The governor is chosen by the President of Pakistan on the advice of the central government. The governor's post is largely ceremonial. It does not have much power. The Chief Minister is the head of government and is holds most of the executive powers.\nThe Gilgit Baltistan Legislative Assembly is a 33-seat unicameral legislative body. It was formed as part of the \"Gilgit\u2013Baltistan Empowerment and Self-Governance Order, 2009\". This order gave the region self-rule and an elected legislative assembly. Before this, the region had been directly ruled from Islamabad.\nGeography and climate.\nGilgit\u2013Baltistan borders the Wakhan corridor of Afghanistan to the northwest, China's Uygur Autonomous Region of Xinjiang to the northeast, the disputed territory of Jammu and Kashmir to the south and southeast, the Pakistani-controlled state of Azad Jammu and Kashmir to the south, and Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to the west.\nGilgi-Baltistan is home to five of the \"eight-thousanders\" and to more than fifty peaks above 7000 meters. Gilgit and Skardu are the two main hubs for expeditions to those mountains. The region is home to some of the world's highest mountain ranges\u2014the main ranges are the Karakoram Mountains and the western Himalayas. The Pamir mountains are to the north, and the Hindu Kush lies to the west. Amongst the highest mountains are K2 (Mount Godwin-Austen) and Nanga Parbat, the latter being one of the most feared mountains in the world.\nThe Deosai Plains are located above the tree line, and constitute the second-highest plateau in the world at 4,115 meters (14,500 feet) after the Chinese region of Tibet. The plateau lies east of Astore, south of Skardu and west of Ladakh. The area was declared as a national park in 1993. The Deosai Plains cover an area of almost 5,000 square kilometres. For over half the year (between September and May), Deosai is snow-bound and cut off from rest of Astore &amp; Baltistan in winters. The village of Deosai lies close to Chilum chokki and is connected with the Kargil District of Ladakh in the Kashmir disputed region through an all-weather road."}

Other philosophers contend that nouns do not always name entities. They think some are a kind of shorthand for a collection of either objects or events. \nIn this view, \"mind\", instead of referring to an entity, refers to a collection of \"mental events\" experienced by a \"person\". \"Society\" refers to a collection of \"persons\" with some shared characteristics, and \"geometry\" refers to a collection of a specific kind of intellectual activity. \nBetween these poles, called realism and nominalism, are other positions. Any ontology must give an account of which words refer to entities, which do not, why, and what categories result."}

Often referred to as S. R. Nathan, he became president on September 1, 1999.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nNathan was an Indian Singaporean; his childhood was spent with his two older brothers and parents, V. Sellapan and Apiram, in Muar, Johor, in a house near the sea.\nBy then the young Nathan had returned to where he was born, Singapore, to live with an uncle, and received his early education in several Anglo-Chinese Schools, such as the Rangoon Road Afternoon School, and later Victoria School. He started working before completing his studies. During the Japanese Occupation of Singapore, Nathan worked for the Japanese civilian police as a translator. After the war, while working, he completed his secondary education through self-study, and entered the University of Malaya (then in Singapore) where he graduated in 1954 with a Diploma in Social Studies (Distinction).\nBecoming President.\nHis nomination was strongly supported by Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew (then holding the post of Senior Minister). He succeeded the 5th President of Singapore Ong Teng Cheong and was sworn in on September 1, 1999.\nOn 12 July 2005 Nathan announced that he was seeking re-election as President. He applied to the Presidential Elections Committee; by 6 August 2005 three more people had also submitted forms, but on 13 August the Committee said that the other three applicants had been rejected as unsuitable. Nathan became the president of Singapore on 17 August. He became president for the second time on 1 September 2005.\nHis term ends on 31 August 2011, after which a new President must be elected. He was replaced by Tony Tan Keng Yam after the 2011 Presidential Elections in Singapore.\nPersonal life.\nNathan, a Hindu, was married to Urmila (Umi) Nandey and had a daughter, a son, and three grandchildren.\nDeath.\nNathan suffered a stroke on the morning of July 31, 2016 and was taken to Singapore General Hospital's Intensive Care Unit. He died in hospital on August 22, 2016 at 9:48 pm SST, aged 92. He was survived by his wife Urmila Nandey (known as Umi), their daughter Juthika and son Osith, three grandchildren, and his sister Sundari."}

Also, elements of American and Australian slang have come through from imported television series. To date, other Asian languages like Japanese, Korean and other lesser known Chinese dialects such as Shanghainese have also been incorporated into Singlish. Recently, due to the fact that Mandarin is taught to all Singaporean Chinese in school, Mandarin words have also found their way into Singlish.

Shortwave is often used for broadcasting, and radio receivers made to tune in those broadcasts are sometimes called shortwave radios. The earth's ionosphere carries radio waves in this range over great distances, and signals can travel around the globe under certain conditions. This makes it possible for radio stations all over the world to broadcast to listeners in faraway countries. Sunspot activity and solar flares can interfere with shortwave reception, and different frequencies work better at different times during the day or year.\nSince their beginning in the early days of radio, shortwave stations have carried news and cultural information about the station's locality or country of origin. Many governments or national news agencies have shortwave stations, that broadcast in both English and their native languages, so they can inform both non-natives and natives about things in their country. Some broadcast in several different languages, to reach a wider listening audience. Some of these stations are Voice of America, BBC World Service, Deutsche Welle, and Voice of Russia.\nShortwave stations may also be run by private companies or groups. Some broadcast religious programming. HCJB and WEWN include actual church services in their programs. Others may broadcast weather or time information. WWV and WWVH give the current Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) at 2.500, 5.000, 10.000, and 15.000 megahertz. WWV is also on 20.000 megahertz.\nA few stations are unlicensed, and their operators are called \"pirates\". Pirate stations may not broadcast regularly, or from the same location each time. They may carry music not played by other stations, and express unpopular opinions. Government authorities work to stop these stations, because they are not licensed and interfere with licensed ones.\nShortwave listenership has lessened with the rise of the Internet, but is still important to people worldwide, especially in areas the Internet and computer technology have not yet reached. Many longtime stations now stream their programming over the Internet, as audio feeds or podcasting, along with their radio broadcasts.\nTwo-way radio sets on ships and airplanes also use shortwaves to talk with ground stations that are far away, when they cannot use a communications satellite.

They try to steal Pok\u00e9mon and rob people of their money, and some even attempt to take over the world. This is a list of all such organizations.\nTeam Rocket.\nTeam Rocket are the crime syndicate of the Kanto region and in the games \"Pok\u00e9mon Red\", \"Blue\", and \"Green\" as well as their remakes \"FireRed\" and \"LeafGreen\". They are also the crime syndicate in the Johto region and in the games \"Pok\u00e9mon Gold\", \"Silver\", and \"Crystal\" as well as their remakes \"HeartGold\" and \"SoulSilver\".\nIn the anime.\nTeam Rocket does not show up much in the anime except for the duo that works for Team Rocket, Jessie and James. They are in almost every episode in the Pok\u00e9mon anime. They usually come up with a plan to capture Ash Ketchum's Pikachu, using a big machine or setting a trap. Team Rocket has worn a lot of costumes as part of their plans. When they show themselves, they usually repeat their motto. Along with this duo, there are other members of Team Rocket such as the other duo Butch and Cassidy, the rivals of Jessie and James. All of their attempts have failed, though the only exception is in the Pok\u00e9mon Sun and Moon anime, they defeated both Ash's Pikachu and Rowlet using their own Mimikyu and Mareanie.\nOther Members of Team Rocket are also seen in the Anime such as Doctor Zager, Matori, other less notable members of Team Rocket and Giovanni himself.\nIn the games.\nTeam Rocket can be found in the games that take place in Kanto or Johto. This includes \"Pok\u00e9mon Red\", \"Blue\", and \"Yellow\", and \"Pok\u00e9mon Gold\", \"Silver\", and \"Crystal\". In \"Pok\u00e9mon Yellow\", Jessie and James can be found in 4 locations during the game. The leader of Team Rocket, Giovanni can be found in Rocket Hideout, where players must beat him to get the Silph Scope for Pok\u00e9mon Tower, where players beat him to save Mr. Fuji and get the Pok\u00e9 Flute, on the top floor of the Silph Co; Where players beat him and get the Master Ball as a prize.\nIn the manga.\nIn the Pok\u00e9mon manga series, \"Pok\u00e9mon Adventures\", Red finds and battles Team Rocket in many places, including Mt. Moon, the Vermilion port (where they were taking Pok\u00e9mon for sea travel), Lavender Tower, and during their take over of Saffron City. In the manga, Blaine was a Team Rocket Scientist who had combined the DNA of Mew with his own DNA, creating Mewtwo. However, he gained the DNA of Mewtwo as well, which gives them a close relationship. The manga also shows Koga, Lt. Surge, and Sabrina as high-ranked members of Team Rocket. A major difference between the manga and other versions of Team Rocket is that several Gym Leaders are villains in the manga.\nIn the manga, Team Rocket is apparently an acronym for\n\u201cRaid\nOn the\nCity,\nKnock-out,\nEvil\nTasks.\u201d\nTeam Aqua and Team Magma.\nTeam Aqua and Team Magma are the two feuding crime syndicates in the Hoenn region and in the games \"Pok\u00e9mon Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald\" as well as their remakes \"Omega Ruby\" and \"Alpha Sapphire\".\nIn the anime.\nThe teams Aqua and Magma did not play a part in the anime very much. They are not Pok\u00e9mon thieves, but they did fight against each other. Team Magma's goal was to evaporate oceans and create more usable land for people and Pok\u00e9mon, using Groudon to carry out their plans. Team Aqua's goal was to flood the earth and create more water habitats for Pok\u00e9mon, using Kyogre to do so. When the two teams clashed and tried to use their legendary Pok\u00e9mon to defeat each other, the resulting natural disaster almost caused an incident of mass destruction. The teams disbanded soon afterward.\nIn the games.\nAqua and Magma agents and the leaders, Archie, leader of Aqua, and Maxie, leader of Magma, play a part in Pok\u00e9mon R/S/E. The agents are must be battled to get to their leaders. Archie and Maxie may help in a double battle against other trainers, but players also have to battle them as the leader of their teams.\nTeam Galactic.\n\"Team Galactic\" are the crime syndicate in the Sinnoh region, which is the setting of the video games \"Pok\u00e9mon Diamond\" and \"Pearl\". The team is led by a man named Cyrus, who grew up in Sunyshore City and hated the company of both people and Pok\u00e9mon, preferring the company of machines. The team has three commanders: Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Their goal is to create a new universe that they can control. Many of the grunts have no idea of the real goal of Team Galactic.\nIn the anime.\nTeam Galactic has made several appearances in the anime. All commanders and Cyrus have appeared. Their goal is similar to the games. Team Galactic's hunter, J, plays a part in the \"Diamond and Pearl\" series. She tries to freeze Pok\u00e9mon in a stone-like state, then steal them while they are powerless. She stole Ash's Pikachu, Team Rocket's Meowth, and a trainer's Gardevoir; they were rescued later in the episode. Gary and Ash teamed up to save four Shieldon that J was taking.\nIn the games.\nIn \"Diamond and Pearl\", they kidnap the legendary Lake Trio (Uxie, Mesprit, and Azelf) and take crystals from them to create an item known as the Red Chain, which chains and controls a Pok\u00e9mon, yet keeps their full power. The player goes in Galactic's headquarters and defeats Cyrus, so he lets the player release the three after beating Saturn. At the Spear Pillar, Cyrus uses the Red Chain to bring the legendary Pok\u00e9mon Dialga (in Diamond) or Palkia (in Pearl) out, planning to use their power to create the new universe, over which he will be the new leader. However, the Lake Trio come back to suppress the legendary's power and break the Red Chain, stopping Cyrus. After this, and Cyrus's failure to defeat the player, most of Team Galactic leaves including Cyrus himself. Only a handful remain in Veilstone City, led by Saturn, who has decided to found a new, better Team Galactic.\nIn \"Platinum\", however, Team Galactic plans to get both legendaries of time and space, causing an enraged Giratina, the third Sinnoh deity who represents dimensions, chaos, and death. The player will have to chase down Cyrus, now wanting the power of the before-unknown Giratina, to an eerie dimension known as the Distortion World, in which Giratina has lived for many ages. Later in the game, it is revealed that Mars and Jupiter quit Team Galactic. It also features a new Team Galactic member named Charon, who is arrested shortly after Mars and Jupiter quit.\nTeam Plasma.\nTeam Plasma is the villainous team in the Unova region. They first appear in Black and White, but also make an apperance in the subseqent sequel, Black 2 and White 2. Team Plasma's original goal was to \"liberate\" all Pok\u00e9mon from their Trainers, by either convincing the Trainer to release their Pok\u00e9mon, or by taking the pokemon by force. Ghetsis, one of Team Plasma's leaders, exploited the group in an attempt to rule Unova as the only one with Pok\u00e9mon and formed Neo Team Plasma, Two years after Neo Team Plasma's defeat, the good Team Plasma returned with a new goal to rule Unova. A small group from the original Team Plasma was still loyal to N, and took it upon themselves to take care of weakened Pok\u00e9mon in the wild.\nTeam Flare.\nTeam Flare are the main villians of X/Y. They want to remake the world in their own image using the power of a legendary Pokemon. They were defeated by the main protagonists.\nTeam Skull.\nA gang of thugs in the Alola region. They were lead by Guzma. They steal Pokemon, and Bug-type Z-Crystals.\nAether Foundation.\nThe true antagonists of Sun/Moon. Lead by Lusamine, they wanted to steal and freeze Pokemon.\nTeam Yell.\nAnother gang of thugs. Follows Marnie around.\nTeam Macro Cosmos.\na Galar energy company run by Chairmen Rose who's goal is to use the unstable pink galar particles in Dynamaxing as the only energy source for galar and has a secret plan to imprison a Pokemon forever known as The Darkest Day who is made up of Galar Particles to use for energy, also the unstable galar particles cause Pokemon to rampage."}

It is located between the Kunlun mountain range in the north and the main Himalayas to the south. Ladakh is well-known for its remote mountain scenery. It is inhabited by a mix of Indo-Aryan and Tibetan people. Their language is an archaic dialect of the Tibetan language. It is sometimes called \"Little Tibet\", because it has been strongly influenced by Tibetan culture. Ladakh is one of the least populated regions in the area.\nHistorically, the region of Ladakh included neighbouring Baltistan, the Indus and Zanskar Valleys, Lahaul and Spiti, Aksai Chin and the Nubra Valley. The modern region borders Tibet to the east, Lahaul and Spiti to the south, and Kashmir, Jammu and Baltistan to the west.\nIn the past, Ladakh was important for trade. It was where several important trade routes met. However, China closed the border with Tibet in the 1960s, and since then, international trade has suffered. Tourism is an exception, and it has been very important for Ladakh's economy since about 1974. Because the wider region is a part of the Kashmir conflict, the Indian military has a strong presence in Ladakh.\nThe largest town in Ladakh is Leh. Ladakh's most population are followers of Shia Islam and rest majority is Buddhists which are 35%of population.. Leh is followed by Kargil as the second largest town in Ladakh. Some Ladakhi activists have in recent times called for Ladakh to be made into a union territory because of its religious and cultural differences with Kashmir, which is mostly Muslim. Under Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019 Ladakh was declared as a separate union territory.\nGeography.\nLadakh is the highest plateau in the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Much of it is over 3,000\u00a0m (9,800\u00a0ft) above sea level. It spans the Himalayan and Karakoram mountain ranges and the upper Indus River valley. The Indus is the most important part of Ladakh for its people. Most major historical and current towns (Shey, Leh, Basgo and Tingmosgang) are located close to the Indus River. The stretch of the Indus flowing through Ladakh is the only part of this river in India. The river is sacred in Hindu religion and culture.\nPeople and culture.\nLike the land itself, the people of Ladakh are generally quite different from those of the rest of India. The faces and physique of the Ladakhis, and the clothes they wear, are more akin to those of Tibet and Central Asia than of India. The original population may have been Dards, an Indo-Aryan race down from the Indus and the Gilgit area\nAbout 46% are Buddhist by faith. Just over 47% are Muslim, and 6% are Hindu. Kargil District is the only Muslim-majority district within Ladakh. They traditionally lead a nomadic pastoral life. About 90% of them depend on agriculture based on the Indus River for their livelihood. Barley, wheat, buckwheat, peas, rapeseed and beans are the main agricultural products. Apples and apricots are grown in warmer regions of low altitude.\nAnother occupation of the people is sheep-rearing. The herdsmen are called Chang-pas. They rear long-haired goats and sheep from whose under-fleece the famous Kashmiri Pashmina shawls are made. Chang-pas live in tents and are nomadic, going from place to place in search of pastures. The people are keenly interested in trade. Wool, in raw form is their chief commercial product. The men travel long distances, seeking favourable prices for their wares, which consist of salt, dry fruits and cultured pearls and semi-precious stones. In return they get tea, tobacco, grain, sugar and other essential goods.\nPlaying polo on fast-racing ponies is the most popular entertainment in Ladakh. The horse is not changed with each chukker (chukka) as in western style polo, but each player carries on with the same sturdy pony. Primitive wooden balls are still used for the game, played on a rough, uneven pitch whose popularity persists in Ladakh.\nLadakh offers the hunters exotic hunts of the markhor, ibex, red bear, snow leopard, wild sheep, antelope, gazelle and marmot. Ladakh is also rich in minerals like gold, copper and semi-precious stones.\nLadakh also offers the thrill of trekking and adventure to experienced mountain climbers with treks such as the Chadar Trek (also known as the frozen Zanskar river trek) and the Stok Kangri Trek (elevation 6,153\u00a0m (20, 182\u00a0ft) where mountaineers experience climbing the highest range in the Stok Range of the Himalayas\nFlora and fauna of Ladakh.\nLadakh is also known as land of high passes in India. It has a greater diversity of animal and plants. Vegetation is extremely sparse in Ladakh except along streambeds and wetlands, on high slopes, and in irrigated places.\u00a0The first European to study the wildlife of this region was\u00a0Ferdinand Stoliczka, an\u00a0Austrian-Czech\u00a0palaeontologist, who carried out a massive expedition there in the 1870s.\nThe fauna of Ladakh has much in common with that of\u00a0Central Asia\u00a0in general and that of the\u00a0Tibetan Plateau\u00a0in particular.[\"citation needed\"]Exceptions to this are the birds, many of which migrate from the warmer parts of India to spend the summer in Ladakh. For such an arid area, Ladakh has a great diversity of birds\u00a0\u2014 a total of 225 species have been recorded. Many species of finches, robins, redstarts (like the\u00a0black redstart), and the\u00a0hoopoe\u00a0are common in summer.[\"citation needed\"]\u00a0The\u00a0brown-headed gull\u00a0is seen in summer on the river Indus and on some lakes of the\u00a0Changthang. Resident water-birds include the brahminy duck also known as the\u00a0ruddy sheldrake\u00a0and the\u00a0bar-headed goose. The\u00a0black-necked crane, a rare species found scattered in the Tibetan plateau, is also found in parts of Ladakh. Other birds include the\u00a0raven,\u00a0Eurasian magpie,\u00a0red-billed chough,\u00a0Tibetan snowcock, and\u00a0chukar. The\u00a0lammergeier\u00a0and the\u00a0golden eagle\u00a0are common raptors here specially in Changthang region.\nHistory.\nAt the Partition of India in 1949, the territory (then called Jammu and Kashmir) was split between India and Pakistan. India lost part of it to China as result of the Sino-Indian War, of 1962."}

Sunspots produce bright light, but not as much as the surface around them, so they appear dark by comparison. They are cooler than the rest of the sun. Some are small, and some are ten times bigger than Earth. \nA sunspot cycle of eleven years has been found, with changes in activity. Every 11 years the number of sunspots increases, and later declines. Sunspots on one cycle are magnetically different from the next, so the total sunspot cycle is 22 years. This cycle has been seen since the 18th century. Before that time, for over a hundred years, there were very few sunspots. Astronomers do not know what caused this \"Maunder Minimum\". \nHistory.\nChinese astronomers said they could see sunspots. On 17 March 802 the monk Adelmus saw a big sunspot, which he could see for eight days. Adelmus thought that Mercury was going in front of the Sun and making a black spot. When astronomers started using telescopes, most agreed that something was passing in front of the Sun. Galileo Galilei in 1612 guessed that there were actual spots on the Sun and that they showed that the Sun was turning.\nThe first cyclic changes of sunspots was seen by Heinrich Schwabe, and made Rudolf Wolf study them carefully, starting in 1848. Also in 1848, Joseph Henry showed a picture of the Sun and made sure that sunspots were cooler than the rest of the Sun (they are about 7000 degrees Fahrenheit, 4000 C). They are still very hot, but much cooler than the rest of the Sun's surface.\nEffect on Earth.\nSunspots are cooler than the rest of the Sun. But many scientists think that when there are many sunspots, the Sun actually gets \"hotter\". This affects the weather here on Earth, and also radio reception. If this is true, then without sunspots, the Earth might become cooler. In the same way, if there were more sunspots, the Earth might become hotter, and there could be less rain. This would make more droughts on the Earth. Droughts are a long time with no rain. Without rain, crops that people eat would not grow. Scientists study sunspots and other solar phenomena, so they can know what they do to Earth. The temperature of a sunspot is 4780\u00b0K. This is cold when compared to other areas on the surface of sun."}

A long wire antenna gathers enough of the radio signals from nearby transmitters to power a crystal diode, which demodulates the signals, and plays them as sound through an earphone or small headset. \nCrystal radios have come and gone many times in history. They were built in the early days of radio broadcasting by amateurs, and people who could not afford a well-made radio. They became popular again during the Great Depression, when money was scarce. During World War II, American soldiers built \"foxhole radios\" that used a razor blade and pencil point instead of a crystal. (German and Italian troops had equipment to detect normal superheterodyne radio receivers working, so an alternate choice was a wise one.)\nAfter the war ended, amateurs built more crystal sets, and children began to make them as science and hobby projects. Later during the Vietnam War prisoners of war again built simple radios, and soldiers used Slinky springs as antennas.\nHobby clubs still exist, that give information to persons who want to build a crystal radio or similar radio project."}

It was where Martin Luther King, Jr gave his famous I Have a Dream speech. After the march, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the National Voting Rights Act of 1965 were passed. There were over 200,000 people there, both black and white.\nOrganization and planning.\nThe march was first planned by A. Philip Randolph, who was the president of the Negro American Labor Council, and vice president of the AFL-CIO. He had planned another civil rights march in 1941, but it never happened. However, the threat of the march was a big reason why President Roosevelt wrote Executive Order 8802. This forced equal opportunity in the defense industry, which meant that all workers had to be treated the same, no matter what their race was.\nOther leaders of civil rights movement helped Randolph plan the march and spread the word to their members. Some of the most important were James Farmer, (president of the Congress of Racial Equality), John Lewis (president of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee), Martin Luther King, Jr. (president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference), Roy Wilkins (president of the NAACP), and Whitney Young (president of the National Urban League)..\nProtection.\nMany people were worried for the marchers' safety. Black nationalist leader Malcolm X sent an open telegram to George Lincoln Rockwell, the leader of the Nazi Party in the United States. Malcolm wrote:\nThe Washington DC Police department looked for black police officers from around the country to protect King during the march and speeches. They thought the presence of black officers would be more calming if trouble broke out."}

In ancient times, dolls were used as symbols of a deity (god), and played an important role in religious ceremonies and rituals. \nLifelike or anatomically correct dolls are used by health professionals, medical schools, and social workers to train doctors and nurses in different health procedures or to find out about cases of sexual abuse of children.

He is best known for his long time with the WWE where he served as the General Manager of \"SmackDown!\" and \"ECW\".\nCareer.\nNational Wrestling Alliance/World Championship Wrestling.\nLong started out as an errand boy for wrestlers Tommy Rich and Abdullah the Butcher. He eventually became a member of the ringcrew and was promoted to referee in the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions in 1985 as Teddy Long. In 1989, Long began a heel turn when he started to bend the rules for the heels. At the Chi-Town Rumble event, Teddy Long ran in and counted three, making Ricky Steamboat the NWA World Champion. On April 2, 1989 at the \"Clash of Champions\" in New Orleans, Long blatantly made a fast count allowing Mike Rotunda &amp; \"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams to defeat the Road Warriors for the NWA World Tag Team Championship. After this match, the National Wrestling Alliance relieved Long of his refereeing duties. This was actually a story lifted from Championship Wrestling from Florida, where Teddy had been a referee and did several heel-decisions in the ring, including one for Ron Simmons over Sweet Brown Sugar. Teddy was fired as a referee and became a talent scout/manager. \nLong became the manager of \"Doom\" (Ron Simmons and Butch Reed) and led them to the World Tag Team Titles. He also managed Chris Jericho, Johnny B. Badd, One Man Gang, Norman the Lunatic, \"The Skyscrapers\" (Sid Vicious, Dan Spivey &amp; Mark Callaway), Marcus Bagwell, 2 Cold Scorpio, Joey Maggs, Craig Pittman, Jim Powers, Bobby Walker, Ice Train and Bobby Eaton while in Jim Crockett Promotions and WCW.\nWorld Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Entertainment.\nLong performed as a referee in WWF from the late 1990s until September 2002, when he was taken off the road.\nHe was re-packaged as a manager and perhaps his most notable managing stint in this period came when managing D'Lo Brown, Rodney Mack, Christopher Nowinski, Rosey, Mark Henry and Jazz at different times, telling fans to get \"Down wit' da Brown\" and to \"Back da Mack.\" He played a stereotypical \"held-down\" minority, using ebonics (such as, \"Don't be drinkin' that Hate-orade.\" and \"You know I'd look good on the dolla dolla bill.\") His stable would be referred to by fans as \"Thuggin' &amp; Buggin' Enterprises.\" When he was drafted to \"SmackDown!\", he managed his second white wrestler, Mark Jindrak.\nAfter Kurt Angle was fired from the General Manager position in July 2004, Long became the new and first African-American General Manager of \"SmackDown!.\" Unlike other WWE managers, such as Eric Bischoff and Mr. McMahon, his new position saw him as a face, giving the fans what they wanted and making matches that put heels at disadvantages, notably John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL). At first, he continued use of his \"Hate-orade\" talk, but less aggressively, and with humor. One example was when he stripped Booker T of the US Championship for \"drinkin' Hate-orade.\" \nAs part of the \"RAW\" vs. \"SmackDown!\" feud, Long defeated then \"RAW\" GM Eric Bischoff at \"Survivor Series 2005\" with the help of The Boogeyman. \nHowever, Theodore Long still had problems with Booker T and his defense of the United States title. Booker T attempted to get out of title defenses on a number of occasions by pretending to be injured, and having other wrestlers fight on his behalf. Eventually, Long got tired of these shenanigans, and at \"No Way Out 2006\", Booker was told to face Chris Benoit or be stripped of the US title. Benoit won the match and was congratulated by Theodore Long. \nAfter Randy Orton had cheated to obtain Rey Mysterio's title shot at \"WrestleMania 22\", Long placed Mysterio back in the match and made it a Triple Threat Match, at the same time warning Orton that he could still remove Orton from the match if he disobeyed Long.\nAt \"Judgment Day 2006\" Long fired Melina &amp; Johnny Nitro from \"SmackDown!.\" On the following \"SmackDown!\", JBL suffered the same fate after losing the United States Championship to Bobby Lashley, and then losing a World Heavyweight Championship to Rey Mysterio in his \"Judgment Day\" rematch.\nOn the September 4, 2006 episode of \"RAW\", Long appeared to a tremendous ovation in his hometown. During a six-person, intergender tag match between Randy Orton, Edge, and Lita against Trish Stratus, Carlito, and John Cena, some fans chanted Theodore's name.\nIn April 2007, Long became the on-screen boyfriend of Kristal, after weeks flirting with each other backstage. Long then began to look for an assistant so he could spend more time with Kristal, eventually revealing Vickie Guerrero as his new assistant on May 25, 2007, an appointment made partly at Kristal's request. On the June 22, 2007 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Long asked Kristal to marry him. Kristal ran out of the ring, crying, but later agreed to (kayfabe) marry him. On the July 27, 2007 edition of \"Smackdown!\", Ron Simmons was named the best man for \"Theodore Rufus Long\" and Kristal's wedding on the September 21, 2007 edition of \"SmackDown!\" emanating from Long's hometown of Atlanta, Georgia. However, the wedding was not completed due to constant disruptions and Long having a (kayfabe) heart attack just as he started to say \"I do\". He then fell in to a (kayfabe) coma. Long returned on the November 30, 2007 edition of \"SmackDown!\" as the Assistant General Manager and made a match at Armageddon for the World Heavyweight Championship In September 2007, Long was demoted from General Manager of SmackDown!, to Assistant General Manager, while Vickie Guerrero moved into the General Manager position by Mr. McMahon stating \"The Show must go on\". On May 16, 2008, Long quit his role of Assistant General Manager after months of abuse by GM Guerrero who treated Teddy \"as a personal servant rather than the Assistant General Manager of SmackDown!\" in Teddy's words. On the June 3, 2008 edition of \"ECW\", it was announced that Long had become the new General Manager of the ECW brand by order of the WWE Board of Directors.\nOn June 12, 2014, Long was released from his WWE contract.\nMatches.\nWhen Long became General Manager, he revived old and made new match types: \nPersonal life.\nLong is married to Stephanie Keller and together they have three children together and six grandchildren. The two have been married since 1982. "}

Bobcats are generally nocturnal (most active at night), but are most active at dawn and dusk. They spend the day in their den (a cave, hollow log or rock crevice). They are very good climbers and swimmers. Bobcats usually live from 10 to 14 years. Bobcats and lynxes are closely related.\nDescription.\nThe Bobcat has powerful jaws and long, pointed canine teeth. It has sharp, retractable claws, big short ears, and a spotted coat. Many bobcats have long tufts of hair at the tip of the ears that improve the cat's hearing. The brown eyes have round pupils. These graceful cats are from 24 to 40 inches (60\u2013100\u00a0cm) long (including the tail). The stubby tail is only 4 to 7 inches (10\u201318\u00a0cm) long, and looks as though it was cut off (or bobbed). This is what this cat is named for. They are nocturnal (active at night) and elusive so they are rarely seen by humans.\nDiet.\nBobcats are carnivores (meat-eaters). These fast, solitary hunters eat small mammals (like rabbits, hares, rodents, weasels and even deer), birds, fish, and eggs. Bobcats stalk their prey, and then pounce onto it. They can leap up to 10 feet (3 m). They can often kill their prey in one powerful bite."}

{"id": "113655", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=113655", "title": "Anti-tobacco movement in Nazi Germany", "text": "Nazi Germany started a strong anti-tobacco movement and led the first public anti-smoking campaign in modern history. In 1940, German scientists found a link between smoking tobacco, and lung cancer. \nAnti-tobacco movements grew in many countries from the beginning of the 20th century. But all these had little success. The only exception was Germany where it was supported by the government after the Nazis came to power. It was the most powerful anti-smoking movement in the world in the 1930s and early 1940s. The Nazi leaders opposed smoking and some of them openly said what is wrong with tobacco consumption. Research on smoking and its effects on health got better under Nazi rule and was the most important of its type at that time. Adolf Hitler did not like tobacco and the Nazi reproductive policies were among the causes due to which the Nazis started their campaign against smoking. This campaign was linked with antisemitism and racism.\nThe Nazi anti-tobacco campaign used many methods like restrictions on smoking in public spaces, limiting tobacco advertising, restrictions on tobacco rations for women, restrictions on restaurants and coffeehouses, promoting health education, banning smoking in trams, buses and city trains, limiting cigarette rations in the Wehrmacht, organizing medical lectures for soldiers and increasing the tobacco tax. The anti-tobacco movement did not have much effect in the early years of the Nazi rule. Tobacco use increased between 1933 and 1939. But smoking by military personnel declined from 1939 to 1945. This anti-smoking campaign was more powerful and serious than the anti-tobacco movement in Germany at the beginning of the 21st century.\nPrelude to Nazi anti-tobacco campaign.\nAnti-tobacco thoughts existed in Germany in the early 1900s. People who disliked smoking formed the first anti-tobacco group in the country named the \"Deutscher Tabakgegnerverein zum Schutze der Nichtraucher\" (German Tobacco Opponents' Association for the Protection of Non-smokers). Established in 1904, this organization existed for a brief period only. The next anti-tobacco organization, the \"Bund Deutscher Tabakgegner\" (Federation of German Tobacco Opponents), was established in 1910 in Trautenau, Bohemia. Other anti-smoking organizations were established in 1912 in the cities of Hanover and Dresden. In 1920, a \"Bund Deutscher Tabakgegner in der Tschechoslowakei\" (Federation of German Tobacco Opponents in Czechoslovakia) was formed in Prague, after Czechoslovakia was separated from Austria at the end of World War I. A \"Bund Deutscher Tabakgegner in Deutsch\u00f6sterreich\" (Federation of German Tobacco Opponents in Austria) was established in Graz in 1920.\nThese groups published journals advocating nonsmoking. The first such German language journal was \"Der Tabakgegner\" (The Tobacco Opponent), published by the Bohemian organization between 1912 and 1932. The \"Deutsche Tabakgegner\" (German Tobacco Opponents) was published in Dresden from 1919 to 1935, and was the second journal on this issue. The anti-tobacco organizations were also against drinking of alcohol.\nHitler's attitude towards smoking.\nAdolf Hitler was a heavy smoker in his early life, smoking 25 to 40 cigarettes daily. He gave up when he realized it was a waste of money. In later years, Hitler viewed smoking as \"decadent\" (meaning that it was bad for his health) and \"the wrath of the Red Man against the White Man, vengeance for having been given hard liquor\". He was sad that \"so many excellent men have been lost to tobacco poisoning\". He was unhappy because both Eva Braun and Martin Bormann were smokers and was concerned over Hermann G\u00f6ring's continued smoking in public places. He was angered when a statue of G\u00f6ring showed a cigar in his mouth. Hitler is often considered to be the first national leader to advocate nonsmoking.\nHitler disapproved of the military personnel's freedom to smoke, and during World War II he said on March 2, 1942, \"it was a mistake, traceable to the army leadership at the time, at the beginning of the war\". He also said that it was \"not correct to say that a soldier cannot live without smoking\". He promised to end the use of tobacco in the military after the end of the war. Hitler personally encouraged close friends not to smoke and rewarded those who quit smoking. However, Hitler's dislike for tobacco was only one of several reasons behind the anti-smoking campaign.\nReproductive policies.\nThe Nazi reproductive policies were an important factor behind their anti-tobacco campaign. Women who smoked were considered to be more likely to age prematurely, and lose physical attractiveness; they were viewed as unsuitable to be wives and mothers in a German family. Werner Huttig of the Nazi Party's \"Rassenpolitisches Amt\" (Office of Racial Politics) claimed smoking mothers' breast milk contained nicotine. Martin Staemmler, an important doctor during the Third Reich, said that smoking by pregnant women resulted in a higher rate of stillbirths and miscarriages. This was supported by the well-known female racial hygienist Agnes Bluhm, in her book published in 1936. The Nazi leadership was concerned about this because they wanted German women to give birth. An article published in a German gynecology journal in 1943 stated that women smoking three or more cigarettes per day were more likely to remain childless compared to nonsmoking women.\nResearch.\nResearch and studies on tobacco's effects on the population's health were more advanced in Germany than in any other nation by the time the Nazis came to power. The link between lung cancer and tobacco was first proved in Nazi Germany, contrary to the popular belief that American and British scientists first discovered it in the 1950s. The term \"passive smoking\" (\"Passivrauchen\") was coined in Nazi Germany. Research projects funded by the Nazis revealed many disastrous effects of smoking on health. Nazi Germany supported epidemiological research on the harmful effects of tobacco use. Hitler personally gave financial support to the \"Wissenschaftliches Institut zur Erforschung der Tabakgefahren\" (Scientific Institute for the Study of Tobacco Hazards) at the University of Jena, headed by Karl Astel. Established in 1941, it was the most significant anti-tobacco institute in Nazi Germany.\nFranz H. M\u00fcller in 1939 and E. Schairer in 1943 first used case-control epidemiological methods to study lung cancer among smokers. In 1939, M\u00fcller published a study report in a reputed cancer journal in Germany claiming that prevalence of lung cancer was higher among smokers. M\u00fcller, described as the \"forgotten father of experimental epidemiology\", was a member of the National Socialist Motor Corps (NSKK) and the National Socialist German Workers\u2019 Party (NSDAP). M\u00fcller's 1939 medical dissertation was the world's first controlled epidemiological study of the relationship between tobacco and lung cancer. Apart from mentioning the increasing incidents of lung cancer and many of the causes behind it such as dust, exhaust gas from cars, tuberculosis, X-ray and pollutants emitted from factories, M\u00fcller's paper pointed out that \"the significance of tobacco smoke has been pushed more and more into the foreground\".\nPhysicians in the Third Reich were aware that smoking is responsible for cardiac diseases, which were considered to be the most serious diseases resulting from smoking. The use of nicotine was sometimes considered to be responsible for increased reports of myocardial infarction in the country. In the later years of World War II, researchers considered nicotine a factor behind the coronary heart failures suffered by a significant number of military personnel in the Eastern Front. A pathologist of the Heer examined thirty-two young soldiers who had died from myocardial infarction at the front, and documented in a 1944 report that all of them were \"enthusiastic smokers\". He cited the opinion of pathologist Franz Buchner that cigarettes are \"a coronary poison of the first order.\"\nAnti-tobacco measures.\nThe Nazis used several public relations tactics to convince the general population of Germany not to smoke. Well-known health magazines like the \"Gesundes Volk\" (Healthy People), \"Volksgesundheit\" (People's Health) and \"Gesundes Leben\" (Healthy Life) published warnings about the health consequences of smoking and posters showing the harmful effects of tobacco were displayed. Anti-smoking messages were sent to the people in their workplaces, often with the help of the Hitler-Jugend (HJ) and the Bund Deutscher M\u00e4del (BDM). The anti-smoking campaign undertaken by the Nazis also included health education. In June 1939, a Bureau against the Hazards of Alcohol and Tobacco was formed and the \"Reichsstelle f\u00fcr Rauschgiftbek\u00e4mpfung\" (Bureau for the Struggle against Addictive Drugs) also helped in the anti-tobacco campaign. Articles advocating nonsmoking were published in the magazines \"Die Genussgifte\" (The Drugs for Enjoyment), \"Auf der Wacht\" (On the Guard) and \"Reine Luft\" (Clean Air). Out of these magazines, \"Reine Luft\" was the main journal of the Nazi anti-tobacco movement.\nAfter recognizing the harmful effects of smoking on health, several items of anti-smoking legislation were enacted. The later 1930s increasingly saw anti-tobacco laws implemented by the Nazis. In 1938, the Luftwaffe and the Reichspost imposed a ban on smoking. Smoking was also banned not only in health care institutions but also in several public offices and in rest homes. Midwives were restricted from smoking while on duty. In 1939, the Nazi Party outlawed smoking in all of its offices' premises, and Heinrich Himmler, the then chief of the Schutzstaffel (SS), restricted police personnel and SS officers from smoking while they were on duty. Smoking was also outlawed in schools.\nIn 1941, tobacco smoking in trams was outlawed in sixty German cities. Smoking was also outlawed in bomb shelters; however, some shelters had separate rooms for smoking. Special care was taken to prevent women from smoking. The President of the Medical Association in Germany announced, \"German women don't smoke\". Pregnant women and women below the age of 25 and over the age of 55 were not given tobacco ration cards during World War II. Restrictions on selling tobacco products to women were imposed on the hospitality and food retailing industry. Anti-tobacco films aimed at women were publicly aired. Editorials discussing the issue of smoking and its effects were published in newspapers. Strict measures were taken in this regard and a district department of the National Socialist Factory Cell Organization (NSBO) announced that it would expel female members who smoked publicly. The next step in the anti-tobacco campaign came in July 1943, when public smoking for persons under the age of 18 was outlawed. In the next year, smoking in buses and city trains was made illegal, on the personal initiative of Hitler, who feared female ticket takers might be the victims of passive smoking.\nRestrictions were imposed on the advertisement of tobacco products, enacted on December 7, 1941, and signed by Heinrich Hunke, the President of the Advertising Council. Advertisements trying to depict smoking as harmless or as an expression of masculinity were banned. Ridiculing anti-tobacco activists was also outlawed, as was the use of advertising posters along rail tracks, in rural regions, stadiums, and racing tracks. Advertising by loudspeakers and mail was also prohibited.\nRestrictions on smoking were also introduced in the Wehrmacht. Cigarette rations in the military were limited to six per soldier per day. Extra cigarettes were often sold to the soldiers, especially when there was no military advance or retreat in the battleground, however, these were restricted to 50 for each person per month. Access to cigarettes was not allowed for the Wehrmacht's female auxiliary personnel. Medical lectures were arranged to persuade military personnel to quit smoking. An ordinance enacted on November 3, 1941, raised tobacco taxes by approximately 80\u201395% of the retail price. It would be the highest rise in tobacco taxes in Germany for more than 25 years after the collapse of the Nazi regime.\nEffectiveness.\nThe early anti-smoking campaign was thought to be a failure, and from 1933 to 1937 there was a rapid increase in tobacco consumption in Germany. The rate of smoking in the nation increased faster even than in neighboring France, where the anti-tobacco movement was tiny and far less influential. Between 1932 and 1939, per capita cigarette consumption in Germany increased from 570 to 900 per year, while the corresponding numbers for France were from 570 to 630.\nThe cigarette manufacturing companies in Germany made several attempts to weaken the anti-tobacco campaign. They made new journals and tried to show the anti-tobacco movement as \"fanatic\" and \"unscientific\". The tobacco industry also tried to counter the government campaign to prevent women from smoking and used smoking models in their advertisements. Despite government regulations, many women in Germany regularly smoked, including the wives of many high-ranking Nazi officials. For instance, Magda Goebbels smoked even while she was interviewed by a journalist. Fashion illustrations displaying women with cigarettes were often published in prominent publications such as the \"Beyers Mode f\u00fcr Alle\" (Beyers Fashion For All). The cover of the popular song \"Lili Marleen\" featured singer Lale Andersen holding a cigarette.\nThe Nazis implemented more anti-tobacco policies at the end of the 1930s and by the early years of World War II, the rate of tobacco usage declined. As a result of the anti-tobacco measures implemented in the Wehrmacht, the total tobacco consumption by soldiers decreased between 1939 and 1945. According to a survey conducted in 1944, the number of smokers increased in the Wehrmacht, but average tobacco consumption per military personnel declined by 23.4% compared to the immediate pre-World War II years. The number of people who smoked 30 or more cigarettes per day declined from 4.4% to 0.3%.\nThe Nazi anti-tobacco policies were not exempt of contradictions. For example, the \"Volksgesundheit\" (People's Health) and \"Gesundheitspflicht\" (Duty to be Healthy) policies were enforced in parallel with the active distribution of cigarettes to people who the Nazis saw \"deserving\" groups (e.g. frontline soldiers, members of the Hitler Youth). \"Undeserving\" and stigmatized groups (Jews, war prisoners), however, were denied access to tobacco.\nAssociation with antisemitism and racism.\nApart from public health concerns, the Nazis were heavily influenced by ideology; specifically, the movement was influenced by concepts of racial hygiene and bodily purity. Nazi leaders believed that it was wrong for the master race to smoke and that tobacco consumption was equal to \"racial degeneracy\". The Nazis viewed tobacco as a \"genetic poison\". Racial hygienists opposed tobacco use, fearing that it would \"corrupt\" the \"German germ plasm\". Nazi anti-tobacco activists often tried to depict tobacco as a \"vice\" of the \"degenerate\" Africans.\nthe Nazis claimed that the Jews were responsible for introducing tobacco and its harmful effects. The Seventh-day Adventist Church in Germany announced that smoking was an unhealthy vice spread by the Jews. Johann von Leers, editor of the \"Nordische Welt\" (Nordic World), during the opening ceremony of the \"Wissenschaftliches Institut zur Erforschung der Tabakgefahren\" in 1941, proclaimed that \"Jewish capitalism\" was responsible for the spread of tobacco use across Europe. He said that the first tobacco on German soil was brought by the Jews and that they controlled the tobacco industry in Amsterdam, the principal European entry point of \"Nicotiana\".\nAfter World War II.\nAfter the collapse of Nazi Germany at the end of World War II, American cigarette manufacturers quickly entered the German market. Illegal smuggling of tobacco became prevalent, and leaders of the Nazi anti-smoking campaign were silenced. In 1949, approximately 400\u00a0 million cigarettes manufactured in the United States entered Germany illegally every month. In 1954, nearly two billion Swiss cigarettes were smuggled into Germany and Italy. As part of the Marshall Plan, the United States sent free tobacco to Germany; the amount of tobacco shipped into Germany in 1948 was 24,000 tons and was as high as 69,000\u00a0 tons in 1949. The Federal government of the United States spent $70\u00a0 million on this scheme, to the delight of cigarette manufacturing companies in the United States, who profited hugely. Per capita yearly cigarette consumption post-war Germany steadily rose from 460 in 1950 to 1,523 in 1963. The present-day anti-tobacco campaign in Germany has been unable to exceed the seriousness of the Nazi-era climax in the years 1939\u201341 and German tobacco health research at the end of the 20th century is described by Robert N. Proctor as \"muted\"."}

There are many differences between a pioneer movement, and the scout movement. Scout movements are independent of governments. They are also not controlled by the state. For example, there were no separate organizations for boys and girls. During the time of the USSR, thousands of Young Pioneer camps and Young Pioneer Palaces were built. These could only be used by Young Pioneers. The camps and palaces were also free of charge, it did not cost any money to use them. The government and trade unions sponsored them. There were many newspapers and magazines published for Young Pioneers. Some sold millions of copies.\nCertain features, however, are similar to the Scout movement. The two movements share some principles like preparedness and promotion of sports and outdoor skills. The pioneer movement also includes teaching of communist principles. Opponents of Communist states claim that this is a form of indoctrination.\nA member of the movement is known as a pioneer, and a scarf \u2013 typically red, but sometimes light blue \u2013 is the traditional item of clothing worn by a pioneer. The pioneer organization is often named after a famous party member that is considered a suitable role model for young communists. \nIn the USSR it was Lenin; in East Germany, it was Ernst Th\u00e4lmann.

He later became an important politician in Victoria.\nLalor was born at Tenakill, Queens County, Ireland into a large family, active in Irish politics. His father Patrick, represented Queens County in the House of Commons. Peter was educated in Dublin and became a civil engineer. With political unrest in Ireland, and the chance of getting rich in on the Australian goldfields, he left Ireland with his brother, Richard, and went to Victoria, Australia, in 1852. They worked on building the railway between Melbourne and Geelong. In 1853 Peter went to the Ovens River looking for gold, and Richard went back to Ireland where he later became a member of parliament. Peter Lalor went into business selling wine and tobacco in Melbourne, but decided to go to Ballarat to look for gold in 1854. He set up camp on the Eureka Lead, at East Ballarat, which was settled by many miners from Ireland.\nEureka Stockade.\nIn 1854 the miners were working in the goldfields (the area where gold was being found) became very angry about the cost of a gold mining license. In Ballarat the miners started the Ballarat Reform League and demanded changes to the laws. Lalor was the chairman of the Reform League. After on particularly brutal hunt for licenses on November 30, 1854, the miners met together at Bakery Hill to demand the League do something to protect them from the police violence. None of the usual speakers were at the meeting, so Lalor stepped forward and gave a rousing speech. The rebel miners flew their new Eureka Flag.\nHe made the miners promise to protect each other, and their rights and liberties. He told the miners to get weapons and be ready in case they were attacked by the police and government troops. Lalor became the new leader of the League. They built a small fort, or stockade, at Eureka in east Ballarat. This fort, the Eureka Stockade was attacked by 275 government soldiers at 3:00am on December 3, 1854. Twenty-two miners were killed, and Lalor was badly hurt. Friends hid him from the soldiers and he was able to get away. His left arm had to be amputated.\nPolitics.\nAfter Eureka, Lalor was hidden in Geelong until the police and eager bounty hunters concluded looking for him. The government changed the laws, and miners on the goldfields were able to elect people to Parliament. Lalor was elected in November 1855. As part of the democratic changes, Victoria got a constitution in 1856 and Lalor was elected to the new Parliament. His political views were not as democratic as the Ballarat miners wanted. He was against giving every one the right to vote and he wanted some people in the parliament to be appointed, not elected. Lalor became a the person in charge of several mining companies. He even supported wage cuts for miners working in his mines. He was seen as more interested in money and power than in people's rights. In 1859 he changed his seat in parliament to another area, and did not represent the Ballarat miners again.\nIn January 1871 Lalor lost his seat in an election. He was made Chairman of the Clunes Water Commission with the job of getting water for the town of Clunes. He was voted back into parliament again in 1874. In 1875 he became Postmaster General (in charge of the postal service) and later Commissioner for Trade and Customs. From 1880 to 1887 he was Speaker of the Legislative Assembly. Lalor's wife and daughter died in 1887, he was also sick with diabetes, so he stopped being Speaker, but stayed as representative for South Grant until his death.\nAfter his death, Peter Lalor is remembered with a statue in Ballarat (at the corner of Sturt and Dawson Streets), a suburb of Melbourne is named after him, and there is also a division, Lalor, of the Australian Parliament named after him."}

It is one of the most developed states in Malaysia. The capital city and royal seat of Johor is Johor Bahru, once known as Tanjung Puteri. The old state capital is Johor Lama. The Arabic honorific of the state is Darul Ta'zim (\"Abode of Dignity'). Johor is surrounded by Pahang to the north, Melaka and Negeri Sembilan to the northwest, and the Straits of Johor to the south which is divided by the international border between Malaysia and the Republic of Singapore. Tanjung Piai, in the district of Pontian, is the most southerly point of mainland Asia.\nHistory.\nThe name \"Johor\" came from the Arabic word \"Jauhar\", 'gem/precious stone' . Before the name Johor was taken up, the area south of the Muar River to Singapore island was known as \"Ujung Tanah\" or 'land's end' in Malay, due to its location at the end of the Malay Peninsula. Coincidentally, Johor is the most southerly point of the Asian continental mainland.\nTransportation centres.\nPorts.\nJohor has three ports: Pasir Gudang Port, Port of Tanjung Pelepas and Tanjung Langsat Port.\nAirports.\nJohor has one international airport, the Senai International Airport in Senai. It was opened on 6 June 1974 and has been expanded several times ever since. Currently, it has a 5 million passenger capacity with parallel taxiway under construction.\nThe airport is also a regional hub of AirAsia, a regional low-cost no-frills airline. Malaysia Airlines also operate flights from Senai airport to some local and international destinations.\nGovernment structure of Johor.\nMonarchy.\nJohor is a constitutional monarchy. It was the first state in Malaysia which adopted the constitutional monarchy system, and its laws are stated in \"Undang-undang Tubuh Negeri Johor\" (Johor State Establishment Constitution), written by Sultan Abu Bakar. The constitutional head of Johor is the Sultan. This position can only be passed down and held by a member of the Johor Royal Family, who is descended from Sultan Abu Bakar. The State's Sultan since 1981 has been Sultan Iskandar Al-Haj.\nJohor was the first state and currently the only state in Malaysia that has its own military force called Johor Military Force or 'Timbalan Setia Negeri'. It is a private army of the Sultan of Johor paid by the state government.\nState government.\nThe state government is led by the Chief Minister or Menteri Besar. The current Chief Minister is Dato' Abdul Ghani Othman, a former civil servant. The Chief Minister is assisted by an executive council (exco), whose members are selected from the state assembly members.\nThe legislative branch of Johor's government is the Johor State Assembly. The state assembly makes laws in matters on the state. Members of the assembly are elected every five years in an election.\nPlaces of interest.\nMajor tourist attractions.\nAmong the popular tourist destinations in Johor are:\nNational parks and forest reserves.\nJohor is also known for its national parks. Johor currently has five national parks, with a combined area of more than 700\u00a0km\u00b2 and several smaller recreational forest. Almost all recreational parks are based around a mountain. Johor also has the third largest mangrove forest reserve in Peninsular Malaysia (167\u00a0km\u00b2).\nGeography.\nPhysical.\nIn the official census of 2010, the population of Johor was 3.35 million people with 48% Malays, 40% Chinese, 8% Indians and 4% others. It is the fifth largest state (18,984\u00a0km\u00b2) of Malaysia. It is the southernmost state in Peninsular Malaysia being South of Melaka, Negeri Sembilan and Pahang and North of Straits of Johor. The highest point in Johor is Gunung (mountain) Ledang (1276 m). Gunung Ledang is also known as Mount Ophir. Johor is the only state in Malaysia which has a 400\u00a0km beach stretching on both the East and the West coast.\nJohor has 8 large islands with numerous smaller ones.\nWeather.\nJohor experiences wet equatorial weather with monsoon rain from Nov until Feb blowing from the South China Sea. Average annual rainfall is 1778\u00a0mm with average temperature of between 25.5\u00a0\u00b0C (78\u00a0\u00b0F) and 27.8\u00a0\u00b0C (82\u00a0\u00b0F). Humidity is between 82 and 86%.\nHundred Year Peak Rain Fall.\nOn 19 December 2006, continuously heavy downpour occurred in Johor. Many towns such as Muar, Kota Tinggi and Segamat were seriously flooded with water levels as high as above ground level recorded in some areas. 15 lives were lost and many possessions were destroyed and this resulted in huge financial losses in Johor. More than 100,000 victims were evacuated to flood relief centres.\nLinks to Singapore.\nJohor is connected to Singapore by two roads: the Johor-Singapore Causeway and the Malaysia-Singapore Second Link.\nThe Johor-Singapore Causeway (length: 1038\u00a0m) was designed by Messrs Coode, Fizmaurice, Wilson and Mitchell of Westminster, while the construction contract was awarded to Topham, Jones &amp; Railton Ltd of London. It started in 1909 as a railway link by Johor State Railway to connect Johor Bahru to Singapore, then the administrative headquarters of British interests in South-East Asia. Construction of the road section started in 1919 and was completed in 1923."}

It is named after the first few words, \"Te Deum laudamus\" (We praise thee, O Lord). It was probably written around the 4th or 5th century. Most say that either Augustine of Hippo or Ambrose wrote it. Some say it was by Nicetas, bishop of Remesiana. Others have said that the hymn was taken from two (or more) earlier hymns: one to God the Father and another to God the Son. After this idea, the second hymn begins with the phrase \"Tu rex gloriae, Christe\". The petitions at the end of the hymn (beginning \"Salvum fac populum tuum\") are from verses from the book of Psalms, added to the original hymn later on.\nTe Deum is close in theology to the Apostles' Creed. It has both a poetic view of the heavenly liturgy with a declaration of faith.\n\"God\" is named from the start of the song. The hymn then names all people who praise and respect God, from the hierarchy of heavenly creatures, to Christians who are already in heaven, to the Church in all the world.\nTe Deum then returns to its creedal formula, singing about Christ and remembering His birth, suffering, and glorification.\nThen the hymn stops singing about praise, both the Church in general and the singer himself, and asks for mercy on past sins, protection from future sin, and the hope to be reunited with Christians in Heaven.\nMusic.\nMany people have written music for the text, including Anton Bruckner, Giuseppe Verdi, Hector Berlioz, Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, Joseph Haydn, Benjamin Britten, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, just naming a few. Antonio Vivaldi wrote a setting of the Te Deum (RV 622), but it is now lost. The prelude to Charpentier's setting (H.146 in Hugh Wiley Hitchcock's catalogue) is well known in Europe because it is used as the theme music for the European Broadcasting Union, most notably the Eurovision Song Contest. Sir William Walton's Coronation Te Deum was written for the coronation of HM Queen Elizabeth II in 1952. Other English Te Deums have been written, such as the ones by William Byrd, Thomas Tallis, Henry Purcell, three by George Frideric Handel (Utrecht Te Deum, Dettingen Te Deum and Queen's Te Deum) and that of Edward Elgar, his Op. 34. A version by Father Michael Keating is popular with Charismatics. Mark Hayes recently wrote his own version of Te Deum, and British composer John Rutter has composed two, one of them is just titled the traditional \"Te Deum,\" the other \"Winchester Te Deum.\" Igor Stravinsky set the first 12 lines of the text as part of \"The Flood\" in 1962."}

His parents were William Hunter and Helen Drummond. He lived for a while with his uncle at Lyn, Norfolk. He studied music with composer Dr. Charles Burney. He started studying at the University of Aberdeen so that he could become a minister in the Church of Scotland. In 1754 he decided to become a sailor and started as the captain's servant in \"HMS Grampus\". The \"Grampus\" was a 14 gun sloop.\nSailor.\nBy 1755 he was an able seaman in the \"HMS Centaur\", the next year a midshipman on the \"HMS Union\" and the \"HMS Neptune\". These were the flagships of Admiral Charles Knowles. In 1757 Hunter took part in an attack on Rochefort. In 1757 he was involved in the attack on Quebec. Hunter passed his exams in navigation and astronomy in 1760 and qualified to be a lieutenant. It took until 1780 to get a job as lieutenant.\nHunter was a midshipman with Admiral Durrell on his flagships, the \"HMS Royal Ann\", \"HMS Princess Amelia\" and the \"HMS Royal George\". Durell made Hunter the master's mate in his new ship, the \"HMS Launceston\". He served in North America and by 1768 was the ship's master. He served on the \"HMS Carysfort\" at Jamaica from 1769 to 1771. He went to the East Indies on the \"Intrepid\" from 1772 to 1774. He then served in the \"Kent\" and the \"Foudroyant\". He returned to North America and was on the \"HMS Eagle\" with Admiral Lord Howe. With Howe's help and support, Hunter was finally made a lieutenant, 20 years after he passed his exams. Officer jobs were hard to get; there were more officers on shore on half pay than there were serving on ships.\nJohn Hunter became lieutenant on the \"HMS Berwick\" and then on the \"HMS Victory\". He was made captain of the fireship \"HMS Spitfire\", and in November 1782, the sloop \"HMS Marquis de Seignelay\".\nThe First Fleet.\nHunter was made the second Captain of \"HMS Sirius (1786)\", which was to escort the First Fleet taking convicts to settle in Australia. Governor Arthur Phillip was the first captain, but he was also responsible for all the ships. Hunter's job was to be in charge of the \"Sirius\". Hunter was also to become the Governor of Australia if any thing should have happened to Phillip. After the settlement was set up, Hunter was to return to England in the Sirius. After the fleet arrived at Botany Bay, Hunter and Phillip went off to find a better site, and then moved the fleet to Port Jackson.\nEarly days in Sydney.\nHunter was involved in survey work around the new settlement and as a judge in the new criminal court. Both he and the judge advocate, David Collins, found they were unable to work with the Lieutenant Governor, Major Robert Ross. Hunter was an artist, and kept a sketch book with more than 100 paintings of plants, animals, fish and scenes around Sydney."}

They are often used in different ways to talk about things, people, ideas, or actions as being either good or bad. Many questions about the concepts of \"good\" and \"bad\" are studied by philosophers. There are many different beliefs about what is good or bad, or about what the two words really mean. These differences can often be seen in different cultures and religions.\nGood \"for something\" and good \"in itself\".\nIn philosophy, goodness is generally understood in two main kinds: either a thing is good or it is good . For example, eating properly may be good (provable) but eating properly may not be a good (unprovable). This also applies to things that are called bad. The belief that there are such things as good and bad has been a main part of Western philosophy since Plato. However, some philosophers have rejected this belief.\nA relative good is something that is good because people say it is good. An absolute good is something that is good because of something in itself. It is good even if there is no one around to see it. For example, an economist may say that the Mona Lisa is a very valuable economic good because it can be sold for a lot of money. A philosopher may say that the painting is good because of how it is painted. The economist sees relative good, because people may later not want to pay for it. The philosopher sees absolute good, because it will always be painted well.\nGood and evil.\nGood and evil are opposites. \nAnd people have opinions on what things are good and what things are evil. For example someone might think killing someone is evil and another person thinks it's good (it is evil! Do not do it!)."}

It is in the Lorraine Region, in the Moselle department, in north-eastern France. The population as of 2007 is about 996.\nHistory.\nOrigin of the name.\nThe first mention of the village is under the name \"Cantevanne\", in a 1239 text. Later it became Kaufen. In 1801, it changed to Kanfen. The name stayed the same when Alsace-Moselle became part of the German Empire in 1870.\nThe most likely etymology is a contraction of the Gaulish word \"canto\" (mountain) and the Germanic radical \"Fenn\" (marshland).\nHistory of the commune.\nKanfen and all of the Thionville region was dependent of the Duchy of Luxembourg. Le Grand Cond\u00e9 took Thionville in 1643. The village became part of the Kingdom of France. This was confirmed by the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659.\nAs it was part of Alsace-Moselle, the commune was part of the German Empire from 1871 to 1918. It was annexed by the Third Reich between 1940 and 1944.\nGeography.\nKanfen is next to the Kudertsberg hill, around 230 metres high. The river Kiesel has its source in the village flows through it.\nThe commune is 12 km north of Thionville and 20\u00a0km south of the city of Luxembourg. It is only a few kilometres away from the border with Luxembourg.\nThe commune regroups Kanfen and Kanfen-sous-Bois."}

He was a member of the Lunar Society (a group of important scientists and businessmen who were friends). Erasmus Darwin looked at how living things evolved (change over a long time). His grandson, Charles Darwin, later wrote a book that explained evolution by natural selection.\nErasmus Darwin House, his home in Lichfield, is now a museum dedicated to Erasmus Darwin and his life's work. A school in nearby Chasetown recently converted to Academy status and is now known as Erasmus Darwin Academy.\nLife.\nEarly life.\nDarwin was born in Elston, near Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire. His father was a lawyer. When Erasmus was a child, he was very interested in nature. He liked clocks and electricity. He understood nature well. He said that people should eat meat during Lent, a Christian time of fasting before Easter when people eat only simple food.\nBecoming a physician.\nHe went to the University of Cambridge, and then studied to be a doctor in Edinburgh. He became a doctor in 1756, and worked in Lichfield in Staffordshire. He worked hard and learned a lot about medicine. Soon, lots of people respected him, and the King, George III asked him to become the Royal Doctor, but Erasmus preferred to stay where he was.\nPersonal life.\nDarwin married twice and had 14 children, including two illegitimate daughters by an employee, and, possibly, at least one further illegitimate daughter. In addition to the five children of his first marriage to Mary Howard (1740\u20131770), and seven to his second wife, Elizabeth Pole, there are two daughters by the governess Mary Parker, and another probable with a married woman, Lucy Smith.\nHis writings.\nBotany.\nDarwin formed the \"Lichfield Botanical Society\" in order to translate the works of the Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus from Latin into English. This took seven years. The result was two publications: \"A System of Vegetables\" between 1783 and 1785, and \"The Families of Plants\" in 1787. In these volumes, Darwin coined many of the English plant names that we use today.\nDarwin then wrote \"The Loves of the Plants,\" a long poem, which was a popular rendering of Linnaeus works. Darwin also wrote \"Economy of Vegetation\", and together the two were published as \"The Botanic Garden\".\nHis last long poem, the \"Temple of Nature\", was published after his death, in 1803. This is considered his best poetic work. It centers on his own newly conceived theory of evolution, tracing traces the progression of life from microorganisms to civilized society.\nZoology.\nDarwin's most important scientific work is \"Zo\u00f6nomia\" (1794\u20131796), which contains a system of pathology, and a treatise on generation, in which he anticipated some of Lamarck's ideas on evolution.\nThe essence of his views is contained in the following passage, which he follows up with the conclusion that one and the same kind of living filament is and has been the cause of all organic life:\nWould it be too bold to imagine that, in the great length of time since the earth began to exist, perhaps millions of ages before the commencement of the history of mankind, would it be too bold to imagine that all warm-blooded animals have arisen from one living filament, which the great First Cause endued (invested) with animality, with the power of acquiring new parts, attended with new propensities, directed by irritations, sensations, volitions and associations, and thus possessing the faculty of continuing to improve by its own inherent activity, and of delivering down these improvements by generation to its posterity, world without end!\nThis is a clear statement of the kind of evolutionary thinking which Lamarck is known for.\nLater works.\nDarwin's idea of evolution surfaced in several of his other works. In the \"Loves of the Plants\" (1789), reprinted in several editions as \"The Botanic Garden\", there occurs the comment: \"Perhaps all the productions of nature are in their progress to greater perfection!\". All these natural history works are in the form of poems, and so they are not satisfactory from the point of view of modern science. But the 18th century was a time when intelligent men made connections; the specialist types of scientist occurred first in the lifetime of his grandson Charles.\nThe last two leaves of Darwin's \"A plan for the conduct of female education in boarding schools\" (1797) contain a book list, an apology for the work, and an advert for \"Miss Parkers School\". The work probably resulted from his liaison with Mary Parker. The school advertised on the last page is the one he set up in Ashbourne, Derbyshire for their two illegitimate children, Susanna and Mary.\nLater life.\nDarwin translated the work of Carolus Linnaeus from Latin to English. The books explain how plants are classified. Darwin was friends with many important scientists and businessmen, in the Lunar Society. Darwin wrote poems against slavery. He was a generous man, he helped people who had no money.\nHe wrote poems explaining his ideas about evolution. He also made many inventions and predicted that electricity and aeroplanes would be useful in the future. He also made a sketch (simple drawing) of a hydrogen-oxygen rocket engine in 1779.\nErasmus Darwin died on 18 April 1802, and is buried in All Saints Church, Breadsall, north of Derby."}

With a population of 2.1 million in 2011. it is the most populous area in Hong Kong. \nGeography and History.\nKowloon is north of Hong Kong Island and south of the mainland part of the New Territories. The size of Kowloon is about 47 km\u00b2 (18 sq mi). In law, Kowloon refers to the area south of Boundary Street and Stonecutters Island, leased to the United Kingdom by the Qing dynasty in 1860. In 1898, the Qing dynasty leased the New Territories to the United Kingdom for 99 years. New Kowloon, the area north of Boundary Street, is officially part of the New Territories. In modern culture, however, New Kowloon is part of Kowloon.\nKowloon was developed largely in the 20th century, after Kowloon Wharf and Kowloon-Canton Railway were built. Airplanes used to fly above Kowloon to and from Kai Tak Airport until 1998, so buildings there are usually lower than the ones on Hong Kong Island because they had height restrictions. The height restrictions were lifted after the opening of the new Hong Kong International Airport in 1998.\nName.\nThe name Kowloon means \"nine dragons\" (\u4e5d \u2013 nine, \u9f8d \u2013 dragon). This refers to eight mountains and a Chinese emperor: Kowloon Peak, Tung Shan, Tate's Cairn, Temple Hill, Unicorn Ridge, Lion Rock, Beacon Hill, Crow's Nest and Emperor Bing (Song Dynasty).\nDemographics.\n2,108,419 people lived in Kowloon in 2011. 94.2% of Kowloon's residents are Chinese.

{"id": "113977", "revid": "373511", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=113977", "title": "Baseball uniform", "text": "A baseball uniform is clothing that baseball players wear during games. Like other uniforms, it identifies the group in which they are members, in this case their baseball team. Most baseball uniforms have the last names and uniform numbers of players who wear them. The names and numbers are usually on the back to identify each player. Baseball shirts, pants, shoes, socks, caps, and helmets are parts of the uniform. Players also wear gloves, but they are not part of the uniform, because players can choose their own gloves. Most uniforms have different logos and colors to show which team it is.\nBaseball uniforms were first worn by the New York Knickerbockers Baseball Club in the 1840s. Their uniforms were pants made of blue wool, white flannel shirts and straw hats. Since then, the uniforms have gone through many changes. More items, ideas, and many other improvements were done and added to these uniforms over the years. Their style also changed, little by little over time.\nHistory.\nCreation.\nOn April 4, 1849, the New York Knickerbockers became the first team to use uniforms. In 1882, different colors that showed the different fielding positions of each player were added on uniforms and stockings (garment covering the foot and lower part of the leg). In 1888 and 1889, the Detroit Wolverines and Washington Nationals of the National League and the Brooklyn Bridegrooms of the American Association added stripes to their uniforms. By 1900, all players in Major League Baseball teams were using uniforms.\nHome and road uniforms.\nBy the end of the 19th century, baseball teams started wearing two different uniforms. They wore one uniform when they played in their own baseball stadium (called \"home games\", \"playing \"at home\") and another when they played at another team's baseball stadium (\"away\" or \"road games\"\", \"playing \"on the road\"\"). It became normal to wear white at home and either gray, solid dark blue, or black colors on the road. In 1907, the Brooklyn Superbas used a blue pattern for their road uniforms. The New York Giants later used a pattern almost the same as to what the Brooklyn Superbas used on their road uniforms.\nIn 1916, on the Giants' uniforms, many purple lines gave them a tartan-like color. At this time, another kind of road uniform was a solid dark blue or black material with white. In 1963, Charles O. Finley changed his Kansas City Athletics home and road uniforms. They were changed to the colors of gold and green. In the 1970s, some teams used light blue for their road uniforms.\nPinstripes and numbers.\nPinstriping (long vertical stripes along uniforms) were created in the 19th century. They were first worn on some major league baseball team's uniforms in 1907. The pinstripes were soon widened in 1912, so that people could see them more easily.\nPinstriping was used again when the Brooklyn Bridegrooms started to wear them in 1907, 1916 and 1917. During that time when the striped uniforms were made again, other things for the baseball uniform were added, such as satin. The team that often wore pinstripes was the New York Yankees. They were first used in 1912. But the Yankees' pinstripes (on their home uniforms) have become a symbol of the Yankees. Because of that, books about the Yankees started to be made with pinstriped covers.\nNumbers were first added to uniforms by the Cleveland Indians in 1916. In 1929, numbers were first added on the backs of baseball uniforms by the New York Yankees and the Cleveland Indians baseball teams. By the 1930s, it was normal for baseball uniforms to have numbers on them. The Yankees were one of the first baseball teams to wear uniform numbers. This was because of their normal position in the New York Yankee's batting order (Babe Ruth 3, Lou Gehrig 4, etc.).\nBy 1932, all major league baseball teams had numbers on their player's baseball uniforms. The numbers were on the backs of the shirts, with the team name or logo on the front. But in 1952, the Brooklyn Dodgers were the first team to put numbers on the fronts of baseball uniforms. As players began to have their own numbers on their uniforms, \"retiring\" a number of special baseball players started to happen. While testing new ideas to add to baseball uniforms, new designs and ideas were created. For example, the Houston Astros of the 1970s and 1980s, added numbers on the fronts of pockets on pants as well as on the back of their shirts.\nPatches.\nShoulder patches on baseball uniforms were worn usually in honor of something. The first patches to be used on major league uniforms were worn by the Chicago White Sox in 1907. The first patch to be worn on all 16 major league uniform sleeves in one year was in 1939. The second time patches were used in all the professional baseball teams, also with the minor leagues, was done in honor of the grand opening of baseball's Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York. The third patch to be worn by all teams, was the rectangular Major League Baseball centennial patch in 1969 in honor of 100 years of professional baseball. Many of the ballpark anniversaries have also inspired special patches to those who have recently died have been using patches rather than the traditional black arm bands (an item a person wears) of earlier decades.\nCap styles.\nFrom the 1840s to the 1870s, baseball players wore many kinds of hats, such as straw hats. Caps, or other kinds of headgear with eye shades that protect a player's eyes from the sun, have been a part of baseball uniforms since they were first created. In 1860, the Brooklyn Excelsiors were the first team to wear what would later become the baseball cap. Before that, teams often wore full-brimmed straw hats or no cap at all since there was no official rule in baseball about whether players had to wear caps or not. By the early 1900s, rounded top parts of a hat became the normal fashion. Other teams would sometimes use the flat-topped cap, such as the Giants in 1916, and the Pittsburgh Pirates in their 1979 World Series championship. Baseball caps have changed very little in recent decades. Over time, a bigger sun visor (the front of caps) has been made. The reason of the cap stays the same: to protect the player's eyes from the sun.\nShoes.\nIn the late 19th century, baseball players started to wear the soft but long-lasting leather shoes. Soon, removable spikes were designed and were used many times until 1976, when they were banned from baseball games. Soon after, white shoes, as well as solid reds and blues, became popular. As artificial turf was used more in baseball fields, changes to shoes were needed.\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, baseball shoes were mostly colored black. The Kansas City Athletics designed new white shoes in the 1960s.\nStockings.\nThe stocking colors of teams were a way of telling one team from another. Stockings in 1900 were made of wool that were high in weight and were made of one-piece at full-length (above the knee). The foot covering part below the ankle bone was colored white or natural wool. It often created the illusion of stirrups. In 1868, the Cincinnati Red Stockings started to play in short trousers so their stockings could be seen. This led to the team's nickname. Teams started to be called the Chicago White Stockings or the St. Louis Brown Stockings because of what colored stockings they wore at the time. Some teams wore \"candy cane\" stockings instead of stripes during the 1920s; these included the Giants, St. Louis Cardinals and Washington Senators.\nGraphics and logos.\nFrom the beginning, graphic designs were used to tell different teams apart. An Old English letter was worn on the fronts of baseball uniforms on the chest. This style is still being used today by the Detroit Tigers and their Gothic style \"D\" on their home uniforms. Road jerseys were able to tell the city the team it is from, as with the Tigers wearing the word \"Detroit\" on their road uniform shirts meaning the team's home city is Detroit, Michigan. Some early examples are a small red tiger on the black cap of the uniforms of the Detroit Tigers in 1901, as they were officially the Tigers from the beginning; and a bear cub logo on the Chicago Cubs' uniforms by 1907, as that unofficial nickname later become the official name of the baseball club. In another famous example, the Boston Americans (an unofficial name that made it easier to tell different teams apart) used the Nationals' red stockings in 1908 since the Nationals did not use them anymore. They have been called the Boston Red Sox ever since.\nBaseball gloves.\nA baseball glove is a leather glove that baseball players wear. They are used to catch a baseball that are hit by a batter or thrown by an outfielder. When baseball gloves were first made, they were not used very much. Many baseball players who first wore baseball gloves or a type of them were often teased and taunted when they were used.\nThe first baseball glove to be worn was by catcher Doug Allison in 1870. Allison's hands were split and cracked open from catching in other games earlier in the week. He decided to wear something that would protect his hands so that they would not be damaged more. He got laughed and mocked at by his teammates because of his glove. In 1875, five years later, first baseman Charlie Waitt wore a glove for protection. His teammates also laughed at him. When baseball star Albert Spalding started to use baseball gloves for protection, more baseball players started to do what he did also because of his fame. Soon, all baseball players started to wear baseball gloves.\nIn 1920, Bill Doak, a pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals, asked that a web be placed between the first finger and the thumb of the glove for more protection. This was because more baseball players started to have more cuts and bruises because baseballs were thrown harder. This design was soon added to baseball gloves, and webbed gloves were starting to be used by all baseball players. In the 1940s, gloves would lace the fingers together for more control using the glove. The most recent idea added to baseball gloves was making the pocket of the glove deeper and finally making small baskets in the glove so that pitchers can hide their pitching grip.\nBaseball helmets.\nBaseball helmets are hard hats that baseball batters wear to protect their heads from a baseball being hit or thrown at them. Roger Bresnahan made the first batting helmet after getting hit in the head one game. Then, more players started wearing helmets. Finally, players had to wear them from the 1970s. Usually, the design is like the regular home cap. The same helmets are used on the road even if the soft road cap is different.\nToday's uniforms.\nBaseball uniforms have changed over time. However, many parts of baseball uniforms from many years ago are still being used today. For example, very few major league baseball players wear matching colored shoes and shoes that are completely black, although they did in the 19th and 20th centuries. Baseball numbers on backs and fronts of uniforms are still on backs and fronts of baseball uniforms today, and have been since 1932.\nOften, a team will have a home uniform, an away uniform, a \"Sunday game\" uniform, uniforms that are worn only during batting practice, and uniforms worn only on special events. Also recently, throwback uniforms have become more popular. Current Major League Baseball uniforms have to follow rules, such as no advertisements on uniforms and that all players must wear their number on the back of the uniform."}

She was very well-known during her lifetime, but her best compositions are not very well known. This is because the way to become a famous composer in France in the 19th century was by writing operas, but Farrenc never wrote operas. Her best compositions are chamber music.\nLife.\nHer name when she was born was Jeanne-Louise Dumont. Her father was a successful sculptor. She was very young when she started to learn the piano. Her teacher had been a pupil of Muzio Clementi. Soon she was having piano lessons with famous teachers such as Ignaz Moscheles and Johann Nepomuk Hummel. She loved composing, so her parents let her study composition with Anton Reicha at the Paris Conservatoire. At that time women were not allowed to go to composition classes at the Conservatoire, so she probably had her lessons privately. She met a flautist (flute player) called Aristide Farrenc. He was ten years older than she was. They often performed together and they married in 1821. She stopped her studies and travelled with her husband around France giving concerts. He soon grew tired of the concert life and decided to open a publishing house in Paris, which was called \u00c9ditions Farrenc. It became one of France\u2019s most important music publishers for nearly 40 years.\nFarrenc returned to her studies with Reicha. Then she started giving many concerts and became famous. She was so successful that in 1842 she was made Professor of Piano at the Paris Conservatoire. She stayed in that job for 30 years. Although it was a very good job she was paid less than the male teachers. When her nonet was performed it made her famous. Joseph Joachim was one of the performers. After this success she was paid the same salary as the male professors. Several other chamber works were very successful, but after her death people forgot about them.\nMusic.\nAt first, during the 1820s and 1830s, she just wrote for piano. Several music critics, including Schumann, thought they were very good. In the 1830s, she wrote chamber music and orchestral music. Her chamber music includes most of her best compositions."}

The reforms focused on restoring the traditional life in the monasteries. Monasteries should encourage the production of artworks. They should also care for the poor. \nThe reform is named after the Abbey of Cluny in Burgundy. It started in the Benedictine order there. The reform was largely carried out by Saint Odo. It spread through France (Burgundy, Provence, Auvergne, Poitou), England and much of Italy and Spain. \nThe reform was stated, because there was corruption in the Benedictine order. People thought this corruption came because people that were not priests and that came from outside the monasteries interfered with them. A Benetictine monastery needed land. This land was given by a Feudal lord. By giving the land, the lord would become the patron of the monastery. However, he would often demand the right to interfere in the business of the monastery. The Cluny reform was an attempt to change this practice. A more independent abbot would have better success at enforcing the Rule of the order, it was thought. William of Aquitaine formed the first Cluny monastery in 910 with the novel stipulation that the monastery would report directly to the pope rather than to a local lord. This meant essentially that the monastery would be independent, since the pope's authority was largely theoretical at that distance. \nDuring its height (about 950\u2013c.1130) the Cluniac movement was one of the largest religious forces in Europe. Among the most notable reform supporters were Pope Urban II, Lambert of Hersfeld and Abbot Richard of Saint Vannes at Verdun. The Cluniacs were supporters of the Peace of God concept, as well as pilgrimages to the Holy Lands.\nReferences.\nSouthern, R.W., \"Western Society and the Church in the Middle Ages\", London: Penguin Books, 1970."}

In living things, ageing includes most physical and psychological changes which happen after adulthood.\nSenescence is the biological process which leads to ageing. There have been many attempts to answer the question: why do animals (especially humans) age?\nIn one way, ageing begins at birth, because cell division and growth is fastest then, and gradually slows down as time goes on.\nIn another way, ageing starts when the likelihood of death increases. Actuarial tables show the likelihood of death at each stage of life. These tables are used by insurance companies to assess the rates of insurance on life policies and pensions. It turns out that we are least likely to die when we are young adults. For girls this is as early as 14. The reason suggested by biologists (such as Peter Medawar and George C. Williams) is that this is the time most significant for reproduction, or was in mankind's past. The assumption is that the peak age of reproduction in mankind's history was lower than today. A gene can be expressed at various stages of life. Any allele of a gene which interfered with reproduction would have less chance of passing on to the next generation. The number of such genes in the population would automatically be reduced. Thus natural selection would virtually eliminate any inherited effect which reduced fertility.\nHowever, later in life, inherited defects would have little or no effect on the population as a whole. In fact, during life our cells collect damage to their DNA which is random, but causes us to become gradually less fit as we age. And we have some cell types which never, or rarely, divide during adult life. Muscle cells and most neurons never divide in adult life. Obviously, they collect damage, and not just to the DNA. Also, we inherit various genetic conditions which have effect later in life, like Huntington's chorea. The twin effects of delayed heredity and buildup of damage is what makes us age. Protists do not age: they divide, and the next generation is just as good as the last. Why do even our dividing cells collect damage? The answer to that question is not known, but may be connected to a a cell division phenomenon."}

But there are people of many other religions living in Pakistan.\nChristianity.\nChristians are the largest minority group in Pakistan. They live all over the country. Pakistani Christians belong to many ethnic groups and speak many languages. There are many different churches, and many different types of churches, in most cities in Pakistan. \nAlthough Pakistani Christians do not only do one type of job, they have often done a lot of work in areas like health care, education, railways and the police force. They are also starting to do a lot of work in the civil and defence services.\nHinduism.\nHindus are the second biggest minority in Pakistan. \nThese are people (and children of people) who followed the Hindu religion during the days when Pakistan and India were together. In those days, they were part of the lowest caste. They were called \"untouchable,\" and had to do work that no one else would do.\nIn a \"caste system,\" there are different groups of people who are thought of as more or less important than each other. People would become a member of their caste when they were born, because their parents were part of that group. The lowest caste was thought of as the least important of all.\nIn Pakistan today, the law says that people are not allowed to treat this group badly. But people still do treat them badly, and make them do jobs that do not pay much money. Now some of these low-caste people are going to school and getting better jobs. \nThe Hindus of Pakistan are mostly found in Sindh, where they do a lot of farming. In the larger cities (like the city of Karachi), Hindus do a lot of buying and selling. They celebrate the Hindu holy days with all their traditional colour.\nAhmadiyya.\nThe Ahmadis follow the things Mirza Ghulam Ahmad taught at the end of the 1800s. Their doctrine (religious beliefs) is very close to Islam on most points. However, the Ahmadis do not believe that Mohammad was God's last Prophet. \nThe Ahmadis do not call themselves non-Muslim. Only in the 1973 Constitution of Pakistan written by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto after the secession of East Pakistan they were declared non-Muslim. \nAhmadis are mainly of Punjabi origin (from the Punjab area of India and Pakistan). They do all kinds of Humanitarian work not only in Pakistan, but all over the world. \nZoroastrianism.\nThe Parsis or (Zoroastrians) are a very small minority who live mostly in Pakistan's larger cities. Almost all of them work in business. Some of Pakistan's most successful shipping businessmen are Parsis. The richer members of this community are well-known for their philanthropic activities (giving money to people or organizations, with the goal of helping them or doing good).\nBuddhism.\nThere are very few Buddhists in Pakistan. However, their ancestors' culture made a difference in Pakistan. Many ancient Buddhist temples, schools, and cities have been found by archaeologists in Pakistan."}

His daughter Olga had died shortly before he began to compose it. He had also just finished his opera \"Jen\u016ffa\" which has a tragic ending for the young girl in the story.\nThe young lady who wrote the libretto (words) for Jan\u00e1\u010dek had been one of his daughter\u2019s close friends. She wrote using the name T\u00e1lsk\u00e1. Jan\u00e1\u010dek thought the opera had autobiographical ideas. He also wanted a change from writing about simple, country people as he had done in \"Jen\u016ffa\", so the people in the story of \"Fate\" belong to the upper classes, the rich people of society.\nThe story of the opera is quite strange and unbelievable. It has often been criticized for not being logical. The story consists of lots of little scenes which make the story jump about. The language of the libretto is very deliberately old-fashioned. Czech people who have worked with this opera have often felt that this formal language has made it hard for audiences to understand. Some people have felt that when the opera is sung in other languages it is sometimes better because the language sounds more real.\nNevertheless, although the opera has had these criticisms, the music is some of the best music that Jan\u00e1\u010dek wrote.\nStory of the opera.\nThe story takes place at the beginning of the 20th century, which was the time in which Jan\u00e1\u010dek was composing it. \nIn Act I Gentlemen, students and young girls are walking about in a health resort. The men are interested in a girl called M\u00edla. M\u00edla sees a young man called \u017divn\u00fd in the crowd. \u017divn\u00fd is a composer. He and M\u00edla used to be lovers. They had a child. She tells \u017divn\u00fd that it was her mother who made them split up so that she could marry someone rich. Her mother had made her move away from Prague to give birth to the child in the country. The two lovers now want to forget their unhappy past and live together with their little son Doubek.\nAct II takes place several years later. They have been living together happily. M\u00edla\u2019s mother lives with them but has gone mad. While the lovers read the story of an opera which seems to tell of their own lives, the mother screams and \u017divn\u00fd tears up the music of the opera. The mother grabs her daughter and throws herself and M\u00edla down the steep staircase.\nAct III takes place in a music conservatory eleven years later. \u017divn\u00fd\u2019s students, one of whom is their son Doubek, are singing music from an opera that \u017divn\u00fd has composed. \u017divn\u00fd himself is like the hero of his opera. The last part of the opera has not yet been composed. The students act out a scene from Doubek\u2019s childhood and make fun of it. \u017divn\u00fd talks about his opera. A storm comes up and he is killed by lightning. His opera will never be finished. "}
