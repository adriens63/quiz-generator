Selsey is at the southernmost point of the Manhood Peninsula, almost cut off from mainland Sussex by the sea. It is bounded to the west by Bracklesham Bay, to the north by Broad Rife (\"rife\" being the local word for stream or creek), to the east by Pagham Harbour and ends in the south at Selsey Bill. There are significant rock formations beneath the sea off both of its coasts, named the Owers rocks and Mixon rocks. Coastal erosion has been an ever-present problem for Selsey.\nThe B2145 is the only road in and out of the town crossing a bridge over the water inlet at Pagham Harbour at a point known as \"the ferry\". At one time Selsey was inaccessible at flood tide, and a boat was stationed at the ferry to take horses and passengers to and from Sidlesham.\nClimate.\nSelsey's climate is classified as warm and temperate. Although Selsey is the sunniest place in the UK, there is rainfall throughout the year and even the driest month still has rain. Probably the most problematic climatic hazard is wind. The town is in an area where tornadoes and waterspouts are common. A tornado in 1986 damaged 200 houses and cut a swathe 70 metres wide. Another tornado in 1998 left an estimated \u00a310m of destruction and damaged Patrick Moore's observatory.\nThe warmest recorded temperature in Selsey between 1981 and 2010 was 29.0\u00b0C on 10 July 1995 and the coldest was -8.6\u00b0C on 7 February 1991.

Plato believed that behind every single thing in our world there is a form, which is the true eternal essence of that thing. We can explain this view with an example. In the world there are many different horses: big horses and small horses, grey horses and white horses, old horses and young horses and so forth. According to Plato each horse is an imperfect copy of the horse 'form', the one true horse. In other words, they are all imitations of the perfect horse. Plato uses shadows as an analogy: Like a tree forms a shadow, so is the tree itself a shadow of the 'form', the one true tree. The Theory of forms applies not only to physical objects but also to abstract concepts such as beauty, anger, good and evil.\nPlato also explains that it is impossible for us to perceive these forms through our senses, like our sense of hearing or sense of seeing. The only way we can truly understand a form is through the use of logic and mathematics. Through mathematics, we have discovered the form of the triangle: a polygon with 3 sides. However we will never be able to truly see with our eyes such a triangle. Even if we tried to draw it on a whiteboard with a ruler, it's lines will never be perfectly straight and two-dimensional."}

But at a higher level than schools (and in workplaces), even some governments have blocked YouTube access to their country's public, but their reasons can vary. \nIran.\nOn December 3, 2006, the government of Iran blocked YouTube and several other sites to stop movies and music from other countries from being seen.\nTurkey.\nTurkey blocked YouTube on March 6, 2007 for letting videos that were mean or discriminating to Turks and Atat\u00fcrk, who is the founder of modern Turkey, be shown, because of a \"virtual war\" between Greeks, Armenians, Kurds and Turkish people on YouTube, with people from each side posting videos to hurt the other. The video that caused the banning said that Turks and Atat\u00fcrk were 'gay'. The video was first mentioned on Turkish CNN and the Istanbul public prosecutor sued YouTube for being mean to Turkishness. The court suspended access to YouTube while waiting for the removal of the video. The ban was criticized a lot. YouTube lawyers sent proof of removal to court and users could access the website again on March 9 2007.\nThailand.\nDuring the week of March 8, YouTube was blocked in Thailand. Many bloggers (people who have a \"diary\" online) believed the reason YouTube was blocked was because of a video of the former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra's speech on CNN. However, the government did not confirm or give reasons for the ban. YouTube was unblocked on March 10.\nOn the night of April 3, YouTube was again blocked in Thailand. The government said a video on the site was \"insulting\" to King Bhumibol Adulyadej. The Ministry of Information and Communication Technology claimed that it would unblock YouTube in a few days, after websites with references to this video are blocked instead of the entire website. Communications Minister Sitthichai Pookaiyaudom said, \"When they decide to withdraw the clip, we will withdraw the ban.\" Soon after this incident, the internet technology blog Mashable was banned from Thailand over the reporting of the YouTube clips in question.\nBrazilian model lawsuit and banning that came after.\nYouTube is being sued by Brazilian model and MTV VJ Daniela Cicarelli (better known as Ronaldo's ex-fianc\u00e9e) because she says that the site is making available a video made by paparazzi (or celebrity photographer), in which she and her boyfriend are having sex on a Spanish beach. The lawsuit says that YouTube has to be blocked in Brazil until all copies of the video are removed. On Saturday, January 6, 2007, a legal injunction (\"command\") ordered that filters be put in place to prevent users in Brazil from going to the website.\nThe effectiveness of the measure has been questioned, since the video is not available only on YouTube, but rather has become an Internet phenomenon. On Tuesday, January 9, 2007, the same court overturned their earlier decision, ordering the filters to be taken down, even though the footage was still forbidden, but without technical support for its blockage.\nMorocco.\nOn May 25, 2007 the state-owned company Maroc Telecom blocked all access to YouTube. There were no reasons given why YouTube was blocked. But the guesses are that it might have something to do with some pro-separatist group Polisario clips (Polisario is the Western Sahara independence movement) or because of some videos that criticized King Mohammed VI. This block did not concern the other two private internet-providers, Wana and Meditel. YouTube became accessible again on May 30, 2007 after \"Maroc Telecom\" unofficially announced that the denied access to the website was only a \"technical glitch\".\nAustralia.\nIn Australia, some schools, including all secondary schools in Victoria, have YouTube blocked from student access, after fights have been posted on YouTube.\nChina.\nCurrently in China, the government has blocked YouTube. For several years it was unblocked but since the past five years it has been blocked."}

The song was first published in Watts' collection \"The Psalms of David\" in 1719.\nThe version of this hymn heard since 1848 is from an edition by Lowell Mason for \"The National Psalmist\". It was his fourth revision of the tune he named ANTIOCH.\nWords.\nThe text appears thus in \"The Psalms of David : imitated in the Language of the New Testament, and applied to the Christian State and Worship\" (London 1719):\n&lt;poem&gt;\n\"Psalm XCVIII.

That causes violent riots and protests in Paris.\nA street gang made up of Muslim Arab teens hopes to get away from Paris. They need cash, though. The teens: Alex, Tom, Farid, a pregnant woman named Yasmine and her brother Sami perform a robbery during the chaos. Sami is shot. The group splits up. Alex and Yasmine take Sami to a hospital. \nAt the hospital, emergency room staff tell the police about Sami. Sami wants Yasmine to run before the police catch her. Sami's dying wish is he doesn't want Yasmine to have an abortion. Alex and Yasmine run away. Sami dies at the hospital.\nYasmine and Alex are chained in a muddy-floored pig pen. Alex breaks Yasmine's chains and allows her to run away. When the captors find out Yasmine has escaped, the family patriarch, von Geisler, cuts Alex's Achilles tendons. \nBack in the pig pen, von Geisler grants Alex his last wish. Alex is killed. \nA woman named Eva tells Yasmine she (Eva) is obedient. The family promised her that her parents would come back for her someday. Eva and Hans care for rejected children in the mine.\nEva takes Yasmine down to dinner. The family is waiting for her. They find out that Von Geisler is a former and still practicing Nazi.

That was based on 20 reviews.\nJim Ridley from \"The Village Voice\", gave the movie a negative review. He said: \"Give the French a taste of neo-fascism, race riots and paramilitary crackdowns, and they seek solace in the American cinema's current favorite pastime - vigorously art-directed torture porn."}

The process of distributing or making such recordings is called bootlegging. \nRecordings may be copied and traded between fans of an artist without profit. But some bootleggers have sold recordings for profit. They sometimes add professional-quality sound engineering and/or packaging to the raw material.\nBootlegs are usually made of either unreleased studio recordings, live performances or interviews with a level of quality that can't be predicted.\nBootlegging dates back to the 16th and 17th centuries, around the time of William Shakespeare.\nIn the early 20th century, movie soundtracks were often bootlegged. One example was a bootleg of Judy Garland. She performed \"Annie Get Your Gun\". That was before Betty Hutton replaced her early in production. It happened after a full soundtrack had been recorded.\nBootlegging increased between the 1960s and 2000s. One of the most praised bootlegs in the 1980s is Prince's studio album \"The Black Album\". In December 1987, Prince ordered the album taken down because of a few advance copies being used to make bootlegs.\nThe rise in popularity of the video sharing website YouTube caused it to be a major carrier of bootleg recordings. Its owner, Google, believes that under the \"safe harbor\" rule of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), it cannot be held responsible for content. That allows bootleg media to be hosted on it without any fear of a lawsuit. In 2010 Youtube removed a 15-minute limit on videos. That allowed entire concerts to be uploaded by fans and bootleggers."}

It is a sequel to the 1964 award-winning movie \"Mary Poppins\". Like the first movie, it is also based on the book series of the same name by P. L. Travers.\nPlot.\nIn 1935 London, England, Michael Banks lives in his childhood home. He lives with his children Annabel, John and Georgie. His wife Kate died a year ago. For that reason, Ellen and Jane are helping him raise the children. However, Michael has taken out a loan from the Fidelity Fiduciary Bank to cover his expenses. William Weatherall Wilkins sends his partners to warn Michael that his house will be taken from him if he doesn't repay the loan by Friday. Michael and Jane remember their father left them shares in the bank that can cover the loan. They search the house for the certificate proving their ownership of the shares. During the search, Michael finds a kite. But there's no worth in it anymore, so he puts it out to give away.\nWhile out in the park with Annabel and John, Georgie finds the kite and tries flying it. He ends up being pulled into the sky. He then comes down with Mary Poppins. She decides to take care of the three children as their nanny. She starts off by drawing them a bath. The bath leads down to an oceanic world. Mary Poppins denies anything in fantasy happened.\nMichael goes to the bank to see if he can find proof of his shares. Wilkins, though, denies there are any records of them. Right after Michael leaves, Wilkins tears the record from the official book and burns it in the fireplace.\nThat evening, Annabel and John decide to sell their mother's \"priceless\" bowl to pay off the debt. But Georgie tries to stop them. The bowl ends up damaged because of the three fighting over it.\nThe next day, Mary Poppins and the children go and see Topsy so they can get the bowl fixed. But they find out that the bowl isn't worth much. They then head to the bank to give Michael his briefcase. When the children go to Wilkins' office to ask him for help, however, they learn he is planning to take away their house. Georgie interrupts the banker's meeting after seeing parallels between Wilkins, his associates and an animal gang who kidnapped him. When Michael arrives, he doesn't believe the children, and gets angry at them for putting the home and his job at risk. Mary Poppins takes the children home. They are guided by Jack and his fellow lamplighters.\nThe Banks family get ready to move out of their house. But as he looks at his old kite, Michael realizes that Georgie use parts of the shares certificate to cover the kite's holes. Michael and Jane head to the bank. Mary Poppins and the children go with Jack and the lamplighters to Big Ben to \"turn back time\". After scaling the clock tower, Jack and Mary turn Big Ben back five minutes. That gives Michael and Jane enough time to reach the bank. Michael and Jane reach the bank in time, though they're not successful in getting their shares because they do not have the part with the signatures on the certificates. But then, Mr. Dawes Jr. comes and expels Wilkins from the bank for corrupt practices.\nThe next day, the Banks family go to the park. They buy balloons that take them into the air. They're joined by Jack and many others, including Wilkins. But Wilkins' balloon falls to the ground. When they return home, Mary Poppins realizes it is time for her to go. Michael and Jane thank Mary as she flies back into the sky.\nReception.\nBox office.\nAs of December 30, 2018, \"Mary Poppins Returns\" has made $98.9 million in the United States and Canada. It made another $74.4 million in other territories. The total intake across the world was $173.3 million.\nCritical response.\nRotten Tomatoes gives the movie a 78% rating, based on 265 reviews. On the Metacritic, the movie has a 65 out of 100 rating, with 53 critics, meaning \"generally favorable reviews\"."}

Sometimes, a recording on a compact disc (CD) can be considered a hard copy of music, pictures or people talking.\nIn the U.S..\nIn information handling, the U.S. Federal Standard 1037C (Glossary of Telecommunication Terms) defines a \"hard copy\" as a permanent reproduction, or copy, in the form of a physical object, of any media suitable for direct use by a person (in particular paper), of displayed or transmitted data. Examples of hard copy include teleprinter pages, continuous printed tapes, computer printouts, and radio photo prints. On the other hand, physical objects such as magnetic tapes, diskettes, or non-printed punched paper tapes are not defined as hard copy by 1037C.\nA file which can be viewed on a screen without printing it out is known as a \"soft copy\". The U.S. Federal Standard 1037C defines \"soft copy\" as \"a nonpermanent display image, for example, a cathode ray tube display.\"\nOlder meanings.\nThe term \"hard copy\" predates the age of the digital computer. When making printed books and newspapers, hard copy refers to a manuscript or typewritten pages that have been edited and proofread, and is ready for typesetting, or being read on-air in a radio or television broadcast. This traditional meaning has been all but forgotten in the time of the information revolution."}

Constructed a French company known as: \"Compagnie de Chemins de Fer Rosario-Puerto Belgrano\".\nPaso Mayor is located approximately 40 kilometers from Bah\u00eda Blanca and owes its name to a pass through a River called \"Sauce Grande\" which the local people used to cross that River at the time when there was no bridge to cross the river. The station is one of those which were classified as \"Prime stations\" because of their provisions for more services than other stations. For example Paso Mayor provided services including but not limited to : Passengers, Telegraph, Cargo, Livestock... \nOriginally, in this area there was a place combining both store and bar, locally known as \"pulper\u00eda\" which belonged to a man called Laporte. So the place was called \"Pulper\u00eda de Laporte\" meaning \"Store and bar of Laporte\" Because the same place offered Horse services, that is ; travellers could have their tired horses changed for Fresh ones, the same place at times was called \"Posta\" of Paso Mayor. (\"Posta\" is a place where travellers change their tired horses for Fresh ones). This place served as a place for rest and shopping centre for travellers and traders who came to buy Hides and Skins and Liquor (Gin).\nWith the introduction of the Railway line, the \"Posta\" suffered a severe blow as Wagons and Carriages replaced Horses.

In the 19th century, when the measurements, plans and divisions of the area lands began to be made, the people began to call this pass \"Paso del Mayor Iturra\", meaning \" The pass of Mayor Iturra\". Iturra was the Mayor of that area at the time. Iturra used this pass while grazing his cows, and the people while referring to it, they could say \" the pass that Mayor Iturra use\" later became the \"Pass of Mayor Iturra\" and finally shortened to \" Pass of the Mayor\". To present date, that name still exists in the documents of the place. Today, that point of the River acts as the natural limit / boundary of the of two municipalities of Coronel Rosales and Coronel Pringles.\nFrom the history of the place we can mention the \"Posta Paso Mayor\" which was a place where travellers could have their tired horses changed for Fresh ones. This place was owned by one local man called Laporte. He also owned a \"Pulperia\" a kind of supermarket which majored in selling Hides and Skins as well as Liquor. This \"Posta\" and \"Pulperia\" with the arrival of the railroad were greatly affected, since the Wagons and Carriages replaced the Horses. and with transportation made easy, trading of Hides and Skins also moved to another level. The \"Pulperia became a grocery store until it finally closed in the 30's.\nAlthough it is a place where today there are very few inhabitants, once in its golden age, it reached more than 200 inhabitants. currently it does not exceed 20 people (INDEC, 2010).\nEconomy.\nIt is predominantly agricultural being the optimal land for the cultivation of wheat, soy and sorghum in addition to the breeding of cattle and piggery.\nPersonalities.\nBorn on October 2, 1887 between the villages of Las Oscuras and Paso Mayor, Violet Jessop the \"unsinkable\" daughter of Irish parents is part of a group of settlers who founded the \"English Colony of Sauce Grande\" by the year 1868, which at that time belonged to Bah\u00eda Blanca, the place now belongs to the municipality of Coronel Rosales.\nAfter the death of her father in 1903 the whole family decided to go to London (Great Britain) where they could have more luck than they had lived here, in Argentina.\nIn September 1910, she entered as a waitress the prestigious naval company \"White Star Line\" famous for being the owner of the most luxurious transatlantic ships of the time. Two years later she was part of the crew of the largest and most luxurious boat of the time the RMS \"Titanic\", which sank on the first trip. She was among the few survivors.\nWith the outbreak of the Great War, another ship, the transatlantic HMHS \"Britannic\", Sister ship of the \"Titanic\", was put at the service of the British Navy as a hospital ship, Violet Jessop having done a nursing course, board the ship as one of the aid tours, but on November 21, 1916 the ship collided with a German mine and sunk in less than an hour. She was again rescued alive.\nShe was in England when she retired, bought a small farm and was dedicated to raising animals. She always remembered her childhood and the land that saw her born, Argentina, as \"My People\".\nSites of Interest.\nWithin its limits you can find several sites of interest to highlight that make Paso Mayor a place to know and discover."}

It became the capital city of the Nabataean Kingdom. The Nabataeans were nomadic Arabs who used Petra because it was near the spice trade routes.\nThe Nabataean Kingdom became a client state of the Roman Empire in the first century BC. In 106 AD they lost their independence. Petra's importance declined as sea trade routes developed. Also, the 363 earthquake destroyed many structures. \nThe Byzantine Era led to the construction of several Christian churches, but the city continued to decline. By the early Islamic era only a handful of nomads lived in Petra. It stayed unknown to the world until it was rediscovered in 1812 by Johann Ludwig Burckhardt.\nUNESCO Status.\nPetra has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1985. UNESCO has described it as \"one of the most precious cultural properties of man's cultural heritage\". \nPetra is Jordan's most-visited tourist attraction.

The term is popularly denoted to Khas people who follow Hindu Kshatriya tradition in the Indian state of Uttarakhand. It is used very less in Nepal and is replaced by the term Kshetri.\nThey have been connected to the Khasas mentioned in the ancient Hindu literature. Historian Bal Krishna Sharma and Dor Bahadur Bista speculates that the Khas people were of Indo-European origin. Historian Baburam Acharya speculates that Khas are a sub-clan of Ai\u1e0da, an Arya clan originated at Idavritt (modern day Kashmir). Khas were living in the Idavaritt in the 3rd millennium B.C.E. and the original meaning of the term Khas was Raja or Kshatriya (Yoddha). He further speculates that Kashmir has been named from its local residents Khas as Khasmir. In the 2nd millennium B.C.E., one group of Khas migrated towards Iran while the other group migrated east of Sutlej river settling only in the hill regions up to Bheri River. Historian Balkrishna Pokhrel contends that Khas were not the Vedic Aryans but Aryans of latter period like the Gurjara, Darada, Shaka, Pallava and Pisacha. He further asserts that post-Vedic Aryans were akin to Vedic Aryans in terms of language and culture.\nHistory.\nTraditionally, the Khas people were divided into \"Khas Brahmins\" (also called Bahuns in Nepal) and \"Khas Rajputs\" (also called Chhetris in Nepal). In the Kumaon and Garhwal regions of Uttarakhand in India, the Khas Brahmins and Khas Rajputs had a lower social status than the other Brahmins and Rajputs. However, in present-day western Nepal, they had the same status as the other Brahmins and Rajputs, possibly as a result of their political power in the Khasa Malla kingdom. \nKhas Rajputs in Kumaon region of Uttarakhand are historically accepted as army recruits for the hill Rajas. In Uttarakhand, there are two general divisions of Rajputs - Asal Rajput and Khas Rajput. Asal Rajput are the immigrants of the lowlands of India while Khas Rajput are children of the local Khas population."}

Although this is a feature in many languages like Japanese, Arabic, Hawaiian, Classical Latin, and Thai, there are also many languages that do not have this feature. \nAn example of this would be the Japanese words \"chizu\", which has a short vowel (a vowel spoken for a short time), and \"ch\u012bzu\", which has a long vowel (a vowel spoken for a long time). The only difference that can be heard is how long the vowel \"I\" is spoken. The amount of time the vowel is spoken could create two entirely different words. \"Chizu\" means \"map\", while \"ch\u012bzu\" \"cheese\". \nWhen using IPA, the colon (:) is used to show that the vowel before it is a long vowel. For example, \"chizu\" in IPA is written as /t\u0361\u0255iz\u026f/, but \"ch\u012bzu\" is written as /t\u0361\u0255i:z\u026f/.\nWhile Old English had vowel lengthening, most modern dialects of English do not. For example, the words \"God\" and \"good\" used to have the same vowel sound, but the vowel in \"good (\"/go:d/), which was a long vowel, was said longer than it was in \"God\" (\"/\"god\"/)\", which was a short vowel. Although the vowel sounds in Modern English are very different than in Old English, readers can often get an idea of how vowels used to sound like based on an English word's spelling, which often shows words' historical roots rather than their current pronunciation. Long vowels in Old English could be written with a bar on top of the vowel like in \"g\u014dd\" (good)\".\" Later, during the days of Middle English, spellings used to spell long vowels included spelling with two vowels together like in \"book\" or \"break\" and putting a silent \"E\" at the end of the word like in \"hate\". These vowels were all long vowels until the Great Vowel Shift in English, in which the vowel sounds in English changed to sound very differently from before.\nClassical Latin had both vowel and consonant lengthening, and long vowels had a macron, or a straight horizontal line, written above them. In Classical Latin, \"\u0101nus (\"/\u02c8a\u02d0.nus/), \"annus (\"/\u02c8an.nus/), and \"anus\" (/\u02c8a.nus/) were all different words. \"\u0100nus\" means \"buttocks\", \"annus\" means year, and \"anus\" means old woman. Today, none of the Romance languages, the languages that are daughter languages of Latin, can distinguish words by vowel length, though Italian can distinguish words by consonant length: /anno/ \"year\", /ano/ \"anus\". Italian also has vowel lengthening in accented syllables ending in a vowel, but vowel length cannot make the difference between two words as it could in Latin. "}

Since people of different languages or dialects often talk to each other, the way people talk becomes more like the way the others talk. Because of this, it is natural for languages to sound differently overtime. Sometimes it happens slowly, while in other times it happens quickly.\nAn example of a sound change in English is the Great Vowel Shift, when all of the long vowel sounds in Middle English changed into what they are today. This is why the way English is spelled is so differently from how it is spoken. \nSpelling systems that do not change with the sound changes of a language are often more difficult for a learner to learn how to read in that language. These kinds of spellings are called fossilized spellings. These include spelling systems like English, French, Mongolian script, and Thai. All of these spelling systems have changed little for the past few hundred years, even though their spoken languages sound very different from how they used to sound. Spelling systems that change with the sound changes are often easier for a learner to learn how to read. These languages include Japanese, Turkish, and German.\nAnother much smaller sound shift in many dialects of English is the cot-caught merger, where words with lower back vowels like in \"cot\" and \"caught\" sound exactly the same to native speakers of certain English dialects and are spoken without any difference between the two sounds."}
{"id": "675206", "revid": "7751970", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=675206", "title": "Mongolian script", "text": "Mongolian script was the first writing system to be used to write the Mongolian language. It is similar to the Arabic alphabet in that it is a cursive writing system, or a writing system where all the letters in a word always touch each other and change depending on if the letter is at the beginning, middle, or end of a word. It is a vertically written system, meaning that it is written top-to-bottom, and it is the only vertical writing system to be read left-to-right (all other vertical systems, like Chinese and Korean, are left-to-right). It is one of the two writing systems used to write the Mongolian language, alongside Cyrillic, in the independent country of Mongolia (which is sometimes called Outer Mongolia to distinguish it from Inner Mongolia) and the only writing system used to write the language in the Chinese autonomous region of Inner Mongolia. Unlike Arabic, and Old Uyghur, the Traditional Mongolian script and it's variants are an abugida and brahmic script. It is also used to write several other Mongolic and Tungustic languages such as Buryat, Kalmyk, Oirat, Manchu, and Xibe.\nIt is believed that the reason why Mongolian script is vertical is so that it could easily be written on the neck of a horse, which horses were a very important part of Mongolian culture. In the year 1208, Genghis Khan captured a Uighur scribe named Tatar-Tonga and forced him to make the alphabet of his native language, the Old Uyghr alphabet, be used to write the Mongolian language. It did not fit the Mongolian language well, and it was difficult to learn even for native Mongolian speakers.\nIn 1941, a few decades after Mongolia became a communist state, the Cyrillic alphabet replaced Mongolian script likely due to influence from their communist ally, the Soviet Union. After the fall of communism, Mongolia made Mongolian script official alongside Cyrillic to revive Mongolian culture. However, Cyrillic is still more common due to the lack of education in Mongolian writing, the lack of money to support it, and the difficulty of typing Mongolian on a computer. Also, more Mongolians can read Cyrillic than Mongolian script. In Inner Mongolia, on the other hand, most ethnic Mongols do not know Cyrillic and can only read Mongolian in the Mongolian script."}

Manchu uses a version of the Mongolian script that was changed to better suit the language. For the first 200 years, it was the official language in the courts, although commoners still spoke Chinese. However, during the mid-1800s, it became more common for the Manchu nobles to speak Chinese as their first language. As a matter of fact, China's last emperor, Aisin Gioro Puyi, knew very little Manchu and spoke Chinese as his first language. Nonetheless, Manchu was still written alongside Chinese in official documents until the end of Imperial China. Even though China today has 10 million Manchus, only 20 people speak Manchu today. This makes Manchu a critically endangered language. Almost all Manchus today speak Mandarin Chinese as their first language."}

Most Muslim communities in Europe formed recently, but certain areas on the Balkans have a long Muslim history. \nIslam entered southern Europe through the invading \"Moors\" of North Africa in the 8th\u201310th centuries. Many kingdoms and duchies in Spain, Portugal, Southern Italy and Malta have existed for centuries. After a series of conflicts and wars known as the Reconquista, these areas became Christian. Islam expanded into the Caucasus through the Muslim conquest of Persia in the 7th century. The Ottoman Empire expanded into southeastern Europe; it conquered large parts of the Byzantine Empire in the 14th and 15th centuries. Later, the power of the Ottoman empire faded, and it lost most of its territories in Europe. It collapsed in 1922. The countries of the Balkans still have large populations of native Muslims. Many of these Muslims have become secular. \nThe term \"Muslim Europe\" is used for the Muslim-majority countries of Albania, Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Transcontinental countries, such as Turkey, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan have large Muslim populations, as does Russia in the North Caucasus.\nIn the late 20th and early 21st centuries, large numbers of Muslims immigrated to Western Europe. By 2010, an estimated 44 million Muslims were living in Europe (6%), including an estimated 19 million in the EU (3.8%). They are projected to be 8% by 2030. They are often the subject of intense discussion and political controversy created by events such as terrorist attacks, the cartoons affair in Denmark, debates over Islamic dress, and ongoing support for populist right-wing parties that view Muslims as a threat to European culture. Such events have also fueled growing debate regarding the topic of Islamophobia, attitudes toward Muslims and the populist right.\nThe country where most Muslims live in western Europe today is France, where they account for 12.5% of the population. In the European Union, Bulgaria probably has the largest Muslim population, about 15 % of Bulgarians said they were Muslims."}

It took place at a National Basketball Association (NBA) game between the Indiana Pacers and Detroit Pistons on November 19, 2004. It happened at the Palace of Auburn Hills in Auburn Hills, Michigan. The Associated Press called it \"the most infamous brawl in NBA history.\" The media called it \"the worst night in NBA history.\"\nWith 45.9 seconds left in the game, Pistons center Ben Wallace went up for a layup. He was fouled by Pacers small forward Ron Artest. Wallace was mad for being fouled when the game had been already decided. He pushed Artest. A fight took place on the court between several players. When the fight was broken up, a fan threw a drink at Artest while he was lying on the scorer's table. Artest then went after the fan. That caused a massive fight between players and spectators. The fight went from the seats to the court. It lasted several minutes.\nAfter the game, the NBA didn't allow nine NBA players a total of 146 games. That led to $11 million in salaries being lost by the players.\nRon Artest, Jermaine O'Neal, Ben Wallace and Stephen Jackson were taken from NBA basketball playing for a time on November 20, 2004.\nArtest was taken from NBA basketball playing for the rest of the 2004\u201305 season.

This resulted in widespread condemnation, the National Assembly invoking a State of emergency, and nations removing their embassies from Venezuela. With their belief that his election was illegitimate, they claimed that by retaking power, Maduro was converting Venezuela into an illegal \"de facto\" dictatorship.\nJuan Guaid\u00f3, the newly appointed President of the National Assembly of Venezuela, began motions to form a transitional government as soon as he took the National Assembly role on 5 January 2019; whether Maduro took office on the 10th or not, the country would not have a legitimately elected president. On behalf of the National Assembly, he became one of the first to denounce Maduro taking office, saying that the country had fallen into a \"de facto\" dictatorship and had no leader, and that they were in a state of emergency.\nMaduro's government states that the crisis is a \"\"coup d'\u00e9tat\" led by the United States to remove him from power and control the country's oil reserves.\""}

{"id": "675582", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=675582", "title": "Juan Guaid\u00f3", "text": "Juan Gerardo Guaid\u00f3 M\u00e1rquez (born 28 July 1983) is a Venezuelan engineer and politician. He is the President of the National Assembly of Venezuela and was a member of the Popular Will political party. He is a representative for the state of Vargas.\nThe Constitution of Venezuela lets the President of the National Assembly hold the role of Interim President of Venezuela if nobody else can have it. Guaid\u00f3 took oath on 23 January 2019 to be interim president, because people rejected Nicol\u00e1s Maduro as the president. Many countries recognize Guaid\u00f3 as president, but others don't.\nEarly life and education.\nGuaid\u00f3 grew up with a large family, who were middle-class but humble. His parents were an airline pilot and a teacher. One of his grandfathers was a sergeant of the Venezuelan National Guard, the other grandfather was a captain in the Venezuelan Navy.\nHe survived the 1999 Vargas tragedy which left his family temporarily homeless. He earned his high school diploma in 2000. The tragedy may have influenced his political views, he did not think that Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's government helped his family afterwards.\nGuaid\u00f3 has an undergraduate degree in industrial engineering. He was awarded this in 2007 at Andr\u00e9s Bello Catholic University. He has two postgraduate degrees related to business, one from George Washington University in the United States, and the other from the Instituto de Estudios Superiores de Administraci\u00f3n in Caracas.\nHe is married to Fabiana Rosales, a journalist, and they have a daughter named Miranda.\nActivism.\nGuaid\u00f3 was part of a student-led political movement that was set up to protest about an independent television network RCTV not being able to operate any more due to the government. He helped set up the movement when he was 23. This was also the year he graduated from Andr\u00e9s Bello. The group protested other government acts, including the 2007 constitutional referendum, which Ch\u00e1vez lost.\nTwo years later, in 2009, Guaid\u00f3 helped set up a political party, the Popular Will party. He is a member of this party. In 2014, he was the party's national coordinator. CNN says that he was \"mentored for years\" by Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, a more famous member of Popular Will. Guaid\u00f3 and L\u00f3pez talk to each other a lot, even though L\u00f3pez cannot leave his house. Guaid\u00f3 was well known to other people in Popular Will, but was not famous to other people until 2019, when L\u00f3pez said he should be leader of Popular Will.\nVenezuelan National Assembly.\nIn the 2010 Venezuelan parliamentary election, Guaid\u00f3 was elected as a back-up representative. In 2015 he was elected to be the main representative, with 26% of the vote. He represents an area that used to not support his party.\nEven though he wasn't very famous, Guaid\u00f3 stopped eating as a protest so that there would be elections in 2015. In 2017 he took an important communications job in the National Assembly. In 2018, he became the person in charge of the National Assembly, because he was named the head of the biggest alliance in the National Assembly. He helped out by telling stories to people at the University of Arizona, who were looking at the conditions of politicians in Latin America.\nIn the National Assembly, Guaid\u00f3 looked into the staff of Maduro being corrupt, and worked with outside people to take back money that had been stolen from the Venezuelan public. He took part in the 2017 Venezuelan protests. He has a scar on his neck after he was shot with rubber bullets.\nPresident of the National Assembly.\nGuaid\u00f3 was elected President of the National Assembly of Venezuela in December 2018. He was sworn in on 5 January 2019. Relatives of other politicians who have been locked up were invited to the inauguration, where they stood on the balcony behind the banner of Juan Requesens. Guaid\u00f3 is the youngest person to lead the opposition. When he was officially in the job, he said he would stand up to Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, and gave an eight-point action plan to do that. The plan, which the National Assembly agrees with, has three phases and eight key points:\nOn 15 January 2019, the National Assembly made a plan to work with other countries. They asked these other countries to not let Maduro access his money or money that belongs to Venezuela. Guaid\u00f3 wrote an article on 15 January 2019 in \"The Washington Post\". In his article he told people about the problems in Venezuela and how he can fix it. Guaid\u00f3 spoke to the \"Wall Street Journal\" about his methods to lead people, where he says people should be \"holding out a hand\". He said that he would not lock up members of the army who stopped helping Maduro and helped him instead. Other country leaders nearby to Venezuela asked Maduro to not become president again in 2019, wanting a better election.\nDetention and release.\nGuaid\u00f3 was taken to prison for 45 minutes on 13 January 2019 by the Venezuelan secret police. The Lima Group and the person in charge of the Organization of American States (OAS), Luis Almagro, said that Guaid\u00f3 being arrested was wrong. Maduro said the people who locked him up had not been told to do that by anyone official. Twelve of the people who did it were arrested for disobeying orders.\nGuaid\u00f3 said that the soldiers disobeying showed that Maduro was not in control.\nInterim President of Venezuela.\nAssumption of presidential powers and duties.\nArticle 233 of the Constitution of Venezuela says that there are situations when the president of the National Assembly can take the job of president of Venezuela, if there is no other president. Lots of people thought that Maduro had not been elected in a way that paid attention to other rules in the Constitution, and so Guaid\u00f3 could become the president. Guaid\u00f3 agreed on 10 January 2019 and said that he would try to become president. The National Assembly asked for people to protest on 23 January. This is an important day in Venezuela, because it is on this day that they got rid of an old president who was a dictator. Lots of people all over the world protested on the day. Guaid\u00f3 said that he was president. Maduro was not happy about this, blaming it on the United States (U.S.). Maduro said he would not deal with the U.S. The U.S., Canada, and several Latin American countries gave their support to Guaid\u00f3 to be interim president on the same day; Russia, China, Iran, Syria, Cuba and Turkey supported Maduro. On 29 January, the TSJ began investigating Guaid\u00f3, stopping him from having his money or leaving the country.\nDomestic policy.\nHumanitarian.\nThe day after becoming the interim president, Guaid\u00f3 asked for help for the people of Venezuela. The U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave him $20\u00a0million.\nAmnesty Law.\nOn 25 January, Guaid\u00f3 made an Amnesty Law, which the National Assembly agreed with. It would help the National Assembly by supporting military personnel and authorities who help him.\nHe suggested that if Maduro gives up power, he may receive amnesty. In his first weekend as interim president, he held another public assembly, asking supporters to spread the word of the Amnesty Law throughout the country to military, police and other people it may affect.\nFinance and economy.\nGuaid\u00f3 asked the Bank of England and British Prime Minister Theresa May to not give Maduro any of \u00a31.2\u00a0billion of gold that belongs to Venezuela. He asked for them to give access to the gold to the opposition instead. In the same week, the US Treasury made sanctions to prevent US purchases from PDVSA (Venezuela's state-run oil company), and gave Guaid\u00f3 control of some Venezuelan things in the country.\nForeign policy.\nCarlos Vecchio was made the ambassador to the US for Guaid\u00f3's government. Gustavo Tarre Brice\u00f1o was named by Guaid\u00f3 as Venezuela's Permanent Representative to the Organization of American States. The National Assembly approved eleven diplomatic appointments on 29 January, including as ambassador to Colombia and Elisa Trotta Gamus as ambassador to Argentina.\nRecognition.\nIn January 2019 Guaid\u00f3 was recognized as the interim president of Venezuela by many individual nations in the Americas and around the world, and rejected by others, including the Chinese, Turkish, and Russian governments and the pro-Maduro Supreme Tribunal of Justice. The Supreme Tribunal of Justice of Venezuela in exile welcomed him as interim president.\nThe European Union did not say whether they recognized Guaid\u00f3 as president of Venezuela, but did say on 23 January 2019 that it \"fully supports the National Assembly as the democratically elected institution whose powers need to be restored and respected\", adding that \"the civil rights, freedom and safety of all members of the National Assembly, including its President, Juan Guaid\u00f3, need to be observed and fully respected\". On 26 January 2019, Spain, France, Germany and the United Kingdom gave Maduro an eight-day ultimatum, saying they would recognize Juan Guaido as president unless Maduro calls for elections within those eight days.\nThe Organization of American States (OAS) made a decision on 10 January 2019 \"to not recognize the legitimacy of Nicolas Maduro's new term\". Luis Almagro, Secretary General of the OAS, recognized Guaid\u00f3 on 23 January. In a special meeting of the OAS on 24 January, sixteen countries, including the US, recognized Guaid\u00f3 as president, but they did not achieve the majority needed for a resolution.\nPolitical persona and diplomacy.\n\"Time\" magazine described Guaid\u00f3 as charismatic, saying that he had \"unified a divided opposition\". He is known for \"building unity among fellow legislators\", according to a Bloomberg article. Michael Shifter said that he \"has tried to reach out to the military, tried to unify the opposition and tried to reach Chavista folks as well\". Guaid\u00f3 is described by fellow politician Freddy Guevara as humble, sincere, a fighter, and \"eternal optimist\", and David Smolansky says that he \"was incredibly brave [to challenge Maduro]\". Vox interviewed an expert on Venezuelan politics who said that Guaid\u00f3 was \"uncharismatic\", and compared him to former US President Barack Obama, saying they were similar at public addresses. \"The Guardian\" noted that Guaid\u00f3 has adopted the same \"rallying cry\" as Obama's \"Yes we can\": \"S\u00ed, se puede!\". An article in \"The Nation\" calls Guaid\u00f3 a \"second-string politician\" who \"simply declared himself acting president\" in a brazen power grab. \"The Guardian\" reported concerns that Guaid\u00f3 was allied with far-right leaders, Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro and the United States' Donald Trump.\nMedia.\nIn January 2019, within minutes of Venezuela's state-run media posting a video attempting to discredit Guaid\u00f3, the Instagram hashtag #guaidochallenge went viral, trending worldwide."}

This means someone pretends to be nice, but is actually being mean. It can happen when people do what others want to stop direct confrontation, but they do not agree with what is ordered or suggested. A passive-aggressive person tries to hide their anger. For example, \"I would have had a good day if I hadn't been cleaning up someone's mess\". This sounds okay when someone first reads it, but it is actually them being mad at the person who made the mess.\nThis is not a psychological problem. It is just a way of behaving. In the workplace it occurs when people do not want to do what the employer wants them to do. The behaviour was first defined during World War II. Men were not openly defiant. They used \"passive measures, such as pouting, stubbornness, procrastination, inefficiency, and passive obstructionism\" to show their feelings.\nPersonality disorder.\nExtreme cases may become psychiatric problems.

The single specimen was discovered in 2004 near Stonehaven, Aberdeenshire. \nDiscovery and naming.\nThe fossil of \"P. newmani\" was found by Mike Newman. He is a bus driver and amateur palaeontologist from Aberdeen. The fossil was in a layer of sandstone rocks on the foreshore of Cowie, near Stonehaven. The species was later called \"newmani\" in honour of its finder. The fossil is kept in National Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh. \nDescription.\nIn the photograph above, you can see the back is covered with hard plates, and wispy slender legs. The animal is definitely segmented, and it is like, or related to, millipedes.\nIts cuticle has what look like openings or spiracles. These are part of a gas exchange system that would work in air. So \"P. newmani\" is thought to be the earliest documented arthropod with a tracheal system, and the first known oxygen-breathing animal on land."}

She was kidnapped from the Columbia Mall parking lot in Grand Forks, North Dakota by Alfonso Rodriguez Jr on November 22, 2003. Her kidnapping and murder caused the creation of the Dru Sjodin National Sex Offender Public Registry.\nMurder.\nAt 4:00 pm Saturday, November 22, 2003, Sjodin, a 22-year-old college student at the University of North Dakota, finished her job shift at the Victoria's Secret store at the Columbia Mall in Grand Forks. Sjodin shopped for and bought a new purse from Marshall Field's. She then left the mall and began walking to her 1994 Oldsmobile Cutlass. During this time, Sjodin was speaking to her boyfriend, Chris Lang, on her cell phone. Ten minutes into the call, Lang reports Sjodin said \"Okay, okay\" before the call ended.\nJust over a week later, on December 1, 2003, 50-year-old registered sex offender Alfonso Rodriguez Jr. was arrested in connection with Sjodin's disappearance. Sjodin's body was found on April 17, 2004, just west of Crookston, Minnesota when deep snow drifts began to melt.\nCrookston is also where Rodriguez had been living with his mother. Sjodin's body was found partially nude and face down in a ravine. Her hands were tied behind her back. She had been beaten, sexually assaulted and stabbed. She had several lacerations, including a five-and-a-half-inch cut near her neck. A rope was tied around her neck.\nThousands of people had helped search for the young woman. Hundreds went to her funeral.\nTrial.\nThe trial of Alfonso Rodriguez Jr. was held in federal court because Sjodin was taken across state lines. This meant he was eligible for the death penalty if he was found guilty. But neither North Dakota nor Minnesota have the death penalty. \nOn August 30, 2006, Rodriguez was found guilty of sexual assault, kidnapping and murder in Sjodin's death.

Computer programs call functions. Each function calculates a result it will return. Memoization is simple: before the value is returned from the function call, it is stored in a table (or associative array). Like a cache, this array will only be able to store a limited number of results. The function can then be changed so it tries to look up the value of the input in its lookup table. This lookup is much less expensive than doing the calculation again. Also like a cache: the data table will be cleaned periodically, for examples the values that have not been lookued up for a given time are removed.\nAlthough related to caching, memoization refers to a specific case of this optimization, distinguishing it from forms of caching such as or page replacement. In the context of some logic programming languages, memoization is also known as ; see also lookup table."}

Her mother died when she was a child. Her stepmother was Ursula North. Martin was baptized in Olney, Buckinghamshire, England on 30 September 1621. Her family moved to Salisbury, Massachusetts around 1639 when she was about 18 years old.\nOn August 11, 1646 at Salisbury, Susannah married a widower George Martin, a blacksmith with whom she had eight children, including a daughter Jane, a great-great-great-great grandmother of United States President Chester A. Arthur.\nIn 1669, Susannah was first formally accused of witchcraft by William Sargent, Jr. In turn, George Martin sued Sargent for two counts of slander against Susannah, one for accusing her of being a witch, and another for claiming one of her sons was a bastard and another was her \"imp\". Martin withdrew the second count, but the Court upheld the accusation of witchcraft. A higher court later dismissed the witchcraft charges.\nBy 1671, the Martin family was again involved in legal proceedings dealing with the matter of Ursula North's inheritance, most of which Ursula had left to her granddaughter, Mary Jones Winsley. The court sided against Susannah and George, although Susannah was able to bring five further appeals, each being decided against her. \nTrial and accusation.\nGeorge died in 1686, leaving Susannah an impoverished widow by the time of the second accusation of witchcraft in 1692. Inhabitants of nearby Salem Village, including Joseph and Jarvis Ring, had named Susannah a witch and stated she had attempted to recruit them into witchcraft. She was also accused by John Allen of Salsbury, a man who claimed that she had bewitched his oxen and drove them into the river nearby where they later drowned. She was tried for these charges, during which process she proved by all accounts to be pious and quoted the Bible freely, something a witch was said incapable of doing. Cotton Mather countered Susannah's defense by stating in effect that the Devil's servants were capable of putting on a show of perfect innocence and Godliness.\nSusannah Martin was found guilty, and hanged on July 19, 1692 in Salem. Some interesting excerpts from the transcript of Susannah's trial are below: (spelling, punctuation, capitalization as original)To the Marshall of the County of Essex or his lawful Deputies or to the Constable of Amesbury: You are in their Majesties names hereby required forthwith or as soon as may be to apprehend and bring Susanna Mertin of Amesbury in \u00fe county of Esses Widdow at \u00fe house of Lt. Nathaniel Ingersolls in Salem village in order to her examination Relating to high suspicion of sundry acts of Witchcraft donne or committed by her upon \u00fe bodies of Mary Walcot, Abigail Williams, Ann Putnam, and Mercy Lewis of Salem village or farms whereby great hurt and damage hath been donne to \u00fe bodies of said persons... etc.At the preliminary trial for the crime of \"Witchcraft and sorcery\" Susanna pleaded not guilty. The original court record book has been lost, but the local Puritan minister, Cotton Mather, recorded the testimony. Susanna and the others accused were not allowed to have counsel.As soon as she came in, Marcy had fits\nMagistrate: Do you know this woman?\nAbigail Williams saith it is goody Martin, she hath hurt me often.\nOthers by fits were hindered from speaking.\nMarcy Lewis pointed at her and fell into a little fit.\nAnn Putnam threw her glove in a fit at her.\n... Susanna laughed ...\nMagistrate: What! Do you laugh at it?\nMartin: Well I may at such folly.\nMag: Is this folly? The hurt of persons?\nMartin: I never hurt man or woman or child.\nMarcy: She hath hurt me a great many times and pulls me down. \nThen Martin laughed again.Susannah Martin was twice forced to submit to physical examination for evidence of a \"witch's tit or physical protuberance which might give milk to a familiar.\" No such deformity was found in Susannah Martin but it was noted that \"in the morning her nipples were found to be full as if the milk would come\", but by late afternoon \"her breasts were slack, as if milk had already been given to someone or something.\" This was an indication that she had been visited by a witch's familiar, and was clear evidence of guilt.\nLegacy.\nLone Tree Hill, a famous historical site, bore a tablet on its westerly side marking the site of George and Susannah's home. The boulder which marked their homestead has been moved to make room for a highway, and it can be found on the map where the highway crosses Martin Road in Amesbury. The marker lies nearby. George was one of the largest landowners in Amesbury. The inscription on the marker reads: \"Here stood the house of Susannah Martin. An honest, hardworking Christian woman accused of being a witch and executed at Salem, July 19, 1692. She will be missed! A Martyr of Superstition. T.I.A. 1894.\" \nIn the 19th century, poet John Greenleaf Whittier composed \"The Witch's Daughter\" about Martin.\nOn Aug 29, 1957 the State of Massachusetts voted to wipe from the books the convictions of six women that had been unjustly accused of being witches 265 years earlier. Then Gov. Foster Furcolo signed the legislative intended to clear Susannah Martin, as well as: Ann Pudeator, Bridget Bishop, Alice Parker, Margaret Scott and Wilmot Redd. All had been convicted in a colonial court and hanged during the 17th century.\nHowever, while taking a graduate course on Salem witchcraft during the late 1990s, Paula Keene discovered that, although the legislators intended to pardon all six of the women in 1957, only Ann Pudeater's name was listed on the official documents. Susannah Martin, Bridget Bishop, Alice Parker, Margaret Scott and Wilmot Redd were simply listed as \"five others convicted of witchcraft.\" Keene and state representative Michael Ruane worked together to redress the issue.\nOn Halloween 2001, due to Keene and Ruane's efforts, as well as the efforts of many of the descendants of the accused witches, Susannah Martin, Bridget Bishop, Alice Parker, Margaret Scott and Wilmot Redd were finally, and truly exonerated by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Descendants of Susannah Martin\u2019s, Ethel Mae Hilton and grandchildren Douglas and Madrey Margaret Hilton were the only members of their family interested in the history of their accused witch ancestor."}

Some women have had strong pleasure from stimulation of the urethral sponge, but others have found the feeling to be not good, as irritating. The urethral sponge is around the clitoral nerve, and since the two are so closely inter-connected, stimulation of the clitoris may stimulate the nerve endings of the urethral sponge and vice versa. Some women enjoy the rear-entry position of sexual intercourse for this reason, because the penis is often angled slightly downward and can stimulate the front wall of the vagina, and then also the urethral sponge.\nRelation with the G-spot.\nThe urethral sponge is an area in which the G-spot (Gr\u00e4fenberg Spot) may be found. Although the G-spot may exist, it has been doubted by some researchers. A team at The King's College of London, in a big study on the G-spot's existence in recent years, and having 1,800 women, found no proof that the G-spot exists. The authors of the study had stated that the \"G-spot\" may be a figment (thought) of people's imagination, which has been encouraged by magazines, sex therapists and suggestive therapeutics. However, some other studies, using ultrasound, have found physiological evidence of the G-spot in women who report having orgasms during intercourse."}

There is a legend after the meaning of the name. The sauce was used regularly by a mother to cook freshwater fish for her family. However, there was once the family have no fish. The mother then took the leftover sauce to flavour meats and everyone liked the dish. This is the reason it got its name YuXiang or fish flavored. Cooking Yuxiang normally involves the use of sugar, vinegar, doubanjiang, soy sauce, and pickled chili peppers.\nPreparation.\nThe ingredients of yuxiang are finely minced pao la jiao (pickled chili), white scallion, ginger, and garlic. They are mixed in more-or-less equal portions. Some people prefer more scallions than ginger and garlic.The mixture is then fried in oil until fragrant. Water, starch, sugar, and vinegar are then added to create a basic sauce.\nDishes.\nThe sauce is used most often for dishes containing beef, pork, or chicken. It is sometimes used for vegetarian recipes. Barbara Tropp suggests in a book called \"The Modern Art of Chinese Cooking\" that Yuxiang can also be mean \"Sichuan-Hunan\" flavor. Dishes that use yuxiang as the main seasoning have the term (yuxiang) placed in front of the name of the dish. \nSome examples are as follows:"}

It was originally anti-Catholic, prejudiced against other nationalities, and against immigration. The movement was briefly a major political party in the form of the American Party. Followers of the movement were to reply \"I know nothing\" when asked about its specifics by outsiders, thus providing the group with its most common name.\nThe Know-Nothings believed a \"Romanist\" conspiracy was in progress, trying to undermine the power and authority of civil and religious liberty in the United States and wanted to politically organize native-born Protestants in a defense of their traditional religious and political values. It is remembered for this theme because of fears by Protestants that Catholic priests and bishops would control a large amount of voters. In most places, Know-Nothingism lasted only a year or two before disintegrating because of weak local leaders, few publicly declared national leaders and a deep split over the issue of slavery. In the South, the party did not focus on anti-Catholicism, but was the main alternative to the dominant Democratic Party.\nThe collapse of the Whig Party after the Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act passed left an opening for a new major party in to oppose the Democrats. The Know-Nothings elected congressman Nathaniel P. Banks of Massachusetts and many others in the 1854 elections and created a new party known as the American Party. Particularly in the South, the American Party served as a party for politicians who disagreed with the Democratic Party. Many also hoped that it would seek a middle ground between the pro-slavery positions of many Democratic politicians and the anti-slavery positions of the emerging Republican Party. The American Party nominated former President Millard Fillmore in the 1856 presidential election, although he kept quiet about his membership. Fillmore received 21.5% of the popular vote in the 1856 presidential election, finishing behind the Democratic and Republican nominees.\nThe party quickly declined after the 1856 election. The 1857 \"Dred Scott v. Sandford\" decision further aroused opposition to slavery in the North, where many Know Nothings joined the Republicans. Most of the remaining members of the party supported the Constitutional Union Party in the 1860 presidential election."}

MACBA deplored the decision of Philippe M\u00e9aille not to renew his long-term agreement with the institution, and assured that the security of the collection is guaranteed, and that \"Philippe M\u00e9aille arguments do not coincide at all with reality\".

They last five days, and are thought to be the highest standard of play.\nTest matches were invented in the 19th century as a competition between England and Australia. The first officially recognised Test match took place on 15\u201319 March 1877 and was played between England and Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG). Australia won by 45 runs. A Test match to celebrate 100 years of Test cricket was held in Melbourne on 12\u201317 March 1977, in which Australia beat England by 45 runs\u2014the same margin as that first Test. That first tour match was followed by a second test match, which was won by England. There were also a few games played against local teams, a tradition which continues today.\nSouth Africa became the third team to play Test cricket in 1888\u201389, and there was a long period before other countries played test cricket. The West Indies ('Windies') were the fourth test country: they played against England in London 1928 at Lords cricket ground. New Zealand first played against England in 1930 in Christchurch. The first Indian test side played England in 1932 in London at Lords.\nWhen British India was partitioned, the new nation Pakistan was given test status in 1952, on the recommendation of India. Their first test match was against India in Delhi. They were followed by Sri Lanka in 1982.\nThere are also four more countries who have full test status: Zimbabwe (1992), Bangladesh (2000), Ireland the Irish team represents both parts of Ireland \u2013 (2018), and Afghanistan (2018). Of these only Bangladesh has played regularly against the longer-established nations. There is a real gulf in playing standards between the top teams and the newcomers. This explains why there have been no test series between the stronger test countries and the weaker countries. A test series must be competitive for it to be commercially viable. Television rights need to be sold, and spectators attracted to the matches. Also, a country must be able to keep some cricket grounds to test standards.\nIt is clear that the sport of cricket spread mostly to countries of the former British Empire, with the notable exception of Canada (where cricket is just a minor sport). On the other hand, it is a truly international sport, played by nations in Europe, Africa (parts of), the Caribbean, the Indian subcontinent and Oceania."}

He discovered that the replacement of the salts that are in the secreted plasma is the key to a successful and simplified treatment.\nDuring the 1950s and early 1960s, Dr. Rosenthal and colleagues undertook a long-term study to test the efficacy of drinking a saline solution (containing table salt and baking soda) to replace the lost salts (the \"Peru Project\").\nHis research group demonstrated that this therapy was an effective alternative to the traditional treatment using intravenous injections of whole blood or plasma.\nThe simplified burn therapy remains widely used.\nHistamines.\nDr. Rosenthal and his collaborators were pioneers in the area of histamine biochemistry and physiology.\nThey developed a widely used method for quantifying histamine, worked on the pharmacology of histamines, and determined the biosynthetic pathway for spermidine.\nDr. Rosenthal also collaborated in research on the role of polyamines in the function of viral DNA.\nAwards and honors.\nDr. Rosenthal was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1979.\nHe was also a member of American Medical Association, American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Society of American Bacteriologists, and Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.\nIn 1962, he received the Public Health Service Meritorious Service Medal from the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.\nIn 1973, he received the Harvey Stuart Allen Distinguished Service Award from the American Burn Association.\nIn 1980, he received the Award for Experimental Therapeutics from the American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics in recognition of his pioneering work on the treatment of shock due to burns."}

They are referred as \"downgoing\" and \"overriding\" plates respectively.\nWhen a downgoing plate (usually composed of oceanic lithosphere) submerges beneath an overriding plate shallow earthquakes occur at the plate boundary and deeper earthquakes occur in the downgoing plate as it sinks into the Earth. The deep earthquakes caused by the downgoing plate form the Wadati\u2013Benioff zone. The deepest recorded earthquakes come from Wadati\u2013Benioff zones and can extend to depths as much as 650\u00a0km (400\u00a0mi) deep.\nDiscovery.\nIn 1935 Kiyoo Wadati published research on earthquakes with deep foci and how they are apt to take place near the edges of continents. Further analysis of earthquake foci and location was conducted by Hugo Benioff in 1945 where he developed a way to identify the boundary at which an earthquake was generated. The dipping zone of seismic activity that they helped discover was named in their honor."}

If someone goes missing at sea, they may instead call on the coast guard or a similar agency.\nMost missing person cases that are reported to the police are simple cases, where the person is found quickly. In 1999, 800,000 children went missing in the United States, but only 115 cases were kidnapped by a stranger who wanted to keep them for a long period of time.\nA small number of missing person cases are not solved for many years. These cases can be painful for friends and families, because they cannot be sure what happened to the person. In most countries, the law says that if someone has been missing for many years, the government can declare that the person is dead. This is known as \"declaring death \"in absentia\"\"."}

It has information on those subject to the U.S. military draft. All male U.S. citizens and male immigrant non-citizens between ages 18 and 25 are required by law to register within 30 days of their 18th birthdays. They must also contact the Selective Service within ten days of any changes of any information they gave, like a change of address. Females, on the other hand, are not required to register.\nRegistration with Selective Service is also required for several federal programs and benefits, including job training, federal employment, naturalization, Pell grants and student loans.\nOn July 2, 1980, then-President Jimmy Carter signed Proclamation 4771 (Registration under the Military Selective Service Act). That was in response to the Soviet war in Afghanistan the previous year. It re-established the Selective Service registration requirement for all 18-to-26 year old men born on or after January 1, 1960.\nThe first registrations began on July 21, 1980 at various post offices across the United States, starting with men born in 1960. Men born in or after 1963 were required to register within 30 days of their 18th birthday.\nOn April 27, 2016, the Armed House Services Committee voted to add an amendment to extend the authority for draft registration to females. If the bill had passed, it would have authorized then-President Barack Obama to order young women as well as men to register with the Selective System."}

While superpermutations can simply be made up of every arrangement listed side by side, it can also be shorter. Sometimes, the arrangements may overlap. For example, when there are 2 different symbols, the superpermutation 1221 contains all possible arrangements, 12 and 21. The list 121 also contains both permutations, 12 at the beginning and 21 at the end.\nAs the number of symbols increases, the length of the superpermutation increases, too. The superpermutation with only 1 symbol is only 1 long (1), while the 2nd superpermutation is 3 long (121). The 3rd superpermutation is 9 long (123121321), and the 4th one is 33 long (123412314231243121342132413214321). The length of the superpermutation with 5 symbols is 153, and it looks like this:\n123451234152341253412354123145231425314235142315423124531243512431\n52431254312134521342513421534213542132451324153241352413254132145\n3214352143251432154321\nSo far, mathematicians have not been able to find the smallest length superpermutation that uses 6 or more symbols. They are slowly getting closer to finding it out.\nSix or more symbol superpermutations.\nRight now, mathematicians do not know what the smallest superpermutation is when there are six or more symbols. However, over time the choices of what they could be have narrowed considerably from both above and below.\nIn September 2011, an unknown person on the internet forum 4chan showed people that there was definitely a smallest superpermutation for any superpermutation with more than 1 symbol. On the website, it was called \"The Haruhi Problem\", from a Japanese anime called \"The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.\" It was phrased like this: what would be the shortest amount of episodes that you would need to watch in order to guarantee that you watched every episode of a show? In October 2018, mathematician Robin Houston tweeted about it. \nOn October 25, 2018, Robin Houston, Jay Pantone, and Vince Vatter made the unknown person's proof better and posted it to the mathematics community.\nOn October 20 2018, Greg Egan found smaller superpermutations for ones with six or more symbols than there had ever been. This shows that smallest superpermutation must be at most that size. \nAs time goes on, people think that the smallest and largest possible lengths for these superpermutations will be narrowed down further. There is only one definite smallest superpermutation for each number of symbols."}

It was first shown at 2008 Cannes Film Festival at the March\u00e9 du Film. It was released theatrically in France on 3 September 2008.\nThe movie was controversial upon its release. It was associated with the New French Extremity movement.\nPlot.\nIn 1971, a young girl, Lucie Jurin, escapes from a disused slaughterhouse. She's been imprisoned and abused there for over a year. The criminals and their motivations remain a mystery. Lucie is placed in an orphanage. She becomes friends there with a young girl named Anna Assaoui. Anna quickly discovers Lucie believes she is being constantly terrorized by a ghoulish creature. Anna comforts Lucie every time she has a nightmare.\nFifteen years later, in 1986, Lucie bursts into a home of a \"normal\" family, the Belfonds. The Belfonds are Gabrielle, her husband and children Antoine and Marie. Lucie kills them all with a shotgun. Anna waits for Lucie elsewhere. Anna knows Lucie believes the Belfonds were the people responsible for her childhood abuse. But at the same time, Anna is horrified when Lucie tells her she's killed them.\nWhen they get to the house, Anna discovers Gabrielle is still alive. Anna tries to help her escape. However, Lucie beats Gabrielle to death. Lucie realizes that her insanity will not leave her. She commits suicide.\nThe next day, Anna is still at the family's house. She calls her mother by telephone. She has been estranged from her mother. In their conversation, it becomes evident that Anna was abused by her parents as a child. Suddenly, Anna hears some noises. She finds a secret underground chamber in the living room. In the chamber is a horribly tortured young woman named Sarah. Sarah proves that Lucie was right about the family. Anna helps Sarah escape. A group of strangers, however, kill Sarah with guns. Anna is captured. She meets the strangers' leader, an elderly lady named Mademoiselle.\nAnna becomes the group's latest subject. She goes through a period of being beaten and degraded. She hallucinates a conversation with Lucie. Anna is later told she has progressed further than any other test subject. She has reached the \"final stage.\" She is skinned alive. She survives the procedure. \nReception.\n\"Martyrs\" was categorized as a new example of new era French horror movies in terms of violence that it shows. The movie-ranking website Rotten Tomatoes said %53 of critics had given the movie positive reviews.\nFrench Commission de Classification des Oeuvres Cin\u00e9matographiques rated the movie 18+ (not suitable for children under 18). The movie's producers appealed. Martyrs' rating was later changed to 16+."}

It was fought over Archduchess Maria Theresa's succession to the Habsburg Monarchy. The war included other events such as King George's War in British America, the War of Jenkins' Ear (which formally began on 23 October 1739), the First Carnatic War in India, the Jacobite rising of 1745 in Scotland, and the First and Second Silesian Wars.\nMaria Theresa was not allowed to succeed to the various crowns of her father, Charles VI, because Salic law would not let a woman inherit them. That gave an opportunity for France and Prussia, joined by Bavaria, to challenge Habsburg power. Maria Theresa was supported by Great Britain, the Dutch Republic, Sardinia, and Saxony.\nSpain had been at war with Britain over colonies and trade since 1739 to re-establish its influence in northern Italy. Austria had taken control of northern Italy because of the War of the Spanish Succession in the early 18th century.\nThe war ended with the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748. Maria Theresa was confirmed as Archduchess of Austria and Queen of Hungary, but Prussia kept control of Silesia. The peace did not last, however, because of Austria's desire to recapture Silesia and the political upheaval in Europe, and soon came the Seven Years' War (1756\u20131763)."}

This led to the discovery of oxygen. However, some scientists continued to believe in phlogiston. They thought this explained the heat and light given off in combustion reactions. Today we see this as evidence of the transfer of energy to the surroundings."}

{"id": "680057", "revid": "7462071", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=680057", "title": "Romanization of Greek", "text": "Romanization of Greek is a way to write the Greek language (either Ancient or Modern Greek) with the Roman alphabet. That can be done by mapping either letters (called transliteration) or sounds (called transcription. The Greek name \u1f38\u03c9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 can be transliterated as \"Johannes\", which became John in Modern English. In Modern Greek, it is generally written \u0393\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2, which transliterates to \"Yannis\". The masculine Greek word \u1f0d\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 or \u0386\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 might variously appear as \"Hagi\u03bfs\", \"Agios\", \"Aghios\" or \"Ayios\", or it might simply be translated as \"Holy\" or \"Saint\" in English forms of Greek placenames.\nTraditional English renderings of Greek names originated from Roman systems that were established in antiquity. The Roman alphabet was a form of the Cumaean alphabet, which was itself developed from the Euboean script, which used as , as , and variant forms of and that later became L and S. When the Euboean script was used to write the classical Greek alphabet, \u27e8\u03ba\u27e9 was replaced with \u27e8c\u27e9, \u27e8\u03b1\u03b9\u27e9 and \u27e8\u03bf\u03b9\u27e9 became \u27e8\u00e6\u27e9 and \u27e8\u0153\u27e9, and \u27e8\u03b5\u03b9\u27e9 and \u27e8\u03bf\u03c5\u27e9 were simplified to \u27e8i\u27e9 (more rarely, corresponding to an earlier pronunciation, to \u27e8e\u27e9) and \u27e8u\u27e9. Aspirated consonants like \u27e8\u03b8\u27e9, \u27e8\u03c6\u27e9, initial-\u27e8\u03c1\u27e9, and \u27e8\u03c7\u27e9 simply wrote out the sound: \u27e8th\u27e9, \u27e8ph\u27e9, \u27e8rh\u27e9, and \u27e8ch\u27e9. Because English orthography has changed so much from the original Greek, modern scholarly transliteration now usually renders \u27e8\u03ba\u27e9 as \u27e8k\u27e9 and the diphthongs \u27e8\u03b1\u03b9, \u03bf\u03b9, \u03b5\u03b9, \u03bf\u03c5\u27e9 as \u27e8ai, oi, ei, ou\u27e9. Modern scholars also increasingly render \u27e8\u03c7\u27e9 as \u27e8kh\u27e9. Gteek sounds greatly changed, and Modern Greek sounds quite different from Ancient Greek. That also has had an influence on the terms used in English and other languages and had led to a number of different romanizations for names and placenames in the 19th and the 20th centuries. The Hellenic Organization for Standardization (ELOT) issued its system in co-operation with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1983. The system was adopted (with minor modifications) by the United Nations' Fifth Conference on the Standardization of Geographical Names at Montreal in 1987, by the United Kingdom's Permanent Committee on Geographical Names for British Official Use (PCGN) and by the United States' Board on Geographic Names (BGN) in 1996, and by the ISO itself in 1997. Romanization of names for official purposes, as with passports and identity cards, were required to use the ELOT system within Greece until 2011, when a legal decision permitted Greeks to use irregular forms (such as \"Demetrios\" for ) provided that official identification and documents also list the standard forms (as, for example, \"Demetrios OR Dimitrios\"). Other romanization systems are the BGN/PCGN's earlier 1962 system and the system employed by the American Library Association and the United States' Library of Congress."}

It is named after Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal program from between 1933 and 1936.\nU.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey released a 14-page document about the GND on 7 February 2019. They want to push the United States to using 100% renewable, zero-emission energy sources. Their plan would also address poverty in the U.S., and implement universal health care. The American Action Network estimated the plan would cost at least $1 trillion, and the document did not show where the money would specifically come from.\nSupport.\nJill Stein talked about the GND as early as 2012. The GND is officially in the Green Party USA's platform.\nOrganisations like 350.org, Greenpeace, Sierra Club, and Friends of the Earth support the GND proposal.\nThe GND is also supported by Democratic politicians Deb Haaland, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, Antonio Delgado, John Lewis, Earl Blumenauer, Carolyn Maloney, and Jos\u00e9 Serrano.\nCriticism.\nU.S. President Donald Trump is against the idea of a Green New Deal. He said on Twitter: \"I think it is very important for the Democrats to press forward with their Green New Deal. It would be great for the so-called \u201cCarbon Footprint\u201d to permanently eliminate all Planes, Cars, Cows, Oil, Gas &amp; the Military - even if no other country would do the same. Brilliant!\" "}

{"id": "680829", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=680829", "title": "Deltarune", "text": "Deltarune is a role-playing video game created by American indie developer Toby Fox. The player controls a human, Kris, in a world where monsters live on the surface of the Earth. Kris and a classmate named Susie fall from Earth into a place called the \u201cDark World\u201d where they meet Ralsei, who\u00a0tells them that they are heroes destined to restore balance to the world. The players meet various beings who call themselves \"Darkners\" during a quest to seal the dark fountain. Mainly through the combat system, the player encounters\u00a0multiple enemies who attack with a bullet hell system, which can be resolved\u00a0peacefully or by fighting them. The first chapter of the game was released on October 31, 2018 for Microsoft Windows and macOS for free, with a later Nintendo Switch release on February 28, 2019, with a PlayStation 4 port also in the works. The game's graphics are\u00a0similar to 16-bit Japanese role-playing games such as \"EarthBound, \" and \"Chrono Trigger\".\n\"Deltarune\" is a spin-off of Fox's previous game, \"Undertale\" (whose title Deltarune is an anagram for), but its setting is \"not the world of \"Undertale\"\", according to Fox, though characters and settings may bring some of \"Undertale\"'s world to mind. As of December 2018, Chapter 2 is planned, but no release date has been announced yet.\nGameplay.\n\"Deltarune\", like \"Undertale\", is a role-playing game that uses a top-down perspective. The player controls a human named Kris and has to complete objectives in order to beat the game. During some parts of the game, the player is allowed to choose attacks of other characters in the game. Combat is similar to most\u00a0normal turn-based role-playing games, choosing from a set of actions such as \"Attack\" or \"Spare\". While the game is biased towards avoiding fights, one of the party members, Susie, would rather attack enemies than spare them, so the player has to choose actions that will stop Susie from hurting enemies if they want to show mercy. The game also has TP (Tension Points), which allow team members to use spells such as \"Pacify\".\nPlot.\nChapter 1.\nUpon starting the game for the first time, the player is allowed to create an avatar. After making this avatar, it is deleted, with the player being told that \"no one can choose who they are in this world.\"\nThe player begins with the story as Kris, a human who lives with their adoptive mother Toriel, a monster. Toriel drops Kris off at school, where Kris goes toa class taught by Alphys. Kris and Susie, a monster classmate, are sent to get chalk for the blackboard.\u00a0After they enter\u00a0the supply closet, both of them are pulled into the \"Dark World\". There, they meet Ralsei, a prince of the dark, who tells them that the three of them are heroes destined to close a geyser of dark energy to restore balance to that world. However, the King has seized control of the Dark World and is determined to spread darkness.\nSusie chooses not to help, only wanting to return to her own world. However, the three encounter Lancer, the King's son, who tries to stop them from\u00a0getting further\u00a0with\u00a0various poorly thought out plans. Susie eventually decides to join Lancer, leaving Kris and Ralsei on their own. As Kris and Ralsei make their way to the King's castle, Susie\u00a0makes friends with\u00a0Lancer, and the four\u00a0eventually become a team. Upon realizing that they will have to\u00a0face the King, Lancer runs off to the castle and\u00a0tells the King's henchmen to throw Kris, Ralsei, and Susie into the dungeon.\nSusie escapes the dungeon and confronts Lancer, who explains he wanted to keep Susie and the King from hurting each other. Susie promises Lancer she won't hurt the King. Kris, Susie and Ralsei go to the top of the castle and battle the King. Eventually, the King falls to the ground in exhaustion and Ralsei heals him. However, this is revealed to be a ruse as the King quickly\u00a0stops\u00a0the three heroes from being able to act, threatening to kill them all. If the player has not ended previous battles by fighting\u00a0throughout the game, Lancer turns the King's men against him and imprisons him, taking his father's place. Otherwise, Ralsei subdues the King with a magic spell.\nThe group closes the dark geyser, so Kris and Susie can return to their own world. There, Susie says goodbye,\u00a0mentioning that she\u00a0wants to\u00a0go to the Dark World again. The player can explore the town before having Kris go home to bed.\nThat night, Kris, without player input, shakes in bed, then falls on the floor, and limps to the center of the room. Kris tears into their chest and rips out their soul, throwing it into a birdcage in the corner of the room. Kris draws a knife and turns toward the viewer. They smile, with their right eye flashing red.\nDevelopment.\n\"Deltarune\" was developed by Fox in GameMaker Studio 2. The game introduces a new battle system influenced by the \"Final Fantasy\" franchise, contrasting with the original game's combat system (which was inspired by that of the \"Mother\" series). Some of the music in the game remixes much of the soundtrack of \"Undertale\", but most pieces are new. The main game uses sounds\u00a0from \"EarthBound\", while battle music is similar to \"Breath of Fire III\" music, and even Lancer's theme is similar to J.A.K.Q. Dengekitai's opening theme. The game also has many similarities with \"Undertale\" in the name of characters, for example, Ralsei (one of the main characters) is an anagram of Asriel (a character from \"Undertale\") and Kris (the main character from \"Deltarune\") is almost an anagram of Frisk (the main character from \"Undertale\"). The name of the game, \"Deltarune\" is an anagram of \"Undertale.\" Temmie Chang, who helped as artist in Undertale, served as the main artist for the game, designing characters, sprites and animations.\nRelease.\nAfter previously teasing something \"Undertale\"-related a day earlier on Twitter, Fox released the first chapter of \"Deltarune\", a game \"intended for people who have completed \"Undertale\"\", on October 31, 2018 for Windows and macOS for free. Fox said that this release is the first part of a new project, and considered the release a \"survey program\" to determine how to take the project further. Fox\u00a0mentioned that \"Deltarune\" will be a larger project than \"Undertale\". He will release it as\u00a0one game (not chapters)\u00a0after forming a team to develop it. Fox plans for \"Deltarune\" to have only one ending."}

Later, he wrote the screenplay for the movies \"Rent\" and the live-action adaptation of \"Beauty and the Beast\" of 2017. Stephen Chbosky also directed the movie \"Wonder\".\nThemes.\nComing of age.\nIn most parts of the book, Charlie is talking about the struggles of coming of age. His everyday problems can be divided into three sectors. When describing his \u201cfriend\u201d, he complains the \u201cfears of adulthood\u201d. Stephen Chbosky summarises this aspect with the well-fitting quote \u201cIt's much easier not to know things sometimes.\u201d Charlie, the \u201cwallflower\u201d isn't ready to take the responsibility for his own life. High school, love and parties are overstraining him. \u201cPeople who try to control situations all the time are afraid that if they don't, nothing will work out the way they want.\u201d is Charlie's way to accept, that life happens the way it does and that he must stand it.\nMain quote of the second part of coming of age, \u201cWhat you need in life\u201d, is \u201cWe accept the love we deserve.\u201d Bill teaches Charlie that it needs more than people who give you love. You must give back. You must love yourself. You must trust others. You can't love alone. Charlie is also wishing for a person to keep contact \u201cI just need to know that someone out there listens and understands.\u201d By all the mess he had to go through, he tries not to lose his good mind about community.\nLast main part of growing up is \u201cbecoming individual\u201d. Sam, and also Charlie, understand that being an adult means to be unique. \u201cI'm going to do what I want to do. I'm going to be who I really am. And I'm going to figure out what that is.\u201d. That\u2019s the way Sam declares her readiness. But adolescence also is about doubting, \u201cJust tell me how to be different in a way that makes sense.\u201d The book conveys an important advice to pass adolescence: Just be yourself, find out who you are, leave your past far behind, but never forget where you started.\nMusic.\nMusic is a very important part of Charlie\u2019s life. Mostly, he listens to music in the car, either on the radio or from one of his mix tapes. These mix tapes are pretty special, because they are made by a person with their personal and favorite songs. Charlie thinks that when you know the taste of music of a person, then you already know them, because music says a lot about someone. Because of the personality, mix tapes are often used as a present. With music, Charlie connects a lot of memories, from car rides, high school dances, theatres or parties. On the mix tape of his sister is Charlie\u2019s favorite song, called \u201eAsleep\u201c. He really loves this song and whenever he feels sad or lonely, Charlie listens to it.\nLiterature.\nIn the novel, many books by other authors are mentioned. Charlie\u2019s English teacher sees that Charlie loves reading and writing, so he helps him develop his skills by giving him extra \"homework\": books to read and essays to write.\nThose books are:\nCharlie likes all the books except \"Naked Lunch\" because he does not understand it.\nAll these books were written between 1911 and 1960; by and by, Charlie starts to see similarities in the books.\nSport\nCharlie went to the high school football game. He went to the games sometimes, when the games were popular and sometimes Susan and Michael were there, but this time, Michael is gone and Susan hangs around different boys, also he went alone. He knew Patrick in the football game. He loves the \u201cFootball game\u201d, then he can analyse play-by-play.\nMental Illnesses.\nAlthough it\u2019s not clearly said in the novel, Charlie probably has several mental illnesses, including: Asperger's, PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder), occasional depression, and perhaps drug(cannabis)-induced psychosis and/or schizophrenia. Before the end of the novel Charlie\u2019s state of mental health deteriorates, because of his emerging PTSD (from the death of aunt Helen) and perhaps psychosis and/or schizophrenia. He is brought to a mental hospital, from which he finally recovers. Early in the book, it is mentioned that Charlie\u2019s best friend Michael appeared to have suffered from depression and had killed himself (before the book). There are several more people in the book who appear to have depression and/or bipolar disorder.\nSuicide.\nTeenagers, like adults, may decide to take their lives for a variety of reasons. Michael, who was Charlie\u2019s friend, had committed suicide (killed himself) but the reason behind it is never explicitly said in the novel. The school counselor guessed that he might have had \"a problem at home\" but nobody to talk to, so he felt desperate and lonely. As suicide is a tragic event, it impacted many of the people around him, like Charlie (his best friend) and Susan, (his girlfriend), in addition to the rest of his school. It did, however, help the staff and students become more aware of mental illness in and beyond the school. In addition, it is mentioned in the book that both Bridget and Carl struggled with suicidal thoughts when facing problems in their lives.\nHigh school in the US.\nThis paragraph is about the high school in the US from the book the perks of being a wallflower. But what do the students think about the school or what do the schools in the US pay attention to? The school in the US tries to offer social activities to the students so that they do not become criminals. However, the students are partly overstrained. The school in the US tries that the students are very educated when they leave the school.\nLGBTQI.\nThis theme appears often in the book, as one of the main characters, Patrick, is homosexual. Patrick is in a relationship with Brad, they are two very different people with very different lives. Brad is one of the most popular boys in school and is dating a girl to cover up his sexuality because he is ashamed of people knowing. Patrick is known by the nickname \"Nothing\" in school and is bullied often, however that doesn't disturb him at all. In their relationship they go through pain, fear, love, but mostly sorrow. Their whole relationship is told from Charlie's perspective. He explains the phases Patrick goes through and stories he is told throughout their affair. Brad at the beginning had to take drugs and alcohol every time they got together, so that he had something to blame for the next day. Patrick was always very upset about this, however when it finally stopped he wasn't at all bothered that Brad wanted to keep it a secret, as he had deep feelings for him. Things start becoming more complicated when Brad's dad walks in on them. Brad is beat up terribly by his father, which caused him not to come to school for a week and ignore Patrick completely. When Brad comes back to school he calls Patrick \"faggot\" in the cafeteria, in front of the whole school. This provokes a huge fight, including Brad's friends and Charlie who ends the fight. Brad and Patrick never get back together.\nFamily Relationships.\nCharlie's family consists of both of his parents, mom and dad, an older brother who is in college and an older sister who is a senior in high school. The family member Charlie is closest with is his mom's sister: aunt Helen. Unfortunately, she died in a car accident on his seventh birthday. Often, Charlie gets flashbacks about her, but he wouldn't understand why it happened. He later realizes after being in the hospital because of a mental breakdown, that his aunt Helen used to sexually abuse of him. Charlie's mom is always home, and does not work. According to Charlie, she is quiet and does not talk much, but when she does everybody listens to her. His dad is considered an honest man by Charlie, he is a hardworking man and a good husband. Since his brother is in college, he loses connection with him, and they don't talk much after that. However Charlie and his brother were never close in that sense. Charlie's relationship with his sister gets worse when he sees her boyfriend hit her. Eventually, Charlie discovers that his sister is pregnant, and he agrees to bring her to an abortion clinic and keep it a secret. She then breaks up with her boyfriend and the relationship between Charlie and her improves. Everybody in Charlie's family is busy and nobody ever has time for him. For that same reason, Charlie feels lonely and sometimes even depressed.\nDrugs.\nIn the book \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\" Charlie has a few experiences with drugs, at parties he goes to. Unfortunately, these were all due to bad influences from Patrick since his confusion with finding himself made him try different things.\nMovie Adaption.\nThe book was adapted into a movie in 2012, having Stephen Chbosky direct it and starring Logan Lerman as Charlie, Emma Watson as Sam and Ezra Miller as Patrick. Although the plot of the movie shows many similarities to the novel, it has some clear and distinctive differences. For example, in the movie, Charlie helps Sam with schoolwork to improve her grades, but this is not mentioned in the novel. And the side-story about Charlie\u2019s sister getting pregnant is only in the book, not in the movie.\nThe movie received mostly positive reviews following its first appearance in theaters, including 85% positive feedback on the website Rotten Tomatoes.\nHow do I include references?\nThere are three basic methods to add a reference:"}

Happening after NXT TakeOver: Phoenix and before Worlds Collide, it was the thirty-second Royal Rumble show. WWE has said that 48,193 people were in Chase Field to watch the show, but a wrestling journalist named Dave Meltzer has said that this is not true and that only a little more than 40,000 people were there. Golden Crisp was the sponsor of the show.\nTen matches happened at the show, including three on the pre-show. The last match was the men's Royal Rumble match and it was won by Seth Rollins. Becky Lynch won the women's Royal Rumble match, but lost the first match which was against Asuka for the SmackDown Women's Championship. In other important matches, Brock Lesnar kept the Universal Championship by beating Finn Balor, Daniel Bryan kept the WWE Championship by beating AJ Styles, and Ronda Rousey kept the Raw Women's Championship by beating Sasha Banks.\nStorylines.\nIt has been a tradition for the winner of the Royal Rumble match to get a WrestleMania match for a world championship. This year, the winner of the men's Royal Rumble would get a match at WrestleMania 35 for either the WWE Championship or the Universal Championship or while the winner of the women's would get a match for either the Raw Women's Championship or the SmackDown Women's Championship.\nThe show had ten matches with three on the pre-show. The matches were organized as part of stories where wrestlers played heroes, villains or somewhere in between. The winners of these matches are chosen by the writers of the stories from WWE.\nIn December 2018, WWE had a show called where a team called Fabulous Truth (whose members were Carmella and R-Truth beat a team called Mahalicia (whose members were Alicia Fox and Jinder Mahal) in the final of a tournament called the Mixed Match Challenge. For winning the tournament, Carmella would be the last to enter the women's Royal Rumble match, while R-Truth would be the last to enter the men's. For weeks after TLC, there were announcements that several other wrestlers would enter the Royal Rumbles.\nAt Crown Jewel in November, Brock Lesnar beat Braun Strowman to win the Universal Championship which was not held by anyone before the match. At TLC, Strowman beat Baron Corbin to earn another match against Lesnar for the championship. On the January 14 episode of the weekly WWE show called Raw, Corbin spoke badly about Strowman to him. So, Strowman chased Corbin into a parking lot and then, Corbin hid in a limousine car. Strowman broke the car's glass and door when Vince McMahon, the chairman of WWE, came out and said that it was his car. Mr. McMahon then fined Strowman $100,000. Strowman argued with Mr. McMahon, but Mr. McMahon cancelled the match between Strowman and Lesnar. Later on that episode, Corbin, John Cena, Drew McIntyre, and Finn Balor all said that they wanted to face Lesnar at the Royal Rumble. Mr. McMahon then organized a fatal four-way match between them, but Balor had to fight Jinder Mahal first and the winner would be a part of the fatal four-way. Balor won and then also won the fatal four-way match so he could get a Universal Championship match against Lesnar, but he could not compete in the Royal Rumble anymore.\nAt TLC, Daniel Bryan beat AJ Styles to keep the WWE Championship. On the January 1 episode of the weekly WWE show called SmackDown, Styles beat Randy Orton, Mustafa Ali, Rey Mysterio, and Samoa Joe in a fatal five-way match to earn another match against Bryan for the championship.\nAt TLC, Asuka beat Becky Lynch and Charlotte Flair in a triple threat Tables, Ladders &amp; Chairs match to win the SmackDown Women's Championship. On the January 1 episode of SmackDown, Lynch, Flair, and Carmella all said that they should face Asuka at the Royal Rumble. Triple H, the COO of WWE, then organized a triple threat match between them. Lynch won so she could get a SmackDown Women's Championship match against Asuka.\nAt TLC, Ronda Rousey beat Nia Jax to keep the Raw Women's Championship. On the January 7 episode of Raw, Rousey was interviewed by Alexa Bliss on \"A Moment of Bliss\" and said that she wanted to face Sasha Banks next because she could be a true test to how good Rousey is. Jax interrupted the interview and said that she wanted a rematch with Rousey. Banks then came out and she and Jax organized a match between each other. Banks won so she could get a Raw Women's Championship match against Rousey.\nAt Crown Jewel, Shane McMahon won the WWE World Cup. He replaced The Miz as a finalist because Miz got into a fight before the final and got injured, so he could not compete. After this, the Miz started asking McMahon to start a tag team with him and said that they could be the best tag team in the world. McMahon eventually agreed to do this. On the January 8 episode of SmackDown, Miz told the Bar (whose members are Cesaro and Sheamus) that he and McMahon wanted a match for their SmackDown Tag Team Championship at the Royal Rumble and the Bar agreed to the match.\nOn the TLC pre-show, Buddy Murphy beat Cedric Alexander to keep the WWE Cruiserweight Championship. On the December 26, 2018 episode of WWE's weekly show 205 Live (only for Cruiserweights who are wrestlers under 205 pounds), Drake Maverick, the GM of 205 Live, organized a fatal four-way match for Murphy to try to keep his title his title at the Royal Rumble. On the next episode of 205 Live, Kalisto beat Lio Rush and Akira Tozawa beat Drew Gulak so they could be a part of the WWE Cruiserweight Championship match at the Royal Rumble. On the next episode, Hideo Itami beat Alexander to take the last spot in the fatal four-way.\nOn the December 25, 2018 episode of SmackDown, Rusev beat Shinsuke Nakamura to win the United States Championship. On the January 1 episode, Rusev and his wife/manager Lana celebrated the win, but Nakamura attacked Rusev (Lana was also hurt during the fight).

The album was released on August 31, 2018, through Aftermath Entertainment, Shady Records, Interscope Records and Goliath Records.\nThe album features guest appearances from Joyner Lucas, Royce da 5'9\", Jessie Reyez, and uncredited vocals by Justin Vernon. The album is executively produced by Eminem, credited as Slim Shady, and frequent collaborator Dr. Dre. Production on the album comes from a variety of producers, including Mike Will Made It, Illa da Producer, Ronny J, Cubeatz, Backpack, Boi-1da, Jahaan Sweet, Tay Keith, Tim Suby, LoneStarr Muzik, Fred Ball, S1, Luke Wild, and Luis Resto.\nRecording and release.\nEminem had previously mentioned working on a song for \"Venom\" and released the album to streaming music service Spotify without any promotion or announcement on August 31, 2018.\nThe title track had previously been performed at the 2017 BET Awards.\nThe cover art is inspired by the Beastie Boys' \"Licensed to Ill\".\nCritical reception.\nAccording to review aggregator Metacritic, the album has an average critic review score of 67/100 based on four reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Aja Romano of \"Vox\" called the album Eminem's best in years, citing a return to the rapper's old school sound after deviating with \"Revival\". Ed Power of \"The Daily Telegraph\" also compared this album to \"Revival\", calling \"Kamikaze\" a \"a high-kicking, low-punching riposte\", indicating it is a better release. In \"NME\", Dan Stubbs gave the album three out of five stars, saying that Eminem is out of step with trends in hip hop by writing, \"there's a sense Eminem struggles with the modern world\" but stating that \"there are plenty of moments... that remind us of Em's greatness\". \"The Guardian\"s Alexis Patridis also gave the album three out of five stars and commented on Eminem's generational difference with current hip hop stars, summing up, \"...if you're going to listen to a middle-aged man complain that hip-hop isn't as good as it used to be, that it might as well be Eminem.\" \"The Line of Best Fit\"s William Rosebury gave the album 7 of 10 stars and commented that \"...\"Kamikaze\" is the sound of Eminem with his back against the wall, and this has led to some of his most invigorated writing in years\u2014albeit with some troubling lyrical results. Whether he'll be able to maintain this level of energy into his next project is up for debate; for now though, any inspiration is promising. Similarly, A. D. Amorosi of \"Variety\" sees the album as similar to Eminem's earlier work, stating, \"[his] voice hasn't sounded quite so cranky, silly, impassioned or enraged since his early days\". In \"The Atlantic\", Spencer Kornhaber addresses both comparisons with \"Revival\" and current hip hop stars on \"Kamikaze\" stating, \"Really, though, Eminem is waging a war over aesthetics, and \"Kamikaze\" is a better listen than \"Revival\" because its concision confirms Eminem's value as an entertainer... Certainly it's refreshing that in a genre especially obsessed with statements of dominance, Eminem doesn't disguise his feelings of irrelevance. He does, however, try to claim his influence.\"\nIn a negative review, \"The Hollywood Reporter\"s Jonny Coleman considered the album an \"epic fail\" and described it as \"the work of an aging artist trying, and failing, to remain relevant by acting out.\" In \"Billboard\", Mikelle Street said \"Eminem needs to be held accountable for using homophobic slurs (again),\" further adding, \"the idea that listeners are too \"soft\" for critiquing the ways in which rappers weaponize the identities of others against them ignores how hip-hop is a reflection and arbiter of culture.\"\nTrack listing.\nCredits adapted from Spotify.\nNotes"}

It is generally considered one of the easiest to play and learn, so it is good for newer poker players.\nHow to play.\nBefore any cards are dealt, some of the players will make forced bets. The most common method of forced bets is called \"blinds\", where two players to the left of the dealer make bets which are called the \"Small Blind\" and \"Big Blind\". These forced bets must be at least matched by the other players in order to keep their hands. The big blind is twice as much as the small blind. If the big blind was $1000, then it is said that the blinds are 500 and 1000. This money is put into a place in the center of the table that is called the \"pot\". The other common forced bet is called an \"ante\", where every player contributes a small amount to the pot for the right to receive cards. \nEach player is given five cards face down. These are called the player's \"Hole Cards\" or what the player has \"in the hole\". Once all the players have their hole cards, the betting starts. If blinds are being used, the player to the left of the Big Blind player starts the betting; if antes are being used, the player to the left of the dealer starts the betting. Players may \"Check\", or bet nothing, if no player before them in the turn has bet; this is only possible in a game where antes are used. The lowest amount that can be bet is the amount of the big blind or ante. Players can bet more than the minimum if they want. This is called \"Raising\". If a player raises, the amount he raised the bet to is the new minimum. Each player in turn may either \"Call\" (pay the current bet amount), Raise, or \"Fold\" (quit the hand, and give up one's cards into the \"muck,\" the pile of already used cards which won't be used again). This action keeps going around the table until each player has called or folded his hand.\nAfter the first turn of betting is over, each player may swap some of their cards for new ones, which are given by the dealer. This is called \"drawing\", and the cards that the players gave up are put into the muck. The number of cards that each player can swap varies depending on the agreed rules. The \"draw\" round begins with the player to left of the dealer and continues clockwise until everyone has drawn, including the dealer. After the draw round, another turn of betting takes place. There is no starting bet in this turn (no blinds) unless a player makes a bet. Players may \"Check\", or bet nothing, if no player before them in the turn has bet. If everyone checks, or if a player bets and all the others call or fold, then the round of betting is over.\nWith their five hole cards, the player with the best poker hand wins the round and the pot. If two or more players have the same hand, those players split the pot evenly. If one person bets and all other players have folded, the hand ends then and that player wins; they don't have to show their cards unless they want to.\nHands.\nThe following are poker hands, from best to worst:"}

It is also seen by many as a continuation of the Ming Dynasty.\nHistory.\nIn the seventeenth year of Chongzhen (\u5d07\u796f, 1644), Li Zicheng (\u674e\u81ea\u6210)'s rebellious army captured Beijing, and Zhu Youjian (\u6731\u7531\u68c0),Emperor Chongzhen, hanged himself in Meishan. When the Qing army entered the Central Plains (\u4e2d\u539f\u5730\u533a), most of the imperial families and ministers of the Ming Dynasty fled to the south. They had half of the rivers and mountains south of the Huaihe River to resist the Qing army, including the Hongguang (\u5f18\u5149) regime, the Lu Kingdom (\u9c81\u738b), the Longwu (\u9686\u6b66) regime, the Shaowu (\u7ecd\u6b66) regime, the Yongli (\u6c38\u5386) regime and the Ming Zheng (\u660e\u90d1) regimes.\nIn 1644, after the death of Emperor Chongzhen, Zhu You Song (\u6731\u7531\u5d27), the King of Fu (\u798f\u738b), was appointed Emperor of Nanjing (\u5357\u4eac) and changed his name to Hongguang after another year. Later, the Qing army quickly descended to the South and besieged Yangzhou (\u626c\u5dde). The city of Yangzhou was destroyed and the Qing army slaughtered the city. Historically, it was called \"the 10th day of Yangzhou\" (\"\u626c\u5dde\u5341\u65e5\"). Soon after Nanjing fell, Emperor Hongguang was captured.\nIn 1645, under the support of Zheng Zhilong (\u90d1\u829d\u9f99) and others, Zhu Yujian (\u6731\u807f\u952e) , the King of Tang (\u5510\u738b) called himself Emperor in Fuzhou (\u798f\u5dde) and Longwu in another year. Emperor Longwu launched a short Northern Expedition under the chairmanship of minister Huang Daozhou (\u9ec4\u9053\u5468). At the same time, he joined the peasant rebellion forces to resist the Qing Dynasty (\u6e05\u671d,1644-1911). However, with the surrender of Zheng Zhilong to the Qing Dynasty, the situation deteriorated. After being captured, Emperor Longwu died of hunger strike, and the Qing army quickly occupied most of the Southeast.\nIn a critical situation, the rest of the Daxi Army (\u5927\u897f\u519b) and the bureaucrats of the Ming Dynasty joined forces to support Zhu Youlang (\u6731\u7531\u6994) \n, the King of Gui (\u6842\u738b) to be emperor in southwest China and changed his name to Yongli. At the same time, Zheng Chenggong (\u90d1\u6210\u529f) also took advantage of the rising trend in the southeast coast, attacking the Qing army from both East and west, and the anti-Qing situation reached a climax. However, with the internal strife among the three kings and the attack of the Qing army, the defense line of the Ming army was quickly broken down by the Qing army.\nIn 1661, Wu Sangui (\u5434\u4e09\u6842) led the Qing Army into Myanmar, and Mangbai (\u83bd\u767d), the king of Myanmar, handed over Yongli to the Qing Army. The following April, Yongli and Prince were killed by Wu Sangui in Kunming (\u6606\u660e). Since then, Zheng Chenggong revered the Ming Dynasty and rehabilitated Taiwan (\u53f0\u6e7e) eastward as a base for resisting the Qing Dynasty and established the Ming and Zheng Dynasty. The Ming Zheng regimes continued to use the Yongli Year, but did not support the Ming Dynasty as emperor or supervisor.\nIn 1683, when the Qing army occupied Taiwan, Zheng Ke Shuang (\u90d1\u514b\u587d), King of Yanping (\u5ef6\u5e73\u738b), fell to the Qing Dynasty, and Zhu Shugui (\u6731\u672f\u6842), King of Ningjing (\u5b81\u9756\u738b), died by suicide, and the forces of the Ming Dynasty were completely destroyed."}

The colonial empires were well established. There were many technological, scientific, and cultural innovations. The arts flourished in Paris and elsewhere. Many masterpieces of literature, music, theatre, and visual art were created. \nThe Belle \u00c9poque was named after the event. It was considered a \"Golden Age\" in contrast to the horrors of World War I. The Belle Epoque was a period in which, according to historian R.R. Palmer, \"European civilization achieved its greatest power in global politics, and also exerted its maximum influence upon peoples outside Europe\".\nIn the United Kingdom, the Belle \u00c9poque overlapped with the late Victorian era and the Edwardian era in a period known as \"Pax Britannica\". In Germany, the Belle \u00c9poque coincided with the reigns of William I, Frederick III and Wilhelm II. In Italy, with the reigns of Victor Emmanuel II, Umberto I and early of the reign of Victor Emmanuel III. In Russia, with the reigns of Alexander III and Nicholas II. \nIn the United States, after the Panic of 1873, the same period was called the Gilded Age (1870s1900s). In Brazil, it started with the end of the Paraguayan War. In Mexico, the period was known as the Porfiriato, and in Japan, it coincided with the Meiji period."}
