The Zou tribal populace is mainly concentrated in two districts of the state, namely, Churachandpur and Chandel. Zou language has been incorporated in the study curriculum of several high schools and also some of the higher secondary schools in the state of Manipur.\nZou tribes are a less known indigenous community residing along the Indo-Burma border. Zou tribe is officially recognised as Indian Scheduled Tribe in the state of Manipur. Zou tribal population in the country is estimated to be nearly 20,000 to 25,000, although there are no official records. Zou tribal community is mostly concentrated in and around Churachandpur district and Chandel district of this state of North-East India. According to 2001 census report, the Zou population has been ranked as the 10th largest amongst the Scheduled Tribe population in Manipur. Zou language is one of the set Major Indian Languages taught in the high schools and higher secondary schools of the state.\nIn India, the Zou are officially recognized as one of the thirty-three indigenous peoples within the state of Manipur, and are one of the scheduled tribes. According to the 2001 Census, the Zou population in Manipur is around 20,000, less than 3% of the population. The community is concentrated in Churachandpur and Chandel districts of Manipur in North-East India.\nHistory of Zou Tribe.\nThe history of Zou tribe is not very clear. The Zou tribes have Indo-Chinese origin and the in the local dialect of the Zou people, the name of the tribal group suggests 'human being'. There is a saying among the tribal community that mankind is born from trees, leaves and soil. It is believed that the early history of Zou community is lost in legends and myths. The linguistic and racial evidences imply that they are of Indo-Chinese origin. Linguists said that the Zomi language belongs to Tibeto-Burman language family. In the South-East Asian region, there had been some dynasties, places and people, which bear the mark, Zou with some variations in spelling. Further, some scholars also suggest that around 200 BC because of regular Chinese attacks, the Zomis probably have moved to the north east of Tibet.\nLanguage.\nThe Zou tribal community has a script of its own, which is known as \"Zolai\". All the write ups of the Zou tribes are being done using the script. Today, this Zolai script has gained popularity amongst Zou youths who have started to learn the script with lots of enthusiasm and excitement. However, Roman script is the official script that has been used by the Zou population. Even the holy book Bible has been translated in to Zou language making use of Roman script. In Manipur, the literacy rate of the Zou tribes is low and it is around 61.6 percent according to 2001 Census report. It is to be noted that the Zou dialectal group is just a branch of the huge traditional group, namely, Chin-Kuki-Lushai ethnic group.\nNotes on Zou Language.\nOriginal Mother Tongue of Zote (Zomi)\nRound about 1450 A.D, Pu Hanghil (the father of Chie Manlun) and Pu Gen Kun of Taithul family founded Hai Daw village from Suih Mual village. Pu Gen Kun was appointed to be the Headman of Hai Dawi village. Both of them fought together against Bum Zang village which was about two miles from Hai Dawi. There they defeated the villagers of Bum Zang village. Later, Pu Hang Hil was appointed as Headman of Bum Zang village. Later, Pu Hang Hil shifted to Khua Dai village which is about three miles from Bum Zang village. There his sons Man Lun, Ma Tuang, Mang Son, Hang Vung and Mat Mang were born. As they grew in about 1500 A.D Manlun started his ruling as a chief Khuangnung in village. Mantuang in 1550 A.D at Phaitu village, Mangson at Gamngai and Hangvung at Khuadai village(?). So, we can simply point out that the first Zote Khua was Hai Dawi village. Up to this day Hai Dawi people still exist a people and they speak Hai Dawi dialect. To the original tongue of Zote might be Hai Dawi dialect.\nAs the Israelites retained the Hebrew language so also if we are going to retain our real mother tongue, we must speak Hai Dawi dialect, for it was the first and lingua franca of Zote descendants. Similarly if any one among Zote descendants would like to print any book or Bible, he would use the Hai Dawi dialect words, not because of its fitness, but only for its originality. I believe we all agree to give first priority to Hai Dawi dialect as our Zote-original mother tongue.\nThe Hai Dawi dialect\nMaw na sung ma naw in, amaw sa pi ma in leimi in i piang a, a khawh ma ma - gam lua a i lua suhsuh ih mawnate ma ei bawl in eima pumpi ei man muda maithei, Ih mawnate -eeng taang gol lua a hi man in khat veivei eima mawnate eimon maisah zolo maithei va-ia kim lai, tuate lip khap sih saang a pamai eisa, ei khua tua ngeet-nguut ngeng ngong man a ih dial dual liang luang mawna nei van nuai ei mai sah thop valong, abieh huai tapo ma Jehova ki chi Pasian khat a na om ngang tangh hi.\nTranslation: \nAs we are born in sin, we cannot even love ourselves and there is no knowledge about what is forgiveness, because of the enormous sins inherited in us. Eventhough we are in this situation, inspite of our enormous sins the one who has mercy, sympathises us and forgives us our sins is the God called Jehovah.\nTua Jehovah Pasian in atapa neisun Zeisu tawh ei maw nei leimite ei tat ngam giap na, itna sang a a uang gol zaw lim itna dang leitung ah tu dong kimu nai va-ia lo hi.\nTransaltion:\nJehovah God's love in giving his only begotten son for the remission of our sins and its horrible consequence is the greatest love in the world. There is greater love in the world up to this day.\nTui khang bang a leitung a tomkal khat ih mit phet va huausung teng beeh, upna a muan tawh Jehovah Pasian um kha popo lei-ih zaw? Aman eite chidamna, khansauna, pilna, hauna, lungnopna, ji hoi, pasal hoi, tanu tapa meel hoi neitheina thuphate tawh ei ang vaan tuah valon ding baan ah, ih si zaw chiang na ngawn a ih hla in van tung ah hindenna nga ding-chi te a kammal tawh ei khap saa ma tah khu.\nTranslation: \nWithin our span of vaporous life, if we believe in Jehovah God rightly, there are numerous promises abounded for health, prosperity, wisdom, longevity, good husband, good wife, and even our offspring would see beauty and excellence and above all eternal bliss after life will be received.\nCulture.\nThese Zou tribes, following the trend of the other tribes, too follow Christianity as their main religion. This Zou community has a plethora of rituals and customs, both religious as well as social, undergo sea change to keep up with the trend of present day modern trends. The Zou people follow ceremonies associated with nature. The Zou tribal society still loyally maintains their old patriarchal structure.\nHunting and agriculture are the major occupation of the Zou tribal people. Modern education system empowered the Zou women to enter today's job market.\nCustoms.\nThe traditional customs, practices and other related issues of this small tribe has recently been explored systematically. Unfortunately, this tribe has escaped the attention of social scientists in general and sociologists in particular. The Zous like other tribal communities in the northeast India have maintained their age-old customary practices.\nTypes of marriage.\nThe Zou tribe generally follows what is called as \"Patrilineal cross-cousin's marriage\" which is their first choice known as Neita. It is generally observed that the traditional marriage system of the Zou tribes is regulated either by (i) Tong Mou (Arranged marriage), (ii) Neita (Cross cousin Marriage), and (ii) Elopement Marriage. THe above three types of marriage of course consist of arrange as well as love marriage. There are minute details to be explored with related to Zou customary marriage practices, I am not going to elaborate on all these minute details at the moment. This article aims at the contemporary practices without going in deep studies.\nZou folklore.\nKhupcing And Ngambawm.\nOnce there were two woman who were great friends and they loved each other very much. One day they made an agreement that if one gives birth to a male baby and other give birth to a female baby they would marry them to each other. Later in the use two pregnant women gave birth to a female and the other woman gave birth to a male baby.The male baby was named Ngambawm and the female baby was named Khupching. Khupching belongs to a royal family whereas Ngambawm belong to a poor family. So their social disparities created a social barrier. Khupching\u2019s parents retracted from their agreement to marry these two people.So they tried to seeparate them rightr from their babyhood. They used different cradles,but it was so amazing that the two babies join themselves in one cradle. Even in the field they thought that they had separated while ploughing the field they found the two babies join together in the evening in one cradle.As they grew up Khupching and Ngambawm loved each other very much. One day Ngambawm asked Khupching to marry him. \nBut Khupching replied in songs:\n(a) Ka tun va dongin,ka zuo va dong in khuokh\u00e2l tui bang hing la ve aw.\n[ask my mother ask my father fetch me like the dry season(autumn) waters.] \nNgambawm asked her parents.They refused/rejected him flatly.\nNgambawm sang this song:\n\"(a) Na tun lah dong ing na zuo lah dong ing khuokh\u00e2l tui bang l\u00e2h n\u00e2ilou e.\"\nI had asked your mother and father, they flatly refused to marry you to me, but I can not fetch you like dry season (autumn) waters. On hearing her parents refused him, her love for Ngambawm increased day by day.\nOne day Ngambawm plucked a single hair of Khupching and he placed it under a stone which was near a waterfall of a stream.Khupching fell ill since then.Her mother decalred that if someone could cure her he will be her husand. When he heard this news ngambawm took back the hair from under the stone and put it back into Khupching\u2019s head. Ngambawm cured her but her parents still refused him marriage to her. Ngambawm again took back and he put it under the stone nearby stream once again. She became ill bagain. Her parents again promised the same as before to one who could cure her. He took the hair and put it back into her head and she was cured. In this way he cured her many times.But her parents were adamanat not to mary her off to him. Ngambawm again hid her hair under a stone unfortunately this time her hair was lost in the running stream. So Khupching fell ill and died. When the body was about to be buried her body swelled like a big balloon and the people could not extricate out of the house. The people were flabber-gasted and amazed about this phenomenon. No one could solve the problem. So they requested Ngambawm to come and help them out. Ngambawm spoke to the corpse saying \u201cDarling we are separated but this is the will of God, make your self small again and get out of the the door\u201d. After that the corpse became small and was able to get out the door easily. Once again the corpse refused to get out of the entrance of the gate of the house by swelling big. again. Ngambawm said \u201cDarling, make yourself small again one more and get out of the entrance gate of the house.\u201d After that the corpse was easily taken out of the entrance gate.After Khupching was buried Ngambawm returned to his house filled with tears.\n\"(a) Atui in hal e, t\u00eau a tui in hal ,hal jou nailou zawlching ng\u00e2i ing e. \"\n(b) Atui suh inlu ong damdiel in luong e, Ching aw v\u00e2i bang na th\u00e2m na hie?\n[The waterfall was between us but it could not separate us I love Chingkhup more and more. The water flows gently but you died in this flowing water.]\nOne day Ngambawm planted a cockscomb flower on the tomb of Khupching. He saw a wild cat coming to pluck the flowers and he caught it by chance.When he asked the wild cat as to why it plucked the flowers every night it told him that it was sent by Khupching. He told the wild cat to pluck out the chicken\u2019s feathers on its way to the Khupching\u2019s village till he arrives there. Following the trail of plumes he finally arrived at the village where Khupching lives. On seeing her his joy knew no bounds. He and Khupching lived together in the house. One day the villagers went for fishing expedition She sent him also to join the villagers and she gave him the bamboo basket for collecting fishes.\nOne day Khupching said to Ngambawm, \u201c Please go back to your village,as soon as you reach your home kill one pig and eat its meat. After that hang a spear above your bed, and let free all the chicken from their roosts. Then, lie down on your bed facing the roof of your house whre you hanged the spear\u201d. As advised by her he returned to his village soon and he did whatever things to be done as told by Khupching.As he lay on his bed the spear accidentally fell on his chest and he was killed instantly. After his death his spirit went the village of Khupching. He reached her house and they both met each other happily ever after."}

Because of this, the Space Force is led by the Secretary of the Air Force, who is under the Secretary of Defense. The leader of the Space Force is called the Chief of Space Operations. \nHistory.\nOn June 18, 2018, President Donald Trump announced in an address to the National Space Council a directive that requests the creation of a sixth branch of the United States Armed Forces.\nThe president announced his intention for The Pentagon to create the 'Space Force' as an independent service branch, separate from the United States Air Force.\nHowever, Trump's then Defense Secretary James Mattis and Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson think it is a bad idea because it is \"complex\" and will override the Air Force's job. Many US Senators stated they would rather create a Space Corps inside the Air Force. The Air Force has had a \"Space Command\" since September 1, 1982. General John W. Raymond is nominated to be commander of Space Command in April 2019. His nomination will be heard in United State Senate in June 2019.

It ensures that they can conduct military actions in space quickly and for a long time. \nDuties.\nIts duties are to protect the interests of the United States in space. It also prevents attacks on the United States in and from space, and to generally operate in space.\nOrganization.\nThe Space Force is one of two equal parts of the Department of the Air Force. The other one is the United States Air Force. Both are run by the Secretary of the Air Force.\nThe leader of the Space Force is the Chief of Space Operations (CSO), who is a general. The Chief of Space Operations will become a member of the Joint Staff one year after the Space Force Act was passed. \nAbout 16,000 Air Force members are going to become part of the Space Force while the branch becomes part of the U.S. Armed Forces. It will have its own way of training members, and will create uniforms, ranks, logo, patch, awards, and an official song.

It airs on weekdays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Eastern Time. It gives information about the current weather events happening in the United States. It is \"The Weather Channel\"'s de facto program.\nHistory.\n\"Weather Center Live\" formally launched as \"Weather Center\" on March 2, 2009. It replaced the old Weather Center. Its hosts were Stephanie Abrams and Mike Bettes. Abrams and Bettes formerly hosted \"Abrams &amp; Bettes: Beyond the Forecast\", which ended three days earlier. From May 5 to June 12, 2009, Mike Bettes went on the Vortex 2 project, so Adam Berg filled in for him in the studio.\nSchedule and hosts.\nOn June 22, 2009, Jim Cantore and Alexandra Steele became hosts of the program, replacing Abrams &amp; Bettes (they got a week off to get ready for their new hosts on \"Your Weather Today\", now \"America's Morning Headquarters\"). Cantore and Steele hosted from 7-10 p.m. ET under the title \"Weather Center with Cantore &amp; Steele\" (just like under Your Weather Today's new name \"Your Weather Today with Abrams &amp; Bettes\").\nIn December 2009, Kevin Robinson left The Weather Channel, and was replaced by Chris Warren. In September 2010, Crystal Egger replaced Alexandra Steele, who was later at CNN. Nicole Mitchell left the program in November, and was replaced by Kelly Cass.\nBeginning in January 2011, Weather Center aired three blocks a night (7-8 p.m., 10-11 p.m., and 1-2 a.m.) and debuted on weekends on February 5, 2011. The weekday editions were hosted by Chris Warren and Crystal Egger, the weekend editions were hosted by Paul Goodloe and Kelly Cass.\nIn March 2012, the weekday edition debuted at 4:00 p.m., moving \"Day Planner\" to 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. ET. The weekend edition debuted at 4 p.m. as well, canceling PM Edition. In November 2012, Weather Center Live began airing from 5-8 p.m. ET.\nTodd Santos left the channel in July 2013, and was replaced by Keith Carson. In September, Crystal Egger left the program (she returned on September 12 to anchor from 1-3 a.m. ET due to the flooding in Colorado, before she left the network for good). Alexandra Wilson left the afternoon 4-5 p.m. edition to replace her as a co-host with Chris Warren and Jim Cantore. However when she left no anchor was announced to join Alex Wallace.\nOn November 12, 2013 at 4:00 a.m. Eastern Time, The Weather Channel re-launched with new graphics. As a result, the program was extended to mornings and afternoons (4:00 to 5:30 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Eastern) and weekends from 4:30 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Eastern Time, but that change meant that the show's 10:00 p.m. and 1:00 a.m. editions and weekends at 4:00 and 7:00 p.m. Eastern were replaced by long-form programming, removing nighttime forecast programs for the first time in The Weather Channel's history.\nIn February 2014, the show was extended to 2:00-5:00 p.m. ET. In April, Dave Schwartz returned to The Weather Channel co-anchoring alongside Alexandra Wilson. On November 6, 2014, the show's 4:00-5:30 a.m. time slot was replaced by long-form programming (from 4-5 a.m.) and an extended \"Wake Up with Al\" from 5 to 5:30 a.m. ET. On November 8, 2014, the weekend 4-5 a.m. ET and noon-2 p.m. editions were also replaced by long-form programming. So as a result, \"Weather Center Live\" only aired from 11:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. ET weekdays and 5:00 a.m. to noon ET on weekends.\nIn mid-November, Weather Center Live began airing at 10:00 a.m. weekdays, canceling the rebroadcast of \"Wake Up with Al\".\nOn January 31, 2015, the 5:00-9:00 a.m. edition was replaced by \"AMHQ Weekend\" hosted by Reynolds Wolf and Kait Parker. On March 14, 2015, the 9:00 a.m. to noon edition was replaced by \"Weekend Recharge\" hosted by Maria LaRosa and Paul Goodloe. Weather Center Live became a weekday only show, airing from 10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time.\nOn August 24, 2015, the 6:00 to 8:00 p.m. edition was replaced by \"Weather Underground\", hosted by Mike Bettes and Alex Wilson. On June 4, 2018, Weather Center Live was shortened by an hour, ending at 5 p.m. ET.\nIn December 2018, Weather Center Live began being known as \"The Weather Channel LIVE\" only on electronic program guides."}

He was an astronomer, physicist, and mathematician in the early 20th century.\nEddington did his greatest work in astrophysics. He was also a philosopher of science and a populariser of science. The Eddington limit is named after him. It is the natural limit to the luminosity of stars, or the radiation generated by accretion onto a compact object (which is what causes the luminosity). \nAround 1920, he anticipated the discovery and mechanism of nuclear fusion in stars. This was published in his paper \"The Internal Constitution of the Stars\". At that time, the source of stellar energy was a complete mystery; Eddington was the first to correctly speculate that the source was fusion of hydrogen into helium.\nHe is also famous for his work on the theory of relativity. Eddington wrote a number of articles that explained Einstein's theory of general relativity to the English-speaking world. World War I severed many lines of scientific communication and new developments in German science were not well known in England. He also conducted an expedition to observe the solar eclipse of 29 May 1919. That gave one of the earliest confirmations of general relativity.The observations showed that light from stars which passed close by the Sun was slightly bent towards the Sun. This was predicted by the general theory of relativity. He became known for his popular expositions and interpretations of the theory. "}

A pure or unconditional basic income has no means test, much like Social Security in the United States. Basic income can be implemented nationally, regionally or locally. The idea gained attention in recent years because people fear that technology will make many jobs obsolete in the future.\nThe idea has never been put in place by any country yet, but there have been some experimental trials.\nIn a 2016 survey, 64% of Europeans voted for an UBI.\nConcept.\nAn UBI is an income for everyone. There would be neither a social administrative means test nor a requirement of willingness to work. On the other hand, tax- and contribution-financed social benefits like unemployment benefit, social assistance or child benefit would no longer apply.\nThe incomes would be:\nHistory.\nThe Roman emperor Trajan gave 650 denarii to all common Roman citizens who applied.\nIn the 1516 book \"Utopia\", Sir Thomas More describes a society in which every person receives a guaranteed income.\nIn 1984, the Basic Income Research Group began researching on basic income.\nIn the 21st century, the idea gained attention because many people fear that artificial intelligence (AI) and automation will make many jobs obsolete in the near future.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, a petition in Europe called for an \"emergency basic income\". It got more than 200,000 signatures. The public opinion was largely positive.\nReasons and arguments.\nAutomation.\nOne of the most popular reasons for an UBI is that artificial intelligence (AI) and automation will make many jobs obsolete in the near future. However, people still have to get enough money to live, even when there is no work for them anymore. An UBI could be a good solution for this problem.\nBetter working conditions.\nAdvocates of UBI say that with basic income, unattractive jobs would have to be better paid and their working conditions improved. This is because there is still a need for people who do this kind of work. And if they already get enough money from UBI, there has to be an incentive for doing these jobs.\nBetter society.\nSome hope that an UBI will lead to a happier and fairer society with fewer debates about envy.\nSome people also think that an UBI could make society more creative because people would no longer have the pressure to work. For example, people would have more time to educate themselves or find things they are interested in.\nSome believe that an UBI will increase the willingness to take risks because everyone would be financially secure to some degree. This would promote a culture of ingenuity and increase the spirit of invention.\nNotable advocates.\nThere are many prominent advocates of universal basic income. The English-language Wikipedia has a whole article about UBI advocates. This section here only lists the most notable advocates.\nPilot programs and experiments.\nSince the 1960s, there have been a number of basic income pilot programs and experiments.

Usually, the files are created using the same ways as cryptography (the science of hiding information). Digital signatures can be used to keep the transactions safe, and let other people check that the transactions are real. The first cryptocurrencies were made to be free of government-given currencies.\nCryptocurrencies use 'decentralized control'. That means that government can not control cryptocurrencies. This is different to 'centralized' electronic money and central banks. The control of each cryptocurrency works through a distributed ledger (a list of transactions shared by everyone), usually a blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction database.\nBitcoin, first released as open-source software in 2009. It is often called the first decentralized cryptocurrency. Since then, over 4,000 cryptocurrencies (sometimes called altcoins, which is short for \"alternative coins\") have been created. \nThe value problem.\nIn many cases, cryptocurrencies cannot be converted to real currencies; it is only possible to convert them to other cryptocurrencies, or to use them to buy things. Some cryptocurrencies can be converted to real currencies: They usually have a high volatility, and using them carries a high risk. They are also a target for so-called Pump-and-Dump-Attacks. They act like a big distributed economic system: as they are not issued or controlled by central banks, their value is difficult to influence: For this reason, they cannot really take the place of a stable currency.\nCryptocurrencies are prone to speculation, which makes building a system of more or less stable exchange rates very difficult. Another problem is the inequality of distribution: Many cryptocurrencires are held by only few people. As an example: about 1.000 people hold half of the total amount of bitcoins in the world. This means that if any of these people start using the Bitcoin that they own, this will have an effect on the exchange rate. It also means that these people have a great influence on the value of the currency, and are able to change its value easily. The currency itself only documents ownership changes. Exchange rates of cryptocurrencies are established outside the system. Exchange rates are issued by brokers and traders; their indication is no guarantee that the currency is traded at the value proposed. In itself, the unit of cryptocurrency has no value. \nIn contrast to cyptocurrencies, real currencies are controlled by central banks. Certain econnomic phenomena such as inflation or deflation may change the value (and exchange rate) of a currency. The people who own units of the currency have no direct influence on its value. \nFormal definition.\nAccording to Jan Lansky, a cryptocurrency is a system that meets six conditions:\nIn March 2018, the word \"cryptocurrency\" was added to the \"Merriam-Webster Dictionary\".\nCrypto mining.\nThe term crypto mining means gaining cryptocurrencies by solving cryptographic equations through the use of computers. This process involves validating data blocks and adding transaction records to a public record (ledger) known as a blockchain. "}

In the duodecimal system, large numbers are expressed by groups of 12. For example, the number fifty (which we usually write as 50) would be written as 42 in the dozenal system, since it is equal to 4\u00d712+2.\nThe number 12 is the smallest number that has four factors (2, 3, 4, 6). If one divide the numbers 10 and 12 with 3, the results will be 3.333... and 4, respectively. Doing the same thing with 6, the results will be 1.666... and 2. So, the duodecimal system can control the fractions better than the decimal system.\nHow to represent 10 and 11 in duodecimal.\nThere are no numerical symbols that represent 10 and 11 in duodecimal, so letters taken from the English alphabet are used, specifically X (from the Roman numeral for ten) and E (from the initial of eleven). Some people use A and B (as in hexadecimal) as well.\nEdna Kramer in her 1951 book \"The Main Stream of Mathematics\" used * and # for decimal 10 and 11.

Scott Bakker's major work is a series known as \"The Second Apocalypse,\" which he began developing in the 1980s. The series was first planned as series of three books.

He thought the title of this book was a spoiler for the first two books.\nBakker began writing the books in the early 2000s.

The medal was awarded for \"an act or acts of valour, courage or devotion to duty whilst flying in active operations against the enemy\".\nHistory.\nThe award was established on 3 June 1918, shortly after the formation of the Royal Air Force (RAF). It was originally awarded to RAF officers. During the Second World War, it was also awarded to Royal Artillery officers serving with the RAF as pilots and\u00a0artillery observers. In 1993 the medal replaced the Distinguished Flying Medal, which had until then been awarded to other ranks.\u00a0People awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross are allowed to use the post-nominal letters \"DFC\". A bar is added to the ribbon for holders of the DFC who received a second award.\nDuring the First World War, about 1,100 DFCs were awarded, with 70 first bars and 3 second bars. During the Second World War, 20,354 DFCs were awarded, the most of any award, with about 1,550 first bars and 45 second bars.\nHonorary awards were made on 964 occasions to people from other non-Commonwealth countries.\nDescription.\nThe decoration is a cross flory and is 2\u215b inches wide. The horizontal and bottom bars have bumps at the end, while the upper bar has a rose. The front of the medal has aeroplane propellers, placed on the vertical arms of the cross, and wings on the horizontal arms. In the centre is a laurel wreath around the RAF monogram, with a heraldic Imperial Crown\u00a0on the top.\nThe back of the medal has the Royal Cypher in the centre and the year of issue engraved on the lower arm. The decoration is issued named.\nThe ribbon was originally white with purple broad horizontal stripes. This was changed in 1919 to the current white with purple broad diagonal stripes.\nThe decoration was designed by Edward Carter Preston."}

In very basic terms, a blockchain combines the following two ideas:\nIn most cases, a blockchain is managed by a peer-to-peer network. All peers use a common protocol that specifies how they should communicate with each other, how a new block is created and validated. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be changed easily any more. Changing the block means all the blocks after it need to be changed as well. Depending on the protocol, this will require a majority of the peers, or even all the peers, to agree.\nBlockchains are secure by design. Blockchain technology is used where keeping a correct record is important. Use cases include medical records, identity management, food traceability, and voting.\nBlockchain was invented by Stuart Haber and Scott Stornetta in 1991 as a means to assure the integrity of digital records. Haber and Stornetta launched the world's first commercial blockchain; Surety in 1995.\nIn 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto included as references 3 and 4 of Bitcoin: A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System, the two papers by Haber and Stornetta to serve as the public transaction ledger of the cryptocurrency bitcoin. Because of its blockchain, bitcoin became the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server.

After the general election, she traveled to places like Flint, Michigan, and Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota by car. She spoke to people affected by the Flint water crisis and the Dakota Access Pipeline. While in Standing Rock, she said her trip there was an important reason why she ran for Congress. Before that, she believed that the only way to run for office and win was to have money and power. In North Dakota she saw others \"putting their whole lives and everything that they had on the line for the protection of their community\". This was the reason for her to begin to work for her own community. One day after she visited North Dakota, she got a phone call from Brand New Congress. They were looking for progressive candidates.

She said that candidates like here must have very new and different kinds of campaigns and cannot win just by spending more money Ocasio-Cortez's campaign did not take money from big companies or rich people. She did this because it was how Bernie Sanders's presidential campaign did it. Revolutionary posters from the past inspired her campaign posters.\nOcasio-Cortez was supported by progressive and civil rights groups such as MoveOn, Black Lives Matter, and Democracy for America, and by actress Cynthia Nixon.

Merriam-Webster said that searches for the word \"socialism\" went up 1,500% after she won. Crowley accepted his loss but did not call Ocasio-Cortez that night to wish her good luck. Many people thought he was going to run against her in the general election with a third party.\nBernie Sanders and Noam Chomsky wished her good luck and were happy about the results.

Neither Crowley nor the WFP party campaigned in the election. Both supported Ocasio-Cortez after her Democratic primary victory. Ocasio-Cortez said that the WEP was a centrist group that supported male politicians more than female politicians. Nixon ran against Governor Cuomo in the primary for New York Governor. Former Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman wanted Crowley to campaign on the WFP ballot to beat Ocasio-Cortez.

Ocasio-Cortez replied that \"the President's words [yesterday], telling four American Congresswomen of color \"go back to your own country,\" is [the] language of white supremacists. We don't leave the things that we love, and when we love this country, what that means is that we [find] the solutions to fix it.\" \nTrump falsely said that she called \"our country and our people 'garbage'\"; she had actually said that Americans should not be happy with average ideas that are \"10% better from garbage.\" Trump also falsely claimed that she said \"illegal immigrants are more American\" than Americans who tried to keep them out.

It was later found to be a\u00a0hoax.\u00a0It was built\u00a0in 1770 by Wolfgang von Kempelen\u00a0to impress the Empress Maria Theresa of Austria. The machine could\u00a0play chess against a human. It could also perform the knight's tour, a puzzle where a player moves a knight to every square of a chessboard exactly once.\nThe Turk was not a real machine, but a mechanical illusion. There was a person\u00a0inside the machine working the controls. With a skilled chess player hidden inside the box, the Turk won most of the games. It played and won games against many people including\u00a0Napoleon Bonaparte and Benjamin Franklin. The chess players who secretly worked inside the box included Johann Allgaier, Hyacinthe Henri Boncourt, Aaron Alexandre, William Lewis, Jacques Mouret, and William Schlumberger.\nHow the Turk was made.\nThe machine had a life-sized model of a human head and body, placed next to a large wooden box. The model was dressed in Ottoman robes and wore a turban. Its left arm held a long smoking pipe. The large box was about three-and-a-half feet (110\u00a0cm) long, two feet (60\u00a0cm) wide, and two-and-a-half feet (75\u00a0cm) high. On the top of the box was a chessboard, about 18 inches square. The front of the box had three doors, an opening, and a drawer. Inside the drawer was a red and white ivory chess set.\nThe inside of the box was very complicated. It was meant to trick those who looked into it. When the left front doors were opened you could see\u00a0clockwork\u00a0gears and cogs.\u00a0If the back doors of the box were open at the same time you could see through the machine. The other side of the box contained a red cushion and some removable parts.\u00a0This area also gave a clear view through the machine. Under the robes of the Turk were two more doors. When these were opened you could also see\u00a0the clockwork parts with a view right through the machine. The design allowed the presenter of the machine to open every door to the public, to keep the illusion.\nHowever the clockwork parts on the left side and the drawer did not go back as far as the back of the box. They only went one third of the way. This gave room for a sliding seat, so the person inside was able to slide from place to place. This meant they were not seen when the doors were opened. Moving the seat caused fake machinery to slide into its place to further hide the person inside the box.\nThe chessboard on the top of the box was thin. This allowed for a magnetic linkage. Each piece in the chess set had a small, strong magnet joined to its base. When placed on the board the pieces would attract a magnet attached to a string under their places on the board. The person inside the machine could see which pieces moved where on the chess board. The bottom of the chessboard was also numbered, 1\u201364, allowing the person to see which places on the board were affected by a player's move. The magnets were placed so that they were not affected by any magnets outside the box. Kempelen would let people from the audience put a large magnet next to the board to show that the machine was not influenced by magnetism.\nTo distract the audience, the Turk came with a small wooden\u00a0box. This would be put on the top of the box. Kempelen would look into into the small box during play, suggesting that it controlled the machine. The box was believed by some to have magic powers.\nInside the box was a chess board connected to a\u00a0series of levers. These controlled the model's left arm and could move it around the chess board.\u00a0The arm could be moved up and down, and turning the lever would open and close the Turk's hand. This let it pick up the chess pieces on the board. The machinery made a clockwork-type sound when the Turk made a move, further adding to the machinery illusion. The levers also made the Turk make various facial expressions. A voice box was added later, allowing the machine to say \"\u00c9chec!\" (French for \"check\") during matches.\nThe person inside and the presenter on the outside could send messages to each other. There were two brass discs with numbers on the inside and outside of the box. The discs could be turned to a number which acted as a code between the two.\nExhibition.\nThe first display of the Turk was in 1770 at Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace.\u00a0Kempelen showed everyone what he had built. He opened the doors and drawers of the cabinet, so the audience could look into the machine. It was then ready for a game.\nThe Turk would use the white pieces and have the first move. Between moves its left arm sat on a cushion. The Turk could nod twice if it threatened the other player's queen, and three times upon placing the king in check. If the other player made an illegal move, the Turk would shake its head, move the piece back. The first person to play against the Turk was Count Ludwig von Cobenzl, an Austrian courtier at the palace. He was quickly defeated.\nAnother part of the show was the knight's tour, a famed chess puzzle. The puzzle requires the player to move a knight around a chessboard, touching each square once along the way. While most experienced chess players of the time still struggled with the puzzle, the Turk was able to make the moves easily.\u00a0The person inside had a map of moves needed.\nThe Turk could also communicate with the audience using a letter board. It was\u00a0able to do this in English, French, and German. Carl Friedrich Hindenburg, a university mathematician, wrote down the conversations during the Turk's time in Leipzig and published it in 1789 as \"\u00dcber den Schachspieler des Herrn von Kempelen und dessen Nachbildung\" (or \"On the Chessplayer of Mr. von Kempelen And Its Replica\"). Questions included the Turk's age, marital status, and its secret workings.\nTour of Europe.\nInterest in the machine grew across Europe. Kempelen, however, was more interested in his other projects and did not want to show the Turk. He would tell people it was not working.\u00a0 After the performances\u00a0at the Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace the Turk only played Sir Robert Murray Keith, a Scottish noble. Kempelen took the machine to pieces after the match. Kempelen said the machine was a \"mere bagatelle\". He was not pleased with its popularity and would rather continue his work on steam engines and machines that could speak.\nIn 1781, Kempelen was ordered by Emperor Joseph II to rebuild the Turk and take it to Vienna for a state visit from Grand Duke Paul of Russia. This was so successful that Grand Duke Paul suggested a tour of Europe for the Turk. Kempelen reluctantly agreed.\nThe tour began in 1783, beginning in France. In\u00a0Paris,\u00a0 the Turk lost a match to Charles Godefroy de La Tour d'Auvergne, the Duc de Bouillon. People wanted the Turk to play a game\u00a0with Fran\u00e7ois-Andr\u00e9 Danican Philidor, the best chess player of his time. Philidor won, but it was \"his most fatiguing game of chess ever!\" The Turk's final game in Paris was against Benjamin Franklin, the United State's ambassador to France. Franklin enjoyed the game with the Turk and kept a copy of Philip Thicknesse's book \"The Speaking Figure and the Automaton Chess Player, Exposed and Detected\" in his personal library.\nAfter Paris, Kempelen moved the Turk to London, where it was on show every day at a cost of five shillings. Thicknesse, a skeptic, tried to explain that the machine was just a trick. He said Kempelen was \"a very ingenious man\", but the Turk was an elaborate hoax. He thought there was a small child inside the machine. The Turk was \"a complicated piece of clockwork\u00a0... which is nothing more, than one, of many other ingenious devices, to misguide and delude the observers\".\nAfter a year in London, Kempelen and the Turk went to Leipzig, Dresden, and\u00a0Amsterdam. After that the machine was\u00a0probably stored at the Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace for 20 years. Kempelen did try to sell it before his death. He died\u00a0at the age of 70 on 26 March 1804.\nM\u00e4lzel and the machine.\nIn 1805 Kempelen's son sold the machine to Johann Nepomuk M\u00e4lzel, a Bavarian musician interested in machines and devices. M\u00e4lzel had designed a type of metronome. He\u00a0had tried to purchase the Turk before Kempelen's death but the price was too high.\u00a0M\u00e4lzel had to learn how the machine worked and make some repairs. He wanted to make the Turk a greater challenge.\u00a0\nIn 1809, Napoleon I of France arrived at Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace to play the Turk. Before the game, the Turk, with Johann Baptist Allgaier\u00a0hidden inside,\u00a0saluted Napoleon.\u00a0In a surprise move, Napoleon took the first turn instead of allowing the Turk to make the first move. When\u00a0Napoleon attempted an illegal move,\u00a0the Turk put the piece back in its original spot and continued the game. After a second illegal move the Turk took the piece from the board. When\u00a0Napoleon tried a third illegal move the Turk swept its arm across, knocking all the pieces off the board. Napoleon was amused, and then played a real game with the machine. After 19 moves Napoleon pushed over his king to show that he knew he could not win, and was giving up.\u00a0\nIn 1811, M\u00e4lzel took the Turk to Milan to show Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais, the Prince of Venice and Viceroy of Italy. Beauharnais liked it so much, that he bought\u00a0the Turk for 30,000 francs \u2013 three times what M\u00e4lzel had paid \u2013 and kept it for four years. In 1815, M\u00e4lzel went to Beauharnais in Munich and bought the Turk back.\u00a0\nM\u00e4lzel took the Turk back to Paris where he made friends of many of the leading chess players at Caf\u00e9 de la R\u00e9gence. In 1818 he moved to London and held a number of performances with the Turk and many of his other machines. He\u00a0added a voice box so the machine could say \"\u00c9chec!\" when placing a player in check.\nM\u00e4lzel in America.\nIn 1826, M\u00e4lzel took the machine to\u00a0New York City.\u00a0M\u00e4lzel had problems finding people to operate the machine.\u00a0\u00a0He ended up bringing\u00a0William Schlumberger, from Alsace in Europe to come to America and work for him once again. M\u00e4lzel had to provide the money for Schlumberger's transport.\nIn\u00a0Boston, M\u00e4lzel told a story that the New York chess players could not handle full games and that the Boston players were much better. This was a success for many weeks, and the tour moved to Philadelphia for three months. In\u00a0Baltimore, it lost a match against Charles Carroll, a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Two American brothers built their own machine, the Walker Chess-player. M\u00e4lzel tried to buy it, but they would not sell it. This second machine toured for a number of years, but was never as famous as the Turk.\nBetween 1828, M\u00e4lzel visited Europe, returning to the States in 1829. In the 1830s, went as far west as the Mississippi River and visiting Canada. In Richmond, Virginia,\u00a0Edgar Allan Poe, wrote about the Turk for the \"Southern Literary Messenger\". Poe's essay \"Maelzel's Chess Player\" was published in April 1836 and is the most famous essay on the Turk.\nM\u00e4lzel took the Turk on his second tour to Havana, Cuba. In Cuba, Schlumberger died of yellow fever, leaving M\u00e4lzel without an operator.\u00a0M\u00e4lzel died at sea in 1838 at the age of 66 during his return trip, leaving his machine with the ship captain.\nFinal years and beyond.\nThe Turk was given to a friend of M\u00e4lzel's, the businessman John Ohl. He tried to sell it at auction but ended up buying it himself for $400. John Kearsley Mitchell, Edgar Allan Poe's doctor, bought the Turk from Ohl. Mitchell formed a club to fix it, completing the rebuilding in 1840.\nMitchell and his club gave the machine to the Chinese Museum of Charles Willson Peale. After a few shows it was put into a corner and forgotten. On 5 July 1854, a fire that started at the National Theater in Philadelphia reached the Museum and destroyed the Turk. Mitchell believed he had heard \"through the struggling flames\u00a0... the last words of our departed friend, the sternly whispered, oft repeated syllables, 'echec! echec!!'\nJohn Gaughan, an American in Los Angeles who made items for magicians, spent $120,000 building a copy of Kempelen's machine over a five-year period from 1984. The new machine used the Turk's chessboard, which was saved from the fire. Gaughan's Turk was displayed in November 1989 at a history of magic conference. This time, the Turk played against a computer running a chess program.\nRevealing the secrets.\nMost books and articles written during the Turk's life about how it worked were incorrect.\u00a0\nIt was not until Dr. Silas Mitchell's series of articles for \"The Chess Monthly\" that the secret was fully revealed. Mitchell, son of the final owner of the Turk, wrote that \"no secret was ever kept as the Turk's has been. Guessed at, in part, many times, no one of the several explanations\u00a0... ever solved this amusing puzzle\". As the Turk had been destroyed, Silas Mitchell felt that there were \"no longer any reasons for concealing from the amateurs of chess, the solution to this ancient enigma\".\nNew interest began in the Turk when IBM created\u00a0Deep Blue. This was a computer that could challenge the world's best players.\u00a0The Turk was used as a personification of Deep Blue in the 2003 documentary \"Game Over: Kasparov and the Machine\".\nLegacy and popular culture.\nThe Turk inspired a number of inventions and copies. These included the\u00a0Ajeeb, or \"The Egyptian\", built by Charles Hopper that President Grover Cleveland played in 1885; and Mephisto, the self-described \"most famous\" machine, of which little is known.\u00a0The\u00a0Walkers made the \"American Chess Player\" first shown in May 1827 in New York. El Ajedrecista was built in 1912 by Leonardo Torres y Quevedo and first shown at the Paris World Fair of 1914. It was the first true chess-playing automaton, and a precursor of sorts to Deep Blue.\nOther people were inspired by the Turk. The Rev. Edmund Cartwright\u00a0saw it in London in 1784. He later wrote \"it is more difficult to construct a machine that shall weave than one which shall make all the variety of moves required in that complicated game\". Cartwright would later invent the\u00a0power loom. Sir Charles Wheatstone, an inventor, saw the Turk while it was owned by M\u00e4lzel. M\u00e4lzel later showed his speaking machines to the researcher and his teenage son. Alexander Graham Bell read a copy of a book by Wolfgang von Kempelen on speaking machines after seeing a similar machine built by Wheatstone. Bell went on to invent the telephone.\nA play, \"The Automaton Chess Player\", was performed in New York City in 1845. The play used\u00a0a copy of the Turk made by J. Walker, who had earlier built the Walker Chess-player.\nRaymond Bernard's silent movie,\u00a0\"The Chess Player\" (\"The Chess Player\", France 1927), uses the story of the Turk in an adventure tale set during the\u00a0Partitions of Poland in 1772. A Polish nationalist escaping from the\u00a0 Russians, also happens to be an expert chess player. He is hidden inside a chess playing automaton called the Turk.\u00a0Just as he is about to escape over the border, the machine is taken to Saint Petersburg\u00a0for the empress Catherine II. Copying the Napoleon incident, Catherine attempts to cheat the Turk, who sweeps all the pieces from the board.\nThe Turk has been used novels and stories: \nIn 2005, Amazon.com launched the Amazon Mechanical Turk. The program is designed to have humans perform tasks with which computers struggle, such as color comparisons."}

He is known for his chess-playing \"automaton\" hoax, The Turk, and for his speaking machine.\nPersonal life.\nVon Kempelen was born in Pressburg, part of the Kingdom of Hungary. He was the last child of Engelbert Kempelen (1680\u20131761), and Anna Theresa Spindler.\u00a0\nHe studied law and philosophy in Pressburg, and attended the Academy in Gy\u0151r, Vienna and Rome. He was interested\u00a0in mathematics and physics.\u00a0He spoke German, Hungarian, Latin, French, Italian. Later, during his travels he learned\u00a0English and Romanian. His first job was in 1755 as a clerk in the Hungarian Court Chamber in Pozsony. Later he became a secretary (1757), a Councillor of the Court Chamber (1764), Director of Salt Mining (1765), Second Commissioner of the Constitutional Commission for the Region of Banat (1769), and finally Imperial-Royal Court Councillor (1787). He also helped move the University of Nagyszombat to Buda Castle, and looked after the building of the Court Theatre in Buda's old Carmelite monastery.\nHe married twice, first in 1757 to Maria Franziska Piani, who died in 1758, and again in 1762 to Maria Anna von Gobelius.\u00a0Five children were born from his second marriage, of whom two survived into adulthood: Maria Theresia (1768\u20131812) and Karl (1771\u20131822).\nInventions.\nVon Kempelen was most famous for his construction of The Turk, a chess-playing automaton presented to Maria Theresa of Austria in 1769. The machine had a life-sized model of a human head and body, dressed in Turkish robes and wearing a turban. It was seated behind a large wooden box on with a chessboard on the top. The machine could play a game of chess against a human\u00a0opponent. But it was a trick. There was a person, a skilled chess player, hidden inside the box.\u00a0The Turk was a really a puppet, worked from below by levers. The Turk won most of the games played during its shows around Europe and the Americas for nearly 84 years. It played and defeated many people including Napoleon Bonaparte and Benjamin Franklin.\nKempelen also built a\u00a0speaking machine. One of them can still be seen in the Musical Instruments section of the Deutsches Museum in Munich. In 1789, he published a book of his 20 years of speech research, \"Mechanismus Der Menschlichen Sprache Nebst Beschreibung Seiner Sprechenden Maschine\".\nHe also built steam-engines, waterpumps, a pontoon bridge in Pressburg (1770), patented a steam turbine for mills (1788/89) and a typewriter for the blind Viennese pianist Maria Theresia von Paradis (1779), and built a theatre house in Buda opened on 25 October 1790 (now Budapest) and the famous fountains at Sch\u00f6nbrunn in Vienna (1780). He was also an artist, wrote poems and epigrams, and composed a \"singspiel\", \"Andromeda and Perseus\", performed in Vienna.\nRetirement and death.\nHe retired in 1798, after 43 years of service to the Austrian Empire. In 1771, Maria Theresia gave von Kempelen an annual pension of 1,000 ducats. After her death, her son Joseph II\u00a0cut the pensions given to the court's civil servants. In 1802, he tried to get his pension back from\u00a0Francis II, and also asked for compensation of 20,000 Gulden, but was not granted.\nAt the time of his death in 1804, he owned a country estate in Gomba near Pozsony, but died in his apartment in Alser, a suburb of Vienna.\nThe Wolfgang von Kempelen Computing Science History Prize was named in his honor, as was a high school in Budapest."}

He was also a long-time leader of the Social Democratic Party of Finland.\nEarly years.\nKalevi Sorsa went to school in Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4 and Lappeenranta. \nAt the age of 18 Sorsa's involvement with SDP politics started in Lappeenranta. In 1969, he was brought in from relative obscurity by Rafael Paasio, former Finnish prime minister, to assume the influential post of party secretary, despite not having much previous experience of national politics. \nA 2008 book by historian Jukka Seppinen suggested that Sorsa was at this date already receiving support from Soviet backers in the KGB. Prior to his political career, Sorsa worked in Paris for UNESCO from 1959 to 1965, and was Secretary-General of the Finnish UNESCO board from 1965 to 1969.

During his career he also served twice as Deputy Prime Minister, from 1975 to 1976 and from 1987 to 1989. From 1987 to 1996, Sorsa served on the governing board of the Bank of Finland.\nSorsa is regarded as one of Finland's most influential prime ministers, making major contributions to schools and health care, and increasing social security for families with children and pensioners. His governments strengthened the welfare state in Finland, by enacting many reforms\u2014child care laws, longer maternity leave, the annual vacation benefit act, as well as the public health act.\nIn domestic politics, Sorsa had a particularly difficult relationship with Paavo V\u00e4yrynen, the strong-willed head of the Center Party. Another notable conflict was his rivalry with young rising politician Paavo Lipponen.\nIn June 1984, Sorsa gave a speech on \"infocracy\" (i.e. the power of the mass media) at the Social Democratic party convention. Infocracy challenges parliamentary democracy, is unintelligent and avoids discussing social problems, he said: it takes more interest in individual politicians than political issues and is never critical of its own actions."}

He is best known for the Lewis Countergambit and for being the first player ever to be described as a Grandmaster of the game.\nLife and works.\nBorn in Birmingham, William Lewis moved to London where he worked for a merchant.\u00a0He became a student of chess player Jacob Sarratt. In later years he showed himself to be very unkind to his old teacher. He said Sarratt's \"Treatise on the Game of Chess\" (1808)\u00a0was a \"poorly written book\". But in 1822 three years after Sarrat died, Lewis published a second edition of it. This was in competition with a much better revision by Sarrat published in 1821 by Sarratt's poverty-stricken widow. In 1843, many players gave money to help the old widow, but Lewis' name is not on the list.\nAround 1819 Lewis was the hidden player inside the Turk, a fake chess playing machine. He told\u00a0Johann Maelzel that Peter Unger Williams, also a student of Sarratt, should be the next person to operate inside the machine. Maezel took his advice and\u00a0Williams replaced Lewis.\nLewis began writing books including translations of the works of Greco and Carrera, published in 1819 and 1822.\nHe was the leading English player in a game played by letters sent between London and Edinburgh in 1824, won by the Scots. He wrote a book on the match with analysis of the games. In 1834\u201336 he was on the Committee of the Westminster Chess Club. They lost games played by letter with the Paris Chess Club. The other players were his students McDonnell and Walker, while the French team included Boncourt, Alexandre, St. Amant and Chamouillet. When De La Bourdonnais visited England in 1825, Lewis played about 70 games with the French master.\nLewis was known as a famous chess player in his time. The weekly magazine \"Bell's Life\" in 1838 called him \"our past grandmaster\", the first known use of the term in chess.\u00a0In 1825 he began\u00a0a chess club where he taught people to play the game. He wrote two books on how to play chess, the\u00a0Series of Progressive Lessons (1831) and Second Series of Progressive Lessons (1832).\u00a0\nLewis's books, and those of his teacher Sarratt, were based on reworking\u00a0Philidor's ideas\u00a0to those of the Modenese school of Del Rio, Lolli and Ponziani. Lewis gradually stopped playing competition chess.\u00a0\nAfter his retirement he wrote other chess books, but he was no longer up to date with new ideas. The\u00a0Oxford Chess Companion said his last book,\u00a0\"A Treatise on Chess\" (1844),\u00a0was already \"out of date when published\"."}

{"id": "645697", "revid": "1061539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=645697", "title": "Data Center Cooling", "text": "Data cooling is one of the most fundamental IT environment processes especially when it concerns a data center. As the new computer hardware becomes more compact while using the same amount or at times more electricity than the one that has been replaced, more heat is being produced inside the data centers. For collecting and transferring the remaining heat energy to the external atmosphere, accurate air conditioning and heat removal equipment is needed. The main goal is to transfer and transport unutilized heat energy from the IT environment to the external atmosphere.\nMonitoring our service in real-life situations can be proved most of the times also equally important. With specific environmental sensors we can regulate,monitor and control data center\u2019s temperature, airflow and hotspots and in general be aware of the quality of the \u201cinternal\u201d environment and temperature in the data center.\nA computer room air conditioning (CRAC) unit is an apparatus that controls and maintains environmental features in the data center like temperature and humidity. While CRAC units makes use of mechanical refrigeration, a computer room air handler (CRAH) uses fans, cooling coils and a water-chiller system to remove heat.\nTypes of Data Center Cooling Techniques.\nThe aim of cooling is to transfer heat from the data center (indoor environment) to the outside environment. There are two basic approaches for removing the remaining heat, either using air or liquid (typically water).\nAir Cooling.\nAir cooling has some important advantages as it\u2019s practically easy to move and it doesn\u2019t provoke any damage to the IT apparatus. Since heat flows from the warmer objects to the cooler ones and warm air is increasing with respect to cold air this means that can make us distinguish them in some level. In fact many manufacturers of air-based cooling designs consider this particular property while constructing IT equipment.\nRoom based cooling, as an air cooling system, uses the most classical type of refrigerating technique: the basic idea is that coolers push cold air in the environment, extracting warm air to the outside. Conditioners not only refresh, but also mix the air to avoid hot spots. This idea results to be efficient if the power load used for mixing the air is a small fraction of the total load of the datacenter. Simulations show that this approach is valid for relatively low power load densities (320-750 formula_1). Sometimes, when warm and hot air are being mixed the previous distinction is not plausible and this is where issues arise.\nHot/Cold Aisle Configuration.\nHot/cold aisle is a format for racks of servers and generally IT apparatus inside a data center where the rack fronts face the rack fronts of the adjacent row. When cold aisle containment approach is used, row doors, aisle ceilings or overhead vertical walls are installed to contain the cold air coming from the cooling systems into the cold aisles. As the opposite, in hot aisle containment the hot air is contained so that the CRAC units just receive hot air.\nThe aim of this configuration is to decrease the amount of produced energy and reduce the costs regarding the cooling process by controlling the air flow.\nBlanking Panels.\nIf racks have empty space that it is not used then extra heat is being released into data center\u2019s airflow in order to \u201cfill in\u201d this unused space.The use of blanking panels can prevent the hot air from being transmitted in the data center\u2019s airflow.\nRack Placement.\nThe top of the rack is considered to be the location which produces the greatest amount of heat. So, the specific placement of the racks can reduce the heat circulation from racks hot spots. The way that we can regulate this issue is by ordering rack components in a way that the more loaded equipment is placed on the lower racks and in such way we can ensure an optimal cooling. Since heavier equipment flow the most air, a lower rack placement will ensure that less heat is spreaded at the top of the rack.\nFree Cooling.\nThe free cooling method is composed of two main systems: the air-side economization and the water-side economization. The first one basically uses the air that comes from the outer environment in order to control and adjust the desired temperature in the IT apparatus. This technique is quite productive with respect to its cost (since we just take advantage of air from the external environment) but on the other hand has some disadvantages since it is likely to provoke humidity and moisture in the data center.\nIn a similar way, water-side economization works with air from the outdoors and is commonly used with evaporation processes.\nLiquid Cooling.\nLiquid cooling can improve the efficiency of a data center as it provides an optimal and more targeted cooling. For example chilled water can be transferred directly to a rack of servers which is quite helpful as we want to provide cooling to specific places. Instead of trying to \u201cbalance\u201d a desirable temperature throughout an entire room, it initializes the cooling process in the exact point that is needed; at a particular rack or cabinet. On the other hand, the use of liquid-based systems inside a data center could have some cons. Possible leaks are definitely a huge threat for the entire IT apparatus, transport of liquid may cause condensation and since the chilled liquid must be contained somewhere it requires more technological equipment and a suitable framework inside the data center; so in this case we need more resources. For the above reasons, although liquid-based systems are proved to be more reliable and effective, they appear to be quite expensive with respect to air cooling techniques and slightly more difficult to implement.\nSingle Phase Cooling.\nUsing the setup of a liquid-based system, here the IT apparatus can be cooled by using water, or alternative cooling liquids to be pumped at server or rack level: cold plates are located as close as possible to the heat generating components. This technology makes use of the higher heat transfer capacity of the liquids, leading to greater savings in terms of energy requirement, in fact, single phase cooling systems can reduce, and sometimes eliminate needing for CRAC units.\nOne of the most important disadvantages is that they require high pumping power. Other side effects are microbe formation, electrical conductivity of the liquids and erosive nature due to high fluid velocities.\nAs the surface to be cooled increases, it is more difficult to achieve isothermality.\nThe main advantage, following an on-chip cooling approach is that, since direct discharge liquid stream is used, the energy capture is easier, permitting the waste heat recovery.\nOne of the pioneers of this technology has been , with the Aquasar supercomputer, in 2009.\nTwo-phase Cooled Systems.\nTwo-phase cooling means using devices that can transform at least part of the cooling fluids into vapour when in contact with warm IT components. The phase transition permits a much more efficient heat exchange, in terms of cooling medium mass: in other words: to exchange a fixed amount of heat, two-phase cooling uses less refrigerating liquid in comparison with the quantity which is necessary in single-phase cooling.\nIt was shown how, using multiphase systems, 4 times less mass-flow rates, 10 times less pumping power and 2 times less facility size.\nThe core of the evaporator is composed by a mini or heat-sink by which the plate surface is maximized; minichannels have a pitch of 2 to 8 mm, while microchannels have a pitch of less than 1 mm. Microchannels are more capable in transferring the heat thanks to their higher surface, but they are more easily clogged, corroded and eroded.\nCooling System Alternatives.\nThere are many options available to services or IT experts when it comes to specifying cooling solutions. These options may differ according to the size or the particular type of the solution needed.\nAirflow direction.\nReferring to the airflow process, large floor-mounted systems flow air in a downward direction (leading towards a lower flow level) or an upward direction (leading towards a higher flow level) and some can even flow horizontally (leading towards a horizontal flow level).\nFire, smoke, and water detection devices.\nThese devices are best used in combination with IT monitoring and building management systems for quicker notification. They also provide early warning or automatic shut off during undesirable events. \nHumidifiers.\nAs a device that increases humidity, humidifiers can play an important role in the cooling process by preventing any unexpected overheating which may occur due to static electrical discharge.They are usually placed inside precision cooling devices in order to replace water vapor lost during the cooling process. Reassuring that the room has no current high or low humidity-related issues, the use of humidifiers can be in all computer room air conditioners and air handlers.\nReheat systems.\nWhen performing the particular technique, rooms should not have vapor barriers and also room temperatures should suggest humid climates. These systems in order to let the whole system provide increased dehumidification of the \"internal\" air, they add heat to conditioned cold air coming out of a precision cooling device.\nEconomizer coils.\nThe advantage of using this approach is that it provides a surprisingly operating cost reduction when used.In this approach, (ethylene glycol) is used to cool the IT environment in a way which is similar to a chilled water system.\nInsights.\nData centers technology is quite complex and advanced and this has as a result to require huge amounts of energy. Therefore, data centers need to be as efficient as possible and data environmental control has a significant role to this issue.\nThe recommended temperature for a data center is estimated between 21\u00b0C and 24\u00b0C. In addition to,some studies regarding the desired temperature in a data center shown that maybe it is not so optimal (money-wise) for firms to keep the temperature below 21\u00b0C. Furthermore, typical data center limit temperatures have been estimated to be 85\u00b0C for processors and DIMMs, while disk drives can usually work in stricter conditions, at a maximum of 45\u00b0C. \nIt is also remarkable that, while the conventional heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems (HVAC) for similar size rooms deal with heat fluxes in the order of 40-90 formula_1, cooling systems in data centers work with extremely higher heat loads: modern data center infrastructures can need to refresh apparatus that produces 6-10 formula_3 as power density. In the next few years, it is estimated that the power density consumption will still raise up to 15 formula_3.\nGoogle for instance mentions the significance of taking serious action to reinforce energy efficiency in case of either running a small data center or a huge service. According to Google, many manufactures construct the suitable equipment to be used at temperatures higher than the standard 21\u00b0C we aforementioned. This may lead to next generation servers having the ability of performing at higher temperatures, fact that can make data center using less equipment and therefore save money. So for an effective management and control data centers should be able to perform accurate temperature analysis by measuring the amount of energy spent for processes that concern cooling.Nevertheless, the best solution may be consulting the corresponding equipment manufacturer so with his expertise can point out the suitable approach. \nMany opinions of experts about this subject point out that data centers could have better performance if they could adopt a mixture of cooling methods. Another important factor that could drastically contribute to an optimal performance is the location where data centers are placed. Constructing data centers either in places with cooler climates or near to sources of cold water not only could increase energy efficiency in a high level but also could reduce costs by deploying the external environment."}

There is no need to talk about the particular manner in which the surface is embedded in the surrounding three-dimensional Euclidean space. In other words, the Gaussian curvature of a surface does not change if one bends the surface without stretching it. \nGauss presented the theorem in this manner (translated from Latin):\nThe theorem is \"remarkable\" because the starting \"definition\" of Gaussian curvature makes direct use of the position of the surface in space. So it is quite surprising that the result does \"not\" depend on its embedding in spite of all bending and twisting deformations undergone."}

The Marathas are given much of the credit for ending Mughal rule in India.\nThe Marathas were a warrior people from the western Deccan Plateau (present-day Maharashtra) that rose to prominence by establishing \"self-rule of Hindu/Indian people\" in their region. The Marathas became prominent in the 17th century under the leadership of Shivaji who revolted against the Adil Shahi dynasty and the Mughal Empire and formed a kingdom with Raigad as his capital. Known for their mobility, the Marathas were able to consolidate their territory during the Mughal\u2013Maratha Wars and later controlled a large part of the Indian subcontinent. Their power was eventually ended by the series of wars they fought against the British."}

He became the chess teacher of the future Louis Philippe I. He was one of the most successful operators of The Turk, a famous chess-playing machine.\nBiography.\nMouret was a great-nephew of the famous chess player\u00a0Philidor. He learned the game at the Caf\u00e9 de la R\u00e9gence, taught by Bernard and Carlier, two of\u00a0Philidor's students. He was a pupil of Alexandre Deschapelles and later he became a teacher of La Bourdonnais. He also gave chess lessons to the children of the French King Louis Philippe I. In 1819, he was the operator of The Turk during its tour in England and probably the person, who sold the secret of The Turk to the press.\nMouret was an alcoholic. In 1842 the editor of the chess magazine\u00a0\"Le Palam\u00e8de\", said\u00a0 \"\"He was a clever fellow, sharp, gay, lively, amusing, and had studied seriously the theory of chess, by which he made his living. His talent redeemed a little the rudeness of his manner and a certain licentiousness which he indulged in. He used to be in a continual state of semi-intoxication\".\u00a0George Walker wrote that \"His brain was consumed in the Brandy\"\".\nMouret was believed to have written a book in 1836,\u00a0\"The Treaty Elementary Game of Chess.\"\u00a0But later evidence shows that he only made some corrections to the text.\nHe had no money when he died and so the members of the Chess Club of Paris paid for his funeral.\nMouret and \"The Turk\".\nMouret is best known as the person hidden inside\u00a0The Turk, a fake chess-playing machine. Mouret was one of many great chess players who worked inside the machine, others being Johann Baptist Allgaier, who defeated Napoleon in 1809, Schlumberger, Boncourt and Lewis. Fifty games played by Mouret from inside the Turk in London in 1819, are collected in a book published in 1820.\u00a0In the beginning of\u00a0the book it was written that out of 300 games, the Turk (Mouret) only lost six.\u00a0\nMouret's weakness for drinking often left him without any money, so he probably sold the secret of the Turk in 1834 to \"Le Magasin picturesque\". The article,\u00a0\"An attempt to analyze the automaton chess-player of M. Kempelen\", explained how a man could be hidden inside the Turk. Mouret was not named, but many people. including\u00a0Walker, believe he was the source. The French master was sick and short of money at the time, and died three years later.\nThe French Defense.\nMouret often used a move now called the French Defense.\u00a0He was one of the only players to use it and is one of the main reasons for it being called the French Defense. Mouret taught the move to players at the\u00a0Caf\u00e9 de la R\u00e9gence.\u00a0One of his students\u00a0convinced the Paris team to use the defense in games played by letters against a London team.\u00a0Following the victory of the French team, the opening quickly became known as the French Defense."}

The heated water then flows to a steam generator where it transfers heat to a secondary system where steam is generated. The steam flows to a steam turbine which spins an electric generator. The used steam is condensed and returned to the steam generator for re-use. PWRs use ordinary water as both coolant and neutron moderator."}

Many people think it was an\u00a0 important event leading up to the American Revolution. The case was about the payment of clergy of the Anglican Church\u00a0in Virginia. At the time, a lot of tobacco was planted in Virginia. It was one of the commodity crops of the colony. The colony of Virginia had passed laws in 1748: These laws said that Virginia's Anglican clergy were to be paid 16,000 pounds of tobacco per year. \nThe problem was that the harvest of tobacco was poor in 1758. Because of that, the price of tobacco in Virginia rose from from two to six pennies per pound. This also meant the salary of clergy effectively tripled, that year. The state of Virginia was forced to act, and passed a law called the \"Two Pennies Act\": This law allowed the state authorities to pay the clergy in currency, instead of tobacco. It also fixed the exchange rate of tobacco: it said that for these payments, the state should take a rate of two\u00a0 pennies per pound of tobacco.\u00a0 King George III of Great Britain vetoed the law, causing an uproar in the colony. Many Virginia legislators saw the king's veto as a breach of their legislative authority.\nColonel John Henry, father of Patrick Henry, was the judge who presided over the court case and jury that decided the issue. Patrick Henry was the person who argued in favor of colonial rights in the case. He was relatively unknown at the time.\nThe Reverend James Maury had sued in Hanover County Court (April 1, 1762) for back wages on behalf of all the ministers involved: he effectively became a representative of the British cause. The court ruled (Nov. 5, 1763) that Maury's claim was valid, but that a jury had to determine the amount of damages. This jury was called for in December 1763. Patrick Henry rose to prominence by defending Hanover County against Maury's claims. Henry argued in favor of the Two Penny Act. As reported by the plaintiff Maury in a letter (Dec. 12, 1763) to fellow Anglican minister John Camm shortly after the trial, Henry argued in substance \"that a King, by disallowing Acts of this salutary nature, from being the father of his people, degenerated into a Tyrant and forfeits all right to his subjects' obedience.\"\nThe jury awarded Maury one penny in damages. The award essentially nullified the Crown veto, and no other clergy sued.\nThe Hanover County Courthouse is still operating; historic U.S. Route 301 passes by it. The courthouse is next to the Hanover Tavern, where Patrick Henry lived while arguing the Parson's Cause. It is the third oldest courthouse still in use in the United States. The state historic office dates the building's construction between 1737 and 1742."}

The surface of the world is mostly covered with water, and all major animal phyla started life in the water.\nThe earliest fossils we have are those of stromatolites, which are mat-like structures formed by photosynthetic bacteria in the sea. Even animals which evolved on land have often returned to the water, even though they usually continue to breath air. There are aquatic insects, reptiles, mammals and birds.\nWe don't quite know when the first animals and plants evolved, but some guesstimates have been made. Acritarchs are present from about 3200 to 1400 million years ago to the present. That's a wide time-range which means we cannot be sure when they evolved. They seem to have been grazed (eaten) by some early forms of life. Probably some kind of protist developed using existing life forms as food.\nLocomotion is needed to find the right place in the seas, and to eat and avoid being eaten. All advanced forms of life, and many primitive forms of life, use locomotion.\nPropulsion systems.\nMicroorganisms.\nThe simplest propulsive systems evolved in microorganisms. Cilia and flagella are used.\nSwimming has evolved a number of times in more complex life-forms. Examples include arthropods, fish, molluscs, reptiles, birds, and mammals.\nCiliates have hundreds or thousands of small flagella called cilia to move through the water. Certain organisms such as bacteria and animal sperm have a flagellum to move in liquid environments.\nInvertebrates.\nAll aquatic invertebrates swim at some stage in their lives, and many swim for their entire life. All jellyfish swim by pulsing their cup-shaped bodies. Crustaceans swim with their legs. Some molluscs swim all their lives, some only as larvae.\nSquid and octopods swim quite vigorously by 'jet propulsion'. They squirt water out to move.\nThere are a very large number of insects which are aquatic as larvae or adults. Almost all use their legs for swimming. They are air-breathing, and carry air with them as they swim. The air they get from the surface of the water, and take it down with them. Usually, the air is trapped among dense hairs on their surfaces. 13 orders of insects have aquatic stages, including all mayflies and dragonflies, and many beetles, bugs, and flies.\nVertebrates.\n[to come]"}

It is a \"ribonucleoprotein\" (a protein-RNA complex). It recognizes and targets specific proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotes and the plasma membrane of prokaryotes.\nWhen the SRP-ribosome complex binds to a cell membrane receptor, SRP releases the ribosome and drifts away. The ribosome resumes protein synthesis, but now the protein is moving through the SRP-receptor transmembrane pore. So, SRP directs the movement of proteins within the cell. It binds with a transmembrane pore. This allows the protein to cross the membrane to where it is needed. In eukaryotes, the target is the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).\nThe SRP is 'universally conserved'. That means it is so important that \"all living things have it in their cells\". Despite this, the actual composition of the SRP varies greatly between organisms."}

It refers to information gathered and steps taken to counter espionage. Other intelligence activities are taken to prevent sabotage, or assassinations by foreign powers, organizations or persons. Activities are taken against international terrorist groups and personnel. Work is done on physical, document or communications security programs.\nOften counterintelligence at home is done by a different department from gathering intelligence abroad. For example, in the United Kingdom, there is a distinction between the Security Service (MI5) and the Special Branch of the Metropolitan Police. Arrests and interrogation is done by Special Branch. Gathering intelligence abroad is done by MI6, the Secret Intelligence Service.\nIn theory, the USA has a similar division between foreign activities and homeland activities. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is a domestic security service. The CIA has no law enforcement function and does overseas intelligence gathering, with only limited domestic intelligence collection. In practice, the set-up is much more complex, and ever-changing. For one thing, the career of James Angleton and also the Watergate scandal shows how the CIA has been involved in mainland USA. The addition of the United States Department of Homeland Security was a recognition that the United States was itself a potential target of attack by its various enemies.\nRussia may have been the first country to set up an official counterintelligence organisation: the Okhrana was set up in 1880. Its title 'Department for Protecting the Public Security and Order'. sounds very modern. There was an even earlier Russian security department called the 'Department on Protecting the Order and Public Peace'. It was founded in 1866. It would be fair to say that these Russian organisations were not directed towards foreign intelligence services, but against internal threats to public order. They were part of the MVD (Ministry of the Interior)."}

The emperor Ashoka ordered it to be built,in the 3rd century BCE. Its center was a simple dome-like brick structure built over the relics of the Buddha. It was crowned by the \"chatra\", a parasol-like structure symbolising high rank. This structure was intended to honour and shelter the relics. The original construction work of this stupa was overseen by Ashoka, whose wife Devi was the daughter of a merchant of nearby Vidisha. Sanchi was her birthplace as well as the place of her wedding with Ashoka. In the 1st century BCE, four elaborately carved toranas (ornamental gateways) and a balustrade encircling the entire structure were added. The Sanchi Stupa built during Mauryan period was made of bricks. The composite flourished until the 11th century.\nSanchi is the center of a region with a number of stupas including Satdhara (17\u00a0km from Sanchi, 40 stupas, the Relics of Sariputra and Mahamoggallana, now enshrined in the new Vihara, were unearthed there), Morel Khurd (on a fortified hilltop with 60 stupas), Andher (17\u00a0km NE of Vidisha), Mawas, Sonari etc. all within a few miles of Sanchi."}

The Mexican theoretical physicist Miguel Alcubierre created this idea using Albert Einstein's field equations in general relativity. The main principle of this idea is by creating an energy-density field lower than that of a vacuum (that is, negative mass) to make the space in front of the ship contract and the space behind the ship expand. In theory, this would create a bubble in space-time around the craft, allowing it to stay still while the space around it moves. This would effectively avoid breaking Einstein's rule that no object in our universe may go as fast or faster than the speed of light, while still allowing an object to go to another very distant part of space much faster than light."}

The Italian influence in Mogadishu lasted 80 years, from 1880 until 1960, when the city grew from a small city of just two thousand inhabitants to a metropolis of nearly half a million \"mogadiscians\" in the metropolitan area.\nHistory.\nThe ancient city of Mogadishu was under Italian colonial rule/influence for nearly seventy years, from the 1880s until after the end of WW2. In 1905 was declared capital of the newly created \"Somalia Italiana\".\nThe first Italian to write about Mogadiscio was Marco Polo, who knew of the city during his merchant travels in Asia. But only in the late XIX century the commerce company \"Filonardi\" from Italy took control of facilities in the port of Mogadishu.\nBy 1882, Mogadishu was under the joint control of the Somali Geledi Sultanate (which was also holding sway over the Shebelle Valley region in the interior called Benadir) and the Omani Sultan of Zanzibar. In 1885, Ali bin Said leased the city to an Italian chartered company owned by Vincenzo Filonardi. This \"Compagnia Filonardi\" (1893-96) and later the \"Societ\u00e0 Anonima Commerciale Italiana del Benadir\" (1899-1905) was finally taken by the Italian government, that obtained the control of the entire region of Benadir with the port of Mogadishu through an agreement with the British government in 1892. From 3 August 1889 to 15 May 1893 Filonardi was the first Governor of the \"Somalia italiana\" (he was governor again from 1896 to 1897).\nThe Kingdom of Italy purchased the city in 1905 and made Mogadishu the capital of the newly established Italian Somaliland. The Italians subsequently referred to the city as \"Mogadiscio\".\nThe city was soon modernized in the early 1910s with the creation of the first sewage system, the first hospital, the first paved roads and the new electricity facilities. In the 1920s the Italians created the first airport and enlarged the \"Port of Mogadishu\".\nFrom 5 April 1908 to 5 May 1936, the Royal Corps of Somali Colonial Troops (\"Regio corpo truppe coloniali della Somalia Italiana\"), originally called the \"Guard Corps of Benadir\", served as the territory's formal military corps with headquarters in Mogadiscio. At the start of its establishment, the force had 2,600 Italian officers. Between 1911 and 1912, over 1,000 Somalis from Mogadishu served as combat units along with Eritrean and Italian soldiers in the Italo-Turkish War. Most of the troops stationed never returned home until they were transferred back to Italian Somaliland in preparation for the Second Italo-Ethiopian War in 1935.\nIn November 1920, the Banca d'Italia, the first modern bank in Italian Somaliland, was established in Mogadishu.\nOn December 5, 1923, Cesare Maria De Vecchi was named Governor in charge of the new colonial administration and promoted the process of complete pacification of the Somalia italiana, with the initial integration of the native population. Italian colonial policy followed two principles in Italian Somaliland: preservation of the dominant clan and ethnic configurations and respect for Islam as the territory's religion.\nIn 1928, the Italian authorities built the Mogadishu Cathedral (\"Cattedrale di Mogadiscio\"). It was constructed in a Norman Gothic style, based on the Cefal\u00f9 Cathedral in Cefal\u00f9, Sicily. Following its establishment, Crown Prince Umberto II of Italy made his first publicized visit to Mogadishu. To commemorate the visit, the Arch of Umberto was constructed. The arch was built at the center of Mogadishu Garden. The Mogadishu International Airport was constructed that same year. The facility was regarded as one of the finest in the region.\nIn the early 1930s, the new Italian Governors, Guido Corni and Maurizio Rava, started a policy of full assimilation of the Somalis. Many Somalis were enrolled in the Italian colonial troops, and thousands of Italian colonists moved to live in Mogadishu. The city grew in size and some small manufacturing companies opened up. The Italians also settled in agricultural areas around the capital, such as Jowhar and Janale (\"Genale\").\nIt is noteworthy to pinpoint that \"Mogadiscio\" was the only name of Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, when was officially under Italy's rule from 1905 until February 1947. The only official language in those years was the Italian language.\nIn 1930, there were 22,000 Italians living in Italian Somaliland, representing 2% of the territory's population. The majority resided in the capital Mogadishu, with other Italian communities concentrated in Jowhar (\"Villabruzzi\"), Adale (\"Itala\"), Janale (\"Genale\"), Jamame and Kismayo. In the mid' 1930s the Italian community of Mogadishu started the first football championships in Somalia: their main team was AC Mogadiscio.\nBy 1935, Mogadishu began to serve as a major naval base and port for the Italians. Then Prime Minister of Italy Benito Mussolini regarded Greater Somalia (\"La Grande Somalia\") with capital Mogadiscio as the crown jewel in Italy's colonial empire in eastern Africa. Consequently, from 1936 to 1940, new roads were constructed in the region around Mogadiscio, such as the \"Imperial Road\" from Mogadishu to Addis Abeba. New railways (114\u00a0km from Mogadishu to Jowhar) and many schools, hospitals, ports and bridges were also built.\nIn March 1941 Mogadiscio was occupied by the British Army. Because of security reasons, nearly all the Italians of Somalia moved to live in Mogadiscio, so consequently in 1942 it was a city where the Italians were nearly half the population and where the Catholicism was the religion of nearly 60% of the inhabitants. According to reports of the British authorities, Mogadiscio in 1942 looked mostly like an european city (nicknamed \"the white pearl of the Indian Ocean\").\nAfter WW2, in February 1947 the Italian government signed the Peace Treaty (surrendering all colonies) and \"Italian Mogadiscio\" ceased to exist.\nin 1950 the Italians returned to rule the city under mandate of the ONU for another ten years until 1960, when was declared the independence of Somalia. In the 10 years of the Italian mandate the country experience huge improvements, from economy and education to sports (for example with the creation of the first football teams, like the Genio Officina and the AC Mogadiscio."}

The lyrics were written by the physician and journalist Vicente Salias in 1810. The music was later composed by musician Juan Jos\u00e9 Landaeta. It is said, however, that the melody has been known since 1840 as \"La Marsellesa Venezolana\" (\"Venezuelan Marseillaise\"), in reference to its subtle similarity to the French national anthem.\nSome recent investigations have suggested that the real author of the anthem was Andr\u00e9s Bello, and not Salias, to whom it was originally credited, and the music was composed by another musician called Lino Gallardo. However, this theory has yet to be proven, and lacks any real recognition among the general Venezuelan population, historians, or otherwise.\nUsage.\nThe Venezuelan national anthem is played every day on radio and television broadcasts at 12:00 am, 6:00 am and 12:00 pm (either the full version or the chorus, first stanza and chorus) on all national TV networks. On radio broadcasts, the state anthem is played after the national anthem, which is also the case in state TV stations. \nIn most occasions, only the chorus, first stanza and the chorus are played or even the chorus itself. Sometimes the chorus is played twice in the beginning, and once in the rest of the anthem. In formal events (if the anthem will be played by either a military band, concert band or orchestra) the format is: Chorus (2x), First verse and Chorus (2x), with the optional introduction. If played in full the chorus is sung twice, with or without the introductiory notes."}

It is in east and southeast London and it is part of the boroughs of Southwark, Tower Hamlets, Lewisham, Newham and Greenwich. The docks used to be part of the Port of London. \nAfter the docks closed, the area became derelict and poverty-stricken. The Docklands' regeneration began in the 1980s. The area has been redeveloped for commercial and residential use. The name London Docklands was used for the first time in a government report on redevelopment plans in 1971. The redevelopment created wealth but also led to conflict between the new and old communities in the area.\nThe docks served the Port of London, once one of the largest ports in the world. The docks and associated buildings (such as warehouses) were largely destroyed by bombing in the early part of the Second World War. Although they were working again by the late 1950s, as cargo ships got larger, that the port began to lose trade. A government decision was taken to build a new large container port on the east coast of England was carried out. That container port is at Felixstowe, and is served mostly by road transport motorways. Finally, the value of property in London made it possible to rebuild the old port areas into high-value property. Canary Wharf is the best-known redevelopment."}

For the most part, it was kept in its base at Wilhelmshaven. The Battle of Jutland happened when the German fleet, lead by Admiral Reinhard Scheer, tried to break out into the open sea. The German fleet consisted of 22 battleships, five battlecruisers, 11 cruisers and 61 torpedo-boats. Scheer also had submarines with torpedos. These he arranged outside the main British bases.\nThe main British bases were in Scotland: the Orkney and Shetland had a huge base at Scapa Flow, and bases on the mainland were at Cromarty on the Moray Firth and at Rosyth on the north bank of the Firth of Forth.\nSo, the British fleet steamed south-east from their bases and met the German fleet steaming due north. The battle was fought over a wide area at Jutland Bank west of the Skagerrak between Norway and Denmark.\nThe code books.\nScapa Flow is a long way from the Skagerrak, but as it was, the British fleet was forewarned of the German sortie. The British had cracked the German cipher, and when Scheer gave the order to sail, the Admiralty in London gave the Grand Fleet orders to sail from the Orkneys.p124 \nThis was the result of the British getting hold of three code books from wrecked ships. One book for smaller vessels was from a German freighter. Another for diplomatic messages was got from a wreck on the bottom of the North Sea. The code for the German High Seas Fleet was from a cruiser wrecked in the Baltic. Though the British did not make the best use of these sources, they had in their hands a priceless advantage.\nThe course of the battle.\nThe first skirmish.\nThe first group of British ships to make contact were those from the Firth of Forth, commanded by Vice-Admiral David Beatty. Beatty had six battlecruisers and four fast battleships. They got through the submarine cordon outside the Firth of Forth with no casualties. \nBeatty's battlecruiser group met the German battlecruiser force led by Rear-Admiral Franz Hipper. The German advantage in range-finding (superior optics) was important, but the British cruisers were saved by the arrival of the four battleships. Since the battleships were superior in both armor and firepower, Hipper was forced to turn away towards the east and the main German force of battleships.\nThe main forces.\nFinally, late in the day. the main battlefleet (the 'Grand Fleet') from Scapa Flow (led by Admiral John Jellicoe) met the main German force of battleships (commanded by Admiral Scheer). \"To Scheer's range-takers... the entire arc stretching from the north to the east was a sea of fire\".p128 After ten minutes of this, Scheer signaled a simultaneous turn-away.\n21 torpedos caused Jellico also to turn away, and Scheer put 10 miles between the British battleships and himself. As darkness grew, there were a few more encounters, until the German fleet made it home. They had sunk more British ships, but the balance of power had not changed."}

It is the third smallest city of Switzerland. As of 31 December 2016, Le Locle has about 10,000 people.\nThe name of the town comes from the word for \"lake\" or \"trou d\u00b4eau\".\nSince 2009, it is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site: La Chaux-de-Fonds/Le Locle, Watchmaking Town Planning.\nGeography.\nLe Locle is on the Swiss side of the mountain pass Col des Roches, which forms the border between France and Switzerland.\nHistory.\nLe Locle is first mentioned in 1332 as \"dou Locle\".\nPrehistory.\nThe earliest traces of human settlements come from the end of the Mesolithic period (6000-5000\u00a0BC) in shelter in the Col des Roches. The site includes the oldest pottery found in the Canton of Neuch\u00e2tel, along with many tools, the molar of a mammoth and deer and wild boar bones. The shelter was discovered in 1926 by a customs official and was the first site of its kind studied in Switzerland.\nHowever, between 4000\u00a0BC and the Middle Ages nothing is known about the Le Locle area.\nMiddle Ages.\nIn 1150 the valley, in which Le Locle would later be built, was granted by Renaud and William Valanginian to the abbey of Fontaine-Andr\u00e9. In 1360, John II of Aarberg, the Lord of Valanginian, received Le Locle as a fief from Count Louis of Neuchatel. The heavily wooded part of the Jura Mountains around Le Locle, were cleared by colonists who later received the status of free peasants. These first free farmers received a charter in 1372 which codified their rights and freedoms. At the beginning of the 15th century, this charter was reconfirmed during the foundation of the Mairie or town government. Beginning in the 14th century Le Locle and La Sagne formed a parish together. The church of Mary Magdalene in Le Locle was built in 1351.\nEarly modern era.\nThe tower of the church of Mary Magdalene, the landmark of the city, arose early in the 16th century. A few years after the tower was built, in 1536, Le Locle converted to the protestant faith. This old church was rebuilt in the mid-18th century. A german church was built in 1844, but demolished in 1967. The Catholic chapel was built in 1861.\nEarly modern and modern Le Locle.\nLe Locle was repeatedly burned by large fires (1683, 1765, 1833).

The entrance to the river from the sea is rocky with cliffs either side. On the East side Kingswear Castle sits very close to the water's edge, and on the west side Dartmouth Castle is built on a rocky promontory at sea level. The castles once operated a defensive chain across the estuary. It was raised at dusk to destroy enemy ships attempting to attack the harbour.

These determine what areas are more likely to have development of drought and when drought develops.\nDroughts are periodic. They alternate with floods over a series of years.\nThe worst droughts in U.S. history happened in the 1930s and 1950s. The U.S. drought in the 1930s was called the Dust Bowl. The 1936 North American heat wave was part of the Dust Bowl.\nOther major droughts in the 20th and 21st centuries happened in the United States in the 1960s, 1980, 1983, 1988-90, 2002 and 2012-14.\nThe costliest drought in United States history was the 1988-90 drought. The drought caused just over $60 billion in damage. During the drought, there were also heat waves that took the lives of 4,800-17,000 people in the U.S. This drought was also the costliest natural disaster in U.S. history before Hurricane Katrina.\nDroughts can affect anywhere within the United States.

Secondly, people were not allowed to bring their own food and drink into the festival, and they had to buy from food sellers in the festival, which was very expensive, costing $12 for a single slice of pizza, and a 590ml bottole of water cost $4. Thirdly, there was a very small amount of toilets for all the people, and within a short time, they were broken.\nThe festival also had a big violence problem, including the audience tearing plywood from the walls during the performance of the Limp Bizkit song \u201cBreak Stuff\u201d. On one occasion, a group handed out candles for a candlelight vigil, but the audience instead used them as a bonfire, throwing water bottles at it to burn longer."}

Zac's girlfriend Taylor Vaughan (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe), who is also very popular, breaks up with him so she can instead be with Brock Hudson (Owen Wilson), who is famous after being on a reality television show. Zack is sad but tells himself, he could make any girl in the school popular by making her his girlfriend. Zack and Douglas's friend, Dean Sampson, Jr. (Paul Walker), does not believe him and makes Zack bet that he can turn any random girl into the Prom Queen within six weeks, and Douglas's childhood friend Donald Hamilton (Richard Hammond) believed that Zack could turn any random girl into the Prom Queen within six weeks. But Dean chooses Laney Boggs (Rachael Leigh Cook), an unpopular art student, who prefers to spend time by herself.\nZack and Douglas tries to make friends with with Laney, but she ignores them and walks away. Zack and Douglas's sister Mac (Anna Paquin) tells them to try again, but to learn what Laney is interested in and cares about. Zack and Douglas go to the restaurant where Laney works, and with the help of Laney's friend, Jesse Jackson (Elden Henson) gets her to give them a chance. Laney takes them to a small theater where she will be performing in a drama show. To embarrass him, Laney has Zack and Douglas called on stage to perform. Zack manages to make up a performance, telling a story while kicking a Hacky Sack which he happens to carry in his pocket, while Douglas plays guitar while plays harmonica at the same time. Laney is impressed, but rejects them again after he tries to charm her.\nZack, Douglas and Donald make friends with her brother, Simon (Kieran Culkin), to be close to her. To get Zack and Douglas to stop Laney agrees to go to the beach with him and Douglas once. Dean and the other popular students also show up at the beach, and Laney gets a chance to know them better. After, Preston (Dul\u00e9 Hill) invites them to a party at his house that night. Laney pretends to be busy but Zack and Douglas persuade her go, and gets their sister to give Laney a makeover, changing her look and showing her true beauty. At the party Taylor is embarrassed by Brock and jealous of Laney, and says mean things to Laney until she runs away and cries. Zack and Douglas talk to Laney, telling her that by opening up to people there will be some bad with the good.\nNewly popular, Laney is surprised to be nominated for Prom Queen. Taylor has also been nominated. Zack and Laney begin to fall in love for real. Taylor is upset when her new boyfriend Brock breaks up with her, as he is leaving to be on another television show. Dean begins to show an interest in Laney, to annoy Zack and Douglas and make it more difficult for Zack and Douglas to win the bet. Dean tries to invite Laney to prom, but she says no. After arguing with Zack and Douglas, Dean tells Laney about the bet. She make Zack and Douglas admit that it was a bet in front of the other students. Angry and upset, Laney refuses to see Zack again.\nLaney will not talk with Zack so he takes his sister to the prom, while Douglas took Bonnie to the prom and Donald took Mindy to the prom. Taylor arrives alone, and thinks Zack will be her boyfriend again. Laney does not want to go to prom but her father Wayne (Kevin Pollak) encourages her to go after Dean shows up at her house in a tuxedo and again invites to be his prom date.\nAt the prom the school's DJ (Usher Raymond), organizes a big dance. Mac meets Jesse and they become friends. In the bathroom Dean boasts that he has booked a hotel room and will take Laney there to have sex. Jesse overhears, and tries to tell Mac and they also warn Zack, Douglas and Donald. Zack is voted prom king, and Taylor wins Prom Queen with 56% the votes. Even though the results were close, Laney is not upset, and she leaves the prom with Dean. Zack, Douglas and Donald try to follow but is too slow and lose them.\nWhen Laney goes home she finds, her family and Zack, Douglas and Donald waiting for her. Laney tells them she said no to Dean, and used a very loud air horn to get him to stop. Zack confesses his love to Laney, and asks her to forgive him and Douglas and give them another chance. She agrees and they they dance and kiss. Laney asks Zack about the bet, and Zack says he lost and will honor the terms of the bet but does not say more.\nAt the graduation ceremony, Zack is nude, wearing only a graduation cap and carrying a soccer ball to cover himself, while Douglas is wearing a James Bond tuxedo and a graduation cap and robe, and Donald is wearing a leather jacket and blue jeans and a graduation cap and robe. Zack goes on stage, and throws the ball to Laney, who catches it and as the students clap loudly she smiles.\nMaking the movie.\nR. Lee Fleming, Jr. is credited as the only screenwriter for the movie. M. Night Shyamalan also rewrote the movie script, but was not credited. Fleming said Shyamalan wrote the line \"Am I a bet?\".\nDirector Robert Iscove wanted his movie to be like the old movies of John Hughes, but different and for the teenagers of the 1990s. \nHe knew that Cook was not ugly and that audiences would have to accept the idea and pretend: \"You either go along with it or you don't go along with it.\" He compared it to how Clark Kent changes into Superman. Instead of making a real change from ugly to pretty, he said it was more important to find an actress who could show the different changes in her personality and feelings.\nFilming took place in various places in California. The highschool scenes were shot at Torrance High School, where Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Beverly Hills, 90210 had also filmed.\nIscove was also a choreographer before he was a director and wanted to include dancing in the movie. He wanted show his bosses the Weinsteins, that musical numbers could work in modern movies. The dance scene was choreographed by Adam Shankman, who later become known as a judge on the television series So You Think You Can Dance. Shankman also worked with Owen Wilson on his dance scenes.\nMusic.\nThe song \"Kiss Me\" was used as the main theme song for the movie. The success of the movie helped \"Kiss Me\" become more popular, and gain widespread mainstream attention and success in the music charts. \"Kiss Me\" climbed to No. 2 on Billboard's Hot 100 list, and stayed in the Top 10 for 16 weeks.\nThe movie was released in Italy with the title \"Kiss Me\".\nCritics.\nCritics gave the movie mixed reviews. They liked the main actors but complained that the story was easy to predict and not funny enough. On Rotten Tomatoes the movie has a score of 40% based on 60 reviews. On Metacritic the movie has a score of 51% based 32 reviews."}

In the second voyage, George Bass and Flinders confirmed that Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania) was an island. In the third voyage, Flinders circumnavigated the mainland of what was to be called Australia, along with Aboriginal man Bungaree.\nHeading back to England in 1803, Flinders' vessel needed urgent repairs at Isle de France (Mauritius). Although Britain and France were at war, Flinders thought the scientific nature of his work would ensure safe passage, but a suspicious governor kept him under arrest for more than six years. In captivity, he recorded details of his voyages for future publication, and put forward his rationale for naming the new continent 'Australia', as an umbrella term for New Holland and New South Wales \u2013 a suggestion taken up later by Governor Macquarie.\nFlinders' health had suffered, however, and although he reached home in 1810, he did not live to see the publication of his widely praised book and atlas, \"A Voyage to Terra Australis\"."}

The strait is now named after him (Torres Strait).\nOrigins and early life.\nCaptain Luis V\u00e1ez de Torres undertook a voyage from 1606 to 1607. In this voyage, the crew called him a \"Breton\" in reports. One of the reports points to an origin in the northwest province of Spain, that is Galicia. Historians accept this as evidence of his origins. The year and exact place of his birth are unknown but he was likely born around 1565.\nTorres has been presented as Portuguese, without any evidence other than his name. He is never called a Portuguese in the records but they note remarks made by crew members of the Portuguese origins of Pedro Fernandes de Queir\u00f3s.\nTorres entered the navy of the Spanish Crown and found his way to its South American colonies. By late 1605 he first entered the historical record as the nominated commander of the second ship in an expedition to the Pacific.

The Appalachians in North America and the Massif Central in France are two examples. Other examples are the Pyrenees, Sardinia, the Rhine Massif, the Anti-Atlas in Morocco. To the east, the Variscan caused the Urals, the Pamir, the Tian Shan mountains. \nThis geologic mountain-building event took place mostly in the Devonian and Carboniferous periods. By then Pangaea was more or less complete. In the Triassic period of the Mesozoic, there was land between Siberia over the North Pole to Antarctica over the South Pole. Later in the Mesozoic, the opening of the Atlantic split Pangea. The various parts of the huge mountain belts ended up widely apart on the modern globe.\nHigher mountain chains on present-day Earth are the product of a later episode of mountain-building known as the Alpine orogeny."}

The series premiered on February 15, 2011. It currently airs every Mon-Fri 7:30 pm on Zee TV channel. It is about the lives of Radhika and Dev. It is a different story than the first season. It has a different storyline and even some characters except for Dev and Radhika which are played by Avinash Sachdev and Rubina Dilaik respectively. The show is very popular and gains good TRP with an average of 2\u20133.\nPlot.\nRadhika, a Brahmin by birth, was adopted and brought up by a family of weavers in a small town. Dev visited the town with his family, met Radhika and became good friends. One day, while Radhika and Dev playing in a temple, they reached a place where 50 couples were getting married. Dev rubbed sindoor on Radhika's forehead, which she had gotten on her head by accident. This caused them to get married without their knowledge. When a priest who witnessed Dev and Radhika's \"wedding\" comes to Radhika's home and tells her parents that Radhika is married, Radhika tries to tell Dev this but is unable to meet him again.\nAfter 12 years.\nOne night after college, Radhika meets Dev. They spend time together but Radhika feels bad that she is attracted to someone else. Later on, she finds out that Dev is the one she had married as a child and tells him the truth. Under obligations, he tells her to marry Rohan. She tries to make him accept many times, but he refuses.\nRadhika is unable to get married to Rohan after all. A fire starts and Rohan gets badly burned, though Radhika is saved. Dev meets Radhika in the hospital and asks her what caused the fire. She tells him that Rohan knows that she loves someone else; Dev gets angry at this and tells her he hates her. Radhika decides to get into their house as the \"choti bahu\" and wife of Dev without telling anyone so she can gain Dev's trust back.\nAfter all the misunderstandings are cleared, the family accepts Dev and Radhika's relationship and Dev and Radhika are soon to be wed. However, because of social norms, everyone calls Radhikha an unchaste woman. To end this problem, Dadaji calls off Dev's marriage with Radikha and fixes it with Barkha. On the eve of Barkha and Dev's wedding, Barkha, wishing to help Radhika, lies to Radikha that she has told Dadaji about what happened 12 years ago and Dadaji has accepted her and will let her become Dev's wife. Radhika therefore dresses up in Barkha's wedding dress and takes the wedding vows with Dev.\nAfter Dadaji realizes that Dev married Radikha instead of Barkha, he suffers a fatal heart attack. The Purohit family decides that Dev will pretend to be married to Barkha in the public eye, and Radhika will perform all of the normal tasks at home.\nRadhika obediently performs all the duties of a \"choti bahu\". Barkha puts sleeping powder in Dev's juice, causing him to become unconscious. Barkha then reveals that she loves Dev and Radhika overhears everything. Barkha realizes this and decides to kill Radhika to get Dev's love. Barkha murders Radhika by driving into her with a car twice. In a twist, Radhika returns after a month, but this time is different \u2014 she has become confident and fearless. This is because Kanha, the god Radhika is devoted to, has disguised himself as Radhika to put an end to Barkha's crimes, as Dev is made only for Radhika.\nThe rest of the story tells how Kanha teaches Barkha her lesson. One day, when Kanha is at home as Radhika, Dev asks her if she's alright. Radhikha asks why, and Dev tells her he saw her outside the temple begging for help. This is actually the real Radhika, who was reborn after Barkha tried to suffocate her. Dev is later poisoned by a juice that Barkha got originally for Radhika, and the family believes Radhika did it. Barkha repeatedly tries to get Radhika out of the house.\nThen the real Radhika comes in the house. However, Kahna helps Radhika throughout everything. Barkha tries to murder Radhika again, but Dev stops her. The entire family then appears and disgraces Barkha, finally knowing her true nature. However, as Radhika faints, Barkha flees and successfully escapes. Later in the day, while Radhika and Dev go into the forest, Barkha tries to kill both of them, thinking that if she can't have Dev, no one can. However, everyone thinks she dies instead. The monastery was being taken by the bharawaj family which was however Radhikas real family. Ruby wants to kill Radhika even though she is her twin sister and that is the reason why she wants to kill her.

His music is a combination of both garage and hip-hop beats, also with his own original style of rapping.\nHistory.\nDizzee Rascal's first song to be released was \"I Luv U\" - a tale of accidental teenage pregnancy. His first album \"Boy In The Corner\" was released in 2003 with good reviews.\nThe same year (2003) Dizzee Rascal was stabbed in Ayia Napa. Some newspapers tried to link this to a conflict between Dizzee and a UK-based hip-hop group So Solid Crew.\nDizzee has been described as \"the vital unvarnished voice of modern-day inner-city UK\", and a social element is usually present in most of his songs. However, Dizzee proves that social commentary does not have to be boring. There is often a funny element to his singing, and some might find this (very British) humour similar to that of Mike Skinner of The Streets.\nIn September 2003 Dizzee won the Mercury Music Prize for best album, and was the youngest person (at 19) to do so.\nHe also worked on Basement Jaxx's third album \"Kish Kash\" on the track \"Lucky Star\""}

It was released on March 16, 1979, twelve days before the Three Mile Island accident. The term \"China syndrome\" refers to a scenario, not meant to be taken literally, where a reactor core could melt through the Earth \"all the way to China\".\nPlot summary.\nNews reporter Kimberly Wells (Jane Fonda) and her cameraman Richard Adams (Michael Douglas) are filming a special on nuclear power at the (fictional) Ventana Nuclear Power Plant when they witness an earthquake followed by a reactor scram. In the control room, Jack Godell (Jack Lemmon) notices that the water level is high and asks another member of the crew to open a relief valve. Ted Spindler (Wilford Brimley) warns him that regulations do not permit opening the relief valve, but he proceeds to open it anyway. The control room crew then notices that the water level is actually dangerously low, and declare an emergency over the intercom ordering all personnel to safety areas. They manage to bring the water level back up to a safe level, meanwhile, Richard secretly films the incident. Richard wants to show the film on television, but the station manager will not allow it. Richard then steals the film and shows it to a group of nuclear engineers who determine that the plant came very close to the China syndrome, where the core would have melted through its containment and down into the Earth, contaminating a large area. Meanwhile, Jack Godell discovers that the welds on the main pump are not safe, and takes over the plant by force, locks himself in the control room, and demands to be interviewed on television. A SWAT team is called in, and proceeds to break into the control room. The other members of the control room crew cut wires in other areas of the plant to intentionally cause a scram. When the scram begins, the main pump fails, and Jack Godell is shot by the SWAT team.\nResponse of the nuclear power industry.\nUpon its release, the movie was criticized by the nuclear power industry, referring to the movie as \"sheer fiction\" and a \"character assassination of an entire industry\". Twelve days after the movie was released, however, the Three Mile Island accident occurred in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania. Both the accident depicted in the movie and the real-world accident at Three Mile Island involved loss of water through a relief valve, as well as the control room crew incorrectly reading water levels."}

As a member of the colonial administration, Maurice Yam\u00e9ogo began his career in 1946 in the dense political landscape of Upper Volta thanks to his oratory skills. In May 1957, as part of the formation of the first Volta Government established by the framework law Defferre, he joined the coalition government formed by Ouezzin Coulibaly, as Minister of Agriculture under the label of the Movement Voltaic Democratic (MDV) . In January 1958, threatened by a motion of censure, Ouezzin Coulibaly debauched in favor of the Voltaic Democratic Union-African Democratic Rally (UDV-RDA) Maurice Yam\u00e9ogo and his allies at the assembly against the insurance of a promotion in the government. Maurice Yam\u00e9ogo thus raises No. 2 of the government with the portfolio of the Interior, a key position that allows him when in September 1958 Ouezzin Coulibaly dies, to act as interim head of government.\nMaurice Yam\u00e9ogo quickly imposes his choices. After the proclamation of the Republic on December 11, 1958, it operates in 1959 a surprising reversal of position vis-\u00e0-vis the proposed Federation of Mali defended by L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor. Although the Voltaic constituent assembly wanted Haute-Volta to join the Federation, Maurice Yam\u00e9ogo opted for international sovereignty and regional integration limited to the economic sphere with the Entente Council. Then Yam\u00e9ogo neutralizes any parliamentary opposition. The UDV-RDA purified of its adversaries, imposes in single party. Upper Volta is even before independence, on August 5, 1960, under the yoke of his dictatorship.\nIn foreign politics, jealous and admiring of the international success of his Ivorian colleague F\u00e9lix Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny, he challenged him by establishing an ephemeral customs union (1961-1962) with the very progressive Ghana of Kwame Nkrumah. Houphou\u00ebt-Boigny quickly became his best ally in December 1965. Yam\u00e9ogo signed with him an agreement to establish dual citizenship for Ivorian and Voltaic nationals. This project does not have time to succeed. On January 3, 1966, in a context of severe financial austerity measures, his corrupt regime was overthrown by a peaceful demonstration organized by the forces of the Voltaic nation: the unions, the so-called traditional chieftaincy and the clergy. The result is Maurice Yam\u00e9ogo, an austerity linked to his dubious management of finances. In 1993, he died after being rehabilitated by the President of the Republic Blaise Compaore."}

It is done to score runs or prevent the loss of one's wicket. \nAny player who is currently batting is called a batsman even if they are better in any other skills in cricket. Batsmen have to adapt to various conditions when playing on different cricket pitches, especially in different countries. A top-level batsman has good reflexes, decision-making and strategy with excellent physical batting skills.\nDuring an innings two members of the batting side are on the pitch. The one facing the current delivery from the bowler is called 'the striker', while the other is the non-striker. When a batsman is out, he is replaced by a teammate. This continues until the end of the innings or until 10 of the team members are out. After the batting of first team is over the other team gets a turn to bat.\nBatting tactics and strategy depends on the type of match being played. It also depends on the current state of play. Batsmen try to score many runs quickly without losing their wicket. To score quickly, risky shots must be played which increases the chances of batsman being out. Batsman's safest choice is to guard the stumps but this may result in scoring fewer runs.\nAs with all other cricket statistics, batting statistics and records are given much attention. It helps to know how effectively a batsman is playing. The main statistic for batting is a player's batting average. This is calculated by dividing the number of runs he has scored by the number of times he has been out (dismissed)."}

It is also known as Dharmakshetra (\"Holy Place\"). It is also known as the \"Land of Bhagwad Gita\".\nAccording to the Puranas, Kurukshetra is a region named after King Kuru, the ancestor of Kauravas and Pandavas. This is place where Mahabharata war was fought. Also the Bhagavad Gita was explained there during the war when Lord Krishna found Arjuna in a difficult situation.\nBefore 1947, Thanesar was the name of the tehsil headquarters and the town. Thanesar or Sthaneswar is a historical town next to newly created Kurukshetra city. Thanesar derives its name from the word \"Sthaneshwar\", which means \"Place of God\".\nIn most ancient Hindu texts, Kurukshetra is not a city but a region (\"kshetra\" meaning \"region\" in Sanskrit). The boundaries of Kurukshetra lies to the central and western parts of state of Haryana and southern Punjab. Thus according to the Taittiriya Aranyaka 5.1.1., the Kurukshetra region is south of Turghna (Srughna/Sugh in Sirhind, Punjab), north of Khandava (Delhi and Mewat region), east of Maru (desert) and west of Parin.\nHistory.\nIt is written in Puranas that Kurukshetra is named after King Kuru of the Bharata Dynasty, ancestor of Pandavas and Kauravas.\nThe Vamana Purana tells how King Kuru came to settle here. He chose this land at the banks of Sarasvati River which dried up before 1900 BCE for embedding spirituality with eight virtues: austerity (Tapas (Sanskrit)), truth (Satya), forgiveness (Kshama), kindness (daya), purity (Shuddha), charity (Daana), Yajna and Brahmacharya. Lord Vishnu was impressed with the act of King Kuru and blessed him. God gave him two boons: one that this land forever will be known as a Holy Land and the other that anyone dying on this land will go to heaven. The land of Kurukshetra was between two rivers \u2014 the Sarasvati and the Drishadvati.\nThis land has been known as Uttarvedi, Brahmavedi, Dharamkshetra and Kurukshetra at different periods. When King Kuru came on this land it was called Uttarvedi. Over the period this land has been ruled by many empires. The Bharata Dynasty came and settled here.\nBy the archaeological grounds it has been proved that Ashoka the Great made Kurukshetra a centre of learning for people from all over the world. It reached the peak of its progress during the reign of King Harsha, during which Chinese scholar Xuanzang visited Thanesar.\n48 Kos Parikrama.\nKurukshetra has great importance as a Hindu pilgrimage. There are several pilgrimages around the city of kurukshetra and a complete parikrama means to visit all these pilgrimages. 48 kos parikrama is a Hindi phrase meaning 48 miles circle around the holy city of Kurukshetra."}

Occasionally, a king or queen might order someone to dismantle their own castle if they did not get permission to build it.\nCastles were sometimes repaired after they were slighted, while others were abandoned.

Many of his novels were partly autobiographical and used a stream of consciousness style. His most famous works are \"Tropic of Cancer\", \"Black Spring\", \"Tropic of Capricorn\" and \"The Rosy Crucifixion\". They are based on his experiences in New York and Paris. They were all banned in the United States until the 1960s because they contained explicit descriptions of sex and obscene language. He also wrote travel memoirs and literary criticism and painted watercolors.\nLife.\nMiller was born in New York City. His parents were German-Americans. His father worked as a tailor. Miller always wanted to be writer, but he worked at several different jobs when he was a young man. During World War I he worked as a clerk in the US War Department (now called the Department of Defense). Then he got a job as a reporter on \"The Washington Post\". He quit that job after three days and returned to New York City. In New York he worked for the Western Union telegraph company. In 1917 he married Beatrice Sylvas Wickens, a pianist.\nIn 1924 he left Beatrice and their child to marry the taxi dancer June Edith Smith. A taxi dancer was a woman who was paid to dance with men in dance halls. He gave up his job at the telegraph company to work full-time as a writer. Miller and June lived in Greenwich Village. They went to Paris in 1928 and stayed for a few months. He separated from June and went back to New York by himself in 1929. She later divorced him in 1934. In 1930 he went back to Paris alone. He found a job as a proofreader for the \"New York Herald Tribune\" Paris edition. A proofreader is a kind of copy editor who checks the first printing of a text for errors. He also worked on his novels. His first important novel, \"Tropic of Cancer\", was published in Paris by the Obelisk Press in 1934. \"Black Spring\" was published in 1936 and \"Tropic of Capricorn\" in 1939. He became a close friend of the writer Ana\u00efs Nin. She helped him get \"Tropic of Cancer\" published and wrote the to it. Miller stayed in Paris until June 1939. \nHe spent the next year living on the Greek island of Corfu. On Corfu he was the guest of the writer Lawrence Durrell. Miller described his visit in his travel memoir \"The Colossus of Maroussi\". It was published in 1941. Miller considered it to be his best work. When World War II started, Miller returned to the United States. For several years he lived in Big Sur in California. Big Sur is on the Pacific Ocean near Carmel. Many writers and artists lived there. In Big Sur Miller began work on his novel \"Sexus\", the first part of his trilogy \"The Rosy Crucifixion\". It was published in 1949 and tells the story of his early life in New York and first two marriages. The other two novels in the trilogy were \"Plexus\" published in 1953 and \"Nexus\" published in 1959. They continue the story of his second marriage and his years in Paris. In 1963 Miller moved to Pacific Palisades near Los Angeles. He lived there for the rest of his life. \nMiller married three more times. In 1944 he married Janina Lepska. She was a philosophy student and 30 years younger than him. They were divorced in 1952. In 1953 he married Eve McClure. She was an artist and almost 40 years younger than him. They divorced in 1962. Soon after their divorce, he married Hoki Tokuda, a Japanese entertainer. She played the piano in nightclubs. They were no longer living together when Miller died in 1980 at the age of 88. Miller had three children: Barbara from his first marriage to Beatrice Wickens and Anthony and Valentine from his third marriage to Janina Lepska."}
