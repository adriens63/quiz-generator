The standing rigging is used to support the masts. The running rigging supports the yards and sails. Some types of sailboats that have unsupported masts do not have any rigging. These include the junk rig and catboat rigs. Bermuda sloops with a single mast and one headsail use fairly simple rigging. Cutter-rigged ketches and schooners have the most complex rigging.\nStanding rigging.\nA sailing ship's standing rigging is made up of the ropes used to support the masts, yards and booms. Most modern sailing vessels use wire rope for the standing rigging. Modern standing rigging is regularly checked for tension using a special gauge. Adjusting the tension is done by use of a turnbuckle. Ropes, wires or rods that run fore-and-aft along the centerline which stabilize the masts or spars are called stays. Those that from the mast to the bow are called forestays. Those that run from the mast to the stern are called backstays.\nRunning rigging.\nThe running rigging of a sailing vessel controls the sails. The running rigging is usually made up of various kinds of rope (ropes are also called lines). It uses blocks and Sheaves to adjust the length of the ropes. A block is a kind of pulley. A sheave is the grooved wheel inside the block. Larger sailing boats and ships use winches. The adjustability of the running rigging allows the boat to perform various maneuvers such as tacking and jibing. Common to all sailboats are the outhaul and the downhaul. The outhaul pulls the sail to the free end of the boom. The downhaul keeps the boom from rising on the mast. "}

He is known for the building of the first pyramid built in Egypt, the Step Pyramid at Saqqara. The Third Dynasty, based in Memphis, was the beginning of the Old Kingdom, a period of stability, achievement and unity.\nThere have been claims that he was not the first king, as the Abydos King List and the Turin King List give a king by the name of Sanakht. There is no archaeological evidence to support this, and most experts agree that Djoser was the first. He ruled for at least 20 years, but he had so many temples, tombs and monuments built that some experts say he may have ruled for up to 30 years.\nThere is a painted limestone statue of Djoser, which is the oldest discovered life sized Egyptian statue. It was found in Saqqara during archaeological digging in 1924-1925. The statue is now in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.\nThe Step Pyramid.\nThe building of the Step Pyramid was quite an achievement. It is the first massive monument built in stone, about 62 meters in height. It is surrounded by a 10 meter high wall, which encloses an area of about 16 hectares. It shows that the kingdom must have been stable and wealthy to have spent so much time and money to build it. The man who designed it and supervised the building was Imhotep, the oldest named architect known to us. Thousands of years later, Djoser was known to Egyptians as the \"opener of stone\", recognising his legacy of using stone for buildings.\nThe Famine.\nThe Egyptians believed in a story of how Djoser was able to end a famine. There is no evidence from the time of his rule, but an engraved stone, a stele, was made 2000 years later giving the details. Even if the story is a legend, it does show that Djoser was remembered as a great pharaoh. Egypt had been suffering from a famine for seven years, when the god of the Nile, Khnum, spoke to Djoser in a dream. Djoser rebuilt Khnum's temple on Elephantine, an island near modern Aswan. This pleased the god, and the famine ended. The ruins of the temple are still visible today."}

It tells a largely fictional version of the First Crusade in which Christian knights, led by Godfrey of Bouillon, battle Muslims in order to take Jerusalem. The poem is composed of eight-line stanzas grouped into 20 cantos of varying length.\nThe work belongs to the Italian Renaissance tradition of the romantic epic poem. The poet frequently borrows plot elements and character types directly from \"Orlando furioso\" (\"The Frenzy of Roland\"), written in 1516 by Ludovico Aristo (1474-1533). Tasso's poem also has elements inspired by the classical epics of Homer and Virgil, especially in those sections of their works that tell of sieges and warfare. One of the most typical literary devices in Tasso's poem is the emotional conflict suffered by characters torn between their heart and their duty; the depiction of love at odds with martial courage or honor is a central source of lyrical passion in the poem.\nPolish translation.\nGoffred albo Jeruzalem wyzwolona is a Polish translation of Torquato Tasso's \"Gerusalemme liberata\" (\"Jerusalem Delivered\") (by Piotr Kochanowski. It was first printed in Cracow (Krak\u00f3w) in 1618.\nIn the 16th century Polish literature flourished. One thing, however, lacked. There was no long epic poem in Poland. Jan Kochanowski, the greatest poet of the Renaissance in Kingdom of Poland, wrote many lyrical pieces and some stories in verse. His nephew, Piotr Kochanowski was the first poet to give an epic poem to the Poles. He did not write a poem on his own. He translated two epic masterpieces from the Italian. They were \"Jerusalem Delivered\" by Torquato Tasso and \"Orlando Furioso\" by Ludovico Ariosto.\nThe historical importance of Piotr Kochanowski's translation lies in its form. The poet used exactly the same form, ottava rima. It is an Italian strophe of eight lines. It is built of 11-syllable lines (endecasillabo in Italian). It rhymes abababcc. The strophe was used by Italian poets from 14th century. There are many long poems in ottava rima in Italian literature of 15th and 16th centuries. There were not any in Polish literature of the time. Piotr Kochanowski introduced the strophe into Polish poetry. There was another poet, Sebastian Grabowiecki, who used it earlier in Poland. He dit it, however, in one short poem. Into English poetry ottava rima was introduced many years before by Thomas Wyatt. In 17th century ottava rima became one of the most important verse forms in Poland.\nPiotr Kochanowski's version of \"Jerusalem Delivered\" is still widely read. There are many new editions. His translation is used at school."}

The sail is usually attached to a boom at its foot. It has a number of variations. Due to the physics of the wind, the tall thin sails of the Bermudian rigs have more power sailing into the wind than other types. This is why it is such a popular rig with modern sailboats. It was called a Marconi rig after the inventor Guglielmo Marconi because its system of mast stays that looked like the early wireless masts. However, the name Bermuda rig was in use two centuries earlier. It came from the late 1600s when European sailors noticed how well the small sloops in Bermuda worked.\nHistory.\nIt was developed in Bermuda in the 17th century. It was based on the leg-of-mutton sail. The strong gusty winds around the Bermuda islands made sailing around the waters difficult to navigate. The prevailing winds came out of the west which lined up with the islands. In addition, the number of reefs around the islands required caution. Most other sail designs did not address these issues.\nIt is widely thought the first of these designs was a fore-and-aft rig built by in the 17th century by a Dutch-born Bermudan. While his name is not remembered, he may have seen the Moorish lateen rigs that were widely used during the time Spain ruled Holland. The Dutch modified early lateen rigs turning the yards into angled masts. This design was called \"bezaanjacht\" in Dutch (in English this meant \"leg of mutton\"). By the 19th century the design had evolved into using tall triangular sails and jibs. They also used Bermuda cedar for the hulls which is much lighter than oak. This made the Bermuda sailboats very fast and easily maneuverable. They could travel into the wind with ease and were especially fast when heading downwind. Very soon they were being raced.\nNamed for Marconi.\nThe name Marconi rig came from the 1899 America's Cup yacht race held in New York City. Guglielmo Marconi demonstrated his new wireless radio by reporting on the race. The masts of the Bermudan rigged vessels with their supporting cables looked like the wireless mast of Marconi's radio. This is how they came to be named Marconi rigs."}

Instead, the company hires or collaborates with other companies which can then perform these functions.\nAny business or company can hand over a part of their process or specific services to be handled by a third party. According to The Deloitte Global Outsourcing Survey 2018, among the industries that refer to outsourcing are technology and media, financial services, consumer and energy, followed by government and public services and life sciences and healthcare.\nAmong the industries that generate the most revenue are information technology outsourcing and business processes, that includes financial outsourcing and consumer. \nGlobal outsourcing industry revenue from 2010 to 2018, by service type \nReasons for outsourcing.\nReduce the overall cost of production, development or services\nReach a wider pool of experts\nAccess the knowledge unavailable through other channels \nImprove flexibility of business processes\nDecrease labor costs\nTypes of Outsourcing.\nMost of the processes in the company can be outsourced in parts or in general. However, depending on the location of the ultimate executor, level of their involvement and amount of services they render, there are following types of outsourcing:\nProfessional Outsourcing.\nIf a company requires specific services and don't want or cannot afford to hire a dedicated specialist within the company, they can outsource such services. Among commonly outsourced professional services are accounting, legal services, IT, call center support, etc. This allows a company to be more flexible and manage their expenses rationally. \nIT Outsourcing\nOne of the most commonly outsourced professional service, information technology (IT) represents the wide range of services. Companies can outsource research and prototype development, development of software, maintenance, and support. Such contracts allow reducing the costs as contractors can be hired for the period required.\nMultisourcing.\nIf a company has both internal and external experts working on the same task, such form of outsourcing will be called multisourcing. It involves a distributed team that can be working in two or more locations all over the world. Unlike other types of outsourcing, this one is focused on the result and is often based on the \u2018partners\u2019 approach rather than \u2018client/worker\u2019 model. \nManufacturer Outsourcing.\nNumerous enterprises refer to the outsourcing of their manufacturing if it allows reducing the cost and decreasing the prime cost of an item produced. Among other reasons for manufacturer outsourcing can be a lack of expertise, time/cost efficiency and a shortage of human resources. \nBPO\nUnlike professional outsourcing when the whole exercise is transferred to a third-party, this type of outsourcing focuses on a specific process. The primary reason for business process outsourcing is a knowledge gap that is too expensive to close. A typical example of business process outsourcing would ba machinery maintenance (typically outsourced to a company that provided it). \nProcess-Specific Outsourcing.\nUnlike business process outsourcing, process specific knowledge focuses on outsourcing of an action that another company can do faster or cheaper, which allows business to reduces the costs or improve clients\u2019 experience. This form would request a third party to perform actions according to the contract (for example, delivery services have estimate dates/time, conditions of the delivered goods, etc.)\nOffshore Outsourcing.\nGlobalization and expansion of international business cooperation have triggered offshore outsourcing, making companies choose the providers of services or goods from countries far from their location. Not only does it help reduce the costs, but also opens the business to new markets and experts from other parts of the globe. Common offshore destinations are China and India (manufacturing), Eastern Europe (Ukraine, Romania, Poland for IT).\nReshoring.\nThe reversed process of bringing manufacturing or development back to the country is called reshoring. Such a decision can be justified if the costs of long-distance shipment, customs, and all the subsequent expenses overweight the benefits of offshoring.\nNearshoring.\nIf the company can transfer part of its manufacturing or services to the country nearby (common border or close proximity) and final destination has a similar business approach and legislation, then this form of outsourcing, is called nearshoring. One of the examples of nearshoring is cooperation between Scandinavian manufacturers and Baltic countries.\nOther Websites.\nOffshore Software Development - Why Offshore Software Development is a Valuable Option?"}

He graduated from high school in and then he studied at the of the\u00a0. After he got his diploma he wanted to continue in his studies, but the Protectorate regime didn't let him do so.

His team made the first\u00a0Czechoslovak\u00a0\u00a0called\u00a0\"silon.\" He was arrested by the Gestapo in 1942 but was released few months later.

In 1952 he was made the dean of the I\u00a0in Prague.\nDevelopment of contact lenses.\nOtto studied the synthesis of hydrophilous gels. He wanted to find a perfect material that can be in permanent contact with living tissues. His colleague\u00a0 helped him and together they prepared a gel. This gel absorbed up to 40% of water and was transparent. This new material is the\u00a0Poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate). They patented it in 1953. Wichterle thought that it might be a good material for contact lenses and gained his first patent for soft contact lenses. In 1957 Wichterle produced around 100 soft lenses. The problem was that the edges tore when the lens was getting removed. He wanted to find a better way to make them. Unfortunately, he was forced to leave the because\u00a0of its Communist\u00a0leadership in 1958. So the research at the Institute came to an end, but he did the important experiments to transform into a good shape of a contact lens by himself at home.\nBy late 1961 produced the first four hydrogel\u00a0contact lenses\u00a0on a home-made apparatus built from children's building kit (Merkur). All the glass tubing was also made by himself. On Christmas afternoon he finally made a contact lens in his apparatus. He tried the lenses in his own eyes. He said that they were comfortable. He built more new prototype machines using\u00a0Merkur toys \u00a0with stronger motor taken from his gramophone. With these devices he made 5,500 lenses.\nAchievements and legacy.\nWichterle was well-known all around the world not only because of his achievements but also because of his activities in international organizations. He is the author of a large number of studies. He is the author or co-author of approximately 180 patents and of over 200 publications. \nIn 1970, Wichterle was expelled again from his position in the institute, this time for signing \"\" .

Most of the city is in Maricopa County. The northern part is in Yapavai County. It is a major suburb of Phoenix. It was named for Peoria, Illinois because that is where many of the early settlers came from.\nIn the 2010 United States Census, 154,065 people lived in the city. Peoria is the ninth largest city in Arizona. Peoria has a Mayor\u2013council government; a mayor and six councilmen who are all elected.\nNative Americans.\nSmall groups of hunter-gatherers called Paleo-Indians moved through what would later become Peoria. Spear points found in Peoria date from 10,000\u20138,000 BC and show there was hunting activity here. About 1500 BC, there was farming here which indicates that semi-nomadic peoples used the area. From about 1\u2013500 AD the peoples here settled into two areas. There were crops being raised here in the Peoria area during the spring and summer. At other times they lived in the upland areas where they gathered seeds, cholla, and cactus fruits.\nThere is evidence that the Hohokam lived here before 1150 AD. They built their houses out of wattle and daub. Later they used adobe and stone. They vanished after about the mid-1400s. They left almost no clues as to where they went or what happened to their civilization.\nAs late as the 1870s, small bands of Yavapai were farming small pieces of land in the area depending on surface runoff and springs for water. \nEuropean settlers.\nEuropean and American explorers discovered gold in 1863 near Wickenburg, Arizona. This caused a conflict with the Yavapai in the area. Ranchers were attracted to the area because of the grasslands for cattle. Relations with the Yavapai turned to war over the land. This was in part because the American Civil War caused the Army to leave the area. When the army returned, the Yavapai were eventually removed to a reservation. \nFor about 13 years, the area around what would become Peoria lay vacant.

It is a long cycle of sonnets. In fact, it is an epic poem written in the form of sonnet. The author was a Slovak Lutheran pastor and poet, who wrote in Czech. The work was intended to become a national epic of all the Slavic peoples. It was first printed in 1824. It was published some more times and expanded in every edition. The number of poems increased from 150 to 645.\nThere is a pun in the title of the book. \"Sl\u00e1va\" in Czech means \"Fame\". Slavic people regard themselves as \"the people of fame\", never \"the slaves\", as they are considered to be in the West.\nThe work is provided with a \"Prologue\" (\"P\u0159edzp\u011bv\"). This part is written in hexameter and pentameter. The metre is shaped like Greek one. It is based on length of vowels.\n&lt;poem&gt;\n\"Ai, zde le\u017e\u00ed zem ta, p\u0159ed okem m\u00fdm selzy ron\u00edc\u00edm,\"\n\"n\u011bkdy kol\u00e9bka, nyn\u00ed n\u00e1rodu m\u00e9ho rakev.\"\n\"Stoj noho! posv\u00e1tn\u00e1 m\u00edsta jsou, kamkoli kr\u00e1\u010d\u00ed\u0161,\"\n\"k obloze, Tatry synu, vznes se, vyv\u00fd\u0161e pohled.\"\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe poem is divided into five parts. They are named after the rivers. The first part is named \"S\u00e1la\", the second \"Labe, R\u00e9n, Veltava\" and the third \"Dunaj\". These are the rivers, Slavic nations live around. Two next parts of the poem are named \"Lethe\" and \"Acheron\". These are the rivers know from Greek mythology. All the sonnets are written in decasyllable. It is trochaic pentameter. In his poem Koll\u00e1r described the past of the Slavs, full of glory, and bright future for them.\n&lt;poem&gt;\n\"A hundred times I spoke, but now I call\"\n\"To you divided, O Slavonians!\"\n\"Let's be a whole and not a part in clans;\"\n\"Be one in harmony or naught at all.\"\n\"A dove-like nation we in scorn are styled.\"\n\"But doves you know are come of such a stock\"\n\"That loves to live within a common flock,\"\n\"And so may you apply this trait reviled.\"\n\"O Slavs, thou race of many fragments!\"\n\"United forces e'er results will show,\"\n\"But waste and dry the circling currents.\"\n\"O Slavs, who are of many heads a race!\"\n\"The wise indeed a death no worse can know\"\n\"Than life that sloth, void, darkness doth embrace.\"\n\"(Canto III, sonnet 62)\"\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nThe poem is strongly influenced by Dante's \"Divine Commedy\". The last parts of Koll\u00e1r's work are descriptions Slavic heaven and hell. J\u00e1n Koll\u00e1r was a representative of the Panslavism ideology. He believed in union of all the Slavs. He opposed everything, he thought to destroy this union. He described Adam Mickiewicz, the greatest Polish poet, to be in hell. It was because Mickiewicz wrote poems about Polish people's fight against Russian tzar."}

In 2016, the countries with the most unfavourable view of the EU were Greece, France, Spain and the United Kingdom.\nThe rise of right-wing populist parties in Europe have been contributed to their Eurosceptic views. On 23 June 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union with 52% voting to leave.\nPolls.\nIn November 2015, a poll showed that those with a positive image of the EU went down from 52% in 2007 to 37%.

She first appeared in an update for the game \"Heroes of the Storm\". She later appeared in the 2016 video game, \"Overwatch\". These games are made by Blizzard Entertainment, a company that makes and publishes video games.\nIn \"Overwatch\", the character is known as Tracer, but her real name is Lena Oxton. Her personality is noticeably happy and energetic. She is known as one of the faster characters in the game, but also one with low health. In the game, she is able to teleport and time travel, with her abilities \"Blink\" and \"Recall\". She is an \"Offense\" hero commonly used to flank or distract the enemy team. Her Ultimate Ability, \"Pulse Bomb\" is commonly used to eliminate high priority targets in a small area, it can also stick to enemies and eliminate others nearby, Tracer herself can also be damaged by this if she is too close. \nIn the real world, she is one of the more well known characters from \"Overwatch\". This is because she is seen on the cover of the video game and Blizzard has made animated videos featuring her.\nDesign.\nTracer was first seen in 2014 at Blizzard Entertainment's \"BlizzCon 2014\" event. The main designer on \"Overwatch\", Scott Mercer, said that Blizzard's canceled project, \"Titan\", had a character with Tracer's abilities. Jeff Kaplan was the main hero designer for \"Overwatch\"; he had a big part in Tracer's design. While the game was still being designed and tested, or its \"beta\" period, Tracer's health was lowered. \nHer personality was designed as heroic and happy. \"Overwatch\" game designer Michael Chu said, \"the thing about Tracer is that she has a personality which is out of the norm for most people. She is incredibly optimistic, she is incredibly bubbly - it's part of her hero persona. We love her, I think she is very much one of the main characters of the game [...] [to] really carry the torch of what the game is all about: heroism.\" She is British and the British actress Cara Theobold voices her in the game.\nWhile the game was still being designed, victory poses were added to the characters. Tracer's \"Over the Shoulder\" victory pose caused a controversy, because some players thought that the pose's focus on her physical features did not line up with her personality traits. Some players disagreed with this, finding nothing wrong with it, but Jeff Kaplan, the director of \"Overwatch\" apologized for the pose. Blizzard then changed the victory pose to better fit Tracer's personality, and while some players were happy with the change, as well as with Blizzard listening to the game's community, other players thought that the game's makers were giving up their creative control to offended players."}

His activity was supported by T. G. Masaryk, who also contributed to his magazines. Peroutka was also wrote about politics in \"Lidov\u00e9 noviny,\" where he wrote against Nazis and communists, whose idelogies he saw as dangerous. For this he was frequently attacked by members of those parties. He also openly criticiced Adolf Hitler, for his lies and false promises. \nWorld War II.\nAfter German occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1939, Peroutka was forced to write propaganda for the Nazis. He didn't listen and in April 1939 issue of \"P\u0159\u00edtomnost\" he wrote an article \"Dynamick\u00fd \u017eivot\" (Dynamic life) about the 50th birthday of Adolf Hitler. In this article he acknowledged Hitler's power, but refused that Czechs should listen to him. For this he was sent to concentration camp, but was released after few days. Although, a few months later in September 1939 he was jailed again, along with other potential enemies of Nazi regime.\nPeroutka was jailed in concentration camps Dachau and Buchenwald, where he was liberated by American army in 1945.\nAfter the war.\nAfter the war Peroutka became editor-in-chief of \"Svobodn\u00e9 noviny\" and \"Dne\u0161ek,\" that replaced his previous magazines.\nIn those years he was repeatedly accused by communists of sympathizing with Nazis. Their proof were articles \"Dynamick\u00fd \u017eivot\" and \"Hitler po lidsk\u00e9 strance\" (Hitler with a human face), that he didn't actually write. Peroutka refused those claims. Many years later in 2015, Czech president Milo\u0161 Zeman claimed that Peroutka was fascinated by Nazism and wrote an article called \"Hitler je gentleman\" (Hitler is gentleman). Although this was never proved Zeman refused to apologize and Ov\u010d\u00e1\u010dek is still searching for that article\nIn the years 1945-1946 he was a member of the parliament for Czech National Social Party.\nExile.\nAfter Soviets assumed control over Czech government in 1948 Peroutka went to exile. First he went to England and later to United States. He worked for Radio Free Europe in Munich and was one of the members of The Council of Free Czechoslovakia.\nPeroutka became one of the most important anti-communist personalities and his works were banned behind Iron Curtain. Reading and spreading his work was illegal and Communist government pretented he never existed. Because of this Czechs growing up after normalization had practically no way to find out who he was.\nPeroutka died in 1978 in New York.

There are two SAR's in China, Hong Kong and Macau. Unlike other regions in mainland China, SAR's have a Basic Law, a constitution that is different from that of the People's Republic of China (PRC). Basic Law allows Hong Kong and Macau to have freedoms that are not in the rest of China, like freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of the Press, freedom of assembly, and freedom to petition. Basic Law also allows the SAR's to decide the economic rules of their region, which is why the economies are a lot less controlled in Hong Kong and Macau than in mainland China, as well as giving them the freedom to choose who to let into their own regions without needing a visa. As a result, Hong Kong and Macau have their own currencies, passports, official languages, etc. This is commonly known as the \"one country, two systems\" policy.\nChinese is an official language in both SAR's, but unlike mainland China where Mandarin is the main spoken language and simplified Chinese is the main written language, Cantonese is the most spoken language and traditional Chinese is the main written language in these areas. The vagueness of simply stating Chinese as the official language allows this to happen. Also, English and Portuguese, the main languages of the nations that controlled Hong Kong and Macau in the past in respective order, are also official languages in the respective SAR's.\nHistory.\nAfter the British Empire defeated China in the Opium Wars, China was forced to give up Hong Kong to the British after signing unequal treaties that favored British interests. They had to give up control of Hong Kong Island in 1842, Kowloon Peninsula in 1860, and were made to lease New Territories for a period of 99 years in 1898. In the 1980s, when its lease of New Territories was nearly over, the United Kingdom sought to renew its lease of New Territories. However, China refused to renew the lease. Since New Territories had half of Hong Kong's people and most of its water supply, having Kowloon and Hong Kong Island without New Territories would have ruined Hong Kong's economy. Reluctantly, Britain decided in 1984 to begin talks on giving Hong Kong back in 1984. In 1988, China agreed to uphold Basic Law, which would make Hong Kong into an SAR when it gets returned to China, and in 1997, Hong Kong was returned to the PRC.\nIN 1557, the Portuguese Empire made a permanent settlement on Macau, after being given permission from China to dock and trade there. However, it took over Taipa in 1951 and Coloane in 1864, and in 1887, China was forced to sign a treaty to make Macau a permanent colony of Portugal. However, after a military coup overthrew the Portuguese government in 1974, the new government made a promise to give back all the lands it took overseas. In 1986, Portugal and China began talks on how to bring control of Macau back to China peacefully, and in 1999, Macau became an SAR in the PRC.\nRegional status in China.\nAs SAR's, China agrees that \"commercial, social and legal life of Hong Kong/Macau will remain as it is\" until after their first 50 years of being part of the PRC. For Hong Kong, its uninterrupted status will last until 2047, and for Macau, it will last until 2049. Afterwards, the PRC is allowed to rule over Hong Kong and Macau as it pleases."}

On May 26, 1991 the Boeing 767-3Z9ER operating this flight experienced an uncommanded left engine thrust reverser deployment in mid air at 23:17 UTC (ICT) while flying over Burma-Thai border, and broke up at 5,500 feet, killing all 213 passengers and 10 crew members on board, making this the deadliest complete loss involving the Boeing 767 series, and Thailand's worst aviation accident.\nThe aircraft took off at 23:02 ICT, and everything was routine until 5 minutes and 45 seconds into the flight, where the pilots discussed a \"REV ISLN VAL\" warning for about 5 minutes, a warning indicating that the reverser may deploy in flight, and that the reverser may not work on landing. At 23:17 ICT, while climbing through 24 thousand feet, and 15 minutes and one second into the flight, the left engine thrust reverser activated, causing an asymmetrical stall on the left wing side by compromising all of its lift. Almost immediately, this sent the aircraft into a diving left turn with a value of 28 degrees per second, inverting the plane in less than 4 seconds, and causing the air frame to shudder.\nThe captain and first officer were startled, reacting a few seconds after deployment by giving the aircraft's yoke maximum right aileron deflection and maximum left rudder, putting stress on the aircraft's vertical stabilizer composites with little to no effect on the roll. During the descent, the aircraft entered a vertical dive, continuing to roll to the left slowly until it was completely inverted, rolling over still to about 45 degrees, upside down. Massive yaw and torsional overload forces ensued after the left engine was shut down within 10 seconds of reverser activation, and desperately trying to pull the aircraft out of its descent, the aircraft, already having passed it's maximum mach operating speed, began to break up in the air, the vertical and horizontal stabilizers disintegrating first.\nThe aircraft entered a diving speed of Mach 0.99, or very close to the speed of sound, when the heat from the air resistance caused the fuel in the tanks to heat up and explode, sending the aircraft into the ground engulfed in a fireball. All 213 passengers and 10 crew members died."}

Their headquarters are in Springfield, Massachusetts. The company was founded in 1852. Smith &amp; Wesson's pistols and revolvers have become standard issue to police and military forces. Smith &amp; Wesson firearms are very popular among sport shooters.\nSmith &amp; Wesson is also known for the many types of ammunition it has introduced over the years. Many cartridge calibers bear the S&amp;W name. For example, the .500 S&amp;W Magnum.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nHorace Smith and Daniel B. Wesson founded the Smith &amp; Wesson Company in 1852. The purpose was to develop a lever action pistol. But by 1854 the company was failing. They sold the company to a shirt manufacturer named Oliver Winchester. In 1866, Winchester renamed the company Winchester Repeating Arms Company. That same year Smith and Wesson formed the second company called Smith &amp; Wesson. Their timing was right. Not long after they built their new factory in Springfield, the American Civil War started. \nThe Civil War.\nOne of the most popular pistols during the war was the Smith &amp; Wesson Model 2. Many Civil War soldiers purchased the No 2 revolver privately. Between 1861 and 1874, over 77,000 were produced. Smith &amp; Wesson became so profitable that the two partners were the wealthiest men in Springfield by 1865.\nLate 1800s.\nOne of the most popular calibers during the Civil War was the .44 caliber. The partners realized they needed to produce a pistol in this caliber. By 1870 S&amp;W introduced the .44 metallic cartridge which was a major improvement over the .44 percussion cap models used in the war. To use this new cartridge, the company introduced a larger pistol known as the Smith &amp; Wesson Model 3. It featured rapid loading and reloading. The gun was a personal favorite of Wyatt Earp. In 1875, at age 65, Smith sold his share of the company to Wesson. He still advised his former partner in business matters.\nIn 1880 S&amp;W introduced the first double-action revolver. It was designed to use the .32 S&amp;W caliber cartridge. By this time Wesson's three sons, Walter H., Frank L., and Joseph H., were active in the company. In 1887, Frank L. Wesson died but his brothers continued as partners in the company. \nIn 1887 a new concealed hammer design for police was made. Variations of this design are still being made. In 1899, S&amp;W brought out its most famous design, the Military &amp; Police pistol. It was a double-action which set a standard for modern revolvers. It also introduced what has become a very popular caliber, the .38 S&amp;W Special. It is still one of the most popular revolver cartridges ever produced. Large numbers of S&amp;W .38 special handguns were sold to police and military worldwide. They were used in both World War I and World War II. They remained popular until they were finally replaced by many police and military organizations by Semi-automatic pistols.\nEarly 20th century.\nIn 1904, Daniel B. Wesson died. But without his guidance the two sons could not agree on the future direction of the company. This period of weak leadership continued for some time. In 1908 the company introduced a new line of .44 caliber pistols called the .44 New Century, but was soon renamed the Smith &amp; Wesson Triple Lock. It used a new cartridge developed by S&amp;W, the .44 Special.\nWorld wars.\nSmith &amp; Wesson received large government contracts for military revolvers from the American government. The company expanded to produce the firearms. But management problems, labor disputes and a new workforce all caused problems for production. As a result, the US government stepped in to manage S&amp;W until the end of the war.\nAfter the war a surplus of military arms and imports of low cost guns caused sales to drop. Under Harold Wesson, the company manufactured other items to try to keep up profits. They made sewing machines, handcuffs, washing machines and toilet parts. But none of these items made the company profitable.\nAbout this time, bullet-proof vests came into use. Gangsters quickly adopted them so that bullets traveling at under 1,000 fps would not penetrate them. S&amp;W immediately began experimenting with improved bullets. They also used the famous firearms expert Bill Jordan as a consultant to help develop a new much more powerful handgun. What resulted was the first magnum cartridge, the S&amp;W .357 Magnum. In 1935 they released the Smith &amp; Wesson Model 19. Using a 125 grain bullet traveling at 1600 fps, it could easily defeat the body armor of the time.\nWorld War II and after.\nBy the start of the war S&amp;W was nearly bankrupt. The company was now run by Carl R. Hellstrom. Under his management the company concentrated its efforts on handguns and the company began to expand. In 1965 the Wesson family sold the company to the Bangor Punta corporation. The company began producing firearms accessories as well as firearms. In 1884, S&amp;W was sold to Lear Siegler who, in 1986, was acquired by Forstmann Little &amp; Company. Forstmann &amp; Little was mainly interested in Siegler's aerospace and automotive lines. So they sold Smith &amp; Wesson to Tomkins plc, a British holding company. Under Tomkins, S&amp;W developed a number of semiautomatic pistols. This included several using the new .40 S&amp;W cartridge. During this time handgun sales declined. Because of anti-gun lawsuits, operating costs began to rise.\nClinton agreement.\nOn March 17, 2000, Smith &amp; Wesson made an agreement with US President Bill Clinton. It agreed to make changes in the design and distribution of its firearms. This was in return for \"preferred buying program\" to offset the loss of revenue as a result of anticipated boycott.

Some of them are:\nIn the region there are some notable waterfalls such as the Angel Falls, high, in Venezuela, and the Kaieteur Falls, high, on the Potaro River in the Pacaraima Mountains of Guyana.\nClimate.\nAs a whole, the Guiana Shield region has a tropical climate characterized by a relatively high mean annual temperature over at sea level. Because of the Guiana Shield is just north of the equator, its climate varies primarily according to elevation and the effects of the trade winds. The trade winds blow from the east and northeast, off of the Atlantic Ocean onto northeastern South America.\nThe heaviest rains usually occur between May and August, whereas the rainy season from December to January is shorter and less intense, with rains mostly along the coast. In areas where there is only one rainy season, the driest part of the year is January to March; in areas where there are two rainy seasons the driest months are March and October. However, even during most dry seasons, frequent storms provide adequate moisture to allow evergreen tropical moist forests to persist in most low elevation parts of the region.\nThe climate data for Santa Elena de Uair\u00e9n weather station () in La Gran Sabana at an altitude of are:.\nPlant and animal life.\nSince the individual peaks in the Guiana Highlands have been isolated from each other for millions of years, many plants and animals have evolved in a different way on each mountain.\nMany of the mountains are covered in permanent clouds and mist washing all the soil away, and leaving barren rock and water. Because of this many plants are carnivorous and feed on insects and small animals.\nSo far over 2,000 species of plants been found, and more than 50% are endemic to this region, meaning they are found only here, and many are only found on one peak.\nMineral resource.\nSome minerals are found in large amounts in the Guiana Shield; diamonds, gold and bauxite are some of them. The large-scale mining of these, and other minerals, is creating some environmental problems.\nProtected areas.\nIn the Guiana Shield, there are several protected areas, as National parks or reserves; some of them are:"}

After the\u00a0Emperor\u00a0made offerings to the gods, the disasters subsided and a tradition was begun.

Nowadays, the massive procession illustrates the high regard in which the festival would have been held. There are men on horseback, giant bouquets of flowers, ornately decorated ox drawn carts, and a large retinue of women in kimono accompanying the year's Saio.\nTraditionally, the\u00a0Saio\u00a0was a young female member of the\u00a0imperial family\u00a0who was the high priestess of the Kamo Shrines. During festivals, the Saio performed rituals at the shrines. In the modern era, a different unmarried woman from Kyoto is selected each year to be Saio.

Pyruvate, the conjugate base, is an important part of several metabolic chemical reactions. Pyruvate is an important chemical compound in biochemistry.\nPyruvic acid can be made from glucose through glycolysis. One molecule of glucose breaks down into two molecules of pyruvate. These are then used to give more energy to living animals, plants and microorganisms. It is then changed back to carbohydrates (such as glucose) by a metabolic chemical reaction named gluconeogenesis, or to fatty acids through a similar reaction. It can also be used to make the amino acid alanine and can be converted into ethanol or lactic acid by fermentation.\nPyruvic acid gives energy to cells through the citric acid cycle, when oxygen is present (aerobic respiration), and also makes lactate when oxygen is lacking (fermentation).

Some, such as the B chromosomes of maize, contain sizeable euchromatic segments, and therefore do code for some products.\nIt seems unlikely that supernumeraries would survive in a species unless there was some positive advantage. In a few cases this has been identified. For instance, the British grasshopper \"Myrmeleotettix maculatus\" has B chromosomes with a satellite DNA. They occur in warm, dry environments, and are scarce or absent in humid, cooler places.\nIt is thought that B chromosomes are parasitic elements like selfish DNA. Various scenarios have been suggested as to how they arose."}

The movie was adapted from Walter Lord's book of the same name.\nPlot.\nThe RMS \"Titanic\" is christened for its maiden voyage. Passengers and crew get on board the ship. The ship departs from port on April 10, 1912 and heads out into sea.\nThe ship receives a number of ice warnings from other ships. However, only a few of the messages are sent to Captain Edward J. Smith. The captain does not slow down the ship, or consider an alternate route.\nLate on Sunday, April 14, one of the lookouts sees an iceberg in front of the ship. \"Titanic\" turns hard to port and tries to avoid the iceberg. But the ship eventually hits the iceberg on its starboard side. The first five compartments, below the waterline, are ripped open. Thomas Andrews, the ship's maker, inspects the damage. He then learns the ship will sink within two hours. Making matters worse, the ship does not have enough lifeboats for all the people aboard.\nA distress signal is sent out. The radio operator on the RMS \"Carpathia\" hears the distress call, understands the emergency and alerts Captain Arthur Rostron. Rostron, right away, orders the \"Carpathia\" to head to the \"Titanic\" at full speed. But unfortunately, it will take four hours to reach the \"Titanic\".\nCaptain Smith orders Officers William Murdoch and Charles Lightoller to begin lowering the lifeboats. Women and children are let on the boats first. However, the women and children are not that happy about getting into the lifeboats. They are then forced into the boats by officers.\nThe \"Carpathia\" is racing to the \"Titanic\" site. Before \"Carpathia\" can get there, though, \"Titanic\" sinks.\nOn the \"Carpathia\", Lightoller is told by Rostron that only 705 people have survived. They have only passed one body. \nHistorical inaccuracies.\nAs with many \"Titanic\" movies made prior to 1985, this movie shows \"Titanic\" sinking in one piece. But in reality, the ship broke in two before sinking.\nReception.\nThe movie won several awards, including a Golden Globe Award for Best English-Language Foreign Film."}

{"id": "573737", "revid": "584566", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=573737", "title": "Creos Luxembourg S.A.", "text": "Creos Luxembourg S.A. owns and manages electricity networks and natural gas pipelines in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.\nHistory.\nCreos was formed as a result of a deal to unite Cegedel S.A. \u2013 the Grand-Ducal electricity company of Luxembourg, which was founded in 1928 and at the time distributed 70% of the electricity in the country - , Soteg S.A. \u2013 Luxembourg's primary gas supplier - and Saar Ferngas AG \u2013 a distribution company created in 1929 in Saarland. On 23 January 2009, all the unites of ownership from Cegedel S.A. and Saar Ferngas AG were transferred to Soteg S.A., which made restructuring with retrospective effect on 1 January 2009, giving birth to a new energy group. Named Enovos, it included the parent company Enovos International S.A. and the two main subsidiaries: Creos (formerly Cegedel S.A.) in charge of network activities, and Enovos Luxembourg S.A. in charge of production, sales and marketing. Enovos and Creos each have a subsidiary for the German market: Enovos Deutschland and Creos Deutschland.\nOver the next two years, Creos consolidated its position on the Luxembourg market. In 2010, it acquired the natural gas networks from Luxgaz Distribution S.A.. On 1 January 2011, the City of Luxembourg transferred its electricity and natural gas networks and its teams to Creos in exchange for owning units of property in Creos. The publicly owned units of property thus increased from 5.71% to 24.57%. Creos also owns units of property in the following companies: Luxmetering (the Interest Economic Group which pilots the smart metering network) since 2012, Balansys (joint-venture between Creos and Fluxys Belgium) and Ampacimon since 2015 and NEXXTLAB since 2018.\nIn order to make a difference between the parent company and its subsidiaries \u2013 energy provider Enovos and grid operator Creos \u2013, Enovos International is now called Encevo. End July, private equity firm Ardian sold its stake up to 24.92 percent in Encevo to China Southern Power Grid International, the second grid operator in China and in the world. \nBusiness sector.\nCreos Luxembourg S.A. plans, constructs and maintains the electricity and natural gas transmission and distribution networks in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Its subsidiary Creos Deutschland Holding GmbH, which is the owner of the companies Creos Deutschland GmbH, Creos Deutschland Stromnetz GmbH, Creos Deutschland Services GmbH und net4nergy, organises the transmission of medium- and high-voltage electricity and high-pressure natural gas in Saarland and Rhineland-Palatinate.\nIn Luxembourg, following the liberalisation of the energy markets, an independent organisation \u2013 the Luxembourg Institute of Regulation (ILR) \u2013 organises and supervises access to the networks. The tariffs are subject to its approval. The energy suppliers are thus guaranteed transparent access to Creos's networks.\nInfrastructure.\nElectricity network.\nThe majority of the electric current in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg comes from Germany via two double high-voltage 220,000 volt (220 kV) lines that are connected to the German network. Interconnection with Belgium has become operational with the commissioning of a phase shifting transformer (PST) at the Schifflange Centre in October 2017, and around 15% of the energy is produced locally (biogas, cogeneration, wind turbines, hydroelectricity and photovoltaics). The electricity is transmitted to the six transformer stations (Flebour, Roost, Itzig/Blooren, Heisdorf, Bertange and Schifflange) where the voltage is reduced from 220 to 65 kV and is distributed to industries and large municipal distribution networks. The voltage is then reduced from 65 kV to 20 kV in more than 60 transformer stations in the whole country. The electric energy obtained is distributed to SMEs, towns and villages where the transformers reduce the current voltage to 0.4 kV before distributing it to the final consumer. A control centre, known as Electricity Dispatching, controls and manages these high and medium-voltage networks.\nThe total length of the Luxembourg electricity network managed by Creos is 10,123 kilometres, including 593 kilometres of high-voltage lines, 3,702 kilometres of medium-tension lines and 5,828 kilometres of low tension lines.\nNatural gas network.\nThanks to its connections with Germany, Belgium and France, Luxembourg is linked to the interconnected gas networks throughout Europe. Monitored by Dispatching Gas, the high and medium-pressure pipelines distribute the gas to 60 communes that are connected to the national gas network. Pressure-reducing stations that supply the local networks then reduce the gas pressure. Creos distributes natural gas in 45 communes.\nSince 1 October 2015, Creos and Fluxys Belgium, in collaboration with their respective regulators ILR and CREG, have united the national markets of Luxembourg and Belgium into one Belux market. This integration, the first between two European Union member states, reflects the will of the European Union to create an European gas market without borders,. Balansys, the joint venture between Creos and its Belgian counterpart Fluxys, will become the balancing operator in the Belux zone from 1 June 2020. In other words, it will be responsible for ensuring that the gas market is well supplied, without one of the two suppliers having to pay an entry fee for its gas on the other's market.\nOperations centres.\nCreos has four regional centres. They build, operate, maintain and repair the electricity and natural gas networks.\nThe Roost Centre covers the central and northern regions. It covers the high, medium and low-voltage electricity services and the medium and low-pressure natural gas services, the central store and the mechanical and electrical workshops.\nThe Schifflange Centre covers the southern part of the country.\nThe Luxembourg City Centre covers the capital and the communes of Strassen and Hesperange. Headquarters and Luxembourg City Centre will merge in a new single location in November 2021.\nThe Contern Centre manages and adjusts the meters, in particular smart meters.\nDispatching for electricity and natural gas together with the monitoring rooms for remote network control and management are installed in Bettembourg since 2020.\nSmart grids, electromobility and energy management.\nCreos is involved in two national projects; smart grids, electromobility and energy management.\nIn accordance with the law of 7 August 2012 that transposes the European Energy Efficiency Directive into Luxembourg legislation, all the gas and electricity meters must be changed in the country, independently of the network operator. By the year 2020, Creos will thus install 300,000 smart meters that record detailed information on the consumption and production of energy in the entire territory of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, including 250,000 electricity meters and 50,000 gas meters. The installation of these new electricity and gas meters \u2013 called Smarty \u2013 in Luxembourg homes will allow the creation of networks with real intelligence: smart grids. These smart grids are capable of monitoring decentralised electricity production (like wind turbines and photovoltaic panels), regulating the variations of the feeds into the distribution networks with greater precision and managing the demand peaks linked with the charging of electric vehicles more effectively. The law from 7 August 2012 also demands that the metering system must be able to receive water and heating,.\nCreos will install 800 public charging stations for electric cars and hybrid plug-in cars across the country. Each charging station will incorporate two charging points, and the network \u2013 called Chargy \u2013 will include 1,600 parking spaces for electric vehicles. Creos will be responsible for the deployment, operation and maintenance of the public charging infrastructure on its distribution network, representing a total of 749 stations out of the 800 that are to be installed. In January 2021, Creos inaugurated the first two Superchargy ultra-fast charging terminals at Kirchberg, a district of Luxembourg City. By 2023, 88 SuperChargy direct current (DC) terminals will be extended along the country's main roads and motorways, as well in some Park &amp; Ride (P&amp;R) car parks, i.e. 19 locations in all.\nCreos is also preparing the Third Industrial Revolution of the country. This convergence of IT, renewable energy and means of transport will have an impact on how the power grids are managed. To anticipate this evolution, the grid operator joined forces with Powerdale S.A. to create NEXXTLAB, an entity that aims to develop innovative solutions in the field of energy management in coordination with the widespread introduction of electro-mobility.

To \"cherry pick\" is to use the one failed study to \"prove\" that the medicine is useless. It is a type of confirmation bias, where a person sees evidence for what they want or expect to see, and ignores evidence which goes against their belief.\nThe term cherry picking comes from when people harvest cherries from a tree - the cherry picker only takes the reddest, ripest fruits. If someone looked at all the fruit the person had picked, they might think that all the cherries were red, until they went to the tree and saw lots of pale, unripe cherries still on it.\nCherry picking as a term is quite negative, as it implies that the person doing the cherry picking is trying to deceive the audience, or simply does not care about the facts.\nWhen applied to subjects like medicine and science, cherry picking is considered \"bad science\". or a sign of pseudoscience.\nCherry picking can take several forms. The most obvious case of cherry picking is where only evidence that supports a given argument is used, and other evidence which does not support it or goes against it is ignored or covered up. Other examples can include giving a lot of emphasis to evidence which supports the idea but barely any to other evidence, and taking a quote out of context so that it seems to have a different meaning than it originally did.\nPseudoscience is when untrue claims are made to appear as though they have a scientific basis, even though they do not. Many pseudoscientists cherry pick real scientific evidence to support their claims. It is quite common in science for some studies to contradict others, for example in cases where different methods are used to measure an outcome, or where human error or chance may lead to unusual results. This means that there is often a study someone can use to support their claim, and they can cherry pick that one study even if many more contradict it."}

Iraee was released from prison on January 3, 2017 after a 71-day hunger strike by her husband and a protest on Twitter that got international attention, but she was returned to prison January 22, after her husband stopped his hunger strike.\nStoning to death is controversial in Iran, and often used against women. In 2010 there was strong international criticism of Iran because of the case of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani. Ashtiani was freed in March 2014, after nine years on death row. Another Iranian woman, Fariba Khalegi, is believed to be in prison and in danger of stoning. \nArrest.\nIn September 2014, the Iranian government searched the home of Golrokh Ebrahimi Iraee and her husband Arash Sadeghi (Farsi: \u0622\u0631\u0634 \u0635\u0627\u062f\u0642\u06cc) in Tehran. The guards took laptops, notebooks and CDs. They found an unpublished story Iraee wrote about stoning a woman. In the story, a young woman watches the movie, \u201cThe Stoning of Soraya M\u201d, becomes angry, and burns a copy of the Koran.\nAfter the story was found, Iraee and her husband Sadegh were arrested by four men believed to be from the Revolutionary Guards. They took Sadegh to Evin Prison, but they took Iraee to a secret place for three days. They did not allow her to see a lawyer or to talk to her family. Then they took her to Evin Prison. For 17 days, they questioned her for hours, blindfolded her, and threatened to kill her. While they interrogated Iraee, she had to listen to the guards kick and choke her husband in the next cell.\nTrials.\nIraee had two short hearings. Her first hearing was about her husband's political activity. She was not permitted to speak. During the second hearing she was in the hospital after surgery, but the court would not look at her medical records. Her first lawyer was pressured to drop her case, and her second lawyer was prohibited from representing her. \nIn October 2016, Iranian officials called Ebrahimi Iraee on a friend's telephone and told her to go to Evin Prison to start serving a six-year prison sentence. They did not have an arrest warrant, as the law requires. Iraee was convicted of \u201cinsulting Islamic sanctities\u201d and \u201cspreading propaganda against the system.\u201d\nAmnesty International called on the Iranian governement to set Iraee free. According to Philip Luther, Research and Advocacy Director for the Middle East and North Africa, \"She is facing years behind bars simply for writing a story, and one which was not even published \u2013 she is effectively being punished for using her imagination. Instead of imprisoning a young woman for peacefully exercising her human rights by expressing her opposition to stoning, the Iranian authorities should focus on abolishing this punishment, which amounts to torture.\"\nHunger strike.\nOn October 24, Iraee's husband Sadeghi went on a hunger strike in prison to protest Iraee's imprisonment. There were demonstrations outside Evin Prison, which is very unusual. Even though Twitter is prohibited in Iran, a Twitter campaign used the hashtag #SaveArash On January 3, 2017 Iraee was set free, and Sadeghi stopped his hunger strike. Sadghi's family said he was having many medical problems, including vomiting blood, and respiratory, heart, kidney and gastrointestinal problems. They took Sadeghi to the hospital, but after only a few days, on January 7 they returned him to prison, even though the doctors said he needed to be in the hospital.\nIranian authorities said Iraee and Sadegh could be temporarily out of prison on bail if they got property bonds worth 7 and 10 billion rials (US$300,000) for Arash Sadeghi and 5 billion rials (US$150,000) for Golrokh Ebrahimi Iraee.\nIraee brought a property deed for the bail, but the government said they had a new order, and that Iraee must return to prison. Iraee refused to return to prison, but when she tried to visit her husband in the hospital, on January 22 the Revolutionary Guards at Sarallah Headquarters forced her to return to Evin Prison.\nImprisonment conditions.\nGolrokh was transferred from Evin prison to a prison in the town of Varamin in March 2018. At this time Golrokh and fellow human rights defender, Atena Daemi were being held in a quarantine section of Shahr-e Rey prison. It has been reported that the conditions are poor, with the activists still wearing the same clothing as when they arrived. \nAs of 9 March, Golrokh Ebrahimi Iraee, who suffers from severe muscular pain, had been on hunger strike for over one month (35 days), and had reportedly been forcibly given IV fluids since her arrival to the prison."}

Koken received a patent for the first electric Barber\u2019s Chair. \nMusic.\nKoken started playing banjo at the age of thirteen. \u201cIn 1959, my brother had broken his arm, and heard that playing guitar might be a good way to get its strength back. He got his old guitar with a warped neck and high strings, and started strummin\u2019 it. I really thought that was neat, and one day he came to me and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get a banjo, and we\u2019ll make some money?\u201d\nSince 1965, Koken has played in multiple bands: the Busted Toe Mudthumpers, the Muskrat Ramblers, the Fat City String Band, the legendary Highwoods Stringband, and The Cacklin\u2019 Hens and Roosters Too!. \nCurrently, he plays fiddle-banjo duets with his partner and soul-mate Clare Milliner, as well as with Milliner, Kellie Allen, and Pete Peterson as the old-time string band, Orpheus Supertones. In 2011, Koken completed his multi-year literary collaboration with Clare Milliner, \"The Milliner-Koken Collection of American Fiddle Tunes.\""}

The Act of 1750 also prohibited the colonies from producing finished iron goods. The Iron Act was part of the policy of Mercantilism that favoured England in which materials from the colonies, in this case pig iron and iron bar, were used to make different products in England - finished goods had a higher value than the raw materials.\nImplications.\nThe act was officially repealed in 1867.\nMany colonies produced iron but the Middle Colonies of Pennsylvania, Delaware, New York, and New Jersey are perhaps most strongly associated with this industry. However Virginia and then Maryland were the first colonies to export iron to England. In fact\u00a0 the Maryland Legislature passed an \u201cAct for the Encouragement of an Iron Manufacture within this Province\u201d in 1719. Maryland and Virginia were the only colonies majorly affected. The act essentially stopped all creation of edged tools, nails, and tinplates. Great Britain had a history of creating acts designed to create more trade to England. This was one of the many acts that caused the American Revolution."}

They are American citizens whose ancestors were Irish.\nWho they are.\nPeople are called Irish Americans if: \nHistory.\nMost Irish people came to the United States between the 17th to mid-19th centuries.\nThe largest number of Irish people came to the United States between 1820 and 1860. During this time, one out of every three people who immigrated to the United States was Irish.\nBetween 1820 and 1860, 1,956,557 Irish arrived in the United States. 75% of these immigrants - about 1.5 million Irish people - came after the Great Famine of 1845-1852 (also called \"The Great Hunger\". Many more Irish people died while trying to travel to America on coffin ships.\nBetween 1820 and 1930, about 4.5 million Irish people moved to the United States.\nWhere they lived.\nMost Irish people who came to the United States during the 1800s lived in big cities where there were many other Irish people. They did this so they could help and protect each other. Many stayed near the ports where they arrived, like Boston, New York City, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. Many Irish people also lived in Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, and Baltimore.\nDiscrimination.\nMost of the Irish immigrants who came to America in the 1800s were Catholic. At that time, most of the United States was controlled by Protestants who were ethnically English, Anglo-Saxon, and Germanic.\nMany Irish immigrants were treated badly. For example: \nSome politicians spoke out against Irish people. For example, in 1836, Benjamin Disraeli wrote:\nIn the mid-1950s, a political group called the Know-Nothing Movement tried to get Catholic politicians fired from their jobs.\nStereotypes about Irish Americans did not go away. For example, President Richard Nixon once said: \nIrish Americans today.\nIn 2013, about 33.3 million Americans - about one in every 10 - reported having some Irish ancestry. This is about seven times the number of people who actually live in Ireland."}

Bloomeries were the first smelters able to smelt iron. The result of using a bloomery is a mass of iron and slag called a bloom. This is called sponge iron, because it is porous like a sponge. Sponge iron is usually refined into wrought iron. Bloomeries are no longer used in smelting, because blast furnaces are better.\nProcess.\nA bloomery consists of a chimney with heat-resistant walls made of earth, clay, or stone. Near the bottom, pipes (made of clay or metal) enter through the side walls. The pipes allow air to enter.\nTo use a bloomery, charcoal is inserted into the chimney, then heated. Then roughly the same volume of iron is inserted. A common product of this process is fayalite, which occurs when iron mixes with slag.\nHistory.\nIron began to be used around 1200 BC.\nChina appeared to not use bloomeries, seemingly skipping to blast furnaces. However, bloomeries have been found in China, though these were likely only brought from other locations, and not built in China.\nBloomeries had been used in Sub-Saharan Africa before 500 BC.\nEuropean Bloomeries started very small, smelting about 1kg of iron with each use, but got larger over time, smelting about 14kg on average in the fourteenth century."}
