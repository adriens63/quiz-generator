Britons living in India instead preferred thoroughbreds and polo ponies, and reduced the reputation of the Marwari to the point where even the inward-turning ears of the breed were mocked as the \"mark of a native horse\". \nUses.\nThe Marwari horse is a riding horse; it may also be used for shows, horse safaris, sport, ceremonial &amp; religious purposes, and during earlier days in war. Within the Marwari horse breed was a strain known as the Natchni, believed by local people to be \"born to dance\".

From the Anglo-Indian word \"pye\" or \"pa\u00eb\" and Hindi \"p\u0101h\u012b\" meaning 'outsider', the Indian pariah dog is sometimes referred to as the pye-dog (also spelt \"pie\" or \"pi\") and the Indian native dog. It is popularly known as Desi Kutta or Desi Dog (which derives from the Urdu word \"desi\", meaning \"native\"), as well as the Indi-dog or In-dog (in various spellings). It was referred to in the works of Rudyard Kipling as the \"yellow pariah dog\".\nHistory.\nThe pariah dog of India is an ancient autochthonous landrace that is found all over India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and even beyond South Asia. A pariah-like dog skull was discovered in the ancient Indian site of Mohenjo-daro and prehistoric rock art depicting a dog of similar type has been found in the Bhimbetka rock shelters. It was featured on National Geographic Channel's film, \"Search for the First Dog\" along with the other ancient types such as the Canaan Dog of Israel and the Australian dingo.\nIndian Pariah dogs make for loving family pets and are great with kids and adults. They are high on energy and complement kids with an active lifestyle. Indian pariah dogs are one of the oldest dog breeds in existence today. \nArchaeological findings indicate that this dog was in existence some 4500 years ago. Excavations in the Mohenjo-Daro site found in the Sindh region of Pakistan (Indus Valley civilisation) revealed an Indian Pariah dog skull dating to 2500 BCE. Also, there are various cave paintings across the Indian subcontinent that hints at pariah dogs to be one of the oldest dog breeds in the world."}

Today the tribe is more Arabic-speaking.\nHistory.\nThe first mention of the Iznasen in this area is from 11th century sources when they speak of the conquest of Oujda by the Almoravids. The Almoravids initially hesitated to attack Oujda, because the Iznasen would be too strong an obstacle there. The tribe belonged to the Zenata tribes, where the name Iznasen also comes from, just like the masters and founders of Oujda, the Maghrawids.\nThey played an important role under the Merinids because they were entrusted with the governorship of large parts of eastern Morocco. Later, in 1908, they were the first Moroccan people to successfully revolt against the French colonizer. Although the French were initially forced to leave the area, they were able to pacify the tribes with great force in January 1909.\nEtymology.\nIznasen in the Berber Zenati language is the plural of \u201cAznas\u201d which is composed of \u201cAzn\u201d meaning \u201cSend\u201d and \u201cAs\u201d meaning \u201cThe Day\u201d. Iznasen literally means \"Those who send (during) the Day\".\nLayout.\nThe Iznasen tribe consists of four main groups:\nLanguage.\nThe east of Morocco, like many other areas in Morocco, is a very varied area in terms of language. Beni Iznasen contains both Arabic-speaking and Berber-speaking political groups. Bilingualism sometimes occurs, especially in the older generations. The younger generations usually only speak Arabic.\nArabic.\nThe Arabic dialect of eastern Morocco is a so-called Hilali dialect, which shows similarities with the dialects of, for example, Marrakech and Casablanca, in contrast to the urban (pre-Hilali) dialects of, for example, Fes and the north of Morocco. Furthermore, this Arabic dialect shows strong similarities with the dialect of western Algeria (Tlemcen), which borders the Beni Iznasen area.\nBerber.\nThose who speak the most the Iznasen Berber are the older generations of Iznasen people. The Berber dialect of eastern Morocco shows similarities with East Riffian and the Berber of Beni Snous tribe near Tlemcen in Algeria.\nSince the officialization of the Berber language in Morocco in 2011, a reberberization process is underway because the language is again taught to new generations in Moroccan schools.

Bhagyaris could be found in the wild in the region of Pothowar up to Azad Kashmir regions. Bhagyaris near the region of Murree are furry compared to the dogs found in plains of Punjab due to temperature adaptation over time. This type is a herding dog from Pakistan, with a long history alongside humans. The word \u201cBhagyari\u201d Its names, comes from the root word of the Punjabi language \"Bhagyaar,\" which means \"wolf.\" \"Kutta\" means \"dog.\" within the Punjabi language, comes from the breeds obvious resemblance with the Asian wolves. People say this breed was born out of a combination of a wolf and a domestic dog, a very long time ago. It is also called the Pakistani Shepherd Dog, due to the area where it can usually be found in. There are different theories on the origin of the Bhagayari Kutta. According to the most popular theory, the Pakistani Shepherd Dog originated between a wolf and a domestic dog of some type, hence the name Pakistani Shepherd Dog (meaning \u201cwolf dog\u201d). If you have ever seen an Asian (Pakistani) Wolf, you will see that the Pakistani Shepherd Dog really resembles that type of wolf.\nOverview.\nPakistani Shepherd Dogs are very strong and muscular dogs. They have a rounded forehead and dark, almond-shaped eyes. Their lips are black and their nose is mostly black. Their feet have very hard soles. Adult Pakistani Shepherd Dogs have erect ears. The coat of the Pakistani Shepherd Dog is usually black and tan, but can be gold, and some can come in white, which is rare but does occur. The colours vary from region to region. They are very keen and love to herd animals, sometimes even little kids and their owners. They are dedicated to their work, courageous, fearless and alert. Very protective of their property, owners and sheep, they can be trained easily because they love to learn new things. Pakistani Shepherd Dogs are very loyal toward their work and handler, loving their family. They obey their owner\u2019s every command. The Pakistani Shepherd Dog has a loving nature and is very playful with children, enjoying playing games. This breed is bred to work, and can't sit idle all the time. Being able to work is their passion. The Pakistani Shepherd Dog loves strenuous activity, preferably combined with training of some kind, for these dogs are very intelligent and crave a good challenge. When not being worked they need to be taken on a daily, brisk, long walk, jog or run alongside you when you bicycle. While out on the walk the dog must be made to heel beside or behind the person holding the lead, as in a dog's mind the leader leads the way, and that leader needs to be the human. Most shepherds love to play ball or Frisbee. This breed does best with a job to do. Without enough exercise, mental and physical, it will become bored and destructive, which will affect its good temperament."}

The rules in Esperanto never change and can always be applied in the same way.\nArticles.\nEsperanto has only definite article \"la\" (the same thing as \"the\" in English) and no indefinite article (the same thing as \"a\" or \"an\" in English). They use definite article when they talk about things, about which they have already told something.\nNouns and adjectives.\nNouns end with \"-o\". For example, \"patro means \"father\". To make a noun plural add -j. For example: \"patroj means \"fathers\".\nAdjectives end with \"-a\", adverbs end with \"-e\", for example \"granda means \"big\", \"bona means \"good\", \"bone\" means \"well\".\nThe \"-n\" ending is the mark of the direct object (the Accusative case) in nouns and adjectives. For example:\nIn adjectives and adverbs is comparison made by words \"pli\" (\"more\") and \"plej\" (\"most\"). For example:\nPronouns.\nSo, to say how old somebody is in Esperanto, just say:\nVerbs.\nVerbs end with \"-as\" when they are in present tense. English uses \"I am\", \"you are\", \"he is\". But in Esperanto, there is just one word for \"am\", \"are\", \"is\" - \"estas\". Similarly, \"kuras\" can mean \"run\" or \"runs\". Infinitives end with \"-i\". For example, \"esti\" means \"to be\", \"povi\" means \"to can\". It is easy to make past tense - always add \"-is\" ending. To make future tense, add \"-os\". For example:\nMany words can be made opposite by adding \"mal\" at the beginning.\nExamples of sentences which show the rules:\nYes/No questions.\nTo make a yes-or-no question, add \"\u0108u\" at the beginning. For example:\nUnlike in English, they can answer to a yes/no question only \"jes\" (yes) or \"ne\" (no).\nNumbers.\nThe numbers are:\nNumbers like twenty-one (21) are made by their compounding by order of magnitude. For example: \"dek tri\" means thirteen (13), \"dudek tri\" means twenty-three (23), \"sescent okdek tri\" means six hundred eighty-three (683), \"mil na\u016dcent okdek tri\" means (one) thousand nine hundred and eighty-three (1983).\nPrefixes and suffixes.\nEsperanto has over 20 special words which can change the meaning of another word. People put them before or after the root of a word.\nThese words combined can make very long words, such as \"malmultekosta\" (cheap), \"vendredviandman\u011dmalpermeso\" (prohibition of eating a meat on Friday).\nPrefixes.\nPrefixes are added before the root of the word.\nSuffixes.\nSuffixes are added after the root of the word, but before the ending."}

Franklin Delano Roosevelt was already president, and he was running for reelection. Republican Wendell Willkie ran against him. It was the 39th presidential election in United States history. This was the only time anyone has ever been elected to a third term as President of the United States.\nFranklin was not sure whether he wanted to run for president again. He waited to see what would happen with the war in Europe. Then he decided he wanted to run. At the Democratic convention in Chicago, Franklin Roosevelt's wife, Eleanor Roosevelt, gave a speech to the party, and they chose him to run. Franklin Roosevelt chose Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace to run with him for Vice President. This was the first time a presidential candidate had chosen his own running mate instead of letting the party choose.\nThe Republican Party chose Wendell Willkie. Willkie had run an electric company. He had liked the New Deal until Roosevelt made the Tennessee Valley Authority, which sold people cheap electricity. Willkie traveled to 31 states by train. In his campaign, he told voters he would keep most New Deal programs and talked about how anyone having a third term as president would be bad. \"If one man is indispensable, then none of us is free,\" he said.\nRoosevelt won with 54% of the popular vote. That means 54% of the voters in the United States voted for him. He won 449 out of 531 electoral college votes. Wilke lost with 48% of the popular vote. This was the first time any person had been elected to a third term as President of the United States.\nDuring the campaign, Roosevelt promised Americans that the country would not fight in World War II. Both Roosevelt and Willkie said they would continue helping the Allies in other ways, like the Lend-Lease program.\nAfter Willkie lost the election, he supported the New Deal programs and getting ready for war. He wrote an essay called \"One World,\" which was about preventing more wars after WWII was over. He died of a heart attack in 1944."}

The force was originally known as the West Yorkshire Metropolitan Police. Some older signs around the Force area, such as the one near the Millgarth Police Station in Leeds city centre, read 'West Yorkshire Metropolitan Police'. The 'Metropolitan' from the police title was removed in 1986 when the Metropolitan counties were ended.\nSuggestions made by the Home Secretary on 21 March 2006 would see the force join with North Yorkshire Police, South Yorkshire Police and Humberside Police to form a better police force for the entire region, but this suggestion failed.\nOn 12 December 2006, Sir Norman Bettison was announced as the new chief constable, replacing Colin Cramphorn and resigned from his position on 24 October 2012. He was replaced by Temporary Chief Constable John Parkinson until Mark Gilmore was made chief constable on 1 February 2013.\nIn 2018, it was thought West Yorkshire Police would lose 400 officers from its 4,800 officers due to austerity."}

The temples' pond is said in the \"Puranas\" to have been created from the teardrops of Shiva, after he wandered the Earth inconsolable after the death of his wife Sati. The pond occupies an area of two kanals and 15 marlas, with a maximum depth of 20 feet. The temples were visited by India's former deputy prime minister Lal Krishna Advani in 2005. In 2006, the Pakistani government began restoration works at the temples, with further improvements announced in 2017.\nPlace name.\nThe name of the temple complex is believed to derive from the Sanskrit word \"kataksha\", meaning \"tearful eyes.\" The pond was originally referred to as \"Viskund\", or \"poison spring\", but was later referred to as \"Amarkund,\" \"Chamaskund,\" and finally \"Katakshkund,\" meaning \"Spring of tearful eyes.\" The pond in Urdu and Persian is referred to as \"Chashm-e-Alam\", meaning \"Sorrowful/Tearful Eyes.\" while some of his tears collected in two ponds, one of which is the pond around which the Katas Raj Temples are set, while the other is at Pushkar, near the famous Sufi pilgrimage centre of Ajmer Sharif. The sacred pond in the complex is believed by Hindus to be filled with Shiva's tears after the death of his wife Sati. The water in the pond is of high clarity.\nHistorical significance.\nThe temples play a role in the Hindu epic poem, the \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\", where the temples are traditionally believed to have been the site where the \"Pandava\" brothers spent a significant portion of their exile. It is also traditionally believed by Hindus to be the site where the brothers engaged in a riddle contest with the Yakshas, as described in the \"Yaksha Prashna.\" Another tradition states that the Hindu deity Krishna laid the foundation of the temple, and established a hand-made \"shivling\" in it. The temples are considered to be the second most sacred site in the historic pre-1966 East Punjab region, after the temple at Jwalamukhi in modern Himachal Pradesh (Northern India). Therefore they can be considered as the \"National Hindu Temple of Pakistan\", a potential for all Indian Yatris or Shaivite worshipers respectively.\nArchitecture.\nThe Katas site houses the \"Satgraha\", a group of seven ancient temples, remains of a Buddhist stupa, five other medieval temples, havelis scattered around a pond considered holy by Hindus.\nThe temples at Katas are mostly constructed on square platforms. The elevation of the sub shrines seems to form a series of cornices with small rows of pillars, crowned by a ribbed dome. The seven temples were built in an architectural style similar to Kashmiri temples, with dentils, fluted pillars, trefoil arches, and rooflines that are pointed. The Shiva temple is also built on a square platform. Its entrance is a recessed round arch with faint cusps and a rectangular opening to the north.\nRecent history.\nIn January 2017, Pakistan's government began installation of \"shikharas\" on the temples. In February 2017, 200 pilgrims from India traveled to the temple to participate in the \"Katas Raj Dham\" festival. In 2018, Pakistan issued visas to 139 Indian Hindu pilgrims to visit Katas Raj dham.\nMurtis (idols) of Hindu gods were placed in the seven temples, at a cost of Rs. 51.06 million. A three-member archaeological team visited India, Sri Lanka and Nepal to collect murtis of various Hindu gods."}

The supported programming paradigms are imperative, object-oriented, declarative using nested structures, functional and natural programming. Console and GUI applications can be developed with Dragon. It was first released in the year 2018 by Aavesh Jilani. The syntax is a bit of similar like Python but instead of indentation Dragon uses structural and procedural syntax approach.\nAs of the 1.9.7 version Dragon started supporting procedural syntax along with the structural syntax. It is used for the block of codes similarly like the Visual Basic .NET uses. Although both syntax can be used together in a program. There is a keyword \"end\" to complete the code block in procedural syntax for the loops, functions, classes, and conditions.\nUses.\nDragon has three VM versions. Although it doesn't have own VM, It uses the JVM, LLVM and IKVM. It generates the VM instructions to any of these VM to execute the tasks. The LLVM based version is known as Dragon Native, It is the fastest one among all versions. \nSome things that Dragon is often used for are:\nSyntax.\nTo print something using the standard output, Dragon has the 'show' keyword and 'showln' for output in newline.\nFunction creation with structural syntax\nWith procedural syntax."}

It is the 5th episode of the \"Treehouse of Horror\" series. It was first broadcast on the Fox network on October 30, 1994. The episode has three parts: \"The Shinning\", \"Time and Punishment\", and \"Nightmare Cafeteria\".\nStory.\nThe Shinning.\nMr. Burns hires the Simpson family to look after one of his buildings. Burns takes away television and beer because he thinks they will work harder this way. Groundskeeper Willie learns that Bart can hear his thoughts. He tells Bart to let him know if Homer starts to act strange. Homer starts to act crazy because he does not have television and beer. Moe Szyslak (as a ghost) says to Homer that he will give him a beer if Homer kills his family. Marge gets a baseball bat to protect herself from Homer. Homer gets scared when he sees himself in a mirror and faints. Marge puts Homer in a pantry to make him calm down. Homer starts to think normally again, but then gets taken by Moe and other ghosts. Homer later makes the family run away by chasing them with an axe. Willie tries to stop him but gets killed with Homer's axe. Homer is about to kill his family, but Lisa tells him she found a television screen in the snow. Homer starts acting normal again and the family freezes after watching television in the snow. \nTime and Punishment.\nHomer accidentally puts his hand in a toaster twice. He tries to fix the toaster, but he makes it become a time machine. The toaster takes Homer to an era with dinosaurs. He remembers when Grampa told him not to change anything in the past. Homer kills a mosquito and the present becomes a dystopia where Ned Flanders is the ruler of the world. Homer goes back to the past to try to stop himself. He accidentally kills a fish from the past and makes Bart and Lisa very big in the present. Back in the past, Homer sneezes and makes all of the dinosaurs die from the common cold. The Simpson family becomes wealthy in the present, but he leaves when he learns no one knows what donuts are. In another present, Groundskeeper Willie tries to help Homer go back to the real world. Willie then gets killed with an axe by Maggie. Homer goes from the past to the present many times. He then finds a present world where almost everything is normal again. He sees the family eating using long and stretching tongues, but thinks it is normal enough.\nNightmare Cafeteria.\nPrincipal Skinner thinks that his school's detention room has too many children in it. The school's lunchlady must give out poor quality meat for lunch. Skinner thinks that eating the children will help with both problems. Students Jimbo Jones and \u00dcter Z\u00f6rker are killed and made into food. Bart and Lisa learn what Skinner and the lunchlady are doing. They learn from seeing children in detetion put in a cage and killed. Bart, Lisa, and Milhouse later become the only children in the school to still be alive. Skinner and the lunchlady make Bart, Lisa, and Milhouse trapped above a blender. Groundskeeper Willie tries to help them but Skinner hits him with an axe. Bart, Lisa, and Milhouse fall and get killed by the blender.\nIt is then shown that Bart was just dreaming the story. Marge tells him not to worry about it. Fog starts to get inside their house and makes the family's skin become muscles. They then start singing a parody of a song from \"A Chorus Line\". While they sing, Santa's Little Helper starts to eat Bart.\nProduction.\nDavid Mirkin made the episode have more violence and blood than the \"Treehouse of Horror\" episode before it. He said he was not happy with the Congress wanting there to be less violence in the episodes. He later called the episode the most \"disturbing Halloween show ever\". The episode starts with Marge saying that the episode is too scary to be shown. This was put in the episode because of how scary people thought the episodes were. Mirkin thinks Halloween episodes can be \"scary as well as fun\"."}

The game features downloadable content that includes offline play and additional skins, with some based on other Namco games, but you must pay for it.\nReviews.\nPac-Man 99 received a 76 out of 100 on review collector Metacritic, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\"."}

A minor is a child younger than the legal age of an adult. \nThe most common kind of child abduction is when parents take their children, in what is also called parental child abduction. In 2010, that happened 200,000 times in the United States. This often happens when a marriage breaks up.\nThe exact legal situation is very complex, and varies between countries. All countries have laws defining legal adulthood, and most have laws about age of sexual maturity (age when young people may decide for themselves about their sexual activities with other people), and laws about drinking alcohol and other activities. Also, there are usually laws about abduction or kidnapping by strangers (people unknown to the child). "}

He fought in the American Revolutionary War. He was also a member of the British Parliament\nEarly life.\nClinton was born in 1730 in Newfoundland, Canada. His father was Admiral George Clinton, who was friends with the Duke of Newcastle. George Clinton was governor of New York Colony starting in the 1741, and Henry Clinton went to New York Colony in 1743.\nMilitary career.\nWhen he was 15 years old, Henry Clinton joined the New York Colonial Militia. In 1749, he had a captain's commission and went to Britain.\nSeven Years' War.\nDuring the Seven Years' War (French and Indian War), Clinton started as a captain of the Coldstream Guards and later became a lieutenant colonel.\nHenry Clinton was aide de camp, or army assistant, to the Prince Brunswick from 1760 to 1762. He learned how German soldiers fought.\nBetween the wars.\nHenry Clinton became one of the few North-American-born British citizens to become a member of the British Parliament. He served from 1772. He also became a major general.\nAmerican Revolutionary War.\nIn 1775, Clinton fought in the Battle of Bunker Hill and won. In 1776, he fought in the Battle of Long Island and had ideas about how to defeat the Continental Army in New York City. The ideas worked, and George Washington and the Continental Army ran away to New Jersey. He was knighted for winning battles in New York.\nIn 1778, Clinton became General in charge of all the British army in America. He decided to fight mostly near the Atlantic Ocean. He took troops out of Philadelphia and sent them to New York instead. Most of the battles in the later part of the war were in the South, but Clinton stayed in New York and fought in the Hudson Valley.\nIn June 1778, Clinton made the Philipsburg Proclamation, which said all slaves who joined the British military would be freed.\nIn 1780, Clinton began communicating with Benedict Arnold, a Continental soldier who wanted to change sides to the British. Clinton, Arnold, and John Andre started a plan for Arnold to give West Point to the British. The plan stopped when Andre was caught as a spy.\nLater career.\nMany Britons blamed Clinton for losing the war. Clinton stayed a member of the British Parliament until 1784. He was offered the job of governor of Gibraltar in 1793, but he died before he could do it.\nFamily.\nClinton married Harriet Carter in 1767. At the time, she was twenty years old. She died in 1772 after having a baby."}

The castle's multiple building phases are clearly indicated by the different colours of the stonework: grey limestone and red or yellow sandstone. The walls are around 12 metres (40 ft) high and, on the safer cliff edge, are just 0.91 metres (3 ft) thick while those elsewhere are 2.97 metres (9.75 ft) thick.\nToday.\nToday, Chepstow Castle is open to the public and managed by CADW, the Historic Environment department of the Welsh Assembly Government. The castle has suffered over the centuries but it remains well-preserved in parts and is of great interest to historians as it has not suffered any misguided restorations which might have masked its original medieval features."}

The intentional depositing of ceramic vessels supports this interpretation. The period when the structure was built was the Bronze Age. At this time, the culture of this region, the Terramare culture was changing a lot. The society was changing from mostly individual little farms to larger communities. Plowing and irrigation were increasingly used.\nThere were many artifacts that had been placed in the tank at different times. These were made of stone, wood, other plant material, and fired clay. The archaeologists recovered \"about 150 whole vases, 25 miniature vessels, 7 clay figurines, numerous examples of baskets, handles or bands, spindles, shovels and four plows or parts of these made of wood or other vegetal tissue\"\nInterestingly, there was an older tank underneath. It had been built about ten years earlier. It had collapsed during or shortly after construction. Some of its materials were re-used in the later tank."}

The Shippens were a powerful family in Philadelphia.\nAmerican Revolutionary War.\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, Shippen's parents tried to stay neutral. Her older sister Elizabeth married a colonel in the Continental Army. When the British Army occupied Philadelphia, Peggy Shippen made friends with Major John Andr\u00e9. They wrote letters back and forth to each other after Andr\u00e9 left Philadelphia.\nIn 1779, when she was nineteen years old, Peggy Shippen married Benedict Arnold, a general in the Continental Army. Later, Arnold decided to defect, or change sides, and fight for the British instead. Historians do not know whether Peggy Shippen tried to get him to make this decision, but she helped him after he did. Shippen helped him meet with John Andr\u00e9 and then sent letters between the two men using codes. Shippen helped Arnold become the commander of West Point so he could trade it to the British Army.\nWhen Arnold was caught, Peggy helped him escape and destroyed evidence. When George Washington and Alexander Hamilton showed up at West Point, she pretended that she had not known about Arnold's plan. She pretended to be surprised and upset. She pretended so well that both Washington and Hamilton believed her.\nPeggy was not put in jail, but the city council of Philadelphia told Shippen she could not live there any more. She went to New York City, which the British Army held at the time.\nAfter the war.\nAfter the British Army surrendered at the Battle of Yorktown, Benedict Arnold and Peggy moved to London. The king and queen liked Peggy. King George III gave her \u00a3350 for helping the army and Queen Charlotte gave her a yearly payment of \u00a3100.\nPeggy Shippen went back to Philadelphia for a visit in 1791. People there did not like her, and some even protested. When Benedict Arnold died in 1803, Shippen found she owed money to many people. Peggy Shippen died in 1804.\nIn popular culture.\nShippen is a character in the television series \"Turn\". In the series, she has a romance with John Andr\u00e9."}

It was largely an Italian phenomenon, based on nothing, on emptiness, on the invisible, the pieces are an \"\"empty space\".\nThe Publishing manifestos of \"International Exhibition of Nothing\"it has been a feature of the invisible art movement led by Piero Manzoni.\nHistory.\nInternational Exhibition of Nothing is an exhibition invented in 1960 by a group of artists including Piero Manzoni, Enrico Castellani, Carl Laszlo, Heinz Mack, in which an exhibition of invisible works was represented, the exhibition will then be exhibited again a year later in the Netherlands.\nIn 2015, the exhibition is once again held in Milan in collaboration with the Manzoni Foundation, which will also exhibit the original \"Manifesto\" of the time, which was published in Basel in 1960.\nConcepts of the invisible.\nCollectors, the fetishists of and best of all, will never really buy the work, but the instrument that allows it to become one, and which remains a constant testimony (fetish itself, then) that the truth doesn\u2019t actually make you can ever truly own it .\nThe disappearance of the artwork, its evacuation also as an object after being subtracted as a \u201cwork\u201d, as a displayed artifact, is the passage summarized between the choice of \u201cZero\u201d (ZERO) and the choice of \u201cZero\u201d. \u201cMoi aussi je suis contraire au titre \"\u2018Zero\u2019\". \"\u2018Nul\u2019\" est beaucoup mieux. [\u2026] W NUL\u201d. \nManzoni writes to Henk Peeters, who is organizing the exhibition, which will open on March 9, 1962 at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. The abandonment of the starting point is the abandonment of the project, the step-by-step of the construction choice, which, even if without intentions and statements, becomes proof only by existence. The idea of \"Zero\" was theoretically foreseen in 1960 by the drafting of the \"Manifesto against Nothing for the International Exhibition of Nothing\", signed in Basel by Manzoni with Brock Base, Enrico Castellani, Rolf Fenkart, Carl Laszlo, Mack, Onorio, Piene and Herbert Schuldt, in which it is said that: \u201cCanvas is hardly worth canvas. Sculpture is almost as good as no sculpture. A car is almost as beautiful as no car. Music is almost as enjoyable as no noise. No art market is as fruitful as the art market. Something is almost nothing (nothing) \u201d.\nThe legacy of Vacuum.\nThe exposition of the void is a kind of \"non-exposition\" in a completely Dada key, promoted by the editor of the magazine \"Panderma\" Carl Laszlo, which leaves traces in the Manifesto against nothing for the International Exhibition of Nothing, published in Basel:\"Sale of nothing, numbered and signed. The price list is available to the public. No one will speak at the inauguration. Nothing is reproduced on this catalog\". The signatories are Laszlo, Manzoni, Castellani, Rolf Fenkart, Mack, Piene, Herbert Schuldt, and others.\nThe exhibition of the emptiness, in which invisible works are exhibited, picks up the concepts of Yves Klein, Gino De Dominicis, and Marcel Duchamp but also the concept of ready readymade by Andy Warhol, Salvatore Scarpitta, Jeff Koons and the innovative concept of the invisibility of Salvatore Garau."}

Most of the time, when people talk about protective hairstyles, they mean natural African hair. A protective hairstyle tucks the ends of the hair into a braid, twist, or other shape so that they do not show. This stops the hair from moving, which makes it less likely to break or wear out.\nAccording to hair artist and author Jennifer Lord, protective hairstyles keep hair from being too dry. They also make it so the person does not have to brush or move the hair as often. This helps the person \"retain length,\" meaning their hairs will not break. A person with a protective hairstyle also does not need to spend much time styling his or her hair every day.\nHistory.\nPeople have worn protective hairstyles for all of history. Archaeologists have found proof of protective hairstyles from 30,000 years ago. Some Egyptian bodies from 3000 years ago had protective hairstyles.\nLaw.\nHair and hairstyles are part of the history of race on Earth. In some places, for example the United States, employers have told employees, usually African American employees, to go home and change their hair or else be fired. People with African hair must take time and spend money to change their hair so it looks like a white person's hair. Some places have passed Creating a Respectful and Open World for Natural Hair (CROWN) laws. CROWN laws are anti-discriminiation laws. This means an employer cannot fire an employee for wearing a protective hairstyle and cannot force an employee to try to make their hair look like a white person's hair. For example, New York State added rules about protective hairstyles to its human rights law in 2019."}
{"id": "852840", "revid": "22027", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=852840", "title": "I Am (Garau)", "text": "Io sono (which translates to \u201cI am\u201d) is an artist's multiple by the Italian artist Salvatore Garau. Manufactured between March 2020 and September 2020, during the Covid19 era, the pieces are an \"empty space\", with a certification papers signed by the artist sold at 18,000 $., and next for $32,000 for a paper certification with Garau signature, the price value for Sal Garau oil on canvas become more then $350.000.\nPublic presentation.\nThe \"Invisibile Sculptures\" of Garau were first exhibited at the Piazza Scala of Milano, in front of Galleria di Piazza Scala (Gallerie d'Italia), whose museum collection contains his works. Salvatore Garau organised an elaborate photo shoot and a short film to ppromote the event. He was to write later in the year that the bodies had sold well.\nLike Piero Manzoni, by making a purely transient work, that would deflate before the buyer\u2019s eyes, Garau was parodying the traditional sculptural emphasis on permanence and mocking the traditional emphasis on the artist\u2019s creative force. He was also wanted to launch a sign of closeness for the social distancing due to the Covid19 pandemic, but above all to launch a provocation against NFTs for environmental protection and energy consumption.\nHistory.\nIn May 2020, during the end of the Covid19 pandemic, Salvatore Garau sealed a card attesting to the existence of an invisible sculpture. In the months when the museums were closed, he created in a square a rectangle of white tape outside, in front of the Art Museum in Piazza della Scala in Milan, which contains one of his paintings, 1.50 x 1.50 meters, to which he applied an identification tag, translated into four languages (Italian, French, English and German), with the title \"Buddha in contemplation\" along with the signature of the artist.\nThe artist price can be established in grams of pure gold, by direct exchange that did not involve the transfer of money, and by establishing a link between value and gold similar to that of the gold base. Later Garau carried out a second imaginary conceptual work, \"Aphrodite che piange\" by installing a white circle in front of the US Stock Exchange on Wall Street in New York City.\nIn Milan, in 2021, a private collector obtained the sample titled \u201cI am\u201d for $18,000, including auction fees, a new world auction record.\nRelated works.\n\"Fiato d\u2019artista\".\nThe most famous related work is the \"Fiato d\u2019artista\" (\"Artist\u2019s Breath\"), involving red, blue or white balloons inflated by Piero Manzoni himself, closed with string and lead, with the name \"Piero Manzoni\" punched into it, then attached to a wooden base with a plaque on it using gesso. The pieces were made in 1960, and 11 examples are known to have survived, although all are now in an extreme state of decomposure. When exhibited now, the works inevitably assume the aura of a modern memento mori, featuring a rotting plastic membrane stuck to a polished wooden base, with a brass plaque commemorating the original act.\nInfluences.\nGarau is known to have been heavily influenced by Marcel Duchamp and Yves Klein, who had released 1001 blue balloons on the opening night of his \"Proposition: Monochrome\" exhibition at Iris Clert\u2019s gallery, 1957, but with a completely new, romantic and reflective approach and conceptual meaning, which once again involves the viewer in creating his works interactively as he did at the Venice Biennale with the interactive work \"Tiepolo in becoming\".\nSalvatore Garau, as Marcel Duchamp said, considers that the true symbolic value of a work lies in the relationship with the body of the artist (it is the artist sanctified by the market), whose manifestations therefore take on, in the dimension of the critic. Here is a paradox, a value equivalent to that of the remains: the \"Imprints\" and the signatures, the \"Fiato d'artista\", the \"Artist feces\" by Piero Manzoni are just as many examples.\nAndy Warhol would later use balloons with nothing inside, in a similar way, but filled with helium rather than suspended in a stream of compressed air. Indeed, his first balloon, made in 1965, corresponded to an unfulfilled project described by Manzoni in a letter as \u2018a cluster of pneumatic cylinders, elongated in shape, like steel, which would vibrate in the blowing of the wind.\u2019 Damien Hirst has used ping pong balls suspended in compressed air, but within the context of floating above a bed of sharp knives or a skeleton.\nHis most lasting influence, however, was on Arte Povera, a group of Italian artists, including Alighiero Boetti, who brought everyday materials into their work in a movement analogous to contemporary radical politics. (see Protests of 1968) \nBut it is also a tribute to Garau's friend, Michelangelo Pistoletto, with whom he made the exhibition \"Il Clandestino\", who created the installation \"We are fragments of the large mirror\"."}

On its southern slope, directly at the village of Flatz, a strongly rugged wall abyss, the Auf der Kehr, extends over about one kilometer, with free wall heights up to about 100 meters. Overall, the Auf der Kehr resembles the well-known Hohe Wand.\nSettlement.\nThe Auf der Kehr is an old settlement area. Human bones and artefacts have been found in the Long Hole, suggesting that there has been at least a temporary settlement since the early Stone Age. In the late Bronze Age (around 1000 BC) there was a small mining settlement along the southern slope below the Auf der Kehr. Several houses stood on artificial settlement terraces, the remains of which were built in the course of the expansion of the forest road network at the end of the 20th century. Century were found. Copper ore was smelted on the opposite slope of the G\u00f6sing.\nPaths and huts.\nOn the western edge of the wall is the \"Neunkirchner Naturfreundehaus\", which is only open on weekends, but is open all year round. The base of the wall as well as the wall edge are well developed with paths, with numerous accesses to the climbing routes. The Willi Gottwaldsteig leads off the forest roads, but without climbing sections, up to the refuge.\nClimbing area.\nThe Auf der Kehr is a well-developed climbing area with a dozen via ferrata routes in the difficulties 0-D (the most difficult route is the E60 route with C/D) and over 100 climbing routes up to about difficulty grade IX. The most famous secured via ferratas are (from west to east):\nOne of the \"most beautiful 'very easy' climbing routes in the foothills of the Alps\" also leads to the Auf der Kehr: the historic Doppelsteig in difficulty grade II.\nCaves.\nThe Auf der Kehr is rich in caves.\nBibliography.\nAll information is in German.\nClimbing:\nSpeleology:"}

She worked for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), at Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. She also worked for the organisation that was there before NASA was founded in 1958. In 1951, she started at National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). At first, she was a computer, a person doing advanced scientific calculations. She took advanced engineering classes and, in 1958, became NASA's first black female engineer. Today, she is known as an important figure in what is known as the Space Race.\nLife.\nAfter 34 years at NASA, Jackson had earned the most senior engineering title available. She realized she could not earn further promotions without becoming a supervisor. She accepted a demotion to become a manager of both the Federal Women's Program, in the NASA Office of Equal Opportunity Programs and of the Affirmative Action Program. In this role, she worked to influence the hiring and promotion of women in NASA's science, engineering, and mathematics careers.\nIn 2016, the book \"Hidden Figures: The American Dream and the Untold Story of the Black Women Who Helped Win the Space Race\" was written, about her life. The book was also made into a movie, released the same year. \nIn 2019, Jackson was posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. In 2021, the Washington, D.C. headquarters of NASA was renamed the Mary W. Jackson NASA Headquarters. NASA held a virtual ceremony for the naming.\nLegacy.\nThe 2016 film \"Hidden Figures\" recounts the NASA careers of Jackson, Katherine Johnson, and Dorothy Vaughan, specifically their work on Project Mercury during the Space Race. The film is based on the book of the same name by Margot Lee Shetterly. Jackson is portrayed in the film by Janelle Mon\u00e1e.\nIn 2018, the Salt Lake City School Board voted that Jackson Elementary School in Salt Lake City, Utah, would from then on be officially named after Mary Jackson rather than (as it used to be) after President Andrew Jackson.\nNASA's headquarters building in Washington, D.C. was renamed the Mary W. Jackson NASA Headquarters on February 26, 2021."}

It happened at night on September 20, 1777 in Pennsylvania. British fighters led by Major General Charles Grey surprised Continental fighters led by General Anthony Wayne at night near what is Malvern, Pennsylvania today.\nIn September 1777, the British army was in Philadelphia. They had made the Continental Army run away from the city. George Washington decided to keep the Continental Army nearby so he could watch the British Army. They also needed the supplies stored at Reading, Pennsylvania, so he put the Continental Army between Philadelphia and Reading.\nGeneral Anthony Wayne had troops near Chester, Pennsylvania. He thought the British did not know he was there, but they did. Wayne and his men camped near Paoli Tavern on the night of September 20. During the night, General Charles Grey's men came out of the woods and Anthony Wayne's men mostly ran away. The British either killed or captured 272 Continentals.\nBattle.\nOne Hessian soldier said, \"We killed three hundred of the rebels with the bayonet. I stuck them myself like so many pigs, one after the other, until the blood ran out of the touch hole of my musket.\"\nMost of the Continentals lived, but many had bad injuries from being hit with bayonets or swords.\nThe battle of Paoli was fought with bayonets, which are long blades that soldiers put on the ends of their rifles. There was almost no shooting. General Grey told his men not to fire their weapons as guns. He told them that this would tell the Continentals where they were. He also told them that this way, they would know anyone firing a gun was an enemy. This would make them less likely to kill men on their own side in the dark. Major John Andre said what Grey said:\nIt was represented to the men that firing discovered us to the Enemy, hid them from us, killed our friends and produced a confusion favorable to the escape of the Rebels and perhaps productive of disgrace to ourselves. On the other hand, by not firing we knew the foe to be wherever fire appeared and a charge (of bayonets) ensured his destruction; that amongst the Enemy those in the rear would direct their fire against whoever fired in front, and they would destroy each other.\nOutcome.\nMajor General Charles Grey told his men to take the flint out of their guns. This way, the guns would not make sparks that the Continentals could see and would not fire by accident, making gunshots that the Continentals could hear. They took the Continentals by surprise. For this, Charles Grey got a nickname: \"'No Flint' Grey.\"\nGeneral Anthony Wayne was court-martialed, but the court decided he had only made a mistake and not acted dishonorably.\nAmerican writers called the battle a \"massacre,\" or brutal killing. This was propaganda to get readers to believe the British were bad. General Anthony Wayne would tell his fighters to \"remember Paoli\" in later battles. Some British fighters also thought Grey had not done the right thing. British Colonel Charles Stuart called the Battle of Paoli a murder."}

The book is from the English novelist John Cleland. It was first published in London in 1748. The book was written while the writer was under debtors' prison in London. \"Fanny Hill\" is the first pornography that uses the form of the novel. The novel was one of the most prosecuted and banned books in history.\nPublishing histories.\nThe novel was published under two installments, the first being 21 November 1748 and again in February 1749 by Fenton Griffiths and his brother Ralph.\nAt first there was no governmental reaction to the novel. But in November 1749, just over a year after the first installment for the book was published, John Cleland and Ralph Griffiths were arrested and charged for \"corrupting the King's subjects\". Cleland then abandoned the novel in the courts. The book was withdrawn.\nAs the novel became more popular, pirate editions started appearing. \nThe book later began coming into the United States. In 1821, a Massachusetts court outlawed \"Fanny Hill\". Its publisher, Peter Holmes, was found guilty for printing a \"lewd or obscene\" novel. Holmes appealed to the Massachusetts Supreme Court. He then said the judge, relying only on the prosecutor's description, hadn't even seen the book. The state Supreme Court, however, wasn't having it.\nPlot.\nThe novel is associated under two letters. They appear as volumes I and II under the original edition. They are written by Frances \"Fanny\" Hill. She is a rich English woman in middle age. She leads the life of contentment with her husband Charles and their children under an unnamed acquaintance who is known only as \"Madam\". Fanny has been talked into recounting 'scandalous stages' of her earlier life. Fanny proceeds to do that, having the 'stark naked truth' for her governing principle. \nThe first letter begins with the short account of Fanny living under poverty during her childhood in a Lancashire village. At age 14, she loses her parents to smallpox. She arrives in London to look for domestic work. She gets lured into a brothel. Fanny sees two sexual acts: one with an ugly older couple, the other between a young attractive couple. She then participates in a lesbian romance with Phoebe, a bisexual prostitution. A customer, Charles, convinces her to escape. Fanny loses her virginity with Charles. She becomes his lover. Charles is sent away under deception to the South Seas. Fanny is driven under desperation and poverty to become the kept woman for a rich merchant named Mr H\u2015. Mr H\u2015 later abandons her. She then becomes a prostitute for the wealthy clients of a pleasure house. This is the end of the first letter.\nThe second letter begins with the reflection on the tedium with writing about sex. Fanny then tells of her adventures in the house of Mrs Cole. They include a public orgy, a bogus sale of her \"virginity\" to a rich dupe named Mr. Norbert and a sadomasochistic session.\nFanny later retires from prostitution. She becomes the lover for a rich and worldly-wise man around age 60. She becomes wealthy after her lover dies from a sudden cold. Shortly after, she meets Charles again. He has returned to England a poor man. Fanny offer her fortune to him.\nLiterary or movie adaptations.\nBecause of the book's notoriety (and public domain status), numerous adaptations have been produced. Some of them are:"}

He fought in the American Revolutionary War.\nEarly life.\nGrey was born into an important family. He was born at their large house in Howick, Northumberland, England. Grey's father was a baronet. They had lived in and ruled Howick since the 1200s. Grey's two older brothers died before they could have their own children, but when Grey was a boy, he did not think he would inherit his father's land. So he went into the military in 1944.\nMilitary career.\nGrey fought in the War of Austrian Succession, Jacobite Rebellion, and Seven Years' War. He made friends with other British fighters, for example James Wolfe, William Petty, and the Earl of Shelburne. He was aide-de-camp to Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel. Grey learned to fight.\nAmerican Revolutionary War.\nGrey became lieutenant colonel in 1777. He commanded one of General William Howe's brigades. Grey fought in the Battle of Brandywine and surprised General Anthony Wayne at the Battle of Paoli. At Paoli, Grey told his men to charge with their bayonets. Military historians say it was one of the best moves of the entire war. He told his men to take the flints out of their guns so that they would not make sparks that the Continental soldiers could see or fire accidental gunshots that the Continental soldiers could hear. This got him the nickname \"'No Flint' Grey.\" But some people on both sides of the war said Grey had not acted honorably. They called the Battle of Paoli the \"Paoli Massacre\" instead.\nGrey fought at the Battle of Germantown and Battle of Monmouth. He surprised more Continental troops in Tappan, New York and killed them. Later, people would call this the Baylor Massacre.\nIn 1778, King George III promoted Grey to Lieutenant General and made him a knight of the Order of the Bath.\nLater career.\nGrey retired from the army but only for a short while. He went to Howick and built a new house there, Howick Hall. He hired an architect called William Newton. Then Grey worked as an army administrator. He was aide-de-camp to King George III and fought against the French in Belgium and the Caribbean.\nKing George made Grey governor of Guernsey in 1797. He made Grey a baron in 1801. In 1806, he made Grey 1st Earl Grey and Viscount Howick.\nFamily.\nGrey married Elizabeth Grey of Southwick in 1762. They had eight children including Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey."}

The storm became a tropical depression on July 1. It strengthened to Tropical Storm Elsa just under six hours later. Elsa was the strongest July hurricane in the Caribbean Sea since Hurricane Emily sixteen years earlier. The storm was also the fastest-moving tropical cyclone in that part of the Atlantic.\nTropical cyclone notices were posted from the Windward Islands to Cuba several days in advance of the storm. It was downgraded to a strong tropical storm just before moving north of Jamaica.\nThe storm later began threatening western and central Florida. Several days before Elsa was expected to move over the state, the Champlain Towers South was demolished on Independence Day July 4 after having collapsed almost eleven days earlier in the Miami suburb of Surfisde. The related rescue and search operation was suspended for the remaining missing people when forecasts showed Elsa moving very close to the area.\nShortly after the cyclone was named, Elsa began receiving widespread attention for sharing the same name as Elsa from Disney's \"Frozen\" franchise movies.\nRecords.\nElsa became a tropical storm farther east in the Main Development Region (MDR) than any other tropical cyclone so early in the calendar year on record, behind only the 1933 Trinidad hurricane. \nElsa strengthened to a Category 1 hurricane as it was letting it go into warm waters that made the eastern-most hurricane recorded in the MDR, south of 23.5\u00b0N, this early in the calendar year since 1933. \nAround that time, Elsa was moving at a forward speed of 29 mph (47 km/h), making it the fastest-moving Atlantic tropical cyclone recorded undergoing rapid intensification in the deep tropics or the Gulf of Mexico, and also the first storm to undergo rapid intensification in that part of the Atlantic that early in the calendar year since another storm in 1908. \nSince 1950, Elsa is the fourth hurricane that affect the Leeward Islands during July. The others : Abby in 1960, Bertha in 1996 and Emily in 2005."}

Ten years later, John Marriott signed contracts with Eastern, American and Capital Airlines, and his firm became the first supplier of ready-made lunches for airline flights. In 1957, the company opened its first hotel, the Twin Bridges Marriott Motor Hotel in Arlington, Virginia (now home to the Marriott Museum). In 1964, the 32-year-old son of the company's founder became its president and began its restructuring - new rights to air transportation services were purchased, restaurant chains and hotels were bought.

Weaver had failed to appear in court on firearms charges.\nWhen he was given several conflicting dates for appearing in court, and while a conspiracy was linked with him, Weaver did not wish to surrender. Members with his immediate family, and his family friend, Kevin Harris, also resisted. The Hostage Rescue Team under the Federal Bureau of Investigation got involved after the siege developed.\nWhen the Marshals Service explored the Weaver property, six U.S. Marshals encountered Harris and Sammy Weaver (Randy's 14-year-old son) in the woods near the family cabin. A shootout then took place. Deputy U.S. Marshal William Francis Degan, Sammy Weaver and the Weavers' family dog Striker were killed.

Dr. Pham\u2019s research, published in more than 300 books, journal articles and conference proceedings, includes work in the areas of space domain awareness, space control, cognitive satellite radios, and satellite navigation for control, linear and nonlinear estimation, dynamic resource allocation, and game-theoretic operations research. \nEarly Life and Education.\nDr. Pham was born in Saigon, Vietnam, to a historian (Pham Van Son) and country poet (Bang Ba Lan) family. His parents served in the U.S.-backed South Vietnam government during the Vietnam War and became prisoners of war from 1975 to 1982. Under the Special Release Re-education Center Detainee Resettlement Program (a.k.a. Humanitarian Operation), he and his family and came to the U.S. in the early 1990s. At the time, he was a second-year college student in electrical engineering of at Ho Chi Minh University of Technology and Education in Vietnam, who barely spoke English. Dr. Pham worked hard to learn his new country\u2019s language and though an older student, attended high school at Lincoln High School in Lincoln, Nebraska, graduating three years after arriving in the U.S. While in high school, he worked as a custodian for two hours before school started and in the evenings, he attended the Southeast Community College where he earned a degree of Associate of Applied Science with highest honors in electronic systems technology.\nIn the late 1990s, Dr. Pham went on to earn bachelor (magna cum laude) and master\u2019s science degrees in electrical engineering from University of Nebraska, and in 2004 he received a Doctor of Philosophy in Electrical Engineering from University of Notre Dame under the support of 4-year Arthur Schmidt Presidential Fellowship - making breakthroughs for fundamental understanding of performance uncertainty quantification and management in stochastic dynamical systems.\nCareer.\nDr. Pham began his career at Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) in 2004 as an aerospace engineer after graduating and conducting a 1-year research associate position at University of Notre Dame. He spent the next few years in diverse positions; e.g., in-house researcher, technical lead, project manager, contracting officer technical representative, and government lab advisor across Advanced Spacecraft Mechanisms, Dynamics &amp; Control and Decision Support Systems programs within the Advanced Spacecraft Components Technology branch, honing his technical expertise and subject matter expert in control, estimation, multi-asset autonomy, and multi-level data sensor fusion. So, as Dr. Pham looked back now, he brought systems-theoretic science and control engineering principles, together with teamwork and interdisciplinary to bear fruition in solving warfighter engineering problems, various areas of specific focus for increased activities in space control autonomy and space domain awareness.\nHe contributed to the analysis capability on satellite defense control. The Air Force Materiel Command Commander (General Bruce Carlson) recognized Dr. Pham the Air Force Outstanding Scientist \u2013 Junior Civilian Award. His efforts have revolutionized space command &amp; control autonomy for implementation into satellite pursuit-evasion methods as an Air &amp; Space Force. For these research achievements, he received the prestigious Air Force Civilian Achievement Medal.\nDr. Pham's in-house research published with Springer Verlag, entitled \u201cLinear-Quadratic Controls in Risk-Averse Decision Making: Performance-Measure Statistics and Control Decision Optimization,\u201d ISBN 978-1-4614-5078-8. Ideas of his research monograph revolutionized insights of control systems practitioners to bridge performance-measure statistics over risk-averse feedback control mechanisms and thus providing greater options in system performance reliability. In addition, Dr. Pham was the sole author on another Springer research monograph; \u201cResilient Controls for Ordering Uncertain Prospects: Change and Response,\u201d Springer Optimization and Its Applications, Vol. 98, ISBN 978-3-319-08704-7, that, for the first time, advocates the theoretical constructs and design principles for stochastic controlled systems and multi-person decision optimization.\nLike many scientists and engineers from research laboratories across US Department of Defense (DoD), Dr. Pham attempts to strive without ceasing to adopt advanced knowledge to Air Force missions and DoD. He was selected by the US DoD as the DoD Laboratory Scientist of the Quarter, 3rd Quarter 2019, acknowledging his work begun 5 years ago in some core focus research areas of autonomous radio sensing, precision multi-user access, and agile radio resource management. The result has been delivering innovation and new technology to industry and Air Force programs by finding ways for new space communication technologies to withstand contested radio environments than they do now. Allowing these space communications technologies to withstand contested radio conditions enables more of the space-layer elements for joint all-domain command and control; ambient connectivity; and position, navigation, and timing to the warfighter. All of these may translate into closer standoff proximity operations in warfighting contested environments.\nMuch of his recent work nowadays has been filling the gap, in which a hierarchical feedback framework to design and synthesize a class of hybrid ground and space precoders for multi-gateway multi-beam Satcom is currently missing. As the number of spot beams increases, the spectral resources associated with the feeder links of the gateways are required to increase proportionally. The present investigation explores a potential solution for on-board beam precoding, which is expected to lead to a significant reduction in the requirement of feeder link bandwidth. Relative to the interest of minimizing inter-gateway communication overheads, the advantage of uncooperative gateways is sought in the development of on-ground multi-gateway precoding. This research also has significant impacts to the Air Force missions and DoD. Unlocking commercial and allied access to keep up with demand increases for higher throughput and information superiority has been a major barrier to future US Space Force operations. Thus, there is a need for design principles and operational guidelines that promote much needed science and technology investments on hybrid ground and space beamforming architectures and processes for next generation multi-gateway multi-beam Satcom systems.\nGovernment Services for Academia and R&amp;D Community at Large.\nThe most reward has been his government service for academies and Research and Development (R&amp;D) community at large. The government service at AFRL has allowed Dr. Pham to meet and connect with many outstanding students and faculty across US, while at the same time allowing him to communicate, influence, and collaborate with many entrepreneurs. It gives him many opportunities to gain experience in leading diverse teams of technical professionals across multiple theaters that include forethoughts, cultural differences and multidisciplinary teamwork that have enhanced his \u201cglobal view\u201d of the US Air Force. Like so many others, Dr. Pham is simply motivated by various opportunities to business acumen and gaining soft skills around communications, influencing, and collaborating. And, he might just interest more Asian American Pacific Islander people in Federal service who may have never considered Federal jobs. Working for AFRL has allowed him to go after opportunities to lead, plan, drive strategy, and move from an engineer, to a scientist, and eventual leadership role. Because of work performance, leadership, contributions to society and potential for continued excellence, as Dr. Pham looks back now he thinks he has come to understand what it really means for \u201cVietnamese by birth, American by circumstance, Asian-American by choice.\u201d\nGiving back to his professional society in general and the Asian American Pacific Islander community in particular has always been my frame of mind. To this day Dr. Pham has continued serving as a research adviser for the National Academies\u2019 Associate Research Programs. From there, after initiating various DoD relevant research topics for the Air Force Summer Faculty Fellowship for American Society of Engineering Education, he moved to being Panelists for Evaluation Committee on National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship, National Defense Science &amp; Engineering Graduate Fellowship and Young Investigator Research Program of Air Force Office of Scientific Research, then to being an adjunct research professor for the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of New Mexico and served on multiple dissertation and thesis committees. In these roles, he has advised and mentored numerous summer graduate students and faculty, the majority of them were Asian American professors and students. As a mentor, he actively encourage students to apply for the National Science Foundation and DoD National Defense Science &amp; Engineering Graduate Fellowship programs. As the recipient of the 2018 and 2019 Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers (SASE) Scientist/Engineer of the Year and Professional Achievements Awards, he has not only demonstrated technical leadership to make innovation happened, but also has led by examples with the community leadership and support the Asian American Pacific Islander community with a path forward where most see obstacles.\nThe most satisfaction Dr. Pham has day-to-day is knowing he is able to serve, represent, and motivate a cadre of 100 plus high tech small businesses and entrepreneurs that represents the growth and development of so many future leaders and engineers by means of America\u2019s Seed Fund and the likes. There are so many young scientists and engineers, who just venture into industry. They have modest resources, but they are still able to come up with innovative research and technologies. In essence, Dr. Pham can say that one thing he has learned is being genuine is really how one gets to know the other person and by doing so one will get the same thing back. His technical outreach has impacted multi-million dollars of DoD\u2019s science and technology investments, managed more than 100 research contracts, and interacted with more 70 companies. That is why the 4th Annual Champion of Small Business and Technology Commercialization Award Dr. Pham received in 2018 from Small Business Technology Council meant so much to him and why he continues helping small high tech businesses contribute at higher levels.\nDr. Pham has been a leading advocate for the development of game-theoretic operations research in the fields of military science, technology, and engineering in space domain awareness, space control autonomy, and protected satellite communications since 2004. He has organized and chaired 11 major conferences on sensors and systems for space applications. He was a distinguished guest lecturer at 26th Int\u2019l Conference on Telecommunications, Hanoi, Vietnam, April 2019 and IEEE Military Communication Conference, Norfolk, VA, November 2019. He speaks annually at numerous conferences (American Control Conference, IEEE Aerospace Conference, IEEE MILCOM, etc.), invited talks and tutorials at American universities. Dr. Pham currently serves as Technical Editor of IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems for Intelligent Systems and Guest Editor for IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems\nSpecial Section on Industrial Information Integration in Space Applications.\nProfessional Achievements and Awards.\nIn 2017 &amp; 2018, Dr. Pham made appearances and was interviewed for his outstanding achievements on \u201cVoice of America\u201d, \u201cThe Pride of the Vietnamese\u201d - the largest U.S. international broadcasters celebrating Vietnamese Heritage around the world and the Asian American Engineers of the Year. He takes pride in the fact that my achievements have been made in AFRL. Its reputation is certainly enhanced by his work even as its strong creative environment nurtured his efforts. That relationship testifies to the idea that the pursuit of fundamental knowledge lies at the heart of technological progress, national security, and international leadership, and it exemplifies the importance of DoD\u2019s cadre of career civilian scientists and engineers."}

It was launched on 25 March 1995 by its inventor, programmer Ward Cunningham, to accompany the Portland Pattern Repository website discussing software design patterns. The name \"WikiWikiWeb\" originally also applied to the wiki software that operated the website, written in the Perl programming language and later renamed to \"WikiBase\". The site is frequently referred to by its users as simply \"Wiki\", and a convention established among users of the early network of wiki sites that followed was that using the word with a capitalized \"W\" referred exclusively to the original site.\nHistory.\nThe software and website were developed in 1994 by Cunningham in order to make the exchange of ideas between programmers easier. The concept was based on the ideas developed in HyperCard stacks that Cunningham built in the late 1980s. On March 25, 1995, he installed the software on his company's (Cunningham &amp; Cunningham) website, c2.com. Cunningham came up with the name WikiWikiWeb because he remembered a Honolulu International Airport counter employee who told him to take the Wiki Wiki Shuttle, a shuttle bus line that runs between the airport's terminals. \"Wiki Wiki\" is a reduplication of \"wiki\", a Hawaiian language word for \"quick\". Cunningham's idea was to make WikiWikiWeb's pages quickly editable by its users, so he initially thought about calling it \"QuickWeb\", but later changed his mind and dubbed it \"WikiWikiWeb\"."}

Whales can make different kinds of sounds, including growling and singing. The song of whales is a regular sound made by some whales (for example, baleen whale). Humpback whales make long, complicated songs. Some whales can sing and some cannot.\nScientists are not sure what the songs do. Whales as young as one month old make some songs. Among humpback wales, the male adults sing much more than other whales do, so scientists think it might be males competing for mates.\nUnlike humans, whales do not pass air through vocal cords to make sounds. Bubbles do not rise up from a whale as it makes sounds. Some scientists think whales push air through holes inside their heads, called sinuses. They push the air across tissue called \"phonic lips\" or \"vocal folds.\"\nDue to their life in the water, whales and other marine mammals are very dependent on acoustic communication."}

Many different groups of people live on the Philippines. Between 120 and 187 languages are spoken on the Phiilippines. For over three centuries, the Philippines were a colony of Spain. Amongst others, the Spanish introduced free public schools, which taught in Spanish. For a long time, the United States controlled the Philippines, so English is also commonly understood. In 1935, both English and Spanish were national langues. In the 1970s, when the Phliipppines had become independent, Spanish was dropped as an official language, and standarized version of Tagalog, called Filiipino was added. The 1987 constitution designates Filipino, a standardized version of Tagalog, as the national language and an official language along with English. Fililipino serves as a \"lingua franca.\" It allows people from different language families to communicate.\"\" On October 30, 2018, President Rodrigo Duterte signed into law Republic Act 11106, which declares Filipino Sign Language or FSL to be the country's official sign language and as the Philippine government's official language in communicating with the Filipino Deaf.\nFilpino is used in everyday life, and when people from different language groups want to communicate. The government operates mostly using English. Including second-language speakers, there are more speakers of Filipino than English in the Philippines. The other regional languages are given official auxiliary status in their respective places according to the constitution but particular languages are not specified. Some of these regional languages are also used in education.\nThe indigenous scripts of the Philippines (such as the Kulitan, Tagbanwa and others) are used very little; instead, Philippine languages are today written in the Latin script. Before they became independen in 1946, the Philippines had been a Spanish and an United states colony. Baybayin, though generally not understood, is one of the most well-known of the Philippine indigenous scripts and is used mainly in artistic applications such as on the Philippine banknotes, where the word \"Pilipino\" is inscribed using the writing system. Additionally, the Arabic script is used in the Muslim areas in the southern Philippines."}

It happened on June 9, 1944 in the French town of Tulle. The civilians were executed by German soldiers in the 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich. \nHistoric context.\nAfter the Allies landed in Normandy, on the 6th of June 1944, there were partisan uprisings in most of the Massif central, and also in the Limousin region. They did this to support the allied invasion, and to make it more difficult for the German troops to get to the front line. The massif central is very sparsely populated. Partisans were able to get most of it under their control. They also attacked some of the towns, such as Gu\u00e9ret and Tulle. The German military forces were aware of this, and they took action. On the 7th of June, SS Gruppenf\u00fchrer Heinz Lammerding was given responsibility for the 2nd SS Panzerdivison \"Das Reich\". The division was to be used to fight against the resistance. Later it should head north to support other German troops. Other than fighting the resistance (called Maquis), they committed several crimes against the civilian population, amongst others, in Tulle. \nOn the 7th and the 8th of June 1944, communist troops of the Francs-Tireurs et Partisans (FTP) had entered the city of Tulle. The had also attacked German troops, there were several hundred of them. While they defended themselves, German troops also killed 18 employees of the railway station, in Tulle. These employees were paid for by the Germans, and they wore white scarves, identifying them as civilians (under the Geneva Conventions). Several hundred German troops had been captured and locked in a school building, which was later put in flames. The partisans killed several hundred troops which were trying to escape from the burning school. Towards the evening of July 8, the FTP partisans were able to conquer Tulle. According to German reports \"122 soldiers\" were killed, wounded or went missing. The exact number is not known, and cannot be established today. The first units of the 2nd SS Panzerdivision reached Tulle on July 8. The partisans, who hadn't known they were coming fled from the city.\nThe massacre.\nOn July 9, the German troops of the Panzerdivision took revenge on the civilian population, for \"supporting the resistance\". First, all men between 18 and 45 years old were arrested. They were put in the courtyard of the local arms manufacturer, Manufacture nationale d\u2019armes de Tulle. There there were told, that they would be hanged in the city, in rows of 120 people. Walter Schmald, a SD person from Belgium determined who would be hanged (a triage). Before taking his decision, he talked to high-ranking government officials of the Vichy regime. As these people were collaborating with the resistance movement, they could convince Schmald to spare their friends, and to lower the number from 120 to 99. Next the soldiers of the Panzerdivision hanged these 99 hostages, who were more or less picked at random. They used streetlights and balconies for hanging them. Groups of residents were forced to watch the hangings. One of these groups was a group of about 600 teenagers, who were part of the Arbeitsdienst. Many high-rancing SS officials listened to music and amused themselves, while the soldiers were hanging the men to be executed. Both the people who were forced to watch, and those who were being executed probably heard the music. \nPeter Lieb, a military historian says, that even though the German troops overreacted, and that some of their actions were against the laws of war, the Tulle massacre can still be seen as a form of war reprisal. This does not apply to the Massacre of Oradour, committed a day later. Oradour is near Limoges, about to the northwest. Officially, 642 people were killed in Oradour, which makes it the worst massacre of the Second World War, by the number of victims.\nConvicting those responsible.\nAfter 1945, German courts did not convict Lammerding, for \"Lack of Proof\". In 1951, a court in Bordeaux found him guilty for the crimes he committed in Tulle and Oradour, and sentenced him to death (while absent). The French asked the British, who were occupying the part of Germany where he now lived (and was a successful businessman). to extradite him. The relationship between the two countries was bad, and the British officer in command said, he had never heard of Lammerding. Nevertheless, Lammerding \"vanished\" in 1954. When he reappeared in 1958, the German consitution made it illegal to extradite German citizens. In addition, a contract came into force in 1955, which forbade to rejudge a case which had already been handled by another court of an allied power. This was only changed in 1975, after Lammerding's death (Lammerding died in 1971). "}

It is used when addressing or referring to a person. Sometimes, the term \"honorific\" is used in a more specific sense to refer to an honorary academic title.\nIn the world of the past honorifics were highly visible. The difference between \"Miss\" and \"Mrs\" was fundamental in British social life (and, with variations, throughout Europe). It was not voluntary: you did not write a letter to a female without using the correct prefix.\nTechnical prefixes could be tricky. What do you do if the recipient has several positions or degrees? In German, you would list them all: Herr Dr. Dr. Professor Professor (then addressee's surname). In English, the postscript Esq., for \"Esquire\" was usually added for a man.\nIf the person used the prefixes to refer to himself, that was regarded as low behaviour, egotistical. The one exception was the medical doctorate in the UK. A medical doctor could described himself as Dr. Brown, and he would be understood as being a medic. There were originally no PhDs awarded in British universities, and they were uncommon until after the Second World War. Civil servants signed letters \"Your obedient servant\" to emphasize their intermediate role between government and the people, or between Parliament and the people.\nIt is obvious that the Church and the Armed Forces have honorifics of their own. If, as in the Armed Forces, the use of honorifics is compulsory, are they really honorifics? Similarly with the Royal Families. Compulsory honorifics have been going out of favour. They can be enforced in some cases, but the tendency is to drop them in informal life."}

Many gyms and health spas have steam rooms. Some steam baths, for example the Native American sweat lodge and Russian banya, are also about cleaning the spirit.\nA steam room is heated. It is usually 110\u00b0F to 114\u00b0F (43 to 46\u00b0C). The humidity level is 100 percent so the water hangs in the air.\nHealth.\nMany types of natural medicine and traditional medicine use steam baths. Scientists have also studied steam baths to see what they really do and do not do to help the human body. For example, one study looked at people with allergic rhinitis who took steam baths, some with medicinal plants in the steam and some with steam alone. The scientists saw that the steam bath helped all the patients whether they used plants or not.\nScientists say that sitting in a steam bath is good for circulation, or the flow of blood through the body. This is because the heat and steam make the capillaries get wider. The capillaries are the body's smallest blood vessels. Steam baths can also lower blood pressure and help skin heal.\nSteam baths are good for the skin because they make the person sweat and they make the pores in the skin open.\nSitting in a steam bath after exercising can reduce muscle pain and preserve strength.\nSitting in a steam bath can make the body make more good body chemicals called endorphins and make less of stress body chemicals, for example cortisol.\nSitting in a steam bath can open up the sinuses in the nose, and help people breathe. Some scientists studied people with allergic rhinitis and found a steam bath helped them.\nHowever, scientists have not found that sitting in a steam bath makes anyone lose weight. People who sit in steam rooms for too long can become dehydrated, meaning their bodies lose too much water from sweat. Bacteria and fungi like to grow in warm, wet places, so people with fungal infections should not sit in steam baths.\nTypes of steam baths.\nMany groups of Native Americans, for example the Lakota, use steam baths, also called sweat lodges. People from Europe have been writing about Native American sweat lodges since the 1600s. A sweat lodge is not only for getting the body clean; it is a spiritual thing to do. A sweat lodge is a hut or tent with a pile of hot rocks in the middle. A sweat leader keeps the rocks hot and sometimes pours water on top of them to make steam. Sometimes the leader has everyone pray or sing. People can stay in the sweat lodge for hours, sometimes going outside for a little while.\nSome Finnish saunas are steam baths and some use dry heat.\nSome super sent\u014d bathhouses in Japan have steam baths in them, especially newer sent\u014d."}

In 2020, Forbes ranked Repsol as the 645th largest companies in the world.\nHistory.\nUntil the 1920s, Spain did not have its own oil industry; all oil products were supplied to the country by large multinational companies such as Royal Dutch Shell. In 1927, the Compa\u00f1ia Arrendataria del Monopolio de P\u00e9troleos Sociedad An\u00f3nima (CAMPSA, literally \"Oil Monopoly Company\") was created by the Primo de Rivera directory, which received the exclusive right to buy and distribute petroleum products at prices set by the state. In 1941, the first attempt was made to start oil production in Spain, but it was unsuccessful; by this time, three oil refineries were already working in the country.\nIn 1957, natural gas was also included in the scope of CAMPSA. In 1964, attempts to find oil in Spain were finally crowned with success, although the oil was scarce and of poor quality. The next year, offshore exploration began, and ten years later significant oil reserves were discovered off the Mediterranean coast. In 1965, the state-owned company Hispanica de Petr\u00f3leos (Hispanoil) was founded to search for oil in Spain and other countries. In 1974, the three refineries were united into Empresa Nacional del Petr\u00f3leo (ENPETROL), in which the state owned 72% of the shares. On December 18, 1981, most of the participants in the energy market were united into the National Institute of Hydrocarbons (Spanish Instituto Nacional de Hidrocarburos; INH).\nIn 1987, on the basis of INH, the Repsol company was formed, in which the state owned 100% of the shares. In 1989, an initial public offering (26%) was carried out, that is, the privatization process began, which was completed in 1997 with the sale of the last 10% owned by the Spanish government.\nActivity.\nThe Repsol company makes all types of activities related to oil and gas. It produces oil and gas in 30 countries; it owns 6 refineries (including 5 in Spain)."}

In some bathhouses, people put their whole bodies in the water. In others, people clean themselves using steam or even sweat. Bathhouses are usually communal, which means people take baths together and not alone. Some bathhouses are only about getting clean and other bathhouses are also a place for people to talk to each other.\nHistory.\nIn the early 1900s, archaeologists found ruins of a bathhouse in Mohenjo-daro. This is in Pakistan today. The bathhouse was built around 2500 b.c.e. It was made out of bricks and it might have been part of a temple. Archaeologists found a Jewish mikveh from the 500s c.e. in ruins underneath Syracuse.\nBy 300 b.c.e., bathhouses called \"thermae\" were common in Ancient Roman towns. The Roman writer Tiberius Claudius Secundus wrote, \"Baths, drink and sex corrupt our bodies, but baths, drink and sex make life worth living.\"\nPeople in Japan and Korea have been using hot springs for bathing for thousands of years. People started bathing at the Dogo Onsen on Shikoku 3000 years ago.\nThe Roman Empire and Byzantine Empire affected bathing in the Middle East. The Middle Eastern hammam bath is like a Roman bath: A place to get clean and to talk to other people. In the 600s and 700s c.e., the Umayyad caliphs built baths with mosaic decorations on the floors.\nIn the Medieval period, there were many baths, called hammam in the Middle East. Baghdad may have had 60,000 bathhouses. Unlike in Roman baths, men and women did not bathe together. There were different places for men and women.\nIn Medieval Europe most people who lived in towns went to bathhouses to bathe. The medical book \"Secreta Secretorum\" has a chapter on bathing. It said winter and spring were good times to bathe but that people should not bathe in summer. By 1200 c.e., there were 32 bathhouses in Paris. Bathhouses were often right next to the town bakery so the heat from the ovens could make the water hot. In Germany in the 1400s, some people ate meals in baths. Sometimes bathhouses were brothels in disguise. When the disease syphilis reached Europe, bathhouses became less popular there.\nIn the Victorian period a diplomat called David Urquhart went to the Ottoman Empire, where he saw Ottoman baths. He came back to England and built bathhouses there. A person called Sinan built many baths. Some were for rich people and some were to clean the poor. This happened before indoor plumbing, which let almost every house have its own bathtub.\nPeople in other countries built bathhouses near hot springs too. The most famous bathhouses in the United States may be Bathhouse Row in Hot Springs National Park Arkansas, eight buildings made between 1892 and 1923.\nIn the United States, people built bathhouses, especially during the Progressive Era, when people thought the government should help people live better lives. Indoor plumbing and pipes had made it much easier to be clean. People in the United States thought of being clean as part of being a good person, so rich and middle-class Americans built bathhouses for poorer people. New York City opened the People's Baths in 1891. It was popular, so many other public bathhouses were built. However, these bathhouses were about getting clean, not relaxing. Bathers were not allowed to stay long, and there was no place in the bathhouse to relax or talk with other people.\nAccording to writer Mikkel Aaland, people in Africa south of the Sahara Desert built sweat lodges to make sick people well.\nBathhouses became an important part of gay culture in the United States. The government ordered most of them closed after people in the United States caught AIDS in the 1970s and 1980s.\nShape.\nSome bathhouses are cellular baths, meaning they have many smaller tubs. Other bathhouses are steam baths, with all the bathers sitting around something hot, like hot rocks or fire.\nHealth.\nIn many cultures, people said the bathhouse was good for the health. They especially said this about hot bathhouses, such as saunas and onsen. In Mesoamerica, people said the hot temazcal bath would heal the sick by making evil spirits leave.\nScientists have done experiments to see if baths really do help human health. In addition to keeping the body clean, some types of steam baths or other hot baths can improve circulation, blood pressure and diseases of the nose and breathing."}

It is also refers to bathhouse. The banya has also a wood stove to make heat. The main idea of banya is to cause sweat in the bathers.\nUsually, the banya (wooden house) is near a river. The bathers jump into the river to cool down after being in the banya.\nHistory.\nIn 440 b.c.e., the Ancient Greek history writer Herodotus wrote about people who live in what is Russia today.\nOne early mention of the banya is in the \"K\u00f6nigsberg Letopis.\" The first full description of a banya is in the East Slavic \"Primary Chronicles\" of 1113.\nAt some times in history, women would go to the banya to give birth to babies. After a funeral, the friends and family of a dead person sometimes go to a banya together.\nThroughout Russian history, the banya has been used by people in all classes. Poor workers would get clean in a banya after work. Rich Russians sometimes had private banya. Sometimes, the bather will jump into a river or a pile of snow instead.\nToday, banya have separate places for men and women. Bathers do not have to be naked.\nCommon rules.\nBanya have three rooms: a changing room or \"predbannik\" where people change clothes, a washing room, and steam room or \"parilka\". \nIf the banya is for men and women, bathers should wear bathing suits. If the banya has separate places for men and women, bathers are usually naked.\nProcess.\nBanya are often hotter than 93\u00b0C.\nBathers sit on a small mat to protect their skin from the hot wood. Bathers usually wear felt hats while they sit in the banya. During the banya bath, bathers use a broom or besom. Bathers hit each other with the branches like a massage. Sometimes friends hit each other with branches. Sometimes a professional masseuse does. The last part of the banya is when someone throws a bucket of cool or cold water on the bather. \nThe biggest difference between a banya and sauna are that the banya has steam and most saunas use dry air.\nHealth.\nStarting in the 1800s, doctors and scientists decided to study the banya. They already had an idea that it was good for health. Most of their studies were not good by today's scientific rules, but they told many people to go to the banya for their health.\nFolklore.\nIn Slavic mythology there is a spirit called a bannik that lives in the banya under the bench. The bannik throws hot water or hot rocks at rude bathers."}

To make syllables ending differently, a small symbol is added above the letter (to make it end in 'e' or 'i'), or below the letter, to make the syllable end in 'o' or 'u'. See how the symbol is used below:\nThis symbol is called \"kudlit,\" and is not used for vowels at the beginning of a word, which have their own letters. \nThe Hanunuo, Buhid, and Tagbanwa scripts resemble Baybayin, and are still in use today. \nToday, there's an Unicode block for the Baybayin letters (called Tagalog).\nBaybayin started to disappear in the 17th century. There was still poetry written in Baybayin until the 18th century. Today, most Philippine languages use the Latin script. "}

It rejects religious authorities like the Vedas and opposes Hinduism. It was an materialistic and atheistic school of philosophy. Along with Buddhism and Jainism, it was one of the three major nastika schools of Indian philosophy.\nTeachings.\nThe school holds direct perception, empiricism, and conditional inference as proper sources of knowledge, embraces philosophical skepticism, and rejects ritualism and supernaturalism. It also rejects supernatural concepts like God, the soul, and metaphysical concepts like the Afterlife (reincarnation) and samsara. It used to be a popular belief system in ancient India, although Charvaka doctrine disappeared by the end of the medieval period. Its onetime importance is confirmed by the lengthy attempts to disprove it found in both Buddhist and Hindu philosophical texts, which also constitute the main sources for knowledge of the doctrine. Charvaka also rejects the caste system.\nLost teachings and texts.\nMuch of the primary literature of Charvaka, and the Barhaspatya sutras, were lost either due to waning popularity or other unknown reasons. However, there is text that may belong to the Charvaka tradition, written by the skeptic philosopher Jayar\u0101\u015bi Bha\u1e6d\u1e6da, known as the Tattv\u00f4paplava-si\u1e41ha, that provides information about this school, albeit unorthodox. Charvaka rejects caste system.\nDuring the Sramana movement in the first millennium BCE, when Buddhism was established by Gautama Buddha and Jainism was re-organized by Parshvanatha, the Charvaka philosophy was well documented and opposed by Hinduism and the other two \"nastika\" schools.\nDifferences between other non-Vedic schools.\nUnlike other major Nastika religions or philosophies like Jainism and Buddhism, which are dharmic philosophies, Charvaka is not a dharmic philosophy because it rejects basic concepts of dharma like karma and moksha. Charvaka is an Adharmic philosophy, so other religions viewed the Charvachic teachings negatively. Hinduism opposed the teachings of Charvaka because Charvaka rejects the authority of the Vedic texts or any sacred scriptures and opposed brahmanism.\nSometimes it is considered as a part of Hinduism (Hindu philosophy) as the word Hindu is an exonym and was a geographical identity in ancient times but most scholars reject it as a part of Hinduism since it's also called \"sanatana dharma\" and Charvaka rejects basic concepts of \"sanatana dharma\" like rta, the authority of sacred text like the Vedas (which is considered as an authority in Hindu philosophies). It also rejects the existence of an Atman or a Brahman (om)."}

A CNN headline on 25 March 2020 stated: \"A group of young adults held a coronavirus party in Kentucky to defy orders to socially distance. Now one of them has coronavirus. On the exact same day, National Public Radio published the headline \"Kentucky has 39 new cases, 1 person attended the coronavirus party.\" Both headlines, however, misrepresented the contents from the article and the quotes by Beshear. The Kentucky governor didn't say anything on intentional parties. He did say, though, that young people were attending parties and becoming sick under COVID-19.\nThe response.\nSome news groups called COVID-19 parties a myth. The \"Rolling Stone\" called \"shaming people on the internet for not properly socially distancing\" the new favorite American pastime. They said the reality was young people simply attended parties at which they caught COVID-19. They didn't deliberately attend them to catch COVID-19."}

These dogs were initially made for protection but some people now use them as house pets. Some American bullies are either small, standard, large or extra large. The breed was recognised in 2013 in the UK if a person wants one they need to have ABKS paper or this would be against the law because these dogs are EBKC (European Bully Kennel Club) which means it comes from Europe.\nOrigin.\nThe American Bully breed was established in the mid-1990s with the purpose of creating the ultimate family companion. The American Bully was created through years of selective breeding by combining the desired traits of the UKC American Pit Bull Terrier and the AKC American Staffordshire Terrier. Some lines have added other bully breeds into the mix and sometimes non bully breeds. The American Bully's origins can be seen both on the East and West Coast of the United States, primarily in Virginia and Los Angeles, California and is spreading to all parts of the U.S. Today the American Bully can also be seen in Europe and Asia. The American Bully, also called the Bully Pit, Bullypit and the Bully Pitbull, is often confused with the American Pitbull Terrier but is clearly a different breed.\nHealth.\nThe American Bulldog has a life expectancy of 10 to 16 years. Some have medical conditions such as cataracts, or hypothyroidism. If they suffer from obesity early in life, they may develop hip or elbow problems.\nMerle American Bullies.\nMerle Bullies can produce any colour and have a complicated gene. Two American Bullies should never be bred together because the puppies may be born disabled or with disabilities because of the colour and the genes. Merle bullies don't need ebkc registered papers because they are from every country and also could be found in American or the whole off USA."}

The United States first imposed an embargo on the sale of arms to Cuba on March 14, 1958, during the Fulgencio Batista regime. Again on October 19, 1960 (almost two years after the Cuban Revolution had led to the deposition of the Batista regime) the U.S. placed an embargo on exports to Cuba except for food and medicine. This was because Cuba nationalized American-owned Cuban oil refineries without compensation. On February 7, 1962 the embargo was extended to include almost all exports. Since the year 2000, the embargo no longer prohibits the trade of food and humanitarian supplies.\nPurpose.\nThe stated purpose of the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 is to keep sanctions on Cuba as long as the Cuban government refuses to move toward \"democratization and greater respect for human rights\"."}

Some bath salts have things to make the water smell good. Some bath salts have medicines in them. Epsom salt, or magnesium sulfate, is made of magnesium, oxygen and sulfur. It is named after the town in England where people first learned to use it. Sometimes people call things that are not Epsom salt \"bath salts\" too, if they are meant to be thrown into a bath to make the water feel or smell good.\nHistory.\nPeople have put herbs and perfumes in their bathwater for a very long time. Epsom salts were discovered in Epsom in England, a spa town, in the 1600s. Doctor and botanist Nehemiah Grew studied the salts in the water and tried to patent the salt. He got into a fight with apothecaries about it.\nHealth.\nThere is anecdotal evidence that bath salts improve human health. This means that many people take salt baths and then say they feel better, but not in a scientific way.\nWhen bath salts mix with the water, they dissolve in the water. Then they give off ions of magnesium and sulfur. The idea is that the person will absorb magnesium through his or her skin. Having enough magnesium in the body can help with sleep problems, digestion problems, and other problems. Some people say it can help with sore muscles after exercise and other types of pain.\nScientists have not found proof that human bodies can really take in magnesium through the skin. When doctors treat people with low magnesium, they give them magnesium to eat or drink through their mouths."}

New versions of the vaccines are developed twice a year, as the influenza virus rapidly changes. While their effectiveness varies from year to year, most provide modest to high protection against influenza. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that vaccination against influenza reduces sickness, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths. Immunized workers who do catch the flu return to work half a day sooner on average. Vaccine effectiveness in those over 65 years old remains uncertain due to a lack of high-quality research. Vaccinating children may protect those around them.\nVaccination against influenza began in the 1930s, with large-scale availability in the United States beginning in 1945. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.\nThe vaccines are generally safe; fever occurs in five to ten percent of children vaccinated, and temporary muscle pains or feelings of tiredness may occur. In certain years, the vaccine was linked to an increase in Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome among older people at a rate of about one case per million doses. Although most influenza vaccines are produced using egg proteins, they are still recommended as safe for people who have severe egg allergies, as no increased risk of allergic reaction to the egg-based vaccines has been shown for people with egg allergies. Vaccines produced using other technologies, notably recombinant vaccines and those based on cell culture rather than egg protein, started to become available from 2012 in the US, and later in Europe and Australia. Influenza vaccines are not recommended in those who have had a severe allergy to previous versions of the vaccine itself. The vaccine comes in \"inactive\" and \"weakened\" viral forms. The live, weakened vaccine is generally not recommended in pregnant women, children less than two years old, adults older than 50, or people with a weakened immune system. Depending on the type they can be injected into a muscle, sprayed into the nose, or injected into the middle layer of the skin (intradermal). The intradermal vaccine was not available during the 2018\u20132019 and 2019\u20132020 influenza seasons."}

Females do sometimes die from COVID-19. Males, though, have higher chances of dying from the condition. That is because men and boys are more likely to have severe cases of COVID-19 when infected. Slightly more males than females end up getting COVID-19.\nThe gender differences in mortality.\nThe highest risk of COVID-19 for males is during their 50s though the condition can affect anybody at any age. The gap between males and females closes near age 90. The death rate for China was about 2.8% for males and 1.7% for females. However, for several countries including Slovenia, Vietnam, Nepal and India, females are more likely to die than males.\nThe reasons for this difference are not known. However, genetic, social and behavioral factors may play a part. The fact that women are smoking far less often than men and males often developing multiple health conditions at one time, like hypertension and diabetes at younger ages than females, may have contributed to the higher death rates for males. Since both professional and home care related affairs are more common for women, however, the may have a greater infection rate than men in some places. In Spain, for example, healthcare workers were affected more with COVID-19 than almost anybody else. The fact that females are more likely to live longer than males indicates a larger group of women and girls are under risk for getting the condition. Females from certain racial groups, who are older or have obesity to a certain level are more likely to have severe illness when the condition infects them.\nThe impact on health.\nAcross the world, females make up just over 70% of the workers in the health or social sector. Almost 90% of the healthcare workers in and around the Hubei province of China (from which the disease first got started) were female. In the United States, about 78% of the healthcare workers were female. Women play strong roles for responding to the disease. This includes women who are front line healthcare workers, caregivers at home, community leaders and mobilizers. Making matters worse, females are always paid much less than the males in almost all countries. Females also hold fewer leadership positions in health sectors. Masks and other protective equipment designed for males leave females under greater risk for exposure to COVID-19.\nWomen and girls, having already faced health and safety problems in managing their sexual and reproductive health and their menstrual hygiene without access to proper and clean water or private toilets before the crisis started are especially in danger. When the medical and healthcare systems are given more work than they can handle and the resources are redistributed to respond to the pandemic, this interferes with health services that are important to the well-being for women and girls. This includes the pre-natal/post-natal healthcare, access to quality sexual and reproductive health services, life-saving care and support for those who survived gender-based violence. Women are also not visiting hospitals or healthcare facilities for fears of being exposed to COVID-19 and for movement restrictions.\nGender-based violence.\nDue to increased tension in households during a pandemic, women and girls are under higher risk for being the victims of intimate partner and domestic violence. During periods of lockdown, women who experience domestic violence have very limited access to protective services."}

The movie shows us the story of the world-famous composer from different perspectives. The title reflects the name that was used in his youth.\nPlot.\nThe film moves back and forth between Beethoven\u2019s final year and his early life in Bonn. The Beethoven we meet as an adult (played by Tobias Moretti) has long been deaf. He has come to his brother Johann\u2019s home in Gneixendorf along with their nephew Karl (Peter Lewys Preston) after Karl\u2019s attempted suicide. There Louis is in constant battle with everyone around him. This is the background that leads to memories of his earlier life.\nAs a child in Bonn, Louis (Colin P\u00fctz) was a musical prodigy. He is pushed by his father, who has dreams of him being a new Mozart. Through his father\u2019s connections as a singer in the court of the Elector, the young Beethoven comes under the supervision of other musicians. He also comes in contact with Tobias Pfeiffer (Sabin Tambrea), a local actor who rooms with the family. \nAs he becomes a young man, Louis (Anselm Bresgott) continues to grow as a musician. He also suffers the loss of his mother, which sends his father into grief and alcoholism. He comes under the patronage of the von Breuning family and falls in love with Eleonore von Breuning (Caroline Hellwig). But he is below the family\u2019s social station and any match between them is forbidden. To recreate the atmosphere of Beethoven\u2019s era, it was decided to use a few replicas of period instruments made by a modern piano maker Paul McNulty."}

His kidnapping was a mystery for almost twenty-seven years.\nOn Thursday, September 1, 2016, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) discovered human bones from a pasture near Paynesville, almost 30 miles from the site of the kidnapping. On September 3, the Wetterling family made an announcement saying that the bones were those of Jacob. Local law enforcement officials stated that the identity of the bones was confirmed by dental records. The location was given out by Danny Heinrich, a long-time person of interest for the kidnapping of another boy, twelve-year-old Jared Scheierl, in the town of Cold Spring which was near the area. Three days later on September 6, Heinrich admitted to kidnapping and murdering Jacob Wetterling and to kidnapping and sexually assaulting Scheierl.\nThe kidnapping.\nOn the evening of Sunday, October 22, 1989, not long after 9pm CDT, Jacob Wetterling (11), his brother Trevor (10) and a friend, Aaron Larson (11) were biking home from what was then a Tom Thumb convenience store in St. Joseph. The boys had gone to the store for renting a video. But then, Danny Heinrich came from a driveway. He was wearing a stocking cap mask and had an unloaded revolver. Heinrich ordered the three boys to throw the bikes into a nearby ditch and lie face down. He then started asking each boy his age. Jacob's brother Trevor was told to run to a nearby wooded area and not look back or else he would be shot. Heinrich then asked to see the faces of the two remaining boys. He picked Jacob and told Aaron to run away. He (Heinrich) threatened Aaron in a similar way to how he threatened Trevor. That was the last time Jacob was seen alive.\nThe investigation.\nOn Friday, January 13, 1989, just over nine months before Wetterling was kidnapped, twelve-year-old Jared Scheierl was kidnapped, sexually assaulted and then physically threatened by an unknown adult man. The boy's statement given that night showed the habits of the adult man were similar to that of when Wetterling was kidnapped. The adult man, who was later identified as Danny Heinrich, had threatened the boy with a gun. The man then released the boy and warned him to not look back or he (Jared) would be shot. That kidnapping took place almost ten miles from where he (Heinrich) would later stop the Wetterling brothers and their friend.\nA person of interest.\nIn May 2014, investigators began taking more looks at a series of tried or actual child molestations that had taken place in the Paynesville area within several years before Jacob Wetterling was kidnapped and murdered. Between summer 1986 and spring 1987, five teenage boys were attacked. Nobody was arrested for the attacks, though. Authorities talked with some of the victims again. They also worked with an Internet blogger who brought the information to light. After several months of research and talking to some of the victims, the investigators realized the attacks were not random. They also realized the culprit might be linked to the kidnapping of Wetterling, almost 40 minutes from the other crime scenes.\nIn late October 2015, Danny James Heinrich was publicly named a person of interest in the disappearance of Jacob Wetterling. The Federal Bureau of Investigation had questioned him on December 16, 1989. A DNA sample was taken. Heinrich, though, was not charged with any crime. On July 28, 2015, however, Heinrich's DNA was matched to the DNA sample in the case of Jared Scheierl when he was kidnapped in Cold Spring in January 1989. When local officials performed a search warrant on the home in which Heinrich lived, they found several hundred images that depicted child pornography on the hard drive of his computer and with three-ring binders. Almost three months following that search, Heinrich was arrested on charges involving child pornography.\nThe plea agreement and discovery.\nHeinrich decided to cooperate with the authorities as part of a plea bargain. On September 1, 2016, almost eleven months after his arrest, Heinrich led the investigators to the burial site. Jacob's clothing and human remains had been unearthed from a pasture near Paynesville, almost 30 miles away from Wetterling's home and kidnapping site.\nIn the plea agreement, Heinrich pleaded guilty to one count of the 25 federal child pornography charges against him. \nIn exchange with the Heinrich plea, prosecutors agreed to not charge him with Wetterling's murder. With the plea agreement, Heinrich was given the maximum prison term of twenty years under the child pornography charge. The plea deal will also permit the state authorities to seek his civil commitment as a violent sexual predator after his federal prison term ends. That could prevent Heinrich from ever being released.\nIn 2017, Heinrich was transferred to the Federal Medical Center, Devens. It's a Massachusetts federal prison. He is serving his 20-year sentence there."}

With 1,450 beds and over 6,000 workers (including the medical faculty) in 29 clinics and polyclinics, eight institutes and seven departments, it is the largest hospital in Leipzig, Saxony.\nLocations.\nMost of the facilities at the University Hospital are located on their own premises southeast of the city center in the \"Zentrum-S\u00fcdost\" district - the Medical Quarter or Clinic Quarter on Liebigstrasse. The boundaries are Johannisallee, Sternwartenstrasse, N\u00fcrnberger Strasse and Philipp-Rosenthal-Strasse. The clinics can be reached by local public transport operated by LVB and by S-Bahn from the \"Bayerischer Bahnhof\", \"Ostplatz\" and \"Johannisallee\" stops. Other locations include Semmelweisstrasse and H\u00e4rtelstrasse.\nHistory.\nThe Medical Faculty of the University of Leipzig was founded in 1415, a few years after the university itself was founded in 1409. As at all European universities, medical knowledge was initially disseminated in a purely theoretical manner. The first step towards modern, scientifically based medicine was taken in 1704 with the establishment of the first anatomical theater (Theatrum anatomicum) by Johann Christian Schamberg . In 1799 the \"Institute for Clinical Education\" was founded in the Jakobshospital, where patient examinations, surgical demonstrations and dissection exercises took place for the first time. Johann Christian August Heinroth was appointed to the world's first chair for \"psychological therapy\" ( psychiatry ) in 1811. The current main location of the medical faculty in Liebigstrasse was founded in 1871 by Carl Reinhold August Wunderlich and Carl Thiersch as the \u201cSt. Jakob Municipal Hospital\u201d. In 1889 the landmark of the medical district was opened with the \u201c Red House\u201d. In the period from approx. 1880 to the Second World War, medicine experienced its greatest heyday at the University of Leipzig. With researchers like Paul Flechsig, Carl Ludwig and Wilhelm His, Leipzig was one of the world's leading centres of scientific teaching and research. In 1891 Otto Heubner founded the University Children's Clinic. Large parts of the medical district were destroyed during World War II. The first post-war building was opened in 1956 with the Institute for Anatomy; all other institutes were gradually rebuilt. In 1953 the St. Jakob Hospital was transferred to the university. The department for inpatient psychotherapy and psychosomatic medicine, founded in 1953, was one of the first in Germany. Almost all clinics and institutes have been built or completely renovated since 1990. The hospital, which founded the first clinic for cardiovascular surgery in Europe in 1961, no longer has its own cardiac surgery department, as the private heart center in Leipzig in the Probstheida district has been a university clinic since 1994, according to a contract between the State of Saxony and Rh\u00f6n-Klinikum AG. Up to the opening of the \"Center for Conservative Medicine\" in November 2008, around 350 million euros had been invested in the Liebigstrasse location. By around mid-2009, all departments moved from the old ward block to the new clinic buildings.\nThe hospital building built in 1983 was demolished in 2013, and new buildings will later be built on the area.\nMedical treatment.\nIt is a maximum care hospital. It has 1,350 fully inpatient and 101 part inpatient beds. In 2018, 374,020 outpatients and 56,591 inpatients were treated. The turnover in 2018 was 457 million euros. The hospital has several certified treatment units: the largest stroke unit in Saxony (12 beds), a colon cancer center and one of the first skin cancer centers in Germany. The Jos\u00e9 Carreras Transplant Unit at the Department of Hematology and Internal Oncology is one of the best-known funding beneficiaries of the German Jos\u00e9 Carreras Leukemia Foundation .\nResearch.\nThe main research areas of the University Hospital are neurosciences, endocrinology, immunology, molecular oncology and psychosocial medicine. There are collaborations with a number of local research institutes such as the Max Planck Institute for Cognitive and Neurosciences, the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, the Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy and Immunology, the Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research - UFZ and Bio City Leipzig.\nBlood bank.\nIn 1962 the district institute for blood donation and transfusion was founded, which in 1991 merged with the university blood donation service to form today's institute for transfusion medicine. The blood bank brand was introduced in 2002 to differentiate the institute from other blood donation services. With currently 92 employees, it has two branches in Gr\u00fcnau and Paunsdorf in addition to the institute's location in the clinic district (center) and an acceptance point in the north (Gohlis Park). There are also around 160 external appointments in the region every year. As the largest university facility for transfusion medicine in Germany, the blood bank collects 55,000 whole blood donations, 12,000 plasma donations and 5,400 platelet donations every year. \nOrgan donation scandal.\nAt the beginning of January 2013 it became known that there had been irregularities in the allocation of donor organs in 2010 and 2011 at the hospital. The investigative commission of the German Medical Association and the internal auditing department of the hospital found that the health status of at least 37 of 54 patients had been deliberately shown worse in the context of liver transplants, so that they could be assigned a replacement organ more quickly. In the course of the investigation, the chief physician of transplant surgery and two senior physicians were given leave of absence for the time being. In July 2015, after the investigation was completed, the Leipzig public prosecutor brought charges against the two senior physicians, as they allegedly manipulated patient files in 2010 and 2011. The preliminary investigation against the clinic's chief physician was discontinued without any conditions; no involvement was proven. "}

The United States paid Mexico 10,000,000 dollars, which is worth 230,000,000 dollars in 2019 money. This trade was officially called the Treaty of Mesilla.\nBackground.\nThe Mexican-American War had ended in 1848. The United States won the war. Both countries agreed to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which gave the United States a very big part of Mexico: the Mexican Cession, an area of more than . In return, the United States paid Mexico 15,000,000 dollars.\nAfter 1848, Mexico and the United States did not agree where the border was. Both countries claimed the Mesilla Valley as part of their own country. Businessmen from the southern states wanted to build a new transcontinental railroad that would cross the southern part of the country. They wanted the railroad to go through the Mesilla Valley. Jefferson Davis, who at that time was the US Secretary of War, supported that idea. James Gadsden was sent to buy the land from Mexico. He wanted to buy much more land, including Tamaulipas, Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and parts of Chihuahua and Sonora, but the Mexican president, Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, did not want to sell it to him.\nEstablishment of purchase.\nA treaty was signed on December 30, 1853. This treaty would have given to the United States and 15,000,000 dollars to Mexico. Many US Senators did not agree with this: they wanted to buy less land. On April 25, 1854, the US Senate accepted the new, smaller purchase. President Franklin Pierce signed the treaty, and then sent it to President Santa Anna, who signed it on June 8, 1854. Many Mexicans were angry with Santa Anna after he signed the treaty."}

The term is derived from Ancient Greek: (, \"self\") and (, \"watcher\").\nAutoscopy has intersted people for almost as long as there are records: There are many stories in folklore and which involve autoscopy. This applies both to ancient and modern societies. Psychiatrists commonly come in contact with cases of autoscopy. According to neurological research, autoscopic experiences . \nFactors.\nUsually, the following is true:\nTheis made of the Greek words (\"self\") and (\"looking at\"). The autoscopic phenomenon is classified in the following six typologies: autoscopic hallucination, he-autoscopy or heautoscopic proper, feeling of a presence, out of body experience, negative and inner forms of autoscopy.\nThe Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, and the Department of Neurology, University Hospital, Geneva, Switzerland, have reviewed some of the classical factors of autoscopy. These are sleep, drug abuse, and general anesthesia as well as neurobiology. They have compared them with recent findings on neurological and neurocognitive mechanisms of autoscopy; the reviewed data suggest that autoscopic experiences are due problems with processing information at the temporoparietal junction.\nRelated disorders.\nHeautoscopy is a term used in psychiatry and neurology for the hallucination of \"seeing one's own body at a distance\". It can occur as a symptom in schizophrenia and epilepsy. Heautoscopy is considered a possible explanation for doppelg\u00e4nger phenomena.\nThe term polyopic heautoscopy refers to cases where more than one double is perceived. In 2006, Peter Brugger and his colleagues described the case of a man who experienced five doubles resulting from a tumor in his left temporal lobe.\nAnother related autoscopy disorder is known as negative autoscopy (or negative heautoscopy). This is a psychological phenomenonwere the sufferer does not see their reflection when looking in a mirror. Although the sufferer's image may be seen by others, they claim not to see it."}

The Matilda effect is when a woman scientist does something but people think a man scientist did it. Sometimes people do this on purpose, for example when a professor steals a female student's research and puts his own name on the paper. Sometimes people do this without thinking about it.\nHistory.\nSuffragist and abolitionist Matilda Joslyn Gage (1826\u201398) was the first person to write about this effect. She wrote an essay, \"Woman as Inventor.\" It was first published as a tract in 1870 and in the \"North American Review\" in 1883. The term \"Matilda effect\" was started in 1993 by science historian Margaret W. Rossiter.\nRossiter wrote about several times the Matilda effect had happened in real life. Trotula (Trota of Salerno), a 12th-century Italian woman physician, wrote books which, after her death, were rewritten with male authors' names on them. Nineteenth- and twentieth-century cases of the Matilda effect include those of Nettie Stevens, Lise Meitner, Marietta Blau, Rosalind Franklin, and Jocelyn Bell Burnell.\nComparison.\nThe Matilda effect was compared to the Matthew effect. The Matthew effect is when a famous scientist gets more credit than a less famous scientist even if they both did the same work.\nResearch.\nIn 2012, two woman researchers from Radboud University Nijmegen did a study. They looked at men and women who were being picked to be professors at universities. They found the people choosing who would become a professor were affected by whether the person they were looking at was a man or a woman. Another study in Italy Italian and another in Spain showed the same thing.\nHowever, some other studies found no difference between the number of times men and woman researchers' papers had been named as sources in other papers.\nSwiss researchers found that when people in mass media, for example newscasters, want to put a scientist on their show, they talk to male scientists more than to female scientists.\nAccording to one U.S. study, \"although overt gender discrimination generally continues to decline in American society,\" \"women continue to be disadvantaged with respect to the receipt of scientific awards and prizes, particularly for research.\"\nExamples.\nExamples of women to whom to the Matilda effect happened:\nTimes men scientists had Nobel Prizes when women scientists did not:\nOther.\nBen Barres (1954\u20132017), a neurobiologist at Stanford University Medical School. Barres is a trans man, meaning Barres was raised with a female gender role. He began to live as a man when he was 42 years old. Barres said people thought his research was better when they thought he was a man than when they thought he was a woman. Someone even said \"His work is much better that his sister's\" because they thought \"Barbara Barres\" was his sister and not his own old name. This is one time when the Matilta effect worked on the same person at different times in that person's life."}

Industry refers to the manufacture of raw materials by machine, which are used in the daily life of human beings. There are three types of benefits of factories. On the one hand, they meet human needs. The second is the addition of human comfort. And third, things can be made easily and quickly. Different industries work together. Which makes things less expensive to make. At present, the production of industrial goods is increasing exponentially.\nNational development.\nDuring the partition, Pakistan got those areas. Which were more industrially backward. Hindus were big industrialists and capitalists. Where factories were not established in Muslim-majority areas. When all the raw materials were available there at cheap rates. Yet these areas were kept away from industry.\nIn East Bengal, the production of Puttsun was 50% of the total world production. However, not a single Puttsun factory was set up there. On the other hand, in West Bengal, more than a hundred Puttsun factories were operating on the Hugli River Cup.\nCotton was grown in West Punjab. However, textile mills were established in Mumbai and Ahmedabad, at the time of independence Pakistan there were cotton, sugar and a total of seven cement factories. Therefore, Pakistan started its industrial development on a weaker basis.\nThe Pakistani government realized that the country was lagging behind industrially. Therefore, special efforts were made to establish a strong industrial system. An industrial policy was announced in 1948, which encouraged the private sector. In 1972, the government nationalized ten types of factories. At the time, the government's actions created uncertainty in the private sector. Capitalists are now reluctant to invest in industry. The subsequent government made state-controlled factories private in the same way. In addition, the private sector paved the way for setting up new factories and investing in them. As investors invest in Pakistan's industrial sectors.\nIndustries.\nIndustries in Pakistan are divided into the following categories\nSmall home industries.\nSmall and cottage industries are very important. Because they provide employment at the local level. They cost less to set up. And the administrative structure is also small. When the focus is on small and cottage industries, human migration from the countryside to the city will be reduced. There are so many types it's hard to say. Small and cottage industries have a significant role to play in Pakistan. Thousands of people work in them. Which strengthens the country's economy.\nThere are small and cottage industries in Pakistan\n(1) blanket making factory:\nIn Sindhi the blanket is called carpet. The cities of Sindh include Jakmabad, Sukkur, Khairpur, Mirpur Khas, Umerkot, Tharparkar, Hyderabad and Based in Karachi.\nBlankets are widely made in the capital city of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar. It's a big business locally.\nSimilarly, there are blanket making industries in Quetta, the main city of Balochistan. Very beautiful and beautiful blankets are made in Pakistan. Which is very popular in Brown country. Money is made through this top industry. Blankets are made from this synthetic thread.\n(2) Cotton imprint:\n(3) Leather making factory:\nLeather Goods Karachi, Hyderabad (Sindh), Lahore, Sialkot, Gujranwala, Sheikhupura and Multan (Punjab)\nMade in Peshawar and Swat (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa).\nThere are also tanneries in Balochistan. This industry involves a large number of workers.\n(4) Sports equipment:\nPakistan-made hockey, cricket benches and ball, football and racquets are very popular in foreign countries.\n(5) Cutlery or cutting tools:\n(6) Sewing and sewing work:\nSewing has been a common practice in Sindh since ancient times.\nEuropean and Gulf countries used to come through Sindh to trade in sewn goods.\nThis work Sindh, Balochistan, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,\nOccurs in different cities of Gilgit-Baltistan and Kashmir.\nIn Sindh and Balochistan, hats are made by weaving small pieces of moss on cloth with silk thread, and hats are widely used. This art is called Sindhi and Balochi art. The main centers of this art are Larkana, Dadu, Shikarpur, Nawabshah and Khuzdar. This is a special skill of the families of Balochistan and Sindh.\n\"Salmi Sattar\" works in major cities of Sindh and Punjab. Flower stitches, leather stitches are gold\nThe cities of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa include Peshawar, Dera Ismail Khan, Kohat and Nowshera.\nLarge industries.\nIn large industries, the lower factories are counted.\n(1) Textile Mills:\nThe textile industry is the backbone of Pakistan's economy. These factories produce the best quality fabrics. Pakistan is self-sufficient in cotton cloth. Millions of rupees are earned every year by selling these clothes abroad. Special centers for textile industry are Faisalabad, Lahore and Multan (Punjab), Karachi and Hyderabad (Sindh). Occurs in Peshawar, Dera Ismail Khan, Nowshera, Bannu, Haripur and Swat (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) and Athal and Quetta (Balochistan).\nThere are more than 500 industrial factories in Pakistan. In which only 3 factories were invented at the time of independence in 1947.\nThere are also woolen factories in Pakistan. But cotton is no match for textile mills. The main reason is that low quality in Pakistan is obtained from it. It is used to make more wool or blankets. Major woolen factories are located in Karachi (Sindh), Lawrencepur (Rawalpindi), Lahore, Quaidabad (Punjab), Harnai (Balochistan) and Bannu (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa). Where blankets and woolen cloth are made from wool particles. There are currently 70 woolen factories in Pakistan. Lawrencepur and Karachi factories produce high quality woolen cloth.\nThere are also silk industries in Pakistan. There are two types of silk used in the manufacture of silk fabrics. A natural silk. It is obtained from silkworms. And the second is Hathrado silk, which is called synthetic or synthetic silk. As natural silk is very expensive and non-existent. That's why people love synthetic or artificial silk fabrics. A synthetic silk factory operates in Karib Kala Shah Kaku, Lahore. Synthetic silk is called Rayon. Silk thread and raw silk are imported from brown countries. Karachi is a major hub for the silk industry. Besides, silk factories have been set up in Faisalabad, Lahore, Multan, Gujranwala, Peshawar, Swat, Sukkur, Hyderabad and Ghotki.\n(2) Chinese factory:\nThe sugar industry is of great importance in Pakistan. In 1947, two sugar factories were set up, one at Karib Rahwali in Gujranwala and the other at Takht Bai in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Sugar is made from sugarcane. Which is produced on a large scale in Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. According to statistics, there are 78 sugar factories in the country. (40 in Punjab, 32 in Sindh, 6 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) The production capacity of all these factories is 5 million tons. Pakistan is not only self-sufficient in sugar but also sells it to foreign countries. From them\nEarning income. The sugar made in Pakistan is of high quality.\n(3) Cement factory:\nGypsum is used in the manufacture of cement. Fortunately, Pakistan has large deposits of Chen stone and gypsum. That is why so many cement factories have been set up in the public or private sector. They are operating under the administrative regulations of Pakistan State Cement Corporation (PSCC).\nCement factories are operating in the lower areas of Pakistan.\nCement production in Pakistan is almost self-sufficient. In 1947, there was only one cement factory. There are currently 25 cement factories operating in the country. Of which 21 factories are operating in the private sector and 4 factories are operating in the public sector. The capacity of these factories is 17.7 million tons.\n(4) chemical fertilizer factory:\nThe country's need for chemical fertilizers is met through fertilizers made in factories here.\nChemical fertilizers are essential for optimal production. These factories produce different types of fertilizer. Chemical fertilizer is more than required in Pakistan. Therefore, the remaining fertilizer is sent to foreign countries. Chemical fertilizer factories in Sindh Dharki and Mirpur Mathelo, and Punjab in Sheikhupura, Sadiqabad, Rahim Yar Khan , Multan, Faisalabad and Gujranwala. Fertilizer factories are located in the city of Haripur in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Their production capacity is 5.6 million tons.\nDefense industries.\nThe defense industries include iron and steel mills, heavy mechanical complexes and shipbuilding plants.\nBelow is the necessary information for them.\n(1) Iron and steel factory:\nThe factories of Iron and Steel depend on iron ore. Cast iron is obtained from Kala Bagh, Makarwal (Punjab), Langarial (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), Khuzdar, Ziarat, Chal Ghazi and Nok Kundi (Balochistan). The iron ore found there is less than the country's needs. That is why he is taken abroad. Large iron and steel mills are located in Karachi and Taxila. Which are briefly mentioned below.\n(A) Pakistan Steel Mill Karachi:\nThe mills have been set up near Bin Qasim Port, 40 km from Karachi. Work on the mill began in 1973 with the help of Russia, and produces pig iron, iron sheets, coal wire, and more. Thousands of people work in this mill. How much of the country was saved from the formation of this mill.\n(B) Heavy Mechanical Complex, Taxila:\nThe Heavy Mechanical Complex was established in 1968 in Taxila, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province in collaboration with China. Machinery, trucks, and spare parts for the railway engine, sugar, cement, textile and fertilizer factories are manufactured here. Imports of steel and machinery have fallen sharply since the Taxila complex began operations. In addition, a variety of machinery and additional tools do not have to be imported and the treasury is saved.\n(2) Karachi Shipyard and Engineering Works:\nKarachi Shipyard and Engineering Works was established in 1956.

{"id": "855179", "revid": "1061539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=855179", "title": "Cell (Dragon Ball character)", "text": " is a fictional character and a major villain in the \"Dragon Ball Z\" manga and anime created by Akira Toriyama. He makes his debut in chapter #361 , first published in \"Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump\" on 16 February 1992. Cell is an evil artificial life form created using cell samples from several major characters in the series. He travels back in time so he can become the perfect being. In order to reach this goal, he must absorb Androids 17 and 18.\nPhysical Appearance.\nImperfect Form.\nIn his \"Imperfect\" form, Cell walks fully upright on two legs (unlike his \"larval\" form). His facial features have not yet fully complete and he still retains an orifice-like mouth rather than normal human-like features seen in later forms. The two sections of his head go off in a V-shape. Cell has orange color parts near his abdominal area, the back of his head, and even near the area where gentials would be found. He has two wings which are both green with black spots.He has three fingers in the manga, but five fingers and three toes (just as similar as Frieza and King Cold) in the anime. He has a tail like Frieza and King Cold, but also has a stinger on the end of it. He has black sections as well near his abdominal area, in the middle between the two sections on his head, and even the black part of the opposite side of his tail. He even has visible veins in both of his arms, legs, and even some in the joints in his upper body. His eyes are pink (blue in the manga colored pages) with thin reptilian slits.\nSemi Perfect Form.\nIn his \"Semi-Perfect\" form, Cell's wings disappear, and he becomes much more humanoid, he also becomes quite a bit more muscular. While the nose is not yet fully formed, he now has an actual mouth. The two sections of his head now go straight into the air. In this form, he is taller. His tail is longer and slightly thicker than before, and comes from his back, as well as becoming orange and black. His voice is deeper than his first form. The back of his head and the black section on his forehead are now formed together as a ball in between the two sections on his head. His lips are now the color pink, and the black sections above his lips look like a mustache (but it's part of his skin). He now has light blue eyes in this form (a result of absorbing Android 17). He even has boot-like feet in this form and metal-like plates all around both of his ankles. He has the same shape of ears as Frieza's, except that his have an orange line that goes down to the chin and to both sides of the ears. His wings retreat completely into his back. In his self-destruction form, Semi-Perfect Cell bloats himself, his belly greatly expanding in size. He also claimed that his bloated appearance was unstable, and that a single touch may set him off when dissuading Gohan from trying to stop him.\nPerfect Form.\nIn his \"Perfect\" form, Cell becomes much more humanoid and more intelligent, complete with both a fully-formed nose and mouth. His tail is retracted and now used to create Cell Jr's. He is also smaller than in his previous form. His wings have grown back and now are shaded black. His body is colored light-green with black spots and has black plates located on his shoulders and chest, and the plates on his ankles as well as the previously orange section near his groin are now shaded black. His skin is now pale all in his face, neck and hands, he now has purple lines in both sides of his cheeks, similar to Frieza in his first three forms, and the orange line across his ears and chin is now changed into a yellow color. His eyes are now pink, and his blue veins are now purple. In this form,he is seen doing lots of special attacks done by most of the Z fighters.\nSuper Cell.\nIn his \"Super Cell \" form,he is more powerful than ever. His body doesn't change only his power and speed,in this forn he kills Future Trunks but Super saiyan 2 Gohan, with the help from his father, kills him with a final Son and father Kamehameha.\nAppearances.\nCell is an artificial life form (referred to as a \"Bio-Android\") created by Doctor Gero's supercomputer from the cell sample of the universe's strongest warriors, possessing the genetic information of Goku, Vegeta, Piccolo, Frieza, King Cold and Tien Shinhan in an underground complex beneath Gero's secret laboratory. Cell is designed to evolve into the \"perfect\" being by absorbing two Androids, #17 and #18. The Cell that appears as the primary antagonist of his titular arc is from the future, awakening after his development is complete to find that the Androids have been destroyed by Trunks. After he kills Trunks, Cell uses his time machine while regressing into an egg to travel back four years, to before the androids appeared, arriving in the present timeline. After hatching and metamorphosing from his larval, cicada-like form into his insect-like Imperfect form, Cell kills off thousands of people and absorbs them to increase his power in preparation to absorb the Androids. After he has managed to absorb the energy of entire cities of people, Cell finds Android #17 during his fight with Piccolo. Cell then breaks Piccolo's neck before Android #16 holds the mechanized villain off. However, he is able to find an opening to absorb #17 and evolves into Semi-Perfect Cell. Cell quickly dispatches #16, but he is unable to absorb #18 thanks to the intervention of Tenshinhan, who holds him back at the cost of his own life force before being rescued by Goku, along with a surviving Piccolo.\nCell tries to find Android #18, destroying islands to intimidate her into showing herself, but before he can destroy the island that #18 is hiding on, Vegeta appears and overwhelms him with newfound power. At the brink of defeat, Cell talks Vegeta into letting him absorb #18 so he can give him a better fight, and upon doing so, he assumes his final form, which is much more human like. In this form, Cell easily defeats Krillin, Vegeta, and Trunks, but spares all of them so that they can come to his own fighting tournament, the Cell Games (\u30bb\u30eb\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0, Seru G\u0113mu) to find a worthy opponent to face him, intending to destroy Earth when he wins and wanting to enjoy the fear he causes in others.\nA week later, in the first round of the Cell Games, he quickly defeats Mr. Satan before moving onto Goku, who quits upon realizing Cell is stronger than him.[14] Goku then nominates his son, Gohan, as Cell's next opponent, to everyone's surprise. Though Gohan puts up a good fight and proves himself his father's superior, Cell easily takes the upper hand due to his pacifistic nature. Wanting to avoid killing Cell if he can help it, Gohan warns Cell that if he is pushed too far, he will lose control of his anger and kill him, which only drives Cell to torment him further, excited to see this power. He spawns Cell Juniors (\u30bb\u30eb\u30b8\u30e5\u30cb\u30a2, Seru Junia), miniature versions of himself who begin to fight the heroes, causing Gohan's rage to slowly swell. It is only when Cell mercilessly kills #16 after he had encouraged Gohan to fight that Gohan snaps, transforming into a Super Saiyan 2. Gohan effortlessly, violently kills all the Cell Juniors, and then proceeds to effortlessly overpower Cell, aiming to prolong his suffering, dealing so much damage that Cell regurgitates Android #18 and reverts to his previous form. In desperation, Cell tries to self-destruct and destroy the Earth, but Goku sacrifices himself to ensure that Cell detonates elsewhere.\nHowever, Cell is able to survive thanks to his unique physiology, which allows him to regenerate from a special nucleus in his head and grow more powerful whenever he has almost been killed, returning to his Perfect form even stronger than before. He easily kills Trunks, and when Vegeta attacks him in retaliation, he easily swats him aside. Before he can kill him, Gohan takes the blast in his place, which breaks his arm. With victory in his grasp, Cell decides to destroy the planet with one last Kamehameha, claiming he has the power to destroy the entire Solar System. Assisted by his father in spirit, Gohan retaliates with his own Kamehameha, ultimately overpowering Cell with Vegeta's help, destroying his cell nucleus and killing him once and for all. Mr. Satan, however, takes credit for the victory and becomes a hero.\nUpon being resurrected by the Dragon Balls and returning to the future, Trunks destroys Androids #17 and #18, though realizes from his time travel that Cell is likely to emerge soon. Three years later, Trunks is confronted by the Cell of his timeline, who plans to kill Trunks and use his time machine in the same way his alternate self had. Future Cell realized Trunks traveled back already and learned of him in the past but thinks Trunks is no match for him. However, Trunks showcases his newfound power and easily kills him, finally bringing peace to the future.\nIn filler episodes of the anime, Cell makes numerous cameo appearances, usually as comic relief. Cell tries absorbing two siblings, but is prevented from doing so by Krillin, giving chase to the three and nearly killing Krillin before he notices Piccolo and Tien Shinhan on the way and escapes. In his posthumous appearances, he is shown causing trouble in Hell along with Frieza, King Cold, and the Ginyu Force. He is defeated by Goku and Pikkon and sent to prison, and is later seen watching Goku's battle with Majin Buu on a crystal ball, openly wondering why Goku quit against him and then went on to fight Buu, whom he acknowledges to be a stronger opponent than himself.\nAbilities.\nHe possesses most of the Z fighter's abilities, including the Kamehameha and Final Flash technique.\nCell is among the most powerful antagonists of the original manga. Possessing the genetic material of the some of the world's strongest fighters, he is a master martial artist with superhuman strength, endurance, and speed. He can fly, create energy beams and forcefields using his ki, a form of energy derived from his own life force, and with his stinging tail, he can absorb others, either stabbing them with the tail to dissolve them[54] or engulfing them within it to consume them. It is by absorbing others that he increases his own power."}

Mohajirs were the vanguard of the Pakistan Movement, which advocated the partition of British India in order to create the independent nation of Pakistan for Indian Muslims. After the partition, a large number of Muslims migrated from various urban centers of India to live in the new nation of Pakistan. These migrants later identified themselves as mohajirs. A large number of Mohajirs settled in the cities of Sind Province, particularly Kar\u0101chi and Hyder\u0101b\u0101d.

After that war, Syed put forward his proposal of an independent Sindh, which he called Sindhudesh. Even though the movement exists, it wasn't able to gather a huge following. This is partly due to how the state of Pakistan is organised. There were protests however: These focused on the use of Urdu, instead of the Sindhi language.

They made decorations (including paintings and sculptures), in Cuban churches and public buildings. By the mid-1700s, native-born artists were painting in Cuba, in the European tradition of painting.\nMany works of art were left behind by Jos\u00e9 Nicol\u00e1s de la Escalera (d. 1804). For many of those works, there is proof that he was the one who painted those.\nVicente Escobar (d. 1834) was a \"mestizo\", and he did portraits that made his paintings popular with Cuba's elite (or people with wealth or political power). He opened [the first, or] one of the first painting workshop/studios in Cuba. He later graduated from the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid.\nV\u00edctor Patricio de Landaluze (d. 1889) was a Spanish-born artist, and he was an early artist of the \"costumbrismo\" genre. He was opposed to Cuban independence, and that cost him some of his popularity with the public.\nAfter the Colonial Era.\nBy the late 1920s [an Avant-garde movement,] the Vanguardia, had rejected convention [or some norms] of Cuba's national art academy. Most of the Vanguardia artists had been students at the national art academy. Many had lived in Paris (France), where they learned (more) about Surrealism, Cubism, and modernist Primitivism. Those genres (or styles) gave inspiration to the Vanguardia artists.\nPioneers (or the first to be part) of the movement included Eduardo Abela, Antonio Gattorno, Victor Manuel, Fidelio Ponce de Le\u00f3n, and Carlos Enr\u00edquez G\u00f3mez. Other famous artists of the original Vanguardia were Amelia Pel\u00e1ez, Jorge Arche, Marcelo Pogolotti, Aristides Fernandez, Rafael Blanco, Domingo Ravenet, Alberto Pe\u00f1a, and Lorenzo Romero Arciaga.\nThe painting [\"the tropical gypsy\",] \"La Gitana Tropical\" (1929), has been called one of the defining pieces (or paintings) of Cuban Avant-garde art. Victor Manuel painted it. During stays in Paris, he had been impressed by the works of Paul C\u00e9zanne and Paul Gauguin. (The painting is in a museum in Havana, Cuba.)\nBetween 1934 and 1940, Cuba was searching for its cultural identity in its European and African roots. The landscape, flora, fauna, and lore of the island, as well as its peasants - the often neglected, but important part of Cuba's soul and economy - was shown, more and more, in its art.\nIn 1938, the Second National Salon of Painting and Sculpture, showed art works. Some of the artists there, have been called part of a second generation of modern artists, including Cundo Bermudez, Mario Carre\u00f1o, Rita Longa, Alfredo Lozano, Luis Martinez-Pedro, and Ren\u00e9 Portocarrero\nThe painting \"The Jungle\" (1943) has been called a masterpiece (or a painting by a master) of Cuban art. The artist, Wifredo Lam, is not thought of, as being a part of the Vanguardia movement. (The painting is in a museum in the United States. It was bought in 1945.)\nIn 1944 in New York City (USA), the art exhibition \"Modern Cuban Painters\" was held at MoMA. That year Mario Carre\u00f1o had a solo exhibition (or his own exhibition) at San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.\nIn 1951 in Paris (France), an exhibition of modern Cuban art was shown at the Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne.\nAfter the Cuban Revolution of 1959, some artists made a decision to leave Cuba. Because the creation of art, was sponsored (or paid for) by the Cuban government, implied censorship occurred, since artists wouldn't want to make art that was against the government that was financing (or paying for) the art.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s conceptual art was introduced. Minimalism, Earth art, and Performance art was (sometimes) mixed with conceptual art\nIn 1984 the first Havana Biennial was held. (There have been biennials as late as 2015 and 2019.)\nIn 1997 in New York City (USA), the exhibition \"Na\u00efve Art in Cuba\", was held at Metropolitan Arts Center. It showed the art of fourteen Cuban artists of Na\u00efve art, and art from eight members of the \"Grupo Bayate\", an artists' collective (or group) from Mella, Santiago de Cuba. \nAs of 2015, few artists of Na\u00efve art have had works shown at art salons (or other exhibitions, such as) the biennial of Havana."}

He acted as General Counsel for the United Railroads in San Francisco.\nFord was born on a farm in Monroe County, Missouri, the son of Jacob Harrison Ford and Mary Winn Abernathy. He went to the district county school from 1863 to 1873 and graduated from high school in 1876.\nIn 1877, at the age of 19, Ford left Missouri and took an immigrant train to Colusa County, California. For three years, he worked on his uncle Hugh J. Glenn's ranch; Hugh Glenn was a Democratic candidate for Governor. Ford became a student in the law office of Colonel Park Henshaw in Chico, California. Ford was admitted to the California bar in August 1882.\nIn 1882, Ford moved to Oroville to practice law in partnership with Senator Albert F. Jones, under the firm name of \"Jones &amp; Ford\". This partnership lasted for one year when Ford moved to Downieville, California, the county seat of Sierra County, where he practiced law under the firm name of \"Smith &amp; Ford\". He specialized in mining law.\nIn 1888, Ford was elected as District Attorney of Sierra County on the Republican ticket. He re-elected in 1890 to the office without opposition, the Democrats making no nomination against him.\nFord became Republican California State Senator in 1892 and 1895 for California's 3rd State Senate district, Plumas, Sierra, and Nevada Counties. On March 23, 1893, Senator Ford introduced two bills known as the Ford's Mining Bills, Senate Bill No. 50, which would allow hydraulic mining where it can be done without material injury to the navigable rivers, and Senate Bill No. 389, which would appropriate $250,000 for building restraining dams, provided by the United States Government.\nHe was appointed attorney to the State Board of Harbor Commissioners in 1894, which office he held until elected Attorney General for the state of California in 1898. Ford solved a difficult legal dispute over ownership of an area known as Channel Street in the San Francisco's harbor leading to the bay. A judgment gave this land for public use to the city of San Francisco.\nHe served as the 18th California Attorney General 1899\u20131902. One of his noteworthy acts was the reversal of a decision regarding the inheritance tax on the Leland Stanford estate that converted $250,000 to public schools of San Francisco. He resigned as Attorney General in order to become General Counsel for the United Railroads (URR) of San Francisco.\nIn 1905, Governor George Pardee selected Ford to be the State Prison Director. Ford wrote a book called \"California State Prisons: their history, development and management\", published in 1910. As director, he created a special bureau for paroled prisoners.\nIn August 1902, Ford was appointed general counsel for the United Railroads of San Francisco. His knowledge of railroad law as of other departments of jurisprudence was comprehensive and accurate, and he stands today as one of the foremost representatives of the legal interests of California. As attorney for URR, he was involved in a bribery scandal in 1906, but was later found to be innocent. The bribery scandal was one of the many San Francisco graft trials, which included Mayor Eugene Schmitz and attorney Abe Ruef, who were receiving bribes.\nIn his retirement, Ford took up historical studies and literary pursuits. In 1926 he published a novel, \"Dawn and the Dons: The Romance of Monterey\", with vignettes and sketches by artist Jo Mora.\nOn June 26, 1928, Ford died in his bed due to a sudden heart attack. He was 70 years old. A funeral service was held at Gary's Chapel on Divisadero Street at Post in San Francisco. He was interred at the family mausoleum, at the Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma, California."}

It later came to include an awareness of other issues of social inequality, for example regarding gender and sexual orientation. Since the late 2010s it has also been used as a general word for left-wing political movements and viewpoints which emphasise the identity politics of people of color (those who are not white), LGBT people, and women.\nThe phrase \"stay woke\" began within the everyday language of some African Americans in the 1930s, because in African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) \"woke\" is instead of \"woken\", the usual form of \"wake\".\nAfter the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014, the word was used by Black Lives Matter (BLM) activists who wanted to raise awareness about police shootings of African Americans in the US. It became an Internet meme and was increasingly utilised by individuals who were not African American to show that they supported BLM. Popular among millennials, the word spread worldwide and was added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2017.\nThe word ended up being used as a catch-all term to describe left-wing ideologies, often centred on the identity politics of minority groups and informed by academic movements like critical race theory, which identified themselves as being devoted to social justice. This included BLM, anti-racism, and campaigns on women's and LGBT issues. By 2020, parts of the political right in some Western countries were ironically using the word \"woke\" to describe left-wing movements and ideologies they disagreed with. In turn, some left-wing activists came to consider it an offensive term used to belittle those campaigning against discrimination."}

But after that, people who were interested in eating more healthy foods began a push for healthy breakfasts.\nThis brought up the creation of Granula. The name \"Granula\" comes from \"granulates\", formed of grain. In 1863 this became the first breakfast cereal and included heavy nuggets made from bran, the outer husk of a grain that is taken out when making flour. The cereal had to be soaked overnight before being eaten. Simply pouring milk over it was not enough to make it eatable.\nThe cereals eaten today grew out of a health campaign that began in the 1860s.

In this way it is easier to abuse people of another group. For example, black people have been dehumanized by racist images comparing them to apes. Researchers say that this dehumanization continues to exist today: it can affect the punishment for a crime. Some people, such as Ota Benga, an African Mbuti man, were held in human zoos.

It wasn't until March, however, that the COVID-19 virus was confirmed in and around New York City. \nOn March 3, 2020, the New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the first recorded case of person-to-person spread in New York State was confirmed from a New Rochelle man. That man was working with a law firm in One Grand Central Place in Midtown Manhattan. Six days following that announcement, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced there were sixteen cases of the COVID-19 in New York City.\nThe virus later grew extremely rapidly. By Wednesday, March 25, 2020, over 17,000 cases were confirmed in and near New York City. By that time, there were almost 200 COVID-19 related deaths. At the time, the city was infected with a rate just under five times higher than the rest of the United States. Its cases were one-third of the total U.S. cases. Two days later on Friday, March, 27, in that same area, the infection rate went over 23,000. By that day, there were 365 deaths from the COVID-19 in New York City. Queens was the worst-affected Borough in the number of deaths. It had well over a third of total deaths. Most of the deaths from COVID-19 involved those who had underlying health problems, including although not limited to diabetes (either type), being overweight/obese, having heart disease, HIV/AIDS, dementia, Down syndrome and certain cancers. During a twenty-four hour period on March 28 and 29, 2020, the number of deaths due to COVID-19 tripled in New York City. About 222 more death from the virus took place during that period. The overall deaths from the virus in that city was at 672. The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the same city was at or near 30,765. On Tuesday, March 31, the first death of a child due to COVID-19 in New York City was recorded. At the exact same time, CNN news anchor Chris Cuomo, the brother of Andrew Coumo, tested positive for the virus.\nNew York City also saw its first case of animals testing positive for COVID-19. Just after the Bronx Zoo in that city closed in mid-March 2020, two Malayan tigers were showing signs of the virus near the very end of the month. The cats, Nadia and her sister Azul, had a dry cough and wheezing. Nadia and Azul both tested positive for the virus. Seven other large cats at the Bronx Zoo also showed signs of the COVID-19 virus. The areas around that zoo were hit with the virus in high and large numbers. \nOn Saturday, April 4, Governor Andrew Cuomo stated that the Chinese government arranged for the donation of just under 1,000 venilators being sent to the state of New York under foundations that were run by Joseph Tsai and Jack Ma. Another 140 ventilators were reported being sent by the state of Oregon.\nOn April 6, 2020, there were about 72,181 confirmed cases and at least 2,475 deaths. New York City accounted for just under 25% of the COVID-19 deaths in the United States. The following day, \"Gothamist\" reported the actual New York City death count as having been counted less than the actual numbers. Bodies of people who had died at home, around 280 every day, were being picked up by United States Army, the United States National Guard and the Air National Guard.\nOn May 10, Mayor de Blasio stated 38 children were found as having been affected by an inflammatory syndrome that might have been linked with an immune response from COVID-19. This condition was called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C); it was life-threatening. This condition was strongly similar to Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome (two other conditions known to affect children and teenagers. One child had died in New York City. Another two child deaths were reported in New York State. An association with COVID-19 was not yet proven as of May 2020.\nOn Saturday, July 11, 2020, a seven-year-old German Shepherd named buddy died of COVID-19. The dog tested positive three months earlier when his guardians noticed he was having breathing problems. Buddy was the first dog in the United States to test positive for COVID-19.\nThe government response to COVID-19.\nOn March 14, 2020, just before statewide stay-at-home notices (also known as \"New York State on PAUSE\" executive orders) were put in effect, all New York Public Library buildings in Staten Island, Manhattan and the Bronx were temporarily closed. The Queens Public Library and Brooklyn Public Library closed later. Theaters, concert venues and nightclubs in and near New York City were shut down beginning from March 17. The area restaurants were restricted to deliveries and take-out only. The schools were closed until at least April 20. The gymnasiums were closed also.\nGovernor Cuomo and his governor's office stated that shelter in place orders could only be put in effect by the governor's office. De Blasio's Mayor's office agreed. Three days following that statement, on March 20, 2020, with 5,683 confirmed cases for COVID-19 in New York City, Cuomo and his governor's office began issuing the PAUSE order that would go into effect on March 22 at 8pm. This order put into place ten restrictions, summarized under this executive order, listed below:\nThe governor said the provisions would be enforced. Any businesses violating this order faced fines and were subject to being closed. Businesses that qualified as \"essential business\" under the stay-at-home notice included though were not limited to:\nOn Monday, April 6, 2020, the PAUSE order over New York State was extended until April 29. The rates of intensive care unit admissions were slowing. Fines for violating the social distancing protocols were increased from $500 to $1,000. On Thursday, April 16, the state's PAUSE order was extended until Friday, May 15.\nOn May 17, 2021, Governor Cuomo said new guidelines coming from the Centers and Disease Control and Prevention related to face masks and social distancing for vaccinated people were being phased in by May 19.\nIn early 2021, one year following the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, the SARS-CoV-2 Iota variant (which might have developed locally in and around the New York City area) accounted for just over 45% of the city's new cases. The variant began appearing in samples collected in New York City in November 2020. \nTwo other variants started affecting the United States, including the New York metropolitan area just after 2021 got started: the SARS-CoV-2 Gamma variant and the UK variant. These three variants of the coronavirus have become more common in certain areas of the United States. The New York variant is spreading faster in New York City and its metropolitan areas.\nThe demographics.\nIt was reported on Sunday, April 5, 2020 that almost 51% of lab-confirmed COVID-19 cases in New York City affected people at least 50 years old. During weeks before, the usual likely cases were males between ages 18 and 49 years old.\nIn April 2020, \"The New York Times\" stated that the virus was almost twice as deadly to Black/African Americans and Hispanic/Latino people as White people in New York City and its metropolitan areas. By early May 2020, over 5,200 Hispanics or Latinos in and around New York City had died of COVID-19. This made them an ethnic group with the highest number of deaths from the condition."}

A double may be projected onto any person, from a stranger to a family member.\nThis syndrome is often diagnosed together with another mental disorder, such as schizophrenia or other disorders involving psychotic hallucinations. There is no widely accepted method of treatment, as most patients require individualized therapy.

She was very close to her mother and stayed with her when John Adams was away. When Abigail Adams went to join her husband in Paris, Nabby went with her. She spent time in Paris and in London.\nMarriage and children.\nOn June 12, 1786, Abigail married Colonel William Stephens Smith. They had four children: William Steuben Smith, John Adams Smith, Thomas Smith, and Caroline Amelia Smith. William Stephens Smith was always trying to get rich quickly and made many foolish decisions, so the Smiths did not have much money. But John Adams got William Stephens Smith a job as a surveyor for the Port of New York. In 1806, William Stephens Smith was arrested for trying to overthrow the government of Venezuela and lost his job. Things were so bad that Abigail Adams Smith talked about divorce to her mother. He eventually started a farm in East Chester, New York and became a member of Congress.\nIllness and death.\nWhen she was 46, she found a lump in her breast. She moved to her parents' farm in Massachusetts and talked to two doctors, Tufts and Rush. They told her the best thing to do was surgery. At the time, there was no good way to make people stay asleep during surgery, so Abigail Adams Smith was awake for most of it. It took 25 minutes and another hour to close the wound. She lived for another two years. But she became very thin and came back to Quincy to die.\nAbigail Adams wrote about the end of her daughter's life: \"She told her physician that she was perfectly sensible of her situation and reconciled to it...Although she was bolstered up in her bed and could neither walk or stand, she was always calm.\"\nAccording to McCollough, John Adams felt \"as if he were living in the Book of Job\" when Nabby was dying."}

It meant the borders in which permanent residency by Jews was allowed (from 1791 to 1917). Beyond these places, Jewish residency, permanent or temporary, was mostly forbidden.\nThe old English term \"pale\" is got from the Latin word \"\", a stake, and so extended to mean the area enclosed by a fence or boundary.\nThe Pale of Settlement included all of modern Belarus, Lithuania and Moldova, much of Ukraine and Poland, and small parts of Latvia and the western Russian Federation.\nIt extended from the eastern \"pale\", or demarcation line inside the country, westwards to the Imperial Russian border with the Kingdom of Prussia (later the German Empire) and Austria-Hungary. It was about 20% of European Russia.\nHistorians argue that the motivations for its creation and maintenance were primarily economic and nationalist in nature.\nThe end of the enforcement and formal demarcation of the Pale coincided with the beginning of World War I in 1914 and then ultimately, the fall of the Russian Empire in the February and October Revolutions of 1917.\nThe religious nature of the edicts creating the Pale is clear: conversion to Russian Orthodoxy, the state religion, released people from the restrictions. Historians argue that the motivations for its creation were mainly economic and nationalist in nature.\nTerrible anti-Jewish pogroms occurred from 1881 to 1883 and from 1903 to 1906. The Jewish community responded by organising a welfare system.\nOne consequence of the Pale was a tendency to restrict marriage by Jews, not just to other Jews, but often in practice to those who attended the same synagogue. The effects are similar to those of the Royal Families of Europe, who eventually showed the genetic effects of inbreeding even though the marriages were legal and in other ways quite appropriate. Just as in European royalty, the communities behind the Pale, and now in normal life, show a higher percentage of deleterious genetic defects than the wider population. This is because the parents were, unknowingly, to some extent consanguineous (related)."}

It happened in Philadelphia during the American Revolutionary War. John Andre threw the party on May 18, 1778 for General William Howe. About 400 people came to the party\nMotivation.\nThe party was for General William Howe and Admiral Richard Howe. They were leaders in the British military. William Howe was being sent back to England because the government blamed him for the loss of the Battle of Saratoga. But the men in the army thought he was a very good general and decided to throw him a large party.\nEvent.\nTo start the party, the Howe brothers and other leaders floated down the Delaware river on decorated boats. People in the buildings on the sides of the river waved to them. Military musicians played music. The \"HMS Roebuck\" fired a seventeen-gun salute.\nMost of the party was at Walnut Grove. Walnut grove had belonged to a man named Joseph Wharton, but he supported the American Revolution, so the British had taken it. Major John Andre was the master of ceremonies, meaning he organized the party and told everyone what would happen next.\nAndre planned a medieval-style joust, where men on horseback would practice-fight with lances. He named the two teams the Knights of the Blended Rose and the Knights of the Burning Mountain and designed costumes, flags, and slogans for them. Each knight had a lady, like in the tradition of courtly love from the middle ages. Andre picked women from loyalist American families. He gave them costumes to wear that would remind people of the Crusades. The women's costumes were what 18th-century English people thought of as Turkish.\nAfter the joust, the party guests walked under two triumphal arches that Andre had built for the party. The first arch was decorated with things about the ocean, like the Roman god Neptune with his trident. This was to honor Admiral Howe. The second was decorated with military trophies. This was to honor General Howe. Then there was dancing and fireworks.\nThe guests ate dinner in a beautifully decorated tent. Twenty-four enslaved men in costumes served dinner.\nCosts.\nTwenty-two British officers got the money for the party: \u00a33,312. This did not count the costumes people wore, which cost about \u00a312,000.\nResponse.\nMost of the people who went to and wrote about the Meschianza said how beautiful and elegant everything was. However, other people did not like that the officers had celebrated a triumph, or victory, before the war was won.\nRichard Howe's secretary, Ambrose Serle wrote, \"Every man of Sense, among ourselves, tho\u2019 not unwilling to pay a due Respect, was ashamed of this mode of doing it.\"\nA Quaker named Elizabeth Drinker wrote that she did not like the idea of throwing a big party when so many people were being hurt by the war: \"How insensible these people appear, while our land is so greatly desolated, and death and sore destruction has overtaken and impends over so many.\""}

People who worked for the newspaper were accused of hacking phones, police bribery, and other crimes in order to get stories. Even though investigations that took place from 2005 to 2007 suggested that the newspaper only hacked the phones of celebrities, politicians, and people in the British royal family, in July 2011 it was found out that the phones of killed student Milly Dowler, family of dead British soldiers, and people killed in the 7 July 2005 London bombings had also been hacked. The anger of the public at News Corporation caused many well-known people to stop working there, including Rupert Murdoch and his son. The commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police Service (MPS), Sir Paul Stephenson, also left their jobs. Many companies stopped advertising work with the newspaper, leading to the end of the \"News of the World\" on 10 July 2011, after 168 years of making newspapers. Anger from the public meant News Corporation decided to cancel its suggested takeover of the British television broadcaster BSkyB.\nThe prime minister David Cameron said on 6 July 2011 that a public investigation, known as the Leveson Inquiry, would look into phone hacking and police bribery by the \"News of the World\", if what some British newspapers did to get stories was okay and that the Press Complaints Commission would be changed and replaced fully. A few arrests and prison sentenced followed, most well-known being the arrest of the former \"News of the World\" top editor Andy Coulson."}

Smith was a Southern liberal who would easily go against segregation and work on taking apart Jim Crow laws. This was during a time when such actions would almost always guarantee being cut off from society.\nIn 1944. Smith published her controversial and best-selling book \"Strange Fruit\". The book dealt with a then-forbidden and very controversial theme: mixed race romances. The book was originally titled \"Jordan is So Chilly\". Smith, however, changed the title for the novel to \"Strange Fruit\". Not long after the novel was released, it was banned in Boston, Massachusetts and Detroit, Michigan under reasons of \"lewdness\" and profane language. The novel was also banned from being mailed in the United States Postal Service. The ban against the novel, though, was lifted by the then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt when his wife Eleanor made a request toward him.\nCivil Rights activism.\nOne of several ways Smith openly discussed the problems of segregation was while she was counseling campers. It was this period of creative control on the camp which allowed her to use it for talking about modern social issues. Those were the dangers of inequality and how to improve society in relation to women.\nDeath.\nSmith dealt with breast cancer beginning in the early 1950s. She died from the disease at age 68. Her book, \"The Journey\", refers to her battle.\nLegacy of Lillian Smith.\nSmith's novel \"Strange Fruit\" remains her most famous work. The book was translated under fifteen different languages.\nIn 1999, Smith was given an award by the Georgia Women of Achievement.\nBeginning in 1968, the Lillian Smith Book Awards were given out annually. But in 2003, there was not enough money being given to the Southern Regional Council. The awards are the Southern United States' best-known and oldest book award.

It is a sequel to \"Macross Digital Mission VF-X\" and set ten years after the Sharon Apple Incident, as depicted in the \"Macross Plus\" OVA. The game is notable for having many of its story elements being carried over to the \"Macross Frontier\" television series.\nThis is one of the few notable Macross-related games where the player's actions can affect the ending.\nAn USA version of the game was planned but was never released.\nSynopsis.\n\"VF-X mission standby... VF-X mission standby... Good luck!\".\n\"Macross VF-X2\" is a third person shooting game where the player operates a variable fighter (Valkyrie) that's part of a special service unit known as the VF-X Ravens, a similar unit to the one seen in \"Macross Digital Mission VF-X\". Similar to its predecessor, UNiT developed the game mechanics, and the original creators of the Macross series participated in the production, including Sh\u014dji Kawamori, Kazutaka Miyatake, Haruhiko Mikimoto, Ichiro Itano. Hidetaka Tenjin, a CG illustrator, was also involved in this production.\nNew variable attack aircraft were introduced in the game, including the VA-3M Invader and the variable fighter VB-6 K\u00f6nig Monster. The K\u00f6nig Monster is based on the original Destroid Giant Monster that was designed by Miyatake and Kawamori, but now includes a new three-stage transformation design. This design would later be re-used by the S.M.S. in \"Macross Frontier\".\nPlot.\nIn A.D. 2050, as a result of continuing emmigration of humanity and Zentradi across the galaxy, society had approached a period of relative stability. Riots and revolts suddenly began as political and military tensions arose among the frontier colonies, and domestic terrorist acts and syndicate crimes became more frequent. By August 15th, 2050, The U.N. Spacy deploys special ace squadrons to deal with the unrest. The 727th Independent Squadron VF-X Ravens is established as a special service unit, utilizing the latest AVF (Advanced Variable Fighter). \"Genius\" pilot Aegis Focker is assigned to \"Alpha\", but is initially looked down upon as a \"Cherry Ace\" by Major Gilliam Angreat and Commander Wilbur Garland.\nThe Ravens race against the clock to stop the terrorist group Black Rainbow, led by Timoshie Daldanton, codename \"All Kill Wizard\" and the Critical Path Corporation led by Manfred Brando. By December 1st, 2050, the Ravens prevent the enemy from deploying a superweapon known as the \"Flagship\" against colonies like Eden 3. Along the way, Aegis befriends Gilliam and sparks a romance with his mission controllers Brigitte Spark and Clara Calette. During the battle with Black Rainbow, Gilliam goes missing after his battle with the enemy ace, Mariafokina Barnrose, who happens to be head of another anti-government group, Vindirance. Aegis takes over the Ravens as its leader and leads two new team members, Shun Toma and Suzie Newtlet to stop the terrorists.\nAs the war rages and the Black Rainbow fleet approaches Earth, Daldhanton is defeated at the hands of Aegis. He reveals the truth about Banrose and Gilliam's loyalties, which depresses Aegis, so he takes Brigitte shopping. Following that, Aegis' Gilliam suddenly appears before him and reveals that the U.N. Spacy is corrupt and that Raven's commander, Wilbur Garland, is in league with terrorist Daldhanton. Aegis is forced to make a decision whether to kill his former Captain or forsake his companions and join the Black Rainbow.\nFollow Gilliam (Black Rainbow Route).\nIn February 14th, 2051, Aegis joins the Black Rainbow and learns about an Earth supremacist group Latence that has entrenched itself within the United Nations Government and used the VF-X Ravens as a means of suppressing dissent from the colony worlds. They intend to dominate the galaxy with a wide-area weapon Jamming System based on \"Di-Zauber Frethe\", which utilizes \"super-space resonant lens\" developed by the Critical Path Corporation. Aegis and Gilliam break through the Earth Defense Network and maneuver through Earth's atmosphere.\nAs they reach Earth's surface, Gilliam decides to get sentimental with you about Earth, but is suddenly killed by Ravens' commander Wilbur Garland's custom VF-22 Sturmvogel II, which is armed with a special Targetting Jamming device. Eimi Clocks calls in to lend Aegis' her support, as Garland and his force of X-9 Ghost are pushed back. Banrose appears and is saddened by the news of Gilliam's death. Suddenly, the SDF-1 Macross rises from lake where it once rested. The Earth's garrison fleet fires upon the Macross but are ineffective against its defenses and main cannon. Aegis' former comrade, Shun Toma, fires upon your wingmate, Suzie Newtlett and challenges him to a duel. He's easily defeated and Aegis moves in on Garland and his jamming device. Barnrose joins the fight to fend off incoming enemy fighters that are approaching Aegis.\nWith the help of Aegis' teammates at \"Alpha Squadron\", they engage in operation \"Remember Love\" and defeat Wilbur by destroying the SDF-1 Macross' head, which contained the wide-area Jamming System. The SDF-1 falls to the ground and Garland flees to regroup. He then launches his own Macross 13-class vessel stationed in space and moves above Earth's atmosphere and fires upon the rest of Earth's defense fleet. The Earth garrison fleet then launches an attack that completely destroys the Macross 13 in a brilliant explosion. With Latence defeated, Aegis and his friends fly off into space as credits roll.\nIn his last scene, Aegis leaves a bouquet of flowers and a flight helmet on the ground in front of Gilliam's headstone. He looks back for a second and then walks off into the sunset.\nFollow Wilber Garland (U.N. Spacy Route).\nAegis immediately engages Barnrose. When she is defeated in battle, she tells Aegis why she joined Gilliam and that she fought for her ideals before her Valkyrie explodes. Gilliam then challenges Aegis to a duel, which happens to be the hardest in the game.\nBefore he dies, he praises Aegis for his skill. Aegis returns to base and is comforted by his communication officer, Eimi Clocks. Aegis' journey is over.\nGameplay.\nPlayers can freely transform into the three modes of the Valkyrie, which are fighter, Gerwalk and Battroid during gameplay. It also allows a number of missiles to be loaded a fired in a manner similar to the dynamic battle depicted by Ichiro Itano in his now infamous \"Itano Circus\". In addition, the game content and mechanics that poorly received with the game's predecessor were overhauled, and a number of improvements to the control were made. In particular, the game introduced a unique third-person viewpoint movement system called \u201cvariable view\u201d which helps create the sense as of the player being in a \u201cvalkyrie simulator\u201d that helps sets it apart from general 3D shooting games at the time.\nVariable View.\nUnlike other 3D shooters whose viewpoints are fixed in the rear of the aircraft and in the cockpit, \"VF-X2\" has an innovative dynamic viewpoint system that keeps the aircraft and enemy aircraft (missile) in the same camera. There are two types, the \"Missile\" viewpoint, which follows missiles launched by enemy fighters, and the \"TARGET\" viewpoint, which keeps track of the enemy currently on-target, so players can switch freely during the game. With this variable view, it is possible to avoid the enemy while watching the missile shot and to grasp the movement of the enemy aircraft. This helps players avoid losing sight of the enemy.\nIn addition to the variable view, the \u201cFORWARD\u201d view from the rear of the aircraft, which is often accessed in normal 3D shooting via the option settings, can be used by the player. All three viewpoint options can be used freely."}

Sheldon was added into the Science Fiction Hall of Fame in 2012.\nIn 1936, Sheldon participated in group shows at the Art Institute of Chicago. She had connections to the institute through her family. It showed some new American work. This was an important step forward for Sheldon's painting career. At this time Sheldon also took private art lessons from John Sloan. She disliked prudery in painting. While examining an anatomy book for an art class, Sheldon saw that the genitals were blurred. She then restored the genitals of the figures with a pencil.\nIn 1939, a nude self-portrait from Sheldon named \"Portrait in the Country\" was accepted for the \"All-American\" biennial at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D.C.. The portrait was displayed there for just over six weeks. While these two shows were seen as big breaks, she downplayed the accomplishments. She said then that \"only second-rate painters sold.\" Sheldon preferred keeping her art works at home.\nThe science fiction career.\nNot long after Sheldon started writing science fiction, in 1967 she adopted the name James Tiptree Jr. The name \"Tiptree\" was from branded jars of marmalade. The \"Jr.\" was the idea of her husband. In one interview, Sheldon said: \"A male name seemed like good camouflage. I had the feeling that men would slip by less observed. I've had too many experiences in my life of being the first woman in some damned occupation.\"\nThe \"Tiptree\" pen name was maintained until late in 1977. That was in part because though the name was widely known as a pen name, it was well understood that its use was to protect the professional reputations of the intelligence community official.\nBut then, in 1976, \"Tiptree\" said during a letter that \"his\" mother, also a writer, died in Chicago. Those details led the fans to see the obituary. Sheldon's actual identity was then exposed.\nThe themes.\nBefore Sheldon's real identity was exposed, Tiptree was often known as an unusually macho male.

Incumbent Republican President Herbert Hoover lost to Democratic Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt of New York.\nHoover was blamed for the Great Depression, and tried to ease it, but the Depression got worse. Roosevelt also had the advantage of name recognition, since he was the fifth cousin of the late Theodore Roosevelt.\nThis election marked a long period where Democrats controlled the White House, as Democrats would win the next five elections. It also marked the beginning of Roosevelt's 12 years and 1 month as President-the longest tenure of any President."}

It was a widely published newspaper weekly during the 20th century, with many well-known editors-in-chief over the years. \"Newsweek\" was later bought by The Washington Post Company in 1961, which kept it until 2010. After having difficulties with keeping money from 2008 until 2012, they started only publishing online. The print edition was trmsfr in March 2014.\nLowering in earnings resulted in an August 2010 sale by The Washington Post Company to sounds technician Sidney Harman for a price of one dollar and taking ownership of any potential problems with the magazine.. Later that year, \"Newsweek\" joined with \"The Daily Beast\", making The Newsweek Daily Beast Company. In 2013, IBT Media said it had taken over \"Newsweek\" from IAC; the sale included the \"Newsweek\" name and its online newspaper, but not \"The Daily Beast\". IBT Media renamed itself as Newsweek Media Group in 2017 and rebranded back to IBT Media in 2018."}

It has been celebrated every year on 14 August since 14 August 1948. On that date, British India became an independent country, the Dominion of Pakistan. (The Dominion of Pakistan became today's Islamic Republic of Pakistan in 1956, on Republic Day.) It commemorates the day when Pakistan achieved independence and was declared a sovereign state following the end of the British Raj in 1947. Pakistan came into existence as a result of the Pakistan Movement, which aimed for the creation of an independent Muslim state in the north-western regions of British India via partition. The movement was led by the All-India Muslim League under the leadership of Muhammad Ali Jinnah. The event was brought forth by the Indian Independence Act 1947 under which the British Raj gave independence to the Dominion of Pakistan which comprised West Pakistan (present-day Pakistan) and East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). In the Islamic calendar, the day of independence coincided with Ramadan 27, the eve of which, being Laylat al-Qadr, is regarded as sacred by Muslims."}

Other works that are adapted to motion pictures are comic books, plays, historical sources and other movies.\nSeveral plays from William Shakespeare have been adapted into movies. Those include \"Hamlet\", \"Othello\" and \"Romeo and Juliet\". Examples of Hamlet on screen are the 1969, 1990 and 1996 movies. Examples for \"Romeo and Juliet\" being adapted under film include the 1936, 1968 and \"Romeo + Juliet\" (1996) movies.\nAcross Britain, where stage plays tend being more popular for entertainment than in the United States, many movies start off as stage productions. Examples of British and British-American motion pictures based on successful British plays include \"Gaslight\" (1940), \"Shirley Valentine\" (1989) and \"The Madness of King George\" (1994).\nIn similar, hit Broadway plays are often adapted under movies. Examples of Broadway plays adapted under movies are \"A Streetcar Named Desire\" (1951), \"Children of a Lesser God\" (1986), \"Glengarry Glen Ross\" (1992) and \"Real Women Have Curves\" (2002).\nMovies are sometimes created from a television series. In some cases, the movie offers a longer storyline than the usual television program format. In the adaptation of \"The X-Files\" to the movie format, greater effects and a longer plotline were involved. Adaptations of television shows will give the viewers an opportunity of seeing that show's characters without broadcast restrictions. Such additions\u2013explicit sexual content, profanity, nudity, drug use, adult themes or graphic violence\u2013are only the shown adaptive addition. Movie versions of \"Miami Vice\" and \"South Park\" are examples of such motion pictures adapted off the related television programs.\nAwards.\nCertain major movies' award programs present awards for adapted screenplays, different from those for original screenplays.\nThe adaptation of motion pictures.\nWhen movies' screenplays are original, they are also the sources for derivative works, like novels and plays. For example, certain movie studios will sell the rights of popular title to novel publishing companies.\nNovelization builds up the characters and events happening for commercial reasons.\nExamples of motion pictures adapted from novels are \"Fanny Hill\" (1748), \"Where the Truth Lies\" (2003), \"Delta of Venus\" (1977), \"Young Adam\" (1954), \"Blue Is the Warmest Colour\" (2013) and \"Emmanuelle\" (1974)."}
