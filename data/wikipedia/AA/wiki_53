They are amphibious, living in sea water, rivers and on land. In terms of weight, it is the third largest amphibious animal, after the bull elephant seal (typically 2700 kg/6000 lb; 5 m or 16 ft) and the walrus. \nCrocodiles are an ancient form of life, with fossils from 200 million years ago. 'Salties', as they are commonly called, are found in Northern Australia, New Guinea, some parts of Southeast Asia, and the surrounding waters. They live in habitats near the coast: rivers, swamps, billabongs, beaches and sometimes the open sea.\nDescription.\nThe saltwater crocodile is a large reptile growing to about in length. The males are bigger than the female, with some rare individuals as long as 7 metres (23 feet). Others believe in a slightly smaller size of 6.3 metres (20.7 feet). They can weigh up to . They have a powerful tail which helps with swimming. They have a wide snout, with big scales making two rows down their neck and back.\nSaltwater crocodiles are now a protected species in Australia. However, if humans are at risk of being attacked, the crocodile is moved to avoid possible harm. Many years ago, Australia used to export crocodile skin. Between 1945 and 1958 more than 87,000 skins were exported. They became so scarce that hunters had difficulty finding any. They were protected in Western Australia in 1969, the Northern Territory in 1971, and Queensland in 1974. Hunting crocodiles is now illegal. There are now farms to breed crocodiles for the skins to make leather, meat and for Chinese medicines.\nReproduction.\nSaltwater crocodiles reproduce during the wet season, in Australia from November to March. There is a complex mating ritual which includes them rubbing their heads and bodies together, before they mate in the water. The female builds a nest with plants that she breaks off with her teeth, and then pushes together with her back legs. A female crocodile can lay up to 60 eggs at a time. These eggs are large, with a hard shell. They take about three months to hatch. If the temperature in the nest is less than 32 degrees Celsius, the baby crocodiles will be female. If the temperature is between 32 and 33 degrees the babies will be male. When the crocodiles hatch out of the eggs, the mother will carry them in her mouth to the water. Few of them survive in the wild and grow to be adult crocodiles.\nBehavior.\nSaltwater crocodiles can be dangerous (and very aggressive) to both humans and other animals. They can move very fast in the water and on land. Sometimes, they can kill a person, but this does not happen very often.

By 700 AD, the Dorset culture was on Dildo island. In 1613, the Beothuks, who were living on Dildo Island at this time. Henry Crout met them, traded with them, and left gifts. In 1711, the people of Trinity Bay were ordered by Governor Crow to leave their homes during the winter, to defend themselves against the French who burned their houses. Dildo Island was one of the places designated for this purpose. The town of Dildo was created in the late 1700s and settled to use the marine resources such as fish (mostly cod), whales and seals.\nAll Saints' Anglican Church.\nThe first church was built in 1878. It was a simple structure with no tower. It was wide by long. It could hold 250 people. It was heated by two coal stoves, one at each end, which shared a chimney. This church served the community until 1964 when the present (larger) building was constructed.\nPresent.\nDildo has a fast-growing tourist industry. It has picturesque scenery, several bed and breakfasts, places to eat, the Dildo Museum interpretive centre, the Historic Dildo Days celebration in August, boat tours, the Society of United Fishermen, the Lions centre, several heritage structures, walking trails, many businesses and road sign souvenirs.\nDildo has been in many media outlets. It was on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's \"On the Road Again\" and \"Land and Sea\". It was also on a live radio broadcast from the interpretation centre. In August 2006, Dildo was the subject of the \"What the...?\" segment on the Australian television talk show \"Rove Live\". The town is mentioned in the song \"A Night in Dildo\" by The Arrogant Worms.\nSouth Dildo.\nSouth Dildo is an unincorporated community. In 2008, 205 people lived there. At the beginning of the 20th century, South Dildo had lumbering work. It supplied a schooner to the Labrador fishery. It had the roadside attraction of a wooden life-size humpback whale head. (The whale head was destroyed at the beginning of the 2006-2007 winter.)"}

It consists mainly of hydrocarbons. The main component is methane. Natural gas is often found in the ground together with petroleum.\nStorage and Transport.\nThe main difficulty in the use of natural gas is transportation. Natural gas pipelines are economical, but are impractical across oceans. Liquefied natural gas tankers are also used.\nCompressed natural gas (CNG) is stored in containers at high pressure. \nLiquefied natural gas (LNG) is stored at temperatures as low as - 260\u00b0F (- 162\u00b0C). At these temperature conditions, natural gas is in a liquid state.\nIndustrial use.\nNatural gas is used for the production of electricity, it is also often used because it makes less pollution than other fossil fuels. Some is used as fuel for vehicles.\nNatural gas vehicle and technology.\nHistory.\n\u00c9tienne Lenoir built 1862 the first gas engine, before there have been fuel and diesel engines. Over the years gas was used in many different machines, so the technology improved also. From the 1950s the automobile industry focused more on fuel technology than on gas technology. There have only been single cars with natural gas technology and few gas stations which offered natural gas. Because of climate and environment the role of natural gas became more and more important.\nCurrent development.\nWorldwide existing about 5.7 million natural gas vehicles.(Argentina, Brasilia and Pakistan together count 4.2 million!)\n\"Europe\"\nThe French automobile producer Citroen is cooperating with a French gas supplier and wants to offer a compressor which is connected to the private gas connection at home, so that everyone can refuel his car at home.The price for the compressor will be about 500 \u20ac. There will be also a tax reduction for people who have bought a new NGV. And the business group carrefour wants to install natural gas stations.(Region Toulouse)\nIn London and surroundings, NGVs are free from paying the city toll. Owners of NGVs have to pay less motor vehicle tax.\nUntil 2011 MAN will deliver 135 busses with natural gas engines for the municipal use of the city Den Haag.\n\"Asia\"\nThe Turkish capital Ankara will increase their use of natural gas vehicles about 500.\nIn India has already started a development programme to reduce pollution.\nThe number of NGVs increases very fast in Pakistan. Meanwhile there are driving about 1.4 million cars.\nIn Thailand, the government is planning a switch from fuel gas stations to natural gas stations, and to develop the NGVs.\n\"America\"\nIn Brasilia, the police of Rio de Janeiro had 632 natural gas vehicles.\nThe use of NGV in the USA, makes it possible to maintain under the Ultra Low Emission Vehicle Standards(ULEV).\nTechnology- how does it work?\nThere are two variants of NG-technology, either the bifuel version, that means that the vehicle can drive with fuel or natural gas, or the monofuel version, this vehicle can only drive with natural gas. In principle the natural gas engine works like a otto-engine, the only significant difference is that this engine needs a natural gas-air-mix instead of fuel-air-mix.\nA conversion is possible with each car(with a few exceptions).\nThe automobile industry will offer a new natural gas technology with turbo --&gt; Turbo natural gas(TNG).\nProfitability.\nThe advantages of natural gas are the lower price in comparison with fuel and the lower tax rate.\nSupply in Germany.\nSince January 2008 there are 771 natural gas stations in Germany. The supply network will expand constantly.The E.ON Gas Mobil GmbH wants to install over 150 natural gas stations close to the freeways.\nConclusion.\nThe natural gas technology was and is still very popular. Because of the current gas-conflict in Russia, natural gas became less popular. However, natural gas is a finite resource. The prices for gas will increase in the next years (like fuel), so there will be needed new technologies in the future."}

Serial numbers are made in such a way that they change by a fixed discrete integer value, each time a new serial number is needed. Most people refer to any identifier that has numbers and letters in it as a serial number and that can be used to pick a certain item of a large number of items. Not every numerical identifier is a serial number; identifying numbers which are not serial numbers are sometimes called .\nSequence numbers are almost always non-negative, and typically start at zero or one. \nWhat are serial numbers used for?\nSerial numbers can be very useful for quality control. That way, if there is a problem with a certain batch of products, the serial number of one defective item can tell which items are affected by the problem. Serial numbers can also be used against stealing or imitating products, because it is possible to keep track of which serial numbers have been used. Stolen goods or those with problems can be identified more easily.\nMany computer programs come with serial numbers, often called \"Compact Disc keys\", and the installers often require the user to enter a valid serial number to continue. These numbers are verified using a certain algorithm to avoid usage of counterfeit keys. \nSerial numbers also help track down counterfeit currency, because in some countries each banknote has a unique serial number. \nThe International Standard Serial Number or ISSN can be seen on magazines and other periodicals. It is the similar to the International Standard Book Number (ISBN) for books. It is serially assigned but takes its name from the library science use of serial to mean a periodical, like a newspaper.\nCertificates and Certificate Authorities (CA) are necessary for widespread use of cryptography. These depend on applying mathematically rigorous serial numbers and serial number arithmetic \nThe term \"serial number\" is also used in military formations as an alternative to the expression \"service number\". In air forces the serial number is used to identify a specific aircraft. It is usually painted on both sides of the aircraft, most often in the tail area, although in some cases the serial is painted on the side of the aircraft's fin/rudder(s). Because of this, the serial number is sometimes called a \"tail number\".\nIn the case of the UK Royal Air Force (RAF) the \"Serial\" takes the form of two letters followed by three numbers, e.g., \"BT308\"\u2014the prototype Avro Lancaster, or \"XS903\"\u2014an English Electric Lightning F.6 at one time based at RAF Binbrook . During the Second World War RAF aircraft carrying secret equipment or that were in themselves secret had \"/G\" added to the end of the serial, the \"G\" signifying \"Guard\", denoting that the aircraft was to have an armed guard at all times while on the ground, e.g., \"LZ548/G\"\u2014the prototype de Havilland Vampire jet fighter, or \"ML926/G\"\u2014a de Havilland Mosquito XVI experimentally fitted with H2S radar. Prior to this two-letter, three-number scheme, the RAF and preceding Royal Flying Corps (RFC) used a serial with a letter followed by four numbers, e.g., \"D8096\" - a Bristol F.2 Fighter currently owned by the Shuttleworth Collection, or \"K5054\" - the prototype Supermarine Spitfire. The aircraft serial number does not change.\nSerial number arithmetic.\nSerial numbers are often used in network protocols. However, most sequence numbers in computer protocols are limited to a fixed number of bits, and will wrap around after a sufficiently many numbers have been allocated. Thus, recently-allocated serial numbers may duplicate very old serial numbers, but not other recently-allocated serial numbers. To avoid ambiguity with these non-unique numbers, RFC 1982, \"Serial Number Arithmetic\" defines special rules for calculations involving these kinds of serial numbers.\nLollipop sequence number spaces are a more recent and sophisticated scheme for dealing with finite-sized sequence numbers in protocols."}

Some of the most common variations to the salad include: grilled poultry (most often chicken), meat, shellfish, or fish, capers, Romano cheese, anchovies, and bacon.\nCaesar dressing can be either creamy, like Ranch dressing, or more oily, like Italian dressing. Its main flavourings are garlic and anchovies.\nHistory.\nThe salad is said to have been made and called after Caesar Cardini, an Italian immigrant who had restaurants in Mexico and the United States. Cardini was living in San Diego but also working in Tijuana.\nThe original Caesar salad did not have anchovy. Cardini's daughter said that the original recipe included whole lettuce leaves. \nHealth concerns.\nThere are risks of infection by salmonella bacteria. Salmonella is sometimes in raw eggs. This is a concern with many similar dressings. They are emulsified with eggs. Later versions of the recipe call for briefly cooked coddled eggs or pasteurized eggs. There are many variations of this salad."}

A proxy server might check the list of pages accessed against a \"blacklist\", if the address is on the blacklist, the page cannot be accessed.\nExamples of systems protected.\nBlacklists are used to protect a variety of systems in computing. The content of the blacklist has to be targeted to the type of system defended.\nInformation systems.\nAn information system includes hosts like computers and servers. A blacklist in this location may include certain types of software that aren't allowed to run in the company environment. For example, a company might blacklist worker to worker file sharing on its systems, to stop them editing worker information. In addition to software, people, devices and websites can also be blacklisted.\nEmail.\nMost email providers have an anti-spam feature that essentially blacklists certain email addresses if they are thought to be spam or malicious. For example, a user who gets of a lot of emails from a particular address, they may blacklist that address, and the email client will automatically route all messages from that address to a junk-mail folder or delete them without telling the user.\nAn e-mail spam filter may keep a blacklist of email addresses, any mail from which would be prevented from reaching its intended destination. It may also use sending domain names or sending IP addresses to implement a more general block.\nIn addition to private email blacklists, there are lists that are kept for public use, including:\nWeb browsing.\nThe goal of a blacklist in a web browser is to prevent the user from visiting a malicious or deceitful web page via filtering. A common web browsing blacklist is Google's Safe Browsing, which is installed by default in Firefox, Safari, and Chrome.\nUsernames and passwords.\nBlacklisting can also apply to user information. It is usual for systems or websites to blacklist certain usernames that aren't allowed to be chosen by the system or website's users. These reserved usernames are commonly associated with built-in system administration functions. Also usually blocked by default are profane words and racial slurs, for example, ROBLOX has a feature blocking certain usernames from being used.\nPassword blacklists are very similar to username blacklists but contain more entries than username blacklists. Password blacklists are used to stop users from choosing passwords that are easily guessed or are well known and could lead to unauthorized access by malicious parties. Password blacklists are used as a layer of security, which sets the requirements of the password length and/or character complexity. This is because there are a lot of number password combinations that fulfill many password policies but are still easily guessed (i.e., Password123, Qwerty123)."}

Sixteen formed from a strong tropical disturbance off the eastern shores of Nicaragua on October 13. The disturbance quickly turned into a tropical depression the next day while being very close to the coastline. Because of its close distance towards land, the depression was not able to form strong convection, which was the reason why it did not become stronger. Once off the northern shores of Honduras, the depression became disorganized, but was able to strengthen a little bit, reaching its peak intensity with winds of 35\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h) on the afternoon of October 15. The depression then moved onshore and quickly died out by the next morning.\nA lot of rainfall from the depression started deadly flooding in Central America which left at least 75 people dead and forcing 100,000 people to move, and being responsible for $150 million in damage.\nStorm history.\nOn the afternoon of October 13, a large area of low pressure formed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea, about 160\u00a0mi (160\u00a0km) east-southeast of Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua. The low was found in a place that was good for development and a tropical cyclone formation alert was given out soon after the low formed. The low slowly became better organized and was thought to have turned into a tropical depression the next morning while it was 50\u00a0mi (80\u00a0km) northeast of the Nicaragua/Honduras border. The depression was predicted to move across from the coastline, and later move to the west when it was north of Honduras, and by then make landfall in Belize as a tropical storm with winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h) on October 18.\nBut the convection that was associated with the depression went away and the whole structure of the storm started to get worse. The depression stayed disorganized during the morning, in spite of curved banding traits forming, they stayed far from the center of circulation. In the late afternoon, the depression mooved onto the northern coastline of Honduras with winds still at 30\u00a0mph (45\u00a0km/h). Even though being over land and still being disorganized, the depression became a little bit more strong enough to reach its peak intensity of 35\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h) on the afternoon of October 15. This happened because of a mistake of a QuikSCAT satellite pass a ship, with the code H3VR, reporting 38\u00a0mph (61\u00a0km/h) sustained winds, and a buoy report. However, the winds were actually though to have been weaker than what was said because of the ridge of high pressure that was over the southern United States. The final advisory on the depression was given out the next morning as it turned back into a remnant low.\nPreparations and impact.\nThe National Hurricane Center gave out a lot of tropical storm watches while the storm was still alive, while in Costa Rica a red alert warning was put into effect across much of the country, and more than 100,000 people were told to move to safer places. Because the depression never became a tropical storm, tropical storm-conditions were not felt in the watch areas.\nHeavy rains from the depression's remnant low left at least 16 people dead and six missing and forced 100,000 other people from their homes across Central America. The depression destroyed bridges, flooded villages and blocked roads. Total damage is thought to be at about $150 million (2008 USD)."}

It was discovered on November 14, 2003 by Mike Brown, Chad Trujillo and David Rabinowitz. Around 1250-1800 km in diameter, Sedna takes roughly 10,500 years to orbit the Sun, much higher than most known trans-Neptunian objects. It is one of the most distant known objects in the Solar System. Therefore, Sedna's surface temperature never rises above -240\u00b0C. \nThe name \"Sedna\" comes from the Inuit goddess of the sea, thought to live at the bottom of the Arctic Ocean.\nNASA is not currently planning any space missions to explore Sedna, but there is some talk of missions to happen when Sedna reaches perihelion again. It is considered to be a likely candidate as a dwarf planet.\nNo pictures can be taken of Sedna because very little light from the Sun reaches it. For this reason, Sedna is known as \"Cobian\", meaning shadows in Ancient Greek. Due to its orbit, the chances of Sedna being found were 0.017%. 40-120 more objects this size should exist without us knowing, but, as they are so small and far away, they may not be discovered for a while."}

The snake is found in Central and South America, and on some islands in the Caribbean. The common name is the same as the scientific name, which is unusual. The color pattern of its skin can vary considerably. Boa constrictors grow to a large size. There are ten subspecies.\"\nDescription.\nThe size adult animals reach varies among subspecies. The largest animals have been found in Northern south America. Two animals from Suriname are currently the largest on record: One reached 411cm (13.5 ft), the other 427cm (a bit over 14 ft). Such sizes are rare, boas reaching 3m are considered large. There is a report of a boa reaching 5.6m in Trinidad, but it is believed that snake was an anaconda,\"Eunectes murinus\", taken for a boa.\nBoas can use their tail to grasp things. Boas do not have organs that react to warmth around the mouth.\nBoas have a color pattern that is brownish, and becomes brick red around the tail. Dorsally, the ground color is overlaid with a series of large tan-colored saddles that become lighter towards the tail. Here, the saddles break up into half rings of a pale cream color in vivid contrast with the red.\nCommon names.\nAll boids are constrictors, that is, they kill by squeezing their prey to suffocation. This species is a rare instance of an animal having the same common and scientific binomial name.\nAll subspecies are referred to as \"boa constrictors\". \n\"B. c. constrictor\" is also called the \"common boa.\"\nOther common names include \"jib\u00f3ia\" (Brazil) and \"macajuel\" (Trinidadian, pronounced \"mah-cah-well\").\nBiology.\nRange.\nFound from northern Mexico through Central America (Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama) to South America north of 35\u00b0S (Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, Brazil, Bolivia, Uruguay and Argentina. Also in the Lesser Antilles (Dominica and St. Lucia), on San Andr\u00e9s, Providencia and many other islands along the coasts of Mexico and Central and South America.\nHabitat.\nFlourishes in a wide variety of environmental conditions, from tropical rainforests to arid country.\nBehavior.\nSmall individuals may climb into trees and shrubs to forage, but they become mostly terrestrial as they become older and heavier. It is said that specimens from Central America are more irascible, hissing loudly and striking repeatedly when disturbed, while those from South America tame down more readily.\nFeeding.\nPrey includes a wide variety of mammals and birds. Their diet mostly consists of rodents, but larger lizards and mammals as big as ocelots are also reported to have been consumed.\nReproduction.\nOvoviviparous, females give birth to live young that average 15-20 inches (38\u201351\u00a0cm) in length.\nCaptivity.\nThis species does well in captivity, usually becoming quite tame. It is a common sight in zoos. Captive longevity is 20 to 30 years, with rare accounts of over 40 years, making them a long-term commitment as a pet. Proper animal husbandry is the most significant factor in captive lifespan. Though still exported from their native South America in significant numbers, it is widely bred in captivity."}

The appendix is near the junction of the small intestine and the large intestine. The term \"vermiform\" comes from Latin and means \"worm-like in appearance\". Its length is approximately 4 to 6 centimetres.\nThe appendix has no apparent function in humans, but it can get inflamed and cause diseases (like appendicitis). In us, it is a vestigial organ. It is assumed the appendix may act as a storage for beneficial (\"good\") gut bacteria which aid us on digesting difficult food and fighting germs.\nDarwin suggested that the appendix was perhaps used to digest leaves as primates. Over time, humans have eaten fewer vegetables and have evolved. Over thousands of years, this organ has become smaller to make room for the stomach. It is a vestigial organ which has degraded to nearly nothing in the course of evolution.\nHerbivorous mammals such as the Koala have large appendices, and usually other adaptations as well. Cellulose, from plant cell walls, is hard to break down. The cecum of the koala is attached to the juncture of the small and large intestines as it is in humans, but is very long. This enables it to host bacteria specific for cellulose breakdown.\nEarly man\u2019s ancestor may have also relied upon this system and lived on a diet rich in foliage. As man began to eat foods easier to digest, they became less reliant on cellulose-rich plants for energy.\nReservoir of gut flora.\nRecent work shows the appendix is a safe place for useful bacteria when illness flushes those bacteria from the rest of the intestines. This proposal is based on a new understanding of how the immune system supports the growth of beneficial gut flora, in combination with many well-known features of the appendix, including its architecture, its location just below the normal one-way flow of food and germs in the large intestine, and its association with copious amounts of immune tissue. Research performed at Winthrop University-Hospital showed that individuals without an appendix were four times more likely to have a recurrence of \"Clostridium difficile\" colitis. The appendix, therefore, may act as a \"safe house\" for commensal (\"good\") bacteria. This reservoir of gut flora could then serve to repopulate the digestive system following a bout of dysentery or cholera."}

They can be found in the Amazon River and to the people who live there, they are the most feared fish in its waters, even over the piranha. They are eel-shaped and translucent, making them very difficult to see in the water. Some species have been known to grow to a size of 6\u00a0inches (~15\u00a0cm) in length.\nThe area that has the most of these fish is at the section between the Amazon River and the Rio Negro, near Brazil's inland city of Manaus.\nParasitism and food.\nCandiru are parasites. Their ability to find breath currents in the water allows them to swim into the gill openings of other aquatic species, where they feed on their prey's blood.\nWhile the fish in the subfamily Vandelliinae feed on blood, fish in Stegophilinae may feed on scales, mucus, or carrion.\nTo hunt for its prey, the Candir\u00fa lies at the bottom of the river testing and sniffing the water for certain chemicals, such as urea and ammonia from the gills of other fish. Once they have found a fish nearby they rush with a burst of speed to the gill cavity and attaches itself with its spines. Then, it begins to gnaw a hole towards a major blood vessel and stuffs itself for no more than a few minutes, which usually causes the victim to die. It will then release itself and sink back to the river bed in order to digest its food and wait for its next meal. \nAttacks on people.\nThese smaller species are known for being thought to invade and make use of a person's urethra. Even with reports as old as the 1800s, the first written case of the removal of a candiru from a person did not occur until 1997, and even that incident is not believed by everyone. The idea that the fish are attracted by urine appears to be not right. The fish actually hunt by sight and do not like urine at all."}

{"id": "158508", "revid": "979836", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=158508", "title": "Slide rule", "text": "The slide rule, or \"slipstick\", is a mechanical analog computer. The slide rule is used mainly for multiplication and division, and also for \"scientific\" functions such as roots, logarithms and trigonometry, but usually not for addition or subtraction.\nThere are many different styles of slide rules. They are usually linear or circular. They have a standardised set of markings or scales. These scales are used for mathematical computations. Some slide rules have been made for special use, as for aviation or finance. Those slide rules have special scales for those applications, as well as normal scales.\nThe slide rule is based on the work on logarithms by John Napier and was invented by William Oughtred. Before electronic calculators were developed, slide rules were the tool used most often in science and engineering. The use of slide rules continued to grow through the 1950s and 1960s even as digital computing devices were gradually introduced; but around 1974 the pocket calculator made the slide rule largely obsolete and most suppliers left the business.\nBasic concepts.\nIn its most basic form, the slide rule uses two logarithmic scales to allow rapid multiplication and division of numbers. These common operations can be time-consuming and error-prone when done on paper. More complex slide rules allow other calculations, such as square roots, exponentials, logarithms, and trigonometric functions.\nMathematical calculations are done by aligning a mark on the sliding central strip with one on one of the fixed strips. \nThe relative position of other marks can then be observed. Numbers aligned with the marks give the approximate value of the product, quotient, or other calculated result.\nThe user determines the location of the decimal point in the result, based on mental estimation. Scientific notation is used to track the decimal point in more formal calculations. Addition and subtraction steps in a calculation are generally done mentally or on paper, not on the slide rule.\nMost slide rules have three linear strips of the same length. The strips are aligned in parallel and interlocked so that the central strip can be moved lengthwise relative to the other two. The outer two strips are fixed so that their relative positions do not change.\nSome slide rules (\"duplex\" models) have scales on both sides of the rule and slide strip, others on one side of the outer strips and both sides of the slide strip, still others on one side only (\"simplex\" rules). A sliding cursor with a vertical alignment line is used to find corresponding points on scales that are not next to each other or, in duplex models, are on the other side of the rule. The cursor can also record an intermediate result on any of the scales.\nUsing a slide rule for calculation.\nMultiplication.\nA logarithm transforms the operations of multiplication and division to addition and subtraction according to the rules formula_1 and formula_2. \nMoving the top scale to the right by a distance of formula_3, by matching the beginning of the top scale with the label formula_4 on the bottom, aligns each number formula_5, at position formula_6 on the top scale, with the number at position formula_7 on the bottom scale. Because formula_8, this position on the bottom scale gives formula_9, the product of formula_4 and formula_5. For example, to calculate 3*2, the 1 on the top scale is moved to the 2 on the bottom scale. The answer, 6, is read off the bottom scale where 3 is on the top scale. In general, the 1 on the top is moved to a factor on the bottom, and the answer is read off the bottom where the other factor is on the top.\nOperations may go \"off the scale;\" for example, the diagram above shows that the slide rule has not positioned the 7 on the upper scale above any number on the lower scale, so it does not give any answer for 2\u00d77. In such cases, the user may slide the upper scale to the left until its right index aligns with the 2, effectively multiplying by 0.2 instead of by 2, as in the illustration below:\nHere the user of the slide rule must remember to adjust the decimal point appropriately to correct the final answer. We wanted to find 2\u00d77, but instead we calculated 0.2\u00d77=1.4. So the true answer is not 1.4 but 14. Resetting the slide is not the only way to handle multiplications that would result in off-scale results, such as 2\u00d77; some other methods are:\nMethod 1 is easy to understand, but entails a loss of precision. Method 3 has the advantage that it only involves two scales.\nDivision.\nThe illustration below demonstrates the computation of 5.5/2. The 2 on the top scale is placed over the 5.5 on the bottom scale. The 1 on the top scale lies above the quotient, 2.75. There is more than one method for doing division, but the method presented here has the advantage that the final result cannot be off-scale, because one has a choice of using the 1 at either end.\nOther operations.\nIn addition to the logarithmic scales, some slide rules have other mathematical functions encoded on other auxiliary scales. The most popular were trigonometric, usually sine and tangent, common logarithm (log) (for taking the log of a value on a multiplier scale), natural logarithm (ln) and exponential (\"ex\") scales. Some rules include a Pythagorean scale, to figure sides of triangles, and a scale to figure circles. Others feature scales for calculating hyperbolic functions. On linear rules, the scales and their labeling are highly standardized, with variation usually occurring only in terms of which scales are included and in what order:\nThe Binary Slide Rule manufactured by Gilson in 1931 performed an addition and subtraction function limited to fractions.\nRoots and powers.\nThere are single-decade (C and D), double-decade (A and B), and triple-decade (K) scales. To compute formula_12, for example, locate x on the D scale and read its square on the A scale. Inverting this process allows square roots to be found, and similarly for the powers 3, 1/3, 2/3, and 3/2. Care must be taken when the base, x, is found in more than one place on its scale. For instance, there are two nines on the A scale; to find the square root of nine, use the first one; the second one gives the square root of 90.\nFor formula_13 problems, use the LL scales. When several LL scales are present, use the one with x on it. First, align the leftmost 1 on the C scale with x on the LL scale. Then, find y on the C scale and go down to the LL scale with x on it. That scale will indicate the answer. If y is \"off the scale,\" locate formula_14 and square it using the A and B scales as described above.\nTrigonometry.\nThe S, T, and ST scales are used for trigonometric functions and multiples of trig functions, for angles in degrees. Many slide rules have their S, T, and ST scales marked with degrees and minutes. So-called \"decitrig\" models use decimal fractions of degrees instead.\nLogarithms and exponentials.\nBase-10 logarithms and exponentials are found using the L scale, which is linear. Some slide rules have a Ln scale, which is for base e.\nThe Ln scale was invented by an 11th grade student, Stephen B. Cohen, in 1958. The original intent was to allow the user to select an exponent \"x\" (in the range 0 to 2.3) on the Ln scale and read e\"x\" on the C (or D) scale and e\u2013\"x\" on the CI (or DI) scale. Pickett, Inc. was given exclusive rights to the scale. Later, the inventor created a set of \"marks\" on the Ln scale to extend the range beyond the 2.3 limit, but Pickett never incorporated these marks on any of its slide rules.\nAddition and subtraction.\nSlide rules are not typically used for addition and subtraction, but it is nevertheless possible to do so using two different techniques.\nThe first method to perform addition and subtraction on the C and D (or any comparable scales) requires converting the problem into one of division. For addition, the quotient of the two variables plus one times the divisor equals their sum:\nFor subtraction, the quotient of the two variables minus one times the divisor equals their difference:\nThis method is similar to the addition/subtraction technique used for high-speed electronic circuits with the logarithmic number system in specialized computer applications like the Gravity Pipe (GRAPE) supercomputer and hidden Markov models.\nThe second method uses a sliding linear L scale available on some models. Addition and subtraction are performed by sliding the cursor left (for subtraction) or right (for addition) then returning the slide to 0 to read the result.\nPhysical design.\nStandard linear rules.\nThe length of the slide rule is quoted in terms of the nominal length of the scales. Scales on the most common \"10-inch\" models are actually 25\u00a0cm in length, as they were made to metric standards, though some rules offer slightly extended scales to simplify manipulation when a result overflowed. Pocket rules are typically 5\u00a0inches. Models a couple of meters long were sold to be hung in classrooms for teaching purposes. \nTypically the divisions mark a scale to a precision of two significant figures, and the user estimates the third figure. Some high-end slide rules have magnifying cursors that make the markings easier to see. Such cursors can effectively double the accuracy of readings, permitting a 10-inch slide rule to serve as well as a 20-inch.\nVarious other conveniences have been developed. Trigonometric scales are sometimes dual-labeled, in black and red, with complementary angles, the so-called \"Darmstadt\" style. Duplex slide rules often duplicate some of the scales on the back. Scales are often \"split\" to get higher accuracy.\nSpecialized slide rules were invented for various forms of engineering, business and banking. These often had common calculations directly expressed as special scales, for example loan calculations, optimal purchase quantities, or particular engineering equations. For example, the Fisher Controls company distributed a customized slide rule adapted to solving the equations used for selecting the proper size of industrial flow control valves.\nCircular slide rules.\nCircular slide rules come in two basic types, one with two cursors (left), and another with a movable disk and a single cursor (right). The dual cursor versions perform multiplication and division by maintaining a fixed angle between the cursors as they are rotated around the dial. The single cursor version operates more like the standard slide rule through the appropriate alignment of the scales.\nThe basic advantage of a circular slide rule is that the longest dimension of the tool was reduced by a factor of about 3 (i.e. by \u03c0). For example, the outer scale of a 10\u00a0cm circular would have a maximum precision equal to a 30\u00a0cm ordinary slide rule. Circular slide rules also eliminate \"off-scale\" calculations, because the scales were designed to \"wrap around\"; they never have to be re-oriented when results are near 1.0\u2014the rule is always on scale. However, for non-cyclical non-spiral scales such as S, T, and LL's, the scale length is shortened to make room for end margins.\nCircular slide rules are mechanically more rugged and smoother-moving, but their scale alignment precision is sensitive to the centering of a central pivot; a minute 0.1\u00a0mm off-centre of the pivot can result in a 0.2\u00a0mm worst case alignment error. The pivot, however, does prevent scratching of the face and cursors. The highest accuracy scales are placed on the outer rings. Rather than \"split\" scales, high-end circular rules use spiral scales for more complex operations like log-of-log scales. One eight-inch premium circular rule had a 50-inch spiral log-log scale.\nThe main disadvantages of circular slide rules are the difficulty in locating figures along a rotating disc, and limited number of scales. Another drawback of circular slide rules is that less-important scales are closer to the center, and have lower precisions. Most students learned slide rule use on the linear slide rules, and did not find reason to switch.\nOne slide rule remaining in daily use around the world is the E6B. This is a circular slide rule first created in the 1930s for aircraft pilots to help with dead reckoning. With the aid of scales printed on the frame it also helps with such miscellaneous tasks as converting time, distance, speed, and temperature values, compass errors, and calculating fuel use. The so-called \"prayer wheel\" is still available in flight shops, and remains widely used. While GPS has reduced the use of dead reckoning for aerial navigation, and handheld calculators have taken over many of its functions, the E6B remains widely used as a primary or backup device and the majority of flight schools demand that their students have some degree of its mastery.\nIn 1952, Swiss watch company Breitling introduced a pilot's wristwatch with an integrated circular slide rule specialized for flight calculations: the Breitling Navitimer. The Navitimer circular rule, referred to by Breitling as a \"navigation computer\", featured airspeed, rate/time of climb/descent, flight time, distance, and fuel consumption functions, as well as kilometer\u2013nautical mile and gallon\u2013liter fuel amount conversion functions.\nMaterials.\nTraditionally slide rules were made out of hard wood such as mahogany or boxwood with cursors of glass and metal. At least one high precision instrument was made of steel.\nIn 1895, a Japanese firm, Hemmi, started to make slide rules from bamboo, which had the advantages of being dimensionally stable, strong and naturally self-lubricating. These bamboo slide rules were introduced in Sweden in September, 1933 , and probably only a little earlier in Germany. Scales were made of celluloid or plastic. Later slide rules were made of plastic, or aluminum painted with plastic. Later cursors were acrylics or polycarbonates sliding on Teflon bearings.\nAll premium slide rules had numbers and scales engraved, and then filled with paint or other resin. Painted or imprinted slide rules were viewed as inferior because the markings could wear off. Nevertheless, Pickett, probably America's most successful slide rule company, made all printed scales. Premium slide rules included clever catches so the rule would not fall apart by accident, and bumpers to protect the scales and cursor from rubbing on tabletops. The recommended cleaning method for engraved markings is to scrub lightly with steel-wool. For painted slide rules, and the faint of heart, use diluted commercial window-cleaning fluid and a soft cloth.\nHistory.\nThe slide rule was invented around 1620\u20131630, shortly after John Napier's publication of the concept of the logarithm. Edmund Gunter of Oxford developed a calculating device with a single logarithmic scale, which, with additional measuring tools, could be used to multiply and divide. The first description of this scale was published in Paris in 1624 by Edmund Wingate (c. 1593 \u2013 1656), an English mathematician, in a book entitled \"\u201cL'usage de la reigle de proportion en l'arithmetique &amp; geometrie\u201d.\" The book contains a double scale on one side of which is a logarithmic scale and on the other a tabular scale. In 1630, William Oughtred of Cambridge invented a circular slide rule, and in 1632 he combined two Gunter rules, held together with the hands, to make a device that is recognizably the modern slide rule. Like his contemporary at Cambridge, Isaac Newton, Oughtred taught his ideas privately to his students, but delayed in publishing them, and like Newton, he became involved in a vitriolic controversy over priority, with his one-time student Richard Delamain and the prior claims of Wingate. Oughtred's ideas were only made public in publications of his student William Forster in 1632 and 1653.\nIn 1677, Henry Coggeshall created a two-foot folding rule for timber measure, called the Coggeshall slide rule. His design and uses for the tool gave the slide rule purpose outside of mathematical inquiry.\nIn 1722, Warner introduced the two- and three-decade scales, and in 1755 Everard included an inverted scale; a slide rule containing all of these scales is usually known as a \"polyphase\" rule.\nIn 1815, Peter Roget invented the log log slide rule, which included a scale displaying the logarithm of the logarithm. This allowed the user to directly perform calculations involving roots and exponents. This was especially useful for fractional powers.\nModern form.\nThe more modern form was created in 1859 by French artillery lieutenant Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Mannheim, \"who was fortunate in having his rule made by a firm of national reputation and in having it adopted by the French Artillery.\" It was around that time, as engineering became a recognized professional activity, that slide rules came into wide use in Europe. They did not become common in the United States until 1881, when Edwin Thacher introduced a cylindrical rule there. The duplex rule was invented by William Cox in 1891, and was produced by Keuffel and Esser Co. of New York.\nAstronomical work also required fine computations, and in 19th century Germany a steel slide rule about 2 meters long was used at one observatory. It had a microscope attached, giving it accuracy to six decimal places.\nIn World War II, bombardiers and navigators who required quick calculations often used specialized slide rules. One office of the U.S. Navy actually designed a generic slide rule \"chassis\" with an aluminum body and plastic cursor into which celluloid cards (printed on both sides) could be placed for special calculations. The process was invented to calculate range, fuel use and altitude for aircraft, and then adapted to many other purposes.\nThroughout the 1950s and 1960s the slide rule was the symbol of the engineer's profession (in the same way that the stethoscope symbolizes the medical profession). German rocket scientist Wernher von Braun brought two 1930s vintage \"Nestler\" slide rules with him when he moved to the U.S. after World War II to work on the American space program. Throughout his life he never used any other pocket calculating devices; slide rules served him perfectly well for making quick estimates of rocket design parameters and other figures. Aluminum Pickett-brand slide rules were carried on five Apollo space missions, including to the moon, according to advertising on Pickett's N600 slide rule boxes .\nSome engineering students and engineers carried ten-inch slide rules in belt holsters, and even into the mid 1970s this was a common sight on campuses. Students also might keep a ten-or twenty-inch rule for precision work at home or the office while carrying a five-inch pocket slide rule around with them.\nIn 2004, education researchers David B. Sher and Dean C. Nataro conceived a new type of slide rule based on \"prosthaphaeresis\", an algorithm for rapidly computing products that predates logarithms. There has been little practical interest in constructing one beyond the initial prototype, however. \nDecline.\nThe importance of the slide rule began to diminish as electronic computers, a new but very scarce resource in the 1950s, became widely available to technical workers during the 1960s. The introduction of Fortran in 1957 made computers practical for solving modest size mathematical problems. IBM introduced a series of more affordable computers, the IBM 650 (1954), IBM 1620 (1959), IBM 1130 (1965) addressed to the science and engineering market. John Kemeny's BASIC programming language (1964) made it easy for students to use computers. The DEC PDP-8 minicomputer was introduced in 1965.\nComputers also changed the nature of calculation. With slide rules, there was a great emphasis on working the algebra to get expressions into the most computable form. Users of slide rules would simply approximate or drop small terms to simplify the calculation. Fortran allowed complicated formulas to be typed in from textbooks without the effort of reformulation. Numerical integration was often easier than trying to find closed form solutions for difficult problems. The young engineer asking for computer time to solve a problem that could have been done by a few swipes on the slide rule became a humorous clich\u00e9. Many computer centers had a framed slide rule hung on a wall with the note \"In case of emergency, break glass.\"\nAnother step toward the replacement of slide rules with electronics was the development of electronic calculators for scientific and engineering use. The first included the Wang Laboratories LOCI-2, introduced in 1965, which used logarithms for multiplication and division and the Hewlett-Packard HP-9100, introduced in 1968. The HP-9100 had trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan) in addition to exponentials and logarithms. It used the CORDIC (coordinate rotation digital computer) algorithm, which allows for calculation of trigonometric functions using only shift and add operations. This method facilitated the development of ever smaller scientific calculators.\nThe last nail in the coffin for the slide rule was the launch of pocket-sized scientific calculators, of which the 1972 Hewlett-Packard HP-35 was the first. Such calculators became known as \"slide rule\" calculators since they could perform most or all of the functions on a slide rule. At several hundred dollars, even this was considered expensive for most students. While professional slide rules could also be quite expensive, drug stores often sold basic plastic models for under $20 USD. But by 1975, basic four-function electronic calculators could be purchased for under $50. By 1976 the TI-30 offered a scientific calculator for under $25. After this time, the market for slide rules dried up quickly as small scientific calculators became affordable.\nAdvantages.\nOne advantage of using a slide rule together with an electronic calculator is that an important calculation can be checked by doing it on both; because the two instruments are so different, there is little chance of making the same mistake twice.\nOther websites.\nGeneral information, history:\nHow-to's:"}

The book was number two on the Modern Library Association's list of \"100 Best Novels of the 20th Century.\" \"Time Magazine\" put the book in its \"TIME 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005\". A 1989 study found that 54% of high schools surveyed taught \"The Great Gatsby\" in their English classes.\nThe story is told by Nick Carraway, a man who moves to Long Island, New York, from the Midwest. Nick is not rich, but he lives in a rich area that has two towns called East Egg and West Egg. The \"old rich\" live in East Egg while the \"new rich\" live in West Egg. Nick lives in a small house in West Egg. Nick's next-door neighbor is Jay Gatsby. Jay is in love with Nick's cousin Daisy. However, Daisy is married to a man named Tom. The novel is about Jay and his hope that he can steal Daisy from Tom.\nSynopsis.\nThe events of the novel happen in the summer of 1922. Nick Carraway, a man who grew up in the American Midwest, is the narrator. Nick is a World War I veteran and a Yale University graduate who wants a more exciting life. He moves to New York, to be a bonds salesman. There, he rents a house in the small community of West Egg. The person living next to him is Jay Gatsby, a mysterious man who also has a lot of money. Jay Gatsby also hosts many expensive parties frequently. Strangely, he never participates in his own parties; because of this, many rumors are formed as to Gatsby's true identity and background. Nick drives out to visit his cousin Daisy in East Egg. There, he meets her husband, Tom Buchanan. He is also introduced to her friend, Jordan Baker. Nick learns from her that Tom has been having an affair with Myrtle Wilson. Nick decides to hold his judgment.\nLater in the summer, Nick is invited to one of Gatsby's parties. There, he meets Gatsby himself, a young and charming man. Nick learns that Gatsby was once in a romantic relationship with Daisy, many years ago. Gatsby is still in love with her, and spends many nights looking at the green light from Daisy's dock across his mansion. He is hoping that he could impress Daisy with his rich lifestyle and wild parties. Gatsby grew up very poor and with little opportunity to move up in the world, and this motivated him to pursue wealth to reinvent himself and become worthy of being with Daisy. Gatsby asks Nick to arrange for Daisy and him to meet. Nick invites them both over for tea, and they begin to fall in love again. They then start an affair with one another.\nAfter a short time, Tom notices that Daisy and Gatsby are in love. The group meets at a hotel, where Daisy is forced to choose between Gatsby and Tom. She chooses Tom, and the group begins to drive home. Along the way, Daisy, driving Gatsby's car, accidentally hits and kills Myrtle. Gatsby tells Nick that he will take the blame in order to save Daisy. Later, he is then shot dead by Myrtle's husband, George, believing that Gatsby was the one responsible. George then kills himself.\nNick holds a funeral for Gatsby, but very few people show up despite Gatsby having been famous. Angry and sad about everything that has happened, Nick decides to leave New York to move back to the Midwest."}

It is produced in the liver, where ammonia, a very toxic substance, is changed into urea, which has a very low toxicity, so low in fact, that it is many times less toxic than table salt. Most of the urea produced in this way is not needed by the body, and is removed from the blood in the kidneys and taken out of the body in urine."}

It is made by many living things as a kind of biological lubricant. It plays the role in living things which oil plays in machines. \nMucus is mainly composed of polysaccharides, which are long-chain carbohydrates. These molecules are stiff when dry, and sticky and slippery when wet. They are present in all types of organisms from bacteria to humans. \nIn vertebrates mucus is made by mucous membranes. Mucus may have antiseptic enzymes (such as lysozymes) and immunoglobulins (antigens). A major function of this mucus is to protect against infection by fungi, bacteria and viruses. \nMucus protects epithelial cells in the lungs, gut, genital, visual, and auditory systems in mammals; the epidermis in amphibians; and the gills in fish. Snails, slugs, hagfish, and certain invertebrates also produce external mucus. As well as a protective function, slime helps movement and plays a role in communication. \nMucus is produced in many parts of the body. All the alimentary canal, nose, and sexual organs have mucus glands which pass the mucus to the surfaces. The surfaces are mostly internal surfaces, though in some animals mucus covers the outside of the animal. Slugs are an example of this. Mucus glands are exocrine glands, so they pass their mucus to the surface along ducts.\nAlkaline mucus.\nIn the human digestive system, mucus is used as a lubricant for materials that must pass over membranes, such as food passing down the oesophagus. \nA layer of mucus along the inner walls of the stomach is vital to protect the cell linings from the highly acidic environment inside the stomach. Mucus is not digested in the intestinal tract. \nAlkaline mucus is also found in other places, such as eyes, saliva and cervix."}

It is in the family Saturniidae. The luna moth is thought to be North America's most beautiful insect.\nDescription.\nThe luna moth has a wingspan of 7.5 to 10.5\u00a0cm. The wings are lime-green. The bottom wings have long tails. There is a clear spot on each wing. There is a reddish-brown border on the top edge of the top wing. Some individuals have pinkish borders on the outer edge of both wings. Other individuals have yellowish borders instead. Adult Luna Moths have no mouth at all, rendering them completely harmless. They live by the fat they stored up at the larval stage. Because of this, they only live for about one week.\nDistribution.\nThe luna moth is found in North America. It is found from Nova Scotia, west to North Dakota, south to Texas, and east to Florida.\nThe luna moth is found in habitats such as woodlands and forests.\nFlight period.\nThe luna moth is seen from May to July in the northern part of its range. It is seen from March to September in the southern part of its range.\nLife cycle.\nThe luna moth's eggs are brown. The caterpillar is green. It has bright red spots on its body. There are two yellow stripes that run down each side of the body. The caterpillar will grow to 6.5\u00a0cm long. The luna moth caterpillar is similar to the polyphemus moth (\"Antheraea polyphemus\") caterpillar. The polyphemus moth caterpillar does not have the yellow stripes on its body. The luna moth's cocoon is made of dead leaves on the ground. It overwinters (spends the winter) as a cocoon. The luna moth has one brood (a brood is a group of offspring) each year in the northern part of its range. It has three broods each year in the southern part of its range.\nFood plants.\nThe caterpillars feed on the following host plants:"}

They first lived in Syria. They are also known as golden hamsters because the first ones kept as pets were gold coloured. Now there are over 100 different colours because of selective breeding. Little is known about their life in the wild. They are kept as pets in many countries including the United States, Canada most countries in Europe and many more.\nAnatomy.\nA Syrian hamster's anatomy is similar to other rodents. It is very close to other hamsters.\nSkeleton.\nTeeth.\nSyrian hamsters have 16 teeth. There are 4 incisors and 12 molars. There is a space between the incisors and the molars. That space is called the diastema.\nSpine and tail.\nThe spine, like in other animals, is made up of several bones called vertebrae. A Syrian hamster has 43-44 vertebrae. Thirteen to fourteen of them are in the tail.\nLimbs.\nAll hamsters have short legs. Because of this, their legs have small bones which can get broken more easily. Obese hamsters are more likely to have problems with their legs.\nSense organs.\nSyrian hamsters have, like most animals, five senses. They can see, hear, touch, taste and smell. Although they don't see well in daylight, they are not colorblind: Syrian hamsters are nocturnal and can see blue-green colours but not red colours. They use their sense of smell to locate food, and their taste buds function in the same way as human tongues do.\nBreeding.\nNot much is known about Syrian hamster breeding in the wild. They have been bred well in captivity (i.e. in labs, by breeders and when kept as pets). People have learned a lot about their breeding. Breeding in captivity is probably the same as in the wild.\nSyrian hamsters are believed to have the shortest gestation period of any animal. Their gestation is 16 days.\nThey also have a short ovulation period. Syrian hamsters come into heat once every 4 days for about 1-2 hours."}

The storm formed in early October from a tropical wave with a nearby low pressure area. The wave moved west-northwest with a small amount of convection, before being completely organized enough to become a tropical depression while west of the Cape Verde Islands. It became a tropical storm later that same day, and began weakening almost right away thereafter as it moved in to an area of higher vertical wind shear. The storm finally died out early on October 15. Nana did not have an effect on any land areas or ships.\nStorm history.\nA tropical wave moved west, awat from the western coast of Africa on October 6. This wave continued moving west with just a little bit of convection until October 8, when organized cloud bands began to form around its low-level center. The wave continued moving westward and organizing until it was called a tropical depression early on October 12, west of the Cape Verde Islands. It began moving towards the west-northwest because of a weakness in the subtropical ridge while becoming stronger to its strongest point of . As it did so, it went into an area of strong upper level winds, which began moving the thunderstorm clouds to the east of the center of circulation. Just twelve hours later, it had weakened back into a tropical depression, and by October 14 it had weakened back to just little more than a low-level cloud swirl. It died out early the next day as it combined itself with a powerful front, east-northeast of the Leeward Islands.\nForecasting, impact, naming, and records.\nTropical Storm Nana's formation was expected for a few days before it actually developed. Movement and strength predictions were also better than the long term average. Because of Nana's short life the sample size is not very meaningful. Tropical Storm Nana stayed in the middle of the Atlantic and never came near land. As a result, it had no known impact. No ships reported strong winds that came from the tropical storm."}

Forming on October 30 from a mid-latitude cyclone in the north Pacific mid-latitudes, it moved over waters warmer-than-normal. It got some characteristics more normal for subtropical or even tropical cyclones. However, as it came closer to western North America, it fell apart. Moisture from its remains then caused a lot of rainfall in British Columbia.\nStorm history.\nA cut-off extratropical cyclone over the central north Pacific moved into a place with sea surface temperatures as high as 2\u00a0\u00b0C above normal for two days. By October 31 the system had gotton convection, a warmer-than-normal core, and an eye-like characteristic. During this time it had moved east, then northeast, and then northwest.\nOn November 1, the system had estimated winds of 100\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mph) and its most developed convection. After that, it slowly weakened, moved counter-clockwise, and headed east towards the west coast of North America. On November 2, wind shear started affecting the storm, and all convection was gone by the next day, when it was located roughly 520\u00a0mi (840\u00a0km) off the coast of Oregon.\nThis system's center of circulation passed south of observation buoy 46637 on November 1. The buoy's lowest pressure reading was 989\u00a0mb/hPa. Other buoys indicated that a rather large area of low pressure was associated with the system. Buoy 46637 was not at the system's center of circulation, so it is possible that this system had a lower minimum pressure than was actually measured.\nImpact, preparation, and records.\nAs a result, to the weather system, the American National Weather Service gave out wind watches for the Oregon Coast. The system brought heavy rain to parts of Vancouver Island.\nIf Storm 91C is really a tropical or subtropical cyclone, it has several records. Since right now it is not officially either, its holding these records is also unofficial. Because the storm formed at 36\u00b0N, this system is the northernmost formation in the eastern north Pacific basin. The previous record-holder was Tropical Storm Wene, which formed at 32\u00b0N before crossing the dateline. In addition, this system's track data shows that it crossed from the central to the east Pacific because it formed at longitude 149\u00b0W and dissipated at 135\u00b0W. Only two other known tropical cyclones had done that before.\nNature of the system.\nThis system has been thought to be a tropical, subtropical, or extratropical cyclone.\nMark Guishard, a meteorologist with Bermuda Weather Service, had the opinion that the system had finished tropical cyclogenesis and was a tropical cyclone. Meteorologist Mark Lander thought that cloud tops were similar to several Atlantic hurricanes, Hurricane Vince in example. James Franklin, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center, thought that:\nThe system was of frontal origin... the frontal structure was eventually lost... The convective structure resembled a tropical, rather than subtropical cyclone, and the radius of maximum winds (based on QuikSCAT) was very close to the center, also more typical of tropical cyclones... on balance, it was more tropical than subtropical.\nClark Evans of Florida State University reported that forecasting tools showed that the system's structure was same with that of a subtropical or barely tropical cyclone. NASA, which is not a meteorological agency, thought that the system was a subtropical cyclone.\nIn its review of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season, the Canadian Hurricane Centre said that the storm was to be an extratropical cyclone. Since this system had one-minute sustained winds of 100\u00a0km/h (60\u00a0mi/h), which are above the 60\u00a0km/h (39\u00a0mi/h) boundary between a depression and a storm, it would be able to be a named storm if it was a tropical or subtropical cyclone. However, neither of the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers for the eastern north Pacific, the National Hurricane Center and the Central Pacific Hurricane Centre, include this system in their yearly archives, nor is it included in the official \"best track\" file. So this system is not an official tropical or subtropical cyclone of the 2006 Pacific hurricane season."}

Many local magazines (Screenfun, Gamestar) wrote about this game. At first Vampires Dawn has been made for the computer like all RPG Maker games. After that Marlex developed another game about vampires for mobile phones. Currently an independent company called Clockstone is working on a release of Vampires Dawn for the Nintendo Dual Core.\n\"Velsarbor\" \"by Lachsen\"\nThis is a demonstration of a high level of the technical power of the RPG Maker 2000.

{"id": "159308", "revid": "1025654", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=159308", "title": "Tropical Storm Laura (2008)", "text": "Tropical Storm Laura was the twelfth named storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season. Laura formed out of a large non-tropical low pressure area 1015\u00a0miles (1635\u00a0km) west of the western islands of the Azores on September 29. Laura slowly got tropical characteristics throughout the day as it moved over warmer waters. On the afternoon of September 30, Laura had gotten enough tropical characteristics to be designated as a \"Tropical Storm\". Soon after becoming tropical, Laura began to start an extratropical transition, which did not completely take place until the morning of October 1. Laura became reduced into a post-tropical cyclone later that morning, and the National Hurricane Center gave out its last advisory on the storm.\nMeteorological History.\nIn late September, a large non-tropical system over the north-central Atlantic slowly moved westward away from the Azores. The low produced hurricane-force winds, but did not exhibit the characteristics of a tropical cyclone. The storm steadily weakened over the following days, but developed tropical characteristics as it moved over slightly warmer waters. By September 29, the low had developed sufficient convection and was declared Subtropical Storm Laura. Upon being upgraded, cold cloud tops began to wrap around the center of Laura and consolidate near the center of circulation. The convection organized around the center quickly and a satellite pass over the storm revealed that it could be intensifying. A later satellite pass disregarded the possibility of intensification as the intensity was confirmed to be at 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h).\nThe overall structure of Laura remained subtropical but there were indications that it was acquiring tropical characteristics. During the afternoon, satellites revealed that Laura had developed a deep warm core, a characteristic of a tropical cyclone, but the wind field remained subtropical in nature. By the nighttime hours, the radius of the strongest winds contracted to 80\u00a0mi (130\u00a0km), much smaller than what is typical of a subtropical cyclone. However, Laura was still under the influence of an upper-level low and cloud tops remained shallow. However, the cloud tops became colder overnight and Laura was on the verge of becoming a tropical cyclone by the morning of September 30, but strong interaction with the upper-level low meant it was still subtropical. Despite moving over colder waters, a water vapor satellite image determined that Laura had separated itself from the upper-level low, signifying it had developed into a tropical cyclone. Laura was upgraded to a tropical storm at a relatively high latitude, 41.2\u00b0N.\nNot long after being declared tropical, early signs of an extratropical transition appeared. Cold air began to enter the storm on the west side and forecast models showed Laura becoming extratropical the next morning and non-tropical later the next day. Overnight, convection associated with Laura began to diminish and lose tropical characteristics, but still retained its status. Early on October 1, the extratropical transition was fully apparent. Laura remained tropical but the cloud pattern was becoming frontal and there was little convection around the center of the system. Laura later degenerated into a post-tropical cyclone, a term that had been previously used by the Canadian Hurricane Centre to describe a storm that has lost tropical characteristics, but is not subtropical or extratropical. The transition was forecasted to be complete by the end of the day.\nImpact.\nWhile Laura was a tropical cyclone, it never came near land, so no effects or damages happened and no one died. But, the storm's remains were caught in an upper-level jet stream, and was pushed towards Europe. Heavy rain fell across parts of Britain, creating localized build up of flood waters. Because of that, Glebe Road near Windermere, England was closed in both directions, and along the A65 road between Old Hutton and Kirkby Lonsdale, previously wet soil, as well with overwhelmed storm drains resulted in localized flooding. Traffic on the M6 Motorway was slowed because of bad driving conditions.\nAfter the remains of now extratropical Laura made its final landfall on the southern coast of the Netherlands, its rain clouds started mix with a cold front related to a well-developed low west of Norway, dropping up to 113\u00a0mm (4.5\u00a0in) of precipitation in the northwestern Netherlands, flooding streets and homes in the village of Hippolytushoef. More than 10,000 people lost electricity in southern Norway because of damage to the electrical system created by the remains of the storm."}

Telephone lines only transmit a limited spectrum of signals (roughly 20 Hertz to 20,000 Hertz, for voice). This means that the other frequencies can be used to transmit data. The data is combined or multiplexed onto the telephone line. At both ends, a device called a \"Splitter\" (or DSL filter) separates the data part and the telephony part. DSL provides the physical layer, the lowest layer of the OSI model that is used for understanding how the different parts of a telecommunications network can connect with each other. In this model, ATM or Ethernet are two communications protocols used as the data link layer (layer 2) and IP is used at the network layer (layer 3).\nWhile most DSL signals are multiplexed for transmission onto telephone lines, DSL can also be used without a telephony line (or multiplexed onto something else, for example Cable TV).\nAt the consumer end, a DSL modem converts the signals to be able to travel on the phone line; at the other end, a DSLAM multiplexes or combines the signals onto the internet backbone of the provider.\nMost DSL lines of consumers are asymmetric, meaning that connection speeds or bit rates are different in each direction. Asymmetric DSL is abbreviated as ADSL. \nTypically, the download speed of consumer DSL services ranges from 256 kilobits per second (kbit/s) to 24,000 kbit/s, depending on DSL technology, line conditions and service level implemented. Typically, upload speed is lower than download speed for Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) and equal to download speed for the rarer Symmetric Digital Subscriber Line (SDSL).\nVoice and data.\nDSL (or VDSL, Very High Bitrate Digital Subscriber Line) typically works by dividing the frequencies used in a single phone line into two primary \"bands\". The ISP data is carried over the high-frequency band (25\u00a0kHz and above) while the voice is carried over the lower-frequency band (4\u00a0kHz and below). The user typically installs a DSL filter on each phone. This removes the high frequencies from the phone line, so that the phone only sends or receives the lower frequencies (the human voice). The DSL modem and the normal telephone equipment can be used on the line at the same time without interference from each other.\nEquipment.\nThe customer end of the connection consists of a DSL modem, also known as a Terminal Adaptor. The modem converts data from the digital signals used by computers into a voltage signal of a suitable frequency range which is then applied to the phone line for transmission back to the service provider. \nIn some DSL variations (for example, High-bit-rate digital subscriber line (HDSL)), the modem is directly connected to the computer via a serial interface, using communication protocols such as RS-232 or V.35. In other cases (particularly ADSL), it is common for the customer equipment to be integrated with other functions, such as routing, firewalling, or other application-specific hardware and software. In this case, the entire equipment is usually referred to as a DSL router or DSL gateway."}

It was directed by Terence Young. The movie is based on the book \"Dr. No\" by Ian Fleming. It starred Sean Connery as James Bond and Joseph Wiseman as Dr. Julius No.\nThis is the first movie in which Connery played Bond. The movie is remembered by many people because of the moment when Ursula Andress walks out of the sea in a white bikini. It is also the first time we here the now famous line \"Bond, James Bond\" as James Bond introduces himself.\nThis movie started the James Bond series of movies which are still being made today.\nPlot.\nThe plot begins in Jamaica, where local English secret agent Strangways and his secretary are killed by three men pretending to be blind beggars, called the \"three blind mice\". MI6 (the English spy agency) sends their best agent, Bond, to find out why Strangways was killed. He travels to Jamaica, but not before romancing the beautiful Sylvia Trech. Whilst in Jamaica, the Three Blind Mice try to kill Bond. First they try shooting at him and then by chasing him in a car. The second time Bond turns the tables by causing their car (a funeral hearse) to fall off a cliff after a very dangerous car chase. Bond jokes (after seeing their car explode at the bottom) that he thinks they were on their way to a funeral. The deadly Miss Taro also tries to romance (then kill) Bond, and almost succeeds, before Bond realises that she is working for the enemy. Determined to find out who the enemy is, Bond discovers that Strangways was doing some research on an island called Crab Key and it's owner, a mysterious Chinese man called Dr. No.\nBond travels to Crab Key with Quarrel (a local fisherman secretly working for MI6) and Felix leiter (an American spy). Felix goes back to Jamaica when they reach the island, and Bond and Quarrel meet a beautiful shell collector called Honey Rider. After a gunfight with Dr. No's men, Quarrel is killed and Bond and Honey are captured. They finally meet Dr. No who explains to them that he works for the evil organisation SPECTRE(SPecial Executive for Counterintelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion) and has been hired to \"topple\" American rockets (making them crash using radio beams). Honey is tied up and sent to be drowned, whereas James is put in a cell with electrified bars. James escapes through the air vents, rescues Honey and murders Dr. No by throwing him into a pool of boiling water. The following chemical reaction wikt:destroys the base and Bond and Honey wikt:escape in a speedboat, just as the base explodes."}

Christianity was legalised through the Roman Empire in 312. According to the early writers, like Socrates Scolaticus, Helena travelled to the Holy Land, founding churches and establishing relief agencies for the poor. She is said to have discovered the resting place of the three crosses used at the crucifixion of Jesus and the two thieves - Dismas and Gestas - who were executed with him. Through a miracle it was revealed which of the three was the \"True Cross\". \nMany churches have fragmentary remains which are by tradition alleged to be those of the \"True Cross.\" Their authenticity is not accepted by all those of the Christian faith. Many Christians question the accuracy of the reports surrounding the discovery of the \"True Cross\". The acceptance and belief of that part of the tradition that pertains to the Early Christian Church is generally restricted to the Catholic and Orthodox Churches. The Medieval legends where it came from are not the same in Catholic and Orthodox tradition. These churches honour Helena as a saint, as does also the Anglican Communion.\nSome Christians believe that wood from the true cross has miraculous healing powers. During the Middle Ages people made pilgrimages to churches and shrines where pieces of the cross were kept, and touched the wood in the hope of being cured of a sickness or infirmity."}

As the development of drives continued, it became apparent that reliability was a problem and systems using RAID technology evolved. This means that more than one physical disks are \"RAID-ed\" together to produce a single logical disk. \nIn a modern home PC environment, disk drives now provide hundreds of gigabytes of storage capacity which can be impractical to use as a single entity. Therefore most systems have their drives partitioned into multiple \"logical drives\".\nIn most modern business IT environments, some form of a Storage area network will exist. Here, many storage devices are connected to many host server devices in a network. A single RAID array may provide some capacity to one server, and some capacity to another.

They are part of the plankton, and there are also pelagic species. The phylum includes the sea gooseberry (\"Pleurobrachia pileus\") and Venus' girdle (\"Cestum veneris\").\nThe phylum was grouped with Cnidaria (jellyfish) in the former Coelenterata phylum. Ctenophores are the most basal known type of animals. \nEven though they look like jellyfish, they are zoologically not related to them. They lack the characteristic nematocysts (stinging cells), but have \"colloblasts\", sticky cells that snare small victims. They have eight rows of cilia which look like the teeth of a comb, hence Ctenophore = comb-bearer. Ctenophores have connective tissues and a nervous\nsystem. There are about 150 described species of ctenophora spread throughout the world's oceans, from shallow estuarine waters to the deep sea. \nAlthough there are a few benthic species, most are gelatinous zooplankton and form a considerable proportion of the entire planktonic biomass worldwide. A few species, such as the sea gooseberry, native to the North Sea, have reached such high populations that they clog fishermen's nets, while of other species only a few examples are known. The fragile makeup of ctenophores makes research into their way of life extremely difficult. For this reason their lifespan is not known, but ctenophores begin to reproduce at an early age.\nColour and light.\nMany planktonic ctenophores produce a rainbow effect, which is not caused by bioluminescence but by \"diffraction\", the scattering of light, as the cilia on the combs beat. Most species are also bioluminescent, but the light is usually blue or green and can only been seen in darkness. However some groups appear incapable of bioluminescence."}

This started a reign which lasted fifteen years \u2013 longer than any man who ruled since Tiberius.\nAs emperor, Domitian strengthened the economy by revaluing the Roman coinage. He expanded the border defenses of the empire, and started a massive building program to restore the damaged city of Rome.\nSignificant wars were fought in Britain, where his general Agricola attempted to conquer Scotland, and in Dacia, where Domitian was unable to win a decisive victory against king Decebalus.\nDomitian's rule was totalitarian. He saw himself as the new Augustus, as an enlightened despot destined to guide the Roman Empire into a new age. Religious, military, and cultural propaganda fostered a cult of personality. By nominating himself perpetual censor, he sought to control public and private morals. As a consequence, Domitian was popular with the people and army but considered a tyrant by members of the Roman Senate.\nDomitian's reign came to an end in 96 when he was assassinated by court officials. The same day, he was succeeded by his advisor Nerva. After his death, Domitian's memory was condemned to oblivion by the Roman Senate, while senatorial authors such as Tacitus, Pliny the Younger and Suetonius published histories showing Domitian as a cruel and paranoid tyrant.\nModern history has rejected these views. Now we see Domitian as a ruthless but efficient autocrat, whose cultural, economic and political program provided the foundation of the peaceful second century."}

It is found in the region Basse-Normandie in the Calvados department in the Northwest of France.\nThe town is famous for its tapestry. It is one of the oldest complete tapestries in the world.\nThe inhabitants are called \"Bajocasses\" ou \"Bayeusains\". Bayeux is a \"sous-pr\u00e9fecture\" of the Calvados department.\nHistory.\nOrigin.\nBayeux is the capital of \"the Bessin\" which was called Bajocasses before. Bessin was a province of France before the French Revolution. The name of the city comes from the Celtic tribe which lived in the Bajocasses region.\nMiddle Ages.\nThe Vikings distroyed the town in 890, but it was rebuilt by Bothon at the beginning of the 10th century. The bishop Hugues II, and his successor, Odon de Conteville (Guillaume le Conqu\u00e9rant's half brother) insisted the town needed a new cathedral. In 1077, a new one was built. However it is around that time that the town lost a lot of influence. Guillaume le Conqu\u00e9rant decided to make Caen his capital, in 1050. The Bayeux Tapestry was made around that time\nThe Renaissance didn't really mark the town. The most notable building from that period is the Saint-Patrice Church. It was built between 1544 and 1548.\nSecond World War.\nBayeux was the first city in France to be liberated after the Battle of Normandy. On 16 June 1944, General Charles de Gaulle made his first major speech in Bayeux. The buildings were not damaged much during the Battle of Normandy as the German forces were defending Caen at the same time.\nThe Bayeux War Cemetery is the largest British cemetery dating from the Second World War in France. There are 4648 graves: 3935 are British and 466 are German.\nGeography.\nLocation.\nBayeux is seven kilometres from the English Channel and the D-Day Landing Beaches. It is about 30 kilometres northwest of Caen. The town's elevation varies from 32 to 67 metres (with an average of 46 metres). The river Aure passes through it.\nClimate.\nThe table below gives the temperatures and precipitation for 2007 (Recorded at the \"station Caen-Carpiquet\") :\nThe table below gives the minimum and maximum temperatures for each month :\nTransport.\nLa Bayeux Train station is on the \"Paris-Saint-Lazare&gt;Cherbourg\" line. The TER line is from Caen to Rennes.\nThe \"Bybus\" goes around the town and to the communes of Saint-Martin-des-Entr\u00e9es and Saint-Vigor-le-Grand. There is one main line (\"Chojnice / St-Martin-des-Entr\u00e9es\") and three minor one's toward the different districts. The \"Bus verts\" invented by the \"Conseil g\u00e9n\u00e9ral\" is a way to get to the surrounding communes (lines 30, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74). 3000 parking spaces in the town center make it an easy place to park. Furthermore, most car parks are free. The \"By-pass\" is Bayeux's ring road. The first part was built after the Battle of Normandy by British soldiers. The roads in the town center were too narrow for the Tanks to get through. The \"By-pass\" used to be the \"Route nationale 13\" until a motorway was built (A13 autoroute).\nThe closest airport is in Caen (21\u00a0km away) and the closest ferry to England (32\u00a0km away) leaves in Ouistreham.\nDemographics.\nBayeux is the fourth biggest town in Calvados by population. The three biggest are Caen, H\u00e9rouville-Saint-Clair and Lisieux."}

The upper-level seats were squeezed in between the lower-level seats to ensure that the overall height of the unit was within the clearances necessary to pass through tunnels and under bridges. The 4DD was somewhat unsuccessful because the upper level compartments were cramped and poorly ventilated (the upper level windows could not be opened due to tight clearance). The compartments were pressure-ventilated but the equipment proved to be troublesome. Also dwell times at stations were increased because of the increased number of passengers per door. To obtain the extra seating capacity that was being sought, it was instead decided to lengthen trains from eight cars to ten."}

{"id": "159694", "revid": "24306", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=159694", "title": "Desiro", "text": "Desiro is the brand name for a design of modular train manufactured by Siemens of Germany.\nThe Desiro can be made as a diesel or electric multiple unit (DMU or EMU). It is normally made as two and three-car trainsets. Although there are many differences between single trains, the basic body design is the same. These trains are mostly used for regional services, and belong to a new generation of light, modular trains which have become common in many European countries. They are sometimes thought as light regional railcars. They are mostly cheap to make and work. Their fast acceleration makes them good for services with short intervals between stations. However, they are sometimes complained by people for their poor passenger comfort.\nAustria.\nIn Austria, the \u00d6BB (Austrian Federal Railways) is right now using about 60 diesel-powered Desiro trains called \"\u00d6BB 5022\". These are based on the Class 642 used by Deutsche Bahn, but have added more safety stuff.\nBulgaria.\nIn 2005 and 2006, in Bulgaria, the Bulgarian State Railways begin working Desiro trains as part of a \u20ac67-million deal with Siemens AG for a total of 25 Diesel multiple units. As of 22 March 2006, 16 trains had been delivered, with many of them working on the Sofia-Kyustendil-Sofia line. Another \u20ac117-million deal for 25 EMUs has also been signed with Siemens AG. The EMUs were fitted out in Varna, where BD\u017d and Siemens AG are thinking about making a joint venture company. The EMUs are classes 30 and 31 and are servicing traffic in the Sofia and Plovdiv areas.\nDenmark.\nIn Denmark, DSB rented 12 Desiro trains since 2002. The train is mostly used between Odense and Svendborg and between Odense and Fredericia. On July 2, 2009 DSB signed a contract of eight trains from Siemens for Grenaabanen for delivery late 2010. Nordjyske Jernbaner used Desiro trains since 2004 on all its working rails. Today the company owns eight Desiro trains.\nGermany.\n Germany's Deutsche Bahn first showed two-car Desiro DMUs for local services in 2000. With a top speed of 120\u00a0km/h, these \"Class 642\" units are mostly used on branch lines and regional lines. Besides the 234 units bought by DB until 2007, many private German rail companies are also using Desiro DMUs.\nThe \"Class 642\" has two MAN diesel engines with an output of 275 or 315\u00a0kW each and hydro-mechanical transmission with retarders. It normally has 100 seats. When linked together with Scharfenberg couplers, up to three trainsets can be worked together. The Desiros are quite popular with most passengers, thanks to their good acceleration. Because they have often replaced push/pull trains, their shorter journey times, such as on the \"M\u00fcglitzbahn\", have made greater passenger numbers.\nAt first, DB was going to work together modern DMUs bought from different makers, but because of software trouble, this proved to be impossible. Therefore the \"Class 642\" can only be mechanically coupled with other DMUs like the \"Class 643\".\nHungary.\nRight now in Hungary, 31 diesel Desiros are in service with M\u00c1V (counting 8 units from Greece), mostly as suburban trains on the secondary line between Budapest-Esztergom and Budapest - Lajosmizse and as an InterCity between Budapest and Baja. On weekends, the units also used as top inter-city trains from Budapest to Baja and S\u00e1toralja\u00fajhely and as fast trains from Budapest to Tapolca. During the summer months (when fewer units are used on the Budapest suburban routes) Desiros appear on some local train diagrams on the norther shore of the Lake Balaton.\nMalaysia.\nThe 57km KLIA Ekspres and KLIA Transit airport rail link uses the Desiro ET 425 M four-car Electric Multiple Units. There are 12 trainsets right now working in Malaysia. \nThese EMUs have a maximum commercial speed of 160\u00a0km/h.\nRomania.\nC\u0103ile Ferate Rom\u00e2ne (CFR), Romania's national railway worker, is one of the largest users of the Siemens Desiro trainsets. CFR, which is right now undergoing modernisation, has bought many Desiro trainsets and uses them for all types of train: \"\"Regio\", \"InterRegio\" and \"InterCity\" inter-city services, but mostly on its \"InterRegio\"\" express trains. There was some criticism of the use of Desiros for CFR's long-distance services because they were thought to be uncomfortable. CFR has recently refitted them, and is now using Desiros mostly on its medium and short-distance routes.\nRussia.\nIn December 2009 Russian Railways ordered 38 Desiros for delivery in 2013 for use during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, with an option for a further 16 which would be mostly made in Russia.\nSlovenia.\nSlovenian Railways works electric Desiro units that are made as DESIRO EMG 312 SR 31E. They are used as commuter stopping trains mostly on connections to and between Ljubljana and Maribor on the following lines:\nSwitzerland.\nSBB-CFF-FFS works double-decker (bilevel cars) EMU's. They are designated as class SBB RABe 514. They are used as commuter trains in Z\u00fcrich, where 61 four-car sets have been working since 2006.\nThailand.\nNine 25 kV AC Desiro UK EMUs based on the Heathrow Connect Class 360/2 will be used for the Suvarnabhumi Airport Link which is right now under running test from the locomotive shop in Asoke to Suvarnabhumi Station under the airport."}

There were many different lords because several different families inherited the title through marriage, until gradually the land of the Beuzeval was sold to farmers. The parish was eventually controlled by Houlgate. On the south side of the river Drochon, between 1845 and 1850, sea bathing attracted summer visitors.\nGeography.\nHoulgate is located along the English Channel in the valley of the Drochon. The valley is mostly built up or used for animal grazing. The town's area is 4.69\u00a0km\u00b2 and the average altitude 5 m.

{"id": "160194", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=160194", "title": "Cuckoo", "text": "The cuckoos are a family of near-passerine birds. They are the main part of the order called Cuculiformes. The family is famous for its \"nest-parasite\" members, but has a range of other types of bird. The cuckoo family, in addition to those species named as such, also includes the roadrunners, koels, malkohas, couas, coucals and anis.\nThe family is notable for its subfamily, the Cuculinae. Many of them have a unique kind of parasitism called brood parasitism. This means it lays its eggs in the nests of other kinds of birds, who then rear the baby cuckoo instead of their own.\nThe brood parasite.\nThe common cuckoo, \"Cuculus canorus\", (usually just called \u201ccuckoo\u201d in countries where it lives) is a spring migrant to Europe and northern Asia. It winters in Africa and southern Asia. It is a greyish bird with a slender body, long tail and strong legs. It looks a little bit like a small bird of prey when it flies. The male is dark grey above with a blackish brown tail, spotted and tipped with white and unevenly barred in black. The female is similar but a bit more reddish on the upper breast. It likes to eat hairy caterpillars. It is often found where woods border on to open land.\nThe cuckoo gets its names because the male Common Cuckoo sings two notes which sound like the word \u201ccu \u2013 ckoo\u201d. The female does not make this sound. She has a loud bubbling call.\nLaying its eggs.\nThe common cuckoo does not make a nest of its own, and they do not bring up their own young. Instead, the female lays her eggs in the nests of other birds. Each female cuckoo specialises in just one host species, and lays camouflaged eggs in that bird's nest. For example, a cuckoo which lays its eggs in reed warbler nests will lay eggs that look like those of a reed warbler.\nThe female cuckoo spends a lot of time watching the birds at the nest where she wants to lay an egg. She has to work out the exact time to go and lay her egg while the 'host' parents are not looking. If the cuckoo lays her egg in the nest before the other bird lays, the reed warbler will notice and knows it is not her egg, and so she will get rid of it. If the cuckoo lays her egg too late, when the reed warbler has finished laying, this will be noticed, too.\nWhen the female cuckoo thinks it is the right moment she will fly down to the reed warblers' nest, pushes one reed warbler egg out of the nest, lays her egg and flies off. This only takes about 10 seconds. The reed warbler does not notice, and carries on looking after the eggs. When the cuckoo chick hatches it soon grows very fast. It pushes the other eggs or reed warbler chicks out of the nest. At 14 days old, it is about 3 times the size of the adult reed warblers. The chick has a huge mouth which it opens very wide. It also makes a very fast \u201ccheeping\u201d sound which sounds like a nest full of reed warbler chicks. This makes the parents behave as if they had a nest full of their own chicks.\nAbout 56 of the Old World and 3 of the New World cuckoo species are brood parasites, laying their eggs in the nests of other birds. These species are obligate brood parasites, meaning that \"they only reproduce in this fashion\". The shells of the eggs of brood-parasites is thick. They have two distinct layers with an outer chalky layer that is believed to provide resistance to cracking when the eggs are dropped in the host nest.\nHost-specific lines.\nFemale parasitic cuckoos specialize and lay eggs which look like the eggs of their chosen host. This has been produced by natural selection, as some birds are able to distinguish cuckoo eggs from their own. This leads to those eggs least like the host's being thrown out of the nest.\nHost species may take direct action to stop cuckoos laying eggs in their nest. Birds whose nests are at high risk of cuckoo-eggs often mob cuckoos and drive them out of the area.\nParasitic cuckoos are grouped into gentes: each gens specializes in a particular host species. This permits each gens to evolve a particular egg colouring. Thus, the species as a whole parasitizes a wide variety of hosts, but \"each line of females specializes in a single host species\".\nGenes regulating egg colour are passed down only along the maternal line, no doubt on the sex chromosome. This allows females to lay mimetic eggs in the nest of their host species.\nFemales are thought to imprint on the host species which raised them; later they only parasitize nests of that species. Male cuckoos fertilize females of all lines, so gene flow takes place between the different maternal lines.\nThe detail and near-perfection of the cuckoo nest parasitism, and the defences of the host birds, are extraordinary. Many of the host species can spot and throw out almost perfect cuckoo eggs. This system is a fine example of an evolutionary arms race, a type of co-evolution. There are other birds which practice nest parasitism (such as the cowbirds) but these other systems are much less specialized.\nMorphs and mimicry.\nThe males and grey females in flight look a bit like a sparrowhawk. That may protect them from other birds' mobbing (Batesian mimicry). The advantage of the rufous-coloured females is not known. It may be that, being less common, they are less recognised by other bird species.\nMigration.\nThe cuckoo only stays in its summer location for about 10 weeks. In Britain, for example, it arrives in April and the adults start for Africa by the end of June or early July.

So, it was very isolated.\nGeography.\nThe village is 1 kilometer from Pont-Farcy. It is along the D307 Road. The village is a collection of farm houses. It also has a church. The total population is just 81. However this probably includes the neighbouring farms as well. Other nearby settlements are Pont-Bellanger and Beaumesnil. The nearest large towns are Villedieu-les-Poeles and Vire.\nThe village is close to the Calvados tourist spot \"Grotte de Bion\"."}

There are several classes of them: 140, 141, 142, 143 and 144. They are diesel multiple unit trains, meaning each carriage has its own diesel engine. Pacers were built as a stopgap because British Rail did not have enough normal trains at the time and could not get new ones quickly enough. They were not supposed to be used for more than 20 years, but it actually took nearly 35 years to replace them.\nMost Pacer trains were put out of use in 2020. Two things finally made this happen. The first is that it is difficult for people with disabilities to climb onto Pacer trains. The Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations require that all public passenger trains must be made easy to use for disabled people by 2020 - but they made an exception for the Pacer trains until the end of 2020. Only one Pacer (the modernised 144e) follows this rule right now. The second is that the Transport Secretary made a decision in 2015 to retire the Pacers by 2020 for the then-new Northern service, arguing that it would be bad for the economy in the north to keep using \"these uncomfortable and low-quality vehicles\".\nAt the start of 2020, 138 Pacer units were still being used or stored by three National Rail operators: Northern Trains, Great Western Railway and Transport for Wales. Northern Trains retired its last Pacer unit on 27 November 2020, and so did Great Western Railway in December 2020. Transport for Wales will still use their Class 143s into the first part of 2021.\nFeatures.\nThe Pacer series were made to keep building and running costs low, so all of the Pacer units use:\nBackground.\nAt the beginning of the 1980s British Rail (BR) needed to make new trains to replace its old first generation diesel multiple units (DMUs) which had been built between the mid-1950s and early-1960s. These old trains had helped replace steam and were popular with the public at the time. But BR did not get much money from the government, so could not get new trains that were just as good as the old ones. BR created two kinds of new second generation trains: the Sprinter series, for use on city and longer-distance services, and the Pacer series as cheap DMUs built using bus parts for short-distance countryside and branch line services. The Pacers were intended as a cheap stopgap solution to the shortage of trains, and were not supposed to be used for more than 20 years. BR set a challenge to several companies to design a cheap, lightweight train similar to railbuses. Since then, 165 Pacer trains (with 340 carriages in total) have been built. By 2015, some of these were over 30 years old.\nThey also tried to sell Pacers by showing them in the USA, Northern Ireland, Belgium, Sweden, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, but no one bought any there. However, Iran bought leftover Class 141 units, for use on suburban lines around Tehran until 2005.\nClass 140.\nThe Pacer series was the outcome of an idea to try using bus parts to create a diesel multiple unit. The first prototype, known as LEV 1, was made by British Rail Research Division and Leyland Motors working together. It used a bus body that was mounted on a modified freight train underframe (HSFV1). In 1980 they also built a two-car prototype class 140 at British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL)'s Derby Litchurch Lane Works.\nClass 141.\nThen they built 20 more two-car units, forming the Class 141 fleet that was used mostly for suburban services in Yorkshire. They could carry 94 passengers in each set of two cars. Their two Leyland TL11 engines gave a total of , making for a top speed of . \nThe 141s were built with Leyland National bus bodies that were so narrow that they could only be fitted with standard bus seats. The later Pacers had widened body panels to allow better seating.\nThe entire class got a technical upgrade in 1988 at the Hunslet-Barclay works in Kilmarnock. \nThe units were withdrawn from British Rail in 1997. Many were sold to Islamic Republic of Iran Railways but have been withdrawn and are left in disused sidings in Iran. A few are preserved at museum sites.\nClass 142.\nThe next and largest Pacer class was the Class 142. This again was built by Leyland and BREL, in 1985. The body was based on a Leyland National bus, built at Workington in Cumbria. Many fixtures and fittings of the Leyland National could be found on the units. The new class could carry more passengers: 120 passengers per two-car set. The same engines were used. \nThe first sets were used on Devon and Cornwall branch lines and on commuter services in the north west. The units from Cornwall were eventually moved to Liverpool and the north east, so the Class 142s were often seen on services across the north of England. \nIn the early 1990s, the 142s got more powerful Cummins engines, which gave a total power output of per two-car set. Several units were then changed for use on the Merseyside PTE City Line on Merseyrail in the Liverpool region, giving them dot-matrix route signs, better seating and Merseyrail PTE paintwork. \nWhen privatisation happened, the class 142s were taken over by Arriva Trains Northern and First North Western, and then by Northern Rail, Arriva Rail North, Northern Trains, Arriva Trains Wales and Transport for Wales. Eight Northern Rail units were withdrawn from service for a while and replaced by a series of British Rail Class 158s. First Great Western received 12 units on loan from Northern Rail from December 2007 to November 2011 (five units were returned to Northern in December 2008). This allowed most of its Class 158 fleet to be rebuilt as three-car sets.\nClass 143 and Class 144.\nAround the same time that the Class 142 was developed, another class of Pacer railbus was designed by Kilmarnock-based Hunslet-Barclay. These used a Walter Alexander bus body. They were given the number Class 143 and started being used in 1985. Its two 205\u00a0bhp engines gave a total output of and a top speed of . This class of Pacer originally had a capacity of 122 passengers. They were used in the North East before being transferred to Wales and the South West, and were moved over to Valley Lines and Wales &amp; West control during privatisation. They then passed on to Arriva Trains Wales, Wessex Trains, First Great Western and Transport for Wales. The interiors were completely changed in 2000, when the Valley Lines service was introduced, with full back, coach-type seating installed throughout, along with improved fittings. This reduced seating capacity to 106 seats per set.\nThen came a similar Class 144 unit, a Walter Alexander body on BREL underframe, which was introduced in 1987. A unit was formed of either a two-car set with 122 seats or a three-car set with a total capacity of 195 passengers and , but its top speed was still . The units were used in the North East, passing to Northern Spirit at privatisation, then to Arriva Trains Northern, Northern Rail, Arriva Rail North and now Northern Trains.\nAdvantages and disadvantages.\nDisadvantages.\nIt has often been said that the Pacers are of poor quality. Instead of the usual bogies, Pacers use a basic four-wheel two-axle underframe. This often makes for a ride that is noisier and less comfortable than other trains, especially over points, and a loud squealing noise is heard around tight curves. Not having bogies also makes for a worse suspension and a bumpier ride; Pacers have been nicknamed \"nodding donkeys\" because of the trains' up-and-down motion on uneven track. The basic bench seating can also be uncomfortable. The early units, especially the s, were also very unreliable.\nPacers have only been used in certain areas of the north and south west of England and the south of Wales, but not in the richer London or south east England areas. This has also created bad feelings.\nSafety worries were raised after the 1999 Winsford crash. A Virgin Trains Class 87 express train ran into an empty First North Western Class 142 Pacer, after the Pacer had fouled the main line at Winsford, Cheshire on the West Coast Main Line. The wire straps that held the body of the Pacer to its frame broke, separating the body from the frame and causing severe damage. The unit was written off. Twenty-seven passengers and crew were wounded, four badly. But all passenger injuries were on the other train, as the Class 142 was running empty at the time.\nAdvantages.\nOn the other hand, the Pacers were seen as a practical solution at a time when there was not a lot of money. They probably saved services on some rural lines that might not have been serviced by any trains at all if only more expensive trains had been available. They have also proved cheap to run, achieving a fuel economy of 10 miles to the gallon.\nReplacements.\nAs of 2020, the oldest Pacers on the national network were nearly 35 years old. All were planned to be withdrawn and scrapped by December 2019 as they do not comply with Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations.\nCAF Civity.\nIn July 2019, rollout of Northern's Class 195 CAF \"Civity\" units had begun on some routes. Because of this, refurbished Sprinters that no longer needed on those routes can be used to replace Pacers instead.\nVivarail D-Train.\nThese units are built out of upcycled London Underground D78 Stock, built between 1978 and 1981, which were in service on the District line until 2017. To convert the old stock for mainline railway use, it will be necessary to re-use the aluminium bodyshells, traction motors and bogies from the D78 units and fit them out with new diesel engines and interiors. The D-Train units underwent acceptance testing in 2015 and Vivarail pitched them to train operating companies (TOCs), especially those bidding for the Northern franchise. While no orders were received from Northern, Transport for Wales will replace its Pacers with a combination of five D-Trains and trains taken over from other train operators, and other TOCs have ordered D-trains to replace other outdated trains: South Western Railway for the Isle of Wight's Island Line, and West Midlands Trains for the Marston Vale line\n\"144e Evolution\".\nPorterbrook, which owns the Class 143 and Class 144 fleets, refurbished 144012 in 2014 to comply with the new legislation, dubbed the \"144e Evolution\" unit. However, no other units have been refurbished to this standard. \nPreservation.\nSeveral \"Pacers\" have been preserved for further use on heritage railways. The National Railway Museum has preserved 142001. \nIn May 2019, the government asked the public how to re-use the trains after withdrawal from service. One of the suggestions was re-using them as public spaces, such as village halls or cafes."}

It was built in 1903 by Hurst Nelson. At first it had a three window saloon, before being rebuilt by Southampton Corporation Tramways with a four window one. The tram looks out of proportion as it had to pass through the very low Bathgate Arch in the centre of Southampton. A normal sized tram would not have been able to have passed underneath the arch.\nThe tramcar operated from 1903 until the Southampton system closed in 1949. At an enthusiasts' tour of the system, the Museum Committee of the Light Railway Transport League bought the tram for \u00a310. This price included a refurbished truck and a full repaint. This act began the entire preservation movement of British tramways.\nAfter it had been purchased the tram travelled the country as there was not yet a museum set up that could store the tram. By 1955 the tram was being stored at Marton depot in Blackpool. It was soon given to the Tramway Museum Society (TMS) and moved to the National Motor Museum at Beaulieu, Hampshire. It was placed next to Newcastle 102, another preserved tramcar. Both of the trams were in an open-air display.\nThe tram moved to Crich Tramway Village in October 1960, and has been there ever since. It is in regular use during the summer months and is the museum's only operational open-top tramcar."}

Acanthocephalans have no gut and absorb nutrients directly from the host\u2019s gut. \nAcanthocephalans have complex life cycles, with various hosts, including invertebrates, fishes, amphibians, birds, and mammals. The juveniles are parasitic in crustaceans and insects. Adults live in the digestive tract of vertebrates, especially fish. About 1150 species have been described.\nThe Acanthocephala were thought to be a separate phylum. Recent genome analysis has shown that they are closely related to rotifers. Since all parasites are derived from free-living forms, the Acanthocephalans are modified rotifers. This is an example of molecular phylogenetics. In due course, spiny-headed worms will probably be placed in a taxonomic rank below phylum, such as sub-phylum or class."}

It is the only member of the family Craseonycteridae. It occurs in western Thailand and southeast Burma. It usually lives in limestone caves along rivers.\nThis is the smallest species of bat and one of the world's smallest mammals. It has a reddish-brown or grey coat, with a distinctive pig-like snout. Colonies vary in size, with an average of 100 individuals per cave. The bat feeds during short activity periods in the evening and dawn, foraging around nearby forest areas for insects. Female bat have only one offspring each year.\nDescription.\nThe bumblebee bat is about 29\u201333\u00a0millimetres (1.14\u20131.30\u00a0in) in length and 2 grams (0.07 oz) in mass). This is the reason for its common name \"bumblebee bat\". It is the smallest species of bat. The Etruscan shrew is lighter (1.2\u20132.7\u00a0g) (0.042-0.095\u00a0oz).\nThe bat has a distinctive swollen, pig-like snout with thin, vertical nostrils. Its ears are relatively large, while its eyes are small and mostly concealed by fur. Its teeth are typical of an insectivorous bat.\nThe wings are relatively large and darker in colour, with long tips that allow the bat to hover. Kitti's Hog-nosed Bat has no visible tail. There is a large web of skin between the hind legs which may help in flying and catching insects, although there are no tail bones to help control it in flight.\nRange and distribution.\nIn Thailand, the bat is in a small region of Kanchanaburi Province, in the drainage basin of the Khwae Noi River.\nSince the 2001 discovery of a single individual in Burma, at least nine separate sites have been identified. The Thai and Burmese populations are morphologically identical, but their echolocation calls are distinct. It is not known whether the two populations are reproductively isolated.\nBehaviour.\nThe bumblebee bat roosts in the caves of limestone hills, along rivers, within dry evergreen or deciduous forests. While many caves contain only 10 to 15 individuals, the average group size is 100, with a maximum of about 500. Individuals roost high on walls or roof domes, far apart from each other. Bats also undertake seasonal migration between caves.\nThe bat has a brief activity period, leaving its roost for only 30 minutes in the evening and 20 minutes at dawn. These short flights are easily interrupted by heavy rain or cold temperatures. During this period, the bat forages within fields of cassava and kapok or around the tops of bamboo clumps and teak trees, within one kilometre of the roosting site. The wings seem to be shaped for hovering flight, and the gut contents of specimens do include spiders and insects that are presumably gleaned off foliage. Nevertheless, most prey is probably caught in flight. Main staples of the bat's diet include small flies.\nLate in the dry season (around April) of each year, females give birth to a single offspring. During feeding periods, the young either stays in the roost or remains attached to the mother at one of her two vestigial pubic nipples.\nTaxonomy.\nThe bumblebee bat was discovered in 1974. It is the only living species in the family Craseonycteridae.\nConservation.\nAs of the species' most recent review in 1996, the bat is listed by the IUCN as endangered, with a downward population trend.\nCurrently, the most significant and long-term threat to the Thai population could be the annual burning of forest areas, which is most prevalent during the bat's breeding season. In addition, the proposed construction of a pipeline from Burma to Thailand may have a negative impact. Threats to the Burmese population are not well known.\nIn 2007, the bat was identified by the EDGE project (evolutionarily distinct and globally endangered) as one of its top 10 \"focal species\"."}

It is a part of the Shire of Moorabool. Ballan is north west of Melbourne, on the Werribee River. In 2006 there were 1808 people living in Ballan. The Western Freeway goes past the town.\nHistory.\nThe first people to live in the Ballan area were the Aborigines, the Wautharong people. The area was rich in animals with kangaroos, kangaroo rats, bandicoots, dingos, and two sorts of native cat. Many of these animals had gone by the end of the 1800s, with Europen settlement.\nThe first European settlers came from Tasmania, landing near Geelong, Victoria, and working their way up the Moorabool River with their sheep flocks. Robert Von Steiglitz first came to the area in 1838. He named it after Ballan in Ireland. Other early settler names included Covvie, Stead, Wallace and Egerton.\nThere were fights between the Wautharong people and white farmers during settlement. Robert Von Steiglitz said stated in his diary:\n... it may be questioned by some feather-bed philanthropist whether we had the right to take the country from the blacks but I believe the general rule is that if people cultivate or graze the land they have a claim to it.

The first one is the library of Celsus which is located at the end of the Curettes Street. The library looks like a two storeyed building seen from the facade but as we know it former had three stories inside. The facade shows a rare found craftsmanship. Also the library was the third biggest library of the ancient world, after the libraries of Alexandria and Pergamon. Anyone who stands in front of this monumental building can understand why did it take twenty years (115 AD to 135 AD) to complete it. \nThe second one is Ephesus' grand theatre which had the capacity of 25.000 spectators. It was not just a place of art also as we know it was used for animal and gladiator fights. With its great dimensions it makes one think about how small my moment in time really is. It's one of the sacred ruins of Ephesus, according to the Acts of the Apostles (19:23-41), the theater was the site of the \"riot of the silversmiths\" in which those who made silver figures of Artemis the pagan godess of the city rioted because Paul's preaching was bad for business. In the 1st century AD, the Apostle Paul spent over three years in Ephesus and he sermonized many times, disapproving pagan worship, in this theater."}

It ruled between 1661 and 1683. It was a pro-Ming Dynasty kingdom. It was started by Koxinga, after the destruction of Ming government by the Manchu. Koxinga was son of a pirate who was a supporter of the Ming Dynasty. He hoped to get his soldiers together on Taiwan and use it as a base to get back mainland China for the Ming Dynasty.\nNames.\nThe Kingdom of Tungning is also sometimes known as:\nAdmiral Koxinga called Taiwan Tungtu/Dongdu. In western history books it is known as the Kingdom of Taiwan.\nHistory.\nIn 1661, Koxinga forced a landing at Luerhmen, Taiwan. In less than a year, he took Fort Zeelandia and made an agreement with Frederick Coyett, the Dutch governor. The Dutch gave him the fort and left all the goods and property of the Dutch East India Company behind. All the Dutch people, officials and soldiers were able take their \"personal\" things and supplies back to Batavia in safety. This ended 38 years of Dutch colonial rule on Taiwan. Koxinga kept himself busy making Taiwan into a useful base for anti-Qing Dynasty supporters who hoped to get the Ming Dynasty back to power.\nIn 1662, at the age of 39, Koxinga died of malaria. Some people said that he died in a sudden fit of craziness when he heard about the death of his father under the Qing. His son, Zheng Jing, took control as the ruler of Taiwan, with the name of Prince of Yanping.\nFor the next 19 years, Zheng Jing tried to run the country and rebuild his army in Taiwan. Contact with the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing Dynasty from the China through ambassadors was frequent. Zheng Jing fought the Qing to defend Xiamen, Quemoy and the Pescadores islands, which he finally lost over the years. His small army army was not big enough to defend the islands from the Qing. During Revolt of the Three Feudatories, Zheng Jing started an attack in the Fujian area. At the end of the revolt, Zheng's army was defeated. After the defeat, Zheng went back to Taiwan where he spent his time with wine and women, dying soon after of illness. After his death, his generals and ministers were split into two groups, each supporting one of his sons to take take over. After some fighting, Zheng Keshuang, his 12 year old son, became the new king.\nIn 1683, after the Battle of Penghu, Zheng Keshuang gave himself up to the Qing. His kingdom was added to the Qing Dynasty as part of the Fujian Province.\nWhat the kingdom means today.\nThe Kingdom of Tungning lasted for just over 20 years. Because its history is almost the same as modern Taiwan, it has great symbolic value.\nAfter its defeat in the Chinese Civil War in 1949, the Republic of China (ROC), led by the Kuomintang, went to Taiwan. They left mainland China to the Communist Party who started the People's Republic of China (PRC). For many years, the ROC planned to take control of the mainland. It kept island bases close to the mainland (for example, Quemoy). This was the same as Koxinga and his sons had done. The ROC has now become a democracy and no longer wants to take over the mainland. The political and territorial arrangement has not changed. In this way, it is the same as between the Qing/Koxinga situation and the current PRC/ROC situation.\nThe Kuomintang of the ROC have talked a lot about the goals of Koxinga. They were going to use Taiwan as a base for returning their government to Mainland China. They see themselves as the defenders of the ROC. They see Taiwan as a base from which the ROC will take back control of the mainland. The PRC talks about the fact that Koxinga freed Taiwan from Dutch colonialism for the sake of the motherland. They do not talk about the fact that Koxinga was trying to get rid of the mainland government, to bring back an earlier dynasty."}

There are now more than twenty second-hand book shops in the town.\nHistory.\nThe name Bredevoort appears for the first time in 1188, when the earl of Steinfurt tried to sell his share of the castle to the bishop of M\u00fcnster and the earl of Lohn tried to sell his share to the earl of Gelderland, a war broke out between the bishop and the earl of Gelderland. The fight lasted for almost two centuries. From 1326, Bredevoort was actual part of Gelderland. Between 1326 and 1696 the municipality of Bredevoort repeatedly changed ownership during the eighties years of war. In 1646, lightning hit the gunpowder tower of the castle of Bredevoort, causing an explosion that destroyed the castle and the town, killing Lord Haersolte of Bredevoort and his family, as well as others. Only one son, Anthonie, who was not home that day, survived. The former municipality of Bredevoort was comprised of the city, the castle Bredevoort, and the villages Aalten, Dinxperlo and Winterswijk. After centuries of war, its fortifications were demolished by its residents. In 1818, the municipality of Bredevoort was dissolved to become part of the city Bredevoort under the newly formed municipality Aalten."}

When British Railways was formed in 1948, it decided to adopt the former LNER method of carriage classification.\nBasic principles.\nThe codes are made up from a combination of letters, some of which can indicate more than one word; their meaning can only be determined according to their position, or the presence of other letters, in the code. The letters used are:\nThese letters (except for \"Y\" and \"Z\") did not usually apply to the wide variety of passenger-rated but goods carrying vans (e.g. parcels vans, horse boxes, milk and fish vans). Their codes were an acronym of their traditional railway description, e.g. GUV for General Utility Vans.\nList of codes used.\nThe following list lists those codes that were actually used on British Railways, cross-referred to the comparable code used by the LMS, with the exception that the letter \"S\" (\"\"Second\", later \"Standard\") is used where until 1956 the letter \"T\" (\"Third\") is used. Suffix codes \"Y\" or \"Z\" are not shown, as these could apply to variants of any or all vehicle types.\nIn the original LNER coding system, \"S\" stood for \"Second\", an intermediate class between \"First\" and \"Third\" (which later became \"Second\"). The original \"Second\" was more or less abolished in the 1870s (as a result of the Railway Regulation Act 1844), remaining only in limited use for special services, such as those meeting ships (which retained the three-class system from which railway classifications had originated). In the 1980s, BR renamed \"Second\" to \"Standard\". Many of the classifications listed below are no longer used, and some did not survive until the designation \"Standard\"\".\nNote that in modern usage, composite semi-open vehicles are classified \"Cso\" \u2013 the \"s\" signifying that the Standard portion is open (implying that the First portion is compartments with corridor)."}

The site was first served by Underground trains in 1863, and was the first western end-point of the Metropolitan Railway, the world's first underground railway.\nThe station now has an extra job as the London end point for the Heathrow Express airport service. Paddington is in Travelcard Zone 1.\nServices.\nRail.\nThe fast services are run by First Great Western. The main stations for the services are shown below:\nThere are also trains to Slough, Ealing, Heathrow Airport and Maidenhead.\nOne train from Paddington goes to Heathrow Airport that being the Heathrow Express which travels to Heathrow airport and doesn't stop at any stations along the way.\nUnderground.\nBelow are the lines and main stations on the line:\nNational Rail.\nThe National Rail part is named London Paddington, a name used outside London, but not by many people who live there. Parts of the station, like the main train shed, were built in 1854 by Isambard Kingdom Brunel as the London end point for the Great Western Railway (GWR). Today, it is one of 18 UK railway stations looked after by Network Rail.\nPaddington has 14 end platforms, numbered 1 to 14. Platforms 1 to 8 are below the oldest three parts of Brunel's 1854 train shed, and platforms 9 to 12 are below the fourth part. Platforms 13 and 14 are within the Metropolitan Railway's old Bishop's Road station to the north-west. There are two through platforms, 15 and 16, used by the London Underground's Hammersmith &amp; City and Circle lines."}

It was used to fly the longest planned flight in the world, from Singapore to Newark but only to be flown by the Airbus A340-500 until they were dropped in November 2013 until they operate it back with the new Airbus A350-900ULR in October 2018 with modified fuel system. In addition, there is also a low-cost airline, called Scoot. Scoot is the airline that has a mix of Airbus A320 and Boeing 787.\nSingapore Airlines was given \"Airline of the Year\" by Skytrax in 2008. Its hub, Singapore Changi Airport, was given \"Airport of the Year\" in 2006.\nFleet.\nThe Singapore Airlines fleet features exclusively wide-body aircraft from four aircraft families: the Boeing 777, Airbus A380, Airbus A350, and the Airbus A330. As of 31 October 2017, there were 111 aircraft registered in the Singapore Airlines fleet.\nSingapore Airlines introduced the Airbus A330-300 in January 2009. It was the first aircraft in the fleet to feature a new regional business class product with 30 lie-flat leather seats in a 2-2-2 configuration, which has since been retrofitted on other regional aircraft in the fleet.\nFive further A330s were delivered in 2009, progressively replacing older Boeing 777-200s on medium-haul routes, and the fleet stood at 19 examples by June 2011. All the aircraft were acquired on five-year leases with the option to extend if necessary, designed to fill the airline's capacity requirements until the delivery of Airbus A350s and Boeing 787s.\nThe airline committed to an additional 15 A330 aircraft in June 2011, which were delivered between 2013 and 2015, continuing to replace older Boeing 777s in the fleet. The A330 fleet was the second largest by type in the airline as of 31 August 2016 (after the Boeing 777 fleet) with 27 aircraft in service. In January 2016 the airline confirmed its intention to eventually replace all A330 aircraft with Airbus A350s in a medium-range configuration by 2019.\nSingapore Airlines placed an order for 30 Airbus A350-900 aircraft in 2006, with a further 30 orders placed in 2013. The airline took delivery of the first of the aircraft in February 2016 and flew its delivery flight to Singapore on 2 March. The airline began operating regular services using the A350 on the Singapore-Amsterdam route from 9 May 2016.\nOn 13 October 2015, Singapore Airlines announced that it had placed orders for seven Airbus A350-900ULR (Ultra-Long Range), which will see the return of non-stop flights between Singapore and both New York and Los Angeles. The A350-900ULR will be configured with approximately 170 seats, compared to 253 in Singapore Airlines' standard A350-900, and will be fitted with the airline's all-new business class seat design due in 2018."}

In \"The Gentleman's Magazine\" he made the first general-interest \"magazine\". \nThe son of a cobbler, Cave was born in Newton near Rugby, Warwickshire and attended the grammar school there. Cave was made to leave after it was said he stole from the headmaster. He worked at a number of different jobs, such as selling timber, writing and printing. He came up with the idea of a periodical that would cover every subject the educated public was interested in, from commerce to poetry. He tried to get some London printers and booksellers to take up the idea. When no one showed any interest, Cave took on the job by himself. \"The Gentleman's Magazine\" was started in 1731 and soon became the most important and most copied periodical of its time. It also made Cave very rich.\nCave was a smart businessman. He gave all his energy to the magazine, and hardly ever left its offices at St John's Gate, Clerkenwell. He made use of a lot of writers, the most famous was Samuel Johnson, who was always thankful to Cave for having given him his main job for many years. Cave himself often sent in items to the Magazine under the pen name of Sylvanus Urban. \nHe also got permission from Lewis Paul for 250 spindles for his patent roller-spinning machine, an early model of the water frame. In 1742 he bought Marvels Mill at Northampton and made this into a cotton mill. This was probably the first water-powered spinning mill in the world. This should have made a lot of money, but it did not. It closed about 1761. \nCave suffered from gout. He is buried at St. James Church, Clerkenwell."}

The rift is bordered by a series of mountains and active volcanoes. It is a site of faults and earthquakes.\nBasically, the western part of Africa is rifting away from the eastern part. This causes all the geological activity at the Valley. Far in the future, a sea will run between these two parts of Africa. The Arabian peninsula is already almost separated. The whole process is part of plate tectonics. In eastern Africa, the valley divides into two, the Western Rift Valley and the Eastern Rift Valley.\nThere are about 20 UNESCO World Heritage Sites which owe their formation to the geography and geology of the Great Rift Valley.\nThe Western Rift Valley.\nThe Western Rift is edged by some of the highest mountains in Africa. It contains the Rift Valley lakes, which include some of the deepest lakes in the world (up to 1,470 metres deep at Lake Tanganyika). Much of this area is inside national parks.\nThe African Great Lakes are a series of lakes formed by the tectonic action of the East African Rift. Most lie within its rift valley.. They include Lake Victoria, the second largest fresh water lake in the world in terms of surface area, and Lake Tanganyika, the world's second largest in volume as well as the second deepest.\nThe African Great Lakes are divided among three different catchments (river basins). Some, such as Lake Turkana, have internal drainage systems. The largest, in order of size from largest to smallest are:\nEastern Rift Valley.\nThe lakes in the Eastern Rift have no outlet to the sea and tend to be shallow, they have a high mineral content as the evaporation of water leaves the salts behind.\nLake Malawi (or Lake Nyasa: the name is disputed) is the most southern of the Great Lakes, and empties into the great Zambezi River via the Shire River."}

It is in the capital city, Edinburgh. The Parliament is sometimes called \"Holyrood\".\nThe original Parliament of Scotland (or \"Estates of Scotland\") was the national legislature of the independent Kingdom of Scotland. It existed from the early 13th century until 1707. This was when the Kingdom of Scotland merged with the Kingdom of England under the Acts of Union 1707 to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain. Because of this, the Parliament of Scotland merged with the Parliament of England to form the Parliament of Great Britain, which sat at Westminster in London. This legislature merged with the Irish Parliament from 1801 to make the current Parliament of the United Kingdom.\nIn 1997 there was a referendum where the Scottish people voted for Scotland to have a Parliament again. The current Parliament was established by the Scotland Act 1998. The first meeting was on 12 May 1999.\nThe Parliament is a devolved assembly, which means that some powers have been kept by the UK Parliament. The issues which the Scottish Parliament can make laws about are called \"devolved matters\". The issues which the UK Parliament must make laws about are called \"reserved matters\". Some examples of devolved matters are health and social services, education and housing. Examples of reserved matters are foreign policy, immigration and the constitution of the Scottish Parliament.\nThere are 129 members known as Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) who are democratically elected. Members are elected for five-year terms. Most of the MSPs belong to political parties. Independent MSPs do not belong to a political party.\nThe number of MSPs from each party are:"}

This cave is near Mosselbaai/Mossel Bay on the south coast South Africa. Discoveries in the cave show that these early humans were able to work with haematite pieces, and used ochre to paint their bodies. The discovery challenges the widely held belief that modern human behaviour began only 45,000 years ago. It also challenges the view that this behaviour was reached through a \"large cultural leap\".\nBecause the African climate became cool and dry, the food resources were reduced dramatically. This was the reason why the Pinnacle Point man moved to the shores. There, they could eat marine creatures like mussels, snails and crabs. These men also used amazingly subtle tools. Microliths were mounted on wood shafts\nThe Discovery.\nThe startling discovery was made in 2007 by an international team, including the palaeoanthropologist Curtis Marean from the \"Institute of Human Origins\" of the Arizona State University and three graduate students of the \"School of Human Evolution and Social Change\". They came to the conclusion that humans living in the cave started to eat new foods. They added shellfish and other marine resources to their diet. The cause for this evolution was the climate change. It is the first evidence that mankind was able to this. The report in the magazine Nature also reports that the evidence for using coloured pigments was also found. This is much earlier than the earliest known usage which had been from 70,000 years ago.\nThe findings give rise to the assumption that living near the coast has caused the changes.\nSearching for beginnings.\nThe evidence shows that Homo sapiens evolved in Africa 100,000 to 200,000 years ago. At that time, the world was in an ice age, and Africa was a desert. But as archaeologica sites dating to that time period are rare in Africa, palaeonthologist Curtis Marean looked at different information. He studied geologic formations, the sea currents, climate data and much more. As a result, he was able to pinpoint his research to destinations like the Pinnacle Point cave, where the findings have been made."}

Such services tend to fall into one of two camps: Big Web Services and RESTful Web Services.\n\"Big Web Services\" use XML messages that follow the SOAP standard and have been popular with traditional enterprise. In such systems, there is often a machine-readable description of the operations offered by the service written in the Web Services Description Language (WSDL). The latter is not a requirement of a SOAP endpoint, but it is a prerequisite for automated client-side code generation in many Java and .NET SOAP frameworks (frameworks such as Spring, Apache Axis2 and Apache CXF being notable exceptions). Some industry organizations, such as the WS-I, mandate both SOAP and WSDL in their definition of a Web service.\nMore recently, RESTful Web services have been regaining popularity, particularly with Internet companies. These also meet the W3C definition, and are often better integrated with HTTP than SOAP-based services. They do not require XML messages or WSDL service-API definitions."}

The first inhabitants of the region were the indigenous tribe Ting\u00fci, by the Tupi-Guarani nation.\nAt the beginning of the Christian Era, the Plateau Curitibano (also known as First Plateau of Paran\u00e1) was inhabited by peoples potters. Subterranean houses, found at archaeological sites on the outskirts of Curitiba, show the adaptation of native to the adverse conditions of climate, as the cold wind, frost and snow.\nIn time of arrival of the Portuguese to Brazil, the Plateau Curitibano was occupied by groups of linguistic families J\u00ea and Tupi-Guarani.\nColonization period.\nThe first ten years of the 16th century marked the beginning of a war of conquest of Europeans against the indigenous peoples who inhabited the plateaus of southeastern and southern Brazil. Were Portuguese and Spanish expeditions in search of precious metals and stones, and Indians to enslave. \nThe region of Curitiba began to be populated by non-Indians around 1630, by people from Paranagu\u00e1, where the alluvium gold had been discovered, forming the village of \"Our Lady of Light and Good Jesus of Pine Forest\", which was became in town in 1693. The Portuguese who founded a village in 1693 gave it the name of \"Vila da Nossa Senhora da Luz dos Pinhais\" (\"Our Lady of the Light in the Pine Forest\"). The name was changed to \"Curitiba\" in 1721. \nThere is a legend telling that around 1648 a group of pioneers founded a small village near the Atuba River while searching for gold. These pioneers venerated \"Nossa Senhor da Luz\" and made a special place there for her statue. The legend tells that every morning the image turned her eyes to a pine tree forest, which the pioneers knew was a sacred place of the Indians. The explorers took this as a sign that \"Nossa Senhora\" was showing them a special place for their village. Even though they knew that the Indians took them as enemies, the pioneers took the risk and went in to the forest to find this special place. When the pioneers got close to the tribe, a miracle happened: the Indians were peaceful and expecting them to come. Done contact with the leader of the Ting\u00fci tribe, the cacique Tindiq\u00fcera would have said the new location and put a stick in the ground, saying \"Cor\u00e9 Etuba\" (\"many pines\"). By this stick would have grown a great tree, where today is the \"zero mark\" of Curitiba. At that place the pioneers built a chapel in honor of the saint, now called \"Nossa Senhora da Luz dos Pinhais\" (\"Our Lady of the Light in the Pine Forest\").\nCuritiba officially became a town in 1812, orthography its name as \"Curityba\". An alternative orthography also came up: \"Coritiba\". This orthography looked to become dominant for it was used in press and state documents, but a state decree in 1919 decided the dispute by orthography the city name \"Curitiba\". Growth was based on the cattle trade, being a way between cattle breeding country to the South and markets to the North. Developing effective started from the beginning of the 19th century, with the exploitation and exportation of Yerba mate (\"Ilex paraguariensis\"), and the elevation to the condition that city in 1842.\nImmigration period.\nWaves of European immigrants started arriving after 1850, mainly Germans, Italians, Poles and Ukrainians. In 1853, the south and southwest of the province of S\u00e3o Paulo are separated, forming the new province of Paran\u00e1, and Curitiba has become capital. The \"Universidade Federal do Paran\u00e1\" (Federal University of Paran\u00e1), the first in Brazil, was established in Curitiba in 1913, the same year in which electric streetcars were first deployed.\nAs most of Southern Brazil's population, Curitiba is mostly inhabited by Brazilians of European descent. The first Europeans to arrive in the region were of Portuguese origin, during the 17th century. They intermarried with the native people and with the African slaves.\nIn the 19th century, the influx of immigrants from Europe increased. In 1828, the first German immigrants settled in Paran\u00e1. However, large numbers of immigrants from Germany only arrived in Curitiba during the 1870s, most of them was Volga Germans from Russia.\nImmigrants from Poland first arrived in 1871, settling in rural areas near to Curitiba. They largely influenced the agriculture of the region. Curitiba has the second largest Polish diaspora in the world, second only to Chicago, and is the only Brazilian city to have orthography in Polish language: \"Kurytyba\".\nItalian immigrants started arriving in Curitiba in 1878. They came mostly from the Veneto and Trento regions, in Northern Italy and settled mostly in the Santa Felicidade neighborhood, still today the center of the large Italian community of Curitiba.\nLarge numbers of Ukrainian immigrants settled in Curitiba, mostly between 1895 and 1897, when 20 thousands arrived. They were peasants from Galicia, who immigrated to Brazil to become small farmers. Nowadays there are 300 thousand Ukrainian-Brazilians living in Paran\u00e1.\nJapanese immigrants starting arriving in the region in 1915. Curitiba received significant numbers of immigrants from Japan. Nowadays, there are about 40 thousand Japanese-Brazilians living in the city. \nOther immigrants, such as jewishes, Arabs from Lebanon and Syria, English, French, Russians and other Eastern Europeans also settled in Curitiba.\nCurrent period.\nDuring the 20th century, especially after the middle, the city is going through a large increase in population and is consolidating as regional hub for trade and services, becoming one of the richest cities in Brazil and pioneer in urban solutions. In the 1940s and 1950s, Alfred Agache, co-founder of the French Society for Urban Studies, was hired to produce the first city plan. It emphasised a \"star\" of boulevards, with public amenities downtown, an industrial district and sanitation. It was followed when possible, but was too expensive to complete.\nBy the 1960s, Curitiba's population had increased to 430,000, and some residents feared that the growth in population threatened to drastically change the character of the city. In 1964, Mayor Ivo Arzua solicited proposals for urban design. Architect Jaime Lerner - who later became mayor - led a team from the Universidade Federal do Paran\u00e1 that suggested strict controls on urban sprawl, a reduction of traffic in the downtown area, preservation of Curitiba's Historic Sector, and a convenient and affordable public transit system. This plan, known as the Curitiba Master Plan, was adopted in 1968. Lerner closed the XV de Novembro St. to vehicles, because it had very high pedestrian traffic. The plan had a new road design to minimise traffic: the Trinary Road System. This uses two one-way streets moving in opposite directions which surround a smaller, two-lane street where the express buses have their exclusive lane. Five of these roads form a star that converges to the city centre. Land farther from these roads is zoned for lower density developments, to reduce traffic away from the main roads. A number of areas subject to floods were condemned and became parks.\nCurrently, the immigration of foreigners is small - is common only immigrants from China, some Middle Eastern and South American countries -, has been replaced by migration of Brazilians from other regions of the country (it is estimated that nowadays about half the population of Curitiba is composed of migrants)."}

It made its way into the United States by accident and has since been spread to eleven states and to the border with Canada.\nThe beetle is an invasive species, and a serious pest which destroys ash trees. It has killed at least 25 million ash trees so far and threatens to kill most of the ash trees throughout North America.\nAdults lay eggs in crevasses in the bark. Larvae burrow into the bark after hatching and consume the living tissue of cambium and phloem. This causes death within two years. The average emerging season for the emerald ash borer is early spring to late summer. Females lay around 75 eggs, but up to 300 from early May to mid-July. The borer's life cycle is estimated to be one year in southern Michigan but may be up to two years in colder regions.\nHuge efforts have been made to slow down its spread, but nothing has worked so far. Parasitoid wasps from Asia are being released, and a fungus which kills insects is being tried."}
{"id": "161382", "revid": "17988", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=161382", "title": "Ratite", "text": "The ratites are a group of medium to large birds, most of which are flightless. Most of them, including the largest (moas and elephant birds) are now extinct. \nUnlike other flightless birds, the ratites have no keel on their sternum. In a flying bird the sternum anchors the wing muscles. \nMost parts of the former super-continent Gondwana have ratites, or did have until the fairly recent past. Their closest living relatives are the tinamous of South America.\nThe classification used here includes all ratites in the order Struthioniformes, but not the tinamous. This may change in future.\nEvolution and systematics.\nIt was once thought that ratites were all one monophyletic group, which evolved together in Gondwana in the Upper Cretaceous. Then they evolved in their separate ways as Gondwana split up, and the parts drifted apart. The parts became the modern southern continents, plus Africa and the Indian subcontinent.\nHowever, modern gene analysis conflicts with this. DNA analysis shows that the ratites diverged from one another too recently to share a common Gondwanian ancestor. However, all analyses show that rheas (South America) and the living Australasian/Oceanian ratites \"are\" monophyletic. \nRecent analysis of twenty nuclear genes suggests that the flighted tinamous cluster within the ratite lineage. The timamids are the sister group of the Australo-Pacific ratites.\nIf so, this would make 'ratites', as a whole, paraphyletic rather than monophyletic. Since tinamous are weak fliers, this raises interesting questions about the evolution of flightlessness in this group. If timamous are inside the ratite lineage, then ratites evolved flightlessness at least three times. Re-evolution of flight in the tinamous would be an alternative explanation, but that has no precedent in bird evolution, while loss of flight is commonplace.\nSimple summary.\nTinamous are ratites. Therefore, ratites are a group of medium to large birds, most of whom are flightless, with the exception of the tinamous. The ratites evolved flightlessness more than once. The similarities between Ostriches and the Australo-Pacific ratites is due to convergent evolution."}

Even though Luis was strong it was still only the second strongest storm in 1995, the strongest was Hurricane Opal. Hurricane Luis was the strongest storm to hit the Leeward Islands since Hurricane Hugo in 1989. From August 22 to September 1 Humberto, Iris, Jerry, Luis, and Karen were active at the same time. Most of the places damaged by Luis were damaged only a week earlier by Hurricane Iris, except for the United States and Newfoundland (Canada) and most of the islands would be damaged again less than two weeks later by Hurricane Marilyn.\nMeteorological History.\nThe early stages of Luis's formation is track back to a tropical wave that moved off of Africa on August 26. The next day it became Tropical Depression Thirteen near Cape Verde. It reached Tropical Storm status on the 29th and was named Luis. It reached hurricane status on August 30 and reach category 4 strength on September 2. The next day Luis reached it's highest winds of 150\u00a0mph making it a Category 4. Luis continued west and crossed over Barbuda late on September 4. At this time Luis came very close to Antigua, St. Barthelemy, St. Martin and Anguilla. Luis turned northwest and while it was 150\u00a0miles to the north of Puerto Rico Luis weakened to a category 2 hurricane, after being a major hurricane for a week. Luis kept slowly weakening and headed to the northeast. While Luis was offshore of Newfoundland he caused a wave more than 98\u00a0feet tall. Luis made landfall in eastern Newfoundland on September 11 while a category 1. That same day Luis became extratropical and died near Greenland.\nImpact.\nThese were the places impacted by Hurricane Luis. Many of the Island Countries were affected by Hurricane Iris a week before; many would also be affected by Hurricane Marilyn only ten days later.\nAntigua and Barbuda.\nLuis caused a lot of damage in Antigua and Barbuda because it made landfall in that country. In Antigua about 50% of houses were either destroyed of damaged. In Barbuda nearly 70% of houses were either destroyed of damaged. The government of the country spent about $350 million in U.S. Dollars to fix the damage.\nBermuda.\nIn Bermuda winds were reported up to 46\u00a0mph. However, there was no damage or people killed in Bermuda. On September 11 a ship called Queen Elizabeth 2 got caught in the 98\u00a0foot wave that Luis caused. The ship was not damaged but it arrived late in New York.\nCanada.\nThe only Providence in Canada affected by Luis was Newfoundland.\nNewfoundland.\nIn Newfoundland, Luis killed one person and caused about $500,000 in damage. Luis dropped 2.4 to 4.7\u00a0inches of rain while it passed over Newfoundland on September 11.\nDominica.\nIn Dominica, larges waves from Hurricane Luis caused one fisherman to get killed. Hurricane Luis caused about $47 million in damage to the island nation.\nSt. Martin.\nSt. Martin, a small island was hurt most by Luis. Luis did not strike St. Martin, but it was hurt most by Luis because he caused 9 people to get killed and $1.8 billion in damage.\nUnited States.\nIn North Carolina, a U.S. state, a wave caused one person to get killed. Also, in New York, a wave washed under a house and later destroyed causing $1.9 million in damage.\nOther places.\nIn Guadeloupe, Luis killed one. In Saint Barthelemy, winds were recorded up to 155\u00a0mph. In Saint Kitts and Nevis, damages from Luis were at $197 million.\nAfter the storm.\nAfter Hurricane Luis many organizations and Governments donated money to help fix the damage on the affect islands. The largest donation was the Government of the Netherlands, which donated $15.2 million.\nRecords.\nWhen Tropical Depression Thirteen became Tropical Storm Luis on August 29, it marked the earliest date of a seasons 12th named storm. While Luis was becoming extratropical it sped up to nearly 65\u00a0mph, making it the third fastest traveling Atlantic hurricane. On September 11 when Luis caused that 98\u00a0foot wave it was the highest wave recorded from an Atlantic hurricane. Until 2004, when Hurricane Ivan may have caused a wave up to 130\u00a0feet.\nRetirement.\nThe name Luis was retired in the spring of 1996. Luis was the first name retired since Andrew in 1992. Luis was also the first named storm starting with L to get its name retired. Luis is now only one of two L names to get retired, the other was Lili in 2002. In 2001 Lorenzo was used instead."}

It may also be considered a reddish tone of purple or a bluish tone of rose.\nOn the old fashioned, now obsolete red-yellow-blue pigment color wheel (in which red, yellow, and blue were regarded as the primary colors and orange, green, and violet were regarded as the secondary colors), \"red-violet\" was a tertiary color between red and violet on the red-yellow-blue pigment color wheel and thus was the equivalent of pigment purple. The other tertiary colors on a red-yellow-blue (RYB) color wheel were called blue-violet, blue-green, yellow-green, yellow-orange, and red-orange.\nThe RYB color wheel is still often used to teach color to children.\nElectric purple observed on spectrum beyond violet by ultraviolet sensitives.\nIt has been reported by ophthalmologists that those who have their lenses removed and replaced with clear plastic intraocular lenses can see partway into the ultraviolet and view electric purple (a tone of red-violet) on the spectrum beyond Violet because it has been shown that the retina has some ultraviolet sensitivity which is normally blocked by the natural lens. Presumably, tetrachromatic animals such as birds can also see this color on the spectrum. These observers able to see partially into the ultraviolet describe the color they can see beyond violet in the ultraviolet as a sort of lilac, that is, a reddish-violet (purple) color that is the color of the lilac flower. (Presumably this color that they see would be electric purple, since electric purple is a pure chroma on the color wheel and would presumably be the color we would see on the spectrum beyond violet if we could see into the ultraviolet.) \nComparison of red, red-violet, and violet.\nNote: The spectrum colors can only be approximated on a computer screen but the colors shown below are a close approximation of the spectral colors red and violet, shown compared to the non-spectral color red-violet (a deep tone of the color magenta tending toward rose)."}

The yeast is usually controlled in the body. When the yeast grows without control, an infection happens.\nA weakened, unhealthy, or young immune system may allow candidiasis to develop. HIV/AIDS, cancer treatments, steroids, stress and not enough nutrients may cause candidiasis.\nAntibiotic and steroid use are the most common reason for uncontrolled yeast.

A strong GPU is able to process complex animations and graphics smoothly and efficiently.\nImages which GPUs calculate (render) may be 2D or 3D. For most applications, the GPU has to render two dimensional (2D) pictures. Modern GPUs are so powerful, that there is no difference in 2D performance between low-cost and expensive GPUs.\nSome applications use 3D pictures to simulate three-dimensionality. Examples include video games, and applications for design and technical construction (CAD). The 3D acceleration performance of GPUs differs greatly. Generally, more expensive GPUs can render faster than low-cost ones.\nOrigin.\nThe first graphics cards were used in the 1970\u2019s ,within arcade machines, as a cheaper alternative to Random-Access Memory (RAM). However, graphics cards were not viable for consumer products until the release of the Large Scale Integration (LSI) circuit chip in the 1980\u2019s. During the early-to-mid 1990\u2019s, graphics cards that were capable of 3D support became more common in arcade, computer and console games. The first consumer-level GPU ,meant for personal computers, was the Nvidia GeForce 256, which was released in 1999.\nModern Uses.\nGPUs are commonly used in computers, and video game systems to render graphics for video games that may not be playable without the proper GPU. However, other devices such as virtual reality headsets and driverless cars, such as Tesla, also use GPUs The tasks a GPU can do include, calculations, artificial intelligence programming, photo editing and other applications.\nGPU Computing.\nThe term GPU computing, combines all tasks a GPU can do, that go beyond simple calculation and output of pictures. It is also known under the term General Purpose Computation on Graphics Processing Unit. Tasks are calculation of physics, Artificial Intelligence or even acceleration of video and picture editing. One of the first applications to support GPU computing is Adobe\u2019s Photoshop CS4. \nNVidia\u2019s approach: CUDA.\nNVidia calls their attempt at GPU Computing CUDA. This is NVidia's interface for using their GPUs for general computing tasks. CUDA is based on the C programming language.\nATI\u2019s approach: Stream.\nATIs decided to call their attempt Stream. There were some earlier attempts under a different name prior to Stream\u2019s release. Such as, ATI's graphics driver \u201cCatalyst 8.12\u201d in December 2008.\nS3 Graphic\u2019s approach.\nS3 Graphics showed a first application for video editing which is accelerated by their latest GPUs. Yet, there is no information whether S3 Graphics will continue to increase their efforts in GPU computing.\nThe latest milestone in GPU computing was AMD\u2019s announcement of a Super-Computer based on GPUs at the CES in January 2009. It will be built of more than a thousand GPUs and will have a computing power of one petaflop.\nExternal GPU.\nAn external GPU is a graphics processor located outside of the housing of the computer. External graphics processors are used with laptop computers, which lack a powerful graphics processor. On-board graphics chips are not powerful enough for graphically intensive tasks. Therefore, attaching a GPU to some notebook is desirable.\nGPU Accelerated Video Decoding.\nMost GPUs were made in the year 1995 to support YUV colour space and hardware overlays, and many GPUs made since 2000 also support MPEG primitives. This process of hardware accelerated video decoding. Most recent graphics cards even decode high-definition video on the card, offloading the central processing unit.\nGPU Interfaces.\nEarly GPUs used Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) interface to communicate with the motherboard of a computer, a type of slot which is still used today for simple motherboard add-ons such as extra audio-processing cards or USB ports. As graphics cards became more powerful and graphics applications more demanding, a faster kind of interface called Advanced Graphics Port (AGP) was created and then PCIe x16 (PCI Express 16-lane) after it, the current overall standard. In 2008 PCIe 2.0 was introduced, doubling the speed of PCIe 1.0 and still working with older PCI Express interfaces.\nPCI graphics cards will only work in PCI slots; AGP will only work in AGP slots. PCIe graphics cards will not function in PCI slots and PCI graphics cards will not function in PCIe slots. However, PCI Express 2.0 graphics cards will work in PCI Express x16 1.0 motherboard slots and vice-versa.\nMulti-GPU systems.\nMulti-GPU Systems are computers which use more than one GPU. Generally this is used in high-end home computers to accelerate computer games, but there is also the ability to have one GPU rendering normal game scenes and one GPU calculating physics. This is currently supported by nVidia\u2019s GPUs only and called PhysX. ATi and Intel have developed their own physics engine named Havok.\nHistory of Multi-GPU systems.\nThe first attempts in Multi-GPU Systems were done by 3Dfx, which was bought by nVidia later. Their Voodoo video cards, which were 3D only accelerators, could be hooked up to a second Voodoo video card to gain more performance. This was called SLi. Theoretically the performance would double, practically it increased far less, depending on the video game, which is still a problem in today\u2019s Multi-GPU Systems. Later, 3Dfx built more than one GPU on one video card. It\u2019s latest video card, the Voodoo 6, was based on four GPUs, but it was never released. However there exist several engineering samples of the Voodoo 6, mostly owned by collectors.\nnVidia\u2019s SLi.\nAfter nVidia bought 3Dfx, Multi-GPU Systems were dead for several years until nVidia came up with this idea again in 2004. As nVidia had bought all technologies and market names from 3Dfx, too, they simply used the name SLi again. Today\u2019s SLi works with up to three video cards, which is called 3-way-SLi. There were also attempts with four cards, but this failed due to limitations in the DirectX9 API. Today\u2019s DirectX10 API however would support this.\nDespite the video cards, a SLi compatible motherboard is needed to build a SLi-System. Such motherboards have several PEG Slots (the successor to AGP, based on PCI-Express Technology) for more than one video card.\nnVidia offers various Multi-GPU video cards, where two GPUs are built on one video card. These are often called Dual-GPU video cards and do not need a SLi compatible motherboard.\nATI\u2019s CrossFireX.\nATI\u2019s Multi-GPU Technology is called Cross Fire. It works quite the same way, though there are fewer limitations for video card combinations. CrossFire was renamed as CrossFire X in 2007 to represent the possibility to combine more than two cards. Today, it is possible to have a CrossFire X system based on four video cards or two Dual-GPU cards.\nJust like with SLi, there is the necessity for a CrossFire compatible motherboard in order to build a CrossFire System. One Dual-GPU video card from ATi does not necessarily need such a Crossfire compatible motherboard, however for two of them, it is needed."}

Tropical Cyclones can and have formed outside these dates but not in 1996, because Hurricane Marco ended on November 24. The 1996 Atlantic hurricane season was very active, but not as active as 1995, but it was more active then 1997.\nStorms.\nTropical Storm Arthur.\nTropical Storm Arthur was the first tropical storm of the 1996 season. It started on June 17 in the Bahamas as Tropical Depression One. One became Tropical Storm Arthur late on June 19. Tropical Storm Arthur made landfall in Cape Lookout, North Carolina was a weak tropical storm. It moved to the east and went back into the Atlantic Ocean and died on June 21. Arthur killed no one and caused only $1 million in damage.\nHurricane Bertha.\nHurricane Bertha was the first hurricane of the 1996 Atlantic hurricane season. It started on July 5 near the Cape Verde Islands. On that same day it became Tropical Storm Bertha. By July 7 it became a hurricane, during that day it struck Antigua, and Sint Maarten. Bertha moved along the edges of the islands in the Bahamas. Hurricane Bertha made landfall in North Carolina on July 12 as a category 2 hurricane. It quickly got weaker and died on July 14 as it entered Canada. Bertha killed 9 people and caused $335 million in damage. \nHurricane Cesar.\nHurricane Cesar started off the coast of Venezuela on July 24, it was a tropical depression at this time. It slowly got stronger, becoming a tropical storm the next day and a hurricane by July 27. On July 28 it made landfall as a hurricane in Nicaragua. Cesar weakened to a tropical storm over land, but it reached the Pacific Ocean and later on it became Hurricane Douglas. Hurricane Cesar killed 77 people and caused $206 million in damage.\nHurricane Dolly.\nHurricane Dolly started as Tropical Depression Four near Jamaica. It got stronger and it became Tropical Storm Dolly soon after. Tropical Storm Dolly became Hurricane Dolly just before it made landfall in the Yucatan Peninsula on August 20. It weakened over land and entered the southern Gulf of Mexico as a tropical depression. Dolly quickly got stronger again and became a tropical storm. Just before it made another landfall in Mexico, it became Hurricane Dolly again on August 23. The storm weakened a lot over Mexico and it died on August 26. It killed about 14 in Mexico.\nHurricane Edouard.\nHurricane Edouard was the strongest hurricane of the 1996 Atlantic hurricane season. It started as Tropical Depression Five near Cape Verde on August 19. Tropical Depression Five did not become Tropical Storm Edouard until August 22. By the next day it had gotten stronger and it was Hurricane Edouard at this point. \nHurricane Edouard strengthened fast, peaking as a category 4 hurricane on from August 24 - 28. After this, it weakened slightly, back to a category 3 hurricane. It turned to the north and repeated this but did not again re-strengthen into a category 4 hurricane. On September 2, Hurricane Edouard passed only 90 miles to the south of Massachusetts. By the next day Hurricane Edouard had died. \nEdouard killed 2 people and caused around $3.5 million in damage.\nHurricane Fran.\nFran started on August 23 as Tropical Depression Six. It slowly got stronger because Hurricane Edouard was near it. The depression became Tropical Storm Fran on August 27. Fran became a hurricane on August 29, weakened back to a tropical storm on August 30, and became a hurricane again on August 31. Hurricane Fran did not get much stronger until it began on a track more to the north. By September 5, it made landfall in Cape Fear, North Carolina as a category 3 hurricane. It died on September 8. Fran caused the deaths of 26 people and caused $3.2 billion in damage.\nTropical Storm Gustav.\nOn August 26, Tropical Depression Seven started. It slowly grew and became Tropical Storm Gustav. It headed northwest and did not get any stronger because of the large size of Hurricane Fran and wind shear. Wind shear also caused in to die on September 2.\nHurricane Hortense.\nHortense started on September 3 as the eighth tropical depression in 1996 in the Atlantic. It slowly strengthened, becoming Tropical Storm Hortense on September 7, four days later. As a tropical storm, it passed into the Leeward Islands and entered the Caribbean Sea. Continuing to slowly strengthen, it became Hurricane Hortense on September 9. Hurricane Hortense made landfall on the southwestern part of Puerto Rico. This resulted in $155 million in damage and the deaths of 18 people. It also moved along the coast of Dominican Republic, which killed 3 people. \nIt soon re-entered the Atlantic Ocean, and it quickly strengthened. By September 13, it had become a 140 miles per hour, category 4 hurricane. Hortense started moving faster, but weakened at the same time. Finally, by September 15 it had made another landfall in Nova Scotia. In Nova Scotia, there was $3 million in damage. Hurricane Hortense died on later on September 15.\nHurricane Isidore.\nIsidore started on September 24 a few hundred miles south of Cape Verde. It headed westward and later peaked as a category 3 hurricane. Hurricane Isidore began heading north after it became a category 3 hurricane. Isidore weakened and died on October 1. \nOther Storms.\nThe 1996 Atlantic hurricane season had 4 tropical storms, 3 hurricane, 6 major hurricanes and 1 possible storm.\nUnused storm names.\nThere were 8 unused names in 1996 they include:\nRetirement.\nIn the spring of 1997 the following names got retired: \"Cesar, Fran and Hortense\" and there are replaced by \"Cristobal, Fay and Hanna\" for the 2002 season."}

It made landfall on Florida in early June 2007. It was the second Atlantic named storm of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season. Barry formed in the Gulf of Mexico and moved toward the northeast, reaching top wind speeds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h). It then weakened and first reached land near Tampa Bay, Florida. Barry quickly weakened after wind shear blew away most of the thunderstorms. Barry moved up the East Coast of the United States and by June 5, it was taken over by an even bigger storm.\nRain from Barry in the Cuban province of Pinar del R\u00edo hurt three people and damaged 55\u00a0houses. In Florida, Barry caused heavy rain in an area that had been in drought. Flooding and wet roads killed two people in traffic accidents. Rough seas killed one surfer in Pinellas County, Florida. In Florida and Georgia, the rain helped firefighters fight wildfires. Damage from the storm was minor.\nStorm History.\nOn May 29, a weather system in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula created a small area of thunderstorms over the Yucat\u00e1n Channel. The thunderstorms got stronger near the weather system. By May 30, clouds from the area reached from Nicaragua to the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. Another weather system, called a tropical wave, created a storm on May 30. The next day, a cyclone formed inside the system. The storm moved towards the north-northeast, and slowly gained strength. More thunderstorms formed near the center, and the system became a tropical depression. A tropical depression is a type of storm.\nThe depression developed an area of squalls (sudden, violent storms with wind and rain). A Hurricane Hunters airplane flew into the area to collect information about the cyclone. At the beginning, the tropical depression looked to be both a tropical and subtropical cyclone. On June 1, the National Hurricane Center named the storm \"Tropical Storm Barry\". Barry was now 235\u00a0miles (375\u00a0km) to the west of Key West, Florida. Barry moved quickly towards the north. On June 2, it reached its strongest with winds of 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h).\nAfter Barry reached its maximum strength, strong wind shear removed much of the thunderstorms from the tropical cyclone. The center of the system then increased in length, and it began to weaken. At 1400\u00a0UTC on June 2, Barry made landfall near Tampa, Florida while it was at tropical depression status. As Barry moved inland, it weakened more. Later that day, the National Hurricane Center said that Barry had died out over northeastern Florida. What was left of Barry continued to move northeast. On June 3, it moved onto shore again, this time in South Carolina. Late on June 4, the extratropical system entered New England. Late on June 5, what was left of the cyclone was taken over by a larger weather system, near the border of the U.S. state of Maine and the Canadian province of Quebec.\nPreparations.\nWhen Barry was named as a tropical storm, the National Hurricane Center sent out a tropical storm warning for the west coast of Florida from Bonita Beach through Keaton Beach. Also, a tropical storm watch was issued from Keaton Beach, northward to Saint Marks. An inland tropical storm warning was also sent out for inland parts of Charlotte, Citrus, DeSoto, Hardee, Hernando, Highlands, Lee, Levy, Manatee, Pasco, Pinellas, Polk, Sarasota, and Sumter counties. The storm increased the risk of rip currents, so officials told swimmers to stay out of the water until the storm left the area. A tornado watch was sent out for the southern part of the state, but it was removed after the storm lost strength.\nAfter becoming an extratropical cyclone, National Weather Service offices sent out flood watches for parts of: South Carolina, eastern North Carolina, southeastern Virginia, and southeastern Maryland.\nFlood watches were also sent out for: southeast Pennsylvania, northern Delaware, northern New Jersey, east-central New York, southern New England. \nA wind advisory was sent out for parts of Georgia.\nImpact.\nFlorida.\nBarry caused heavy rain in Florida, the most rain being 6.99\u00a0inches (178\u00a0mm) at Palm Beach International Airport. Other areas reported over 3\u00a0inches (75\u00a0mm) of rain. The rain helped to get rid of drought conditions. It also helped in fighting bad wildfires across the state.
