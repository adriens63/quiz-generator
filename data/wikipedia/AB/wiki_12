He was better known by his ring name Gorilla Monsoon. He is known for his professional wrestling run as a super-heavyweight main eventer. He is also known for being the voice of the World Wrestling Federation as a commentator and backstage manager during the 1980s and 1990s. He also served as the on-screen WWF President. \nIn honor of Monsoon, the staging area behind the entrance curtain at an event, a position which Monsoon established and where he could often be found during WWF shows late in his career, is named the Gorilla Position. On June 9, 1994, he was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by Jim Ross.\nDeath.\nOn October 6, 1999, Monsoon died of heart failure brought on by complications of diabetes at his Willingboro Township, New Jersey home. In a tribute which aired on WWF television after his death, McMahon described Marella as \"one of the greatest men I have ever known.\" Monsoon's death was acknowledged by WCW commentator Tony Schiavone (at Bobby Heenan's request) on the October 11, 1999 episode of WCW Monday Nitro, even though Monsoon had never worked for WCW. Heenan said: \"Gorilla will be sadly missed. Now he was one big tough man. He was a decent honest man. And we're all gonna miss him very much. And you know the pearly gates in heaven? It's now gonna be called 'the Gorilla position.' Goodbye, my friend.\" He was interred next to his son, Joey Marella, at Lakeview Memorial Park in Cinnaminson, New Jersey."}

Sometimes structural coloration is combined with pigments: for example, peacock tail feathers are pigmented brown, but their structure makes them appear blue, turquoise, and green, and often they appear iridescent.\nEnglish scientists Robert Hooke and Isaac Newton were the first who observed structural coloration. Thomas Young described its principle a century later and called it wave interference. Young described iridescence as the result of interference between reflections from several surfaces of thin films, combined with refraction as light enters and leaves such films. The geometry then determines that at certain angles, the light reflected from both surfaces adds (interferes constructively), while at other angles, the light subtracts. As a result, different colors appear at different angles."}

It was part of the War of the Fourth Coalition. It was fought between the French and the Prussians. The battle was a victory for Napoleon of France and he conquered Prussia.\nPrelude.\nIn 1806 the Fourth Coalition was formed by Great Britain, Sweden, Russia, and Prussia against Napoleon and France. Napoleon invaded Prussia in the fall. Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel commanded the Prussians at Jena-Auerstadt. He was 71 years old while his field commanders were in their 60s. The Prussian army was still using tactics and training of Frederick II of Prussia. Its greatest weakness was its staff organization. Most of the divisions were poorly organized and did not communicate well with each other. Napoleon's army was experienced and well led. The armies met at Jena-Auerstadt on October 14, 1806.\nArmies.\nThe Prussian army was split into three forces \nThe French Army at Jena was made up of 150,000 men total-\nAt Auerstadt the French forces were Louis Nicolas Davout's III Corps and Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte's 1 Corps.\nBattle of Jena.\nThe first French movements were to attack the Prussian flanks. Once in position, Marshal Ney attacked without orders. At first Ney's attack was successful, but he was soon cut off and under attack by the Prussians. Napoleon sent Marshal Lannes to help out. The French center was left weak, however, Napoleon deployed the Imperial Guard in the center and kept the Guard under his direct command. The rescue worked and Ney units were able to retreat. The Prussians did not take the initiative and attack. At 1 P.M. Napoleon made his move. The French flanks pushed hard against the Prussian flanks, and the French center attacked the Prussian center. The flank attacks worked and Prussians fled. They lost 10,000 men, 15,000 men were taken prisoner and 150 cannons were lost.\nThe Battle of Auerstadt.\nMarshal Davout's III Corps was at the small village of Auerstedt. The Duke of Brunswick attacked with 60,000 men. However, the Prussians made piecemeal attacks, and the French held them off for 6 hours. Brunswick was mortally wounded and Prussian command broke down. The French destroyed the last Prussians assault and won the battle.\nAftermath.\nAt the end of the day Napoleon still did not know what was going on. Instead of directing his corps commanders he took charge himself. He forgot to send orders to several of his corps. He thought he had defeated the entire Prussian army when in fact he had only partially defeated them. There was still a large Prussian army of about 100,000 who were not in the battle. Napoleon didn't think Davout had completely beaten the Prussians and said \"tell your marshal he is seeing double\", a reference to Davout's bad eyesight. Davout was made Duke of Auerstadt. The French Army marched into Berlin and then peace terms were signed between France and Prussia."}

The power stroke happens when a phosphate that n broken off gets released from the myosin. This makes the myosin change shape so that it pulls against the actin.

It looks like a wild cat but has no wild DNA in its gene pool. The Ocicat is spotted like a wild cat but is tame and has the behavior of a domestic animal. It got its name because it looks like an ocelot. The breed started accidentally by mating Siameses and Abyssinians. Later, American Shorthairs (silver tabby cats) were added to the mix. This gave the breed their silver color, bone structure and patterns. Now, the Ocicat is a popular breed all over the world.\nAppearance.\nThere are twelve fur coat colors accepted for the Ocicat breed: tawny, chocolate and cinnamon, blue, lavender and fawn. As well, all have a shade of silver: black silver (ebony silver), chocolate silver, cinnamon silver, blue silver, lavender silver and fawn silver. Ocicats have eyes shaped like almonds. They have large strong bodies, legs with dark markings, and oval shaped paws. The eyes are usually rimmed with dark fur. These cats have dark spots all over their fur that are darker than their background color. The Ocicat's large, muscled body gives them a look of power and strength.\nBehavior.\nMost Ocicats are friendly and are not shy. This makes them good family pets. Most can also get along well with other animals. Their mood and actions are similar to those of a dog. Most can be trained to fetch toys, walk on a leash, come when called, and other dog-related tricks. Some even like the water. They are playful and like toys very much. So these pets need attention from their owners.\nHistory.\nThe first breeder of Ocicats was Virginia Daly, in Michigan, who tried to breed an Abyssinian-pointed Siamese in 1964. Her kittens looked like Abyssinians. But when they were later mated, there was not only an Abyssinian-pointed Siamese, but a spotted kitten,Tonga. The breeder's daughter, nicknamed Tonga an 'ocicat'. Tonga was sold as a pet, but his parent cats had more spotted kittens. This began the Ocicat breed. Other breeders then also did the same steps. They mated Siamese cats to Abyssinians, and then those cat descendents to Siameses to get Ocicat kittens. The Ocicat was accepted in The Cat Fanciers' Association and was first shown for championships in 1987. "}

The first automobile, a three-wheeled vehicle, was powered by a steam engine. \nHistory.\nThe steam carriage was invented in 1769 by Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot, a French engineer. It was a large three wheeled vehicle that used coal to make steam in a boiler. The boiler was mounted in front which made the vehicle unstable.\nIn the United States, about the time of the American Civil War, a number of inventors were working on steam-powered cars. In England about 1868 J. H. Knight had created a very successful design of steam car. In 1883 in France, Jules-Albert de Dion and Georges Bouton began building steam cars. In 1886 Ransom E. Olds was producing a steam car in the US. In 1899 the Stanley brothers, Francis and Freelan began making the famous Stanley Steamers.\nAdvantages and disadvantages.\nSteam engines in cars have a great amount of torque. With all this torque they can accelerate very quickly. Because the torque is available over a broad range of speeds, a transmission wasn't needed. They could also carry heavy loads with ease. The speed of a steam car is controlled by the throttle alone and the engine never stalls. Steam cars had fewer moving parts than gasoline powered cars. Also steam cars are very quiet.\nA major disadvantage is that a steam car has to \"fire up\" its boiler (has to get up to operating temperature). This can take as much as 20 minutes before the car can move. In the winter there was the added problem of water freezing. The open-cycle steam engine in cars and steam locomotives could not go far without adding water. The water turned to steam, which was lost when it exited the engine. Steam condensers were added to these cars later. This converted the steam back to water. It was too late; by then steam cars had lost out to cars with internal combustion engines."}

Types of bones is the most important statistic. The completeness statistics for \"Dreadnoughtus schrani\" are as follows:\nThe specimen was probably not fully grown at the time of its death. The histology of its humerus, shows a lack of an outer layer of bone found only in fully-grown vertebrates. There is a lot of fast-deposited or still-growing bone tissue. Therefore, the specimen was still growing at the time of its death. It is unknown how large this individual would have grown if it had lived a full life.\nEstimates.\nAs a matter of basic science, the estimates of dimensions such as the mass (weight) of extinct animals are very rough figures. To avoid the pretence of spurious accuracy. we only give rounded figures here. Moreover. all the skeletons are incomplete, which means that even length (the easiest dimension to estimate) cannot be given exactly. Published estimates by scientists are just that: \"estimates\". Estimation is an approximation given when information is not clear or is incomplete. It is like making an educated guess.\nIt is usual for estimates of mass (weight) to vary between experts.

It is also a method of looking at historical data that deals with issues such as auditing, tracing of data, loading speed and resilience to change.\nData Vault Modeling focuses on several things. First, it emphasizes the need to trace where all the data in the database came from. Each row has extra attributes that describe where the data came from, and at what time it was loaded. This feature lets auditors find the source of the values.\nData vault modeling does not distinguish between data that conforms to the business rules and data that does not. The data that does not conform is generally called \"bad data\". Dan Linstedt, who developed the technology, said that a data vault modeling stores \"a single version of the facts\". In other data warehouse modeling schemes, the data warehouse generally stores \"a single version of the truth\", data that does not conform to the business rules is removed. \nBecause data vault modeling stores the source of the data separately from the data itself, it can cope with change in the business environment. It does this by explicitly separating structural information from descriptive attributes.\nFinally, Data Vault is designed to enable parallel loading as much as possible, so that very large implementations can scale out without the need for major redesign."}

It was developed at IBM in the 1970s. The development of SQL ran in parallel. QBE was developed for those users who only use databases occasionally, and who do not want to learn a complex language such as SQL. \nWith Query by example, users are presented with a visual schema of the database, which they edit with a special editor. When they are done, a parser translates their actions into a query in a regular query language such as SQL. Behind the scenes, it is this statement that is actually executed. With a suitable front-end, the user does not need to remember the details of a query language. The user will be able to select tables and columns more quickly, for example by clicking on them, rather than typing their names. This will improve productivity.\nIn the context of information retrieval, QBE has a somewhat different meaning. The user can submit a document and ask for \"similar\" documents to be retrieved from a document database. Similarity search is based comparing document vectors (see Vector Space Model).\nToday, many database systems have front-ends that resemble QBE. "}

He wished to become the second Alexander. He took the title \u2018Sikander-i-Sani\u2019. He banned drinking of alcohol in open in his kingdom. \nMilitary Campaigns.\nAla-ud-din Khalji first conquered Gujarat and Malwa. In 1301 he conquered Ranthambore. In 1303 he captured Chittor. Then he sent a large army headed by his general Malik Kafur to South India. Malik Kafur defeated the Yadavas, Kakatiyas, Hoysalas and the Pandyas. He also took away a lot of wealth. Around the end of his reign, his empire was as large as that of Ashoka the Great (274 BC\u2013232 BC).\nEconomic Measures.\nKhalji needed money to keep a large army. The main sources were taxes. The land tax was fixed according to the fertility of the land. The land tax in the fertile Ganga-Yamuna doab was one-half of the produce. He kept a strict check on the nobles. A group of officers were kept to discourage corruption. He introduced a system of auditing accounts.\nHe introduced a market control policy in which he reduced the price of day to day items such as sugar, oil, cloth etc. Shop owners had to pay the amount fixed by Ala-ud-din Khalji. Officials were appointed to check the shop owners. Whoever was caught cheating, was punished. This allowed Khalji to pay a low salary to the soldiers.\nArmy Reforms.\nWith money available to him he maintained a large army. He paid his soldiers in cash. He even started branding horses ( Dagh). This was to prevent the substitution of good horses with low quality horses. He even kept a description of all soldiers in his army (Chehra). He posted spies throughout the empire to prevent rebellions."}

Walker. He and his partner Amzi L. Barber bought the rights to manufacture the steam car built by the Stanley brothers. They called the car the Locomobile. In 1904 the company began producing gasoline-powered cars and continued in business until 1929. \nEarly history.\nFrancis E. Stanley and Freelan O. Stanley had invented a steam car. In 1899 they purchased a bicycle factory in Watertown, Massachusetts and began building their cars. John B. Walker, the owner of Cosmopolitan magazine, offered to buy half the company. The Stanley brothers said no. When Walker came back a few weeks later he offered to buy the whole car company. The brothers thought about it and set the price at $250,000 USD. The set the price high enough they thought nobody would pay it. But Walker did and the two Stanley brothers stayed on to run the factory. Walker's partner was Amzi L. Barber. They called the new company Locomobile.\nWithin a few months Walker and Barber had a disagreement and split the company. Walker took his half and formed a new company in Tarrytown, New York. He called his car 'the Mobile'; a Stanley Steamer with his logo on it. With poor sales Walker closed his company in 1902. Barber kept the Locomobile name and sold 5,200 cars by 1902. The Locomobile steam cars were a little difficult to operate and sometimes had fires. They could only go about 20 miles before needing water. They needed to be warmed up for about 30 minutes before they could be driven. By 1904 only about 200 cars were sold. Locomobile sold the patents and the design for their steam car back to the Stanley brothers. By 1904 Locomobile had switched to making gasoline cars.\nLuxury cars.\nAt about the same time Locomobile switched over to making gasoline powered cars, Barber left the business. His son-in-law, J.J. Albright, took over as company president. Inventor Andrew Riker became the lead designer and was responsible for the new gasoline engines.\nThe 1904 5-passenger touring car used an Inline-four engine that was water-cooled engine that produced about 16 horsepower. At the time it cost $4,500. In 1905 Locomobile entered cars in Auto racing. It was in 1908 they won the Vanderbilt Cup. A car that won a race gained an excellent reputation. They advertised the Locomobile as \u201cEasily the Best Built Car in America.\u201d They continued to improve their car. In 1922 Locomobile was acquired by the Durant Motor Company. But their cars continued to be made under the name Locomobile. They continued to build their reputation for making high performance luxury cars. In 1929 the company fell victim to the Great Depression and closed its doors."}

Neighbouring plant cells are therefore separated by a pair of cell walls. Although cell walls are permeable to small soluble molecules, plasmodesmata allow direct, regulated, intercellular transport of substances between cells.\nSimilar structures connect animal cells.

In a medieval context, the word \"clerk\" meant \"scholar\". Now almost everyone can read and write, but the term 'clerk' still correctly applies to whole professions such as accountants, lawyers and civil servants. There is such a person as the Clerk of the House of Commons, and every court in England has a legally qualified clerk. Their job is to keep the records, and run the behind-the-scenes business. "}

He is one of the major figures in abstract expressionism, and a leading \"color field\" painter.\nNewman was born in New York City, the son of Jewish immigrants from Poland. He studied philosophy at the City College of New York and worked in his father's business making clothing. He later made a living as a teacher, writer and critic. From the 1930s on he made paintings said to be in an expressionist style. He later destroyed all these works.\nThroughout the 1940s he worked in a surrealist vein before developing his mature style. This has areas of pure color separated by thin vertical lines, or \"zips\" as Newman called them. In the first works featuring zips, the color fields are variegated, but later the colors are pure and flat. Newman himself thought that he reached his fully mature style with the Onement series (from 1948). The zips define the spatial structure of the painting, while simultaneously dividing and uniting the composition.\nNewman died of a heart attack in New York City. He was unappreciated as an artist for much of his life, being overlooked in favour of more colorful characters such as Jackson Pollock. Some critics wrote admiringly about him, but it was not until the end of his life that he began to be taken seriously. He was, however, an important influence on many younger artists."}

She was the only Gettysburg civilian killed directly during the Battle of Gettysburg. The house where she was killed is now a museum called the \"Jennie Wade House.\"\nEarly life.\nWade was born in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. The house where she was born still stands. When she was a young woman, she and her mother worked as seamstresses. They lived in a house on Breckenridge Street. Wade's father was a tailor. He lived in a psychiatric hospital.\nJack Skelly.\nWade may have been engaged to marry Johnston Hastings \"Jack\" Skelly. He was an officer in the Union Army. His picture was found in her pocket after her death. Skelly was wounded in the Second Battle of Winchester. He died from his injuries on July 12, 1863. He did not know that Wade had died days earlier. Skelly and Wade were childhood friends. Only one letter between the two survived the war. There was nothing in it about a romantic relationship.\nBattle of Gettysburg.\nThe first day of the Battle of Gettysburg was July 1, 1863. Early in the morning, Wade and others went to the house of Wade's sister, Georgia McClellan. They planned to help Georgia with her five-day-old baby.\nMcClellan's house was at 528 Baltimore Street. That was between the armies of the North (the Union) and the South (the Confederacy). The house was hit by 150 bullets during the battle. An artillery shell went through the roof. It did not explode. It stayed where it fell for the next 15 years.\nIn the early morning of July 3, 1863, Wade was in the kitchen of her sister's home. She was making biscuits and bread for Union soldiers. A bullet came through two doors and hit Wade. It went through her left shoulder blade and through her heart. It stopped in her corset. She was killed instantly. Nobody knows which side fired the shot. Some writers say it was an unknown Confederate soldier. Jennie Wade was the only Gettysburg civilian killed directly during the Battle of Gettysburg.\nThree Union soldiers found Wade's body almost right away. They told the rest of her family. The family took shelter in the cellar. Wade's body was placed in a coffin that was meant for a Confederate officer. She was buried in the back yard of her sister's house. On July 4, Wade's mother finished making the bread from the dough that Wade had prepared. In January 1864, Wade's body was moved to the cemetery of the German Reformed Church on Stratton Street in Gettysburg.\nNewspaper accounts.\nWade received much attention from newspaper writers after her death. Most writers called her a heroine. Some writers did not have good things to say about her. She was accused of having visitors late at night. Other writers said that she was too friendly with Confederate soldiers.\nMonument.\nIn November 1865, Wade's body was buried in the Evergreen Cemetery in Gettysburg near Jack Skelly. Gettysburg resident Anna M. Miller designed a monument to Wade. It was put in the cemetery in 1900. This monument includes a Flag of the United States that flies around the clock. The Betsy Ross House in Philadelphia is the only other site devoted to a woman that has a flag flying at all times."}

The breed is a combination of the serval and the domestic cat. It is a hybrid feline developed by crossing a domestic cat with a serval for a number of generations.\nThe bodies of Savannahs are long and leggy. When a Savannah is standing, its hind-end is often higher than its shoulders. The small head is taller than wide, and it has a long, slender neck. The backs of the ears have vivid markings, very clear in the first illustration. This is inherited from the serval cat. In the wild this lets kittens know where the mother is heading. In grass the kits can jump up to get a sight of their mothers' ears. This is important because servals can cover a lot of territory very quickly.\nServal cats can jump over 9 feet high from a standing start. Savannahs also jump high, but how high depends on the individual. They sometimes jump on top of doors, or onto shelves. They love the water. They have very few health issues. They make a hissing noise that sounds like a snake. Overall, they are active and intelligent. \nThe most serval-like cats are the F1 hybrids. Most later crosses are Savannah to Savannah. That, and outcrosses to other breeds, make the cats less distinctive: see second illustration.\nThese cats are not allowed in Hawaii, Alabama, and some other U.S. states. They are banned from Australia. The reasoning is that their extra size and capability might put even more of its precious native animals at risk."}

It has a short \"bobbed\" tail about one-third to one-half the length of a normal cat's tail. This is because of a genetic mutation that affects the way their tail develops. This mutation also happens with the Manx cat. \nThe American Bobtail looks like the Japanese Bobtail, but they are not in the same cat breed family. The genetic mutations for their bobbed tails are different because the gene for the American Bobtail's tail is dominant and the Japanese Bobtail's is recessive.\nAppearance.\nAmerican Bobtails can have either short or long-haired fur coats. Their coat is shaggy instead of fluffy. They can have any color of eyes and coat. They look like a \"wild\" tabby cat. Their eyes are almond shaped. They have a long and strong body. Their tail is short, but the end of it can be seen above their back. It can be straight or curved, slightly knotted or may have bumps. These cats take two to three years to grow from kittens into adult cats.\nBehavior.\nAmerican Bobtails are playful and have a lot of energy. They are friendly and are not shy. These cats are intelligent. Some have been clever enough to escape from rooms and cages with closed and latched doors. Since they are playful and want attention, they will beg for it by meowing or just by hopping into laps. \nHistory.\nAn urban legend says that Bobtail cats began by cross mating a domestic tabby cat and a wild bobcat. Their unusual tail is really an accidental genetic mutation in the cat world. It may be related to the Manx gene, which is also dominant. The first Bobtail cat's parents were a short-tailed brown tabby cat male named Yodie and a seal point Siamese female in the late 1960s. This cat was born in Arizona near an American Indian reservation. Yodie's family breed was not known. It was thought to have been a bobcat and domestic cat hybrid because of its stubby tail. \nThe breed was first recognized by The International Cat Association in the United States, in 1989."}

This temperature rises and falls according to the strength of radiation given off by the sun, the distance from the earth to the sun, and the tilt of the Earth's axis of rotation. However, the recent change between glacial and inter-glacial states that occurs on a circa 100,000 year (100 ka) timescale, does not correlate well with these factors. This is known as the 100,000 year problem.\nDue to variations in the Earth's orbit, the amount of insolation varies; there are periods of around 21,000, 40,000, 100,000, and 400,000 years. Variations in the amount of solar energy drive changes in the climate of the Earth, and are recognised as a key factor in the timing of start and termination of glaciations. Looking at strata, isotope analysis can be performed. One of the most precise methods consist in using Oxygen-18. The amount of oxygen 18 mainly depends on the amount of ice that can be found and on the temperature of the planet. \nThere are different hypotheses to explain the phenomenon:"}

He was drafted with the 106th overall pick by the Boston Bruins in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft.\nOn November 24, 2007, Sobotka played in his first NHL game in a 2-1 loss to the New York Islanders.

The population was 1,136 at the 2010 census. The Katy Trail, a 225-mile long bike path, passes through Marthasville. Because of the many wineries from here east to Defiance, Marthasville is considered to mark one end of the \"Missouri Rhineland\".\nHistory.\nDaniel Boone and his family came to the area later known as Marthasville in 1799. At the time there was only a French trading post there called LaCharette. Flanders Callaway and his wife Jemima Boone (Daniel and Rebecca's daughter), built a house just outside the present city limits. In 1804 the Lewis and Clark Expedition camped here near LaCharette. On their return 20 September 1806 they were greeted by the area residents, the first civilization they had seen since leaving. Rebecca Boone died in 1813 at Jemima\u2019s home and was the first burial in the family cemetery of the Bryans and Boones (now Marthasville cemetery).\nIn 1817 the city of Marthasville was established by Dr. John Young of Kentucky. He named it after his wife Martha. A year later Montgomery County was formed with Marthasville being the only town. In 1833 the area became Warren County.\nThe original graves of Daniel Boone and his wife Rebecca were located there. In 1845, Boone's remains and those of his wife Rebecca were dug up and taken to Kentucky for reburial. Resentment in Missouri about the removal of the bodies grew over the years. A legend was that Boone's remains never left Missouri. A modern forensic anthropologist believes the body removed from Missouri was probably a black slave and not Daniel Boone.\nIn 1850, during the California Gold Rush, a number of people left Marthasville to find gold. The group was led by one of Daniel Boone's grandsons, M. Jackson Lamme. Others in the group were also descendants of Boone. They settled in California and have many descendants there today.\nIn 1892, The Missouri, Kansas and Eastern Railroad ran through Marthasville. It was taken over by the Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railroad (MKT) in July of 1893.\nWinemaking.\nDuring the 1800s the area was settled by winemakers and workers from Germany. This part of the Missouri River Valley has become known as the Missouri Rhineland. The wines from this part of Missouri soon gained a worldwide reputation. At the 1851 Vienna World Exposition, Missouri wines took 8 of the 12 gold medals. French winemakers took notice and started importing the Norton/Cynthiana vines into France. But they were infected with a louse called Phylloxera. The louse had no effect on the Missouri rootstock, but in France it destroyed almost all of France's grapes. Two Missourians found a cure for the blight and the French vines were saved."}

If Rick stands in a room and points to his friend Sally, then Rick is a pointer whose value is Sally's location. A programmer must \"dereference\" the pointer to retrieve the object it points to. Pointers do not take up much memory (RAM). Copying a pointer to a large object is faster than copying the large object itself because only the location needs to be copied, instead of the whole object.\nUses of Pointers.\nPointers are used in linked lists.

He made the first flight from Australia to New Zealand. In another famous flight, he flew from Australia to London, England, in ten and a half days, which was a new record at that time.\nEarly Life.\nSmith was born on February 9, 1897, in Hamilton, Brisbane (the capital city of Queensland, a state in Australia). He went to school at St. Andrew\u2019s Cathedral Choir School and Sydney Technical High School. When he turned 16, Smith became an apprentice at Colonial Sugar Refining Co. Ltd., where he got training in engineering.\nMilitary Career.\nIn 1915, Smith joined the 1st Australian Imperial Force (AIF), the main branch of the Australian Army that fought outside of Australia in World War I. In the AIF he was a sapper (someone who builds and repairs roads and bridges) and a motorcycle dispatch rider (someone who delivers important messages).

She was known for her involvement with female immigrant welfare in Australia. She was named a saint of the Church of England. Her day is May 16 in the Calendar of saints.\nEarly life.\nCaroline Jones was born in Northampton, England. She came from a very large family. Her father, William Jones, had been married four times. All his previous wives had died in childbirth. Caroline was William's sixteenth child and the youngest of the seven who lived. William died when Caroline was six years old. His death left the family with little money. She lived with her family at 11 Mayorhold. In 1822, when Caroline was 22, she married Archibald Chisholm. Archibald was a Roman Catholic. He was ten years older than she was. He served with East India Company Army. It is believed that Caroline converted to her husband's faith at this time. They were married at the Anglican Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Northampton. They were married from 1832 to 1877.\nIndia.\nArchibald returned to his regiment in Madras, India in January 1832. Caroline joined him 18 months later. When she saw the bad behaviour of some of the girls, she asked the Governor of Madras to help her set up a school. In 1834, Caroline founded the Female School of Industry for the Daughters of European Soldiers. The school provided a practical education for the girls. They were taught to read and write and about religion, cooking, housekeeping, and nursing. Caroline gave birth to two sons, Archibald and William, and she followed her husband around in his travels.\nAustralia.\nIn 1838, Archibald became sick. Rather than go back to England, they moved to Australia because they thought the weather would be good for his health. They sailed for Sydney. They arrived there in October 1838. They settled at Windsor. On trips to Sydney, Caroline and Archibald learned about the hard lives of emigrants arriving in the colony. They were particularly concerned for the young women who were arriving without any money. The women did not have any friends or family or jobs to go to. Many women ended up working as prostitutes. Archibald returned to his regiment in 1840. He encouraged his wife to continue her philanthropic efforts.\nHelping the needy.\nChisholm originally set up a home for young women in Sydney, and she organised other homes in several rural centres. These places soon started to help families and young men. During the seven years Caroline was in Australia, she placed over 11,000 people in homes and jobs. People came to see her as a very good person. Two Legislative Council Committees asked her to give evidence for them. Caroline carried out her work in New South Wales without taking money from individuals or individual organisations because she wanted to act independently and did not want to be dependent upon any religious or political group. The girls and families Caroline helped came from different backgrounds and held different religious beliefs. Money was raised for the homes through subscription. Archibald was released from the Army because of his poor health and returned to Australia in 1845.\nIn 1849, with the support of a few important people, Caroline founded the Family Colonization Loan Society from her home. The Society's aim was to lend people who wanted to go to Australia half the cost of the fare, the emigrant finding the other half of the cost, which was to be refunded after two years in Australia. By 1854, the Society had helped more than 3,000 people travel to Australia. Caroline had an audience with Pope Pius IX, who gave her a Papal Medal and bust of herself.\nLater years.\nThe family moved to Victoria. Chisholm continued to help the poor, mainly around Ballarat and the Goldfields. After some time, she became very ill and the family had to move back to Sydney in 1858. Her health improved at the end of 1859.\nArchibald senior took the younger children back to England in 1865. Archibald junior went with his mother back home in 1866. Caroline died on March 25, 1877, in Highgate, United Kingdom. Archibald died in August of that year. Five of their eight children survived."}

Although Hargraves was very famous and rich, he lived so lavishly that he became broke by 1860. many people cant understand why he came to Australia to start the gold rush \"I Know Why?\" he wanted to be sick lad and roll kids in asutralia he was the foundr of the meat pie and this is why he came to austrlia many people beilive there is a dopple ganger on this planet\nEarly life.\nHargraves' mother (Elizabeth Nee Whitcombe) and father (John Edward Hargraves) when he was a early age of 5 his parents sent him away because he shot his horse \nEngland, when edward was 9 his parents where evictied and came to england to go find there son little did they know he was working on a ma for his town \nat a very young age people took notice of his work and sent him to a popular village in England BABABA he worked hard to create maps for the town. \nAGE 21 he went to clorfornia to look into starting a town when digging to create the foundation edward found gold and started to write a poertr of his joy he published his work and many people around the world took notice. \nhe flew with virgin austrlia to Victoria to build his town in a own know area this was the founding start of tne victorian god rush Many eople h=where sniped 3292882942482090381@*##*#0 Over 100 p=gold nuggets where found \nAchievements.\nHargraves' main achievement was discovering a large amount of gold, starting the gold rush of Australia. He believed that the geography of Bathurst was the same as California, so he began his search for gold there. John Lister, who had already found gold in California, helped Hargraves to find gold in Australia. \nThe two of them travelled to Summerhill Creek, where Hargraves first discovered gold. After the government found out about Hargraves\u2019 discovery, they appointed him \u2018Commissioner of Land\u2019. They rewarded him with 10,000 pounds and a life pension, in exchange for the gold he discovered. The government of New South Wales made the announcement that gold was discovered on May 22, 1851. Hargraves was also responsible for conducting the gold mining in Ballarat, when the gold rush became more popular.\nBetween the years of 1853-1854, Hargraves travelled back to England, rich from his findings. When he was in England he met Queen Victoria and wrote a book (published in 1855) called \"Australia and its Gold Fields\". Hargraves lived such a luxurious life that he was soon very poor. Hargraves travelled back to Australia, seeking the help of the government to help with his financial situation, but no one he asked would give him money. \nHargraves had two sons and three daughters. He died in Sydney in 1891."}

He was one of the first people to come up with the idea of breeding endangered species in captivity, so they would not go extinct (die out) in the wild. He was also the first person to succeed in breeding platypuses in captivity.\nFleay now has a wildlife park named after him in Queensland.\nHe died on 7 August 1993 aged 85.\nEarly life.\nFleay was born in Ballarat, Victoria, in Australia. His parents were William and Maude Fleay.\nAs a young child, David became interested in the Australian bush and its wildlife at an early age. His mother was also interested in these things, but his father did not want David to spend his time thinking about Australian wildlife.\nFleay was educated at Pleasant Street State School and Balart Grammar School. His first job was at his father\u2019s pharmacy.\nFleay then taught at Balart Church of England Grammar School until 1927, when he moved to Melbourne. There, he taught while studying for a Bachelor of Science degree and a Diploma of Education at Melbourne University.\nWhile at Melbourne University, Fleay met a science student named Mary Sigrid Collie. They got married in 1931.\nCareer.\nIn the early 1930s, Fleay went to Tasmania to try to capture Thylacines (also called Tasmanian tigers). He was not able to find any Thylacines in the wild. So he decided to run a breeding program with Thylacines in zoos. He wanted to breed more Thylacines to save them from becoming extinct. But the Tasmanian government did not allow Fleay to run this program. We now know that the last definite sight of a Thylacine in the wild was in 1930. By 1936, the last Thylacine living in a zoo died, and this species was extinct.\nBy 1934, Fleay was very well known as a 'wildlife man.' He was chosen to design and direct a new section at the Melbourne Zoo. He worked there for three years, and achieved some important scientific 'firsts.' He was the first person to breed, in captivity, several types of endangered animals, including:\nIn 1958, Fleay brought three platypuses to New York's Bronx Zoo. Later that year, he was given some money by the New York Zoological Society, and used it to build a new, better platypusary (a place to take care of platypuses) in West Burleigh, Australia.\nFleay wrote a book called \"Living with Animals\", which was published in 1964.\nAwards.\nFleay was given many awards for his work and research.\nIn 1960, he was named a member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (MBE), an award given by the British King or Queen to reward work in the arts and sciences.\nFleay was chosen to be an Associate of the Queensland Museum in 1978.\nIn 1980, he was named a member of the Order of Australia (AM), an award given by the Queen of Australia for doing important work in Australia.\nLater Life &amp; Death.\nFleay's wife, Mary, died in 1987. Later, Fleay got married again. He had a daughter and two sons.\nFleay died in Brisbane, Australia, at the age of 85. In an obituary, the New York Times wrote: \"As a conservationist, [Fleay] was outspoken and, as \"The Daily Telegraph\" put it, he 'strove to preserve native Australian fauna in the days when even koala bears were slaughtered in vast numbers for their fur.'\""}

Flynn's portrait is on one side of the Australian 20 dollar note.\nEarly life.\nJohn Flynn was born in Moliagul in\u00a0Victoria,\u00a0Australia\u00a0on November 25, 1880. His parents were Thomas Eugene Flynn and Rosetta Forsyth. Because his mother died while giving birth to him, John was raised by his mother\u2019s sister in Sydney, Australia. \nWhen he was 16, Flynn decided that he wanted to become a Presbyterian minister and study theology (religion) at the University of Melbourne. In 1911, he finished his training for the Presbyterian ministry and was officially ordained into the Presbyterian Church. He went to live and work in the Australian Outback, where many people had little access to medical care because they lived so far from large cities, doctors, and hospitals. In 1912, he created the Australian Inland Mission, which gave medical, spiritual, and other care to people in the Outback. \nCareer.\nFor many years, Flynn worked to get the support and money he needed to start an organization that would bring doctors and medical care by plane to people living in the Outback. With the help of Alf Traeger, Flynn was able to create the Aerial Medical Service in 1928.

By 1939, every state in Australia had an Aerial Medical Service. Now called the Royal Flying Doctor Service, the organization still exists today and has 21 bases throughout every part of the country. It provides medical care to 290,000 people every year.\nAwards.\nFlynn became an officer of the Order of the British Empire on June 3, 1933."}

Previously a network of separate regional television channels, ITV currently operates in England, Wales, Scotland and the Channel Islands. From 2001 until 2013, the channel was called ITV1.\nIn 2004, Granada acquired Carlton Communications to form ITV plc.\nHistory.\nITV was launched in 1955 as the second TV channel in the United Kingdom.\nITV name was only used in England, Wales, Southern Scotland and Isle of Man until Channel Television adopted the name in January 2006, bringing it to the Channel Islands.\nThe licencees that used the ITV1 brand were Anglia Television, Border Television, Carlton Television, Central Independent Television, Channel Television, Granada Television, ITV Wales &amp; West, London Weekend Television, Meridian Broadcasting, Tyne Tees Television, Westcountry Television and Yorkshire Television.\nThe network production arms of the ITV-plc owned licencees have been gradually combined since 1993 to eventually form ITV Studios.\nRegions.\nIn the English regions, the channel has been known from 2006 until 2013 as ITV1 and since 14 January 2013 as ITV at all times.\nThe \"ITV Wales\" name is not used overnight.\nAreas without full ITV branding:\nBranding and Idents.\nIndependent Television (1955\u20131989).\nFrom the founding of the ITV Network in 1955, it was known nationally as Independent Television (later ITV) and locally by the regional branding of the local ITV franchise operator.\nITV (1989\u20131998).\nIn 1989, the ITV Association set out a basic presentation package with a new \"ITV\" logo, which included idents, promotions and general on and off air design, and an edit of this package was designed for each franchise holder. The dual branded idents included a large \"ITV\" logo, in which the \"V\" contained part of the franchise's logo, and written below the logo in a grey capitalised font was the name of the regional broadcaster. However, only half of the regional broadcasters opted to use the package, which had completely failed by 1997.\n\"TV from the Heart\" (1998-2001).\nIn 1999, another second common presentation (once again using dual-branding with the ITV name) was launched, under the theme, \"TV from the Heart\".\nITV1 (2001\u20132013).\nBy 2001, all eleven franchises of England and Wales were owned by either Granada plc or Carlton Communications, and a new common name, ITV1, was launched on 11 August 2001 to coincide with digital channel ITV2. The existing \"Hearts\" idents were simply re-edited.\nIn January 2006, the channel adopted a new on-air look to coincide with the launch of ITV4, designed mainly to improve cross-channel promotion across ITV's multichannel presence. The new logo brought ITV1, ITV2 and ITV3 in line with ITV4's, and had been observed on various billboard ads in the UK when the new identity was first used on-screen on 16 January 2006.\nITV Day.\nIn 2005, ITV plc introduced a new channel branding called ITV Day, used to identify ITV1 between 9.25am and 6.00pm. ITV Day was treated as a separate entity to ITV1 and featured its own presentation set focusing using the colours of red, orange and yellow and featured scenes of typical \"daytime\" activities. Promotions were used in a similar format to ITV1, and all daytime programmes advertised within ITV1 hours were branded with the ITV Day logo. A similar \"UTV Day\" branding was adopted in Northern Ireland.\n2013 rebranding.\nOn 15 November 2012, it was announced that as part of a major rebranding, ITV1 was renamed back to its previous name, ITV. In addition to this, ITV had a new colour-changing logo stylised as handwriting, that changed colour depending on the programming it is used on. It was revealed that the logo had green and purple for \"Dancing on Ice\", and green and brown for \"I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!\". The overhaul is linked to ITV's attempt to cut costs, curb debts and reduce the company's reliance on advertising. This overhaul of their brand affected all ITV plc channels and online services. The rebrand went live on 14 January 2013, at the same time as the other ITV channels. Also for the first time in its history, a digital on-screen graphic (DOG) was introduced.\nSpin-off channels.\nITV has two spin-off channels, ITV HD and ITV +1, which both launched in 2009. ITV HD was originally available in 2006 for a while for some programming, but officially launched in 2009.\nAvailability outside the UK.\nITV (as UTV) is widely available in the Republic of Ireland on cable and MMDS, as well as being received directly in areas bordering Northern Ireland, or in coastal areas from Wales (as ITV Wales). It is also available on cable and IPTV in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. Since 27 March 2013, ITV London has been offered by British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS) to members of HM Forces and their families around the world, replacing the BFBS3 TV channel, which already carried a selection of ITV programmes."}

Eusebio.\nThe demonym of Pasig is \"Pasigue\u00f1o\".\nHistory.\nThe Augustinians built Pasig City in 1572 making it one of the oldest towns in the Philippines. But after the Government combined Pasig with Rizal making Pasig the capital of Rizal province in June 1901. It became the provincial capital, not until Metro Manila is formed in 1975 by the Metro Manila Commission making Pasig a city. Soon the government considered Pasig as a highly urbanized city. President Fidel V. Ramos signed it to become a law after five months on December 8, 1994. Pasig residents approved this through a referendum on January 21, 1995. \nPublic Services.\nPasig recognizes the efforts of its residents and students, that\u2019s why they give back school supplies yearly to public school students. Examples are free complete PE uniforms from shirts to rubber shoes and even complete school uniforms. The public government also enhanced the PCIST (Pasig City School of Science and Technology) by adding more school courses and programs such as auto mechanic, soldering, welding, refrigerator fixing and more. They have also expanded the Rainforest park in Pasig that is also for the youth of the city. The expansion of RAVE (Rainforest Adventure Experience) such as adding libraries, music halls, auditoriums and a sports center. \nBecause the Pasig River is rich in water lilies, the government made livelihood programs of making baskets from water lilies and other recycled items. The government also made a market for these businesses to give them a regular place to trade. They also provided jobs for smart and hardworking students who wanted to work on their summer vacation. SPES (Summer Program for Employment Services) program accepts 2,000 students who apply and is given an opportunity to work for the government. The government also gives job fairs 4 times a year for people who are having a hard time to look for a job with the college courses that they studied. \nTourist Sites.\n One of the most famous parks in Metro Manila is RAVE or the Rainforest Adventure Experience. It opened in 1977 and was known as the Pasig Central Park. Right now the park consists of many different recreational activities and a mini zoo. It also has an Olympic-sized swimming pool which is offered for the citizens of Pasig with a lower price. Pasig is also known for the place Ace Water Spa. The spa is an all-weather indoor place that has a pool that uses water for helping people feel better. \nThe Philippines is also known to have huge malls around the country and because Pasig is the center of Metro Manila it can access a lot of nearby malls and the malls inside its city itself such as SM Megamall. SM Megamall is the 3rd biggest SM (Shoe Mart) mall in the country owned by the famous . \u201cKapitolyo\u201d is also famous for its neighborhood filled with restaurants and bars that can be found in East Capitol Drive of the \u201cBarangay\u201d. Pasig is also occupied by food parks that a person with good taste in food will enjoy. As for historical places, one famous place is the \u201cBahay na Tisa\u201d which translates to House of Chalk. It is called House of Chalk because of its white walls. In Martial Law this house was used for two party lists of the Martial Law to hold their meetings and gatherings. The first Marian Parish is also found in the middle of Pasig called Immaculate Conception Cathedral. It was founded by the Augustinians (the founders of Pasig as well) in 1572. Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary was the original a female patron of the church. "}

His career as a frontiersman involved four chief occupations: mountain man, guide, Indian agent, and officer in the United States Army. He helped to open the American West to settlement. In his day, he was a celebrity known far and wide in the United States. In modern America, he is remembered as a folk hero.\nCarson began his adult life in 1829 as a mountain man. He trapped beaver about ten years for the fur trade. During these years, Carson became an \"Injun killer\" he was forced to kill many Native Americans to protect himself from attack, theft, and murder. Carson became known as one of the greatest of \"Injun killers\" through novels, newspaper accounts, and other media. When the fur trade died out in the 1840s, Carson looked for other work.\nIn 1842, Army officer John Charles Fr\u00e9mont hired Carson to guide him on three separate expeditions into the West. All three expeditions involved mapping and describing remote and uncharted areas of the West. These expeditions were hugely successful. Fr\u00e9mont's reports to the government made Carson a frontier hero, and were read by many Americans. Carson became a celebrity throughout the United States. His adventures were turned into stories that were published in paper-covered books called dime novels. These cheap, popular books made him more famous than ever.\nIn 1853, Carson became an Indian agent in northern New Mexico. His job was to keep the Utes and Apaches at peace. He saw to it that they were treated with honesty and fairness, and that they got the food and clothing they needed. In 1861, the American Civil War broke out. Carson resigned his position as Indian agent, and joined the Union Army. As a lieutenant, he led the New Mexico Volunteer Infantry. His forces fought Confederates at Valverde, New Mexico. The Confederates won this battle, but were later defeated. Most of Carson's time in the Army was passed training recruits.\nCarson served in several wars and battles with the southwestern tribes during this time. He rounded-up and moved Apaches and Navajos from their homelands to government lands called reservations. Carson was promoted to the rank of colonel. Late in life, he was promoted to brigadier general, and given command of Fort Garland in Colorado. After about two years. Carson left the military because of illness. He died in 1868 at Fort Lyon, Colorado. He is buried in Taos, New Mexico, next to his third and last wife Josefa Jaramillo.\nPersonal description.\nCarson was described by his contemporaries as a \"small, stooped-shoulder\" man with brown to red hair, blue eyes, and a strong but spare frame. He was said to be about 5\u00a0foot 7\u00a0inches. He was a modest gentleman. Most of his contemporaries were astonished that such a slight, inconspicuous man had accomplished so much among the Native Americans and wild animals on the western frontier.\nGeneral William Tecumseh Sherman.\nIn 1847, General William Tecumseh Sherman met Kit Carson in Monterey, California. Sherman wrote: \"His fame was then at its height, ... and I was very anxious to see a man who had achieved such feats of daring among the wild animals of the Rocky Mountains, and still wilder Indians of the plains ... I cannot express my surprise at beholding such a small, stoop-shouldered man, with reddish hair, freckled face, soft blue eyes, and nothing to indicate extraordinary courage of daring. He spoke but little and answered questions in monosyllables.\"\nColonel Edward W. Wynkoop.\nColonel Edward W. Wynkoop wrote: \"Kit Carson was five feet five and one half-inches tall, weighed about 140\u00a0pounds, of nervy, iron temperament, squarely built, slightly bow-legged, and those members apparently too short for his body. But, his head and face made up for all the imperfections of the rest of his person. His head was large and well-shaped with yellow straight hair, worn long, falling on his shoulders. His face was fair and smooth as a woman's with high cheekbones, straight nose, a mouth with a firm, but somewhat sad expression, a keen, deep-set but beautiful, mild blue eye, which could become terrible under some circumstances, and like the warning of the rattlesnake, gave notice of attack. Though quick-sighted, he was slow and soft of speech, and posed great natural modesty.\"\nLieutenant George Douglas Brewerton.\nLieutenant George Douglas Brewerton made one coast-to-coast dispatch-carrying trip to Washington, D.C. with Carson. Brewerton wrote: \"The Kit Carson of my \"imagination\" was over six feet high a sort of modern Hercules in his build with an enormous beard, and a voice like a roused lion ... The real Kit Carson I found to be a plain, simple ... man; rather below the medium height, with brown, curling hair, little or no beard, and a voice as soft and gentle as a woman's. In fact, the hero of a hundred desperate encounters, whose life had been mostly spent amid wilderness, where the white man is almost unknown, was one of Dame Nature's gentleman ...\"\nCarson's illiteracy.\nCarson was illiterate (he could not read or write). He was embarrassed by this, and tried to hide it. He was impressed by gentlemen who could read and write however. In 1856, he told his life story to an Army officer who wrote it down. Carson told the officer that he left school at an early age: \"I was a young boy in the school house when the cry came, Injuns! I jumped to my rifle and threw down my spelling book, and thar it lies.\"\nCarson enjoyed having other people read to him. He liked the poetry of Lord Byron. Carson thought Sir Walter Scott's long poem, \"The Lady of the Lake\" was \"the finest expression of outdoor life.\" He also liked a book about William the Conqueror. The Conqueror's favorite oath was \"By the splendor of God\". Carson used this oath as his own, and was known to never have used anything stronger.\nCarson learned to write \"C. Carson\" late in life. It was very difficult for him. He made his mark on official papers, and this mark was then witnessed by a clerk. Carson easily spoke English, Spanish, and French. He could speak many Native American languages, including Navajo, Apache, and Comanche. He also knew the sign language used by mountain men. Very late in life, he learned to read to a certain extent, and to recognize his name when it appeared in print.\nEarly life.\nKit Carson was born in Kentucky, but his family moved to Missouri when he was a baby. In Missouri, the family was in danger from Native American attacks, and they were forced to find ways to protect themselves. After his father's death in 1818, Kit's mother remarried. The boy became a wild teenager. His stepfather put him to work in a saddle-making shop in Franklin, Missouri.\nKentucky.\nCarson was born in a log cabin at Tate's Creek, Madison County, Kentucky on Christmas Eve 1809. His parents were Lindsay (or Lindsey) Carson and his second wife, Rebecca Robinson. Lindsay had had five children by his first wife Lucy Bradley, and ten more children by Rebecca. Kit was their sixth.\nLindsay Carson had a Scots-Irish Presbyterian background. He was a farmer, a cabin builder, and a veteran of the American Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. He also fought Native Americans on the frontier. Two fingers on his left hand were shot away in a battle with the Sauk and Fox tribes.\nMissouri.\nThe Carsons moved to Boone's Lick, Howard County, Missouri when Kit was about one year old. They knew the Daniel Boone family. Lindsay's oldest son William married Boone's grand-niece, Millie Boone, in 1810. Their daughter Adaline became Kit's favorite playmate.\nDefenses against attacks.\nThe Carson family was always in danger of Native American attacks in Missouri. They had to be alert. Cabins were \"forted\". This means that they had tall fences built around them called stockades. These stockades made the people inside safe from attack. During the day, men worked in the fields near the cabins. Some men had weapons, and protected the workers. These men were ready to kill any Native American who attacked. Carson wrote in his \"Memoirs\": \"For two or three years after our arrival, we had to remain forted and it was necessary to have men stationed at the extremities of the fields for the protection of those that were laboring.\"\nDeath of Lindsay Carson.\nOne day in 1818, Lindsay Carson was clearing a field when a tree limb fell on him. He was killed instantly. Kit was about 8 years old. His mother took care of her children alone for four years. They lived in great poverty. She then married Joseph Martin, a widower with several children.\nApprenticeship.\nCarson did not get along with his stepfather. He became a wild and uncontrollable teenager. His stepfather apprenticed him to David Workman, a saddle maker in Franklin, Missouri. Kit was a boy in his middle-teens. He wrote in his \"Memoirs\" that Workman was \"a good man, and I often recall the kind treatment I received.\"\nRunaway.\nCarson did not like making saddles, and ran away from home in 1826. He traveled over the Santa Fe Trail with mountain men. In 1829, he joined with trapper Ewing Young on a trek to the Rocky Mountains. He learned much from Young about trapping.\nRunaway turned mountain man.\nFranklin, Missouri was at the eastern end of the Santa Fe Trail. This was a starting point for many settlers heading west. Kit heard wonderful stories about the west from the mountain men returning to the East. Kit did not like making saddles. In August 1826, he ran away from home, and went west with the mountain men. They traveled over the Santa Fe Trail to Santa Fe, New Mexico. They reached their destination in November 1826. Kit passed the winter in Taos, New Mexico with Mathew Kinkead, a mountain man and neighbor from Missouri. Taos would become Carson's home.\nWorkman posts a reward.\nWorkman put an advertisement in a local newspaper back in Missouri. He wrote that he would give a one cent reward to anyone who brought the boy back to Franklin. No one claimed the reward. It was a bit of a joke, but Carson was free. The advertisement featured the first printed description of Carson: \"Christopher Carson, a boy about 16 years old, small of his age, but thick set; light hair, ran away from the subscriber, living in Franklin, Howard county, Missouri, to whom he had been bound to learn the saddler's trade.\"\nBetween 1827 and 1829, Carson worked as cook, translator, and wagon driver in the southwest. He also worked at a copper mining|mine near the Gila River in southwestern New Mexico. In later life, Carson never mentioned any women from his youth. There are only three specific women mentioned in his writing: Josefa Jaramillo, his third and last wife; a comrade's mother in Washington, DC; and Mrs. Ann White, a victim of Native American atrocities.\nTrappers Ewing Young and Thomas Fitzpatrick.\nIn August 1829, the nineteen year old Carson joined trapper Ewing Young and his mountain men on a fur-hunting expedition to Arizona and California. This was Carson's first professional job as a mountain man. Carson received much experience as a trapper on this expedition. Young is credited with shaping Carson's early life in the mountains.\nCarson returned to Taos in 1829, and joined a wagon train rescue party. Although the perpetrators had fled the scene of atrocities, Young had the opportunity to witness Carson's horsemanship and courage. Kit passed the winter of 1827-1828 as Young's cook in Taos. Carson joined another expedition led by Thomas Fitzpatrick in 1831. Fitzpatrick and his trappers went north to the central Rocky Mountains. Carson would hunt and trap in the West for about ten years. He was known as a reliable man and a good fighter.\nMountain man.\nCarson traveled through many parts of the American West gathering furs. Men at this time wore hats made of beaver fur. Carson trapped beaver for the fur trade. He sometimes worked with famous mountain men like Jim Bridger and Old Bill Williams.\nCarson's career.\nCarson's career as a mountain man began in 1829 when he joined Ewing Young's trapping expedition to the Rocky Mountains. Mountain men worked mostly in the Rocky Mountains. They worked for themselves, or sometimes with a partner or two, or for a large trading organization like the Hudson Bay Company.\nA mountain man's life was not easy. He sometimes had to walk into deep, cold water to get a trapped beaver. He then had to remove the hide with the fur (the pelt). The mountain man kept these beaver pelts for many months. He then sold them in St. Louis, Missouri, or at a mountain man \"rendezvous\". With the money he collected, he bought fish hooks, flour, tobacco, and the other things he needed for life in the mountains.\nHazards and hardships.\nThe mountain men faced many hazards including biting insects, bad weather, and diseases of all kinds. There were no doctors in the lands where mountain men worked. These men had to set their own broken bones, tend their wounds, and nurse themselves. Native Americans were an ever-present danger. Even a friendly Native American could turn at once into an enemy. Most mountain men had a Native American wife or mistress. The mountain man's main food was buffalo. The mountan man dressed in deer skins that had stiffened after being left outdoors for a time. This suit of stiffened deer skin gave him some protection against the weapons of his enemies.\nCarson and the grizzly bears.\nGrizzly bears were one of the mountain man's greatest enemies. Carson wrote in his \"Memoirs\" that he was hunting an elk alone in 1834. Two grizzly bears chased him up a tree. One bear tried to make him fall by shaking the tree. The bear was not successful, and finally went away. Carson returned to his camp as fast as he could. He wrote in his \"Memoirs\" that this incident was the scariest moment of his life: \"[The bear] finally concluded to leave, of which I was heartily pleased, never having been so scared in my life.\"\n\"Rendezvous\".\nMountain men met every year in the second quarter of the 19th century for an event called a \"rendezvous\". The first \"rendezvous\" was held in 1825. These events were held in remote areas of the West like the banks of the Green River in Wyoming. The mountain men had a good time at these lively events. Native Americans often joined the gathering. Everyone played card games, danced, sang, told stories, made jokes, and had much to eat and drink. Sometimes mountain men married Native American women at a \"rendezvous\". The last rendezvous was held in 1840.\nDecline of the fur trade.\nAbout 1840, the fur trade began to drop off. Well-dressed men in London, Paris, and New York City wanted silk hats instead of beaver hats. In addition, the mountain men had very nearly killed almost every beaver in North America. Trappers were no longer wanted or needed. Mountain man Robert Newell told Jim Bridger: \"[W]e are done with this life in the mountains done with wading in beaver dams, and freezing or starving alternately done with Indian trading and Indian fighting. The fur trade is dead in the Rocky Mountains, and it is no place for us now, if ever it was.\"\nMeat hunter at Bent's Fort.\nCarson knew it was time to find other work. He wrote in his \"Memoirs\" that \"Beaver was getting scarce, it became necessary to try our hand at something else.\" In 1841, he was hired at Bent's Fort in Colorado. This fort was one of the greatest buildings in the West. Hundreds of people worked or lived there. Carson hunted buffalo, antelope, deer, and other animals to feed these hundreds of people. He was paid one dollar a day. He returned to Bent's Fort several times during his life to again provide meat for the fort's residents. In April 1842, Carson went back to his childhood home in Missouri. He made this trip to put his daughter Adaline in the care of relatives.\nIndian fighter/\"Injun killer\".\nCarson found much pleasure in killing Native Americans. He did not respect them, and thought those who committed outrages like murder, theft, and rape deserved the worst punishment possible. Carson's thoughts about Native Americans softened over the years, as he found himself more and more in their company. He became an Indian agent and a spokesman for the Utes.\nFirst years as an \"Injun killer\".\nCarson was nineteen when he set off with Ewing Young's expedition to the Rocky Mountains. In addition to furs and the company of free-spirited, rugged mountain men, he sought action and adventure. He found what he was looking for in killing and scalping Native Americans. Carson probably killed and took the scalp of his first Native American when he was nineteen years old, during Ewing Young's expedition. Carson was known to most 19th century Americans as an \"Injun killer\", chiefly through newspaper accounts and dime novels. Many of these works gave Carson's deeds and life a romantic cast. Excitement and thrills were heightened through exaggeration.\nCarson hated Native Americans, especially those who had committed crimes such as rape, theft, and murder. He believed Native Americans could not be trusted, and should be punished. Mountain men often had to kill Native Americans to save their own lives. The young Carson's brutal and vicious notions about Native Americans is sometimes considered his greatest moral failing. Carson never killed Native American women and children though. He believed a brave man would never do this, and he scorned those men who did.\nCrow tribe.\nCarson's \"Memoirs\" are replete with stories about Native American encounters with the memoir writer. In January 1833, for example, warriors of the Crow tribe stole nine horse from Carson's camp. Carson and eleven other men found the Crow camp after dark, and quietly led the horses away. Those men who owned the horses wanted to return to their own camp at once. Although Carson and two other men had not lost any horses, these three wanted to punish the Crows. Carson and his men fired their guns into the Crow camp, killiing almost every Crow. Carson wrote in his \"Memoirs\": \"During our pursuit for the lost animals, we suffered considerably but, the success of having recovered our horses and sending many a redskin to his long home, our sufferings were soon forgotten.\"\nBlackfoot nation.\nThe Blackfoot nation was a hostile tribe, and posed an ever-present threat to Carson's safety. A Blackfoot warrior once injured Carson in the shoulder. This was the worst injury he received in his life. He hated the Blackfeet, and killed them at every opportunity. Historian David Roberts has written: \"It was taken for granted that the Blackfeet were bad Indians; to shoot them whenever he could was a mountain man's instinct and duty.\" The Blackfeet did not like whites. They were convinced whites were trying to take over their hunting grounds. In addition, the Blackfeet wanted the valuable horses owned by the whites.\nCarson had several encounters with the Blackfeet, but his last battle with the Blackfeet took place in spring 1838. He was traveling with about one hundred mountain men led by Jim Bridger. In Montana territory, the group found a teepee with three Native American corpses inside. These three had died of smallpox. Bridger wanted to move on, but Carson and the other young men wanted to kill the Blackfeet.\nThey found the Blackfoot village, and killed ten Blackfeet warriors. The Blackfeet found some safety in a pile of rocks, but were driven away. It is not known how many Blackfeet died in this incident. Historian David Roberts writes: \"[I]f anything like pity filled Carson's breast as, in his twenty-ninth year, he beheld the ravaged camp of the Blackfeet, he did not bother to remember it.\" Carson wrote in his \"Memoirs\" that this battle was \"the prettiest fight I ever saw.\"\nCarson modifies his beliefs.\nCarson's notions about Native Americans softened over the years. He found himself more and more in their company as he grew older. His thoughts about Native Americans became more understanding and more humane. He urged the government to set aside lands called reservations for their use. As an Indian agent, he saw to it that those under his watch were treated with honesty, fairness, and clothed and fed properly. Historian David Roberts believes his first marriage to an Arapaho women named Singing Grass, \"softened the stern and pragmatic mountaineer's opportunism.\"\nManifest Destiny.\nIn killing Native Americans, Carson was making America safe for settlers heading west to build their homes, farms, and villages. He had the approval of the United States government and its citizens. In addition, Senator Thomas Hart Benton, the United States Congress, and President James K. Polk had developed and were working under a concept called Manifest Destiny. This concept stated that it was the will of God that the United States push America's western boundary to the Pacific Ocean at all costs. Manifest Destiny spurred the movement of American settlers to the West.\nPersonal life.\nCarson was married three times. His first two wives were Native Americans. His third wife was Mexican. He was the father of ten children. Carson never wrote about his first two marriages in his \"Memoirs\". He may have thought he would be known as a \"squaw man\". Such men were not welcomed by polite society.\nWaanibe.\nIn 1836, Carson met an Arapaho woman named Waanibe (Singing Grass) at a mountain man \"rendezvous\". This \"rendezvous\" was held along the Green River in Wyoming. Singing Grass was a lovely young woman. Many mountain men were in love with her. Carson was forced to fight a duel with a French trapper named Chouinard for Waanibe's hand in marriage. Carson won, but he had a very narrow escape. The French trapper's bullet singed his hair. The duel was one of the best known stories about Carson in the 19th century.\nCarson married Singing Grass. She was a good wife. She tended to his needs, and went with him on his trapping trips. They had a daughter named Adaline (or Adeline). Singing Grass died after giving birth to Carson's second daughter. This child did not live long. In 1843, she fell into a kettle of boiling soap in Taos. Waanibe died about 1841.\nCarson's life as a mountain man was too hard for a little girl. In 1852, he took Adaline to live with his sister Mary Ann Carson Rubey in Saint Louis, Missouri. Adaline was taught in a school for girls called a seminary. Carson brought her West when she was a teenager. She married and divorced. In 1858, she went to the California goldfields. Adaline died in 1860.\nMaking-Out-Road.\nIn 1841, Carson married a Cheyenne woman named Making-Out-Road. They were together only a short time. Making-Out-Road divorced him in the way of her people. She put Adaline and all Carson's property outside their tent. Making-Out-Road left Carson to travel with her people through the west. Historian David Lavender writes: \"[Making-Out-Road] was spoiled. She had put most of the Cheyenne bachelors and half the white men at the fort in a slow burn, and they had showered her with gifts. Now that they were married she expected Kit to keep her in expensive foofaraw (finery). She ignored her household chores and neglected little Adaline ...\"\nJosefa Jaramillo.\nAbout 1842, Carson met Josefa Jaramillo. She was the beautiful daughter of a wealthy Mexican couple living in Taos. Lewis Garrard wrote: \"Her style of beauty was of the haunting, heartbreaking kind ... such as would lead a man with a glance in his eye, to risk his life for one smile.\" Carson wanted to marry her. He left the Presbyterian Church for the Catholic Church. Thirty-three-year old Carson married 14-year-old Josefa on February 6, 1843. They had eight children.\nTravels with John Charles Fr\u00e9mont.\nIn 1842, Carson was returning from Missouri after depositing his daughter Adaline with relatives when met John C. Fr\u00e9mont aboard a steamboat on the Missouri River. Fr\u00e9mont was a United States Army officer in the Corps of Topographical Engineers. Carson had very little money at this time. Fr\u00e9mont hired Carson at $100 a month as a guide. Fr\u00e9mont wrote, \"I was pleased with him and his manner of address at this first meeting. He was a man of medium height, broad-shouldered, and deep-chested, with a clear steady blue eye and frank speech and address; quiet and unassuming.\"\nFirst expedition, 1842.\nIn 1842, Carson guided Fr\u00e9mont across the Oregon Trail to Wyoming. This was their first expedition into the West. The purpose of this expedition was to map and describe the Oregon Trail as far as South Pass, Wyoming. A guidebook and maps would be printed for settlers. Fr\u00e9mont praised Carson in his government reports. Because of that, Carson became well known across the United States. He became the hero of many cheap, popular books called dime novels.\nSecond expedition, 1843.\nIn 1843, Fr\u00e9mont asked Carson to join his second expedition. Carson did. He guided Fr\u00e9mont across part of the Oregon Trail to the Columbia River in Oregon. The trip's purpose was to map and describe the Oregon Trail from South Pass, Wyoming to the Columbia River. They also traveled to Great Salt Lake in Utah. The men then headed to California. They suffered from bad weather in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The men were saved by Carson's good judgement and his guiding skills. They found American settlers who fed them. The expedition then went into California. This was illegal and dangerous. California was Mexican territory. The Mexican government ordered Fr\u00e9mont to leave. Fr\u00e9mont finally went back to Washington, DC. The government liked his reports, but ignored his illegal trip into Mexico. Fr\u00e9mont was made a captain. The newspapers called him \"The Pathfinder\".\nDuring this expedition, Fr\u00e9mont went to the Mojave Desert. Fr\u00e9mont's party met a Mexican man and boy. The two told Carson that Native Americans had ambushed their party of travelers. The male travelers were killed; the women travelers were staked to the ground, sexually mutilated, and killed. The murderers then stole the Mexicans' thirty horses. Carson and a mountain man friend named Alexis Godey went after the murderers. They took two days to find them. They rushed into their camp, killing and scalping two of the murderers. The stolen horses were recovered and returned to the Mexican man and boy. This selfless, disinterested, generous deed brought Carson even greater fame. It confirmed his status as a western hero in the eyes of the American people.\nThird expedition, 1845.\nIn 1845, Carson guided Fr\u00e9mont on their third and last expedition. They went to California and Oregon. Fr\u00e9mont made scientific plans, but the expedition was appeared political in nature. Fr\u00e9mont may have been working under secret government orders. President Polk wanted the province of Alta California for the United States. Once in California, Fr\u00e9mont started to rouse the American settlers into a patriotic fever. The Mexican government ordered him to leave. Fr\u00e9mont went north to Oregon. He camped near Klamath Lake. Messages from Washington, DC made it clear that President Polk wanted California.\nAt Klamath Lake in southern Oregon, Fr\u00e9mont's party was attacked by about twenty Native Americans on the night of March 6, 1846. Three men in camp were killed. The Native Americans fled after a brief struggle. Carson was angry that his friends had been killed. He took an axe and avenged the death of his friends by chopping away at a dead Klamath's face. Fremont wrote, \"He knocked his head to pieces.\"\nBear Flag Revolt.\nIn June 1846, Fr\u00e9mont and Carson both participated in a California uprising against Mexico called the Bear Flag Revolt. Mexico ordered all Americans to leave California. They did not want to go, and declared California an independent republic. American settlers in California wanted to be free of the Mexican government. The Americans found courage to oppose Mexico because they had Fr\u00e9mont and his troops on board. Fr\u00e9mont wrote an oath of allegiance. He and his men were able to give some protection to the Americans. He ordered Carson to execute an old Mexican man named Berresaya and his two adult nephews. These three were captured when they stepped ashore at San Francisco Bay. They were executed to keep them from taking reports to Mexico about the uprising.\nMassacre.\nMexico ordered Fr\u00e9mont and Carson to leave the area. They left for Oregon. Along the way, Carson and most of the group attacked a Native American village. They killed about 100 villagers. Carson thought that this massacre would discourage Native Americans from attacking white settlers. Fr\u00e9mont heard that the Klamath tribe had killed three of his men. Carson was sorry to have lost his friends. He attacked another Native American village, wrecking it.\nFr\u00e9mont worked hard to the win California for the United States. He became its military governor. Carson took military records to the Secretary of War in Washington, DC. Fr\u00e9mont wrote, \"This was a service of great trust and honor ... and great danger also.\" In 1847 and 1848, Carson made two quick trips to Washington, DC with messages and reports. In 1848, he took news of the California Gold Strike to the nation's capital.\nBooks and dime novels.\nCarson's fame spread throughout the United States with government reports, dime novels, newspaper accounts, and word of mouth. The dime novels celebrated Caron's adventures, but were usually colored with exaggeration. A factual biography was attempted by DeWitt C. Peters in 1859, but has been criticized for inaccuracies and exaggerations.\nDime novels.\nIn 1847, the first story about Carson's adventures was printed. It was called \"An Adventure of Kit Carson: A Tale of the Sacramento\". It was printed in \"Holden's Dollar Magazine\". Other stories were also printed such as \"Kit Carson: The Prince of the Goldhunters\" and \"The Prairie Flower\". Writers thought Carson the perfect mountain man and Indian fighter. His exciting adventures were printed in the story, \"Kiowa Charley, The White Mustanger; or, Rocky Mountain Kit's Last Scalp Hunt\". In this story, an older Kit is said to have \"had ridden into Sioux camps unattended and alone, had ridden out again, but with the scalps of their greatest warriors at his belt.\"\nIndian captive Mrs. Ann White.\nIn 1849, Carson guided soldiers on the trail of Mrs. Ann White and her baby daughter. They had been captured by Apaches. No one paid attention to Carson's advice about a rescue attempt. Mrs. White was found dead. An arrow was in her heart. She had been horribly abused. She may have been passed among the Apaches as a camp prostitute. Her child had been carried away, and was never found.\nA soldier in the rescue party wrote: \"Mrs. White was a frail, delicate, and very beautiful woman, but having undergone such usage as she suffered nothing but a wreck remained; it was literally covered with blows and scratches. Her countenance even after death indicated a hopeless creature. Over her corpse, we swore vengeance upon her persecutors.\"\nCarson discovered a book about himself in the Apache camp. This was the first time that he found himself in print. He was the hero of adventure stories. He was sorry for the rest of his life that Mrs. White had been killed. He wrote in his \"Memoirs\": \"In camp was found a book, the first of the kind I had ever seen, in which I was made a great hero, slaying Indians by the hundreds ... I have often thought that Mrs. White read the same ... [and prayed] for my appearance that she might be saved.\"\n\"Memoirs\".\nIn 1856, Carson told his life story to someone who wrote it down. This book is called \"Memoirs\". Some say Carson forgot dates or got them wrong. The manuscript was lost when taken East to find a professional writer who would work it into a book. Washington Irving was asked, but declined. The lost manuscript was found in a trunk in Paris in 1905. It was later printed. The first biography of Carson was written by DeWitt C. Peters in 1859. The book was called \"Kit Carson, the Nestor of the Mountains, from Facts Narrated by Himself\". When the book was read to Carson he said, \"Peters laid it on a leetle too thick.\"\nMexican-American War.\nThe Mexican\u2013American War was an armed conflict between the United States and Mexico from 1846 to 1848. America won this war. Under The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Mexico was forced to sell the territories of Alta California and New Mexico to the United States.\nWhile Carson was not a member of the United States Army, one of his best known adventures took place during this war. In December 1846, Carson was ordered by General Stephen W. Kearny to guide him and his troops from Socorro, New Mexico to San Diego, California. Mexicans soldiers attacked Kearny and his men near the village of San Pasqual, California.\nThere were too many Mexican soldiers. Kearny knew he would could not win; he ordered his men to take cover on a small hill. Kearny then sent Carson, a naval lieutenant named Beale, and a Native American scout to get help. The three left on the night of December 8 for San Diego. San Diego was away. Carson and the lieutenant removed their shoes because they made too much noise. They walked barefoot through the desert.\nCarson wrote in his \"Memoirs\": \"Finally got through, but had the misfortune to lose our shoes. Had to travel over a country covered with prickly pear and rocks, barefoot.\" By December 10, Kearny believed help would not arrive. He planned to break through the Mexican lines the next morning. That night, 200 mounted American soldiers arrived in San Pasqual. They swept the area and drove the Mexicans away. Kearny was in San Diego on December 12. Carson went back to Taos after the Mexican\u2013American War to start a ranch.\nIndian agent.\nIn 1853, Carson became the United States Indian agent to the Utes. These people lived across northern New Mexico. The Jacarilla Apaches and the Puebloans at the Rio Grande would also come under Carson's watch. Carson's job was to keep the peace between the southwestern tribes, and to hunt down and punish any who committed crimes. Carson was honest and fair as an Indian agent.\nCarson came to realize that the hostilities between white Americans and Native Americans were the result of a great decrease in available wild game. This situation forced the Native Americans into raiding American farms, ranches, and herds of cattle. He also knew that the liquor available in towns and villages led the Native Americans into serious trouble. Carson wanted the government to put aside large areas of land far from white settlements. The lands would be called reservations, and were intended for the use of Native Americans only. He thought the Native Americans should be taught agriculture, but it would prove almost impossible to teach nomadic hunters to settle on one piece of land and farm it. He thought his plans would keep these peoples from becoming extinct. Carson resigned as Indian agent with the outbreak of the American Civil War in April 1861. He joined the Union Army to lead the 1st New Mexico Volunteer Infantry.\nMilitary life.\nIn April 1861, the American Civil War broke out. Carson left his job as an Indian agent, and joined the Union Army. He was made a lieutenant. He led the 1st New Mexico Volunteer Infantry. He trained the new men. In October 1861, he was made a colonel. The Volunteers fought the Confederate forces at Valverde, New Mexico in February 1862. The Confederates won this battle, but were later defeated.\nCampaign against the Apaches.\nOnce the Confederates were driven from New Mexico, Carson's commander Major James Henry Carleton, turned his attention to the Native Americans. The historian Edwin Sabin writes that this officer had a \"psychopathic hatred of the Apaches\". Carleton led his forces deep into the Mescalero Apache territory. The Mescaleros were tired of fighting, and put themselves under Carson's protection. Carleton put these Apaches on a remote and lonely reservation east on the Pecos River.\nCarson disliked the Apaches. He wrote in a report that the Jicarilla Apaches \"were truly the most degraded and troublesome Indians we have in our department ... [W]e daily witness them in a state of intoxication in our plaza.\" Carson half-heartedly supported Carleton's plans. He was tired. He had suffered an injury two years before that gave him great trouble. He resigned from the Army in February 1863. Carleton refused to accept the resignation because he wanted Carson to lead a campaign against the Navajo.\nCampaign against the Navajos.\nCarleton had chosen a bleak site on the Pecos River for his reservation. This reservation was called Bosque Redondo (Round Grove). He chose this site for the Apaches and Navajos because it was far from white settlements. He also wanted these Apaches and Navajo to act as a buffer for any aggressive acts committed upon the white settlements from Kiowas and Comanches to the east of Bosque Redondo. He thought as well that the remoteness and desolation of the reservation would discourage white settlement.\nThe Mescalero Apaches walked 130\u00a0miles to the reservation. By March 1863, four hundred Apaches had settled around nearby Fort Sumner. Others had fled west to join fugitive bands of Apaches. By middle summer, many of these people were planting crops and doing other farm work.\nOn July 7, Carson, with little heart for the Navajo roundup, started the campaign against the tribe. His orders were almost the same as those for the Apache roundup: he was to shoot all males on site, and take the women and children captives. No peace treaties were to be made until all the Navajo were on the reservation.\nCarson searched far and wide for the Navajo. He found their homes, fields, animals, and orchards, but the Navajo were experts at disappearing quickly and hiding in their vast lands. The roundup was a great frustration for Carson. He was in his 50s, tired, and ill. By autumn 1863, Carson started to burn the Navajo homes and fields, and remove their animals from the area. The Navaho would starve if this destruction continued. One hundred eighty-eight Navajo surrendered. They were sent to Bosque Redondo. Life at the Bosque had turned grim. Murders occurred. The Apaches and Navajos fought. The water in the Pecos contained minerals that gave people cramps and stomach aches. Residents had to walk about twelve miles to find firewood.\nCanyon de Chelly.\nCarson wanted to take a winter break from the campaign. Major Carleton refused. Kit was ordered to invade the Canyon de Chelly. It was here that many Navajos had taken refuge. Historian David Roberts writes, \"Carson's sweep through the Canyon de Chelly in the winter of 1863-1864 would prove to be the decisive action in the Campaign.\"\nThe Canyon de Chelly was a sacred place for the Navajo. They believed it would now be their strongest sanctuary. Three hundred Navajo took refuge on the canyon rim at a place called Fortress Rock. They resisted Carson's invasion by building rope ladders, bridges, lowering water pots into a stream, and keeping out of sight. These three hundred Navajo survived the invasion. In January 1864, Carson swept through the 35-mile Canyon with his forces. He cut down the thousands of peach trees in the Canyon. Few Navajo were killed or captured. Carson's invasion however proved to the Navajo that the white man could invade their country at any time. Many Navajo surrendered at Fort Canby.\nBy March 1864, there were 3,000 refuges at Fort Canby. An additional 5,000 arrived in the camp. They were suffering from the intense cold and hunger. Carson asked for supplies to feed and clothe them. The thousands of Navajo were led to Bosque Redondo. Many died along the way. Stragglers in the rear were shot and killed. In Navajo history, this horrific trek is known as The Long Walk. By 1866, reports indicated that Bosque Redondo was a complete failure. Major Carleton was fired. Congress started investigations. In 1868, a treaty was signed, and the Navajo were allowed to return to their homeland. Bosque Redondo was closed.\nFirst Battle of Adobe Walls.\nOn November 25, 1864, Carson led his forces against the southwestern tribes at the First Battle of Adobe Walls in the Texas panhandle. Adobe Walls was an abandoned trading post blown up by its inhabitants to prevent a take-over by hostile Native Americans. Combatants at the First Battle were the United States Army and masses of Kiowas, Comanches, and Plains Apaches. It was one of the largest engagements fought on the Great Plains. The Texas State Library and Archives Commission writes: \"The result of Adobe Walls was a crushing spiritual defeat for the Indians. It also prompted the U.S. military to take its final actions to crush the Indians once and for all. Within the year, the long war between whites and Indians in Texas would reach its conclusion.\"\nThe battle was the result of General Carleton's belief that the Native Americans were responsible for the continuing attacks on white settlers along the Santa Fe Trail. He wanted to punish these thieves and murderers, and brought in Carson to do the job. With most of the Army engaged elsewhere during the American Civil War, the protection the settlers sought was almost nonexistent. They were begging for help. Carson led 260 cavalry, 75 infantry, and 72 Ute and Jicarilla Apache Army scouts. In addition, he had two mountain howitzer cannons.\nOn the morning of November 25, Carson discovered and attacked a Kiowa village of 176 lodges. After the destruction, he moved forward to Adobe Walls. Carson found other Comanche villages in the area, and realized he would face a very large force of Native Americans. A Captain Pettis estimated that 1,200 to 1,400 Comanche and Kiowa began to assemble. The number would swell to possibly 3,000. Four to five hours of battle ensued. When Carson ran low on ammunition and howitzer shells, he ordered his men to retreat to a nearby Kiowa village. There they burned the village and many fine buffalo robes. His Native American scouts killed and mutilated four elderly and weak Kiowas. The retreat to New Mexico was then begun. There were few deaths among Carson's men. General Carleton wrote to Carson: \"This brilliant affair adds another green leaf to the laurel wreath which you have so nobly won in the service of your country.\" The battle is considered by some to be Carson's finest moment, and is thought one of the factors that made the Kiowas and Comanches sue for peace in 1865.\nSome of those who have studied the battle believe Carson was correct in ordering his troops to retreat. Only one Comanche scalp was reported taken by Carson's soldiers. The First Battle at Adobe Walls would be the last time the Comanche and Kiowa forced American troops to retreat from battle. Adobe Walls marked the beginning of the end of the plains tribes and their way of life.\nA decade later, the Second Battle of Adobe Walls was fought on June 27, 1874, between 250 and 700 Comanche and a group of 28 hunters defending Adobe Walls. After a four-day siege, the hundreds of Native Americans withdrew. The Second Battle led to the Red River War of 1874\u20131875, a war that resulted in the final relocation of the Southern Plains Indians to reservations in Oklahoma.\nDeath.\nCarson left the Army on November 22, 1867. He moved his family to a small settlement on the Purgatoire River called Boggsville, Colorado. He had no money. He sold his house in Taos. He wanted to build a ranch. In January 1868, he was made superintendent of Indian Affairs in the Colorado Territory. He was called to Washington, D. C. in February 1868 with Ute chiefs and other men to make a treaty. Carson was seriously ill, and doubted he could make the journey, but he felt a responsibility to the chiefs and made the journey. He asked doctors on the East Coast about his health (they gave him little hope of recovery), and toured New York City, Philadelphia, and Boston. His last photograph was snapped in Boston.\nHe returned home in April 1868. Josefa had given birth to their last child, Josefita. It was not an easy birth. Josefa died within two weeks on April 23, 1868. Carson missed her greatly. His health grew worse. He needed chloroform to ease the pain. Carson made his will on May 15, 1868 at Fort Lyon, and named Thomas Boggs his administrator. Any monies realized from his estate would be used to support his children. Carson had been diagnosed with an aortic aneurysm. The aneurysm broke; Carson's mouth gushed with blood. His doctor and best friend Thomas Boggs were present when he died. Carson's last words were: \"Doctor, goodbye. \"Compadre, ad\u00edos\".\" He died on May 23, 1868 at Fort Lyon, Colorado. He was 58 years old. The wife of an officer offered her wedding dress to line Carson's casket while the women of the fort took the cloth flowers from their hats to decorate his coffin. Carson and Josefa were first buried in Boggsville. The two were disinterred in 1869, and buried in Taos, New Mexico.\nLegacy.\nCarson's home in Taos is today a museum maintained by the Kit Carson Foundation. A monument was raised in the plaza at Santa Fe by the New Mexico Grand Army. In Denver, a statue of a mounted Kit Carson can be found atop the Mac Monnies Pioneer Monument. Another equestrian statue can be seen in Trindad. A national forest in New Mexico was named for Carson as well as a mountain and a county in Colorado. A river in Nevada is named for Carson as well as the state's capital, Carson City. Fort Carson, an army training post near Colorado Springs, was named for him during World War II by popular vote of the men training there.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Carson came under the scrutiny of revisionist historians. Hitherto he had been regarded as an American hero, but the tide turned and he became an arch-villain in the genocidal campaign against the Native Americans. Clifford Trafzer's 1982 \"Kit Carson Campaign: The Last Great Navajo War\" found fault with both Carleton and Carson, but Trafzer completely ignored Carson's many acts and deeds that humanized The Long Walk.\nIn 1992, a young professor at Colorado College was successful in abruptly demanding that a period photograph of Carson be removed from the R.O.T.C. office. In 1992, a tourist told a journalist at the Carson home in Taos, \"I will not go into the home of that racist, genocidal killer.\" In 1973, militants in Taos tried to change the name of Kit Carson State Park. Six years later, Kit Carson Cave near Gallup, New Mexico was the target of vandals, and, in 1990, protestors spray-painted Kit and Josefa's tombstones with the word \"NAZI\". In the 1970s, a Navajo at a trading post said, \"No one here will talk about Kit Carson. He was a butcher.\" In 1993, a symposium was organized to air various views on Carson, but the Navajo spokespeople refused to attend.\nIn time, views of Carson returned to their former glory. David Roberts writes, \"Carson's trajectory, over three and a half decades, from thoughtless killer of Apaches and Blackfeet to defender and champion of the Utes, marks him out as one of the few frontiersmen whose change of heart toward the Indians, born not of missionary theory but of first hand experience, can serve as an exemplar for the more enlightened policies that sporadically gained the day in the twentieth century.\""}

At one time this influence included expansion into foreign territories. Expansionism was a primary objective of most empires, an example being the British Empire. Modern imperialism started in the 15th century when European countries discovered, and fought to claim, the New World. American imperialism began in the 1890s. In 1896 the US annexed the Hawaiian Islands. After the Spanish-American War the US annexed Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines. In 1914 the US completed the Panama Canal. The Roosevelt Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine increased US influence in Latin America. It was the basis for Roosevelt's Big Stick policy. The US evolved from expansionism towards being an influence on world affairs.\namericans deserve all the discrimination they face abroad, there is nothing wrong with discriminating against americans because they are racist themselves"}

He was the founder of the \"Tabulating Machine Company\" that later became IBM.\nHollerith is known as the father of modern machine data processing. The start of automatic data processing systems came with his invention. Programs and data were put in to computer by punched cards in the 1950s and 60s.\nHollerith began working for the United States Census Bureau in the year he filed his first patent application. Titled \"Art of Compiling Statistics\", it was filed on September 23, 1884; U.S. Patent 395,782 was granted on January 8, 1889.\nHollerith built machines under contract for the Census Office, which used them to tabulate the 1890 United States Census in only one year. The previous 1880 United States Census had taken eight years.\nHollerith started his \"Tabulating Machine Company\" in 1896. Major census bureaus around the world leased his equipment and purchased his cards, as did major insurance companies. Hollerith's machines were used for censuses in England, Italy, Germany, Russia, Austria, Canada, France, Norway, Puerto Rico, Cuba, and the Philippines, and again in the 1900 United States Census . To make his system work, he invented the first automatic card-feed mechanism and the first keypunch (that is, a punch operated by a keyboard); a skilled operator could punch 200\u2013300 cards per hour. He also invented a tabulator."}

She was captured by Indians during King Philip's War. She was held in captivity for three months before being ransomed. Six years after her ordeal, she wrote \"The Sovereignty and Goodness of God: Being a Narrative of the Captivity and Restoration of Mrs. Mary Rowlandson\". It was published in 1682. This text is considered an American leader in the literary genre of captivity narratives. It went through four printings in 1682. It was widely read in colonial New England and in England. It is considered the first American \"bestseller.\"\nEarly years.\nMary White was born about 1637 in Somersetshire, England. The family left England sometime before 1650. They settled at Salem in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. In 1653, they moved to Lancaster, Massachusetts. Lancaster was on the Massachusetts frontier. She married Reverend Joseph Rowlandson there in 1656. They had four children between 1658 and 1669. Their first daughter died young.\nIndian attack.\nAt sunrise in February 1676 during King Philip's War, Lancaster was attacked by Narragansett, Wampanoag and Nipmuc Indians. They killed 13 people. At least 24 were taken captive. Many of the captives were injured. Rowlandson and her three children, Joseph, Mary, and Sarah, were among those taken in the raid. Rowlandson's 6-year-old daughter, Sarah, died from her wounds after a week of captivity. For nearly three months, Rowlandson and her children were forced to stay with the Indians. The Indians travelled through the wilderness to carry out other raids. They also wanted to hide from the English militia. Rowlandson suffered very much. She described her sufferings in great detail in her book.\nRansom and later life.\nOn May 2, 1676, Rowlandson was ransomed for \u00a320. The money was raised by the women of Boston. In 1677, Reverend Rowlandson moved his family to Wethersfield, Connecticut. He became pastor in April of that year. He died in Wethersfield in November 1678. Church officials gave his widow a pension of \u00a330 per year. Rowlandson and her children moved to Boston. On August 6, 1679, Rowlandson married Captain Samuel Talcott and took his last name. She died on January 5, 1711. Rowlandson is thought to have written the story of her captivity in Boston. The original manuscript has not survived. It was published both in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and in London in 1682."}

They occur in fresh water and wet soil as terrestrial or aquatic species. They live in every continent except Antarctica. Bladderworts are cultivated for their flowers, which are rather like those of snapdragons and orchids.\nAll \"Utricularia\" are carnivorous and capture small organisms by means of bladder-like traps. Terrestrial species tend to have tiny traps that feed on minute prey such as protozoa and rotifers swimming in water-saturated soil.\nThe traps range in size from 0.2\u00a0mm to 1.2\u00a0cm. Aquatic species, such as \"U.\u00a0vulgaris\" (common bladderwort), have bladders that are usually larger and can feed on water fleas \"(Daphnia)\", nematodes, even tiny fish, mosquito larvae and young tadpoles.\nDespite their small size, the traps are extremely sophisticated. In aquatic species, prey brush against trigger hairs connected to the trapdoor. The bladder, when \"set\", is under negative pressure: when the trapdoor is triggered, the prey, with the water around it, is sucked into the bladder. Once the bladder is full of water, the door closes again. The whole process takes only ten to fifteen thousandths of a second.\nBladderworts are unusual and highly specialized plants. The bladder traps are recognized as one of the most sophisticated structures in the plant kingdom."}

This is to make bribery or intimidation of voters more difficult. Secret ballots are good for many different voting systems. The most basic form may be blank pieces of paper. The voter writes only his or her choice, then places it into a sealed box. The box is emptied later for counting.\nThe French Constitution of 1795 states that \"All elections are to be held by secret ballot\". Britain followed later. The secret ballot was first used in Britain on 15 August 1872 in a by-election. The original ballot box, sealed in wax with a liquorice stamp, is kept at Pontefract museum."}

Originally, they were schools teaching Latin. More recently, they are academically-oriented secondary schools. \nIn the late Victorian era grammar schools were reorganised for secondary education throughout England and Wales. Scotland had developed a different system. Grammar schools were also established in British territories overseas, where they have evolved in different ways.\nThey were described as \"the selective tier of state-funded secondary education in England and Wales\". \nGrammar schools became \"selective\" in the mid-20th century, after World War II. This means they selected applicants whom they thought would get the most out of that kind of education. The selection was done by means of an 11+ test which included an IQ test. This was designed so that it was more based on native ability, rather than taught learning. \nLabour governments in the 1960s and 70s made efforts to replace grammar schools with comprehensive schools. Comprehensive schools were open to children of all abilities, similar to high schools in the United States.\nAs a result, in the 1960s and 1970s some grammar schools became fully independent and charged fees. Many others were abolished or became comprehensive. In both cases, many of these schools kept \"grammar school\" in their names. There are still 164 state-run grammar schools in existence."}

The original group members included Willie \"Sonny\" Killebrew (saxophone), Billy Ellis (flute), Jason \"T.C.\" Bryant (keyboards), Bruno Speight (guitar), John Simpson (bass), James Earl Jones III (drums), and Mary Davis (lead vocals, keyboards). It was originally known as Santa Monica, but later changed its name to The S.O.S. Band- an acronym for Sounds of Success. After listening to its demo and being impressed with their sound, Tabu Records founder Clarence Avant signed the group to its first recording contract.\nIn 1980, the group released its first hit single, \"Take Your Time (Do It Right)\", which was certified platinum and sold over 2 million copies. Its debut album, \"S.O.S.\", went gold and sold over 800,000 copies. Trumpeter, vocalist, and percussionist Abdul Ra'oof joined the band while it was on a world tour.\nIn 1983, the band joined forces with then-new production team of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, who went on to craft a string of R&amp;B hits for the group, which included \"Just Be Good to Me,\" \"High Hopes,\" \"Tell Me If You Still Care,\" \"Borrowed Love,\" \"No One's Gonna Love You,\" \"Just the Way You Like It,\" and \"The Finest.\"\nLead vocalist Mary Davis left the group in 1987 to pursue a solo career, and was replaced by Chandra Currelley beginning with the band's 1989 \"Diamonds in the Raw\" album. They recorded another album with Currelley - 1991's \"One of Many Nights\", which featured a few songs with a guest appearance from a then-unknown Kurupt.\nMore recently, Currelley has been active as an actress and vocalist in Tyler Perry plays and movies. When Davis\u2019s solo career was not as successful as she hoped, she reunited with the band in 1994. Since then, Davis spilt from the remaining members of The S.O.S. Band, with Davis and Speight both touring using the band's name with their versions of the current lineup.\nIn 2013, The S.O.S. Band's entire Tabu Records catalog was reissued, as Tabu licensed their brand and trademark to British-based record label Demon Music Group.\nDiscography.\n\"All albums and singles listed below were issued on Tabu Records.\""}

The female attaches to the fish's tongue, and the male attaches on the gill arches beneath and behind the female. The female parasite destroys the fish's tongue. Then it attaches itself to the stub of what was once the tongue and becomes the fish's new tongue.\nBehavior.\n\"Cymothoa exigua\" gets blood through the claws on its front, causing the tongue to atrophy (wither) from lack of blood. The parasite then replaces the fish's tongue by attaching its own body to the muscles of the tongue stub. \nThe fish is able to use the parasite just like a normal tongue. It appears that the parasite does not cause any other damage to the host fish. Once \"C. exigua\" replaces the tongue, some feed on the host's blood and many others feed on fish mucus. This is the only known case of a parasite replacing the function of a host organ. There are many species of \"Cymothoa\", but only \"C. exigua\" is known to consume and replace its host's tongue."}

She knew Jesse James, the Younger brothers, and other criminals and outlaws. She was convicted of stealing horses in 1883. She was sent to prison. In 1889, she was ambushed in Oklahoma. She died of shotgun wounds. No one knows who killed her.\nEarly life.\nBelle Starr was born as Myra Maybelle Shirley on her father's farm near Carthage, Missouri. Her family called her May. Her father was John Shirley. Her mother was Eliza Pennington. . \nIn the 1860s, Starr's father sold the farm. He moved his family to Carthage. There he bought an inn and livery stable on the town square. May Shirley received a classical education. She also learned to play the piano. She graduated from Missouri's Carthage Female Academy.\nAmerican Civil War.\nThe Union army attacked Carthage in 1864. The Shirleys moved to Scyene, Texas. Legend says that the Shirleys knew a number of Missouri-born criminals, including Jesse James and the Youngers. Starr knew the Younger brothers and the James boys because she had grown up with them in Missouri. People thought that Starr's brother Bud was in favor of the Confederate States of America. He was killed in 1864 by Union troops.\nAfter the Civil War.\nStarr married Jim Reed in 1866. In 1868, their first child was born. Starr was good at using guns. She used to ride sidesaddle to her criminal activities wearing a black velvet riding habit and a feathered hat. She carried two pistols. Cartridge belts were strapped across her hips. Jim Reed started committing crimes. He was wanted for murder in Arkansas. The family moved to California. Starr gave birth to their second child, James Edwin (Eddie), in 1871.\nJim Reed returned to Texas. He was involved with several criminal gangs. He tried farming. He became restless. He was friendly with the Starr clan. This clan was a Cherokee Indian family. They were well known for whiskey, cattle, and horse thievery in the Indian Territory (now Oklahoma). Jim also was involved with his wife's old friends, the James and Younger gangs. \nIn April 1874, an arrest warrant was issued for Starr. People said she was involved in a stagecoach robbery. The robbery had been done by her husband and others. There was no proof she was involved in this robbery. Reed was killed in August of that year in Paris, Texas. He had settled there with his family.\nMarriage to Sam Starr.\nStarr may have been briefly married to Charles Younger in 1878. There is no proof that they were married. In 1880, she married a Cherokee man named Sam Starr. She settled with him in the Indian Territory. There, she learned ways to help the cattle thieves, horse thieves and other criminals. She also hid them from the law. Starr's illegal activities made money. She used this money to free other outlaws from jail.\nIn 1883, Starr and Sam were charged with horse theft. They were tried in Fort Smith, Arkansas. She was found guilty. She spent nine months at the Detroit House of Corrections in Detroit, Michigan.\nIn 1886, she was again charged with theft. This time she was not convicted. On December 17, Sam Starr was involved in a gunfight with Officer Frank West. Both men were killed. After this, Starr stopped being an outlaw.\nUnsolved murder.\nDuring the last years of her life, Starr had relationships with several men. These men had colorful names like Jack Spaniard, Jim French, and Blue Duck. She married a relative of Sam Starr named Jim July Starr. He was about 15 years younger than Starr.\nOn February 3, 1889, Starr was killed in Oklahoma. She was ambushed. She died from shotgun wounds to her back, neck, shoulder, and face. Legend says she was shot with her own double barrel shotgun.\nThere were no witnesses. No one was ever convicted of the murder. Some say the murderer was one of her sharecroppers. He was afraid she was going to turn him in to the police. He was an escaped murderer from Florida. He was tried for Starr's murder. He was found not guilty. The murder of Belle Starr remains unsolved.\nStory becomes popularized.\nStarr's story interested publisher Richard K. Fox. Her story was printed in dime novels and the \"National Police Gazette\". Fox made her name famous with his novel, \"Bella Starr, the Bandit Queen, or the Female Jesse James\". This book was published in 1889. This novel is sometimes cited as a historical reference. It was the first of many popular stories that used her name."}

A red-light district is an area where prostitutes work.\nEarly history.\nThe Heera Mandi was first called the 'Shahi Mohallah' or Royal Neighborhood in the 17th century. It was called that because many princes and nobles of the Mughal dynasty used to come there. At that time there were only \"Tawaifs\" (dancing girls) and courtesans there. They were there to amuse the people. Later, some women from other parts of Indian Subcontinent were also brought to perform classical Indian dances such as Kathak to entertain Mughals. During the rule of the Sikh king Ranjit Singh, prostitution [chudhai] also was common. Many brothels were opened there. Ranjit Singh renamed this place 'Heera Mandi'. It was named for an officer, Heera Singh, who lived there. Some historians think that he named it for the beautiful girls (prostitutes) who lived there. They were like precious diamonds.\nBritish times.\nWhen the British Raj came to power in this region, Christian missionaries asked for the Heera Mandi to be moved away. They thought the activities there were 'sinful'. The British government tried to move it, but they were forced to move it back because people did not like this idea. Later, after the 1870s, the British also added some special brothels there for British soldiers. This area was made famous in Rudyard Kipling's novel Kim (printed in 1901).\nModern times.\nAfter Pakistan became independent in 1947, the Heera Mandi went on as before. Later, under the harsh Islamic puritanical rule of the military dictator General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, a big operation was started to 'clean' the area from prostitution and crime. Many brothels were moved or closed by force. However, once again, people did not like this move. Many of the brothels and other businesses were re-opened.\nEven though prostitution is supposed to be illegal in Pakistan, the Mandi still exists. It is also famous for some very good food shops nearby, where many people including foreign tourists come to just eat and watch the shows."}

{"id": "463767", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=463767", "title": "Third Battle of Panipat", "text": "The Third Battle of Panipat was a major battle of Indian history, fought on 14th January 1761. It was fought between the Afghan forces of Ahmad Shah Durrani along with his local Rohilla and other Pathan and Oudh allies, against the Maratha Empire.\nThe Durrani Afghan forces and their allies finally won and defeated the Marathas. The place of battle field is disputed by historians, but most of them are in favour of horiana in Punjab regions not far away from Delhi. The Marathas dug a trench which was three kilometres long and four hundred metres wide. Ahmad Shah Durrani showed his shrewdness by grounding pretended tents behind which there was a four kilometres long curtain. Behind the banner of curtain Ahmad Shah Durrani dug four kilometres long and twenty feet wide cannals. By extracting muds from the channel five feet high, twenty feet wide and four kilometres long road was made behind which Afgan riflemen can take safer position to fire acutely targeting advancing Maratha soldiers. Furthermore, Ahmad Shah Durrani laid his short range movable cannons on the backs of camels positioned behind the road from which cannon fire could be made targeting the advancing Maratha soldiers over the heads of his own forces. There were four feeder roads one kilometre away from each other on which Afgan horsemen could come down to battle field and if needed could retreat behind the shadow of five feet high covering road. These four feeder roads were short, narrow and sloping to battle field. Ahmad Shah Abdali tried to bait Maratha troops to advance and Marathas stepped into this trap. Afgans riflemen and short range cannons fired flawlessly onto the Marathas Army and Marathas'began to fall down one after another. In this final stage of battle Ahmad Shah Abdali's left flank and right flank came down to battle field surrounding Maratha forces on three sides. In this conjuncture of the battle, Holker left the battle field realizing the battle was lost and Marathas almost lost their ground in the battle leaving the chief Sadashivrorao Bhaou encircled by his bodyguards in the midst of the battle field. Front troops of Ahmad Shah did not further advance fearing cannon fire of the Marathas'. Under the cover of these French made cannon 15,000 Maratha forces managed to flee leaving their chief vulnerable.\nSome historians disputed that if Malharo Holkerr or Roghunath Rao was made chief of Maratha Army, the result might have been different, because they were well-known about the political situation of North India. Malharo Holker and Master Roghunath Rao invaded Bangla, Biher and Urisya during the reign of Nawab Alivordi Khan and campaigned guerrilla warfare against his kingdom. So, they were well-known about this locality and were experienced to campaign guerrilla warfare in this terrain. But it should be kept in mind that Sadashivro Rao Bhau who was peshwa's younger brother and peshwa's son Vishwash Rao also took part in this battle. If Roghunath Rao or Holker was made chief of the Maratha Army, lives of Baji Rao and Sadashivrorao Bhau would have been in jeopardy. Keeping this in mind, Peshwa made Sadashivrorao Bhau the chief of Maratha Army.\nWhen the battle began at 8 a.m.on 14th January, 1761 after the Marathas' scantier foodgrains were engulfed by their soldiers, Durrani forces fired their short range cannons, but proved to be ineffective because of falling their ignition on the middle of the battlefield. Thus Ahmad Shah Durrani tried to thwart Maratha advance, he sent his special messenger over the river Jamuna to cross his roughly 15000 baluch soldiers who were engaged to block supply lines of Maratha. Ahmad Shah Abdali had little faith on his allies's ground troops. So, he cunningly played hit and run tactics until his 15000 Baluch troops completed crossing Jamuna toward the East. After reaching his 15000 cavalry troops in the evening, Ahmad Shah Abdali decided the final phase of his charge. In the meantime, after receiving message of crossing 15000 Afgan troops across the river Jamuna, Vishwasrao disappeared from the battlefield and secretly crossed the river Jamuna on the west. This was a major blow for the maratha side. On the other side Ahmad Shah Abdali tried to prolong the battle for minimum losses and maximum gains. And he was successful in his tactics."}

It uses a number of methods. Geochronology is the main tool used to get absolute age dates for all fossil assemblages, and for the history of the Earth and other bodies.\nDating methods.\nRadiometric dating.\nBy measuring the amount of radioactive decay of a radioactive isotope with a known half-life, geologists can establish the absolute age of the parent material. A number of radioactive isotopes are used for this purpose, and depending on the rate of decay, are used for dating different geological periods. More slowly decaying isotopes are useful for longer periods of time, but less accurate in absolute years. With the exception of the radiocarbon method, most of these techniques are actually based on measuring an increase in the abundance of a radiogenic isotope, which is the decay-product of the radioactive parent isotope. Two or more radiometric methods can be used in concert to achieve more robust results. Most radiometric methods are suitable for geological time only, but some such as the radiocarbon method and the 40Ar/39Ar dating method can be extended into the time of early human life and into recorded history.\nSome of the commonly used techniques are:\nCosmogenic nuclides.\nA series of techniques to find the age when a surface was created or exposed. Exposure dating uses the concentration of nuclides like 10Be, 26Al, 36Cl. They are produced by cosmic rays interacting with Earth materials. The data show when a surface, such as an alluvial fan, was created. Burial dating uses the radioactive decay of two elements to find the age when a sediment was buried away from cosmic rays.\nLuminescence dating.\nLuminescence dating techniques use 'light' emitted from materials such as quartz, diamond, feldspar, and calcite. Many types of luminescence techniques are used in geology and in archaeology.\nIncremental dating.\nIncremental dating techniques let us build year-by-year annual chronologies. \nPaleomagnetic dating.\nThe pattern of magnetisation in a rock formation can be used to help find its date.\nStratigraphy.\nMarker horizons are stratigraphic units of the same age, with distinctive composition and appearance. So, though they are in different geographic sites, there is certainty about their age-equivalence. Fossil faunal and floral assemblages, marine and terrestrial, make for distinctive marker horizons. Volcanic ash (tephra) has a geochemical fingerprint. Tephra is often used as a dating tool in archaeology, because the dates of some volcanic eruptions are well-established."}

The company operates a network of genealogical and historical record websites. These websites are focused on the United States and nine foreign countries. The company also develops and markets genealogical software, as well as other genealogical related services. As of December 2013, the company provided approximately 12.7 billion records and had 2.14 million paying subscribers. The website includes 191 million uploaded photos and more than 16 million uploaded stories. These were provided by people who use their website.\nThe company operates other websites including Archives.com, Fold3.com, ProGenealogists, 1000memories.com, Newspapers.com, Genealogy.com, MyFamily.com, and Rootsweb.com. Family Tree Maker was created by the company that advertised it as \"the #1 selling family history software\". Ancestry.com operates foreign sites that provide access to services and records specific to other countries in the languages of those countries. These include several countries in Europe (covered by Ancestry.com Europe S.\u00e0 r.l.) as well as Australia, Canada, and China.\nHistory.\nOn January 1, 1997, Infobases' parent company, Western Standard Publishing, purchased Ancestry, Inc. The website was a publisher of \"Ancestry\" magazine and genealogy books. The website was founded in 1983 by John Sittner. Originally, the website was a newsletter about genealogy. The \"Ancestry\" magazine had been launched in January 1994. Western Standard Publishing's CEO was Joe Cannon. He was the main owners of Geneva Steel. In July 1997, Allen and Taggart purchased Western Standard's interest in Ancestry, Inc. That same month, Ancestry, Inc., purchased Bookcraft, Inc., a publisher of books written by leaders and officers of the LDS Church. By this time, Allen and Taggart began operating Ancestry, Inc. independently.\nThe MyFamily.com website launched in December 1998. More free sites opened up in March 1999. MyFamily.com, had one million registered users within its first 140 days. The company raised more than $90 million in venture capital from investors. On November 17, 1999, the name of the company changed from Ancestry.com, Inc. to MyFamily.com, Inc. Its three Internet genealogy sites were then called Ancestry.com, MyFamily.com, and FamilyHistory.com. Sales for 2002 were about $62 million, and those for 2003 were $99 million. The company opened a call center in Provo, Utah, in March 2004. On December 19, 2006, the company changed its name to \"The Generations Network\". The company allowed free access to Ancestry.com at LDS Family History Centers. This service was removed on March 17, 2007. This was because of the lack of a mutual agreement. In 2010, Ancestry restored its access to its site at Family History Centers.\nOn July 6, 2009, the company changed its name back to Ancestry.com. A year later, Ancestry sold its book publishing assets to Turner Publishing. That same year, \"Ancestry\" magazine was no longer publishing after 25 years. On November 5, 2009, Ancestry.com became a publicly traded company on NASDAQ (symbol: ACOM). It's first public offering was at 7.4 million shares priced at $13.50 per share. The company had a partnership with NBC for a television series called \"Who Do You Think You Are?\".\nIn 2010, Ancestry.com expanded its location to San Francisco, California. The San Francisco office focuses on the technology aspects of the company. Their recent works include an iPhone and iPad app. In December 2011, Ancestry.com removed the Social Security Death Index for people who died within 10 years. These records were removed because of identity theft concerns. In September 2012, Ancestry.com expanded its international operations with the opening of its European headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. The Dublin office includes a new call center for international customers, as well as product, marketing and engineering teams.\nIn October 2012, Ancestry.com agreed to be acquired by a private equity group consisting of Permira Advisers LLP, members of Ancestry.com's management team, including CEO Tim Sullivan and CFO Howard Hochhauser, and Spectrum Equity for $32 per share or around $1.6 billion. At the same time, Ancestry.com purchased a photo digitization and sharing service called 1000Memories. In September 2013, Ancestry.com announced its acquisition of Find a Grave. A month later, the company announced it had purchased the family history records of South African genealogy website Ancestry24 which stopped operating in February 2013.\nProductions and services.\nAncestry.com is a subscription-based genealogy research website. It has 5 billion records online. Most of the records are from the United States. However, records are being added for other countries, such as Canada, the UK, and European countries. Some records are free for anyone to access. Most records on Ancestry.com are only available for paying subscribers. Family Tree Maker (FTM) is advertised as \"the #1 selling family history software\". FTM allows the researcher to keep track of information collected during research and to create reports, charts, and books containing that information.\nOn June 22, 2006, Ancestry.com completed the indexing and scanning of all of the United States Federal Census records from 1790 through 1930. The website was nominated for a 2007 CODiE Award in the \"Best Online Consumer Information Service\" category.

Most writing today is done with a computer system, usually a word processing software. But for about 5,000 years, much simpler tools were used. The tools were different in different parts of the world. The raw materials had to be near where people lived.\nThe Middle East.\nThe two oldest writing systems come from this area, which also had the earliest agriculture and the first cities. It is not known for sure which came first, or whether they influenced each other.\nSumer.\nThe Sumerian system used clay as the basic material to write on. They developed a type of writing called cuneiform. Triangular marks were pressed into soft clay tablets by a metal or wooden tool. After the clay had dried in the sun the tablets were baked. Then they were carried somewhere else for others to read. We know that its first uses were for trade, accounting and administration.\nAncient Egypt.\nThis is the most famous of the old forms of writing. It was invented at roughly the same time as cuneiform, yet was quite different in style, and used different materials. The writing tools used varied according to the material which was written on. Egyptians ended up with three writing systems for the same language. The tools were:\nWhen writing on papyrus, Egyptians used a reed pen. The was hollow, with a nib-like end structure. This was a good example of how writing tools must be got from materials in the local area.\nFar East.\nThe original Chinese system scratched lines onto a bone or turtle shell surface, 12001500 BC.\nAlthough Chinese characters can be written with many materials, for the longest period they were written with a brush. The ink was carbon-based. It was moulded before use into an inkstick. This small solid object could be carried easily. To get the ink the writer had to grind the inkstick against an inkstone with some added water. The earliest Chinese inks can be dated back to 12th century BC, with the use of charred (partly burnt) materials and plant dyes. Mineral inks based on graphite were most common. A bit later, soot was used as the carbon source, and animal glue used to bind the ink to the paper (Egyptian ink used gum arabic for the same reason).\nPaper was a Chinese invention, and a very important one. Essentially the same writing tools and methods were used in Japan, and in Korea, two countries influenced by China.\nRome.\nThe Romans used lead styli with wax tablets which could be \"erased\" by rubbing the beeswax surface smooth again. For permanent records they wrote on parchment (treated animal skin) with ink. They invented the idea of a book with sewn-together parchment pages. It was called a codex, a word which means something like 'block of wood'. Before, long documents were kept in a roll.\nPens.\nDip-in pens were used in Europe for a thousand years or more. At first they were quill pens made of the stem ('rachis') of a pigeon feather. The quill pen was cut by a knife to give the slanting nib at the writing end. They were used from the middle ages until the first part of the 19th century.\nMetal pens were tried next, but many metals were not flexible enough. The writing styles which developed with quill pens used thick and thin strokes. People wanted the same flexibility from a metal pen. Between 1839 and 1849 the steel-nibbed pen solved the problem. For the next century and more, industrial production lines turned out hundreds of millions of steel nibs. They had the advantage that different types of nib could be attached to the same holder. This allowed for different styles of writing to be used. Eventually the best nibs were tipped with gold or iridium, a rare metal which arrives on Earth via meteorites. All stages in the making of nibs was done by machine. The great secret of all nibs from the Egyptian reed to the steel pen is the slit down the middle of the tip. This leads the ink from the small blob under the nib to the point where the ink goes onto the paper. Without the slit, a nib does not work well."}

They help students and researchers understand the order or chronology of historical events for a subject. A timeline can be used to visualize the time between events, durations (such as lifetimes or wars), and the overlap of events. \nHistory.\nTimelines are particularly useful for studying history, as they convey a sense of change over time. Wars and social movements are often shown as timelines. Timelines are also useful for biographies.\nProject management.\nAnother type of timeline is used for project management.

It was written and directed by Cameron Crowe. The movie stars Bridget Fonda, Campbell Scott, Kyra Sedgwick, and Matt Dillon. The movie was distributed by Warner Bros. studios.\n\"Singles\" tells the story of the romantic lives of a group of young Gen X'ers in Seattle, Washington, during the 1990s grunge music scene. Most of the characters live in a block of apartments. A sign in front of the building advertises \"Singles\" for rent (single bedroom apartments for one or two people).\n\"Singles\" got positive reviews from the critics. It was released on September 18, 1992.\nCast.\nThe movie includes cameos from popular bands in the Seattle music scene, such as Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, and Soundgarden. Stone Gossard, Jeff Ament, and Eddie Vedder, all in Pearl Jam, appear as members of Matt Dillon's band Citizen Dick. Their parts were made when Pearl Jam was still named Mookie Blaylock and had not yet released an album.\nSoundgarden singer Chris Cornell has a cameo as the guy who comes out from his apartment to listen to a very loud car stereo. He also appears in a later scene with Soundgarden playing their song \"Birth Ritual\". The members of Alice in Chains also appear in the movie as a bar band, playing their songs \"It Ain't Like That\" and \"Would?\".\nProduction.\nThe movie was made at some popular places around Seattle. It includes scenes at Pike Place Fish Market, Gas Works Park, Capitol Hill, and Jimi Hendrix's grave at Greenwood Memorial Park in Renton. The coffee shop that is in many scenes is the now-closed OK Hotel. The apartment building is on the northwest corner of the intersection of East Thomas Street and 19th Ave East.\nMost of Matt Dillon's wardrobe in the movie belonged to Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament.\nAment made up a list of 'pretend' song titles for the fictional band, Citizen Dick. Chris Cornell then wrote songs for the movie using those titles, and \"Spoonman\" was one of them. An early acoustic version of the song was made. It can be heard in the background during a scene of the movie. Citizen Dick's song name \"Touch Me, I'm Dick\" is a parody on the song \"Touch Me, I'm Sick\" by the Seattle band, Mudhoney."}

This breed was first used as ship's cats that sailed from Europe to North America with early settlers. They kept the ships free of mice and rats and protected the food and cargo. Even the Mayflower carried several cats to hunt the ship\u2019s rats, in 1620. The cats who were still alive after landing in the New World had kittens. Over time, the breed changed so the cats could survive better in their new land and climate.\nAppearance.\nThe American Shorthair is a working cat. It has a large and strong body. It is usually healthy, calm and loving with its owners. This cat is friendly and not shy with strangers. Males weigh eleven to fifteen pounds. Females weigh eight to twelve pounds. It takes three or four years for them to become adult cats. With a good diet and good care, they can live 15 years or longer.\nThe American Shorthair comes in more than eighty different colors and patterns. These include a brown-patched tabby, a blue-eyed white, shaded silvers, smokes and calicos. Some even come in deep shades of black or brown. Only hybrid cats that are chocolate, sable, lavender, lilac, or a Siamese pattern are not allowed in cat shows.\nBehavior.\nAmerican Shorthairs are intelligent cats who are interested in what is happening around them. They will watch outdoor birds, other animals and other activity from an inside window perch. These cats are calm but playful. Some enjoy sitting in laps. They get along with children, so they make good family pets. American Shorthairs are social cats, but still like to have their own way. They use their hunting skills to catch insects or pests that come into the house.\nHistory.\nIn the early 20th century, a breeding program was started to develop the best qualities of these cats who came from Europe. Before, there had not been a lot of mixed breeds that had the American Shorthair background. \nThe American Shorthair cat now has standards set by cat fanciers of the breed. The breed is accepted by all North American cat registries. In 1966, the breed was given the name \"American Shorthair\". This was to separate the pure breed cat from the many mixed domestic short-haired cats that live all over North America. All these short haired cats are called \"working cats\" because they were used to catch rodents on ships and farms."}

Washington was a teenage African American who worked on a farm. The event became a well-known example of racially motivated lynching. Washington was accused of raping and killing Lucy Fryer. Fryer was the wife of Washington's white boss in rural Robinson, Texas. No one saw Washington commit the crime. During his interrogation by the McLennan County sheriff, he signed a confession and described the location of the weapon used to kill Fryer.\nWashington was tried for murder in Waco. There were angry locals in the courtroom. Washington pleaded guilty and was quickly sentenced to death. Washington was dragged out of the court by observers and lynched in front of Waco's city hall. Over 10,000 people, including city officials and police, gathered to watch the attack. People enjoyed the attack, many children attended the event. Members of the mob removed his testicles, cut off his fingers, and hung him over a bonfire. Washington was lowered and raised over the fire for about two hours. The fire was extinguished and his burnt torso was dragged through the town. Parts of his body were sold as souvenirs. Pictures of the event were taken by a professional photographer. This provided rare pictures of a lynching while the event was going on. These pictures were printed and sold as postcards in Waco.\nLynching was supported by many Waco residents. It was, however, not supported by newspapers around the United States. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) hired Elisabeth Freeman to investigate. Freeman gathered many details, despite that many residents did not want to talk about what had happened. After receiving Freeman's report, NAACP co-founder and editor W. E. B. Du Bois published an in-depth report featuring photographs of Washington's burnt body in \"The Crisis\". The NAACP also featured his death in their anti-lynching campaign. Waco was known as a modern and a progressive city. However, the lynching demonstrated that the city did not mind racial violence. The event was nicknamed the \"Waco horror\". The city then gained a reputation for racism. City leaders tried to stop violence several times in the following decades.\nHistorians believe that Washington's death helped change the way people view lynching. The media attention the event received made people become against lynching. It was seen as \"barbarism\" (ruthless) rather than as an acceptable form of justice. In the 1990s and 2000s, some Waco residents wanted a monument for the event. The idea did not gain support in the city."}

He claims to have five generations of descendants.\nLife.\nAccording to legend, Muslimov worked hard every day, up to 167 years. He did not smoke or drink. He ate fruits, vegetables, wholemeal bread, chicken broth, cheese and yogurt. He had several wives through his lifetime. Muslimov became ill with pneumonia between 1972 and 1973, but survived only to die later in 1973. Muslimov's story was picked up in 1973 by National Geographic Magazine. The article told that on the occasion he still rode horses and tended an orchard planted in the 1870s. National Geographic later recanted on the claim. The same story was told by the Guinness Book of World Records, stated as unconfirmed along with other similar claims. According to National Geographic, he had an 120-year-old wife whom he had married 102 years earlier. However according to his obituary, published by Time magazine, he was survived by his 107-year-old third wife. \nFame.\nThe case of Muslimov became known in 1963. This is when a young photojournalist of TASS, Kalman Kaspiev, went to Barzavu to interview the centenarian. The story was picked up by the Soviet press, by the National Geographic, and by the Dannon company, which for promotional reasons suggested that the long life of Muslimov was linked to a diet of yogurt. \nSome Gerontologists doubt his and other similar claims of extreme old age that come from this area. Analysis of Soviet census records show the lifespan in this area is no more than the expected 115 years for all other populations. Muslimov is one of several men to claim extreme longevity. There are twice as many super-long-lived men as women in this area. This is the opposite of all other populations where women usually outlive men. While there are no accurate records to prove his age, his story captured public attention. "}

It is most commonly associated with the \"Grand Dauphin\" the only son of Louis XIV who made it his personal residence. However, on the death of the Dauphin the property reverted to the crown and was used by the famous Duchess of Berry (a granddaughter of Louis XIV) and was later ignored under Louis XV and Louis XVI, but became the official residence of the King of Rome from 1812, and was occupied by J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte under the First Empire. The main building was largely destroyed in a fire in 1871, and it is now the site of the Observatoire de Paris-Meudon.\nHistory.\nThere was originally a small manor on the site which was given to the Duchess of \u00c9tampes, a mistress of Francis I of France. The family remodelled the building in around 1540 when the property was given to the \"Cardinal de Lorraine\". At the Cardinal's death in 1574, Meudon reverted to the House of Guise until 1654. In 1679, the ch\u00e2teau was sold by Servien's heir to Louvois, the minister of Louis XIV, who continued to improve it inside and out, until his death in 1691. Above all, he commissioned Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre to construct grand gardens and fountains fed by elaborate hydraulic works. In June 1695, Louis XIV purchased Meudon from the widow of Louvois, with the intention of installing his only legitimate child le Grand Dauphin in the premises. A brilliant period followed. The Dauphin employed \"Jules Hardouin-Mansart\". Following the death of the Dauphin the property was briefly used by his son Louis, Duke of Burgundy, Dauphin of France. It was then later given to the Duchess of Berry in 1718.\nLouis XV employed Meudon as a hunting lodge. Although his mistress, Madame de Pompadour, was installed in the nearby Ch\u00e2teau de Bellevue, Meudon was eclipsed in his favour by the Ch\u00e2teau de Choisy. Meudon declined further under Louis XVI, the parterres overgrown, the basins emptied, the park let piecemeal to tenant farmers.\nIn 1870, the terraces of Meudon were part of the strategic defenses of Paris in the Franco-Prussian War, and the ch\u00e2teau, damaged by shelling,[6] was occupied by Prussian forces. Forty-eight hours after the signing of the armistice, in January 1871, Meudon caught fire. It burned for three days, until only some exterior walls were left standing"}

It started on 7 September and ended on 14 September 1914. The battle was the second heavy defeat of a Russian army by the Germans. The first defeat was at the Battle of Tannenberg. At Masurian Lakes the Germans pushed the Russian 1st Army back out of Germany. They could not push the Russians back further because of the arrival of the Russian Tenth Army on the Germans' left flank (side). The Russians suffered a defeat and retreated losing about 125,000 men and 150 guns.\nThe strategy.\nPaul von Hindenburg, general of the German Eighth Army, knew the swampy area of East Prussia called the Masurian Lakes. He thought the Russians might attack there so he made plans in case of such an attack. At this time of the war, the Germans knew what the Russians were planning because they could read their messages. The Russians planned their attack on East Prussia with little intelligence of the area. They had no rail transport to move troops. They failed to plan for enough food and ammunition and moved only with horses and infantry. But they had superior numbers and were confident they could defeat the Germans.\nWhen the two Russian armies first moved into East Prussia to form a pincer attack, Hindenburg completely defeated the Russian Second Army at the Battle of Tannenberg in August 1914. There the German victory came when German general Hermann von Fran\u00e7ois disobeyed orders and attacked the Russian flank. Hindenburg then turned his army north to attack the Russian First Army at the Masurian Lakes in September. Fran\u00e7ois played a major part in this second victory when his First Corps forced back the Russian flank. Under their general, Paul von Rennenkampf, the Russians dug in. He made use of the lakes, rivers and other natural obstacles. Hindenburg used frontal attacks to hold the Russians while his armies tried to surround the Russian trenches. Using a counterattack to hide his movements, Rennenkampf moved his army back to prevent them being surrounded. Over a period of several days the Russian army lost ground. The Russians fought hard but were driven back to the Russian border. Rennenkampf kept his troops in good order as they retreated.\nThe aftermath.\nThe loss of 125,000 soldiers did little damage to the 800,00 -man Russian Army. But it also meant a loss of about 150 artillery cannons. At the time these were very valuable for the old Russian army. The Germans also had heavy casualties. This showed the German advantage of their modern rail system for supplying and arming their soldiers. But, the push made by the Germans into Russia caused their defeat at the Battle of Augustov. The victories at Tannenberg and Masurian Lakes made Hindenburg a hero in Germany. As a result of his fame, in 1916 he became Chief of the German Staff."}

They thought publishing more would not be seen as good to the public. King wanted to write under another name so he could write more than one book per year. His publisher, Signet Books, agreed to print more books under a pseudonym.\nIn the start of \"The Bachman Books,\" King said using the \"nom de plume\" Bachman was to see if his success was due to talent or luck. King said he put out the Bachman books with very little marketing. He did his best to \"load the dice against\" Bachman. King never found the answer to the \"talent versus luck\" question. He said he let everyone know that he was Bachman too soon. The Bachman book \"Thinner\" (1984) sold 28,000 copies during its first printing. When it was told that King wrote the book, the sales went up by ten times. \nThe pseudonym King first picked (Gus Pillsbury) is the name of King's mother's grandfather. At the last moment King changed the name to Richard Bachman. Richard is the same as crime author Donald E. Westlake's pseudonym Richard Stark. (The last name Stark \"was\" later used in King's book \"The Dark Half.\" Bachman was picked from Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive, a rock and roll band King was listening to at the time his publisher asked him to choose a pseudonym on the spot.\nIdentification.\nKing dedicated Bachman's early books \u2014 \"Rage\" (1977), \"The Long Walk\" (1979), \"Roadwork\" (1981), and \"The Running Man\" (1982) \u2014 to people close to him. The link between King and his shadow writer was found out after a Washington, D.C. bookstore clerk, Steve Brown, noted things that seemed the same between the writing styles of King and Bachman. Brown located publisher's records at the Library of Congress which included a document naming King as the author of one of Bachman's novels. Brown wrote to King's publishers with a copy of the papers he found. He asked them what to do. Two weeks later, King telephoned Brown himself. King told Brown that he should write an article about how he found the truth. King let Brown interview him. At the time of the announcement in 1985, King was working on \"Misery,\" which he was going to put out as a Bachman book.\nPost-outing.\nIn 1987, the Bachman novel \"The Running Man\" gave the idea for the Paul Glaser movie of the same name. King did not want his name to be on the credits. The screen credit for the movie went to Richard Bachman.\nKing used the \"relationship\" between himself and Bachman as a theme in his 1989 book \"The Dark Half.\" In the book a writer's darker pseudonym takes on a life of its own. King dedicated \"The Dark Half\" to \"the late Richard Bachman.\" There were plans to make the book a collaboration between the two, but this was later thrown out.\nIn 1996, Bachman's \"The Regulators\" came out, with the publishers saying the book's manuscript was found among Bachman's leftover papers by his widow. It was released as a companion novel with King's \"Desperation\"; the two novels took place in different universes but featured many of the same characters. The two book covers were designed to be placed together to form a single picture. In the foreword by King included with \"Desperation\" he said that there may be another Bachman novel left to be \"found.\"\nThe next Bachman book to be 'discovered' was \"Blaze.\" \"Blaze\" was an unpublished novel that King wrote before \"Carrie\" or the creation of Richard Bachman. For its publication King rewrote, edited, and updated the entire book. It was published in 2007 under the Bachman pseudonym, with a foreword by King under his own name.\nKing has taken full ownership of the Bachman name on numerous occasions, as with the republication of the first four Bachman titles as \"The Bachman Books: Four Early Novels by Stephen King\" in 1985. The introduction, titled \"Why I Was Bachman,\" details the whole Bachman/King story. (In 1996, the collection was reissued with a new King essay, \"The Importance of Being Bachman.\")\nRichard Bachman was also referred to in Stephen King's \"The Dark Tower\" series of books. In the fifth book, \",\" the scary children's book \"Charlie the Choo Choo\" is said to be written by \"Claudia y Inez Bachman.\" The spelling discrepancy of the added 'y' was later explained as a deus ex machina on the part of \"The White\" (a force of good throughout King's \"Tower\" series) to bring the total number of letters in her name to nineteen, a number prominent in King's series. In the next novel of the series, \",\" Stephen King briefly discusses his Richard Bachman pseudonym.\nAfter the Heath High School shooting, King announced that he would allow \"Rage\" to go out of print. He feared that it might inspire similar tragedies. \"Rage\" for a time continued to be available in the United Kingdom in \"The Bachman Books\" collection. Now the collection no longer has \"Rage\". In a footnote to the preface of \"Blaze,\" dated 30 January 2007, King wrote of \"Rage\": \"Now out of print, and a good thing.\" King's other Bachman novels are available in the US in separate volumes.\nIn 2010, King appeared on the FX television show \"Sons of Anarchy\" in a cameo appearance. His character, named Bachman, did contract work quietly getting rid of dead bodies.\nIn issue 29 of the comic adaptation of \"The Stand\", Richard Bachman appears as one of the top lieutenants of Randall Flagg. He replaced the character of Whitney Horgan from the original book. He is drawn to look like King.\nIn the 2013 \"Grimm\" episode \"Nameless\", Richard Bachman, being a pseudonym of Stephen King, was a plot point. King's novel, \"Rage\", had its title page used as a prop for the killer to write a note to the police.\nOther pseudonyms.\nKing wrote a short story, \"The Fifth Quarter\", under the pseudonym \"John Swithen\" (the name of a character in the book \"Carrie\"), that was published in \"Cavalier\" magazine April 1972. The story was later reprinted in King's collection \"Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes\" in 1993 under his own name. In the introduction to the Bachman novel \"Blaze\", King claims, with tongue-in-cheek, that \"Bachman\" was the person using the Swithen pseudonym ."}

Some examples of themes of this type are conflict between the person and society; getting to adult age; humans in conflict with technology; nostalgia.\nA theme may be shown by the actions, words said, or thoughts of a character in a novel. An example of this would be the theme loneliness in John Steinbeck's \"Of Mice and Men\". Many of the characters are lonely. It may be different from the book's or author's view of the world. From the source we found we can see that the themes can be at a variety of state as the worldwide web"}

It is writing that goes from the actual meaning of words at face value to get a special meaning. The figurative meaning is different from the literal meaning. For example, consider the sentence, \"When she heard the news, she was over the moon and jumped for joy\". The meaning is that she was very happy, but not flying above the Moon nor jumping up and down.\nFigurative language is a difference in fields of language analysis. Literal language is about words that do not go away from their meaning. Non-literal or figurative language refers to words, and groups of words, that change the normal meanings of the words. A literal usage is the \"normal\" meanings of the words. It has the same meaning regardless of the context. The intended meaning is the same as the real meaning of the individual words. Figurative use of language is the use of words or phrases in a manner where the literal meaning of the words is not true or does not make sense. It \"implies a non-literal meaning which does make sense or that could be true\"."}

It is information that has first been interpreted and evaluated. It can include the terrain, the weather, and any other information about a theater of operations. Military intelligence gathering has a long history.\nHistory.\nBy the time of the Battle of Kadesh in BC Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses II was known to have had court spies. In the biblical Book of Genesis Joseph thought his brothers were Canaanite spies.\nThe Chinese general and strategist Sun Tzu (544 BC \u2013 496 BC) wrote about the importance of military intelligence. In his book The Art of War he wrote: \"If you know both yourself and your enemy you can win a hundred battles without jeopardy.\" He emphasized the importance of using spies to learn an enemy's strength and what they were doing. He also wrote: \"All warfare is based on deception\". What he meant was war can even be avoided if you feed your enemy enough bad information. This is also called counterintelligence. Ancient Rome depended heavily on intelligence information to rule it's empire.\nWhen Major General Joseph Hooker took command of the Army of the Potomac he ordered Colonel George H. Sharpe to establish an intelligence unit. In 1863, they established the Bureau of Military Information. The information they gathered was amazingly accurate. They calculated the size of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia within 2% of the actual number. By war's end Sharpe knew more about the Army of Northern Virginia than many Confederate officers. One of the best sources of military information Sharpe's organization had was slaves who used the Underground Railroad to escape the South.\nDuring World War I intelligence became better organized. For the first time Airplanes were used for intelligence gathering. An observer would fly with a pilot and diagram and map battlefields. They would also photograph intelligence targets and count troops. Operators at listening stations reported on enemy communications.\nClimate.\nBefore the 20th century accurate weather information was not available. Military planners had no data on the climate of their target area. In many cases they didn't even have accurate maps of the area. In 1941, when Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union they did not have any information on how harsh the Russian winters were. They did not have accurate maps of the roads. Between October 1941 and April 1942 the Germans lost between 100,000 and 112, 000 soldiers to frostbite. That is two-thirds of the number of soldiers who were killed in action or missing.\nTerrain.\nGeneral knowledge of terrain has always been important to military intelligence. But environmental factors sometimes went unnoticed. At the Battle of Agincourt mud was a major factor in the English victory. The extremely muddy ground slowed down the French and made them easy prey for English archers. In the 17th and 18th centuries army quartermasters, in addition to providing supplies, also scouted terrain and planned s the army would take. One of the first major improvements in gaining scientific knowledge of terrain was during the Russo-Japanese War (1904\u20131905). The Russians used geologists to do a detailed survey of Korea. They also used geologists to advise them in building fortifications.\nHaving little or no knowledge of terrain has proved costly to many battles in history. During the Pacific War in World War II, the United States forces had little knowledge of the terrain of the many Pacific islands they fought on. After the war, the United States Army Corps of Engineers contracted with the United States Geological Survey to provide detailed geological information on occupied islands.\nModern military intelligence.\nIn addition to intelligence gathering on other countries, terrorism is also a major concern of military intelligence. Intelligence gathering by examining communications signals has been a regular activity of military intelligence. Since 2005 military and other intelligence services have also monitored the Internet.\nIn some 21st century countries, military intelligence competes with civilian-led intelligence agencies. Often military and civilian intelligence gathering have different goals and objectives. Both gather their own intelligence and do not always share information. New methods of intelligence gathering, such as video imagery, satellites, reconnaissance aircraft and drones, produce tremendous amounts of raw data. Artificial intelligence is used to analyze this data for information."}

Another shepherd, Patrick McGeary left the town soon afterwards. Fifteen years later, Brookhouse's bones were found under a pile of rocks near Lake Corangamite. The skull had been crushed. It took police another two years to find McGeary, who was found guilty of murder and hanged in Melbourne in 1871. He had killed Brookhouse to stop him from telling Murray about his sheep stealing.\nTown features.\nThe Lake Colac Post Office opened on 1 July 1848. The name was changed to Colac in 1854.\nColac Botanic Gardens in Queen Street is next to the shores of Lake Colac. They were first planted in 1868, and remodelled in 1910 by William Guilfoyle. There is a large number of different of plants with many old and rare trees and a rose arbour.\nA commemorative plaque on the southern side of the Memorial Square remembers two historic speeches given on consecutive nights in Colac. The two speeches declared Australia would join Britain to fight in World War I. On 5 September 1914 the Leader of the Opposition, Andrew Fisher said \"...Australia will stand by the mother country to our last man and our last shilling\". The next night, the Prime Minister Joseph Cook said that \"...If the old country is at war, so are we\".\nNatural features.\nLake Colac dried up during the drought of 2008-2009. It has now refilled.\nTransport.\nThe railway reached the town in 1877. From 1883 the line was extended to reach as far as Port Fairy, in the south west of the state. The Irrewarra-Cressy line to Ballarat also ran from Colac between 1889 and 1953. There was also a branch line to Alvie opened in 1923 and closed in 1954. A narrow gauge railway line began in Colac going south to the small towns of Beech Forest and Crowes. This line opened in 1902 and closed in 1962.\nThe local railway station is served by V/Line passenger services on the Warrnambool line. The train stops at Camperdown and Terang.\nColac is on the Princes Highway.\nEvents.\nColac is the home of the annual \"Cliff Young Australian 6-day race\". The event has been going for over 20 years and is a running/walking event. It is held in the Memorial Square which is in the middle of Colac and attracts entries from all over the world.\nIndustry.\nThe main industries are based on agriculture including dairy, beef, lamb and finewool merino industries, and a large timber industry.

This idea comes from a literal reading of scripture, very often the Bible. Today, almost all scientists believe evolution is a good explanation. These scientists say that the scientific method does not allow certain explanations, mostly those that include supernatural elements. For this reason, a movement called Neo-creationism wants to re-state the ideas behind creationism and restart the discussion over the origins of life. The followers want to do this in such a way that religious terms are not used, and that there are no references to scripture. This should make it easier to talk to other groups, such as the scientific community or the general public. "}

When a charged particle (e.g. an alpha or beta particle) goes through it, the vapour is ionized. The resulting ions act as nuclei, around which a mist forms from the vapour.\nThe high energies of alpha and beta particles mean that a trail is left by ions produced along the path of the charged particle. These tracks have distinctive shapes (for example, an alpha particle's track is broad and shows more evidence of deflection by collisions, while an electron's is thinner and straight). When any uniform magnetic field is applied across the cloud chamber, positively and negatively charged particles will curve in opposite directions, according to the Lorentz force law.\nThe cloud chamber was invented by Charles Wilson (1869\u20131959), a Scottish physicist who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1927 for this work. The first cloud chamber was made in 1911. The invention was used in the early days of atomic physics. It is often called the 'Wilson chamber'. Since then a number of other types of particle detectors have been invented."}

For example, the rule of inference called \"modus ponens\" takes two premises, one in the form \"If p then q\" and another in the form \"p\", and returns the conclusion \"q\". The rule is valid with respect to the semantics of classical logic, in the sense that if the premises are true, then so is the conclusion.\nTypically, a rule of inference preserves truth, a semantic property. In many-valued logic, it preserves a general designation. But a rule of inference's action is purely syntactic, and does not need to preserve any semantic property: any function from sets of formulae to formulae counts as a rule of inference. Usually only rules that are recursive are important; i.e. rules such that there is an effective procedure for determining whether any given formula is the conclusion of a given set of formulae according to the rule.\nPopular rules of inference in propositional logic include \"modus ponens\", \"modus tollens\", and contraposition. First-order predicate logic uses rules of inference to deal with logical quantifiers."}
{"id": "465266", "revid": "1011873", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=465266", "title": "Logical quantifier", "text": "In logic, a quantifier is a way to state that a certain number of elements fulfill some criteria. For example, every natural number has another natural number larger than it. In this example, the word \"every\" is a quantifier. Therefore, the sentence \"every natural number has another natural number larger than it\" is a quantified expression. \nQuantifiers and quantified expressions are a useful part of formal languages. They are useful because they let rigorous statements claim how widespread a criteria is. Two basic kinds of quantifiers used in predicate logic are universal and existential quantifiers. A universal quantifier states that all the elements considered fulfill the criteria. The universal quantifier is symbolized with \"\u2200\", an upside down \"A\", to stand for \"all\". An existence quantifier (symbolized with \"\u2203\") states that at least one element considered fits the criteria. The existential quantifier is symbolized with \"\u2203\", a backwards \"E\", to stand for \"exists\".\nQuantifiers are also used in natural languages. Examples of quantifiers in English include \"for all\", \"for some\", \"many\", \"few\", \"a lot\", and \"no\".\nMathematics.\nThis statement is infinitely long:\nThis is a problem for formal languages, since a formal statement needs to be finite in length. These problems can be avoided by using \"universal quantification\". This results in the following compact statement:\nIn the same way, we can shorten an infinite sequence of statements joined by \"or\" such as:\nby rewriting it using \"existential quantification\":\nNotation.\nThe two quantifiers most widely used are the universal quantifier and the existence quantifier.\nThe universal quantifier is used to claim that for elements in a set, the elements all match some criteria. Usually, this statement \"for all elements\" is shortened to an \"A\" flipped upside down, which is \"\u2200\".\nThe existential quantifier is used to claim that for elements in a set, there exists at least one element that matches some criteria. Usually, this statement \"there exists an element\" is shortened to an \"E\" flipped upside down, which is \"\u2203\".\nEnglish statements can be often rewritten using symbols, predicates representing criteria, and quantifiers. One example is \"Each of Peter's friends either likes to dance or likes to go to the beach\". Let \"X\" be the set of all Peter's friends. Let \"P\"(\"x\") be the predicate \"\"x\" likes to dance\". Let \"Q\"(\"x\") be the predicate \"\"x\" likes to go to the beach\". We can rewrite the example using formal notation as formula_1. The statement can be read as \"For every \"x\" that is a member of \"X\", \"P\" applies to \"x\" or \"Q\" applies to \"x\".\"\nThere are other ways to use quantifiers in formal language. Each of the following statements below says the same thing as formula_2:\nThere are a few more ways to represent the universal quantifier:\nSeveral statements above explicitly include \"X\", the set of elements that the quantifier applies to. This set of elements is also known as the range of quantification, or the universe of discourse. Some of the statements above do not include such a set. In this case, the set will have to be specified before the statement. For example, \"\"x\" is an apple\" must be stated before formula_12. In this case, we are making a statement that at least one apple fits the predicate \"P\".\nUsing quantifiers formally does not require using the symbol \"x\". In fact, other symbols, such as \"y\" and \"z\", can also be used. However, one must be careful not to use the same symbol to refer to two different things.\nNesting.\nIt is important to put quantifiers in the right order. Below is an example of an English sentence showing how meaning changes with order:\nThis statement is true. It states that every natural number has a square. However, if we turn the order of the quantifiers around:\nthen the statement is false. It claims that there is one natural number \"s\" that is the square of \"every\" natural number.\nIn certain circumstances, changing the order of quantifiers does not change the meaning of the statement. For instance:\nOther quantifiers.\nThere are also less common quantifiers used by mathematicians.\nAn example is the solution quantifier. It is used to state which elements solve a particular equation. The solution quantifier is represented by a \u00a7 (section sign). For example, the following statement claims the squares of 0, 1 and 2 are smaller than 4. :formula_13\nOther quantifiers include:\nHistory.\nTerm logic was developed by Aristotle. It was an early form of logic, and included quantification. The use of quantification was closer to that of natural language. This meant that statements in term logic with quantifiers were less suited for formal analysis. Term logic included quantifiers for \"All\", \"Some\" and \"No\" (none) in 4th century BC.\nIn 1879, Gottlob Frege created a notation for universal quantification. Unlike the modern notation, he would represent a universal quantification by writing a variable over a dimple in an otherwise straight line. Frege did not create a notation for existential quantification. Instead, he combined universal quantification and a number of negations to make an equivalent statement. Frege's use of quantification was not widely known until Bertrand Russell's 1903 \"Principles of Mathematics\".\nIn 1885, Charles Sanders Peirce and his student Oscar Howard Mitchell also created a notation for universal and existential quantifiers. They wrote \u03a0x and \u03a3x where we now write \u2200\"x\" and \u2203\"x\". Pierce's notation was used by many mathematicians into the 1950s.\nIn 1897, William Ernest Johnson and Giuseppe Peano created another notation for universal and existential quantification. They were influenced by Pierce's previous quantification notation. Johnson and Peano used the simple (\"x\") for universal quantification, and \u2203\"x\" for existential quantification. Peano's influence on math spread this notation across Europe.\nIn 1935, Gerhard Gentzen created the \u2200 symbol for universal quantification. It was not widely used until the 1960s."}

Usually, a turned A (\u2200) is used to denote the universal quantifier, \"for all x\" is written as either \"\u2200x\", \"\u2200(x)\".\nPredicate logic and syllogisms look at the properties of universal quantification.\nPropositions can be falsified. To falsify a proposition which contains a universal quantifier, it is sufficient to find one element of the universe of discourse where the proposition is false. This element is known as a counterexample."}

Both Buddhists and Taoists celebrate this festival. The belief is that the gate to the underworld opens on the first day of the seventh lunar month. This month is regarded as the Ghost Month. All of the ghosts and spirits are released from hell. They are free to wander for the whole month. People hold ceremonies to welcome the ghosts and spirits. \nHistory.\nTraditionally, the Chinese call Ghost Festival \"\"Chung-yuan\" Festival\". Taoists believe it is the birthday of \"Yenlo Wang\", the Demon King. In the first half of the 6th century AD it became a Buddhist festival. It has kept the same form since then. During the 20th century Republican and Communist governments saw this as a relic of the past. The People\u2019s Republic of China did not allow public religious celebrations including ghost festivals. But reforms in the 1970s allowed these festivals to return. \nTraditional Rituals.\nThe Offering Ritual.\nThe offering ritual is the most important part of the celebration. People arrange long tables in front of the houses and temples. This is for offering food to ghosts. At the height of the celebration priests toss food and candy in the air. This is to feed the hungry ghosts. Children, and sometimes adults, scramble to gather the sweets. People also offer the ghosts incense, paper clothes and \"spirit money\". \nSalvation Lanterns.\nSalvation lanterns are used to guiding the wandering spirits and evil ghosts. They are placed at the doors of homes and temples. The lanterns are set up on the last day of the end of the sixth lunar month. They are lit at midnight each night during Ghost month. When the gates to the ghost world are closed, the lanterns are put away.\nReleasing Water Lanterns.\nWater lanterns are for the water ghosts who died from drowning. They illuminate the waterways to bring ghosts up to the celebrations. This allows the ghosts from the underworld and underwater are able to be in the same space peacefully. \nStealing the Lone Object.\nThe stealing the lone object activity is called \u201cChiang-Gu\u201d. This is celebrated in Yi-Lan. Competitors climb up a tall tower to reach a prize. The game was banned for some time due to people falling and being injured or killed. In 1991 the game was brought back.\nClosing the gate of the underworld.\nOn the first day of the eighth month in the lunar calendar the gates to the temples are closed. This represents the end of the Ghost month. It is the time for the wandering souls to go back to the underworld. A Taoist priest uses a sword to expel away the wandering soul. He shuts the gate of the underworld in the northeast position, and brings the event to a successful close.\nGhost festivals are celebrated across Asia. This includes China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, and Japan. It is also celebrated by many of the 34 million Chinese who live overseas."}

It is common in West Africa. One in 80 people who get Lassa fever will die. Some cases are severe and require going to a hospital. These cases have a death rate of 1 in 5. Lassa Fever was discovered in 1969 after two nurses died from the disease. It was named for the town in Borno State, Nigeria where it was first diagnosed.\nHow people get Lassa fever.\nLassa fever is transmitted from rodents to humans. It is caused by direct contact with rodent droppings. It can also be transmitted by humans to other humans by their blood. Lassa fever is common in West and Central Africa (around the equator). \nLassa fever cannot be transmitted by breathing. It is not very contagious between humans. However it is much more contagious among seriously ill patients. Lassa fever is transmitted by humans through skin lesions, mucous that is exposed to the virus, or by a patient's blood. This means healthcare workers (such as doctors and nurses) need to be especially careful in treating patients, or they risk getting the virus themselves.\nSymptoms of Lassa fever.\nIn 80% of cases, the disease does not have any symptoms and does not make people ill. In the other 20% of cases it shows symptoms and becomes much more severe. About 5,000 people die from it each year.\nIn infected patients, the disease has an incubation period of 5 days to 3 weeks. During this time, the virus remains dormant and does not cause harm. After this time various symptoms begin to appear including:\nDiagnosis and treatment.\nIn laboratories, there are many ways to test if a patient has Lassa fever. However, in many of the affected regions, there is no equipment to do the tests. This means sometimes people may not be correctly tested and identified with having Lassa fever. \nIf a patient is diagnosed with Lassa fever, then the patient will be kept away from other people, to prevent the spread of the virus. If found early, it is possible to treat Lassa fever with the medicine Ribavirin. Despite the fact the drug is relatively cheap, the medicine is still considered expensive for many people in affected regions. Patients may also require blood transfusions and rehydration. \nPregnant women in their 3rd trimester may need their baby's birth to be induced to allow them to stand a chance of survival. \nDue to the use of Ribavirin, fewer people are dying from Lassa fever.\nPrevention.\nIt is not practical to control the amount of rodents in the affected states. Therefore the best way of prevention is to keep rodents out of houses and public areas to prevent people coming into contact with infected droppings. Infected patients should also be isolated to prevent the spread of the virus (by humans to other humans). In rich countries, diseases such as Lassa fever can be easily monitored by public health organisations to prevent outbreaks. Poor countries often cannot afford these services\nThere is a vaccine which has shown promise in primates. It has not yet been proved effective in humans. "}

It had lost the 1936 general elections in India quite badly. It needed more support from powerful Muslims to make it strong. The party wanted to help Muslims in India get their rights. So, in October 1937, M.A. Jinnah, the main leader of the Muslim League party, invited some very powerful Muslims to a conference in Lucknow city. One of the most powerful Muslim leaders was Sardar Sir Sikandar Hayat Khan, KBE (1892-1942), Premier of the Punjab province and head of the Punjab Unionist Party. He was also invited by Jinnah to this big conference.\nEvents.\nAt this conference, at first most of the big and powerful Muslim leaders refused to accept Jinnah's request for help. Only Aga Khan III was ready to support him. At this time, Sir Sikandar Hayat Khan thought that it would be bad if the Muslims did not stand united to get their rights. He thought it was time for unity. So, he convinced some other big leaders to join him. These included Sir Saadullah of Assam, Molvi A.K. Fazlul Huq of Bengal, Nawab Sir Hamidullah Khan of Bhopal State and some others. They all went together and told Jinnah that they would support and help the Muslim League. A special agreement or pact was also signed at this time, between Jinnah and Sir Sikandar, called the 'Jinnah-Sikandar Pact'. This pact also said that all the Muslim members of the Punjab Unionist Party could join the Muslim League if they wanted to. Muslim people all over India were very happy to know that now, they had strong support from big leaders.\nEffects.\nThe Jinnah-Sikandar Pact was one of the most important documents and agreements of the Pakistan Movement. According to Professor Stanley Wolpert, '...it made Pakistan possible'. The Punjab was the biggest and richest province of British India. It linked together all the other Muslim areas and provinces. After this pact was signed in 1937, the Muslim League was next able to make the famous Pakistan Resolution at Lahore, Punjab, in 1940. And just seven years later, in 1947, an independent Pakistan was finally made.\nSyed Amjad Ali, a Muslim leader of Punjab said that 'Thanks to the agreement reached between Jinnah and Sir Sikandar in Lucknow, the dream of Pakistan became real. All Pakistanis today should be thankful to these two great Muslim leaders and their wisdom'."}

Unlike a vaccine, inoculation uses infected material (for example scabs) from an infected patient. The benefit of inoculation is it gives the individual a less dangerous type of the virus. Another benefit of inoculation is the fact it has a death rate of 0.5% - 2% (as opposed to the 35% death rate of smallpox). Inoculation was eventually replaced after Edward Jenner discovered a vaccine against smallpox. \nHistorical uses.\nChina.\nChina may have used inoculation in the 10th century. The Emperor of China at the time lost his eldest son to smallpox. He wanted a way to help prevent smallpox from killing any more members of his family. He summoned many people from throughout the empire to attempt to find a cure to smallpox. A man carried out inoculation to Immunise his family. However, the source of the story was supposedly written 100's of years after the event. \nInoculation was not widely used in China until the 'Longqing Emperor' in the 16th century. This was written by Yu Tianchi. Inoculation using the most deadly strain of the virus was banned from use in China to prevent high death rates. Inoculation is documented to have been used in India in the 18th century. It may have been used earlier than that, but there is no evidence to prove this. \nImportation to Europe.\nThe practice of Inoculation was first used in England after an ambassador's wife witnessed it in Constantinople. Her name was Lady Mary Wortley Montague and she was impressed by the benefits. She had lost her son, and bore scars of the virus herself. When an epidemic of smallpox occurred in England in 1721, she ordered that her daughter be inoculated. Many people visited her daughter, and were impressed at the results of inoculation. Eventually, inoculation was tested in Newgate Prison. This was before the members of the royal family were inoculated. After the success in England, many European countries began to use inoculation against smallpox.\nDecline in Use.\nIn 1796 Edward Jenner discovered a vaccine against smallpox which had a very low death rate. It was also more effective. Inoculation began to be replaced by this new vaccine, and was eventually outlawed in England in 1840. France banned Inoculation in 1762 due to the death rates associated with it."}

Even if the original pattern was a colored one, the modern Damask is usually monochromatic. It is woven in silk, linen and even synthetic materials. The patterns can represent plants, flowers and fruits, but also other classical Arabian designs.

This DNA is a double helix, with two strands wound around each other. This double helix structure was first described by Francis Crick and James D. Watson in 1953. \nThis DNA is different from the DNA in bacteria, mitochondria and plastids such as chloroplasts. Nuclear DNA is very long, and is bound up in chromosomes which, apart from the DNA, are protein structures. The second difference is that each eukaryote cell has two sets of DNA, one set from each parent: it is diploid. Mitochondrial and plastid DNA is relatively short, is in a circle, and there is only one set (haploid), not two. It is supposed that these organelles were once independent bacteria (see endosymbiosis).\nThe consequence of nuclear DNA being double is highly important. The genes in mitochondria and plastids only change when a mutation happens. Nuclear DNA gets shuffled by the cell division known as meiosis, part of sexual reproduction. This leads to a variety of offspring from any two parents.\nAnother feature of nuclear DNA is that it is regulated by proteins and RNA systems which control the rate of transcription into messenger RNA. In this way, most of the cell products are adjusted according to the circumstances."}

Birds do a lot of communicating, mostly to other birds.\nBird song.\nBird songs are for other members of the same species. The functions are partnership, mating and territory ownership. Depending on the species, bird songs may differ for these two rather different functions. In general, bird songs are only used by Passeriformes, the songbirds. It is one of their typical adaptations\nBird song may have evolved through sexual selection. Experiments suggest the quality of bird song may be a good indicator of fitness. Experiments also suggest that parasites and diseases may directly affect song characteristics such as song rate. This also acts as a reliable indicator of health. The song repertoire also appears to indicate fitness in some species. The ability of male birds to hold and advertise territories using song also demonstrates their fitness. \nHeredity.\nAlthough the capability is inherited, songbirds learn the detail of their song by copying. They are in trouble if they live in places where there are no older birds to copy. On the other hand, calls are usually inherited. Alarm calls, for example, have a critical survival function. and may well predate songs in evolution by a long way.\nIn general, males sing, and females choose mates. Both sexes use calls.\nSong identification.\nMany bird songs are so specific that they can be used for species identification. The calls of birds have been described using words or nonsense syllables or line diagrams.\nCalls.\nMost birds are social animals, and some are always near others of the same species. They use calls which sound quite different to their usual songs. Alarm calls are usually short and loud, and very difficult to locate. They warn others of predators. Mobbing calls gather other birds to scare off intruders. Flocks of birds call to keep themselves together in flight.\nQuite a few birds can mimic sounds they have heard. Parrots and drongos are famous for their mimicry. Common drongos in the Kalahari Desert use other birds' alarm calls to scare them off food. They get 23% of their food that way. \nNon-vocal sounds are done by some birds. Woodpeckers drum on hollow trees as a territory marker. Snipes make a sound called \"winnowing\" or \"drumming\" with their tail feathers when flying. Storks, which are almost voiceless, clatter their beaks.\nMedia.\nThe first person to record bird songs was Ludwig Karl Koch (18811974). He made the first known recording in 1937, and later became a BBC broadcaster and sound recordist."}

He or she is usually of the same sex as the child they replaced. Often they are given the same name. The replacement child provides consolation to the parents for the loss of the earlier child. It is also frequently believed they are a reincarnation of the lost child. As a result a replacement child represents the hopes and dreams parents had for the dead child.\nHistory.\nThe replacement child or replacement child syndrome became popular in periods of high infant mortality. But it continues in modern times in some places. In some religions and cultures, it was bad luck to mention a dead child's name. Even among European royal families, a dead child was often referred to by his or her title and not their name. Among the replacement children of Holocaust the names of the dead were often not spoken of. The name was memorialized in the replacement child (because they were alive the name could be used). \nIn early modern Europe the name given a child was supposed to make them like the person they were named for. In many cases the name given a child was an attempt to recreate the lost child (or ancestor). The grief the family felt over the dead child was made better by naming the child after the lost child. This shows a belief that dead spirits were present among the living. In Renaissance Italy the belief was a child was born into the identity given him or her by his family. The modern idea that a person creates their own fate did not exist in earlier times.\nPhilippe Air\u00e8s's \"L'Enfant et la vie familiale sous 'Ancien Regime\" (The Child and Family Life in France before the Revolution), was published in 1960. He believed that before the 18th century the French had no real concept of children. They were seen as adults. They were often dressed like adults. Parents knew many of their children would not survive. For this reason they did not invest in them emotionally. \nThe heir and the spare.\nIn history it has long been a practice for an aristocratic wife to provide an \"heir and a spare\". That means an heir to continue the family line and a spare in case the heir died too young. In Royal families one spare was the minimum. When child mortality rates were high, more was considered even better to secure the throne. Queen Victoria had nine children. George III had thirteen. These children had different names, but the concept was and is the same. The difference between early heirs and spares and the modern practice is that today a female can inherit the throne. "}

Bloom filters use hash functions to do this. For each element that is added, a hash value is calculated. When a new element is added, its hash value is compared to that of the other elements in the set. A Bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure. It is possible to get a false positive, but not to get a false negative. In other words, a query returns either \"possibly in set\" or \"definitely not in set\". Elements can be added to the set, but not removed. For each added element, the probability of getting a false positive grows. \nEdward Bloom proposed the Bloom filter in 1970. In the article, Bloom supposes there is an algorithm to hyphenate words at the end of a line. According to the example, most words have simple hyphenation patterns. But about 10% of the words require time-consuming lookups to fetch the correct rule. His case was that of hyphenating about 500,000 words. He saw that using the \"normal\" error-free hashing techniques, storing the hyphenation patterns, would require a lot of memory. He found that using his technique, he could eliminate most lookups. For example, a hash area only 15% of the size needed by an ideal error-free hash still eliminates 85% of the disk accesses.\nMore generally, fewer than 10 bits per element are required for a 1% false positive probability, independent of the size or number of elements in the set."}

Ennius provided a model for the later 'classical' poets such as Virgil and Ovid. Horace (who was a contemporary of Virgil) wrote verses in dactylic hexameter. They were in a conversational style, as if writing a letter. Virgil's hexameters are regarded as \"the supreme metrical system of Latin literature\"."}

This is a term used by modern historians to mean the Eastern Roman Empire based in Constantinople. The empire lasted for more than a millennium. It left a lasting influence on Medieval architecture in Europe and the Near East. It also influenced the later Renaissance architecture and Ottoman architecture.\nAs a distinctive style.\nEarly Byzantine architecture evolved from Early Christian architecture. The early Christian style typically was a basilica with three or five isles. Usually they had wooden roofs. Vaults and domes were rarely used. Byzantine architecture rarely used three isle or five isle basilicas. In this style domes were frequently used. The Semi-dome was also used, especially over an apse. It reached its highest form with the use of the pendentive. These are usually used to support a dome. The Byzantine pendentive is a geometric form using four triangular legs sitting on a square base. It developed during the 6th century reign of the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I. This is when Byzantine architecture became a distinctive style. Windowed domes were also a distinctive feature of this style. The intent was to make the dome look like a crown with jewels of light.\nLegacy.\nIn the West, Byzantine architecture was replaced by Romanesque and Gothic architecture. In Asia it had an influence on early Islamic architecture. Later Ottoman architecture was also influenced by the Byzantine style."}

The family consist of father Peter, mother Lois, daughter Meg, son Chris, baby Stewie, and their anthropomorphic (having human abilities) dog Brian. They all live in their hometown of Quahog, Rhode Island. The show features the voices of the show's creator Seth MacFarlane. Other voice actors include Alex Borstein, Seth Green, and Lacey Chabert. The executive producers for the first season were David Zuckerman and MacFarlane.\nThe first episode is \"Death Has a Shadow\". The episode was broadcast after Super Bowl XXXIII and was watched by 22.01 million viewers. The show received positive feedback from critics. The episodes \"I Never Met the Dead Man\" and \"Brian: Portrait of a Dog\", received more positive feedback than the rest of the episodes of season one. Some critics did not like the theme of those episodes. The Volume One DVD box set, included all seven episodes and the second season. It was released in Region 1 on April 15, 2003, Region 2 on November 12, 2001, and Region 4 on October 20, 2003. The show has since been released in other television shows. \nMacFarlane first thought of the idea for \"Family Guy\" in 1995. He was studying animation at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD). There, he created his thesis movie \"The Life of Larry\". His professor at RISD submitted the movie to Hanna-Barbera. This gave MacFarlane being hired by the company. Executives at Fox saw the movie. They contracted MacFarlane to create a show based on the characters. They called it \"Family Guy\". While working on the show, Larry and his dog Steve, became Peter and Brian. The rest of the show's characters were added later.\nEpisodes.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"}

He played a career total of 10 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL). He played for the Toronto Maple Leafs, New York Islanders, Buffalo Sabres and Pittsburgh Penguins.\nCareer.\nSpencer was drafted 55th overall by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 1969 NHL Amateur Draft. On December 12, 1970, He was called up to play for the Leafs in what would be his first NHL game on television. Spencer phoned his father Roy in British Columbia to tell him to watch the game that night on Hockey Night in Canada. There was an interview with Spencer between periods of the game. However, in British Columbia, instead of the Toronto Maple Leafs/Chicago Black Hawks game being shown, CBC Television aired a game featuring the Vancouver Canucks versus the California Golden Seals instead. Roy was infuriated by this and drove 135 kilometres (84\u00a0mi) to Prince George, where the closest CBC Television station, CKPG-TV, is located. When he arrived there, he ordered station staff, at gunpoint, to broadcast the Maple Leafs/Black Hawks game instead. The station did put the game on, but as Roy left the station, he was confronted by the RCMP. After he had a short stand-off with the RCMP, Roy Spencer was shot and killed. He played 95 regular season games with the Maple Leafs and also spent time with their developmental team, the Tulsa Oilers.\nOn June 6, 1972, during the 1972 NHL Expansion Draft, Spencer was claimed by the New York Islanders from the Maple Leafs.\nHe would play 2 seasons with the Islanders before he was traded to the Buffalo Sabres in exchange for Doug Rombough on March 10, 1974. During his time with the Sabres, he had his best offensive production. He was able to record 12 goals and 29 assists in the 1974\u201375 season. He was a fan favourite in Buffalo, fans loved his hustle, aggressive play, and hitting ability.\nOn September 20, 1977, the Sabres traded Spencer to the Pittsburgh Penguins in exchange for Ron Schock. During his time with the Penguins, his offensive play declined drastically. His last seasons in the NHL came in 1978-79. He was sent down to the AHL to play for the Binghamton Dusters, Springfield Indians, and Hershey Bears and then he retired in 1980.\nDeath.\nAfter Spencer retired from hockey, he struggled with a life of drugs and violence. In 1987, he was charged murder and kidnapping and he faced the death penalty. Former Sabres teammate Rick Martin testified as a character witness at the trial. In March 1988, a not guilty verdict was returned by the jury and Spencer vowed to change his life around.\nEven though he was acquitted, his life still continued to spiral out of control and on June 3, 1988, Spencer was shot and killed at gunpoint in a robbery following a crack cocaine purchase in Riviera Beach, Florida. Two men were charged in his murder. Larry Willie Johnson was sentenced to 40 years in prison and Leon Daniels was sentenced to 18 years in prison.\nHe was survived by five children from two marriages, and his twin brother, Byron. A book about Spencer's life called \"Gross Misconduct: The Life of Spinner Spencer\", was written by Martin O'Malley. The book was later adapted into a made-for-television movie in Canada called Gross Misconduct by Atom Egoyan."}

It is a fungus with a very widespread distribution. It grows in soils as a saprophyte. It also grows on cereal grains, legumes, and tree nuts.\nIn addition to causing pre-harvest and post-harvest infections, many strains produce toxic compounds known as mycotoxins. If eaten, they are toxic to mammals. The toxin produced by this species is called 'aflotoxin'.\n\"A. flavus\" is a human and animal pathogen. In mammals, the pathogen can cause liver cancer if contaminated food is eaten. It also causes aspergillosis (invasive growth) in people whose immune system is damaged.\nHow deadly is it?\nIn 1960 on an English farm, about 100,000 turkeys died. The cause of death was the primary food source, peanut meal. It was infected with \"A. flavus\". The culture was isolated, grown in pure culture, and a subset of healthy turkeys was infected. The pure culture isolate causes death in the healthy turkeys. There were four toxic chemicals (aflatoxins).\nTurkey autopsies showed aflatoxins targeted the liver and either completely killed the tissue cells or induced tumor formation. New standards for the production of food for human consumption were developed, which led to increases in cost.\nCrop management.\nTo keep grains and legumes remain free of \"A. flavus\" infection, some things must be done before, during, and after harvest. Moisture levels should be kept below 11.5%. Temperature in storage units should be kept as low as possible: the pathogen cannot grow below 5\u00b0C. The low temperature slows respiration and reduces moisture.\nFumigation reduces insects and mites, otherwise they help the spread of the pathogen. Removing old, unripe, damaged and broken seeds, and cleanliness also keeps down the spread of the pathogen.\nBiological control.\nYeast.\nTo protect tree nuts and corn plants that are affected by \"A. flavus\" treating the plants with the yeast \"Pichia anomala\" reduces the growth of \"A. flavus\". Treating pistachio trees with \"P. anomala\" inhibited the growth of \"A. flavus\" up to 97% when compared to untreated trees. The yeast successfully competes with \"A. flavus\" for space and nutrients, ultimately limiting the growth of \"A. flavus\".\n\"A.flavus\" AF36.\nThe good news is that there is a non-harmful strain which outcompetes the pathogenic strains.\n\"Aspergillus flavus\" strain AF36 is not carcinogenic and is toxin-free. It is used as an active ingredient in pesticides. AF36 is a fungal antagonist and is applied as a commercial biocontrol to cotton and corn to reduce aflatoxin exposure. AF36 is grown on sterile seeds which serve as the carrier and a source of nutrients. After application and colonization, AF36 growing seeds will out-compete aflatoxin-producing strains of \"A. flavus\". Non-aflatoxin spore dispersal is aided by wind and insects."}

Cirillo was later rushed to the hospital where he was reported dead.\nThe gunman entered the Canadian Parliament buildings through the Centre Block just under the Peace Tower and shot a security guard in the leg. There were then around 20 and 30 gunshots exchanged between the gunman and security. The gunman ran down the Hall of Honor to the entrance of the Library, which is beside the office of Kevin Vickers, the Sergeant-at-Arms of the Canadian House of Commons. Vickers grabbed his handgun and went into the hall. He dropped to the ground and shot three times. The gunman was engaged by six officers. One of the shots fired by Constable Curtis Barrett hit the gunman in the head and killed him. \nPrime Minister Stephen Harper and New Democratic Party Leader Thomas Mulcair were both holding caucus meetings in rooms that were on both sides of the shooter's path. The Prime Minister and some of the MPs were escorted out of the building while some of the others had barricaded themselves behind doors.\nThe gunman was later identified as Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, a 32-year-old Canadian man, who had a criminal record and had recently converted to Islam.

A building needs a strong foundation if it is to stand for a long time. A heavier building or softer soil needs a deeper foundation.\nTo make a foundation, engineers dig a trench in the ground. They dig until they reach solid ground. When the trench is deep enough, it is filled it with strong, hard material. Sometimes concrete is used. Concrete can be made stronger by putting long thin round pieces of steel into the trench. When the concrete dries, the steel ties the foundation together. We call this reinforced concrete. Once the foundation has been packed down tightly, or dried hard, construction can start."}

This was an area known to Europeans as the Apalachee Province. \nThe Spaniards had created Catholic missions throughout their province by the early 1600s.

The British with their Creek allies often raided the Apalachee and Spanish towns. In 1703 a British army and hundreds of Creek warriors attacked the territory. The Apalachee were nearly destroyed. The survivors, who numbered about 1400, dispersed. Over time many Apalachee mixed in with other groups, particularly the Creek Confederacy. Others found protection with the French in what is now Alabama and Louisanna.

The bits of a conversation, like questions and answers, suggestions and explanations, work to help the meaning get across. Requests and instructions are other types of communication which depend on meaning.\nAlthough humans use language to carry meaning, non-verbal communication definitely has meaning. In fact it is far more ancient than human language, and interpreting its meaning is mostly done by the unconscious mind. Messages travel by scent and sight as well as sound.

It first lived in Thailand. It is named after a province named \"Korat\" by the local people. The Korat is known as one of the \"good luck cats\".\nAppearance.\nThe Korat is a blue-gray colour with a small to medium stocky or \"cobby\" body. It can be surprisingly heavy for its size. It is intelligent, active, playful and likes to be with people. It has a heart-shaped head and large green eyes.\nThe Korat's colour is actually a silver blue that looks like it is shimmering. The people of Thailand call the colour \"rain-cloud gray,\" and the shimmer \"sea foam.\" This cat has one coat of fur that is short. The roots of the fur are a lighter silver blue. The colour along the fur increases to deeper blue and the tips are silver, especially on the muzzle and toes. This is the only colour allowed for a Korat. The eyes are large and peridot green in an adult cat. Kittens have amber or golden-green eyes which gradually change as they become adults, at two to four years. \nKorats may rarely have some white markings or spots, or even pale gray stripes. Sometimes these spots increase in size as the cat gets older. These are flaws in the colour, and these cats are not allowed in cat shows. Even though the colour is wrong, they are still healthy cats. \nHistory.\nThe first time the Korat breed was written about in books was in a poem written in Thailand, between 1350 and 1767 AD. The book is now in the national library in Bangkok. But the drawing of the Korat in this book did not have enough detail to positively say it is this breed. In more recent years, the Korat was pictured on a postage stamp in Thailand. \nA Korat cat first appeared in Britain with the name \"Blue Siamese\" in 1889 and 1896. But these solid blue cats did not meet the cat show standards for a Siamese cat, so they disappeared by 1901. \nIn the United States, a Korat first appeared in the 1950s. In 1959, Cedar Glen cattery was the first to import a pair of Korats to the U.S. for breeding. They were a male named Nara and a female named Darra. In 1966, the Korat was first allowed to be shown for championship status, by a breeder from Maryland. "}

He made a peace pact with Datu Sikatuna in a place called Bool, now a district of Tagbilaran. This pact was signed with a blood pact between the two men.\nOn 9 February 1742, the Governor of the Visayas Francisco Antonio Calderon de la Barca separated Tagbilaran from Baclayon and made it a town with the name of \"San Jose de Tagbilaran\" and dedicated to St. Joseph the Worker.

To the south is the \"Tagbilaran Strait\" and the Panglao island, and to the west is the \"Maribojoc Bay\" (part of the Cebu Strait).\nWith a population of 96,792, Tagbilaran has a population density of inhabitants/km2.\nClimate.\nTagbilaran has, like the rest of the Philippines, a tropical climate.

Panglao is separated from the Bohol island by a narrow strait, the Tagbilaran Strait, and two bridges connect the island with the city of Tagbilaran.\nThere are several smaller islands close to Panglao, such as Gak-ang, Pontod, and Balicasag.\nPanglao has a terrain that range from plain, hilly to mountainous, composed by a limestone that is soluble and that causes the formation of caves and sinkholes. One interesting geological feature of the island is the \"Hinagdanan Cave\" which has an underground water source; because there no rivers or lakes in the island, the cave is an important water source.\nBiodiversity.\nDuring the works of the Panglao Marine Biodiversity Project, about 250 new species of crustaceans and 1,500-2,500 new species of mollusks were found in the waters of Panglao and Balicasag. The project found that Panglao alone has more marine biodiversity than Japan and the Mediterranean sea.\nBecause of this biodiversity, the island was proposed in 2006 as a World Heritage Site by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources of the Philippines.\nAdministrative divisions.\nThe island of Panglao is within the Bohol province, and is divided into 2 municipalties and 22 barangays (like neighbourhoods)."}
