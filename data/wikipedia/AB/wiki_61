Jammu is in the Indian union territory of Jammu and Kashmir. It was excavated by Archaeological Survey of India during 1976-77. The survey was done by J. P. Joshi. The site contains the ruins of an ancient Indus Valley Civilization.\nExcavation.\nThe excavation found 9.20 meters deep of ruins. These consists of items found in 3 different periods of time. The first period contain two sub periods. The second period has early historical pottery. They are from North India. These pottery are similar to the those discovered elsewhere in North India. The third period consists of antiquities from the Kushan period. There are also house walls and a 3 meters wide street found in the ruins. The site seems to have been deserted after that.\nHistorical significance.\nManda is on the right river bank of Chenab River. The river is at the foot of Pir Panjal mountain range. Manda is 28\u00a0km northwest of Jammu. It was thought to be the northernmost limit of the Harappan Civilisation. It is also considered the northmost site of Indus Valley Civilisation.\nManda is likely a town that is set up by people of the Indus Valley Civilisation. They likely use it to do logging to get wood from Himalayan Sub mountains. They use the river near the town to send the wood to other towns of the Indus Valley Civilization.\nArtefacts.\nThere are several artefacts found in the site. They include redware from the Pre Harappan era. These redware are terracotta jar, plates, racks for plates and others. These made up of 15% to 25% of total artefacts found.\nImportant artefacts found are broken fragments of pots having the writing system of Harappan people craved into them. There is also one unfinished seal of the Harappan government found in the ruins.\nLimitations of excavation.\nThe dig is done on a small, restricted scale. There are no specific structures that could be exposed. One exception is a collapsed rubble wall-like structure.\nOther websites.\nMap of Indus Valley Civilisation sites"}

It is in the neighbourhood of Asakusa and one of the oldest and most important temples in Tokyo. It was first created in 645 BCE. The most important deity for the temple is Kannon Bosatsu (also called Avalokite\u015bvara). \nMany times in Japanese history, Sens\u014d-ji had a very big role. For example, during the Edo shogunate, when Tokugawa Ieyasu was the leader of Japan, he made Sens\u014d-ji the most important temple of the Tokugawa clan. Later on, some stores were opened in front of the temple. These stores are still in front of the temple right now.\nThe buildings on the land of the temple are not the original ones when the temple was first created. Many of the gates and art have been created again after their destruction.\nHistory.\nCreation of the temple.\nA legend from the area says that in the 7th century, some fishermen found a gold statuette of Kannon. The statuette was caught in their fishing nets on the Sumida River. Sens\u014d-ji was built so that people could worship the statuette. The land that Sens\u014d-ji is on used to have a very big Buddhist temple in the 8th century.\nDuring and after World War II.\nDuring World War II, Japan was fighting the United States. Because of this, many Japanese cities were hit by bombs coming from airplanes. During the Great Tokyo Air Raid in March 1945, Sens\u014d-ji and other parts of Asakusa were destroyed. This included many buildings of the temple and some art.\nParts of the temple.\nKaminarimon.\nThe is one of the two big gates of Sens\u014d-ji. People that go through the gate will get to the actual temple building and the H\u014dz\u014dmon. The gate is tall, wide and has an area of . The gate has a big red lantern. It is usually replaced close to every 10 years.\nThe gate that is in front of the temple right now is not the same one that used to be used. The first gate was created in 941 (during the Heian period) and was burned down in a fire in 1865. After Konosuke Matsushita gave money for it to be built again, a new gate was built in 1960.\nH\u014dz\u014dmon.\nThe is the other big gate of Sens\u014d-ji. It is closer to the temple than the Kaminarimon. The gate has two storeys (called a nij\u016bmon in Japanese). Inside the gate, many important objects are kept there.\nOn the left and the right side of the gate, two very big sandals that are made of straw (called \"\u014dwaraji\", or \"big waraji\") are hung. They are both long, wide, and have a weight of . New sandals are made every 10 years by people from Tateok\u0101ramachi, a neighbourhood in Murayama, Yamagata. The eighth pair of sandals was made in 2018. The \u014dwaraji are hung there to protect the temple from evil. They are supposed to show how powerful the statues of Nio in the H\u014dz\u014dmon are. The first \u014dwaraji were from 1941. The tradition comes from Toshizo Matsuoka, who was a part of the House of Representatives of Japan. He gave some straw sandals to the temple.\nNakamise-d\u014dri.\nThe is a street in front of the temple. Around the street are many small stores that sell souvenirs and food. The street is long and has 89 shops."}

It is prepared by roasting chicken marinated in yogurt and spices. It is prepared in the \"tandoor\", a cylindrical clay oven. The dish started from the Indian subcontinent. It is popular in many other parts of the world. Tandoori chicken can be served with other dishes, such as naan or rice.\nOrigin.\nThe dishes like tandoori chicken may have started during in the Harappan civilization. According to famous archeologist and vice-chancellor of Deccan College Professor Vasant Shinde, the earliest proof for a dish like tandoori chicken can be found in the Harappan civilization in 3000 BC. His team has found ancient ovens at Harappan sites which are similar to the tandoors that are used in the state of Punjab. Physical remains of chicken bones have also been found along with burn marks. According to Sushruta Samhita, the meat was cooked in an oven (kandu) after marinating it in spices like black mustard (rai) powder and fragrant spices. According to Ahmed (2014), Harappan oven structures may have operated in a similar manner to the modern tandoors of the Punjab.\nTandoori chicken started in the Punjab as a dish. It started before the partition of India. In the late 1940s, tandoori chicken was made popular by Kundan Lal Jaggi and Kundan Lal Gujral at Moti Mahal in Daryaganj, New Delhi. They were Punjabi Hindus as well as the founders of the Moti Mahal restaurant. Mokha Singh had founded the restaurant in the Peshawar area of British India. It is now part of neighboring Pakistan.\nIn the United States, tandoori chicken started appearing on menus by the 1960s. It is reported that Jacqueline Kennedy ate \"chicken tandoori\" on a flight from Rome to Bombay in 1962. A recipe for tandoori chicken was printed on the \"Los Angeles Times\" in 1963, for \"the hostess in search of a fresh idea for a party dinner\"; a similar recipe was published in the same newspaper in 1964."}

She has to do with pelicans. The Pyramid Texts talk about Henet.\nThe Pelican (\"Henet\" in Egyptian) is shown on the walls of tombs of people from the Pharaoh's court. Henet is in scenes of farm animals. Henet is in royal funerary texts from the Pyramid Age as a protective symbol against snakes. The description of the Pelican falling into the Nile seems connected with the idea that dangerous things are disguised as fish, and the pelican will capture them in its large beak. This is similar to the dragnets and bird nets used for trapping sinners in the Underworld. Scholars think that Henet is a goddess because she is called \"mother of the king\" in the Pyramid Texts. In ancient Egypt, that only meant a goddess.\nIn non-royal funerary papyri the Pelican can predict safe travel for a dead person in the Underworld. The open beak of the Pelican is also associated with the ability of the deceased to leave the burial chamber and go out into the rays of the sun, possibly an analogy made between the long cavernous beak of the pelican and the tomb shaft."}

Arthur Anderson was one of the five largest audit companies in the world. Enron was often said to be the worst audit failure in history.\nEnron's shareholders filed a lawsuit of $40 billion after the stock price of the company went from US$90.75 to less than $1 in November 2001. This meant the shareholders lost almost all of their money. Dynegy tried to buy Enron for a low price, but this didn't work so Enron went bankrupt on December 2, 2001 under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. This was the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history at $63.4 billion in assets. This was not passed until the WorldCom scandal in 2002."}

{"id": "801180", "revid": "217550", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=801180", "title": "Amendment process", "text": "The authority to amend the Constitution of the United States is derived from Article V of the Constitution. After Congress proposes an amendment, the Archivist of the United States, who heads the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), is charged with responsibility for administering the ratification process under the provisions of 1 U.S.C. 106b. The Archivist has delegated many of the ministerial duties associated with this function to the Director of the Federal Register. Neither Article V of the Constitution nor section 106b describe the ratification process in detail. The Archivist and the Director of the Federal Register follow procedures and customs established by the Secretary of State, who performed these duties until 1950, and the Administrator of General Services, who served in this capacity until NARA assumed responsibility as an independent agency in 1985.\nThe Constitution provides that an amendment may be proposed either by the Congress with a two-thirds majority vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate or by a constitutional convention called for by two-thirds of the State legislatures. None of the 27 amendments to the Constitution have been proposed by constitutional convention. The Congress proposes an amendment in the form of a joint resolution. Since the President does not have a constitutional role in the amendment process, the joint resolution does not go to the White House for signature or approval. The original document is forwarded directly to NARA's Office of the Federal Register (OFR) for processing and publication. The OFR adds legislative history notes to the joint resolution and publishes it in slip law format. The OFR also assembles an information package for the States which includes formal \"red-line\" copies of the joint resolution, copies of the joint resolution in slip law format, and the statutory procedure for ratification under 1 U.S.C. 106b.\nThe Archivist submits the proposed amendment to the States for their consideration by sending a letter of notification to each Governor along with the informational material prepared by the OFR. The Governors then formally submit the amendment to their State legislatures or the state calls for a convention, depending on what Congress has specified. In the past, some State legislatures have not waited to receive official notice before taking action on a proposed amendment. When a State ratifies a proposed amendment, it sends the Archivist an original or certified copy of the State action, which is immediately conveyed to the Director of the Federal Register. The OFR examines ratification documents for facial legal sufficiency and an authenticating signature. If the documents are found to be in good order, the Director acknowledges receipt and maintains custody of them. The OFR retains these documents until an amendment is adopted or fails, and then transfers the records to the National Archives for preservation.\nA proposed amendment becomes part of the Constitution as soon as it is ratified by three-fourths of the States (38 of 50 States). When the OFR verifies that it has received the required number of authenticated ratification documents, it drafts a formal proclamation for the Archivist to certify that the amendment is valid and has become part of the Constitution. This certification is published in the Federal Register and U.S. Statutes at Large and serves as official notice to the Congress and to the Nation that the amendment process has been completed.\nIn a few instances, States have sent official documents to NARA to record the rejection of an amendment or the rescission of a prior ratification. The Archivist does not make any substantive determinations as to the validity of State ratification actions, but it has been established that the Archivist's certification of the facial legal sufficiency of ratification documents is final and conclusive.\nIn recent history, the signing of the certification has become a ceremonial function attended by various dignitaries, which may include the President. President Johnson signed the certifications for the 24th and 25th Amendments as a witness, and President Nixon similarly witnessed the certification of the 26th Amendment along with three young scholars. On May 18, 1992, the Archivist performed the duties of the certifying official for the first time to recognize the ratification of the 27th Amendment, and the Director of the Federal Register signed the certification as a witness. \nhttps://www.archives.gov/federal-register/constitution#:~:text=The%20Constitution%20provides%20that%20an,thirds%20of%20the%20State%20legislatures."}

As he entered the car, Amir approached the car from the rear and fired two shots at Rabin with a semi-automatic pistol. Rabin was hit in the abdomen and chest. Amir was immediately tackled by Rabin's bodyguards and police on the scene, and fired a third shot at bodyguard Yoram Rubin during the struggle, lightly wounding him. \nAmir was arrested on the scene with the murder weapon. He was taken to a police station a few blocks away.\nYoram Rubin tried to get Rabin in the car but Rabin's body was \"limp and heavy\". Another of Rabin's bodyguards, Shai Glaser, helped put Rabin in the backseat of the car. He was taken to Ichilov Hospital at the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, a short drive away. \nRabin, who was bleeding a lot, was conscious and said that he thought he'd been hurt but not too badly before passing out. Some ten minutes after the shooting, the car arrived at Ichilov Hospital.\nAt this time, Rabin was not breathing and had no pulse. After the air was drained from Rabin's chest, his pulse came back. He then had surgery. However his health got worse and his heart stopped. At 11:02 PM, one hour and twenty minutes after the shooting, doctors gave up their tries to revive Rabin and pronounced him dead.\nRabin's funeral.\nThe funeral of Rabin took place on November 6, two days after the assassination, at the Mount Herzl cemetery in Jerusalem, where Rabin was later buried. \nHundreds of world leaders, including about 80 heads of state, attended the funeral.

The population of a state determines the influence a state can take in a presidential election. The convention also looked at the problem of counting slaves: If they were counted, the state would have more power in the election, the taxes the state would have to pay to the government would also be higher. The Three-Fifths Compromise was that three out of every five slaves would be counted. The compromise of counting \"all other persons\" as only three-fifths of their actual numbers reduced the representation of the slave states relative to the original proposals, but improved it over the Northern position. An inducement for slave states to accept the Compromise was its tie to taxation in the same ratio, so that the burden of taxation on the slave states was also reduced.\nA contentious issue at the 1787 Constitutional Convention was whether slaves would be counted as part of the population in determining representation of the states in the Congress or would instead be considered property and, as such, not be considered for purposes of representation. Delegates from states with a large population of slaves argued that slaves should be considered persons in determining representation, but as property if the new government were to levy taxes on the states on the basis of population. Delegates from states where slavery had become rare argued that slaves should be included in taxation, but not in determining representation.\nThe proposed ratio was, however, a ready solution to the problem that arose during the Constitutional Convention. In amending the Articles, the North wanted slaves to count for more than the South did because the objective was to determine taxes paid by the states to the federal government. In the Constitutional Convention, the more important issue was representation in Congress, so the South wanted slaves to count for more than the North did."}

Some kinds of egoism say that everything people do is , meaning it is done to serve their own desires. Other kinds of egoism instead say that people should do whatever they want or whatever benefits themselves.\nEgoism is often seen as the opposite of altruism, meaning the concern for others. \"Altruism\" is a word created by the French thinker Auguste Comte, who says that people must only serve each other and never be egoistic. The German thinker Friedrich Nietzsche instead says that altruism is not the opposite of egoism. He also says that even though people altruism is good, they do not treat each other well very much at all. Other egoists also often criticise this kind of attitude against people who do what benefits themselves. But Nietzsche says that people should eventually leave both altruism and egoism behind.\nThe American researcher James Scanlan says that when people do whatever benefits themselves it is only a fake kind of egoism. And that real egoism is when people do whatever they want. Both are often seen as dangerous beliefs. Some egoists such as Max Stirner, Nikolay Chernyshevsky, and Dmitry Pisarev, are also thought of as nihilists. And the British egoist Aleister Crowley popularised the phrase \"Do what thou will\".\nTheories.\nThere are many different kinds of egoism:\nMoral psychology.\nSome ideas of egoism can be studied in moral psychology. For example, Friedrich Nietzsche says that many people wrongly think that being \"good\" is related to being \"unegoistic\". Instead, this thought only happened since priestly values took over from noble values . Nietzsche says that the concepts of egoistic or altruistic actions are pseudo-psychology. In fact, \"there are no such things as egoistic and altruistic actions\". Morality, he says, tries to damage psychology with these false ideas. He also says that this kind of morality always serves the needs and wants of some people over others. The British researcher Alexander Moseley instead says egoists reject that psychology can understand people's motivations."}

This name arose after residents of the residential complex in the quarter between Chervyakova, Kakhovskaya and Smorgovsky tract streets painted a mural with \"DJs of Change,\" two DJs who played the Russian pop song called \"\" at an event and were subsequently arrested, on one of the walls of a transformer booth.

He posted his final message in the group, \"I'm going out!\" before going out to the street to see what was happening.\nOutside, he stood watching what was happening. According to reports, he may have made a remark to which one of the masked people replied to him harshly before pushing Raman to the ground. At this time, Raman hit his head on a children's slide as he fell. The masked assailants proceeded to pin Raman to the ground and command him to \"Lie down!\" The main initiator of the fight left, and three others continued to beat him.\nFollowing the assault, Raman was dragged off to a silver minibus. This is the last known time he was seen conscious. The events of this evening were filmed by eyewitnesses from different angles and then posted on the net.\nHe was taken to the Central District Department of Internal Affairs (Police Station), from which he was admitted to the Emergency Department of the Minsk City Clinical Emergency Hospital on November 12 at 0:05.

He felt ill on the way, as I was told. They called an ambulance and sent him to the hospital.\"\"\nOther reactions.\nChairman of the Council of the Republic Natalya Kochanova stated: \"Now there is a radicalization [of the protests]. ...This is the case with this Bondarenko.

Now there is an investigation, and have already established that false information was put on the Internet, that he was sober (we are talking about information and documents from the doctors of the emergency room. ). But the investigation will go further. But did you see how he [Bondarenko] was honored? A memorial! And how many drunks [in the whole country] are fighting? Every day they die. And they [the protesters] are arranging memorial services.

Homer, Moe, and the Simpson family go back to Moe's bar, which was changed back to its old design. The rock band R.E.M. goes to the bar and gives a turkey meal to Moe and the Simpson family.\nProduction.\n Jen Kamerman directed the episode. Dana Gould was the screenwriter of the episode. The episode was shown on television on the Fox network on November 18, 2001. Dana Gould said that George Meyer came up with the idea of Bart digging a hole at the start of the episode. This was an attempt to be similar with John Swartzwelder's type of writing. Meyer also wanted the university Moe went to in the episode to be similar to the school in the television show \"The Paper Chase\". Moe's old professor would also be similar to the professor from the show.\nIn one part of the episode, Homer creates a hunting club so that he can sell alcohol without a liquor license. This was based on the time Gould's father started a hunting club to sell alcohol without a license. Homer's bar was going to be the main story of the episode. This was changed when writers got the idea of making the design of Moe's bar post-modern.\nThe rock band R.E.M. appears as guest stars in the episode. Mike Scully said that R.E.M. were \"big fans of the show\" and that their appearance was a \"fairly last-minute addition\". R.E.M. did not want Bill Berry to appear in the episode, so the drummer in the episode was a session drummer. Moe's professor was voiced by Dan Castellaneta, the voice actor for Homer Simpson. Formico was voiced by Hank Azaria.\nReception.\nJennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict said that \"Homer the Moe\" is a \"tepid remix of previous \"Simpsons\" plots\". R.L. Shaffer of IGN said that the episode is one of the worst episodes of the show. Colin Jacobsson of DVD Movie Guide thought that the episode's story was too similar to the season 3 episode \"Flaming Moe's\". However, he says that the episode \"works resonably well\" and is \"one of the year's best episodes.\" Simon Crerar of \"The Times\" thought that R.E.M.'s performance in the episode was one of the funniest cameo appearances in the show."}

It is the opposite of being \"life-denying\". To affirm means to agree or to say something is good.\nThis is also called \"Nietzschean affirmation\" after the German thinker Friedrich Nietzsche. Nietzsche wrote that a person is life-affirming only if they life the way it is. This means to love their life even when it hurts or isn't comfortable. Nietzsche wrote that the best people will say yes to living, even if they would have to live the exact same life on Earth over and over. He wrote that if anyone truly affirms even just one moment then they affirm everything in life. If someone \"has trembled with happiness and sounded like a harp string just once, all eternity was needed to produce this one event\u2014and in this single moment of affirmation all eternity was called good, redeemed, justified, and affirmed.\" According to Nietzsche, Christians are not life-affirming."}

The handover happened on 1 July 1997. Before this day, British Hong Kong was controlled by the United Kingdom as a colony and a British Dependent Territory. After the handover, Hong Kong became a special administrative region (SAR) of China.\nThe handover was the end of British control of Hong Kong. They governed over it for 156 years. Because the number of people living in Hong Kong was 6.5 million in 1997, it was the majority of people (97%) living in all British Dependent Territories. Some people think that the handover was the end of the British Empire.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nThe United Kingdom controlled many parts of India by the 1830s. Their goal in this land was to grow cotton so that they didn't have to buy so much from the United States. They were not able to grow cotton, but they found out that they could grow poppies in India and turn them into opium. The British smuggled opium into China so that they could buy tea. This was one of the reasons the Opium Wars happened, when Britain and China fought with each other. After the Opium Wars, the two countries signed three different treaties with the Qing Empire, who controlled China at the time.\nBritain was given the power to control the land of Hong Kong in these treaties:\nProblems.\nEven though the British did not control the New Territories forever, this part of Hong Kong was developed as quickly as the other parts of Hong Kong. Because there was not enough land and natural resources in Hong Kong Island and Kowloon, a lot of infrastructure was also built in the New Territories. When Britain and China began talking about what would happen to Hong Kong after 1997, many people thought it was very hard to separate the New Territories and the rest of Hong Kong and only give the New Territories back to China."}

Most of the time, major cities in Florida do not get snowfall that can be measured. Some areas in the far north are able to get snow more often. The National Weather Service says that the Florida Keys and Key West have not gotten a snow flurry in more than 300 years. In Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and Palm Beach, only one snow flurry was recorded. This happened in January 1977. Miami, Fort Lauderdale, or Palm Beach have not had a snow flurry before or after that.\nFlorida's climate is low latitude and subtropical. Temperatures that are cold enough to have snowfall do not happen long. Frost is more likely to happen than snow because it needs a temperature of 32\u00b0F or 0\u00b0C, less than 2 m or 7 ft above sea level, no clouds in the sky, and a relative humidity of 65% or more. For snow to happen in Florida, a polar jet stream must go south through Texas and the Gulf of Mexico. A cold front has to stop around the south part of Florida and curve northeast to add very cold air into clouds.\nThe earliest known time Florida got snow was in 1774. People in Florida thought it was \"extraordinary white rain.\" The first White Christmas in the northeast part of Florida was on December 23, 1989."}

Is a compendium of maritime law that governed trade in the Mediterranean for centuries. Of Catalan origin, it was translated into many languages and served as the basis for current international maritime law.i\nThe text serves as disclosure of the practice in the sea, commenting on the uses and customs as a manual. Considered an excellent primary source on the customs of the time, it collects a lot of information on the legal systems of the time in Europe. The\"editio princeps\" is in the Catalan language, and was printed in Barcelona in 1484, reprinted again ten years later. The first Italian translation is of 1519, it is the work of Antonio Blado and the second at Venice by Giovanni Battista Pederzano (1549), and then by Francesco Lorenzini (1564). If there are more than twenty editions in Italian and others in English, French, German, Dutch, and Spanish.\nOrigin.\nAccording to Chiner and Chacon, the Ordinances of the Ribera (i.e. seaside) (\" Ordianationis Ripairi\u0153 \"), written in 1258, did not yet encode the maritime customs of Barcelona, and that the first reference to \"Sea consuls\" appears in Barcelona in 1282, just one year before the Consulate of the Sea was created in Valencia. Also note that the consuls of Barcelona had no independence assigned later on in the \"Book of the Consulate of the Sea\". Customs collected in the book would be in part coming from a Barcelona origin, but many would have been created and consolidated in Valencia, from which have been copied to the subsequently created consulates. According to Arcadi Garcia Sanz, the main difference between the consulates of Barcelona and Valencia would be the fact that the latter had from the start a \"royal jurisdiction\", and therefore has influenced so strongly in the other consulates in the fifteenth century."}

Over the next few days, the wave began to become better organized and by November 13, it developed into a tropical depression north of Colombia. The depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Iota six hours later. The storm was initially impacted by some wind shear, but a center relocation and relaxed shear allowed Iota to quickly strengthen into a hurricane on November 15, after which it underwent explosive intensification, peaking at Category 5 with wind speeds of 160 mph (257 km/h), operationally. However, the peak was adjusted down to a 155 mph (249 km/h) high-end Category 4 in post-season analysis. After weakening slightly, Iota made landfall in northeastern Nicaragua as a high-end Category 4 hurricane, becoming the strongest recorded hurricane to make landfall in Nicaragua in November. Iota then rapidly weakened as it moved inland, dissipating on November 18, the storm killed 61 people and 41 were reported missing during the storm"}

The treaty ended the Polish-Soviet War.\nThe borders between Poland and Russia that were changed by the treaty stayed the same until World War II. They were then changed by the Yalta Conference and the Potsdam Conference.\nBackground.\nWorld War I changed the imperial borders of Europe. In 1918, after the Russian Revolution, Russia had given up Poland in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and the war ended when Germany surrendered. Poland was re-created after over 100 years of being split up by three countries.\nThe Russian Civil War gave Poland the chance to regain the land controlled by the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth that had been taken by Russia in the 18th century. Meanwhile, the Soviet leaders wanted to respond to the leader of Poland, J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski, who had moved into Ukraine, by attacking Poland, which the Soviets saw as a land bridge to Western Europe, which they could cross to expand communism to the west. That started the Polish-Soviet War and ended in a victory for Poland after the Battle of Warsaw, which made both sides tired and want to end the war. Other victories by the Poles placed them under pressure by the League of Nations, which also wanted to end the war after they had taken a lot of land.\nNegotiations.\nPeace talks started in Minsk on August 17, 1920, but since the Polish counterattack had moved closer, they moved to Riga and continued on September 21. The Soviets suggested two solutions, one on 21 September and a second on 28 September. The Poles suggested another solution on October 2. Three days later, the Soviets suggested a change to the offer to the Poles, who accepted. An end to the war was signed on 12 October, and the war actually ended on 18 October 1920. The leading negotiators were, Jan D\u0105bski from Poland and Adolph Joffe from Soviet Russia. The Soviets did not let the noncommunist Ukrainian leaders be in the negotiations. \nThe Soviets' military problems made them give up lots of the land that they wanted. However to many other people, it looked as if Poland had lost the war. Most of the Polish negotiators were members of the National Democrats, who were Pi\u0142sudski's political enemies. They did not want more than a third of the people living in the bigger Poland to be non-Polish and so they agreed to get less land than they would have gotten even though many Poles would be left on the Soviet side of the border, and the Soviets had been willing to give up even Minsk"}

It was open from 1978 to 1983. It was a place for underground music and counterculture events. It was located at 77 White Street in downtown Manhattan and was opened by Steve Maas, art curator Diego Cortez and downtown punk scene figure Anya Phillips.\nHistory.\nThe Mudd Club was named after Samuel Alexander Mudd, a doctor who treated John Wilkes Booth after Abraham Lincoln's assassination. It closed in 1983.\nTo space for the Mudd Club was a loft owned by artist Ross Bleckner. Steve Mass described the future venue as cabaret to get the space from Bleckner. Mass said they started the nightclub on a budget of only $15,000.\nThe club featured a bar, gender-neutral bathrooms and a gallery. Keith Haring ran the gallery and selected artwork to show on the fourth floor. Live performances included new wave, experimental music, literary icons Allen Ginsberg and William Burroughs, and catwalk exhibitions for new fashion designers Anna Sui and Jasper Conran.\nFrom the start it was an \"amazing antidote to the uptown glitz of Studio 54 in the '70s\". As it became more frequented by downtown celebrities, a door policy was established and it acquired a chic, often elitist reputation.\nMany of Manhattan's up-and-coming cult celebrities went to the Mudd Club. Other people associated with the venue included musicians Lou Reed, Johnny Thunders, David Byrne, Debbie Harry, Arto Lindsay, John Lurie, Nico with Jim Tisdall, Lydia Lunch, X, the Cramps, the B-52's, the Bongos and Judas Priest; artist Jean-Michel Basquiat and his then-girlfriend Madonna; performers Klaus Nomi and John Sex; designers Betsey Johnson, Maripol and Marisol; and underground filmmakers Amos Poe; Vincent Gallo, Kathy Acker, and Glenn O'Brien.\nLive music at the club featured New York no wave bands like DNA, Nona Hendryx's Zero Cool, the Contortions, and Basquiat's band Gray. In 1979, Talking Heads performed songs from their new album \"Fear of Music\". Tim Page produced several concerts at the Mudd Club in 1981, in an attempt to meld contemporary classical music with rock and pop. On the dance floor, DJs David Azarch, Anita Sarko and Johnny Dynell played a mix of punk, funk and curiosities.\nSix months after it opened, the Mudd Club was cited in \"People Magazine\": \"New York\u2019s fly-by-night crowd of punks, posers and the ultra-hip has discovered new turf on which to flaunt its manic chic. It is the Mudd Club... For sheer kinkiness, there has been nothing like it since the cabaret scene in 1920s Berlin\".\nAfter its first few years, Studio 54 celebrities like Andy Warhol, Grace Jones and David Bowie began to go there. In 1981, the Mudd Club's Steve Mass began going to the more informal Club 57 on St. Mark's Place. He began hiring people from the Club 57 crowd (including Haring).\nMudd Club entry tickets, white with black print, are extremely rare. \nThe Mudd Club closed in 1983. It had just become a regular club and was not so special anymore.\nThe band Talking Heads mentioned the club in their 1979 song \"Life During Wartime\". The Ramones included it in their 1980 song \"The Return of Jackie and Judy\". Nina Hagen mentioned it in her 1983 song \"New York / N.Y.\". Elliott Murphy sang about it in his 1983 song \"Off the Shelf\". Frank Zappa named a song for the club on his album \"You Are What You Is\".\nMass opened another Mudd Club in Berlin in 2001. It was at located at Grosse Hamburger Strasse 17. This Berlin club was small club for touring bands.\nIn 2007, the arts organization Creative Time placed a plaque on the NYC building to mark the club."}

It did not last very long. It also did not take place during the usual storm season. It affected the U.S state of in May 2020. Arthur was the first named storm of the . With Arthur, 2020 became the sixth year in a row when a tropical cyclone formed in the Atlantic before June, or when the official hurricane season starts. Tropical Storm Arthur came from a big trough that formed on May\u00a014 near Cuba. The early part of the storm system slowly drifted toward Florida through the Florida Strait for two days. Later, it became a depression on May\u00a016 north of . This started the Atlantic storm season. One day later, the system was named \"Arthur\" and it slowly moved north towards North Carolina. Arthur started to weaken as it moved towards .\nTropical Storm Arthur rained on Florida and made high ocean waves. Arthur's outer areas rained and blew strong winds near North Carolina's beaches and caused dangerous rip currents along the southeastern coast of the United States.\nStorm history.\nOn May\u00a012, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) first said it was likely a tropical storm would form near . By May\u00a013, there were more thunderstorms than usual in Cuba, and the NHC said there was a 70% chance of a tropical storm in the next five days.\nThe NHC named it Tropical Depression One on May\u00a016. They called it tropical because of the way it turned around.\nThe NHC named the system Tropical Storm Arthur early on May 17 because people on an airplane had measured the wind. They said it was strong enough to be named. Arthur mostly moved north and in the Atlantic Ocean, not too close to the Florida and Georgia. However, Arthur started moving northeast over colder waters. Even though Arthur was moving over cold water, it still became stronger, even though it was smaller in images. As Arthur became stronger, its center moved onto the coast of North Carolina, a few miles southeast of Cape Hatteras. Then Arthur moved away from North and South Carolina, and it started to be less organized. However, the storm continued to become stronger. Early on May\u00a019, Arthur had its lowest air pressure of and its winds were strongest at 60\u00a0mph (95\u00a0km/h). Six hours later, the storm was no longer tropical. Arthur finally dissipated on May 21, 5 days after it became a depression.\nPreparations and impact.\nCaribbean.\nArthur rained a lot on Cuba on May 15. In some parts of Cuba, there were almost 3 inches in only four hours. The rain damaged homes and flooded streets. Arthur also damaged buildings in the Bahamas, which had already been hit by Hurricane Dorian one year before. Arthur caused floods and blew away tents that people were living in while they were rebuilding their homes. However, Arthur's strongest winds blew over the ocean, where there were no buildings to blow down.\nUnited States.\nFlorida.\nArthur was not a tropical storm until after it reached Florida. When it was in Florida, it was a system. Still, Arthur dropped a lot of rain and wind on Florida on May 13 and 14. It dropped over 4 inches (101.6 mm) of rain on parts of Florida and a rainfall total of 5.35 in (135.8 mm) fell on May 14, where it was the tenth highest amount of rain for the city ever. Flash flood warnings were created for large portions of Miami-Dade County on May 14. In Miami, streets were flooded from the rain. High-speed winds made officials use gale warnings and special marine warnings across most of South Florida. Seventy people in Volusia County had to be rescued after being caught in rip currents. Three of them had to go to the hospital. Purple and red flags were raised along the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina to tell people about the rip currents. Offshore Georgia, 3-6 ft (0.9-1.8 m) waves were seen. Arthur did $112,000 of damage to Florida.\nNorth Carolina.\nArthur also went to North Carolina as a tropical storm. On May\u00a016, tropical storm watches were issued from Surf City to Duck (a city) and Pamlico Sound to Albemarle Sound. A day later, these watches were upgraded to tropical storm warnings as Arthur moved closer towards the Outer Banks. By late May\u00a017, the water in the southern portion of the Outer Banks had become dangerous. Torrential rainfall occurred as Arthur's outer rainbands were near eastern North Carolina, with of rain falling in Newport, North Carolina within 6\u00a0hours, and many other locations recording at least of rain from the storm. Tropical storm-force wind in Cape Hatteras were also recorded. Despite this, the strongest winds were kept off land. This is because Arthur was an uneven storm. Waves as high as 12.5 ft (3.8 m) were recorded along the coast of the Outer Banks from Arthur. Due to flooding from Arthur, many highways in the Outer Banks and into mainland North Carolina were closed. SpaceX also had to delay the launch of a few Starlink internet satellites because of bad weather from Arthur affecting them. As Arthur moved away from land, warnings were canceled.\nOther places in the United States.\nIn James City County, Virginia, flooding near the ocean was seen in some places. In south New Jersey, Arthur caused floods, even though it was not a tropical storm then. There were also strong winds on the Jersey Shore. Power lines were blown down. On the Atlantic City Expressway and other roads, trees had fallen."}

She is famous for having an affair with Alexander Hamilton.\nIn 1791, when Maria Reynolds was 23, she went to Alexander Hamilton's house in Philadelphia. She said her husband had left and she wanted to go back to New York, where she was from. He offered to lend her money so she could go. Instead, the two of them began a sexual relationship. Later, Maria Reynolds' husband, James Reynolds, blackmailed Alexander Hamilton: He told Hamilton to give him money or else he would tell Hamilton's wife that he had slept with Maria. Hamilton paid James Reynolds and continued to visit Maria Reynolds.\nJames Reynolds continued to write letters to Hamilton asking for money, and Hamilton paid. When James Reynolds was arrested for forgery, he asked Hamilton for help. Hamilton did not help. James Reynolds told Hamilton's political enemies, Democratic Republicans James Monroe, Frederick Muhlenberg, and Abraham Venable about the affair. He also said Hamilton had committed other crimes. Monroe, Muhlenberg and Venable talked to Hamilton. They believed he had had an affair but had not committed other crimes. But Monroe made a copy of letters Hamilton's had written to Maria Reynolds and gave it to Thomas Jefferson.\nIn 1796, James Callendar wrote a book called \"The History of the United States for 1796\". In that book, he accused Hamilton of speculation and of the affair. Hamilton wrote a pamphlet called \"Observations on Certain Documents\" in 1797. He said in the pamphlet that he had had the affair but had not done any speculation. The public believed him.\nLater, Maria Reynolds sued her husband for divorce. Aaron Burr was her lawyer.\nA fictional Maria Reynolds appears in act II of the Broadway musical \"Hamilton\"."}

(ZOE TV) is a Philippine broadcast media arm of the Jesus Is Lord Church. Based in Ortigas Center, Pasig, it operates a set of television and radio stations each in Mega Manila and Puerto Princesa City. The company also owns its first television station in Metro Manila, VHF 11 and UHF 20 which is currently airing A2Z, a joint-venture partnership between ZOE TV and ABS-CBN Corporation through its blocktime agreement, UHF 33 which is currently airing Light TV, TeleRadyo, Jeepney TV, Cinema One and Myx.\nHistory.\nInitial period.\nThe frequency rights of Channel 11 under call letters DWXI-TV in Metro Manila was given to a joint venture of influential religious groups in the 1990s: \"El Shaddai\" a Catholic charismatic-based group headed by Mike Velarde and \"Jesus Is Lord Church\" an evangelical protestant group headed by Eddie Villanueva. Conflict of interests started the two groups to contest the full ownership of the station. The Philippine Congress intervened and awarded to Mr. Villanueva and the JIL the right to acquire channel 11. Villanueva paid Velarde for the stocks and assets held by the channel's then-owner Delta Broadcasting System (DBS).\nOn April 13, 1998, JIL began its broadcast history with channel 11's relaunch as DZOE-TV, with ZOE Broadcasting Network, Inc. as the new corporate name. It also launched the new station ID and slogan \"Give Love, Celebrate Life,\" which have been the corporate motto for years.\nIn 1999, Entertainment Network (Enternet), headed by Benito Araneta, and ZOE entered in a channel lease agreement that saw Enternet occupying the station's morning and afternoon block through CNBC Asia. Two years later, disagreements on the contract led to ZOE pulling out Enternet's program block and the latter filing a case on Villanueva.\nIn 2001, ZOE TV became the first TV station to air the second EDSA Revolution.\nIn 2004, Villanueva resigned as the company's chair to run in the country's presidential elections. After ending last in the election results, Villanueva returned to ZOE and continues his appearance on various ZOE TV programs.\nChannel lease agreements.\nIn April 2005, Citynet Network Marketing and Productions, Inc., a subsidiary of GMA Network, Inc., and ZOE TV entered to an agreement for Citynet leasing the entire TV airtime block of the station in exchange of upgrading ZOE TV's facilities and ZOE distributing its in-house programs to GMA Network's airtime.\nOn September 1, 2005, channel 11 quietly went off the air as GMA installed, upgraded and rehabilitated the transmitter and studios of ZOE TV. At the same time, Channel 11's 40\u00a0kW transmitter in Ortigas was decommissioned in favor of an upgraded 100\u00a0kW transmitter facility purchased by GMA located at the GMA Tower of Power site in Brgy. Culiat, Quezon City, with ZOE maintaining transmitter operations for the station (due to current ownership restrictions requiring only one station per broadcaster per frequency). ZOE TV, meanwhile, was relaunched on Channel 33 through its new call letters DZOZ-TV (a variant of DZOE-TV). Channel 33 began using its newly constructed 30\u00a0kW transmitter tower station located in Antipolo, while retaining the Ortigas Center studios as its master control facility.\nOn November 11, 2005, after a series of test broadcasts, GMA Network finally handled master control operations of channel 11 and launched their new second TV network through ZOE TV. It started as an all-female lifestyle channel QTV (Quality TeleVision;later renamed as simply Q in March 2007), then reformatted as news and public affairs channel GMA News TV (now GTV) on February 28, 2011.\nIn July 2006, Channel 33 began on test broadcast with its airing of job opening program \"Future Finder\" on limited broadcast hours in preparation for a relaunch of DZOZ-TV's new branding on November 27, 2006. On that day, after the series of test broadcasts, it began broadcasting, then under a blocktime agreement between ZOE and Makati-based Estima, Inc. The result of the deal was student-oriented channel UniversiTV. The channel has proven to be a hub for college and university students, catering them with evening and overnight programs everyday. By that time, it operated from 4 pm to 8 am the following day, but eventually retracted its broadcast hours until 4 am during its last few months of airing. However, on March 10, 2008, UniversiTV ceased its agreement with Channel 33, possibly due to poor ratings and lack of advertisers' support. This made ZOE TV left with almost no programming to offer along with the return of the old ZOE TV station ID from 1998 until 2005, though, they surprisingly aired entertainment programs in the evening and a weekday morning TeleRadyo-formatted news program under the ZTV 33 brand. UniversiTV on the other hand, was then relaunched as a Pay TV channel via satellite and cable operators, but totally ceased operations by 2010.\nRecent developments.\nIn March 2011, a day after channel 11 was relaunched as GMA News TV (now GTV), channel 33 was rebranded as Light TV 33, introducing new programs produced by ZOE, and at the same time, relaunching its in-house news production through its flagship newscast \"News Light\". Soon, channel 33 slowly regained its programming with programs mostly dedicated to religious formats. On March 31, 2014, Light TV was renamed as Light Network, launched its refreshed logo, and had a new slogan called \"Experience Light\" (with \"light\" as reference to JIL's belief in Jesus Christ as \"the light of the world\"), while retaining the slogan \"Kaibigan Mo\" (Your Friend).\nOn February 28, 2017, DZOZ-TV formally ceased its traditional analog terrestrial television signal, while officially launching its digital terrestrial television signal, using the ISDB-T standard. Upon doing so, it became the first Philippine television station to permanently shut down analog transmissions, as part of the country's wider transition rollout to digital TV. A week later, on March 6, Light Network revamped its on-air presentation to reflect the digitization completion. It also launched its slogan \"Magaan dito, Kaibigan\" (It's light here, Friend), giving another definition to the word \"light\" as an easy or light-hearted experience due to its programming.\nOn February 12, 2018, Light Network reverted its name as Light TV with its new slogan \"God's Channel of Blessings\".\nOn April 24, 2019, GMA Network/Citynet Network Marketing and Productions announced that it will terminate its blocktime agreement with ZOE Broadcasting after June 2, 2019. The split comes after the release of GMA's 2018 financial report which declared the increasing lease payments that the network contributes to ZOE for the past three years in exchange of operating DZOE-TV (from \u20b1899.89 million in 2016 to almost a billion pesos in 2018). Third-party sources reported that Channel 11 would run as a full-power analog satellite of DZOZ-DTV after the termination of the agreement, but ZOE has no official statement yet on its future plans. The termination took effect in two phases: all of ZOE's in-house programs were pulled out from GMA &amp; GMA News TV's programming by June 3; and a day after, GMA News TV Manila's intellectual unit (master control, sales, and employees) transferred to Citynet's DWDB-TV for the remainder of the analog broadcast run.\nTo continue GMA Manila's digital television broadcast, DZBB-TV and its GMA News TV (now GTV) subchannel are reported to transfer to UHF channel 15 (479.143\u00a0MHz), which the National Telecommunications Commission, through a memorandum circular in 2016, authorized to operate as part of NTC's plans to license digital channels 14-20 for major TV broadcasts.\nOn June 22, 2020, ZOE Broadcasting Network break their record as the first broadcasting company who officially switched and migrated to digital broadcast when they managed to re-air Light TV back on analog broadcast via its flagship TV station VHF 11, one year after GMA News TV (now GTV) moved its operations via UHF 27. 4 days later, however, the analog simulcast was short-lived and was replaced with Christian programming content while still conducting its test broadcast. It is rumored to be part of marketing the channel for either airtime/blocktime or for channel leasing.\nBlocktime with ABS-CBN and rebrand as A2Z Channel.\nOn October 10, 2020, ZOE Broadcasting Network made its blocktime agreement with ABS-CBN Corporation (5 months after its shutdown on free television) and rebrand ZOE TV as A2Z on VHF Channel 11. The new channel airs shows and movies produced by ABS-CBN as well as religious shows from its sister station, Light TV, Trinity Broadcasting Network and CBN Asia.\nMeanwhile after a month of launching of the said new channel, the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) investigated ABS-CBN and ZOE Broadcasting Network if the said blocktime agreement of two stations are processed in legal ways.\nAffiliation with PRTV Tacloban.\nOn September 20, 2021, ZOE Broadcasting Network signed an affiliation deal with the Philippine Collective Media Corporation's PRTV Tacloban to air A2Z's programming on PRTV Tacloban, As a result, PRTV Tacloban became a network-affiliated station for the first time in its history.\nLegislative franchise renewal.\nOn July 17, 2016, the Philippine Congress passed Republic Act No. 10888, known as \"An Act Renewing for Another Twenty-Five (25) Years the Franchise Granted to ZOE Broadcasting Network, Inc., Amending for the Purpose Republic Act No. 7297, Entitled \u201cAn Act Granting the ZOE Broadcasting Network, Inc. a Franchise to Construct, Install, Operate and Maintain Radio and Television Broadcasting Stations Throughout the Philippines, and for Other Purposes\u201d, as Amended by Republic Act No. 7968\", granting ZOE TV a legislative franchise for its radio and television broadcast operations all throughout the country.\nStations.\nTV stations.\nPay TV operators.\n-And other cable operators nationwide."}

It serves as television counterpart to PBC's FM radio station NU 107, airing rock and alternative rock music videos. The station gained a cult following through comedy and reality show Strangebrew known as \"Ang show na may tama\" and \"In the Raw.\"\nIn 2004, UNTV gradually reduced, until it eventually abandoned airing rock-oriented music videos after its airtime were acquired by Tapatan, Inc. headed by veteran broadcaster Jay Sonza. The station also began airing MCGI religious programs after Henares had a deal with the \"Ang Dating Daan\" group. Since then, UNTV became the permanent home of the religious program Ang Dating Daan (The Old Path) after leaving SBN 21. Later, the station was rebranded as \"UN Television (UNTV)\" (pronounced as \"you-en-tee-vee.\")\nThe new UNTV humbly started with a one-room broadcast studio located at the AIC Gold Tower in Ortigas Center, Pasig City.\nThe station transferred to Brgy. Damayang Lagi New Manila, Quezon City in 2006 as it needs bigger space for its growing public service initiatives. In 2008, UNTV transferred to its own building at 907 Philam Homes along EDSA Quezon City.\nSince then, UNTV became a 24/7 station (however they continue to sign-off the air every Monday mornings from 12mn to 3am due to regular transmitter maintenance) on free-to-air TV airing news, entertainment and religious programs. In 2007, Breakthrough and Milestones Production International under the leadership of Kuya Daniel Razon acquired the main operations of the network and in turn, relaunched as the \"public service channel,\" another first in the history of Philippine Television.\nUNTV began using DJI Phantom aerial drones for their live news reporting in 2013. In 2013, UNTV ceased using its old tower in Crestview Heights Subdivision, Brgy. San Roque, Antipolo, Rizal and began using its new digital-ready transmitter located at Emerald Hills, Sumulong Highway, Antipolo, Rizal to improve signal reception. The tower is shared by UNTV and Wish FM 107.5.\nOn June 26, 2014, UNTV held the groundbreaking ceremony for the construction of UNTV Broadcast Center, that will serve as its new headquarters. It is located along EDSA, in front of Ayala Land's TriNoma mall and just a few meters away from its current building.\nOn August 10, 2014, BMPI acquired the operations of PBC's FM station on 107.5\u00a0MHz. It was formally launched as 107.5 Wish FM (now Wish 1075) with a free concert featuring OPM artists at the World Trade Center in Pasay City.\nOn August 26, 2015, UNTV was officially rebranded as UNTV Life, with a new logo, in a concert held at the SM Mall of Asia Arena.\nOn July 18, 2016, UNTV undergoes a major rebranding to a global news and rescue company and officially became UNTV News and Rescue.

Its studios are at the Third Floor Worldwide Corporate Center, Shaw Boulevard corner EDSA, Mandaluyong City, with transmitter facilities at the Solar Entertainment Complex, along Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Paz Subdivision, Barangay Sta. Cruz, Antipolo, Rizal. SBN-21 became the first local UHF TV station in Metro Manila that broadcast in May 1992 and formerly known as World TV 21. It operates 24 hours daily.\nAs of September 12, 2019, the station's analog signal is permanently off the air.\nHistory.\nSouthern Broadcasting Network of Davao launched SBN Channel 21, the first local UHF TV station in Metro Manila since 1992. It was then known as World TV 21 by Kampana Television Corporation, which provided programming content from ABC, CNN and ESPN on this channel then. The idea is to bring back programming similar to the forcibly shut-down FEN Channel 17 of the former Clark US Air Base a year earlier due to the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo.\nBeginning on January 1, 2008, Solar Entertainment began to lease airtime on SBN, choosing to broadcast programming from its entertainment channel ETC. This partnership ended on March 2, 2011, as Solar transferred ETC to RPN. As a result, SBN renewed partnership with Solar Entertainment to create the news network Talk TV. On October 30, 2012, the channel was renamed as the Solar News Channel.\nOn December 1, 2013, SNC's programming was moved to RPN for wider national coverage, with ETC returned to SBN a day before.\nIn 2015, SBN ceased using its old analog transmitter tower at Strata 2000 building in Pasig City (which was obvious to consider even after Solar's purchase of SBN due to the old Sign-on and Sign-off sequences) and began using Solar's new tower in Antipolo for a clearer and better signal reception in both the analog and digital signals.\nAs of September 12, 2019, SBN closed its analog signal.\nDigital television.\nSBN launches its digital television broadcast in 2015. Solar Entertainment supplies its DTV channels through the new platform. For unknown reasons, the transmitter's encryption system was activated throughout its run, making two of the station's subchannels receivable only on set-top boxes with this capability. The technical issue was fixed by September 25, 2017.\nDigital channels.\nDWCP-TV operates on UHF Channel 21 (515.143\u00a0MHz).\nIn addition, Solar operates its secondary channel via DZBC-TV on UHF Channel 30 (569.143\u00a0MHz) under a subchannel lease agreement from its frequency owner Byers Communications.\nAnalog-to-digital transition.\nOn September 12, 2019, SBN closed down UHF Channel 21's analog signal in preparation of the DTV transition implementation. SBN is the 5th television network in the Philippines to permanently terminate its analog TV broadcasts, and go digital only."}

The main priority of training is to teach katsas how to find, recruit, and cultivate agents, including how to clandestinely communicate with them. They also learn how to avoid being the subject of foreign counter-intelligence, by avoiding car and foot surveillance, by killing, and by preventing foreign agents from creating 'traps' at meetings. Once training is completed, trainees will spend an apprenticeship period working on varying projects before becoming full-fledged katsas."}

These are stories from Russian life at the end of the 20th century.\nPlot.\nThe story \"On the Edge of Magellanic Clouds\" is, at first look, realism. The Medvedev couple lived together for a considerable part of their lives before perestroika. But in the last decade of the 20th century, the way of life in Russia is changing. Capitalism comes instead of socialism. Yulia, the wife of the journalist Andrei Medvedev, wants well-being in life. She decides that they need to start a radio station. All her thoughts are on it. The radio station will be ready to broadcast soon. \nHowever, these plans are a figment of her imagination. A strong desire for enrichment makes her mind bifurcated. Her husband Andrei tells about this in the second part of the story. The narrative is similar to tragic realism. However, here the author's voice turns on, again turning the content over. And the story becomes surreal. This twist makes readers think.\n\"Nights after\" is a little love story. The guy Sergey from the provinces falls in love with the Moscow girl Natasha. She came on vacation to her grandmother in the village. They meet at night on the river bank. He bathes naked. She does not see him in the dark and also strips naked. An uncomfortable situation develops, but as a result they begin to be friends.\nHowever, village hooligans rape Natasha, and they stab him. He ends up in the hospital, and she leaves for Moscow. And after his recovery, he has only a sad memory of this unfinished love.\nThe story \"Silent abode\" describes the life of ambulance workers in the province. Young Muscovite Anatoly Kiselyov comes there to practice. Doctors are often called to patients. Doctors get into both tragic and funny situations. Stories about them make up the story.\nLiterary features.\n\"On the Edge of Magellanic Clouds\" is a book with a non-linear storyline.

It was the law during the 700s c.e., which was the Nara period in Japan. Here, \"code\" means \"set of rules.\"\nThe Taih\u014d Code had two kinds of laws. It had \"ritsu\" which were laws about crime and how to arrest people. It had \"ry\u014d\", which were laws about how to run the government. For example, the ry\u014d said which areas were provinces and who would run them and what things the governors were and were not allowed to do.\nThe lawmakers who wrote the Taih\u014d Code copied things from Chinese laws. This was the Tang Dynasty in China. But the Japanese lawmakers wrote the Taih\u014d Code to give more government jobs to Japanese noblemen. This was different from the Tang Dynasty laws, which said anyone from any family could work for the government if they took and passed the right tests.\nModern scholars do not have a copy of the entire Taih\u014d Code, but they think it is about the same as the later Y\u014dr\u014d Code.\nIf the Taih\u014d Code and the Y\u014dr\u014d Code count as the same thing, then they lasted from 702 c.e. until the start of the Tokugawa period in 1232 c.e."}

Addis Abeba grew from less than 45,000 in 1936 to nearly 150,000 inhabitants in spring 1941, when the Italians were defeated and the Allies (with emperor Selassie) returned to the city.\nSoon after the conquest in early 1936, the city was improved with many structures, from paved roads to sewage systems. A new urban masterplan was studied for the city, that was approved in 1938 and by late 1940 Addis Abeba (where the Italian were more than one third of the inhabitants) was full of constructions (that were blocked because of WW2).\nAddis Abeba was the administrative capital of the \"Scioa governorate\" in the Italian East Africa.\nBecause the Italian rule lasted just five years, only a few of the many Italian buildings &amp; projects were completed: one was the Addis Abeba Stadium, inaugurated in spring 1940. Originally in 1937 it was called \"Campo sportivo Littorio\", while in 1940 it was enlarged with a tribune and the athletic lanes section.\nIn spring 1941 ceased to exist the Italian administration of Addis Abeba and most of the more than 40,000 Italians living in the city started to return to Italy."}

Antinatalists argue that humans (and sometimes other sentient beings) should stop making kids because it is morally bad. People who believe that making kids is morally good are called natalists. The term antinatalism was likely used for the first time by Belgian author Th\u00e9ophile de Giraud in his book \"L'art de guillotiner les procr\u00e9ateurs: Manifeste anti-nataliste\". South African philosopher David Benatar has also published books in support of antinatalism.\nArguments.\nNegative Utilitarianism is the idea that stopping pain is more important than making people happy. This makes it different from utilitarianism. Utilitarianism is the idea that people should do the most useful thing. The most useful thing in utilitarianism is making people happy. People who believe in negative utilitarianism idea say that making happiness is not needed. Since life has bad things, it is not worth starting. Some supporters of this idea argue that the worst pains in life do not make up for the best moments. This makes life not worth starting because it is too risky.\nRealism can support antinatalism. This is because supporters of the idea have evidence showing that most people have an optimism bias. This means that they see the world as better than it actually is.\nReligion can support antinatalism. This is because some religious sects (groups) believe creating life traps souls in a bad world. The Manichaeans, the Bogomils, and the Cathars are some of these groups that believe in the idea. Others include the Marcionites, and the Encratites.\nCriticism.\nNatalists say that making kids is good because most people are happy."}

He served as one of the greatest English Royal Army throughout James I's rule, and his Knighthood occurred on 16th September 1603. He became the key leaser of \"Herbert Estates\" after ascending to the Monastery in the year 1626 and becoming the Viscount Baltinglass in the year 1627.\nIn England, Baron Dacre became an established British title after its first creation in the year 1321. Lord Hugh Redwald Trevor Roper is one of the most notable titles of Baron Dacre. Lady Alexandra Henrietta Louisa Howard-Johnston, one of the daughters of Field Marshal, was married to Lord Hugh. In the year 1979, Margaret Thatcher, the British prime minister, then recommended the title of a life peer for Lord Trevor Roper. He was presented as Baron Dacre of Glanton to the lords' house in Northumberland County on 27th September 1979.\nBritish titles such as the Baron of Teynham were formed in 1616 in England, and it was presented to Sir John Roper, and his son Roper Christopher became the second holder of the title. Interestingly his daughter called Elizabeth Roper decided to marry Baron Vaux of Harrowden, who was the third holder of the title and a son of George Vaux. They were blessed with a son whom they named Edward. He became the fourth holder of the Baron Vaux of Harrowden after being married to Elizabeth Howard, who was the daughter of Thomas Howard, the first holder of the title Earl of Suffolk.\nThe fact that Sir John Roper was the first nobleman to declare the Kingship of James I makes him to be remembered for the brave act which happened after he was knighted in the year 1616, although several sources indicated that he might have been knighted in the tear 1587. The same day, Queen Elizabeth was able to ascend to the peerage with the title Lord Teynham.\nNotable Members.\nLord William Roper is a notable member who was a representative of the house of the lords and a practicing lawyer. He also summed up as an author, philosopher and chancellor to King Henry VII Tudor. There was an existing relationship between Lord William Roper and Sir Thomas More because Thomas\u2019s daughter Margaret More was married to William Roper.\nBefore sir Thomas More\u2019s death, he had a close relationship with Lord William Roper. His cause of death was an assassination done by King Henry VIII simply because he failed to convert into the Church of England. Lord William Roper was granted the opportunity to become the Dukedom by King Henry VIII, but he declined with respect to his father-in-law's death and family members. In the year 1616, Lord William Roper and his nephew, John Roper, earned knight honors for their services.\nMargaret More also commonly referred to as Margaret Roper and a daughter to Thomas More, is traced back to 1505 and is believed to have met her death in the year 1544. During her tenure, she earned several recognitions, such as being an English translator and author. She was one of the best-educated female learners in the 16th century with notable academic accomplishments and familial devoutness.\nHistory.\nThe Roper family owns several estates around the United Kingdom, such as Candelwick, Trimdon Estates, Galway Estates, Pylewell Park, Bradford, Hyde and Charlton. They also acquired the Kent estates in the 15th century by Lord John Roper while Sir Henry Roper acquired the Galway estates in the 19th century. Other additional estates include; Chestfeild, Modingham, Brambiltighe, Cheselherst, and Saint Dunstans. \nModern House.\nHenry Francis Roper, who was the 14th Baron of Teynham, inherited John Barnewall Curzon\u2019s and estate at Water Perry, Northamptonshire and all his wealth in the year 1788 after his death. John was his cousin; Francis was able to add his name to his Royal license hence joining the House of Curzon and House of Roper, and in his honor, he became the Henry Francis Roper-Curzon. In the modern days, some of his descendants use his names e.g. Harry Roper-Curzon, David Roper-Curzon and John Roper-Curzon.\nPresent Day.\nThere are many places named after them, such as Roper Street, based in Greenwich's in London. More specifically, it's in the Eltham constituency. Other streets include on in the Heanor\u2019s Amber Valley, and the United Kingdom called Roper Avenue. Also Roper road is in England's South East territory known as Canterbury. Roper Park in Chelsea is named after them.\nFamily Motto.\nTheir family motto also acted as a court of arms, and it states, \"Light to the English, across to the French\" (Reaney and Marvin)."}

Soon was made the capital of their colonial possessions in Eritrea, mainly because of the climate being located at more than 2000 meters of altitude.\nIn the 1930s the city was being populated by many thousands of Italian colonists and in 1940 it was mostly Italian looking (by architecture and by inhabitants way of life). That it the reason why it was called \"Piccola Roma\" (\"little Rome\"), due to the fact that it was a bit similar to the capital of Italy (Roma).\nThe capital of Eritrea experienced a huge increase in population: in 1935 there were only 4,000 Italians and 12,000 Eritreans; in 1938 there were 48,000 Italians and 36,000 Eritreans. Historian Gian Luca Podesta wrote that practically Asmara in 1940 has become an Italian city (he wrote: \"in pratica Asmara era diventata una citta' italiana\".\n\"Piccola Roma\" was a typical Italian city created in the middle of eastern Africa, where the majority of the population was southern european in appearance &amp; customs, spoke italian and practised the catholicism when WW2 started. It was going to be the industrial center of the \"Italian East Africa\", but the war blocked this development.\nHistorian Maitacli wrote that:\n\"\"The city is known for its early 20th century buildings, including the Art Deco \"Cinema Impero\" (opened in 1937 and considered by the experts one of the world's finest examples of Art D\u00e9co style building), the Cubist \"Africa Pension\", the rationalist \"Governor's Palace\", the eclectic Eritrean Orthodox \"Tewahdo\" Church, the former \"Asmara Opera House\", the futurist architecture \"Fiat Tagliero Building\", the neo-Romanesque architecture \"Roman Catholic Cathedral\", and the neoclassical architecture \"President's Palace\". The city is adorned by Italian colonial villas and mansions, one prominent example being the 'Asmara's World Bank Building'...\"\"\nMost of central Asmara was built between 1935 and 1941, so effectively the Italians managed to build almost an entire city in just six short years.\nActually (in July 2017) Asmara has been declared \"World Heritage Site\" by the UNESCO, mainly because of the architecture created during the Italian colonial years (that lasted from 1881 until 1941)."}

Its family members have held almost 14 hereditary titles, including Earl Howe, Marquess Curzon of Kedleston, Earl Curzon of Kedleston, Viscount Scarsdale, Viscount Curzon, Viscounts Howe, Baron Scarsdale, Curzon of Kedleston, Baron Ravensdale, Baron Howe, Manor of Curzon, Baron Curzon, Baronet Kedleston Hall and Baronet Mosley. \nHistory.\nIn the year 1759, when Nathaniel Curzon did the house's commissioning and then by Robert Adam's designation. The first son of the 4th Baron Scarsdale, known as George Nathaniel Curzon, was also the first Marquess Curzon of Kedleston. Kedleston was the second Baroness Ravensdale from 1896-1966, while Sir Nicholas Mosley was the 3rd Baron Ravensdale his mother was Cynthia Blanche Mosley (1898-1933), a daughter of George Curzon. The first Earl Howe was known as Curzon-Howe Richard William (1796\u20131870), the second was Curzon-Howe George Frederick (1821\u201376), and the third was Earl Howe as Curzon-Howe Richard William (1822\u20131900). Curzon Richard George (1861\u20131929), Curzon Francis Penn (1884\u20131964), Curzon Richard Assheton (1908\u201384), and Curzon Frederick Richard (b. 1951) were the fourth to seventh, respectively.\nThe Kedleston Hall is one of the estates owned by the Curzon family, and it's located in the northwest of Derby, more precisely Derbyshire's Kedleston, which is six kilometers away. Its main function is to cat as the Curzon\u2019s family seat. Even after Richard Curzon met his death, the Kedleston Hall maintained its expensive status hence compelling Francis Curzon, his cousin, to settle death dues by submitting the estate to the state.\nToday.\nSeveral facilities have been named after the Curzon family, such as Curzon Street, of which most residents believe that it was named after Mr. George Howe, who was the 3rd Viscount Howe. However, the street was transferred to another member of the Curzon family, who had maintained the surname \"Curzon\". Another street in North West expanse London is named Curzon Avenue, and it's located in the Northwich, Weaver Vale constituency. A soccer club called Curzon Ashton F.C. is located in the Ashton-under-Lyne, whose history can be traced back to the Curzon's family since several family members participated in the club's activities. Three other parks bear the Curzon family's name, namely; Curzon Park (in Chester), Curzon Park Abbey (a monastery of nuns) and Roker Curzon Park (Sunderland).\nIn honor of his cousin John Barnewall Curzon, Henry Francis Roper, who originated from the House of Roper, decided to join houses in the year 1788. To date, some of his descendants still use the name Roper-Curzon, and some of the famous members of the Curzon\u2019s family include Harry Roper-Curzon, John Roper-Curzon, and David Roper-Curzon.\nFamily Motto.\nTheir family motto states, \"Let Curzon hold what Curzon held,\" and it acted as the coat of arms' alternative."}

Vishnu is said to descend in the form of an avatar to restore balance in the world.\nThe list of included avatars varies across sects and regions. All avatars have appeared except Kalki, who will appear at the end of the Kali Yuga.\nThe order of the ancient concept of Dashavataras has been interpreted to be reflective of modern Darwinian evolution- it is the theory of evolution told as a story, written between 12-14,000 years ago. It describes the cycle of human evolution beginning in water as Matsya the fish, on to the amphibious phase (half land and water) as Koorma, the tortoise, on to begin firmly established on land as the wild boar Varaha, then Narsimha- half man- half animal, followed by Vamana, the Dwarf man, on to Parashurama, the emotionally volatile man, on to Rama, the peaceful man, Balram , then Krishna, a loving man , who is said to be succeeded by the final incarnation of Vishnu, or the last stage of evolution as Kalki, the mystical man. This is thus also a description of the evolution of consciousness.\nEtymology.\nThe Word Dashavatar means Ten Incarnations or Ten Avatars\nThe word \u201cAvatar\u201d, a Sanskrit word means \u201cdescent\u201d. In Sanatana Dharma it means the Descent/Incarnation/Manifest/Appearance of Lord/Supreme Being/Deity in an earthly embodiment.\nThere is no reference of Avatar exists in Vedas. The Bhagavad Gita discusses the subject matter associated with Avatar in textual format in Chapter 4 Slokas 5~9, where Lord Shri Krishna Himself declared the role of taking Avatar.\nWhenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion \u2014 at that time I descend Myself. To deliver the pious and to annihilate the miscreants, as well as to reestablish the principles of religion, I Myself appear, millennium after millennium. (Bhagavad Gita Chapter 4 Verses 7~8)\nList of avatars.\nVarious versions of the list of Vishnu's avatars exist, varying per region and tradition. Some lists mention Krishna as the eighth avatar and the Buddha as the ninth avatar, while others \u2013 such as the \"Yatindramatadipika\", a 17th-century summary of Srivaisnava doctrine \u2013 give Balarama as the eighth avatar and Krishna as the ninth. The latter version is followed by some Vaishnavas who don't accept the Buddha as an incarnation of Vishnu. Though no list can be uncontroversially presented as standard, the \"most accepted list found in Puranas and other texts is [...] Krishna, Buddha.\"\nThe following table summarises the position of avatars within the Dashavatara \nThe Agni Purana, Padma Purana, Garuda Purana, Linga Purana, Narada Purana, Skanda Purana and Varaha Purana mention the common (Krishna, Buddha) Dashavatara list.The Garuda Purana has two lists, one longer list with Krishna and Buddha, and a list with Balarama and Buddha, which substitutes Vamana for Rama. The Shiva Purana has Balarama and Krishna. \nThe list with Krishna and Buddha is also found in the Garuda Purana \"Saroddhara\", a commentary or \u2018extracted essence\u2019 of the Garuda Purana (i.e. not the Purana itself, with which it seems to be confused):The Fish, the Tortoise, the Boar, the Man-Lion, the Dwarf, Parasurama, Rama, Krisna, Buddha, and also Kalki: These ten names should always be meditated upon by the wise. Those who recite them near the diseased are called relatives.\n---Garuda Purana Saroddhara by Navanidhirama (translated by E. Wood and S.V. Subrahmanyam), Chapter VIII, Verses 10-11"}

Italian Tripoli was under Italian control from 1911 until January 1943: officially it disappeared in 1947 after the Peace Treaty following WWII. It was called \"Tripoli italiana\" in Italian language and the inhabitants were called \"Tripolini\". \nHistory.\nDuring the Italo-Turkish War of 1911, Tripoli was conquered by the Italian Kingdom. The Italian fleet appeared off Ottoman Tripoli in the evening of September 28, 1911: the city was quickly conquered by 1,500 Italian sailors, welcomed by the population. \nBy the 1912 treaty signed in Ouchy, Italian sovereignty was acknowledged by the Ottomans. Italy officially granted autonomy to the region around Tripoli after the war, but gradually occupied the region called \"Tripolitania\" by the Italians. Originally administered as part of a single colony, Tripoli and its surrounding province were a separate colony from 26 June 1927 to 3 December 1934, when all Italian possessions in North Africa were merged into one colony called \"Italian Libya\".\nSince 1937 the governor Italo Balbo started a policy of immigration of Italians (mainly farmers) who were called the \"Ventimilli\" and some of them settled in the area of Italian Tripoli. So, by the end of 1937, the city has 108,240 inhabitants, including 39,096 Italians. At the start of WWII Italian Tripoli had 111,124 inhabitants of which the Italians were 41,304: 37% of the city's inhabitants. Additionally there were nearly 18,000 Jews in the Tripoli area.\nIndeed after the Italian occupation of Libya in 1911, the Jews made great strides in education and economic conditions: at that time, there were about 21,000 Jews in the country, the majority in Tripoli. In the late 1930s, Fascist anti-Jewish laws were gradually enforced, and Jews were subject to moderate repression: still, by 1941 -due even to the partial rejection of those laws by governor Italo Balbo- the Jews accounted for a fifth of the population of Tripoli and maintained 44 synagogues.\nThe city grew under Italian rule, with new sewage, new hospitals and schools, new avenues and buildings, new airport and a huge enlarged seaport.\nIn 1941 and 1942 Italian Tripoli -according to estimates of the Italian government- reached a temporary population of nearly 150,000 inhabitants, due to the arrival of many Italians from Benghazi and Cyrenaica who took refuge from the British army attacks during WWII. As a consequence Tripoli was in those years -for the first time since the Arab conquest in 643 AD- a city mostly Christian.\nAfter the end of the war the Italians started to go away from Tripoli and now only a few of them remain in the city."}

They talk about temperature, heat, work, and entropy. They are used in thermodynamics and other sciences, for example chemistry.\nThermodynamics has three main laws: the first law, the second law, and the third law. Then there was another law, called the \"zeroth law.\" The law of conservation of mass is also an important idea in thermodynamics, but it is not called a law.\nZeroth law.\nThe \"zeroth law of thermodynamics\" says temperature is an empirical parameter in thermodynamic systems. It says the transitive relationship between the temperatures of multiple bodies in thermal equilibrium. The law says: If two systems are both in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other.\nFirst law.\nThe \"first law of thermodynamics\" is a version of the law of conservation of energy, adapted for thermodynamic systems. The law of conservation of energy states that the total energy of an isolated system is constant; energy can be transformed from one form to another, but can be neither created nor destroyed. It can also be stated in the following form:The energy gained (or lost) by a system is equal to the energy lost (or gained) by its surroundings.\nSecond law.\nThe \"second law of thermodynamics\" says that some things can't be undone after they are done. This indicates that entropy is real. It states that, in an isolated system, entropy can increase but cannot decrease. It can be stated as follows:Natural processes tend to go only one way, toward less usable energy and more disorder. \nThird law.\nThe third law of thermodynamics \"can be stated as:\"A system's entropy approaches a constant value as its temperature approaches absolute zero."}

{"id": "804193", "revid": "373511", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=804193", "title": "Australian Shepherd", "text": "The Australian Shepherd, or sometimes referred to as the Aussie Shepherd, is a medium-sized breed of dog which was developed in the United States, despite it's name.\nIt is very similar in it's appearance to the English Shepherd and Border Collie, and indeed, studies have shown they are very similar in relation. Like many herding dogs, they show considerable drive and energy, being best at jobs such as search and rescue dogs, disaster dogs, therapy dogs, guide dogs, etc. For these reasons, they have become the 17th most popular dog breed in the United States.\nPhysical trait information.\nSize.\nThe Australian Shepherd is usually a medium-sized breed. They can weigh from and stand from in height. The Australian Shepherd Club of America (ASCA) standard says the Australian shepherd must stand between at the shoulders, females being and males measuring ; however, quality is not to be sacrificed in favor of size.\nColor.\nThe known Aussie colors are solid black, solid red (liver), blue merle, and red/liver merle; and these colors may also have copper (tan) points or white markings in various combinations on the face, chest, and legs. A black or red dog with copper and white trim is called 'tricolor' or 'tri', while a black or red dog with white trim but no copper is called 'bicolor' or 'bi'. White, rather than skin color, on or around the ears is an indicator of increased risk for deafness. Too much white on the face and ears can place an individual dog at greater risk for sunburn and subsequent skin cancer.\nThe wide variety of color comes from the color allele, which is either black (B) dominant or red (b), and the dominant merle allele (M). Together, these provide four coat-color aspects that can appear in any combination:\nThe merle allele, which produces a mingled or patchwork combination of dark and light areas, is the coat pattern most commonly associated with the breed. This merle (M) is dominant, so heterozygous dogs (Mm) show the pigmentation pattern; however, when two merles are bred, the statistical risk is 25% of the offspring will end up with the two copies of the merle gene (homozygous). These dogs usually have a mostly white coat and blue irises and are often deaf, blind, or both. In this case, the deafness and blindness are linked to having two copies of the merle gene, which disrupts pigmentation and produces these health defects. The tri-colored (red, black, and white) Merles will have a 1/4 chance of being blind because of the genes when breeding two Merle colored dogs for the recessive fur color.\nAll black and blue merle dogs have black noses, eye rims, and lips. All red and red merle dogs have liver or brown noses, eye rims, and lips.\nAlso, variety is seen in the Aussie's eye color, and they are often heterochromatic. An early nickname for the breed was \"ghost-eye dog\". Aussie eyes may be any shade of brown or blue; they may have two different colored eyes, or even have bicolored or \"split eyes\" (for example, a half-brown, half-blue eye), which appear to be similar to the merle coloration. Merled eyes exist where one color is mixed in and swirled with another. Any combination of eye color is fine in the breed standard, so long as the eyes are healthy. In general, however, black Aussies (self, bi-color, or tri-color) tend to have brown eyes, while red (self, bi-color, or tri-color) Aussies usually have amber eyes, though these Aussies may also carry the blue-eyed gene.\nThe merle type in Australian Shepherds is very similar to the coat color in Mitf mouse mutants.\nTail.\nAlthough some Aussies are born with naturally bobbed or partially bobbed (stubby) tails, the majority are born with full, long tails. Breeders have historically docked the tails when the puppies are born.

{"id": "804342", "revid": "1066954", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=804342", "title": "Elu (Portuguese pronoun)", "text": "The Elu\" system () is based on a set of linguistic proposals created with the purpose of preparing the Portuguese language with a neuter grammatical gender. The most prominent proposal is the personal neopronouns elu, delu, nelu, and daquelu\", intended to be a proposal for how to refer to non-binary people (whose gender identity is not male or female) or whose gender is unknown, or irrelevant, as well as groups with different genders, without resorting to the \"generic masculine\". These proposals can be used by and for anyone, regardless of gender.\nThe pronoun \"elu\" tries to present the least number of problems in its use when trying to function smoothly in oral speech, listening, writing and visual identification, creating similarity between \"ela\" (\"she\"), \"ele\" (\"he\"), and \"elu\" (functionally similar to singular they).\nNouns in Portuguese all have grammatical gender, and this gender impacts some grammatical inflections. Grammatical gender is different from personal gender identity\u2015rather, words referring to a generic individual with unknown gender identity still carries grammatical gender. For example, the word \"pessoa\" (\"person\") is grammatically feminine, but indicates no specific gender of the person referred to. The gender inflection appears explicitly when in the context of an inflectied adjective. With the feminine nouns such as \"cidade\" (\"city\"; plural \"cidades\"), the adjective meaning \"beautiful\" (currently written generically as \"belo\" in dictionaries) would become \"cidade bela\", \"cidades belas\" (\"beautiful city/cities\"). Likewise, this works with a masculine noun such as \"carro\" (\"car\"; plural \"carros\"): \"carro belo\", \"carros belos\" (\"beautiful car/cars\").\nThe Portuguese language as a rule determines that the plural of nouns, when covering individuals of the feminine and masculine gender, is made based on the generic masculine: a collective of \"vinte meninas\" (\"twenty girls\") and \"dez meninos\" (\"ten boys\"), is said as \"trinta meninos\" (literally, \"thirty boys\"). This form of plural formation is considered sexist by certain groups and individuals, resulting in proposals for a neutral gender to be adopted, such as \"thirty children\" (\"trinta menines\").\nA similar known neopronoun in Portuguese is \"ile\", also called \"sistema ile\" (\"ile system\"), was popularized in 2020. The systems happen to be same when applying neolanguage beyond pronouns, they use \u27e8-e\u27e9 suffixes."}

The water content can reach as high as 90-99% depending on the polymer concentration. It contains polymers that are attracted to water, they swell and hold large amounts of water while maintaining their structure due to chemical or physical cross-linking of individual polymer chains. The physical cross-linked hydrogels are easily pulled and relaxed, like a rubber band. The chemically cross-linked hydrogels avoid deformation. The behaviour of hydrogels is typically viscoelastic which is associated with the water and the movement of polymer networks in fluids. Similar to other polymers, there are natural and man-made hydrogels. The man-made hydrogels are also known as synthetic, this allows the hydrogels to have a longer service life, hold more water, and have greater strength. \nThere are many types of hydrogels. The most common ones are pH-sensitive hydrogels, which respond to pH changes in the environment. Temperature-sensitive hydrogels, which are affected by how hot or cold the environment is. Electro-sensitive hydrogels, which either shrink or expand when an electric field is applied. Lastly, the light-responsive hydrogels respond to light. \nIn many ways hydrogels are similar to our bodies because the human body is made out of mainly water and matrix materials that are surrounded by cells. This is why hydrogels can be used in tissue engineering. Hydrogels are filled with water so they mimic tissue environments, this means they are optimal to deliver cells and repair damaged tissue."}

Electrowinning is one of the last processes in metal production. It commonly follows leaching which is a process that dissolves minerals into a solution. \nProcess.\nThe electrical current is passed from the inert electrode, called the anode, and passes through the metal containing solution, called the electrolyte, and the metal is plated on another electrode, called the cathode. The ability to plate a metal depends on the reduction potential. The reduction potential depends on the many factors such as the metal in question, the solution temperature, the pH of the solution and other factors. The rate at which the metal can be produced depends on the amount of current being passed through the solution.\nIndustry.\nIndustrially the process is made up of a square cathode with equal sized anodes on each side so that the metal can be plated evenly on both sides of the cathode. A cell consists of alternating anodes and cathodes, starting and ending with anodes. A production plant consists of many cells allowing for production of lots of metal."}

They are often utilized in aggregates production, construction material recycling and in mining operations. \nThere are four traditional types of crushers in materials engineering. They are known as jaw crushers, gyratory crushers, cone crushers and roll crushers. The first two crushers mentioned are the most common when it comes to mineral processing. Roll crushers are a relatively new type of crusher and they are just starting to become more and more popular in mineral processing. \nThe main idea behind how jaw crushers work is that there is a hinge plate that moves back and forth with a fixed plate is held up against the prior hinge plate. The beginning of the process has the jaws of the crusher open to receive a rock. The hinge plate, like a big jaw-bone, bites down on the rock and crushes it.\nGyratory crushers have a conical outer wall and a large spindle suspended from a bearing. There is a circular propeller at the bottom of the crusher that oscillates, spins around, really fast and compresses the rocks that enter.\nFor roll crushers, there are two side by side rolls, one fixed and the other can move a little bit from side to side. The gap between the rollers is what determines the output size of the rocks. Forcing rocks through these gaps produces a large amount of shear stress on them and causes them to break apart.\nCone Crushers are compression-type crushers that are typically found in secondary crushing stages but can be used as the primary crusher in certain applications. They handle medium hard to very hard, abrasive materials that can be dry or wet but not sticky. Cone Crushers are typically found in quarried materials and sand and gravel applications."}

When we solve one equation, this method can help us to get a number that is very close to the real solution. \nThink about a continuous function F(x). If the curve of F(x) passes through the x-axis, it means that there must be one specific x number which makes F(x) = 0, in other words, a solution. But how to judge whether the curve passes the x-axis or not? We pick one section with lower boundary a1 and upper boundary b1. Then we calculate F(a) and F(b). If F(b) has different signal with F(a) (or F(a)*F(b) &lt; 0), the F(x) curve will pass through the x-axis in this section, which means F(x) must have a solution in this section. In this way, we can estimate a range of the solution. \nTo make our estimation more precise, we need to shorten the range which contains the solution. We divide this section into two equal parts: ( a , a/2+b/2) and (a/2+b/2, b). Then we apply the same method to judge whether there is a solution in each section. If there is no solutions in one section( F(a)*F(a/2+b/2) &gt; 0 or F(a/2+b/2)*F(b)&gt; 0), we ignore this section. If there is a solution in one section (F(a)*F(a/2+b/2) &lt; 0 or F(a/2+b/2)*F(b) &lt; 0), we continue to shorten the range until the range is smaller than the error of estimation we expected. Finally, we take the middle point of the final range as a solution of F(x)."}

It can only be transformed from one form to another. This law also applies to nutrition. \nCalories in versus calories out.\nMany experts disagree with the belief of counting calories as a method to lose bodyfat. 1 pound of bodyfat roughly equals 3500 calories. Therefore, eating 500 calories less everyday for 7 days straight would result in exactly 1 pound of loss in bodyfat. Several studies have proven this to be false solidifying the belief that counting calories does not work. This disparity can be explained.\nReasons.\n1. Thermic effect of food: 1 calorie of protein is not the same as 1 calorie of carbohydrates or fats. The body requires energy to digest food. Fats require only 0-3% of the total energy from food to get digested. Carbohydrates require 5-10% of energy while proteins require 20-30% of energy. Therefore, the macronutrient profile (protein, carbohydrates and fats ratio) play an important role in weight loss.\n2. NEAT: Non exercise activity thermogenesis or NEAT is the amount of energy a person uses during daily activities. Examples of NEAT include jittering, walking, brushing teeth and even writing. People generally feel weaker when they consume less calories so they tend to move less reducing NEAT.\n3. Miscounting calories: Studies have shown that over 90% of the population underestimate their daily caloric consumption. \nConclusion.\nUltimately, calories consumed versus calories spent will always hold true. In order to lose weight, one must consume less calories and move more."}

It is also known as a disc grinder or side grinder. They are commonly used in machine shops and metal workshops. Most angle grinders today are powered by electricity. They can be corded or battery-powered. Angle grinders can be used for cutting, grinding, and polishing objects.\nThere are different kinds of discs that are used for various materials and tasks. Angle grinders can use grinding stones, sanding discs, wire brush wheels, cut-off discs, abrasive grinding discs, and polishing pads. Angle grinders come in different disc sizes and motor specifications. Other differences include a power source, rpm, and arbor size. Generally disc size and power increase together. Disc size is measured in imperial or metric units. Pneumatic grinders are generally used for lighter duty jobs where more precision is required. Electric grinders are more commonly used for larger, heavy-duty jobs.\nAngle grinders generate sparks when cutting ferrous metals. The blades on the angle grinder may also break during operation. Proper personal protective equipment must always be worn when using an angle grinder. Angle grinders should never be used without their guard or handle attached. Inspect the discs for cracks, defects, and wear before using an angle grinder."}

Hassabis met Legg when both were postdocs at University College London's Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, and he and Suleyman had been friends through family. Hassabis also recruited his university friend and Elixir partner David Silver.\nDeepMind's mission is to \"solve intelligence\" and then use intelligence \"to solve everything else\". More concretely, DeepMind aims to use powerful general-purpose learning algorithms to build an artificial general intelligence (AGI).\nThe company was bought by Google for \u00a3400 million. \nThey created AlphaGo, a program which defeated world champion Lee Sedol at the complex game of Go. Go had been considered a holy grail of AI, for its high number of possible board positions and resistance to existing programming techniques. However, AlphaGo beat European champion Fan Hui 5-0 in October 2015 before winning 4-1 against former world champion Lee Sedol in March 2016. \nMore recently, DeepMind turned its artificial intelligence to protein-folding, one of the toughest problems in science. In December 2018, DeepMind's tool AlphaFold won the 13th Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) by successfully predicting the most accurate structure for 25 out of 43 proteins.\nAlthough Hassabis is expert at many games, he does not program specific rules into Deep Mind. For Go and chess, the machine played many games with itself, learning from its results. In other words it taught itself how to play, given the basic rules of the game. "}

Henry Clay Work wrote it in 1876. Henry Clay Work also wrote \"Marching Through Georgia\". British brass bands and colliery bands play \"My Grandfather's Clock\". Bluegrass musicians also play it.\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" says the word \"grandfather clock\" comes from this song. Before that, grandfather clocks were called \"longcase clocks\". In 1905, Harry Macdonough and the Haydn Quartet (known then as the \"Edison Quartet\") made the first recording of this song that people know about.\nStoryline.\nHenry Clay Work saw a clock in a Piercebridge hotel and thought of the song.\nThe song is told from a grandchild's point of view. The song is about their grandfather's clock.\nThe clock is purchased on the morning of the grandfather's birth and works perfectly for 90 years, requiring only that it be wound at the end of each week.\nThe clock seems to know good and bad things that happen in the grandfather's life: It rings 24 chimes when the grandfather brings his new wife into his house. Near the grandfather's death, it rings an alarm, so the family gathers by his bed. After the grandfather dies, the clock stops and it never works again.\nSequel.\nWork wrote a sequel to the song two years later. The grandchild is the narrator again. The grandson says he is sad that the clock no longer works. The clock is sold to a junk dealer, who sells its parts and sells its case for people to burn. In the grandfather's house, the clock is replaced by a wall clock. The grandchild does not like the wall clock and calls it \"that vain, stuck-up thing on the wall\". The sequel was never as popular as the original.\nCovers and inspirations.\nThe song was performed and translated many times. In the Czech version, sung by the country band Taxmeni, the song continues with an additional, joyful strophe, narrating further events in the grandson's life: the birth of his son and the purchase of a new clock on the same day, to maintain the family tradition.\n\"My Grandfather's Clock\" was often played in Britain on \"Children's Favourites\". It was recorded by the Radio Revellers. In the United States, a version, without the last stanza of lyrics was recorded on an extended-play 45 rpm vinyl record on the Peter Pan label. (The other song on that side was \"The Syncopated Clock\", and the other side had \"The Arkansas Traveler\" and \"Red River Valley\".) Johnny Cash covered the song on his 1959 album \"Songs of Our Soil\". Evelyn Knight recorded the song for Decca Records. In 1959, it was included on the Four Lads' album, \"Swing Along\". Other versions became popular in other countries, for example, in Japan, singer Ken Hirai performed a cover, which became massively popular in 2002.\nIn March 1961, on his album \"Swing Low\", Sam Cooke sang the song.\nBing Crosby sang the song in a medley on his album \"101 Gang Songs\" (1961).\nThe song was the inspiration for the 1963 \"Twilight Zone\" episode \"Ninety Years Without Slumbering\".\nThe Big 3 recorded the song in their album \"Live at the Recording Studio\" in 1964\nA popular clock toy, marketed by Fisher-Price from 1962 to 1968, had a dial on it that, when turned, caused the music box mechanism in the toy to play the song along with clock-like ticking and moving hands on the face of the clock. A new version of the toy (which is completely made of plastic and has other activities like a clicking plastic mouse on the side) has been manufactured by Fisher-Price since 1994. Other companies have also made imitations of the toy worldwide.\nJon Pertwee recorded a version in 1966 for the children's album \"Children's Favourites\", on the Music for Pleasure record label.\nJohn Fahey recorded a solo guitar version on his 1967 album \"Days Have Gone By\".\nJoan Morris recorded it in 1975, on \"Who Shall Rule This American Nation (Nonesuch)\", an album of songs by Work.\nIn 1983, Fred Penner, a Canadian children's entertainer, covered \"My Grandfather's Clock\" on the LP album \"Special Delivery\", which was later rereleased as \"Ebenezer Sneezer\" on CD in 1994.\nRed Grammer recorded the song on his 1994 family music recording, \"Down The Do Re Mi\".\nThe Kenneth Williams character Rambling Syd Rumpo wrote a joke version of this song, \"My Grandfather's Grunge\", on the BBC radio show \"Round the Horne\". It was written by Barry Took and Marty Feldman.\nGarrison Keillor and the cast of the radio show \"A Prairie Home Companion\" recorded a parody titled \"My Grandmother's Cat\", telling the story of an old woman who overfed her cat until it was big enough to knock her down and try to eat her.\n\"My Grandfather's Clock\" is a playable song in the 2008 video game \"Wii Music\".\nThis song was also used in the video game, \"Five Nights at Freddy's 2\", made by Scott Cawthon. It was released on November 10, 2014. The chorus of the song plays whenever a music box is wound up to keep one of the game's animatronic enemies away.\nIt was also sung by Maple and Cinnamon in the third volume of \"Nekopara\" visual novel series.\nOriginal Lyrics.\nThe City Green in Union Park of Middletown, Connecticut includes this bust of the author near his birthplace.\nMy grandfather's clock was too large for the shelf,\nSo it stood ninety years on the floor;\nIt was taller by half than the old man himself,\nThough it weighed not a pennyweight more.\nIt was bought on the morn of the day that he was born,\nAnd was always his treasure and pride;\nBut it stopp'd short \u2014 never to go again \u2014\nWhen the old man died.\nIn watching its pendulum swing to and fro,\nMany hours had he spent while a boy.\nAnd in childhood and manhood the clock seemed to know\nAnd to share both his grief and his joy.\nFor it struck twenty-four when he entered at the door,\nWith a blooming and beautiful bride;\nBut it stopp'd short \u2014 never to go again \u2014\nWhen the old man died.\nMy grandfather said that of those he could hire,\nNot a servant so faithful he found;\nFor it wasted no time, and had but one desire \u2014\nAt the close of each week to be wound.\nAnd it kept in its place \u2014 not a frown upon its face,\nAnd its hands never hung by its side.\nBut it stopp'd short \u2014 never to go again \u2014\nWhen the old man died.\nIt rang an alarm in the dead of the night \u2014\nAn alarm that for years had been dumb;\nAnd we knew that his spirit was pluming for flight \u2014\nThat his hour of departure had come.\nStill the clock kept the time, with a soft and muffled chime,\nAs we silently stood by his side;\nBut it stopp'd short \u2014 never to go again \u2014\nWhen the old man died."}

The incident with Jackson and Timberlake made CBS and MTV remove Jackson's songs from its radio and television channels. The Federal Communications Commission gave CBS a fine of US$27,500 for the incident. The fine was made bigger for US$325,000 and then even bigger, for US$550,000. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals removed the fine in 2011. The FCC tried to put another fine on CBS in 2012, but it was rejected.\nThe incident made Janet Jackson the most searched words ever on the Internet. It also became the most watched event on TiVo and made 35,000 people become new subscribers to TiVo. The term \"wardrobe malfunction\" (meaning an error related to clothing) was made because of the incident. It was later added to \"Webster's Dictionary\"."}

Later, the tasks require the participants to hurt themselves. The final task requires the player to commit suicide.\nWhen people want to quit, they are threatened. Sometimes, this includes threats to the family of the participant.\nThe first to report on this was the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta, in 2016. It linked many suicides of children. All these children had been members of the group \"F57\", in the Russian social network called VK. The article claimed there were 130 suicides because of the challenge. The article was later criticized, because it made connections where none existed. None of the suicides were found to be related to the activities of the group. There were several suicides which have been linked to the challenge.

He felt that \"from the opener, the album seems to be set up like a linear narrative about a crumbling relationship, but it doesn't quite play out that way, with the scenes shuffled out of order. None of it's all that profound, but Cole sells it all extremely well. [Her] voice is sweet and ringing, like a wiser version of Lil' Mo who has had to weather a tremendous amount of drama. She could be around for a while.\" Janet Tzou, writing for \"Entertainment Weekly\" found that \"Cole certainly nails all the basics on \"The Way It Is\": big-name guest talent and husky ballads lamenting those tricky matters of the heart.

{"id": "805142", "revid": "68157", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=805142", "title": "Giant planet", "text": "A giant planet is any planet much larger than Earth. They are usually mostly composed of low-boiling-point materials (gases or ices), rather than rock or other solid matter. Massive solid planets also exist. There are four giant planets in the Solar System: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Many extrasolar giant planets have been identified orbiting other stars.\nGiant planets are also sometimes called jovian planets, the adjective for the name Jupiter. They are sometimes known as gas giants. Many astronomers use the latter term only for Jupiter and Saturn. They classify Uranus and Neptune, which have different compositions, as ice giants. Both names are potentially misleading: all of the giant planets consist primarily of fluids above their critical points, where distinct gas and liquid phases do not exist. The principal components are hydrogen and helium in the case of Jupiter and Saturn, and water, ammonia and methane in the case of Uranus and Neptune.\nThe defining differences between a very low-mass brown dwarf and a gas giant are not clear. One school of thought is based on formation; the other, on the physics of the interior. Part of the debate is whether \"brown dwarfs\" must, by definition, have had nuclear fusion at some point in their history.\nTerminology.\nThe term \"gas giant\" was coined in 1952 by the science fiction writer James Blish. It was originally used to refer to all giant planets. Arguably it is something of a misnomer, because for most of thire volume the pressure is so high that matter is not in gaseous form. Other than the upper layers of the atmosphere, all matter is likely beyond the critical point, where there is no distinction between liquids and gases. \"Fluid planet\" would be a more accurate term. Jupiter also has metallic hydrogen near its center, but much of its volume is hydrogen, helium, and traces of other gases above their critical points. The observable atmospheres of all these planets (at less than unit optical depth) are quite thin compared to their radii, only extending perhaps one percent of the way to the center. Thus the observable portions are gaseous (in contrast to Mars and Earth, which have gaseous atmospheres through which the crust can be seen).\nThe rather misleading term has caught on because planetary scientists typically use \"rock\", \"gas\", and \"ice\" as shorthands for classes of elements and compounds found on planets, whatever the actual phase of matter. In the outer Solar System, hydrogen and helium are referred to as \"gases\"; water, methane, and ammonia as \"ices\"; and silicates and metals as \"rock\". When deep planetary interiors are considered, it may not be far off to say that, by \"ice\" astronomers mean oxygen and carbon, by \"rock\" they mean silicon, and by \"gas\" they mean hydrogen and helium. The many ways in which Uranus and Neptune differ from Jupiter and Saturn have led some to use the term only for the planets similar to the latter two. With this terminology in mind, some astronomers have started referring to Uranus and Neptune as ice giants to indicate the predominance of the \"ices\" (in fluid form) in their interior composition.\nThe alternative term \"jovian planet\" refers to the Roman god Jupiter, and meant all these planets were similar to Jupiter.\nObjects large enough to start deuterium fusion (above 13 Jupiter masses for solar composition) are called brown dwarfs, and these occupy the mass range between that of large giant planets and the lowest-mass stars. The 13-Jupiter-mass cutoff is a rule of thumb, not something of precise physical significance. Larger objects will burn most of their deuterium and smaller ones will burn only a little, and the Jupiter mass value is somewhere in between. The amount of deuterium burnt depends not only on the mass but also on the composition of the planet, especially on the amount of helium and deuterium present. The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia includes objects up to 60 Jupiter masses, and the Exoplanet Data Explorer up to 24 Jupiter masses.\nDescription.\nA giant planet is a massive planet and has a thick atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. They may have a dense molten core of rocky elements, or the core may have completely dissolved and dispersed throughout the planet if the planet is hot enough. In \"traditional\" giant planets such as Jupiter and Saturn (the gas giants) hydrogen and helium constitute most of the mass of the planet, whereas they only make up an outer envelope on Uranus and Neptune, which are instead mostly composed of water, ammonia, and methane and therefore increasingly referred to as \"ice giants\".\nExtrasolar giant planets that orbit very close to their stars are the exoplanets that are easiest to detect. These are called hot Jupiters and hot Neptunes because they have very high surface temperatures. Hot Jupiters were, until the advent of space-borne telescopes, the most common form of exoplanet known, due to the relative ease of detecting them with ground-based instruments.\nGiant planets are commonly said to lack solid surfaces, but it is more accurate to say that they lack surfaces altogether since the gases that constitute them simply become thinner and thinner with increasing distance from the planets' centers, eventually becoming indistinguishable from the interplanetary medium. Therefore, landing on a giant planet may or may not be possible, depending on the size and composition of its core.\nSubtypes.\nGas giants.\nGas giants consist mostly of hydrogen and helium. The Solar System's gas giants, Jupiter and Saturn, have heavier elements making up between 3 and 13 percent of their mass. Gas giants are thought to consist of an outer layer of molecular hydrogen, surrounding a layer of liquid metallic hydrogen, with a probable molten core with a rocky composition.\nJupiter and Saturn's outermost portion of the hydrogen atmosphere has many layers of visible clouds that are mostly composed of water and ammonia. The layer of metallic hydrogen makes up the bulk of each planet, and is referred to as \"metallic\" because the very high pressure turns hydrogen into an electrical conductor. The core is thought to consist of heavier elements at such high temperatures (20,000 K) and pressures that their properties are poorly understood.\nIce giants.\nIce giants have distinctly different interior compositions from gas giants. The Solar System's ice giants, Uranus and Neptune, have a hydrogen-rich atmosphere that extends from the cloud tops down to about 80% (Uranus) or 85% (Neptune) of their radius. Below this, they are predominantly \"icy\", i.e. consist mostly of water, methane, and ammonia. There is also some rock and gas, but various proportions of ice\u2013rock\u2013gas could mimic pure ice, so that the exact proportions are unknown.\nUranus and Neptune have very hazy atmospheric layers with small amounts of methane, giving them aquamarine colors; light blue and ultramarine respectively. Both have magnetic fields that are sharply inclined to their axes of rotation.\nUnlike the other giant planets, Uranus has an extreme tilt that causes its seasons to be severely pronounced. The two planets also have other subtle but important differences. Uranus has more hydrogen and helium than Neptune despite being less massive overall. Neptune is therefore denser and has much more internal heat and a more active atmosphere. The Nice model, in fact, suggests that Neptune formed closer to the Sun than Uranus did, and should therefore have more heavy elements.\nMassive solid planets.\nMassive solid planets can also exist. \nSolid planets up to thousands of Earth masses may be able to form around massive stars (B-type and O-type stars; 5\u2013120 solar masses), where the protoplanetary disk would contain enough heavy elements. Also, these stars have high UV radiation and winds that could photoevaporate the gas in the disk, leaving just the heavy elements.&lt;ref name=\"mass/radius sold\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nFor comparison, Neptune's mass equals 17 Earth masses, Jupiter has 318 Earth masses, and the 13 Jupiter-mass limit used in the IAU's working definition of an exoplanet equals approximately 4000 Earth masses.\nSuper-Puffs.\nA super-puff is a type of exoplanet with a mass only a few times larger than\nEarth\u2019s but a radius larger than Neptune, giving it a very low mean density. They are cooler and less massive than the inflated low-density hot-Jupiters.\nThe most extreme examples known are the three planets around Kepler-51 which are all Jupiter-sized but with densities below 0.1 g/cm3.\nExtrasolar giant planets.\nBecause of the limited techniques available to detect exoplanets, many of those found to date have been of a size associated, in the Solar System, with giant planets. Because these large planets are inferred to share more in common with Jupiter than with the other giant planets, some have claimed that \"jovian planet\" is a more accurate term for them. Many of the exoplanets are much closer to their parent stars and hence much hotter than the giant planets in the Solar System, making it possible that some of those planets are a type not observed in the Solar System. Considering the relative abundances of the elements in the universe (about 98% hydrogen and helium) it would be surprising to find a predominantly rocky planet more massive than Jupiter. On the other hand, models of planetary-system formation have suggested that giant planets would be inhibited from forming as close to their stars as many of the extrasolar giant planets have been observed to orbit.\nAtmospheres.\nThe bands seen in the atmosphere of Jupiter are due to counter-circulating streams of material called zones and belts, encircling the planet parallel to its equator. The zones are the lighter bands, and are at higher altitudes in the atmosphere. They have an internal updraft and are high-pressure regions. The belts are the darker bands, are lower in the atmosphere, and have an internal downdraft. They are low-pressure regions. These structures are somewhat analogous to the high and low-pressure cells in Earth's atmosphere, but they have a very different structure\u2014latitudinal bands that circle the entire planet, as opposed to small confined cells of pressure. This appears to be a result of the rapid rotation and underlying symmetry of the planet. There are no oceans or landmasses to cause local heating and the rotation speed is much higher than that of Earth.\nThere are smaller structures as well: spots of different sizes and colors. On Jupiter, the most noticeable of these features is the Great Red Spot, which has been present for at least 300 years. These structures are huge storms. Some such spots are thunderheads as well."}

This rocket is made from stainless steel, a material that is rarely used in rockets. It may become the tallest, heaviest, and most powerful rocket in the world. The \"dearMoon\" project and Artemis program have Starship as their main rocket. SpaceX has repeatedly said that one day, the spacecraft might send humans to Mars.\nThe bottom of the Starship rocket is the Super Heavy booster, and the top is the Starship spacecraft. Both could launch and land many times at special pads and boats. This may make a Starship launch much cheaper. They also have many rocket engines at the bottom, called Raptor. These Raptor engines burn methane with oxygen to boost the Starship rocket into orbit.\nBetween 2005 and 2018, SpaceX imagined many rockets similar to Starship. Since then, the company has been building many Super Heavy and Starship at Starbase, Texas. On 25 July 2019\", Starhopper\" hopped and tested the Raptor engine for the first time. On 9 December 2020, Starship SN8 for the first time launched up to high. However, one Raptor engine melted, crashing the spacecraft to the ground. On 5 May 2021, SN15 launched and landed successfully. There are plans for SN20 and Super Heavy BN4 to be launched into orbit.\nParts.\nStarship has two parts: the Super Heavy booster and the Starship spacecraft. Both Super Heavy and Starship should be able to land and launch many times quickly. That is the reason why the Starship rocket is often called a fully-reusable rocket. As of November 2021, no other rockets except Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy's booster can do this. Most of the rocket is made from SAE 304 stainless steel, the most common type of all. \nStarship may become the tallest, heaviest, and most powerful rocket in the world. It can carry of cargo to low Earth orbit. For comparison, the Space Shuttle could only carry to the International Space Station. In this example, the International Space Station has an even lower orbit than Starship. The Starship spacecraft can also carry cargo to higher Earth orbits, the Moon, and Mars. \nSuper Heavy and Starship must pass many tests before launch. Firstly, they are filled with nitrogen gas to check for leaks. Then, cold liquid nitrogen fills and drains from Starship and Super Heavy to check the tanks' strength. Finally, propellant fills their tanks, and the Raptor engines are fired. \nSuper Heavy booster.\nBelow the rocket is a tall Super Heavy booster. This booster can hold about of propellant. In this example, Super Heavy and Starship's propellants are liquid methane and liquid oxygen. The booster is made from stainless steel rings. These rings are thick, tall, and diameter.\nAt the bottom of the booster are 33 Raptor rocket engines. They can make of thrust, twice more than the Saturn V. The thrust speeds up the rocket to .\nOn top of Super Heavy are four boxes containing fins in a grid pattern. These boxes are usually called grid fins, like those of the Falcon 9. Grid fins rotate to control and guide the booster while falling from the sky. When just a few kilometers or miles above ground, Super Heavy fires its engines and lands on the tower arms.\nStarship spacecraft.\nOn top of the booster sits a tall Starship spacecraft. The spacecraft can hold about of propellant. Its propellant is the same as Super Heavy's, which are liquid methane and liquid oxygen. The Starship spacecraft is made from stainless steel rings, similar to Super Heavy.\nAt the bottom of the spacecraft are six rocket engines. Three of them are regular Raptor engines; three others are Raptor Vacuum engines. These regular Raptor engines work inside the air, while Raptor Vacuum engines work inside the vacuum.\nThere are two kinds of propellant tanks inside Starship; these are main tanks and header tanks. The main tanks store propellant for almost all functions of the spacecraft. The only exception here is when Starship lands, only then do the spacecraft use its header tanks.\nThere are four flaps that connect to Starship's body. Two large flaps are at the bottom of the spacecraft, and two small flaps are at the top of the spacecraft. They are made from stainless steel sheets and bend to a trapezoid shape. The flaps can control Starship's falling speed and direction.\nA black heat shield covers one side of the spacecraft. The heat shield is made from ceramic hexagon tiles and sheets of ceramic wool. They help to protect Starship from hot plasma, made when the spacecraft enters Earth's atmosphere. Starship's heat shield could be durable and used many times.\nKinds of Starship.\nIn the past, the Starship spacecraft would only bring cargo and astronauts to Mars. However, as of 2021, SpaceX imagined many kinds of Starships that do different tasks. They are different from each other by having parts added, removed, or changed.\nSome Starships might go between boats on Earth's sea. It could go from New York City to Shanghai in 39 minutes, much faster than an airplane's 15 hours. SpaceX thinks that Starship flights might be as cheap as a business class ticket in the far future. As of January 2021, the United States Air Force is interested in this idea.\nHowever, most Starships would carry satellites, cargo, and humans to Earth orbit. They would have a large door that rotates along a hinge. These Starships could catch space debris as well.\nSome Starships would carry propellant instead of cargo. These spacecraft can fuel another spacecraft in orbit. Via fueling, these spacecraft would have more range and can go further.\nStarship HLS (Starship Human Landing System) will land astronauts on the Moon in the Artemis program. It can take propellant from other Starships to have more range. The spacecraft would not have a heat shield or body flaps. However, it will have solar panels and landing rocket engines. Starship HLS can be fueled and connected to the Orion spacecraft.\nStarships going to Mars also need fueling as well. That spacecraft might have forty rooms, a storage room, and a shelter. The shelter protects astronauts from the Sun's ionizing radiation.\nLaunch and landing places.\nThe rocket might launch from Starbase, boats, or LC-39A. Starbase at Texas is where SpaceX makes and tests most Super Heavy and Starship. The launch boats are named \"Phobos\" and \"Deimos\" after the moons of Mars. They were oil platforms owned by Valaris.\nAll Starship launch and landing places will have a tower. It has a large crane placed on top that can lift Super Heavy and Starship. That tower also has a pair of steel arms that rotate at a hinge similar to claws. The claws can catch Super Heavy as well.\nSome people living near Starbase blamed SpaceX for harming wildlife, building and testing things without permission, and making too much noise. However, many people come to visit and stay there. When asked, they said that watching and imagining Starships sending humans to Mars made them love the place.\nRaptor rocket engine.\nBoth Super Heavy and Starship have SpaceX's Raptor rocket engines at the bottom. Each engine can make about of thrust. It has a full-flow staged combustion cycle design and burns liquid methane with liquid oxygen. These Raptor engines will be made in a new factory at McGregor.\nAlso at the bottom of the Starship spacecraft are the Raptor Vacuum engines. They are Raptor engines with larger nozzles. The Raptor Vacuum only works in space and is more efficient than the normal Raptor engine. The Raptor 2 engine is the next generation of the Raptor and Raptor Vacuum engines. They will be used in Super Heavy and Starship sometimes in the future. Both the Raptor Vacuum and Raptor 2 are going to be made in another factory at Hawthorne.\nThis is how a full-flow staged combustion cycle engine works. First, liquid methane and oxygen flow into the engine's turbopumps. The turbopumps increase the liquids' pressure. Then, the methane and oxygen evaporate into hot gases in two preburners. One preburner gets more methane, and another gets more oxygen. The gas then turns the turbines and turbopumps by a shaft. These spinning turbines and turbopumps pump more propellant to the engine. This hot and mixed gas is then burned in a combustion chamber. Finally, the engine nozzle directs the ignited gas to make thrust.\nMissions.\nPlanned.\nSpaceX wants Starship to replace the Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy, and Dragon 2. Musk guessed a Starship launch should cost $2 million (United States dollars) and the mission's propellant cost should be about $900,000. Starship could carry 400 Starlink satellites into orbit. A Falcon 9 can carry only 60 Starlink satellites.\nThe dearMoon project is planned for no earlier than 2023. Previously, in 2018, Japanese entrepreneur Yusaku Maezawa announced that private space mission. Its crew are Maezawa himself and eight other people. The plan is to use Starship as the main spacecraft. The spacecraft launch them toward the Moon, circle around it, and then return back to Earth.\nOn 16 April 2021, NASA selected Starship HLS as the Moon lander for the Artemis program. The other options were the Integrated Lander Vehicle by the National Team and Dynetics HLS by the Dynetics company. NASA then awarded SpaceX $2.89 billion to make Starship HLS. NASA wants Starship HLS to do a landing on the Moon without humans first. Then, Starship will send astronauts for the Artemis 3 mission.\nFailed protest about not getting a contract.\nTen days later, Blue Origin sent a protest to an United States government agency. Blue Origin blamed NASA for not allowing Blue Origin to compete. Blue Origin said NASA did not keep its promise. The original plan was that NASA would choose two Moon landers. On 30 July 2021, NASA denied Blue Origin's protest. NASA said they could only choose one lander because they did not have enough money. The government said NASA did not break the competition's rules.\nColonizing other planets.\nSpaceX wants to start Mars colonization and terraforming. It would do so by sending humans to Mars. Musk's life goal is to ensure that humans are still around after a mass extinction on Earth. He also talked about Starships going to Enceladus, Europa, Pluto, and the Oort cloud. The Starship rocket on those missions could launch from Mars.\nSpaceX thinks sending humans to Mars needs many steps. First, some Starships might carry many important things to Mars' surface. Inside them are fertilizer factories, propellant factories, and building materials. The propellant factory takes in carbon dioxide from Mars's air and hydrogen from the ice below. Then, the factory uses the Sabatier reaction. Hydrogen reacts with carbon dioxide with hydrogen to create methane and oxygen. Methane and oxygen are Starship's propellants. Filled up with the factory's methane and oxygen, Starship can return from Mars back to Earth. Building materials are used to make domes. They protect farmland from Mars's weather and atmosphere.\nMusk has guessed that a city with a million people on Mars is enough to keep itself running. It should be able to create everything that the people need. The city does not need shipments from Earth by then. He guessed that the city needs at least ten thousand Starships full of humans. Each Starship can carry 100 passengers on board. To give the colony enough equipment and food, a hundred thousand Starships carrying cargo might launch to Mars. This guess does not have population growth. \nHistory.\nEarly ideas.\nIn 2005, Elon Musk talked about a launch vehicle named BFR, later known as the Falcon XX. The Falcon XX was never built. Unlike Starship, it could only fly up once. Falcon XX was going to use Merlin 2 engine, a larger version of the Merlin engine. The engines burns kerosene and liquid oxygen.\nIn September 2016, at the 67th IAC (International Astronautical Congress), Elon Musk talked about the ITS (Interplanetary Transport System). It was going to be tall and wide. The booster was going to have 42 Raptors, and the spacecraft was going to have 9 Raptors. Both the booster and spacecraft are made from carbon composites, and could launch many times. The ITS can carry humans to Mars and other places inside the Solar System. When the spacecraft enters Mars's atmosphere, it cools by transpiration. Transpiration here means the spacecraft flows propellant to the front side and evaporates the heat.\nAt the next IAC in September 2017, Musk announced the Big Falcon Rocket. It is sometimes called Big Fucking Rocket. In that IAC, he talked about moving people around Earth quickly with a Big Falcon Rocket. He called it Earth to Earth.\nIn November 2018, Musk tweeted about a new spacecraft design. It had three bottom flaps and two top flaps. Around that time, the present names of Starship parts were first used:\nIn January 2019, Musk tweeted that Starship will be made from stainless steel instead of carbon composite. He explained that a stainless steel Starship is stronger than a carbon composite Starship. In March 2019, Musk tweeted again that Starships will have a heat shield made of tiles. The heat shield replaces transpiration cooling.\nHops.\nOn 27 August 2019, \"Starhopper\", the first vehicle to use the Raptor, flew high. In October 2019, Starship's design had three Raptors and three Raptor Vacuum engines. There are only two bottom flaps in the new design. They are close to the heat shield\u2019s edges. In September 2019, Starship Mk1 (Mark 1) was the first built Starship. The next vehicle, named Mk2, was built in Florida five months later. Mk1 failed [testing at cold temperature, or] the cryogenic proof test, while SpaceX recycled Mk2. Both of them did not fly.\nIn early 2020, SpaceX changed Mk3's name to SN1 (serial number 1). On 28 February 2020, SN1 crushed itself during a cryogenic proof test. It is because of a leak in the bottom tank. On 8 March 2020, SN2's tank completed its only cryogenic proof test. On 3 April 2020, during the SN3 cryogenic proof test, a valve leaked liquid nitrogen inside its bottom tank. This causes the vehicle to lose pressure and crush itself. On 29 May 2020, SN4 had its fifth successful static fire test. But, after the test, the connected propellant pipe made SN4 explode.\nOn 4 August 2020, SN5 completed a flight with one Raptor. The rocket went to before coming down. It is the first Starship to complete a flight intact. On 24 August 2020, SN6 repeated SN5's flight and did not explode. As of October 2021, the company is testing and experimenting with SN7\u2019s tanks.\nTest flights and other testing.\nSN8 was the first complete Starship. In October and November 2020, SN8 survived four static fire tests. The first, second, and fourth tests were successful, but the third test failed. In the third test, SN8's Raptors destroyed the mount. The concrete layer melted, splashed, and hit a Raptor.\nOn 9 December 2020, the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) warned SN8 could explode if it was flown as planned. SpaceX ignored its warnings. SN8 then flew up, making it the first Starship to fly. It goes as high as , then comes back down. While landing, SN8's methane header tank did not pump enough methane to the Raptors. This causes one engine to burn itself. So, SN8 hit the ground fast and exploded.\nOn 2 February 2021, SN9 flew high. During the landing, a Raptor does not work. So, SN9 lands at an angle and exploded as well. On 3 March 2021, SN10 repeated SN9's flight. It then landed with all Raptors working. But, because SN10 was damaged, it blew up eight minutes later. On 8 March 2021, the first Super Heavy booster named BN1 (booster number 1) was finished.\nOn 30 March 2021, SN11 exploded in dense fog. No one knows why it exploded. A possible explanation is that a Raptor burned SN11's computer. This could let too much propellant flow into the engine's turbopump. When the engine is lit, the pressure inside the chamber is too much, making SN11 explode.\nSpaceX then skipped SN12, SN13, SN14, and BN2. Their improvements were added to SN15 instead. On 5 May 2021, SN15 flew the same flight and landed. It did not explode after launch. On 20 July 2021, BN3 static fired for the only time. As of October 2021, SN15, SN16, and BN3 have not been used since.\nLaunches into space.\nAs of October 2021, SpaceX again skipped some Starship and Super Heavy. They are SN16, SN17, SN18, and SN19. Now, there are plans to launch SN20 and BN4 into space. On 22 October 2021, SN20 static fired one Raptor Vacuum.\nA plan by NASA to see Starship entering the atmosphere showed the launch could happen near March 2022. In SpaceX's plan, SN20 and BN4 will go above the Straits of Florida. BN4 is then going to separate about three minutes after. The booster then goes back into the Gulf of Mexico, about from the shore. SN20 then speeds up close to the orbital speed. It then splashes down ninety minutes later. It will be at about northwest of Kauai.\nThe FAA has not allowed SpaceX to launch SN20 and BN4 however. The company must finish a proposal about how Starship launches affect the area around it. Some experts said the proposal missed an important detail. It is how SpaceX gets a large volume of methane for Starship's propellant. A professor writes this might be illegal under United States' environmental acts from Congress.\nTimeline.\n\"Note: The start dates are when rocket stages were first seen, and the end dates are when they are destroyed or not used anymore.\""}

Nambudiris have been noted for their unique practices such as the adherence to srauta ritualism and orthodox tradition. Cyriac Pullapilly mentions that the dominating influence of the Nambudiris was to be found in all matters: religion, politics, society, economics and culture of Kerala.\nHistory.\nOrigin.\nNambudiri mythology associates their immigration to Kerala from the banks of Narmada, Krishna, Kaveri rivers with the legendary creation of Kerala by Parasurama, the 6th avatar of Vishnu. According to this legend, the region was created when Parasurama threw his axe into the sea Although it is known that the present-day region of Kerala was once governed by the Chera dynasty, little information exists regarding its early ethnography. \nBrahmin presence in the Tamil country is attested from the Sangam period onward. Based on the fact that Nambudiris are P\u016brva\u015bikh\u0101 Brahmins wearing the traditional hair tuft on the front, T.P Mahadevan proposes that they are the descendants of these Sangam age Brahmins who moved west into the region of Malabar during the Kalabhra interregnum. This sets them apart from the later Apara\u015bikh\u0101 Brahmin (wearing their hair tufts on the back) migrants to South India such as the Tamil Iyers. According to T.P Mahadevan, the Nambudiris brought with them a very early recension of the Mahabharata which became the basis of the Malayalam language version of the epic.\nAnthropologists Heike Moser and Paul Younger note that the Nambudiri Brahmin presence predates the 9th century, as attested by grants of land given to them by ruling families. According to the historian Romila Thapar, local kings and chiefs encouraged them to move to the area by offering such tax-exempt land grants in return for them officiating in Vedic rites that would legitimise the grantors' status as rulers. They also gained land and improved their influence over the socio-economic life of the region by helping rulers during the wars between the Chola and Chera dynasties when Vedic schools were turned into military academies.\nEarly history.\nOperating from their \"illam\" houses, Nambudiris' ownership of agricultural land under the janmi system increased over many centuries and, according to Moser and Younger, they \"established landholding temples and taught the people the rules of caste\". The Nambudiris have been described to be responsible for the Sanskrit influence on Malayalam, basically a Dravidian language, due to the Nambudiri Brahmin's mixing of Sanskrit and the local Tamil language.\nMedieval Kerala has been characterised as an oligarchy which was dominated by the Nambudiris, who owned all the temples and their subsidiary villages. The Nambudiris had influence with the ruling class through the practice of \"sambandam\", where younger Nambudiris used to have relationships with Kshatriya women or women from the upper sections of the Nair caste. The children of such unions were not considered Nambudiris, but a part of their matrilocal lineages. As a result of such unions, many kings and ruling chiefs in Kerala would be the offspring of Nambudiri fathers. These arrangements allowed the Nambudiris to gain political power in addition to religious and cultural dominance.\nThe Nambudiri's grip on land was maintained through the practice of strict primogeniture and patrilineal inheritance. Despite their younger members having hypergamous relationships with Nairs, whose caste traditions were matrilineal, Nambudiri families remained aloof from general society. Although the historian E. K. Pillai has claimed that the Nambudiris from the 1100s enforced matrilineal polyandry on the previously patrilineal communities of the area, sociologist Randall Collins thinks it is unlikely that such a change could be imposed and says that \"more probably it was the result of a process of marriage politics spread by emulation in the decentralised situation of status competition.\" Some other scholars believe that the matrilineal customs predate the period entirely and cite the queens of the Pandyan dynasty as evidence for this.\nModern history.\nThe unwillingness of Nambudiris to adapt to changes in wider society persisted until the early years of the 20th century but Susan Bayly believes that their decline in significance can be traced to the period 1729-1748 when Marthanda Varma established the Kingdom of Travancore and chose to use Deshastha Brahmins from Tamil Nadu in his civil service. She believes that decision undermined the relationship between the Nambudiri Brahmins and royalty in the region, although others have said that Varma's influence was short-lived and that the main cause of change was the arrival of British colonial administrators, such as Colin Macaulay and John Munro, from the early 1800s. After the passing of the Charter Acts of 1833 and 1853 in the British Parliament, the British encouraged the work of Christian missionaries, notably in provision of education, and began the introduction of a judicial system that would have a significant impact on the landholdings, inheritance customs and marriage arrangements of both the Nambudiris and Nairs. The traditional basis of life was challenged by these and other changes, affecting also the other major ethnic groups of the area, such as the Ezhavas and the Syrian Christians.\nEarly history.\nOperating from their \"illam\" houses, Nambudiris' ownership of agricultural land under the janmi system increased over many centuries and, according to Moser and Younger, they \"established landholding temples and taught the people the rules of caste\".

The traditional basis of life was challenged by these and other changes, affecting also the other major ethnic groups of the area, such as the Ezhavas and the Syrian Christians.\nReligious customs.\nVedic learning.\nThe following Vedic recensions are attested among them.\nAgnicayana.\nThe ancient Vedic ritual of Agnicayana (the altar of fire), which spans a 12-day period and which Frits Staal and Robert Gardner claim to be one of the oldest known rituals, was maintained by Nambudiri Brahmins until at least 1975. Although it may have largely died out elsewhere in India and thus be symptomatic of the community's resistance to change, David Knipe notes that it is still performed regularly in Andhra Pradesh and has been for centuries.\nAttire.\nTraditionally, they wore a simple cloth around the waist called a thorthu (or thortumundu), in domestic settings. When they had to travel, they wore two sets of cloth in addition known as a vasthram.\nNambudiris wore their traditional hair tufts (\"ku\u1e6dumi\" or \"\u015bikh\u0101\") on the front like the Dikshitars of Tamil Nadu.\nMarriage customs.\nNambudiri Brahmin families practised a more strict version of primogeniture than Brahmin communities elsewhere in India. Under this custom, only the eldest son could marry a Nambudiri woman and thus produce an heir to the family property. Younger sons were restricted to sambandam relationships with non-Brahmin women, whom the Nambudiris considered to be concubines and whose offspring could not inherit. This tradition limited the extent of marriage within their own caste and led to the practice of hypergamy with the Nair community. Kathleen Gough notes that:\nThe disparity in caste ranking in a relationship between a Brahmin man and a Nair woman meant that the woman was unable to live with her husband(s) in the Brahmin family and so remained in her own family. The children resulting from such marriages always became Nairs. K. M. Panikkar argues that it is this type of relationship that resulted in the matrilineal and matrilocal system. It has also been argued that the practice, along with judicious selection of the man who tied the \"thali\", formed a part of the Nair aspirational culture whereby they would seek to improve their status within the caste. Furthermore, that: \nAlthough it is certain that in theory hypergamy can cause a shortage of marriageable women in the lowest ranks of a caste and promote upwards social movement from the lower Nair subdivisions, the numbers involved would have been very small. It was not a common practice outside the higher subcaste groups and the Nambudiris had mostly stopped the practice by the 1920s.\nKoodiyattam (artform).\nThe form of Sanskrit theatre known as Koodiyattam, which is native to Kerala, was traditionally patronised by Nambudiris."}

{"id": "805248", "revid": "1061069", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=805248", "title": "Saint Thomas Christians", "text": "The Saint Thomas Christians are a very old community in Kerala, India also called as Syrian Christians of India, Nasrani or Malabar Nasrani or Malankara Nasrani or Nasrani Mappila, are an ethno-religious community of Indian Christians from the state of Kerala, who follow the East Syriac Rite, West Syriac Rite and the liturgical rites of Syriac Christianity. They trace their origins to the evangelistic or missionariy activity of Thomas the Apostle in the 1st century. Nasrani is an Arabic word for \"Christian\" that came from the Greek word Naz\u014draioi, Nazarene in English. The Saint Thomas Christians are now divided into different Churches like Eastern Catholic, Oriental Orthodox, Protestant, and independent bodies, each with their own liturgies and traditions. They are Malayali people and speak the Malayalam language\nSaint Thomas Christians are a community with different ethnicities or different origins.Their culture is largely from East Syriac, West Syriac, Hindu, Jewish, and Latin Rite influences, blended with local customs and later elements derived from indigenous Indian and European colonial contacts. Their language is Malayalam, the language of Kerala, and Syriac is used for prayers.\nThe Saint Thomas Christians have also been nicknamed such due to their reverence for Saint Thomas the Apostle, who is said to have brought Christianity to India. The name dates back to the period of Portuguese colonisation. They are also known, especially locally, as Nasrani or Nasrani Mappila. The former means Christian; it appears to have been derived from the Hebrew word Netzer or the Aramaic Nasraya from Isaiah 11:1. Mappila is an honorific applied to members of non-Indian faiths and descendants of immigrants from the middle east who had intermarried with the local population, including Muslims (Jonaka Mappila) and Jews (Yuda Mappila). Some Syrian Christians of Travancore continue to attach this honorific title to their names. The Government of India designates members of the community as Syrian Christians, a term originating with the Dutch colonial authority that distinguishes the Saint Thomas Christians, who used Syriac (within East Syriac Rite or West Syriac Rite) as their liturgical language, from newly evangelised Christians who followed the Roman Rite.The terms Syrian or Syriac relate not to their ethnicity but to their historical, religious and liturgical connection to the Church of the East, or East Syriac Church.\nHistory\nAccording to tradition, Thomas the Apostle came to Muziris on the Kerala coast in AD 52 and converted many Nambudiri Brahmins to christianity and established the Ezharapallikal. The most prominent families amongst the many are Pakalomattam, Sankarapuri, Kalli, Kalliyankal, Nedumpally, Kunnappilly, Payyippilly, Vazhappilly, Maliekkal, Panakkamattom and Thayil.\nThe Cochin Jews are known to have existed in Kerala in the 1st century AD, and it was possible for an Aramaic-speaking Jew, such as St. Thomas from Galilee, to make a trip to Kerala then.The earliest known source connecting the Apostle to India is the Acts of Thomas, likely written in the early 3rd century, perhaps in Edessa.\nA number of 3rd and 4th century Roman writers also mention Thomas' trip to India, including Ambrose of Milan, Gregory of Nazianzus, Jerome, and Ephrem the Syrian, while Eusebius of Caesarea records that St. Clement of Alexandria's teacher Pantaenus from Alexandria visited a Christian community in India using the Gospel of Matthew in Hebrew language in the 2nd century.\ufffc\nThe tradition of origin of the Christians in Kerala is found in a version of the Songs of Thomas or Thomma Parvam, written in 1601 and believed to be a summary of a larger and older work.Thomas is described as arriving in or around Maliankara and founding Seven Churches, or Ezharapallikal: Kodungallur, Kollam, Niranam, Nilackal (Chayal), Gokkamangalam, Kottakkavu , Palayoor and Thiruvithamcode Arappally (a \"half church\"). The Thomma Parvam also narrates the conversion of Jews, natives, and the local King at Kodungallur by St Thomas. The Thomma Parvam further narrates St Thomas's mission in the rest of South India and his martyrdom at Mylapore in present-day Chennai, Tamil Nadu.\ufffc\nThere is evidence that members of the St Thomas Christian community observed Brahmin customs in the Middle Ages, such as the wearing of the sacred thread and having a kudumi. The medieval historian Pius Malekandathil believes these were customs adopted and privileges won during the beginning of the Brahmin dominance of medieval Kerala. He argues that the Syrian Christians in Kerala, integrated with Persian Christian migrant merchants, in the 9th century to become a powerful trading community and were granted the privileges by the local rulers to promote revenue generation and to undermine Buddhist and Jain traders who rivaled the Brahmins for religious and political hegemony in Kerala at the time."}

{"id": "805302", "revid": "1011873", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=805302", "title": "Knanaya", "text": "The Kn\u0101n\u0101ya, (from Syriac: \"Kn\u0101'n\u0101ya\" (Canaanite)) also known as the Southists or Tekkumbhagar, are an endogamous ethnic group found among the Saint Thomas Christian community of Kerala, India. They are differentiated from another part of the community, known in this context as the Northists (\"Vaddakkumbhagar\"). There are about 300,000 Knanaya in India and elsewhere.\nThe origins of the division of the Saint Thomas Christians into Northist and Southist groups is traced back to the arrival of the Syrian merchant Thomas of Cana (Kn\u0101i Thoma) who led a migration of Syriac Christians (Jewish-Christians) from Mesopotamia to India in the 4th or 8th century. The Knanaya claim descent from Thomas of Cana and those who came with him. The communities arrival was recorded on the \"Thomas of Cana copper plates \" which existed in Kerala until the 17th century after which point they were taken to Portugal by the Franciscan Order. The ethnic division between the Knanaya and other St. Thomas Christians was observed during the Portuguese colonization of India in the 16th century and was noted throughout the European colonial era.\nToday, the majority of Knanaya are members of the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church (Kottayam Archeparchy) and the Jacobite Syrian Orthodox Church (Knanaya Archdiocese). They became increasingly prominent in Kerala in the late 19th century. Many Knanaya migrated away during the 20th and 21st centuries, largely westward, forming communities in non-Malayalam speaking areas, with a large expatriate community currently living in Houston, Texas and Chicago, Illinois in the United States.\nOrigins and traditions.\nThe earliest extensive written evidence for the division of the Christian community of India dates to the 16th century. The St. Thomas Christian tradition defines the division as being both geographical and ethnic, expressing that the Native St. Thomas Christians initially resided on the north side of the Chera Empire's capitol city of Cranganore while the Middle Eastern migrant Knanaya arrived and settled on the south side, which subsequently led to the designations Northist and Southist. Celebrated St. Thomas Christian scholar Dr. Placid J. Podipara wrote the following about the division:\n\"The Thomas Christians hail the Apostle St. Thomas as the founder of their Church...The first converts of St. Thomas were reinforced by local conversions and by Christian colonizations (migrations) from abroad. Connected with the IV century colonization is the origin of those called the \"Southists\"\"\nDirectional divisions within communities are common in Kerala, including among Hindu groups. A similar north\u2013south division is found among the Nairs, and it historically appears to have been in place in the early Brahmin settlements in the area. The Saint Thomas Christians may have taken this trait from the Brahmins. \nThomas of Cana's Arrival.\nThe historical rationale for the division between the majority St. Thomas Christians and minority Knanaya traces the divide to the figure of Thomas of Cana, a Syrian merchant who led a group of 72 Jewish-Christian immigrant families, a bishop named Uraha Mar Yausef, and clergymen from Mesopotamia to settle in Cranganore, India in the 4th century (some sources place these events as late as the 9th century). This may reflect a historical migration of East Syrian Christians to India around this time, which established the region's relationship with the Church of the East.In the commonly accepted accounts of this history, the Knanaya are the descendants of Thomas of Cana and his followers, while the Northists descend from the local Christian body which had been converted by Thomas the Apostle centuries earlier. The \"Oxford History of the Christian Church\" states the following about the division: \n\"In time, Jewish Christians of the most exclusive communities descended from settlers who accompanied Knayil Thomma (Kanayi) became known as \u2018Southists\u2019 (Tekkumbha \u0304gar)...They distinguished between themselves and \u2018Northists\u2019 (Vatakkumbha \u0304gar). The \u2018Northists\u2019, on the other hand, claimed direct descent from the very oldest Christians of the country, those who had been won to Christ by the Apostle Thomas himself. They had already long inhabited northern parts of Kodungallur. They had been there even before various waves of newcomers had arrived from the Babylonian or Mesopotamian provinces of Sassanian Persia.\"\nElements of Thomas of Cana's arrival feature in ancient songs as well as the Thomas of Cana copper plates awarded to his followers by a local Hindu ruler. These plates granted Thomas' followers 72 social, economic, and religious rights from Cheraman Perumal, the Chera king. The plates were present in Kerala during the time of the Portuguese colonization in the early 17th century, but were lost during Portuguese rule. Archbishop Francis Ros notes in his 1604 account \"M.S. ADD 9853\" that the plates were taken to Portugal by the Franciscan Order. The Knanaya invoke the plates as evidence of their descent from Thomas of Cana's mission. \nTranslations of the existing Kollam Syrian Plates of the 9th century made by the Syrian Christian priest Ittimani in 1601 as well as the French Indologist Abraham Anquetil Duperron in 1758 both note that the forth plate mentioned a brief of the arrival of Knai Thoma.It is believed that this was a notation of the previous rights bestowed upon the Christians by Cheraman Perumal. The contemporary forth plate however does not mention this paragraph and is believed to be a later copy. Scholar of Early Christian history Istavan Percvel theorizes that at one time the Kollam Syrian plates and the Thomas of Cana plates were kept together.\nJewish-Christian Ancestry.\nKnanaya tradition claims that the Syriac Christian migrants who arrived with Thomas of Cana were Jewish-Christians. Community scholars express the historicity of this tradition by noting that Jewish-Christian tribes in Mesopotamia were a major component of the early Church of the East. Additionally, scholars express that both Jewish and Christian merchants of the region took part in the Arabian Sea trade with Kerala.\nThe community also cites their culture as evidence of their Jewish-Christian heritage, particularly their folk songs first written on palm-leave manuscripts in the 17th century. Many of the historical songs allude to the migrants being of Jewish descent such as the song \"Nallor Orosilam\" (The Good Jerusalem) which states the migrants prayed at the tomb of the Jewish Prophet Ezra before departing to India. A number of Jewish scholars such as Dr. P.M. Jussay, Dr. Nathan Katz, Dr. Shalva Weil, and Dr. Ophira Gamliel have noted that the Knanaya maintain cultural similarities to the Cochin Jews of India,suggesting historic cultural relations between the two communities. \nIn 1939, the Knanaya politician and author Joseph Chazhikaden published a book on the community, \"Tekkumbhagasamudayam Charitram\", in which he included some aspects of the communities Jewish claim. Chazhikaden built upon the Thomas of Cana tradition but asserted that Thomas' followers originated in Judea. According to Chazhikaden, the group converted to Christianity while maintaining their distinct culture and identity. Eventually, they were forced out of their homeland and moved to Cranganore, where they were welcomed by the ruler Cheraman Perumal and lived near, but maintained their separateness from, the indigenous \"Northist\" Saint Thomas Christians. Many modern Knanaya accept the account as factual, while others reject it. As with other Knanaya origin traditions, some Northists dispute and condemn it.\nTwo Wives Legend.\nIn many other variants recorded during the colonial era, Thomas of Cana had two wives or partners, one of them being the ancestor of the endogamous Southists, and the other one being the ancestor of the Northist. A number of traditions and stories have emerged to explain the status of either wife, and both Southists and Northists historically used variants of these traditions to claim superiority for their group.\nThese variants are considered apocryphal and are not the accepted tradition among contemporary Northist and Southist scholars who generally believe them to be the consequence of rivalry between the St. Thomas Christians and Knanaya. In most of these variants, the Southists' ancestor was Thomas' Syrian wife, while the Northists' was an indigenous St. Thomas Christian or Nair woman who became his second wife or concubine, implying that the Southists are Thomas' true heirs. In other variants, both wives were Kerala natives, while the Southists' forebearer was from a higher caste. \nSome Northist historically maintained versions which countered this assertion, claiming that the Knanaya descend from a \"dobi\" (washerwoman); in some versions of this story, she became Thoma's concubine, while in others she married a lower-caste Maaran boy. This assertion is based on the 1676 Portuguese document \"M.S Sloane 2748-A\", a likely forgery attributed to the Carmelite priest Father Mathew.\nHistorian of medieval India and Northist priest Pius Malekandathil argues that the two-wives legend was simply a creation of rivalry between the Middle Eastern migrant Knanaya and the Native St. Thomas Christians. Malekandathil expresses that the story originated in the medieval era due to the two ethnic groups of Christians asserting socioeconomic dominance over the other. Furthermore, Malekandathil notes that the two-wives legend is not the accepted tradition among the people of Kerala but instead that the indigenous Saint Thomas Christians got the appellation \"Northists\" because they were initially located on the northern part of the city of Cranganore, while the migrant Knanaya under the leadership of Thomas of Cana were given the southern side of the city which led to the generic title of \"Southists\"."}

{"id": "805452", "revid": "7202476", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=805452", "title": "Digital distribution", "text": "Digital distribution is the delivery (through downloading) of any digital content, including audio, e-books, games, PDFs, pictures, software, and video. Digital distribution is handled through a digital distribution platform that's designed to stream the digital content or allow the content to be downloaded in full. \nAlso referred to as content delivery, online distribution, or electronic software distribution (ESD), among others, is the delivery or distribution of digital media content such as audio, video, e-books, video games, and other software.\nA primary characteristic of online distribution is its direct nature. To make a commercially successful work, artists usually must enter their industry's publishing chain. Publishers help artists advertise, fund and distribute their work to retail outlets. In some industries, particularly video games, artists find themselves bound to publishers, and in many cases unable to make the content they want; the publisher might not think it will profit well. This can quickly lead to the standardization of the content and to the stifling of new, potentially risky ideas.\nBy opting for online distribution, an artist can get their work into the public sphere of interest easily with potentially minimum business overhead. This often leads to cheaper goods for the consumer, increased profits for the artists, as well as increased artistic freedom. Online distribution platforms often contain or act as a form of digital rights management.\nOnline distribution also opens the door to new business models (e.g., the Open Music Model). For instance, an artist could release one track from an album or one chapter from a book at a time instead of waiting for them all to be completed. This either gives them a cash boost to help continue their projects or indicates that their work might not be financially viable. This is hopefully done before they have spent excessive money and time on a project deemed to remain unprofitable. Video games have increased flexibility in this area, demonstrated by micropayment models. A clear result of these new models is their accessibility to smaller artists or artist teams who do not have the time, funds, or expertise to make a new product in one go.\nAn example of this can be found in the music industry. Indie artists may access the same distribution channels as major record labels, with potentially fewer restrictions and manufacturing costs. There is a growing collection of 'Internet labels' that offer distribution to unsigned or independent artists directly to online music stores, and in some cases marketing and promotion services. Further, many bands are able to bypass this completely, and offer their music for sale via their own independently controlled websites.\nAn issue is the large number of incompatible formats in which content is delivered, restricting the devices that may be used, or making data conversion necessary."}

It is the sixth-farthest known Solar System object. Gonggong was discovered in July 2007 by American astronomers Megan Schwamb, Michael Brown, and David Rabinowitz at the Palomar Observatory, and the discovery was announced in January 2009.\nPhysical characteristics.\nThe surface of Gonggong has an albedo of 0.14. Gonggong is among the reddest trans-Neptunian objects known. Its red color is suprising because it has a lot of water ice on its surface, which are usually neutral in color. Scientists think that there might be methane on its surface which will explain its red color.\nGonggong is estimated to have a diameter of 1,230 km (760 mi). This would make Gonggong the fifth-largest trans-Neptunian object, after Pluto, Eris, Haumea and Makemake. Gonggong is approximately the size of Pluto's moon Charon.\nThe mass of Gonggong has been calculated to be 1.75\u00d71021 kg (3.86\u00d71021 lb).

It is the sixth-farthest known Solar System object from the Sun.\nExploration.\nIt was calculated by planetary scientist Amanda Zangari that a flyby mission to Gonggong would take a minimum of over 20 years with the rocket we have today. A flyby mission would be launched on 2030 or 2031.\nMoons.\nGonggong is known to have a moon, called Xiangliu. The discovery team thought that the slow rotation of Gonggong was caused by a moon"}

In North Korea, it is against the law to leave North Korea without permission. North Koreans are also not allowed to change their own citizenship, so anyone born a North Korean must also die a North Korean. The punishment for leaving North Korea without permission is extremely harsh. People who are caught are usually sent a prison camp or put to death in public. Like many other crimes in North Korea, illegally leaving the country may not only punish the accused, but also his or her family up to three generations.\nAlthough the punishments for illegally leaving North Korea are extremely harsh, the number who try to leave the country is still somewhat high. This is because North Koreans are so poor and have so little freedom that defectors believe finding a better life in a new country is worth risking their lives for it. Since the North Korean famine in the 1990s, more than 30,000 North Koreans have successfully left and have come to South Korea. Some sources say that somewhere between 100,000 to 300,000 North Koreans escaped into Russia or China since 1953. Of the defectors who came to South Korea, more than 70% are women. \nThe goal of most defectors is to get to South Korea because the South Korean constitution allows South Korean citizenship to anyone born in either North or South Korea. However, the way to get to South Korea is so difficult that most defectors never made it there. There are many different ways to get to South Korea, and all are difficult. However, some are more difficult than others.\nOne possible way is to cross the North-South Korea border through the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). However, most defectors do not take this route because it is extremely deadly. The DMZ has many landmines, tanks, electric wires, machine gun towers, and guards on both sides. In fact, North Korean soldiers have orders to kill any North Korean trying to cross the border. In some cases, South Korean soldiers have actually rescued some North Koreans crossing the border. Only 21 of the 33,000 defectors have crossed the DMZ and lived through it. Almost all of these were North Korean soldiers who had some knowledge of the DMZ.\nThere were at least two defectors who successfully swam to Japan.\nHowever, most defectors begin their escape through China. This is because the Tumen and Yalu Rivers (the rivers that make up the China-North Korea border) are much easier and safer to cross. However, most defectors do not stay in China because they are still in danger. Most defectors caught by the China government are either sent back to North Korea, where they would most likely be killed, or be sold as a wife or a sex slave in China. This is why most North Korean defectors try to go into second country before finally coming to South Korea. These countries include Mongolia, Russia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand.\nThere is also a sizeable community of North Korean defectors in the United States (mostly people who who fled to South Korea during the Korean War and later emigrated to the USA). Since the North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004 which allowed North Korean defectors to be admitted as refugees, about 130 people have settled in the U.S. under such status."}

It still towers over the necropolis. The pyramid is also significant because its evacuation led to the discovery of the Abusir Papyri.\nThe Fifth Dynasty marked the end of the great pyramid constructions during the Old Kingdom.\nPyramids of the era were smaller and became more standardized. There was still intricate relief decoration. Neferirkare's pyramid deviated from convention as it was originally built as a step pyramid. That design that had gone out of date after the Third Dynasty (26th or 27th century BC). \nThe pharaoh's death left the work to be completed by his successors. The remaining works were completed in haste, using cheaper building material. Because of the haste, Neferirkare's monument lacked several basic elements of a pyramid complex: a valley temple, a causeway, and a cult pyramid. \nThe monuments to Neferirkare's consort, Khentkaus\u00a0II; and his sons, Neferefre and Nyuserre Ini, are in the surrounds."}

It is a possible dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt. It was discovered in 2002 by Chad Trujillo and Michael Brown.\nThe Spitzer Space Telescope estimated it to have a diameter of 726\u00b1123 km, while the Herschel Space Telescope estimated it to be 934\u00b147 km.\n2002 MS4 does not have any known moons orbiting it, thus an accurate mass estimate cannot be made. Based on its size, Brown lists it as nearly certain to be a dwarf planet, however, its low albedo may imply the opposite: dark, mid-sized bodies such as this, less than about 1000 km in diameter and with albedos less than about 0.2, have likely never collapsed into solid bodies, much less differentiated or relaxed into hydrostatic equilibrium, and thus are unlikely to be dwarf planets.\nAs of 2019, the rotation period of 2002 MS4 is unknown. Observations in 2005 and 2011 showed possible periods of either 7.33 hours or its alias 10.44 hours (single-peaked), or twice those values for the double-peaked solution, with a small light curve amplitude of 0.05\u00b10.01 mag. Light curve observations of 2002 MS4 are difficult because of the dense field of background stars it is crossing. Observations made in June and July 2011 took advantage of 2002 MS4 moving in front of a dark nebula."}
