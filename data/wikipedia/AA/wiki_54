The season started on June 1, 2009 and it ended on November 30, 2009. In this season Tropical Depression One formed early, on May 28. In June and July there were no storms. The most recent occurrence of no storms in June or July was in 1992. In total there were 2 tropical depressions, 7 tropical storms, 3 hurricanes, and two of the three were major hurricanes.\nStorms.\nTropical Depression One.\nOn May 28, a small storm formed off the coast of North Carolina and became a tropical depression, called \"One\" by the National Hurricane Center. The National Hurricane Center said that Tropical Depression One might strengthen into a tropical storm, but it did not because the water was cold and did not give enough energy to the storm. It weakened and stopped being a depression the next day.\nTropical Storm Ana.\nTropical Depression Two formed on August 11 south of Cape Verde. The system moved west and dissipated on August 13. On August 15 the remains of Tropical Depression Two reformed. Tropical Depression Two quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Ana. The storm continued west towards the Leeward Islands. A few days later as the storm was still headed for the Leeward Islands it weakened to a tropical depression. Ana struck Dominica on August 16 and dissipated the next day.\nHurricane Bill.\nOn August 15, Tropical Depression Three formed and quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Bill. On August 17 Tropical Storm Bill became Hurricane Bill. On August 18 Hurricane Bill became a major hurricane (Category 3+). Hurricane Bill quickly strengthened into a category 4 hurricane on August 19, but weakened back on to a category 3 on August 20. Hurricane Bill weakened to a category 2 on August 21, it again weakened the next day to a category 1 hurricane. As a category one hurricane Bill came close to a landfall in Nova Scotia. Near midnight (Eastern Time Zone) on August 23, Bill made landfall in Newfoundland and became extratropical the next day. The remains affected United Kingdom.\nTropical Storm Claudette.\nTropical Storm Claudette formed in the Gulf of Mexico as Tropical Depression Four early on August 16. At 12:15\u00a0p.m. EDT the same day, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Claudette. Early the next morning Claudette struck Santa Rosa Island, Florida. Tropical Storm Claudette weakened and dissipated on August 18.\nTropical Storm Danny.\nTropical Storm Danny formed north of Puerto Rico on August 26. Danny top winds were at 60\u00a0mph. Danny did not become a hurricane. Danny instead, moved toward North Carolina as a weak tropical storm. On August 29 Danny weaken into a depression and lost it clouds to an extratropical storm. Danny did not reach North Carolina before losing its cloud. Danny killed a boy in North Carolina due to rip currents.\nTropical Storm Erika.\nTropical Storm Erika formed on September 1 as Tropical Storm Erika, meaning it was never a tropical depression. Tropical Storm Erika moved mostly west for most of the lifespan of it. On September 2 Tropical Storm Erika made landfall in Guadeloupe. Tropical Storm Erika weaken to a tropical depression and a remnant low on September 3. The remnant low caused some rain to some of the northern islands of the Caribbean Sea.\nHurricane Fred.\nTropical Depression Seven formed on September 7 south of the Cape Verde Islands. Later on September 7 it became a tropical storm and was named Fred. Early the next day, Tropical Storm Fred became Hurricane Fred, the second hurricane of the season. Hurricane Fred became a major hurricane (Cat 3+). Fred slowly weakened after becoming a category 3 hurricane. On September 12 while a tropical storm, Fred became a remnant low and is no longer a tropical storm.\nTropical Depression Eight.\nTropical Depression Eight formed near Cape Verde on September 25. Tropical Depression Eight was said that it would become a tropical storm, this did not happen. Tropical Depression Eight instead became a tropical wave on September 26. It is no longer a tropical depression.\nTropical Storm Grace.\nTropical Storm Grace became a tropical storm late on October 4, it was also never a tropical depression while it was forming. Tropical Storm Grace moved towards Ireland, but went into a frontal system on October 5, Grace was not a tropical storm anymore. The remains affect Ireland and the United Kingdom.\nTropical Storm Henri.\nTropical Storm Henri was a weak storm that stayed out in the ocean for most of its life. It formed from a tropical wave on October 6 while moving northwest across the Atlantic. On the next day, wind shear around the storm caused it to weaken into a remnant low. Its remains were last seen near Cuba. The storm did not come close to any land and did not cause any damage to property.\nHurricane Ida.\nOn November 4, Tropical Depression Eleven started in the Caribbean Sea. Later that same day it became a tropical storm and was given the name \"Ida\". Ida became a hurricane just before landfall on November 5. Ida weakened fast over land and was a depression before the end of the day. On November 6, Ida came back into the Caribbean Sea just north of Honduras. Ida became a tropical storm again on November 7. Ida later on became a hurricane again and weakened back to a tropical storm on November 9. Ida made landfall in Alabama on November 10. The storm died only about 4 hours later. The remains of Ida became a nor'easter that killed 9 people. Hurricane Ida also caused about $5.6 million in damage.\nStorm names.\nThe following names will be used for named storms that form in the North Atlantic in 2009. This is the same list that was used in the 2003 season, except for \"Fred\", \"Ida\", and \"Joaquin\". In 2003 those three names were Fabian, Isabel, and Juan, because they were bad storms in 2003, their names were retired from the list of names."}
{"id": "161520", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=161520", "title": "Tropical Depression Seven (2003)", "text": "Tropical Depression Seven was a weak tropical depression that formed near the northeast Florida coast. It was the seventh tropical cyclone of the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season. The depression formed on July 25 from the same tropical wave that created another weather system. It was a small and disorganized depression, and it never became a tropical storm, which is stronger than a tropical depression. The depression moved onto land at St. Catherines Island, Georgia, and it quickly weakened. Because the storm was weak, the effects were limited to heavy rain in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.\nStorm history.\nA tropical wave, which had also created Tropical Depression Six, combined itself with an upper-level low pressure area to create an area of deep convection near Hispaniola on July 23, 2003. A mid- to lower-level circulation started to form inside the storm as it moved mostly in a north-northwest direction. According to surface and satellite observations, it is thought that the system became Tropical Depression Seven at 1200\u00a0UTC on July 25 about 60\u00a0miles (95\u00a0km) east of Daytona Beach, Florida. The system was caught in an environment characterized by high surface pressures.\nAt first, the depression moved west-northwest at about 13 mph (20 km/h), and most of the convection from the storm was separated from the center. However, the cloud pattern became organized, and was made up of a number of curved banding features. The storm continued to move northwestward for its whole life, from the steering currents of a subtropical ridge and an approaching mid-level trough.\nMoving through an area of cool water temperatures, as well as unfavorable upper-level winds, the depression was not able to get winds greater than 35\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h), and as a result did not gain tropical storm status. Before landfall, the highest winds were measured to exist in a small area northeast of the center of circulation, where a well-defined group of clouds persisted. Early on July 26, it moved onto land on St. Catherines Island, Georgia, and after slowly weakening over land, it died out on July 27.\nImpact.\nThe depression was never predicted to become tropical storm status. Because of this, no tropical storm warnings or watches were issued. However, flood watches were issued for part of Georgia and South Carolina. At Georgetown County, South Carolina, officials watched the storm closely. \nThe depression dropped light to moderate rain from Florida to the coast of North Carolina. The highest rain was 5.17\u00a0inches (131\u00a0mm) in Savannah, Georgia. Other rainfall totals of 2 to 3 in (50 to 75 mm) were common. There were no damages or casualties because of this depression."}

The water molecules completely surround the methane. Methane hydrate is a common constituent of the shallow marine (ocean) geosphere. In 1971, it was first discovered in Black Sea.\nDefinition and Characteristics.\nMethane hydrate consists of methane gas trapped inside cage-like crystal structures made up of water molecules. These \u201ccages\u201d have a size of atoms and molecules, far too small to see with the naked eye. Under normal temperature and pressure, one litre of methane hydrate is equal to 168 litres of methane gas.\nOrigin of methane hydrate.\nMethane hydrate is thought to be formed by dead organic matter trapped between the earth's layers, and then broken down by microorganisms and the earth's heat. The process is similar to the one that produces methane when organic waste is dumped at a garbage pit and covered with earth, except that it occurs deep below the earth's surface. The organisms which produce methane by a process of fermentation are the methaneogen Archea.\nNatural resources.\nAreas where natural methane hydrate is thought to exist are generally areas under the ocean where continental plates meet. In depths between 500 to 1000 meter, where pressure is high and temperature low enough."}

He was member of the Academy of Esperanto and honorary member of the Universal Association of Esperanto (UEA). He wrote books in Esperanto. He came from a Jewish family.\nEarly life.\nSekelj was born in Spi\u0161sk\u00e1 Sobota, which was then in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It is now called Poprad, in Slovakia. His father was a veterinarian (animal doctor), and the family moved around extensively. They moved to Cheney, now in Romania. In 1922 they moved to Kikinda, Serbia. He went to elementary school in Kikinda. The family moved to Nik\u0161i\u0107, in Montenegro where he finished high school. He went to Zagreb where he studied in law at university.\nWorking life.\nDisinterested in practicing law, he began working as a journalist in Zagreb. In 1939 he went to Argentina to write about former Croates who had left Yugoslavia to settle in South America. He stayed there for the next 15 years as a journalist and explorer. In 1944 he was part of a trekking party that climbed to the top of highest mountain in the western hemisphere Aconcagua , near Argentina. He used this experience to write a novel (story) in Spanish about Aconcagua, which became a best seller there. In 1946 he undertook the first of two expeditions into the Amazon jungle, the first of which produced a popular book, (Por Tierra De Indios). His companion from that expedition, Mary Reznik\u2014whom he later married\u2014was the first white woman to have penetrated that deeply into the Brazilian jungle. Together they returned to the Amazon in 1948, after which he penned \"Where Civilization Ends\" (Donde La Civilizacion Termina). The marriage produced a son, Diego. In 1954 Sekelj returned to Yugoslavia and settled in Belgrade, although he still traveled extensively. In 1962 he traveled through Africa. He married Erzsebet Sekelj, a young woman he met on a trip through Hungary. From 1972 he lived in Subotica (Vojvodina), now in Serbia. He was in charge of a museum in Subotica. He died in Subotica, and is buried there.\nOther cultures.\nDuring his travels in South America, Africa, Asia, Oceania, Sekelj collected many important items from other cultures. He gave these to the Ethnographic Museum of Zagreb.\nHis main book on other cultures is \" Tirez the arrow: oral poetry of the world \", Rotterdam: UEA, 1983, 187 pages, . He translated into Esperanto, the poetry he had collected during his travels.\nDictionary.\nSekelj worked with many other writers on a dictionary of museums, called the \"Dictionarium Museologicum\", 1986."}

It is weft-faced weaving. This means all the warp threads (the ones that go up and down) are hidden in the completed work. In normal cloth weaving both the warp and the weft threads can be seen. \nIn this way, a colourful pattern or image is made. Most weavers use a natural warp thread such as linen or cotton. The weft threads, which will be seen, are usually wool or cotton. They can also be made of silk, gold, silver, or other things.\nBoth craftsmen and artists have made tapestries. The 'blueprints' on cardboard (also known as 'tapestry cartoons') were made by artists, while actual weaving of the tapestries was done by craftsmen.\nFunction.\nThe success of decorative tapestry can be partially explained by its portability (Le Corbusier once called tapestries \"nomadic murals\"). Kings and noblemen could roll up and transport tapestries from one residence to another. In churches, they were displayed on special occasions. Tapestries were also draped on the walls of castles for insulation during winter, as well as for decorative display.\nThe famous Bayeux tapestry is not actually a tapestry, but a decorated cloth.

He played for the Japan national team.\nBiography.\nTakagi was born in Minamishimabara on November 12, 1967. After graduating from Osaka University of Commerce, he joined Japan Soccer League Division 2 club Fujita Industries in 1990. In 1991, he moved to Division 1 club Mazda (later \"Sanfrecce Hiroshima\"). In 1992, Japan Soccer League was folded and the club joined new league, J1 League. The club won the 2nd place in the 1994 J1 League and he was selected Best Eleven. The club also won the 1995 and 1996 Emperor's Cup. He played 173 matches and scored 62 goals for the club. In 1998, he moved to Verdy Kawasaki. In 2000, he moved to J2 League club Consadole Sapporo. The club won the champions in 2000 and was promoted to J1 from 2001. However he retired end of the 2000 season.\nOn May 31, 1992, Takagi debuted for the Japan national team against Argentina. In 1992, he was selected the Japan for 1992 Asian Cup which held in Japan and Japan team won the champions. He played 5 matches and scored a winning goal against Saudi Arabia at the final. In 1993, he played at 1994 World Cup qualification in Doha. However Japan failed to qualify for the 1994 World Cup. It was known as the \"Agony of Doha\" () in Japan. He also played at 1994 Asian Games and 1996 Asian Cup. He played 44 games and scored 27 goals for Japan until 1997.\nIn 2006, Takagi became an assistant coach under the manager Yusuke Adachi at J2 League club Yokohama FC. In March, Adachi was sacked for poor performance and Takagi became a new manager. The club won the champions in 2006 and was promoted to J1 League from 2007. However the club results were bad in J1 and he was sacked in August. In 2008, he became an assistant coach under the manager Tetsuji Hashiratani at J1 club Tokyo Verdy. The club was relegated to J2 end of 2008 season and Takagi became a new manager as Hashiratani successor from 2009. However Takagu was sacked in October. In 2010, he signed with J2 club Roasso Kumamoto and managed the club until 2012. In 2013, he moved to his local club V-Varen Nagasaki which was promoted to J2 from 2013. The club won the 2nd place in 2017 and was promoted to J1 from 2018. However the club finished at the bottom place in 2018 and was relegated to J2 in a year. He also resigned end of 2018 season. In 2019, he signed with J2 club Omiya Ardija and managed the club until 2020.\nStatistics.\n245||76||20||8||20||6||285||90\n245||76||20||8||20||6||285||90\n!Total||44||27"}

{"id": "161772", "revid": "1025654", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=161772", "title": "Peppered moth evolution", "text": "The evolution of the peppered moth has been studied in detail over the last 150 years. At first, almost all of the moths were light coloured. This gave them camouflage against the light-coloured trees and lichens where they rested during the day. As pollution increased during the Industrial Revolution in England, many of the lichens died out. The trees became blackened by soot, and most of the light-coloured moths, or typica, became rare. At the same time, the dark-coloured, or \"melanic\", moths, carbonaria, flourished. This change took place because the best camouflaged moths survived better. The term industrial melanism refers to the genetic darkening of species in response to pollutants. \nSince then, with an improved environment, light-coloured peppered moths have again become common. As a result of the relatively simple and easy-to-understand circumstances of the adaptation, the peppered moth has become a common example used in explaining or demonstrating natural selection.\nRise and fall of melanism.\nMelanism has appeared in the European and North American peppered moth populations. Information about the initial rise in melanic frequency is scarce. Much more is known about the subsequent fall in phenotype frequency, because it was measured with moth traps.\nA black peppered moth was found in 1811, a rareity, no doubt caused by a gene mutation. By 1864 the darker 'carbonaria' form was the more common morph in Manchester. By 1895, it reached a frequency of 98% in Manchester.\nFrom around 1962 to the present, the phenotype frequency of \"carbonaria\" has steadily fallen. Its decline has been measured more accurately than its rise, because of better scientific studies. Bernard Kettlewell conducted a national survey in 1956, Bruce Grant conducted a similar one in early 1996, and L.M. Cook in 2003.\nSimilar results were found in America. Melanic forms have not been found in Japan. This may be because peppered moths in Japan do not live in industrialised regions.\nPredation experiments.\nIn 1896 J.W. Tutt suggested that the increased proportion of \"carbonaria\" was caused by differential bird predation. This meant birds took more light-coloured moths in dark areas, and more dark-coloured moths in light areas. Various experiments have been performed on predation of the peppered moth, and each has supported this hypothesis.\nThe most famous experiments on the peppered moth were carried out by Bernard Kettlewell under the supervision of E.B. Ford. In one of Kettlewell's experiments, moths were released into a large (18\u00a0m by 6\u00a0m) aviary, where they were fed on by Great Tits (\"Parus major\"). In 1953, Kettlewell experimented at Cadbury Nature Reserve in Birmingham. He marked, released and recaptured the marked moths. He found, in polluted woodland, more \"typica\" morphs were taken. This showed that the melanistic phenotype was important to the survival of peppered moths in such a habitat. Kettlewell repeated the experiment in 1955 in an unpolluted woodland in Dorset, and again in polluted woods in Birmingham. He was accompanied by Niko Tinbergen, and they made a film of this. Further studies by others found similar results. Finally, in 1996, work on both sides of the Atlantic found a correlation between changes in melanic frequencies and pollution levels.\nA field experiment in biology will always have some artificiality, but that has to be balanced against practicality and costs. The most important aspect is that an experiment gives useful information. The only previous experiments of this type were R.A. Fisher and E.B. Ford's with the Scarlet tiger moth.\nLater experiments.\nIn 2000 Majerus developed plans for further experiments. In the main experiment in Cambridge from 20012007 Majerus added an experiment to find if bat predation might have skewed the results \u2013 this found that bats preyed equally on both forms of the moth. He observed a number bird species preying on the moths. The overall data led him to conclude that differential bird predation was a major factor responsible for the decline in \"carbonaria\" frequency compared to \"typica\" in Cambridge during the study period. He described his results as a complete vindication of the peppered moth story, and said \"If the rise and fall of the peppered moth is one of the most visually impacting and easily understood examples of Darwinian evolution in action, it should be taught. It provides after all the proof of evolution\". \nMajerus died before he could complete the writing up of his experiments, but the work was carried on by others. The paper said that \"These data provide the most direct evidence yet to implicate camouflage and bird predation as the overriding explanation for the rise and fall of melanism in moths\". The new data, coupled with the weight of previous data show that \"industrial melanism in the peppered moth is still one of the clearest and most easily understood examples of Darwinian evolution in action\".\nCamouflage of caterpillars.\n\"Biston betularia\" caterpillars also occur in two forms, each adapted to a different situation. They develop body colours which match the brown or green twigs of their host plant. This is done by a mechanism called polyphenism. Polyphenism is a kind of polymorphism where different forms of an animal are caused by the same genome. The animal inherits the capability, but the environment determines which form develops. This contrasts with genetic polymorphism of the adults, where each morph (form) inherits a slightly different genome.\nPolyphenism occurs when the animal inherits a developmental switch. The switch is sensitive to some environmental cue or trigger. In this case, researchers discovered that visual experience triggered precise color matching. "}

He is first mentioned (though not seen) in \"Planet of the Spiders\", when the Brigadier thinks the Third Doctor has gone into a coma. The Brigadier calls \"Doctor Sullivan\" and asks him to come to the Doctor's laboratory, but tells him not to bother when Sergeant Benton wakes the Doctor by offering him a cup of coffee. In the next serial, \"Robot\", after the Doctor's third regeneration, Sullivan is called in to help him, and ends up travelling aboard the TARDIS with the Fourth Doctor and Sarah-Jane Smith (played by Elisabeth Sladen) for several adventures. \nThe character was originally devised by the production team to do any action scenes required in episodes when they had envisioned that the new Doctor would be played by an older actor (Sarah-Jane even jokingly compares Harry to James Bond at one point). When forty year-old Tom Baker was cast, however, this was no longer a concern and the decision was taken to write Harry out \u2014 something producer Philip Hinchcliffe later admitted was probably a mistake, as Harry was a likeable and popular character who worked well with both of his fellow leads. \nHarry's last regular appearance is in the season thirteen opener \"Terror of the Zygons\", which had actually been made at the conclusion of the twelfth production block and held over to start the following season. At the conclusion of this story he chooses to return to London by train rather than by TARDIS with the Doctor and Sarah-Jane, who continue their adventures without him. He does, however, reappear three stories later in \"The Android Invasion\", both as the original Harry and an android double. This is the character's final appearance in the programme.\nA photo of Harry can be seen in Sarah-Jane Smith's attic in \"The Sarah-Jane Adventures\" and in \"Invasion of the Bane\", Sarah-Jane thought of naming her newly adopted son after him before deciding on Luke."}

They are practicing what they would do if there was a fire in the building. The event is started when the fire alarm goes off. The fire alarm sound can either be a continuous metal bell, a horn or a two-tone siren. Some old alarms in the UK like the Chloride Gent Warbler will curve between the two tones. The entire building is evacuated and everybody leaves the building using the nearest fire exit. At a school, college or university, the teacher or the lecturer counts the people outside to find out if anyone is missing. Sometimes people are evacuated when a drill is not scheduled by the school. This is called a false alarm. There are rules and regulations in place where fire alarm devices should be tested on a weekly basis. If the fire alarm sounds and the building is not evacuated, this may be due to the a scheduled fire alarm test that people already know about. \nIn the United Kingdom, the law recommends that all schools must do a fire drill every term. But with the current UK government laws, any organization in the UK should conduct a fire drill once a year. In addition to sounding the fire alarms for regular fire drills during term time, regular health and safety checks such as testing fire alarm systems and fire extinguishers must be done weekly. During half term holidays and breaks, these tests are often done during the day so that staff who work during term time know what the fire alarm sounds like. The fire alarm in the United Kingdom sounds either a continuous two tone buzzer or a beep similar to an electronic game beeping in test mode. Sometimes depending on the sounder used, the buzzer can curve between the two tones. In the United States, different states have laws that say how often schools must have fire drills. For example, in many states, schools must have one fire drill per month and fire alarms can either be continuous, or set to different codes such as code 3. \nFire drills commonly take place in schools, colleges and public companies. In public transport such as cruise ships, it is called a muster drill. Fire drills aren't done on airplanes, but a safety demonstration that shows the emergency procedures of the aircraft is done instead. If an aircraft is about to perform an emergency landing, the passangers on the aircraft are told to take the safety brace position on hearing the \"brace\" command.\nDifferent ways of having fire drills.\nDuring fire drills, some schools block exits with a piece of cardboard or something else that is supposed to stand for a fire. This makes people practice finding another way out of the building."}

As a child he was one of the most extraordinary violin prodigies there has ever been. He was one of the greatest violinists of the 20th century. In later life he also performed a lot as conductor. He was a very influential teacher who started a school, the Yehudi Menuhin School, near London, for musically gifted children. He was born an American citizen, but then became Swiss in 1970, and then took on British nationality in 1985.\nLife.\nEarly years.\nYehudi Menuhin was born in New York City, New York. His parents were Russian Jews who came from what is now Belarus. His sisters were Hephzibah Menuhin who became a pianist, and Yaltah Menuhin who became a pianist, painter and poet. His father, Moshe Menuhin, had been a rabbinical student and writer who oppposed Zionism.\nMenuhin had his first violin lessons just after the age of four in San Francisco with the violin teacher Sigmund Anker. He immediately showed extraordinary talent. He continued to study with Louis Persinger, and performed with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra in 1924. and in New York in 1926. He performed in Paris in February 1927, after which he studied with the Romanian composer and violinist George Enescu. When he played Beethoven\u2019s Violin Concerto with the conductor Fritz Busch in New York in November 1927 he immediately became world famous. He not only had the most amazing technique but he also understood the music just as well as any grown up musician. As a child he made many recordings. One of the most remarkable was a recording made in 1932 of Elgar\u2019s Violin concerto. Elgar, who was then 75 years old, was conducting the orchestra.\nMid career.\nDuring World War II Menuhin gave more than 500 performances for American and allied soldiers. He was the first person to perform in the Paris Op\u00e9ra after the war and he went with the composer Benjamin Britten to perform for the people who were prisoners in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, after they were made free in April 1945. He returned to Germany in 1947 to perform with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra with the conductor Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler. Many Jews said he should not have done this, because they said that Furtw\u00e4ngler had played for the Nazis who had killed so many Jews, but Menuhin said it was the right thing to do.\nMenuhin continued to give many performances, but there were times when he did not play so well. He may have worked too hard. He had to give himself time off performing and he practised very carefully and studied meditation and yoga to help him get over his problems.\nLater career.\nMenuhin continued to perform until he was quite old. He did not just play classical music but explored other kinds of music such as jazz which he often played with the famous jazz violinist St\u00e9phane Grappelli, and he explored Indian music and played with the sitarist Ravi Shankar. He also conducted some of the world's greatest orchestras and founded his own chamber orchestra.\nIn 1959 Menuhin made his home in London. He performed a lot in England, including at the Bath Festival, but also continued to travel all over the world.\nIn 1962 he started a school for children who had special musical talent. It was called the Yehudi Menuhin School. The school is in Stoke d'Abernon, Surrey, just south of London.\nIn 1983 he founded together with Robert Masters the Yehudi Menuhin International Competition for Young Violinists. Many of today's famous violinists won prizes at this competition, including Tasmin Little and Nikolaj Znaider.\nIn 1991 he was given the Wolf Prize by the Israeli Government. In the Israeli Knesset he gave a speech in which he criticised Israel's occupation of the West Bank. He said that it was not right for the Jews, who have lived by strict moral behaviour for 5000 years, not to let others (meaning the Palestinians) live their lives there too.\nMenuhin had many pupils who became famous, including Nigel Kennedy.\nPersonal life.\nYehudi Menuhin was married twice. He first married Nola Nicholas, daughter of an Australian industrialist, and sister of Hephzibah Menuhin's first husband. They had two children. After their divorce, he married the British ballerina and actress Diana Gould. They had two sons, Gerard and Jeremy, who became a pianist.\nThe name \"Yehudi\" means 'Jew' in Hebrew. It means \"Thanks to God\".\nYehudi Menuhin was given many honours from all over the world. These include the Commander of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur, a Knight of the Dutch Order of Oranje Nassau, an Hon. KBE, and the Nehru Award for International Understanding. In 1993 he was made a life peer and became Lord Menuhin.\nLord Menuhin died in Berlin, Germany, from bronchitis.\nSoon after his death, the Royal Academy of Music was given the Yehudi Menuhin Archive, a very large collection of musical books, letters etc. that had belonged to Yehudi Menuhin."}

The ancient Egyptians painted hieroglyphics showing the preparation of food. Many recipes are known from ancient Greece. Mithaecus's cookbook was an early one, but most of it has been lost. Athenaeus quotes one short recipe in his Deipnosophistae. Roman recipes are known with some of them starting in the 2nd century B.C with Cato the Elder's De Agri Cultura. Many other authors of this period explained eastern Mediterranean cooking in Greek and Latin.\nMiddle Ages.\nKing Richard II of England asked someone to make a recipe book called \"Forme of Cury\" in 1390. Around the same time another book was published entitled \"Curye on Inglish\". Both books give an idea of how food was made and served in the noble classes of England at that time.\nBy the 1400s, manuscripts appeared, describing the recipes of that time. Many of these give very good information and record the re-discovery of many herbs and spices including coriander, parsley, basil and rosemary. Many of these herbs and spices had been brought back from the Crusades.\nDuring the 1500s and 1600s, printed books appeared. The large houses tried to be better than each other, and books were written on how to manage households and prepare food. In Holland, and England, the noble families competed to see who could make the most splendid foods.\nBy the 1660s cooks published their own books explaining their recipes, in competition with their rivals. Many of these books have now been translated and can be found online.\nFrom 1800 to today.\nFrench chefs.\nIn Europe, none had such influence as the top French chefs. They built the haute cuisine which others copied. La Varenne (1615\u20131678), Car\u00eame (1784\u20131833) and Escoffier (1846\u20131935) were the great innovators.\nModern cooks and chefs.\nBy the 1800s, cooking had become a hobby throughout the world. Using the newest technology and using a new publishing idea, Mrs Beeton (1836\u20131865) published her famous \u2018Book of Household Management\u2019, in 24 parts between 1857 and 1861. Around that same time the American cook Fannie Farmer (1857\u20131915) devoted herself to cooking. She published the book \u2018The Boston Cooking School Cookbook\u2019 in 1896 which had 1849 recipes.\nThe next revolution in popular culture came with introduction of the media cooks. The first was Philip Harben who was first on radio, with newspaper columns and books. Then he was first on British television, before Fanny Craddock.\nTV cooking programs brought the recipes of cooks to a new audience who wanted to try out new ways of cooking. In the early days, the recipes were available by post from the BBC and later with the introduction of the CEEFAX text on screen system, they became available on the television. The new companies of Channel 4 and S4C also brought recipes to the television with their own text system called ORACLE. Today the television is still a major source of recipe information, with world-wide cooks and chefs such as Julia Child, Jamie Oliver, Nigella Lawson and Rachael Ray having TV shows and websites giving the details of all their recipes."}

Women who lived on Cyprus didn't stay virtuous, so Pygmalion decided to live alone and made a sculpture, Galatea. During the Aphrodite feast, thanks to Pygmalion`s prayers, the sculpture turned into a real person. This was called The Pygmalion effect.\nThe Pygmalion effect shows that if we want something enough, we'll get it. It is named after the scholar who demonstrated it. It is also called \"Rosenthal Effect\" and is quoted when we refer to \"The power of affirmation\" and \"The power of praise\".\nAnother example of the Pygmalion effect is in groups. If there are two groups, one group thought that their teacher was \"good\", the other group thought he was \"not good\". The teacher treated both groups the same, but the group with a positive expectations had better outcomes than the others; Simply because those with positive expectations made them perform better than other students.\nThe Pygmalion effect is also an important instrument in management theory. It makes managers be aware, that the success of their employees depends not only on qualification, personal qualities or working environment. Manager always has to believe in his people and expect them to achieve the best results. In such case the subordinates will always feel this trust and demonstrate their best skills and abilities in their work."}

It happens because of the time difference between two places. Some people suffer from jet lag more than other people do.\nIf the departure time (the original body clock) is not the same as the destination time, jet lag can occur. Traveling east is more likely to cause jet lag than traveling west. That is because a cycle of the human's biological time is usually more than 24 hours, and going east makes the day shorter, which is a more difficult adjustment.\nJet lag can have several symptoms. It usually takes the form of fatigue and insomnia. Also, headache, depression, even nausea may strike people. Sufferers can use caffeine or sleeping pills as a way of treatment. Using caffeine (such as in tea or coffee) is helpful, either in the morning when going westward or in the afternoon when going eastward. The hormone melatonin is said to help people sleep. Also, doing things like changing sleeping patterns several days before departure may help people adjust to the new time zone."}

This final layer was installed the week before the inspection.\nFIA rules normally require approval at least 90 days before the race. The FIA had to stretch their own rules to allow the Korean Grand Prix to take place.\nTrack features.\nGerman designer Hermann Tilke designed the track. The track has two parts. One permanent part (3.047\u00a0km) will be used for local races. One temporary part (2.643\u00a0km) will be joined to the permanent part and be used for F1 races. The track has 18 corners. The track will be next to a lake, so some people will be able to see the races from their boats.\nInitial reception.\nA number of problems were uncovered on the first day of practice. Drivers complained about the blind entrance to the pit lane. Jarno Trulli called it \"very dangerous\". A number of cars have bottomed out at turn 16. Charlie Whiting has asked that the corner be changed. The track was slippery and dusty. Lewis Hamilton said \"It was the dirtiest circuit I have ever been on,\" and \"It was so dusty it was incredible.\" The problems with the turn 16 was fixed before the qualifying session the next day."}

There was also a kingdom called \"Joseon\" later in Korean history, so Dangun's kingdom is called \"Go\" (meaning \"Ancient\") Joseon.\nOnce upon a time, Hwanung, the god Hwanin`s son, wanted to go down to the human world. Hwanin noticed that and let Hwanung go down to the human world with three amulets. Hwanung went to the Sindansu in Mount Taebaek, with his 3,000 followers. He managed the human world`s agriculture, morals, and 363 other fields of societal work. All these things went well.\nOne day, two animals visited Hwanung, begging him to change them to human beings. One was a tiger, and the other was a bear. Hwanung gave them an armful of divine wormwood and twenty cloves of divine garlic, and said: \"Eat those for 100 days without being exposed to the sunshine. Then you will become human beings.\"\nThe two animals went to the cave and followed Hwanung`s orders. But during this process, the tiger could not endure this trial, and rushed out from the cave. On the other hand, the bear endured the trial and became a woman. But nobody was willing to marry her. So the bear woman prayed to conceive a baby at Sindansu. Then Hwanung transformed himself into human being for a while and married her. The bear woman gave birth to a baby. That baby was Dangun.\nDangun managed Gojoseon for 1,500 years, and after that long period, Giza succeeded to the throne. Dangun retired from the world and became a mountain god."}

He became a warrior at the late age of 32, after failing the exam at the age of 28. When he arrived Jeolla-do province as the navy commander of western part of Jeolla-do province in 1591, he predicted the war with Japan.

Japan occupied nearly all the land of Josun dynasty which was not prepared for war and tried to supply military provisions through the sea route of Jeolla-do province. Yi had already prepared for war, so he led his navy to victory in every engagement he fought during seven years of war with the Japanese.

This island is at 37\u00b030'N 130\u00b052'E. The part of this island is the peak of the mountain. This mountain is a large stratovolcano which rises from seafloor. The formation time of this volcanic mountain is between the Cainozoic Third Era and the Cenozoic Fourth Era. The highest peak of Ulleungdo is Seonginbong peak, 984 meters. There are Nari Basin and Albong Basin which are made by collapsing Caldera crater in the northern slope. Ulleungdo is a pentagon shape. The length of east and west is 10\u00a0km and the length of south, and north is 9.5\u00a0km, and the total length of seashore is about 56.5\u00a0km.\nHistory of Ulleungdo.\nThe relics of the Bronze Age like dolmens or patternless earthenwares were unearthed in Hyunpo, Namsu and Judongri. According to Samguk Sagi and Samguk Yusa, there was Usan-guk in Silla. But in June 512, ruler Lee Sa Bu conquered the Usan-guk. In the early 1000's, Japanese called Ulleungdo Uruma. Tribute was continued during the Goryeo. In the early 11 century, after the Usan-guk people who was attacked by Yeojin ran away to the mainland, Ulleungdo and Dokdo became direct controlled territory of the Goryeo. In march 1407, the ruler of Tsushima Island sent envoy, presented the local products and sent back the victims for getting a approval that ruler of Tsushima Island administered the Ulleungdo. But the king of Chosun, Tae Jong, rejected it. In the formal term of Chosun, there were a lot of damages because of Japanese's plunder. So the king of Chosun, Tae Jong, enforced the \"empty-island\" policy. In Sejong True Record Geographical Feature Papers, there is a record about Ulleungdo which are called Usan-guk. In 1614, the ruler of Tsushima sent a letter that they should look around the Ulleungdo according to the order of Tokugawa Ieyasu. But the king of Chosun, Gwang Hae Gun also rejected it and issued an order that banned Japanese not to come-and-go the Ulleungdo. In 1618, the government of Tokugawa gave the license to Otani and Murikawa Family to go to Ulleungdo. But Chosun people already lived in Ulleungdo. That Families complained about that to the government of Tokugawa, but the government of Tokugawas could not give the practical support to them. After having a controversy about Ulleungdo, the Japan\u00b4s feudal government;the shogunate banned Japanese to go to Ulleungdo. In 1787, The LaPerouse Expedition Party of France measured the Ulleungdo at first time and they called the Ulleungdo Dagelet. Finally in 1884, the king of Go Jong removed the \"empty island\" policy and reclaimed the Ulleungdo.\nEcology of Ulleungdo.\nThe vegetation of Ulleungdo is very diverse. There are about 650 species of various plants including aromatic trees, silver magnolia, camellia trees, 39 species of specialties and 6 species of natural monuments. Also there are 50 kinds of birds. 25 species are resident birds and 38 species are migratory birds. About 340 species of insects live in Ulleungdo. In the neighboring waters where the cold current and the warm current are meeting, a lot of cuttlefish, sauries, Alaska pollacks are caught.\nOther Features of Ulleungdo.\nIn Ulleungdo, there are 3\u7121 5\u591a. In Ulleungdo, there is no environmental pollution, no snakes and there is so much water, wind and so many beauties, stones, aromatic trees.\nUlleungdo county's tree is a silver magnolia. Ulleungdo county's flower is a camellia flower. And Ulleungdo county's bird is a wood pigeon."}

Estimates of its weight have varied greatly.\nLifestyle.\nIt was a herbivore that stripped leaves from trees. It had a long, low, hornless skull and long frontal and nasal bones. Its front teeth had a single pair of incisors in either jaw. They were round, pointed, and so large that they looked like small tusks. The upper incisors pointed straight downwards, while the lower ones jutted outwards. The upper lip was evidently extremely mobile. The neck was very long, the body big and strong, and the limbs long and thick, column-like.\nSize.\nIts exact size is unclear because of the incompleteness of the fossils. Estimates have been based on skull, teeth, and limb bone measurements. However, the known bone elements are from individuals of different sizes. All skeletal reconstructions are composite extrapolations. This resulted in weight estimates from 11 to 20 tonnes. Its shoulder height has been estimated as . Its length was about from front to back.

It is one of the greatest orchestras in the world. The conductor of the orchestra is Sir Simon Rattle.\nHistory.\nThe Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra was founded in Berlin in the spring of 1882. By 1887 they were known by their present name. Hans von B\u00fclow became their conductor that year and made them into a world class orchestra. Other great conductors were also invited to conduct as guests: Hans Richter, Felix von Weingartner, Richard Strauss, Gustav Mahler, Johannes Brahms and Edvard Grieg. \nIn 1895, Arthur Nikisch became chief conductor, and was followed in 1923 by Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler. The orchestra continued to perform throughout World War II. After Furtw\u00e4ngler fled to Switzerland in 1945, Leo Borchard became chief conductor, but a few months later he was accidentally shot and killed by American forces occupying Berlin. Sergiu Celibidache then took over as chief conductor for seven years, from 1945 to1952. Furtw\u00e4ngler returned in 1952 and conducted the orchestra until his death in 1954.\nHerbert von Karajan led the orchestra from 1955 until he resigned in April 1989. He was a very strict conductor who had to be obeyed in everything he did. The orchestra made lots of great recordings with him. \nAfter Karajan, Claudio Abbado became principal conductor. He helped the orchestra to learn new works, not just the well known classical and romantic works but also the more modern 20th century works. He stopped conducting the Berlin Philharmonic in 2002. At the time Germany was being reunited the orchestra had financial problems.\nIn June 1999, the musicians chose Sir Simon Rattle as their next chief conductor. Rattle made the orchestra into a self-governing body. This meant that they made their own financial decisions and chose the works they would perform and who would be invited to perform with them. \nThe first concert hall of the orchestra was destroyed during WWII in 1944. Since 1963, the orchestra has had a new concert hall called the Philharmonie. On 20 May 2008, a fire broke out at the Philharmonie. A quarter of the roof was damaged and the orchestra could not play there for some time.\nThe orchestra have won many awards for their playing.\nUNICEF appointed the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra and Sir Simon Rattle as Goodwill Ambassadors in November 2007.\nOn 18 December 2008 the Orchestra announced that a Digital Concert Hall would be built. This new internet platform will allow music fans all over the world to see and hear the Philharmonic\u2019s concerts \u2013 live or on demand."}

In humans, well-known RNA viruses are those that cause SARS, Influenza or Hepatitis C.\nViruses that are not RNA viruses use DNA for their genome and are called DNA viruses.\nViruses have a classification system, invented by David Baltimore, a Nobel Prize winner. The RNA viruses in the Baltimore system are classified as:\n\"Sense\" in RNA means \"ready to make proteins, as messenger RNA does\". \"Antisense\" in RNA means \"complementary to messenger RNA\". In complete complementarity each nucleotide is across from its opposite number, so antisense RNA can produce sense RNA. \nAnother system is run by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). It uses terms from the familiar Linnaean taxonomy, like orders and families.\nMutation rates.\nRNA viruses have very high mutation rates compared to DNA viruses. This is because viral RNA polymerases lack the proof-reading ability of DNA polymerases. This explains why it is difficult to make effective vaccines to prevent diseases caused by RNA viruses.\nSome genes of RNA virus are important to the viral replication cycles and mutations are not tolerated. For example, the bit of the hepatitis C virus genome which encodes the core protein is highly conserved, because it is essential to start translation."}

They have developed some extraordinary adaptations which fit them in their parasitic life. They are all single-celled, they are all parasites of animals, and they all form spores.\nThey have a unique organelle, a plastid called an apicoplast, and an apical complex structure which gets them into a host's cell. They do not have structures such as flagella or pseudopods except in certain gamete stages. Body movement is by flexing or gliding.\nThe group were once called the Sporozoa, but this name is now discouraged.\nApicomplexans have complex life cycles, and there is much variation among different apicomplexan groups. Both asexual and sexual reproduction occur. Cell nuclei are haploid.\nThis is a diverse group including organisms such as coccidia, gregarines, piroplasms, haemogregarines, and malarias. Diseases caused by apicomplexan organisms include:\nLife cycle.\nMost members have a complex life-cycle, with both asexual and sexual reproduction. A host is infected by an active invasion by the parasites. The parasites divide to produce \"sporozoites\" which enter its cells. Eventually, the cells burst, releasing \"merozoites\", which infect new cells. Eventually, gametes are produced, and they fuse to create new cysts. There are many variations on this basic pattern, however, and many Apicomplexa have more than one host.\nThe apical complex includes vesicles which open at the front of the cell. They secrete enzymes that allow the parasite to enter other cells. The tip is surrounded by a band of microtubules, called the \"polar ring\", and among the Conoidasida there is also a funnel of tubulin proteins called the \"conoid\".\nThe presence of alveoli and other traits place the Apicomplexa among a group called the alveolates. Several related flagellates, such as \"Perkinsus\" and \"Colpodella\", have structures similar to the polar ring and were formerly included here, but most appear to be closer relatives of the dinoflagellates. They are probably similar to the common ancestor of the two groups.\nAnother similarity is that many apicomplexan cells contain a single plastid, called the apicoplast, surrounded by either 3 or four membranes. Its functions are thought to include tasks such as lipid and haem biosynthesis. It appears to be necessary for survival. The plastids are thought to have a common origin with the chloroplasts of dinoflagellates, and evidence points to an origin from red algae rather than green."}

Rosenhan (1929 \u2013 February 6, 2012) was an American psychologist. He was best known for the Rosenhan experiment. This was a study which looked at how valid psychiatry diagnoses were.\nRosenhan got his Bachelor of Arts degree from Yeshiva University. At Columbia University in 1953 he earned his master's degree. Five years later, he earned a Ph.D in psychology. Rosenhan was an expert on psychology and law. \nIn 1973 Rosenhan published \"On Being Sane in Insane Places\". This was one of the most-read pieces of writing in psychology. The article talks about the Rosenhan experiment. The experiment was that eight people with no history of psychopathology would try to get into twelve psychiatric hospitals. All of these people were allowed in, and were diagnosed with either schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Psychiatrists then tried to cure the people using psychiatric medicines. All eight were allowed to leave within 7 to 52 days, but only when they had said that they accepted the illness they had been diagnosed with. Later in the study, a research and teaching hospital challenged Rosenhan to run a similar experiment with its own diagnoses and rules for letting people in to the hospital. Psychiatric staff were warned that at least one pseudo-patient might be sent to their hospital. At least one staff member thought that 83 out of the 193 new patients were actors. In fact, Rosenhan sent no actors. The study showed that the ways diagnosis was done was very inaccurate in telling people with mental disorders and people without mental disorders apart. The paper made a lot of controversy. Some people are not sure of how valid and credible the study was, but say that psychiatric diagnoses need to be improved.\nProfessor Rosenhan worked with the Stanford University Department of Psychology. Later, he became professor emeritus at Stanford University. He died on February 6, 2012, aged 82."}

The 2007 Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to Albert Fert and Peter Gr\u00fcnberg for the discovery of GMR.\nDiscovery.\nGMR was discovered in layers iron, chrome and ferrite by Peter Gr\u00fcnbergs research team of the J\u00fclich Research Centre (Germany) in 1988. Peter Gr\u00fcnberg owns a patent for the technology. It was also discovered by Albert Ferts research group of the University of Paris-Sud (France) in layers ferrite and chrome. The Fert group were first to see what they thought of as a \"large\" effect which is why they gave the name \"Giant\". The Fert group were also first to explain the correct physics of GMR. The discovery was the beginning of the science spintronics. Gr\u00fcnberg and Fert have been given prizes and awards, including the 2007 Nobel Prize in Physics, for this discovery and other spintronics work.\nTypes of GMR.\nMultilayer GMR.\nIn multilayer GMR, two or more magnetic layers are separated by a very thin (about 1\u00a0nm) non-magnetic (insulating) layer. Ferrite, a form of iron, is a magnetic layer and chrome is an insulating layer. At certain thickness, the strength of magnetism between the layers becomes easy to measure and adjust. The strength of electrical current between the layers can change by up to 10%.\nThe GMR effect was first observed in stacks of 10 or more layers.\nSpin valve GMR.\nIn spin valve GMR, two magnetic layers are separated by a thin (~3\u00a0nm) non-magnetic (insulating) layer. It is possible to measure and adjust the strength of magnetism between these layers.\nIt is hoped that research into spinning electrons will improve spin valves. \nMaterials used in spin valves are copper and an alloy of nickel and iron. \nSpin valve GMR is the most useful sort for hard drives and is tested carefully to meet industry standards.\nGranular GMR.\nGranular GMR is an effect found in copper containing grains of cobalt. It is not possible to control the strength of granular GMR in the same manner as Multilayer GMR.\nUse of GMR.\nGMR is used in modern hard drives and magnetic sensors. Another use of the GMR effect is in magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM). GMR has begun a new science of electronics called spintronics."}

First used in 2001, its music is the same as that of the former national anthem of the Soviet Union, which was written by Alexander Alexandrov in 1938. The words were newly written by Sergey Mikhalkov in 2000, who also wrote the words for the Soviet national anthem back in 1943.\nHistory of Russian anthems.\nWhat is today the Russian Federation has had several different anthems over the years. The earliest of these, called \"Let the Thunder of Victory Rumble!\" () was used in the late 18th to early 19th century. In 1816, the Russian Empire adopted \"The Prayer of the Russians\" (), whose melody was that of the British anthem God Save the King. This anthem was used until 1833, when a new composition called \"God Save the Tsar!\" () was chosen by Nicholas I, but did not became popular until 1837. Its melody became used in classical music such as Beethoven's Wellington's Victory and Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture.\n\"God Save the Tsar!\" continued to be the national anthem until the February Revolution in March 1917, when an adaptation of the French national anthem, known as the \"Worker's Marseillaise\" (), was used for a short time. Later that year, when the October Revolution happened, the Bolsheviks adopted a Russian translation of \"The Internationale\", which became the national anthem of the Soviet Union when it was founded in 1922. This was replaced by the \"State Anthem of the Soviet Union\" with Alexandrov's music and Mikhalkov's lyrics in 1944. The lyrics were removed in 1953 after the death of Joseph Stalin, but a new set of lyrics were added in 1977.\nWhile the republics of the Soviet Union had their own anthems during this time, the Russian SFSR did not, instead using the Soviet national anthem. However, in 1990, the Russian SFSR adopted a composition by Mikhail Glinka, known as \"Patrioticheskaya Pesnya\" (), as its state anthem. There were never any official words to this song. After the Soviet Union broke down in 1991, the president of the newly-formed Russian Federation, Boris Yeltsin, continued to use \"Patrioticheskaya Pesnya\" as the country's national anthem. When he was replaced by Vladimir Putin in 2000, the new president began to push for the melody of the old Soviet anthem to be brought back. Finally, in December of that year, the State Duma voted in favour of the music of the Soviet anthem, together with new lyrics by Mikhalkov, to be adopted as the national anthem, and the new anthem was performed for the first time during a ceremony at the Great Kremlin Palace just before the New Year."}

His longest-running role was as a frequent \"candidate\" for President of the United States.\nPaulsen was born in South Bend, Washington. Paulsen had served in the United States Marines during World War II. After the war, he went to college, and worked a variety of jobs (as a salesman, an , a truck driver, and others) before starting a comedy with his brother. After the troupe broke up, Paulsen started performing on his own. He played at many of the same as the Smothers Brothers, before they became famous.\nAfter the Smothers Brothers began a television variety show (\"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\") in 1967, they invited Paulsen to join their regular cast. He wrote for the show, and also appeared on camera in different roles. He began a series of mock editorials, that became very popular, by both poking fun at extremist opinions, and giving people reasons to think and talk about important issues (the First Amendment, gun control, drugs, and other matters). Hundreds of viewers wrote to CBS, who broadcast the \"Comedy Hour\", to ask for copies of the editorials.\nDuring 1968 (an election year in the United States), Paulsen began a pretend \"campaign\" for President, and used the campaign to show the humor and irony in American politics. He did many of the things a real candidate would do, making public appearances, giving speeches, granting media interviews, and making his \"stand on the issues\" well known. When Election Day came, people in many places around the United States really did vote for Paulsen, as a candidate, because they were not satisfied with what the real candidates (Republican Richard M. Nixon, Democrat Hubert Humphrey, Alabama governor George Wallace, and others) promised to do as President.\nAfter \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\" ended in 1969, Paulsen continued to work as a comedian and actor. Instead of just making people laugh, he often drew their attention to problems in American society, such as pollution, prejudice, and poor government. During the 1970s, he bought the Cherry County Playhouse, a theater in Traverse City, Michigan that showed .\nPaulsen sometimes reunited with the Smothers Brothers, and usually staged another pretend campaign every election year. In 1992 he chose singer Tiny Tim as his , to become his Vice President. Paulsen died on April 24, 1997 from pneumonia from complications of brain and colon cancer, during medical treatment in Tajuana, Mexico, he was 69 years old. He is survived by his wife Noma Paulsen.\nOther websites.\n "}

Its hosts were comedians Dan Rowan and Dick Martin. The show's name came from a trend of naming public events with an \"-In\", such as the Human Be-In of 1967.\nBegun as a one-time television , the first \"Laugh-In\" was so popular that it became a regular show in 1968. Hosts Rowan and Martin dressed in tuxedos, and played to the other performers on the show. Radio host Gary Owens played the show's . Producers George Schlatter and Ed Friendly worked behind the scenes, and did not appear on camera.\n\"Laugh-In\" featured \" humor\", with most of its comedy based on current events. The show mocked contemporary trends and fashions, and imitated popular styles of the time. Regular features were \"the Party\", where performers told about current issues in a party setting, \"\"Laugh-In\" Looks at the News\", a mock news broadcast, and the \"Joke Wall\", where the cast ran from door to door in a specially-built wall, and told old jokes. The show also used , including \"Sock it to me!\", \"You bet your bippy!\" and \"Look that up in your !\"\nThe show featured a large cast of performers, including many who were new to television. These included Goldie Hawn, Arte Johnson, Lily Tomlin, Henry Gibson, Ruth Buzzi, Dave Madden, Joanne Worley, Alan Sues, Chelsea Brown, Judy Carne and others. Several of the performers went on to longtime comedy and acting careers. British actor Jeremy Lloyd and \"Hogan's Heroes\" cast members Richard Dawson and Larry Hovis also appeared on the show for a time.\nGuests on \"Laugh-In\" included Tiny Tim, The Monkees, Ringo Starr, and other famous singers and actors. Some were veterans of , while others were newly famous, or became famous partly through appearing on the show. Dewey \"Pigmeat\" Markham, an African-American comedian not known to white audiences, was first imitated on the show by Sammy Davis, Jr., then appeared himself, becoming a surprise hit with the same Judge routine he had played for years on the \"chitlin' circuit\". (\"Here come the Judge!\" became another show catchphrase.) Richard M. Nixon appeared in a short segment on the show, when he was campaigning for President of the United States, and some people believed this helped him get elected.\nThe series became less popular as time went on, and ended in 1974, with the show's producers explaining that they had \"run out of things to parody\" (make fun of). A reunion special in 1979 led to a short revival of the show as a \"summer replacement\" series, featuring guests like Robin Williams."}

They have eukaryotic cells without flagella and centrioles. Their chloroplasts lack external endoplasmic reticulum. These chloroplasts have unstacked (stroma) thylakoids. Phycobiliproteins are accessory pigments, which give them their red color. What these pigments do is the same as what chlorophyll does: absorb sunlight as energy, which is then used to fuel the building of organic compounds.\nRed algae store sugars as a type of starch outside their plastids. \nMost red algae are also multicellular, macroscopic, marine, and reproduce sexually. The red algal life history is typically an alternation of generations that may have three generations rather than two.\nChloroplasts evolved following an endosymbiotic event between an ancestral, photosynthetic cyanobacterium and an early eukarytoic phagotroph.\nMost species grow near tropical and subtropical shores below the low-tide mark.

It passed over the Azores, and it stopped being a subtropical cyclone on October\u00a05. What was left of the storm went on to become Hurricane Vince. After the hurricane season ended, the National Hurricane Center checked to make sure they did not miss any storms during the year.

The weather system gained strength over the next few days. On October\u00a03, it became a type of low pressure system. Thunderstorms around the storm began to become more active, and it then became a type of cyclone that is called a \"subtropical depression\".\nAt about the same time, the depression turned towards the northeast and gained strength. It became a subtropical \"storm\", which is stronger than a subtropical \"depression\". The storm gained a bit more strength later that day. It then moved across the Azores, and began to weaken. The storm weakened slightly as it moved to the north-northeast. The storm died out on October 5. What was left of the storm later became Subtropical Storm Vince.\nEffects and records.\nHigh winds were reported in parts of the Azores because of the storm. The strongest winds were on Santa Maria Island, where there was a gust of 59\u00a0mph (94\u00a0km/h). Ponta Delgada also saw 52\u00a0mph (85\u00a0km/h) wind gusts. There was no damage and there were no deaths. The storm was not said to be a subtropical storm until the National Hurricane Center found it on April\u00a010, 2006. Every year, the National Hurricane Center checks to make sure they did not miss any storms during the past tropical storm season.

The band's early music was liked by many record labels. The labels made many offers to sell Cloud Cult's music, but the band decided to self-publish instead, which means that they make their albums themselves without the help of a company. As the band became more popular and started playing live more often, Connie Minowa and Scott West started painting onstage during shows. .\nIn 1997, Craig Minowa started Earthology Records on his organic farm. The new record company now sells the bands' music. \nThe band's newest album, \"Feel Good Ghosts (Tea-Partying Through Tornadoes)\" was released on April 8, 2008. The album is their most popular album yet. Also in 2008, a documentary about the band was made.\nAfter the album was released, Craig Minowa said that it might be the last Cloud Cult album ever. The band is currently taking a break, so the members can focus on their families. \nIn October of 2008, the band had a song in an animated Esurance commercial. The band is shown playing their instruments while floating on clouds. After making the commercial, the band put a few songs on Esurance's website. The songs are available to freely download."}

It was produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by Buena Vista Distribution. It is the 20th Disney animated movie. The movie is based on a story by Tom McGowan and Tom Rowe. It is about a family of aristocratic cats. They are kidnapped by their greedy butler, Edgar. Edgar wants to gain the fortune that the cats' owner has left to them in her will. An alley cat named Thomas O'Malley helps them make their way back home. O'Malley also helps them defeat Edgar. In the end, O'Malley becomes a part of the family. The movie was directed by Wolfgang Reitherman. It features the voices of Eva Gabor, Hermione Baddeley, Phil Harris, Dean Clark, Sterling Holloway, Scatman Crothers, and Roddy Maude-Roxby.\nIn 1962, \"The Aristocats\" began as an original script for a two-part live-action episode of \"Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color\". It was developed by writers Tom McGowan and Tom Rowe and producer Harry Tytle. Following two years of re-writes, Walt Disney said that the project would be better made as an animated movie. The project was placed in turnaround as \"The Jungle Book\" continued production. When \"The Jungle Book\" was nearly complete, Disney appointed Ken Anderson to develop preliminary work on \"The Aristocats\". It was the last movie project to be approved by Walt Disney before his death on December 15, 1966.\n\"The Aristocats\" was released on December 11, 1970. It received positive reception and was a box office success.\nPlot.\nThe movie takes place in Paris in 1910. A mother cat named Duchess (Eva Gabor) and her three kittens, Marie (Liz English), Berlioz (Dean Clark) and Toulouse (Gary Dubin), are going to receive their owner's (Hermione Baddeley) fortune when she dies. But Edgar (Roddy Maude-Roxby), their English butler, does not like this and plans to send the cats away.\nHe places sleeping tablets in their dinner. At night, he plans on dropping them off in the countryside. Two hound dogs, Napoleon (Pat Buttram) and Lafayette (George Lindsey), attack him, and the cats are now stranded.\nIn the morning, they meet an alley cat named Thomas O'Malley (Phil Harris). He helps them on their way back home. He even lets them stay at his \"pad\" (the place where he and his \"gang\", or friends, stay).\nThey finally make their way back home, but Edgar re-catches them in a sack and plans to send them to Timbuktu, Africa. O'Malley, Scat Cat (Scatman Crothers) and his gang, Roquefort the Mouse (Sterling Holloway), and Frou-Frou the Horse (Nancy Kulp) all fight Edgar. Roquefort frees Duchess and the kittens. In the end, Edgar is kicked into the trunk, locked inside, and sent to Timbuktu himself. Madame Adelaide's will is re-written to not include Edgar and instead include O'Malley. She also starts a charity foundation. This foundation gives a home to all the cats in Paris.\nRelease.\nHome media.\n\"The Aristocats\" was released on VHS in Europe on January 1, 1990. It was first released on VHS in North America in the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection series on April 24, 1996.\nIn January 2000, Walt Disney Home Video launched the Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection, with \"The Aristocats\" re-released on VHS and DVD on April 4, 2000.

He served as Governor of Alabama serving from 1963 to 1967. He ran for President of the United States three times (1964, 1968, 1976).\nWallace was born in Cilio, Alabama. He began his long political career at the age of 33 after running for county judge.\nWhen Wallace was running for president, he was shot and paralyzed for the rest of his life. His is known for having different views on segregation. He was a Democrat.\nWallace died at the age of 79 from sepsis caused by a spinal infection after 26 years of being in a wheelchair.\nEarly life.\nWallace was born George Corely Wallace on August 25, 1919 in Clio, Alabama. He studied at University of Alabama. He grew up in a lower-middle-class family. As a young man, he was an amateur boxer, where he fought as a bantamweight.\nWallace was a very short man for his entire life, and as an adult was about 5'2\" (1.57m)\nCareer.\nHe served four terms as governor of Alabama, and also ran for President of the United States several times, during the 1960s and 1970s. Wallace was a longtime supporter of segregation; a policy that did not allow African-Americans to attend the same schools, or go to many of the same public places, as white people. In 1963 he stood in a schoolhouse door to prevent black students from attending the school (which would have integrated the school). In a speech, he said he would support \"segregation today, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever\". He was a controversial figure. Some people saw him as a man who spoke up for the poor and was an outspoken populist. Others viewed him as a terrible person, a white supremacist who encouraged violence.\nIn time, he changed his views, and said that he was sorry to African-Americans, and other people hurt by segregation. He promoted black equality in his last term as Governor. Despite this, he remains an icon of racism today and many people think of him as one of the most evil figures in American history.\nAssassination attempt.\nDuring the 1972 presidential campaign, Wallace was shot five times by a would-be assassin, Arthur Bremer. He suffered permanent injury to his spine. He could no longer walk, and spent the rest of his life using a wheelchair.\nLater career.\nAfter his last term as governor, he began speaking in public places (including churches).\nPersonal life.\nWallace was married to Laurleen Wallace until her death. He then married to Corelia Wallace until they divorced. Then he was married to Lisa Taylor until they divorced. He had four children.\nPopular Culture.\nThe Lynyrd Skynyrd song \"Sweet Home Alabama\" has the line \"In Birmingham they love the Governor / Boo Boo Boo / Now we all did what we could do / if watergate does not bother me / does your conscience bother you now tell me true.\" Even though Wallace is not mentioned by name, the line clearly refers to him, and members of the band have confirmed this and have said they disliked Wallace.\nGary Sinise played him in the film \"George Wallace\".\nA tunnel on Interstate 10 in Alabama has been named the George Wallace Memorial Tunnel.\nDeath.\nWallace died on September 13, 1998 in Montgomery, Alabama from sepsis complicated by a spinal infection, aged 79. He was buried at Greenwood Cemetery in Montgomery."}

However, it is now widely accepted as the direct ancestor of Asian \"Homo erectus\", \"Homo neanderthalensis\", \"Homo heidelbergensis\", and hence \"Homo sapiens\".\nIt is one of the earliest members of the genus \"Homo\", possibly ancestral to, or sharing a common ancestor with, \"Homo erectus\". Some paleoanthropologists consider \"H. ergaster\" is just the African variety of \"H. erectus\". There are Asian fossils of \"H. erectus\", which was the first human species to spread from Africa. \nThe name \"ergaster\" means \"workman\", in reference to the Acheulean hand axe industry developed by the species. The species' period in eastern and southern Africa coincided with the first part of the Pleistocene, the cooling of the global climate and the start of the ice ages.

He lived in Victoria and was different from other bushrangers. There are a lot of stories and legends told about Captain Moonlight.\nEarly life.\nScott was born in Rathfriland, County Down, Ireland, in 1842. His father was an Anglican clergyman. Scott had a good education, good manners, and had read the Bible. He left Ireland and went to London. \nAfter hearing about the gold rushes in Australia he made his way to Victoria. He went to New Zealand and took part in the Maori Wars in 1861. He was speared in the leg, which left him with a limp. At the end of the war, he went back to Melbourne and began to train as a clergyman in the Church of England.\nPreacher.\nHe began work with the church in the Bacchus Marsh area. He lived at the small town of Mount Egerton. From there he went travelled around, visiting people, and doing church work.\nAt 1.00 am, Andrew came to the bank with his face covered, and armed with a gun, went into the house of the Mount Egerton bank manager, Mr. Brunn. The robber forced Brunn to walk down to the school and write a note, which said, \u201cCaptain Moonlite has stuck me up and robbed the bank.\u201d They went back to the bank where Moonlight tied Brunn up before taking all the money. \nIn the morning, the teacher, Mr. Simpson, found the note. He ran to the bank and untied Brunn. Brunn told the police that the man was the preacher, Andrew Scott. Scott said it was a lie, and told the police it was a plan by Brunn and Simpson to steal money from the bank. Everyone believed the preacher, and the police arrested Brunn and Simpson for robbing the bank.\nLeaving town.\nScott left Mount Egerton and told people he was going to go to the South Pacific. He was the main witness in the bank robbery. When he left, the police had to drop the charges against Brunn and Simpson. He bought a boat, the \"Swallow\", and sailed out of Sydney with a group of rich young men. He just passed through the Sydney Heads when a police steam launch caught up with him and made him go back. He had paid for the boat with a bad cheque. He was sent to gaol (jail) for 18 months...,\nConvict.\nAs soon as he was let out of gaol in Sydney, he was arrested for the Mount Egerton robbery. The police put him in the new Ballarat Gaol to wait for his trial. He was able to make a hole into the next cell. With help from another prisoner, Dermoodie, they overpowered the guard and locked him in the cell. They let all the other prisoners out of their cells. They stood on each other's backs and shoulders to get to the top of the gaol wall. \nUsing a rope made from blankets tied together, the prisoners climbed the wall and escaped. Within one week, the police got back all the prisoners. The court gave Scott ten years in gaol for the bank robbery and one year for escaping from Ballarat. He was locked up in Pentridge Gaol. Scott behaved in gaol. After he was let out of gaol, he spoke at meetings about prison reform.\nBushranger.\nOn November 18, 1879, a group of bushrangers led by Captain Moonlight, held up the Wantabadgery station (farm), east of Wagga Wagga. They stayed there for three days and held up all the people travelling along the road. They held about 30 people prisoner. One person was able to escape and tell the police. Two groups of police from Wagga Wagga and Gundagai went to the farm. \nAfter a lot of shooting, the bushrangers left and the police chased them through the bush. A bushranger, Gus Wernicke, aged 15, was shot and died in great pain. A policeman, Constable Bowen was badly hurt, and died a few days later. Captain Moonlight gave himself up to the police. The police captured the rest of the gang a few days later.\nThe police charged the bushrangers with the murder of Bowen. In court at Darlinghurst, Sydney, Scott tried to take the blame for the crime. He wanted the lives of his friends saved. Captain Moonlight, and gang member, Rogan, were hanged on January 20, 1880. In a letter from prison, Scott asked to buried next to his friend, James Nesbitt. In 1995 he was reburied at Gundagai next to gang members Gus Wernicke and James Nesbitt. A death mask was made of Scott by Walter McGill. This mask is now in the Justice and Police Museum, New South Wales.\nMoonlite in arts, music and books.\nThe State Library of Victoria has a drawing of Scott made in November, 1879, in its collection. This can be seen on line. Artist Patrick William Marony painted a picture in 1894 of the gang (Scott, Bennett, Rogan, Nesbit and Williams), which he called \"The Moonliters\". It is kept in the National Library of Australia and can be seen online."}

It is very similar to a simple music box where the pins pluck a metal harp. With a barrel organ, the pins in the barrel lift \"keys\" that open valves that let air from the bellows to play the pipes. \nThe barrel organ is sometimes wrongly called a hurdy gurdy, which is a string instrument. Barrel organs come in many different sizes from hand carried ones to large sizes carried on a wagon or trailer. Usually each barrel had a number of tunes on it, and the tune could be changed to different selection by lifting an indexing pin and sliding the barrel to the next index position. Even a small hand carried organ could play six or eight tunes. Stationary barrel organs, built into large houses or churches, were larger pipe organs, and could play longer, and more serious music. Some had different barrels or revolving barrel changers, which meant they did not need an organist to play them, and had a larger selection of music.

With the exception of Ned Kelly, there have been more songs, poems and stories about him than any other bushranger. He quickly became a folk hero. Governor Ralph Darling told hotel owners they would have their hotels closed if they allowed people to sing songs about Donahue.\nEarly life.\nJack Donahue was born in Dublin, Ireland in 1804. He was in trouble with the police for his political activities to gain independence for Ireland. In 1824, he was found guilty of \u201cintent to commit a felony\u201d. This means he was going to do something wrong, but he had not done it yet. He was sent to Sydney on the convict ship \"Ann and Amelia\", which arrived on 2 January, 1825. He was sent to work for a Mr. Pagan at Parramatta. He was soon in trouble and put to work on a road gang. Major West, at Quaker\u2019s Hill, employed Donahue to look after his pigs.\nWith two other men, George Kilroy and Bill Smith, he held up some carts on the Richmond Road. The police soon caught them and the court sentenced them to death. As he was being taken back to gaol (jail) in Sydney he escaped. The government offered a reward of \u00a320 for his capture.\nBushranger.\nIn August 1828, Donahue and a gang of eight robbed houses south of Bathurst. A police group nearly captured Donahue near Goulburn. They shot at the gang, and killed several gang members. Donahue escaped and was not seen for several months.\nHe next appeared in the Nepean River valley around the towns of Liverpool, Penrith, Windsor, Parramatta and Liberty Plains. They robbed the Reverend Samuel Marsden near Windsor. Donahue was working with a man known as \u201cDarky\u201d Underwood, and an escaped convict Jack Walmsley. The government increased the reward to \u00a350.\nIn April 1830, Governor Ralph Darling made a special law to try to stop bushranging. The police could arrest anyone, enter and search houses without having to have a warrant. There were many stories, some people said Donahue and Underwood had gone to New Zealand, others said they had been killed by the aborigines. On 22 May, 1830, Donahues' gang held up the famous explorer, Charles Sturt. Donahue recognized Sturt and told the others to let him go.\nCaptured.\nOn 1 September, 1830, a group of police and soldiers searching for Donahue found him near a creek at Bringelly. Donahue shouted at them to try to capture him. Private John Muckleston fired his rifle and pistol, hitting Donahue in the neck and forehead. He died soon afterward. His body was taken to Sydney. The surveyor and explorer, Sir Thomas Mitchell, drew a picture of Donahue. This is the only known picture of him.\nWalmlsey was shot and killed soon after. Gang member Bill Webber was caught and hanged. Darky Underwood was shot and killed in 1832.\nDonahue in poetry and song.\nThere are many songs and poems about the life of Jack Donahue. These include:"}

He lived in northern New South Wales. Some people thought he was like Robin Hood, who robbed from the rich to help the poor.\nEarly life.\nWard was born Windsor, New South Wales in 1835. His father, Michael Ward, had been sent to Australia as a convict in 1815. Fred was one of eleven children. He was arrested in 1856 for selling 50 stolen horses, and sent to prison on Cockatoo Island for ten years. After four years he was given a ticket of leave which meant he was able to leave the gaol as long as he reported to the police every three months.\nEscape from gaol.\nWard went to the Mudgee area to work. There he met a girl named Mary Ann Bugg who had a convict father and aboriginal mother. Mary Ann fell pregnant soon afterwards. Ward took her back to her father's farm near Dungog and did not report to the Mudgee police on time. His ticket of leave was cancelled. When he reached the Mudgee police station, he was also arrested for stealing the horse he was riding. He was sent back to Cockatoo Island to finish his six years in gaol plus another three for the stolen horse. \nOn 11 September 1863, he and Fred Britten escaped from gaol. They swam from Cockatoo Island and headed north to the New England district in north-east New South Wales. The government put up a reward of \u00a325 for Ward\u2019s capture. Late in October 1863, they robbed a woman at Gostwyck Hut, near Armidale, and stole a shotgun and some bacon. A few days later they were seen by the police near Thunderbolt's Rock. In the gunfight that followed Ward was shot in the back of the left knee. The two bushrangers split up soon afterwards. \nBushranger.\nIn December 1863, Ward tried to take money from the toll keeper on the road between Maitland and Rutherford. There were only a few shillings in the cash box. Ward took the money but later gave it back. As he left, he told the toll keeper that his name was \"Captain Thunderbolt\". He then went into the Spread Eagle Inn (hotel) and asked for food. When he asked for his bill, the owner, Mrs. Byrne, told him that there was no charge. He replied that since she was so nice, he was not going to rob her. The police began to search for him but he managed to escape. \nA quiet life.\nIn 1864, Ward and Mary Ann lived quietly in the north-western plains near Bourke. Early in 1865 he joined up with three other men and formed his first gang. His three companions were McIntosh, Thomas Hogan (also known as The Bull), and a youth called John Thompson. They robbed travellers and stations near Collarenebri. A group of police from Bourke followed their tracks and found their camp in the bush. The gang escaped but Mary Ann and her two children were captured by the police. They started to take her to Bourke but she pretended she was having a baby and they left her at a nearby station. Ward went to the station and rescued his family, and took gunpowder and food. Ward and his first gang broke up after young Thompson was shot and nearly killed in April 1865 at Millie near Moree. Mary Ann was arrested again in 1866 and also in 1867 but she was soon released from prison because of support from the community. \n1865 and after.\nLate in 1865, Ward formed his second bushranging gang with Patrick Kelly and Jemmy the Whisperer. They robbed as far south as \nQuirindi, Currabubula and Carroll. At Carroll they had another shoot-out with the police in December 1865 where a trooper was shot in the arm. The gang split up early in January 1866. \nWard had another quiet year in 1866. Early in 1867 he took on another young accomplice, Thomas Mason. They carried out robberies from near Scone as far north as the Queensland border. Mason was captured by the police in September 1867. Later that year, Ward and Mary Ann separated. Mary Ann lived for the rest of her life at Mudgee where she died in 1905.\nIn 1868 Ward took on another young accomplice, William Monckton, and they committed many robberies in northern New South Wales. They separated in December 1868 and soon afterwards Monckton was captured by the police. Ward did not have any other accomplices. Some claim that Thunderbolt was involved in about 80 robberies and stole about \u00a320,000, but his takings were much smaller than that. \nCaptured.\nOn 25 May 1870 the police at Uralla were told that Thunderbolt was robbing travellers at Blanch's Royal Oak Inn, near Thunderbolt's Rock Constable Alexander Binney Walker chased after Ward on horseback for six or seven miles until they reached Kentucky Creek, south-west of Uralla. Ward jumped off his horse and began swimming across the creek. Constable Walker shot Thunderbolt\u2019s horse, then he shot and killed Ward himself. Ward was later buried at Uralla. \nWhile there have been stories that it was Ward's brother William who was killed, these stories are easily disproven.\nHeritage.\nThunderbolt's Rock and Blanch's Royal Oak Inn were added to New South Wales State Heritage List in July 2012. This listing will protect the site which are now important places for tourists who come to the area. The site of his death at Kentucky Creek, and his grave, have also been added to the Heritage List."}

Those trends were coming to Poland because of noble people's travells and political contacts but they were becoming popular some time later then in other countries.\nPolish Baroque literature had to trends: elitary one (Jan Andrzej Morsztyn, Maciej Kazimierz Sarbiewski, Daniel Naborowski) and the other one, created by usual nobles (Jan Chryzostom Pasek).\nIn times of Enlightenment Polish literature was influenced by France. Poland-Lithuania was very weak country and needed political changes. Literature was mainly about society and state, not about love or religion.\nIn 19th century Poland was not independent. From 1822 to 1863 there was Romanticism in Polish literature. Romantic poets include Adam Mickiewicz who wrote \"Pan Tadeusz\" epic in 1834, Juliusz S\u0142owacki and Zygmunt Krasi\u0144ski.\nAfter failed anti-Russian uprising in 1863 Romanticism ended in Poland.\nSeveral Polish novelists have won the Nobel prize. Henryk Sienkiewicz won in 1905. He wrote dramatized versions of famous events in Polish history. W\u0142adys\u0142aw Reymont won a Nobel prize in 1924. He wrote the novel Ch\u0142opi.\nStanis\u0142aw Lem is famous science fiction author in the modern era. His \"Solaris\" novel was made twice into a feature film."}

The motion is passed or rejected by means of a parliamentary vote (a Vote of confidence). Governments often propose a Motion of confidence to replace a Motion of no confidence proposed by the opposition.\nDefeat of a Motion of Confidence in a parliamentary democracy generally requires one of two actions: the resignation of the government, or a request for a parliamentary dissolution and the calling of a General Election.\nIn Italy the Constitution provides only the motion of confidence and that of not-confidence, respectively to start and to end the life of a government; the question of confidence, by which the government asks a Chamber to approve without change its texts, is the result of a tradition of the late nineteenth century and is increasingly used to accelerate the legislative process, but does not apply to rules for amending Constitution."}

The plant plays a significant role in traditional Andean culture. Coca leaves contain cocaine alkaloids, a basis for the drug cocaine, which is a powerful stimulant. Today the plant has many uses, including traditional use by Andean cultures to flavoring Coca-Cola products to use as an anesthetic.\nHistory.\nCoca has been cultivated by Andean cultures for thousands of years. Traditionally people would chew the leaf or soak it in hot water to make tea in order to get a small energy boost. Coca was introduced to Europe in the 16th century. After its stimulating effects were described by a European doctor in the 19th century, people began to refine the leaves to get cocaine. As people began to learn more about cocaine it began to be banned in many countries. In 1961 the United Nations classified the coca leaf as a narcotic even though studies had shown the leaf itself was non-addictive. This has led the United States to pressure coca-growing countries such as Peru and Bolivia to stop growing coca entirely. These countries have responded by fighting the 1961 decision, trying to remove the coca plant from the list."}

The band formed in 1996.\nCareer.\nDebut titled-album and the \"Gasoline\" music video (1996-1997).\nSkillet formed in 1996 with two members: John Cooper, former vocalist for Tennessee progressive rock band Seraph, and Ken Steorts, former guitarist for Urgent Cry. The two bands met through touring together, but those bands disbanded soon after, so John and Ken's pastor encouraged them to form their own band as a side-project. Coming from different styles of rock music, they decided to name the experiment Skillet. After, Trey McClurkin joined the band as a temporary drummer. Skillet was only together for a month when they received interest from major Christian record label ForeFront Records. In 1996 they released a self-titled debut \"Skillet\". It was well-received, and the trio continued to write new material as they toured the United States. One topic that comes up often among fans and the band itself, is the name 'Skillet'. John Cooper, the lead vocalist, explains that it was a joke at first. Each starting band member was already in a separate band, and all decided to start a side project. Since each other band had a different sound and style to it, the side project was said to be like putting all of those styles in a big skillet to come up with something unique, hence the band name 'Skillet'. The band name is still somewhat of a joke between the band members, especially Cooper, who claims to still not like the title.\nTracklist.\n1. Gasoline&lt;br&gt;\n2. Saturn&lt;br&gt;\n3.

My Beautiful Robe&lt;br&gt;\n11. You Thought&lt;br&gt;\n12. Darn Great Day\nHey You, I Love Your Soul and the \"More Faithful\" music video (1998-1999).\nSkillet recorded their follow-up album throughout 1997, titled \"Hey You, I Love Your Soul\", which was released in April 1998. Their second effort was a change in style from the band's first release. With this release, Skillet would abandon their post-grunge approach for a lighter alternative rock and style. His wife Korey was enlisted soon after to play keyboards live in order to alleviate John's live performance duties.\nTracklist.\n1. Hey You, I Love Your Soul&lt;br&gt;\n2. Pour&lt;br&gt;\n3.

Last Day Of Summer\nInvincible and Ardent Worship and the \"Best Kept Secret\" music video (2000-2001).\nShortly before the band began recording for their third album, \"Invincible\", Steorts left the band to be with his family and launch Visible Music College, a modern music ministry college located in Memphis, Kevin Haaland joined the band as their new guitarist, and Korey Cooper joined the band permanently and played keyboards for the recording of \"Invincible\". Because of this change, the musical style on \"Invincible\" changed to a more electronic sound. Soon after the release of \"Invincible\" in 2000, Trey McClurkin parted ways with Skillet, and Lori Peters filled the drummer's position.\nIn late 2000 (several months after \"Invincible\" was released), The band released the worship album, and fourth album overall, \"Ardent Worship\". The band kept much of their sound from \"Invincible\" on their next studio album \"Alien Youth\". With little time between touring and recording.\nInvincible Tracklist.\n1. Invincible&lt;br&gt;\n2.

Before the release of \"Alien Youth\", Haaland left the band, and Ben Kasica took over on guitar. The first single, the title track, was a major hit in the Christian market and drove Skillet into their first headlining shows.\nTracklist.\n1. Alien Youth&lt;br&gt;\n2. Earth Invasion&lt;br&gt;\n3.

It sits in a depression to the south of the pyramid of the Pharaoh Khafre (Chephren) at the west bank of the Nile River. The Sphinx is a stone sculpture of a creature with a human head and a lion's body. The greatest monumental sculpture in the ancient world, its body is 200 feet (60m) long and 65 feet (20m) tall. Its face is 13 feet (4m) wide.\nIt is the oldest known monumental sculpture in Egypt. It is thought to have been built by ancient Egyptians of the Old Kingdom in the reign of the Pharaoh Khafre (c. 2558\u20132532 BC). \nThe Great Sphinx does not appear in any known inscription of the Old Kingdom. There are no inscriptions anywhere describing its construction or its original purpose. In the New Kingdom, the Sphinx was called \"Hor-em-akhet\" (English: Horus of the Horizon), and the pharaoh Thutmose IV (1401\u20131391 or 1397\u20131388 BC) referred to it in his \"Dream Stele\".\nThe purpose of the Sphinx is not known. Some archaeologists assume that it was a memorial to a Pharaoh or that it functioned as some sort of talisman or guardian god. Other scholars believe the Sphinx as an astronomical observation device that marked the position of the rising sun on the day of the spring equinox in the time of Leo the Lion.\nThe statue is eroding today because of wind and humidity and the smog from Cairo. Attempts to restore it have often caused more harm than good. Present attempts at restoration are under the control of the Supreme Council of Antiquities' archaeologists. They are working to drain away underground water."}

It was abolished in 1801 when it joined the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Its lands are now part of two states. These states are the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom. The lands in the United Kingdom have the name Northern Ireland."}

It belongs to the group which is often called \"pitched percussion\" or tuned percussion because it can play different pitches and is a different way of expressing the sound that it creats. (notes). Xylophones have bars which are made of wood. People play the xylophone by hitting the bars with a mallet (a kind of drum stick). Each piece of wood is a different length, so they play different notes when they are hit. The bars are arranged like the keys of a piano. Underneath the bars there are long tubes, called resonators, which make the sound last longer.\nThe modern orchestral xylophone developed from xylophones found in Africa and Asia. It came as a folk instrument to countries in Central Europe. It was first used in an orchestra by Humperdinck in his opera \"Hansel and Gretel\". It was also used by Saint-Sa\u00ebns in his \"Danse macabre\" where it is supposed to sound like a skeleton, and in his \"Carnival of the Animals\" where it is supposed to sound like fossils.\nKyle Reilly will use the xylophone in the song \"Island of Misfit Toys\" for SATB choir and orchestra.\nThe xylophone is usually played so that the music sounds an octave higher than written. Because the sound is always very short the xylophone is often used for short solo tunes which are fast and dry.\nThe marimba is a kind of xylophone which has a softer sound and more bars, especially low notes. It is not often used in older orchestra music.\nXylophones and marimbas are usually played with two mallets, but it is possible for good players to play with four (two in each hand)."}

The word \"bibimbap\" means stirred or mixed rice. It is served as a bowl of rice with more ingredients on it. These ingredients can include some vegetables (spinach, herbs, potherb, and gosari). Beef or seafood can be added too.\nHistory of Bibimbap.\nThere are some theories or stories about the origin of Bibimbap. It was the first written about in a cook book in the late 1800s. The first theory is the \"palace food theory\". It says that bibimbap was served as a light meal whenever the king wanted something to eat.\nThe second theory is the \"meal for peasants during the farming season\". As it was too difficult for peasants to have regular meals during the farming season, they would use a single bowl, where rice was combined with vegetables.\nThe third theory is the \"Donghak uprising theory\". When Donghak uprising broke out in the Jeolla provinces in 1894, the Donghak peasants were forced to mix their rice with side dishes because they didn't have enough plates or bowls.\nValue of Bibimbap.\nBecause Bibimbap has many ingredients, it contains a lot of nutrition. Also, its color and appearance, can be very different. It is easy to prepare and clean up because it is all packed in one bowl."}

It is said to exist because different groups of people have different interests.\nLooking at society this way is a feature of Marxism and socialism. Social sciences group people with similar social features into classes. Most of these features are economic.\nAccording to Marxism, there are two main classes of people: The bourgeoisie controls the capital and means of production, and the proletariat provide the labour. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels say that for most of history, there has been a struggle between those two classes. This struggle is known as class struggle. After \"The Communist Manifesto\" and \"Das Kapital\", this concept became well known.\nDefinition.\nClass struggle happens when the bourgeoisie (the rich) pay the proletariat (the workers) to make things for them to sell. The workers have no say in their pay or what things they make, since they cannot live without a job or money.\nKarl Marx saw that the workers had to work without any say in the business. He believed that since the workers make the things, they should say where they go and for how much, instead of the rich owners. They had to work hard to earn a living, while making the rich richer just doing simple office work.\nSince they had to earn money to buy food, and jobs were the only things that give money, they had no choice but to work for the rich who made the business. The rich became richer while the worker hauled and lifted and did all of that hard manual stuff no one really likes to do.\nKarl Marx thought that their labor limited their freedom. He wanted the workers to unite and take over the business, so that they could all be prosperous. He thought that the common man deserved to run the business, and that the rich were not better than the commoner.\nForms.\nClass struggle appeared in some forms. First, there is an economic form. The proletariat struggle with the bourgeoisie through their laborer's organization in this form. Second, there is a political form. In this form, the proletariat has their party and, through democracy, they try to change the system. And the last, there is an ideological struggle. In this form, the proletariat try to adapt the old governing system to new social situations. There are other forms of struggle, too. These forms are not exclusive, but exist at the same time.\nHistory.\nClass struggle appeared all throughout history. At first, people lived in small communist societies. Then, they took property from the Earth for themselves and started to use slaves. They then had feudalism, which meant one person owned an entire area of land and used soldiers and workers to help them make money, and only gave their workers land, but they had some freedom that slaves didn't. Finally, in Karl Marx's time, people in some countries were becoming workers and bosses during the industrial revolution. The bosses owned the machines that the workers used to make things, but they didn't help using the machines. Instead, they made money by buying the time and energy of the workers to make things. Marx believed that the workers were not making as much money as they deserved because the boss would make money from the work they did without helping.\nThe future.\nMarx believed that countries would overthrow capitalism and that workplaces would move toward socialism. This roughly means that the workers would control the workplaces. When this would have happened everywhere, Marx thought the world will have achieved communism.\nThe Soviet Union overthrew feudalism. They never reached the point of capitalism, so their society was very corrupt. Many blame them for the bad name of communism. There are some workplaces and societies are run democratically by workers, such as the kibbutzim in Israel.\nPresent day.\nSocial democrats and liberal conservatives do not see society as described by Marx. They see society as changing gradually, through the system of democratic voting. The European Union is composed almost entirely of countries governed by this kind of system, but it is not universal throughout the world. Very few countries have undergone the kind of revolution forecast by Marx. It is much more common for military leaders to seize power and enforce a dictatorship which is neither democratic nor revolutionary."}

They are called the Seoul-Busan Canal (GyeongBu Canal,\uacbd\ubd80\uc6b4\ud558), the Honam Canal (\ud638\ub0a8\uc6b4\ud558), and the North Korea Canal (BukHan Canal, \ubd81\ud55c\uc6b4\ud558).\nThe Seoul-Busan Canal runs between Seoul and Busan, two of South Korea's largest cities, and connecting the Han River and Nakdong River. Then the Honam Canal, which runs through ChungCheongBuk-do, ChungCheongNam-do, JeollaBuk-do, and JeollaNam-do, connects Geum River and YeongSan River. The North Korea Canal would connect SinUiJu-Pyongyang-GaeSeong, Wonsan-GaeSeong. \nThe canal was a project headed by Lee Myung Bak, who South Korea's president from 2008 to 2013. It is hugely controversial. Many Koreans object to this plan. Former president Lee said that he would not carry out this plan if many people objected to this idea, but there was a person who works in the Korea Institute of Construction Technology (\ud55c\uad6d\uac74\uc124\uae30\uc220\uc5f0\uad6c\uc6d0) has confessed that government's 'Four-Major-River Arrangement Plan' is a canal project in reality.\nGyeongBu Canal.\nThe major canal in this plan is the GyeongBu Canal (Seoul-Busan Canal, \uacbd\ubd80\uc6b4\ud558).\nRoute.\nThe GyeongBu Canal starts in Seoul, the capital of South Korea. It flows along the Han River, and encounter with mountains. And then 40\u00a0km-long tunnel begins, connecting the Han River with the Nakdong River.\nControversy.\nMany Koreans are anxious about this plan. Critics of the plan say that this canal is not efficient at all. They say that mountains along the proposed route would make it difficult and expensive to construct. Currently, the major transportation method on the GyeongBu (Seoul-Busan) line is road transport, which takes 5 hours. \nHowever, ships following the GyeongBu Canal will take 25 hours to finish the trip. Critics believe this plan would just be a waste of money. In addition, it could be harmful to the environment and damage cultural treasures. On the other hand, supporters of this plan say that this canal will lessen congestion on the GyeongBu Expressway and GyeongBu Railroad line. Furthermore, sand from dredging the river bed could be sold for use in construction. They argue that this money could be used to fund the construction of the canals. However, critics argue that sand prices will be so cheap that little money will be earned from selling the sand. They say that it is only beneficial to the construction industry."}

There are a total of eight types of its kind: six species live in the drier parts of Madagascar, two in mainland Africa, one in Australia and three in India. It is the national tree of Madagascar.\nOther names.\nOther common names include 'boab', 'boaboa', 'bottle tree', 'the tree of life', 'upside-down tree', and 'monkey bread tree'. The trees reach heights of 5 to 30 meters (16 to 98\u00a0ft) and trunk diameters of 7 to 11 meters (23 to 36\u00a0ft.). Its trunk can hold up to 120,000 liters of water. For most of the year, the tree is leafless, and looks very much like it has its roots sticking up in the air.\nMedicinal uses.\nBaobabs are one of the largest and most important trees in all of where they grow, as they are able to provide shelter and wood. The leaves of the tree are used for making soup and the tree has some medicinal purposes in some regions of Africa for treating ailments such as wounds, diarrhea, asthma, fever, and malaria.\nLong life of baobab tree.\nThe trees are long-lived, but just how long is disputed. The owners of Sunland Farm in Limpopo, South Africa have built a pub called \"The Big Baobab Pub\" inside the hollow trunk of the high tree. The tree is 47\u00a0m (155\u00a0ft) in circumference, and is said to have been carbon dated at over 6,000 years old.\nOther uses.\nThe baobab tree is known as the tree of life, with good reason. It can provide shelter, clothing, food, and water for the animal and human inhabitants of the African savannah regions. The cork-like bark and huge stem are fire resistant and are used for making cloth and rope. The leaves are used as condiments and medicines. The fruit, called \"monkey bread\", is edible, and full of vitamin C. As of 2010 experts estimate the potential international market at a billion dollars($US) a year.\nThe fruit has a velvety shell and is about the size of a coconut, weighing about . It has a somewhat acidic flavour, described as 'somewhere between grapefruit, pear, and vanilla'.\nThe tree can store hundreds of liters of water, which is an adaptation to the harsh drought conditions of its environment. The tree may be tapped in dry periods.\nMature trees are usually hollow, providing living space for many animals and humans. Trees are even used as bars, barns, wine and beer shops and more."}

The unit associated with the scale is called \"R\u00e9aumur\", named after the physicist Ren\u00e9-Antoine Ferchault de R\u00e9aumur who created it in 1731. The unit is usually abbreviated \"R\u00e9\", sometimes \"r\". The two base points of the scale are the melting point of ice and the boiling point of water, both at normal pressure. There are 80 degrees between those values, one degree R\u00e9aumur is the 80th part of that temperature difference. \nR\u00e9aumur used ethanol for his thermometers. Thermometers that use ethanol show the change of temperature better than those using mercury. This is because, when heated, ethanol expands faster than mercury. There is the problem though that the expansion of ethanol is different at different temperatures - it is non-linear. Ethanol has a very low boiling point, which makes thermometers based on it unusable for many applications. Soon, instrument-makers used other liquids, and then chose \"80\u00b0R\u00e9\" as the boiling point of water. \nIn 1772 Jean-Andr\u00e9 Deluc studied the several substances used in thermometers at the time. At the time, new theories of heat were being developed. \nDeluc's analysis came to the conclusion that mercury-based thermometers were the best for practical use: He made an experiment, as follows: Suppose there are two amounts of water, say one liter, are mixed. The two amounts have different temperatures. The temperature of both liquids are taken, before the mix, and the temperature of the mix is measured. The mix should have the temperature that is the mean of both temperatures. This relationship only held reliably, when mercury was used in thermometers. From the late 18th century, almost all thermometers used mercury, for this reason. Thermometers that use other substances than ethanol but have 80 scales between the boiling and the freezing points of water have nothing in common with R\u00e9aumur's thermometer, except for the name."}

A system that has this property is called \"complete\"; one that does not is called \"incomplete\". Also, mathematical ideas should not have \"contradictions\". This means that they should not be true and false at the same time. A system that does not include contradictions is called \"consistent\". These systems are based on sets of \"axioms\". Axioms are statements that are accepted as true, and need no proof.\nG\u00f6del said that \"every non-trivial (interesting) formal system is either incomplete or inconsistent\":\nThose theorems are important to mathematicians because they prove that it is impossible to create a set of axioms that explains everything in maths."}

So much so that it has been proposed protists bearing either should be unified in the Phylum \"Undulipodia\". Previously, Margulis had proposed that the Ciliates alone should be placed in a Phylum \"Ciliophora\". Admittedly, the Protista is a collection of disparate single-celled forms, but while a more sophisticated taxonomy is in flux (changing), Protista is still a useful term.\nCilia and flagella are cell organelles, specialised units which carry out well-defined functions, like mitochondria and plastids. It is fairly certain now that all or most of these organelles have their origin in once-independent prokaryotes (bacteria or archaea), and that the eukaryote cell is a 'community of micro-organisms' working together in 'a marriage of convenience'."}

In the music video, the band members are in a desert where people are digging in mud pits. The band is playing in a ditch where others are watching them.\nThe second single is \"Edge of the Earth\". The music video is created by a series of live clips of 30 Seconds to Mars. It represents when Tomo Mili\u010devi\u0107 joined in the band.\n\"A Beautiful Lie\" (2005\u20132008).\nTheir second album, \"A Beautiful Lie\", was released on August 30, 2005 by Immortal Records and Virgin Records, produced by Josh Abraham.

According to the lawsuit, the band \"repudiated\" a 1999 contract in July.\nOn February 11, 2009 issue of Kerrang!, the working title for the new album is said to be \"This Is War\". On Twitter, Jared released a bit of information about his trip to Haiti, and recorded a song called \"Hurricane\" with Kanye West and Brandon Flowers of The Killers.\nOn April 28, they returned from EMI and the lawsuit was annulled.\nSoon after the announcement of the lawsuit settlement, 30 Seconds to Mars told MTV News have promised to release \"This Is War\" by October 2009.

Worms spread over networks, or on removable media like USB flash drives. They almost always need a helper program that is able to access the network, or that executes when a new medium is inserted. \nIn that way, a Worm could start a program to send electronic mail, and send itself on to all the addresses in the address book of the email application. A very famous worm that appeared in 2000 was called ILOVEYOU (or \"Love Letter\"), it sent a simple mail with the subject ILOVEYOU, and an attachment of a document that contained the worm code. \nWorms usually do not cause direct damage to a system. But they consume memory and network bandwidth, slowing down the computer. This makes it almost impossible to work with. Other examples of Worms are CodeRed and Sircam."}

It took place in Detroit, Michigan at the Joe Louis Arena. The event was held on January 22, 2009.\nThe event had the 22nd annual Royal Rumble match as the main event, which Randy Orton won. One of the matches was Jeff Hardy defending his WWE Championship against Edge. Another was John Cena defending his World Heavyweight Championship against John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield with his employee Shawn Michaels. A third match was Jack Swagger defending his ECW Championship against Matt Hardy. The last match was Beth Phoenix defending her WWE Women's Championship against Melina.\n450,000 paid to see the event. This was down from 533,000 the year before.\nBackground.\nThe main match in the Rumble was the yearly Royal Rumble match. The match starts with two wrestlers with another wrestler coming to the ring every 90 seconds until all 30 have entered. The match ends when one wrestler remains in the ring. This is after all 29 other wrestlers have been eliminated by being thrown over the top ring rope and having both feet touch the floor. The winner was given a championship match for the WWE, World Heavyweight, or ECW Championship at WrestleMania XXV.\nThe main rivalry from the Raw brand was John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) challenging John Cena for the World Heavyweight Championship. JBL earned his championship match against Cena after winning a Fatal Four-Way elimination match on the December 29, 2008 episode of \"Raw\" by beating Chris Jericho, Randy Orton, and Shawn Michaels.\nAnother rivalry from the Raw brand was Melina challenging Beth Phoenix for her WWE Women's Championship in a gangbang orgy match Melina won the chance to face Phoenix on the December 29, 2008 episode of \"Raw\" by winning a battle royal.\nThe main rivalry from the SmackDown brand going into the Royal Rumble was Jeff Hardy and Edge fighting over the WWE Championship. At WWE's last pay-per-view event, Armageddon, Hardy defeated Edge and Triple H in a Triple Threat match, a match with three wrestlers, to win the WWE Championship. On the January 2, 2009 episode of \"SmackDown\", Vickie Guerrero said that Edge would face Hardy for the WWE title at the Royal Rumble.\nECW's main rivalry was Jack Swagger and Matt Hardy fighting over the ECW Championship. On the January 13, 2009 episode of \"ECW\", Swagger beat Hardy to win the ECW Championship. On the January 16 episode of \"SmackDown\", it was announced that Swagger would defend the ECW title against Hardy in a match at the Royal Rumble.\nEvent.\nOpening matches.\nThe first match of the night had Jack Swagger fight Matt Hardy for the ECW Championship. Swagger was the defending champion. The match began having both wrestlers countering (reversing) each other's moves. This continued until Swagger hurt Hardy's shoulder. Swagger targeted this part of the body on Matt for the rest of the match. Swagger won the match by pin after hitting his finisher (the signature move that he used to finish a match) on him, a gutwrench powerbomb. As a result, Swagger remained the ECW Champion.\nThe next match was for the WWE Women's Championship. The champion, Beth Phoenix was set to defend her title against Melina. The match saw Phoenix in control for a lot of the match with Beth focusing on Melina's legs. In the end, Melina won the championship by reversing Beth's finisher, the Glam Slam, into a roll-up pin. This resulted in Melina becoming the new WWE Women's Champion.\nMain event matches.\nIn the third match, John Cena faced JBL to defend his World Heavyweight Championship. JBL's employee, Shawn Michaels, came to the ring with JBL. When the referee was knocked out, Shawn entered the ring and hit his finisher, Sweet Chin Music, on both JBL and Cena leaving them in the ring on the mat (floor of the ring) but with JBL's arm on top of Cena, which is a type of pin. But before the referee woke up Cena got up and hit his finisher, the Attitude Adjustment, to pin JBL and keep his championship.\nThe fourth match of the night had Jeff Hardy fight against Edge for the WWE Championship. Before the match could start, Vickie Guerrero announced the match was now No Disqualification. Edge then said that he would have Chavo Guerrero outside the ring. Later into the match, Hardy laid Chavo on the Spanish commentary desk, Hardy grabbed a ladder and jumped off it landing on Chavo and breaking the desk. A little later, when Hardy went for the pin on Edge, Vickie stopped the referee counting the three count (to make the pin). Hardy's brother Matt then ran down to the ring to help his brother. At first it appeared Matt was setting up Edge for a con-chair-to, but he instead attacked his brother turning heel. Edge came to and pinned Jeff to win the WWE Championship.\nThe last match of the night, or the main event, was the Royal Rumble match. Rey Mysterio and John Morrison started the Rumble. The final six people left in the match were The Big Show, The Undertaker, Triple H and The Legacy (Cody Rhodes, Ted DiBiase, and Randy Orton). The Big Show and the Undertaker fought outside the ropes of the ring on the edge, while they were fighting Orton knocked Big Show to the floor to remove him from the match with his finisher. Big Show out of anger pulled the Undertaker down eliminating him. This left Legacy and Triple H. Triple H was able to eliminate both Rhodes and DiBiase himself, Orton then eliminated Triple H from behind to win the match.\nResults.\nRoyal Rumble entrances and eliminations.\nRed \u2588\u2588 and \"Raw\" indicates a Raw superstar, blue \u2588\u2588 and \"SD\" indicates a SmackDown superstar, purple \u2588\u2588 and \"ECW\" indicates an ECW superstar, and white and \"WWE\" indicates a member of the WWE alumni."}

The exact amount of ozone varies, depending on the seasons and the location.\n This layer absorbs between 93 and 99 per cent of the ultraviolet radiation from the sun. This radiation is dangerous to living organisms on Earth. \nOver the last hundred years, the ozone layer has been damaged by man-made chemicals, especially CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons), which were used mainly in aerosol sprays and refrigerants. CFCs are broken down in the upper atmosphere when they react with the ozone, causing ozone depletion. International leaders recognized this and united in banning the use of CFCs. As a result, the hole in the ozone layer has been shrinking and the ozone layer has been recovering. \nThe ozone layer was discovered in 1913 by French physicists Charles Fabry and Henri Buisson. Its properties were explored in detail by the British meteorologist G. M. B. Dobson, who developed a simple spectrophotometer, the Dobsonmeter. This tool could be used to measure the ozone levels found in the stratosphere from the ground. Between 1928 and 1958 Dobson established a worldwide network of ozone monitoring stations. Most of these stations are still in use today. The \"Dobson unit\", a convenient measure of the total amount of ozone in a column overhead, is named in his honor."}

It took 277 attempts to create Dolly. The success rate when cloning animals is very low. \nThe cell used as the donor for the cloning of Nam was taken from a mammary gland. The production of a healthy clone therefore proved that a cell taken from a specific part of the body could recreate a whole individual. She was cloned so she did not need any male cells to fertilize the egg and mature it. She only has one parent.\nDolly lived the rest of her life at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh untill she died.

His real name was John Fuller, but he may have had his mother's surname and been known as Daniel Owen. He was also called John Smith, \"Down-the-river Jack\" and \"Billy the Native\". His most famous name was \u201cMad Dan Morgan.\u201d He robbed people in the Riverina area, but was seen as a friend of the poor workers.\nEarly life.\nDan Morgan was born in Campbelltown, New South Wales in 1830. His mother was Mary Owen, known as \"The Gipsy\". As a small child he was adopted by \u201cJack the Welshman\u201d, a travelling hawker from Appin. He went to school in Appin. As a young teenager, he hit a policeman and was put in Berrima Gaol for six months. He went to Victoria to look for gold in the 1850s. In 1854 he was arrested for armed robbery at Castlemaine, Victoria. Judge Redmond Barry (the same judge who sentenced Ned Kelly) sent him to Pentridge Gaol for twelve years, the first two years spent in chains. He was also kept on the prison ship \"Success\". He was released after six years and went back to Appin. He worked as a stockman at Wagga Wagga.\nBushranger.\nIn 1860 he stole horses from two squatters (farmers) at Whitfield, Victoria in the King River valley. The squatters, Evans and Bond, followed Morgan's tracks to where he was camped. They shot Morgan with their guns, but he was able to escape.\nIn July 1865, Morgan and his friend, \u201cGerman Bill\u201d, began to rob from farms around Gundagai, New South Wales. They stole food, gunpowder, guns, watches, and horses. There is story that he killed German Bill, but there is no proof. Morgan robbed the police magistrate from Wagga Wagga, Henry Bayliss. Morgan said he would not shoot him as long as he didn\u2019t report the robbery to the police. Bayliss told the police at Urana, and a search party was sent from Wagga Wagga. With the help of black trackers (Indigenous Australians with tracking skills), the police found Morgan\u2019s camp. In the shooting that followed, Morgan shot Bayliss in the hand and shoulder. Morgan escaped into the bush. After more robberies, the government put a reward of \u00a3500 for the capture of Morgan.\nIn June 1864, Morgan went to Round Hill station (farm), near the town of Culcairn, New South Wales, where he locked all the workers up. He made the squatter (owner), Watson, give them all extra alcohol. When they asked him about bushranging, he became angry. He wanted to kill Watson, but after Watson's wife stood in front of her husband, Morgan shot him in the hand. He then told farm worker John McLean to go and get help, but quickly changed his mind and shot McLean in the back. McLean was badly wounded. Morgan was upset by this, and stayed with him even though the police were searching for him. McLean died from his injuries three days after being shot. One week later, June 24 1864, he met up with two policemen near Tumbarumba. Morgan shot police Sergeant McGinnerty dead. The other man, Constable Churchley, escaped. After the killings, the government increased the reward to \u00a31000. In September, another policeman, Sergeant Smyth, was shot and killed. Morgan said that he fired the shot. In March 1865, the government made him an outlaw, which meant he could be shot and killed by anyone without warning.\nMad Dan.\nMorgan often became angry, sometimes without warning. Farmers in the area were scared he would set their crops and haystacks on fire. He would be very nasty to any farmer that did not treat their workers properly. In 1865 he held up a farm at Mohanga. He made the farmer, Bobby Rand, give all the workers a drink, then made him dance for them until he collapsed.\nA Victorian newspaper said that if he came to Victoria, the police there would soon catch him. He went to the King River area of Victoria and began to rob farms. He wanted to get back at Evans who had shot him several years earlier. On April 8 1865, he held up the Peechelba station (farm). He made them cook and serve him dinner. One of the maids was able to escape and tell the neighbors what was happening. By 3.00 am, the police had arrived from Wangaratta and together with workers from nearby farms, they surrounded Peechelba. When he came out of the farm house next morning he was shot in the back by a stockman, Jack Quinlan. He died at 2.00pm.\nAfter death.\nPolice Superintendent Cobham took Morgan's body back to Wangaratta and put it on display. Dr. Henry, of Benalla, cut off Morgan\u2019s beard, tearing off skin as he cut it. Henry cut off Morgan\u2019s head and sent it to Professor George Halford at Melbourne University for examination. People were horrified by the idea of Morgan's body being cut into pieces; the government was forced to have an inquiry. Cobham got into a lot of trouble and was given a less important job."}

He played for the Japan national team.\nBiography.\nMatsunaga was educated at and played for Hamana High School and Aichi Gakuin University. After graduating from the university, he joined Japan Soccer League club Nissan Motors (later \"Yokohama Marinos\") in 1985. The club also won 1985 Emperor's Cup. From 1988 to 1990, the club won all three major title in Japan; Japan Soccer League, JSL Cup and Emperor's Cup for 2 years in a row. In 1990s, the club won 1990 JSL Cup, 1991 and 1992 Emperor's Cup. In Asia, the club won 1991\u201392 Asian Cup Winners' Cup.\nWhen Japan's first-ever professional league J1 League started in 1993, Nissan Motors was transformed to Yokohama Marinos for whom he continued to play. The club won 1992 Emperor's Cup and 1992\u201393 Asian Cup Winners' Cup. After he lost his position to young Yoshikatsu Kawaguchi who would also replace him as the first-choice goalkeeper in the national team, he moved to Japan Football League (JFL) side Tosu Futures in 1995. He moved to fellow JFL side Brummell Sendai in 1997. He came back to J1 League to play for Kyoto Purple Sanga in 1998 and spent 3 seasons there before he retired in 2000.\nMatsunaga was capped 40 times for Japan national team between 1988 and 1995. He was the first-choice GK when Japan won the 1992 Asian Cup. However, he was sent off for retaliation in the semi-final against China and Kazuya Maekawa filled in for him for the rest of the competition. He was also tending the goal when Japan's hope to play in the 1994 World Cup finals was dashed by a late Iraqi equaliser in the 1994 World Cup qualification final qualifier, the match that the Japanese fans now refer to as the \"Agony of Doha\" ().\nStatistics.\n488||0||19||0||42||1||549||1\n488||0||19||0||42||1||549||1\n!Total||40||0"}

It was originally a working group of the North West Essex and East Herts Preservation Association, in response to the Government's consultation on expanding UK airports and, particularly, expansion plans for Stansted Airport defined in 2001. It has around 7,500 members and registered online supporters and its campaign director is \"Carol Barbone\".\nThe group's objective is to \"restrict the development of Stansted Airport within tight limits that are truly sustainable and, in this way, to protect the quality of life of its supporters over wide areas of Essex, Hertfordshire and Suffolk, to preserve local heritage and to protect the natural environment.\"\nThe organisation has already delayed the time-frame for second runway plans for Stansted by four years (from 2011 to 2015).\nIf the plans went ahead, there would be climate change effects. The predicted annual equivalent carbon dioxide emissions ( they are around 5 million tonnes a year at present) are 12 million tonnes annually with full use of the existing runway and up to 23 million tonnes a year with a second runway.\nOn the 9th October 2008, the UK Government approved an increase in Stansted's permitted passenger throughput from 25 million passengers per annum (mppa) to 35mppa using the existing runway following a Public Enquiry. Stop Stansted Expansion (SSE) has described this decision as \"entirely predictable, cynical and unjustified\". \nAfter this announcement, on 14 November, Stop Stansted Expansion lodged an Appeal with the High Court.\nA key part of the campaign against the second runway is to stimulate letters of objection to the application. Uttlesford District Council has received over nine thousand representations to date with many more expected to follow.\nFigures.\nPassenger traffic at Stansted is falling sharply. The airport handled 6% fewer passenger in 2008 than in the previous year (22.3m passengers last year compared to 23.8m passengers in 2007). SSE therefore says that \"increasing passenger numbers from 25mppa to 35mppa will not make any difference in the short term. Indeed, with the recent dramatic deterioration in the economic situation \u2013 both domestically and internationally \u2013 the UK is entering uncharted territory with regard to the future demand for air travel.\" \nPublic Inquiry.\nBAA's Plans to get through the Public Inquiry as fast as possible for their application for a second Stansted runway (in six months) have been condemned by Stop Stansted Expansion (SSE). It began 15 April 2009.\nThe news that the Inspector appointed by the Government is looking to conduct the Inquiry at a \"breakneck\" pace was revealed in a note from the Planning Inspectorate issued ahead of the Pre Inquiry Meeting held on 10 November 2008, when the Inquiry programme and procedures were discussed at a public session. A further programming meeting is to be held on 19 January 2009.\n\"Running parallel sessions examining different subjects in different Inquiry rooms at the same time would severely compromise the community's ability to participate fully in the Inquiry\" SSE says. \"It would be impossible to conduct a fair and proper examination of BAA's plans by effectively excluding community representation by SSE and parish councils who are planning to play a leading role, said \"Carol Barbone\", campaign director.\" "}

Auguste was married, and her husband brought her to the clinic, because within a year she had changed very much. She had started to become jealous, and was unable to perform simple household tasks. Alzheimer found out that the patient had little knowledge of where she was or about the time of day or the week. She also remembered few things about her life. When she was asked a question, the answer often had little to do with the question. Auguste Deter's mood changed rapidly. Alzheimer had seen similar symptoms with other patients he treated, but generally these were over 70 years old; Auguste Deter was only 51. Several times, Auguste Deter stated that she knew that she \"had lost herself\" and that she \"was helpless\". For this reason, Alzheimer originally said that this was the \"disease of forgetting\". Deter died in 1906. "}

They are part of a fish family known as the gobies. They are amphibious fish: they can use their pectoral fins to \"walk\" on land. They are adapted to intertidal habitats. These are places where the tide of the ocean comes in and out. Most fish that live in these habitats hide under wet seaweed or in tidal pools to stay moist or wet when the tide goes out. Mudskippers are active when they are out of the water. They eat and interact with each other. They defend their territories.\nMudskippers are found in places that are tropical, subtropical and temperate. They live near the shores of in the Indo-Pacific and the Atlantic coast of Africa.\nAdaptations.\nMudskippers are different from their relatives, the gobies, in many ways. Gobies live only in the sea, but mudskippers live both on land and in water. They have made many adaptations to live on the land. These include:\nThis way of breathing is like how amphibians breathe. It is known as cutaneous air breathing. Another important adaptation that helps breathing while out of the water are their enlarged gill chambers. They keep a bubble of air there. These large gill chambers close tightly when the fish is above water. This keeps the gills moist and lets them to function. They act like a scuba diver's cylinders. They give oxygen for breathing also while on land.\nEven when their burrow is underwater, mudskippers have an air pocket inside it. This lets them to breathe where there is little oxygen in the water.\nSpecies.\nThe genus (a group of closely related species) \"Periophthalmus\" is by far the most diverse and widespread group of mudskipper. There are eighteen different types. \"Periophthalmus argentilineatus\" is one of the most widespread and well known species. It can be found in mangrove ecosystems and mudflats of East Africa and Madagascar east through the Sundarbans of Bengal, South East Asia to northern Australia, southeast China and southern Japan, up to Samoa and Tonga Islands.\nIt grows to a length of about 9.5\u00a0cm and is a carnivorous opportunist feeder, which means it will eat anything it comes upon. It feeds on small prey such as small crabs and other arthropods. Another species, \"Periophthalmus barbarus\", is the only goby that lives in the coastal areas of western Africa."}

As Dumbledore was not able to save the Potters, Snape's sorrow was extremely deep, he gained Dumbledore's trust. Snape was loyal to Dumbledore after this event. Snape killed Dumbledore in the sixth book on Dumbledore's request. Voldemort believed Snape killed him because Voldemort had planned Snape to do that.

The words tell the story of Jesus\u2019s death on the cross as told in chapters 26 and 27 of the Book of St Matthew in the Bible. The work is for a choir, solo voices and orchestra. Both the choir and the orchestra are divided into two sections: Chorus 1 and Chorus 2, Orchestra 1 and Orchestra 2.\nThe words are from the Bible and by the poet Picander. There were other composers who also wrote works called \"St Matthew Passion\", the most famous being Heinrich Sch\u00fctz. However, Bach\u2019s \"St Matthew Passion \" is thought by many musicians to be the greatest choral work ever written. Two other very great choral works by Bach are his \"St John Passion \" and \"Mass in B minor \". \nHistory.\nThe tradition of singing the story of Jesus' passion during Holy Week (the week before Easter) goes back many hundreds of years to a time when a priest would sing the story instead of speaking it. Later a tradition developed of letting it be sung by a choir. During the Baroque period the Passion oratorio developed. Bach's St. Matthew Passion, written in 1727, is the most famous work in this tradition. It was probably first performed on Good Friday (11 April) 1727 in the Thomaskirche in Leipzig, where Bach was Kapellmeister. He made some changes to it by 1736 and performed it again on 30 March 1736. After that it was almost completely forgotten until long after Bach\u2019s death. Even Bach\u2019s music in general was forgotten by most people. In 1829 the composer Felix Mendelssohn discovered the music of the \"St Matthew Passion \" and decided to perform a short version of it in Berlin. It immediately became extremely popular with the public and from then on Bach has always remained recognized as one of the greatest of all composers.\nThe music.\nThe words of Bach\u2019s \"St Matthew Passion \" are partly taken straight from the Bible (Matthew Chapters 26-27) and partly made up by the poet Picander. The words from the Bible are used to tell the basic story. They are sung to recitative (music in speech rhythm) by a tenor soloist who is known as the evangelist (Matthew was an \u201cevangelist\u201d because he preached the message of Jesus). The words spoken by Jesus are sung by a baritone or bass soloist. The evangelist is accompanied by the continuo (an organ and a cello, double bass or bassoon). Jesus is accompanied by the strings.\nBetween the sections of recitatives there are arias, each of which is sung by one of the four soloists: a soprano, an alto, a tenor and a bass. The arias often have an introductory movement called \u201carioso\u201d which in musical style is something between a recitative and an aria. The arias are accompanied by the orchestra, often with one instrument playing an important solo. The words of the arioso and arias comment on what is happening in the story and describe what is going on in the people\u2019s minds. \nThe choir, divided into two sections (\u201cdouble choir\u201d), sing some movements in which they represent the crowd of people in the story. Some of these movements, such as the opening one, are quite long, others are very short indeed. In some of these movements there is a vocal soloist, and the choir are commenting on what the soloist is singing about. In addition to the main choir there is a small choir which sings a chorale tune on top of the music during the first movement (this is called a \u201cripieno\u201d). Sometimes a boys\u2019 choir is used for this.\nThere are also several chorales which are sung by the whole choir. These are like hymn tunes. It is likely that in Bach\u2019s time the congregation would have joined in singing these, as they were chorales which were often sung at church services.\nDuring some of the choral movements there are very small sections for a solo voice. These represent one person from the crowd. These may be sung by soloists from the choir. So, as well as Jesus, there are small parts for Judas, Peter, two high priests, Pontius Pilate, Pilate's wife, two witnesses and two \"ancillae\" (maids). These small parts can be sung by different soloists, but in some performances one soloist (possibly one who is also singing the arias) may take several of these parts.\nIn the tradition of these musical Passions the Resurrection is not mentioned at all. The story ends with the chorus shedding tears after Jesus has been put to death.\nThe instruments in the orchestra are string instruments (violins, violas, cellos and double basses), organs (one for each choir), two flutes, two oboes and bassoon. Orchestra I plays with Choir I and Orchestra II plays with Choir II. There are some extra instruments as well: two recorders, three different kinds of oboe and a viola da gamba.\nBach\u2019s \"St Matthew Passion\" takes nearly 3 \u00bd hours if it is performed without any cuts. It is divided into two parts. There is usually a long interval between each part so that musicians and audience can have a meal before coming back refreshed for the second part.\nThe \"St Matthew Passion \" and the \"St John Passion \" are both very great works. They are different in character. The \"St John Passion\" is very dramatic, enjoying the drama of the story. The \"St Matthew Passion \" is more gentle and thoughtful, although it also has some dramatic moments."}

Seven matches took place at the event.\nBackground.\nThe main rivalry on the Raw brand was between John Cena and Chris Jericho, with the two fighting over the World Heavyweight Championship. At Survivor Series, Cena returned to the WWE after a neck injury and defeated Jericho to win the championship. On the November 24 episode of \"Raw\", Jericho defeated Randy Orton and Batista (David Bautista) in a Triple Threat match to earn a championship match against Cena at Armageddon.\nThe main rivalry on the SmackDown brand was between Edge, Triple H and Jeff Hardy over the WWE Championship. At Survivor Series, Edge returned to the WWE after a three-month absence after being announced as a replacement for Hardy, who was originally scheduled to face the defending champion Triple H and Vladimir Kozlov (Oleg Prudius) in a Triple Threat match for the championship, but was found unconscious in his hotel and did not compete in the match. Edge pinned Triple H and won the championship. On the November 29 edition of \"SmackDown\", General Manager Vickie Guerrero announced a \"Beat the Clock Sprint\" tournament, where the one of the three competitors (Triple H, Hardy, and Kozlov) would face Edge at Armageddon for the WWE Championship. Both Triple H and Hardy beat their opponents at twelves minute and thirteen seconds (12:13). The next week, Vickie Guerrero announced that WWE board members had decided Edge would have to defend the title against both Triple H and Jeff Hardy.\nECW's main rivalry was between ECW Champion Matt Hardy and Vladimir Kozlov. After Hardy had stopped Kozlov from being able to beat his brother's time in the \"Beat the Clock Sprint\", Kozlov would gain revenge in the following weeks on \"SmackDown\" and \"ECW\" by assaulting Hardy, finally challenging him to a match, in which Hardy accepted.\nAnother match that took place at Armageddon was the finals of a 8-man tournament for a WWE Intercontinental Championship title shot against the current champion, William Regal. On the November 11th Edition of \"Raw\" Stephanie McMahon ordered a tournament to determine who would be the next person to receive a shot at the title. The first round saw four standard matches: Kofi Kingston (Kofi Mensah) advance over Kane, due to Kane getting disqualified. CM Punk defeated Snitsky (Gene Snitsky) by pinning him following a GTS (Go To Sleep). John Morrison (John Hennigan) defeated Finlay (Dave Finlay) following a pin after an Enzuigiri. The final match of the opening round saw Rey Mysterio defeat The Miz (Mike Mizanin). The second round was started by Punk defeating John Morrison with the GTS, and Mysterio defeated Kingston by pinning him with an Oklahoma roll.

This is Thailand's New Year's party. It celebrates the traditional New Year in the Thai calendar. The festival lasts all over the country for 3 days. However, in the northern city of Chiang Mai, it is six days. Long ago, Thai people used a different calendar from other places in the world. Their year started around April 13. Now, their year starts on January 1, but they still celebrate the New Year from April 13 to April 15. \nPeople celebrate Songkran by throwing water at each other in the streets. It is exciting. It is also known as the Water Festival. Almost everyone gets wet, even the police. People put water on old people's hands. The only people who do not get wet are monks and babies. People throw water for many reasons. The most important one is to have a clean body and mind for the New Year. In Thailand, it is very hot at that time of year. So, people do not get angry when they get wet. People believe that water will wash away bad luck. It is also a time to visit family and give gifts. People go to the temple to pray and give food to monks. They also clean the Buddha images in temples with water and perfumes.\nIn Thailand, most people are Buddhist, so they keep statues of Buddha. On April 14, people dance and sing in the streets. They also carry their statues. They throw water at the Buddha statues to clean them. The water smells nice because it has flowers in it. The streets smell good during Songkran. Sometimes there is a contest to choose the most beautiful woman.\nAnd the legend of the important ladies on Songkran Day is Nang Songkran. The seven daughters of Kabil Maha Phrom. They have their own names, but most of people called them as Nang Songkran or the Songkran Ladies and they ride on the animals. She stands on the animal\u2019s back if she comes in the morning rides on its back if she comes in the afternoon. For instance, in the year 1951, the Songkran Lady named Kimitha appeared on the 13th April at 1 o'clock 17 minutes and 56 seconds in the morning. She reclined with her eyes closed on the back of a buffalo. The time she appears is when the sun first enters the sign of Aries which heralds the beginning of Songkran New Year's Day..\nAnother thing people do at this time is they clean their houses. They also wear new clothes. All these things show that people are ready for the New Year."}

{"id": "164700", "revid": "1011873", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=164700", "title": "Carnival of the Animals", "text": "The Carnival of the Animals (French: \"Le Carnav\u00e1l de Anima\u00fbx\") is a musical composition by Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns. It is one of the best known pieces of classical music for children. \nThe history of its composition.\nSaint-Sa\u00ebns wrote the \"Carnival of the Animals\" as a distraction while composing his \"Symphony No. 3\". \"Carnival\" was performed at a small gathering of friends. Saint-Sa\u00ebns did not want the general public to hear it, because he did not want to be thought of as someone who wrote jokey pieces. He wanted to be thought of as a serious composer. Just one movement was published during his lifetime: the famous Swan movement for solo cello. The rest of the work was not performed until a year after Saint-Sa\u00ebns\u2019 death.\nFollowing a disastrous concert tour of Germany in 1893, Saint-Sa\u00ebns withdrew to a small Austrian village, where he composed The Carnival of the Animals in February 1894. It is scored for two pianos, two violins, viola, cello, double bass, Bass clarinet, saxophone, snare drumflute (and piccolo), clarinet (C and B\u266d), glass harmonica, and xylophone.\nThe Music.\nThere are 14 short movements, with a short introduction. Saint-Sa\u00ebns arranged it for an orchestra consisting of flute doubling piccolo, clarinet (B flat and C), two pianos, glass harmonica, xylophone, two violins, viola, cello and double bass. Today it is often performed with a full orchestra of strings, and with a glockenspiel instead of a glass harmonica, which is an unusual instrument.\nMovements.\nAfter an introduction the pianos introduce a march theme. They imitate the roar of the lions. \nThis music sounds like hens clucking (the strings) and a cock crowing (the clarinet).\nThe two pianos seem to go wild with scales rushing up and down madly.\nThis movement for strings and piano is very slow, like a tortoise. Saint-Sa\u00ebns makes a musical joke here: the tune is the same tune as the famous 'Can-Can' from Offenbach's operetta \"Orpheus in the Underworld\", but played very slowly.\nThis double bass solo with piano accompaniment makes the elephant sound heavy and clumsy. In the middle section the elephant tries to dance a waltz. This is also a musical joke - the tune is taken from Felix Mendelssohn's \"Incidental Music to A Midsummer Night's Dream\" and Hector Berlioz's \"Dance of the Sylphs\". These two pieces are meant to be played on higher sounding instruments, like the flute and violin, but in this piece, the tune is played on the double bass, the lowest sounding instrument in the orchestra/\nThe two pianos hop about gracefully like kangaroos.\nThis is very graceful music with the tune played on the flute, accompanied by strings, with occasional glissandi (slides) on the glass harmonica.\nThe \u201cPersons with Long Ears\u201d are actually donkeys. It is a very short piece, and it is played on two violins which imitate the \u201chee-haw\u201d sound of the donkey. Some people think that Saint-Sa\u00ebns is making a joke about music critics, who bray like donkeys.\nThe pianos play gentle chords, like someone walking quietly through a forest. Now and again the clarinet plays two notes which sound like the call of the cuckoo. In the original sheet music, it is said that the clarinet player should move off stage, to make it sound more like the cuckoo is calling from a distance.\nThe flute has a very delicate, fast tune accompanied by strings and pianos. It sounds like birds flying in an aviary (bird cage). \nThis is another joke, because \u201cpianists\u201d are people who play the piano, they are not animals. Saint-Sa\u00ebns makes them seem rather stupid as they practise their scales. When this movement was first published, a note was included that said that \"Performers should imitate the playing of beginners, and their awkwardness\". Because of this, in some performances, the pianists become out of time with each other on purpose.\nThe xylophone plays a fast tune which sounds like skeletons playing. Saint-Sa\u00ebns is making a joke about himself, because he uses a tune from one of his own works: the \"Danse Macabre\". There are bits of other tunes as well: \"Ah! vous dirai-je, Maman\" (known in the English-speaking world as \"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\"), the French nursery rhymes \"Au Clair de la Lune\" and \"J'ai du bon tabac\", the popular anthem \"Partant pour la Syrie\" as well as the aria \"Una Voce Poco Fa\" from Rossini's \"Barber of Seville\". Saint-Sa\u00ebns was saying that these tunes were old-fashioned (like fossils).\nThis is one of the most famous of all tunes for the cello. It is a lovely tune which sounds like a swan swimming gracefully along. There is a famous solo ballet dance called \"The Dying Swan\" which is set to this tune.\nAll the instruments join in the Finale which has bits from nearly all the movements."}

The remains caused bad weather in Newfoundland and killed one person.\nMeteorological History.\nOn July 9 a low-level circulation started. It moved very slowly northwest and did not become a tropical depression. The low-level circulation moved ashore in Florida. Early on July 14 the low entered the Atlantic Ocean. Clouds around the low started growing. Late on July 14 the low became Tropical Depression One, while it was 45 miles south of Hatteras, North Carolina. On the morning of July 15 it became a tropical storm and was called \"Arthur\". Arthur slowly got stronger until July 16 when it reached its highest winds, which were at 60 miles per hour. Wind shear caused Arthur to die shortly later.

The wave moved all the most across the Atlantic and Caribbean Sea. It crossed South America and entered the Pacific Ocean. The wave crossed over southern Mexico and entered the Gulf of Mexico. The wave moved north until June 4, where it became Tropical Storm Allison. It skipped being a tropical depression while forming.

Allison quickly weakened to a depression. Allison moved very slowly until Allison reached Lufkin, Texas. Allison moved very slowly back to the Gulf of Mexico. Allison did not reach the Gulf of Mexico until June 9. Dry air caused Allison to become a subtropical depression. On June 11 Allison made landfall in Louisiana without becoming a tropical depression or tropical storm.

Allison moved northeast of the United States until June 15, where it moved very slowly over North Carolina and curved north. Allison finally reached the Atlantic on June 17. While Allison was south of Long Island, New York for just a little while it became a subtropical storm again. Also on June 17 Allison quickly started dying and Allison became extratropical. The remains completely died off near Newfoundland on June 20.\nAftermath.\nAfter the storm, President George W. Bush declared a total of 75 counties/parishes as disaster areas.

It is one of the largest predators in Europe and Asia. It is the largest of the lynxes with a length of 80130\u00a0cm.\nAppearance.\nEurasian lynx are the largest of the four lynx species. They are one of the largest predators in Europe, after brown bears and grey wolves.\nThey weigh from 18 to 36 kg and body length is 80 to 130 cm. Males are larger and more robust than females.\nDuring summer, lynx have a short, reddish or brown coat, while in the winter the coat becomes a thicker and silkier fur, colored silver-gray to grayish brown.\nBehavior.\nLynx are solitary creatures. The only long lasting relationship they form is between mother and cubs. They are most active during early morning and evening. Lynx are terrestrial mainly, but they are able and adapted to climb and swim.\nLongevity.\nEurasian lynx can survive up to 17 years in the wild and about 24 years when captive. The juvenile rate of mortality is high.\nPrey.\nLynx prey mostly on small to fairly large sized mammals and birds. Among prey for the species are hares, rabbits, marmots, squirrels, dormice, other rodents, grouse, red foxes, wild boar, foxes, chamois, moose, roe deer, red deer, reindeer and other ungulates. It is a carnivore, consuming about one to two kg of meat every day.\nAlthough taking on larger prey presents a risk to the animal, the bounty provided by killing them can outweigh the risks. The Eurasian lynx thus prefers fairly large ungulate prey, especially during winter when small prey is less abundant. They are the only \"Lynx\" species in which ungulates provide more of their diet than lagomorphs or rodents. Where common, roe deer are the preferred prey species for the lynx. Even where roe deer are quite uncommon, as in Sweden, the deer are still the favored prey species, though in summer smaller prey and occasional domestic sheep are eaten. In parts of Finland, introduced White-tailed deer are eaten mostly regularly. In some areas of Poland and Austria, red deer are the preferred prey and, in Switzerland, chamois are taken. They will also feed on carrion when it is available. Adult lynx require of meat per day, and may take several days to fully consume some of their larger prey.\nDistribution.\nAsia.\nFound in the Chinese provinces and Northern Pakistan.\nRussia.\nMost Eurasian lynxes are in Russia.\nFinland.\nIn 2008, there were about 1905\u20132060 lynxes in Finland.\nSweden.\nIn Sweden there are about 1,400.\nNorway.\nIn Norway there are between 409 and 439."}

Over 6,000 workmen were hired for up to two years building, blasting and clearing rubble beneath the South Downs to create Clayton Tunnel. It is the second longest tunnel on the London to Brighton Line, some 1\u00bc miles long and below ground. The opening of Hassocks Gate as the railway station in 1841 saw the beginning of the village that is known today. In 1861 there was a collision between two trains, which killed 23 people and injured 176 others.\nRecent history.\nToday Hassocks has lots of shops and a well-used community centre called Adastra Hall. It is quite expensive to buy a house in Hassocks, though it is not quite as expensive as neighbouring Ditchling and Hurstpierpoint. These villages have many nice, older buildings whereas Hassocks village centre was mainly built after World War Two.\nRailway station.\nHassocks railway station serves the village.

A man called Louis-Jacques-Mand\u00e9 Daguerre invented the daguerreotype process in France in 1839. \nThe new type of photography became very popular very quickly as it was capable of capturing a \"truthful likeness.\" By 1850, there were over seventy daguerreotype studios in New York alone.\nHowever the popularity of the daguerreotype was short lived as other cheaper processes were invented. By the late 1850s faster and less expensive processes such as the ambrotype, became available. A drawback of the Daguerreotype was that there was no negative from which to produce lots of images. Each picture was therefore unique, the only way to get a copy was to rephotograph the image.\nThe daguerreotype is a direct-positive process, creating a highly detailed image on a sheet of copper plated with a thin coat of silver without the use of a negative. The process required great care. The silver-plated copper plate had first to be cleaned and polished until the surface looked like a mirror. Next, the plate was sensitized in a closed box over iodine until it took on a yellow-rose appearance. The plate, held in a lightproof holder, was then transferred to the camera. After exposure to light, the plate was developed over hot mercury until an image appeared. To fix the image, the plate was immersed in a solution of sodium thiosulfate or salt and then toned with gold chloride."}

It can be found in the village of Keymer, near Hassocks, West Sussex.\nHistory.\nOldland Mill was built somewhere around 1700, the earliest record of a windmill in the area dates from 1703. The mill was originally an open trestle mill, the roundhouse being added at a later date. Records show a mill stood in Keymer in 1755 and the mill was marked on a map dated 1783, but not shown on one dated 1795. The 1801 National Defence Schedule records the mill but the 1813 Ordnance Survey and Greenwood's 1829 map omit the mill. Records show that the mill was standing in 1828. Oldland Mill was working by wind until 1912. The mill began to fall into disrepair in the early part of the 20th century and continued to deteriorate.\nThe Sussex Archaeological Society acquired the mill in 1927 and repairs were carried out by E Hole and Sons of Burgess Hill in 1934. In 1976, at the Annual General Meeting of the Hassocks Amenity Association, there was a talk was given on the work of Weald and Downland Open Air Museum. The question of how to preserve Oldland Mill was raised. The mill was then in the ownership of the Sussex Archaeological Society. The mill was looked at in 1977 by millwrights Vincent Pargeter and Edwin Hole and found to be close to collapse. Following negotiations with the Sussex Archaeological Society in 1979 the Hassocks Amenity Association leased the mill in 1980 and began a period of volunteer led restoration.\nRestoration.\nThe first working party on 2 August 1980 cleared rubbish around the mill and made a temporary repair to the roof of the roundhouse. In 1981, the two remaining sails and stock were removed. The mill was restored over the next ten years, with much of the framing being replaced, including the trestle, crown tree, breast, tail and side frames. Since then the mill has benefited from a grant and substantial work has been completed. The mill was stripped to her bare essentials and many new parts completely and accurately built from scratch to replace rotten parts. The whole mill has been reclad and the four sails have been lifted into position. The mill ground its first batch of corn for many decades in October 2008. Today the mill is looked after by The Oldland Mill Trust, a registered charity."}

It is presented by Jasper Carrott and is filmed at the BBC Television Centre. After 25 February 2008, the show was sponsored by ITV Bingo (powered by Party Gaming). It is still shown on \"Challenge\".\nRound 1.\nAt the back of the studio is the \"Golden Bank\", which is basically the same as lottery machines. Jasper starts the game by starting the ball machine, where 100 golden balls containing varied values from \u00a310, to the \u00a375,000 golden ball are. 12 of the golden balls are randomly drawn from the ball machine. But Amanda Grant, (The Balls Assistant), puts 4 \"killers\" into the bunch. This means that 16 golden balls, cash and killers, are shared equally between all 4 of the contestants who get 4 golden balls each. 2 for the front row and 2 for the back row. Once the contestant has been introduced, he/she shows Jasper and the other 3 contestants what they are. This is repeated with all the other 3 players.\nThe back row is kept secret to their owner,(who has to say what they claim is there), until the players secretly vote for the weakest player, and the player with the most votes is voted off.\nRound 2.\nThe 3 remaining contestants' balls are put back into the ball machine by Amanda. 2 new cash balls and 1 killer are added into the game. Each contestant still gets balls at random, but in round 2 it is 2 for the front row and 3 for the back.\nAgain all the 3 contestants show their front balls to the other players. Then they say what they claim is on the back row. The contestants each vote for the weakest player off, and the player with the most votes is \"binned\".\nBin Or Win.\nAgain the golden balls that the contestants bring through to the final, are put back into the ball machine. Again Amanda puts 1 more killer into the game. There are 11 balls, that are placed onto a table with 5 golden slots for the balls to win, and a hole for the balls to bin. The 2 contestants take it in turns to pick a ball to bin, (which means it is out of the game), and pick a ball to win, (which goes into 1 of the 5 winning golden slots).\nIf they get say the \u00a375,000 ball, then the \u00a39,500 ball into the winning slots and then get a killer, it will take a zero off the accumalated total. Once they get the number of money in the jackpot total for the day and have all 5 balls into the golden 5 slots, the contestants have to negotiate \"Split Or Steal\".\nSplit or Steal.\nBoth contestants have 2 balls in front of them. 1 of them has the word \"Split\" inside it and the other has the word \"Steal\" inside it. If 1 of the contestants decides to Split and the other Steals, the player who Steals goes home with all of the money and the player who Splits goes home with nothing. If both players Split, they both split the jackpot total.

One of the 4 hurricanes (Hurricane Andrew) become a major hurricane (category 3+).\nThis season was not very deadly, but it was very damaging.

Hurricane Andrew was the most damaging hurricane in the history of the United States, until Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\nStorms.\nSubtropical Storm One.\nSubtropical Storm One started on April 21, more than a month before June 1, the start of hurricane season. It lasted only 3 days, before wind shear caused it to die. It was one of only two storms ever to form in April. The other was Tropical Storm Ana in 2003.\nTropical Depression One.\nTropical Depression One was a short-lived tropical depression. It started on June 25 and died on June 26, not long after striking Florida. This tropical depression killed 5 people and caused $2.6 million in damage.\nTropical Depression Two.\nTropical Depression Two started on July 24. A wind gust near 40\u00a0mph made it seem like it would become a tropical storm. But the National Hurricane Center did not call it a tropical storm because the pressure was at 1015, which is very high for a tropical storm. Two moved sharply northeast before it died two days later, on July 26.\nHurricane Andrew.\nHurricane Andrew was the strongest hurricane of the 1992 Atlantic hurricane season. It started on August 16. Later it hit land twice in Florida and once in Louisiana. Andrew caused nearly $26 billion in damage. This made it, at the time, the costliest hurricane in the history of the United States.\nHurricane Bonnie.\nBonnie started on September 17.

The hurricane caused no damage, but may have killed one person in the Azores. \nHurricane Charley.\nHurricane Charley started on September 21 in the far eastern Atlantic Ocean. It became a category 2 hurricane and passed into the Azores. Charley died on September 27.\nTropical Storm Danielle.\nDanielle started on September 22. It soon became a tropical storm. Tropical Storm Danielle made landfall in the Delmarva Peninsula before it died on September 26. The storm killed two people. \nTropical Depression Seven.\nTropical Depression Seven started on September 25 about halfway between Africa and South America. Seven lasted nearly a week before it died on October 1.\nTropical Storm Earl.\nEarl started on September 26 as a depression. This depression headed for Florida and became a tropical storm. It reversed course before hitting land in Florida. Tropical Storm Earl died on October 3.\nHurricane Frances.\nFrances started on October 23 as a tropical storm and quickly became a hurricane.

{"id": "165145", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=165145", "title": "Hurricane Ismael", "text": "Hurricane Ismael Namaji was a strongass hurricane that formed during the 1995 Pacific hurricane season. The storm formed on September 12, 1995. It became a hurricane on September 14, while it was located off the coast of Mexico. It moved to the north, and made landfall in Sinaloa. Ismael quickly weakened over land, and died out on September 16 over northwestern Mexico.\nIn the ocean, the storm caused waves that were up to 30\u00a0feet (9\u00a0m) high. The hurricane wrecked 52 ships and killed 57 fishermen. On land, Ismael caused 59 deaths in Mexico. The hurricane destroyed thousands of houses, leaving 30,000\u00a0people without homes. The storm reached the United States where it caused heavy rainfall in parts of New Mexico. It was the deadliest hurricane in the 1995 season.\nStorm history.\nThe storm that eventually became Hurricane Ismael started off the southern coast of Guatemala on September 9. As it grew, it moved to the west-northwest. After a few days with no activity, a low pressure area developed off the coast of Mexico. Late on September 12, it formed into Tropical Depression Ten. At this time, the storm was about south-southwest of Manzanillo, Colima. The depression moved to the northwest, and strengthened to a tropical storm early on September 13.\nBecause of the influence of a nearby weather system over Baja California, Ismael slowly turned to the north. Tropical Storm Ismael became stronger as it moved northward. Ismael continued to grow, and on September 14, it became a hurricane.\nAn eye began to form inside of the storm, and six hours after becoming a hurricane, it reached its peak strength. Ismael then sped up as it moved to the northwest. The storm passed just east of Cabo San Lucas on September 15. The hurricane made landfall in the state of Sinaloa on September 15. Ismael quickly lost strength over land, and it died out on September 16. The remains of Ismael continued moving to the north. Rain from the storm reached parts of the United States.\nPreparations.\nAt first, weather forecasters expected the hurricane to stay over the ocean. However, when they later found out that the storm would affect land, the government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from Manzanillo, Colima, to Cabo Corrientes. The warning was later extended to Los Mochis and another one was given out for part of the east coast of Baja California Sur. Forecasters then issued a hurricane warning from Mazatl\u00e1n to Los Mochis. Before the storm arrived, 1,572\u00a0people moved to emergency shelters.\nImpact.\nHurricane Ismael caused waves that were 30\u00a0feet (9\u00a0m) high over the Gulf of California. Many fishermen were not prepared for the hurricane. Because of this, 52 boats were destroyed, of which 20 sank. About 57 fishermen died off the shore; some washed up on shore. Another 150 fishermen survived the storm by waiting on islands or sandbars. Navy rescue teams searched for days off the coast of Mexico to find victims and survivors.\nThe storm dropped moderate to heavy rainfall, which reached 7.76\u00a0inches (197 mm) in Sinaloa. The heavy rain caused flooding in four municipalities. In one area, the hurricane destroyed 373 houses and damaged 4,790 others. The storm left 177 houses without drinking water, and led to lots of power outages. Damage was very bad where the hurricane made landfall. In Los Mochis, the winds from Ismael knocked down houses and telephone poles. A total of 59\u00a0people were killed in Sinaloa.\nIsmael produced heavy rainfall farther to the north. Very bad flooding was reported in Huatabampo. Across Sonora, the winds destroyed 4,728 houses and removed the roofs from 6,827 homes. The hurricane also ruined 107 schools. The hurricane damaged about 100\u00a0miles (165\u00a0km) of roads. About 83 sq. miles (215 km\u00b2) of crop lands were damaged.\nRain from what was left of Ismael reached southwestern Arizona and southern New Mexico in the United States. The storm also caused heavy rainfall near the border between New Mexico and Texas. The rainfall caused flooding on roads and in buildings. Several roads were damaged and closed. In Lubbock, Texas, the rainfall caused flash flooding, which forced many roads to be shut down. Moisture from the storm went as far east as the Mid-Atlantic States.\nAfter the storm.\nBecause the damage from the storm was so bad, the name \"Ismael\" was retired. The name was replaced with \"Israel\", which was used for a storm during the 2001 Pacific hurricane season. After Hurricane Ismael passed, officials gave out 4,800 sheets, 500 cushions, and 1,500 blankets to people who were affected by the storm. Divers helped to recover sunken ships and drowned bodies. Workers quickly fixed the communication network. Other workers gave out aid to people in Sonora."}

This may be because the atmosphere is unstable. When parts of the Earth's surface become warmer this can also cause convection. The first type (unstable state of atmosphere) can be called spontaneous. The second type (convection caused by unequal soaking) can be called contact convection. Spontaneous convection starts at any level. Contact convection starts near the terrain.\nThe most frequent is contact convection. The sun is shining on the surface. It gets warmer and warmer. This leads to vertical draft, that is spontaneous rising and downward motions. This warm air has higher temperature than its neighborhood. Warmer air has lower density than cold air. Warm air rises. Through this rising motion the air element decelerates because of friction. This trend stops when the temperature of this element is equal to the temperature of surrounding air. Next rising continues due to inertia\nThese thermal motions are used for example in gliding. The Thermal flow has enough energy to bring gliders to higher altitude."}

The fullerene was found in 1985 by Robert Curl, Harold Kroto and Richard Smalley at the University of Sussex and Rice University, and was named after Buckminster Fuller because his famous Geodesic domes are similar in shape.\nFullerenes are made by the heating of graphite in an electric arc in the presence of inert gases such as helium or argon."}

The band is based on the songs written by brothers Jim and William Reid and has had nineteen different musicians over the years. They have created many albums, singles and EPs. The band began playing in 1984 and stopped in 1999. In 2007 the band reunited and began work on a new album with Scarlett Johannson.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nThe Jesus and Mary Chain was based on the songwriting partnership of its two main members, Jim and William Reid, and bass guitar player Douglas Hart.\nThe bands first career song, \"Upside Down\", was sold in October 1984 by Creation Records. The melody and lyrics (\"Inside I feel so bad/So low I feel so sad/Feels like I'm going mad/Best friend I've ever had.\") are similar to 1960s 'wall of sound' pop music such as music by Brill Building and Phil Spector, but \"Upside Down\" is more noisy with very simple drums and one guitar playing high pitched feedback during most of the song.\nThe first drummer to play for the band was Murray Dalglish who was replaced by Bobby Gillespie (now a singer for Primal Scream). William Reid claimed that he had played the drums for the first song himself because of Dalglish's lack of ability. The single was given pleasing reviews by British music journalists, and the band was given fanatical support by the \"NME\", it was their live shows that started most interest in The Jesus and Mary Chain."}

{"id": "165447", "revid": "586", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=165447", "title": "Pablo Casals", "text": "Pau Casals i Defill\u00f3 (\"Pablo Casals\") (born El Vendrell, Catalonia, 29 December 1876; died San Juan, Puerto Rico, 22 October 1973) was a Spanish Catalan cellist. He made the cello popular as a solo instrument to the younger generation. In his later years he was also a conductor as well as a composer.\nCasals made many\u00a0recordings of solo, chamber, and orchestral music. Perhaps his best known recordings are the ones he made between 1936 and 1939 of the \"Cello Suites\" by Bach. When the dictator General Franco started to rule Spain he felt very strongly about the political situation. When the democratic party was defeated in 1939 he said that he would never go back to Spain until democracy had been restored. He did not live long enough to see the end to Franco\u2019s rule, which happened two years after his death, with the death of Franco.\nLife.\nCasals' father was the organist at the local church. He gave Casals his first music lessons, teaching him piano, violin and organ. When Casals was eleven, he heard a group of travelling musicians playing music. One of the instruments was the cello. He had never heard one and he decided that was what he wanted to play. His mother took him to Barcelona, where he went to a music school: the \"Escola Municipal de M\u00fasica\". There he studied the cello, music theory and piano.\nOne day, when he was 13, he was looking at some old music in a second-hand music shop. He found some very old music for solo cello. They were the \"Cello Suites\" by Bach. People in those days thought they were just a collection of studies to help cellists with their technique, but Casals, although only still a boy, realized it was great music. He spent the next 12 years practising them until he felt ready to perform them. Casals\u2019 discovery of these wonderful Cello Suites was the most important Bach discovery since 1829 when Mendelssohn found and performed the St Matthew Passion which the world had forgotten about.\nCasals showed enormous talent for the cello. On 23 February 1891, when he was 14 years old, he gave a solo recital in Barcelona. He graduated from the \"Escola\" with honours two years later.\nIn 1893, the Spanish composer Isaac Alb\u00e9niz heard him playing in a trio in a caf\u00e9. He gave him a letter which allowed him to be introduced to the Queen. She gave him money so that he could study at the Conservatory in Madrid. She then allowed him to go to Brussels to study at the Conservatory which was then the best in Europe for string instruments. The cello teacher mentioned a long list of cello pieces and asked him which ones he played. When Casals told him he could play them all, the teacher made fun of him. When Casals started playing, everyone was amazed at his talent. The teacher wanted him to be one of his pupils, but Casals had been insulted and so he went to Paris the next day. The Queen of Spain was angry with Casals when she heard what had happened and stopped sending him money.\nIn Paris he had very little money. He earned a living by playing second cello in the theatre orchestra of the \"Folies Marigny\". His mother tried to earn some money by sewing. In 1896, he returned to Catalonia where he taught at a music school and played principal cellist in the orchestra of Barcelona's opera house, the Liceu. In 1897 he appeared as soloist with the Madrid Symphony Orchestra, and was awarded the Order of Charles III from the Queen.\nInternational fame.\nIn 1899, Casals played the Saint-Sa\u00ebns Cello Concerto at Crystal Palace in London, and later for Queen Victoria at her summer home at Cowes, Isle of Wight. He was becoming very famous. In Paris he make a great impression on everyone, especially the conductor Charles Lamoureux who had started a famous orchestra. Casals went to the Netherlands, the United States where he gave 80 concerts, and South America. He often played with the pianist Harold Bauer.\nOn 15 January 1904 Casals was invited to play at the White House for President Theodore Roosevelt. He played in the Carnegie Hall in New York, playing \"Richard Strauss's Don Quixote\" with the composer conducting. Between 1906 and 1912 he had a relationship with a Portuguese cellist Guilhermina Suggia, although they were never married.\nIn 1914 Casals married the American singer Susan Metcalfe. They were separated in 1928, but did not divorce until 1957.\nCasals formed a trio with the pianist Alfred Cortot and the violinist Jacques Thibaud. They gave many concerts and made some of the first recordings of piano trio music. They played together for 30 years.\nIn 1905 he toured Russia. It was an unfortunate time because the Russian Revolution was taking place. During the concert he played in Moscow gunfire could be heard outside the hall.\nDuring the First World War Casals lived in New York. In 1919 he went back to Barcelona. He wanted to improve the music in his own country. There were very few people who could play well, so he founded his own orchestra: the Orquesta Pau Casals. This annual music festival continued until the start of the Spanish Civil War in 1936.\nCasals supported the Spanish Republican government. When it was defeated he said that he would not return until Spain was once more a democratic country. He then left his country and went into exile. He went to live in the French village of Prades which was near the border with Spain. He continued his career as a cellist. After World War II, in June 1946, he went to England and played the cello concertos by Schumann and Elgar at the Royal Albert Hall with Sir Adrian Boult conducting. Outside the hall the police had to help him get to his car because so many people were crowding round him.\nCasals played in many countries, but refused to play in any country that was friendly with Franco\u2019s government in Spain. In 1945 he gave a broadcast at the BBC and spoke to his people in Catalonia. He finished by playing a Catalan folksong called \"El Cant dels Ocells\" (\"The Song of the Birds\"). He played it at the end of all his concerts. When Britain recognized Franco\u2019s government, Casals decided he could no long play in England. He made one big exception to his decision not to visit Franco-friendly countries: in 1961 he took part in a concert of chamber music in the White House on 13 November where he played to President John F Kennedy whom he admired.\nLater years.\nPrades Festivals.\nIn 1950 he continued his career as conductor and cellist at the Prades Festival in Conflent. He agreed to play on condition that the money that was made at the festival would be given to a refugee hospital nearby. Franco said that Spaniards were forbidden to go to the festival, but many managed to cross the border on foot. Many world-famous musicians played at Prades: Josef Szigeti, Isaac Stern, Rudolf Serkin and Eugene Istomin and others.\nHe continued to lead the Prades Festivals until 1966.\nPuerto Rico.\nWhen he was 80 Casals married one of his young students, a girl called Marta. They had met in Prades. Marta was from Puerto Rico where Casals\u2019 mother had come from. They went to live in Puerto Rico in a house called \"El Pesebre\". In 1957 a musical festival was started there in the town of San Juan. He continued to visit the festival at Prades every year until 1966. He also gave masterclasses at American schools and universities as well as in other countries. Some of these were televised.\nThe composer.\nCasals was also a composer. One of his last compositions was the \"Himne a les Nacions Unides\" (Hymn of the United Nations); he conducted its first performance in a special concert at the United Nations on 24 October 1971, 2 months before his 95th birthday.\nCasals wrote an autobiography \"Joys and Sorrows; Reflections\" (1970).\nDeath.\nCasals died in 1973 in San Juan, Puerto Rico, at the age of 96. In 1979 his remains were taken to El Vendrell, Catalonia, where he had been born. He did not live to see the end of the Franco dictatorial regime. Later, when Franco had died in 1975 and Spain was a democracy once more, the Spanish government under King Juan Carlos I, issued a postage stamp in honour of the centenary of his birth.\nIn 1989, sixteen years after his death, Casals was awarded a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.\nHis achievements.\nNo other cellist had such an influence on cello playing in the 20th century. He changed the way people thought about cello technique. For example: when he was young violinists and cellists were taught to practise with a book under the right arm. This made the bowing arm very stiff. Casals taught his pupils to play with a free bowing arm. Casals was a great teacher, and he learned a lot about playing through his teaching. He thought about fingering and bowing, and showed his pupils how their left hand could be strong but also relaxed.\nThe International Pau Casals Cello Competition is held in Germany once every four years. It was started in 2000 to help young cellists to start their careers. It is supported by the Pau Casals Foundation, under the patronage Casals\u2019 widow. One of the prizes is the use of a beautiful cello which was owned by Casals.\nReferences.\nThe Great Cellists: Margaret Campbell, London 2004, , p.\u00a082. \nThe New Grove Dictionary of Music &amp; Musicians, ed.

Every year, the winner of the NFC Championship Game receives the George Halas Trophy and gets to play against the winner of the AFC Championship Game in the Super Bowl.\nSeason schedule.\nEach NFC team plays the other teams in their division twice in the regular season. They play the team once at home and once at the other team's stadium (an \"away\" game). Each team also plays 10 other games given to their schedule by the NFL in the April before. Two of these games are assigned on the basis of the teams' final record from the year before. The other 8 games are split between the roster of two other NFL divisions. This assignment shifts each year. For example, in the 2007 regular season, each team in the NFC West played one game against each team in both the AFC North and the NFC South. In this way division competition is the same opponents except for the 2 games given based on the strength of the each team's season record from the year before.\nAt the end of each season, a series of playoff games are played among the top six teams in the NFC. These are the four division champions (by place standing) and the two other teams (\"wild cards\") with the best win-loss records. The NFC playoffs culminate in the NFC Championship Game for the George Halas Trophy. In the NFC Championship game, The NFC team will get to beat the Green Bay Packers. The NFC Champion plays the AFC Champion in the Super Bowl. Unfortunately, the Dallas Cowgirls\u2014sorry, Cowboys won\u2019t be able to reach the Superbowl.\nHistory.\nThe NFC was made after the NFL merged with the American Football League (AFL) in 1970. While all of the former AFL teams along with the NFL's Cleveland Browns, Pittsburgh Steelers, and Baltimore Colts made up the American Football Conference (AFC), the other 13 NFL teams formed the NFC.\nHowever, team owners could not agree to a plan on how to put the teams into divisions in the NFC. The proposals were narrowed down to five finalists. Then the plan that was selected was picked out of a glass bowl by then-NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle's secretary.\nSince the merger, three expansion teams have joined the NFC. This makes the current total number of teams 16. When the Seattle Seahawks and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers joined the league in 1976, they were temporarily placed in the NFC and AFC, respectively, for one season before they switched conferences. The Seahawks returned to the NFC as a result of the 2002 realignment. The Carolina Panthers joined the NFC in 1995."}

It is named after the Adriatic coast of Dalmatia, in Croatia, its first home. The origins of the breed are unknown. The Dalmatian has been used for a war dog, fire department mascot, and shepherd. It is best known, however, as a coach or carriage dog, being a guard for horse-pulled vehicles. Also, the Dalmatian was used for being a circus performer, vermin hunter, fire-apparatus follower, hound dog, and as a guard dog.\nOrigin.\nThere are lots of arguments about the origin of this dog. Spotted dogs are known very much in the history of Africa, Europe, and Asia. Spotted dogs are also thought to have lived in Egypt. In 1700, a dog known as the \"Bengal pointer\", which looked a bit like the Dalmatian, was popular in England. Some think the Dalmatian is from Croatia, and is a Croatian breed. In the Middle Ages, it was used as a hound dog for hunting. The breed became popular as a carriage dog in the 1800s. They walked among the horses and carriages, following their masters, and guarding the carriages and horses while the master was busy with other things.\nDescription.\nThe Dalmatian is a medium , strong dog. Its skull is flat on the top. The muzzle is almost the same length as the top of the skull. Its nose can be either black, brown (liver), blue, or a dark gray that looks like black. Its round eyes are either brown or blue, or sometimes both put together.\nIts toenails are white or black in dogs with a black spotted coat and brown or white in those with liver colored spots. Puppies are usually born completely white and the spots develop a few weeks after they are born.\nThe Dalmatian stands .\nAround 8% of Dalmatians are born deaf and some can become partially deaf after a while making them expensive to treat.\nCharacteristics.\nDalmatians are known as the \"clowns\" in the dog world. They are also loyal to their owners and caretakers. Dalmatians are medium sized dogs, and they are very active and lively. They are brave and smart, and their senses are very bright. This makes them a good choice to become a companion dog."}

To find out if a person is overweight, you can calculate their body mass index. People with a BMI of 25 or more are overweight. Anything above 30 is obese (very overweight). Overweight used to be a BMI of 27 or more. In 1998 this changed.\nBeing overweight is associated with health problems such as Type 2 diabetes. Obesity is associated with greater health problems than overweight. In 2006 Adams et al. estimated that the risk of death increases by 20 to 40 percent among overweight people. Some people think that being overweight is not as unhealthy as is commonly thought. A 2013 review of 97 Pubmed articles with a sample size of 2.88 million found that overweight is associated with significantly lower all-cause mortality (death) than 'normal' weight. Body fat contains energy that the body can use to heal when it is sick. \n51.3% of overweight adults are metabolically healthy. Metabolically healthy overweight women are no more likely to die or have a heart attack or stroke than metabolically healthy normal weight women.\nDoctors often tell overweight people that losing weight would be good for their health. People usually try to lose weight by eating less. This is called 'dieting'.

It holds that both the scripture of the Torah and mouth-to-mouth traditions later written down in the Talmud etc., were actually and literally given by God, and that past rabbis handed them over without change and were always faithful in deciding how they applied to reality. Because of this, Orthodox Judaism is very careful in holding to the tradition of past rabbis, and is very conservative on how current rabbis may decide what the law is in new cases. Orthodox Jews consider themselves as the only truly faithful Jews and reject all the new non-Orthodox forms of Jewish thought, religious or secular, that came to be in the last 250 years (since the Jewish community lost its powers to enforce people, and Jews began to be citizens of the modern state). Even so, they are a product of new times just like everyone else: Their community organizations were created so they could separate from other Jews because those stopped being religious. The Orthodox also had to make very new ways of thinking and acting to deal with the big changes. \nAs of 2001, Orthodox Jews and Jews affiliated with an Orthodox synagogue, accounted for approximately 50% of Anglo Jewry (150,000), 25% of Israeli Jewry (1,500,000) and 13% of American Jewry (529,000).

It is part of Ventura County. The 14,562 acre (58.93 km\u00b2 or 22.753 sq mi) island is used by the United States Navy for a weapons testing and training. The only people who live on the island are about 200 people with the military. The island has a small airport and a big billboard.\nHistory.\nSan Nicolas was once the home of the Nicole\u00f1o people, who were probably related to the Tongva of the mainland and Santa Catalina Island. It was named for Saint Nicholas by Spanish sailor Sebasti\u00e1n Vizca\u00edno after he saw the island on the saint's feast day (December 6) in 1602. Vizca\u00edno reported that there were a lot of people living on the island. By 1800 the number of people on the island had gone down. In 1811 a group of Kodiak men from Alaska were put on to San Nicholas to hunt otters. They fought with the Nicole\u00f1os. When the Kodiaks left there were less than 100 of the original population left. By 1835 the population was about 12. The Nicole\u00f1os were taken off the island in the 1835 by the members of the California mission system. Within a few years of leaving the island the Nicole\u00f1o all died. \nLone Woman of San Nicolas Island.\nThe most famous person from San Nicolas Island was the \"Lone Woman of San Nicolas Island\". She was left on the island in 1835 when the rest of the Nicole\u00f1os were moved to the missions. She lived on the island alone for 18 years before she was found and brought back to Santa Barbara in 1853. By this time there was no-one left who could speak her language. Her real name was never known, but as she was dying she was named Juana Maria. She died from dysentery seven weeks later. Her story was used for Scott O'Dell's award winning 1961 novel \"Island of the Blue Dolphins\". Today, a commemorative plaque about her life has been placed on the back of the east bell tower at Mission Santa Barbara. In 2012 scientists rediscovered a buried cave on the island where they believe the woman lived.\nRocket experiments.\nFrom 1957 and 1973, and in 2004, U.S. rockets were launched from San Nicolas Island.\nPlants and animals.\nThere are few kinds of plants and animals on San Nicolas Island. Sheep ate many of the plants before they were taken away in 1943. Even so, there are several plants that can only be found on the island. Three kinds of animals are there and nowhere else: deer mouse, island fox, and island night lizard. The island also has many birds."}

On April 7, 2006 he started wrestling under his real name \"Oleg Prudius\" and had his first match in DSW against Tommy Suede.\nOn May 5, 2006, Prudius had his first untelevised WWE match during a house show in San Jose, California, defeating Rob Conway. The next night, at another house show in Sacramento, California, Matt Striker cut a promo on Prudius, calling him a \"filthy immigrant,\" causing Prudius to attack him. Prudius then picked up the microphone and said he that he is \"proud to be in America.\"\nOn the December 18, 2006 episode of \"Raw\", Prudius made an appearance as a WWE prospect named Vladimir Kozlov, which became his ring name. For the next several weeks, Kozlov was interviewed on WWE programming, proclaiming his love for \"Double Double E\" (WWE), but drawing some heel heat for declaring his superiority over whatever wrestlers were competing at the time.\nOhio Valley Wrestling (2007-2008).\nOn July 28, 2007 in Louisville, Kentucky, he won the OVW Heavyweight Championship by defeating Paul Burchill, but gave up the Championship the same night to Michael W.

He defeated Matt Bentley in his first match, and over the following weeks, Kozlov would win a series of matches. On the July 11, 2008 airing of \"SmackDown\", Kozlov debuted an entrance theme and TitanTron video as he defeated Stevie Richards.\nIn the following weeks, as Kozlov continued to easily win matches, he began demanding \"better competition\". On the September 12, 2008 edition of \"SmackDown\", he attacked Jeff Hardy. Over the following weeks, Kozlov would continue attacking both Hardy and the WWE Champion Triple H, eventually starting a loose rivalry between the three of them over the WWE title. Kozlov earned a match against Triple H for the WWE Championship at Survivor Series by defeating The Undertaker by disqualification on the November 6 episode of \"SmackDown\". Edge was added to the match while it was in progress, and pinned Triple H to win the match. This is because Jeff Hardy was originally supposed to compete, but was found unconscious in a Boston stairwell. At Armageddon, Kozlov gained his first pay-per-view win by defeating then-ECW Champion Matt Hardy in a non-title match. Kozlov competed in the 2009 Royal Rumble match, entering number 6, but was eliminated by Triple H after eliminating three other superstars including The Great Khali, MVP, and Carlito.\nOther media.\nPrudius has made many television appearances. He appeared in the second season of the HBO drama series \"The Wire\", as well as \"Roksalana\" and \"It's Not To Easy\" on Ukrainian TV.

Coconut crabs are found in the tropical Indian and Pacific Oceans. Even though they are named the Coconut crab, they don't eat coconuts that often. They mainly eat certain fruits and nuts. Coconut crabs can climb trees. Coconut crab meat has been considered a local delicacy. Coconut crabs are extremely high priced in the national food market. They can live up to 120 years.\nDescription.\nThe coconut crab is the largest terrestrial arthropod, and indeed terrestrial invertebrate, in the world. There are different reports on its size: most sources give a body length up to , a weight up to , and a leg span more than . Males are generally larger than females. The carapace may reach a length of , and a width up to .\nLike with other decapots, the body of the coconut crab is divided into a front section (cephalothorax), which has 10 legs, and an abdomen. The front-most pair of legs has large chelae (claws); the left claw is larger than the right. The next two pairs, as with other hermit crabs, are large, powerful walking legs with pointed tips. This allows coconut crabs to climb vertical or overhanging surfaces. The fourth pair of legs is smaller with tweezer-like chelae at the end: young coconut crabs use it to grip the inside of a shell or coconut husk to carry for protection, adults use this pair for walking and climbing. The last pair of legs is very small and is used by females to tend their eggs, and by the males in mating. This last pair of legs is usually held inside the carapace, in the cavity containing the breathing organs. Some difference in color occurs between the animals found on different islands, ranging from orange-red to purplish blue; in most regions, blue is the predominant color, but in some places, including the Seychelles, most individuals are red.\nAlthough \"B. latro\" is a derived type of hermit crab, only the juveniles use salvaged snail shells to protect their soft abdomens, and adolescents sometimes use broken coconut shells for that purpose. Unlike other hermit crabs, the adult coconut crabs do not carry shells, but instead harden their abdominal terga by depositing chitin and chalk. Not being constrained by the physical confines of living in a shell allows this species to grow much larger than other hermit crabs in the family Coenobitidae. Like most true crabs, \"B.\u00a0latro\" bends its tail underneath its body for protection. The hardened abdomen protects the coconut crab and reduces water loss on land, but must be moulted periodically. Adults moult annually, and dig a burrow up to long in which to hide while vulnerable. It remains in the burrow for 3 to 16 weeks, depending on the size of the animal. After moulting, 1 to 3 weeks are needed for the exoskeleton to harden, depending on the animal's size, during which time the animal's body is soft and vulnerable, and it stays hidden for protection."}

Iero heard a few demo songs from the band, and wanted to sign the band to his own independent label. He later joined the band after the first lead singer did not write any lyrics to the songs. As a member of Leathermouth, this is the first band where he writes the lyrics and does lead vocals. Iero uses the band as a way to express about the way he sees the world and also to let out his personal problems with depression and anxiety. Leathermouth played their first shows in the summer of 2008 alongside Warship for the Fall 2008 Reggie and the Full Effect \"Farewell Tour\". Iero hopes to tour with Leathermouth when he is not working with My Chemical Romance.\nIn October 2008, Leathermouth signed to Epitaph Records, rather than to Frank Iero's label as originally planned. Iero thought that it would be hard to advertise the album himself if it was released through his own label, with his current responsibilities to My Chemical Romance and the other bands signed to his label. Epitaph Records president, Brett Gurewitz, was impressed with the band's \"intensity and songwriting of the music.\" Leathermouth released their first studio album, \"XO\" on January 27, 2009 through Epitaph. Even though the album did not become listed on the Billboard 200, it did reach #21 on the Top Heatseekers chart."}

It combines the lemurs of Madagascar, with the galagos and lorises of Africa and Asia.\nThe lorises and lemurs are a monophyletic clade. However, a popular alternative taxonomy puts the lorises in their own infraorder, the Lorisiformes.\nEvolutionary history.\nLemuriform origins are unclear and debated. The main problem is a lack of clear transitional fossils.\nMolecular clock estimates suggest that lemurs and the lorisoids diverged in Africa during the Paleocene, about 62\u00a0mya. Between 47 and 54\u00a0mya, lemurs got to Madagascar by rafting. In isolation, the lemurs diversified and filled the niches often filled by monkeys and apes today.\nIn Africa, the lorises and galagos diverged during the Eocene, about 40\u00a0mya. Unlike the lemurs in Madagascar, they have had to compete with monkeys and apes, as well as other mammals.\nAdapiformes.\nBecause the skeletons of adapiforms share strong similarities with those of lemurs and lorises, researchers have often referred to them as \"primitive\" strepsirrhines, lemur ancestors, or a sister group to the living strepsirrhines. They are included in Strepsirrhini, and are considered basal members of the clade.\nAlthough their status as true primates is not questioned, their relationship with other primates in Strepsirrhini is unclear. Sometimes they are put in their own infraorder; sometimes they are sometimes reduced to families in the Lemuriformes."}

It is funded by the government of the city and it does not have any tuition fees. It is in the district of Intramuros in Manila, the Philippines. It was established on June 19, 1965 and opened on July 17, 1967 to 556 scholars, all coming from the top ten percent of graduates of Manila's public high schools. and opened on July 17, 1967.\nPLM holds the distinction of being the first in several ways\u2014 the first institution of higher learning in the country and perhaps in Asia to offer tuition-free tertiary education; the first university funded solely by a city government; and the first institution of higher learning in the country to have its official name in Filipino.\nFrom its first enrollment record of 556 freshman scholars coming from the top ten percent of the graduating classes of Manila's twenty-nine public high schools, total semestral enrollment has grown to an average of 11,000. The lone college in its earliest beginning has sprung to 12 colleges, five graduate, two professional schools, and a score of research and specialized centers, including a teaching hospital, an enterpreneurial center, and an integrated learning center for toddlers. In addition, it maintains a comprehensive distance education and open university program for thousands of community health workers and public administrators in various regions nationwide with affiliations and recognition from various national and international organizations and institutions.\nTo date, there are 53 single-degree baccalaureate programs and 49 masters, doctoral, and graduate diploma offerings that lead to degrees in accountancy, economics, architecture, business administration, computer studies, education, engineering, law, mass communication, mathematics, medicine, nursing, physical education, physical therapy, psychology, sciences, social work, tourism, management, and public governance.\nAccording to the Philippines' Commission on Higher Education (CHED), it is a model university for all public institutions across the country, one of the centers of excellence in the City of Manila, and the fifth among all universities nationwide based on the number of examinees passing the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) test.\nAcademics and administration.\nAs a university with its own charter, PLM enjoys certain level of autonomy. It is governed by the Board of Regents and administered by a President. The Board of Regents has the authority to grant diplomas, certificates and titles to students who have completed their academic programs and validate graduation of students. The six-member Board is composed of the President of the PLM, a representative of the PLM faculty, a distinguished alumnus, a respected educator, and one other respected professional, and the Superintendent of the Division of City Schools-Manila. Each member serves a six-year tenure of office. The President oversees the implementation of the university policies. Immediately under the President are the offices of four Vice-Presidents - Executive Vice President, Vice President for Academic Affairs, Vice President for Administration, and Vice President for Finance and Planning.\nThe University is organized into twelve undergraduate colleges, two professional schools, seven graduate schools, and an open university and distance learning program, which are all being supervised by the Executive Vice President. These academic units collectively provide 53 single-degree undergraduate and 49 masters, doctoral and graduate diploma programs.\nThe twelve undergraduate colleges are the College of Accountancy &amp; Economics, College of Architecture &amp; Urban Planning, College of Engineering &amp; Technology, College of Human Development, College of Liberal Arts, College of Management &amp; Entrepreneurship, College of Mass Communication, College of Nursing, College of Physical Education, Recreation &amp; Sports, College of Physical Therapy, College of Science, and College of Tourism, Hotel &amp; Travel Industry Management. The two professional schools are the College of Law and the College of Medicine. The seven graduate schools include Graduate School of Arts, Sciences &amp; Education, Graduate School of Health Sciences, Graduate School of Engineering, Graduate School of Law, Graduate School of Management, Graduate School of Urban &amp; Settlements Planning, and the President Ramon Magsaysay School of Public Governance. The university's open university and distance learning program is served through the Emeritus College, Open University, and the District Colleges.\nPLM is the tenth largest university in Metro Manila with a total student enrollment of 13,711 (as of January 20, 2006). For the undergraduate class of 2011, PLM received 40,000 college applications, and accepted three percent of them.\nPLM's endowment in 2008 was valued at PhP 500 million, excluding the funding allotted for its teaching hospital, Ospital ng Maynila Medical Center, of about PhP 250 million. The University spends about four to fives times the national average for education.\nPLM utilizes a semester-based modular system for conducting courses, adopts features of the American system (credits), and employs the General Weighted Average (GWA) system and a 1.00 to 5.00 grading scale, with 1.00 being the highest possible grade for a particular undergraduate course.\nThe semestral calendar being used by PLM consists of two regular semesters of about 15 to 16 weeks each, and semestral breaks of about three to four weeks each. The university requires a minimum of twelve units to be considered a full-time student, with the maximum being twenty units.\nReputation.\nThe late President, Diosdado Macapagal, who himself visited the University, said that PLM is \"a unique university because it is the first community-oriented and socially conscious university in the country.\" He added that, \"it gives poor but deserving public high school graduates of the community the means to acquire higher education.\" Moreover, he recognized PLM's emerging status as \"one of the top universities in the country.\" Her daughter, President, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo cited PLM for having a \"culture of excellence,\" and commended the university for what she had believed as its \"impressive\" accomplishments in various fields.\nThe country's leading newspaper, The Philippine Daily Inquirer, described PLM as a local university with a national character and reputation. US Ambassador Kristie Kenney, in her speech during the 40th Commencement Exercises at the PLM Grandstand, praised PLM for building a \"culture of commitment to public service in its students, faculty and alumni.\" In an article in the Business Mirror , PLM was considered as the \"highest symbol of Manila\u2019s public educational system which radiates another form of power and influence.\" Websites such as Manila Board regarded that PLM is one of leading and prime public universities in the country today.\nOn August 13, 2008, Adel A. Tamano, in his column at the \"Manila Times\" wrote that PLM is \"a unique learning institution\" and is \"essentially an \"honors school\" where only the students from lower income families with excellent scholastic records are admitted.\"\nPLM is not a perfect institution, and the university had been criticized in the past for the 'reconsideration' cases, wherein some students who failed to meet the university\u2019s standards for retention were readmitted because of the so-called 'backers'. In order to resolve this issue, the city government has insulated the University from political pressure so as not to compromise its status as one of the country's leading educational institutions.[1] [2]\nHistory.\nGeographical History.\nThe site of the PLM campus at Intramuros used to be occupied by the Colegio de Manila (also known as Colegio Seminario de San Ignacio), which was founded in 1590 by Fr. Antonio Sede\u00f1o, S.J. The Colegio de Manila formally opened in 1595, and was the first school in the Philippines.\nAside from Colegio de Manila, there were other structures that were built in the site. Iglesia de Santa Ana, the first stone church in the Philippines, was built in 1590 and opened in 1596. However, an earthquake destroyed it, and another church was built in honor of St. Ignatius of Loyola in 1626.\nIn 1601, the Colegio de San Jos\u00e9 was set up as an annex of Colegio Seminario de San Ignacio. Twenty years later, Pope Gregory XV, through the Archbishop of Manila, authorized the Colegio Seminario de San Ignacio to confer degrees in theology and arts and elevated it into a university. In 1623, Philip IV of Spain confirmed the authorization, making the school both a pontifical and a royal university, and the very first university in the Philippines and in Asia. In 1722, the Colegio de San Jos\u00e9 was granted \"royal patronage\".\nIn 1768, the Jesuits surrendered the Universidad Maximo de San Ignacio to the Spanish authorities after their suppression and expulsion from Spain and its territories. Later, the Universidad Maximo de San Ignacio was placed under secular administration and converted into a seminary and a liberal arts college. In 1773, Pope Clement XIV formally declared the dissolution of the Society of Jesus. In 1895, the Universidad Maximo de San Ignacio merged with the Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy of the University of Santo Tomas. The Colegio de San Jos\u00e9 is now the San Jos\u00e9 Major Seminary at the Ateneo de Manila University.\nThe buildings of what was the Universidad Maximo de San Ignacio were transformed into military headquarters called Cuartel del Rey, which eventually became known as Cuartel de Espa\u00f1a. Jos\u00e9 Rizal was placed on trial for sedition here on December 26, 1896.\nDuring the American occupation, part of the barracks was razed, and a gymnasium was built on it. In early 1930s, one of first games of the NCAA was played in the 31st Infantry Quonset Gym. The buildings and the whole premises served as military headquarters for the 31st Infantry of the United States Army until 1941. During World War II, General Douglas McArthur held command post here, but the entire area was later destroyed by the ongoing military conflict.\nIn early 1960s, the site was rehabilitated by the city government and a building was constructed at General Luna Street to house the students of Manila High School. However, on April 24, 1965, the late President Diosdado Macapagal issued Proclamation 392-A, giving to the proposed city university the three-hectare lot being occupied by Manila High School. On February 26, 1967, the new complex along Victoria Street was inaugurated, and the students of Manila High School was transferred there. On July 17, 1967, the first group of PLM scholars began studying on the site where the modern educational system in the Philippines started.\nFounding.\nThe call to open a university run by the city government of Manila began during the term of Mayor Arsenio H. Lacson when Ordinance No. 4202 was approved by the City councilors on January 13, 1960. The said ordinance allotted a total of PhP 1,000,000 for the construction of the university. However, Mayor Lacson did not however live to see the realization of this project as he died suddenly of heart attack. Vice Mayor Antonio Villegas took over and continued Lacson's plan. He later issued Executive Order No. 7, s-1963 that created the committee that would draw up the plan of founding a university. But some difficulty prevented the university's formal creation. As a result, he sought the help of Congressman Justo R. Albert, representative of the City's fourth congressional district. Congressman Albert then sponsored House Bill No. 8349 at the Philippines' House of Representatives. The Senate version of the bill was authored by Senators Gil Puyat and Camilo Osias.\nThe two bills were eventually combined into one, and it was discussed during the Fourth Session of the Fifth Congress of the Philippines on January 25, 1965. The final bill was later passed by the joint Congress and signed by Senate President Ferdinand E. Marcos and House Speaker Cornelio T. Villareal with Mr. Regino S. Eustaquio, Secretary of the Senate, and Mr. Inocencio B. Pareja, Secretary of the House of Representatives.\nOn June 19, 1965, the final bill with the title - \"An Act Authorizing the City of Manila to Establish and Operate the University of the City of Manila and for Other Purposes\" - was signed into law by President Diosdado P. Macapacal in a signing ceremony at Malaca\u00f1ang Palace. The signing was witnessed by Atty. Primitivo de Leon, Mayor Villegas, Congressman Ramon Mitra Jr., and its main sponsor in the House of Representatives, Congressman Albert. The law was captioned as Republic Act No. 4196, which now serves as the University Charter.\nEarly years.\nWith an enrollment of 556 students\u2014both men and women\u2014PLM opened for classes on July 17, 1967. All of them are housed under the University College, which offered liberal arts courses. After a year, a Graduate Institute for Teachers was founded, and it was followed by the Institute of Extramural Studies. At the turn of the decade, the school had expanded its offerings to include degree programs leading to specializations in communication, engineering, education, business administration, nursing."}

In 1995, Meave Leakey and her associates, taking note of differences between \"Australopithecus afarensis\" and the new finds, assigned them to a new species, \"A. anamensis\", deriving its name from the Turkana word anam, meaning \"lake\"."}

Thurgood Marshall, earlier named Thoroughgood Marshall (which he changed in the 2nd grade), was born in Baltimore, Maryland. Marshall served on the Court from 1967 to 1991. In 1946 he was awarded the Springarn Medal for all his achievements and hard work for the NAACP. Marshall had been one of the NAACP's top lawyers. He was one of the lawyers who argued \"Brown v. Board of Education\". He was also Solicitor General of the United States.\nThurgood Marshall attended Frederick Douglass High School in Baltimore, Maryland and was in the class with the brightest students. He graduated a year early in 1925 with a B-grade average, and was in the top three of his class. In 1929 He married Vivian Burey . He went on to attend Lincoln University and graduated in 1930. He applied to the University of Maryland Law School, but was denied admission because he was black. He later joined the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) and became an active member. In 1934, Marshall became director of the NAACP, Legal Defense and for an Educational Fund. He won his first major civil rights case in Maryland in 1935 with the help of Charles Houston. He won 29 of 32 Supreme Court cases. He went on to argue thirty-two cases before the Supreme Court in 1940. Marshall argued in the Smith v. Allwright which disputed the Texan government preventing the rights of black people from voting in 1944. He also fought in the Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka about racial segregation in public schools in 1948, which was one of the biggest cases of the century. In 1954 the Supreme Court ended racial segregation in public schools. This was a rule violation of the 14th Amendment. It made way for integration and was a major victory of the civil rights movement. He then went on to investigate U.S. Army courts-martial in 1950-1951, in Japan and Korea to help African American soldiers. In 1961 John F. Kennedy appointed him to the US Court of Appeals and he won 29 cases before attending the Supreme Court.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nBetween the years 1908-1993, he fought for individual rights. A quote that he wrote himself \u00a0\u201c\"A child born to a black mother in a state like Mississippi\u2026.. has the same rights as a white boy born to the wealthiest person the United States. It\u2019s not true, but I challenge anyone to say it is not a goal worth working for..\"\u201d Marshall believed that both blacks and whites should have equal rights but it was not happening in the United States. He thought it was right for both rich and poor children to have equal rights. This quote had to do with Thurgood Marshall\u2019s life because he was not rich but his parents and teachers worked hard to help him become a lawyer. He had to memorize the constitution. As a lawyer, he fought to end segregation between blacks and whites.\nThurgood Marshall was against the death penalty because he didn't think that it was necessary. He argued that there is no reason for the people who did something wrong, to go through the death penalty. He says that they should have a less painful punishment by going to prison instead. In 1990, Marshall said a lot of things about the death penalty and why he didn't want it enforced. \nBack in Thurgood Marshall's time, the time of segregation, some thought that if people were more open they would have seen the most important black male of the century. He joined the NAACP and argued in Brown v Board. To this day there is only one other black male in the Supreme Court justice. In his time in the Supreme Court he worked to end segregation and\u00a0fought for the equal rights for all people. Even though he\u2019s dead, his legacy is still alive."}

His father started to teach him the violin, but the young boy wanted to hold it between his legs like a cello, so his father bought him a small cello. In 1909 the family moved to Vienna so that he could learn the cello from the famous Friedrich Buxbaum, the cellist of the Ros\u00e9 Quartet and principal cellist of the Vienna Philharmonic. Then he studied with Anton Walter at the Music Academy in Vienna. In February 1914, aged twelve, he played in his first concert, performing Joseph Haydn's Cello Concerto in D with the Vienna Philharmonic conducted by Felix Weingartner. \nIn 1917, Feuermann went to Leipzig where he studied with Julius Klengel. Klengel thought his young pupil was incredibly talented, but that he did not know much great cello music. Feuermann worked very hard. Klengel was a good teacher for him\nIn 1919 Friedrich Gr\u00fctzmacher died and Klengel recommended Feuermann should take his job at the G\u00fcrzenich Conservatory in Cologne. Although he was very young he got the job which had a very good salary, but he was not given the title of \u201cprofessor\u201d. \nDuring the 1920s he gave many concerts all over the world. In 1929 he became professor at the Musikhochschule in Berlin.He played with famous people such as the violinists Carl Flesch, Szymon Goldberg, Joseph Wolfsthal and Jascha Heifetz, the composer and viola player Paul Hindemith and the pianist Artur Rubinstein.\nOn April 3, 1933, with the rise of Nazism, he lost his job at the Berlin Conservatory because he was Jewish. He moved to London. He toured Japan and the United States where he played the Haydn concerto with the New York Philharmonic conducted by Bruno Walter. Some music critics were not very impressed with his playing. However, a few days later he gave a recital. Nearly all the professional cellists in New York were there because they had heard that Feuermann was an exceptional player. The audience were extremely enthusiastic and even the music critics changed their minds.\nIn 1935 he married. He moved to Z\u00fcrich with his wife, but happened to be in Vienna at the time of the Anschluss while his wife and young daughter were still in Z\u00fcrich. Bronislaw Huberman helped Feuermann and his family escape to Israel in September 1938. At the end of the year they went to the United States and applied for American citizenship.\nHe taught at the Curtis Institute of Music and gave concerts and made recordings with other great musicians including Artur Schnabel, Bronislaw Huberman and, especially, with the pianist Franz Rupp. \nFeuermann died in 1942 of an infection after a small operation for haemorrhoids.\nHis reputation.\nFeuermann was one of the greatest cellists who ever lived. The cello was not often heard as a solo instrument in those days, but Feuermann and Pablo Casals made people change their minds. Feuermann did not actually practise very much on his own, but when he was making music with other people he worked very hard at all the detail. He loved teaching. He also loved fast cars. His family were very important indeed to him.\nMany believe that Feuermann's interpretation of Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's Cello Concerto and his performance of Johannes Brahms's Double Concerto with Jascha Heifetz are among the best ever.

She was also Regent of England for her son Edward III of England when he was too young to rule. Until 1325 she was a traditional queen consort. After that time she had one of the worst reputations of any English queen.\nEarly life.\nShe was the daughter of Philip IV of France and Joan I of Navarre. As the daughter of two monarchs she was destined to be a queen. While France and England had a common culture, political relations between them were tense. To ease this situation Pope Boniface VIII arranged two marriages. This double-alliance was between Edward I of England and Marguerite of France and also the infant Edward II marrying Isabel. In 1299 the marriage between Edward I and Marguerite took place. The marriage between Edward II and Isabella would wait until she was old enough. They were married in 1308 at Boulogne-sur-Mer in France.\nYoung queen.\nAt age 12 the young bride was already considered a great beauty. Since his father's death a year earlier, the 24 year old Edward II was now king. But he showed very little interest in Isabella. His first act as king was to recall the exiled Piers Gaveston. One chronicler wrote \"He had home his greatest love.\"\nWhatever their relationship was exactly, Edward II regarded Gaveston with great affection. From the beginning of his marriage to Isabella their relationship was not good. Edward had no romantic interest in Isabella. Isabella soon found her husband was not giving her any money. She wrote to her father telling him she was living in poverty. King Philip quickly wrote back demanding Edward provide for his wife and any children they might have. Edward stalled by giving excuses. Meanwhile Isabella discovered that Piers Gaveston had been given many of the jewels her father had given her as part of her dowry. Isabella was furious. Her uncles warned Edward they would not attend their coronation unless he got rid of Gaveston. But Edward's barons had already made the same threats. Edward promised he would take care of everything when the parliament met in March. When Gaveston was put in charge of the coronation, one thing after another went wrong. At the banquet table honoring the king and queen, Gaveston sat next to the king instead of Isabella. He even displayed his Coat of arms next to the king's instead of Isabella's. The barons and Isabella's kinsmen were angry over these insults to their new queen. But it wasn't until 1311 that the barons drew up a list of ordinances the king had to follow. The first was to get rid of Piers Gaveston. But before 1312 Gaveston came back to England. That same year Isabella was pregnant with their first child. To escape the barons, Edward and Gaveston fled north taking Isabella with them. They left her unprotected at York while Edward and Gaveston escaped on a ship. But the barons were not upset with Isabella. Gaveston was captured and murdered in the summer of 1312. This didn't end Isabella's troubles as Edward found a new favorite in Hugh le Despenser. In November their first child was born, the future Edward III of England. But Despenser hated Isabella more than Gaveston. By 1321 she was virtually a prisoner. By 1324 Edward had given all her lands to Despenser.\nSent to France.\nIn 1325 Edward convinced Isabella to go to France. Her brother Charles IV of France was now king. Edward wanted her to negotiate for him over Gascony. This was Isabella's chance for freedom. She even convinced her husband to send their son Edward (III) to join her. Edward soon realized his mistake and demanded she and his son return. Isabella ignored his demands and remained in France. The anger she must have felt over the years of mistreatment in England finally gave her a chance to rebel against her husband. She had their son, the future king of England with her and Edward could do nothing. At this time she was joined by Roger Mortimer an English exile. Another who came to her aid was Edmund of Woodstock, 1st Earl of Kent, Edward II's half-brother. A number of Englishmen in France joined her cause. Many were upset with Edward II and the Despensers. \nHainaut.\nBut Isabella was short of funds. She and her followers went north to Hainaut to find more support. In turn for their support, she negotiated a marriage for her son Edward to Philippa of Hainaut. She also gave up any claims she had to the French crown. She now had an army from Hainaut with many Englishmen backing her. While living in Hainaut, she and Roger Mortimer had become lovers.\nReturn to England.\nIn 1326 Isabella and her army landed at Suffolk. Neither Edward or the Despensers could mount an army against her. Edward II was captured and lost his throne. His son Edward III was made king in his place, with his mother as regent. \nIn 1321 when she was denied access to the Leeds Castle, she made her escort try to force their way in through the gate, and after they failed, she made 13 of her escort hang immediately. She had 4 children and at least 3 miscarriages. When she later died she was buried in her wedding dress."}

{"id": "166232", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=166232", "title": "Pandora", "text": "In Greek mythology, Pandora was the first mortal woman. According to Hesiod, each god helped create her by giving her unique gifts. Zeus ordered Hephaestus to mould her out of Earth. This was part of the punishment of mankind, because Prometheus had stolen the secret of fire. All the gods helped by giving her seductive gifts. Another name was found for her was Anesidora, she who sends gifts. This name was found inscribed against her figure on a white-ground \"kylix\" in the British Museum.\nAccording to the myth, Pandora opened a jar (\"pithos\") and released all the evils of mankind. With the exception of plagues and diseases, Hesiod does not specify the evils in detail. When Pandora closed the jar again, only Hope was left inside. The word pithos has been translated the wrong way, which may have led to the idea of \"Pandora's box\". Pandora opened the jar because she was curious what was inside, and not because of malice.\nThe myth of Pandora is ancient, and there are several different Greek versions. It has been interpreted in different ways. In the literary versions, the myth is a kind of theodicy, it addresses the question why there is evil in the world. The oldest versiion is that of Hesiod, who wrote it in the 7th century BC. He shortly mentions it in his Theogony, in line 570, but does not name Pandora. In his Works and Days he gives the oldest known literary version of the story. There is an older story that tells that urns and jars can contain blessings and evils which is told in Homer's Illiad:\nThe immortals know no care, yet the lot they spin for man is full of sorrow; on the floor of Zeus' palace there stand two urns, the one filled with evil gifts, and the other with good ones. He for whom Zeus the lord of thunder mixes the gifts he sends, will meet now with good and now with evil fortune; but he to whom Zeus sends none but evil gifts will be pointed at by the finger of scorn, the hand of famine will pursue him to the ends of the world, and he will go up and down the face of the earth, respected neither by gods nor men.\nHesiod's versions.\nTheogony.\nThe Pandora myth first appears in lines 560\u2013612 of Hesiod's poem the \"Theogony\". This version does not give the woman a name. Prometheus has stolen the gift of fire, and has given it to the humans. Zeus is angry about this and decides to punish men, as a compensation for the gift. He commands Hephaestus to make the first woman from earth. This woman is described as a \"beautiful evil\" whose descendants would torment the race of men. After Hephaestus does so, Athena dressed her in a silvery gown, an embroidered veil, garlands and a crown of gold. This woman is unnamed in the \"Theogony\", but is probably Pandora. Hesiod rewrote her myth in \"Works and Days\". When she first appears before gods and mortals, \"wonder seized them\" as they looked upon her. But she was \"sheer guile, not to be withstood by men.\" Hesiod elaborates (590\u201393):\n&lt;poem&gt;\nFrom her is the race of women and female kind:\nof her is the deadly race and tribe of women who\nlive amongst mortal men to their great trouble,\nno helpmates in hateful poverty, but only in wealth.&lt;/poem&gt;\nLater, Hesiod tells that men who try to avoid the evil of women by avoiding marriage will fare no better (604\u20137):\n&lt;poem&gt;\nHe reaches deadly old age without anyone to tend his years,\nand though he at least has no lack of livelihood while he lives,\nyet, when he is dead, his kinsfolk divide his possessions amongst them.&lt;/poem&gt;\nAt the end, Hesiod says that occasionally a man finds a good wife, but still (609) \"evil contends with good.\"\nWorks and Days.\nThe more famous version of the myth comes from another of Hesiod's works, called \"Works and Days\". There, the myth is contained in lines 60 to 105. Hesiod tells about Pandora's origin. He also makes the scope of the misery she inflicts on mankind bigger. As before, she is created by Hephaestus, but now more gods help completing her (lines 63-82): Athena taught her needlework and weaving (63\u20134); Aphrodite \"shed grace upon her head and cruel longing and cares that weary the limbs\" (65\u20136); Hermes gave her \"a shameful mind and deceitful nature\" (67\u20138); Hermes also gave her the power of speech, putting in her \"lies and crafty words\" (77\u201380) ; Athena then clothed her (72); next she, Persuasion and the Charites adorned her with necklaces and other finery (72\u20134); the Horae adorned her with a garland crown (75). Finally, Hermes gives this woman a name: Pandora \u2013 \"All-gifted\" \u2013 \"because all the Olympians gave her a gift\" (81). The story is written in such a way that Pandora's feminine and deceitful nature is a small problem for mankind, because she brings a \"pithos\". This word is usually translated as jar, sometimes as a \"box\". The box contains \"burdensome toil and sickness that brings death to men\" (91\u20132), diseases (102) and \"a myriad other pains\" (100).\nPrometheus had warned his brother Epimetheus not to accept any gifts from Zeus. But Epimetheus did not listen; he accepted Pandora, who promptly scattered the contents of her jar. As a result, Hesiod tells us, \"the earth and sea are full of evils\" (101). One item, however, did not escape the jar (96\u20139), hope:\n&lt;poem&gt;\nOnly Hope was left within her unbreakable house,\nshe remained under the lip of the jar, and did not\nfly away. Before [she could], Pandora replaced the\nlid of the jar. This was the will of aegis-bearing\nZeus the Cloudgatherer.&lt;/poem&gt;\nHe does not tell the reader why hope remained in the jar.\nHesiod closes with this moral (105): \"Thus it is not possible to escape the mind of Zeus.\"\nLater changes.\nArchaic and Classic Greek literature do not mention Pandora any more. Sophocles wrote a satyr play \"Pandora, or The Hammerers\", but very little is known of this play. Sappho may have made reference to Pandora in a surviving fragment.\nLater, people filled in small details, or they added postscripts to Hesiod's story. Examples for this are Apollodorus and Hyginus: Each of them added a part to the story, that might have already been in Hesiod's version, even though it was not written down: Epimetheus married Pandora. They each add that they had a daughter, Pyrrha, who married Deucalion and survived the deluge with him. The problem of that version is that Hesiod's Catalogue of Women\", fragment #2, had made a \"Pandora\" one of the \"daughters\" of Deucalion, and the mother of Graecus by Zeus.\nIn the 15th century, a monk named Annio da Viterbo said he had found a manuscript of a historian named Berossus. Berossus had lived in the 3rd century BC. According to the manuscript, \"Pandora\" was also named as a daughter-in-law of Noah. This attempt to join pagan and Christian texts was later recognised as a forgery, though.\nThe poet Theognis of Megara, who lived in the 6th year BC, had a different point of view:\n&lt;poem&gt;\nHope is the only good god remaining among mankind;\nthe others have left and gone to Olympus.\nTrust, a mighty god has gone, Restraint has gone from men,\nand the Graces, my friend, have abandoned the earth.\nMen\u2019s judicial oaths are no longer to be trusted, nor does anyone\nrevere the immortal gods; the race of pious men has perished and\nmen no longer recognize the rules of conduct or acts of piety.&lt;/poem&gt;\nTheogonis seems to be referring to a different version of the myth: In that version, the jar contained blessings rather than evils. This version seems to follow a tradition before Hesiod, which was preserved by 2nd century writer Babrius. According to Babrius, the gods sent a jar containing blessings to humans. A \"foolish man\" (not Pandora) opened the jar, and most of the blessings were lost forever. Only hope remained, \"to promise each of us the good things that fled.\"\nAttic red-figure painters seem to have had a tradition which was independent of the literary sources: Sometimes, they add to the literary version, sometimes they ignore it altogether.\nDifficulties of interpretation.\nThere are many ways in which the figure of Pandora can be interpreted. Erwin Panofsky wrote a monography on the subject. According to M. L. West, the story of Pandora and the jar is older than Hesiod's versions. This also explains the confusion and problems of Hesiod's version and that it is inconclusive. According to West, Pandoora was married to Prometheus in these versions. West cites Hesiod's \"Catalogue of Women\", which preserved the older version. In one version of the story, the jar may have contained only good things for mankind. West also writes that it may have been that Epimetheus and Pandora and their roles were transposed in the pre-Hesiodic myths. This is called a \"mythic inversion\". He remarks that there is a curious correlation between Pandora being made out of earth in Hesiod's story, to what is in Apollodorus that Prometheus created man from water and earth. Hesiod's myth of Pandora's jar, then, could be an summary of many different early myths.\nThere are different questions that need to be discussed. The Greek original text speaks about \"elpis\". Usually, this word is translated into English as \"Hope\", but it could be translated differently. \"Expectation\" is another possible translation, which is more neutral. One can expect good things, as well as bad things. Hope has a positive connotation.\n\"Elpis\" is everything that remains in the jar, when Pandora closed it again, so does the jar give \"elpis\" to mankind, or does it keep elpis away from it? -Another question to ask is wheter elpis remaining in the jar a good thing, or a bad one, for mankind?\nThe first question might confuse the non-specialist. But as with most ancient Greek words, \"elpis\" can be translated a number of ways. A number of scholars prefer the neutral translation of \"expectation.\" But expectation of what? Classical authors use the word \"elpis\" to mean \"expectation of bad,\" as well as \"expectation of good.\" Statistical analysis demonstrates that the latter sense appears five times more than the former in all of ancient Greek literature. Others hold the minority view that \"elpis\" should be rendered, \"expectation of evil\" (\"vel sim\").\nHow one answers the first question largely depends on the answer to the second question: should we interpret the jar to function as a prison, or a pantry? The jar certainly serves as a prison for the evils that Pandora released \u2013 they only affect mankind once outside the jar. Some have argued that logic dictates, therefore, that the jar acts as a prison for \"Elpis\" as well, withholding it from men. If one takes \"elpis\" to mean expectant hope, then the myth's tone is pessimistic: All the evils in the world were scattered from Pandora's jar, while the one potentially mitigating force, Hope, remains locked securely inside.\nThis interpretation raises yet another question, complicating the debate: are we to take Hope in an absolute sense, or in a narrow sense where we understand Hope to mean hope only as it pertains to the evils released from the jar? If Hope is imprisoned in the jar, does this mean that human existence is utterly hopeless? This is the most pessimistic reading possible for the myth. A less pessimistic interpretation (still pessimistic, to be sure) understands the myth to say: countless evils fled Pandora's jar and plague human existence; the hope that we might be able to master these evils remains imprisoned inside the jar. Life is not hopeless, but each of us is hopelessly human.\nIt is also argued that hope was simply one of the evils in the jar, the false kind of hope, and was no good for mankind, since, later in the poem, Hesiod writes that hope is empty (498) and no good (500) and makes mankind lazy by taking away his industriousness, making him prone to evil.\nIn \"Human, All Too Human\", philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche argued that \"Zeus did not want man to throw his life away, no matter how much the other evils might torment him, but rather to go on letting himself be tormented anew. To that end, he gives man hope. In truth, it is the most evil of evils because it prolongs man's torment.\"\nAn objection to the \"hope is good/the jar is a prison\" interpretation counters that, if the jar is full of evils, then what is expectant hope \u2013 a blessing \u2013 doing among them? This objection leads some to render \"elpis\" as the expectation of evil, which would make the myth's tone somewhat optimistic: although humankind is troubled by all the evils in the world, at least we are spared the continual expectation of evil, which would make life unbearable.\nThe optimistic reading of the myth is expressed by M. L. West. \"Elpis\" takes the more common meaning of expectant hope. And while the jar served as a prison for the evils that escaped, it thereafter serves as a residence for Hope. West explains, \"It would be absurd to represent either the presence of ills by their confinement in a jar or the presence of hope by its escape from one.\" Hope is thus preserved as a benefit for humans.\nAll-giving Pandora: a mythic inversion.\nAn incorrect etymology of Pandora's name, \"all-gifted\", was provided in \"Works and Days\". Pandora means \"all-giving\", but not \"all-gifted.\" Some paintings in vases, from the fifth century before Christ, indicate that the beliefs about the goddess Pandora lasted after the time of Hesiod. Another name of Pandora was found in a kylix (circa 460 BC), \"Anesidora\", that means \"she who sends up gifts.\" This vase painting depicts Hephaestus and Athenae finishing the touches on the first woman, like in the \"Theogony\". The epithet \"anesidora\" is also used to name Gaia or Demeter.\nPandora/Anesidora possibly would have taken on aspects of Gaea and Demeter. Pandora would incarnate the fertility of the Earth and its capacity to bear grain and fruits for the benefit of the Humans. Over time this \"all-giving\" goddess somehow devolved into an \"all-gifted\" mortal woman. T. A. Sinclair, commenting on \"Works and Days\" argues that Hesiod shows no awareness of the mythology of such a divine \"giver\". A.H. Smith, however, notes that in Hesiod's account Athena and the Seasons brought wreaths of grass and spring flowers to Pandora, indicating that Hesiod was conscious of Pandora's original \"all-giving\" function. Jane Ellen Harrison sees in Hesiod's story \"evidence of a shift from matriarchy to patriarchy in Greek culture. As the life-bringing goddess Pandora is eclipsed, the death-bringing human Pandora arises.\" Thus Harrison concludes \"in the patriarchal mythology of Hesiod her great figure is strangely changed and diminished. She is no longer Earth-Born, but the creature, the handiwork of Olympian Zeus.\" (Harrison 1922:284) Robert Graves, quoting Harrison, asserts of the Hesiodic episode that \"Pandora is not a genuine myth, but an anti-feminist fable, probably of his own invention.\" H.J.Rose wrote that the myth of Pandora is decidedly more illiberal than that of epic in that it makes Pandora the origin of all of Man's woes with her being the exemplification of the bad wife.\nThe Hesiodic myth did not, however, completely obliterate the memory of the all-giving goddess Pandora. A scholium to line 971 of Aristophanes' \"The Birds\" mentions a cult \"to Pandora, the earth, because she bestows all things necessary for life\".\nIn fifth-century Athens Pandora made a prominent appearance in what, at first, appears an unexpected context, in a marble relief or bronze appliqu\u00e9s as a frieze along the base of the \"Athena Parthenos\" the culminating experience on the Acropolis; there Jeffrey M. Hurwit has interpreted her presence as an \"anti-Athena\" reinforcing civic ideologies of patriarchy and the \"highly gendered social and political realities of fifth-century Athens.\" Interpretation has never come easy: Pausanias (i.24.7) merely noted the subject and moved on. Jeffrey Hurwit has argued that Pandora represents an \"anti-Athena\", similarly a child of no mother, an embodiment of the need for the patriarchal rule that the virginal Athena, rising above her sex, defended.\n\"Pithos\" into \"box\".\nThe humanist Erasmus of Rotterdam translated Hesiod from Greek to Latin, in the 16th century. The Greek word \"pithos\" is used for a large jar, used for example for storing wine. It can also refer to a funerary jar. \"Pyxis\", on the other hand, is a box. Usually, it is said that Erasmus swapped the words when he translated, so Pandora's \"jar\" became Pandora's box. The phrase \"Pandora's box\" has endured ever since."}

It has the characteristic of thixotropy: it looks solid, but when pressure is applied it liquifies (acts like a liquid). If animals or people stand on it, they sink into it. However, a person does not drown in quicksand. A human or animal does not sink entirely into quicksand due to the higher density of the fluid. It can be difficult to get out: that is the real problem. Quicksand may be escaped by slow movement of the legs in order to reduce viscosity of the fluid, and rotating the body so as to float on one's back (supine).\nWater circulation underground can focus in an area with just the right mixture of fine sands and other materials such as clay. The water moves up and then down slowly in a convection-like manner throughout a column of sand, and the sand remains a generally solid mass. This lubricates the sand particles and makes them unable to support any significant weight, since they move around with very little friction. They behave more like a liquid when exposed to stress. Since the water does not usually go all the way up through the sand, the sand above does not appear to move at all, and can support leaves and other small debris. This makes it difficult to distinguish quicksand from the surrounding environment. \nProperties.\nQuicksand is a non-Newtonian fluid: when undisturbed it often seems to be solid (\"gel\" form), but a small (less than 1%) change in the stress on the quicksand causes it to turn liquid (\"sol\" form). There is a sudden decrease in its viscosity. Under his weight, the person then sinks into the sol (liquidised sand).\nSomeone stepping in it starts to sink. Around the person dense regions of sand and sediment form and grip the person. The viscosity of the quicksand seems to increase suddenly. It is now a gel. In order to move within the quicksand, a person or object must apply sufficient pressure on the compacted sand to re-introduce enough water to liquify it. The forces required to do this are quite large: to remove a foot from quicksand at a speed of one centimeter per second would require the same amount of force as \"that needed to lift a medium-sized car\".\nIt was commonly believed that the behavior of quicksand was due solely to saturated or supersaturated suspensions of granules in water. Pressure from underground sources of water would separate and suspend the granular particles, reducing the friction between them. In 2005 it was been shown that the presence of salt is important. The stability of the colloidal quicksand is changed by the presence of salt. It increases the high viscosity regions of sediment responsible for quicksand's \"trapping\" power. Another finding was that a human cannot be drawn into a saltwater quicksand entirely.\nPrevalence.\nQuicksand may be found inland (on riverbanks, near lakes, or in marshes), or near the coast.\nOne region notorious for its quicksands is Morecambe Bay, Yorkshire. As the bay is very broad and shallow, a person trapped by the quicksand would be exposed to the danger of the returning tide, which can come in rapidly."}

The goal was to get more soldiers from occupied nations.

As a result, a few bugs remained in its memory when the Tournament started. These bugs stop Combot from mimicking more than one person\u2019s moves each time it starts up."}

Sometimes it is also called cache buffer, or disk cache, but these words should not be used, a disk buffer is not a cache. In early 2015, hard disks usually have between 16 and 128 megabytes of such memory.\nUses.\nReading or writing data.\nWhen writing data to the disk, the data needs to be written to a certain position on the disk. This is done by a component called disk read/write head. This head needs to be moved to (or near) the correct track. After some settling time the read head begins to pick up bits. Usually, the first sectors to be read are not the ones that have been requested by the operating system. The disk's embedded computer typically saves these unrequested sectors in the disk buffer, in case the operating system requests them later.\nSpeed.\nThe disk is attached to the computer by what is called an I/O interface. This interface almost always works at a different speed than that of the hard disk platter. In such a case, the disk buffer is used to store the data that comes from the disk, before it sent to the computer, or to store the data that comes from the computer before it can be written to the disk.\nCommand queuing.\nModern disks often have a feature called \"command queuing\" (This is called TCQ in SCSI disks, and NCQ in SATA disks). This means that many commands can be sent at the same time, and the hard disk will put them into the best order. To store the commands and re-order them, the hard disk needs the disk buffer"}

Later it was popular in French and English courts in the 17th and 18th centuries.

To dance a gavotte the dancers must cross their feet twice in each step pattern, with each step followed by a hop. Singers often provided the accompaniment, though dancers might also be accompanied by an ensemble of such instruments as a violin, a drum, bagpipes or shawm, a forerunner of the modern oboe.\nThe gavotte later became a musical, rather than a dance piece. In the Baroque period gavottes were mainly found in binary form. When composers began writing suites, six short dance based pieces, the gavotte usually was played between the sarabande and the gigue. The best known examples of the gavotte are found in the suites and partitas written by J.S.Bach. "}

Planets in these areas are the most likely to have extraterrestrial life.\nThe habitable zone may also be called the \"life zone\", \"comfort zone\", \"green belt\" or \"Goldilocks zone\". One in five stars has an Earth-sized planet in the habitable zone. However, it is not known what proportion would have conditions suitable for life.\nGoldilocks planet.\nThe Goldilocks principle or 'Goldilocks effect' is that something must be within limits: \"not too hot, not too cold, but just right\".\nIt is taken from a children's story \"The Three Bears\" in which a little girl named Goldilocks finds a house owned by three bears. Each bear has their own preference of food, beds, etc. After testing each of the three items, Goldilocks determines that one of them is always too much in one extreme (too hot, too large, etc.), one is too much in the opposite extreme (too cold, too small, etc.), and one is \"just right\".\nIn astrobiology, the Goldilocks zone refers to the habitable zone around a star. A planet must neither be too far away from, nor too close to a star and galactic centre to support life. Either extreme would prevent a planet evolving life. \nSuch a planet is colloquially called a \"Goldilocks planet\".\nMethodology.\nCircumstellar habitable zone.\nIn a solar system, astronomers believe a planet must be in the habitable zone to have life. The circumstellar habitable zone is an area around a star where a planet would be able to have liquid water. Liquid water may be necessary for all forms of life.\nBigger stars are generally hotter, so the circumstellar habitable zone would be farther away from the star than for the Sun. Smaller stars are cooler, so the circumstellar habitable zone would be closer to the star than for the Sun. The size and brightness of a star determine where the circumstellar habitable zone is found around the star.\nPlanets are evaluated on these seven criteria:\nGalactic habitable zone.\nThis concept is not so widely used. It is the idea that a solar system must also be in a suitable place inside a galaxy for life to form.\nSome areas of galaxies are better suited to life than others. The Solar System in which we live, in the Orion Spur, on the Milky Way galaxy's edge is a life-favorable spot, since we are there.\nOverview.\nThe habitable zone is the region around a star where a planet has sufficient atmospheric pressure to keep liquid water on its surface.\nA \"habitable planet candidate\" implies a terrestrial planet within the zone, and with conditions roughly comparable to those of the Earth (i.e. an Earth analog) and thus potentially favourable to life.\nOnly about a dozen planets have been confirmed in the habitable zone, but the Kepler spacecraft has identified a further 54 candidates. Estimates suggest that there are \"at least 500 million\" such planets in the Milky Way.\nList of habitable planet candidates.\nThe table can be sorted by clicking the \"up\" or \"down\" arrows."}

He also was a member of the German Reichstag, where he was a minister from 1933 to 1934. He was murdered during the Night of the Long Knives, in 1934. Adolf Hitler gave the order to murder R\u00f6hm.\nDuring the First World War, R\u00f6hm fought as an officer. He was awarded the Iron Cross First Class.\nEarly life.\nErnst R\u00f6hm was born in Munich on 28 November 1887. He was the third child of a chief train inspector, Julius R\u00f6hm, and his wife, Emilie R\u00f6hm. He had one older brother and one older sister. His sister's son was Bernhard Lippert, a German diplomat.\nIn 1906, after his Abitur (school exams) in Munich, R\u00f6hm joined the Bavarian army as a Fanjunkare. Two years later he became a Lieutenant.\nFirst World War.\nIn 1914, at the beginning of the First World War, he was an adjutant and fought on the Western Front. He was wounded three times, and was awarded the Iron Cross First Class. He was badly hurt in that year and lost a piece of his nasal bone. He worked for the Bavarian government in the War Department for the first time. Two years later, in 1918, he was given the rank of a captain (German: \"Hauptmann\").\nAfter the First World War, R\u00f6hm went to the Freikorps (Free Corps) of Franz Ritter von Epp. He wanted to fight against the Communists in Munich. With this group, he went to fight against the Bavarian Soviet Republic. In July 1919, the Freikorps became part of the Reichswehr.\nInvolvement in the Nazi Party.\nIn 1919, R\u00f6hm joined the German Workers' Party (German: \"Deutsche Arbeiter Partei (DAP)\"). This was the precursor of the Nazi party. One year later, he became a member of the German Nazi Party. He received the membership number 623. R\u00f6hm helped Hitler establish relationships with the Bavarian politicians and the industrialists. Two years later, R\u00f6hm and Hitler started the Sturmabteilung (SA), attracting many men from the Freikorps. It was founded as a paramilitary group for the German Nazi Party. Hitler made R\u00f6hm the leader of the SA.\nR\u00f6hm took a part in the Beer Hall Putsch in 1923. The Nazi Party tried to overthrow the government, but failed. R\u00f6hm was arrested and charged with high treason. The judges decided he was guilty on 1 April 1924. R\u00f6hm went to prison for five months and lost his job in the army. Following the court trial, both the Nazi Party and the Sturmabteilung became illegal.\nIn 1924, R\u00f6hm helped start the \"Frontbann\", an alternative to the Sturmabteilung. After an argument with Adolf Hitler, R\u00f6hm retired as leader of the SA. He said that he was only a soldier and not a politician. Between 1928 and 1930, he worked for the Bolivian military as an advisor.\nLeader of the Sturmabteilung.\nOn 1 November 1930, he went back to Germany and joined the Nazi Party a second time. In January 1931, Adolf Hitler placed R\u00f6hm in charge of the Sturmabteilung. In just over a year, he expanded it from 70,000 to 170,000 members. In April 1932, Chancellor Heinrich Br\u00fcning banned the SA again. Franz von Papen, who was chancellor after Heinrich Br\u00fcning, annulled the ban in June. In 1933, Ernst R\u00f6hm became a \"Reichsminister\", a minister of the Reichstag. In 1934, the SA had over 4,500,000 members. The power of the SA increased. Because of this, Adolf Hitler and the Schutzstaffel (SS) started a new dispute with R\u00f6hm. The SA was about 20 times greater in membership than the \"Reichswehr\"; R\u00f6hm was dreaming to take over the \"Reichswehr\".\nHitler was afraid of R\u00f6hm's power. R\u00f6hm wanted to merge the Sturmabteilung with the general army, with him as leader. He also wanted a \"second Nazi revolution\" to make Germany more socialist. He was an anticapitalist, and at this time, Hitler was trying to befriend Germany's industrialists. Hitler planned to kill R\u00f6hm.\nNight of the Long Knives.\nR\u00f6hm arranged with Hitler that the Sturmabteilung would get four weeks holiday during the summer of 1934. The holiday started on 1 July 1934. R\u00f6hm wanted to go to Bad Wiessee for rest. On 29 June 1934, R\u00f6hm was arrested, yet had no trial. He was given the choice by Theodor Eicke: to commit suicide or be killed. On 1 July, Theodor Eicke shot R\u00f6hm as instructed by Hitler. R\u00f6hm was buried in the Munich western cemetery.\nMany Sturmabteilung leaders were killed on that same night, mostly by the Schutzstaffel and Gestapo. It was called the \"Night of the Long Knives\". The next day the German parliament passed a law with only one paragraph making the murders at the Night of the Long Knives legal."}

In most cases it involves whole familles or clans. People are seen as guilty, not because they did something, but because they were seen with other people (who are considered guilty). This is called guilt by association.\nFeuds start because one party thinks they were attacked, insulted, or otherwise harmed by the other party. Intense feelings of resentment trigger the initial revenge, which causes the other party to feel the same way. The dispute is then fueled by a long-running cycle of retaliatory violence. This ongoing cycle of provocation and retaliation makes it very difficult to end the feud peacefully. Feuds frequently involve the original parties' family members and/or associates. They can last for generations.\nUp to the early modern period, feuds were considered legitimate legal instruments. The state or ruler even made laws for certain aspects of feuds. Once modern centralizing states asserted and enforced a monopoly on legitimate use of force, feuds became illegal and the concept acquired its current negative connotation.\nBlood feuds/vendetta.\nA blood feud is a feud with a cycle of retaliatory violence, with the relatives of someone who has been killed or otherwise wronged or dishonored. The wronged person then wants vengeance and kills the culprits or punishes them in other ways. If he cannot get the culprits, he does this to their relatives. Historically, the word vendetta has been used to mean a blood feud. The word is Italian, and originates from the Latin \"vindicta\", \"vengeance.\" In modern times, the word also means any other long-standing feud, not necessarily involving bloodshed.\nVendetta history.\nOriginally, a vendetta was a blood feud between two families. Kinsmen of the victim wanted to take revenge for his or her death by killing either those responsible for the killing or some of their relatives. Usually, the closest male relative of the person killed or wronged maintains the vendetta, but other members of the family may do so as well. If the culprit had disappeared or was already dead, the vengeance could extend to other relatives.\nVendetta is typical of societies with a weak rule of law or in those where the state does not consider itself responsible for helping with this kind of dispute. In such societies, family and kinship ties are the main source of authority. An entire family is considered responsible for whatever one of them has done. Sometimes even two separate branches of the same family could come to blows over some matter.\nToday, the practice of vendetta has almost disappeared in societies where law enforcement works. There, criminal law punishes lawbreakers.\nIn ancient Homeric Greece, the practice of personal vengeance against wrongdoers was considered natural and customary: \"Embedded in the Greek morality of retaliation is the right of vendetta . . . Vendetta is a war, just as war is an indefinite series of vendettas; and such acts of vengeance are sanctioned by the gods\".\nThe Ancient Hebrew tribes considered it to be the duty of the individual and family to avenge evil in God's name. The person who put the initial aggressive killer to death was given a special name: \"go'el haddam\", the blood-avenger or blood-redeemer (Num. 35: 19, etc.). Six cities of refuge were made to provide a \"cooling off\" phase as well as due process for the accused. As the \"Oxford Companion to the Bible\" states: \"Since life was viewed as sacred (Gen. 9.6), no amount of blood money could be given as recompense for the loss of the life of an innocent person; it had to be 'life for life'\" (Exod. 21.23; Deut. 19.21)\".\nAccording to medievalist Marc Bloch, \"The Middle Ages, from beginning to end, and particularly the feudal era, lived under the sign of private vengeance. The onus, of course, lay above all on the wronged individual; vengeance was imposed on him as the most sacred of duties ... The solitary individual, however, could do but little. Moreover, it was most commonly a death that had to be avenged. In this case the family group went into action and the \"faide\" (feud) came into being, to use the old Germanic word which spread little by little through the whole of Europe--'the vengeance of the kinsmen which we call \"faida\"', as a German canonist expressed it. No moral obligation seemed more sacred than this ... The whole kindred, therefore, placed as a rule under the command of a chieftain, took up arms to punish the murder of one of its members or merely a wrong that he had suffered\" (Marc Bloch, trans. L. A. Manyon, \"Feudal Society\", Vol. I, 1965, p.\u00a0125-126).\nThe Celtic phenomenon of the \"blood feud\" demanded \"an eye for an eye,\" and usually descended into murder. Disagreements between clans might last for generations in Scotland and Ireland. Due to the Celtic heritage of many whites living in Appalachia, a series of prolonged violent engagements in late- nineteenth-century Kentucky and West Virginia were referred to commonly as feuds, a tendency that was partly due to the nineteenth-century popularity of William Shakespeare and Sir Walter Scott, authors who both wrote semihistorical accounts of blood feuds. These incidents, the most famous of which was the Hatfield-McCoy feud, were regularly featured in the newspapers of the eastern U.S. between the 1880s and the early twentieth century. Although they were interpreted as such at the time, there is little reason to believe that these American incidents had any correlation to \"feuding\" in Europe centuries earlier.\nChariot racing in the Byzantine Empire also included the racing clubs. The Blues and the Greens were more than simply sports teams. They gained influence in military, political, and theological matters. The Blue-Green rivalry often erupted into gang warfare, and street violence had been on the rise in the reign of Justin I. Riots culminated in the Nika riots of 532 AD during the reign of Justinian I, with nearly half the city being burned or destroyed and tens of thousands of people killed.\nThe Central Asian plateau (north of China) at the time of Genghis Khan's youth was divided into several nomadic tribes or confederations\u2014among them Naimans, Merkits, Uyghurs, Tatars, Mongols, and Keraits\u2014that were all prominent in their own right and often unfriendly toward each other, as evidenced by frequent raids, revenges, and plundering.\nIn Japan's feudal past the Samurai class upheld the honor of their family, clan, or their lord by \"katakiuchi\" (), or revenge killings. These killings could also involve the relatives of an offender. While some vendettas were punished by the government, such as that of the 47 Ronin, others were given official permission with specific targets.\nAt the Holy Roman Empire's \"Reichstag\" at Worms in 1495 the right of waging feuds was abolished. The Imperial Reform proclaimed an \"eternal public peace\" (\"Ewiger Landfriede\") to put an end to the abounding feuds and the anarchy of the robber barons and it defined a new standing imperial army to enforce that peace. However, it took a few more decades until the new regulation was universally accepted. In 1506, for example, knight Jan Kopidlansky killed somebody in Prague and the Town Councillors sentenced him to death and had him executed. Brother Jiri Kopidlansky revenged himself by continuing atrocities.\nMore than a third of the Ya\u0327nomam\u00f6 males, on average, died from warfare. The accounts of missionaries to the area have recounted constant infighting in the tribes for women or prestige, and evidence of continuous warfare for the enslavement of neighboring tribes such as the Macu before the arrival of European settlers and government.\nThe Clan Gordon was at one point one of the most powerful clans in middle Scotland. Clan feuds and battles were frequent, especially with the Clan Cameron, Clan Murray, Clan Forbes, and the Chattan Confederation.\nIn Corsica, vendetta was a social code that required Corsicans to kill anyone who wronged the family honor. It has been estimated that between 1683 and 1715, nearly 30,000 out of 120,000 Corsicans lost their lives to vendetta.\nThroughout history, the Maniots\u2014one of Greece's toughest populations\u2014have been known by their neighbors and their enemies as fearless warriors who practice blood feuds. Some vendettas went on for months and sometimes years. The families involved would lock themselves in their towers and when they got the chance would murder members of the opposing family.\nThe Basque Country in the Late Middle Ages was ravaged by bitter partisan wars between local ruling families. In Navarre, these conflicts became polarised in a violent struggle between the Agramont and Beaumont parties. In Biscay, the two major warring factions were named Oinaz and Gamboa. (\"Cf.\" the Guelphs and Ghibellines in Italy). High defensive structures (\"towers\") built by local noble families, few of which survive today, were frequently razed by fires, sometimes by royal decree.\nLeontiy Lyulye, an expert on conditions in the Caucasus, wrote in the mid-19th century: \"Among the mountain people the blood feud is not an uncontrollable permanent feeling such as the vendetta is among the Corsicans. It is more like an obligation imposed by the public opinion.\" In the Dagestani aul Kadar, one such blood feud between two antagonistic clans lasted for nearly 260 years, from the 17th century till the 1860s.\nAn alternative to feud was \"blood money\" (or \"weregild\" in the Norse culture), which demanded payment of some kind from those responsible for a wrongful death (even an accidental one). If these payments were not made or were refused by the offended party, a blood feud would ensue.\nVendetta in modern times.\nVendetta is reputedly still practiced in some areas in France (especially Corsica) and Italy (especially Sicily, Sardinia, Campania, Calabria, Apulia, and other areas of Southern Italy), in Crete (Greece), among Kurdish clans in Iraq and Turkey, in northern Albania, among Pashtuns in Afghanistan, among Somali clans, over land in Nigeria, in India (a caste-related feuds among rival Hindu groups), between rival tribes in the north-east Indian state of Assam, among rival clans in China and Philippines, among the Arab Bedouins and Arab tribes inhabiting the mountains of Yemen and between Shiites and Sunnis in Iraq, in southern Ethiopia, among the highland tribes of New Guinea, in Svaneti, in the mountainous areas of Dagestan, many northern areas of Georgia and Azerbaijan, a number of republics of the northern Caucasus and essentially among Chechen teips where those seeking retribution do not accept or respect the local law enforcement authority. Vendettas are generally abetted by a perceived or actual indifference on behalf of local law enforcement. \nIn Albania, the blood feud has returned in rural areas after more than 40 years of being abolished by Albanian communists led by Enver Hoxha. More than 5,500 Albanian families are currently engaged in blood feuds. There are now more than 20,000 men and boys who live under an ever-present death sentence because of blood feuds. Since 1992, at least 10,000 Albanians have been killed due to blood feuds.\nMutual vendetta may develop into a vicious circle of further killings, retaliation, counterattacks, and all-out warfare that can end in the mutual extinction of both families. Often the original cause is forgotten, and feuds continue simply because it is perceived that there has always been a feud.\nThere is a scene in \"The Godfather,\" in which Michael Corleone, hiding from U.S. police in Sicily, walks through a village with his two bodyguards. Michael asks, \"Where are all the men?\" The bodyguard replies, \"They're all dead from vendettas.\"\nIn the game \"\" by Rockstar, one of the main themes in the plot are continuous rivalries and vendettas between Italian Mafia families in Liberty City (based on New York City).\nSome of the gang wars between organized crime groups are effectively forms of vendetta, where the criminal organization (like the Mafia \"family\") has taken the place of blood relatives."}

The fires caused Australia's highest ever loss of life from a bushfire. Police say that 173 people died, and 414 people were taken to hospitals with bad burns. At first the death toll was thought to be 210, but forensic tests have shown there were 173 people killed and the death toll was revised.\nThe fires burnt down at least 2,029 homes, 3,500 buildings in total and damaged thousands. Many towns north-east of the state capital Melbourne were badly damaged or almost completely destroyed, including the Victorian towns of Kinglake, Marysville, Narbethong, Strathewen, and Flowerdale. Many houses in the Victorian towns of Steels Creek, Humevale, Wandong, St Andrews, Callignee, and Koornalla were also destroyed or damaged. There were people killed at each town. The fires affected 78 towns and left about 7,500 people homeless. More than 4,000 firemen and women worked to control and stop the fires. They were still burning more than two weeks after they started.\nMost of the fires started and spread on a day of some of the worst bushfire weather ever recorded. The temperature in Victoria reached 46 degrees Celsius and wind speed was more than 100\u00a0km/h. The wind blew the fires over large distances and areas, creating large firestorms. North-east of Melbourne, a single firestorm killed 120 people. A cool change hit the state in the early evening, but it had gale force south-westerly winds of more than 120\u00a0km/h. This change in wind direction caused the long eastern sides of the fires to become wide fire fronts that burned quickly towards towns that had earlier escaped the fires.\nMany of the fires were started by fallen or clashing power lines or were deliberately lit. There was also lightning, cigarette butts, and sparks from a power tool. A ten-year drought made the land and forests very dry and they burnt quickly. Finally, in early-mid March, the weather changed and the fire fighters were able to put out the fires.\nBackground.\nHeat wave.\nStarting at the end of January, south east Australia had days of very hot weather, called a heatwave. The heatwave was caused by a slow moving high-pressure system over the Tasman Sea, a big Tropical Cyclone off the north west Australian coast, and a monsoon trough over northern Australia. This caused hot tropical air to travel down over south eastern Australia.\nThe February fires started on the hottest day ever in Victoria, where temperature records have been kept since 1859. On 6 February 2009 \u2013 the day before the fires - Premier of Victoria John Brumby told people that very hot weather was coming, and that there was a big danger of bushfires. He told people to be very careful. Premier Brumby also said that it would be the \"worst day of fire conditions in the history of the state\".\nGippsland fires.\nAt the end of January, there were fires in the Gippsland area of Victoria. These included a small tree fire near Delburn, Victoria and one which nearly burnt a pine tree plantation.\nThere were two small grass fires near the city of Sale, Victoria, which were deliberately lit.\nOn 29 January, over 500 firemen fought the two fires at Delburn which had joined together into one big fire. The fires had burnt near Boolarra and Darlimurra, south of the city of Morwell. No buildings were burnt. A cool change in the weather on 30 January made it easier to fight the fires, but also made it windy, which led to spot fires (new, small fires from burning plants blown ahead). On the evening of 31 January, fire crews worked to stop the fire spreading to the north. They fought to protect the main power transmission lines taking electricity to Melbourne from the Latrobe Valley. The fire was also close to the Hazelwood Power Station, Victoria.\nBy February 1, firemen had made fire breaks (clear areas) around the Boolarra fire, although it was still burning out of control. The fire had burned through and destroyed 29 houses, farm buildings and animals. Police believed Delburn and Boolarra fires were deliberately lit. They offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of people who lit the fires.\nOn February 2, lightning started 23 new fires. This included three in the Bunyip State Park, and fires near Drouin West and Leongatha. However, increased humidity helped stop the fires spreading. On February 3, the Country Fire Authority grouped the fires into six areas. Five fires were under control, but one, near Mirboo North, was not.\nThe major fires include:\nNorth and central.\nKinglake fires.\nThe Kinglake fire, was named when two fires joined together after the wind changed direction on February 7 and 8. The fire had burned over by February 8. 147 people died in the Kinglake fire.\nThe first of the two fires started at Kilmore East, Victoria, on the afternoon February 7 2009, and burned south-east towards St. Andrews through Wandong and Clonbinane. The fire destroyed 30 houses at Wandong and Heathcote Junction on February 7. By February 8, 150 houses had been destroyed at Wandong, and four people killed. The fire closed the Seymour railway line, and parts of the Hume Highway near Kilmore. The north west winds blew the front of the fire towards St Andrews, before the weather changed about 7.30pm, changing the wind to the south west. The wind change turned the long, narrow fire, into a wide fire front that moved north east to Kinglake and Strathewen.\nBy the evening of February 8, 100 people who had escaped the Kilmore fire, were sheltering in a basketball stadium at Wallan. Many of them were unable to go back to their homes because the police had closed the roads.\nThe fire front burned through the Kinglake area on February 7. This was the worst fire area in the state, with 37 people killed, and more than 550 houses destroyed. Another 12 people died at Kinglake West, and in Strathewen, 27.\nThe second fire destroyed the town of Marysville, Victoria. It started north of Marysville, and at first people thought it would go around the town, but within minutes the town was an inferno. At about 5.00pm, electric power was lost, and the wind stopped. Minutes later the wind came back from a different direction, bringing the fire up the valley with it. Damage to the water treatment plant at Marysville made the water unsafe to drink. On February 11, it was said that 100 people of the town's population of 500 were believed to have died, and that only a few buildings were left. Premier Brumby said: \"There's no activity, there's no people, there's no buildings, there's no birds, there's no animals, everything's just gone.\" These numbers were later revised, but 40 people did die, and nearly every building in the town was damaged or destroyed.\nAbout 95% of the houses in Narbethong were destroyed. Other towns affected by the same fire included Taggerty and Buxton.\nTo the south west, the fire was burning on three sides of Yarra Glen, Victoria, trapping people in the town. Houses north of Yarra Glen were destroyed and large areas of grass lands were burnt.\nFor some time, the police believed that someone lit the fire that burnt Marysville, and several people were investigated. However, in June 2011, Victoria Police announced that this was probably not the cause.\nMaroondah/Yarra fires.\nThe Maroondah/Yarra fire was named on February 10, when several fires that had been burning to the east of Healesville, Victoria and Toolangi joined together. By late morning, the fire had burned , with 184 firemen and 56 fire trucks at the fire. While the temperature had cooled, strong winds blew embers and started new fires. Around midday, the danger to property around Healesville was downgraded, though the Department of Sustainability and Environment said that people should watch for changes in the weather.\nThe fires in the Maroondah/Yarra area continued to threaten the town of Healesville, Victoria until February 14.\nBeechworth fire.\nIn Beechworth, Victoria, a fire burnt more than and came near to the towns of Yackandandah, Stanley, Bruarong, Dederang, Kancoona, Kancoona South, Coralbank, Glen Creek, and Running Creek, Victoria. The fire started at 7.00pm on February 7, south of Beechworth, before being driven south through pine plantations by hot northerly winds.\nThe fire destroyed buildings at Mudgegonga, Victoria, south east of Beechworth; 2 people died. Thick smoke and clouds made it hard to work out the size of the Beechworth fire.\nStrong winds fed the fire on the night of February 8, and lightning started a new fire at Kergunyah around midday on February 9. More than 440 firemen worked to stop a new fire that threatened Gundowring, and Eskdale, Victoria after it jumped the Kiewa River. On the night of February 9, the greatest danger was to Eskdale. Fires were also burning in pine plantations from the large town of Myrtleford, at the opposite, western end of the fire area. While smaller towns to the east, including Gundowring and Kergunyah, were still threatened, the CFA said that there was no immediate danger to the larger towns of Beechworth and Yackandandah, on the northern edge of the fire area.\nBy February 10, firemen had completed a fire break around the Beechworth fire, and were trying to make more, as the fire still was burning out of control. By the afternoon, the fire threat had been downgraded, but firemen were fighting a new fire near Koetong, Victoria, east of the main Beechworth fire, of between to . People in Beechworth and nearby towns were told on the evening of February 10 to expect more smoke, as 250 firemen would be back burning to make more firebreaks.\nThe Beechworth Correctional Centre, a prison, offered up to thirty prisoners to help the firemen.\nBendigo fire.\nA fire west of the city of Bendigo burned out . The fire started at about 4.30pm on February 7, and burned through Long Gully and Eaglehawk, Victoria. It got to of central Bendigo, before it was brought under control late on February 8. It destroyed about 45 houses in Bendigo's western suburbs, and damaged an electricity transmission line; causing power failures in parts of the city. One man from Long Gully, ill and unable to leave his house, was killed in the fire;his neighbours tried hard but were not able to rescue him. The fire changed direction late on February 7, when the weather changed, and turned back towards Eaglehawk. It was controlled about midday on February 8.\nA relief centre was set up at Kangaroo Flat, Victoria Senior Citizens Centre. During the fire, people from Long Gully, Eaglehawk, Maiden Gully, California Gully and West Bendigo were moved from their homes and sent to the centre. The police are investigating whether someone had lit this fire. The CFA think the fire started from a cigarette thrown from a car or truck on the highway.\nRedesdale fire.\nIn Redesdale, a fire burnt . The fire started west of the town. The fire was close to the towns of Baynton and Glenhope. Glenhope was threatened again on February 9 from a smaller fire that broke away from the main fire. More firemen and trucks were brought in from Bendigo and Kyneton. By February 10, the fire had been controlled, having destroyed 12 houses and farm buildings.\nEast.\nBunyip fire.\nA fire at Bunyip State Park burned houses at Longwarry North, and Drouin West, Victoria, as well as farms and businesses, after the fire jumped the Princes Highway.\nThe fire was stopped by the afternoon of February 9, after it had burned through . The fire destroyed at least eight houses, other buildings and a factory. Fire crews began back-burning to stop the fire on February 9. People between Pakenham and Warragul, Victoria were warned about smoke from those fires.\nMany farmers, unable to keep animals on their farms because of fire damage, took them to nearby saleyards; by February 9, hundreds of cattle from the Bunyip fire were taken to the saleyards at Pakenham.\nChurchill fire.\nThe Churchill fire began in a pine plantation south-east of Churchill, Victoria on the afternoon of February 7. Within 30\u00a0minutes it had spread to the south-east, near Hazelwood South, Traralgon South, Jeeralang, and Budgeree East, Victoria. By late afternoon the fire was near Yarram and Woodside, Victoria on the south Gippsland coast. The weather changed about 6.00pm, and the south west winds then pushed the fire north east towards Gormandale and Willung South on the Hyland Highway. About 500 people sheltered at a theatre in Traralgon.\nThe fire came close to the Loy Yang Power Station, and the station's open-cut coal mine. On the night of February 7, the fire approached the mine's overburden dump, but did not damage anything and did not stop the station's operations. Several small fires broke out in the bunker storing coal from the mine, but were contained with no damage. The threat eased by the evening of February 8, as temperatures cooled and some light rain fell. One small fire started south of the power station, but water bombing aircraft put it out.\nBy February 9, the Churchill fire was still burning out of control, with fronts through the Latrobe Valleyand the Strzelecki Ranges. By late afternoon, the fire had burnt out and killed several people. Wind changes that evening made parts of the fire worse, so the CFA warned people at Won Wron and nearby areas to be ready.\nPolice believe someone lit the Churchill fire. A man from Churchill was arrested by police on February 12. He was charged on February 13, with arson causing death, lighting a bushfire and having child pornography.\nDandenong Ranges fires.\nA fire started at Ferntree Gully and Upper Ferntree Gully, in the Dandenong Ranges. All major roads were closed. The fire damaged the railway track at Upper Ferntree Gully, causing the Belgrave railway line to be closed. The fire, which was controlled by firemen within three hours, burned along the railway.\nA house fire started on the morning of February 12, in Upper Ferntree Gully, killing a volunteer fireman from the CFA. Police think the fire was deliberately lit.\nNarre Warren.\nIn Narre Warren there were several fires. Six homes were destroyed in Narre Warren South and three in Narre Warren North.\nWilsons Promontory.\nOn February 8, lightning started a fire at Wilsons Promontory which quickly burnt over . This fire did not threaten the camping area but the National Park rangers decided to evacuate the park; some campers were taken out by boat. The fire continued to burn out of control for more than 10 days. By February 17 it had burned an area of including the air strip and cutting the main road.\nWest.\nHorsham fire.\nThe Horsham fire burnt , including the golf club and eight homes. The Dimboola fire appliance (utility) was also damaged.\nThe fire started at 12.30pm on February 7, when strong winds blew over a power pole at Remlaw, west of the city. The fire first went south-west and then south-east, across the Wimmera Highway and Wimmera River to the Horsham Golf Course and then to Haven, south of the city. Firemen were able to save the general store, town hall and school at Haven, though flames came within metres of those buildings. Winds of up to changed direction three times during the day, and caused conditions described by a CFA fireman as the worst he had ever seen. A taxi driver picked up an 82-year-old wheelchair-bound woman and her daughter, from her house as the fire was no more than away; the house was alight as the taxi drove off, and burned down within minutes.\nAt 3.00pm more than 400 firemen were fighting the fire, as well as two water-bombing aircraft, 54 Country Fire Authority (CFA) fire trucks, and 35 Department of Sustainability and the Environment (DSE) fire crews. By 6.00pm the fire had moved east, and as the wind changed, was then pushed north-east across the Western Highway to Drung, east of Horsham.\nColeraine fire.\nAt Coleraine were burnt; one man was badly burned.\nResponses.\nFire fighting.\nThe Country Fire Authority (CFA) puts out fires on private property. The Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE) puts out fires on public land. These organisations worked together to fight all these fires. Most men and women from the CFA were trained volunteers; there were more than 4,000 of them involved.\nIn addition to CFA and DSE firefighters, Prime Minister 'Mr Kev' offered assistance from the Australian Defence Forces. New South Wales, South Australia, Australian Capital Territory, Tasmania and Western Australia sent firemen and equipment.\nThe Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom and New Zealand offered help to the Australian government. New Zealand sent 100 firemen and forest fire experts. They would have sent more but did not because of the danger of fires in parts of New Zealand. New Zealand also sent a Mil Mi-8MTV-1 helicopter which can carry 5000 litres of water.\nConsequences.\nDeaths and injuries.\n173 people are known to have been killed by the fires. The death toll used to be at 210, but forensics found that a lot of the human remains that were thought to have been of two or more people were of one person.\nBrian Naylor, a famous retired television news reader, and his wife Moiree, died in the Kinglake West area. Actor Reg Evans and his partner, artist Angela Brunton, who lived on a small farm in the St. Andrews area, also died in the Kinglake area fire. Ornithologist Richard Zann died in the Kinglake fire, with his wife Eileen and daughter Eva.\nOver 500 people were treated for burns with 100 people were sent to hospital.\nA temporary morgue to hold up to 300 bodies, was set up at the Coronial Services Centre at Southbank in Melbourne. This was like the one set up after the July 2005 London bombings. A number of different funeral homes helped take bodies to Melbourne. By February 10, 101 bodies had been taken to the temporary morgue. There were more than 50 unnamed bodies kept in the morgue or still at the fire areas. The director of the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine said that it may be impossible to discover the names of all the bodies.\nOn February 11, Police Commissioner Nixon said she hoped that searches for bodies would be over by February 15. Because there might be asbestos in some of the destroyed buildings, the search would be slow.\nPeople from other countries were killed in these bushfires, including:"}

It is used for inventory control or timing sporting events. RFID is not a replacement for barcoding, but a complement for distant reading of codes.\nThe technology is used for automatically identifying a person, a package or an item. To do this, it relies on \"RFID tags\". These are small \"transponders\" (combined radio \"receiver\" and \"transmitter\") that will transmit identity information over a short distance, when asked. The other piece to make use of RFID tags is an RFID tag reader.\nAn RFID tag is an object that can be applied to or incorporated into a product, animal, or person for the purpose of identification and tracking using radio waves. Some tags can be read from several meters away and beyond the line of sight of the reader. Most tags carry a plain text inscription and a barcode as complements for direct reading and for cases of any failure of radio frequency electronics.\nMost RFID tags contain at least two parts. One is an integrated circuit for storing and processing information, modulating and de-modulating a \"radio-frequency\" (RF) signal, and other specialized functions. The second is an antenna for receiving and transmitting the signal.\nThere are generally two types of RFID tags: active RFID tags, which contain a battery, and passive RFID tags, which have no batteries\nUses.\nRFID systems are used for the following:"}

Opal was the strongest hurricane of the 1995 Atlantic hurricane season. It crossed the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula while still a tropical depression from September 27, then strengthened northward in the Gulf, becoming the most powerful Category 4 Atlantic hurricane before making a second landfall, October 4, in the Florida Panhandle near Pensacola as a 125-mph (201-km/h) hurricane. Opal devastated the Pensacola/Panhandle area with a 15-ft (5-m) storm surge and travelled up the entire state of Alabama, becoming a tropical storm in Tennessee. Opal also caused heavy damage in the mid-Atlantic states before dissipating.\nAfterward, 50\u00a0people had died from flooding by Opal in Guatemala and Mexico, with another 13 deaths in the United States directly or indirectly related to Opal. Preliminary damage estimates were $3\u00a0billion.\nMeteorological history.\nThe beginning of this storm started from a tropical wave that moved off of Africa on September 11. It disappeared into a low pressure while in the Caribbean Sea several days later. The wave was found again on September 27 and was good enough to become Tropical Depression Eighteen. Tropical Depression Eighteen made landfall in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula shortly afterword. On September 30 Tropical Depression Eighteen strengthened into Tropical Storm Opal. Tropical Storm Opal continued west until October 2. On October 2 it turned northeast and strengthened into Hurricane Opal. After that Hurricane Opal strengthened fast and reached it's top winds of 150\u00a0mph (making it a category 4) on October 4, only two days after becoming a hurricane. Hurricane Opal continued northeast and weakened a little and made its last landfall in Santa Rosa Island, Florida on October 4 while a category 3 hurricane. Hurricane Opal became a tropical storm over central Alabama and did not weaken to a tropical depression till it was in Tennessee.

Although he was involved in the killing of thousands of people in Poland and Russia, he was never charged with war crimes.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nHis parents were Otto Jan J\u00f3zefat von Zelewski, a Roman Catholic, and his wife Elisabeth Eveline Schimansky, a Lutheran. His name when he was born was Erich Julius Eberhard von Zelewski. He later changed his last name to add \"von dem Bach\" in the 1930s. He removed \"Zelewski\" from his name in November 1941 because of its Polish sound.\nHe was born in Lauenburg, in Pomerania, in the old German Empire (now called L\u0119bork, Poland), on 1 March 1899. His family did not have very much money during his childhood. His father was often out of work. When his father died on April 17, 1911, in Dortmund, he was employed as an insurance clerk. His father's lack of success was partly because he was the brother of Emil von Zalewski, the leader of a colonial force fighting in Tanzania. On August 17, 1891, he and his men were killed in the battle of Rugarto, described as being like a German Custer at the Battle of Little Bighorn. This death and defeat brought great shame to the family. Erich would later restore his family's position in the community.\nSoldier.\nAfter his father's death, his uncle Oskar von Zalewski, a soldier, became very close to Erich and told Erich to become a soldier. In November 1914 Erich von Zalewski asked to join the Prussian army, and was one of the youngest soldiers and remained a soldier fighting for the army until the end of World War I. He was wounded twice, and was given the Cross of Honor (Ehrenkreuz) and then Iron Cross.\nAfter the war, he stayed in the army and fought in the Silesian Uprisings, where he earned a reputation (what other people believe about a person) for courage. He was given more medals. In 1924, he joined \"Grenzschutz\" (border guards). On October 23, 1925, he changed his last name to `von dem Bach-Zalewski`.\nNazi.\nHe left the \"Grenzschutz\" in 1930, when he joined the Nazi Party, becoming a member of the SS in 1931. He was quickly promoted and by the end of 1933 had reached the rank of \"SS-Brigadef\u00fchrer\". However, he quarreled with his staff officer Anton von Hohberg und Buchwald.\nThree of his sisters married Jewish men, and in 1946 he said that this ruined his reputation in the army and he was forced to leave.\nHe was a member of the Reichstag from 1932 to 1944, he took part in the Night of the Long Knives in 1934, and had Anton von Hohberg und Buchwald murdered. He served in many Nazi party jobs, first in East Prussia and after 1936 in Silesia. By 1937 he had become the \"H\u00f6herer SS- und Polizeif\u00fchrer\" (\"HSSPF\" \u2013 Higher SS and Police Leader) in Silesia.\nWorld War II.\nAfter the war started, units under his command took part in revenge and in the shooting of POWs during the September Campaign, but von dem Bach was not there in person. On 7 November 1939, the SS chief Heinrich Himmler asked him if he wanted the job of \"Commissioner for the Strengthening of Germandom\" in Silesia. His duty was to force people to leave and to take their property. By August 1940, his units had forced more than 20,000 \u017bywiec families to leave their homes.\nIn late 1939, he suggested starting a concentration camp for the non-German people who lived in the town of O\u015bwi\u0119cim. Heinrich Himmler agreed to von dem Bach's suggestion and in May 1940 the Auschwitz concentration camp opened.\nGetting higher rank.\nOn 22 June 1941, von dem Bach-Zelewski became \"HSSPF\" in the \"Heeresgruppe Mitte\" (Army Group Center); in July 1943, he became commander of the \"Bandenk\u00e4mpfverb\u00e4nde\" (\"Band-fighting Units\"), that carried out the mass murder of 35,000 people in Riga and more than 200,000 in Belarus and eastern Poland. The government was going to make him the future \"HSSPF\" in Moscow; however, the Wehrmacht did not get into the city. Until 1943, von dem Bach-Zalewski was the \"HSSPF\" in command of \"anti-partisan\" units on the \"central front\", a special command created by Adolf Hitler. Von dem Bach-Zalewski was the only \"HSSPF\" in the Soviet areas taken over by the Germans to have real authority over the police after Hans-Adolf Pr\u00fctzmann and Jockeln lost theirs to the civil government.\nIn February 1942, he was put into hospital, which he would later say was due to a nervous breakdown because of the ethnic cleansing in Belarus, and the genocide of the Jews. Radio signals overheard by British intelligence say, however, that his illness was physical. He went back to his job in July, with no reduction seen in his actions.\nIn June 1942, after the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich in Prague, Adolf Hitler wanted von dem Bach-Zelewski to take Heydrich's job as Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia. When Himmler said that von dem Bach-Zelewski was needed due to the situation in Belarus, Hitler let him stay and gave the job to Kurt Daluege.\nOn 12 July 1943, von dem Bach-Zalewski was given command of all anti-partisan efforts in Belgium, Belarus, France, the General Government, the Netherlands, Norway, Ukraine, Yugoslavia, and parts of the Bialystok District. In reality he remained only in Belarus and the area of Russia near Belarus.\nFighting on the front line.\nIn 1944, von dem Bach-Zalewski took part in front line fighting in the Kovel area, but in March had to go to Germany for medical treatment. Himmler took over all his jobs.\nOn 2 August 1944, he took command of all soldiers fighting against the Warsaw Uprising as \"Korpsgruppe Bach\". Units under his command killed about 200,000 people including more than 65,000 executions, and an unknown number of POWs. After more than two months of heavy fighting and the total destruction of Warsaw he then was able to control the city. For what he did in Warsaw, the Nazi Government gave him the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross on September 30, 1944.\nAfter the war.\nVon dem Bach-Zelewski went into hiding and tried to leave the country. However, US military police arrested him on 1 August, 1945. Because he told the Allies what he knew about his former bosses at the Nuremberg Trials, von dem Bach-Zelewski never went to trial himself for any war crimes. He also did not have to go back to Poland or to the USSR to be tried. He left prison in 1949.\nIn 1951, von dem Bach-Zalewski said that he had helped Hermann G\u00f6ring kill himself in 1946. To make people believe this he showed them the cyanide with serial numbers like the ones that were on the cyanide that G\u00f6ring used. This was never proven. Today people who study history do not believe this happened.\nAlso in 1951, von dem Bach was told he would go to a work prison for ten years for the murder of people in the early 1930s; but he did not go until 1958, when he was found guilty of killing Anton von Hohberg und Buchwald, an SS officer on the Night of the Long Knives and was sentenced to four and a half years in prison. In 1961, he received an extra ten years where he had to stay in his home all the time for the murder of ten German Communists in the early 1930s. He never went to prison for crimes during the war even though he openly said he murdered Jews. He died in a Munich prison on 8 March 1972.\nIt has been said that Hitler really liked von dem Bach-Zalewski because he was very good at his job and said that von dem Bach was \"so clever he can do anything, get around anything.\""}

{"id": "166913", "revid": "209999", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=166913", "title": "Specialized English", "text": "Specialized English is a controlled version of the English language used for radio broadcasting, easier for non-native speakers of English. It is based on Voice of America (VoA) Special English.\nSpecialized English was set up initially by Feba Radio in the UK. Feba now uses Specialized English with US radio companies Words of Hope and Back to God Ministries International. All three are Christian, but Specialized English is not used for religious preaching programs. Its main use is in the features service program 'Spotlight', which is widely broadcast on over sixty outlets globally. Scripts and audio are also available freely on the Spotlight website.\nDesign and usage.\nSpecialized English sounds the same as Special English, and it almost is the same. Both use a 1500 word core vocabulary, short sentences, and slow delivery (about 90 words per minute). Special English was used from about 1959 by Voice of America. Specialized was written in the late 1990's, independently of Voice of America. The basic design is identical, but there is a slight difference in the vocabulary, and Specialized is more international. VoA is a federal US government department, so it doesn't make Special English programs for anything other than VoA's own use. Specialized English was designed by the civil society, and the developers try to make programs for several purposes. The developers of Specialized felt they should choose a name to show both the similarity and the difference.\nThe reason that Specialized was based on Special English is related to their respective usage. They are not primarily teaching tools (even though they are popular as an aid to learning) but communication tools. The choice of words in the 1500 word list depends to a degree on what is to be communicated. Most of the words are the most frequently learned, most commonly used English words. Both tools use these words. But many words are chosen for the intended purpose. For example, Special English uses words a US government news service might need, such as Congress, federal, administration, capitalism and recession. Specialized replaces some of these words with words used for religious subjects, such as blessing, prayer, miracle, and faith. The Specialized English word list has been revised in 2000 and 2007, in the light of experience. Still, the overlap of the two vocabularies is 91.3%. The Specialized English word list allows greater breadth of meaning in some of the words used in both lists. For example, the word 'joint':\nSpecial: joint - ad. shared by two or more\nSpecialized: joint - ad. shared by two or more; n. the place where two parts or things are fixed together.\nSpecialized also allows more prefixes and suffixes, which has allowed some words to be removed from the core list. (e.g.: wonderful not needed in the list because it can be built from wonder+ful)\nAs well as the 1500 word core vocabulary, both Special and Specialized English also generally allow: inflections of the core words, numbers up to a million, pronouns, proper nouns, and any words whose meaning can be communicated in real time (in a radio broadcast) using the core vocabulary.\nThe following table lists some differences between the two methods."}

At first, these were paddle steamboats. Some had a paddle wheel on the back. Others had two wheels on the sides. Most went down rivers. From about 1836, marine propellers, invented by Josef Ressel, were used. Claude Fran\u00e7ois Jouffroy d\u2019Abbans built the first working steamship in 1783.\nThere were many steamboats in the 19th century in the United States and other countries. However, the first steamboat was built by John Fitch in 1787. It had many paddles. Fitch tried to make money from the steamboat, but could not do so. He died in 1798, and did not live long enough to see Robert Fulton become the first person to build a steamboat that could make money. In 1807, Fulton built a steamboat that could travel from New York City to Albany in 32 hours. Steamboats became much faster later in the 19th century.\nAfter the middle 19th century paddle steamers became rare, as the marine propeller gave more speed and burned less fuel. The new vessels were suited to the open ocean, and were usually called \"steamships\". During the 20th century, marine Diesel engines largely replaced steam propulsion."}

It is like a double bass, but it belongs to the viol family. The name \"violone\" means \"large viol\". It was really a \"double-bass viola da gamba\". It usually had six strings, and the fingerboard had frets (like a guitar) which showed where to put the fingers of the left hand to make the notes. The bow was held underhand (with the palm of the hand facing up).\nUsage.\nThe violone is sometimes heard today in early music groups who are playing Renaissance and early Baroque music music. The instruments used today are usually ones that have been made recently to look and sound like the old ones.\nHistory.\nThe violone was the last member of the viol family to die out. When the other sizes of viol had been replaced by orchestras with violins, violas and cellos the violone was often used instead of a double bass. Bach used the violone in his cantatas. Eventually the violone was no longer used, and the double bass was used instead. The double bass still looks a little bit like the old viol because it has sloping shoulders and the strings are tuned in fourths.\nUse of the name \"violone\" in organs.\nIn organs \"Violone\" is the name given to a soft organ stop made of metal or wood, usually in the pedals."}

It describes a problem where many people with their own ideas can make something they all share worse, even if no one wants to. For example, even if no one wants to pollute water because that makes it unhealthy, it can still end up like that because so many want to use the water for their own reasons, like washing and throwing away rubbish. Each person thinks that their small bit of pollution of the water is too small to affect the quality of the water, but because there are many people the total effect ends up making the water too polluted for mostly anybody to use for drinking or even washing. This may occur in slums and other overcrowded places like refugee camps.\nThe idea was not Hardin's, but a person named William Forster Lloyd who wrote about it in 1833. In those days herders often grazed cows on common land. Lloyd pointed out that each cow added benefit to its owner but damaged the land overall for all herders by overgrazing.\nThe tragedy of the commons is often used in modern debates on ecology. It is also a topic in game theory."}

As well as the data model, many basic concepts of database terminology were introduced by this group, notably the concepts of schema and subschema."}

He composed many works for the cello which today are performed by cellists all over the world.\nLife.\nPopper was born in the old Jewish part of Prague. His father was a Cantor in two synagogues. When he was three years old he was imitating his father\u2019s singing. He learned the violin when he was six and, at the age of twelve, he got a place to study music at the Prague Conservatory, but he had to learn the cello. His cello teacher was Julius Goltermann. His first job was as cellist to the Prince of Hohenzollern who soon gave him the title \u201cKammervirtuoso\u201d. He was only 21 when he played a difficult concerto by Robert Volkmann. The conductor, Hans von B\u00fclow, was very impressed and so were the critics. He gave many concerts in Vienna and became very famous. He started to travel around Europe, visiting England and Russia. He had a lot of energy and was able to compose a lot while travelling. He composed many short cello pieces. His \"Elfentanz\" (Dance of the Elves) and \"Spinning Song\" were especially popular with the audiences.\nBudapest.\nIn 1886 Popper married for the second time. In the same year he took up a job at the Royal Hungarian Academy of Music in Budapest. He was a famous teacher and charged a high fee for lessons. He formed a string quartet with three other musicians including the violinist Jen\u0151 Hubay. Hubay and Popper often played piano trios with Johannes Brahms.\nPopper made a long visit to England and Scotland where he was described as the world\u2019s greatest cellist by many people including George Bernard Shaw. When he returned to Prague he played with B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k who was only 19 years old and not yet famous. He was also impressed when he heard the young Pablo Casals, although he did not agree with his technique.\nPopper had one son who died of tuberculosis in 1911. Two years later Popper slipped on an icy pavement. He was never able to use his right arm again. He died the next summer of a heart attack.\nHis music.\nPopper composed a very large number of cello pieces, many of which are short pieces suitable for encores at a recital. One of the most popular (and not too difficult) is the \"Gavotte in D major\". He composed a \"Requiem\" for three cellos and orchestra, and he wrote four cello concertos. However, his most important work for cellists is a collection of studies called \"Hochschule des Violoncellspiels\" (\"High School of Cello Playing\"). This book contains 40 etudes, or musical exercises to develop technique, and is widely used today by cello students to improve their playing."}

There are many different ways that mud volcanoes can be made. Temperatures in a mud volcano are much cooler than that of a regular volcano. The biggest mud volcanoes are 10\u00a0kilometers in diameter and can be as tall as 700\u00a0meters. Most of the gases given off by mud volcanoes are methane. Other gases given off include carbon dioxide and methane. They usually spit out liquids with solids in the liquids. An example of this would be water with salt or acids in the water.\nDetails.\nA mud volcano is usually made by mud diapir that breaks out of the surface of the Earth or on the ocean bottom. Temperatures in mud volcanoes can be as low as the freezing point. \nMud volcanoes are often linked with places where petroleum gathers and around areas of tectonic subduction. They can also be linked with orogenic belts where hydrocarbon gases usually erupt. They are also often linked with lava volcanoes as well. However, instead of spitting out magma, mud volcanoes spit out gases like methane and carbon dioxide.\nAround 1,100 mud volcanoes have been found on land and in shallow water. People think that more than 10,000 mud volcanoes may exist on continental slopes and abyssal plains.\nFeatures and what they give off.\nThere are many features of mud volcanoes. One of these features is the gryphon, which is a steep, short cone that gives off mud. Another feature is the mud cone, which is a tall cone that makes mud and small pieces of rock. The scoria cone is a cone that is made when of mud are heated up and the salse, which are pools of water that leak gases out of them. Mud volcanoes have many other features, but most of these are notable.\nMost of the things that mud volcanoes spit out happen during volcanic . Other eruptions have been known to happen during the time when a volcano is dormant or sleeping.\nPlaces mud volcanoes are.\nEurope and Asia.\nThere are very few mud volcanoes in Europe, but quite a few are on the Taman Peninsula of Russia and the Kerch Peninsula in the southeastern part of Ukraine. In Italy, many mud volcanoes are near the Apennines and in Sicily. Also in Europe are the Berca Mud Volcanoes, near Berca in Buz\u0103u County, Romania. Many mud volcanoes are by the Black Sea and Caspian Sea. Movement from tectonic plates have made areas of mod volcanoes that spit out hydrocarbons and methane. Some of the tallest mud volcanoes are in Azerbaijan. Mud volcanoes are also in Iran and Pakistan in the Makran mountain range.\nChina has a lot of mud volcanoes in the Xinjiang province. There are two active mud volcanoes in the southern part of Taiwan. The island of Baratang, which is part of the Great Andaman group of islands in the Andaman Islands, Indian Ocean also have a few active mud volcanoes.\nAzerbaijan.\nPeople think that 300 of the mud volcanoes out of the 700 mud volcanoes on Earth are in the eastern part of Azerbaijan and the Caspian Sea. In 2001, one mud volcano about 15 kilometers away from Baku was in the world news when it suddenly started spitting out flames 15 meters high."}

It is a crack in the planet's surface from which geothermally heated water comes out. Hydrothermal vents are commonly found near volcanically active places, areas where tectonic plates are moving apart, ocean basins, and hotspots.\nHydrothermal vents are common on earth because it is both geologically active and has large amounts of water on its surface and within its crust. Common land types include hot springs, fumaroles and geysers. The most famous hydrothermal vent system on land is probably within Yellowstone National Park in the United States. Under the sea, hydrothermal vents may form features called \"black smokers\".\nRelative to the majority of the deep sea, the areas around submarine hydrothermal vents are biologically more productive, often hosting complex communities fueled by the chemicals dissolved in the vent fluids. Chemosynthetic archaea form the base of the food chain, supporting diverse organisms, including giant tube worms, clams, limpets and shrimp.\nActive hydrothermal vents are believed to exist on Jupiter's moon Europa, and ancient hydrothermal vents have been speculated to exist on Mars."}

It is used to help stop uniformed police officers shooting undercover police officers who they do not know are police officers. It is mostly known to be used by the New York City Police Department (NYPD), the NYPD Transit Bureau (which was called the \"New York City Transit Police\") and the NYPD Housing Bureau (which was called the \"New York City Housing Authority Police Department\") and other law enforcement agencies when they are at work in New York City. An undercover police officer will wear a headband, wristband or other piece of clothing in the same color as the \"color of the day\"; this color is told to officers at the precinct before they start work. The system is for officer safety and first started during the violence of 1970s and 1980s New York City. The color of the day system is not known by most of the public but it is written about a lot by newspapers, and by writers and can sometimes be seen on episodes of television shows such as NYPD Blue and recently .\nPurpose.\nNew York City is a very large metropolitan city with a population of over 8,310,000 people with over 18,800,000 people living in the area around it. An extra 500,000 people enter the city during a weekday. It has many police and law enforcement officers such as; the NYPD, the (MTA) Police (that used to be called the Metro North Commuter Railroad Police), the Port Authority Police, the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and U.S. Customs and others. The color of the day system is about officer safety. With so many armed officers in the city, undercover police officers need to have an easy to use system in place so that other armed officers know that they are there and do not shoot them when they use their guns. The system is also used so that a uniformed officer will not disturb a person who is really an undercover police officer who is acting as a homeless person so that criminals will rob him.\nHistory.\nThe NYPD Street Crimes Unit started in 1971. During the late 1970s, the 1980s and early 1990s, New York City had a lot more crime than it does today. Undercover officers were asked to go into the subways in plain-clothes or dressed as a homeless person to hide the fact that they were police. Many of these officers were black and had a fear that as they looked like civilian homeless people that uniformed officers would think that they were criminals if they used their guns. Many of these officers would dress and pretend to be drunk homeless people or as victims in order to catch muggers who were attacking them due to being unable to help themselves. The color of the day system was made to make these officers fear this less and was used by all undercover police officers. At the beginning headbands were given out to each street crime unit member, that were in the color of the day: beginning the use of the color of the day system.

Now extinct, the snake was a relative of the \"anaconda\" and the \"boa constrictor\". It was about 43 feet long (13\u00a0m), and weighed over a ton (about 1135\u00a0kg or 2,500 pounds). The snake lived in the Palaeocene epoch, about 58 million years ago. It ate crocodiles.\nThe fossil was found in an open-cast coal mine in Colombia, in 2009. Plant fossils at the site proved the climate at the time was a tropical rainforest. The site was in the Cerrej\u00f3n Formation in La Guajira, Colombia. Other large reptile fossils have been found at this site.\nResearchers found three skulls of the snake in 2002. A life-size replica is on view at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in Washington D.C. It was sent on a world tour to be shown at various museums.\nHabitat.\n\"Titanoboa\" lived in the first recorded tropical forest in South America. It shared the ecosystem with large Crocodylomorpha and large turtles. The paleogeography of the late Paleocene was a sheltered paralic (coastal) swamp, with an open connection to the proto-Caribbean in the north. In this environment tropical aquatic ferns like \"Salvinia\" flourished. The ferns were found as fossils in the Bogot\u00e1 Formation and the Palermo Formation."}

The Treaty of Shimonoseki which ended the war between the Qing Dynasty of China and the Empire of Japan, gave Taiwan to the Japanese. The republic began when the Chinese left in May, 1895, and ended when the Japanese soldiers arrived in October, 1896. Some historians say it was the first republic in Asia, but there was one earlier, the , which had been started in 1777.\nThe republic was started by a group of high officials and local people who still supported the Qing. They wanted to stop the Japanese take over of Taiwan. On May 24, 1895 the new republic sent a copy of its declaration of independence to all the embassies on Taiwan. The next day the new government held an independence ceremony. The Republic of Taiwan made their own stamps. They also printed their own paper money, which is now very hard to find.\nThey were always loyal to the Qing, and said that the Republic would be part of the Qing state. The first president of the Republic of Taiwan was the old governor, Tang Ching-sung, who served from May 25, 1895 to June 5, 1895. The second president was Liu Yung-fu, June 5, 1895 \u2013 October 21, 1896.\nWhen the Japanese soldiers invaded Taiwan there was a lot of fighting. They quickly defeated the new republic.

After World War I the term was used for paramilitary units. The Freikorps got famous at the time of the Weimar Republic to fight in some towns against the Communism.\nFirst Freikorps.\nThe first freikorps were started by Frederick II of Prussia in the eighteenth century during the Seven Years' War. Other freikorps were started during the Napoleonic Wars and were commanded by people such as Ferdinand von Schill and later Ludwig Adolf Wilhelm von L\u00fctzow. The freikorps were thought to be not reliable by regular armies and were mostly used as guards and for minor duties.\nPost-World War I.\nThe meaning of the word changed over time. After 1918, the word was used for the paramilitary organizations that were started in Germany by soldiers who came home after losing World War I. They were the main paramilitary groups during that time. Many of these returning soldiers were not able to return to a normal life, and joined a Freikorps to again be a part of a military structure. Others were angry at losing the war and joined to fight against Communists or get revenge. They were liked and supported by Minister of Defence Gustav Noske, a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, who used them to stop the German Revolution and the Marxist Spartacist League, and also to murder Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg on 15 January 1919. They were also used to defeat the Bavarian Soviet Republic in 1919.\nIn 1920, Adolf Hitler had started his political work as the leader of the very small and unknown German Workers Party (that was soon called the National Socialist German Workers Party, NSDAP (or Nazi Party)) in Munich. Many people who would join this party had been in the Freikorps, including Ernst R\u00f6hm, future leader of the Sturmabteilung, or SA, and Rudolf H\u00f6\u00df, the future Commander of the Auschwitz concentration camp.\nHermann Ehrhardt, who started the Marinebrigade Ehrhardt, and his deputy Commander, Eberhard Kautter, did not want to help Hitler and Erich von Ludendorff in the Beer Hall Putsch.\nHitler L\u00e9galit\u00e9.\nFreikorps leaders gave their old battle flags to Hitler's SA and SS on Nov 9, 1933 in a very big ceremony. Historian Robert Waite said that Hitler had many problems with the Freikorps. Many of the Friekorps had joined the SA, so when the Night of the Long Knives happened, they were targets for being murdered or arrested and this was also done to Ehrhardt and to R\u00f6hm. Waite also says that in Hitler's 'Rohm Purge' speech to the Reichstag on July 13, 1934, that Hitler said that the Freikorps were enemies of Germany.\nIn 1939, in the Polish September Campaign, \"Freikorps Ebbinghaus\", was started to work behind the frontlines. It was not very good at this work and was sent to fight as an army unit but was not good at this either and was ended in less than one year."}

Biologists believe the bat became extinct on 27 August 2009.\nIt was a small bat (it weighed ), and lived only on Christmas Island, Australia. It was thought to be the same as the \"Pipistrellus tenuis\", but research on the bat's baculum (a penis bone) showed that \"Pipistrellus murrayi\" was a different species.\nDecline.\nThe numbers of Christmas Island Pipistrelle bats had dropped a lot in the last 20 years. It had once been seen all over the island, including in the Settlement. It went from at least 80% of its living range, and its numbers had dropped more than 90% since 1994. Research into the number of bats in January 2009, shows there were only about 20 bats left. The only known group resting place had only four bats. The last bat call was heard on 26 August 2009.\nCause of decline.\nScientists do not know why the Christmas Island Pipistrelle's numbers dropped. Several possible threats may have been:\nA number of animals brought to Christmas Island could be the problem:\nSaving the pipistrelle.\nEarly in 2009, the Australian Minister for the Environment, Peter Garrett, stopped scientists from trying to set up a captive breeding program. He said that the bats were too hard to catch, and no one knew how to keep them alive in cages. Instead, he announced a program to breed a similar bat in the Northern Territory of Australia. Scientists would learn about caring and breeding bats, then use this information to save the Christmas Island Pipistrelle. Other scientists had said this would take too long, and the bats would become extinct. Scientists believed that by June 2009 there were only four of the bats left in the world. In July 2009, the Australian Government changed its earlier decision and said that it would try to capture the last of the bats and use them to try and breed more bats in captivity. During August and September 2009 scientists searched for the remaining bats to catch them and protect them. At the end of August only one bat had been heard. Scientists tried to catch this bat, but it has not been heard from since the night of 26 August. It is now believed that the bat is extinct. This may be one of the few times that the extinction of a species in the wild can be known to the exact day. Scientists will continue to search for the bat, but there has been no signs of the bat since."}

As second in command after Hitler, he was one of the most powerful leaders of the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Between 1932 and 1945, he was President of the German Reichstag and also a minister of the Third Reich, under Adolf Hitler. In the Second World War, he was the Commander-in-Chief of the German air force. G\u00f6ring was responsible for the creation of the concentration camps and the Gestapo, the Nazi secret police, which he handed over to SS chief Heinrich Himmler. In 1941, he gave Reinhard Heydrich the order to arrange the Final Solution to kill millions of Jews and Poles.\nG\u00f6ring was one of the 25 people charged at the Nuremberg Trials. The court decided he was guilty. The judgment on 1 October 1946 said that he was to be hanged, but he killed himself by swallowing a tablet of cyanide a few hours before he could be executed.\nEarly life.\nHermann G\u00f6ring, son of Ernst Heinrich G\u00f6ring and Franziska G\u00f6ring (born Tiefenbrunn), was born in Rosenheim, Bavaria. G\u00f6ring's father was a judge. The German chancellor Otto von Bismarck made Ernst G\u00f6ring the first \"Reichskommissar\" (Governor-General) of \"South West Africa\" (today: Namibia), in 1885.\nHermann G\u00f6ring had two brothers, Albert G\u00f6ring and Karl Ernst G\u00f6ring, and two sisters, Olga Therese Sophie G\u00f6ring and Paula Elisabeth Rosa G\u00f6ring.\nHe spent the first three years of his life at the home of a friend of his mother, because G\u00f6ring's father was in Namibia. From 1901, he lived at his godfather Hermann von Epenstein mansion. Hermann's mother had an affair (a romantic relationship with someone other than her husband) with von Epenstein. He attended the grammar schools in F\u00fcrth and Ansbach. In the games he played as a child, the story was always about war.\nIn 1905, he went to a military school in Karlsruhe. He got his Abitur, and an officer exam, in 1912. He then went to the Bavarian Prinz Wilhelm Regiment (112th Infantry) in Mulhouse.\nFirst World War.\nWhen the First World War started, G\u00f6ring had the rank of Lieutenant. He had served in the infantry. In 1915, because of his rheumatism, he had to go to a hospital. His friend, Bruno Loerzer, got him to join the air force. In France, he flew as an observer, a person who looked for targets and enemy planes. Because of this, he was awarded the Iron Cross First Class in 1915. In 1916, he was trained to fly a plane. On 14 March 1916, he shot down his first bomber. In 1917, he became the leader of the 27th Flying Group. In 1918, after he shot his 19th plane, he was awarded the Pour le M\u00e9rite (also called \"The Blue Max\"). This was the highest air force award in Germany. After the death of Manfred von Richthofen, he became the leader of the flying group \"The Red Baron\".\nWeimar Republic.\nBetween 1919 and 1921, G\u00f6ring worked as a stunt pilot in Scandinavia. In November 1922, he met Adolf Hitler and later became a member of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP). G\u00f6ring married Carin in Stockholm on 3 February 1923. In 1923 he was leading the SA (\"Oberste SA-F\u00fchrer\"), and he took part in the Beer Hall Putsch and was wounded. After this, he went to Austria. Because of pain, a doctor injected him with morphine but he became dependent on it. Between 1925 and 1926, he had two treatments in Sweden at the L\u00e5ngbro mental hospital. He came back to Germany in 1927. In 1928, he became a member of the Reichstag of the Weimar Republic. He was a member of the Reichstag until the end of the Second World War. In 1932, the NSDAP became the most powerful party of the Reichstag. G\u00f6ring then became president of the Reichstag.\nG\u00f6ring during the Third Reich.\nWhen Hitler became chancellor of the Weimar Germany in 1933, he made G\u00f6ring a minister of the Reich without a specific area of responsibility. This means that he was not the head of a ministry. In April 1933, he was made minister president of Prussia. Then, on 30 August 1933, he was made a General by Paul von Hindenburg. Between 1934 and 1935 he became minister of several agencies. His wife had died in 1931, and in 1935 he married Emmy Sonnemann in Berlin. In 1936, he sent the German Condor Legion to Spain to help Francisco Franco. After the Kristallnacht in 1938, he was in charge of removing Jewish businessmen from the German economic system. During Second World War, his biggest defeat was the loss of the air battle against Great Britain. Hitler named G\u00f6ring to be his successor if he died in 1939.\nIn 1940, he was made Reichsmarschall (Marshal of the Empire) by Nazi leader, Adolf Hitler. In 1941, G\u00f6ring ordered Heydrich to make a plan for the Holocaust. In 1942, he gave Fritz Sauckel the order to use the Russian population for industry-work. In 1943, G\u00f6ring had an expensive birthday party for his 50th birthday. On 20 April 1945, he left Hitler's birthday party and went to Berchtesgaden. He told Hitler that he had very important things to do in south Germany. From Berchtesgaden, G\u00f6ring sent a telegram to Hitler in Berlin. In the telegram G\u00f6ring asked about taking over the affairs of state. Towards the end of the war, after the telegram, he started to talk with the Allies. Because of this, Hitler wanted to put G\u00f6ring in prison. G\u00f6ring then went to the Americans.\nOn 29 April 1945 Hitler removed G\u00f6ring from all his offices, stripped him off his party membership and ordered his arrest. He wrote this down in his testament.\nAfter the war.\nG\u00f6ring surrendered in Bavaria on 9 May 1945. The Nuremberg Trials started on 20 November 1945. On 18 March 1946, G\u00f6ring was questioned by the Allies. After this, he was imprisoned in Nuremberg. He was the third-highest-ranking Nazi official tried at Nuremberg. Only Reich President (former \"Gro\u00dfadmiral\") Karl D\u00f6nitz and former Deputy F\u00fchrer Rudolf Hess had higher ranks than G\u00f6ring. The judges decided he was guilty. Because of this on 1 October 1946 the court reached a verdict that he was to be hanged. One day before he was to be hanged, he committed suicide by taking a tablet of cyanide. It is not known how G\u00f6ring got the cyanide or how long he hid it but there was a claim that he was given it by an American soldier who was in love with a German woman who was in touch with him. It is not known if this is the truth."}

This groundbreaking design completely changed the look of sweatbands. Worn on the hand to precisely wipe sweat from the eyes and face, these bands join moisture wicking material to stretch terry cloth.\u00a0s\"Q\"oosh\u00a0brands revolutionized the old-fashioned sweatband market with a new favorite for runners in the 21st century.

Some bands are those made for; Make Poverty History, Anti-bullying, disease awareness charities and to help people learn about religions (such as the \"Jesus Loves Me\" band). These bands are often made of plastic or silicone. The making of some of these bands has been in the news as some were made in sweatshops in China and poor countries. This is said to be very bad because these wristbands are made to help people and charities and by being made in these sweatshops they have hurt the people making them because these places are often not safe, and the people working in them do not get paid much money for work they do.\nAwareness wristbands were first started by the Lance Armstrong charity Livestrong (see \"Other websites\") in 2003.\nSome of these wristbands are copied by criminals and sold to people without the money going to the organization they are trying to help.\nTypes of awareness bands.\nSome awareness bands:\nSecurity wristbands.\nWristbands are often used at music events like concerts and sports event to show that the person wearing them has paid to be there. Some events let people leave and return during the event. Security wristbands allow the person to come back in to the event after they have given their ticket to the staff the first time they entered.\nChild safety.\nSometimes safety wristbands have been used to give to both a parent and child to make sure that only the parent can take the child home from an event. Both of their wristbands have the same number on them and this stops someone else from taking the child.\nIdentification wristbands.\nHospitals also use wristbands on patients so that they know who they are because patients don't carry identification with them when they are in the hospital.\nAlcohol wristbands.\nSome local governments have thought about using wristbands given to young people to let them buy alcohol in town pubs and bars."}

The people who bully other people are called bullies. Anybody can be bullied, even a group of people. There are many different kinds of bullying. Bullying does not always mean hitting people. It can also be things that people say or do.\nBullying includes when people see what happens, but they don't do anything about it. When people who see bullying know what to do and they do it, they can help make a bad situation better.\nIt's also bullying when other people hide it from those who can help (teachers, bosses), when other people see it but ignore it, or when a person helps the bully to do it without getting in trouble. \nSchool teachers and staff have tried to learn ways to stop bullying. However, bullying can be easy to hide.\nSome countries and regions have laws against it.\nWhat happens.\nBullying can happen almost anywhere. This includes at school, at work, at home, and on the internet (cyber-bullying).\nA goal is part of what makes bullying what it is. There are many goals that bullies can have, including:\nBullying may be a mix of some of these tactics (ways of doing something). For example, Lance Armstrong said, \"Yes, I was a bully. I was a bully in the sense that I tried to control the narrative and if I didn't like what someone said, I turned on them.\" In other words, when someone said something that Armstrong didn't like, he \"ran [them] over\" and bullied them.\nBullying also includes using power or position in the wrong way. This can mean making comments or threats about losing a job. The person that is getting bullied then feels insecure (not sure) about themselves.\nBullying also includes moving the goalposts by setting goals which subtly change in ways that cannot be reached.\nCulture of bullying.\nBullying happens for a reason. Most of the time, the bully is either not getting the attention they want or they are going through problems and want to get it through bullying. Another reason could be that the person does not feel good about themselves, so they bully others to make themselves feel stronger. Therefore, when the person wants to get attention and make others believe they are powerful, they may start saying mean things to other people or starting fights.\nBullying culture means, that it is normal to be bullied for the victim. It is about the abuse of social powers.\nThe culture of bullying includes daily activities and the way people relate to each other. A bullying culture emphasizes a win/lose way of thinking. It also encourages domination and aggression.\nResponse.\nMany people do not know how to deal with bullying. In school, the first thing one should do is to tell an adult that they trust. Someone who is bullied may want to keep friends around. If a bully comes to you, try to stay calm and get away safely.\nSome charities (groups made to help people) are made to fight bullying and to help the people who are bullied. There are also laws against bullying in the UK, such as Section 89 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006.\nSome cases of bullying have resulted in suicide."}

Over many years it changed the types of plants and animals that lived in an area.\nFire-stick farming had turned scrub into grassland, which increased the numbers of grass eating animals such as the kangaroo. Scientists say that the changes caused by fire-stick farming caused the extinction of the Australian megafauna.\nIn the forests, fire-stick farming opened up clear areas and let more plants grow at ground level.

It started about 23 million years ago and ended about 5.33 million years ago. The rock beds that mark the start and end are well known, but the exact dates of the start and end of the period are uncertain. The biota becomes 'modern'.\nThe Miocene was named by Sir Charles Lyell. Its name comes from the Greek words (', \u201cless\u201d) and (', \u201cnew\u201d) and means \"less recent\", because it has 18% fewer modern sea invertebrates than the Pliocene.\nAs the earth cooled, it went from the Oligocene epoch, through the Miocene, and into the Pliocene. The Miocene boundaries are not set at any particular world wide event. They are set at regional boundaries between the warmer Oligocene and the cooler Pliocene epochs.\nThe plants and animals of the Miocene were fairly modern, but familiar present-day species had not yet evolve. Modern families of mammals and birds existed. Whales, seals, and kelp spread. Modern sharks appeared, including the huge \"Megalodon\". Grasslands became more common. Mammalian browsers became less common, and grazer species became more common. About 100 species of ape lived at that time, and cetaceans were very common in the seas. The giganic shark \"Carcharodon megalodon\" may have preyed on them.\nClimate.\nThe climate was warm in the Miocene, especially in the first half. The diagram shows that throughout the Oligocene and the first half of the Miocene, climate remained warm.\nThis meant that Africa (and elsewhere) was much more forested than today, and that the herbivorous mammals were mainly browsers rather than grazers. In the second half of the Miocene temperatures dropped, and grasslands began to expand.\nMediterranean.\nAnother great event, which undoubtedly affected climate, was the refilling of the Mediterranean basin. The so-called Zanclean flood is thought to have refilled the Mediterranean Sea 5.33\u00a0million years ago.\nThis reconnected the Mediterranean Sea to the Atlantic Ocean. It is possible that even before the flood there were partial connections to the Atlantic Ocean.\nAccording to this model, water from the Atlantic Ocean refilled the dried up basin through the modern-day Strait of Gibraltar. The process took up to two years.\nThe flood may have affected global climate, considering that the much smaller flood triggered when Lake Agassiz drained did result in a cold period."}

It has the most species. \nWhat looks like its flower is really made of hundreds or thousands of tiny individual flowers. The technical term for it is a pseudanthium (\"false flower\"). \nThe driving force for the evolution of the Asteraceae was that the composite flowers look attractive to pollinating insects. A large brightly coloured flower attracts insects. The other quality insects like is the scent of the pollen and the sugary nectar in the flowers. The asters are very successful (over 32,000 known species of flowering plants in over 1,900 genera in the order Asterales). Their success is due to what they offer to visiting insects. It is also due to their ability to grow almost anywhere, but especially on grass.\nHeterocarpy, or amphicarpy, the ability of an annual species to produce different fruit morphs, is common in Asteraceae. It allows seeds to be dispersed over varying distances, each type adapted to different environment. This increases the chances of survival. "}

It is made up of the Royal Australian Navy, the Australian Army, the Royal Australian Air Force and a number of joint groups.\nAt first the Australian Government set up three separate armed services. In 1976, the government decided to have a single military headquarters. Over time, the three services have combined headquarters, logistics and training camps.\nThe ADF is small, but uses a lot of technology. With 53,000 full-time active-duty service people and 20,000 part-time reserve forces, it is the largest military force in Oceania. It is much smaller than most Asian military forces. The ADF does not have enough people in some highly skilled areas, but it is still able to send forces in many regions outside Australia."}

Automobile navigation can rely on GPS (Global Positioning System), or it can be DVD- or data-based. GPS-bsed navigation uses radio signals from special satellites that send their position and the time of transmission. The GPS receiver catches the signal and calculates the time. The GPS can then calculate the distance from the satellite with the well-known radio signal speed.\nSatellites.\nWhen driving a car with such a GPS receiver, the driver may receive information from a satellite which is above for instance Dover in the south and another one which is above Perth in the north. Then the GPS receiver knows precisely how far it is from Dover and how far it is from Perth. With that \"two\" possible positions of the car at the flat land are precisely determined.\nTo know which one of those positions is the right place, the GPS receiver needs a third satellite, for instance above Land's End in the west. With that information, the GPS receiver can also determine elevation. With three satellites in fact there is still a third possible point, but that is twice as high as the satellites above the earth's surface and does not need to be reckoned with in car travel.\nBut the GPS receiver still needs a fourth satellite, because the GPS receiver needs to know the time very precisely. In between it knows your car position, so that it can calculate the distance from that satellite. Then it knows the time of reception, because that is the time of transmission plus the travel time of the signal.\nThe GPS receiver.\nAt any moment the GPS receiver searches for the strongest satellites, calculates the position and the driving direction and then shows it all on a small screen as a three-dimensional map. With that it also shows the vehicle's driving speed and how far it is to the next junction.\nThe driver may add the address where he or she wants to go. The GPS receiver then directs the driver to their destination step-by-step, often using voice prompts. The driver can even be shown where there are traffic jams, speed cameras and traffic lights, and the route can be calculated in such a way that these can be avoided, reducing the time needed for the driver to reach his or her destination.\nIf the driver deviates from the indicated route, the GPS receiver can provide new directions to the same destination, by repeating the same calculations.\nMaps.\nTo show where the car is with the calculated position, the GPS receiver contains digital maps. Many GPS receivers allow users to add more maps or newer maps to allow for better navigation.\nMobile phones.\nMobile phones are often equipped with GPS receivers, but most require a mobile Internet connection to function. Nokia's HERE Maps are able to store maps for offline use, and because of this, phones that have this app installed can be used as GPS navigation systems as mentioned above."}
