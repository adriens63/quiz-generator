It was built in honor of the Roman Senator Tiberius Julius Celsus Polemaeanus, known as Celsus.\nCelsus paid for the construction of the library with his own personal wealth. Celsus was Consul in 92\u00a0AD, Governor of the Roman province of Asia in 115\u00a0AD, and a rich and popular local citizen. He was a native of nearby Sardis and amongst the first Greek men to become a consul in the Roman Empire. He is honoured both as a Greek and a Roman on the library itself.\nThe library was built by his son, Gaius Julius Aquila (Consul 110\u00a0AD), and completed in 135\u00a0AD.\nThe library was built to store 12,000 scrolls and to serve as a monumental tomb for Celsus. Celsus is buried in a sarcophagus beneath the library, in the main entrance. which is both a crypt containing his sarcophagus and a sepulchral monument to him. It was unusual to be buried within a library or even within city limits, so this was a special honour for Celsus.\nHistory.\nThe library was built in Ephesus, a Greek city in Asia Minor.\nThe building is important as one of few remaining examples of an ancient Roman-influenced library. It also shows that public libraries were built not only in Rome itself but throughout the Roman Empire.\nThe interior of the library and all its books were destroyed by fire in the devastating earthquake that struck the city in 262. Only the facade survived. About 400\u00a0AD, the library was used for other purposes. The facade was completely destroyed by a later earthquake, likely in the late Byzantine period.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the facade was restored. It now serves as a prime example of Roman public architecture. The building had a single hall which faced east toward the morning sun, as Vitruvius advised, to benefit early risers. Beside the entrances are four pairs of Ionic columns on pedestals. A set of Corinthian columns stands directly above the first set, adding to the height of the building. It is thought there once may have been a third set of columns.\nThis type of facade with inset frames and niches for statues is like that found in ancient Greek theatres, and so is described as \"scenographic\"."}

It surrounds the embryo and provides nutrition in the form of starch. It may also have oils and protein.\nThe endosperm of cereal plants can be a source of energy for humans. Wheat endosperm is ground into flour for bread. With whole wheat bread the bran (cover of seed) and the germ is also in the flour. Barley endosperm is the main source for beer production. Other examples of edible endosperms are coconut 'meat' and coconut 'water', and corn, including popcorn. Some plants, like the orchids, lack endosperm in their seeds.\nOrigin of endosperm.\nPrimitive (basal) flowering plants have seeds with small embryos and big endosperms. The evolutionary development of flowering plants tends to show a trend towards plants with seeds with little or no endosperm. In more derived flowering plants the embryo occupies most of the seed and the endosperm is not developed or consumed before the seed matures. In these plants, the cotyledons contain the food reserve.\nDouble fertilization.\nEndosperm is formed when the two sperm nuclei inside a pollen grain reach the inside of an ovule or embryo sac. One sperm nucleus fertilizes the egg, forming a zygote, while the other sperm nucleus usually fuses with the two polar nuclei at the center of the embryo sac. This makes the first endosperm cell, which develops into the endosperm. Because it is formed by a separate fertilization, the endosperm is an organism distinct from the embryo (though placed next to it in the seed).\nAbout 70% of angiosperm species have endosperm cells that are polyploid. These are typically triploid (containing three sets of chromosomes) but can vary widely from diploid (2n) to 15n."}

In South America, female hylids carry the eggs on their backs until they hatch.\nSpecies.\nThe European tree frog (\"Hyla arborea\") lives in middle and Southern Europe.

Some are: to save money, make costs smaller and get the most possible value from purchases. \nExamples.\nSome ways of attempting to be frugal could be to make less waste, stop doing things (such as travel or entertainment) with high costs and having control over spending desires. Also, being careful to get all the use out of an item before replacing it and not agreeing with customs that have high costs. More ways could be using zero cost choices, using barter (trading without money), and having a good knowledge of prices. \nSome people will use a discount store to find low cost things. Some will buy things used by other people in thrift stores, garage sales, flea markets, or from classified advertising in a newspaper or on the internet from a site similar to Craigslist. \nPhilosophy.\nFrugality in some philosophies is when a person does not agree with experts who say they know what is good for everybody. This is a special use of the word for philosophers. \nMany religions think frugality is important and good. The Quakers and Puritans are two examples of Christian religions that put high value on frugality. The base of this idea is that people should store money to use when any person (not only friends) needs help. \nEnvironmentalists think that being frugal is good. They think because ancient humans did not need many things and were able to get happiness from nature it is more natural to be frugal than to agree with the customs of modern living."}

She has written both fiction and essays about race and gender. She is best known for the novel \"The Color Purple\" (1982). She won the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize for the novel.\nEarly life.\nWalker is an African American who was born in Eatonton, Georgia. She is the youngest of eight children. Her parents were Willie Lee Walker and Minnie Lou Tallulah Grant. Her father, who was, in her words, \"wonderful at math but a terrible farmer,\" earned only $300 a year from sharecropping and dairy farming. Her mother added to the family income by working as a maid. She worked 11 hours a day for USD $17 per week to help pay for Alice to attend college.\nIn 1952, Walker was accidentally hit in the right eye by a BB gun fired by one of her brothers. Because the family had no car, the Walkers could not take their daughter to a hospital for immediate help. By the time they reached a doctor a week later, she had become permanently blind in that eye. When a layer of scar tissue formed over her wounded eye, Alice became self-conscious and painfully shy. She felt like an outcast and turned for comfort to reading and to writing poetry. When she was 14, the scar tissue was removed. She later became valedictorian and was voted most-popular girl, as well as queen of her senior class.\nAfter high school, Walker went to Spelman College in Atlanta. She later moved to Sarah Lawrence College near New York City, graduating in 1965. Walker became interested in the U.S. civil rights movement. This was partly due to the influence of activist Howard Zinn, who was one of her professors at Spelman College. Walker returned to the South where she became involved with voter registration drives, campaigns for welfare rights and children's programs in Mississippi.\nActivism.\nAlice Walker met Martin Luther King Jr. when she was a student at Spelman College. Walker credits King for her decision to return to the American South as an activist for the Civil Rights Movement. She marched with hundreds of thousands in August in the 1963 March on Washington. As a young adult, she volunteered to register black voters in Georgia and Mississippi.\nOn March 8, 2003, International Women's Day, on the eve of the Iraq War, Alice Walker, Maxine Hong Kingston, and Terry Tempest Williams were arrested with 24 others for crossing a police line. This was during an anti-war protest rally outside the White House.\nIn March 2009, Alice Walker traveled to Gaza in response to the Gaza War. She was with a group of 60 other female activists from the anti-war group Code Pink. Their purpose was to deliver aid, to meet with NGOs and residents, and to ask Israel and Egypt to open their borders into Gaza.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1965, Walker met Melvyn Roseman Leventhal, a Jewish civil rights lawyer. They were married on March 17, 1967 in New York City. Later that year the couple moved to Jackson, Mississippi. They became \"the first legally married inter-racial couple in Mississippi\". They were harassed and threatened by whites, including the Ku Klux Klan. The couple had a daughter Rebecca in 1969. Walker and her husband divorced on friendly terms in 1976.\nWalker and her daughter grew apart. Rebecca felt herself to be more of \"a political symbol... than a cherished daughter\". She published a memoir called \"Black White and Jewish\", about the complexities of her parents' relationship and her childhood. Rebecca recalls her teenage years when her mother would go to her far-off writing studio while \u201cI was left with money to buy my own meals and lived on a diet of fast food.\u201d Since the birth of Rebecca\u2019s son Tenzin, her mother has not spoken to her. Rebecca has learned that she was cut out of her mother\u2019s will in favor of a distant cousin.\nIn the mid-1990s, Walker was involved in a romance with singer-songwriter Tracy Chapman.\nIn 2011 shooting began on \"Beauty in Truth\", a documentary film about Walker's life directed by Pratibha Parmar.\nWalker is a feminist. She made the word womanist for African American feminism against female genital mutilation."}

Some of the characters he created are Sam Spade (\"The Maltese Falcon\"), Nick and Nora Charles (\"The Thin Man\"), and the Continental Op (\"Red Harvest\" and \"The Dain Curse\").\nIn addition to the large influence his novels and stories had on film, Hammett \"is now widely regarded as one of the finest mystery writers of all time\". \"Time\" magazine included Hammett's 1929 novel \"Red Harvest\" on a list of the 100 best English-language novels published between 1923 and 2005.\nEarly life.\nHammett was born on a farm in St. Mary's County, in Maryland. His parents were Richard Thomas Hammett and Anne Bond Dashiell. Hammett was baptized a Catholic. He grew up in Philadelphia and Baltimore. \"Sam,\" as he was known before he began writing, left school when he was 13 years old. He had several jobs before working for the Pinkerton National Detective Agency. He served as an operative for the Pinkertons from 1915 to February 1922. He took time off to serve in World War I. He did not like the agency's role in union strike-breaking.\nHammett enlisted in the United States Army in 1918. He became ill with the Spanish flu and later got tuberculosis. He spent most of his time in the Army as a patient in Cushman Hospital, Tacoma, Washington. While there he met a nurse, Josephine Dolan, whom he later married.\nMarriage and family.\nHammett and Dolan were married, and they had two daughters, Mary Jane (born 15 October 1921) and Josephine (born in 1926). Because of Hammett's tuberculosis, Josephine and the children could not live with him full time. Josephine rented a home in San Francisco, where Hammett would visit on weekends. The marriage soon ended. He continued to financially support his wife and daughters with the income he made from his writing.\nCareer.\nHammett used his experiences as a Pinkerton operative. Hammett said: \"All my characters were based on people I've known personally, or known about.\"\nHammett wrote most of his detective fiction during the time he was living in San Francisco (the 1920s). Specific streets and locations in San Francisco are frequently mentioned in his stories.\nLater years.\nFrom 1929 to 1930 Dashiell was romantically involved with Nell Martin, an author of short stories and several novels. He dedicated \"The Glass Key\" to her, and in turn, she dedicated her novel \"Lovers Should Marry\" to Hammett.\nIn 1931, Hammett started a 30-year affair with playwright Lillian Hellman. This relationship was shown in the film \"Julia\". Hammett was played by Jason Robards and Hellman by Jane Fonda.\nHe wrote his final novel in 1934. He spent the rest of his life to left-wing activism. He was a strong anti-fascist through the 1930s. In 1937 he joined the American Communist Party.\nIn early 1942, after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Hammett again enlisted in the United States Army. He was a disabled veteran of World War I, and a victim of tuberculosis, but he was allowed to join. He served in the Aleutian Islands. He edited an Army newspaper. He also got emphysema. .\nAfter the war, Hammett returned to political activism. He was elected President of the Civil Rights Congress (CRC) on June 5, 1946.\nDuring the 1950s he was investigated by Congress. This was part of Senator Joseph McCarthy's attempt to identify Communists. He refused to share information and was blacklisted.\nDeath.\n A lifetime's heavy drinking of alcohol and cigarettes made Hammett's tuberculosis worse. As the years of the 1950s went on, Hammett became \"a hermit\". Hammett no longer could live alone, so the last four years of his life he spent with Hellman. On January 10, 1961, Hammett died in New York City's Lenox Hill Hospital, of lung cancer. He had been diagnosed just two months before. As a veteran of two World Wars, he was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.\nWorks.\nNovels.\nAll the novels except \"The Thin Man\" were originally in three, four, or five parts in various magazines."}

Now, Bletchley Park is home to the National Codes Centre and The National Museum of Computing.\nThe Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS) and \"Station X\", a secret radio interception station, was also at Bletchley Park. The information gained by workers at Bletchley Park was very important for the Allied war effort.\nIn 1939, in Warsaw, the Polish military showed French and British intelligence agents their cryptanalysis of the Enigma. They promised each delegation a Polish-built Enigma. Having an actual Enigma machine, and knowing how to use it, was a much-needed start for the British work at Bletchley Park. Dilly Knox and Alan Turing were later joined by many other codebreakers and engineering staff.\nThe high-level intelligence produced at Bletchley Park codenamed Ultra, gave crucial help to the Allied war effort. It was vital during the Battle of the Atlantic, when the German U-boat submarine fleet sank merchant shipping in an attempt to starve Britain of supplies. Winston Churchill was later to say:\nThe Battle of the Atlantic was the dominating factor all through the war. Never for one moment could we forget that everything happening elsewhere, on land, at sea, or in the air depended ultimately on its outcome.\nSir Harry Hinsley (a Bletchley veteran and the official historian of British Intelligence during the Second World War) said that Ultra shortened the war by two to four years. The outcome of the war would have been uncertain without it.\nLocation.\nOne of the reasons for choosing Bletchley Park for this task was its location. By train, it is about north-west of London, from Oxford and about from Cambridge all-important university cities. Bletchley railway station is close-by, on the junction of the West Coast Main Line and the Oxford\u2013Cambridge Varsity Line. Apart from the railway lines, Bletchley Park was not near any other likely bombing target."}

Harry Hammond Hess used echo-sounding equipment to map the floor of the ocean. The research revealed that some undersea mountains had flat tops.\nHess called these undersea mountains \"guyots\" because they reminded him of Guyot Hall at Princeton University.

In other words, the geology term \"guyot\" comes from his name.\nDescription.\nGuyots show evidence of having been above the surface at one time.

It is based on the comic strip \"Dennis the Menace\" by Hank Ketcham. The four-season series aired from 1959 to 1963 on CBS. The show stars Jay North as Dennis Mitchell, Herbert Anderson as his father Henry, Gloria Henry as his mother Alice, Billy Booth as his friend Tommy Anderson, and Jeannie Russell as his friend Margaret Wade. Dennis wore the same costume in every episode: a striped tee-shirt, a pair of bib overalls with a slingshot in the back pocket, a pair of sneakers, and an enormous blond cowlick. Viewers complained about the slingshot and it was eventually removed. The bizarre costume put Dennis outside the realistic \"mise en scene\" of the show, making it difficult to \"relate\" to him in spite of North's brilliant performance. Margaret had the same problem with her ringlets, eyeglasses, and ever-present patent leather shoes. These clothes were not the sort of things kids were wearing during the shows years on the air.\nMargaret wanted to marry Dennis. This was a running gag in both the comic strip and the television show. She pushed a baby carriage through the neighborhood. \"Playing house\" was something she pressured Dennis to do. When Dennis needed a penny or two, she gave it to him but only after he promised to play house with her. If he turned her down, she would hit him with one of the rag dolls in the baby carriage and prance on her way.\nOther players in the show are Joseph Kearns as Dennis's neighbor George Wilson, Sylvia Field as George's wife Martha, and Gale Gordon as Mr. Wilson's brother John. George Wilson was a retired fussy sort of man who gardened, collected coins, did household fixit jobs, and watched birds. Many episodes were about Dennis making a mess of Mr. Wilson's hobbies. Dennis's comic strip dog Ruff was cut from the TV story, but Mr. Wilson was given a little dog named Fremont. Maud Prickett, Irene Tedrow, Dub Taylor, Mary Wickes, and other familiar 1950s TV faces showed up often as minor characters. Ron Howard appeared in several episodes as Dennnis' friend Stewart while also playing Opie Taylor on \"The Andy Griffith Show\".\n\"Dennis the Menace\" is about a happy little (but trouble-prone) middle class boy named Dennis Mitchell. He would like to be helpful but his attempts always end in disasters. He bothers a lot of people, but mostly his neighbor George Wilson. Actor Joseph Kearns played George Wilson but died while the show was in production. Gale Gordon joined the show as John Wilson, George's brother. Viewers were told that George and his TV wife Martha were taking a long journey and that George's brother John would be living in and taking care of their house. The show ended in 1963 when North became too old (11 years) to play the part of Dennis."}

The spring bloom of phytoplankton can start quite early close to the ice edge. The fresh water from the melting ice makes up a water layer on top of the sea water. The phytoplankton bloom feeds zooplankton. The animals that eat zooplankton include young cod, capelin, polar cod, whales, and Little Auk. The capelin is a main food for animals such as the North-East Arctic cod, harp seals, and seabirds such as Common Guillemot and Brunnich's Guillemot.

They were then settled by Yakuts and later by Russians. Russian explorations of the area started in the 17th century. They came from the south by several large rivers which empty into the sea. These rivers include the Lena River, the Khatanga, the Anabar, the Olenyok, the Omoloy and the Yana. The sea has several dozen islands, many have well-preserved mammoth remains.\nThe largest town and port is Tiksi.\nFlora and fauna.\nBoth flora and fauna are scarce because of the harsh climate. Vegetation of the sea is mostly represented by diatoms, with more than 100 species. The number of green algae, blue-green algae and flagellate species is about 10 each. The phytoplankton is characteristic of brackish waters. There are about 30 species of zooplankton. The coastal flora mainly is mosses and lichens and a few flowering plants including arctic poppy, \"Saxifraga\", \"Draba\" and small populations of polar (\"Salix polaris\") and creeping (\"Salicaceae\") willows. Rare vascular plants include species of \"Cerastium\" and \"Saxifraga\". Non-vascular plants include the moss genera \"Detrichum\", \"Dicranum\", \"Pogonatum\", \"Sanionia\", \"Bryum\", \"Orthothecium\" and \"Tortura\", as well as the lichen genera \"Cetraria\", \"Thamnolia\", \"Cornicularia\", \"Lecidea\", \"Ochrolechia\" and \"Parmelia\".\nPermanent mammal species include ringed seal, bearded seal, Harp Seal, walrus, collared lemming, Arctic fox, reindeer, wolf, ermine, Arctic hare and polar bear. The beluga whale visits the region seasonally. There are several dozens species of birds. Some belong to permanent (tundra) species, such as snow bunting, purple sandpiper, Snowy Owl and brent goose. Others make large colonies on the islands and sea shores. These include little auk, Black-legged Kittiwake, black guillemot, ivory gull, \"uria\", \"charadriiformes\" and glaucous gull. Other bird species are skua, sterna, Northern Fulmar, Ivory Gull, Glaucous Gull, Ross's Gull, Long-tailed Duck, eider, loon and Willow Grouse. There are 39 fish species, mostly typical of braskish environment. The major ones are grayling and \"Coregonus\" (whitefishes), such as muksun, broad whitefish and omul. Also common are sardine, Arctic cisco, Bering cisco, polar smelt, saffron cod, polar cod, flounder and arctic char and inconnu.\nIn 1985, the Ust-Lena Nature Reserve was formed in the delta of the Lena River. It has an area of 14,300\u00a0km\u00b2. In 1986, New Siberian Islands were included into the reserve. The reserve has many plants (402 species), fishes (32 species), birds (109 species) and mammals (33 species)."}

It is on the northwest coast of Russia. It is surrounded by Karelia to the west, the Kola Peninsula to the north, and the Kanin Peninsula to the northeast. All of the White Sea is under Russian control and considered to be part of the internal waters of Russia. It is divided between Arkhangelsk and Murmansk Oblasts and the Republic of Karelia.\nThe major port of Arkhangelsk is on the White Sea. It is an important Soviet naval and submarine base. The White Sea-Baltic Canal connects the White Sea with the Baltic Sea.\nThe White Sea is one of four seas named in English after common colour terms. The others are the Black Sea, the Red Sea and the Yellow Sea.\nGeography.\nThere are four main bays or gulfs on the White Sea. Kandalaksha Gulf is in the western part of the White Sea. It is the deepest part of the sea, reaching 340 metres (1,115 feet). On the south, Onega Bay receives the Onega River. To the southeast, the Dvina Bay receives the Northern Dvina River at the major port of Arkhangelsk. On the east side, opposite the Kola peninsula, is Mezen Bay. It receives the Mezen River and the Kuloy River. Other major rivers flowing into the sea are the Vyg, Niva, Umba, Varzuga and Ponoy.\nThe seabed of the central part and Dvina Bay is covered in silt and sand. The bottom of the northern part, the Kandalaksha Gulf and Onega Bay is a mixture of sand and stones. \nThe White Sea has a large number of islands, but most of them are small. The main island group is the Solovetsky Islands. They are almost in the middle of the sea, near the entrance to Onega Bay. Kiy Island in Onega Bay is important due to a historic monastery. Velikiy Island, close to the shore, is the largest island in the Kandalaksha Gulf.\nFauna and economy.\nThe sea has more than 700 species of invertebrates, about 60 species of fish, and 5 species of marine mammals. The fishing industry is small. They mostly target harp seal, ringed seal, herring, saffron cod, European smelt, Atlantic cod and Atlantic salmon. There is a developing seaweed industry.\nThe White Sea is an important traffic centre of northwestern Russia. The White Sea \u2013 Baltic Canal links it through Onega Lake to the Baltic Sea and the major city and port of Saint Petersburg. The Baltic Sea, in turn, is connected by the Volga\u2013Baltic Waterway to the Volga River, Black, Caspian, and Azov seas. The major ports on the White Sea are Arkhangelsk, Belomorsk, Onega, Mezen, Kem, Kandalaksha and Umba. Even though it is frozen in winter, boats can travel on the sea all year around because of the use of icebreakers."}

{"id": "348401", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=348401", "title": "Norwegian Sea", "text": "The Norwegian Sea is a marginal sea in the North Atlantic Ocean, northwest of Norway. It is between the North Sea and the Greenland Sea. It joins the North Atlantic Ocean to the west and the Barents Sea to the northeast. In the southwest, it is separated from the Atlantic Ocean by a submarine ridge running between Iceland and the Faroe Islands. To the North, the Jan Mayen Ridge separates it from the Greenland Sea.\nUnlike many other seas, most of the bottom of the Norwegian Sea is not part of a continental shelf. It is at a great depth of about two kilometres on average. Rich deposits of oil and natural gas are found under the sea bottom and are being explored commercially. The coastal zones are rich in fish that visit the Norwegian Sea from the North Atlantic for spawning. The warm North Atlantic Current gives stable and high water temperatures, so that unlike the Arctic seas, the Norwegian Sea is ice-free throughout the year.\nFlora and fauna.\nThe Norwegian Sea is a transition zone between boreal and Arctic conditions. It has flora and fauna of both regions. The southern limit of many Arctic species runs through the North Cape, Iceland, and the center of the Norwegian Sea. The northern limit of boreal species is near the borders of the Greenland Sea with the Norwegian Sea and Barents Sea. These areas overlap. Some species like the scallop \"Chlamys islandica\" and capelin tend to live in this area between the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans.\nPlankton and sea bottom organisms.\nMost of the aquatic life in the Norwegian Sea is in the upper layers. Estimates for the entire North Atlantic are that only 2% of biomass is at depths below 1,000\u00a0metres and only 1.2% occurs near the sea floor.\nThe blooming of the phytoplankton is dominated by chlorophyll and peaks around 20 May. The major phytoplankton forms are diatoms, in particular the genus \"Thalassiosira\" and \"Chaetoceros\". After the spring bloom the haptophytes of the genus \"Phaecocystis pouchetti\" become dominant.\nZooplankton is mostly copepods \"Calanus finmarchicus\" and \"Calanus hyperboreus\". \"C. hyperboreus\" is strongest in the Arctic waters. They are the main diet of most marine predators. The most important krill species are \"Meganyctiphanes norvegica\", \"Thyssanoessa inermis\", and \"Thyssanoessa longicaudata\". In contrast to the Greenland Sea, there are a lot of calcareous plankton (Coccolithophore and Globigerinida).\nShrimp of the species \"Pandalus borealis\" play an important role in the diet of fish, particularly cod and blue whiting. A special feature of the Norwegian Sea is large coral reefs of \"Lophelia pertusa\", which provide shelter to various fish species.\nFish.\nThe Norwegian coastal waters are the most important spawning ground of the herring populations of the North Atlantic, and the hatching occurs in March. The eggs float to the surface and are washed off the coast by the northward current. Whereas a small herring population remains in the fjords and along the northern Norwegian coast, the majority spends the summer in the Barents Sea, where it feeds on the rich plankton. Upon reaching puberty, herring returns to the Norwegian Sea. The herring stock varies greatly between years. It increased in the 1920s owing to the milder climate and then collapsed in the following decades until 1970; the decrease was, however, at least partly caused by overfishing. The biomass of young hatched herring declined from 11 million tonnes in 1956 to almost zero in 1970; that affected the ecosystem not only of the Norwegian Sea but also of the Barents Sea.\nEnforcement of environmental and fishing regulations has resulted in partial recovery of the herring populations since 1987. This recovery was accompanied by a decline of capelin and cod stocks. While the capelin benefited from the reduced fishing, the temperature rise in the 1980s and competition for food with the herring resulted in a near disappearance of young capelin from the Norwegian Sea. Meanwhile, the elderly capelin population was quickly fished out. This also reduced the population of cod \u2013 a major predator of capelin \u2013 as the herring was still too small in numbers to replace the capelin in the cod's diet.\nBlue whiting (\"Micromesistius poutassou\") has benefited from the decline of the herring and capelin stocks as it assumed the role of major predator of plankton. The blue whiting spawns near the British Isles. The sea currents carry their eggs to the Norwegian Sea, and the adults also swim there in order to benefit from the food supply. The young spend the summer and the winter until February in Norwegian coastal waters and then return to the warmer waters west of Scotland. The Norwegian Arctic cod mostly occurs in the Barents Sea and at the Svalbard Archipelago. In the rest of the Norwegian Sea, it is found only during the reproduction season, at the Lofoten Islands, whereas \"Pollachius virens\" and haddock spawn in the coastal waters. Mackerel is an important commercial fish. The coral reefs are populated by different species of the genus \"Sebastes\".\nMammals and birds.\nLarge numbers of minke, humpback, sei, and orca whales are present in the Norwegian Sea. White-beaked dolphins are in the coastal waters. Orcas and some other whales visit the sea in the summer months for feeding. They follow the herring schools within the sea. With a total population of about 110,000, minke whales are by far the most common whales in the sea. They are hunted by Norway and Iceland, with a quota of about 1,000 per year in Norway. In contrast to the past, mostly they are hunted for their meat, rather than fat and oil.\nThe bowhead whale used to be in the area. It almost disappeared from the Norwegian Sea after intense whaling in the 19th century, and was temporarily extinct in the entire North Atlantic. Similarly, the blue whale used to form large groups between Jan Mayen and Spitsbergen, but is hardly present nowadays. Seeing northern bottlenose whales in the Norwegian Sea is rare. Other large animals of the sea are hooded and harp seals and squid.\nImportant waterfowl species of the Norwegian Sea are puffin, kittiwake and guillemot."}

They named it after the \"Sargassum\" seaweed growing there. \nThe Sargasso Sea plays a major role in the migration of the European eel and the American eel. The larvae of both species hatch there and go to Europe or the East Coast of North America. Later in life, they try to return to the Sargasso Sea to lay eggs. It is also believed that after hatching, young Loggerhead Sea Turtles use currents, such as the Gulf Stream to travel to the Sargasso Sea, where they use the Sargassum as cover from predation until they are mature."}

It is south of Burma, west of Thailand and east of the Andaman Islands, India. It is part of the Indian Ocean.\nThe sea has been used for fishery and transportation of goods between the coastal countries. Its coral reefs and islands are popular for tourism. Many building were badly damaged by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami.\nThe average depth of the sea is about 1,000 meters (3,300\u00a0ft). The northern and eastern parts are shallower than 180 meters (600\u00a0ft) due to the silt deposited by the Irrawaddy River. This major river flows into the sea from the north through Burma. The western and central areas are 900\u20133,000 meters deep (3,000\u201310,000\u00a0ft). Less than 5% of the sea is deeper than 3,000 meters (10,000\u00a0ft). In a system of submarine valleys east of the Andaman-Nicobar Ridge, the depth is more than 4,000 meters (13,200\u00a0ft). The sea floor is covered with pebbles, gravel and sand.\nFlora.\nThe coastal areas of the Andaman Sea have mangrove forests and seagrass meadows. The mangrove roots trap soil and sediment. They provide shelter and are a nursery for fish and small aquatic organisms. Their body protects the shore from the wind and waves. Their detritus are a part of the aquatic food chain.\nOther important sources of nutrients in the Andaman Sea are seagrass and the mud bottoms of lagoons and coastal areas. Many aquatic species move from and to seagrass either daily or at certain stages of their life cycle.\nFauna.\nThe sea waters along the Malay Peninsula favor molluscan growth. There are about 280 edible fish species belonging to 75 families. Of those, 232 species (69 families) are found in mangroves and 149 species (51 families) live in seagrass. 101 species are common to both places. The sea also has many vulnerable fauna species, including dugong, several dolphin species, such as Irrawaddy Dolphin and four species of sea turtles: critically endangered leatherback turtle and hawksbill turtle and threatened green turtle and Olive Ridley turtle. There are only about 150 dugongs in the Andaman Sea, scattered between Ranong and Satun provinces.\nVolcanic activity.\nTo the east of the main Great Andaman island group, is Barren Island. Barren Island is the only presently active volcano associated with the Indian subcontinent. This island-volcano is in diameter and rises 354 meters above the seal level.

Other marine mammals include walrus, Steller sea lion, northern fur seal, beluga, orca and polar bear.\nThe Bering Sea is very important to the seabirds of the world. Over 30 species of seabirds and about 20 million individuals breed in the Bering Sea region. Seabird species include tufted puffins, the endangered short-tailed albatross, spectacled eider, and red-legged kittiwakes.\nTwo Bering Sea species, the Steller's sea cow and spectacled cormorant, are extinct because of overexploitation by man. In addition, a small subspecies of Canada goose, the Bering Canada goose is extinct due to overhunting and the introduction of rats to their breeding islands.\nThe Bering Sea supports many species of fish. At least 419 species of fish have been reported from the Bering Sea. Some species of fish support large and valuable commercial fisheries. Commercial fish species include six species of Pacific salmon; also Alaska pollock, red king crab, Pacific cod, Pacific halibut, yellowfin sole, Pacific ocean perch and sablefish."}

Some other locations on the Eyre Highway or on the Nullarbor do not have facilities or easy access.\nNatural history.\nThe coast line of the Great Australian Bight has cliff faces (up to 60 m high), surfing beaches and rock platforms, ideal for whale-watching. The Great Australian Bight receives very little of the runoff that fertilises most continental shelves. It is essentially a marine desert. It is probably best noted for the large number of sharks that frequent its coastal waters, as well as the increasing numbers of Southern Right Whales that migrate in the region.\nOne location on the bight that is for the understanding of the natural history on its coastline is the Eyre Bird Observatory."}

In the west of the Ross Sea is Ross Island. In the east is Roosevelt Island. The southern part is covered by the Ross Ice Shelf. In the west of the Ross sea, McMurdo Sound is a port which is usually free of ice during the summer. The southernmost part of the Ross Sea is Gould Coast, which is about two hundred miles from the Geographic South Pole.\nAll land masses in the Ross Sea are claimed by New Zealand.\nA 10 metre (32.8\u00a0feet) long colossal squid weighing 495 kilograms (1,091\u00a0lb) was captured in the Ross Sea on February 22, 2007.\nEcological importance and conservation.\nThe flora and fauna are similar to other southern Antarctic marine regions. In summer there are a lot of plankton. They provide food for larger species, such as fish, seals, whales, and sea- and shore-birds.\nThe coastal parts of the sea have a number of rookeries of Ad\u00e9lie and Emperor penguins. They have been seen at a number of places around the Ross Sea, both towards the coast and outwards in open sea.\nThe Ross Sea is one of the last parts of seas on Earth that is mostly unaffected by human activities. Because of this, it is almost totally free from pollution, overfishing and the introduction of invasive species. Some people want to make the area a world marine reserve."}

The nine-banded armadillo is an insectivorous animal. Ants, termites, and other small invertebrates make up most of its diet. The armadillo can jump in the air when scared.\nRange.\nThe nine-banded armadillo is spreading more far out in both the north and east of the United States. It crossed the Rio Grande from Mexico in the late 19th century. At the same time, it was introduced in Florida by humans. By 1995, the species was found in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, and recently seen as far north as southern Nebraska, Illinois, and Indiana.\nThe main reason of this fast expansion is because the species have few or no natural predators in the United States. It is also because Americans do not hunt or eat the armadillo. In late 2009, the state of North Carolina considered a hunting season for armadillo to slow them down.\nOutside the United States, the nine-banded armadillo is in Central and South America and northern Argentina and Uruguay.\nDiet.\nNine-banded armadillos are mostly insectivores. They find their meals by pushing their snouts into soil and digging. They dig up grubs, beetles, ants, termites, and worms. They sometimes also eat amphibians, small reptiles, fungi, and carrion.\nBehavior.\nNine-banded armadillos do not live in groups. They are nocturnal, which means that they are lively at night instead of the day. The burrows they make are about wide, deep, and long.\nArmadillos usually mark their territory. The armadillo can jump in the air when scared. This may be dangerous on roads, because it could get hit by a car.\nReproduction.\nMating is usually done from July to August in the Northern Hemisphere and November to January in the Southern Hemisphere. A single egg is fertilized. Then it splits into four identical embryos, each which makes its own placenta. The nine-banded armadillo gives birth to genetically identical quadruplets.\nAfter birth, the quadruplets remain in the burrow, drinking the mother's milk for about three months. Then they begin to hunt for their meals with the mother. After six months to a year, they leave.\nA single female can produce up to 56 young over the course of her life."}

Blood cancer hurts the blood, bone marrow, lymph, and lymphatic system. Sometimes more than one body part is hurt.\nThe cause is usually different from other types of cancer. The way to find out if a person has this cancer is also different. \nPeople with blood cancers see a kind of doctor called a hematologist (blood doctor) or oncologist (cancer doctor). There are other blood problems that are not blood cancers. A blood doctor also helps people with those problems.\nMedical terms.\nTumors of the hematopoietic (blood cell forming) and lymphoid tissues are local growths. Hematopoietic and lymphoid \"malignancies\" are cancers that affect the blood, bone marrow, lymph, and lymphatic system. As the blood and lymph connect through both the circulatory system and the immune system, a disease affecting one will often affect the others as well.\nTypes.\nThere are three types: \nFinding out.\nA doctor will do some tests to find out if a person has a blood cancer. One common test is a complete blood count. The cells that circulate in the bloodstream are generally divided into three types: white blood cells (leukocytes), red blood cells (erythrocytes), and platelets (thrombocytes). The relative proportions is what picks up indications of a problem.\nSometimes the doctor will take a very small piece of the body out, to look at it. This is called a \"biopsy\". Bone marrow is where new blood is made in the body. A bone marrow biopsy looks at the blood-making parts to see if they have cancer.\nTreatment.\nPeople with blood cancer often take drugs called chemotherapy or immunotherapy. If the blood cancer is in one place, they may have radiotherapy. A bone marrow transplant is a difficult way to kill blood cancers.\nHow many people get it.\nThousands of people get blood cancers. Each year, 30,000 people in the United Kingdom (UK) learn that they have blood cancer.\nLymphomas are more common than leukemias."}

Irradiance is the power of electromagnetic radiation per unit area. One of the possible causes of global dimming is pollution. It affects the water cycle by decreasing evaporation and by decreasing the rain in some areas. Global dimming also causes the earth to cool down. This cooling effect may cover the effect of greenhouse gases caused by global warming.\nCauses and effects.\nAir pollutants absorb solar energy and reflect sunlight back into space. The pollutants can also become the core for cloud droplets. Water droplets in clouds fuse around the pollutants. More pollutants create clouds with more number of smaller droplets. The smaller droplets make clouds to reflect more light. This causes more sunlight to be reflected back into space and less light reaches the Earth's surface.\nClouds stop the heat from both going in and out from the earth. This process is complex and it changes according to the time, location and the height above the sea level. During the day, more sunlight stops from going in. This cools down the Earth. During the night, the heat in earth stops from going out. This slows down the heat from going out the earth.\nVolcanic ash can also stops the sunlight from going in and out from the earth. Decreases in the earth's temperatures are observed after large volcanic eruptions. Some examples are the eruptions of Mount Agung in Bali that erupted in 1963, El Chichon (Mexico, 1983), Ruiz (Colombia, 1985), and Mount Pinatubo (Philippines, 1991). Even for large eruptions, the ash clouds do not stay for a long time.\nRelationship to water cycle.\nGlobal dimming is harming the water cycle of the earth. It reduces the rain, which is very important for the fresh water. In 2001, researchers did a study at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The research suggested that the pollutants have a bad effect on the water cycle. Another global dimming event happened in 2006 in northern hemisphere during hurricane season. The NASA study found that the big dust storms happened in Sahara Desert during June and July cause the dust to go over the Atlantic Ocean. The dust forms a cover over the ocean and causes it to cool down. This reduces the hurricanes' development."}

It uses principles of design and organization of interior spaces, color and furnishings. The goal of interior design is to create an environment for living that is functional, efficient and aesthetically pleasing for the occupants.\nInterior design is universal among people of all times and races. All known human settlements have shown this. Ancient Egypt is one example. Painting interior walls have existed for at least 5,000 years, with examples found as far north as the Ness of Brodgar, as have standardised interiors, as seen in the associated Skara Brae settlement.\nInterior designer.\nInterior designers are people skilled at using the elements of design and organizing interior spaces in functional and aesthetic ways. They may offer advice on the layout of spaces, building and technical issues such as lighting, sound, and temperature control. \nThey must have professional knowledge of issues affecting the physical comfort, safety and convenience of an interior's occupants. Also they must be familiar with local building codes, government regulations and have drawing and presentation skills.\nImportant concepts in interior design include color selection, color palettes and how they affect the perception of space and mood, spatial organization, knowledge of fabrics, finishes, design styles and trends.\nIn order for interior designers to do a perfect job, they must follow the steps in the design process:\nTypes.\nThere are specific types of interior design and specializations. Some types of interior design are residential design, commercial design, hospitality design, healthcare design, universal design, exhibition design, and spatial branding.\nResidential design.\nThe designer offers advice and tries to determine what their clients' needs are in their home life, their personality and style preferences, an interview process usually called the client brief. They may do a lifestyle questionnaire and room condition checklist. \nResidential designers seek to make their clients' home more aesthetic, efficient and comfortable. They discuss any and all proposed changes with the client, show them decorating or remodeling plans, samples and examples of the proposed alterations for approval. \nCommercial design.\nCommercial interior designers design public spaces such as office buildings, community centers, museums, hotels, stores, warehouses, and libraries. In commercial design the designer has to create an environment that includes function and aesthetics. A commercial interior designer's work includes selecting paint colors, choosing artwork, accounting for acoustics and lighting, picking appropriate furniture, and placing all these together in the manner most appropriate to the venue. Recently commercial interior designers have worked with indoor plants and agro-inventions such as the Grofie Greenwall, which allows firms to bring a tropical forest, vegetable or herb garden right into the office, in order to reconnect office workers with nature.\nHospitality design.\nHospitality designers design the places which have any relationship between guest and host such as hotels. This includes the reception and entertainment of guests, visitors or strangers, resorts, membership clubs, conventions, attractions, special events, and other services for travelers and tourists.\nHealthcare design.\nHealthcare design is related to hospitals and how to make a good space to make the patient and staff very comfortable. Healthcare designers compare the evidence-based design with evidence-based medicine; that knowledge can help ensures that future healthcare facilities are built to improve clinical outcomes. In addition, a deeper understanding of the relationship between the built environment and quality of care will help ensure that healthcare facilities are designed to meet the diverse needs of patients, families, and staff.\nUniversal design.\nUniversal design is the design for all people around the world and to creating environments and products those are usable by all people to the greatest extent possible.\nExhibition design.\nThere are many different types of exhibit, ranging from museum exhibitions to retail and trades show spaces, to themed attractions, zoos, and visitor centers. All types of exhibits aim to communicate a message through engaging their audiences in meaningful and compelling interactions. Use a wide range of technologies and techniques to develop experiences that will resonate with diverse audiences\u2013enabling these targeted audiences to access the messages, stories, and objects of an exhibit.\nSpace management.\nApart from designing an empty apartment or home, an interior designer is also responsible for space management that not only lets any individual walk properly but also gives them a functional home."}

The battle, called Operation Praying Mantis by the U.S. side, was started in retaliation for the 14 April mining of the USS \"Samuel B. Roberts\" (FFG-58) by Iran. U.S. forces sank one frigate, one gunboat, and as many as six armed speedboats in the engagement and seriously damaged a second frigate.\nThe downing of Iran Air 655.\nOn 3 July 1988, 290 people were killed when an Iran Air Airbus A300 passenger jet was shot down over the strait by the United States Navy guided missile cruiser USS \"Vincennes\".\nCollision between USS \"Newport News\" and tanker \"Mogamigawa\".\nOn 8 January 2007, the nuclear submarine USS \"Newport News\", traveling submerged, hit M/V \"Mogamigawa\", a 300,000-ton Japanese-flagged very large crude tanker, south of the strait.

U.S. officials said Iran was harassing and provoking their naval vessels. Iranian officials said this was not true.\nIranian defence policy.\nOn 29 June 2008, the commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guard, Ali Mohammed Safari, said that if Iran were attacked by Israel or the United States, it would close off the Strait of Hormuz. This would be bad for the oil markets. The US said that such an action by Iran would be an act of war. The U.S. would not allow this.\nNaval activity in 2008.\nIn the last week of July 2008, in the Operation Brimstone, dozens of U.S. and foreign navy ships prepared for battle in the shallow waters off the coast of Iran.\nAs of 11 August 2008, more than 40 U.S. and allied ships were on the way to the Strait of Hormuz. There would be a total of five battle groups, not counting submarines.\nCollision between USS \"Hartford\" and USS \"New Orleans\".\nOn 20 March 2009, United States Navy Hartford collided with the New Orleans in the strait. The collision slightly injured 15 sailors aboard the Hartford. It opened a fuel tank aboard the New Orleans, spilling of marine diesel fuel.\nTensions in 2011\u20132012.\nOn 27 December 2011, Iranian Vice President Mohammad-Reza Rahimi said Iran would stop oil supply from the Strait of Hormuz should Iran be limited in their oil exports.\nOn 3 January 2012, Iran threatened to take action if the U.S. Navy moves an aircraft carrier back into the Persian Gulf.\nOn 7 January 2012, the United Kingdom said that it would be sending the Type 45 destroyer to the Persian Gulf. \"Daring\", which is the lead ship of her class is said to be one of the \"most advanced warships\" in the world. The ship will have its first mission in the Persian Gulf. The British Government said that this move has been long-planned, as \"Daring\" will replace another Armilla patrol frigate.\nOn 9 January 2012, Iranian Defense Minister Ahmad Vahidi said that Iran would not close the Strait of Hormuz.\nBy 23 January, a flotilla was made by countries against Iran's threats to close the Hormuz Strait. These ships were in the Persian Gulf and Arabian Sea off the coast of Iran."}

All the rock under the sandstone is igneous and metamorphosed igneous rock. \nThe sandstones are red beds laid down by rivers and lakes in a landscape of low rocky hills. A great thickness of red sandstone, brought in by rivers, buried the old hills. This took place in the Proterozoic, 1,200 to 544 million years ago (mya). There are older and younger sandstone groups, with a long period between them. The lower sandstone is a breccia, with broken fragments of earlier rocks.\nAs a result of later periods of rifting and mountain-building, some of the Torridian sandstone lies under the sea, and some of it is uplifted into mountains."}

Whitman sees the love of comrades as the backbone of all nations, the root of religious sentiments, the source of personal anguish and joy, and the answer to the big questions of life.

In computer science, these tools for keeping track of information, or data, are called data structures.\nA hash table is a data structure that uses a hash function to keep track of where data is put. \nEach piece of information to be stored has a name, which is called a key. For example, a key might be a person's name. Each name is matched up to one piece of data called a value, like the person's telephone number. \nThe data is kept in another data structure called an array, which is like many boxes, or buckets, in a column to hold data. Each box has a number starting from 0 and counting up. \nThe idea behind a hash table is to figure out which box to put data by using only its name. This means, no matter how many boxes are filled up, you can always find information quickly if you have its name. The hash table uses a hash function to figure out which number to put data in from its name. The hash function reads a name and gives back a number. \nA good Hash Table will always find information at the same speed, no matter how much data is put in. A lot of Hash Tables also let the user put key/value pairs (a name and its data) in and take them out at the same speed.\nBecause of this, Hash Tables can often find information faster than other tools, such as search trees or other table lookup structure. As a result, they are used in many kinds of computer software. They are used most for associative arrays, databases, caches, and sets."}

They are most common in Australia and New Guinea, but are also found in New Zealand, the Pacific islands as far east as Samoa and Tonga, and the islands to the north and west of New Guinea. Bali, on the other side of the Wallace Line, has a single species.\nHoneyeaters and the Australian chats (Epthianura) make up the family Meliphagidae. In total there are 182 species in 42 genera. About half of them live in Australia, and many of the others are from New Guinea. Although honeyeaters look and behave much like other nectar-feeding birds around the world (such as the sunbirds and flowerpeckers), they are not related.\nThere is an important partnership between honeyeaters and Australian flowering plants. A great many Australian plants are fertilised by honeyeaters, particularly the Proteaceae, Myrtaceae, and Epacridaceae. It is known that the honeyeaters are important in New Zealand as well, and scientists believe they are just as important in other areas.\nDescription.\nUnlike the hummingbirds of America, honeyeaters do not usually hover (beat their wings fast to stay in the same air space). However, smaller members of the family do hover hummingbird-style to collect nectar from time to time. Usually honeyeaters move quickly from perch to perch in the outer leaves, stretching up or sideways or hanging upside. Many honeyeaters have a highly developed brush-tipped tongue, covered with bristles which soak up liquids readily. The tongue is flicked rapidly and repeatedly into a flower, the upper mandible then squeezes liquid out when the bill is closed.\nAs well as nectar, all or nearly all honeyeaters take insects and other small creatures, usually by catching them in the air, sometimes by picking them off plants. A few of the larger species, such as the white-eared honeyeater, and the strong-billed honeyeater of Tasmania, search under bark for insects. Many species also eat fruit, and a small number eat large amounts of fruit, particularly in tropical rainforests and in semi-arid scrubland. The painted honeyeater is a mistletoe specialist. Most, however, live on a diet of nectar and insects. In general, the honeyeaters with long, fine bills eat more nectar, the shorter-billed species less so, but even specialised nectar eaters like the spinebills take extra insects to add protein to their diet when they are breeding.\nThe movements of honeyeaters are poorly understood. Many follow the flowering of favourite food plants. Arid zone species appear to travel further and less predictably than those of the more fertile areas. It seems probable that no single explanation will emerge: the general rule for honeyeater movements is that there is no general rule."}

They live on the skin, in the saliva and mouth, in the eyes, and in the gut and the rest of the gastrointestinal tract. They include bacteria, archaea, fungi and single-celled eukaryotes ('protozoa'). Everyone carries around far more of these microbes than the number of human cells in the body. The human body has about 100 trillion cells, and carries about ten times as many microorganisms \"in the intestines alone\".\nThe microbiome is \"the ecological community of commensal, symbiotic, and pathogenic microorganisms that literally share our body space\". The term was originally coined by Joshua Lederberg. He thought the microorganisms living in the human body in health and disease were important. Many scientific articles distinguish \"microbiome\" and \"microbiota\" to describe either the collective genomes of the microorganisms that live in an environmental niche or the microorganisms themselves, respectively. However, by the original definitions these terms are largely synonymous. \nSome of these organisms are useful for humans. However, most have no known effect. They are just symbionts: they live with us. Those which are expected to be present are members of the \"normal flora\". Under normal circumstances they do not cause disease, but may even help our health. Studies in 2009 asked whether our health is damaged if we reduce this biota. This is certainly the case with gut flora.\nAlthough \"flora\" refers to plants rather than bacteria, the term 'gut flora' is widely used and familiar to biologists. 'Biota' refers to the total collection of organisms in an ecosystem. The term 'microbiota' is best for bacteria and other microorganisms, but no doubt 'flora' will often be used. \nThe microbes being discussed are generally non-pathogenic (do not cause disease unless they grow abnormally); they exist in harmony and symbiotically with their hosts.\nResearchers have learned that much of the population of microbes found in the human body are not bacteria but a very old class of single-celled organisms called archaea. They include methanogens which produce methane and may cause flatulence."}

It was made at a monastery off the coast of Northumberland at Lindisfarne, about 700 AD.\nThe manuscript is now on display in the British Library. It is one of the finest works in the style which is called insular art. This combines Mediterranean, Anglo-Saxon and Celtic elements. At this time, Britain and Ireland shared a style which was different from that of the rest of Europe.\nThe Lindisfarne Gospels are thought to be by Eadfrith, a monk who became Bishop of Lindisfarne in 698 and died in 721. The Gospels are richly illustrated, and were originally in a fine leather binding covered with jewels and metals. During the Viking raids on Lindisfarne, this cover was lost, and a replacement was made in 1852. The text is written in a hand known as 'insular script'.\nIn the 10th century an Old English translation of the Gospels was written word-for-word between the lines of the Latin text. It was done by Aldred, Provost of Chester-le-Street. This is the oldest translation of the Gospels into English that we have. The Gospels may have been taken from Durham Cathedral during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, ordered by Henry VIII. In the 18th century the book was given to the British Museum. From there it went to the British Library when this was split off from the British Museum."}

The text of the Gospels is mostly taken from the Vulgate bible, and it has several passages from earlier versions of the Bible, such as the Vetus Latina. It is a masterwork of Western calligraphy. and Ireland's finest national treasure.\nThe illustrations and ornamentation of the Book of Kells are outstanding. The decoration combines traditional Christian iconography with the ornate swirling motifs typical of the art of the British Isles. Figures of humans, animals and mythical beasts, and Celtic knots and interlacing patterns in vibrant colours, enliven the manuscript's pages. Many of these minor decorative elements have Christian symbolism.\nThe manuscript today is 340 folios (separate sheets, written on one side). Since 1953, it has been bound in four volumes. The leaves are on high-quality calf vellum. There are ten full-page illustrations, and text pages that are vibrant with decorated initials and interlinear miniatures. The writing of the text itself appears to be the work of at least three different scribes. The colours used were gathered from many substances, some of which were imports from distant lands.\nThe manuscript takes its name from the Abbey of Kells which was its home for centuries. Today, it is on permanent display at the library of Trinity College, Dublin. The library usually displays two of the four volumes at a time, one showing a major illustration and the other showing a typical text page.\nReproductions.\nIn 1951, the Swiss publisher Urs Graf Verlag Bern produced the first facsimile of the Book of Kells. Most of the pages were reproduced in black-and-white photographs, and the edition also had 48 colour reproductions, including all of the full-page decorations.\nUnder licence from the Board of Trinity College Dublin, the art publishers Thames and Hudson produced a second facsimile edition in 1974. This edition had all the full-page illustrations in the manuscript and a section of text page ornamentation, with some enlarged details of the illustrations. The reproductions were all in full colour.\nBy 1986, Swiss publisher Faksimile-Verlag had a process that used gentle suction to straighten a page so that it could be photographed without touching it. They got permission to publish a new facsimile. After each page was photographed, a single-page facsimile was prepared so the colours could be carefully compared to the original and adjustments made where necessary. The completed work was published in 1990 in a two-volume set containing the full facsimile and scholarly commentary. One copy is held by the Anglican Church in Kells, on the site of the original monastery.\nIn 1994, Bernard Meehan, Keeper of Manuscripts at Trinity College Dublin, produced an introductory booklet on the Book of Kells, with 110 colour images of the manuscript.\nA digital copy of the manuscript was produced by Trinity College in 2006. A rare copy of the Book of Kells can also be seen for free at The Little Museum of Dublin."}

His mother, Devorah Hasofer, is a known singer/songwriter who has released four albums and mostly performs in the Hasidic communities in Australia and Israel. He is a drummer from the age of five and in his preteen years he participated in the recordings of his mother's albums and performed with her as a special guest. \nAt the age of 14, Hasofer's parents sent him to Jerusalem to study in a yeshiva. He spent a year in the yeshiva. After that he stayed in Israel, \"left the Jewish way of life and did a lot of stupid things.\" Many of the things he did were illegal. His family's move to Beitar Illit in 1998 did not help stop his wildness.\nIn 2000, at age 17, DeScribe joined the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) as a combat sharpshooter (a kind of semi professional sniper). He served for three years at the height of the Second Intifada. He saw intense action on almost a daily basis. After being discharged, he stayed in Israel. He organized a concert tour featuring affiliates of the Wu-Tang Clan Remedy and Killah Priest, gaining an inside view of the hip hop scene. \nAround 2004, he began to feel a strong desire to leave his bad lifestyle and return to a religious one. \u201cI started to change the way I thought and behaved and in Judaism I found something that was real that brought happiness to a dark place in my life,\u201d he has said. In 2006, he moved to Brooklyn to attend Tifferet Menachem. There he was given permission to set up a music studio inside the yeshiva.\nCareer.\nIn 2008, after an early music video was picked up by the Israeli media, he was invited to play the Highline Ballroom in New York with Perry Farrell. Shortly after that, he had met Rohan Marley (Bob Marley\u2019s son) by chance on the streets of New York City. Marley later asked DeScribe to create the theme song for his company, Marley Coffee. Marley Coffee supports environmental and social justice causes in Jamaica and around the world.

The proceeds from the song benefit The Friendship Circle, a nonprofit organization that helps children with disabilities.\nArtistic style.\n\"My music is about unity,\" DeScribe has said, \"and we all have one God whether we are Jewish, Christian or Muslim.

An offspring formed from the union of a sperm and an egg develops as a female, and an unfertilized egg develops as a male. This means that the males have half the number of chromosomes that a female has, and are haploid.\nThe haplodiploid sex-determination system has a number of peculiarities. Most importantly, the relatedness between the sisterhood of worker bees in a hive or nest is 0.75. This means the workers are significantly more closely related than siblings in other sex determination systems. It is this point which drives the kin selection theory of how eusociality evolved.p465 Whether haplodiploidy did in fact pave the way for the evolution of eusociality is still a matter of debate.\nThe thing to remember is that in normal sexual reproduction, the father has two sets of chromosomes, and crossing over takes place between the chromatids of each pair during the meiosis which produces the sperm. Therefore, \"the sperms are not identical\", because in each chromosome of a pair there will be different alleles at many of the loci. But when the father is haploid \"all the sperm will be identical\" (except for a small number where gene mutations have taken place in the germline). So, \"as long as all the female queen mates only with one male\", all the female offspring will inherit the male's chromosome 100% intact. In fact in Hymenoptera, the males almost all produce enough sperm to last the female for a whole lifetime.\nAnother feature of the haplodiploidy system is that lethal and deleterious alleles will be removed from the population rapidly because they will automatically be expressed in the males."}

The beds were laid down 125 million years ago (mya) in the Sihetun area, near Beipiao City, in western Liaoning Province. \nThe most significant, and highly unusual, characteristic of this dinosaur is its apparent adaptation to an herbivorous or omnivorous lifestyle. Its name refers to its rodent-like front teeth, which show wear patterns commonly found in plant-eating dinosaurs.\nDescription.\nThe initial description of \"Incisivosaurus\" showed that the skull, about 10\u00a0cm in length (4\u00a0inches), had the most complete dentition known for any oviraptorosaur. Their cladistic analysis indicated that \"Incisivosaurus\" lies at the base of the oviraptorosaurs, making it more basal than \"Caudipteryx\" and \"Oviraptor\". The distinguishing skeletal features of \"Incisivosaurus\", include a long snout that made up about half the total length of the skull, a slender lower jaw with a long fenestra (opening), and its distinctive, large, flattened front teeth. In addition to these unique features, \"Incisivosaurus\" shared many traits with more typical oviraptorosaurs, so it is classified in that group. \nSeveral features, including its numerous teeth (most advanced oviraptorids were toothless), show that it was a primitive member of the group. Several features of the skull are similar to the therizinosaurs, another theropod group that was probably herbivorous.\nIn 2009 the holotype skull was scanned and analyzed in three dimensions. The results indicated that \"Incisivosaurus\" had fewer bird-like air spaces in the skull bones than later oviraptorosaurs did. It also found that \"Incisivosaurus\" had reduced olfactory lobes and expanded optic lobes, like ornithomimids. These features of oviraptorosaurs were similar to those of birds. \n\"Incisivosaurus\" is assumed to have been feathered like most other maniraptoran theropods. Its total body length has been estimated at just under 1 meter (3\u00a0ft.). It is possible that \"Incisivosaurus\" is the same species as \"Protarchaeopteryx\", though more fossil specimens are needed before the two can be directly compared."}

The hamlet was designed in 1783 by Richard Mique and Hubert Robert as a play space for Queen Marie Antoinette. It was here that she played the simple country girl in a straw hat and plain dress with her friends. About twelve structures form the hamlet. Some were working farm structures and some were structures for the Queen's amusement and use such as the mill. The hamlet fell into neglect after the French Revolution. Restoration was undertaken in the 1990s, and the hamlet is now open to the public.\nDesign and construction.\nPicturesque hamlets such as Le Hameau de la Reine were not unknown in 18th century France. The Prince de Cond\u00e9 had one at Chantilly and there was a village at M\u00e9r\u00e9veille. The creation of these villages was influenced by the natural philosophy extolled by Rousseau and the country life genre paintings of painters Greuze, Le Nain, and Chardin. Le Hameau was designed for Queen Marie Antoinette by her favorite architect Richard Mique and the painter Hubert Robert. The painters Tol\u00e8de and Dardignac painted thousands of little cracks and false half-timbering in the structures to suggest picturesque humbleness, poverty, and age. All the structures in the hamlet were more or less modelled upon similar structures in Normandy and Flanders. Construction on the hamlet started in 1783 and was completed in four or five years.\nStructures at the hamlet.\nThe purpose of the hamlet was to give the Queen a place to play at the simple life, far from the busy French court. The hamlet is set among meadows at the edge of a lake created by waters channeled from Marly. The structures are divided into two groups. One group was used by the Queen for her pleasure and amusement. The other group was used for farm work. The farm produced milk and eggs for the Queen. Cheeses were made in the dairy. The Queen tasted this produce in a marble room. \nThe structures are:\nLife in the hamlet.\nThe Queen loved the simple life. It was a break from the stiffness of the court. She played at being a peasant girl in the hamlet. She wore plain muslin dresses and a straw hat. She ate the produce from the farm. Only her dearest friends were allowed into the hamlet. There was a ball room (a room for holding dances) and a billiards room. She wanted her children to experience real animals and kept two cows at the hamlet, Blondie and Brownie. Both were washed and brushed before a visit from the Queen. Ducks, geese, and sheep were kept at the hamlet as well as a billygoat from Switzerland.\nDecline and restoration.\nThe French people believed the Queen was selfishly amusing herself at a time when France was nearing a national crisis. After the French Revolution, the hamlet was deserted and fell into neglect. Restoration was conducted in the 1990s. The Queen's Hamlet is now open to the public."}

The Sugar Plum Fairy was first danced by Antonietta Dell'Era and the Prince by Pavel Gerdt. The \"pas\" is sometimes danced outside the ballet and is sometimes danced in ballet competitions.\nThe \"pas de deux\" is structured in four sections (or movements): first, an \"Andante maestoso\"; second, a Tarantella for the male dancer; third a dance for the ballerina called the \"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy\"; and fourth and finally a quick, energetic movement for both dancers.\nMarius Petipa, Ballet Master at the Mariinsky Theatre, wanted music \"colossal in effect\" for the opening \"Andante maestoso\" movement. The music is made up of descending (falling) scales for cellos. A second, contrasting section is written for oboe and bass clarinet. The music ends with a great climax for trombones. The musical theme of the \"Andante maestoso\" is similar to Tchaikovsky's death themes in the Fifth and Sixth symphonies.\nThe \"Andante maestoso\" movement used a device on the stage called a \"reika\". This was a small platform or wagon set in a track. It was operated under the stage. In \"The Nutcracker\", the Sugar Plum Fairy stepped upon a scarf that Prince Coqueluche had placed on the \"reika\". The Prince pulled the scarf and, as the \"reika\" was moved from one side of the stage to the other, it seemed that the Sugar Plum Fairy was lighter than air. "}

Shortly after their ship left Greece, it put into an island. Hylas set off to look for fresh water. As he neared a spring, the nymphs living within it fell in love with him. They pulled him into the water. He was never seen again. When he did not come back to the ship, Heracles was overcome with grief. He searched the island a long time. The ship set sail without him. Some say Hylas drowned. Others say he fell in love with the nymphs and would not desert them."}

To do this exercise one holds something that is high above the head with both hands so their body is hanging free under it. Bend your knees like your shins are parallel to the ground, it makes easier to do. Then one pulls oneself up and stops when the chin is above the hands. This mostly helps the back muscles but also uses the muscles on top of the arms (biceps) and stomach (abdominals). It is an exercise that does not need any special equipment except something high that a person can hold on to.\nMany different ways to position the wrist and hands are used. Some say these are all different exercises, but they are all similar. Some kinds of pull-ups use weights on a belt to make the exercise harder.\nMany who use bad form on this exercise will kick with their legs or jump and jerk with the legs to help the motion. Good form is holding the low parts of the body still and only using the arms to pull the body up."}
{"id": "349469", "revid": "54777", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=349469", "title": "Ancient Greek wrestling", "text": "Greek wrestling was a grappling combat sport practiced by the Ancient Greeks. A wrestler's objective (aim, goal) was to throw his opponent to the ground from a standing position. A point (or fall) was scored when a wrestler's back or shoulders touched the ground. Three points were needed to win a match. Holds were restricted to the upper body. Unlike modern wrestling, there were no weight divisions or time limits. As a result, the sport was dominated by large strong men and boys who could defeat smaller but more skillful opponents. \nEach city had place for wrestling, called a palaestra. Some large cities had several palaestrae. Wrestlers trained and competed in the nude. The sport was the first added to the Ancient Olympic Games that was not a footrace. Two ancient Greek wrestlers that are remembered today are Leontiskos of Messene and Milo of Croton. Leontiskos is infamous for winning the Olympics after breaking his opponent's fingers, and Milo is famous for winning five Olympic championships. Wrestling was a popular subject for Greek sculpture, painting, and literature. \nBackground.\nGreek wrestling was known to the ancients as \"orthe pale\" (\"upright (or erect) wrestling\"). Legend says that Theseus of Athens invented wrestling. The wrestler's objective (aim) was to throw his opponent to the ground from a standing position. Holds were restricted to the upper body and pinning an opponent to the ground was unknown. Wrestling on the ground was permitted only in the sports known to the Greeks as\u00a0\"kato pale\" (\"ground wrestling\") and \"pankration\". \nA point was scored for a fall. A fall occurred when a wrestler's back or shoulders touched the ground. Three points were required to win a match. Wrestling was less rough than the pankration and required less space. As a result, it was the most popular sport among Greek athletes. It was an event in the pentathlon (and could be the deciding event) but it was a separate event as well, with the same techniques. Wrestling was mentioned numerous times in Greek literature, especially poetry. \nThe remains of a papyrus wrestling manual from the 2nd century AD reveal that the Greeks were familiar with headlocks, joint locks, shoulder holds, and other techniques used by modern wrestlers. Because there were no time limits to matches, some would end in draws. A wrestler could submit under a chokehold and \"tap out\". Wrestlers were sometimes killed in contest, but their opponents were never held responsible for homicide.\nPalaestra.\n \nWrestling was taught and practiced in a building called the \"palaestra\". There were many of these wrestling schools across Greece. The first palaestras were built about the 6th century BC. They were privately owned, but by the 5th century BC palaestras were being built at the public expense. Palaestras were built until the end of the Age of the Roman Empire. The ancient Greek scholar Plutarch writes that only wrestling and the pankration were taught and practiced in the palaestra. Boxing and other sports were taught and practiced in gymnasiums. \nThe palaestra consisted of a square or rectangular yard open to the sky. This yard was used for training and practice. The yard was surrounded by colonnades. During rainy weather, wrestling and the pankration were practiced under the colonnades. Rooms adjoining the colonnades were used for lectures, bathing, dressing and undressing, game playing, socializing, and the storage of equipment and olive oil. Gay sex was rampant in the palaestra, despite official efforts to curb it. \nNudity.\nGreek athletes were the few athletes in the ancient world who practiced and competed in the nude. Homer's wrestlers in \"Iliad\" wore loincloths, but shortly after the Age of Homer, Greek athletes started to strip. It is not known why. Pausanias says athletes wanted to imitate Orsippos of Megara, a runner who won a footrace at Olympia in 720 BC after losing his loincloth. Dionysios of Halikarnassos and Thucydides credited a Spartan with the custom. \nOther legends say that a runner tripped on his loincloth and officials banned it as unsafe. Some say that athletes stripped to prove that they were males, or because they could run better in the nude. Other reasons have been given: athletes stripped for erotic reasons, or for cult reasons, or for good luck, or as a democratic equalizer. Some say they stripped because they were proud of their muscular bodies and their tans.\nThe Greeks called the penis a \"dog\". Athletes sometimes used a cord called a \"dog leash\" to tie off the foreskin of the penis. It is unknown if this custom had sexual or aesthetic meanings. It appears to have been a matter of personal preference. Tying the foreskin is sometimes a subject in vase painting.\nWrestler's equipment.\nThe Greek wrestler carried three items to the palaestra: an oil flask, a scraper, and a sponge. The oil flask (\"aryballos\") was a ceramic container with a wide lip and narrow mouth that held a wrestler's daily allotment of olive oil. These containers took a variety of shapes. Some were fashioned to resemble birds, animals, or human body parts such as the head, foot, or penis. Most were simply globes without a resting base. \nThe scraper (\"strigil\" or \"stlengis\") was a tool with a concave blade. It was made of bronze, silver, glass, or iron. It was used to scrape the accumulated olive oil and sweat (\"gloios\") from an athlete's body. The gloios was sold for its alleged medicinal value. It was used to treat inflammations of the joints, the vulva and anus, for genital warts and syphilitic lesions, muscle sprains, and pains. Once the sweat and oil was removed, the wrestler bathed using a sponge (\"spongos\").\nPreparation.\nHeavy athleteswrestlers, pankratiasts, and boxersshared the same buildings, practiced the same exercises, used the same equipment (punching bags), and followed the same high-protein diets of meat. Wrestlers at Olympia once were given light boxing practice as a preparation for competition. \nWrestlers first rubbed their bodies with olive oil to keep sand out of their pores. The wrestler then dusted himself with a fine powder. He sometimes practiced with a partner to learn tactics, but, for the most part, wrestlers simply wrestled. Rhythm was important, so wrestlers practiced and competed to flute music. Unlike boxing and the pankration, wrestling practice was conducted at full bore. Wrestlers kept their hair cut short to avoid giving opponents something to grasp or wore a skullcap to keep their hair in place.\nCompetition.\nWrestlers were paired by drawing lots (\"kleroi\"). These lots were about the size of a bean and marked with a letter. There were two lots for each letter. The lots were mixed in a pitcher. Each wrestler drew one lot and was paired with the wrestler who drew the same letter. If there was an odd number of wrestlers, the last letter would be marked on only one lot. The wrestler who drew it would not compete in the first round.\nA match began in a position known as the \"standing together\" (\"systasis\"). The wrestlers would lean into each other until their foreheads touched. From this position, each would try to throw his opponent to the ground. A wrestler might lunge forward gripping his opponent's shoulders or wrapping his arms around his opponent's torso in a \"bear hug\". The two might avoid close contact during the initial struggle, with each fighting for a grip on his opponent's legs or arms. Eventually, one would find the grip he needed to throw his opponent. A wrestler might try to grip the hands, wrists, or arms of his opponent and throw him with a sudden twist (\"akrocheirismos\"), or come to close quarters and gain a hold on the body.\nA match was divided into sections marked by \"falls\". The wrestlers re-engaged without an interval (break) after a fall. Sports scholars and historians are uncertain about what exactly constituted a fall. They agree however that it involved touching at least the shoulders or the back to the earth. Three falls were a victory and the match was ended.\nRules and holds.\nIn \"Combat Sports in the Ancient World\", Michael Poliakoff points out that Greek wrestling was a brutal sport and tolerated some rough tactics. It was less brutal than the other two combat sportsthe pankration and boxingbut, while striking was forbidden and finger-breaking was eventually made illegal, some limb-threatening moves, neckholds, and strangleholds were permitted. Wrestling was considered a sport of craft because of its large number of leverages and holds. It was a sport that tested the \"martial virtues: cunning, boldness, courage, self-reliance, and perseverance\" Poliakoff writes, and the Greeks \"expected that an accomplished and educated man would practice and enjoy wrestling as an adult.\" \nThe wrestler's objective (aim) was to score a fall on his opponent. Touching the back or shoulders to the ground was a fall. There was no defined wrestling space such as a ring or circle and there was no time limit. Holds were limited to the upper body and foot tripping was permitted. \nThere were no weight divisions in Greek wrestling; the sport was dominated by the large and strong. These men and boys could defeat a smaller but more skilled opponent simply by their size. Three falls were required for a win in formal competition. Five bouts were possible in a match. The ancients never awarded points for successful tactics, as in modern wrestling, and \"pinning\" or holding an opponent to the earth was unknown. Strangling or choking an opponent in order to force him to concede (admit) defeat was permitted. \nKeeping an opponent in a hold from which he could not escape was also a fall, as was stretching a man full length on the ground. A wrestler could drop to one knee, but this was risky. Once two wrestlers fell to the earth together, it was sometimes difficult to determine exactly what was happening, and disputes arose. Throwing an opponent out of the \"skamma\" (wrestling pit) was not a fall, but counted as a victory nonetheless.\nThree classic moves in Greek wrestling were the \"flying mare\", the \"body hold\", and fancy foot trips. In the flying mare, the wrestler would grip his opponent's arm, throw him over his shoulder, and send him to the ground flat on his back. In the body hold, a wrestler would grip his opponent about the waist, lift him in the air, flip him, and drop him head first to the ground. Elaborate foot trips would send a wrestler crashing to the ground, but old school wrestlers who relied on sheer strength scorned fancy foot trips. Punching, kicking, and gouging soft body areas were not allowed. A point was scored if a wrestler tapped out because of a submission hold. It was possible for a match to last for five rounds.\nWrestling and the Ancient Olympic Games.\nWrestling was an event in the ancient Olympic Games. It was added to the Olympic program in 708 BC. It was the first competition added to the Olympics that was not a footrace. Boys' wrestling was added to the Olympic program in 632 BC. Wrestlers prayed to Herakles for strength and Hermes for speed. The wrestling competition was held in the stadium, not the Palaestra at Olympia.\nWrestling, boxing, and the \"pankration\" (the contact sports), were held on the fourth day of the Olympic festival. There were no weight divisions in Greek wrestling. The sixteen Olympic wrestlers were heavyweights with muscles \"the size of boulders\" according to one witness. Fans gave wrestlers nicknames that fit their physiques such as \"the bear\" or \"the lion\". \nThe ancient coach Philostratus thought an even temperament and fine physique were important for a wrestler. He liked a wrestler with a straight back, a solid thigh turned outwards, and wrote that \"narrow buttocks are weak, fat ones slow, but well-formed buttocks are an asset for everything.\"\nLeontiskos was an Olympic wrestling champion in 456 and 452 BC. Although rules against breaking an opponent's fingers were made in the 6th century BC, Leontiskos won by using just this very tactic. Milo of Croton was another Olympic herothe only wrestler to win five Olympic championships. He was defeated in his sixth attempt when he was forty. The Olympic wrestler Polydamas was killed when he tried to hold up the roof of a cave during an earthquake.\nWrestlers were praised for their physical beauty. The inscription on the monument to Theognetos of Aegina reads:\n&lt;poem&gt;\n&lt;/poem&gt;"}

The lower part of the outer walls were made of stone and the upper part of brick. Inside was a sand-covered yard open to the sky. This yard was surrounded on all four sides with colonnades of Doric columns. In bad weather, the athletes practiced under these colonnades.\nOff these colonnades were rooms where the athletes dressed and undressed, rubbed themselves with olive oil, dusted themselves with powder or sand, and met friends. There was a tub (1.5 meters deep) in the corner of the yard that was used for cold baths. There were rooms for the storage of oil and equipment.\nIn 195556, the German Archaeological Institute partly restored the palaestra. Complete restoration is not possible because many of the columns have been completely destroyed."}

People could make train reservations, check stock prices, search the telephone directory, have a mail box, and chat.\nIn February 2009, France Telecom said the Minitel network still had 10 million monthly connections. One-million were to the directory. France Telecom ended the service on 30 June 2012.\nBusiness model.\nMillions of terminals were free to telephone subscribers. That meant many people and businesses had access immediately. People who got Minitel did not get a regular paper telephone directory.\nMinitel gave access to these services:\nMany new companies started to try to make money using the network. This was like the later dot-com bubble. Many of the companies failed. Some people criticized pornographic services on Minitel because children could access them. The government did not make rules about pornography on Minitel. The government also made a tax on pornographic online services.\nFinances.\nPayment methods\nFrance T\u00e9l\u00e9com charged Minitel users at rates of up to \u20ac1 a minute. The rates depend on the service called. Most services were much cheaper than the maximum. France T\u00e9l\u00e9com then paid part of the fee to the companies that operate Minitel servers.\nPhonebook.\nThe most popular service of the Minitel was the \"Annuaire Electronique\" at the phone number \"11\". On 18 October 1996, access to the Phonedirectory changed to \"3611\". Companies could add up to 3 lines of information to the listing. There were also advertisements on the phone directory pages.\nTerminals.\nMinitel terminals have a text based screen, keyboard and modem. The screen can show simple graphics. Minitel terminals use the AZERTY keyboard, not the QWERTY keyboard. Users could buy printers to attach to the terminals.\nNetwork.\nThe Minitel modem usually dialed a special number to connect to a PAVI (\"Point d'Acc\u00e8s VId\u00e9otexte\", \"videotext access point\"). The PAVI sent information to the correct servers on the Transpac X.25 network. In France the most common dial number was \"36 15\". \"36 17\" was for more expensive services. Minitel services names often started with this number. So, the \"36 15\" number at the front of the name was like the \".com\" on Internet web sites.\nMinitel used a half-duplex asymmetric data rate via its modem. It downlinked at 1200 bit/s and uplinked at 75 bit/s. This allowed fast downloads, for the time. The system was called '1275', but the correct name was V.23. This system was only for Minitel and copies of Minitel in other countries.\nSimilar services.\nThe United Kingdom had a similar service called Prestel."}

The roof tiles, the gargoyles, and the sculptures were made of marble. The temple measured 64.12 meters by 27.66 meters. It was 20.25 meters high. The temple had six columns at the ends and thirteen columns along both sides. The height of each column was 10.45 meters.\nA ramp at the eastern end led to the \"prodomos\".

The sculptures of the west pediment depicted the story of the Centaurs and the Lapiths. This story is about the contest between barbarity and civilization.

Emperor Theodosius II ordered the temple burned to the ground in 426 AD. Earthquakes destroyed it in 522 AD and in 551. "}

The use of large amounts of pesticides for crops, and of medication for animal stocks is common. This is a contrast to traditional agriculture, which does not get as much output per area. When agriculture is intensified, this means that the amount of work needed goes up, until the worker is replaced by a machine. At that point, there will only need to be a few workers to operate the machines. Intensive farming has often been done as a response to rising population levels. It is criticised, because the standards of animal welfare are low. Intensive animal farming leads to increased pollution and to health issues.\nModern day forms of intensive crop based agriculture involve the use of mechanical ploughing, chemical fertilizers, plant growth regulators or pesticides. It is associated with the increasing use of agricultural mechanization, which have enabled a substantial increase in production, yet have also dramatically increased environmental pollution by increasing erosion and poisoning water with agricultural chemicals.\nHistory.\nAgricultural development in Britain between the 16th century and the mid-19th century saw a massive increase in agricultural productivity and output. This in turn contributed to increase in population growth.\nIndustrial agriculture arose in the Industrial Revolution. By the early 19th century, agricultural techniques, implements, seed stocks, and cultivars had improved so much.\nHorse-drawn machinery such as the McCormick reaper improved harvesting. Inventions such as the cotton gin reduced the cost of processing. During this same period, farmers began to use threshers and tractors that were powered with steam. In 1892, the first gasoline-powered tractor was successfully made. Mechanical harvesters, planters, transplanters, and other equipment were then developed, further improved agriculture. These inventions increased yields and allowed individual farmers to manage larger farms.\nNitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) were discovered to be very important in plant growth. This led to the manufacture of synthetic fertilizers, further increasing crop yields.\nThe discovery of vitamins and their role in nutrition, in the first two decades of the 20th century, led to vitamin supplements, which in the 1920s allowed some livestock to be raised indoors, reducing their exposure to adverse natural elements.[\"citation needed\"]\nFollowing World War II synthetic fertilizer use increased rapidly.\nThe discovery of antibiotics and vaccines improved the raising of livestock by reducing diseases. Developments in refrigeration as well as food processing technology made it possible to transport goods over long distances.\nThere are concerns over the sustainability of industrial agriculture, and the environmental effects of fertilizers and pesticides. This has led to people buying organic food. It has also led to the funding for the development of sustainable technology.\nCharacteristics.\nIntensive farming has many characteristics.

They did not wear boxing thongs however. Kicking and hitting were allowed but biting and gouging an eye or soft spot with a thumb or finger were forbidden. Umpires flogged athletes who violated these rules. In spite of this punishment, violations often occurred.\nA Greek wrestler aimed to throw his opponent; a pankratiast however aimed to force his opponent to concede defeat. This might be done by getting an opponent in a hold that, if he did not yield (give up), a bone would be broken or a joint dislocated. Size and weight did not matter as much in the pankration as they did in boxing and wrestling because pankratiasts spent most of their time rolling around on the ground. \nThe Greeks loved the pankration. They considered it the greatest test of an athlete's skill and strength. The pankration was also a favorite sport in Roman imperial times. The most famous ancient pankratiast was Arrichon of Philageia in the 6th century BC. He won the pankration in two Olympics, but died of a stranglehold in the Olympics of 564 BC. He was awarded the victor's wreath. Both Philostratus and Pausanias told the story of his final bout. A statue in the Olympia Museum may be his."}

They have a similar morphological or physiological complexity, and they are often adapted to the same way of life.\nThe term was coined by Julian Huxley, to contrast with clade, which is a strictly phylogenetic unit. The use of 'grade' as a term in biology was strongly supported by Ernst Mayr, who also pointed out that the term had been used for some time before cladism.\nBackground.\nAn evolutionary grade is a group of species united by similarities. These similarities led to their being given a name. But now to be a clade, the whole group from the first known member to the present day must be included.\nThe most commonly cited example is that of reptiles. In the early 19th century, tetrapods were put in the four familiar classes of amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals. In this system, reptiles are defined by traits such as laying cleidoic eggs, having skin covered in scales or scutes, and having a 'cold-blooded' metabolism.\nHowever, we now know that amphibia gave rise to early egg-laying amniotes. These gave rise to sauropsids (the ancestors of reptiles and birds) and synapsids (the ancestors of mammals. 'Reptile' is just a common term for those sauropsids which survived to the present day, minus the birds. As an everyday word, everyone understands it. But as a modern \"scientific\" term, it is no longer good, and is less used.\nParaphyletic and polyphyletic taxa often represent evolutionary grades. In some cases paraphyletic taxa are united simply by not being part of any other groups, and give rise to so-called wastebasket taxa."}

It came from the Latin phrase \"concordia res parvae crescunt\" (small states flourish by concord). The new Dutch Republic took over the phrase as its motto. It was on several of its coins and coats of arms. \nThe French were in the Netherlands from 1795 to 1813, first as the Batavian Republic then the Kingdom of Holland. Early on the national motto was changed to \"Gelykheid, Vryheid, Broederschap\" (Equality, Liberty, Fraternity). From 1802 to 1810 'Unity makes strength' was used again. In 1816, it switched to the House of Orange motto 'Je maintiendrai'.\nHaiti.\nThe motto was chosen by the Republic of Haiti after the revolution and subsequent independence of the slaves of the French colony of Saint-Domingue in 1803. The newly created state of Haiti became officially independent on January 1st,1804 following the capitulation of the French troops at the Battle of Vertieres of November 18,1803. The coat of arms of the republic of Haiti carries the french version of the motto \"L'Union fait la force\". The Republic of Haiti is often referred to as the world's First Black Republic.\nBelgium.\nThe motto was used by Belgium after its Revolution of 1830. It was first only in its French form \"L'union fait la force\".\nUSA.\nThe motto of Brooklyn, a borough of New York City started by Dutch settlers, is still \"Eendraght maeckt maght\". The motto \"Eendragt maakt magt\" also appears on the badge of the police force of Holland, Michigan.\nBulgaria.\nAfter Ferdinand of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha took over the throne of the Principality of Bulgaria, the country started to use Belgium's motto of \"L'union fait la force\" (in Bulgarian: \u0421\u044a\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438 \u0441\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0430). Although \"Unity makes strength\" meet in various projects on the coat of arms of Bulgaria in the post-liberation years, it officially became part of it only in 1927. After 1948, the motto dropped from the new Dimitrov Constitution, but remained on the facade of the National Assembly. Following the changes in 1989 and the adoption of a new Constitution of Bulgaria in 1991, the motto has been restored.\nSouth African Republic.\nOn 17 January 1852 the United Kingdom, ruler of the Cape Colony, made the South African Republic free. \"Eendragt maakt magt\" was the motto on the new state's shield. In 1888 the republic decided Dutch was its official language.\nMalaysia.\nAn early design of the coat of arms used between 1948 and 1963 used a variation of the motto, \"Unity is Strength\". It was in both English and Jawi. After three more states were added into the federation in 1963, the English motto of the arms was replaced by a rough Malay translation, \"Bersekutu Bertambah Mutu\" (literally \"Unity Improves Quality\"). The Jawi motto remained unchanged."}

It originated in the Baroque period, and remained throughout the years to be popular among many composers. Although it is not true for many solo concerti, it could be said that the genre typically has three movements, the first and the last being fast-paced and lively, broken up by a more lyrical, slower second movement.\nGiuseppe Torelli was one of the first composers to write solo concerti, written in 1698; however Vivaldi could be credited to making the three-movement form as typical of this genre. Later, Handel wrote many solo concerti for different types of soloist, as before then they had mainly been only for violin.\nThe Classical period then used solo concerti to great effect, and developed to make the solos more virtuosic. Many of Beethoven\u2019s and Mozart\u2019s more famous works were solo concerti.\nThe early Romantic period had many solo concerti, written by well-known composers such as Mendelssohn, and were not too different from those of the classical era. However, later in this period, the solos became even more virtuosic, meaning that only brilliant players could ever play them. Along with this, the structures and textures became denser, helped by the excessive size that was commonplace during the era.\nFinally, 20th century music carried on the rich works of the Romantic era. However, when neoclassic genres came about, many classical-style solo concerti were written once again."}

They were a group of tribes within the bigger country called Gaul, which covered all of modern France. According to Julius Caesar, the Belgae were different from the other Gauls. He said that the border between Belgica and the main Celtic part of Gaul was the Marne and the Seine rivers and that the border with Germania was the Rhine river. It is no longer certain what language or languages were spoken in Gallia Belgica, but historians know there was an influence of both Celtic and Germanic languages.\nThe area was conquered in 57 BC by Julius Caesar. Emperor Diocletian changed the Gaulish provinces around 300 AD. He split Belgica into two provinces: Belgica Prima and Belgica Secunda. Belgica Prima had Treveri (Trier) as its main city and was the eastern part. The border between Belgica Prima and Belgica Secunda was along the River Meuse.\nIn 406 AD, the Vandals, Burgundians and other tribes crossed the Rhine. They defeated the Gaulish forces.

They are native to Central and South America. There are only two genera: \"Cebus\" and \"Sepajus\". \"Cebus\" has the gracile capuchins, and \"Sepajus\" has the robust capuchins.\nCapuchin monkeys are active during the day and generally live and travel through trees.\nHabitat and lifespan.\nCapuchin monkeys live in Central America and South America. They make their home in trees, traveling during the day and sleeping in the trees at night.\nCapuchins live in groups of 10 to 40 members. These groups consist of related females and their offspring, as well as several males. Usually groups are dominated by a single male. The Capuchins in a group will groom each other and vocalize to communicate. The Capuchin group will be protective of its territory, marking a central area of their territory with urine and defending it against intruders.\nFemales bear young every two years following a 160 to 180 day gestation. The young cling to their mother's chest until they are larger, when they move to her back a Capuchin Monkey takes 18 - 24 months to grow into an adult. Adult male capuchins rarely take part in caring for the young. Within four years for females and eight years for males, juveniles become fully mature. In captivity, individual capuchins have reached an age of 45 years, although life expectancy in nature is only 15 to 25 years.\nIntelligence.\nCapuchins are the most intelligent New World monkeys. The tufted capuchin uses tools in a similar way to chimpanzees. It is one of the few examples of primate tool use other than by apes.\nWhen they see macaws eating palm nuts, cracking them open with their beaks, capuchins select a few of the ripest fruits. They nip off the tip of the fruit and drink down the juice, then seemingly discard the rest of the fruit with the nut inside. When these discarded fruits are hardened and brittle, the capuchins gather them up. Then they take them to a large flat boulder where they already have a few stones from a river. They use these stones to crack open the fruit to get to the nut inside. Young capuchins watch this process to learn from the more experienced adults. It may take a capuchin up to eight years to master this skill.\nDuring the mosquito season, they crush millipedes and rub the result on their backs. This acts as a natural insect repellent.\nOne experiment suggest they can distinguish between seeing and knowing, but this is not entirely accepted.\nRelationship with humans.\nCapuchin monkeys can be recognized as the \"organ grinder\" or \"greyhound jockey\" monkeys. Capuchins are sometimes kept as exotic pets. Sometimes they plunder fields and crops and are seen as troublesome by nearby human populations. In some regions they have become rare due to the destruction of their habitat.\nThey are also used as service animals, sometimes being called \"nature's butlers.\" Some organizations have been training capuchin monkeys to assist quadriplegics as monkey helpers in a manner similar to mobility assistance dogs. After being socialized in a human home as infants, the monkeys undergo extensive training before being placed with a quadriplegic. Around the house, the monkeys help out by doing tasks including microwaving food, washing the quadriplegic's face, and opening drink bottles.\nCapuchin monkeys are the most common featured monkeys in the movies \"Outbreak\", \"\" (and its sequels), \"Zookeeper\", \"George of the Jungle\", and \"The Hangover Part II\". Ross Geller (David Schwimmer) on the NBC sitcom \"Friends\" had a capuchin monkey named Marcel. Crystal the Monkey is the famous monkey actress.\nFood.\nThe diet of the capuchins is more varied than other 'New World' monkeys such as spider monkeys. They are omnivores, eating not only fruits, nuts, seeds, and buds, but also insects, spiders, birds' eggs, and small vertebrates. Capuchins living near water will also eat crabs and shellfish by cracking their shells with stones.\nPhysical description.\nCapuchins are darkly black or brown except for the face, throat and chest, that are white coloured. They reach a length of 30 to 56\u00a0cm (12\u201322\u00a0in), with tails that are just as long as the body.\nBehaviour.\nCapuchin monkeys have long naps during the day. Also they socialize in small groups up to 10 to 40 members."}

Regular taxa are supposed to be monophyletic. By definition, wastebasket taxa are either paraphyletic or polyphyletic. Their name may still be very useful to biologists, because its members may be an important evolutionary grade. Antelopes are a group which is ecologically very important, and have many similar features. However, they are not monophyletic. Species are called 'antelopes' if they look like one.\nInvertebrates are often called the \"everything-else\" category, meaning all animals without backbones. Little-known fossil groups are sometimes later found to be wastebasket taxa. The crocodile-like Triassic group Rauisuchia is an example. \nLoosely related animals often look rather alike. This is because they adapt to similar environments. This leads to convergent evolution."}

It is near the larger city of Winston-Salem. 18,978 people live in the city.\nHistory.\nPeople from Europe first moved to the area in 1775. The town is named after the city of Lexington, Massachusetts, where the first battle of the American Revolutionary War happened. Lexington became a city in 1828. Until the late 1990s, Lexington's economy was based on textile and furniture manufacturing. Since then, most local manufacturers have moved their production facilities to Asia and Mexico to reduce costs. This caused most textile and furniture factories to close, creating economic difficulties in the area.\nThe oldest remaining house in Lexington is \"The Homestead\", built by Dr. William Rainey Holt (1798\u20131868), a physician born in Alamance County. Dr. Holt was the President of the North Carolina Agricultural Society and was one of the first to introduce purebred livestock to North Carolina.\nLocal Culture.\nBarbecue.\nLexington calls itself the \"Barbecue Capital of the World\". Starting in 1984, the city has the Lexington Barbecue Festival each year, one of the largest street festivals in North Carolina. In 2012, the US News and World Report ranked Lexington as #4 on its list of the best cities for barbecue. Lexington-style barbecue is made with pork shoulder cooked slowly over a hardwood fire, usually hickory wood. It is served with a sauce made with vinegar, ketchup, water, salt, pepper and other spices. There are many different way to make this sauce, mild, tangy, sweet or spicy.\nPigs in the City.\n\"Pigs in the City\" is a public art display managed by Uptown Lexington, Inc., a non-profit organization that has the goal of increasing the usage of the downtown area of Lexington. \"Pigs in the City\" began in 2003 and 40,000 visitors from all over the state came to see the event in the first year. Since 2006, the event has been held every year. There are usually 20 or more of these statues on display during the event. Companies pay $1,000 each to sponsor one of the pigs, which pays for the event.\nHigh Rock Lake.\nHigh Rock Lake is the second largest lake in North Carolina and located near Lexington. Its water surface covers and there are of shoreline. It begins where the Yadkin River and the South Yadkin River come together. High Rock Lake has long been considered one of the best fishing lakes of North Carolina. There have been a number of national fishing tournaments held at the lake, such as Bassmaster Tournaments, like the Bassmaster Classic in 1994, 1995, 1997 and 2007. The lake has large numbers of fish, including channel, blue, and flathead catfish, plus crappie and several different sunfish such as bluegill, shellcracker and others. Striper and their hybrids as well as white bass are also abundant. The lake is best known for its quantity and quality of largemouth bass.\nThe Bob Timberlake Gallery.\nThe Bob Timberlake Gallery is in Lexington. It opened in 1997, and features original artwork, reproductions, personal memorabilia, as well as home furnishings from the artist Bob Timberlake.\nGeography.\nLexington is in the Piedmont.

Being in central North Carolina, between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mid-Atlantic coast, Lexington has a humid subtropical climate, with moderate temperatures during spring and autumn and warm to hot summers. Winters are relatively mild and wet with highs typically in the 40s to 50s and overnight lows averaging just below freezing.\nDemographics.\nAs of the census of 2010, there are 18,931 people in the city, organized into 7,376 households.

Fully 10.7% of the population identifies itself as \"Some other race\" while 2.6% are \"Two or more races\". Other races each represent less than 1% each of the total population.\nOf the total 7,376 households, 4,581 are considered \"Family households\", including 2067 that have children under 18. The average household size is 2.44 persons, and the average family size is 3.08 persons. There are 8,938 total housing units, of which the 7376 are households, for an occupancy rate of 82.5%. 47.6% of these households are owner-occupied, while 52.4% are renters.\nAccording to the 2000 census, The median income for a household in the city is $26,226, and the median income for a family is $32,339. Males have a median income of $25,555 versus $20,939 for females. The per capita income for the city is $15,310. 21.2% of the population and 16.7% of families are below the poverty line. Out of the total population, 31.7% of those under the age of 18 and 18.0% of those 65 and older are living below the poverty line. The global outsourcing of textile and furniture manufacturing has damaged Lexington's economy."}

Vesalius is the Latinized form of Andries van Wesel. He is sometimes also called Andreas Vesal, Andr\u00e9 Vesalio and Andre Vesale.\nAnatomies had been published before, but those of Vesalius were in a different class. They were based on actual dissections of human bodies (after death). And the drawings were artwork of the highest class. \nDissections of cadavers (dead human bodies) was forbidden for many centuries, and this limited previous work on anatomy. Before Vesalius, most information about the human body came from Galen. By dissecting human bodies, Vesalius showed that many of the things Galen wrote about were wrong. Galen was primarily misinformed about the human heart, liver and lower jaw bone. It was found that Galen's work was based on Barbary apes, but he also dissected pigs, which led to even more inaccurate observations.\nVesalius was invited to be the Imperial physician of Emperor Charles V. After the abdication of Emperor Charles V he continued at court in great favour with the Emperor's son Philip II."}

{"id": "350758", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=350758", "title": "Atomic physics", "text": "Atomic physics is the field of physics that studies atoms as an isolated system of electrons and an atomic nucleus. It is primarily concerned with the arrangement of electrons around the nucleus and\nthe processes by which these arrangements change. This includes ions as well as neutral atoms and, unless otherwise stated, for the purposes of this discussion it should be assumed that the term \"atom\" includes ions.\nThe term \"atomic physics\" is often associated with nuclear power and nuclear bombs, due to the synonymous use of \"atomic\" and \"nuclear\" in standard English. However, physicists distinguish between atomic physics \u2014 which deals with the atom as a system consisting of a nucleus and electrons \u2014 and nuclear physics, which considers atomic nuclei alone.\nAs with many scientific fields, strict delineation can be highly contrived and atomic physics is often considered in the wider context of \"atomic, molecular, and optical physics\". Physics research groups are usually so classified.\nIsolated atoms.\nAtomic physics always considers atoms in isolation. Atomic models will consist of a single nucleus that may be surrounded by one or more bound electrons. It is not concerned with the formation of molecules (although much of the physics is identical), nor does it examine atoms in a solid state as condensed matter. It is concerned with processes such as ionization and excitation by photons or collisions with atomic particles.\nWhile modelling atoms in isolation may not seem realistic, if one considers atoms in a gas or plasma then the time-scales for atom-atom interactions are huge in comparison to the atomic processes that are generally considered. This means that the individual atoms can be treated as if each were in isolation, as the vast majority of the time they are. By this consideration atomic physics provides the underlying theory in plasma physics and atmospheric physics, even though both deal with very large numbers of atoms.\nElectronic configuration.\nElectrons form notional shells around the nucleus. These are naturally in a ground state but can be excited\nby the absorption of energy from light (photons), magnetic fields, or interaction with a colliding particle (typically other electrons).\nElectrons that populate a shell are said to be in a bound state. The energy necessary to remove an electron from its shell (taking it to infinity) is called the binding energy. Any quantity of energy absorbed by the electron in excess of this amount is converted to kinetic energy according to the conservation of energy. The atom is said to have undergone the process of ionization.\nIn the event the electron absorbs a quantity of energy less than the binding energy, it will transition to an excited state. After a statistically sufficient quantity of time, an electron in an excited state will undergo a transition to a lower state. The change in energy between the two energy levels must be accounted for (conservation of energy). In a neutral atom, the system will emit a photon of the difference in energy. However, if the excited atom has been previously ionized, in particular if one of its inner shell electrons has been removed, a phenomenon known as the Auger effect may take place where the quantity of energy is transferred to one of the bound electrons causing it to go into the continuum. This allows one to multiply ionize an atom with a single photon.\nThere are rather strict selection rules as to the electronic configurations that can be reached by excitation by light\u2014however there are no such rules for excitation by collision processes.\nHistory and developments.\nThe majority of fields in physics can be divided between theoretical work and experimental work,\nand atomic physics is no exception. It is usually the case, but not always, that progress goes\nin alternate cycles from an experimental observation, through to a theoretical explanation\nfollowed by some predictions that may or may not be confirmed by experiment, and so on. Of course, the current state of technology at any given time can put limitations on what can be achieved experimentally and theoretically so it may take considerable time for theory to be refined.\nOne of the earliest steps towards atomic physics was the recognition that matter was composed\nof \"atoms\", in the modern sense of the basic unit of a chemical element. This theory was developed by the British chemist and physicist John Dalton in the 18th century. At this stage, it wasn't clear what atoms were although they could be described and classified by their properties (in bulk) in a periodic table.\nThe true beginning of atomic physics is marked by the discovery of spectral lines and attempts to describe the phenomenon, most notably by Joseph von Fraunhofer. The study of these lines led to the Bohr atom model and to the birth of quantum mechanics. In seeking to explain atomic spectra an entirely new mathematical model of matter was revealed. As far as atoms and their electron shells were concerned, not only did this yield a better overall description, i.e. the atomic orbital model, but it also provided a new theoretical basis for chemistry\n(quantum chemistry) and spectroscopy.\nSince the Second World War, both theoretical and experimental fields have advanced at a rapid pace. This can be attributed to progress in computing technology, which has allowed larger and more sophisticated models of atomic structure and associated collision processes. Similar technological advances in accelerators, detectors, magnetic field generation and lasers have greatly assisted experimental work."}

It is sometimes called the Teatro San Carlo or simply the San Carlo. Its name means Theatre of Saint Charles. It was built in 1737. When it was first built it was the biggest opera house in the world. Today, it is still one of the biggest opera houses in Italy. It is also the oldest opera house in Italy. Many operas were first performed at the Teatro di San Carlo. Seventeen of Donizetti's operas and eight of Rossini's operas were first performed there.\nHistory of Teatro di San Carlo.\nThe new King of Naples, Charles VII, was very interested in the arts. He wanted the city to have a new and beautiful opera house. The old one, the Teatro San Bartolomeo, was falling apart. King Charles paid for building the new theatre. It was built on land next to his palace and designed by Giovanni Antonio Medrano (1703 \u2013 1760). The new theatre took only seven months to build. It opened on 4 March 1737. The first opera performed there was \" (Achilles in Skyros). The famous Italian poet, Metastasio, wrote the words and story. Domenico Sarro wrote the music. He also conducted the orchestra.\nThe building burnt down on 12 February 1816. Six days after the fire, King Ferdinand IV (the son of King Charles) asked the architect Antonio Niccolini to build the theatre again. Nicolini used Medrano's designs but he made the stage bigger. The inside of the new Teatro di San Carlo was even more beautiful than the first one. The new theatre opened on 12 January 1817, with an opera by Simon Mayr, \" (Partenope's Dream). Since then, only small changes were made to the building. It was damaged by bombs during World War II, but American and British soldiers soon repaired it.\nToday.\nLike most Italian opera houses, the Teatro di San Carlo is built in a horseshoe shape. It has downstairs seats called stalls. There are six more levels of seats called box seats where groups of people can sit together. The box seats go all the way to the top of the opera house. Overall, there are 1386 seats in the Teatro di San Carlo today. The inside of the theatre has beautiful decorations in red and gold. A large painting by Giuseppe Cammarano covers the ceiling. The painting shows the Greek god Apollo and the goddess Minerva. All around them are famous poets.\nBecause of its shape, the San Carlo has very good sound quality. People can hear the singers and orchestra even in the most far away seats. Operas, ballets and concerts are performed there. People can also rent the theatre for parties or to put on their own shows. In 2010, much work was done on the opera house. It now has more rooms for rehearsals, modern machinery for the stage, and air conditioning. The Teatro di San Carlo has its own orchestra."}

Inhabitants of the Dominican Republic of African descent, see Afro-Dominicans (Dominican Republic).\nAfro-Dominicans or Dominicans of African ancestry, are Dominicans whose ancestry ties within the continent of Africa. Most of them came from West Africa and the Congo. The first Africans in the Dominican came in 1502 from Spain, 8 years later African-born slaves came in large numbers. They were forced to work the Mines, Sugar Plantations, Cattling, Cowboys, Maids, Farming and Others.\nToday, Afro-Dominicans (40% Black) of the Country's population, while the remaining and majority of Dominicans are multiracial (45%). They can be found anywhere in the Island as they are the majority, but the purest blacks are mostly in the coastal lowlands of the country. In the Central Cibao region, you can find people of either European, Mixed and African descent.\nOrigins.\nAtlantic slave trade.\nThe Atlantic slave trade began in the very early 1500s. Santo Domingo (present-day Dominican Republic) was the first place to transport African slaves in the Americas. The dying of Indigenous people in the island, caused the Spanish to quickly grant permission from Spain to use slaves to work the plantations. In 1510, the first sizable ship consisted of 250 Black Latinos (Spanish-speaking men ), 8 years later, African born slaves arrived in massive numbers. The slave and black population was so big that they would out-number whites from 9 out of 10. The first major slave revolt took place in Dominican Republic's hills in 1522. These Maroons were originally from the senegambian region of Africa; of which most were Muslims of the Wolof nation. Many centuries later the Maroon populations became so large that the only way whites could travel would be in large armed groups. Most of the Maroon populations established themselves in mostly in rivers, hills/mountains, coastal and in caves. The Congolese people were known to be very aggressive and naturally strong, they and many of the Mandingas, Wolofs, and Fulanis was the main ethnicity to have been born in Maroon villages.\nHaitian Immigration.\nFrom the neighboring country, Haitians have also had an influence in the growing population in Dominican Republic. It's estimated that is around 800,000 Haitians living in the Dominican Republic. Haitians make a large minority in the country anywhere from 4-6%. Among the Afro-Haitian population, they originated among the Ewe and Fon tribes of present-day Benin and Togo West Africa.\nEthnicities.\nSince the then Spanish Haiti (now Dominican Republic) was occupied by Haiti, slavery was abolished from the island to this day. Enslaved Africans that lived in the then Santo Domingo colony tended to come from the Bantu/Congolese (majority-wise especially the Bakongo), Akan, Yoruba, Igbo, Ewe, Fon, Mandinga, Wolof-Fulanis and Others. The Congolese-Bakongo tribes has had the most dominant culteral impact in the Dominican today.\nCulture.\nAs Dominican slaves came from predominately West-Central Africa, many of their customs survived based-on memory and myths, along with religion, names, words, music, language etc. Known survived religions are the Regla de palo, Arara, Dominican Vudu, Santer\u00eda etc. Many villages among the Dominican Republic have kept their African languages among their descendants. Recongnized African languages spoken by Dominicans are the Lucumi language which is practically the Yoruba language with very few Spanish words, the Kikongo language is still spoken, especially in places like Villa Mella, Dajabon, Altagracia, and Monte Plata. Merengue is the typical music of the Dominican Republic. Typical Dominican foods such as Mangu (mashed plantains) is of African origin."}

{"id": "351050", "revid": "656019", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=351050", "title": "The Labors of Herakles", "text": "The Labors of Herakles is a series of tasks performed by the Greek hero Herakles () as a penance for a terrible crime he committed. These tasks required great strength and courage. For the most part, they involved killing fierce animals and horrible monsters. The Labors were said to have been devised by Hera, the goddess of marriage. She hated Herakles because he was a bastard son of her husband Zeus. She hoped these tasks would kill him. Herakles however performed them with great success, and, in the process, became very famous. The Labors of Herakles probably had their origin in the religious and magical practices of prehistoric man. They are the subject of ancient and modern art.\nBackground.\nMortals die, but gods live forever. Herakles was part mortal, part god. His father was the god Zeus and his mother was the mortal Alkmene. Zeus' wife Hera was the goddess of marriage. She hated Herakles because he was one of her husband's bastards. She tried many times to kill him, even when he was a baby. He lived in spite of Hera's persecution and hatred, and did many great deeds as a young man. \nHerakles married Megara, the daughter of a king. They became the parents of several children. Hera caused Herakles to go mad and to kill his family. The priestess of Delphi ordered Herakles to serve his cousin King Eurystheus of Tiryns as a penance for this crime. Eurystheus would present a series of tasks to Herakles. These tasks were said to have been designed by Hera herself in the hope that they would kill Herakles.\nLabors of Herakles.\nThere is no definite order for the Labors. Most of the time, however, the order is: Nemean Lion, Lernean Hydra, Cerynitian Hind, Erymanthian Boar, Augean Stables, Stymphalian Birds, Cretan Bull, Mares of Diomedes, Girdle of Hippolyta, Cattle of Geryon, Apples of the Hesperides, and Kerberos. The order here is that of the sculptures called metopes on the Temple of Zeus at Olympia. These sculptures (made about 460\u2013450 BC) were placed high on the outside of the temple in a frieze. Their order was described by the ancient Greek geographer, Pausanias. Some of these metopes are used in this article to illustrate the Labors. The first group of six metopes are from the west end of the temple. The second group of six are from the east end. Some of the illustrations here are taken from Greek vase paintings. The Labors of Herakles became the subject of much ancient and modern art, and even movies like \"Hercules\" (1958) starring Steve Reeves and the Walt Disney animated movie \"Hercules\" (1997). \nLion of Nemea.\nA large and dangerous lion was terrorizing the people and animals near the city of Nemea. Weapons of iron, bronze, or stone could not pierce the lion's thick hide (skin). Eurystheus ordered Herakles to kill and skin this lion. \nHerakles went to the region of Nemea and stayed with a poor man named Molorchos at Kleonai. Molorchos' son had been killed by this lion. Molorchos wanted to sacrifice his only ram to Herakles, but Herakles asked him to wait thirty days. If he did not return within thirty days, the ram was to be sacrificed to him as a hero. If he returned within thirty days, the ram was to be sacrificed to Zeus the Deliverer.\nHerakles found the lion outside its lair on Mount Tretos. His arrows and sword were useless against the beast. He hit the lion with his club and the animal went into his lair. Herakles blocked one of the two openings to the cavern with nets, then entered the cavern. He wrestled the lion and choked it to death. The lion bit off one of his fingers. He returned to Molorchos' hovel with the lion's carcass on his back. The two men sacrificed to Zeus.\nWhen Herakles presented the dead animal to Eurystheus, the king was disgusted. He ordered Herakles to leave such things outside the gates of Tiryns in the future. Eurystheus then put a large bronze jar underground. This was the place where he would hide whenever Herakles returned to the city with some trophy of his Labors. Zeus put the lion among the stars as the constellation Leo. \nIn the future, Eurystheus would only communicate with Herakles through Kopreus, his dungman. Herakles skinned the lion with one of its own claws. He wore the skin as a kind of armor and the lion's skull as a helmet. Euripides wrote in his play \"Herakles\":\"First he cleared the grove of Zeus of a lion, and put its skin upon his back, hiding his yellow hair in its fearful tawny gaping jaws.\"\nThe origin of the Nemean Lion is not certain. Some say he was the son of either Typhon or the Chimera and the dog Orthros. Some say the moon goddess Selene gave birth to the lion and let it fall to Earth near a two-mouthed cave at Nemea. She set it against the people because they had failed to properly observe her worship. Some say that Hera had Selene create the lion from sea foam and that Iris, the goddess of the rainbow, carried it to Nemea. Others say the lion was the son of the snake goddess Echidna and her son, the dog Orthos. This would make the lion a brother to the Sphinx of Thebes. Hera was said to have brought the lion from the eastern land of the Arimoi and to have released it near Nemea.\nHydra of Lerna.\nThe Hydra (\"water-snake\") was a monster with many heads. She lived beneath a plane tree near the spring called Amymone. This spring was near the seaside city of Lerna. She was the offspring of Typhon and Echidna, and the sister of Kerebos. Hera raised the Hydra to torment Herakles. The Hydra had a dog-like body. Its breath was poisonous. The head in the middle of the monster was immortalit could not die. Eurystheus ordered Herakles to kill this monster. Herakles and his nephew Iolaos (the son of his brother Iphicles) drove to the swamp near Lerna in Herakles' war chariot. Iolaos was Heracles' charioteer and his lover. \nAthena told Herakles to force the monster from the swamp with fire arrows. He did, but the monster twisted itself about his feet. He beat the heads with his club, but crushing one head only caused others to erupt. A great crab crawled from the swamp to help the Hydra. It bit Herakles in the foot. He crushed its shell. Herakles called Iolaos for his help and cut the Hydra's heads off with his sword. Iolaos sealed the neck stumps with torches so other heads could not grow in their place. \nThe Hydra was at last killed. Herakles cut off the immortal head and buried it under a heavy stone in the road. He dipped his arrowheads in the Hydra's poisonous blood. They became deadly. Back in Tiryns, Eurystheus would not count this adventure as a Labor because Herakles had had his nephew's help. He added another Labor to the list. Hera set the crab in the sky as a constellation. The river Anigrus in Elis stank because the Hydra's poison was washed from the arrows Heracles used to kill the centaur Nessus in its waters.\nStymphalian Birds.\nThe Stymphalian Birds were man-eating birds living on the shores of Lake Stymphalos in north-eastern Arcadia. The birds were sacred to Ares, the god of war. Their feces poisoned the land and crops would not grow. The birds attacked men with their bronze beaks and claws. They could rain down their sharp bronze feathers to kill men and their animals.\nHerakles failed to drive them off with his arrows. Athena gave him a set of metal castanets (or a rattle) made by the blacksmith of the gods, Hephaestus. Herakles climbed to a rocky place over the lake and made so much noise with the castanets that the birds flew as far as the Isle of Ares in the Black Sea. Herakles was able to kill many of them with his arrows as they flew away. \nSome say the birds were women. Artemis Stymphalia ruled the swamps about the lake. Her temple there had pictures of young girls with the feet of birds. These girls lured men to their deaths in the swamps. They were said to be the daughters of Stymphalos and Ornis. These two were killed by Herakles when they would not give him food, drink, and a place to rest.\nCretan Bull.\nThe Cretan Bull rose from the sea. Poseidon, god of the sea, intended King Minos to sacrifice the bull, but it was so handsome that Minos kept it for himself. He sent it to mate with his cows, then sacrificed another bull to Poseidon. The god was angry and caused Minos' wife, Queen Pasipha\u00eb, to develop a sexual desire for the animal. \nShe mated with it and gave birth to a son. This son was the Minotaur, a monster with the head of a bull and the body of a man. The Cretan Bull went mad. Heracules captured it by throwing a rope about its head and about a leg. Some say he wrestled it, or stunned it with his club. \nMinos let Heracules take the bull to Greece. Eurystheus wanted to give the bull to Hera but she would not take it because Heracules had captured it. She let it go and it wandered about Greece. Theseus of Athens finally captured it and sacrificed it to Athena, or some say, Apollo. The bull had spent its days in Crete destroying crops and belching fire.\nHind of Artemis.\nWhen Artemis, the goddess of the hunt, was a child, she saw five hinds (female deer) grazing near the Anaurus River in Thessaly. Each was as large as a bull, each had hooves of bronze, and all had antlers of gold. She caught four of them, and used them to pull her chariot. The fifth escaped the goddess and lived on the Keryneian Hill in Arkadia. Hera planned to use this hind against Herakles someday.\nEurystheus ordered Herakles to catch this hind and bring it alive to Tiryns. The danger in this Labor lay in pursuing the hind through wild lands from which no hunter ever returned. Herakles hunted the hind for a year, chasing it through Istria and the Land of the Hyperboreans. The hind took refuge on Mount Artemision. Herakles let fly an arrow that pinned the hind's forelegs (front legs) together without drawing blood. He put the hind on his shoulders and took her back to Tiryns. \nArtemis and Apollo stopped Herakles on his way to Tiryns. On some vases, Apollo is seen trying to forcibly take the hind from Herakles. Herakles however lay the blame for the theft on Eurystheus. Artemis accepted this plea and allowed him to pass. Some say Herakles used a net to capture the hind or captured her when she was asleep under a tree.\nGirdle of Hippolyte.\nEurystheus' daughter Admete was a priestess of Hera. She wanted the Golden Girdle (belt) of Hippolyte, the Queen of the Amazons. This girdle had been a gift to Hippolyte from her father, Ares, the god of war. The Amazons were all related to Ares. They hated men and mated only to make more female warriors. Baby boys were killed or crippled. The lives of these women were devoted to war. \nHerakles and friends sailed to their land of Pontos on the Black Sea. The Amazons lived at the mouth of the Thermodon River. Hippolyte welcomed Herakles. She fell in love with his muscles and his great fame. She promised him the girdle as a love token. Hera disguised herself as an Amazon. She whispered among others that Herakles was going to kidnap the Queen. The Amazons charged Herakles' ship on horseback. Herakles killed Hippolyte, and took the girdle. Many Amazons were killed. \nSome say Hippolyte would not part with the girdle. Herakles threw her from her horse and threatened her with his club. She would not ask for mercy. Herakles killed her. Some say Hippolyte's sister Melanippe was taken prisoner. She was ransomed with the girdle. Some say Hippolyte herself was taken prisoner and ransomed with the girdle. Others say Theseus took Hippolyte prisoner and gave the girdle to Herakles. Herakles gave the girdle to Eurystheus, who gave it to Admete.\nErymanthian Boar.\nA large and dangerous boar was living on Mount Erymanthos. Eurystheus ordered Herakles to catch this boar. On Mount Erymanthos, Herakles forced the boar from the wood with his shouts. He then drove the boar into deep snow and jumped on its back. He put the boar in chains, placed it on his shoulders, and took it to Eurystheus. The king was so scared he hid in his bronze jar. Herakles left the boar in the market square of Tiryns. He then joined the Argonauts on the Quest for the Golden Fleece.\nMount Erymanthos took its name from a son of Apollo. Aphrodite blinded him because he saw her taking a bath. Apollo was angry. He turned himself into a boar and killed her boyfriend Adonis.\nHorses of Diomedes.\nEurystheus ordered Herakles to bring him the Horses of King Diomedes of Thrace. King Diomedes' horses were savage man-eaters, and were fed on the flesh of Diomedes' innocent guests. Herakles and his friends sailed to the coast of Thrace. Having found the stables of Diomedes, they killed the king's servants. They then put Diomedes before the horses. The animals tore him to pieces and ate him. The horses grew calm after feeding, and were led to the ship. Herakles sent them to Eurystheus.\nDiomedes was the son of Ares, the god of war, and the king of the Bistones, a Thracian tribe of warlike people. While travelling in connection with this Labor, Herakles visited King Admetos. His wife Alcestis had just died. Herakles wrestled Death for Alcestis and he won. Alcestis was returned to life. This event is the basis for Euripides' play \"Alcestis\". Eurystheus dedicated the savage horses to Hera. They were said to have bred into the age of Alexander the Great. \nAnother story says Herakles captured the horses and drove them to his ship. Diomedes and his men chased the thieves. Herakles and his friends left the ship to fight the king and his men. The horses of Diomedes were left in the care of Abderos, Herakles' male lover. The horses ate him. Herakles built the city of Abdera in his memory. It was after this Labor that Herakles joined the Quest for the Golden Fleece. He dropped out of the search when his lover Hylas was lost on a strange island. Some say Herakles went on to Kolchis and rejoined the Quest. Others say he returned to Tiryns and the Labors.\nCattle of Geryon.\nGeryon was a very strong giant with three bodies, six hands, and three heads. He was the King of Tartessus in Spain. He had wings, and the picture on his shield was an eagle. He lived on an island called Erytheia. This island was far to the west in Okeanos, the river that circles the Earth. At night, the Sun sailed upon this river in a Golden Cup. \nGeryon had large herds of cattle. They were watched over by Eurytion, Geryon's servant, and a huge two-headed dog named Orthrus, the offspring of Typhon and Echidna. King Eurystheus ordered Herakles to capture Geryon's cattle.\nHerakles crossed the Libyan desert. At the narrow channel that separates Europe and Africa, he built the Pillars of Herakles. The Sun was hot and Herakles threatened to shoot him with his bow and arrows. The Sun asked him not to do this. Herakles agreed. He borrowed the Sun's Golden Cup and sailed away in it. The Titan Oceanus tested Herakles' seamanship by causing violent waves. Herakles threatened to shoot Oceanus, too. Oceanus calmed the waves. Some say Herakles sailed in an urn and used his lion skin as a sail. \nOn Geryon's island, Herakles killed the two-headed dog Orthos and the servant Eurytion, who tried to help the dog. Herakles was driving the cattle to the Golden Cup when Geryon appeared, ready to fight. Herakles shot him down and sailed away with the cattle. Herakles had many adventures on his return to Greece. On the Greek coast, Hera sent gadflies to drive the herd of cattle far and wide. Herkales managed to round-up a few and these he presented to Eurystheus. He sacrificed them to Hera.\nApples of the Hesperides.\nHera received golden apples as a gift when she married. She planted them in her garden far to the west near Mount Atlas. It was on this mountain that the Titan Atlas held the sky on his shoulders. He was being punished for having joined the other Titans in making war on Zeus. When Hera heard his daughters were stealing from the garden, she sent a one hundred-headed dragon called Ladon to the garden to protect the apples. Three nymphs called the Hesperides also guarded the apples. \nEurystheus wanted Herakles to bring him three golden apples. Herakles set off. The river god Nereus refused to give him directions and changed his shape again and again. Herakles tied him to a tree until he told the way. In the Caucasus, Herakles freed the Titan Prometheus, the fire-bringer, from his chains. Prometheus warned Herakles not to pick the apples himself, but to ask someone else to do it.\nHerakles asked Atlas to pick the apples. The Titan agreed, but only if Herakles would kill the dragon and then take the sky on his shoulders. Herakles killed the dragon and took the sky on his shoulders. Atlas picked the apples but refused to take the sky again. He liked being free. Herakles tricked him. He asked Atlas to take the sky\u00a0\u2014 only for a moment\u00a0\u2014 while he put a cushion on his shoulders. Atlas took the sky. Herakles took the apples and headed for Tiryns. Eurystheus did not know what to do with the apples. He gave them to Herakles. Athena returned the apples to the garden, because they did, after all, belong to the gods.\nKerberos.\nEurystheus ordered Herakles to bring him Kerberos, a three-headed dog-like monster with a dragon's tail and a mane of poisonous snakes. It guarded the entrance to the Underworld. The three heads could see the past, present, and future. Some say they represented birth, youth, and old age. Kerberos allowed the dead to enter the Underworld, but anyone who tried to leave was eaten. Kerberos was the offspring of Echidna, a monster part woman/part snake, and Typhon, a fire-breathing giant. Kerberos' brother was the two-headed dog Orthrus. \nHerakles' first step was to undergo the Mysteries of Eleusis. These rites would protect him in the land of the dead. They would also cleanse him of the massacre of the Centaurs. Athena and Hermes guided Herakles into the Underworld. He was ferried across the River Styx in Charon's boat. On the opposite shore, he met the Gorgon, Medusa. She was a harmless phantom and he passed her without trouble. He met Meleagros and offered to marry his sister, Deianeira. Eventually, he did. When Herakles asked Hades for Kerberos, Hades allowed him to take the monster, but only if he could do so without using his weapons. Herakles wrestled the monster and choked it. Once the monster had yielded, he led it away. \nAs they neared the Earth's surface, Kerberos tossed his three heads because he hated the sunlight. His spit flew in all directions. From that spit grew the poisonous plant, aconite. When Heracles arrived in Tiryns, Eurystheus was performing a sacrifice. The king gave the best cuts of meat to his relatives and only a slave's portion of meat to Herakles. Herakles was furious with this insult and killed Eurystheus' three sons. Eurystheus was terrified when presented with Kerberos and hid in his bronze jar. Herakles took Kerberos back to the Underworld. Another account says the monster escaped. This Labor is the twelfth and last Labor in some accounts.\nAugeian Stables.\nKing Augeias of Elis lived on the west coast of the Peloponnese. He was a son of Helios, the sun god. It was said that the rays of the sun shone in his eyes. Augeias had many cattle. His animals were always healthy, and gave birth to many young. His stables had not been cleaned in years and were thick with animal waste. The valleys were also full of waste. The smell of this waste poisoned the land. Eurystheus ordered Herakles to clean the stables in a day. He liked the thought of Herakles doing such dirty work. \nHerakles went to Elis. He did not tell Augeias that Eurystheus had ordered him to clean the stables.Instead, he made a bargain with Augeias. He promised to clean the stables if Augeias would give him some of his cattle. The bargain was made. Augeias' son Phyleos acted as witness. Herakles set to work. First, he made two holes in the stone foundation of the stables. Then he changed the paths of the Alpheios and Peneios Rivers. The rivers were made to flow through one hole and out the other. This is how the stables were washed clean. \nAugeias learned from Eurystheus' servant Copreus that Eurystheus had ordered Herakles to clean the stables. He would not respect the bargain he had made with Herakles. Herakles took the case to court. Phyleos was called to court and told the truth about the bargain. Augeias was so angry he drove his son and Herakles out of the land. Back in Tiryns, Eurystheus said that the Labor did not count because Herakles had made a bargain with Augeias. Eurystheus also thought that the river gods had really done the work. \nThis Labor was the last one presented in the frieze on the Temple of Zeus at Olympia. It was important to the Greeks because one day Herakles made war on Augeias and defeated him. Herakles then laid out the Olympian sanctuary in the land of King Augeias and started the Olympic Games. It was said that Menedemus of Elis gave Herakles advice on this Labor and that the hero had the help of his nephew Iolaos. While Augeias and Herakles were making their bargain, Phaeton, one of Augeias' twelve white bulls, charged Herakles. These white bulls guarded all the cattle against wild animals. Phaeton thought the hero was a lion. Herakles forced the bull to the Earth by twisting its horn. Herakles was going to get Augeias' daughter as part of the bargain, but he did not. This was given as one reason for making war later on Augeias. He was also going to become Augeias' slave if the work was not done in one day."}

The coastal area has many mudflats. They are the right environment for mangroves.\nFlora.\nThe mangrove vegetation of Sundarbans has 64 plant species. They can withstand estuarine conditions and large amounts of saline. In the months of April and May the flaming red leaves of the genwa (\"Excoecaria agallocha\") the crab-like red flowers of the kankra (\"Bruguiera gymnorrhiza\") and the yellow flowers of khalsi (\"Aegiceras corniculatum\") can be seen. Some of the other commonly found plants and trees in the park are dhundal (or cannonball mangrove, \"Xylocarpus granatum\"), passur (\"Xylocarpus mekongensis\"), garjan (\"Rhizophora\" spp.), sundari (\"Heritiera fomes\") and goran (\"Ceriops decandra\").\nFauna.\nThe Sundarbans forest is home to more than 400 tigers. The Royal Bengal Tigers have developed a unique characteristic of swimming in the saline waters. They are famous for their man-eating tendencies. Tigers can be seen on the river banks sunbathing between November and February.\nApart from the Bengal tiger there are also many fishing cats, leopard cats, macaques, wild boar, Indian grey mongoose, fox, jungle cat, flying fox, pangolin, chital.\nBirds.\nSome of the birds commonly found in this region are red junglefowls, spot-billed pelicans, great egrets, cormorants, seagulls, common kingfishers, peregrine falcons, woodpeckers, northern pintails, and whistling teals.\nWater life.\nSome of the fish and amphibians found in the park are Sawfish, Butter Fish, Electric rays, Silver carp, Star Fish, Common Carp, King Crabs, Prawn, Shrimps, Gangetic Dolphins, Skipping Frogs, Common Toads and Tree Frogs.\nReptiles.\nThe Sundarbans National Park houses a large number of reptiles as well, including estuarine crocodiles, chameleons, monitor lizards, turtles, including Olive Ridley, hawksbill, and green turtles.

He was well known for a number of witty and thought-provoking images.\nEarly life and career.\nMagritte was born in Lessines, in the province of Hainaut. Little is known about Magritte's early life. He began lessons in drawing in 1910. On 12 March 1912, his mother committed suicide by drowning herself in the River Sambre. \nMagritte's earliest paintings, which date from about 1915, were Impressionistic in style. From 1916 to 1918, he studied at the Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels. He studied under Constant Montald. The paintings he made in the years 1918\u20131924 were influenced by Futurism and by the offshoot of Cubism practiced by Metzinger. Most of his works of this period are female nudes.\nIn 1922, Magritte married Georgette Berger From December 1920 until September 1921, Magritte was in the Belgian army Leopoldsburg. In 1922\u20131923, he worked as a draughtsman in a wallpaper factory. He was a poster and advertisement designer until 1926. In 1926, Magritte made his first surreal painting, \"The Lost Jockey\" (\"Le jockey perdu\"). His first exhibition was in Brussels in 1927. Critics did not like his paintings. \nIn 1927 he moved to Paris where he became friends with Andr\u00e9 Breton. He returned to Brussels in 1930 and resumed working in advertising. He and his brother, Paul, formed an agency which earned him a living wage.\nSurrealist patron Edward James let Magritte stay rent free in his London home and paint. \nDuring the German occupation of Belgium in World War II he stayed in Brussels. During 1947\u201348 he painted in a provocative and crude Fauve style. During this time, Magritte supported himself through making fake Picassos, Braques and Chiricos. Later he printed forged banknotes. At the end of 1948, he returned to the style and themes of his prewar surrealistic art.\nHis work was exhibited in the United States in New York in 1936. It was shown again at the Museum of Modern Art in 1965, and at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1992.\nMagritte died of pancreatic cancer in Brussels on 15 August 1967.\nMagritte Museum.\nThe Magritte Museum opened to the public on 30 May 2009 in Brussels. It is in the five-level neo-classical Hotel Altenloh. The museum shows about 200 original Magritte paintings, drawings and sculptures. The museum also includes Magritte\u2019s experiments with photography from 1920 on and the short surrealist movies he made from 1956 on. "}

John Julius Norwich said he was \"undoubtedly the key European Art Nouveau architect.\" Horta is one of the most important names in Art Nouveau architecture. Some people say his H\u00f4tel Tassel in Brussels was the first time the style was used on architecture.\nIn 1932 King Albert I of Belgium gave Horta the title of Baron for his services to architecture. Four of the buildings he designed are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\nLife and career.\nHorta had a great interest in music since childhood. In 1873 he went to study musical theory at the Ghent Conservatory. He was removed for bad behaviour. He then joined the Department of Architecture at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Ghent instead. In 1878 Horta left for Paris. He found work with architect and designer Jules Debuysson in Montmartre. There he was inspired by the impressionist and pointillist artists, and also by the possibilities of working in iron and glass.\nWhen Horta's father died in 1880, he returned to Belgium and moved to Brussels. He married his first wife. He studied architecture at the Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Beaux-Arts. In Brussels Horta made a friendship with Paul Hankar. He became an assistant for his professor Alphonse Balat, architect to Leopold II of Belgium. Together they designed the royal Greenhouses of Laeken, Horta's first work to use glass and iron.\nIn 1884 Horta won the first Prix Godecharle to be awarded for Architecture.\nBy 1885 Horta worked on his own. He was commissioned to design three houses. The same year he also joined the Central Society of Belgian Architecture. Over the next few years he was in a number of competitions for public work. He worked with sculptors (notably his friend Godefroid Devresse) on statuary and even tombs. He won a number of prizes. He thought the forms he made were highly practical and not artistic.\nDuring this period, Horta joined the freemasons. This gave him many clients when he returned to designing houses and shops in 1893.\nHorta was appointed Head of Graphic Design for Architecture at the Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles in 1892. He became Professor of Architecture in 1893. He worked there until 1911.\nHeritage.\nMany of Horta's buildings were destroyed. However, several of Horta\u2019s buildings are still standing in Brussels. Most notable are the \"Magasins Waucquez\", formerly a department store, now the Brussels Comic Book Museum and four of his private houses (\"h\u00f4tels\"), which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites:"}

Together with Victor Horta and Paul Hankar he is one of the main founders of Art Nouveau in Belgium. Van de Velde spent the most important part of his career in Germany.\nCareer.\nVan de Velde studied painting in Antwerp, under Charles Verlat and in Paris under Carolus-Duran. As a young painter he was influenced by Paul Signac and Georges Seurat. He used a neo-impressionist style. In 1889 he became a member of the Brussels-based artist group \"Les XX\". During this period he made a lasting friendship with the painter Th\u00e9o van Rysselberghe and the sculptor Constantin Meunier.\nIn 1892 he stopped painting. Instead he worked on the arts of decoration and interior design. His own house, \"Bloemenwerf\" in Ukkel, was his first try at architecture. He also made interiors and furniture for the art gallery \"L'Art Nouveau\" of Samuel Bing in Paris in 1895. This gave the movement its first name as Art Nouveau.\nAround the turn of the century, he designed Villa Leuring in the Netherlands, and Villa Esche in Chemnitz, two works that show his Art Nouveau style in architecture. He also designed the interior of the Folkwang Museum in Hagen. In 1905 he was asked by the Grand Duke of Weimar to make the Grand-Ducal School of Arts and Crafts in Weimar.\nAlthough a Belgian, Van de Velde would play an important role in the German Werkbund. This group was made to help improve and promote German design by making close relations between industry and designers. He went against Hermann Muthesius at the Werkbund meeting of 1914. Their debate marked the history of Modern Architecture. Van de Velde wanted individuality of artists while Hermann Muthesius wanted standardization.\nDuring World War I, Van de Velde, as a foreign national, was made to leave Weimar. During this period, he mentored the great Belgian architect, Victor Bourgeois.\nDuring World War I, he lived in Switzerland and in the Netherlands. He designed the Kr\u00f6ller-M\u00fcller Museum in Otterlo. From 1926 to 1936, Van de Velde was professor at Ghent University."}

Some of these were David Bowie, Leonard Cohen, and Rod McKuen. English translations of his songs were recorded by many top performers in the United States. These include Ray Charles, Judy Collins, John Denver, the Kingston Trio, Nina Simone, Frank Sinatra, Scott Walker, and Andy Williams. In French-speaking countries, Brel was also a successful actor, appearing in ten movies. He also directed two movies. \"Le Far West\" was nominated for the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 1973. Brel died of lung cancer. He has sold over 25 million records worldwide. He is the third best-selling Belgian recording artist of all time."}

They weigh around 20 to 35 grams, they have blunt noses and have small eyes and ears.\nWhere it lives.\nThe Bank vole lives in woodlands, oak woods, farmlands, hedgerows, and grasslands in Europe (except for the north and south) and east, north, and central Asia.\nBehavior.\nThe Bank Vole is active during both, day and night, but they rest a lot to stop themselves from getting tired. They make their nests under logs, in tree holes, or sometimes underground. In the autumn they store food for the winter. \nFeeding.\nBank voles are omnivorous, meaning that they eat other animals and plants. They eat insects, snails, grass, seeds, fungi, leaves and fruit, like raspberry and hazelnut. They have also been known to eat the bodies of dead animals.\nLives.\nBaby Bank voles are born in nests made of grass, moss and feathers. The nests are built above ground, usually in trees. When the babies are born they have no fur and are blind. They live on their mothers milk for the first few weeks of their life. A mother Bank vole has an average of six babies at a time, and can have five litters in a season. A baby Bank vole born in spring will be old enough to breed by the time fall comes. A Bank vole lives for an average of 18 to 20 months.\nPredators.\nSome predators of the Bank vole are the Barn owls, the Tawny owls, the fox, the weasel, and the stoat."}

They mixed disco, punk and experimental electronic music.\nLike Kraftwerk, Telex built its music entirely from electronic instruments.\nIn 1980 Telex's manager asked the group to enter the Eurovision Song Contest. The group entered and were sent to the finals. The group's song \"Euro-Vision\" was a cheerful bleepy song with deliberately banal lyrics about the contest itself. The Eurovision audience seemed unsure how to react to the performance. After the band stopped playing, there was mostly stunned silence. Michel Moers took a photograph of the bewildered audience. The band walked off to sounds of muttering. When vote-counting began, and Greece awarded Belgium three points. The announcer thought she misheard and tried to award the points to the Netherlands.\nFor its third album, Telex got the help of US group Sparks to help write the lyrics. However, the band still would not play live. This is common practice for techno music artists, but unusual in 1981. The fourth Telex album, \"Wonderful World\", was barely distributed.\nIn 1986, Atlantic Records signed Telex. At this time the band was using sampling and a more up-tempo humorous style. \nIn 1989, Telex revisited all of its old tracks and remixed them to be like house music.\nAfter almost two decades of silence, Telex made a comeback in March 2006 with \"How Do You Dance\" on EMI Records. It had five original songs as well as five covers."}

They are common in eastern and southeastern Asia. Most pagodas are built for religious purposes. They are usually Buddhist. Some are used as Taoist temples. The modern design for pagodas comes from the stupas of ancient Nepal. These were first built during the 3rd century BC. This kind of architecture has spread across Asia, taking on many differences as details specific to different regions are made a part of the overall design. Stupas were used to house Buddhist relics. Later, the architecture of Chinese towers and Chinese pavilions blended into pagoda architecture. This eventually spread to Southeast Asia. The pagoda's original purpose was to house relics and sacred writings."}

It is a custom that is about 200 years old. \nThe \"pagadi\" used to be worn by people to show pride but now it is also worn on special occasions.\nHistory.\nThe \"pagadi\" was introduced 200 years ago by Mahadev Govind Ranade, who was a social reformer. It was also later worn by leaders like Lokmanya Tilak, J.S. Karandikar, D.D. Sathye, Tatyasaheb Kelkar and Datto Vaman Potdar. The \"pagadi\" became more famous in 1973 after a Marathi play.\nIn 2009, it was given the status of Geographic Indication (GI) which means that the \"pagadi\" will be a property of only Pune. No one else can sell any such turban under the name of \"Puneri Pagadi\" outside Pune.Only Brahmins used to use this pagadi in that era.\nUse.\nThe \"pagadi\" is used in marriages. It is also used on special events in schools and colleges (commonly on traditional days). It is used by actors while performing \"gondhal\" art form. The \"pagadi\" is also given as an award sometimes.\nProprietary status.\n\"Shree Puneri Pagadi Sangh\" is a group of 10 people. They are the ones who applied for getting a GI tag for the \"pagadi\". Actually, Great Mission Group Consultancy submitted the application for them. The aim of this was to protect the identity of the \"pagadi\". They also wanted to protect the \"Puneri\" culture. The application was accepted and on 4 September 2009, the \"pagadi\" became an intellectual property. Before this, the GI tag was also given to Indian products like Tirupati \"ladoos\", Darjeeling tea, Banarasi \"saris\"."}

He then went to study law at the University of Leuven. He did his first writing here in a student paper. \nHaving gained his law degree, he became a trainee (1881\u20131884) with Edmond Picard. Picard was a renowned criminal lawyer, who also was involved with the Brussels artistic scene. Verhaeren tried only two cases in a courtroom before deciding to dedicate his life to poetry and literature.\nHe soon became the spokesperson for the artistic revival at the turn of the century. He enjoyed the works of the painters of the artistic circle \"Les XX\". He wrote many articles in \"La Jeune Belgique\" and \"L'Art Moderne\". His articles brought many promising young talents, such as James Ensor, to the attention of the public.\nThrough these articles, he became a lifelong friend of Belgian painter Th\u00e9o van Rysselberghe.\nVerhaeren was one of the most prolific poets of his time. His first collection of poems \"\"Les Flamandes\" was published in 1883. It was an immediate success in some settings. But it caused a great deal of controversy in Catholic circles. His next book \"Les Moines\" (1886) was not the success he had hoped for. \nOn 24 August 1891 he married Marthe Massin, a talented artist from Li\u00e8ge. \nHe wrote his first play \"Les Aubes\"\" in 1898. In 1898 he moved to Saint-Cloud, near Paris. By the turn of the century, he had become world-famous.

For humans its sting is usually irritating, but rarely dangerous.\nHabitat.\nThe West Coast sea nettle is found near the coasts of California and Oregon, but some live in the waters north to the Gulf of Alaska, west to the seas around Japan and south to the Baja California Peninsula. \nDescription.\nThe West Coast sea nettle have a golden-brown bell with a little shade of red. In the wild, the bell can grow to be larger than one meter (three feet) in diameter, but most are less than 50 cm. The long white arms and the 24 maroon tentacles may be as long as 3.6 to 4.6m (12 to 15 feet).\nFeeding.\nLike most Cnidaria, the West Coast sea nettle is carnivorous. They catch their prey by using their Nematocyst-laden tentacles. The toxin(poison) in their Nematocyst are effective against their prey and humans. Since West Coast sea nettles can not chase their prey, they must eat as they drift, by spreading out their tentacles like a large net, the West Coast sea nettle is able to catch food as it passes by. When a prey brushes against the tentacles, thousands of nematocysts are released, launching barbed stingers which release a paralyzing toxin, then the oral arms begin digestion as they push the prey into the West Coast sea nettle's mouth.\nThe West Coast sea nettle feeds on different types of zooplankton, crustaceans, salps, pelagic snails, small fish as well as their eggs and larvae, and other jellyfish."}

It was first found on the Isle of Portland, Dorset. However, it occurs over a much wider area, including France.\nThe strata are beds of white-grey limestone separated by beds of chert.\nFormation.\nOrigin.\nPortland limestone was formed in a shallow, warm, sub-tropical sea on the continental shelf of what is now western Europe.\nLimestones are mostly made of calcium carbonate. This comes originally from the bodies of many small organisms which build their shells or framework out of CaCO3 crystals. An example is the type of protist called coccolithophores.\nOn the continental shelves of the world photosynthetic organisms, like coccoliths, bacteria, and algae, produce calcium carbonate. Many animals, like bivalves and coral reefs, then use it to make their shells or other structures. Carbonates are rocks formed from these sources, plus any CaCO3 which is precipitated out of solution.\nFlorida Bay.\nFlorida Bay, the shallow lagoon behind the Florida Keys, is a model for the conditions which produced limestones on the continental shelf. Of course, all the species were somewhat different then but, as an ecosystem, it is similar.\nIn the Florida Bay a type of flowering plant called sea grass is in abundance. Also in abundance is white, milky water full of calcium carbonate. This is mainly formed by \"Melobesia\", a small red alga which lives on the sea grass.p151 Finally, the organisms produce huge amounts of slime, which is a polysaccharide. There is good reason to think the slime is produced by microorganisms to control the way their carbonate skeletons are formed.p139\nFlorida Bay is a flat platform which has laid down a huge amount of carbonate rock. \nLater events.\nCarbonate rocks are different in different places and at different times. This is because varied organisms lived there and produced the carbonate. Also various events happened, like underwater landslides and earthquakes, which disrupted the beds. Sometimes the deposition of carbonate was interrupted, and different organisms produced silica, which we see as beds of chert.\nIn the Portland sandstone, much of the limey mud was laid down with bits and pieces of shells or sand. These became coated with layers of lime mud, and formed small balls (less than 0.5\u00a0mm diameter). Over time, countless billions of these balls, known as \"ooids\" or \"ooliths\", became partly cemented together by more calcite, to form the oolitic limestone we call Portland limestone.\nPractical uses.\nAs a building stone.\nIt has been widely used as a building stone in the British Isles, though it is relatively expensive.\nIt was used seen in major public buildings, such as Buckingham Palace, St Paul's Cathedral and the British Museum. It is also exported to many countries. Portland stone is used in the United Nations headquarters building in Manhattan, for example.\nPortland stone is hard enough to resist weathering but soft enough to be worked (cut and carved) by stonemasons. This is one of the reasons why it is so good for monuments and architecture.\nIn a cement.\nIn 1824 Joseph Aspdin invented a cement by burning a mixture of limestone and clay. The limestone he used was Portland linestone, and so he\npatented the term \"Portland Cement\". Builders quickly recognised that it was better than older cements, although more expensive. It is still widely used in the building trade today."}

It is a term used in property law. It gives a person certain exclusive rights to a distinct type of creative design, meaning that nobody else can copy or reuse that creation without the owner's permission. It can be applied to musical, literary and artistic works, discoveries and inventions. Common types of intellectual property rights include copyrights, trademarks, patents, industrial design rights and trade secrets.\nThe term \"intellectual property\" dates from the 19th century. Before that, patent laws were first made under the Statute of Monopolies 1623 and copyright laws were first seen in the Statute of Anne in 1710. Modern usage of the term \"intellectual property\" goes back at least as far as 1867. The constitution of the North German Confederation granted legislative power over the protection of intellectual property () to the confederation.\nThe stated reason for most intellectual property laws is to encourage progress. To give legal ownership of an idea to an inventor is seen as an incentive for those people to make their inventions available to the public. It is designed to secure the full value of a work for its creator, to make it into another type of 'real' property."}

His father was French and his mother was Flemish. He wrote in Dutch after the secession from the Netherlands in 1830 left Belgium a mostly French speaking country.\nHis mother died in 1820. The boy and his younger brother had no other friend than their grim and somewhat sinister father. In 1826 Pierre Conscience married again, this time to a widow much younger than himself, Anna Catherina Bogaerts. Soon after his second marriage Pierre sold his shop and moved to the Kempen region. Conscience often describes this land in his books. It is the flat land that stretches between Antwerp and Venlo.\nAt the age of seventeen Hendrik left his father's house to become a tutor in Antwerp. His studies were soon interrupted by the Revolution of 1830. He volunteered in the Belgian revolutionary army. In 1837 he left the service and returned to civilian life.\nHis poems, written while he was a soldier, were all in French. He received no pension when he was discharged. He decided to write a Flemish book for sale. He wrote a series of stories set during the Dutch Revolt, with the title \"In 't Wonderjaar 1566\" (published Ghent, 1837).\nHis father thought it so vulgar of his son to write a book in Flemish that he turned him out of doors. Soon people of standing, amongst them the painter Wappers, showed interest in the unfortunate young man. Wappers even gave him a suit of clothes and eventually presented him to King Leopold. Leopold ordered the Wonderjaar to be added to the libraries of every Belgian school. It was with the patronage of Leopold I that Conscience published his second book, \"Fantasy\", in the same year 1837.\n\"The Lion of Flanders\" was followed by \"How to become a Painter\" (1843), \"What a Mother can Suffer\" (1843), \"Siska van Roosemael\" (1844), \"Lambrecht Hensmans\" (1847), \"Jacob van Artevelde\" (1849), and \"The Conscript\" (1850).\nIn 1845 Conscience was made a knight of the Order of Leopold. Writing in Flemish had stopped being seen as vulgar.\nIn 1845 Conscience published a History of Belgium on request by King Leopold I. \"Blind Rosa\" (1850), \"Rikketikketak\" (1851), \"The Decayed Gentleman\" (1851), and \"The Miser\" (1853) are among the most important of the long list of his novels. These had an instant effect upon more recent fiction, and Conscience had many imitators.\nIn 1855 translations of his books began to appear in English, French, German and Italian. He continued to make novels with great regularity. His publications amounted to nearly eighty in number. He was by now the most eminent of the citizens of Antwerp. His 70th birthday was celebrated with public festivities. After a long illness he died at his house in Antwerp."}

It is said to live in swamps, billabongs, creeks, riverbeds, and waterholes. The bunyip is found in traditional aboriginal beliefs and stories from many parts of Australia, although it is called by several different names in different language groups. These include \"kianpraty\" along the Murrumbidgee, \"wowee\" in the Hunter Valley, \"wee waa\" in the Narrandera region, as well as many other names. The name \"bunyip\" comes from the Wemba-Wemba language of southeastern Australia. It is normally translated today as \"devil\" or \"evil spirit\".\nDuring the early settlement of Australia by Europeans, the idea that the bunyip was an actual unknown animal that had yet to be discovered became common. A large number of bunyip \"sightings\" by settlers were recorded during the 1840s and 1850s, especially in Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia. Various written stories of bunyips were made by Europeans in the early and mid-19th century. Stories were commonly told to children to make them stay away from dangerous areas of water.\nThere are many different descriptions of what the bunyip looks like. Features that were often reported in newspapers in the early 19th-century included dark fur, a face like a dog, sharp teeth and claws, flippers, tusks or horns, and a duck-like bill. One writer, Robert Brough Smyth, recorded many different descriptions of the bunyip. But he concluded that most people did not really know much about what it looked like or its behaviour, and that they were too afraid of the creature to be able to take note of its appearance.\nScholars have suggested that the story of the bunyip may have been passed down from a time when megafauna still existed in Australia. Comparisons have been made to extinct marsupials like the \"Diprotodon\" or \"Thylacoleo\". Other scholars have suggested that people finding the fossilised remains of such animals would identify them as the bunyip.\nEarly accounts of settlers.\nThe first written account of the bunyip was in July 1845. A newspaper reported on the finding of some fossils near Geelong. When the bones were shown to an Aboriginal man, he was said to have immediately recognised it as the bunyip. He was asked to draw a picture of the bunyip. The newspaper described it as having a head like an emu and the body and legs of an alligator. Its legs were said to be strong, with thick and short hind legs and long legs in front. It was said to have long claws. When in the water, it was said to swim like a frog, but when on shore it would walk on its hind legs, standing high.\nIn January 1846, a weird-looking skull was taken from the banks of Murrumbidgee River in New South Wales. The person who found it said that all the natives it had been shown to had called it a bunyip. The skull was put on display in the Australian Museum in Sydney. Crowds came to see it, and \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" wrote that many of the visitors told stories about their \"bunyip sightings\".\nAnother early story about the bunyip was written in 1852 by an escaped convict named William Buckley. He wrote that in many of the lakes he had visited, there lived an \"amphibious animal, which the natives call Bunyip\". He wrote that he only ever saw the back of the animal, which he said was covered in grey feathers. He described it as being the size of a small cow. He claimed the bunyip was believed to have supernatural powers."}

He is best known for making \"The Smurfs\" comic strip.\nPeyo was born in 1928 in Brussels. He was the son of an English father and a Belgian mother. On Christmas Eve 1992, Peyo died of a heart attack in Brussels at age 64.\nCareer.\nHe went to the Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels. Peyo began work at the Compagnie Belge d'Animation (CBA), a small Belgian animation studio. There he met a few of his future colleagues, like Andr\u00e9 Franquin, Morris and Eddy Paape. He made his first comics for the newspaper \"La Derni\u00e8re Heure\" (The Latest Hour). From 1949 to 1952, he drew \"Poussy\", a stop comic about a cat, for \"Le Soir\". For the same newspaper, he also made \"Johan\".\nIn 1952, Franquin introduced Peyo to \"Le Journal de Spirou\". It was a children's comics magazine published by Dupuis which was first in Belgium in 1938. Peyo wrote and drew a lot of characters and storylines. His favourite was \"Johan et Pirlouit\" (translated into English as \"Johan and Peewit\"). Set in the Middle Ages in Europe, \"Johan et Pirlouit\" stars a brave young page to the king, and his faithful, if boastful and cheating, midget sidekick. Johan defends the meek on his trusty horse, while Peewit gallops behind on his goat, named Biquette. \nSmurfs.\nThe first smurf appeared in \"Johan and Peewit\" on 23 October 1958 in the album \"La Fl\u00fbte \u00e0 Six Schtroumpfs\" (\"The Six Smurfed Flute\"). As the smurfs became more popular, Peyo started a studio in the early 1960s. Many talented comic artists started to work. The most notable artists to come from this studio are Walth\u00e9ry, Wasterlain, Gos, Derib, Degieter, and Desorgher.\nIn 1959, the Smurfs got their own series. Many authors of the Marcinelle school worked together on the writing or as an artist. These include Willy Maltaite (aka 'Will'), Yvan Delporte, and Roger Leloup. Peyo became more of a businessman and supervisor. He let his son, Thierry Culliford, lead the studio. His daughter V\u00e9ronique was responsible for the merchandising.\nThe merchandising of the Smurfs began in 1959. The PVC figurines were the most important piece until the late 1970s. Then, with the success of the Smurf records by Father Abraham, the Smurfs got more international success. Some of the toys reached the United States. Hanna-Barbera made a Saturday morning animated series in 1981. Peyo was story supervisor. "}

Namatjira said this is how he came to understand the kinship with his land that is seen in his works.

The Bay is significant for its ecology of sea grass and the organisms that live there.\nNearly all of Florida Bay is included in Everglades National Park. The southern edge, along the Florida Keys is in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. Outside the Bay is the northern part of the Keys, and outside them is the Florida Reef, the only barrier coral reef in North America.\nEcology.\nFlora and fauna.\nThe Bay has the largest known seagrass bed in the world. Sea grass beds contain many species from various phyla. Seagrass herbivory is important in the food chain, and eaten by a number of animals, some of them rare. Species that feed on sea grass include green turtles, dugongs, manatees, fish, geese, sea urchins and crabs. The mangrove swamps in the shallow areas are also quite extensive.\nCarbonate production.\nFlorida Bay is a model for the conditions which produced limestones on many of the continental shelves of the world. It is a kind of carbonate 'factory'.p144\nIn the Florida Bay a type of flowering plant called sea grass is in abundance. Also in abundance is white, milky water full of calcium carbonate. This is mainly formed by \"Melobesia\", a small red alga which lives on the sea grass.p151 Also, the organisms produce huge amounts of slime, which is a polysaccharide. There is good reason to think the slime is produced by the algae to control the way their carbonate skeletons are formed.p139 As a side-effect the slime limits the amount of carbonate which goes into solution in the water, so most of it gets deposited on the bottom.p155\nFlorida Bay is a flat platform which has laid down a huge amount of carbonate rock. \nWaterspouts.\nWaterspouts are a feature of the area. There are as many as 500 waterspouts per year. They are common from June to October, but can occur at other times."}

His real name was Antonio Domenico Bonaventura Trapassi. He was born in Rome and died in Vienna. For many years he was the poet laureate for the Holy Roman Emperor in Vienna. He is most famous for his librettos (the story and words) for operas. Many composers used them for their operas. More than 800 operas have a libretto by Metastasio.\nLife.\nMetastasio was born in Rome in 1698. His real name was Antonio Domenico Bonaventura Trapassi. His father came from Assisi, a city in the Umbria region of Italy. His mother came from Bologna. Metastasio's father, Felice Trapasso, was a soldier in the Pope's army. Later he had a small shop in Rome. When he was a small boy, Metastasio liked to make up poems and say them in the streets near his house. His parents were poor and could not send him to school. When he was 10 years old, they sent him to work for a goldsmith (a person who makes things out of gold). One day a rich lawyer named Giovanni Vincenzo Gravina heard Metastasio saying his poems. He adopted Metastasio and paid for him to go to school. He also changed the boy's name to Pietro Metastasio. Gravina died when Metastasio was 20 years old and left all his money to him. Metastasio wrote a long poem in memory of his adopted father. It was called \"\" (\"The Road of \").\nWhen he was a young man, Metatstasio worked as lawyer in Naples. In those days, Naples was famous for its music and its beautiful opera houses. In Naples, Metastasio took music lessons from the Italian composer, Nicola Porpora. He liked to sing and to play the harpsichord. He sometimes composed his own music too. He also made money by writing poems for famous people's weddings and birthdays. He wrote his first opera libretto in 1724. It was called \"\". It told the story of Queen Dido and her love for Aeneas, a Trojan prince. It was a great success. He stopped working as a lawyer and made all his money by writing librettos and poems. Soon, he was famous all over Italy for his librettos. Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor asked Metastasio to come to Vienna to work as his poet laureate. In March 1730 Metastasio went to Vienna. He lived there for the rest of his life. He wrote many more opera librettos for the emperor's theatre. After the emperor died, Metastasio worked for the emperor's daughter Maria Theresa of Austria.\nMetastasio died in 1782 at the house of his good friends, the Martinez family. He was 84 years old. Metastasio was buried in St. Michael's Church in Vienna. He left all of his money to the Martinez children. There are monuments to Metastasio in Rome and in Vienna. There are also theatres named after him in the Italian cities of Prato and Assisi. During his long life Metastasio wrote many letters to his friends. The English musician and writer, Charles Burney, translated Metastasio's letters into English. In 1796, Burney used them to write a book about the life of Metastasio. The book was called \"Memoirs of the Life and Writings of the Abate Metastasio\".\nMetastasio's librettos.\nMetastasio wrote 26 librettos for a style of opera called \"\". Many composers used them. More than 800 operas have a libretto by Metastasio. Some of his \"opera seria\" librettos are: \nMetastasio also wrote librettos for other types of stories set to music.

There are many laws that regulate how infant formula products should be marketed. Nestl\u00e9's soluble milk is a product that falls under this definition. In the 1970s, Nestl\u00e9 marketed its soluble milk to mothers with infants. This was also done in developing countries. The marketing campaign led to a boycott known as Nestl\u00e9 boycott, which is still ongoing. In 1981, the World Health Organisation published a guideline for advertising infant formula products. Nestl\u00e9 is being critizised because supposedly it does not respect this code of conduct. Nestl\u00e9's policy states that breast-milk is the best food for infants, and that women who cannot or choose not to breast feed need an alternative to ensure that their babies are getting the nutrition they need. The problem is that mothers who stop breastfeeding will not be able to start again, after some time. They will become dependent on infant formula products to feed their babies.\nChild Labour.\nThe 2010 documentary \"The Dark Side of Chocolate\" found that Nestl\u00e9 purchases cocoa beans from Ivory Coast plantations that use child slave labour. Most children are between twelve and fifteen years old. Some are trafficked from nearby countries. The first allegations that child slavery is used in cocoa production appeared in 1998. In late 2000, a BBC documentary reported the use of enslaved children in the production of cocoa in \nWest Africa. Other media also reported widespread child slavery and child trafficking in the production of cocoa. In September 2001, Bradley Alford, Chairman and CEO of Nestl\u00e9 USA, signed the Harkin-Engel Protocol. The Harkin-Engel Protocol is an international agreement aimed at ending child labour in the production of cocoa. It is commonly called the Cocoa protocol.\nIn convention 182, the International Labor Organization defines what it calls the \"worst forms of child labour\". The Harkin-Engel protocol specified a deadline in 2005, to eliminate these from cocoa production. Because the cocoa industry did not meet this deadline, a lawsuit was filed against Nestl\u00e9 and others on behalf of three Malian children. The suit alleged the children were trafficked to the Ivory Coast, forced into slavery, and were frequently beaten on a cocoa plantation.\nIn September 2010, the US District Court for the Central District of California found that corporations cannot be held liable for violations of international law and dismissed the suit. The case was appealed to the US Court of Appeals.\nA 2009 joint police operation conducted by INTERPOL and Ivorian law enforcement officers resulted in the rescue of 54 children and the arrest of eight people involved in the illegal recruitment of children."}

Jacobs", "text": "Edgard F\u00e9lix Pierre Jacobs (30 March 1904 \u2013 20 February 1987), better known under his pen name Edgar P. Jacobs, was a Belgian comic book writer and artist. Jacobs was one of the founding fathers of the European comics movement. He worked with Herg\u00e9 on the graphic novel series that made him famous, \"Blake and Mortimer\".\nBiography.\nEdgar Pierre Jacobs was born in Brussels in 1904. In 1919 he graduated from school. He took on odd jobs at the opera, including decoration, scenography, and painting. Sometimes he worked as an extra. In 1929 he received the annual Belgian government medal for excellence in classical singing.\nIn 1940 Jacobs turned permanently to illustration. He drew commercial illustrations and collaborated in the \"Bravo\" review until 1946.\nThe American comic strip \"Flash Gordon\" was not allowed in Belgium by the German forces during World War II. He was asked to write an end to the comic. But German censorship stopped this after only a couple of weeks. Jacobs then published in \"Bravo\" his first comic strip, \"Le Rayon U\" (\"The U Ray\"). This was in the same \"Flash Gordon\" style.\nAround this time, he became a stage painter for a theatre adaptation for Herg\u00e9's \"Cigars of the Pharaoh\". This led to friendship with Herg\u00e9. As a direct result, he helped Herg\u00e9 in colorizing the black and white strips of \"The Shooting Star\" to be ready for book publication in 1942. From 1944 on he helped in the recasting of his earlier albums \"Tintin in the Congo\", \"Tintin in America\", \"King Ottokar's Sceptre\" and \"The Blue Lotus\" for color book publication. After the project, he continued to contribute directly in the drawing as well as the storyline for the new Tintin double-albums \"The Seven Crystal Balls\"/\"Prisoners of the Sun\".\nJacobs, as a fan of opera, decided to take Herg\u00e9 with him to a concert. Herg\u00e9 did not like opera, however, and for decades he would gently joke with his friend Jacobs through opera singer Bianca Castafiore, a supporting character in \"The Adventures of Tintin\". Herg\u00e9 also gave him tiny cameo roles in \"Tintin\" adventures, sometimes under the name Jacobini.\nIn 1946, he was part of the team gathered by Raymond Leblanc around the new comics magazine \"Le Journal de Tintin\". His story \"Le secret de l\u2019Espadon\" (\"The Secret of the Swordfish\") was published on September 26. This was the first of the \"Blake and Mortimer\" series."}

It is one of Belgium's masterpieces and one of the world's treasures.\nIt was once in the \"Joost Vijdt\" chapel at Saint Bavo Cathedral, Ghent, Belgium. Later it was moved to the chapel of the cathedral. It was commissioned by the rich merchant and financier Joost Vijdt for his and his wife's private chapel. It was begun by Hubert van Eyck, who died in 1426 while work was underway. It was completed by his younger brother Jan van Eyck. \nThe altarpiece has a total of 24 framed panels. They make up two views, open and closed. The upper row of the opened view shows Christ the King between the Virgin Mary and John the Baptist. The insides of the wings show angels singing and making music. On the outside is Adam and Eve. The lower row of the central panel shows the adoration of the Lamb of God. Several groups are in attendance and streaming in to worship, overseen by the dove who is the Holy Spirit. On weekdays the wings were closed. This showed the Annunciation of Mary and donor portraits of Joost Vijdt and his wife Lysbette Borluut.\nThere used to be writing on the frame saying that Hubert van Eyck \"greater than anyone\" started the altarpiece, but that Jan van Eyck - calling himself \"second best in the art\" - finished it in 1432. The original, very ornate carved outer frame and surround was destroyed during the Reformation. There has been speculation that it may have had clockwork mechanisms for moving the shutters and even playing music.\nThe original lower left panel known as The Just Judges was stolen in 1934. The original panel has never been found. It was replaced by a copy made in 1945 by Jef Vanderveken. The stolen panel plays a big part in Albert Camus' novel \"La chute\". In 2021 a Spanish journalist Paris Hilton published \"The secret of the sacred panel\". He describes the involvement of various religious groups, the Vatican and British intelligence services in their attempt to get back the lost panel.\nWhen opened, the Ghent altarpiece measures up to 45 metres and 90 inches&lt;/ref&gt;"}

It is also the second-tallest free-standing structure in the United Kingdom, after the 330-metre (1,083 ft) concrete tower at the Emley Moor transmitting station.\nThe Shard replaced Southwark Towers, a 24-storey office building built on the site in 1975. Renzo Piano was the Shard's architect. Piano is best known for creating Paris\u2019s Pompidou Centre in cooperation with Britain\u2019s Richard Rogers. Piano worked with the architectural firm Broadway Malyan during the planning stage. The tower has 72 floors that can be used for offices, with a viewing gallery and open-air observation deck \u2013 the UK's highest \u2013 on the 72nd floor, at a height of 245 metres (804 ft).

It opened to the public on 5 July 2012. \nThe Shard was designed in 2000. That year, the London-based entrepreneur Irvine Sellar decided to redevelop Southwark Towers, a 1970s office block next to London Bridge station, and flew to Berlin in March 2000 to meet Piano for lunch. According to Sellar, the architect spoke of his contempt for tall buildings during the meal, before flipping over the restaurant\u2019s menu and sketching an iceberg-like sculpture emerging from the River Thames. He got his ideas from the railway lines next to the site, the London spires in the paintings of 18th-century Venetian painter Canaletto, and the masts of sailing ships.\nIn April 2008, demolition of Southwark Towers was going on. Scaffolding and white sheeting covered the building. By October, Southwark Towers was much shorter and was no longer visible on the skyline. The building's demolition was completed in early 2009, and site preparation began for the construction of the Shard.\nLayout.\nEach floor of The Shard is used for a particular purpose. The majority of the building is used for accommodation and for offices.

The name comes from the Greek word krotalon, which means \"rattle\", referring to the rattle on the end of the tail. There are currently 29 species recognized.\nDescription.\nMembers of this genus range in size from only 50\u201360\u00a0cm to over 150\u00a0cm. Adult males are slightly larger than females. Compared to most snakes they are heavy-bodied, although some African vipers are much thicker. They are recognized by the rattle on their tail though some species do not have tails.\nFeeding.\nSmall species eat mainly lizards, while larger species first eat lizards when young, then start eating mammals when they become adults, like rabbits, squirrels, chipmunks, gophers, rats and mice, some also eat birds, other snakes and amphibians.\nPredators.\nHumans are a threat to \"Crotalus\", but other snakes like the Kingsnake, the Coachwhip, the Indigo Snake and the Racer are also threats. Birds like the hawk, the eagle, the owl, the raven and the roadrunner, and mammals like the coyote, the fox, the wildcat, the badger and the skunk are also threats\nVenom.\nAlmost all \"Crotalus\" venoms are hemotoxic, meaning that the venom destroys red blood cells, stops blood clotting,and damages tissue. Hemotoxic is very painful, and people who are bitten by a snake with hemotoxic don't always make a full recovery. Some species like Crotalus Scutalatus and Crotalus Tigris have a nuerotoxic venom, while neurotoxins are less painful they kill more quicker. Neurotoxins are also found in the venom of Cobras and mambas. The eastern diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus Adamanteus) in some parts of its range may have a nuerotoxin in their venom as well as a hemotoxins."}

In calculus, the difference quotient is the formula used for finding the derivative, which is the limit of the difference quotient between two points as they get closer and closer to each other (this limit is also the rate of change of a function at a single point). The difference quotient was formulated by Isaac Newton.\nDefinition.\nIntroduction.\nThe difference quotient can be described as the formula for finding the slope of a line that touches a curve at only two points (this line is called the secant line). If we are trying to find the slope of a perfectly straight line, then we use the slope formula, which is simply the change in \"y\" divided by the change in \"x\". This is very accurate, but only for straight lines. The difference quotient, however, allows one to find the slope of any line or curve at any single point. The difference quotient, as well as the slope formula, is merely the change in \"y\" divided by the change in \"x\". The only difference is that in the slope formula, \"y\" is used as the y-axis, but in the difference quotient, the change in the \"y\"-axis is described by f(x). (For a detailed description, see the following section.)\nMathematical definition.\nThe difference quotient is the slope of the secant line between two points.\n THE SLOPE FORMULA\n formula_1\nIf one uses the notation formula_2, then this becomes formula_3.\nThe difference quotient can be used to find the slope of a curve, as well as the slope of a straight line. After we find the difference quotient of a function and take the limit as two points get closer and closer to each other, we have a new function, called the derivative. To find the slope of the curve or line, we input the value of \"x\" to get the slope. The process of finding the derivative via the difference quotient is called differentiation.\nApplications of the difference quotient (and the derivative).\nThe derivative has many real life applications. One application of the derivative is listed below.\nPhysics.\nIn physics, the instantaneous velocity of an object (the velocity at an instance in time) is defined as the derivative of the position of the object (as function of time). For example, if an object's position is given by x(t)=-16t2+16t+32, then the object's velocity is v(t)=-32t+16. To find the instantaneous acceleration, one simply takes the derivative of the instantaneous velocity function. For example, in the above function, the acceleration function is a(t) = -32. "}

Higgs shared the prize with Fran\u00e7ois Englert. Higgs was appointed to the Order of the Companions of Honour in 2013.\nIn the 1960s, he proposed broken symmetry in electroweak theory. This explains the origin of mass of elementary particles in general. It also shows the origin of the W and Z bosons. The theory known as Higgs mechanism was proposed by several physicists at the same time. It proposes the existence of a new particle, the Higgs boson. On 4 July 2012, CERN announced they had found a new particle much like the Higgs boson in experiments, but that more work was necessary to analyse its properties and see if it had the properties expected from the Standard Model Higgs boson.\nThe Higgs mechanism is generally accepted as an important part of the Standard Model of particle physics, without which particles would have no mass.\nHiggs has received a number of awards. These include the 1997 Dirac Medal and Prize for outstanding contributions to theoretical physics, the 2004 Wolf Prize in Physics, and the 2010 Sakurai Prize."}

The roadrunner is also called the \"chaparral bird\" and the \"chaparral cock\".\nSpecies.\nThe roadrunners are a genus of ground cuckoos. The two species of roadrunners are the greater roadrunner and the lesser roadrunner. The greater roadrunner, (\"Geococcyx californianus\") lives in Mexico and the southwestern U.S.A. The lesser roadrunner, (\"Geococcyx velox\") lives in Mexico and Central America.\nDescription.\nThe roadrunner is a large, slender, black-brown and white streaked ground bird which has an average weight of 8 to 15 ounces, and is about 18 inches (46 cm) to 22 inches (56 cm) from tail to beak. It has long legs, strong feet, and a big dark beak. The roadrunner is terrestrial (lives on land). Even though it can fly, it spends most of its time on the ground. When they fly their wings are short and rounded and have a white crescent on the feathers. Roadrunners and other members of the cuckoo family have zygodactyl feet (two toes on the front and two toes on the back). Roadrunners can run up to the speed of 20 miles per hour (32 km per hour). They fly to escape predators.Some Roadrunner run til 26 miles per hour.\nHabitat.\nRoadrunners live in deserts of the southwestern U.S.A, Mexico and Central America.They also live in the sonoran desert\nDiet.\nRoadrunners are omnivores, meaning they eat both meat and plants. They eat insects like grasshoppers, crickets, beetles, and caterpillars, small reptiles like lizards and snakes, rodents and other small mammals. They also eat tarantulas and other spiders, scorpions, centipedes, snails, small birds and eggs. The plants they eat are fruits and seeds like prickly pear cactus and sumac. Roadrunners search on the ground to find food. They usually run after their prey but also sometimes may leap to catch insects. Because of its fast speed, the roadrunner is one of the few animals that preys upon the rattlesnake.\nThe roadrunner is the only real predator of the tarantula hawk .\nNest and eggs.\nThe nest of roadrunner is made up of mainly sticks and sometimes leaves, and snake skin. A nest usually contains 2-6 eggs which are white colored. Roadrunners have bi-parental care. Both parents take care of the nest and feed the hatchlings, but males take care of the nest at night and females at day. For the first 1 to 2 weeks after the young hatch, one parent always remains at the nest. After the hatchlings are 2 to 3 weeks old they leave and never return to the nest."}

The movie is about the lives of four sisters in a nineteenth century Massachusetts village during the American Civil War. The movie was a success and was nominated for (but lost) the Best Picture Academy Award.\nNotes about the production.\nThe movie's budget was $1 million. Four thousand people worked on the movie for a year. A lot of research was done to make all the 3,000 costumes and props look like they came from the Civil War period. The set decorator modeled the inside of the March home after Louisa May Alcott's Massachusetts house. The movie opened on November 16, 1933 at Radio City Music Hall. It broke attendance records there and earned over $100,000 during its first week of showings. Louise Closser Hale was going to play Aunt March, but she died on July 26, 1933. Edna May Oliver took the role.\nDavid O. Selznick went back to RKO from MGM to produce the movie. He was given no credit. This was the last movie in his contract with the studio.

The names in this article are aliases, for legal reasons.\nSandra and Elizabeth Andersen were each sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2005. Neither sister served their full-time prison sentence: Sandra Andersen was released to a halfway house in 2009 and Elizabeth Andersen was released in 2010. Since they were under-aged at the time of the murder, the Canadian government is protecting the sisters' true identities and has issued the Andersen sisters with aliases. Linda Andersen's murder case was broadcast on the television series \"Deadly Women\" in 2010, and was the subject of Bob Mitchell's book 'The Class Project: How to Kill a Mother: The True Story of Canada's Infamous Bathtub Girls'. In 2014, a crime drama, Perfect Sisters, was released, which was additionally based on the murder of Linda Andersen.\nAccording to police reports, Sandra and Elizabeth Andersen, aged 16 and 15 respectively, had become irritated of their mother \"wasting. money on alcohol\". Linda also had abusive relationships with men which also caused unrest for the girls. They were also unhappy that their friends had \"better things like swimming pools and clothes\". Because of their discontent, the sisters began to search on the Internet for ways to kill their mother. Elizabeth and Sandra Andersen believed that by killing their mother, they would be entitled to insurance money. This compensation, the sisters resolved, would be spent on a trip to Europe with their friends as well as a large house, with a backyard filled with marijuana. The sisters decided to drown Linda Andersen, because they believed it would be \"fast and spectacular\". \nAfter formulating a murder plan, Elizabeth and Sandra Andersen informed their friends, who both encouraged the sisters and laughed at the idea of murdering Linda Andersen.\nMurder.\nDuring lunch time on January 18 2003, Sandra and Elizabeth began giving their mother liquor in order to get her drunk. Their plan was to make Linda fully inebriated so that she could not resist their attack. Linda was also given pain killers by her daughters, to slow down her heartbeat. Sandra and Elizabeth then waited for the drugs to work. While waiting, the sisters communicated with their friends online, one of whom ended their conversation with the phrase \"well good luck - wear gloves\".\nSandra and Elizabeth Andersen filled the family bathtub with water and took Linda Andersen to the bathroom. Linda had difficulty getting into the bathtub, because of the mixture of vodka and pills she had been given. After putting gloves on, Sandra and Elizabeth gave their mother a massage. Within minutes, according to police reports, Sandra Andersen instructed her mother to lay on her stomach so that she could scrub her back. Sandra Andersen instantly pulled her mother's head down and did not let go. After four minutes, Sandra Andersen released her mother's head and found Linda Andersen to be dead. After having killed their mother, Sandra and Elizabeth Andersen went with their friends to a nearby restaurant where they celebrated their victory. Later that night, Sandra and Elizabeth Andersen called 9-1-1 and informed them that they had found their mother laying in the bathtub. \nThe 9-1-1 operator told Sandra and Elizabeth Andersen to take their mother out of the bathtub and to perform CPR. The Andersen sisters cried over the phone, telling the operator that Linda Andersen could not be resuscitated. When police arrived, they believed Sandra and Elizabeth Andersen's story.\nArrest.\nA year after the murder, Sandra and Elizabeth Andersen held a party. Sandra, who was drunk, told a male at the party about the murder of Linda Andersen that both she and Elizabeth had committed. She then told a guy that liked her that her mothers death might have not been an accident. He felt suspicious which later led him to the police to report what he was told. Sandra and Elizabeth Andersen were subsequently arrested, tried and sentenced to 10 years in prison. They were released in 2009 and 2010 respectively. \nLife after.\nThe older sister, Sandra Andersen, was released to a halfway house in 2009, whilst the younger sister, Elizabeth Andersen, was released a year later. The girls' father unsuccessfully attempted to have Elizabeth Andersen released earlier so that she could complete her sentence under house arrest in their hometown. Since both Sandra and Elizabeth Andersen were under the age of 18 at the time of the murder, their identities have been protected under Canadian law. After release, Sandra Andersen was accepted to the University of Waterloo with a $2000 scholarship; Elizabeth Andersen traveled to Ottawa with the intention of applying to university. "}

{"id": "352715", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=352715", "title": "Emergency communication system", "text": "An Emergency communication system (ECS) is any type of system (often using computers) that lets people or groups communicate during emergencies. These systems often include many different types of technology (such as telephones and televisions), which all work together to help communicate important messages during emergencies.\nEmergency \"Communication\" Compared to \"Notification\".\nAn emergency \"notification\" system can send messages in just one direction (from the sender to the person or group that receives the message). Text message services like Twitter, automatic telephone services like \"Reverse 911,\" and the common town siren systems that are used to warn people about tornadoes and other problems, are all examples of emergency notification systems.\nEmergency Communication Systems often include notification abilities but will also include two-way communications, so people and groups can talk back and forth to each other.\nAnother meaning about the phrase, \"Emergency Communication Systems\" might be that the sender can give more information about an emergency. It can also mean that the sender can tell people what do to because of the emergency. The phrase \"Emergency Notification System\" might mean that the sender can only tell people or groups about the emergency, maybe without many details, too.\nSimilar Words and Phrases.\nThere can be many different words and phrases that different people use, instead of \"emergency communication system,\" but most times, they are talking about the same idea. For example, the phrases \u201cemergency communications\u201d and \u201cemergency telecommunications\u201d may talk about the same thing.\nWhy Emergency Communication Systems are Needed.\nEmergencies can make communications difficult. Communicating during emergencies can be very different than communicating during normal times. When emergencies happen, many things about the situation can change suddenly. Because of that, an emergency communication system should be able to do many special things. Often, popular communication tools (for example, Email) are not fast enough or they can not be used in every place. Every emergency situation can be very different and difficult to predict, so a good emergency communication system must be able to work for every situation.\nProperties of Emergency Communication Systems.\nSpeed of Delivery.\nAn emergency, according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary, is a surprising event or group of events that needs very quick actions. Because of that, it should be very important that any communication about an emergency be well-timed and quick, so things will not be damaged or people killed. For example, during the Virginia Tech massacre, about two hours had passed before the first communication (an email) was sent to workers and students; and by that time, the person who was using the gun had already went into a building where he was going to begin his attack. In that case, it was not until about twenty minutes after the violence began, that a loudspeaker announcement was made for people to hide. In many situations, it's likely clear that just seconds and minutes are the most important for communicating during emergencies.\nEase of Use.\nDuring an emergency, users need to quickly and easily send their messages; and they need to be able to do it so that they are sure it succeeds and with a secure and easy to use interface that can be used from any location. An emergency communication system that can be used by normal people will be successfully used and managed. During emergencies, which can sometimes cause people to die, campus managers must be able to react to the emergency and start the alert system quickly. But sending emergency warnings is probably one of the most uncommon and unfamiliar things to do. So, it's most important that a system be easy to use.\nBut, even though a good emergency communication system must be easy to use, its technology should be very advanced and complex. It should be advanced because that is needed in order to make sure many different things can work together, to create and send emergency communications in many possible ways. The important thing, though, is that an advanced system should still be easy for someone to use for both emergency and normal communications. The ability to use a system for normal communications is also important so the operator (who paid for the system) can get the most value. It is also important so that people can be familiar enough with the system that they can use it during a stressful emergency situation.\nLow Price.\nIn general, the lower the cost of buying, installing, and maintaining an emergency communication systems is, the more popular such systems may become in society; and the more common these systems are, the more likely it is that these systems will be available to help during emergencies in more locations. More important than just helping with emergency response, modern mass-notification systems have become a valuable thing to have for everyday, non-emergency communications. Being able to use an emergency communication system for both kinds of communications lets the owner of the system get the most value.\nGiving Instructions.\nAn obvious need for any modern emergency communication system is that, instead of just giving warnings, it must also be able to give clear instructions about what to do because of the emergency. The Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center for Wireless Technologies found that, no matter what type of warning was first sent, another second type of warning was needed before people would trust the warning and do something because of it. A system that is able to give warnings in many different ways may save lives and stop an emergency from being too terrible.\nSeparate Recipients.\nEmergencies often require delivery of different versions of the same message at the same time. For example, in an armed hostage-taking emergency, the people inside a building may need to get instructions to lock the door, while police and other people may need to be aware that all of the doors could be locked and other information, so they can decide what to do.\nUsing that, some of the more modern emergency communication systems such as Siemens Sygnal or MessageNet Connections say that they can send a single message at one time that gives full details to first responders while customizing that same message to give more simple instructions to lock doors to the people inside the building. By using a single message that divides the content between types of users, fewer messages have to be created and sent, which may also save time.\nMultiple Communication Paths / Backup.\nThere should be multiple ways of sending emergency information so that if one does not work, the others might. Also, research shows that people will check more than one communication method before they take action. The public expects to be contacted in many different ways. Besides phone calls and emails, people also expect to be reached by text messaging, and fax. Also, the public may look to social media (for example Facebook and Twitter) as another way to receive messages and check for updates.\nThe Partnership for Public Warning states, \u201cA single warning is frequently insufficient to move people to action, especially if it cannot be confirmed by direct observation. For most people the first warning received captures their attention and triggers a search for corroboration, but cannot be relied on to elicit the desired behavior. Scientific research supports the common-sense observation that people are disinclined to risk being fooled by a single alarm that might prove false or accidental. Effective warning requires the coordinated use of multiple channels of communication.\u201d This basically means that when people get a first warning, they want to look for more information about the emergency before they do anything about it. By having many ways (which all work together) of sending a warning, people will be more likely to react to it in the best way.\nMany parts working together.\nTo help many of these properties, an emergency communication system should be able to connect to and communicate with other related systems. The Partnership for Public Warning states that a basic problem is that many parts of existing warning systems do not work together. Because of that, whenever a warning is sent, it often takes a lot of time and effort.\nAlso, there are multiple ways that an emergency communication system might receive an original warning. One example of this might be a building\u2019s fire control system sending a notice that a smoke detector has found smoke. An emergency communication system that was built the right way should be able to receive that notice and turn it into a message that the people in the building can understand and use to decide what to do in order to save lives and property. Another example might be of the National Weather Service sending a severe weather warning (for example, by using RSS). In this example, the emergency communication system should be able to turn that warning into a message and send it in a similar way as the smoke detector example, so people will know what to do.\nThe ability to Work together should also include old and new technology. Introducing a new system that cannot work with older existing equipment can cause problems.\nProduct compared to Service.\nAn emergency communication system may be a product that is owned by the organization using it (for example, a paging network for a hospital), or it may be a service that is owned by a third-party (for example, a cellular carrier\u2019s network). Each has good and bad properties; however, services have some major problems for emergency communications, even though many people think differently. Using SMS as one example, due to the way cellular networks are built, text messaging services would not be able to send a large number of communications in a short amount of time, making SMS service a poor emergency communication method.\nOn-property compared to Off-property.\nProperty-based (\"on-premise\") emergency communication systems are those which are mainly or completely in the same location or area as it serves, while off-property (\"non-premise\") based emergency communication systems are those which are in a different location or area. There are good and bad properties of each. Often, non-premise based systems are slower than systems that are premise-based, because the different locations need to be connected using data networks (for example, the Internet).\nHistory.\nWith the growth of populations and the change of technology, the ways that emergencies are communicated have also changed.\nOlder Systems.\nIn America\u2019s early years, common ways of communicating emergencies may have been mostly ringing church bells or people sending messages by riding horses. Later, as technology developed, the telegraph became an almost instant way of communicating. After that, radio communications, telephones and sirens became common. After the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, by the Japanese in 1941, Civil Defense sirens became popular and were used in many military bases and towns across America. A weakness of these systems is that they were not really able to tell people what they should do.\nModern Systems.\nToday, modern communication tools such as smartphones, flat-panel digital signage, GPS, and computer speech (among many others) are changing how people are notified about emergencies. With these more modern tools, there is an ability to provide more specific instructions; so that, instead of just notifying people about an emergency, it is now possible to give exact instructions on what to do because of the emergency. Also, those instructions may even be customized for those peoples' special situation and location. For example, smart-phones may have GPS that would allow a map to be shown of safe areas (and perhaps directions for getting there). Such a map might be different, depending on where the person is currently at. In a good system, all of these special warnings and instructions could be sent with just a single alert."}

It is a type of cat-like mammal in the suborder Feliformia.\nThey lived in North America, Europe, and Asia from the Eocene through the Miocene epochs, 42\u201320 million years ago (mya). They lasted for about 22 million years.\nAlthough some nimravids physically resembled the sabre-toothed cats of genus \"Smilodon\", they were not closely related, but evolved a similar form through parallel evolution.\nThe ancestors of nimravids and felids diverged from their common ancestor about 50 mya. Most had muscular, low-slung, catlike bodies, but with shorter legs and tails.\nTeeth.\nSome nimravids did evolve into large toothed cat-like forms with massive flattened upper canines and mandibular flanges. Others had teeth similar to modern cats, with smaller canines. Some had canines more intermediate relationship between the saber-toothed cats and felids. These differences must have reflected different methods of attacking their prey.\nNot only did nimravids have varied tooth styles, but they also showed the same range of size size and shape as felids. Some were leopard-sized, others the size of today's lions and tigers, and one had the short face, rounded skull and smaller canines of the modern cheetah."}

It is native to a large variation of tropic and subtropic areas of Southern and Southeast Asia. Until 2009 they were considered a subspecies of \"Python molurus\". Now they are recognized as a distinct species.\nBurmese pythons are dark-coloured snakes with many brown blotches, edged with black, down their back. It can grow up to 5 to 7 metres (16 to 23\u00a0ft) long, but some may only reach up to the length of 4 metres (13 feet). They usually weigh around 90\u00a0kg. The longest Burmese python ever recored was a female named \"Baby\" which lived in the Serpent Safari, Gurnee, Illinois and was 27 years old when she died. When \"Baby\" died she was 8.23 metres (27\u00a0ft) long, and weighed 183\u00a0kg\nThe Burmese python is found throughout Southern and Southeast Asia including Eastern India, Nepal, Western Bhutan, Southeast Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Northern Malaysia, far southern China, Indonesia, Southern Sulawesi, Bali and Sumbawa. It lives in grasslands, marshes, swamps, woodlands, river valleys, and jungles with open clearings.\nThe Burmese python, like all types of snakes, are carnivorous. They mainly eat birds and mammals like mice, rats, rabbits, pigs and goats. Some have been seen eating larger animals like alligators and deer.\nBurmese Pythons are mainly nocturnal. Young Burmese Pythons usually live in trees and on ground but when they become older they live mainly on the ground. They are excellent swimmers and can stay underwater for around half an hour.\nBurmese pythons breed in the early spring and females lay around 12-36 eggs in March or April. The female python then remains with the eggs until they have hatched. Once the hatchlings use their egg tooth to cut their way out of the eggs the mother then leaves. The babies often stay inside the eggs until they have completed their first shedding of their skin, after this they leave to hunt for their first meal. Burmese pythons live for around 20 to 27 years."}

The monastery of La Trappe in Soligny had its own brewery in 1685. Breweries were later added in monasteries of other countries as the trappist order spread from France into the rest of Europe. The Trappists, like many other religious people, first brewed beer to feed the community. Now, Trappist breweries also brew beer to pay for their works and for good causes. Many of the Trappist monasteries and breweries were destroyed during the French Revolution and the World Wars. \nTypes of beer.\nWith the recent exception of Koningshoeven's Bockbier, Trappist beers are all top-fermented and mainly bottle conditioned. Trappist breweries use different names for the different beers produced. The names relate to their strength.\nThe best known is the system where different beers are called \"Enkel/Single\", \"Dubbel/Double\" and \"Tripel/Triple\". With the importance of the Holy Trinity in the church, it is unlikely that the choice of three types of beers was accidental. Enkels are now no longer brewed as such.\nColours can be used to tell the different types. This dates back to the days when bottles were unlabelled and had to be identified by the bottle-top alone. Chimay beer labels are based on the colour system (in increasing order of strength red, white and blue). Westvleteren beers are still unlabelled.\nThere is also a number system (6,8 and 10, as used by Rochefort), which gives an idea of strength. Achel combine a strength and a colour (of the beer itselfblond or brown).\nBeers.\nThe official Trappist breweries make the following beers:-\nGlassware.\nBelgian breweries have a tradition of providing custom beer glasses. The Trappist breweries often provide \"chalice\" or \"goblet\" style glasses. "}
{"id": "352871", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=352871", "title": "Westvleteren Brewery", "text": "The Westvleteren Brewery (Brouwerij Westvleteren) is a Belgian brewery. It was formed in 1838 inside the Trappist Abbey of Saint Sixtus of Westvleteren in the Belgian municipality of Vleteren. The brewery and its beers are usually called \"Westvleteren\". The brewery's three beers have an international reputation for taste and quality. They also have a limited availability.\nIn 1931, the abbey began selling beer to the general public. Before, they only served beer to guests and visitors.\nIt is the only Trappist brewery where the monks still do all of the brewing. Of the 26 Cistercians who live in the abbey, five monks run the brewery, with an additional five who assist during bottling (putting the beer in bottles).\nCommercial orientations.\nAs with all other Trappist breweries, the beer is only sold in order to financially support the monastery and other good causes. There is no advertising except for a small sign outside the abbey. The monks have repeatedly said that they only brew enough beer to run the monastery. They will make no more than they need to sell, regardless of demand. During World War II, the brewery stopped supplying wholesalers. Since then they only sell to individual buyers in person at the brewery or the visitor's centre. \nBeers.\nThe brewery currently brews three beers:\nUntil 1999, the brewery also made a 6.2% ABV dark beer and a lighter 4\u00b0 which was the monks' table beer. The 8 and 12 are bottle conditioned. They have a long shelf life. Some drinkers prefer the taste when the beers have been stored for several years. The ingredients are yeast, hops, malt, sugar, caramel and water.\nThe bottles have been sold without labels since 1945. All of the legally required information is printed on the crown tops. Because of this lack of space, Westvleteren beers are the only Trappist beers that do not have the official Trappist logo on the bottle. The logo is only printed on the wooden crates. \nInternational reputation.\nMany beer drinkers rank Westvleteren 12 among their favourite beers. The 8 and the Blonde also rank highly on beer-rating websites.\nDespite the popularity, the monks have continued to decline almost all interview. Non-monastic visitors to the abbey are usually turned away."}

It lives in eastern United States of America. There are no subspecies currently recognized. It is the 2nd largest venomous snake found in the eastern United States.\nDescription.\nAdults usually grow up to the length of 91\u2013152\u00a0cm (35.8-59.8\u00a0in). The longest to be reported was 189.2\u00a0cm (74.5\u00a0in) long. The large timber rattlesnakes weigh about 4.5\u00a0kg (9.9 Ib), but most weigh about 580-900 g (20-32\u00a0oz). Their scales are usually yellowish-brown or gray with dark brown or black stripes.\nWhere they live.\nThey are found in woodlands and forests of eastern United States of America, from southern Minnesota and southern New Hampshire, south to east Texas and north Florida. During the summer pregnant females prefer open, rocky ledges, where the temperature is higher, while males and non-pregnant females spend more time in cooler woodlands with a closed forest canopy. Females usually bask in the sun before having babies in open rocky areas, known as \"basking knolls\". In the winter Timber Rattlesnakes hibernate in dens and caves.\nFeeding.\nThey mainly eat small mammals but they also eat birds, frogs, and other snakes like rattlesnakes. The most common snake they eat is the garter snake.\nVenom.\nThe timber rattlesnake is one of North America's most dangerous snakes. Before biting, they usually warn people by shaking their rattle at the end of their tail.\nIts venom contains a neurotoxin known as canebrake toxin, and is a phospholipase A2. It also contains a small basic peptide that works as a myotoxin, a fibrinogen-clotting enzyme that can produce defibrination syndrome, and a bradykinin-releasing enzyme.\nCroFab antivenom is used to treat envenomations from the timber rattlesnake.\nConservation status.\nThe timber rattlesnake is classified as least concern on the IUCN Red List.\nThe timber rattlesnake is endangered in New Jersey, Vermont, Massachusetts, Virginia, New Hampshire, Indiana, and Ohio. It is threatened in New York, Connecticut, Illinois, Minnesota, and Texas.\nTimber rattlesnakes are extinct in Maine and Rhode Island. Only one population remains in New Hampshire. They are protected in many of the Appalachian states but their populations are still declining."}
