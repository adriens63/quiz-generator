They offer the prospect of oil price moderation. Some biofuels can supply sustainable energy. Responsible development of biofuels will help economic prospects in Africa, Latin America and Asia.\nBiofuel options.\nThere are many biofuel options which are available. Biofuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel, are currently produced from the products of conventional food crops such as the starch, sugar and oil feedstocks from crops that include wheat, maize, sugar cane, palm oil and oilseed rape. Any major switch to biofuels from such crops would create a direct competition with their use for food and animal feed, and in some parts of the world we are already seeing the economic consequences of such competition.\nSecond generation biofuels are now being produced from the cellulose in dedicated energy crops (perennial grasses such as switchgrass and Miscanthus giganteus), forestry materials, the co-products from food production, and domestic vegetable waste. Advances in the conversion processes will improve the sustainability of biofuels, through better efficiencies and reduced environmental impact of producing biofuels, from both existing food crops and from cellulosic sources.\nLord Ron Oxburgh suggests that responsible production of biofuels has several trade-offs:\nProduced responsibly they are a sustainable energy source that need not divert any land from growing food nor damage the environment; they can also help solve the problems of the waste generated by Western society; and they can create jobs for the poor where previously were none. Produced irresponsibly, they at best offer no climate benefit and, at worst, have detrimental social and environmental consequences. In other words, biofuels are pretty much like any other product. \nAccording to the Rocky Mountain Institute, sound biofuel production practices would not hamper food and fibre production, nor cause water or environmental problems, and would enhance soil fertility. The selection of land on which to grow the feedstocks is a critical component of the ability of biofuels to deliver sustainable solutions. A key consideration is the minimization of biofuel competition for prime cropland.\nPlants used as sustainable biofuel.\nJatropha in India and Africa.\nCrops like Jatropha, used for biodiesel, can thrive on marginal agricultural land where many trees and crops will not grow, or would produce only slow growth yields. Jatropha cultivation provides benefits for local communities: \nCultivation and fruit picking by hand is labour-intensive and needs around one person per hectare. In parts of rural India and Africa this provides much-needed jobs - about 200,000 people worldwide now find employment through jatropha. Moreover, villagers often find that they can grow other crops in the shade of the trees. Their communities will avoid importing expensive diesel and there will be some for export too. \nJatropha in Cambodia.\nCambodia has no proven fossil fuel reserves, and is almost completely dependent on imported diesel fuel for electricity production. Consequently, Cambodians face an insecure supply and pay some of the highest energy prices in the world. The impacts of this are widespread and may hinder economic development.\nBiofuels may provide a substitute for diesel fuel that can be manufactured locally for a lower price, independent of the international oil price. The local production and use of biofuel also offers other benefits such as improved energy security, rural development opportunities and environmental benefits. The Jatropha curcas species appears to be a particularly suitable source of biofuel as it already grows commonly in Cambodia. Local sustainable production of biofuel in Cambodia, based on the Jatropha or other sources, offers good potential benefits for the investors, the economy, rural communities and the environment.\nSweet sorghum in India.\nSweet sorghum overcomes many of the shortcomings of other biofuel crops. With sweet sorghum, only the stalks are used for biofuel production, while the grain is saved for food or livestock feed. It is not in high demand in the global food market, and thus has little impact on food prices and food security. Sweet sorghum is grown on already-farmed drylands that are low in carbon storage capacity, so concerns about the clearing of rainforest do not apply. Sweet sorghum is easier and cheaper to grow than other biofuel crops in India and does not require irrigation, an important consideration in dry areas.\nInternational collaboration on sustainable biofuels.\nRoundtable on Sustainable Biofuels.\nPublic attitudes and the actions of stakeholders can play a crucial role in realising the potential of biofuels. Informed discussion and dialogue, based\nboth on the scientific case and an understanding of public and stakeholder views, is important.\nThe Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels is an international initiative which brings together farmers, companies, governments, non-governmental organizations, and scientists who are interested in the sustainability of biofuels production and distribution. During 2008, the Roundtable developed a series of principles and criteria for sustainable biofuels production through meetings, teleconferences, and online discussions.\nThe Roundtable for Sustainable Biofuels released \u201cVersion Zero\u201d of its proposed standards for sustainable biofuels on August 13, 2008. This includes a dozen principles, each with several criteria developing the principle further. \nSustainable Biofuels Consensus.\nThe Sustainable Biofuels Consensus is an international initiative which calls upon governments, the private sector, and other stakeholders to take concerted, collaborative and coordinated action to ensure the sustainable trade, use and production of biofuels. In this way biofuels may play a key role in the transformation of the energy sector, climate stabilization and resulting worldwide renaissance of rural areas, all of which are urgently needed.\nThe Sustainable Biofuels Consensus envisions a landscape that provides food, fodder, fiber, and energy, which offers opportunities for rural development; that diversifies energy supply, restores ecosystems, protects biodiversity, and sequesters carbon.\nOil price moderation.\nBiofuels offer the prospect of real market competition and oil price moderation. According to the Wall Street Journal, crude oil would be trading 15 per cent higher and gasoline would be as much as 25 per cent more expensive, if it were not for biofuels. A healthy supply of alternative energy sources will help to combat gasoline price spikes.\nSustainable transport.\nBiofuels have a limited ability to replace fossil fuels and should not be regarded as a \u2018silver bullet\u2019 to deal with transport emissions. Biofuels on their own cannot deliver a sustainable transport system and so must be developed as part of an integrated approach,\nwhich promotes other renewable energy options and energy efficiency, as well as moderating the overall demand and need for transport. The development of hybrid and fuel cell vehicles, public transport, and better urban and rural planning all need to be considered."}

The screwjob occurred in a match for the WWF Championship at \"Survivor Series\" in 1997 in Montreal, Quebec. The screwjob happened when Hart's opponent, Shawn Michaels, applied Hart's own finishing move, the Sharp Shooter and then WWF Referee Earl Hebner called for the bell under Vince McMahon's order even though Hart had not submitted (or tapped-out). As a result, Michaels became the WWF Champion. McMahon was the one who started the plans for the screwjob when Hart announced he was leaving the WWF for the companies then biggest competitor, World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and refused to lose the title in front of his fellow Canadians to Michaels. The original, scripted plan was for Hart to win at Survivor Series and surrender the title the next night on \"Raw\". McMahon felt he did not need another \"Alundra Blayze incident\" so he instituted the screwjob. On the January 4, 2010 episode of Raw, he reconciled with Michaels by shaking his hand and hugging in the ring."}

Although geographically in the central part of the state, usually the west central coast, including Hillsborough, Pinellas, Pasco, and Hernando counties, is considered the Tampa Bay area or the Suncoast, rather than a part of Central Florida. This area is known as the I-4 corridor.\nIn 2007, the guessed total population of the Central Florida area was just over 3.8 million people. Central Florida is a mix of deep south and typical Floridian culture. This is what makes the area unique.\nThe largest cities in Central Florida are Orlando, Palm Bay, Lakeland, Melbourne, Deltona, Daytona Beach, Kissimmee, Altamonte Springs and Sanford. \nThe region has grown over the last two decades. A lack of growth management has led to massive urban sprawl in the area. Outdated and unplanned building has led to an overload of vehicle traffic.

It has a population of 90,000 and is growing very fast. It is just west of the Greenbelt. It is an important area for Hi-tech Businesses. It was an independent town from 1978 to 2000. \nHistory.\nKanata was originally part of the Township of March. It was settled by Europeans in the early 19th Century. It was mainly agricultural(Farms) until the 1960s when it became the site of a lot of construction. Modern Kanata is largely the creation of Bill Teron, a developer and urban planner who purchased over 3,000 acres (12 km2) of rural land and set about building a model community. It was planned to have a mix of offices, residential(Housing) area, and green area. Kanata was divided into a number of communities. Each was intended to have its own Business Center and unique culture. These include Beaverbrook, Glen Cairn, Bridlewood, Katimavik, Hazeldean, Morgan's Grant, and Kanata Lakes.\nKanata grew Rapidly. In 1978 the Province of Ontario made Kanata a city separate from the Township of March. Kanata remained a city intil 2001 when it was merged with the city of Ottawa, along with many other cities.\nThe city became an important hi-tech centre. DEC was one of the pioneer technology companies in Kanata. The DEC campus has been successively Digital, Compaq, and is now HP. Kanata remains home to many of the major hi-tech employers of Ottawa, such as Mitel, March Networks, Alcatel-Lucent, Dell Canada, Hewlett-Packard, Smart Technologies, Norpak, Nortel, MDS Nordion, Breconridge, AMCC, and Cisco Systems, Inc.. The hi-tech industry is clustered along March Road, in the Kanata North Business Park and Kanata Research Park, and along Eagleson Road, in the Kanata South Business Park.\nLocation.\nKanata is in the Ottawa Valley. It is about 22 km southwest of Downtown Ottawa. It is along the Highway 417. The northern end of Kanata is west of the Ottawa River.\nTo the east, Kanata is separated from the former City of Nepean by the National Capital Commission's Greenbelt (Ottawa). The community of Bells Corners borders the inner side of the Greenbelt. Bells Corners is, like Kanata, a hi-tech suburb that was established around 1950.\nTo the west of Kanata is Stittsville, Ontario. Stittsville first a farming community, then a village, then part of the township of Goulbourn. Stittsville is now a large suburb which was merged into the new City of Ottawa in 2001, and is largely employed by the hi-tech industry.\nTo the south of Kanata is the former village of Richmond, Ontario which pre-dated what is now the City of Ottawa.\nSchools.\nMajor schools in Kanata:\nElementary schools\nFrench Catholic Schools:\nCatholic Schools\nFrench Immersion Catholic Schools: \u00c9cole elementaire publique Kanata\nSecondary schools\nPrivate Schools"}

The word incarnate comes from Latin and means \u201cin the flesh\u201d (in=in, carnis=flesh). The incarnation is a basic teaching of Christianity. It is based on the New Testament of the Holy Bible. The incarnation is the belief that Jesus, who is the non-created second person of the triune God; took on a human body and everything that is human and became both man and God. In the Bible its teaching is in the Gospel of John, where in chapter 1 verse 14 (abbreviated as \u201cJohn 1:14\u201d), it says \u201cAnd the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us,\u201d \nTo Clarify, the holy trinity is made up of 3 divine persons'. The Father God, the Son, Jesus and the Holy spirit. The Holy Spirit is described in many situations, but the most commonly known one is the tongues of fire that rest upon Jesus' 12 disciples' heads and it empowers them to speak different languages and preach the good news of Jesus the Christ. His teachings and way of life allow us to find peace and harmony and help others in need. By doing as he taught us, we can become better people and show God's love through us mortal beings.\nIn the Incarnation, normally defined, the divine nature of the Son was joined but not mixed with human nature in one divine Person, Jesus Christ, who was both \"truly God and truly man\". The Incarnation is commemorated and celebrated each year at the Feast of the Incarnation, which is better known as the Annunciation.\nThis is center to the traditional Christian faith held by the Roman Catholic and Eastern Catholic Churches, the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Oriental Orthodox Church, the Anglican Communion, and most Protestants. Other views on the subject have been considered in the past, but all were rejected by mainstream Christian bodies. \nIn recent past, another doctrine known as \"Oneness\" has gained credit amongst Pentecostal groups (see below), but has been rejected by other Christians."}

It took place at sunrise, on December 3, 1854. The miners came from England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Canada, Italy, Hungary, France, Germany, China and Australia. The miners refused to pay a licence fee to look for gold. The miners said that the money for the licence was a tax, and that if they had to pay tax then they should be represented in the parliament. Irish miner Peter Lalor became the leader of the miners. They built a fort, or stockade, on Bakery Hill above the gold diggings on the Eureka gold lead. They were attacked by the British Army. More than 30 people were killed. The battle went for 20 minutes.\nFlag.\nThe miners made their own flag which was flown at the Eureka Stockade. The flag was torn down during the battle and taken away by one of the soldiers. It was given to the Ballarat Art Gallery in the 1890s. Pieces of the flag were sometimes given to important visitors to Ballarat. It is believed that Queen Elizabeth II has a small piece. In the 1973 the flag was restored and put on display at the Art Gallery. The display was opened by the Prime Minister of Australia, Gough Whitlam. The flag has been put on the Victorian Heritage Register and was named an icon by the National Trust in 2006. In August 2010, the Ballarat Art Gallery said that the flag needed further work to keep it safe. It was sent to South Australia to be restored at a cost of more than AU$100,000. The Gallery has built a new airtight case to hold the flag.\nThe symbol.\nThe flag has often been used as a symbol of rebelion. Trade unions used the flag in their marches. The Prime Minister, John Howard, banned the flag from being flown on building sites.\nIn 2008, the Football Federation of Australia tried to stop the flag from being flown by supporters of the soccer team, Melbourne Victory. They said it was against their rules for teams to use political symbols. People with the flag would be made to leave the football ground\nIn 2018, the Eureka flag again divided people in some workplaces. The published examples of slogans and logos that were against the Federal Government's building codes. These images were not allowed to be displayed by workers on projects run by the government. The list of banned images included the Eureka flag.\nMany nationalist groups have started to use the flag as a symbol. It was used during the racial riots at Cronulla, New South Wales.

{"id": "153022", "revid": "17988", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=153022", "title": "Sokka", "text": "Sokka is a fictional character and one of the main characters in Nickelodeon's animated television series \"\". The character was created by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, and voiced by Jack DeSena. In the film version, \"The Last Airbender\", in which is his name is pronounced differently, the character is played by Jackson Rathbone.\nIn the show, 15-year-old Sokka is a warrior of the South Pole's , a race of people who can control water. He, along with his younger sister Katara, discovers an Airbender named Aang, the long-lost Avatar, and accompanies him on his mission to win the Fire Nation and bring peace to the world.\nConcept and creation.\nMichael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko said that Sokka was originally designed to be \"much\" more low-key, but when his comedian voice actor Jack DeSena came in and brought liveliness to his character, they began writing towards that strength. Much of Sokka's dialogue and actions are derived from improvisations and intentional exaggerations on DeSena's part that the writers chose to include within scripts.\nAs a result of his design, Sokka's character has come to serve as a source of comic relief during the series, often a victim of visual slapstick. He also is extremely sarcastic.\nHistory.\nSokka grew up in his village and trains the warriors of his village. Forced to mature quickly when his mother Kya was killed in a Fire Nation raid, he cultivated his warrior skills with a militant zeal, while his sister Katara did chores and practiced waterbending. When Sokka was thirteen, his father and the other village men left to help the Earth Kingdom to fight against the Fire Nation, leaving him and his sister to look after their tribe with their grandmother, Gran Gran. As the oldest male left in the South Pole, Sokka came to assume a semi-leadership role by the time he was sixteen, fiercely protecting the village from any possible outside threats while trying to train children to be a new generation of defenders.\nWhile on an expedition, Katara and Sokka discovered Aang inside an iceberg with Appa. After Katara freed him, Sokka initially believed that the Aang might be a Fire Navy spy, and he eventually grew xenophobic enough to banish him from the village. Upon discovering that Aang was the Avatar, destined to master all four elements and bring peace to the world, Sokka relented, realizing that they had a common enemy in the Fire Nation. He then set off with Katara and Aang on their journey to find a waterbending master at the North Pole, determined to hone his warrior skills by way of fighting Firebenders along the way. Fire Nation general Zhao killed Tui (the moon spirit) causing the moon to turn red and then vanish as during a lunar eclipse, thus preventing the waterbenders from using waterbending. Princess Yue (one of Sokka's love interests, the other being Kyoshi warrior Suki) then becomes the new moon by giving her life energy to the moon spirit, thereby restoring the moon in the sky and the abilities of the waterbenders.\nIn \"Sokka's Master\" (the 4th episode of ) Sokka expresses self-doubt that he is not as useful to the group as his companions. Inspired by his friends' encouragement, he seeks out a master to learn the sword. Rather than fighting with brute force and flawless technique, Sokka's creativity and heterodox approach to things are the cornerstones of his technique, and his master claims that in time Sokka will be a superior swordsman. As he departs, his master gives him a game piece that was previously established as a sign of connection to the secret society known as the Order of the White Lotus.\nIn the two-hour , Sokka and Katara meet with Katara's Waterbending master, Pakku, who has now married their grandmother. In the battle against Ozai, Sokka, his girlfriend Suki, and Toph destroyed a Fire Nation airship and use it to destroy others of its kind while Aang duels with the Phoenix King (Ozai). Sokka and Toph are separated from Suki and attack another airship, but Sokka breaks his leg and strains his arm grabbing hold of Toph, who was falling off the ship. In a compromised position, the pair are attacked by two soldiers, whom Sokka defeats at the cost of his sword and boomerang. As he and Toph are on the edge of the crashing ship, Suki arrives with another airship and saves the two. With the battle over, the trio reunite with Aang and the vanquished Phoenix King. At Zuko's coronation, Suki is reunited with her fellow Kyoshi Warriors, Sokka and Katara are reunited with their father, with the rest of the group reunited with their friends. In the end, Sokka is seen at Iroh's tea shop in Ba Sing Se where everyone teases a painted picture he created of the entire team, wherein he altered some factual details to make the scene more \"memorable\".\nOther media.\nIn the live-action movie The Last Airbender by M. Night Shyamalan, Sokka is played by Jackson Rathbone. His name is pronounced \"So-kah,\" but in the show it's name pronounced \"Sah-kah\". Several important changes to the character's personality were made. In the film he is no longer the comic relief, nor does he exhibit any inventive abilities or usefulness in battle. He rarely shares screen time with Aang, the main hero, or contributes in any way to the plot. M. Night Shyamalan has said in an interview that these decisions were made in order to \"ground\" the character."}

Structural engineers must ensure their designs satisfy building codes.\nMajor structural engineering projects go through the following four stages: \"research\", \"design\", \"testing\", and \"construction\" which are featured with the images below:\nStructural engineering came to existence when the humans first started to construct their own structures. It became a more defined profession with the emergence of the architecture profession during the industrial revolution in the late 19th Century.\nEntry-level structural engineers may design individual structural elements of a structure, for example, beams, columns, and floors of a building. More experienced engineers would be responsible for the structural design and integrity of an entire system, such as a building.\nStructural engineers often specialize in particular fields, such as bridge engineering, building engineering, pipeline engineering, earthquake engineering, industrial structures, or special mechanical structures such as vehicles or aircrafts."}

There is no larger railway interchange in Yorkshire or North East England.\nThe station is one of 17 in Great Britain to be managed by Network Rail. It is the busiest English station outside London, and the UK's second busiest station outside London after Glasgow Central.\nHistory.\nLeeds City Station was built as Leeds New Station, to operate alongside Leeds Central Station (which has since closed). Leeds City Station was rebuilt twice, once in 1963 and again in 2002. Automatic ticket barriers were installed in 2008 replacing manned ticket booths.\nFuture.\nThere are plans to build a entrance to the station from the South side. This would let passengers leave with a short walk to Bridgewater Place and Granary Wharf at the moment they have to walk from the North Side and under the station in a tunnel. As part of High Speed 2 a new station is planned to the south called Leeds New Lane railway station, this will be linked to the current railway station by a bridge. Because of the number of trains now using Leeds railway station new platforms have been proposed.\nDestinations.\nThe railway station has services to London, Sheffield, Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Birmingham, Bristol, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Kingston upon Hull and Scarborough. There are also many local services to Wakefield, Bradford, Huddersfield, Halifax, York, Harrogate and other local towns and cities."}

They live in or near the Arctic, in tundra biomes.\nLife.\nLemmings and voles are the rats and mice of the Arctic. Lemmings have very short tails. They live underground in summer. Because the top soil freezes in the winter, they cannot burrow underground then, so they live under the snow during the colder months. They eat plants and roots. If they find plenty of food, they will have extra large families that year.\nIn a year with plenty of food, millions of lemmings will be roaming the tundra. The owls and foxes have more food than they can eat. They will have extra babies in they years when there are so many lemmings. However, the tundra does not have enough food for millions of lemmings. They rush across the tundra looking for food, and are eaten by predators or starve to death.\nMany lemmings leave to find a new home, when they run out of food and space. Soon, millions of lemmings decide to follow the crowd. They go across the Arctic as a huge mass. Foxes and owls kill many of them. Some drown when trying to swim across rivers. It is often said that they fall off cliffs or even commit mass suicide, but that is an urban legend created by a Disney documentary (\"White Wilderness\", 1958) in which someone actually pushed the lemmings over the edge.\nThe lemmings that are left have enough food and space to survive. Then they start to breed and multiply again."}

It is the county seat of Twin Falls County, Idaho. The 2010 population was 44,125. The estimated population for July 1, 2014 is 46,528.\nHistory.\nIn 1900, I. B. Perrine founded the Twin Falls Land and Water Company to build an irrigation canal in the area now known as Twin Falls. One of the investors was named Stanley Milner. By 1903, Perrine and his investors had government approval to build a dam on the Snake River. The dam was finished in 1905. It is now called Milner Dam. It allows farmers in the area to irrigate their crops.\nIn 1904, some property in the area was sold off to start a few towns. One of those towns was Twin Falls. The others include Buhl, Filer, Hansen, Kimberly, and Murtaugh. Many of those towns were named for the original investors in the Twin Falls land and Water Company.\nTwin Falls was incorporated on April 12, 1905 as a village.\nOn February 21, 1907, Twin Falls became the county seat of the new Twin Falls County. Prior to that, the city was part of Cassia County.\nOn September 8, 1974, Evel Knievel attempted to jump the Snake River Canyon on a rocket cycle at a site close to Twin Falls. The attempt failed. Located on private property at , the ramp's base remains in place as of January, 2016. Evel Knievel was paid six million dollars (US) for trying to jump the canyon. The payment was promised no matter the outcome of the attempt.\nGovernment.\nTwin Falls has a council-manager form of government. The city council hires a manager to supervise city employees on a day-to-day basis, and the position of \"mayor\" is appointed by the city council from among their own members."}

It is found in the region Nord-Pas-de-Calais in the Pas-de-Calais department in the north of France.\nHistory.\nIn the year 700 AD, two Irish princes, Lugli and Luglien, were on a pilgrimage to Rome. On the road between Boulogne and Th\u00e9rouanne, near Ferfay, they were attacked and killed by robbers. Their servants buried the bodies, but they were moved by a storm to the castle of the Bishop of Th\u00e9rouanne. This was seen to be a miracle. When the Normans invaded, the bodies, now holy relics, were moved to a safer place on an island with a marsh all around it. Years later, the sister of the princes, Lilia, came to pray at the chapel built to hold the relics. The town was named Lillers, after her.\nWorld War 1.\nIn World War I, Lillers was the site of a big British military hospital. Nearly 900 soldiers are buried in the cemetery. They include two winners of the Victoria Cross, Corporal William Richard Cotter and Major David Nelson."}

The park is home to two lakes, the Waterloo Lake and the Upper Lake. The Park is also home to Roundhay Mansion, Roundhay Castle and Tropical World.\nHistory.\nRoundhay Park was a private hunting ground in the thirteenth century. Thomas Nicholson bought the park in 1803 and in 1811 had John Clarke redesign it as a private park. At the same time the Roundhay Mansion was built. In 1871, the park was bought by Leeds City Council for use by the public. The decision to buy the park was not a popular one, with many people seeing it as a waste of money because the park was so far away from Leeds City Centre. The city grew though in later years through the industrial revolution and the city's rich residents built houses close to the park.\nLakes.\nWaterloo Lake.\nThe main lake, Waterloo Lake was built by soldiers after their return from the Napoleonic Wars after the Battle of Waterloo. The lake is deep and in area. It was originally used for boating, but now only fishing. In the twentieth century the boat house was made into a cafe. Until 1900 a steamboat called the \"Maid of Athens\" ran on the lake. The dam at the south end was once a waterfall.\nThe Upper Lake.\nThe Upper Lake is the smaller of the two lakes in the park and is set much higher than Waterloo Lake. Roundhay Castle is on the hill between the two lakes. The Upper Lake has a large fountain in the centre.\nConcerts.\nThe park has seen many concerts, including Party at the Park, a Madonna concert and more recently a Robbie Williams concert."}

SNMP is used in network management systems to monitor status of devices and also spot problems. It consists of a set of standards for network management, including an Application Layer protocol, a database schema, and a set of data objects.\nSNMP exposes management data in the form of variables on the managed systems, which describe the system configuration. These variables can then be queried (and sometimes set) by managing applications. It is a standard for managing devices such as routers,switches,servers etc. \nOverview and basic concepts.\nIn common SNMP usage, there are a number of systems to be managed, and one or more systems managing them. A software component called an \"agent\" (see below) runs on each managed system and reports information via SNMP to the managing systems.\nSNMP agents expose management data on the managed systems as variables (such as \"free memory\", \"system name\", \"number of running processes\", \"default route\"). But the protocol also allows active management tasks, such as modifying and applying a new configuration.\nThe managing system can retrieve the information through the GET, GETNEXT and GETBULK protocol operations or the agent will send data without being asked using TRAP or INFORM protocol operations. Management systems can also send configuration updates or controlling requests through the SET protocol operation to actively manage a system. Configuration and control operations are used only when changes are needed to the network. The monitoring operations are usually performed regularly."}

{"id": "155572", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=155572", "title": "Culpeper, Virginia", "text": "Culpeper (formerly Fairfax) is the only incorporated town in Culpeper County, Virginia, United States. The population was 16,379 at the 2010 census. This was an increase from 9,664 at the 2000 census. It is the county seat of Culpeper County.\nGeography.\nCulpeper is located at (38.471915, \u221277.999168).\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 6.8\u00a0square miles (17.5\u00a0km\u00b2), of which 6.7\u00a0square miles (17.4\u00a0km\u00b2) is land and 0.04\u00a0square mile (0.1\u00a0km\u00b2) (0.44%) is water.\nHistory.\nAfter forming Culpeper County, Virginia, in 1748, the Virginia House of Burgesses voted to establish the Town of Fairfax on February 22, 1759. The name honored Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron. He was the proprietor of the Northern Neck, a vast domain north of the Rappahannock River. His territory was then defined as stretching from Chesapeake Bay to what is now Hampshire County, West Virginia.\nThe original plan of the town called for ten blocks, which form the core of Culpeper's downtown area today. The original town was surveyed by a young George Washington. In 1795, the town received a post office under the name \"Culpeper Court House\" Most maps of the time, however, continued to show the Fairfax name. The confusion resulting from the difference in official and postal names was finally resolved when the Virginia Assembly formally renamed the town Culpeper in 1869 (Acts, 1869\u20131870, chapter 118, page 154).\nDuring the American Revolutionary War, the Culpeper Minutemen, a pro-independence militia, formed in the town of Culpeper. They organized in what was then known as \"Clayton's Old Field,\" near today's Yowell Meadow Park.\nDuring the Civil War, Culpeper was a crossroads for a number of armies marching through central Virginia, with both Union and Confederate forces occupying the town by turn. In the heart of downtown, the childhood home of Confederate General A.P. Hill stands at the corner of Main and Davis streets. One block north on Main St. (present location of Piedmont Realty) was the frame house where \"The Gallant Major\" John Pelham died after being wounded at the Battle of Kelly's Ford.\nCulpeper began to grow dramatically in the 1980s, becoming a \"bedroom community\" of more densely populated Northern Virginia and Washington, D.C. suburbs. A growing number of residents of the town and county of Culpeper once lived and continue to work in those areas.\nIn 2011, East Davis Street in downtown Culpeper was named as a 2011 \"America's Great Place\" by the American Planning Association.\n2011 earthquake.\nDowntown Culpeper was one of the communities most affected by the August 23, 2011 Virginia earthquake. Several buildings along Main Street and East Davis Street suffered severe damage, and some have been condemned. The earthquake led to the temporary evacuation of the Packard Campus for Audio-Visual Conservation. At the time it was hosting a town hall event for U.S. Senator Mark Warner. In 2014 the Museum of Culpeper History moved into the town's historic train depot.\nDemographics.\nAs of the 2010 Census, the racial makeup of the town was 61.5% White, 21.9% Black, 0.6% Native American, 2.1% Asian, 0.01% Pacific Islander, and 4.0% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 17.0% of the population.\nThe town's population included 25.7% under the age of 18, 10.0% from 18 to 24, 30.3% from 25 to 44, 19.0% from 45 to 64, and 15.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 35 years. For every 100 females there were 87.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 82.9 males.\nThe median income for a household in the town was at a time $35,438, and the median income for a family was $41,894 but due to the economic downturn this has changed. Males had a median income of $28,658 versus $25,252 for females. The per capita income for the town was $16,842. About 23.0% of families and 26.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 40.8% of those under age 18 and 22.1% of those age 65 or over."}

He came from Pennsylvania in 1732. Stephens would buy some land from Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron. The land was set out in parcels at first. Later, it was made into \"Stephensburgh\" in 1758 by Peter's son Lewis.\nBy the start of the Revolutionary War, \"Stephensburg\" was often called simply \"Newtown\".\nThe town was almost burned by Union forces during the Civil War. This was when Union forces were attacked by Newtown residents. Major Joseph K. Stearns of the 1st New York Cavalry disobeyed an order from a higher ranking General and saved the town.\nThe town was again renamed \"Stephens City\" in 1880. This happened after a row with the United States Postal Service.\nToday, the town is a busy place of throughfare with Interstate 81 and US Route 11. The center of the town is recognized by the National Register of Historic Places."}

These people were \"Yankees.\" They were part of a group of New England farmers who went west into what was then the wilds of the Northwest Territory during the early 1800s. Most of them came because of the Erie Canal. When they came to what is now Bureau County, there was nothing but forest and wild prairie. The New Englanders created farms, built roads, created government buildings and created post routes. Culturally, Bureau County would be very similar with early New England culture for most of its history. During slavery, it was a stop on the Underground Railroad at the home of Owen Lovejoy.\nPrinceton's old nickname was \"The City of Elms\" because there were many elm trees in Princeton during the middle of the 20th century.\nGeography.\nPrinceton is at (41.378481, \u221289.466924).

The population was 1,793 at the 2000 census. People know the city for its historic downtown and the Warsaw Brewery.\nHistory.\nThe city of Warsaw began in 1814. Future president Zachary Taylor founded Fort Johnson on the eastern bank of the Mississippi River across from the mouth of the Des Moines River. Fort Johnson was occupied only for a few weeks before it was burned. In 1815 another military camp, Fort Edwards, was built nearby at a different location. Warsaw became an important fur trading post and one of the earliest European-American settlements in western Illinois.\nDuring the 1840s, Warsaw was one of the centers of opposition to the Mormons at Nauvoo. Thomas C. Sharp, who edited the \"Warsaw Signal\" at this time lead the anti-Mormons. The Mormons tried to set up a settlement at Warren, a site just south of Warsaw. In 1841 Willard Richards moved to Warsaw to oversee the settlement of Warren, but due to the public response to writings by Sharp and other problems, the Mormon settlement was abandoned in 1842. In October 1844, a great gathering was announced in Warsaw. Although it claimed to be a \"wolf hunt,\" people knew that the \"wolves\" to be hunted were the Mormons. When Governor Thomas Ford heard about it, he sent militia troops to disperse the gathering. Most Mormons left the area for Utah in 1846.\nThe city has a well-preserved downtown with a number of remaining historic businesses. Founded by German immigrants, the Warsaw Brewery opened in 1861 and operated for more than 100 years, ending production in 1971. The facility was renovated and reopened in 2006 as a bar and restaurant."}

The number of people living in the town grew from only 491 in 1887 to 7,221 in 1900.\nThe world's largest steel mill was built, but the gas did not last. The mill was taken down and moved without ever producing steel.\nIn 1943 the United States Office of War Information decided Alexandria was the typical American town. It published a book about the town called \"Small Town, U.S.A\".. This was to show what typical American people were like, how they lived, their beliefs and their values. Alexandria celebrates this choice with its annual \"Small Town USA Festival.\""}

It is known as \"Middletown USA\" because many sociological studies were conducted there because it was said to be the typical American city. The population of Muncie in 2011 was 67,430 people.\nMuncie is in Delaware County, about northeast of Indianapolis. The county was named after the Delaware Indians, a native American people, who had moved west from Ohio in the 1770's. They settled along the banks of the White River. One of the settlements was named Muncietown. In 1818 the Delaware signed a treaty with the US Government and moved out of the area to go further west.\nMiddletown.\nSociologists, Robert S. Lynd and his wife, Helen Merrell Lynd, studied Muncie in the 1920s. They wrote two books about life in Muncie called \"Middletown: A study in modern American culture\", and \"Middletown in Transition\". They wanted to study the typical small American city, which of course can not exist. They wanted to see how life in a city had changed from 1890 to 1925. They were going to study a city they way an anthropologist would study a primitive tribe. They decided to look at six parts of living in a city:\nThey chose Muncie because it shared features with many other small cities. The selection was based on the following:\nMuncie was chosen from the 143 cities that met the above descriptions. Since then Muncie has been studied by other sociologists looking at life in America. The Ball State University in Muncie runs the Center for Middletown Studies to continue the research."}

It is the only city in Iowa that is west of the Missouri River. In March 1877, a flood changed the course of the river 1.25\u00a0mi (2\u00a0km) to the southeast. The parts of the old river course, called Saratoga Bend, became an oxbow lake. It is named Carter Lake. After the creation of the lake, the place became a recreational area. It included \"a boathouse at the foot of Locust street, hotels and club houses were numerous and the lake was the scene of many a pleasant rowing and fishing party.\"\nIn 1892, after a lot of litigation between Iowa and Nebraska, the Supreme Court of the United States said that Carter Lake is part of Iowa in \"Nebraska v. Iowa\", 143 U.S. 359 (1892). The general rule is that state borders follow small changes in the course of a river. However, the Court said that an there's an exception when a river avulses one of its bends. In 1972, the Supreme Court made another ruling about Carter Lake when it ruled on a border dispute between the two states in \"Nebraska v. Iowa\", 406 U.S. 117 (1972).\nGeography.\nCarter Lake is at (41.292647, -95.913989).\nThe city is surrounded on three sides by Omaha, Nebraska, and on the fourth by the Missouri River.\nThe United States Census Bureau says that the city has a total area of . Of that, is land and is water.\nPeople.\n2010 census.\nThe 2010 census says that there were 3,785 people, 1,388 households, and 997 families living in Carter Lake.\nPolitics.\nThe current mayor of Carter Lake is Ron Cumberledge.

The (\"A. atropos\", \"A. styx\" and \"A. lachesis\"), and are in the genus Acherontia. The most common usage of the name is for the Europen species.\n\"A. atropos\" are usually in Europe, but \"A. styx\" and \"A. lachesis\" live in Asia. The name comes from skull-shaped pattern of markings on the thorax. All three species are about the same in size, coloration, and life cycle.\nThese moths have many unusual features. All three species can make a loud squeak if irritated. The sound is made by moving air from the pharynx, often along with the flashing of the brightly-colored abdomen in a further attempt to deter predators. All three species raid beehives of different species of honey bee for honey, but \"A. atropos\" only attacks colonies of the well-known western honey bee, \"Apis mellifera\". They are able to move about in hives unhurt because they mimic the scent of the bees.\nDevelopment.\nEggs are laid one by one under old leaves of the hostplant, and are green or grey-blue. None of the three species are forced to use a single family of host plant. Many of the types of plants used are in the families Solanaceae, Verbenaceae, Oleaceae, Bignoniaceae, and others. The larvae are strong, reaching 120-130 mm, with a tail horn that stands out or can be seen easily. All three species have three larval color forms: usually green, brown, or yellow. Larvae do not move much, and will click their mandibles or even bite if threatened. When mature, they burrow underground and excavate a small chamber where they pupate.\nFolklore.\nThis moth was used in the movie \"The Silence of the Lambs\". It was also referenced in \"I'm the King of the Castle.\""}

The top wings are mainly dark brown or black. They are powdered with white. There are many black and dark red stripes. There is a small white spot in the center of each top wing. The bottom wing is yellow or yellow-brown. There are two black lines near the edge of each wing. The head and thorax are dark brown or black. They are the same color as the top wings. On the thorax, there is a dark brown spot that looks like a human skull. This is where the moth gets its name. However, some individuals do not have this spot. The abdomen is blackish-blue. There are is a row of yellow spots on each side of the abdomen.\nRange and distribution.\nIt is found from northern Africa to the Middle East. It can be found as far north as southern Great Britain. It can also be found on the Canary Islands, Madeira, and the Azores.\nFlight period.\n\"A. atropos\" is seen from March to September in its normal range. However, they will sometimes be seen as early as February and as late as October. They have many broods (a brood is a group of offspring) each year.\nBehavior and diet.\n\"A. atropos\" is able to make a loud cry if it is attacked by predators. It can make this sound by pushing air out of its proboscis (the proboscis is the moth's mouth). If this does not scare the predator away, it will quickly flash its abdomen, showing the yellow spots.\n\"A. atropos\" is most active from evening to after midnight. It is attracted to lights. It will feed on the nectar of Potato, Tobacco, Sweet William, and Orange blossoms.\nAt night, \"A. atropos\" will raid beehives. It will only attack Western honey bee beehives. \"A. atropos\" is attacked at the entrance by guard bees. However, \"A atropos\" is immune to the bees' venom. The moth also can mimic the bees' scent. \"A. atropos\" feeds on the honey. It will break through the honeycombs with its sharp proboscis.\nLife cycle.\nEgg.\nFemale \"A. Atropos\" will lay one egg per host plant (the host plant is the plant that the caterpillar feeds on). She will lay them on the underside of the leaves. The egg is green or a gray-blue color. It will turn to a yellowish color just before hatching.\nCaterpillar.\nThe newly hatched caterpillar is yellow-green. It has a very long, black horn on the end of the abdomen. After it sheds its skin, it becomes more green. It has yellow stripes on each side of the body. There are many small white and yellow bumps on the body. After it sheds its skin a second time, the yellow stripes have blue or purple edges on them. The horn is yellow-green with the bottom part being black. After it sheds its skin for a third time, the caterpillar becomes more yellow. There is a row of black spots along each side of the body. The blue or purple edges on the yellow stripes become thicker. After it sheds its skin for the last time, it becomes even more yellow. All of the colors are brighter. There are no longer any bumps on the body. The horn is now yellow. It points downward. The horn has many little bumps on it. It will reach a length of about 13 cm (5.1 in).\nBefore it turns into a chrysalis, the caterpillar will begin to darken. It will also cover itself with saliva. This makes the caterpillar darken even faster. Once this is done, it will look for a good place to pupate (pupate means to turn into a pupa).\nThe caterpillars do not move very much. They will only move to find fresh leaves. If a caterpillar is attacked, it will make sounds with its mandibles. They will also bite very hard if attacked.\nChrysalis.\nThe caterpillar will pupate 15 to 40 cm (5.9 to 15.7 in) deep in the ground. The chrysalis is a shiny brown. It is 7.5 to 8 cm (2.9 to 3.1 in) long. If attacked, the chrysalis can move. The chrysalis hibernates. However, \"A. Atropos\" will sometimes hibernate as a caterpillar. \"A. Atropos\" does not live through the winter in Europe.\nHost plants.\nHere is a list of host plants used by \"A. atropos\":"}

{"id": "156805", "revid": "7770672", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=156805", "title": "Mimicry", "text": "In biology, mimicry is when a species evolves features similar to another. Either one or both are protected when a third species cannot tell them apart. Often, these features are visual; one species looks like another; but similarities of sound, smell and behaviour may also make the fraud seem more real. \nMimicry is related to camouflage, and to warning signals, in which species manipulate or deceive other species which might do them harm. Although mimicry is mainly a defence against predators, sometimes predators also use mimicry, and fool their prey into feeling safe.\nMimicry happens in both animal and plant species. The \"mimic\" is the species which looks like the \"model\". The model may be living, or not. Whole groups of animals go in for mimicry as a life style, such as mantids, leaf insects or stick insects. Camouflage, in which a species looks similar to its surroundings, is a form of visual mimicry.\nThere are far more insect mimics than any other class of animal, but then there are far more insects than other types of animals. Indeed, 75% of all animals which have been described and named, are insects. Many other kinds of animal mimics are known, including fish, plants and even fungi, though less research has been done on these.\nMimicry evolves because the species that are better at mimicking survive to produce more offspring than the species that are worse at mimicking. The genes of the better mimics become more common in the species. Over time, mimic species get closer to their models. This is the process of evolution by natural selection.\nAvoiding detection.\nSince most higher animals have relatively good eyesight, they use it to find what they want. Both herbivores (animals which eat plants), and predators (animals which hunt and eat other animals), use sight to find their food. Prey need to avoid being eaten by predators. Their best chance is to avoid being seen. Usually, they need camouflage. With camouflage, an animal looks like its background, and so is more difficult to see. This is achieved in various ways: \nBehaviour.\nBoth camouflage and mimicry work best when a predator is searching from a distance. When the predator gets close to the prey, and they are sure to be found, some prey switch methods, and flee (run away) or fight back. This behaviour is almost always instinctive. In any event, whether cryptic (hidden) or not, the prey's behaviour must match its mimicry. If it looks like a leaf twisting in the wind, then it has to twist in the wind. Almost all forms of mimicry involve appropriate behaviour to reinforce the visual impression.\nSignalling.\nNot all animals use camouflage because there are situations where it is good to show themselves off. One case is the need to find and keep a mate. Many male animals have some bright colours during the mating season, or change their behaviour and come out into the open. Without this, they might not succeed in mating. Their females, on the other hand, are usually dowdy and camouflaged. This pattern occurs in almost all animals where the male displays and the female chooses. There is at least one good reason the female stays camouflaged. The moment she is fertilized she carries the precious cargo: the eggs that will form part of the next generation. \nWarning colouration.\nAnimals that are dangerous, or foul to eat, usually advertise the fact. This is called warning or \"aposematic colouration\". It is the exact opposite of camouflage. Warning colours are vivid, often some of black, white, red, yellow. \nTests show that warning colours definitely do deter predators.\nSome individual animals will die or receive damage while birds or mammals on the attack learn about the connection between colour and taste. However, if warning costs less than hiding, the animal benefits. And the advertising traits such as colours may serve other functions as well. The patterns may help mate identification within the species, for instance.\nThe fact that some animals are genuinely dangerous or noxious (disgusting) to eat gives the opportunity for mimicry based on warning colouration: M\u00fcllerian and Batesian mimicry.\nM\u00fcllerian mimicry.\nIn M\u00fcllerian mimicry, some species with warning colouration come to look like each other. English naturalist Henry Walter Bates first noticed that some distasteful butterflies resembled one another, which he wrote about in 1862. However, he did not give a good explanation; that was left to German naturalist Fritz M\u00fcller in 1878. M\u00fcller's explanation was simple: \"Both species benefit from a common pattern\". They share the cost of predators learning of their foul taste. Only one learning experience per predator might well be enough to deter it from eating both species. \nThe butterflies Bates, Wallace and M\u00fcller watched and collected were brightly coloured and slow-moving. They often flew in groups which were highly visible. Despite this, they were avoided by birds. This is typical of aposematic (warning) colouration. The colouring of some species from the same area was so perfect that even experienced naturalists could not tell them apart on the wing. \nOnce they were collected, and set out on a board so the details could be seen, it became clear they were not all of the same species, and often not from the same biological families. The similar warning colours of hornets, wasps and some bees is M\u00fcllerian if they live in the same geographical region, so that a predator might, before learning, choose any of them.\nTests show that birds do learn what to eat by sampling when they are young. All aspects of this situation have been the subject of research. Field and experimental work on these ideas continues to this day.\nBatesian mimicry.\nIn Batesian mimicry, the mimic is a \"sheep in wolf's clothing\": it looks like something dangerous or which tastes disgusting, but in reality it is good to eat. As he was exploring the Amazon valley in the 1850s, Bates collected butterflies. He saw how some harmless butterflies looked like other species which were toxic. Birds avoided them, so \"the mimics survived even though they were good food\". This was the first scientific account of mimicry.\nHoverflies often visit flowers to feed on nectar. They are harmless insects which often mimic wasps and bees. They also fly in a slow, erratic fashion, rather like wasps and bees. Often their mimicry is not perfect, and you can easily tell them apart once they have settled. However, even an imperfect mimic might cause a bird to hesitate, and that may save their life.\nBiologists still do research on Batesian and M\u00fcllerian mimicry. They study how the models differ in their foul taste; and what happens when the ratio of mimics to models varies. Quite often, it is only the female which is a mimic; the male carries the normal appearance of its genus. The females need more protection, while the males need to mate. A more subtle reason is that it halves the number of mimics, and so bolsters the effectiveness of the mimicry. Batesian mimicry might damage the warning effect if the frequency of mimics became high, because more young birds would taste them and be encouraged to try again. \"The benefit of warning declines if there are more mimics\". \nThis may explain cases such as \"Papilio dardanus\", an African swallowtail, whose females mimic a number of unpalatable species from the Danaidae: survival is higher when each mimetic form is rare relative to its model. The advantage is probably greater for the females, because males do not show the mimetic patterns; sexual selection probably helps to maintain this difference. These, and other issues, have been researched for many years. \nWith this type of insect the life is split into stages (see complete metamorphosis). The larva is the growth stage, the adult is the reproductive stage. The larvae, too, show camouflage, aposematic colour and mimicry. It is the larvae that pick up the offensive chemicals from the plants they feed on. However, larvae do not show differences between male and female, because reproduction is not their function. \nMimicry rings.\nIn tropical countries, field research has shown that there are large numbers of species involved in mimicry. 54 species of \"Heliconius\" are recognised, with over 700 named colour forms. There are four (or perhaps five) assemblages of butterflies, which include the heliconiines and their mimics. These 'mimicry rings' are called \"tiger\", \"red\", \"blue\" and \"orange\" for short. Members of each ring tend to roost together at night, fly to similar habitats and at the same time of year. Mimicry rings include both M\u00fcllerian and Batesian mimicry.\nVavilovian mimicry.\nVavilovian mimicry occurs in plants where a weed comes to look like a crop plant. It is named after Nikolai Vavilov, a Russian plant breeder who discovered the idea. Before herbicides, weeds were plucked by hand. This has been done for thousands of years. The weeds come to look like the crop because the weeders pick those weeds which look most different. Vavilovian mimicry is caused by unintentional selection by humans. The weeds that survive pass on their genes. Gradually, all the weeds look more like the crop plant.\nAn example is rye, a common Mediterranean species. Rye was originally just a weed growing with wheat and barley. Weeding made it like the crop. Like wheat, it came to have larger seeds and more rigid spindles to which the seeds are attached. Rye is a tougher plant than wheat: it survives in harsher conditions. Having become a crop like the wheat, rye was able to become a crop plant in harsh areas, such as hills and mountains.\nAggressive mimicry.\nThis type of mimicry is quite common. It is the bible metaphor of the \"wolf in sheep's clothing\". The mimicry works to entice a victim, who is then eaten, or otherwise taken advantage of. Angler fish, insectivorous plants and the cuckoo are all examples. All these groups are widespread, and there is no doubt that the aggressive mimicry is a successful life-style.\nThe next two examples introduce another metaphor, that of the \"siren\". The Australian katydid \"Chlorobalius leucoviridis\" can attract male cicadas by imitating the species-specific reply clicks of sexually receptive female cicadas. Playback experiments show that \"C. leucoviridis\" is able to attract males of many cicada species, even though cicada mating signals are species-specific.\nFemale fireflies of the genus \"Photuris\" emit the same light signals that females of other genera use as a mating signal. Further research showed male fireflies from several different genera are attracted to these mimics, and are subsequently captured and eaten. Female signals are based on that received from the male, each female having a repertoire of signals matching the delay and duration of the female of the corresponding species.\nLuring is not a necessary condition however, as the predator may have a significant advantage by not being identified as such. They may resemble a mutualistic symbiont or a species of little relevance to the prey.\nAggressive mimicry may be used by some parasites as a means of getting to their next host. A parasitic trematode (flatworm) lives in the gut of songbirds. Their eggs pass out, and are then eaten by a snail which lives in moist environments. The eggs develop into larvae inside this second host. Unlike related species, these larvae are brightly coloured and able to pulsate. A sac full of spores forces its way into the snail's eye stalks, and pulsates at high speed. This causes the tentacle to enlarge. It also affects the host's behaviour: the snail moves towards light, which it usually avoids. These factors make the sporocysts highly conspicuous, and they are soon eaten by a hungry songbird. The snail then regenerates its eye stalks, and carries on with its life cycle.p134\nCleaner fish are the allies of many other species, which allow them to eat their parasites and dead skin. Some allow the cleaner to go inside their mouth to hunt these parasites. One species of cleaner, the bluestreak cleaner wrasse (\"Labroides dimidiatus\"), shown to the right cleaning a grouper, lives in coral reefs in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. It is recognized by other fish who allow it to clean them. \nIts imposter, the mimetic sabre-toothed blenny (\"Aspidontus taeniatus\"), also lives in the Indian Ocean. It not only looks like the wrasse in terms of size and colour, but even mimics the cleaner's 'dance'. After fooling its prey into letting its guard down, the blenny then bites it, tearing off a piece of its fin before fleeing the scene. Fish attacked in this manner soon learn to distinguish mimic from model, but because the similarity is close they become much more cautious of the model as well. Due to victim's ability to discriminate between foe and helper, the blennies have evolved close similarity, right down to the regional level.\nInside a species.\nA phenomenon sometimes called \"auto-mimicry\" is when the model belongs to the same species as the mimic. An example is the monarch butterfly \"Danaus plexippus\", which feeds on milkweed plants. The butterflies store toxins from the plant, which they maintain even in their adult forms. As the levels of toxin vary depending on diet during the larval stage, some monarchs will be more toxic than others.\nLess palatable individuals can be thought of as mimics of the more dangerous individuals. They carry exactly the same warning colours as the more toxic individuals, but their punishment for predators is weaker. In species where one sex may be more of a threat than the other, if the two sexes look alike one can protect the other. Evidence came from a monkey from Gabon, which regularly ate male moths of the genus \"Anaphe\", but promptly stopped after it tasted a noxious female.\nFalse parts.\nIt is common for small prey animals to make their head less visible. Some also make the least vital part of their body look like a head. This, like the eye-spots on some butterflies, is a deflection technique. A peck or bite on the false head will just be an inconvenience, whereas a peck on the head would be fatal.\nCombined tactics.\nMany animals use more than one type of mimicry. This is seen in butterflies, who usually rest with wings folded upwards. They usually have different patterns on the underside of wings. The underside may be cryptic, while the upper side has some warning pattern. Moths, which rest with wings horizontal, may have different patterns on the rear wings. The rear wings are normally covered by the front wings at rest, but can be revealed if the moth is disturbed. This tactic occurs in moths which are active in daytime or twilight. The scarlet tiger moth uses both camouflage and warning colour according to its situation. It is a fine example of how behaviour and mimicry work together.\nFossil history.\nThe earliest known example of leaf mimicry among insects has been found in the Middle Jurassic of 165 million years ago. The insects are lacewings (Neuroptera), and the leaves are from cycads or related gymnosperms. This is interesting because it shows this type of mimicry evolved long before flowering plants arose."}

He plays for the Scottish Premiership club Rangers and was a regular starter for the Scotland national team until his retirement from international football in 2013. He is a centre forward. He is one of only five players to ever play for both Rangers and Celtic, and one of only two to ever cross the divide twice.\nClub career.\nHibernian.\nKenny started his career at Hibernian, and made his debut in the 1997/98 season. He was loaned to Stenhousemuir where he scored 10 goals in 11 games. He spent four years at the club, and was the Scottish Premier League top scorer in season 1999/00 and received the Scottish Young Player of the Year award in 2000.\nRangers.\nKenny signed for Rangers for \u00a32 million in June 2000. He made his debut in a 4-1 win against FBK Kaunas on 26 July during a Champions League match. His first goal came on 5 August 2000 during an SPL match away to Kilmarnock, scoring the third in a 4-2 win.\nThree months later, Miller netted five goals (a Scottish Premier League record) during a 7-1 home defeat of St. Mirren. More goals against Monaco and Aberdeen meant he had ten goals from just fourteen games. However, until the end of the season, Miller only scored once more, against Brechin City in the Scottish Cup.\nIn September 2001, he went to Wolverhampton Wanderers (Wolves) on a three-month loan, scoring two goals in his first two games. However, during his third match, Miller broke his shoulder in a fall. During the next two months, Wolves and Rangers had talks over his future. Wolves finally bought him on a permanent deal at a cost of \u00a33 million. Miller had made a total of 38 appearances and scored 11 goals for Rangers.\nWolverhampton Wanderers.\nIn 2002/03 Miller was playing most games for Wolves, but he had only managed six goals in 19 games. However, during the final six months of the season he scored 18 goals in his final 24 appearances. He equalled a club record of scoring in six consecutive games. That helped Wolves gain promotion into the English Premier League.\nIn the summer of the 2005/06 season, the newly promoted Premiership team Sunderland wanted to sign Miller, but Wolves rejected their \u00a31m and \u00a31.2m offers and Miller began the new season as a Wolves player. Miller scored 12 goals, and ended the season as top scorer - the third time in Wolves last three seasons. Miller played more than 190 games for Wolves and scored more than 60 goals during his five years with the club.\nCeltic.\nWhen Miller's contract finished at the end of that season, he transferred to Celtic for free under special rules, called the Bosman ruling. He signed an agreement in January after refusing to sign a new deal at Wolves a month earlier. Miller became only the third player since the war to have played for both sides of the Old Firm - following Alfie Conn and Maurice Johnston.\nDespite being praised by many for his overall performances, Miller failed to score in his first nine games for Celtic. He finally scored his first goal, against Old Firm rivals and former employers Rangers at Celtic Park in September 2006. He then went on to score in Celtic's 1\u20130 Champions League win against Copenhagen from the penalty spot and scored two in the 3\u20130 win over Benfica. By scoring in the 2006/07 Champions League season, Miller became the first player to score goals in the Champions League for both Rangers and Celtic. However, he ended the season with only four league goals. He did play in the 2007 Scottish Cup final, before being substituted because of an injury. Despite hints from the player himself that he would leave to get more first-team opportunities, Miller vowed to stay at the club and fight for his place at the club. Miller scored his first goal in his first appearance of the 2007/08 season in a 4\u20131 victory over Falkirk and added to his collection the following week by scoring against Aberdeen. He scored 11 goals in total for the club in 46 appearances.\nDerby County.\nMiller signed a three year deal with newly promoted English Premier League club Derby County on 31 August 2007 for an undisclosed fee, thought to be around \u00a33 million, but later confirmed by Derby County manager Paul Jewell to be closer to \u00a32.25m.\nMiller started well at his new club, scoring in his first two home matches, including the winner on his league debut for the Rams against Newcastle United in a 1\u20130 win on 17 September 2007, a strike which won the club's Goal Of The Season award. However, following this initial success Miller netted just twice in his next 28 league fixtures.\nWith Derby looking like they would be relegated Miller said he would like to move just over 6 months after joining the club - with a return to Rangers his preferred destination, though his manager Jewell insisted any move would have to be financially fair for Derby.\nReturn to Rangers.\nA fee of \u00a32m was agreed between Rangers and Derby allowing Miller to move back to Ibrox. The deal was completed on 13 June. Miller's return to Ibrox means he is one of only a few players to cross the Old Firm divide twice.\nMiller made his second debut for the club on 30 July 2008 in a UEFA Champions League qualifier gainst FBK Kaunas. He scored in the first Old Firm game of the season on 31 August 2008. He followed this up with a further two goals against former employers Hibernian at Easter Road on 28 September 2008, then adding his sixth goal back in a Rangers shirt at Rugby Park in a 4-0 win over Kilmarnock.\nInternational career.\nSince making his Scotland national team debut in 2001, Miller has remained a player in the Scotland team under the management of Berti Vogts, Walter Smith and Alex McLeish.\nHe has scored goals in crucial games against several teams, including Germany and Ukraine. In 2005, Miller scored in three consecutive internationals, with goals against Austria, Italy and Norway.\nClub career statistics.\n148||44||19||8||6||2||14||4||187||58\n200||67||15||7||7||5||colspan=\"2\"|-||222||79\n348||111||34||15||13||7||14||4||409||137\nInternational career statistics.\n!Total||46||11"}
