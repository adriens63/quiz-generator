The \"auto\" (Greek for \"self\") prefix refers to the single coil acting on itself and not to any kind of automatic mechanism. The winding acts as both primary winding and secondary winding in a normal transformer. Since part of the winding does \"double duty\", autotransformers have the advantages of often being smaller, lighter, and cheaper than typical dual-winding transformers. The disadvantage of an autotransformer include not providing electrical isolation between the primary winding and the secondary winding. There is also a higher possibility of short circuits due to low impedance.\nUsage.\nAutotransformers are used in power transmission, power distribution, audio, rail transport, etc. Autotransformers are often used to step up (increase) or step down (decrease) voltages in the 110\u2013120 V range and in the 220\u2013240 V range.\nOther websites.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

The photographs were taken by a prisoner in Auschwitz II-Birkenau. This was Auschwitz's extermination camp - a place where people were sent to be killed in gas chambers. These are some of the only known photos that show what happened around the gas chambers.\nThe photographer was a member of the \"Sonderkommando\", a group of inmates forced to work in and around the gas chambers. He took two photos from inside one of the gas chambers and two from outside. To keep from being caught, he had to aim the camera from his hip and was not able to focus the camera. The Polish resistance (a movement of Polish people fighting against the Nazis) snuck the camera film out of the camp in a toothpaste tube.\nThe photographs were numbered 280\u2013283 by the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum. Numbers 280 and 281 show the cremation of dead bodies in a fire pit. Number 283 just shows trees (since the photographer could not see where he was aiming the camera, he aimed too high for this photo). Number 282 shows a group of naked women just before they went into the gas chamber.\nTaking the photographs.\nNobody knows for sure who took the photographs. Many records say he was called \"Alex,\" and was a Jewish inmate from Greece. \"Alex\" may have been Alberto Errera, an officer from the Greek navy; he was shot and killed after hitting an SS officer. (The SS - \"Schutzstaffel\" - were the Nazi military organization that ran the concentration camps.)\nOther members of the \"Sonderkommando\" in the camp's crematorium helped get and hide the camera Alex used. They were also look-outs (they watched the SS to find the safest time for Alex to take the pictures.)\nOne of these men was Alter Fajnzylberg, who had worked the camp's crematoria since July 1943. He once described how the photos were taken:\n[S]omewhere about midway through 1944, we decided to take pictures secretly to record our work\u00a0... In order to do that, [we needed] to get a good camera and film\u00a0... From the very beginning, several prisoners from our \"Sonderkommando\" were in on my secret: Szlomo Dragon, his brother Josek Dragon, and Alex, a Greek Jew whose surname I do not remember.\nOn the day on which the pictures were taken\u00a0... Some of us were to guard the person taking the pictures. In other words, we were to keep a careful watch for the approach of anyone who did not know the secret, and above all for any SS men moving about in the area. At last the moment came. We all gathered at the western entrance leading from the outside to the gas-chamber of Crematorium V: we could not see any SS men in the watchtower overlooking the door from the barbed wire, nor near the place where the pictures were to be taken. Alex, the Greek Jew, quickly took out his camera, pointed it towards a heap of burning bodies, and pressed the shutter. This is why the photograph shows prisoners from the \"Sonderkommando\" working at the heap. One of the SS was standing beside them, but his back was turned towards the crematorium building. Another picture was taken from the other side of the building, where women and men were undressing among the trees. They [were going] to be murdered in the gas-chamber of Crematorium V.\nThe film was snuck out of the camp by the Polish resistance. It was hidden inside a tube of toothpaste by Helena Dant\u00f3n, who worked in the SS canteen (camp store). Attached to the film was a note dated 4 September 1944, asking that the film be developed right away.\nThe \"Sonderkommando\" photographs were one in many acts of resistance against the Nazis and the war crimes they committed during the Holocaust."}

He was one of the students of Muhammad 'Abduh. He called for social, legal and educational changes and pursued a strong campaign - begun by Muhammad 'Abduh and finished by Mahmoud Shaltout - to include the modern sciences in al-Azhar's curriculum. To that end he organised committees to reform the university's regulations and curriculum and created a supervisory department for research whose responsibilities included publishing and translation.\nMustafa al-Maraghi was the link between the reforms of his mentor Muhammad Abduh and such subsequent leaders of al-Azhar as Mustafa Abd al-Raziq, Abdel-Halim Mahmoud and Mahmoud Shaltout. As a reformer, al-Maraghi believed in Islam's flexibility and ability to adapt to the needs of modernity. He called for the exercise of ijtihad (independent reasoning/interpretation), reinterpretation, and opposed taqlid (imitation or emulation), the blind following of tradition. And he attributed the religious, moral, intellectual, and political decline of Islamic peoples to the adherence to taqlid and the lack of ijtihad. He said that after the first three centuries, ijma' (consensus of the Muslim community or scholars for resolving legal questions) was impossible, because scholars were so scattered in the East and West that usually it was not possible to collect their opinions."}

Major divisions of the agency include the National Forest System, State and Private Forestry, Business Operations, and the Research and Development branch. Managing approximately 25% of federal lands, it is the only major national land agency that is outside the U.S. Department of Interior.\nHistory.\nIn 1876, Congress created the office of Special agent in the Department of Agriculture to find out the quality and conditions of forests in the United States. Franklin B. Hough was appointed the head of the office. In 1881, the office was expanded into the newly formed Division of Forestry. The Forest Reserve Act of 1891 authorized withdrawing land from the public domain as \"forest reserves,\" managed by the Department of the Interior. In 1901, the Division of Forestry was renamed the Bureau of Forestry. The Transfer Act of 1905 transferred the management of forest reserves from the General Land Office of the Interior Department to the Bureau of Forestry. It was from that time on known as the United States Forest Service. Gifford Pinchot was the first United States Chief Forester in the Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt.\nSignificant federal legislation affecting the Forest Service includes the Weeks Act of 1911, the Multiple Use \u2013 Sustained Yield Act of 1960, P.L. 86-517; the Wilderness Act, P.L. 88-577; the National Forest Management Act, P.L. 94-588; the National Environmental Policy Act, P.L. 91-190; the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act, P.L. 95-313; and the Forest and Rangelands Renewable Resources Planning Act, P.L. 95-307.\nIn February 2009, the Government Accountability Office decided whether the Forest Service should be moved from the Department of Agriculture to the Department of the Interior, which already includes the National Park Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Bureau of Land Management, managing some of public land."}

It was also produced as a nameplate for the Dodge Ram from 2005 to 2013, and, most recently, as an individual model marketed by Ram Trucks.\nThe original version was based on Dodge's 3/4 ton WC series of World War II military trucks. The civilian Power Wagon continued the production of four wheel drive trucks from the 1930s. It is a significant predecessor to the many four wheel drive trucks in modern use today.\nHistory (as Dodge Power Wagon).\nAs a version of the Dodge 3/4 ton WC series World War II military trucks, the Power Wagon was introduced in 1946 as the first civilian 4\u00d74. It was meant to compete with military-based Ford/Marmon-Herrington and GMC trucks. The Power Wagon had an enclosed all-weather cab and an 8-foot cargo bed. It had a 126\u00a0inch (3,200\u00a0mm) up to a 147\" wheelbase chassis. The Power Wagon had a 230 cubic inch flathead inline-six engine. It had a two-speed transfer case. It came with a 4-speed manual transmission with a power take off (PTO) which would send power front or rear for operating auxiliary equipment. It had 9.00/16-8 ply tires on 16\u00d76.50\u00a0inch 5-bolt wheels. In 1961 the 230 engine was replaced with the 251 cubic-inch flat head six. \nThe one-ton rated Power Wagon's gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) was 8,700 pounds. Its maximum payload was 3,000 pounds. It was discontinued in 1968 (against the wishes of the United States Forest Service) due to the expense of new safety and emission requirements. But they were exported until 1978.\nSecond generation.\nIn 1967 Dodge released a Power Wagon pickup version better suited for the pickup truck market. It was based on Dodge's pickup truck line. A big-block 383 V8 engines became an option starting in 1967. From 1961 to 1971 the body was called the \"Sweptline\". It then offered a more modern body image from 1972 through 1980 with varied grilles and paint colors. In 1975 the 4-wheel drive became full-time with a 2-speed transfer case. This was changed back to part-time 4-wheel drive in 1980 due to the energy crisis. A huge boost in sales followed the 1974 release of the extended \"Club Cab,\" popular with families and camper towing. The 4-door Crew Cab was far less common and is quite desirable for collectors. Utility and function was unmatched by few competing models, as the towing, payload, and snow plowing capacity of the Power Wagon equipped with \"Dana 60\" 8-lug axles was very popular with road maintenance crews.\nThe Power Wagon was sold through the 1980 model year. A number of engineering and styling improvements were made over the years as the truck grew in size and weight. But the basic truck remained generally constant throughout its life and underwent one last major body change in 1972.\nRAM 2500 Power Wagons.\nFor 2005, Dodge brought back the Power Wagon name on a version of the Dodge Ram 2500. It was a special off-road version of the Ram 2500 with a 5.7L Hemi V8 as the only engine option. The truck interior remain similar to standard production Ram. As of 2010, the Power Wagon was only available as a Crew Cab Short Bed model. As of 2014, the engine was upgraded to a 6.4L Hemi. The 2014 RAM 2500 Power Wagon got coil springs at all four corners. It is available only with the six-speed automatic transmission."}

Off-road vehicles generally have large tires with deep, open treads and a flexible suspension. Off-road vehicles should not be confused with off-highway vehicles. These are not designed to be used on highways and are capable of traveling cross-country over rough land, marsh, swamps, ice or snow.\nMany uses.\nOff-road vehicles have a large following because of their many uses and versatility. Several types of motorsports involve racing off-road vehicles. The three largest \"4-wheel vehicle\" off-road types of competitions are mud racing, desert racing, and rockcrawling. The most common use of these vehicles is for sight seeing in areas distant from paved roads. The use of higher clearance and higher traction vehicles allows access on trails and forest roads that have rough and low traction surfaces.\nRockcrawling.\nRockcrawling is an extreme form of off road driving. Drivers use vehicles anywhere from stock to highly modified to overcome obstacles (usually rocks). In rock crawling, drivers drive highly modified four-wheel drive vehicles such as trucks, Jeeps, and \"buggies\" over very harsh terrain. Driving locations include boulders, mountain foothills, rock piles, mountain trails, etc. Rock crawling is about slow-speed, careful driving. Rock crawlers often drive up, down and across obstacles that would appear impassable. Such vehicles to rock climb are primarily 4x4s.\nRock crawling competitions range from local events to national series. A rock crawling competition consists of obstacle courses that are about 100-200 yards long. Each obstacle is set up with gates, similar to a ski course.\nTread Lightly!\nIn the United States and elsewhere off-road vehicles should be ridden only on roads, trails and areas open to off-road travel. At the request of the United States Forest Service, Tread Lightly! created the \"RIDE ON\" program reminding off-roaders to \u201cRIDE ON Designated Routes\u201d. This was to prevent unregulated motor vehicle travel on public lands. Most US states and other Federal government agencies have similar laws and regulations to safeguard the environment. Tread Lightly!s message of traveling only on existing roads or trails is also designed to prevent social conflicts such as having entire areas closed to off-road travel. "}

Most of his career was spent at the Rockefeller University Hospital in New York City.\nAvery was one of the first molecular biologists and one of the first people to study immunochemistry.\nHe is best known for the experiment (published in 1944 with his co-workers Colin MacLeod and Maclyn McCarty) which proved that DNA is the material from which genes are made.\nThe Nobel laureate Arne Tiselius said that Avery was the most deserving scientist to not receive the Nobel Prize for his work, even though he was nominated for the award several times during the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s.\nBiography.\nOswald Avery was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia. His father was a Baptist minister. In 1887, his father was asked to move to New York City to lead a church. Avery received his A.B. degree in 1900 from Colgate University. He earned an M.D. degree from the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1904. He practiced medicine in New York City until 1907 when he became a researcher at Hoagland Laboratory in Brooklyn, New York. As an adult, Avery had hyperthyroidism (Graves' disease) and he had thyroid surgery in 1934. He was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1936.\nBreakthrough discovery.\nFor many years, genetic information was thought to be in cell protein. Continuing the research done by Frederick Griffith in 1927, Avery worked with MacLeod and McCarty on the mystery of inheritance. He got emeritus status from the Rockefeller Institute in 1943, but continued working for five years, though by that time he was in his late sixties.\nIn this early experiment dead \"Streptococcus pneumoniae\" of the virulent strain type III-S, was injected together with living but non-virulent type II-R pneumococci. This resulted in a deadly infection of type III-S pneumococci.\nAlfred Hershey and Martha Chase took Avery's research further in 1952 with the Hershey\u2013Chase experiment. These experiments paved the way for Watson and Crick's discovery of the helical structure of DNA, and thus the birth of modern genetics and molecular biology. Of this event, Avery wrote in a letter to his youngest brother Roy, a bacteriologist at the Vanderbilt School of Medicine: \"It's lots of fun to blow bubbles but it's wiser to prick them yourself before someone else tries to\".\nNobel laureate Joshua Lederberg stated that Avery and his laboratory provided \"the historical platform of modern DNA research\" and \"betokened the molecular revolution in genetics and biomedical science generally\".\nBibliography.\nThe collected papers of Avery are stored in two locations: the Tennessee State Library and Archives, and the Rockefeller Archive. Many of his papers, poems, and hand written lab-notes are available at the National Library of Medicine in the Oswald T. Avery Collection, the first of their \"Profiles in Science\" series.\nMore reading.\n "}

{"id": "527623", "revid": "507729", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=527623", "title": "Mahmoud Shaltout", "text": "Mahmoud Shaltout or Mahmud Shaltut (1893\u20131963) () was an Egyptian Islamic jurist and scholar. He was a reformer of al-Azhar, a center of Islamic learning in Cairo. He was the highest religious authority in Egypt during the 1960s. He was received his elementary religious education in Alexandria, Egypt. He then spent many years at al-Azhar University in Cairo. There he rose to become rector of the university. Shaltut was a very active writer on the sharia and on tafsir (explaining texts). Some consider him to be the best example of the intellectual and scholarly project of Imam Muhammad Abduh.\nHe was born in a farming village in Lower Egypt. Shaltut distinguished himself as a student at the religious institute of Alexandria and later at al-Azhar. He became an instructor of Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) at al-Azhar in 1927. The following year, the reform-minded Muhammad Mustafa al-Maraghi was appointed shaykh al-Azhar (rector). Shaltut was one of his best supporters. When al-Maraghi was forced out of office the following year, Shaltut continued pressing for reforms. \nShaltut himself took many progressive stands. He wanted translating of the Quran. He was in favor of re-establishing relations with Shia Muslims. He suggested sending Azhari students to Europe for graduate studies. He wanted to admit women. He also wanted to add scientific and technical studies to al-Azhar. Yet he survived as a reformer within al-Azhar. This was unlike such former Azhari modernists as Taha Hussein, Ali Abd al-Raziq, and Mustafa Abd al-Raziq, who ended up on the outside. Out of favor with King Faruq, Shaltut helped deliver Azhari support to Nasser against the Muslim Brothers.\nHis views on Shi'ism.\nIn an effort bring together Sunnis and Shiites worldwide, Shaltut issued a fatwa (religious injunction). It recognized (Twelver) Shiite law as a fifth school alongside the four Sunni schools. He recognized the Ja'fari school of law (called Ithna Ashariyya, or the Twelvers, the largest group in Shia Islam) as one of the five mainstream schools of thought in Islam. This was an important achievement in attempting to unite Muslims around the world. \nThe term \"Ja'fari\" relates to Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq (d. 765). Ja'fari became increasingly used during the twentieth century in the efforts to add Shi'ism as a fifth school of law (madhhab) along with the four established Sunni schools. This led to an interview (and later a fatwa) given by the Shaikh al-Azhar Mahmud Shaltut in 1959. Shaltut went as far as declaring that Muslims are free to attach themselves to any of the five schools.\nThe fatwa of Mahmud Shaltut was published (in 1959) under the title \"Islam: the religion of unity.\" It was introduced by two arguments. The historical argument about mutual respect and tolerance between different legal schools of Sunnis as well as the Shi'i school. The other was an argument about the harmful effects of prejudice between Muslim schools of fiqh. It was argued that the spirit of ijtihad had turned into antagonism and they were no longer having discussions. Shaltut feels that all schools of fiqh should be ready to accept from one another. They should accept any idea which follows Islamic principles and that ensures the welfare of family and society. As a first step the Ja'fari school of fiqh was included in the curriculum of al-'Azhar.\nHis opinion on apostasy.\nShaltut is of the opinion that disbelief in Islam (kufr) is itself not a cause for killing the disbeliever. The apostate should not be killed, since the punishment for apostasy is hellfire and the apostate has no penalty in this world. Mahmud Shaltut believes this based on relevant Qur'anic evidence and concludes that apostasy carries no worldly penalty because it speaks only of punishment in the afterlife."}

Emergency vehicles usually carry distinctive lighting equipment to alert drivers and pedestrians of their rapid movement during an emergency.\nHistory.\nVehicles have had lights for well over a hundred years. Candles lit Horse-drawn carriages. The first cars, then called \"horseless-carriages\" were lit by gas lights. By 1908 electric lighting began to be used on motor vehicles. Red tail lights and yellow brake lights were in use by 1915. Sealed beam headlights were used starting in 1936. By 1940 turn signals were used. Before 1939, headlight design was not standardised. Between 1940 and 1956, all vehicles built in the U.S. were required to have 7\u2019\u2019 round headlights (sealed beams). As of 1956 and up, it became possible to install 4 headlights on 1 vehicle (2 lights per 1 side).

Actually, the spacing of the bases in the B-form of DNA is 0.332\u00a0nm.\nIn 1946 Astbury presented a paper at a symposium in Cambridge in which he said: \"Biosynthesis is supremely a question of fitting molecules or parts of molecules against another... one of the great biological developments of our time is the realisation that probably the most fundamental interaction of all is that between the proteins and the nucleic acids\". He also said that the spacing between the nucleotides and the spacing of amino acids in proteins \"was not an arithmetical accident\".\nAstbury was unable to propose the correct structure of DNA from his data. However in 1952 Linus Pauling used Astbury's insufficient data to propose a structure for DNA, which was also incorrect. Nevertheless Astbury's work encouraged Maurice Wilkins, Raymond Gosling and Rosalind Franklin at Kings College, London. Their X-ray crystallography results were used by Francis Crick and James D. Watson to identify the structure of DNA in 1953."}

For years, Morell treated Hitler with many different drugs. He helped Hitler with almost everything Hitler did. Morell escaped from Hitler's bunker just a few hours before Hitler killed himself there.\nLife before Hitler.\nMorell was born in a small village called Trais-M\u00fcnzenberg, in Upper Hesse, Germany. His family was half Jewish. Morell studied medicine in France. Then he trained in obstetrics and gynecology in Munich, Germany. He became a doctor on 23 May 1913.\nMorell worked as a ship's doctor for a year. Then, in 1914, when Germany was fighting World War I, he volunteered to be a doctor for the German army. He worked as a doctor in a German army battalion until 1917. By 1918, Morell had opened his own doctor's office in Berlin. He became popular for treating his patients' illnesses in unusual ways. Both the Shah of Persia and the King of Romania asked Morell to be their personal doctors, but Morell refused.\nIn 1920, Morell married Hannelore Moller, a rich actress.\nBeing Hitler's doctor.\nMorell joined the Nazi Party when Hitler became the Chancellor (leader) of Germany in 1933. In 1935, Morell treated Hitler's personal photographer, Heinrich Hoffmann. Hoffmann told Hitler that Morell had saved his life. In 1936, Hitler met Morell for the first time. Hitler was having very bad stomach pain, and also had a rash on his leg. Morell was able to cure both problems with medicines. After this, Hitler asked Morell to be his personal doctor. Soon, Hitler decided Morell was a medical genius. Morell became one of Hitler's closest friends. Morell began to treat Hitler with a drug he called \"Vitamultin\" when Hitler felt tired in the morning. Right after he got a shot of Vitamultin, Hitler would feel awake and have a lot of energy. Ernst-G\u00fcnther Schenck, a doctor in the SS, had some Vitamultin tested. It had methamphetamine in it.\nIn 1938, Hitler demanded control of part of Czechoslovakia. While Hitler was meeting with the Czechoslovak president, Emil Hacha, Hitler began yelling at Hacha. Hacha became so scared of Hitler that he fainted. Morell injected stimulant drugs into Hacha to wake him up. Morell said these drugs were only vitamins, but they may have included methamphetamine. Soon after Morell gave him the drugs, Hacha agreed to do what Hitler wanted.\nTreating Hitler with drugs.\nMorell began treating Hitler with more and more drugs. Most were medicines sold in stores, but some were Morell's own mixes. Many of the things Morell gave Hitler are toxic (poisonous). Because of this, some historians think Morell accidentally made Hitler's bad health even worse.\nMorell kept a medical diary of the drugs, vitamins and other chemicals he gave Hitler. The diary lists 74 different drugs, in 28 different mixtures. These drugs include psychoactive drugs like heroin, and things sold as poisons. Some of the other drugs Morell gave Hitler were:\nReputation.\nMany of Hitler's other close friends did not like Morell. For example, Herman G\u00f6ring, the Vice-Chancellor of Germany, called Morell \"Der Reichsspritzenmeister\" (\"Injection Master of the German Reich\") and \"The Master of the Imperial Needle.\" Both nicknames meant the same thing: that Morell used injections (shots of medicine) to fix every problem.\nMorell often argued with Dr. Karl Brandt, who had been Hitler's personal doctor since 1933. Eva Braun, Hitler's girlfriend, called Morell's office a \"pig sty\" and refused to see him.\nPrison and death.\nOn 20 April 1945, during the Battle of Berlin, Hitler was hiding in his bunker in Berlin with Morell and some of his other personal workers. Hitler told Morell and some other workers to fly from Berlin to the Obersalzberg (Hitler's home in the mountains). Morell flew out of Berlin on 23 April.\nMorell was soon caught by the Americans. He was interrogated on 18 May 1945. He was kept in jail in an American prison camp, in the same place that the Nazi concentration camp called Buchenwald used to be. However, he was never charged with a crime.\nMorell died on 26 May 1948, in a hospital in Bavaria, Germany. He was very obese and had many health problems when he died."}

It was then designated as the 1219C2 combat knife. Later it was called the USMC Mark 2 combat knife. When the United States Navy obtained the knife they called it the U.S. Navy utility knife, Mark 2. KA-BAR is the trademark and namesake of a related knife manufacturing company, KA-BAR Knives., Inc. (formerly Union Cutlery Co.) of Olean, New York. KA-BAR Knives is a subsidiary of the Cutco Corporation.\nHistory.\nAt the start of World War II, the US Marine Corps was still using the World War I issue Trench knife. Called the knuckle knife, it was a dagger with a studded steel hand guard. The trench knife was suited for trench warfare but it did not meet the needs of the Marines in the Pacific war. The Marine Corps purchased different designs from different knife manufacturers. The Ka-Bar, however, quickly became the marine's favorite. They were made by the Union Cutlery Company (later changed to KA-BAR Cutlery Inc.). Soon other companies were under contract to produce the Ka-Bar. The main use for the Ka-Bar combat knife was hand-to-hand combat with an enemy. However, the number of enemy soldiers killed with a Ka-Bar is thought to be very small. The knife, weighing just over , had a solid pommel (the butt end of the knife) which could be used as a hammer.The knife was used to open food cans in c-rations or k-rations. It was used for cutting wires, opening crates of ammunition and other non-combat uses. \nModern Ka-Bars.\nAlthough KA-BAR Knives, Inc. currently makes a wide variety of knives and cutlery, it is best known for the Ka-Bar Fighting/Utility knife. It has traditionally used a 7 inch (178\u00a0mm) long blade. It is made of 1095 carbon steel with a clip point blade and a stacked leather-washer handle. Other, more modern versions of this knife feature single or dual-edge blades. Many have synthetic handles made of Kraton (a non-slip rubber substitute). For modern outdoor survival use the Ka-Bar knives are still a proven design."}

This bird breeds from southern Arizona and the lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas in the United States through Central America, South America as far as south as central Argentina and western Peru, and on Trinidad and Tobago. Birds from the northernmost and southern breeding areas migrate to warmer parts of the range after breeding.\nDescription and ecology.\nAn adult tropical kingbird is long and weighs . The head is pale gray, with a darker eye mask (area around its eyes), an orange crown stripe, and a heavy gray bill. The back is grayish-green, and the wing and forked tail are brown. The throat is pale gray, becoming olive-colored on the breast, with the rest of the underparts being yellow. Both male and female are similar, but young birds have pale buff edges on the wing coverts.\nThe call is a high-pitched twittering trill, \"tree-e-e-e-e-e-e\", with a more complex version sung by the male at dawn.\nTheir breeding habitat is semi-open areas with trees and shrubs, including gardens and roadsides. Tropical kingbirds like to view their surroundings from an open perch, usually high in a tree. They take long flights to catch insects in mid-air, which is called hawking. They sometimes hover to pick food off of plants, which is called gleaning. They also eat some fruit.\nThese birds will defend their territory against intruders, even much larger birds such as toucans, caracaras or hawks. \nThey make a flimsy cup nest in a tree. The eggs are cream-colored with reddish-brown marks. The female incubates the typical clutch of two or three eggs for 16 days. After they hatch, it is about 18\u201319 more days until fledging.\nThe tropical kingbird is not considered a threatened species by the IUCN. This is because this bird is very common and they adapt well to changes in their environment."}

He completed the first circumnavigation of the world started by Ferdinand Magellan. After Magellan's death in the Philippines, Elcano took command of the expedition and completed the voyage to Spain. The voyage proved that the Earth was round. When he returned to Spain the king gave Elcano his own Coat of arms. He also received a pension of 500 ducats.\nEarly life.\nElcano was born in 1476 in Getaria, Gipuzkoa in the Basque Country of northern Spain. His parents were Domingo Sebasti\u00e1n de el Cano and Catalina de el Puerto. From his childhood he was a sailor and fisherman. He later smuggled contraband into French ports. He was part of an expedition against Algeria in 1509. In 1519 he was in Seville when Charles V of Spain was sending a major expedition to find a shortcut to the Indies.\nMagellan's voyage.\nCharles V had selected the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan to lead an expedition made up of five ships and 239 men. Their mission was to find a shortcut to the Far East by going around the tip of South America.\nWhen the expedition wintered on the coast of Brazil the crews joined in a mutiny because they did not want to go any further. By this time Magellan and Elcano no longer trusted each other. Magellan blamed Elcano for the mutiny and placed him in chains. One of Magellan's ships was wrecked in Brazil. By the time they reached the passage between the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, afterwards named the Strait of Magellan, one more ship had turned back. Magellan started through the strait in October 1520 taking a month to get through. \nThe three ships reached Guam in March 1521. Later in the month they reached Homonhon Island in the Philippines. By this time they had only 150 men. Magellan formed a friendship with the island's king and soon joined in a war between the king and a rival. On April 27, 1521 Magellan was killed in a battle. The remaining men and ships quickly escaped the Philippines arrived at the Spice Islands in November 1521. By this time Elcano commanded the last ship in the expedition. They left the Spice Islands in December. On September 8, 1522 Elcano and his crew reached Spain completing Magellan's expedition. Elcano was surprised to learn they had lost a day in circumnavigating the globe.\nLater years.\nHe spent about three years at Valladolid. He fell in love with Mar\u00eda Vidaurreta. Together they had a daughter. He joined the expedition of Garcia Jofre de Loa\u00edsa to colonize the Spice Islands. They left with seven ships and 450 men. the expedition was scattered by bad weather near Cape Horn. The expedition lost six of its seven ships. The remaining ship continued to the Spice Islands. On July 30, 1526 Loa\u00edsa died of scurvy. Elcano took command but he died of the disease himself on August 4, 1526. \nTall ship.\nThe Sailing ship \"Juan Sebasti\u00e1n de Elcano\" is named for the explorer. It is a four-masted, topsail schooner, one of the largest in the world. It had sailed around the earth six times by 1986. The ship has participated in three Operation Sail events in New York harbor. It has probably been sailed more than any other major tall ship. Her home port is Cadiz, Spain. The ship is owned by the Spanish Navy.\nReferences.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

The term is used for goods such as:\nLaw of armed conflict.\nIn international law, contraband means goods sent to territories under the control of the enemy that can be used in armed conflict. Traditionally, contraband is classified into two categories, absolute contraband and conditional contraband. Absolute contraband includes arms, munitions, and various materials. These can include chemicals and certain types of machinery that may be used to wage war.\nConditional contraband includes food and livestock feed. Cargo of this kind, while presumably innocent in character, can be seized if the supplies are destined for the armed forces of the enemy. Under conditions of modern warfare almost everything can be called absolute contraband.\nAmerican Civil War.\nDuring the American Civil War, slaves who sought refuge in Union army military camps or who lived in territories that fell under Union control were declared contraband. This policy was first used by General Benjamin F. Butler in 1861, in what came to be known as the \"Fort Monroe Doctrine,\" established in Hampton, Virginia. By war's end, the Union had set up 100 contraband camps in the Southern United States. The Roanoke Island Freedmen's Colony (1863\u20131867) was developed to be a colony. Many adult former slaves worked for wages for the Army at such camps."}

The Kelpie has been exported throughout the world and is used mainly to herd sheep, cattle and goats. \nCharacteristics.\nThe Kelpie can do the work of several men. They are tireless workers and can work all day in the hottest climates. Kelpies are able to travel more than in a single day. Like the Border Collie the Kelpie is an intimidator. It locks eyes with an animal to get it to move. Unlike the Border Collie, the Kelpie also nips at the heels of herd animals to get and keep them moving. \nA typical Kelpie weighs from 25 to 45 pounds. They have a life expectancy of from 10 to 14 years on average. Kelpies have natural oils in their skin that keeps their coat weather resistant. For that reason they should be bathed only when absolutely necessary to avoid drying out their skin. An occasional rubdown with a towel keeps them clean.\nTypes.\nThe breed has been separated into two distinct varieties: the Show (or Bench) Kelpie and the Working Kelpie. The Show Kelpie is seen at conformation dog shows in some countries and is selected for appearance rather than working instinct, while the Working Kelpie is bred for working ability rather than appearance."}

It is usually put together with \"din\" to mean \"renewal of the religion.\" A similar but less common expression is \"ihya' al-din\" (), which may be translated as \"revival of the religion.\"\nThe purpose of the tajdid (renewal or revival) is to implement this ideal model in Muslims' lives, wherever and whenever Muslim society exists. This purpose implies that tajdid is a continuous effort by Muslims always to explain Islam and make it applicable in continually changing situations without violating its principles. \nThe notion of tajdid in the Islamic tradition can be traced back to the Prophet Muhammad, who said that \"At the start of each century there will arise in this ummah (the Muslim community) those who will call for a religious renewal\". Such people (mujaddids, or renewers of Islam), are believed to always come in the time when Muslim community departs from the true path defined by the Qur'an and sunnah (example of the Prophet). The task of the mujaddid, therefore, is to return Muslims to their basic sources (the Qur'an and sunnah), to clean Islam from all un-Godly elements, to present Islam and make it flourish more or less in its original pure form and spirit.\nThe tradition of a renewal of the faith went back to Islam's first century, with the caliph Umar II ('Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz), who came to power in the Muslim year 99 and was particularly revered for his piety, in contrast to his predecessors. He was viewed as a renewer of the faith in an age of increasingly profane rule, and later mujaddids and their movements in various parts of the Islamic world followed his precedent."}

These elements are tiny impurities. This is done to create diodes that make electricity go in one direction, or to make transistors and semiconductor switches.\nWhen the element boron is added to silicon, the boron \"dopant\" is called an \"acceptor\" because it likes accepting electrons. When the element phosphorous is added to silicon, the phosphorous is called a \"donor\" because it does not like electrons.\nThere are two types of doping: (1) n-type(negative type) doping (2) p-type(positive type) doping\n(1) n\u2013type doping: In this, element with five valence electrons are added as impurity(pentavalent impurity or donor impurity) in the semiconductor. Semiconductor has four valence electrons, when it is doped with pentavalent impurity the four valence electron makes covalent bond and the remaining one is now free to move, this is how n-type doping increases conductivity of the semiconductor. Due to excess of electron (e-) in the n-type semiconductor it generates an overall negative charge and thus the name n-type semiconductor.\n(2) p-type doping: In this, element with three valence electron are added as impurity (trivalent impurity or acceptor impurity) in the semiconductor. The three electron in the semiconductor bonds with the three electrons of the dopant. The one electron could not make bond and thus the vacant space where electron should be there is created. This vacant space is know as holes. Electron from another atom jumps in these hole to fill it and a hole is created there, and then the same thing continues. Thus, by this way conductivity is\u00a0 increased in p-type doping.\nThe impurities are added to the silicon through multiple processes, including \"Spin Coating\". A thin layer of phosphorus or boron, usually mixed with a liquid to help it spread out, is spun at high speeds on the silicon. The mixture spreads out the phosphorous or boron, and then is baked. \nAnother process involves a scaled down particle accelerator that smashes atoms of the chosen \"dopant\" into the silicon, which adds the impurity, called \"Ion Implantation\"."}

His mission to Scotland may have been more a case of penance for a battle he may have caused. He refused to return a copy of the Gospels he had copied without permission. He upset the king of Ireland by his refusal, which led to a battle won by his clan. Columba felt remorse over the deaths this caused. Once there he and his monks began the religious conversion of most of Scotland which at that time was pagan. Their fame and influence spread to most of Europe. It became a place of pilgrimage.

They are of two types, xanthophylls (which contain oxygen) and carotenes (which are purely hydrocarbons with no oxygen). \nCarotenoids have two key roles in plants and algae: they absorb light energy for use in photosynthesis, and they protect chlorophyll from photodamage. Beta-carotene is the most common form in plants. \nSome carotenoids (like \u03b2-carotene) have vitamin A activity (so they can convert to retinol). These and other carotenoids can also act as antioxidants. In the eye, certain other carotenoids (lutein, astaxanthin, and zeaxanthin) apparently act directly to absorb damaging blue and near-ultraviolet light. This protects the macula of the retina, the part of the eye with the sharpest vision."}

It describes people who strongly feel they are not the gender they were born with. It used to be called \"gender identity disorder.\" It is a condition accompanied by stress, anxiety, and depression. To be diagnosed with gender dysphoria now, patients must show strong cross-gender feelings that persist over time. It is not just a desire to change sex for some advantage they might think exists. People with Gender Dysphoria are often transgender. They take steps to help their gender dysphoria. A step they could take is to take testosterone or estrogen. Transgender women take estrogen. Transgender men take testosterone. For children, puberty blockers may be taken instead. They can also get surgery. One surgery for transgender men is removal (to get rid of) breasts. This makes the chest flat. The flat chest makes them happy because they look more like a man. Another surgery for both transgender men and transgender women is Genital Reconstruction Surgery. This means they can get a penis or a vulva.\nGender dysphoria may cause many to become alone but not by choice. It often leads to avoiding or dropping out of school. Feminine speech patterns and ways of acting are common in people who were born male with gender dysphoria. Teenagers in particular are at risk of suicide.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) renamed Gender Identity Disorder to Gender Dysphoria in 2019. The DSM-5 renamed it in 2013. \nDiagnosis.\nThe American Psychiatric Association gives a diagnosis of gender dysphoria in teenagers or adults if they feel two or more of these feelings.\nTo be diagnosed, the person must have enough distress about their feelings.\nCauses.\nScientists have theories that gender dysphoria is related to genetic and hormone levels during pregnancy. At the early stages of pregnancy, all babies begin with a female brain structure. Later in pregnancy, male babies have their body and brain masculinized by hormones like testosterone. It is theorised that less or extra testosterone during important times of the pregnancy may be related to gender dysphoria \nA 2020 review of several studies reported that transwomen had female-typical digit ratios (finger lengths on the right hand) while transmen had more male-typical finger lengths. Digit ratio is related to the level of testosterone exposure while a baby is growing during pregnancy. This supports the idea that hormones in the womb are related to gender dysphoria and transgender identity.\nOccurrence.\nDifferent studies find different numbers of people with gender dysphoria. In a New Zealand study, 1.2% of people responded \"yes\" to a question asking if they thought they were transgender. A study in Massachusetts found that 0.5% of adults say they are transgender. "}

However, about 90% of the people killed in the death camps were Jewish. Nazi Germany wanted to 'exterminate' the Jewish people (they wanted to kill all of the Jews, so they would not exist any more). This plan was called the Final Solution. It is now called the Holocaust.\nThe fascist Usta\u0161e government in the Independent State of Croatia also set up death camps during World War II. At death camps like Jasenovac, they murdered many Serbs, Jews, and other people. As many as 750,000 Serbs may have been killed at these death camps.\nBackground.\nThe Nazis believed that some groups of people were better than others. They thought that the Aryan race was the best of all. They believed that people who were not \"Aryan\" were \"inferior\". They also believed that non-Ayrans were the cause of Germany's problems. They thought that some groups of people did not even deserve to live. These groups included people with disabilities. The Nazis called these people \"Lebensunwertes Leben\" - \"life unworthy of life.\"\nIn 1939, the Nazi \"Schutzstaffel\" (SS) started a program to kill everyone who was \"unworthy of life.\" They called this secret program the Action T4 euthanasia program. As part of this program, they killed 70,000 people with disabilities, using carbon monoxide gas. This was the first time the Nazis had used poison gas to kill people.\nTwo years later, the Nazis built the first death camps. Using the things they learned by gassing people with disabilities, the Nazis had decided to start the Final Solution - killing all of the Jewish people, mostly by gassing them. Before the Nazis were ready to kill large numbers of people in gas chambers, the SS \"Einsatzgruppen\" started killing many people at a time by shooting them.\nAt the Wannsee Conference in January 1942, the Nazis made it clear that they planned to kill all the Jews in Europe. Adolf Eichmann was put in charge of this program. After this, the Nazis built more death camps, with the goal of killing millions of Jewish people with poison gas.\nDefinition.\nThe Nazis used death camps and concentration camps for different things. The goal of the death camps was genocide. Their purpose was to kill people who were sent to the camps on trains, thousands at a time. At death camps like Be\u0142\u017cec, Sobib\u00f3r, and Treblinka, people were usually killed within a few hours after they got to the camps.\nConcentration camps were different from death camps. Some of the more infamous concentration camps were Buchenwald, Bergen-Belsen, Dachau, and Ravensbr\u00fcck. These were prison camps which the Nazis set up before World War II started. The Nazis sent people who they did not want in their society to these concentration camps. The Nazis forced millions of people to do forced labor in the concentration camps. Prisoners in concentration camps made up about 25% of the workers in Nazi Germany. Even though the concentration camps were not designed for mass murder, over 75% of the people sent to these camps died because of starvation, illness, exhaustion, executions, and physical abuse.\nHistory.\nIn the early years of World War II, the Jews were mostly sent to concentration camps. However, from 1942 onward, they were mostly deported to the death camps. They were told they were being \"resettled\" - sent to other places to live. The Nazis built many of the death camps in Poland, which the Nazis controlled. They did this because most of the people they wanted to kill lived in Poland. Poland had the most Jewish people in the parts of Europe that the Nazis controlled. Also, since these death camps were not in Germany, the Nazis could hide what they were doing from the German people.\nThe Nazis created two types of death camps. Some were \"pure extermination camps.\" Their only purpose was to kill people. Others were a combination of concentration camps and death camps. At these camps, the Nazis would kill some people right away. They would force others to work as slaves until they died.\nPure extermination camps.\nThe first death camps were Treblinka, Be\u0142\u017cec, and Sobib\u00f3r. They were built during Operation Reinhard (October 1941\u00a0\u2013 November 1943), whose goal was to kill all of Poland's Jews. Trains full of people were sent to these camps, and were murdered as soon as they got there. At first, the camp's guards used carbon monoxide to kill the prisoners. They then buried their bodies in mass graves. Later, when there were too many bodies to bury, they started burning the bodies. So they could kill people and get rid of their bodies more quickly, the Nazis built gas chambers and crematoria in Treblinka and Be\u0142\u017cec. At Be\u0142\u017cec, they also started using Zyklon-B poison gas to kill people.\nOn December 8, 1941, the Nazis opened another death camp called Che\u0142mno. At first, they killed prisoners at Chelmno inside vans, using carbon monoxide exhaust fumes. Later, like at the other death camps, the Nazis built gas chambers so they could kill more people at a time. Almost all of the prisoners sent to Chelmno were killed right away. However, the Nazis forced a few strong men into work units called \"Sonderkommando\". These prisoners were forced to help take dead bodies out of the gas chambers and burn them.\nThe death camps were small (only several hundred meters long and wide). They also had very little housing or other buildings. Because of this, the Nazis were able to trick the prisoners when they arrived. The Nazis told them they would only be staying at the camp for a short time, before continuing to a work camp farther east. This kept the prisoners from panicking or fighting back.\nConcentration and extermination camps.\nAfter they decided to start the \"Final Solution,\" the Nazis built gas chambers and crematoria inside some of the concentration camps that already existed, like Auschwitz and Majdanek.\nWhen people arrived at these camps, they would go through a process called \"selection.\" Nazi guards would choose which prisoners would be kept to work as slaves, and which would be sent right to the gas chambers to be killed. Usually, the Nazis sent elderly people, sick people, and very young children right to the gas chambers. Healthy people were often kept for slave labor, and were forced to work until they were too sick or starved to work as fast as the Nazis wanted. Then the Nazis would \"select\" them for the gas chambers.\nCamps in the Independent State of Croatia.\nWith the support of Nazi Germany and fascist Italy, the Independent State of Croatia (ISC) was created on 10 April 1941. It was ruled by the fascist Usta\u0161e government, which agreed with the Nazis' ideas about race and politics. The Usta\u0161e agreed with the idea that all Jews and Roma people should be killed. They also agreed with the Nazis that socialists and communists were political enemies.\nThe Usta\u0161e built death camps in the Independent State of Croatia and helped with the Nazis' \"Final Solution\" by killing many Jews and Roma. However, their main goal was to kill all of the Serbian people in the ISC. The Usta\u0161e treated the Serbian people so cruelly that even the Germans were shocked.\nThe first Usta\u0161e camp was Jadovno concentration camp. It held thousands of Serbs and Jews from May to August 1941. Prisoners were usually killed by being pushed into deep ravines near the camp.\nThe Jasenovac concentration camp replaced Jadovno. Jasenovac was a very large group of many camps. Many prisoners who arrived at Jasenovac were immediately scheduled to be killed. Strong men who could work, and were sentenced to less than three years in the camp, were allowed to live. However, all prisoners sentenced to three years or more were immediately scheduled for execution.\nSome prisoners at Jasenovac were killed with poison gas or in mass shootings. However, the Usta\u0161e guards killed many prisoners using their hands, or tools like knives and hammers.\nHow prisoners were killed.\nIn 1941, top Nazi official Heinrich Himmler went to see a group of \"Einsatzgruppen\" perform a mass shooting. The group's commanding officer told him that shooting so many people was psychologically harming the soldiers doing the shootings. Himmler decided the Nazis needed to find another way of killing people. After the war, the diary of Auschwitz's Commandant, Rudolf H\u00f6ss, showed that many \"Einsatzkommandos\"\u00a0\u2013 the killers\u00a0\u2013 either went mad or killed themselves. He wrote that they did this because they were psychologically \"unable to endure wading through blood any longer.\"\nThe Nazis had learned from their T-4 program that they could kill people using carbon monoxide. However, they thought sending carbon monoxide to the death camps would be too expensive.\nIn August 1941, H\u00f6ss' deputy, Karl Fritzsch, tested out an idea. At Auschwitz, clothes infected with lice were treated with crystals of prussic acid (hydrogen cyanide). The crystals' brand name was Zyklon-B. They were made to order by the IG Farben chemicals company. Once their container was opened, the Zyklon-B crystals in the air released a deadly cyanide gas. Fritzch thought this gas could be used to kill prisoners. To try out the effects, he locked some Soviet prisoners of war in the basement of a bunker and gassed them. They died.\nGassing with Zyklon-B became Auschwitz's way to exterminate people. It would also be used at Majdanek and other camps. Besides gassing, the camp guards continued to kill prisoners through mass shootings, starvation, torture, and abuse.\nGassings.\nDuring the war, Nazi official Kurt Gerstein told a Swedish diplomat about life in a death camp. On 19 August 1942, Gerstein arrived at Be\u0142\u017cec extermination camp, which had carbon monoxide gas chamber. At the time 45 railroad cars, filled with 6,700 Jews, were being unloaded. Many of the Jews had died on the trip. The rest were marched naked to the gas chambers. There Gerstein said:\nTo keep people from panicking and fighting back, the Nazis told the prisoners they were going to shower and get deloused (get lice removed). Prisoner \"Sonderkommando\" were forced to help in and around the gas chambers. They encouraged the Jews to undress without a hint of what was about to happen. (If the \"Sonderkommando\" warned the prisoners, they too would be killed.) The gas chambers were designed to look like shower rooms (with fake water nozzles, and tile walls). The \"Sonderkommando\" talked to the victims about life in the camp to keep people from getting suspicious. They also helped the elderly and the very young to undress. The \"Sonderkommando\" also comforted older children who might cry \"because of the strangeness of being undressed in this fashion\".\nOnce the gas chamber was full of people and the door was sealed, Nazi guards dropped Zyklon B through special holes in the roof.\nAs part of their training, some high-ranked Nazi Party leaders and SS officers were sent to Auschwitz\u2013Birkenau to watch the gassings. H\u00f6ss reported that \"all were deeply impressed by what they saw ... [but some] ... who had previously spoken most loudly, about the [need] for this extermination, fell silent once they had actually seen the 'final solution of the Jewish problem'.\"\nDestroying corpses.\nAfter the gassings, the \"Sonderkommando\" removed the corpses from the gas chambers, then took gold teeth out of the bodies. At first, the victims were buried in mass graves. Later, victims' bodies were cremated. The ashes were either buried, scattered, or dumped in a nearby river.\nIn his memoir, Auschwitz Commandant H\u00f6ss wrote that the \"Sonderkommando\" had to:\nHess wrote that he was impressed by how hard the \"Sonderkommando\" worked, even though they knew they would also be killed eventually.\nEventually, the Nazis were killing so many people at Auschwitz-Birkenau that they had three buildings with crematoria designed by specialists from Topf und S\u00f6hne. At Auschwitz, prisoners worked every hour of the day to destroy corpses. However, people were being gassed so quickly that not every body could be destroyed in the crematoria. Some corpses were also burned in an open air fire pit.&lt;ref name=\"B/G-199\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nAt Sobib\u00f3r, Treblinka, Be\u0142\u017cec, and Che\u0142mno, the corpses were burned on pyres.\nDeath toll.\nHistorians estimate that the Nazis murdered over three million people in these camps:\nCamps are destroyed.\nWhen they realized they were going to lose World War II, the Nazis tried to destroy the death camps in order to hide the evidence of what they had done. They wanted to hide evidence that so many people had been killed. This meant they needed to destroy the camps, and also hide the corpses of their many victims. The Nazis forced prisoners to destroy the camps and their records, and to dig up mass graves.\nSome extermination camps were liberated (taken over and freed) by Soviet soldiers before the Nazis could destroy evidence of their war crimes. For example, Majdanek was captured nearly intact before the Nazis were able to destroy very much. This happened because the Soviet Red Army got to the camp very quickly, which prevented the SS from destroying most of the camp."}

He is famous as the Gothic leader who sacked the city of Rome in 410 AD. Very little about his family is known. As a young man he received much of his military training in the Roman army. He next appears as a war leader of Gothic forces fighting along with Roman troops at the Battle of the Frigidus in 394. In January 395 the emperor Theodosius I died dividing his empire between his two sons. Alaric revolted and as the leader of the Visigoths he attacked parts of the Eastern Roman Empire. He later attacked the Western Roman Empire. In 408 he attempted to attack Rome but was bribed to leave. He returned two years later, defeated and occupied the city. He died in 411.\nLife.\nAlaric was born on an island on the delta of the Danube River. He was a member of the noble Balti dynasty of Visigoths. He was first mentioned in 394 AD as a commander under the Roman Emperor Theodosius I in his war against Eugenius. He became the leader or king of the Visigoths in the mid 390s. Alaric rebelled against Emperor Arcadius in 395 and invaded Greece. When he came to the walls of Athens, the city paid a heavy ransom so he left them unharmed. He then defeated Corinth, Argos and Sparta. He continued to lay waste to Greece until 397 when the Roman general Stilicho surrounded Alaric's army at Arcadia. They cut off the water to the Gothic camp and thought it was impossible for Alarc to escape. But Alaric broke through their lines and marched to the north over very difficult terrain. Alaric then made a treaty with Arcadius. Stilicho returned to Italy without having defeated Alaric.\nIn 401-402 AD Alaric entered Italy. He tried the same tactics he used earlier but was unsuccessful against the Roman army. At the Battle of Pollentia in 402, the Roman army defeated the goths. Alaric's wife was one of those captured by the Romans. However, the Visigoth losses were very few and Alaric's army left in good order. Alaric crossed the Po River intending on attacking Rome but was met and defeated again by Stilicho at the Battle of Verona. Alaric's army attacked across the Danube and Rhine Rivers again in 405 and 406 AD. Stilicho, who was now ruling in the name of the Emperor Honorius, made a treaty with Alaric. But Stilicho was killed in 408. Alaric invaded Italy again and demanded Stilicho's promises to him be kept.\nFall of Rome.\nFrom late 408 AD, the Visigoth army camped outside Rome. Alaric demanded payment from Honorius, who was safe in Ravenna, which the emperor refused to pay.\nZosimus the historian wrote the only known account of the last negotiations before Rome was sacked:\nOn August 24, 410 AD, Rome's city gates were opened by slaves. Alaric's Visigoths began three days of murdering and plundering. They damaged buildings and stole from tombs of former emperors. It was the first time in 800 years that Rome was sacked. But the Visigoths continued their destruction further south in Italy. The casualties were high on both sides. The Romans lost an estimated 15,000 men while the Visigoths lost about 17,000.\nAlaric planned to move his army into Sicily and then on to Africa. But he died soon after Rome fell in 410 AD. Ataulf succeeded Alaric as king and took the army into Gaul."}

It was created in the United Kingdom, by Maria Dickin, in 1943. At first, the award's goal was to honor the work of animals during World War II. The award is often called \"the animals' Victoria Cross.\"\nMaria Dickin was the creator of the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals (PDSA), a British veterinary charity. She created the award for any animal who showed \"conspicuous gallantry [obvious bravery]\" and devotion to its job while serving with the United Kingdom's armed forces or their allies. The Medal was awarded 54 times between 1943 and 1949 \u2013 to 32 pigeons, 18 dogs, three horses, and one cat.\nThe PDSA started awarding the Dickin Medal again in 2000. In that year, they honored a Newfoundland dog named Gander. The award was given posthumously - after Gander's death. During the Battle of Hong Kong in World War II, Gander had saved the lives of Canadian soldiers.\nIn early 2002, three dogs were awarded the Dickin Medal for their work in responding to the September 11 attacks. The PDSA also awarded the Medal to two dogs serving with the British military in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Iraq. \nIn December 2007, 12 animals who had received the Dickin Medal and were buried at the PDSA Animal Cemetery in Ilford, Essex, were given full military honors. This marked the end of a project to restore the cemetery, which was aided by the United Kingdom's National Lottery.\nThe first recipients of the Medal, in December 1943, were three pigeons. Serving with the Royal Air Force, all three helped make it possible to rescue air crew from ditched planes during the Second World War. The most recent animal to receive the Medal was Diesel, a dog who was killed while serving with the French police during the November 2015 Paris attacks. Diesel's award will be presented in a ceremony in 2016. As of December 2015, the Dickin Medal has been awarded 66 times.\nMedal recipients.\nPigeons.\nThroughout history, homing pigeons have been used to carry messages over long distances. Homing pigeons can find their way home over very long distances. Because of this special ability, homing pigeons have often been used in wars to carry messages. For example, air force flyers could carry homing pigeons in their planes. If a plane started to crash, the airmen could throw the pigeon out of the plane with a message attached to its leg saying where the plane was crashing. The pigeon would find its way back \"home\" - to a military base - where the message would tell the military where to look for their stranded pilots.\nThe United Kingdom used about 250,000 homing pigeons in World War II. Of these, 32 were awarded the Dickin Medal for carrying messages that helped save lives:\nHorses.\nHorses have been used in wars for over 5,000 years. By World War II, they were usually not used in battle. However, they were used for scout units, and also to carry soldiers and supplies.\nCat.\n\"See also: Famous Ship's Cats: Simon\""}

It is also called Spandex or elastane. The name \"spandex\" is an anagram of the word \"expands\".\nLycra was invented in 1958 , United States. It was invented by Joseph Shivers, a chemist. It is made from a combination of polyester and polyurethane.\nBecause of its elasticity and strength, lycra is often used to make clothing. It is commonly mixed with cotton to make things like tights, bras,Lycra shirt,Dr199 and underwear. Lycra is especially common in sports clothing, such as wrestling singlets. It is also often used to make swimsuits and wetsuits, because lycra dries more quickly than many other fabrics.\nTypes of Lycra Fabric\nAside from the varied manufacturing processes that can be used to make this fabric, there are no distinct differences between Lycra, elastane, and spandex. It is, however, important to know more about each term:\nLycra: As a registered trademark of the DuPont corporation, the \"Lycra\" brand is one of the most reliable and high-quality forms of elastane fabric on the market. However, elastane that has been branded as Lycra can sometimes cost more than other types of spandex\nElastane: The term \"elastane\" is most commonly used in Europe, and each continental European language has a slightly different version of this word. Elastane is the most technically correct term used to describe these polyether-polyurea copolymer fabrics.\nSpandex: Despite the persistence of a common misconception, spandex is not a registered trademark of any company. Instead, it is the term that DuPont originally used to describe their polyurethane fabric during the development process. \"Spandex\" is an anagram of \"expands,\" and the attractive simplicity of this name has made it the preferred term for referring to elastane products in the United States and elsewhere.\nWhere Is Lycra Fabric Produced?\nLycra is a trademark of DuPont, and it is only made by this international corporation. DuPont has manufacturing locations in more than 90 countries, which means that this fabric could be made in any number of areas around the world.\nOverall, the international spandex industry has shifted eastward in the last few decades as China has risen to the fore as the dominant manufacturing power in the world. DuPont has a number of factories in China, and many other companies also manufacture spandex in this country.\nThe future of Lycra fabric production around the world looks bright. A ReportBuyer report from 2018 indicates that this fabric will continue to be made in greater and greater quantities until at least 2023, and all signs indicate that this production boom will continue far past this projected date.\now\nDoes Lycra Fabric Impact the Environment\nThe production of Lycra is not considered to be inherently detrimental to the environment. While it's true that the production of elastane fabrics requires high levels of energy and the use of a variety of toxic chemicals, unlike fabrics like nylon, the raw ingredients for Lycra are not derived from non-renewable resources like petroleum oil.\nInstead, these ingredients are fully synthesized in laboratory settings, and DuPont is one of the world's leaders in sustainable and safe elastane manufacturing processes. There's no getting around the fact that the production of Lycra involves carcinogenic chemicals, but scientific research has indicated that elastane factory workers in Sweden exhibit negligibly greater cancer risk, which seems to indicate that workplaces in which this material is made are not very hazardous. No studies have been done, however, to examine the impact of elastane production on workers in other countries."}

He was in charge of Auschwitz concentration camp for about four years.\nDuring World War II, Nazi Germany, led by Adolf Hitler, decided to exterminate (kill all of) the Jewish people in Europe. They called this plan the \"Final Solution\". The Nazis also sent many other people to concentration camps and extermination camps (death camps). As Commandant (commander) at Auschwitz, H\u00f6ss tested and started using different ways of killing these people more quickly. He started using Zyklon B, a pesticide with hydrogen cyanide in it, to kill prisoners in gas chambers. This allowed Nazi soldiers at Auschwitz to murder 2,000 people every hour. At Auschwitz, he created the largest place meant for the constant mass murder of human beings ever known in history.\nH\u00f6ss joined the Nazi Party in 1922, and joined the SS in 1934. From 4 May 1940 to November 1943, and again from 8 May 1944 to 18 January 1945, he was in charge of Auschwitz. Before Nazi Germany lost World War II, more than a million people were murdered at Auschwitz. H\u00f6ss was hanged in 1947 after he was found guilty at a trial in Warsaw, Poland.\nLife.\nH\u00f6ss was born in Baden-Baden, Germany, on 25 November 1900. His parents were Franz Xaver H\u00f6ss and Lina H\u00f6ss. He was the oldest of three children, and was the only son. H\u00f6ss's family was very Catholic.\nIn his autobiography, H\u00f6ss said that he was briefly kidnapped by Gypsies when he was a child.\nH\u00f6ss's father was a former German army officer who had served in German East Africa (a German colony that included what are now Burundi, Rwanda, and part of Tanzania). After leaving the army, he ran a tea and coffee business. He brought up his son based on strict Catholic beliefs, and with military discipline. He had decided that H\u00f6ss would become a Catholic priest. During H\u00f6ss's early childhood, he was constantly being told about sin, guilt, and the need to do penance.\nH\u00f6ss began turning against religion as a young teenager. This happened after he gave a confession to a priest (he told the priest what he had done wrong). In Catholicism, the \"Seal of the Confessional\" is supposed to be unbreakable. This means a priest is never supposed to tell anyone what someone has said in a confession. H\u00f6ss said he started to dislike religion when the priest told H\u00f6ss's father about something H\u00f6ss had said in a confession. Soon after this, H\u00f6ss's father died, and H\u00f6ss began moving toward a military life.\nWhen World War I started, H\u00f6ss served briefly in a military hospital. Then, at age 14, he was allowed to join his father's and grandfather's old regiment, the German Army's 21st Regiment of Dragoons. At age 15, he fought with the Ottoman Sixth Army at Baghdad, at Kut-el-Amara, and in Palestine. While stationed in Turkey, he rose to the rank of \" (sergeant). At age 17, he was the youngest non-commissioned officer in the German Army. While in the Army, he was injured three times and got malaria. He was awarded the Ottoman Empire's Gallipoli Star, the Iron Cross first and second class, and other decorations.\nNazi career.\nAfter Germany surrendered in November 1918, H\u00f6ss finished high school. Soon, he joined the nationalist paramilitary groups that were forming. First, he joined the East Prussian Volunteer Corps. Then he joined the \" in the countries around the Baltic Sea, Silesia, and the Ruhr. H\u00f6ss participated in the armed terror attacks on Polish people during the Silesian Uprisings (when the Polish people tried to break away from German control). He also participated in terror attacks on French nationals during the Occupation of the Ruhr (when the Ruhr valley in Germany was occupied by France and Belgium).\nH\u00f6ss joined the Nazi Party in 1922 after hearing Adolf Hitler's speech in Munich. H\u00f6ss led at least one political assassination, and spent six years in jail for it.\nOn 31 May 1923, in Mecklenburg, Germany, H\u00f6ss and members of the \"Freikorps\" (German volunteer soldiers) beat to death a local schoolteacher named Walther Kadow. They did this because Martin Bormann wanted them to. Bormann later became Hitler's private secretary. Bormann thought that Kadow had told the French occupational government Nazi soldier Albert Leo Schlageter was sabotaging French supply lines. Schlageter was arrested and executed on 26 May 1923. Soon afterward, H\u00f6ss and several accomplices, including Bormann, killed Kadow out of revenge. In 1923, after one of the killers confessed to a local newspaper, H\u00f6ss was arrested and tried as the leader of the murder. H\u00f6ss later said than another man was actually in charge, but at the time, H\u00f6ss accepted the blame as the group's leader. He was convicted and sentenced (on 15 or 17 May 1924). His sentence was for 10 years in Brandenburg Penitentiary (prison). Bormann was sentenced to one year in prison.\nH\u00f6ss was released in July 1928 as part of a general amnesty. He joined the \"\" (\"Artaman League\"), a nationalist \"back-to-the-land\" movement that supported clean, farm living.\nOn 17 August 1929, H\u00f6ss married Hedwig Hensel (3 March 1908 \u2013 1989), whom he met in the Artaman League. Between 1930 and 1943, they had five children: two sons (Klaus and Hans-Rudolf) and three daughters (Ingebrigitt, Heidetraut, and Annegret).\nJoining the SS.\nH\u00f6ss became a member of the SS on 1 April 1934, when Heinrich Himmler encouraged all Nazi men to join the SS. H\u00f6ss joined the \"SS-Totenkopfverb\u00e4nde\" (Death's Head Units) in the same year. He came to admire Himmler so much that he thought whatever Himmler said was \"gospel.\" He even preferred to display Himmler's picture in his office instead of Hitler's.\nH\u00f6ss was assigned to the Dachau concentration camp in December 1934. There, he where he held the post of \"Blockf\u00fchrer\" (\"Block Leader\"), meaning he was in charge of one barracks of prisoners. In 1938, H\u00f6ss was promoted to \"SS-Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer\" (Captain), and was made an assistant to Hermann Baranowski in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp.\nH\u00f6ss joined the Waffen-SS in 1939 after Nazi Germany invaded Poland. H\u00f6ss was good at his job, and his bosses suggested that he should be promoted (given a better job). By the end of his tour of duty there, H\u00f6ss was in charge of prisoners' belongings.\nAuschwitz command.\nOn 1 May 1940, H\u00f6ss was appointed commandant of Auschwitz, which was a combination of concentration camps and an extermination camp. H\u00f6ss commanded the camp for three and a half years. During this time, he changed the original camp into a huge complex (group of camps) called Auschwitz-Birkenau. H\u00f6ss went to Auschwitz determined \"to do things differently\" and develop a more efficient camp than the camps at Dachau and Sachsenhausen where he had worked before. H\u00f6ss lived at Auschwitz in a villa with his wife and five children.\nThe earliest inmates at Auschwitz were Soviet prisoners of war and Polish prisoners, including peasants and intellectuals. About 700 of these prisoners arrived at Auschwitz in June 1940; the Nazi guards told them they would not survive more than 3 months.\nAt its largest, Auschwitz included three major camps:\nThere were also many smaller \"sub-camps\" nearby. The Auschwitz complex was built on about 8,000\u00a0hectares (20,000\u00a0acres) that had been cleared of everyone who lived there.\nIn June 1941, H\u00f6ss met with SS Commander Heinrich Himmler in Berlin. Himmler told H\u00f6ss that Hitler had given the order for the \"Final Solution\" - to kill all of the Jewish people. Himmler had chosen Auschwitz as the place where Europe's Jews would be exterminated. He chose Auschwitz \"[because] of its easy access by rail [train] and also because the extensive site offered space for measures ensuring isolation.\" This meant that Auschwitz was big enough that the genocide of the Jews could be kept secret. Himmler described the project as a \"secret Reich matter.\" H\u00f6ss later said that \"no one was allowed to speak about these matters with any person and that everyone promised upon his life to keep the utmost secrecy.\"\nH\u00f6ss began testing and perfecting mass murder techniques on 3 September 1941. His experiments made Auschwitz the camp that would kill the most prisoners during the Holocaust. H\u00f6ss later said that, during a regular day at Auschwitz, two to three trains carrying 2,000 prisoners each would arrive every day for periods of four to six weeks. The prisoners were unloaded in the Birkenau death camp. Prisoners who were strong, healthy, and able to work were marched to barracks in either Birkenau or one of the other Auschwitz camps. Prisoners who were elderly, very young, sick, or unable to do forced labor were killed in gas chambers, which were disguised as showers. At first, small gassing bunkers were located deep in the woods, to keep them secret. Later, four large gas chambers and crematoria were built in Birkenau to make it easier for the Nazis to kill more people, more quickly.\nH\u00f6ss experimented with different poison gases. At first, he used cotton filters soaked in sulfuric acid. H\u00f6ss later started using hydrogen cyanide (prussic acid), made from the pesticide Zyklon B, after his deputy Karl Fritzsch tested it on a group of Russian prisoners in 1941. H\u00f6ss said that when he used Zyklon B, it took 3\u201315 minutes for prisoners to die, and that \"we knew when the people were dead because they stopped screaming.\"\nAfter Auschwitz.\nOn 10 November 1943, Arthur Liebehenschel became the Commandant at Auschwitz. H\u00f6ss took over Liebehenschel's last job as the chairman of \"Amt D I\"\u00a0in \"Amtsgruppe D\" of the \"SS-Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt\" (WVHA), which ran the concentration camps. H\u00f6ss also was made the deputy (assistant) of Richard Gl\u00fccks, the inspector of all of the concentration camps.\nOn 8 May 1944, H\u00f6ss returned to Auschwitz to supervise operation \"Aktion H\u00f6ss.\" In \"Aktion H\u00f6ss,\" 430,000 Hungarian Jews were sent to Auschwitz and killed in 56 days. Even the huge facility that H\u00f6ss had built could not handle the huge number of victims' corpses. The camp's staff had to burn thousands of bodies in open fire pits.\nCapture, trial, and execution.\nIn the last days of the war, Himmler told H\u00f6ss to disguise himself among German Navy sailors. H\u00f6ss avoided arrest for nearly a year. When he was captured by British soldiers on 11 March 1946 in Gottrupel, he was disguised as a gardener and called himself Franz Lang. His wife, who feared that her son, Klaus, would be shipped off to the Soviet Union to be imprisoned or tortured, had told the British where H\u00f6ss was. The British soldiers that captured H\u00f6ss were led by Hanns Alexander, a young Jewish man from Berlin who was forced to flee to England with his entire family during the rise of Nazi Germany. H\u00f6ss initially denied who he was, until Alexander noticed his wedding ring and demanded to see it. H\u00f6ss refused to remove it, saying it was stuck on his finger. But when Alexander threatened to cut his finger off, H\u00f6ss removed the ring. It had the names \"Rudolf\" and \"Hedwig\" engraved inside. After being questioned and beaten with axe handles by the British soldiers, H\u00f6ss admitted who he really was.\nH\u00f6ss appeared at the Nuremberg Trials on 15 April 1946, where he explained his crimes in detail. Affidavits (sworn statements to the court) that Rudolf H\u00f6ss made while imprisoned in Nuremberg were also used at the Pohl and IG Farben trials.\nIn his affidavit made at Nuremberg on 5 April 1946, H\u00f6ss stated:\nOn 25 May 1946, H\u00f6ss was handed over to Polish authorities, and the Supreme National Tribunal in Poland tried him for murder. His trial lasted from 11 to 29 March 1947. During his trial, when accused of murdering three and a half million people, H\u00f6ss replied, \"No. Only two and one half million\u2014the rest died from disease and starvation.\" H\u00f6ss was sentenced to death by hanging on 2 April 1947. He was executed on 16 April next to the crematorium of the former Auschwitz I concentration camp. He was hanged on a gallows built specifically for his execution, at the location of the camp's \"Gestapo\". Today, a board that marks the site reads:\nH\u00f6ss wrote his autobiography while awaiting execution. It was published in 1956 as \",\" and later as \"Death Dealer: the Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz\" (among other editions).\nAfter discussions with H\u00f6ss during the Nuremberg Trials where H\u00f6ss testified, the American military psychologist Gustave Gilbert wrote:\nFour days before he was executed, H\u00f6ss apologized for his crimes in a message to the state prosecutor:\nShortly before his execution, H\u00f6ss returned to the Catholic Church.

The focus of the games is to use towers to defeat an enemy called Bloons to progress through the game. As you play the game, the Bloons become more difficult to defeat. Players are able to upgrade their towers to help defeat stronger enemies. Bloons can come with power ups, such as camouflage and regeneration. Most of the Tower Defense games can be played on computers and mobile/tablets.\nPricing.\nOn mobile, all of the Bloons Tower Defense Games (except Bloons Monkey City and Bloons TD 3, which are free on the App Store) cost $2.99 to play and download. A free game is also on their website. Some of the Bloons games have lite versions, such as Bloons TD or Bloons TD 4, which are free to play, but have limitations.\nBloons.\nThe enemies of the series are \"Bloons\". (The trademarked word Bloons is a spinoff of the word \"balloons\".) Once the Bloons come, a monkey will have to be placed to pop them. These monkeys pop the bloons. Red Bloons release no \"children\". B.A.Ds also have no \"parents\". Children &amp; parents are terms determining what Bloons release when pop (children) and what Bloon releases that Bloon (parents). For example, the child of a Blue Bloon is a Red Bloon, and the parent of a Blue Bloon is a Green Bloon. A Red Bloon Equivalent (RBE) value is the number of Red Bloons it is equivalent to.\nTowers.\nIn Bloons, there are a lot of towers. All towers can be upgraded four tiers. You can only upgrade one side of the tower to the fourth tier but upgrade the other side to the second tier. As of BTD6, here are the list of towers and camo status:\nPopularity.\nThe Bloons Tower Defense series has been a top seller on the Apple app store. Bloons TD 4 reached No. 6 on Apple's list of top paid iPhone and iPad games in 2010. Bloons TD 5 was able to reach No. 8 on Apple's list of top paid iPhone app downloads in 2013."}

Other games started to be used for tower defense by using tools in the games to change them. Those games were ones like \"Starcraft\" , \"Age of Empires II\" , and \"Warcraft III\" . \nTower defense games were made by independent developers also.

It can be seen with the unaided eye as a third-magnitude star.\nIt has a spectrum similar to the Sun, but is only 78% of the Sun's mass. It is just under 12 light-years from the Solar System, a relatively nearby star. It is the closest solitary G-class star. The star appears stable, and is \"metal-deficient\" because (like the Sun) it is mostly made of hydrogen and helium.\nThere is more than ten times as much dust surrounding Tau Ceti as in the Solar System. There are probably five planets orbiting Tau Ceti, two in the habitable zone. Because of its debris disk, any planet orbiting Tau Ceti would get far more impact events than Earth. Despite this, its Sun-like characteristics have led to widespread interest in the star. Tau Ceti is consistently listed as a target for the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI), and it appears in some science fiction literature.\nSearching.\nProject Ozma searched for intelligent life (SETI) by examining selected stars for artificial radio signals. It was run by the astronomer Frank Drake, who selected Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani as the first targets. Both are near the Solar System and are similar to the Sun. No artificial signals were found after 200 hours of observations. Subsequent radio searches of this star system have also turned up negative.\nPlanets?\nOn December 19, 2012, evidence was presented for a system of five planets orbiting Tau Ceti. The planets' estimated minimum masses are between two and six times the Earth's mass. Their orbital periods range from 14 to 640 days. One of them, Tau Ceti e, appears to orbit about half as far from Tau Ceti as Earth does from the Sun. With Tau Ceti's luminosity of 52% that of the Sun and a distance from the star of 0.552 AU, the planet would receive 1.71 times as much stellar radiation as Earth does. This is slightly less than Venus, which gets 1.91 times Earth's. Some research places it within the star's habitable zone. \nThe habitable zone for a star is where liquid water could be present on an Earth-like planet. For Tau Ceti, this is at a radius of 0.55\u20131.16\u00a0AU, where 1\u00a0AU is the average distance from the Earth to the Sun.\nReferences in Science Fiction.\nThe Expanse (TV): Destination of the Nauvoo, on a 100 year voyage.

{"id": "528670", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=528670", "title": "Nazi eugenics", "text": "Nazi eugenics were a set of beliefs and rules that were very important to Nazi Germany during World War II. These beliefs said that the Aryan race was the master race \u2013 the best race of all \u2013 and all other races were inferior (not as good). There were also many other people who the Nazis believed were \"life unworthy of life,\" like people with disabilities. These ideas about eugenics were at the center of the Nazis' beliefs and eventually helped lead to the Holocaust.\nBecause they did not want these \"inferior\" people in German society, the Nazis decided to get rid of them, using many different strategies. They began with people with disabilities. The Nazis forced more than 400,000 people with disabilities to be sterilized (to have surgery that would make it impossible for them to have children). They also killed over 300,000 people with disabilities in a program called Action T4. In this program, the Nazis sent people with disabilities to places like Hadamar and Hartheim Euthanasia Centres to be killed. These people were killed with lethal injections and poison gas, in vans and gas chambers at the Euthanasia Centres.\nUsing what they learned by killing people with disabilities, the Nazis soon built extermination camps (death camps). The Nazis' goal was to use these death camps to exterminate (kill all of) the Jewish and Roma people in Europe. The Nazis also sent many other people who they thought were inferior to the death camps and to concentration camps, where they were forced to work as slaves.\nGroups targeted by the Nazis.\nThe Nazis' ideas about eugenics said that many different groups of people were \"inferior\" or \"unworthy of life.\" These included:\nRole of the United States.\nThe eugenics movement was very popular in the United States by the time it spread to Germany. California eugenicists began writing things that encouraged eugenics and sterilization, and sent them to German scientists and medical professionals. By 1933, California had forced more people to get sterilized than all of the other U.S. states combined. The Nazis got the idea for their compulsory (forced) sterilization program partly from California's program.\nIn 1927, The Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Anthropology (KWIA) was created in Berlin with a lot of financial support from the American philanthropic group, the Rockefeller Foundation. The KWIA's director was Eugen Fischer, a German professor of medicine, anthropology, and eugenics. Fischer said he had found scientific proof of the Nazis' eugenics ideas, and the Nazis used his work to justify their eugenics policies.\nIn 1934, California eugenics leader C.M. Goethe visited Germany. At that time, more than 5,000 people per month were being forcibly sterilized in Germany. Goethe bragged to a coworker:\n\"You will be interested to know that your work has played a powerful part in shaping the opinions of the group of intellectuals who are behind Hitler in this epoch-making program. Everywhere I sensed that their opinions have been tremendously stimulated by American thought . . . I want you, my dear friend, to carry this thought with you for the rest of your life, that you have really jolted into action a great government of 60 million people.\"\nEugenics researcher Harry H. Laughlin often bragged that his Model Eugenic Sterilization laws had been put into action in Germany's Nuremberg Laws. In 1936, Laughlin was invited to an award ceremony at Heidelberg University in Germany. (The ceremony was scheduled on the anniversary of the day Hitler fired all Jews from the Heidelberg faculty two years earlier.) Laughlin was offered an honorary doctorate for his work on the \"science of racial cleansing.\" Laughlin could not afford to attend, and had to pick his doctorate up from the Rockefeller Institute. Afterwards, he proudly shared the award with his co-workers, remarking that he felt that it showed the \"common understanding of German and American scientists of the nature of eugenics.\"\nHitler's views on Eugenics.\nAdolf Hitler read racial hygiene books while he was in Landsberg Prison. \"Racial hygiene\" was a set of ideas that said that only certain people should be allowed to have children. People who belonged to races that were seen as \"inferior\" would not be allowed to have children. This way, those races would eventually die out.\nHitler believed Germany had become weak, and had been poisoned by \"inferior\" people. He believed these \"inferior\" people were ruining Germany's society, and were the cause of Germany's problems.\nIn his \"Second Book\", which was never published during the Nazi era, Hitler praised the ancient Greek city of Sparta. In Sparta, all newborn infants were examined carefully. Any infant that seemed weak, sick, or had any kind of disability was killed. Only the healthy, strong children were allowed to live. This meant that they were the only people alive to have children and continue the Spartan race. Hitler praised this early model of eugenics:\nThe exposure of the sick, weak, deformed children, in short, their destruction [murder], was more decent and in truth a thousand times more humane than the wretched insanity of our day [in which the most disabled people are allowed to survive], and indeed at any price ... in order subsequently to breed a race of degenerates burdened with illnesses.\"\nBasically, Hitler was saying it was better (and cheaper) to kill people with disabilities than to allow them to live and have children. He thought that if people with disabilities were allowed to have children, their children would also have disabilities. So people with disabilities should be killed to prevent them from \"breeding [creating] a race of\" \"inferior\" people.\nHitler would later apply these same ideas to other people he thought were \"inferior.\" The Holocaust was based on the idea that all of these \"inferior\" people should be killed so they would no longer exist in the Third Reich, Hitler's planned Nazi empire.\nNazi eugenics program.\nIn organizing their eugenics program, the Nazis were inspired by the United States' programs of forced sterilization, and especially the eugenics laws that had been enacted in California.\nOn July 14, 1933, the Nazis passed the Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring. (\"Hereditary diseases\" are genetic disorders which are passed down from parents to children. \"Offspring\" means \"children.\") This law did a few things:\nIn 1934, nearly 4,000 people appealed against court decisions saying they would have to be sterilized. A total of 3,559 of the appeals (89%) failed. By the end of the Nazi regime, the Nazis had created over 200 Hereditary Health Courts (). Based on their rulings, over 400,000 people were forced to be sterilized.\nNazi eugenics institutions.\nThe Nazis made six psychiatric hospitals into \"Euthanasia Centres,\" where people with disabilities (including children) were taken to be killed. These six hospitals were Bernburg, Brandenburg, Grafeneck, Hadamar, Hartheim, and Sonnenstein Euthanasia Centres.\nAt first, the Nazis killed patients in gas vans. The patients would be put into vansand exhaust gas from the vans' engines would be pumped into the vans. The carbon monoxide in the exhaust gas killed the patients. Later, gas chambers were built into the Euthanasia Centres and used pure carbon monoxide gas to kill the patients.\nIdentifying 'genetically sick' people.\nIn July 1934, Nazi Germany passed the Law for Simplification of the Health System. This law set out rules for how the Nazis would decide whether a person was 'genetically sick.' The person would be sent to a Genetic Health Court, which would decide whether the person should be sterilized.\nDoctor's offices and welfare departments had to give the Nazis information about people who might be 'genetically sick.'\nNazi eugenics policies regarding marriage.\nThe Nuremberg Laws of 1935 made anyone who wanted to get married get tested for genetic disorders. The goal of this rule was to make sure the \"Aryan race\" would stay \"pure,\" without people with disabilities in it. While dating, everyone was encouraged to question their dating partner carefully about whether anyone in their family ever had a genetic disorder. Members of the \"Schutzstaffel\" (SS) were ordered to carefully interview possible marriage partners to make sure they had no family history of hereditary disease or insanity, but to do this carefully to avoid hurting the woman's feelings. They were told that if they had to reject the woman for eugenic reasons, they should do it politely and not upset the woman."}

That is to say, it was the first to be known as a virus.\nIt is a single stranded RNA virus which infects many plants, especially tobacco and other members of the family Solanaceae. The infection causes \"mosaic\"-like discolouration on the leaves. Although it was known from the late 19th century that an infectious disease was damaging tobacco crops, it was not until 1930 that the infectious agent was known to be a virus.\nHistory.\nIn 1886, Adolf Mayer first described the tobacco mosaic disease that could be transferred between plants, similar to bacterial infections. \nIn 1892, Dmitri Ivanovsky gave the first concrete evidence for the existence of a non-bacterial infectious agent. He claimed that infected sap remained infectious even after filtering through finest filters. \nIn 1898, Martinus Beijerinck independently replicated Ivanovsky's filtration experiments and then showed that the infectious agent was able to reproduce and multiply in the host cells of the tobacco plant. Beijerinck coined the term of \"virus\" to indicate that the causal agent of tobacco mosaic disease was of non-bacterial nature. \nTobacco mosaic virus was the first virus to be crystallized. It was achieved by Wendell Meredith Stanley in 1935 who also showed that TMV remains active even after crystallization. For his work, he was awarded 1/3 of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1946, The first electron microscopical images of TMV were made in 1939. \nIn 1955, Heinz Fraenkel-Conrat and Robley Williams showed that purified TMV RNA and its capsid (coat) protein assemble by themselves to functional viruses, indicating that this is the most stable structure (the one with the lowest free energy).\nThe crystallographer Rosalind Franklin worked for Stanley for about a month at Berkeley, and later designed and built a model of TMV for the 1958 World's Fair at Brussels. In 1958, she speculated that the virus was hollow, not solid, and hypothesized that the RNA of TMV is single-stranded. This conjecture was proved correct after her death. \nThe investigations of tobacco mosaic disease and subsequent discovery of its viral nature were instrumental in the establishment of the general concepts of virology."}

This made him the first American to die in the American Revolutionary War. After being killed at the Boston Massacre, Attucks became a martyr of the American Revolution. He also became a symbol for the abolitionist (anti-slavery) movement, both in the 18th century and the 19th century.\nAttucks had a big impact on important historical events like the American Revolution and the abolitionist movement. However, he continues to have an impact on American culture today. Even 250 years after his death, modern songs, stories, and television shows still talk about Attucks. Children go to schools that are named after him. In 2002, Attucks was named one of the \"100 Greatest African Americans\" in United States History.\nEarly life.\nAside from how he died, historians do not know much about Attucks' life. His father, Prince Yonger, was a slave who had been born in Africa; his mother, Nancy Attucks, was a Wampanoag Native American. One of Crispus Attucks' ancestors was John Attucks of Massachusetts, who was hanged during King Philip's War.\nAttucks himself may have been a freeman, or may have escaped slavery. However, some evidence suggests that Attucks was born a slave in Framingham, Massachusetts, but escaped from slavery. In 1750, William Brown, a slave-owner in Framingham, put out an advertisement about a runaway slave named Crispus. In the advertisement, Brown offered a reward of 10 pounds to whoever found and returned Attucks to him. The description in the advertisement fit Crispus Attucks. This suggests that Attucks was a runaway slave. Still, people have argued for decades about whether Attucks was a free black man or a runaway slave. \nAttucks may have worked as a dockworker or a merchant seaman. He definitely became a sailor and spent most of the rest of his life at sea. He often worked on whalers, which involved long trips at sea. Many historians also believe that he went by the alias \"Michael Johnson\" in order to avoid being caught and sent back to slavery. He may only have been temporarily in Boston in early 1770, having recently returned from a voyage to the Bahamas. He was due to leave shortly afterwards on a ship for North Carolina.\nReaction and trials.\nJohn Adams successfully argued that most of the accused British soldiers fired their guns in self-defense. He got all but two of the soldiers acquitted of murder (found not guilty). Two of the soldiers were found guilty of manslaughter. They were punished by being branded (burned) on their thumbs. While defending the British soldiers, Adams called the crowd \"a motley rabble of saucy boys, negros and molattoes, Irish teagues and outlandish Jack Tarrs.\" In particular, he accused Attucks of having decided \"to be the hero of the night,\" and of having started a conflict with his \"mad behavior.\"\nThe five people killed in the Massacre were buried as heroes in the Granary Burying Ground, which also contains the graves of Samuel Adams, John Hancock, and other important people.\nImportance in history.\nAfter being killed in the Boston Massacre, Attucks was held up as the first martyr of the American Revolution. The deaths of Attucks and four other Americans enraged the American people and helped trigger the start of the American Revolution.\nAttucks also became a symbol of the abolitionist (anti-slavery) movement in the 18th century. In the early 19th century, as the abolitionist movement gained strength in Boston, supporters praised Attucks as an African American who played a heroic role in the history of the United States. Because Attucks was of mixed African and Native American heritage, he also became an important figure in Native American history."}

It protects the virus when it moves between host cells as part of its life-cycle.

They may help viruses avoid the host immune system. Glycoproteins on the surface of the envelope help to identify and bind to receptor sites on the host's membrane. The viral envelope then fuses with the host's membrane, allowing virus genome to enter and infect the host.\nSome enveloped viruses also have a capsid. This is another protein layer, between the envelope and the genome.\nThe cell from which a virus buds often dies or is weakened. The lipid bilayer envelope of these viruses is sensitive to desiccation, heat, and detergents This makes it easier to sterile these viruses than non-enveloped viruses.

Each state has its own constitution, while the federal sovereign possesses only the limited supreme authority given by the Constitution. States may grant their citizens broader rights than the federal Constitution as long as they do not infringe on any federal constitutional rights.

(Before getting married, Koch's maiden name was Margarete Ilse K\u00f6hler.) During World War II, Karl-Otto Koch was the \"Commandant\" (commander) of the Nazi concentration camps at Sachsenhausen, Buchenwald, and finally Majdanek. In 1947, Ilse Koch became one of the first important Nazis to be tried by the United States Military.\nMass media around the world covered Ilse Koch's trial. People who had survived the Buchenwald and Majdanek camps talked about how she enjoyed abusing prisoners at the camps. For example, they said she used to like beating prisoners with her riding crop, and that she used to make prisoners do exhausting exercise because she liked watching them suffer. In Germany after the war, Koch was seen as \"the concentration camp murderess.\" She was accused of having prisoners with interesting tattoos murdered so she could take their skin as souvenirs.\nThe prisoners at the concentration camps called Koch \"Die Hexe von Buchenwald\" (\"The Witch of Buchenwald\") because of she would act cruelly and sexually towards prisoners at the same time. In English, she has also been called \"The Beast of Buchenwald,\" the \"Queen of Buchenwald,\" the \"Red Witch of Buchenwald,\" the \"Butcher Widow,\" and, most often, \"The Bitch of Buchenwald.\"\nEarly life.\nKoch was born Margarete Ilse K\u00f6hler on 22 September 1906 in Dresden, Germany. Her father was a factory foreman. In elementary school, she was known as a polite and happy child. At age 15, she started school to become an accountant. Later, she went to work as a bookkeeping clerk. Germany's economy had been ruined when Germany lost World War I, and at the time that Koch worked in bookkeeping, the economy still had not recovered.\nIn 1932, Koch became a member of the Nazi Party, which was getting more and more popular. Through some friends in the \"Sturmabteilung\" (SA) and \"Schutzstaffel\" (SS), she met Karl-Otto Koch in 1934. They got married two years later.\nWar crimes.\nIn 1936, Koch began working as a guard and secretary at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp near Berlin, which her fiance, Karl-Otto, commanded. They got married the same year. In 1937, Koch went to Buchenwald when Karl-Otto was made Commandant there. While at Buchenwald, Koch helped with an experiment by picking out tattooed prisoners to be murdered and skinned, so the tattooed parts of their skin could be kept. Koch later said she did this to help a prison doctor, Erich Wagner, in his study of tattooing and crime.\nIn 1940, Koch built an indoor sports arena, which cost over 250,000 reichsmarks (equal to about $62,500 at the time). She had stolen most of this money from prisoners at the camp. In 1941, Karl-Otto Koch was transferred to Lublin, where he helped create the Majdanek concentration and extermination camp. Ilse Koch stayed at Buchenwald until 24 August 1943. On that day, she and her husband were arrested. The Kochs were charged with embezzlement; stealing huge amounts of money and valuables from prisoners to make themselves rich; and murdering prisoners to keep them from talking about what the Kochs were doing.\nIlse Koch was put in prison until 1944, when she was found not guilty because there was not enough evidence against her. However, her husband was found guilty and sentenced to death by an SS court in Munich. He was shot to death in Buchenwald in April of 1945. \nAfter her husband was executed, Ilse Koch went to live with her surviving family in the town of Ludwigsburg. She was arrested there by United States officials on 30 June 1945.\nFirst trial.\nKoch and 30 other Nazis were arraigned before the American military court at Dachau in 1947. She was charged with \"participating in a criminal plan for aiding, abetting and participating in the murders at Buchenwald.\" This meant she had been part of a plan to murder people at Buchenwald, and had helped with the murders in some way.\nIn the courtroom, Koch said that she was pregnant. She was telling the truth; she was eight months pregnant. Koch already had a reputation for having sex with many different men. The Buchenwald Report said there were rumors that Koch was having relationships with Waldemar Hoven, the chief medical doctor at Buchenwald, and Hermann Florstedt, the Deputy Commandant, at the same time. In his book \"Innocent at Dachau,\" the Dachau tribunal court reporter, Joseph Halow, wrote that rumors said Koch had relationships with many SS officers, and even with some of the prisoners at the Buchenwald concentration camp. Still, Koch's pregnancy surprised the court because she was 41 years old at the time. She was also being kept by herself in prison, and saw no men except the Americans who questioned her; most of them were Jewish. In his book, Halow also says he was shocked to learn that Koch may have turned to other men because her husband was a homosexual. Records at Buchenwald showed that he had been treated for syphilis.\nOn 19 August 1947, Koch was sentenced to life in prison for \"[breaking] the laws and customs of war.\"\nLighter sentence.\nOn 8 June 1948, General Lucius D. Clay, the temporary military governor of the American Zone in Germany, decreased Koch's life sentence to four years in prison. He gave the reason that \"there was no convincing evidence that she had selected inmates for [murder] in order to secure tattooed skins, or that she [had anything] made of human skin.\"\nA biography of General Clay, written by Jean Edward Smith, says that years later, the General said:\nHowever, the General also said: \nNews of the change in Koch's sentence did not become public until 16 September 1948. Many people were furious about the change, but General Clay did not change his mind.\nSecond trial.\nBecause people were so upset about her lighter sentence, Koch was re-arrested in 1949 and tried before a West German court. The trial started on 27 November 1950 and lasted seven weeks. During this time, 250 witnesses testified, including 50 who defended Koch. Koch collapsed and had to be carried from the court in late December 1950, and again on 11 January 1951. At least four separate witnesses for the prosecution testified either that they had seen Koch choose tattooed prisoners, who were then killed; or that they had seen or helped make human-skin lampshades from tattooed skin. However, prosecutors dropped this charge when they could not prove lampshades or any other items were actually made from human skin.\nOn 15 January 1951, the Court gave its verdict in a 111 page-long decision. Koch was not in court for the verdict. The Court decided that it could still try Koch, even though she had already been tried in 1944 and 1947, because it was charging her with different crimes than the other trials did. Because of this, trying Koch again would not be double jeopardy. Koch was convicted of charges of incitement (encouraging others) to murder, attempt to murder, and hurt other people badly. On 15 January 1951 , Koch was sentenced to life in prison, and her civil rights were taken away forever.\nKoch appealed the Court's decision, but the appeal was denied on 22 April 1952 by the Federal Court of Justice of Germany. Koch later tried several times to get a pardon. However, the Bavarian Ministry of Justice refused all of her requests. Koch also protested her life sentence to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, but got no help from them.\nFamily.\nKarl and Ilse Koch had a son named Artwin and two daughters named Gisele and Gudrun (Gudrun died as a baby). Their son killed himself after the war. Ilse Koch had another son, Uwe, conceived in her prison cell at Dachau by an unknown father. Uwe was born in the Aichach women's prison near Dachau where Koch was sent to serve her life sentence. Right away, he was taken away from her. At the age of 19, Uwe K\u00f6hler learned that Koch was his mother and began visiting her regularly at Aichach.\nDeath.\nKoch killed herself at Aichach prison on 1 September 1967, at age 60, by hanging herself with her bedsheets."}

It produces a mechanical sound effect and a chemical gunshot residue. The term can also refer to a gunshot wound caused by the bullet. Multiple discharges of a firearm or firearms are referred to as gunfire. The word can mean either the sound of a gun firing, the projectiles that were fired, or both. For example, the statement \"gunfire came from the next street\" could either mean the sound of discharge, or it could mean the bullets themselves. It is better to be more specific while writing however. \"The sound of gunfire\" or \"we came under gunfire\" would be more descriptive and prevent confusion.\nGunfire characteristics.\nThere are three things that characterize gunfire and allow a person to detect and locate gunfire and similar weapon discharges:\nGunfire can be confused with other sounds that can sound similar. These include firework explosions and cars backfiring. The sounds may be heard at greater distances in the direction of bullet travel than behind or to either side of the firearm.\nUrban areas have noise patterns where background noise is higher during the daytime and lower at night. Firearm muzzle blast may be masked by background noise during daytime. But it may be detected at greater distances during the quieter hours of darkness. A popular urban gunfire locator system typically uses six to ten audio sensors per square mile for trilateration. (two or three per square kilometer)\nSuppressors.\nA suppressor, sometimes called a \"silencer\", can be attached to the muzzle of a firearm to reduce the sound of firing the weapon. Suppressors attached to the muzzle will not reduce the sound of high velocity gas released from other locations like the gap between the cylinder and barrel of a revolver. A muzzle silencer is also ineffective in reducing the snap of a supersonic bullet, or the noise produced by the mechanical action of a self-loading firearm. Use of silencers is rare in United States crimes. A 2007 study estimated unlawful silencers were involved in only 0.05 percent (1 in 2,000) federal criminal prosecutions. Also, these include cases where the silencer was not used, but simply in the possession of the defendant for 92% of prosecutions involving a silencer."}

The Nazis' ideas about eugenics said that people with disabilities were \"life unworthy of life. Hartheim was one of six \"euthanasia centres\" the Nazis set up for their T4 Euthanasia Programme. Their goal was to get rid of all of Germany's people with disabilities. The killing centre was housed in Hartheim Castle in Alkoven, near Linz, Austria.\nHartheim statistics.\nIn June 1945, after the United States took over Austria, an American soldier found the \"Hartheim statistics\" in the Castle. This was a 39-page report written about the T-4 Euthanasia Programme (\"Aktion T4\"). It was meant to be seen by other Nazis in the program only. In the report were monthly counts of how many people with mental and physical disabilities were \"disinfected\" (gassed to death) in the Nazis' six euthanasia centres. In 1968 and 1970, an ex-employee said that he had to put together the material at the end of 1942. The Hartheim statistics included a page that said that \"disinfecting [killing] 70,273 people with a life expectation of 10 years\" had saved food in the value of 141,775,573.80 Reichsmarks.\nNumbers killed in the first extermination phase in Hartheim.\nAccording to the Hartheim statistics, between May 1940 and 1 September, 1941, a total of 18,269 people were killed in the gas chamber at Hartheim:\nThese statistics only cover the first extermination phase of the Nazi's euthanasia programme, \"Action T4\". Hitler officially ended that program because of protests, but secretly he kept killing people with disabilities. He also kept killing people he did not like right up to the end of the war.\nIn all it is estimated that a total of 30,000 people were executed at Hartheim. Among those killed were sick prisoners, prisoners with disabilities, and prisoners from concentration camps. The killings were carried out by carbon monoxide poisoning.\n14\u00a0f 13 \"Special Treatment\" programme.\nJust three days after the formal end of Action T4, a lorry arrived at Hartheim with 70 Jewish inmates from Mauthausen concentration camp. The inmates were killed at Hartheim. The Hartheim killing centre achieved a special reputation, because it was where the largest number of patients, and the most concentration prisoners, were gassed. Their numbers are estimated at 12,000.\nPrisoners at Mauthausen who were no longer able to work, especially in the quarries, and \"politically undesirable\" prisoners were brought to Hartheim to be executed. These victims included:\nFrom 1944 on, T4 doctors no longer picked out sick, elderly, or disabled prisoners to be killed. Instead, the Nazis' new goal was to free up space in the Mauthausen camp quickly, so they would send groups of women to Hartheim to be killed. Other transports came from the concentration camp of Gusen, and probably also from Ravensbr\u00fcck, during 1944. These transports were made most of women with tuberculosis and women who had been labeled mentally ill.\nDoctors.\nAdolf Hitler's order from 1 September 1939 approving the start of the T4 Programme only mentioned doctors. Because of this, the Action T4 organisers, Viktor Brack and Karl Brandt, ordered that only medical doctors could execute sick patients. Doctors controlled the poison gas in the euthanasia centres. Many doctors used fake names in records about the people they killed.\nFrom 1940 to 1945, Rudolf Lonauer was the head doctor at Hartheim, and Georg Renno was the Deputy head doctor.\nNiedernhart holding station.\nThe Action T4 Euthanasia Centres had temporary holding stations for victims. For example, many trucks carrying victims to Hartheim would stop at the Niedernhart Mental Institute in Linz, where Rudolf Lonauer was the senior doctor, as he was at Hartheim. At Niedernhart, victims were mainly killed by starvation or medical overdose (by giving deadly amounts of medicine). Patients would be put into categories. Some would be chosen and taken to Hartheim to be killed.\nVictims.\nPeople with disabilities.\nThe Nazis thought that many different groups of people, but especially people with disabilities, were \"life unworthy of life.\" They killed children and adults in their Euthanasia Centers. These victims included:\nClergy.\nAlmost 350 priests were killed at Hartheim. These victims included 310 Polish priests, seven Germans, six Czechs, four Luxemburgians, three Dutch, and two Belgians. Many of them were taken from the Priest's Block in Dachau concentration camp.\nDachau's chaplain, Hermann Scheipers, was also moved to the camp's invalid's block, so he could be taken to Hartheim as well. Scheipers' sister\u2014who had kept in touch with Schiepers by mail\u2014tracked down Dr. Bernsdorf, who was in charge of the clergy imprisoned in the Priest's Block. She told him that, in M\u00fcnsterland, many people knew that imprisoned priests were sent to the gas chambers. After the conversation, Bernsdorf telephoned the commandant's office at Dachau. Scheipers reported that on that same day, 13 August 1942, he and three other German clergymen were saved from being sent to Hartheim. They were moved from the invalid's block, where the \"Schutzstaffel\" (SS) sent prisoners when they were going to be sent to another camp. The four clergymen were sent back to the priest's block."}

When a bullet leaves the barrel of a firearm, it is accompanied by gases that include both burned and unburned particles of gunpowder. It also includes traces of metal from the firearm, the ammunition and the primer including the signature components of gunshot residue: lead, barium and antimony. GSR is usually found on the skin and clothing of the person who fired the gun. It may also be found in the entrance wound of the victim. This depends on how close the victim was to the gun when it was fired.\nForensic science of GSR.\nWhen a gun is fired, a plume of gas\u2014including GSR particles\u2014is ejected from the barrel and any other openings in the gun. The gunshot residue is deposited on objects that are close to the fired gun including the gun itself.\nCrime scene specialists collect GSR from people and objects when there is reason to believe it may be there. The collected samples are then taken to a laboratory where they are examined. Forensic scientists can also use GSR residue to determine the distance between the barrel of the fired weapon and the target. The farther from the weapon the less the gunshot residue. Collection of GSR is time sensitive in many cases. After 4 to 8 hours it may wear off people's hands. It can remain for longer periods on a dead body or other objects. A number of advancements have been made in gunshot residue examinations in recent years. One improvement is in the use of scanning electron microscopes.\nRecently, a test for finding GSR when the ammunition used was \"green\" or lead-free.

It is degenerative (it gets worse over time); it cannot be cured, and it always causes death. CJD is sometimes called a human form of \"mad cow disease\" (bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE). BSE is actually a cause of one rare type of Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease; the two are not the same disease.\nCJD is caused by an infectious agent called a prion. Prions are proteins that are folded wrong. Prions make copies of themselves by changing correctly folded proteins into misfolded shapes. CJD causes brain tissue to become unhealthy very quickly. As the disease destroys the brain, the brain develops holes. The brain's texture changes and becomes like a kitchen sponge.\nTypes and causes of CJD.\nTypes of CJD include:\nSigns and symptoms.\nThe first symptom of CJD is dementia, which gets worse very quickly. dementia causes memory loss, personality changes, and hallucinations.\nOther common mental symptoms include:\nPhysical symptoms of CJD often include:\nMost people with CJD die within six months after their first symptoms appeared. Often, they die of pneumonia caused by trouble coughing. About 15% of patients survive for two or more years. Some patients have lived 4\u20135 years with mostly mental symptoms until the disease gets worse and causes more physical symptoms. Once this happens, people usually die within a year.\nThe symptoms of CJD are caused by the death of more and more of the brain's nerve cells. When scientists look at brain tissue from a CJD patient under a microscope, they can see many tiny holes where whole areas of nerve cells have died.\nDiagnosis.\nDoctors may suspect CJD when a person has certain symptoms. For example, dementia usually gets worse slowly. Dementia that gets worse very quickly is unusual. Along with symptoms like jerky movements, these symptoms may point to possible CJD.\nTests can then be done to show whether the person has CJD. These tests include:\nTreatment.\nAs of 2016, there is no treatment that cures CJD or even slows down its effects. Many experiments are being done to try to find treatments.\nToday, the only treatments for CJD are medicines that treat the disease's symptoms and help patients be more comfortable. For example, patients who have seizures may be given anticonvulsant medications. Benzodiazepines can make muscle jerks happen less often.\nPatients may also choose to have medical procedures to help with bad symptoms. For example, CJD may cause so much trouble swallowing that a person cannot eat. Some people with CJD choose to have a feeding tube put in when they can no longer eat. This is a tube that goes into the stomach, so that special liquid can be given right into the stomach to give the person nutrition."}

These two sections are separated by the vocal cords.\nUpper airways.\nThe nose and nasal cavity.\nThe upper respiratory tract starts with the nose and the nasal cavity. When a person breathes in through the nose, the air goes into the nasal cavity. The nasal cavity is lined with mucous and little hairs called cilia. These help filter things like dust out of the air a person breathes. The nasal cavity also warms the air.\nThe pharynx.\nNext is the pharynx. The pharynx is a common pathway for air and food. When a person breathes in, air goes through the pharynx on its way to the lungs. When a person eats, food passes through the pharynx on its way to the digestive system. There are three parts to the pharynx:\nThe larynx.\nThe next part of the upper airways is the larynx. The larynx is sometimes called the \"voice box\" because it has the vocal cords in it, making it possible to speak. The larynx also protects the trachea. Important parts of the larynx include:\nThe vocal cords mark the end of the upper airways.\nLower airways.\nThe larynx continues.\nThe larynx continues in the lower airways. Important parts of the larynx that are in the lower airways include:\nThe bronchi.\nThe trachea then splits into the two main bronchi. This split happens at a place called the carina, which is behind the middle of the sternum (breastbone). The bronchi are two tubes which carry air into the lungs. The main bronchi then split into smaller and smaller bronchi, which reach out into all the parts of the lungs like tree branches. Finally, the smallest bronchi, called bronchioles, end in the alveoli.\nFunction.\nThe airways' job is to bring air to the lungs, so it can get to the alveoli. At the alveoli, a very important process called \"gas exchange\" takes place. Oxygen from the air breathed into the lungs goes into the blood. The blood can then carry oxygen to every part of the body through the bloodstream. During gas exchange, carbon dioxide goes from the blood into the lungs, so it can be breathed out. If this exchange of gases did not happen, the body would not get enough oxygen to stay alive, and would also get poisoned by carbon dioxide."}

The earliest known practice is 12,000 BC by people in the Middle East and Asia.\nWater is traditionally removed through evaporation by drying the food in the air, sun or in smoke. A great variety of drying techniques are now used.\nMany different foods can be preserved by drying. Meat and fish are preserved through such traditional methods as drying, smoking and salting."}

Most designers of typefaces were artists. Some were outstanding in other artistic fields, and were part of the wider artistic culture of their times.\nThe apostle of sans serif was Jan Tschichold (2 April 1902 Leipzig, Germany \u2013 11 August 1974 Locarno, Switzerland), a German-Swiss graphic designer. \nTschichold not only designed typefaces, he showed how they could be used in the design of book printing. He was a chief designer for Penguin Books after the Second World War.\nSans serif faces are most used for display signs, advertising and for headings in books. Although they seem to work well for the text in books, they are much less used for that purpose."}

One story is that the British soldier and politician Edward Coke, the younger brother of the 2nd Earl of Leicester had it made in 1849. Its purpose was to protect his gamekeepers' heads from low-hanging branches while on horseback. The keepers had previously worn top hats, which were easily knocked off and damaged. \nThe bowler hat was popular with the working class during the Victorian era, and later on with the middle and upper classes in Britain and the eastern United States. In Britain, they are worn as civilian dress by Guards officers. \nOutside the United Kingdom.\nThe bowler was the most popular hat in the American Old West. It was \"the hat that won the West\". Both cowboys and railroad workers preferred the hat because it would not blow off easily in strong wind while riding a horse, or when sticking one's head out the window of a speeding train. It was worn by both lawmen and outlaws, including Bat Masterson, Butch Cassidy, Black Bart, and Billy the Kid. In America the hat came to be commonly known as the \"derby\", and Wild West outlaw Marion Hedgepeth was commonly referred to as \"the Derby Kid\".\nThe bowler, called a in Spanish, has been worn by Quechua and Aymara women since the 1920s, when it was introduced to Bolivia by British railway workers. For many years, a factory in Italy manufactured the hats for the Bolivian market, but they are now made locally. Another region where the bowler hat is worn is the Niger Delta area of Nigeria.\nPopular culture.\nThe bowler makes regular appearances. It was part of John Steed's outfit in \"The Avengers\" British TV series, and Oddjob's favourite weapon in the original \"Goldfinger\" film. It was worn by \"Charlie Chaplin\" and Stan Laurel in movies."}

{"id": "529131", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=529131", "title": "Kapo", "text": "A kapo or prisoner functionary was a special type of prisoner in the Nazi concentration camps during The Holocaust. Kapos were chosen by the \"Schutzstaffel\" (SS) camp guards to help run the camps. Some kapos were in charge of other prisoners, who had to do forced labor. Other kapos did paperwork and kept records in the camps.\nThe Nazis used kapos for many reasons. With kapos helping to run the camps, the camps did not need as many SS guards. The kapos helped the SS control the other prisoners. This made it possible for a small number of SS to run large concentration camps. Also, because kapos were prisoners, they were not paid for their work, so this system also saved a lot of money.\nEven though they were not paid, the kapos got special treatment. They did not have to do hard labor, and they were not physically abused like the other prisoners. They sometimes got extra food, cigarettes, alcohol, regular clothes, and private rooms. However, to keep this special treatment, the kapos had to keep the SS guards happy. If they did not control the other prisoners well enough, the kapos would lose their jobs. They would become regular prisoners again.\nThe SS often chose kapos who were members of violent criminal gangs. These kapos often abused other prisoners badly. The SS allowed this abuse to happen.\nWhat did the kapos do?\nThe SS controlled the concentration camps. However, from day to day, the kapos helped keep the camps running. They made it possible for the camps to run with fewer SS guards. Sometimes, up to 10% of the prisoners at the camps were kapos. Without the kapos, the SS running the camps would not have been able to keep the camps running smoothly.\nKapos were often hated by other prisoners and were seen as Nazi henchmen. Sometimes, other prisoners would spit on the kapos. Some barracks leaders (\"block\u00e4lteste\") secretly helped prisoners in their barracks get extra food or easier jobs. However, other kapos did more to help the SS, partly because they thought this would help them survive the camps.\nCriminal kapos were called \"professional criminals\" by other prisoners . These kapos were known for being cruel and brutal to other prisoners. In fact, this was why the SS had chosen them to be kapos. According to former prisoners, kapos who were criminals were more likely to be helpful to the SS. Kapos who were sent to concentration camps for disagreeing with the Nazis' politics were more likely to be helpful to other prisoners.\nIn his \"Dictionary of the Camp\", Oliver Lustig wrote:\nVicenzo and Luigi Pappalettera wrote in their book \"The Brutes Have the Floor\" that, every time a new transport of [prisoners] arrived at Mauthausen [concentration camp], Kapo August Adam picked out the professors, lawyers, priests and magistrates and cynically asked them: \"Are you a lawyer? A professor? Good! ... I am a killer. I have five convictions on my record: one for manslaughter and four for robbery. Well, here I am in command. The world has turned upside down, did you get that? Do you need a \"dolmetscher\", an interpreter? Here it is!\" And he was pointing to his bat, after which he struck. When he was satisfied, he formed a [work group] with those selected and sent them to clean the latrines.\nDomination and terror.\nThe SS used domination and terror to control the many prisoners in the camps with just a few SS guards. Kapos were a very important part of this system, where prisoners were completely controlled and always had to be afraid of being hurt or murdered.\nThe Nazis used many different strategies to torture prisoners mentally and physically, and to keep them under control. These strategies included:\nKapos helped with all these things. Their job also included pushing the prisoners to work harder. Many kapos, especially the criminals, could be very cruel to prisoners, especially when SS guards were nearby, to show that they were doing their jobs and deserved their special treatment. They often beat prisoners, and some even killed prisoners. Some kapos sexually abused young boys and men.\nOne non-criminal kapo was Josef Heiden. He was an Austrian political prisoner (someone put in prison because they disagreed with the Nazis' political beliefs). Prisoners feared and hated him. He was known as a sadist - someone who liked hurting and torturing people. He killed several people while he was a kapo. He was set free from Dachau concentration camp in 1942, and joined the Waffen SS. Some kapos personally helped the SS mass murder other prisoners. Beginning in October 1944, the Nazis started transferring criminal kapos to the Dirlewanger Brigade of the Waffen SS.\nKapos had a bad reputation for helping the Nazis and often being cruel. However, a book written about Jewish kapos says that many kapos felt caught in the middle. They felt like victims of the Nazis, but at the same time they were helping the Nazis and hurting fellow prisoners. Many of them felt guilty about what they did, both at the time and after World War II ended.\nKapo ranks.\nIn the capo system, there were different types of kapos, who had different ranks and different jobs.\nThe highest, most powerful job that a prisoner could get was called \"Lager\u00e4ltester\" (\"camp leader\" or \"camp senior\"). He (or she) answered directly to the camp's \"commandant\" (commander). The Lager\u00e4ltester had to make sure that everything ran smoothly in the camps every day.\nThe second-most powerful kapos were the \"Block\u00e4ltester\" (block or barracks leader) and the \"Stuben\u00e4ltester\" (room leader). The \"Block\u00e4ltester\" was in charge of the prisoners in the barracks, and making sure they followed the rules. The \"Stuben\u00e4lteste\" was in charge of a specific room within a barracks. He had to force the prisoners to make the barracks neat and clean. He was also in charge of the room's hygiene, like killing lice (which spread diseases like typhus).\nThe \"Blockschreiber\" (registrar or barrack clerk) kept records. For example, he kept track of prisoners during roll calls (where prisoners were forced to stand and be counted over and over).\nWork crews outside the camp were controlled by a \"Vorarbeiter\" (foreman), a Kapo, or \"Oberkapo\" (chief kapo). These functionaries pushed their fellow prisoners to work harder and harder, hitting and beating them, even killing them.\nKapos could often help other prisoners by getting them into better barracks, or getting them assigned to easier work. Sometimes, kapos were even able to get other prisoners removed from transport lists when they were scheduled to be sent to death camps. Some kapos were also able to get prisoners new identities to protect them from persecution When kapos did these things, they usually did them only for people in their own group (for example, people from the same country or political party). Not every kapo did this, and the ones who did had to be very careful. If the kapos made the SS angry by helping other prisoners, they would lose their jobs and might even be sent to the gas chambers to be murdered. Heinrich Himmler described this in a speech:\nThe moment he becomes a \"Kapo\", he no longer sleeps with [the other prisoners]. He is held accountable for the performance of the work, that they are clean, that the beds are well-built. [...] So, he must drive his men. The moment we become dissatisfied with him, he is no longer Kapo, he's back to sleeping with his men. And he knows that he will be beaten to death by them the first night.&lt;br&gt;\u2014Heinrich Himmler, June 21, 1944\nA kapo who the SS liked could have a camp \"career\" and be promoted from \"Kapo\" to \"Oberkapo\" and eventually to \"Lager\u00e4ltester\". However, he could also just as easily be sent to the gas chambers if he did something the SS did not like."}

He played a prominent role in the Texas Revolution. He died at the Battle of the Alamo. Stories of him as a fighter and frontiersman, both real and fictitious, have made him a legendary figure in Texas history. He is a folk hero of American history. The Bowie knife is named after Jim Bowie.\nEarly life.\nBowie was born in April 1796 in Logan County, Kentucky. He was the son of Reason and Elve Ap-Catesby (Jones) Bowie. Reason was a farmer and operated a Gristmill. The family moved in February 1800 to New Madrid, Missouri, then part of Spanish Louisiana. In 1801 they settled on farms in what is now Catahoula Parish, Louisiana. There Reason and his brothers swore allegiance to the Spanish government. Reason created a plantation there where he grew cotton and sugarcane. He also raised livestock and bought and sold slaves. This is where Jim and his brothers grew up.\nAdult life.\nEarly career.\nAs a teenager Bowie floated lumber to market in the Avoyelles and Rapides parishes in Louisiana. He and his brother Rezin joined the army during the War of 1812. Their regiment was on its way to join Andrew Jackson at New Orleans when the war ended. After the war he and his brothers entered into the slave-trading business. During this time he developed a reputation as a deadly knife-fighter. He then got into land speculation. He bought large parcels of land and sold them whenever he could make a profit. Many of his land claims turned out to be fraudulent. He and his brothers moved to Arkansas where they soon were involved in new land speculation schemes.\nIn Texas.\nIn 1830 Bowie moved to Coahuila y Tejas (now the Mexican state of Coahuila). There he swore allegiance to Mexico. He purchased land grants in Stephen F. Austin's colony. This, and the Cotton mill he bought, allowed him to become a Mexican citizen. He married Ursula de Veramendi in April 1831 and the couple settled at Saltillo, the capital of Coahuila y Tejas. In 1833 the capital changed to Monclova. When the two towns decided to fight over the issue, Bowie supported Monclova. Urusla and her parents died of choleria in Monclova in September of 1833.\nWhile living in Texas, Bowie had a number of adventures. One was written about by his brother John in an article: \"Early Life in the Southwest\u2014The Bowies\" in De Bow's Review of the Southern and Western States (1852). While looking for a silver mine north of San Antonio Bowie, his brother Rezin and 9 others were attacked by some 150 Comanches. After killing a number of Comanches during several days of fighting, he and the remaining survivors escaped at night to a nearby settlement. \nAntonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna was the president of Mexico during this time. He declared himself a dictator in May 1834. He then got rid of the congress and the state legislatures. Along with several other Mexican states, Coahuila y Tejas (Texas) rebelled. At first, the Texans (Tejanos) wanted the 1824 constitution brought back. But they soon changed to demand independence from Mexico. Bowie went to San Felipe, Texas to take muskets from a Mexican armory. He fought at the Battle of Concepci\u00f3n in October 1835 having been made a colonel of volunteers.\nThe Alamo.\nIn January 1836 he joined William B. Travis as co-commanders of The Alamo. There they were joined by others including Davy Crockett, who arrived in February 1836. On February 23, 1836 Santa Anna arrived with an army of up to 6,000 soldiers. About 189 Texans held off the Mexican army for 13 days. The Alamo finally fell on March 6, 1836 with nearly all the defenders killed. One of the few survivors was Sarah the wife of captain Almaron Dickinson.\nBowie knife.\nThe knife Bowie was famous for may actually have been designed by his brother, Rezin P. Bowie. Rezin (pronounced \"reason\") gave his younger brother (Jim) the knife so he would always have a backup weapon. It became history after the sandbar fight on the banks of the Mississippi River in September 1827.\nPhysical description.\nAccording to his brother John, Jim Bowie was a large man, about tall and about . He had light colored hair, grey eyes and a fair complexion. He has been described as being mild mannered. But if insulted, he had a terrible temper that quickly came out.\nPopular media.\nThere have been a number of movies about the Battle of the Alamo. Bowie has appeared as a character in many of them:"}

It is also present in cytoplasmic granules of macrophages and granulocyte neutrophils.\nThe enzyme works by attacking polymers in the cell walls of bacteria, especially Gram-positive bacteria like \"Bacillus\" and \"Streptococcus\".\nLysozyme was the second protein structure, and the first enzyme structure, solved by X-ray diffraction methods. It was the first enzyme to be fully sequenced that contains all twenty common amino acids.\nIt was also the first enzyme to have a detailed, specific mechanism suggested for its action. This work led to an explanation of how enzymes speed up a chemical reaction by their physical structures."}

The name of the city means \"Eternal Spring\". In the year 1800, the Jiaqing Emperor set up a trading post in a small village to trade furs and other goods. This village later became Changchun Ting.\nIn 1898, Changchun got its first train station, which was built by the Russian Empire.\nAfter Japan invaded Manchuria in September 1931, the Japanese established the capital of the newly formed puppet state, Manchukuo, in Changchun. The Japanese renamed the city Shinky\u014d (kanji: \u65b0\u4eac, meaning: New Capital), and it is here where the Japanese established the former Emperor Pu-yi as the Emperor of Manchukuo. During the Japanese occupation, the Japanese built much of the infrastructure that still stands today, including the Manchukuo Imperial Palace, the First Clinical Hospital of Jilin University, the Palace of Geology, and several others.\nOn August 20, 1945, the Soviet Union's Soviet Red Army entered the city, captured Emperor Pu-yi, and drove the Japanese out. They stayed there until the Kuomintang drove them out in 1946. The KMT held the city until 1948, when it got overwhelmed by the communist PLA in 1948. During the Siege of Changchun, up to 80% of civilians starved to death.\nThe Chinese took down few of the Japanese buildings because they were already so well-built that the Chinese thought it would be a waste to tear them down. Nonetheless, the tumblers that Starbucks sells in Changchun feature the Changchun Railway Station out of all the other monuments in the city, due to the fact that it itself is not a Japanese-made building.\nChangchun is also the heart of China's car-making business."}

The second part is heard as a comment about or an answer to what the first has sung. This mimics or makes fun of how people talk back and forth to each other. Call and response uses the simple musical form of a verse and then a chorus used in many cultures or traditions. These songs are usually energetic and fun to listen to.\nPopular music.\nCall and response singing is common in modern Western popular music. This is because of the influence of African music. Some cross-over rhythm and blues, jazz, soul, rock 'n' roll and rock music have a call and response style, as well.\nOne of the best known is the song \"Ooh Poo Pah Doo\", written and first recorded by Jessie Hill. The song is said to be \"a nonsensical yet rollicking call-and-response workout that perfectly captures the energy of French Quarter life\", by a reviewer for Allmusic. The song is so popular, it has over 100 cover versions recorded and performed live over the years by other popular musicians.\nOther popular examples are The Who's song \"My Generation, from the album of the same name\", and \"Black Dog\" by Led Zeppelin.\nFolk music.\nCall and response is common in folk and choral singing of many people, especially in African musical cultures. In the West, it is most often seen in African-American work songs, military marches, and Qu\u00e9becois folk songs. The style is also used in dance-songs of various European countries including France (particularly Brittany) and the Faroe Islands.\nIn Cuban music and other latin music genres such as salsa, call and response between the lead singer and the chorus is called \"coro-preg\u00f3n.\"\nExample.\nA singer makes a musical statement, and then the musical chorus answers together. American bluesman Muddy Waters uses call and response in one of his best known songs, \"Mannish Boy\". The entire song is almost entirely leader/chorus call and response."}

The heart has four chambers (closed spaces). The top two are called the atria, and the bottom two are called the ventricles. When the heart is working normally, electrical signals in the heart tell the to atria squeeze first. However, in ventricular tachycardia, the ventricles squeeze first. This happens because the electrical signals that tell the atria to squeeze first are not working.\nVentricular tachycardia is a medical emergency. First of all, if the heart is beating too fast, it does not have time to refill with blood between beats. This means that the heart will not be able to squeeze out enough blood to the rest of the body. Most people in ventricular tachycardia have a heart rate of at least 170 beats per minute. This is very fast. (A normal heart rate is 60-100.)\nVentricular tachycardia can also cause low blood pressure. If the blood pressure gets low enough, important parts of the body, like the brain, will not get enough blood and oxygen to survive.\nVentricular tachycardia can also lead to ventricular fibrillation, asystole (where the heart stops beating), and sudden death.\nSymptoms.\nThe most common symptoms of ventricular tachycardia are feeling dizzy, having palpitations (feeling the heart pounding inside the chest), having trouble breathing, or chest pain. Some people with ventricular tachycardia do not have any symptoms, especially if the V-tach lasts for only a few seconds. \nWhen a person's heart rate is very high, or the ventricular tachycardia lasts for more than a few seconds, the person may faint or become unconscious because their brain is not getting enough blood and oxygen. In the worst cases, their heart may stop, or they may die.\nDiagnosis.\nA doctor can diagnose ventricular tachycardia by doing an electrocardiogram (also called an ECG or an EKG). This is a test that shows the electrical activity in the heart. The doctor will be able to see that the electrical signals that tell the atria to squeeze first are not working.\nTreatment.\nVentricular tachycardia can be treated in a few different ways. Treatment depends on whether the patient still has a pulse. If the patient is in \"pulseless ventricular tachycardia\", their heart is beating so fast that it cannot squeeze out any blood.\nCardioversion.\nIf a person still has a pulse, ventricular tachycardia can usually be stopped through cardioversion. Cardioversion means using medication or an electric shock to make the heart start beating normally again.\nDefibrillation.\nIf a person has pulseless ventricular tachycardia, they need to be shocked with a defibrillator.\nTwo different types of defibrillators can be used. An \"external defibrillator\" is a machine that delivers a shock through two sticky pads that are placed on the person's chest. \nHowever, some people who have already been diagnosed with V-tach have surgery to put a defibrillator inside their chest. This is called an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). This type of defibrillator shocks the heart automatically when it goes into V-tach.\nFirst aid.\nIf a person goes into pulseless ventricular tachycardia, first aid can be helpful. 9-1-1 or the local emergency telephone number should be called immediately. Then - like in any situation where a person suddenly becomes unconscious and has no pulse - cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) should be started right away. An emergency medical dispatcher can help explain how to do CPR until an ambulance gets there.\nCauses.\nVentricular tachycardia can be caused by many different things. The most common cause is ischemic heart disease (heart disease that causes the heart to not get enough oxygen).\nVentricular tachycardia can also be caused by other problems, like:\nSometimes doctors cannot find a cause for ventricular tachycardia. This is called idiopathic ventricular tachycardia.\nPrognosis.\nVentricular tachycardia causes most of the sudden cardiac deaths in the United States. It causes about 300,000 deaths every year.\nThe chance of sudden death is highest for people who:\nThe chance of sudden death is lowest for people with idiopathic ventricular tachycardia.\nEven for high-risk people, treatment with medications like beta blockers can help. So can implantable cardio-defibrillators."}

It can cause joint pains that can last for weeks, months, or sometimes even years. About 1 in every 1000 people who gets chikungunya dies. People who are elderly or have other medical problems are most likely to die or get very sick from chikungunya.\nChikungunya is spread to humans by two species of mosquito: \"Aedes albopictus\" and \"Aedes aegypti\". These mosquitoes carry the infection to humans after biting monkeys, birds, cattle, or rodents who have chikungunya. Since 2004, there have been outbreaks (where many people get chikungunya) in Asia, Europe, and The Americas.\nThere is no known treatment or cure for chikungunya.\nSigns and symptoms.\nIt can take one to twelve days for a person to get sick after they get the chikungunya virus. (This period of time is called the virus's incubation period.) Usually, people get sick in three to seven days. Most people who get the virus (72% to 97%) get symptoms. \nChikungunya has an \"acute phase\", which lasts a short time, and a \"chronic phase\", which can last weeks, months, or years. \nAcute phase.\nThe acute phase usually begins with a sudden high fever that can last up to ten days. The fever is usually above 39\u00a0\u00b0C (102\u00a0\u00b0F), and can sometimes get as high as 40\u00a0\u00b0C (104\u00a0\u00b0F). About half of people with chikungunya get a rash, usually about two to five days after symptoms start. Some people also have gastrointestinal symptoms, like abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. In rare cases, people may get conjunctivitis or other problems with their eyes.\nThe body starts to fight the virus after about a week by sending out immunoglobulin M (IgM), which attacks the virus. After this, most of the symptoms usually start to get better. However, people often keep having some symptoms for about another week, like headache, insomnia (trouble sleeping), and exhaustion. After these symptoms end, the acute phase of chikungunya is usually over.\nChronic phase.\nIn chikungunya's chronic phase, almost everyone with the virus (87% - 98%) gets very bad joint pain or stiffness. This usually lasts for weeks or months. However, it can last for years. The joint pain can be so bad that a person cannot move the joints that hurt. The pain almost always happens in more than one joint. Usually, people have pain in the joints in their arms and legs, on both sides. These may include the joints in the wrists, ankles, hands, feet, shoulders, elbows, and knees. The virus can also cause pain in the muscles or ligaments.\nSometimes, it can be difficult to tell the difference between chikungunya and dengue fever. Both infections cause some of the same symptoms, like fever and very bad pain. However, chikungunya usually does not cause bleeding. If a person diagnosed with chikungunya has bleeding problems, they may:\nPrevention.\nThe best way for people to protect themselves from chikungunya is to protect themselves from mosquitoes in places where the disease is common. For example, people may use bug spray and mosquito nets, and wear long sleeves and long pants when they are outside. In places where chikungunya is common, governments can also do things to control the number of mosquitoes. For example, they can spray pesticides.\nThere is no vaccine for chikungunya. Scientists are doing experiments to try to make a vaccine. However, scientists say that even if they created a vaccine, people would still have to control mosquitoes to prevent chikungunya.\nTreatment.\nThere is no known treatment for chikungunya. No known anti-viral medicines (medicines which kill viruses) kill the chikungunya virus.\nMedical professionals can only give \"supportive care.\" This means they can only treat chikungunya's symptoms. For example, they may treat fever and joint pain with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like naproxen; painkillers like paracetamol (acetaminophen); and fluids. Aspirin is not given because it can make bleeding more likely to happen.\nChronic joint pain.\nScientists have not found any medication that helps everyone with chikungunya who has bad joint pain. There is some evidence that certain medicines may help people who have bad joint pain for more than two weeks. These medicines include:\nThese medicines do not help the symptoms of chikungunya during the acute phase.\nPrognosis.\nAbout 1 in 1000 people who get chikungunya die from the disease. People older than 65, newborn babies, and people with other medical problems are most likely to have the most dangerous problems. Chikungunya is especially dangerous for newborns because they can get the virus from their mothers during childbirth, and because newborns' immune systems have to grow before they work as well as adults'. This makes it much more difficult for newborns to fight off the virus.\nElderly people, and people who already have arthritis, are more likely to have chronic joint pain.\nEpidemiology.\nIn the past, chikungunya existed mostly in developing countries. However, more recently, there have been epidemics (where a very large number of people get the virus) in the Indian Ocean, the Pacific Islands, and the Americas.\nWhen chikungunya was first discovered in 1952, it was uncommon and happened only in West Africa. People usually got the disease during rainy seasons, because mosquitoes are more common during these times. Beginning in the 1960s, there were sometimes outbreaks in Asia and Africa. However, until 2005, chikungunya had been uncommon throughout the world.\nSince 2005, chikungunya has become much more common. It has caused large outbreaks in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. For example, in India, chikungunya re-appeared after 32 years where no Indian person had gotten the virus. Outbreaks have also happened in Europe, the Caribbean, and South America, where chikungunya had never spread before. A few people have also gotten chikungunya in the United States and Australia, where the virus had never lived before. \nIn 2005, there was a very large outbreak on R\u00e9union, an island in the Indian Ocean. Out of about 770,000 people who lived on the island, about 266,000 (over 1 in every 3 people) got chikungunya. In 2006, about 1.25 million people in India got the virus. \nChikungunya was recently spread to the Americas. From 2013-2014 in the Americas, 1,118,763 people have been thought to have the virus. Of these cases, 24,682 were proven to be chikungunya.\nSome scientists think that chikungunya has become much more common because of a change in the virus's genetic code. This change may have made it easier for the virus to make copies of itself in mosquito cells. It may have also allowed the virus to be spread more easily by the Asian tiger mosquito (\"Aedes albopictus\"). This is important because the Asian tiger mosquito lives in many more places than \"Aedes aegypti\", the other species of mosquito that spreads chikungunya to humans. \"Aedes aegypti\" lives only in tropical places. However, the Asian tiger mosquito spreads easily, and lives in Europe, the Americas, the Caribbean, Africa, and the Middle East.\nHistory.\nChikungunya was first described by Marion Robinson and W.H.R. Lumsden in 1955, after an outbreak in 1952 along the border between Mozambique and Tanganyika (now part of Tanzania). A group called the Makonde lived in this area. The word \"chikungunya\" probably comes from the Makonde language. It means \"that which bends up\" or \"to walk bent over.\" This describes how people with very bad joint pain from the virus would bend into unusual positions. \nThe first recorded outbreak of chikungunya may have been in 1779. Scientific evidence agrees that the virus evolved around the year 1700.\nChikungunya was once researched as a possible biological weapon."}

The Zika virus belongs to the genus \"Flavivirus\", like dengue fever and chikungunya. However, Zika fever is usually not as bad as those illnesses. Most people who get the Zika virus (60-80%) have no symptoms.\nPeople who do have symptoms usually have a low fever, conjunctivitis, joint pain (mainly in the hands and feet), and a rash. The rash often starts on the face and then spreads to the rest of the body. Usually, the symptoms are not very bad, and get better after 2 to 7 days.\nStarting in 2015, there has been an outbreak of Zika virus (meaning that many people have gotten the virus) in Brazil. Scientists think that when a woman with the Zika virus is pregnant, she can give the virus to her fetus. Scientists think this can cause microcephaly, a birth defect that causes a baby to have a smaller head than usual. This can cause intellectual disability and other problems in the brain, like seizures. Because of this, in January 2016, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned pregnant women not to travel to Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Martinique, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, Suriname, Venezuela, or Puerto Rico, because of the risk of getting the Zika virus there.\nIn places where the Zika virus lives, people are more likely to have birth defects, neurological problems like Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and autoimmune diseases.\nDiagnosis.\nDiagnosing Zika fever is difficult for a few reasons. First, Zika fever causes many of the same signs and symptoms as many other viruses. \nSecond, special laboratory tests have to be done to prove that a person has Zika virus. For example, when the virus is in a person's blood or urine, it can be found by using a special test that looks for the virus's RNA in the blood. However, the Zika virus often does not stay in the blood for very long. Also, because most people with the Zika virus have no symptoms, they do not know that they need to be tested. Blood tests that look for specific antibodies (which the body sends out to fight the Zika virus) can also be done. However, these tests are expensive and have to be done in special laboratories that do not exist everywhere. \nIf tests cannot prove that a person has Zika virus, it can be difficult to figure out whether a person has Zika fever or a different infection. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that before doctors diagnose a person with Zika fever, they should think about whether the person could have one of many other infections. Examples of these infections include:\nTransmission.\nHumans get the Zika virus after being bitten by mosquitoes from the \"Aedes\" genus. Scientists have proven that at least eight different species of mosquitoes from the \"Aedes\" genus can spread the Zika virus to humans. Mosquitoes pick up the Zika virus after they bite other animals that have the virus.\nZika virus can be passed from one person to another during sexual intercourse. It can also be passed from a mother to her fetus during pregnancy.\nPrevention.\nThere is no vaccine for Zika virus, though the United States National Institutes of Health is trying to make one. \nThe best way for a person to protect themselves against the Zika virus is to protect themselves against mosquitoes. For example, if people are traveling to places where the Zika virus lives, they should:\nTreatment.\nToday, there is no treatment or cure for Zika fever. Medical professionals can only give \"supportive care,\" which means they can only treat the virus's symptoms. For example, they can give medicines to help with pain, fever, and itching. However, some scientists say that doctors should not give medicines like aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are commonly used for pain and fever. This is because people with similar viruses who take these medicines have been more likely to have bleeding problems.\nThere are no known anti-viral medications (medicines which kill viruses) which will kill the Zika virus.\nBecause there are no treatments that will cure the Zika virus once a person has it, scientists suggest that pregnant women do everything they can to avoid getting the virus. Once a pregnant woman has the Zika virus, there is nothing anyone can do to keep her fetus from getting infected too.\nEpidemiology.\nZika fever was first discovered in 1947, in a rhesus monkey in the Zika Forest in Uganda. The first human cases were reported in Nigeria in 1954. A few outbreaks have been reported in tropical Africa and in some parts of Southeast Asia, but not India. In 1977\u20131978, Zika virus caused fevers in Indonesia.\nThe first major outbreak happened in 2007 in Micronesia's Yap Islands. 185 people were proven to have the Zika virus. This was the first time Zika fever had been reported outside Africa and Asia. In 2013, another large outbreak happened in French Polynesia.\nIn May 2015, Brazil officially reported its first 16 cases of Zika fever. By November 2015, Zika fever had appeared in 14 states in Brazil. Zika virus is thought to have caused 2,400 cases of microcephaly and 29 infant deaths in Brazil in 2015.\nSince first appearing in the Western Hemisphere in February 2014, Zika fever has spread quickly throughout South America and Central America. It appeared in Mexico in November 2015.\nOn January 24, 2016, the World Health Organization warned that the Zika virus is likely to spread to nearly all countries of the Americas. This is likely since the mosquito that spreads the virus, \"Aedes aegypti\", lives in all of the countries in the Americas, except for Canada and Chile.\nOn February 1, 2016, the World Health Organization said that the Zika virus was a \"public health emergency.\" They also said the Zika virus was \"spreading explosively\" (very quickly), and that in the next year, as many as 3 million to 4 million people could get the virus."}

Zika fever often causes no symptoms, or only mild symptoms. Scientists know that people in Africa and Asia have been getting Zika fever since the 1950s. In 2014, the virus spread eastward across the Pacific Ocean - first to French Polynesia, then to Easter Island. Finally, in 2015, it spread to Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, and South America. In these places, Zika virus has become a pandemic.\nBackground.\nZika virus is related to West Nile virus and the viruses that cause dengue fever, yellow fever, and Japanese encephalitis. Zika virus causes an illness that is like a mild form of dengue fever. It is treated by rest. As of 2016, there is no medication or vaccine that can prevent the Zika virus. \nPregnant women who get the Zika virus can spread the virus to their fetuses. When they are born, these newborns may be more likely to have microcephaly. In places where the Zika virus lives, people are more likely to have birth defects, neurological problems like Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and autoimmune diseases.\n2016 outbreak.\nIn January 2016, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published advice for how to avoid getting Zika fever. They suggested that when traveling to places where Zika virus lives:\nOther governments or health agencies soon issued similar travel warnings. Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, and Jamaica advised women not to get pregnant until scientists know more about the risks of Zika virus to pregnant women. \nOn February 2, 2016, public health officials in Dallas County, Texas, reported the first case of somebody getting Zika virus in the United States."}

It is part of the Bill of Rights. The Fourth amendment was adopted in response to the abuse of the writ of assistance, a type of general search warrant issued by the British government. It was a major source of tension in pre-Revolutionary America. The Fourth Amendment was introduced in Congress in 1789 by James Madison, along with the other amendments in the Bill of Rights. They were proposed in response to Anti-Federalist objections to the new Constitution. \nCongress sent 12 amendments to the states in August of 1789. Of these, 10 were approved by the states. The last state, Virginia ratified the amendments (including the fourth amendment) on December 15, 1791. On March 1, 1792, Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson announced the adoption of the amendment.\nThe Bill of Rights did initially apply to the states. Also, federal criminal investigations were less common in the first century of the nation's history. For these reasons there is little case law for the Fourth Amendment before the 20th century. The amendment was held to apply to the states in \"Mapp v. Ohio\" (1961).\nUnder the Fourth Amendment, search and seizure (including arrest) should be limited in scope to specific information supplied to the issuing court. This is usually by a law enforcement officer who has sworn by it. Fourth Amendment case law deals with three central questions. What government activities constitute \"search\" and \"seizure\"? What constitutes probable cause for these actions? How should violations of Fourth Amendment rights be addressed? Early court decisions limited the amendment's scope to a law enforcement officer's physical intrusion onto private property. But with \"Katz v. United States\" (1967), the Supreme Court held that its protections, such as the warrant requirement, extend to the privacy of individuals as well as physical locations. Law enforcement officers need a warrant for most search and seizure activities. But the Court has defined a series of exceptions for consent searches, motor vehicle searches, evidence in plain view, exigent circumstances, border searches, and other situations.\nThe exclusionary rule is one way the amendment is enforced. Established in \"Weeks v. United States\" (1914), this rule holds that evidence obtained through a Fourth Amendment violation is generally inadmissible at criminal trials. Evidence discovered as a later result of an illegal search may also be inadmissible as \"fruit of the poisonous tree,\" unless it inevitably would have been discovered by legal means."}

It happens in people (especially children) who do not get enough food. A healthy person gets energy from eating food, especially foods with protein and fat in them. Because a person with marasmus is not getting enough food, they do not get the energy they need to survive. This is due to deficiency of both proteins and calories. Generally, this disease when there is an immediate second pregnancy or repeated child births. Lean and weak, swelling limbs, less developed muscles, dry skin, diarrhoea, etc.., are the symptoms of this disease.\nChildren with marasmus look emaciated (very skinny). This is because their bodies have burned up all of their fat and muscles to make energy. The child's body weight will be less than 60% of a normal child his or her age.\nMarasmus can be treated. However, about half of children with bad malnutrition die because they cannot get treatment where they live.\nThe word \u201cmarasmus\u201d comes from the Greek word \u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 \"marasmos\" (meaning \"decay \")\nSigns and symptoms.\nMost children with marasmus look shrunken and have lost most of their muscles and body fat.

This can cause problems like:\nOther symptoms of marasmus include:\nCauses.\nMarasmus is caused by a deficiency (not having enough) of nearly all nutrients, especially protein, carbohydrates, and lipids (fats).\nTreatment.\nMarasmus can be treated by giving emergency nutrients and fluids.

They can cause severe chemical burns, which then cause painful water blisters, on both the outside and the inside of the body. (This is why these chemicals are called \"blister agents.\") Throughout history, blister agents have been used for chemical warfare.\nSome blister agents are used to treat medical problems - for example, to remove warts. However, they must be used very carefully. If a person accidentally gets even a little bit of the chemical in their mouth, they can die.\nTypes of blister agents.\nThere are three major types of blister agents.\nMustard agents.\nMustard agents are also called \"sulfur mustards\" or \"mustard gas.\" They are a group of blister agents that have sulfur in them. When they are mixed with other chemicals to be used in chemical warfare, mustard agents are a yellowish-brown color, and smell like mustard plants. This is why they got the name \"mustard agents.\"\nThroughout history, many different types and mixtures of sulfur mustards have been used. Mustard agents were first used as a chemical weapon by the German Army during World War I. More recently, in September 2015, the United States said that the terrorist group The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) was making and using sulfur mustard in Syria and Iraq.\nNitrogen mustards.\nNitrogen mustards are similar to sulfur mustards, but they have nitrogen in them instead of sulfur. While some countries stockpiled (gathered a lot of) nitrogen mustards during World War II, nitrogen mustards have never been used as chemical weapons. In fact, today, they are mainly used to treat medical problems. A few nitrogen mustards are too poisonous to be used for anything but chemical weapons. But many others are used as chemotherapy medications to treat cancer.\nLewisite.\nLewisite was first created in 1904. The United States experimented with using lewisite as a chemical weapon in the 1920s and during World War II. However, lewisite did not work well because it smelled like geraniums (a type of flower) and made people's eyes water. Enemy soldiers would smell the chemical and realize their eyes were watering, and would put on gas masks to protect themselves.\nIn the 1940s, British scientists made an antidote to lewisite, called dimercaprol (or \"British anti-Lewisite\"). After this, lewisite was no longer as useful as other blister agents, and countries stopped using it.\nEffects of blister agents.\nBlister agents can cause many different symptoms. These symptoms are very painful, and can kill a person. Symptoms include: \nAll blister agents easily enter the body through the eyes, lungs, and skin. \nLewisite causes symptoms right away. However, mustard agents do not. When they are breathed in, symptoms usually do not appear for 4 to 6 hours. When mustard agents get on the skin, symptoms can take 2 to 48 hours to appear."}

It includes extramarital sex and premarital sex. It also includes adultery (consensual sexual relations outside marriage). Zina covers fornication (consensual sexual intercourse between two unmarried persons), and homosexuality (consensual sexual relations between same-sex partners).\nIn the four schools of Sunni fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), and the two schools of Shi'a fiqh, the term zin\u0101\u02be is a sin of sexual intercourse that is not allowed by Sharia (Islamic law) and classed as a hudud crime (class of Islamic punishments that are fixed for certain crimes that are considered to be \"claims of God\"). To prove an act of zina, a qadi (religious judge) in a sharia court relies on an unmarried woman's pregnancy, the confession in the name of Allah, or four witnesses to the actual act of penetration. The last two types of prosecutions are uncommon. Most cases of zina in the history of Islam have been pregnant unmarried women. In some schools of Islamic law, a pregnant woman accused of zina who denies sex was consensual must prove she was raped with four eyewitnesses testifying before the court. This has led to many cases where rape victims have been punished for zina. Pressing charges of zina without required eyewitnesses is considered slander (Qadhf, \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0630\u0641) in Islam, itself a hudud crime.\nThe above sense of \"zina\" is not to be confused with the woman's name \"Zina\" or \"Zeina\" (\u0632\u064a\u0646\u0629). The name has a different linguistic root (Greek \"xen\"-). It also has a different meaning (\"guest, stranger\"), is pronounced differently (either Z\u012bnah or Zaynah), and is usually spelled differently."}

{"id": "529986", "revid": "2133", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=529986", "title": "Middle Passage", "text": "The Middle Passage was the part of the Atlantic slave trade where African slaves were brought to the Americas on slave ships. Millions of African people were shipped to the Americas over the Middle Passage.\nEnslaved people were treated so badly on the slave ships that about 15% of them died during the Middle Passage. Even more were killed before they left Africa, when slave traders were trying to kidnap them and force them onto the slave ships. Historians think that up to two million African people died during the Middle Passage. However, somewhere between 9.4 million and 12 million African people survived the Middle Passage, and arrived in the Americas as slaves.\nThe triangular trade.\nThe Transatlantic Trading of Enslaved Human Beings from African Heritage had three different parts. Because of this, it was called \"the triangular trade.\" The Middle Passage got its name because it was the middle part of the triangular trade. The three parts of the Atlantic slave trade were:\n(1) Europe to Africa\n(3) The Americas to Europe\nThe enslaved peoples' journey.\nAfter being kidnapped, enslaved African people were usually forcibly marched to forts along the coast of western Africa. There they were sold to European and American human traffickers. They might have to wait in these forts, which were like prisons, for months before slave ships arrived.\nEnslaved people were then packed onto the slave ships. Often, they were packed together as closely as possible. (The famous drawing on the right shows how closely enslaved people were packed together on some slave ships.) Enslaved men were often chained together at the ankles. Sometimes, slaves were allowed to move around during the day, but many ships kept enslaved people chained up for the entire trip.\nSailing through the Middle Passage could take anywhere from one to six months, depending on the weather. Over time, human trafficking ships got better at making the trip more quickly. In the early 16th century, the average trip took a few months. However, by the 19th century, many slave ships crossed the Middle Passage in fewer than six weeks.\nLiving conditions.\nEnslaved people were treated barbarically and wickedly during the Middle Passage. Slaves were not seen as human. They were thought of as \"cargo\" or \"goods\" - commodities rather than innocent people - to be bought and sold, and not respected and cared about.\nEnslaved people were starved during the Middle Passage. At \"best\", the enslavers fed enslaved people beans, corn, yams, rice, and palm oil. However, enslaved African people were not always fed every day. If there was not enough food for the sailors (human traffickers) and the slaves, the enslavers would eat first, and the enslaved might not get any food. On some slave ships, slaves who looked sick were not given any food. Many enslaved people died from starvation and dehydration (not having enough water) during the Middle Passage.\nThe enslaved peoples' living conditions on the slave ships were horrific. Diseases spread very quickly because the enslaved people were so crowded together, and because there was no sanitation. The most common diseases were dysentery, scurvy, smallpox, syphilis, and measles. Many enslaved African people were killed by disease during the Middle Passage. On longer trips, even more enslaved people died, because there was less food and water (this made dysentery and scurvy more common). Also, many slaves became too depressed to eat.\nSlaves were often tortured as punished if they did not follow the human traffickers' orders or if they seemed disobedient in any way. For example, enslaved people who were too depressed or sick to eat might be beaten or whipped. The worst forms of torture were for enslaved people who tried to rebel (fight back). For example, one slave ship captain punished an enslaved person who tried to rebel, by murdering him; then he forced two other slaves to eat his heart and liver.\nEnslaved women and enslaved children were often raped or sexually abused by the sailors.\nParticipants.\nMany different people participated in the Middle Passage and the triangular trade. \nWorld powers.\nThe countries that controlled most of the slave trade were European and Asian countries that were very powerful at the time. These countries included:\nSlave traders in North America, Brazil, and the Caribbean also took part in the slave trade.\nDifferent countries were more powerful in the slave trade at different times. For example, for two hundred years, from 1440\u20131640, Portugal controlled most of the slave trade. However, over time, the balance of power in Europe changed. By the 18th century, the British Empire was much more powerful. During the 18th century, when 6 million Africans were brought over the Middle Passage, British slavers carried almost 2.5 million of them.\nAfricans.\nMost of the African slaves came from eight different areas:\nSlave traders.\nThe slave trade was very profitable for slave traders. By the late 18th century, a strong male slave could be sold for about $600 to $1500 (which is about $9,000 to $15,000 in United States dollars today). Because of this, kidnapping people in Africa and selling them into slavery became more and more popular. Historians think that African warlords, kings, and private kidnappers - Europeans, Americans, and Africans alike - all participated in kidnapping people into slavery."}

Living conditions for slaves on these ships was inhuman. Men, women and children were crowded into every possible space leaving no room to move or even breathe. There was little food and the smell could not be described. Between 1526 and 1867 about 12.5 million slaves were sent by slave ships from Africa to the Americas. But only about 10.7 million slaves actually arrived. Of all human migrations it was the most costly in terms of human lives lost. The average time to sail across the Atlantic took from 60 to 90 days. Sometimes the trips took up to four months.\nSaleable slaves.\nShip captains were under orders by slavers to deliver only saleable slaves. Starving, sick or troublesome slaves were often thrown overboard into the ocean to drown. Sometimes Africans were kept on deck chained together with long chains. There were times when they would jump overboard, taking every other chained slave with them, to avoid their unknown fate. Many ships kept extra crew members on deck to prevent this from happening. At other times crew members would throw slaves overboard as a warning to other slaves. If the ship was running out of food or water, all the slaves would be killed to save the crew from starving.\n\"Zong\" massacre.\nSlave ships could at times get insurance on their cargos of slaves. But insurance would not pay if the slavers starved the slaves or they got sick. Insurance paid out if the slaves drowned, but not if they were severely starved to death. In 1781 the slave ship \"Zong\" was hauling 470 slaves\u2014more than the ship could handle. Many began to get sick. By the time the ship reached the Doldrums, a mid-Atlantic region that at times had no wind, several of the crew had died from the spreading diseases. To save themselves, the remaining crew threw 132 dying and sick slaves into the ocean. Another 10 slaves jumped with them. When they tried to collect the insurance the Insurance underwriter denied the claim. In 1782 in a court in Jamaica, ruled for the owners. The insurance company appealed the decision. This brought a good deal of public attention. It began to be called the \"Zong\" massacre. No member of the crew or the owners were ever charged with murder. \nSlave ship takeovers.\nAbout 15% to 20% of the ships leaving Africa never arrived in the Americas. In thousands of cases the crews were overtaken by captured slaves, some of them warriors. Often the crew was killed and the Africans managed to sail back to Africa. In other cases the ships were lost at sea.\nSome of the documented slave ship revolts are:"}

In the simplest case, this means that a function needs to be minimized or maximized. \nMany problems are more complex, though, and solving them analytically is not feasible: in these cases, numerical methods are often used.\nThe first step is usually to take the derivative of the initial function. From here maxima or minima can be found within a domain by simply finding the critical points. These include domain (x) values where the differentiated function equals 0 or does not exist. Simply finding critical points is not enough to determine maxima or minima. The final step to determining a maximum, minimum, or neither can be one of two methods.\n(1) X values lesser and lesser than the critical point must be substituted into the differentiated function to determine if the values change sign. If they go from negative to positive, the critical point is a minimum. If they go from positive to negative, the critical point is a maximum. If neither occurs, the point is neither. This is known as the first derivative test.\n(2) The derivative of the differentiated function can be taken, creating a second-order derivative. The critical point must be substituted into the second derivative. If the output is positive, the critical point is a minimum. If the output is negative, the critical point is a maximum. This is known as the second derivative test.\nApplications.\nThe application of optimization span many fields. A simple example is attempting to find the smallest possible difference in the distance of two objects in two-dimensional space (x and y). In this context, the derivative of the function that gives the difference is taken in order to find the minimum. A more complicated example is in Machine Learning, in which the optimization function attempts to find the global minimum of the loss function in order to minimize the difference or loss between the algorithm\u2019s predictions and the actual values. This example is more difficult as Machine learning algorithms often utilize multidimensional data usually in the form of tensors yielding more complicated functions.\nRelated software.\nToday, there are many tools to support optimization studies:"}

This is mainly in Western Asia, North Africa, Southeast Africa, the Horn of Africa. It also includes parts of Europe (such as Iberia and Sicily) beginning during the era of the Muslim conquests and continuing into the 20th century. The trade was conducted through slave markets in the Middle East, North Africa and the Horn of Africa. Most of the slaves were from Africa's interior.\nHistorians estimate that between 650 AD and the 1960s, 10 to 18 million people were enslaved by Arab slave traders. They were taken from Europe, Asia and Africa across the Red Sea, Indian Ocean, and Sahara desert.\nHistory.\nThe Arab trade of Zanj (Bantu) slaves in Southeast Africa is one of the oldest slave trades. It was going on 700 years before the European Atlantic slave trade. Male slaves were often employed as servants, soldiers, or workers by their owners. Most male slaves were castrated. It is estimated that as many as 6 out of every 10 boys bled to death during the process. But the high price of Eunuchs made it worthwhile. Woman and children taken as slaves were mainly used as servants and concubines. While the later Atlantic slave trade concentrated on men for labor, the Arab slave trade shifted over time to concentrate more on woman and young girls for sexual purposes.\nModern slavery in Africa.\nIn Mauritania slavery was abolished legally in 1980. But Muslim Berbers still own an estimated 90,000 African slaves. This is despite the fact that African Mauritanians converted to Islam over a hundred years ago and the Qur\u2019an does not allow Muslims to enslave other Muslims. Slaves are used for farm labor, concubines and domestic servants. The children remain the property of their masters. They can be bought, sold, or exchanged for trucks, camels or guns. \nSlavery in Sudan is active again with the Muslim north waging war against Animists and Christians in the south. In these raids almost all slaves are taken from the tribes in the Nuba Mountains. Government sponsored Arab militias often kill the men and enslave women and children. Those taken slaves are forced to convert to Islam. Those that refuse are put to death. The trafficking in woman and children in Western and Southern Africa violates the 1948 UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights."}

The 20th century \nSenegambia Confederation, was a loose confederation between Senegal and Gambia. The term Senegambia was used by the British as early as 1765. They used it to refer to their settlements on the islands off the coast of present day Senegal. The modern use of the term Senegambia means the region that includes both Senegal and Gambia.\nSenegambian history.\nThere is little known about the early history of the area. By about 1000 AD the Soninke, Mandinka and Fula peoples had formed settlements along the Gambia River. The Toucouleur people were settled in east and central Senegal. Kingdoms such as the Jolof and the Sere settled in the area north of the Gambia River. The first Europeans, Portuguese sailors, arrived about 1455. Portugal controlled the area between the S\u00e9n\u00e9gal and Gambia Rivers until the British, Dutch and French moved into the area. They traded goods such as salt, iron, guns and gunpowder for gold, ivory, ebony and slaves. \nSenegambia and the Middle Passage.\nAbout 24% of the African slaves brought to America, were from Senegambia. The Africans from Senegambia were found nearly everywhere in the United States before the American Civil War, both in the North and South.Senegambia was strongly Muslim. This means that many African slaves in the US had been exposed to Islam much more than the rest of the Americas. \nBecause of the need for field workers up to two-thirds of Africans taken captive were men. In the Senegambia region due to the high demand by buyers, men and boys were taken from all over the region. Women, however, being in less demand, were taken from the easily accessed coastal areas. Most of them belonged to the Jolof people and so, unlike the men, they had a common language. Due to the fear of slaves revolting, men were kept below decks and in chains.

A prefix can be added to the name to show the number of faces that the model can display, including the two faces (back and front) that are visible before flexing. For example, a hexaflexagon with a total of six faces is called a hexahexaflexagon.\nHistory.\nDiscovery and introduction.\nArthur H. Stone, a British man, is said to have first discovered the flexagon in 1939. At the time, he was a student at Princeton University in the United States. His new American paper would not fit in his English binder so he cut off the ends of the paper and began folding them into different shapes. One of these formed a trihexaflexagon. \nOther students became interested in these shapes. They included Bryant Tuckerman, Richard Feynman, and John Tukey. Together, they formed the Princeton Flexagon Committee. Tuckerman worked out a topological method, called the \"Tuckerman traverse\", for revealing all the faces of a flexagon.\nFlexagons were introduced to the general public by the recreational mathematician Martin Gardner in 1956. He wrote about in the first \"Mathematical Games\" column that he wrote for \"Scientific American\" magazine.\nAttempted commercial development.\nIn 1955, Russell Rogers and Leonard D'Andrea of Homestead Park, Pennsylvania applied for a patent. In 1959 they were granted U.S. Patent number 2,883,195 for the hexahexaflexagon, under the title \"Changeable Amusement Devices and the Like.\" \nTheir patent imagined possible ways that the device could be used as a toy, an device for advertising, or as a device for learning about geometry.\" A few such novelties were produced by the Herbick &amp; Held Printing Company in Pittsburgh. The device, marketed as the \"Hexmo\", were not very successful."}

With the landing and advance of General Douglas MacArthur in late 1944, it was feared the Japanese would move the prisoners to Japan or kill them. On January 30, 1945, during World War II, United States Army Rangers, Alamo Scouts, and Filipino guerrillas liberated 511 prisoners from the camp. The daring raid is still studied by Army Rangers today as a classic example.\nBackground.\nAfter the Attack on Pearl Harbor by the Empire of Japan on December 7, 1941, the United States declared war on Japan and its allies. At the same time the Japanese also attacked the American bases at Guam, Wake Island and the Philippines. While Guam and Wake Island soon fell, Filipino and U.S. forces resisted in the Philippines until early May 1942. By this time, the Japanese controlled nearly all of Southeast Asia. The Bataan peninsula and the island of Corregidor were the only remaining Allied strongholds in the region. On April 9, 1942 about 11,800 American, 66,000 Filipino and 1,000 Chinese-Filipinos surrendered to the Japanese. They were starving, sick and fatigued, yet were forced to march 60 miles (97 km) with many dying along the way. This was the infamous Bataan Death March. Many also escaped and joined guerrilla forces hiding in the mountains. About 79,000 survived and were imprisoned at Camp O'Donnell. The American and Filipino forces on Island of Corregidor surrendered on May 6, 1942. The approximately 79,000 forces captured on Corregidor were not a part of the Death March. They were loaded onto cargo ships and taken to Manila. There they were marched through the streets as a celebration of the Japanese victory. They were then sent to Cabanatuan camp number 1 near Cabanatuan city. They were joined by other American prisoners from Camp O'Donnell.\nConditions at Cabanatuan.\nBy January of 1945, after nearly three years at the camp, nearly 3,000 prisoners had died. The camp measured about by and was enclosed by 3 barbed wire fences, each high. There were guard towers outside the fence. The prisoners were kept in 8 barracks originally designed to house 40 soldiers, but were used to hold 120 prisoners each. Conditions at the camp in 1942 were terrible with mosquitoes that carried malaria and flies that spreading dysentery. Many prisoners were murdered by the guards. Local Filipinos smuggled in food and money to bribe the guards. But by 1944 the conditions became worse. The Japanese cut rations and cut down on the smuggling of food to prisoners. They started sending prisoners to camps in Japan and Manchuria in \"hellships\". By early 1945 just over 500 prisoners were left in Cabanatuan number 1 camp.\nAmerican invasion of the Philippines.\nOn January 9, 1945, American forces led by General Douglas MacArthur invaded Luzon. A few months earlier, Japan had issued a \"kill-all\" order. Any camp that was in danger of being taken by American forces was to kill all the prisoners. The prisoners at Cabanatuan were not aware of the danger they were in. But MacArthur had become aware of the order. The Japanese had executed all but 11 of 150 prisoners at a POW camp on Palawan, in the Philippines. The 11 managed to escape the massacre by hiding. MacArthur did not want this happening at Cabanatuan. As the Americans came to within from the camp, the prisoners were now in immediate danger. A plan to rescue the prisoners was hastily put together.\n6th Ranger Battalion.\nOne of the units MacArthur had available to him was the 6th Ranger Battalion. Because of their training, they were qualified to operate behind enemy lines. They were commanded by Lieutenant colonel Henry Mucci. In mid-October 1944 they landed ahead of the main American forces to destroy enemy positions and radio stations guarding the entrance to Leyte Gulf. When the 6th Army landed at Luzon, the 6th Ranger Battalion was with them. As the 6th Army moved into central Luzon, General Walter Krueger, commander of the 6th Army, learned about the camp from American officers who had remained in Luzon with the Filipino guerrillas.\nPlanning the raid.\nNot only was the camp 30 miles behind enemy lines, it had a large number of Japanese troops in the area. The POW camp at Cabanatuan itself was also housing Japanese troops. Mucci put together a force made up of Rangers and two teams of Alamo Scouts. The total force would be 8 officers and 120 enlisted men. All the men carefully studied aerial photographs, maps and diagrams showing the objectives and rendezvous points. The two teams of Alamo Scouts left on January 27 to connect with local guerilla forces and keep the camp under close surveillance. The Rangers would join them just before the attack. On January 29 the Rangers met up with Filipino guerillas five miles north of the camp. Mucci received reports of heavy Japanese troop movements in the area. The raid was put on hold for 24 hours. He learned there were 90 guards in the camp but also a force of 150 soldiers were staying there temporarily. Mucci arranged to have 50 oxcarts ready near the river to carry the prisoners too weak to walk. The raid was now planned for January 30 as night began to fall. Mucci also found a major asset in Filipino Captain Juan Pajota. He knew the area well and he was the one to warn Mucci to wait 24 hours until some of the Japanese moved on.\nThe raid.\nOn the evening of the raid, Filipino guerrillas cut the Japanese phone lines to Manila. They then blocked the two roads passing the camp to prevent other Japanese units from helping the camp guards. The Rangers had to crawl about a mile through an open field. To prevent the guards from seeing them when they got close, Mucci had arranged for a P-61 night fighter to fly over the camp and distract the guards. They split up to attack the front and back gates to the compound. The force broke into the camp and quickly killed the guards. The problems started when the prisoners hid from their rescuers. Not recognizing the uniforms they thought the shooting meant they were all being killed. They finally convinced the prisoners to go with them. One British civilian prisoner hid from his rescuers and did not go with them. But he was picked up by the Filipino guerrillas and taken to safety. One prisoner died of a heart attack during the rescue. The Filipinos and Alamo Scouts held off the Japanese while the Rangers got the prisoners to the carts to haul them to safety. There were 6 Rangers who acted as a rearguard and were the last to leave the camp. They came under fire from the Japanese killing one of the Rangers. At the river a guerrila doctor treated the wounded and Filipinos from nearby villages gave the prisoners food and water. The Rangers with the prisoners traveled all night to get back to the American lines. Only two Rangers, Corporal Roy Sweezy and Captain Fisher, were killed in the rescue. The raid was one of the most spectacular and successful rescues in military history. They killed or wounded an estimated 523 Japanese soldiers during the raid while rescuing 511 prisoners.\nPopular media.\nIn 2005 the movie \"The Great Raid\" was released on the 60th anniversary of VJ day. It was based on the book \"The Great Raid on Cabanatuan\". The movie had a number of factual errors in it. The plane that flew overhead was a Lockheed Hudson and not a P-61 \"Black Widow\", which was the actual plane. The camp was not lit up with electric lights as in the movie. No prisoners were executed during the raid. Also many of Rangers, Alamo Scouts and Filipinos were given fictitious names. "}

It was his first novel, published in 1929. It is thought to be partly about his own life. The story is set during World War I.\nPlot.\n\"Death of a Hero\" is the story of a young English artist named George Winterbourne who enlists in the army at the beginning of World War I. The story is told by an unnamed narrator, who speaks in the first person. The narrator claims to have known and served with the main character. The story is divided into three parts.\nBook I.\nThe first part details George's family history. His father, a middle-class man from England's countryside, marries a poor woman who falsely believes she is marrying into a monied family. After George's birth, his mother has a series of lovers.\nGeorge is brought up to be a proper and patriotic member of English society. He is encouraged to learn his father's insurance business, but fails to do so. After a disagreement with his parents, he relocates to London to become an artist and live a socialite lifestyle.\nBook II.\nThe second section of the book deals with George's London life. He ingrains himself in socialite society and engages a number of trendy philosophies.\nAfter he and his lover, Elizabeth, have a pregnancy scare, they decide to marry. Although they do not have a child, the marriage endures. They decide to leave their marriage open. George takes Elizabeth's close friend as a lover, however, and their marriage begins to fall apart. Just as the situation is becoming particularly heated, England declares war on Germany. George decides to enlist.\nBook III.\nGeorge trains for the army and is sent to France. (No particular location in France is mentioned. The town behind the front where George spends much of his time is referred to as M---.) He fights on the front for some time. When he returns home, he finds that he has been so affected by the war that he cannot relate to his friends, including his wife and lover.\nThe casualty rate among officers is particularly high at the front. When a number of officers in George's unit are killed, he is promoted. Upon spending time with the other officers, he finds them to be cynical and utilitarian. He loses faith in the war quickly.\nThe story ends with George standing up during a machine-gun barrage. He is killed.\nAt the end of the book there is a poem written from the point of view of a veteran comparing World War I to the Trojan War.\nCensorship.\nAldington was a veteran of World War I. He claimed that his novel was accurate in terms of speech and style. It contains a lot of colloquial speech, including profanity, discussion of sexuality and graphic descriptions of the war and of life in the trenches. There was extensive censorship in England and many war novels had been banned or burned as a result. When Aldington first published his novel, he removed or changed a number of sentences in order to make sure the book was published. He insisted that his publishers include a disclaimer in the original printing of the book with the following text:\nTo my astonishment, my publisher informed me that certain words, phrases, sentences, and even passages, are at present taboo in England. I have recorded nothing which I have not observed in human life, said nothing I do not believe to be true. [...] At my request the publishers are removing what they believe would be considered objectionable, and are placing asterisks to show where omissions have been made. [...] In my opinion it is better for the book to appear mutilated than for me to say what I don't believe. "}

The other group is the barn owls, Tytonidae. \nThe little owl is a small, mainly nocturnal species. It is found in a range of habitats such as farmland, woodland fringes, steppes and semi-deserts. It is camouflaged, and especially hard to see if the background is wood or stone covered with lichen. It feeds on insects, earthworms, other invertebrates and small vertebrates such as mice and shrews. \nMales have territories which they defend against intruders. This owl is a cavity nester and a clutch of about four eggs is laid in spring. The female does the incubation and the male brings food to the nest, first for the female and later for the newly hatched young. As the chicks grow, both parents hunt and bring them food, and the chicks leave the nest at about seven weeks of age.\nThere are thirteen recognized subspecies of little owl spread across Europe and Asia."}

Wells", "text": "Ida Bell Wells-Barnett (July 16, 1862 \u2013 March 25, 1931), also known as Ida B. Wells, was an African-American journalist, suffragist and women's rights advocate. She was born a slave in Holly Springs, Mississippi during the American Civil War. Wells grew up to become a teacher in Memphis, Tennessee. She became co-owner of a local newspaper \"The Free Speech and Headlight\". She wrote editorials using the pen name \"Iola\". Many of her editorials were about the problems of African-Americans in the era of Jim Crow laws. She became a full-time journalist after being dismissed from her teaching job. Wells was an early pioneer in the civil rights movement. In 1909, Wells was one of the founders of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).\nWells is buried at Oak Woods Cemetery in Greater Grand Crossing, Chicago, Illinois.\nEarly career.\nOn May 4, 1884, a train conductor ordered Wells to give up her seat in a nice car and move to a crowded car. At the time, railroad companies were allowed to separate their passengers by race. Wells refused to give up her seat. The conductor and two men dragged her out of the car. Wells fought back and even bit the conductor on the hand. Wells wrote a newspaper article for \"The Living Way,\" an article for black people, about her treatment on the train. She hired a black lawyer to sue the railroad. The railroad paid her lawyer to not work for her, so Wells hired a white lawyer. She won her case on December 24, 1884. The local court granted her a $500 award. The railroad company then took the case to the Tennessee Supreme Court. That court decided against Wells in 1887. Wells was ordered to pay money to the court. She responded saying she felt sad and disappointed because she had hoped that her lawsuit would help her fellow black Americans: \"I felt so disappointed because I had hoped such great things from my suit for my people...O God, is there no...justice in this land for us?\"\nWhile teaching elementary school, the \"Evening Star,\" a newspaper in Washington, D.C., offered Wells an editorial job. She also wrote weekly articles for \"The Living Way\" weekly newspaper under the pen name \"Iola.\" She became recognized for writing about the problems black people faced. In 1889, she became co-owner and editor of \"Free Speech and Headlight,\" a newspaper against separation by ethnicity. This newspaper published articles about injustices against black Americans. In 1891, Wells was dismissed from her teaching post by the Memphis Board of Education because of her articles that complained about conditions in the local schools for black students. Wells was sad but she didn't give up. She focused on writing articles for \"The Living Way\" and \"Free Speech and Headlight\".\nIn 1889, Thomas Moss, a friend of Wells, opened the Peoples Grocery. The grocery store did well and competed with a grocery store across the street that was owned by a white man. In 1892, Wells went out of town. While she was gone, a mob of white people invaded her friend's store. During the fight, three white men were shot and injured. Moss and two other black men, named McDowell and Stewart, were arrested and jailed, waiting for their trial. A large mob of white people stormed the jail and killed the three men. After the murder of her friends, Wells wrote in \"Free Speech and Headlight,\" suggesting that blacks leave Memphis altogether: Wells talked about the public nature of the murders. More than 6,000 black people did leave Memphis. Other people decided not to use businesses owned by white people. Some people said they would hurt Wells, so she bought a pistol. She later said that the people who bullied her were mad because she told just a little bit of the truth: \"They had made me an exile and threatened my life for hinting at the truth.\""}

These materials are very dangerous, and can hurt many people. When they are used on purpose, CBRNE materials are weapons of mass destruction. However, CBRNE events can also happen accidentally.\nA report from the White House in 2011 said \"there is no greater danger to the [United States] than a terrorist attack with a weapon of mass destruction.\" Because CBRNE weapons are so dangerous, countries around the world are working on preventing CBRNE attacks, and learning how to react to them if they do happen.\nTypes of CBRNE weapons.\nChemical.\nThe main types of chemical weapons are:\nInternational laws make it illegal to use chemical weapons. However, terrorists have ignored these laws. For example, in 1995, terrorists attacked the subway in Tokyo, Japan, with sarin.\nBiological.\nThe goal of biological weapons is to get as many people sick with infectious diseases as possible. Types of biological weapons include:\nIn 2001, a terrorist used a biological weapon against the United States by sending letters filled with anthrax through the mail to many different people. Ricin has also been sent through the mail as a biological attack.\nRadiological.\nA radiological weapon is any kind of weapon that spreads radiation. For example:\nIn 2006, Alexander Litvinenko, a former Russian spy, was murdered when someone put polonium-210, a radioactive material, in his food.\nThe White House's report says that there is radiological material all around the world that is not guarded.\nNuclear.\nN is for Nuclear explosion. This can occur one of two ways Fissure and Fusion. Fissure occurs when an atom is spliced apart forming two new atoms. This causes a discharge of energy. Fusion on the other hand forces two atoms together. The process breaks apart the atoms and fuses them together. The reaction discharges energy. \nMany countries have tested nuclear weapons. World War II, the United States dropped two nuclear bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. \nIn Hiroshima, the nuclear bomb destroyed of the city, and killed 60,000 to 80,000 people right away. More people later died from radiation sickness and cancer caused by radiation, so historians think about 135,000 people were killed by the one nuclear bomb that hit Hiroshima.\nIn Nagasaki, the nuclear bomb created about of heat, and winds as fast as . It killed somewhere between 39,000 and 80,000 people.\nThe United Nations later made the use of Nuclear weapons illegal which is largely due to the radiation that is brought along with as well as earthquakes and other natural disasters. While true to this day many countries still manufacture these weapons today.\nExplosives.\nE as in explosives stands for high-yield explosive. High-yield explosive is materials that rapidly release large amounts of energy and produce a pressure shock wave during detonation. \nHigh-Yield Explosions can occur in labs and hospitals that contain compressed gas. One highly explosive gas is Acetylene which is commonly found under pressure to containment and later use. There are types of liquids like Nitroglycerin that can be subjected to pressure explosion as well.\nAccidental CBRNE events.\nExamples of accidental CBRNE events include:"}

In normal electronics the flow of current in a wire can also be used to produce a magnetic field which is known as electromagnetism. Neither of these form a part of spintonics.\nIn spintronics the property of the spin of the electrons themselves is used directly. It makes use of the electrons in a solid metal or semiconductor.\nIn spintronics the electron spin of just a few electrons in a material are made to align in one direction by briefly applying a very large magnetic field. Even when the magnetic field is removed the electrons will remain aligned in their spins. This alignment will slowly fade away over time but will persist for a while.\nSince these aligned spins produce a resultant magnet field they can be detected and even used to move the electrons. \nThe deliberate moving of only those electrons with a certain spin can be used to store information and this technology has been called spintronics to distinguish it from conventional use of electrons in electronics which uses their electric charge only.\nSpintonics is an area of research in which scientists are trying to make useful devices and are making progress. Some devices write the electron spin codes into the surface of a moving disk and others make them in sold transistor junctions as RAM. They promise a technology that could create faster and smaller electronic devices that use less energy."}

Instead of explaining a story, as in a summary, a writer makes the reader feel what is happening. It creates a picture of something in the reader's mind. When the reader gets a clear mental picture the story becomes more interesting. The technique is used in both fiction and non-fiction writing. \nExamples of show, don't tell.\nIn the first example, the author is telling what the character feels. In the second example, the author is allowing the reader to picture what the character was experiencing when she opened the door.\nShow and tell.\nGood writing may involve both showing and telling. A scene shows the reader what is happening. It allows the reader to experience the action and emotions of the people in the story. A summary is often used between scenes to connect them together to create a story. Another use of summaries is in places where a part of the story needs to be brief. Showing takes more words than telling. Less important parts of a story are sometimes mentioned very briefly."}

A blood agent makes it impossible for a person's blood to hold oxygen and bring it to the rest of the body. Every part of the body needs oxygen to survive. Blood agents can cause life-threatening symptoms like seizures or coma, which happen because the brain is not getting enough oxygen. In high enough doses, blood agents can make a person suffocate.\nWhen they are used on purpose to kill many people, blood agents are weapons of mass destruction (WMDs).\nThe most common types of blood agents are chemical compounds that include cyanide. However, other blood agents are based on arsenic.\nTypes of blood agents.\nThere are many different blood agents. Below is some information about the blood agents that are most likely to be used as weapons of mass destruction:\nAll of these chemicals are colorless, except for phosgene. Phosgene gas is colorless, but liquid phosgene is a very light yellow.\nAccording to a book on the history of chemical weapons, the most toxic and effective blood agents are hydrogen cyanide and phosgene; followed by cyanogen and arsine; then cyanogen chloride; and finally vinyl arsine.\nHow they work.\nUsually, the bloodstream carries oxygen from the air we breathe to the entire body. The cells in the body need oxygen to survive, and they also need to get rid of carbon dioxide. (Carbon dioxide is left over when cells make energy; too much of it is poisonous.) Usually, cells pick up oxygen from the bloodstream, and send carbon dioxide out into the bloodstream. This is called gas exchange.\nBlood agents prevent gas exchange. They keep oxygen from getting into the body's cells. Without oxygen, cells die. If a person gets a high enough dose of a blood agent, they will suffocate because the oxygen they breathe in cannot get into the body's cells.\nExposure.\n\"Exposure\" means that a chemical touched or got into a person's body. That person has been \"exposed\" to the chemical. Most people who are exposed to blood agents breathe in or swallow the chemical. This can happen accidentally or on purpose.\nFor example, there are cyanide compounds in cigarette smoke and in smoke from many building fires. Also, cyanide compounds and arsine are used in pesticides. Most exposures to arsine happen accidentally to people who work around these chemicals.\nUsually, when blood agents are used as a weapon of mass destruction, they are sprayed into the air, so people will inhale them.\nSigns and symptoms.\nWhen a person is exposed to a blood agent, their symptoms will depend on a few things:\nIf a person is exposed to a small amount of a blood agent, their symptoms may not be life-threatening. For example, they may get confused, feel very tired, or have a headache, nausea, and vomiting.\nHowever, if a person is exposed to a high dose of a blood agent, they can have much more serious symptoms, including:\nBlood agents act very quickly. If a person gets a high enough dose, they will start having these symptoms just a few seconds after being exposed. They can die in minutes - or even seconds - from respiratory failure.\nTreatment.\nThere are a few different antidotes to cyanide poisoning. The cyanide antidote kit used most often in the United States includes three medications: amyl nitrite and sodium nitrite, which attach to cyanide and change it to a less dangerous chemical, and sodium thiosulfate, which turns cyanide into a harmless chemical that a person can urinate out.\nA form of vitamin B12 that is made by bacteria, called hydroxocobalamin, is also an antidote to cyanide. It changes cyanide into regular vitamin B12.\nThere are no antidotes for arsine or phosgene. Medical professionals can only give \"supportive care,\" which means they can only treat arsine poisoning's symptoms. For example, they can give oxygen through a mask; give medications for cardiac arrhythmias; and do dialysis for kidney failure.\nUse in war and execution.\nThe first blood agent to be used as a weapon of mass destruction was phosgene. Phosgene was first used by the German Army to attack the British Army in 1915. After that, phosgene was used often during World War I. Countries on both sides of the war - including Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States - used phosgene to attack enemy soldiers. Often they mixed it with chlorine, with the goal of killing more people. Phosgene caused about 85% of the 100,000 deaths caused by poison gas during the war (a total of about 85,000 deaths).\nIn 1919, the British Royal Air Force dropped arsenic gas on Bolshevik soldiers during the Russian Civil War.\nPhosgene was also used often by the Imperial Japanese Army against China during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945).\nDuring the Holocaust, the Nazis used a form of hydrogen cyanide called Zyklon B to kill people in the gas chambers at their death camps and concentration camps.\nAfter nerve gases were discovered, blood agents were not used as much. However, in the 1980s, Iraq used cyanogen chloride against Iran in the Iran-Iraq War.\nStarting in 1924, the United States has used hydrogen cyanide in gas chambers to execute prisoners who were given the death penalty. Most states now use other ways of executing people. However, execution by hydrogen cyanide is still legal in six states."}

Most eyewitnesses talk about one or more explosions that happened around 7:15 a.m. local time. The cause of these explosions is unknown, but a meteorite impact has been suggested as a likely cause. About around the place where the event happened, trees were uprooted. In Wanwara, a small settlement, about away, windows and doors were smashed. It is estimated, that in an area of about , the trees were uprooted. Over away, bright light was seen, and an earthquake was felt. \nThere are no reports of people who have died. This is attributed to the fact that almost no people lived in the area, at the time. Depending on the source, there were one or two casualties.\nToday, it is believed that the event happened about above ground, at 0:14 UTC (7:14 a.m. local time).\nEnergy involved.\nWhat happened is called air burst today. At the time, the energy involved was estimated to be between 10 and 30 megatons of TNT, depending on the height in which the air burst happened. Simulations that have been done with modern computers have found that the energy involved was probably between 3 and 5 megatons of TNT. Taking 15 megatons, this would mean that the energy involved was 1.000 times that of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, in 1945. The shock wave is considered to be that of an earthquake with a magnitude of 5.0 on the Richter scale. For these reasons, the Tunguska event is considered the largest impact event on Earth in recorded history. \nExpeditions to the area.\nAt first, there was no interest in the event. Over a decade after the event, Leonid Kulik, a Russian mineralogist led an expedition to the area. In his expedition of 1921 and 1922, he only got to Kansk, which is away from the \"epicenter\" of the event. In 1927, Kulik reached the region where the event happened, in 1938 he ordered aerial photos be taken.\nKulik's expedition is the first recorded expedition to the area. Since then, there were many expeditions; over 1,000 articles have been published on the event; most of them are in Russian language.\nThere were two other expeditions to the area: one in 1958, the other in 1963.\nTheories.\nToday, there is no definite explanation for what caused the explosions, or for what happened. There are different theories, though.\nMeteorite explosion.\nA meteorite hit the area. The most probable is an asteroid or comet of low density, and a diameter of between and . The object exploded in a height of 7 to 14 km above ground; for this reason there is no impact crater. The problem with this theory is that meteorites of this type usually do not reach low levels of the atmosphere. Meteoroids, which contain more iron have a higher chance of reaching low levels of the atmosphere, but they do not cause such devastating explosions. \nLake Cheko.\nLake Cheko is a small freshwater lake, about from the center of the event. The lake does not show on maps of the area which are older than about 1928. Before 1908, it seems to be unknown. The lake is rectangular; it is 708\u00a0metres long, 364\u00a0m wide, and about 50\u00a0m deep. In 1999, Luca Gasperini did a study on the sediments in the lake, and found that the lake predates the event of 1908. In 2007, National Geographic cites him as he states that it is possible the lake formed as an impact crater.This is disputed due to the spread of trees, destroyed from the widely accepted Meteorite explosion.\nGeophysical theories: Volcanic eruption.\nThe other theory is that the event has a geophysical cause: About 10 million ton of natural gas exploding would have the effect that was observed. The problem with this theory is that eyewitnesses spoke of a very bright light that could be seen from very far away. A natural gas explosion does not produce a bright light. "}

They also decide whether criminal charges should be brought. A grand jury may subpoena evidence and may compel the sworn testimony of witnesses who appear before it. Grand juries are made up of from 16 to 23 people in the United States. They meet for a period of one month up to a year. However, jurors may only have to meet for a few days each month. The juries meet in private. The suspected person, called a suspect, is not usually present. About half the states in the US do not regularly use grand juries. A preliminary hearing may be used instead. The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires the use of grand juries by the federal legal system for all capital and \"infamous crimes\" (cases involving treason, certain felonies or gross moral turpitude).\nHistory.\nIn 1166 an enactment of King Henry II of England, called the Assize of Clarendon, called for \"the oath of *twelve men from every hundred and four men from every vill\" to meet and decide who was guilty of robbery, theft or murder. It was the early ancestor of the jury system and of the grand jury. The United Kingdom abolished grand juries in 1933. Many of their former colonies including \nCanada, Australia and New Zealand have also stopped using them. The United States is one of the few remaining countries that uses the grand jury. \nCriticism.\nGrand juries are called by a federal judge and are required to supervise them. But judges almost never interfere. The grand jury is led by a federal prosecutor. He cannot testify or be present while the jury deliberates. But most federal grand juries will return any indictment presented to it. This led to the famous saying \"a prosecutor can get a grand jury to indict a ham sandwich.\" They can subpoena anything they want with very few restrictions. In United States v. R. Enterprises, Inc., 498 U.S. 292 (1991), the Supreme Court of the United States ruled \"federal grand jury subpoenas are presumed to be reasonable and the burden of showing unreasonableness is on the recipient.\"\nA grand jury, state or federal, has two functions. The first is to go over all evidence of criminal wrongdoing and to issue an indictment only if there is enough evidence. Their other purpose is to investigate and help the prosecutor gather evidence. Critics claim grand juries have failed to do both."}

Either the male or female gymnast perform a flip in the air and land on the floor. When the gymnast lands on the floor, he or she has to be in balance.\nEarly forms of the vault were invented by German Friedrich Ludwig Jahn. The apparatus itself originated as a \"horse\", much like the pommel horse but without the handles. It was sometimes called a \"vaulting horse\". The horse was set up with its long side perpendicular to the run for women, and parallel for men. The vaulting horse was the apparatus used in the Olympics for over a century It began with the 1896 Summer Olympics and ending with the Gymnastics at the 2000 Summer Olympics.\nFollowing a number of problems, International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) changed the apparatus. They did it for both safety reasons and for better acrobatics. The 2001 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships were the first international competition to make use of the \"vaulting table\". This was an apparatus made by Dutch gymnastics equipment company Janssen-Fritsen since the mid-1990s. It features a flat, larger, and more cushioned surface almost parallel to the floor. It slopes downward at the end closest to the springboard. Gymnasts nicknamed it the \"tongue\"."}

However, since the Thompson was expensive to make in large numbers, the British made a submachine gun of their own, that would be cheap and quick to make. This was the Sten Mk II.\nThe weapon was only made of 47 parts, making it relatively fast to put together and take apart and therefore easy to ship and hide. This feature made it popular among resistance fighters, including the Free French. \nIt was also the first SMG to have a silencer made for it, making it useful for stealth and surprise. However, due to its low quality, it was not a very reliable weapon as it had the tendency to jam, and to fire entire clips without pulling the trigger. \nIt is stated that British soldiers who captured German MP-40's would often abandon the Sten and fight using the MP-40 instead. The switch was not difficult since both weapons fired the same type of bullet, the 9x19mm Parabellum, with the same type of clips (which meant that they could use the enemy's ammunition to load their Stens or vice versa)."}

It was popular among soldiers, police, and civilians alike. It was invented by Brigadier General John T. Thompson at the end of World War I as a \"trench-boom\" weapon, or a weapon that could clear out trenches very quickly. The war ended before the submachine gun could be used in battle. In 1919, Brigadier General Thompson had the company he founded, Auto-Ordnance Company, modify the gun for civilian use. The gun was classified as a submachine gun, meaning a small, fully automatic, hand-held gun that fires pistol ammunition. It remains an iconic firearm that is very popular with collectors. It fires .45 ACP caliber bullets, an effective and accurate combat bullet against human targets.\nHistory.\nIn 1882, John T. Thompson entered the United States Army. During the Spanish\u2013American War he made a reputation for himself making sure ammunition got to the front lines. This was at a time of almost complete chaos in the army supply system. He later played a part in developing two important American military weapons. These were the M1903 Springfield rifle and the M1911 pistol. In 1916 Auto-Ordnance was started with Thompson holding the majority of shares. Designed for use in World War I, the gun was first called \"The Annihilator I\" (Thompson nicknamed it a trench broom) could fire 20 rounds per second. The first cases of the new submachine gun arrived on the docks for shipment on November 11, 1918; the same day the war ended. Thompson and Auto-Ordnance began developing the gun for civilian markets. In 1921 the first model, called the M1921, was produced.\nAfter World War I.\nIn 1921, the Colt Patent Firearms Company made 15,000 Thompson submachine guns for Auto-Ordinance at a cost of $38.25 each. These were called the \u201cModel 1921A\u201d. This model weighed and had an effective range (distance it was accurate) of . General Thompson tried to sell his gun to European countries with little success. He tried selling it in the US but sales were slow. In 1926 he got orders from the United States Postal Service and the United States Marine Corps. The Marines used the guns during the Banana Wars. It worked well to counter ambushes by Nicaraguan guerrillas. The Irish Republican Army used them in 1921 during the last part of the Irish War of Independence. They were not impressed by the fact they could only kill about 32 percent of those they fired at. Others who bought his submachine gun included Law enforcement agencies and ranchers. Organized crime quickly found uses for the gun. Later, the United States Navy ordered 1,500.\nWorld War II.\nThe US military began using the weapon in 1938 and used it throughout World War II. There were two variants used. The model M1928A1 could use either stick or drum magazines, it had a muzzle brake (to counter the gun's tendency to rise when fired) and had Cooling fins (to counter the barrel of the gun getting too hot). The M1A1 model had no cooling fins, could only use the stick magazines and had a simplified sight. It was used by all the allies during the war. The main problem of the Thompson submachine gun was it was complex and expensive to manufacture. It was also heavy at about loaded. It had to be kept very clean or it would misfire. But soldiers liked the weapon. It was a favorite of British and Australian soldiers. In the US military it was carried by squad leaders and officers. In the heavy jungles in the Pacific War, it sounded dangerously like the Japanese light machine guns causing some confusion on both sides. When the US developed the M3 submachine gun, also called the \"grease gun\", it was much lighter, cheaper to make and had a slower rate of fire. Most soldiers who had Thompsons were very slow to give them up in favor of the less well-liked grease gun. \nIt was used during the Korean War and later during the Vietnam War. The Thompson submachine gun was retired in 1971 after 33 years of service. \nOther militaries.\nThe Thompson was used in the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict, the Cuban Revolution and in the Northern Ireland conflict (1969\u20131998. The gun continues to be produced today, with many countries around the world still using it. Over 1,700,000 Thompson submachine guns have been made."}

He was brought to New York City as a child in 1897, by the explorer Robert Peary. His father and four others were also brought. The six of them were studied by staff at the American Museum of Natural History, which was given custody of them. Most of them died soon after arriving. \nMinik was a member of the Inughuit, the northernmost group of Inuit in Greenland. His father was named Qisuk. They met Peary when the explorer employed men from the Inughuit during several expeditions into the Arctic. Peary asked some of them to come with him to New York. Six of them agreed, including Qisuk and Minik. Peary did not tell them about the real purpose of the trip. Some agreed to travel to see new places; others did not want to be separated from relatives. Peary promised them that they would be able to return to Greenland. Soon after their arrival, the group became the objects of study. The museum staff had not made plans for their care, nor for their return.\nSoon after arriving in New York, most of the Inuit contracted the disease tuberculosis. Three adults and one child died, including Minik's father. A fourth adult survived and was returned to Greenland. Minik was the only one left. William Wallace, the curator of the museum, adopted Minik. Minik pleaded for a proper Inuit burial for his father. The museum staff wanted to preserve Qisuk's body for study. They made a fake body and put it in a coffin. They staged a fake burial so that Minik would think he was burying his father.\nThe museum put the skeleton on display. In about 1906, a story was published in local newspapers that stated Qisuk's skeleton was displayed in the museum. Minik was told about it by his classmates at school. He then asked that his father's bones be given to him for traditional burial. Wallace supported Minik in this, but the museum denied that they had the body. Minik was never able to reclaim his father's bones.\nMinik returned to Greenland in 1910, with the help of Peary. He came back to the United States in 1916. He lived and worked there until dying of influenza in the pandemic of 1918.\nKenn Harper wrote a book about Minik in 1986. The book was called \"Give Me My Father's Body\". Harper spent several years trying to persuade the Museum of Natural History to return the remains of the four Inuit to Greenland. He succeeded in 1993. The bodies were buried in a funeral in Qaanaaq. Minik is buried in a cemetery in Pittsburg, New Hampshire."}

CSF also fills the brain's ventricles, and flows down the middle of the spinal cord (the \"central canal\").\nContents.\nCSF is created from blood plasma (the liquid part of blood), so CSF's contents are very similar to plasma's. CSF is 99% water. It carries:\nThere should be very few white blood cells in the CSF, or none at all. There should be no red blood cells in the CSF.\nWhat CSF does.\nCSF helps the brain float.\nBeing surrounded by CSF helps the brain float inside the skull, like a buoy in water. Because the brain is surrounded by fluid, it floats like it weighs only 2% of what it really does. If the brain did not have CSF to float in, it would sit on the bottom of the skull. The brain's weight would push the bottom of the brain against the skull. Blood would not be able to get to the bottom of the brain because the blood vessels would be getting crushed by the weight of the brain on top of them. Without getting blood (and the oxygen it carries), the neurons in the bottom of the brain would die.\nCSF is the brain's cushion.\nCSF protects the brain by acting like a cushion. Without CSF, every time a person moved their head, their brain would hit the inside of their skull. This could injure the brain. \nWhen a person hits their head, CSF acts like the airbag in a car and can sometimes keep the brain from slamming into the inside of the skull. However, when a person hits their head very hard \u2013 in a car accident, for example \u2013 the CSF cannot protect the brain from hitting the skull. This can cause concussions, bleeding in the brain, brain damage, or even death.\nCSF rinses toxins out of the brain.\nThe brain's cells do chemical reactions to change one chemical to another chemical that the brain needs. Sometimes, after a chemical reaction, chemicals that the brain does not need are left over. These chemicals are called \"waste products.\" For example, when the brain's cells use oxygen and glucose (sugar) to create energy, carbon dioxide (CO2) is left over. Too much carbon dioxide can poison the brain.\nTo keep waste products from building up in the CSF, the choroid plexuses make new CSF about four times a day. The old CSF drains out into the bloodstream, bringing waste products and toxins with it. In this way, the CSF rinses things that could hurt the brain out into the bloodstream. The bloodstream can then carry these chemicals to organs that can get rid of them, like the kidneys and the lungs. For example, the bloodstream carries carbon dioxide to the lungs, where it can be breathed out.\nTesting CSF.\nDoctors can use samples of CSF to find out if a person has a brain infection, like meningitis, encephalitis, or syphilis. CSF samples can also show bleeding from certain parts of the brain. Swelling in the brain, caused by some inflammatory diseases like multiple sclerosis, can show in a CSF sample as well.\nUsually, doctors take samples of CSF by doing a lumbar puncture (spinal tap).\nResults.\nNormal CSF should be clear and colorless, with no red blood cells, and very few white blood cells.\nSigns of a brain infection include:\nProtein levels that are higher than normal can be a sign of inflammation in the brain. However, they can also be a sign of other problems, like a bleed in the brain; a brain tumor; epilepsy; and \"acute alcoholism.\"\nCancer cells in the CSF are a sign that a person has brain cancer, or has cancer that started somewhere else and spread to the brain.\nProblems with CSF.\nToo much.\nHead injuries and some diseases can make too much CSF build up in the brain. This is called hydrocephalus. The extra fluid puts pressure on (squeezes) the brain. This is called increased intracranial pressure. If the pressure gets high enough, the brain's blood vessels get crushed, and blood cannot get to the brain. If a person's brain does not get enough blood and oxygen, they will become unconscious and their brain cells will die. Eventually, the person will die.\nWithout treatment, 6 out of every 10 people with hydrocephalus will die. The rest will have physical disabilities, intellectual disabilities, and/or other brain problems.\nNot enough.\nSome problems can cause CSF to leak out through a hole or tear in the dura mater (the layer of the meninges that is next to the skull and the bones of the spinal cord). CSF leaks are usually a complication of a lumbar puncture or certain kinds of surgery on the head, neck, or brain. However, an injury to the head or spine can also cause a CSF leak. Sometimes, doctors cannot find a cause for a CSF leak.\nMost people with CSF leaks get better on their own, after the hole in the dura mater heals. However, some CSF leaks can cause serious complications:"}

{"id": "531211", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=531211", "title": "Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution", "text": "Created on December 15, 1791, the Sixth Amendment (Amendment VI) to the United States Constitution is a part of the United States Bill of Rights. It provides many protections and rights to those accused of a crime. Among the provisions are the right to a lawyer, the right to a speedy public trial and the right to an impartial jury. It gives defendants the right to know who his (or her) accusers are. It also give the defendant the right to know the charges and evidence against him. \nRights.\nTo counsel.\nOne of the most important rights given is that to legal counsel. It is so important that another right is associated with it. All those who cannot afford to pay for legal assistance will have a lawyer appointed for them at government expense. The federal, state and local justice systems all have provisions to appoint legal counsel for indigent defendants. The appointed counsel assists the defendant in any interrogations by law enforcement. They assist the defendant through the trial phase, sentencing and the initial appeal if there is a conviction. Legal systems, including the U.S. legal system, are complex and not easily understood by the average person. Having an attorney is critical to guiding the defendant through the legal processes. An attorney advises his client, the defendant, as to his or her rights and explains all processes of the criminal proceedings. The attorney protects the defendant's Constitutional rights. An attorney also can negotiate with the prosecution and the court in cases of plea bargains. \nSpeedy trial.\nThe right to a speedy trail originated with the Assize of Clarendon in 1166. It says that justice must be provided to robbers, murders, and thieves \"speedily enough.\" Those who wrote the Bill of Rights did not want defendants to be prisoners for a long time without the benefit of a trial. They did not want the accused to have their life disrupted, especially when the Fifth and Sixth Amendments both hold a presumption of innocence. Also, the longer a trial is delayed, the more likely that evidence may be lost and that witnesses may forget or cannot be found. \nA right to a speedy trial does not begin until a person has been arrested or formally charged. The government may investigate a crime (within any applicable statute of limitations) for as long as they find it is necessary. They are under no obligation to bring an indictment within a certain period of time. The prosecution may drop any pending criminal charges and open the investigation again at a later time without penalty of the Sixth Amendment. \nIf a defendant brings a claim that their speedy trial rights have been violated the court may look at the reasons for the delay, any prejudice or injury to the defendant and how far the prosecution has gone into the criminal proceedings. If a defendant does not assert the right to a speedy trial early enough, they may lose their claim. Defendants who cause unnecessary delays also lose their rights to a speedy trial claim. \nIf the delay in bringing a defendant to trial exceeds one year following the arrest, this will trigger a presumption that the Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial may have been violated. The government may counter if they have good or plausible reasons for the delay. Requests by the prosecution for additional time may be granted if plausible. But if none are offered or the court finds the reasons not plausible, they may dismiss the indictment, overturn a conviction or hear other remedies the defense might seek. \nPublic trial.\nThis right, to a public trial, has its roots in English common law. It reflects the hostility and suspicion felt at the time towards secret proceedings such as the Spanish Inquisition, the French \"Lettre de cachet\" or England's Star Chamber. The framers of the Bill of Rights believed that public trials would help prevent corruption in judges and prosecutors. It was also thought it might reduce witnesses committing perjury. The United States Supreme Court has held that the right to a public trial applies to federal, state, and local governments. The right is not absolute however. While the public and the press have a First Amendment interest in open proceedings, under some circumstances a defendant waive his rights to a public trial. In cases where undue publicity might hurt the defendant's case, public access to the trial can be restricted.\nImpartial jury.\nThe right to a jury has always depended on the nature of the offense with which the defendant is charged. Petty offenses\u2014those punishable by imprisonment for no more than six months\u2014are not covered by the jury requirement. Even where multiple petty offenses are concerned, the total time of imprisonment possibly exceeding six months, the right to a jury trial does not exist. Also, in the United States, except for serious offenses (such as murder), minors are usually tried in a juvenile court, which lessens the sentence allowed, but forfeits the right to a jury.\nOriginally, the Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial indicated a right to \u201ca trial by jury as understood and applied at common law. This includes all the essential elements as they were recognized in this country and England when the Constitution was adopted. Therefore, it was held that juries had to be composed of twelve persons and that verdicts had to be unanimous, as was customary in England. \nWhen, under the Fourteenth Amendment, the Supreme Court extended the right to a trial by jury to defendants in state courts, it re-examined some of the standards. It has been held that twelve came to be the number of jurors by \"historical accident,\" and that a jury of six would be sufficient, but anything less would deprive the defendant of a right to trial by jury. The Sixth Amendment requires unanimity in a federal jury trial. However, the Supreme Court has ruled that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, while requiring states to provide jury trials for serious crimes, does not incorporate all the elements of a jury trial within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment. Thus, states are not mandated to require jury unanimity.\nConfront witnesses.\nThe Sixth Amendment's confrontational clause grants the defendant the right to face their accusers. It allows the defense to dispute the testimony given by prosecution witnesses. It also allows the jury the opportunity to decide if a witness is being dishonest in any way. This applies to statements made in court and out of court statements. A court may prevent repeated questioning of witnesses on the same question or harassing a witness. But if a judge restricts the cross-examination of a witness too severely, it may cause a violation of the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses. \nAdmitting out of court statements, often called hearsay evidence, may also prevent a defendant from confronting his accusers. There are some exceptions. For example, if a witness is unavailable and testified against the defendant in previous judicial proceedings, and the defendant was able to cross-examine the witness, a transcript of the testimony may be used as evidence. \nThe compulsory clause also allows the accused to present witness testimony favorable to the defense."}

That person has been exposed to the toxin.\nAfter a person is exposed to a toxin, many different things about that person, the toxin, and the exposure affect \"toxicity\". Toxicity is how the person reacts to the toxin, including what symptoms they may have.\nA person can get exposed to a toxin accidentally or on purpose. People can also use toxins as weapons to try to kill other people (for example, during chemical or biological warfare).\nAnything can be a toxin.\nAnything can be a toxin if enough of it gets into a person's body. For example, even water can be toxic. If a person drinks enough water (usually more than 6 gallons in one day), they can get water toxicity (also called \"water poisoning\" or \"water intoxication\"). This causes the body's cells to swell up with extra water. Swelling in the brain's cells can cause brain damage or death. Water, in normal amounts, helps keep us alive; but if a person is exposed to enough of it, it becomes a toxin, and it can kill the person.\nTypes of exposure.\nThere are two major types of exposure: acute and chronic.\nAn acute exposure happens only one time. Chronic exposure happens many times, over a long period of time.\nThe United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines these types of exposure this way:p.\u00a0105\nRoutes of exposure.\nToxins can get into the body in four different ways. These are called \"routes of exposure.\" The route of exposure is one of the many things that affects toxicity.\nInhalation.\nToxins can get into the body through inhalation (the person breathes in the toxin). If a toxin is a gas, inhalation is usually the way it gets into the body.p.\u00a01\nWhen a toxin is inhaled, it may injure the airways and the lungs. Also, some toxins can go from the lungs into the bloodstream. The bloodstream then delivers blood - with the toxin in it - to all of the organs in the body. The toxin can then damage those organs.p.\u00a01\nInhalation is one of the easiest and fastest ways for toxins to get into the body. The lining of the respiratory tract absorbs toxins into the bloodstream very quickly.p.\u00a099\nExamples of inhaled toxins.\nAn example of a commonly inhaled toxin is cigarette smoke. There are over 100 toxins in cigarette smoke, including formaldehyde, arsenic, and hydrogen cyanide. Smoking is also an example of \"chronic\" toxic exposure. The exposure is chronic because the smoker is breathing in toxins many times, over a long period of time.\nAnother inhaled toxin that causes \"acute\" exposure is smoke from house fires. There are many toxins in this kind of smoke, including carbon monoxide and cyanide. Firefighters or people who were trapped in fires can get cyanide poisoning or carbon monoxide poisoning from breathing in these toxins. This is an example of an acute exposure, because the smoke was not breathed in for more than 24 hours.\nAbsorption.\nIf a toxin gets in a person's eyes or on their skin, it can get taken up into the bloodstream. This is called absorption. Absorption through the skin is the most common route of toxic exposure.p.\u00a097\nThe skin is able to keep some toxins from getting into the body. However, if a person has a cut or wound on their skin, any toxin will be able to get into the body through that wound. Also, the toxin will be taken up into the bloodstream more quickly, because it does not have to get absorbed through the skin.p.\u00a098\nExamples of absorbed toxins.\nExposure by absorption often happens in workplaces where people work with toxins. For example, if a person who works at a gas station spills gasoline on himself, the body will quickly absorb the gasoline into the bloodstream.p.\u00a098 Some chemical weapons like sarin, a nerve gas, can also be absorbed through the skin and the eyes, along with being inhaled.\nIngestion.\nIngestion means that a person swallowed the toxin. Some chemicals cannot get into the bloodstream from the gastrointestinal tract. However, others are absorbed through the lining of the intestinal tract into the bloodstream.p.\u00a0100\nExamples of ingested toxins.\nIngestion of toxins is very common in developing countries, where many people do not have safe drinking water. There are many different toxins that can be carried in water. They can be chemicals, like lead. They can also be biological toxins, like the bacteria that causes cholera, and the viruses that cause Hepatitis A and polio. People ingest these toxins by drinking the contaminated water, or eating food made with the water. The World Health Organization says that about 502,000 people die every year because of toxins in water and the diseases they cause.\nFood poisoning is also caused by ingestion of toxins, like \"E. coli\" bacteria, which can live in foods like meat and poultry.\nInjection.\nAn injected toxin gets into the body when something carrying the toxin breaks the skin. Injections can go into a vein, a muscle, or just under the skin. Toxins that are injected into a vein have the fastest effects, because the toxin is being put right into the bloodstream.p.\u00a02\nExamples of injected toxins.\nSome snakes, scorpions, and spiders carry venom. If they bite or sting a person, they are injecting that toxin into the person's body.\nAn example of a toxin which is often injected on purpose is Botulinum. This is a very deadly toxin that causes botulism, but it is also sold under the name \"Botox.\" Many people choose to get Botulinum toxin injected into their faces to get rid of wrinkles. The toxin paralyzes some of the muscles in the face, usually for three to 12 months, and makes the face look smoother.\nMore than one route.\nSome toxins can get into the body through more than one route of exposure. For example, if water is polluted, a person can get exposed to the toxins in the water by drinking it (ingestion) and by showering or swimming in it (absorption).\nThings that affect toxicity.\nOnce a person has been exposed to a toxin, there are many things that affect toxicity. This article talks about only a few.\nThe exposure.\nMany things about a person's exposure affect toxicity. Three of the most important things are:\nThe route of exposure also affects toxicity. For example, if it is injected, snake venom can be life-threatening. However, if it is ingested, snake venom is usually not harmful. The effects of this toxin are very different depending on the route of exposure.\nThe exposed person.\nToxins sometimes affect different people in different ways. This is partly caused by differences in people's bodies. A person's age, gender, genes, hormones, nutrition, and the strength of their immune system all affect toxicity. For example, infants, young children, and the elderly are more likely to get sick from lower concentrations of toxins, which might not make a healthy adult sick.\nPeople with health problems.\nSome health problems can affect toxicity. For example, inhaling toxins is especially dangerous for people who already have lung diseases, like emphysema. If the lungs are already damaged, breathing in toxins is likely to cause even more damage, and puts the person at risk for respiratory failure.p.\u00a099\nAlso, once a toxin gets into the bloodstream, the body immediately starts trying to get rid of it through excretion. The main organs involved with excretion are the kidneys, liver, and lungs. If a person has damage to any of these organs (like kidney failure or cirrhosis of the liver), they will be unable to get rid of the toxin as fast as a healthy person will. The chemical will stay in their body longer, and have more toxic effects.p.\u00a0103\nThe type of toxin.\nMany things about the type of toxin a person was exposed to affect toxicity. Two examples are solubility and pH.\nSolubility.\nA toxin's solubility is its ability to mix into a liquid. If a toxin is not water-soluble (it cannot dissolve in water), it cannot absorb into the bloodstream. (Plasma, the liquid part of blood, is made mostly of water.) If a person ingests a toxin that cannot dissolve into the watery plasma, the toxin will not absorb into the bloodstream through the lining of the gastrointestinal tract. It will pass out of the body through the gastrointestinal tract.pp.\u00a0102\u2013103\nHowever, many toxins are water-soluble and will get absorbed into the bloodstream. For example, the \"Vibrio cholerae\" bacteria is water-soluble. If a person ingests water or food that has this toxin in it, they can get cholera.\nOther toxins are \"lipid-soluble\" (they dissolve in fats). Instead of getting absorbed into the bloodstream, these toxins get stored in the body's fat. When the person's body burns fat to make energy, these toxins are let out and can poison the person. Examples of fat-soluble toxins include lead, DDT, and mercury.\npH.\nThe toxin's pH is also important. For example, if a toxin is a strong acid or a strong base, it can cause severe chemical burns to the eyes and skin.p.\u00a0100 Toxins that have a more neutral pH can still hurt the body by being absorbed into the bloodstream, but they will not burn the eyes and skin. For example, if a person swims or bathes in water contaminated with cholera toxin, the toxin can still get absorbed through his eyes or skin. However, the water will not burn the eyes or skin."}

It consists of finding solutions to problems. A problem is a situation that needs to be changed. It suggests that the solution is not totally obvious, for then it would not be a problem. A great deal of human life is spent solving problems. Social life is based on the notion that together we might solve problems which we could not as individuals. \nThe word \"problem\" comes from a Greek word meaning an \"obstacle\" (something that is in your way). If someone has a problem, they have to find a way of solving the problem. The way to solve it is called a solution. Some problem-solving techniques have been developed and used in artificial intelligence, computer science, engineering, and mathematics. Some are related to mental problem-solving techniques studied in gestalt psychology, cognitive psychology. and chess.\nProblems can be classified as ill-defined or well-defined. Ill-defined problems are those that do not have clear goals, solution paths, or expected solution. An example is how to face threats which might perhaps be made in the future. Well-defined problems have specific goals, clearly defined solution paths, and clear expected solutions. These problems also allow for more initial planning than ill-defined problems. \nBeing able to solve problems involves the ability to understand what the goal of the problem is and what rules could be applied to solving the problem. Sometimes the problem requires abstract thinking and coming up with a creative solution. "}

The whole infrastructure had been checked a week before the accident, and was found to be without fault.\nCrash.\nOne of the trains left Kolbermoor on schedule, and headed towards Holzkirchen, and entered the single track section. The other train was four minutes late. The accident happened because of human error. The person responsible gave the orders to pass by a signal, because he said the signal in question was broken. That meant that both trains were travelling on the same track, and headed towards each other. This was not apparent to the train drivers, because there is a long bend in the track, at that position. The person in charge in Bad Aibling recognised that he had made an error, and issued orders for emergency braking using GSM-R. The first of these was given 36 seconds before the collision. Because he did not use the correct keys, these orders did not reach the train drivers, but other personnel responsible for securing the line. The accident happened at nearly 6:47 local time. Emergency braking was effective only one second before the collision. The trains were running at 52 and 87\u00a0km per hour.\nBoth train drivers were killed in the accident. In total, twelve people were killed, and 87 others injured.\n800 people were involved in the rescue. The rescue was very difficult, because the section of track were the accident happened is badly accessible by road. There is a steep hill, on one side, and a canal, with no road access on the other side.\nThe site of the accident is only 800m from the site where another similar accident had happened in 1945."}

Vertically transmitted infections are usually caused by bacteria or viruses.\nIf the baby still has the infection after he or she is born, the infection may be called a congenital infection.\nExamples.\nHere are some examples of infections that can be \"vertically transmitted.\"\nSexually transmitted infections.\nMany (but not all) sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can be vertically transmitted. STIs that can be spread from mother to fetus include:\nHepatitis.\nAlmost every type of hepatitis can be vertically transmitted. Hepatitis C, D, and E can be spread during pregnancy or childbirth.\nHepatitis B cannot be spread during pregnancy. However, it can be spread during childbirth if the infant touches its mother's blood or other body fluids.\nGroup B streptococcal infection.\nIn developed countries, Group B streptococcal infection is the most common cause of bacterial infections in newborns. It can cause infections that are very dangerous to newborns, like meningitis, septicaemia, and pneumonia. These infections can kill a newborn or cause serious long-term health problems.\nHow these infections spread.\nThere are two main ways that infections can be spread during pregnancy or childbirth.\nThrough the placenta.\nThe placenta surrounds and protects the fetus during pregnancy. It keeps the mother's blood from mixing with the fetus's. However, some infections can cross the placenta and infect the fetus. This is called \"perinatal infection.\"\nThese infections are especially dangerous because they affect the fetus while it is still developing. This is why many vertically transmitted infections are most dangerous to the fetus early on in a pregnancy. All of the fetus's important organs start to grow by the time the fetus is nine weeks old, and they grow the most early on in the pregnancy. If the fetus gets an infection while important parts of its body are developing, the infection can cause problems in the way those parts of the body grow.\nThese infections are also dangerous because a fetus does not have an immune system of its own. It depends on its mother's immune system. If the mother has an infection that has not been treated, and her immune system cannot fight off the infection, the fetus will not be able to fight off the infection either.\nDuring childbirth.\nDuring pregnancy, the placenta protects the fetus from its mother's blood. However, during childbirth, the placenta stays in the womb while the baby travels through the birth canal. While it is being born, the mother's blood and other body fluids get on the baby, and the baby also touches its mother's genitals. Because of this, infections that are carried in the blood, in body fluids, or in sores on the mother's genitals can infect the baby.\nInfections are usually more dangerous for newborns and infants than for adults. This is because it takes about six months for an infant's immune system to develop completely. Until the infant's immune system is fully grown, it will not be able to fight off infections as well as an adult could.\nSometimes, medical treatment, like antibiotics, can prevent a baby from getting infections that spread during childbirth.\nPrevention.\nSome vertically transmitted infections can be prevented if the mother gets vaccines before getting pregnant. These infections include HPV, chickenpox, measles, and rubella. However, while these vaccines are common in developed countries, many people in developing countries do not have good medical care and cannot get vaccines.\nOther vertically transmitted infections, like syphilis, can be cured with antibiotics before the mother gets pregnant.\nSexually transmitted infections can often be prevented by having safer sex.\nThe United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests these ways of preventing vertically transmitted infections:\nThe World Health Organization says that mothers with HIV can lower their baby's risk of getting vertically transmitted HIV to 2% if:"}

Because it is so toxic, it cannot be used as anything other than a chemical weapon. The United Nations classifies VX as a weapon of mass destruction.\nVX is the most toxic nerve agent ever created. The Council on Foreign Relations says: \"A fraction of a drop of VX, absorbed through the skin, can fatally disrupt the nervous system.\"\nThe Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993, an international law, made it illegal for countries to use chemical weapons like VX. It also made it illegal to make or keep more than 100 grams of VX. It allows some scientists to make and use amounts under 100 grams only if they are trying to create an antidote, or doing medical research.\nCreation.\nVX is one of the \"V-series nerve agents\" which were made in the 1950s by the United Kingdom's military researchers. Nobody agrees on why these nerve agents are called \"V-series.\" Different people say the \"V\" stands for \"Victory\" or \"Venomous\" (poisonous), or \"Viscous\" (thick liquid).\nVX as a weapon.\nVX is a liquid that cannot be smelled or tasted. It is a thick liquid with the texture of motor oil. As a weapon, it can be used as a liquid or an aerosol. It could be spread by air, through water, or through food.\nMaking VX is difficult and very dangerous. Many toxic and dangerous chemicals are used in the process.\nVX works the same way other nerve agents do. It blocks nerve signals from getting from the brain to the body. Normally, a neurotransmitter (chemical messenger) called acetylcholine tells the body's muscles to tighten up when they need to. When it is time for the muscles to relax, an enzyme called acetylcholinesterase destroys acetylcholine, so the muscles stop getting the signal to relax.\nVX blocks acetylcholinesterase. Acetylcholine builds up, because it is not getting destroyed by acetylcholinesterase. The muscles get tighter and tighter, because the extra acetylcholine keeps telling them to. The extra acetylcholine also signals the parasympathetic nervous system to work extra hard. These changes in the body cause the signs and symptoms of VX poisoning.\nSigns and symptoms.\nThe earliest symptoms of VX poisoning depend on how a person was exposed to VX. If VX got on a person's skin, their first symptoms might be sweating or twitching muscles near where the VX was. If the person breathed in VX, their first symptoms might be a runny nose and trouble breathing, caused by the bronchi (the tubes that bring air to the lungs) getting narrower.\nAll nerve agents have the same symptoms, because they work the same way. They make the parasympathetic nervous system work too hard. They also keep signals from the brain from getting through to the body, so the brain cannot tell the muscles to relax. This causes a group of unique symptoms:\nPeople with VX poisoning can have seizures and go into status epilepticus. They can die because their breathing muscles get so tight that they do not work.\nTreatment.\nIf a person got VX on their skin, the first step is to wash away the VX with bleach and water. This is called \"decontamination.\" Removing clothing that the VX touched is also part of decontamination.p.30\nThere are antidotes for nerve agent poisoning. They have to be given together.\nHowever, nerve agents like VX work very quickly. Antidotes usually have to be given within a few minutes after a person was exposed to VX. If pralidoxime is not given soon enough, it cannot reverse VX's effects.p.6\nUsually, a sedative like diazepam (Valium) is also given. This will help the body's muscles relax, and can prevent seizures."}

As a gas, it is heavier than air, so it can stay near the ground (where people can breathe it in for long periods of time. It smells like freshly cut grass or moldy hay.\nAlong with being a choking agent, phosgene is also a blood agent. This means it keeps oxygen from getting into the body's cells. Without oxygen, a person's cells will die, and the person will suffocate.\nPhosgene usually does not cause its worst effects right away. The worst symptoms do not happen until 12 hours after a person breathed in phosgene. The person usually dies within 24 to 48 hours.\nChlorine.\nChlorine is naturally a gas, but it can be made into a liquid or a solid. Chlorine is used to make many different things, like plastics, and is used to clean swimming pools.\nChlorine gas is very dangerous if it is inhaled. Chlorine can react with water in the lungs to make hydrochloric acid. This is a very strong acid which can burn the lungs so badly that a person dies.\nSigns and symptoms.\nThe signs and symptoms of exposure to a choking agent depend on how the chemical got into a person's body. \nIf a choking agent gets into a person's eyes or on their skin, it usually causes very bad burns.\nIf a choking agent is inhaled, it usually causes:\nIf a person got a high enough dose of a choking agent, they will eventually suffocate.\nUse in World War I.\nPhosgene and chlorine gas were both used as weapons during World War I. Chlorine was used first. It was the first chemical weapon that was used during the war to try to kill enemy soldiers. (Before this, countries like France and Germany had used tear gas, which is not meant to kill people.) \nChlorine.\nChlorine was used as a weapon for the first time by the German Army around January 1915, against the British Army. At the time, German Major Karl von Zingler wrote: \"[I]t has been said that our Chlorine is very effective. 140 English officers have been killed. This is a horrible weapon\u00a0...\".\nAbout four months later, the German Army used chlorine gas for the first time against French and Algerian soldiers. These soldiers did not know about this new weapon, and they panicked and tried to run away. However, running makes chlorine's effects worse. In a few minutes, the gas killed more than 1,000 French and Algerian soldiers, and injured more than 4,000 others. One soldier who survived said:\n\"[I watched] figures running wildly in confusion over the fields. Greenish-gray clouds swept down upon them, turning yellow as they traveled over the country blasting everything they touched and shriveling up the [plants]. . . . Then there staggered into our midst French soldiers, blinded, coughing, chests heaving, faces an ugly purple color, lips speechless with agony, and behind them in the gas soaked trenches, we learned that they had left hundreds of dead and dying comrades.\"\nIn September 1915, the British Army used chlorine gas as a weapon for the first time.\nThe German Army used chlorine gas as a weapon many more times, against French, Canadian, and Russian soldiers. In one attack on Russian soldiers in Poland, 9,000 Russian soldiers were injured by the gas, and more than 1,000 were killed.\nHowever, soon soldiers learned that the effects of chlorine were not as bad if they stayed still, got as high off the ground as possible, and used a damp cloth to cover their mouths and faces. Because chlorine gas is green, soldiers could see the chlorine coming and would have time to protect themselves. This made chlorine gas less deadly, and both sides soon switched to using phosgene.\nPhosgene.\nPhosgene was first used by the German Army to attack the British Army in 1915. After that, phosgene was used often during World War I. Countries on both sides of the war - including Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States - used phosgene to attack enemy soldiers. Often they mixed it with chlorine, with the goal of killing more people. \nIn World War I, phosgene caused about 85% of the 100,000 deaths caused by poison gas during the war (a total of about 85,000 deaths).\nUse after World War I.\nAfter people saw the effects of poison gases during World War I, these gases were not used often after that war.\nHowever, the Imperial Japanese Army used phosgene against China many times during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945).\nIn 2007, Iraqi insurgents used chlorine bombs to attack soldiers and civilians. Over 350 people got sick from the first attack. In two other attacks, more than 30 people died in each attack."}

In an idealized gas the particles move freely inside a stationary container without interacting with one another, most of the time. Sometimes they collide and exchange energy and momentum with each other or with their thermal environment. Particle in this context refers to gaseous particles (atoms or molecules), and the system of particles is assumed to have reached thermodynamic equilibrium.\nWhile the distribution was first derived by Maxwell in 1860 on heuristic grounds, Boltzmann later carried out significant investigations into the physical origins of this distribution.\nA particle speed probability distribution indicates which speeds are more likely: a particle will have a speed selected randomly from the distribution, and is more likely to be within one range of speeds than another. The distribution depends on the temperature of the system and the mass of the particle.\nThe Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann distribution applies to the classical ideal gas, which is an idealization of real gases. In real gases, there are various effects (e.g., van der Waals interactions, vortical flow, relativistic speed limits, and quantum exchange interactions) that can make their speed distribution different from the Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann form. However, rarefied gases at ordinary temperatures behave very nearly like an ideal gas and the Maxwell speed distribution is an excellent approximation for such gases. For this reason, it forms the basis of the Kinetic theory of gases, which provides a simplified explanation of many fundamental gaseous properties, including pressure and diffusion."}

Brain death is permanent, and cannot be cured or reversed. No treatment can help. When a person is brain dead, there is no activity in any part of their brain. Every part of the brain is dead; no oxygen flows to the brain, and there is no electrical activity in any part of the brain.\nThe brain controls everything we need to do to stay alive. For example, it controls breathing, body temperature, heart rate, and many other important things. When a person is brain dead, their brain cannot control any of these things. A brain-dead person cannot breathe on their own. They will never be able to wake up or be aware of what is going on around them.\nSometimes, brain-dead people are kept alive with special machines and medications. For example, doctors can put a tube down a person's throat and use a machine called a ventilator to pump oxygen into their lungs. While these machines can keep the person's other organs alive for a while, they cannot help the brain get better. Eventually, the person's other organs will stop working too.\nDiagnosis.\nDoctors can diagnose brain death by examining the patient. They will check for reflexes which are controlled by the brainstem, and see if the person can breathe on their own. If the person is brain-dead, the doctor will find:\nBefore diagnosing brain death, doctors will check for any other problem that could look like brain death (for example, a very low body temperature, or an overdose of sedatives). They will usually wait six to 24 hours before checking again to make sure the person still has no signs of activity in the brain. Then a second doctor is called in to do the same tests. If both doctors agree, the patient can officially be diagnosed \"brain dead.\"\nImmediate diagnosis.\nSometimes, doctors use other tests which can diagnose brain death right away. These tests include:\nCauses.\nBrain death happens because of an injury to the entire brain. The most common causes are:\nSwelling or bleeding in the brain can cut off blood flow to the brain and push on the brainstem. If it gets bad enough, it can crush the brainstem."}

Interrogations are used by military organizations, intelligence agencies and law enforcement agencies worldwide. Sometimes the interrogated person is suspected of committing a crime or thought to have a reason to hide the information. The questioner in criminal and military interrogations is often an officer trained in different interrogation techniques. Depending on how they view the person being questioned or the purpose of the interrogation, the methods used may vary widely. For example:\nInterrogation questions.\nAn interrogation may often begin with several closed-ended questions. Examples would be \"are you comfortable\" or \"would you like a cigarette\"? The intent is for the interviewer to control the conversation and put the person being interrogated at ease. Let them think they are not in any trouble.\nNext may follow asking narrative questions to find out what the person knows about a subject. Next, the interrogator may ask direct questions. Throughout the interview interrogators may ask \"cross-questions\". These are the same question asked in different ways and at different times during the interview to see if the person being questioned answers them the same every time.\nThe Reid technique.\nA method taught to police interrogators since the 1970s is called the Reid technique. It was named for a Chicago police officer who developed it in the 1940s. It is widely used in North America because it gets confessions; sometimes false confessions. It is based on outdated psychology that maintains if a person shows stress they are lying. Unfortunately most people show stress when in stressful conditions. Suspects are questioned, often by teams of police officers. The Good cop/bad cop routine seen on police procedural shows is an example of the Reid technique. The police use this method to convince a suspect that confessing to the crime (whether they are guilty or not) is the best way out for the suspect. Many false confessions have been obtained this way resulting in false inprisonments.\nInformal questioning.\nA police officer may stop and question a person at any time. They do not need to give a Miranda warning before informal questioning or before making an arrest. But any information gained this way is not admissible at a trial against the person. Miranda required advising a person of their rights before being question in police custody. If the person asks the officer if they are free to leave, they are not in custody. That is one of the few things a police officer may not lie about. During questioning police may use trickery, lying or other forms of deception in order to get a confession from a suspect. \nPEACE method.\nA fairly new technique is being used in the UK, Denmark, New Zealand and other places. The word PEACE is an acronym for Preparation and Planning, Engage and Explain, Account, Closure and Evaluate. It is considered a more ethical model of police questioning. It is intended to prevent wrongful convictions by eliminating any coercion or deceptive methods. When tested in England and Wales, it resulted in the same percentage of convictions as the older methods produced. Peace is more of a journalistic approach. It assumes a liar will find it increasingly difficult to keep all the lies consistent and will eventually break down and confess. \nThird degree.\nA historic method of obtaining confessions is the applying of the so-called third degree. It consists of treating a suspect brutally, keeping them awake for long periods of time with no food or water. Beatings were given along with threats. Often a suspect confessed to stop the abuse. The suspect was then forced to sign a paper saying he was not intimidated or coerced into giving his statement. In 1937, the court threw out a confession upon learning it was not given voluntarily but the defendant had been hung from a tree and whipped until he confessed.\nTorture.\nEven though it is a serious breach of most international agreements, torture is still used by some police, military and intelligence services. Torture is prohibited under international law, but it is still used. In 2014 the Senate Intelligence Committee found that the Central Intelligence Agency tortured terror suspects. "}

It is part of the Springfield, Missouri metropolitan area.\nHistory.\nThe area was first settled by farmers who located their farms along the wooded streams near present day Nixa. Many people traveled through Nixa, because it was a half-day ride with a team of horses from Springfield. Wagon drivers found it a convenient stopover site when hauling freight between Springfield and Arkansas. The community was first known as \"Faughts\". \nAn early resident, Nicholas A. Inman, was a blacksmith from Tennessee who set up a shop in 1852. When a post office was opened, a town meeting was held to decide on a name for the community. Because of his years of service to the community it was suggested the town be named for him. Another suggestion was to call it \"nix\" because the community was \"nothing but a crossroads\". It was finally decided to take the name Nix and add the first letter of Inman's middle name, \"a\", to get the unique name Nixa. The village of Nixa incorporated on June 10, 1902.\nGeography.\nNixa is located at (37.045253, -93.298755). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land. The modern day city rests on and around seven hills.\nEducation.\nAll the schools in Nixa are public. Currently, the Nixa R-2 School District operates four elementary schools for students in kindergarten through fourth grade. These are Matthews, Espy, Century, and the newest, High Pointe Elementary (named so because it sits on the highest elevation in Christian County), opened in August 2007. There are also two intermediate schools for students in the fifth and sixth grades\u2014Inman and Summit. There is one junior high school and one high school. There is also a magnet school for Kindergarten through 6th grade- John Thomas School of Discovery (JTSD). The old Main Street Elementary School building has become an administration building, named Faught Administration Center. The district is widely considered one of the best school districts in Missouri. The district has received the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education's Distinction in Performance Award for each of the last five years. Its Missouri Assessment Program (MAP) scores surpassed state averages in all 10 assessments. Nixa High School is ranked one of the best in the nation by U.S. News &amp; World Report.\nMovie and TV references.\nIn the Robert Ludlum novels and movies (fiction), Nixa, Missouri is the birthplace of the character Jason Bourne. It was revealed in \"The Bourne Supremacy\" that Bourne's real name was David Webb and that he was born in Nixa, Missouri.\nSeveral streets in a neighborhood northeast of downtown are named for performers on ABC-TV's \"Ozark Jubilee\", including Nixa native Slim Wilson. They include Slim Wilson Boulevard, Red Foley Court, Zed Tennis Street, Bill Ring Court, (Speedy) Haworth Court and Ozark Jubilee Drive.\nA 2013 episode of the Investigation Discovery television series \"Beauty Queen Murder\" featured a murder in Nixa\u2014the 1985 death of Jackie Johns. The murder was not solved until 2007, when DNA evidence proved that fellow Nixa resident Gerald Carnahan had raped and murdered the young lady."}

{"id": "531760", "revid": "1156993", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=531760", "title": "Undertale", "text": "Undertale (also written as UNDERTALE) is a role-playing video game made by Toby Fox, an independent artist.\nIn the game, players control a human child who has fallen into the Underground, a large and out-of-the-way place under a mountain, separated from the rest of the world by a magic wall called the Barrier. The player meets many kinds of monsters as they try to return to the surface, mainly through the fighting system; the player takes turns selecting actions and avoiding attacks made of many bullets, and can choose to befriend or subdue monsters so that they won't get killed. The player's choices change many things in the game, including how characters act, and what kind of story it is.\nFox developed almost the whole game by himself. He wrote the words and made the music by himself, and only used a few pieces of extra art given to him by other artists. The game was inspired by the \"Mother\" and \"Mario &amp; Luigi\" role-playing series, the \"bullet hell\" shooter series \"Touhou Project\", and the British comedy show \"Mr. Bean\". \"Undertale\" was originally meant to be two hours long and released in mid-2014, but creating the game took over three years, making the story longer and not making the game available until much later.\nThe game was released on Steam for Microsoft Windows and OS X on September 15, 2015. When it was released, the game was praised for its writing, themes, easy-to-learn fighting system, music, and original ideas; with praise directed towards its story, dialogue, and characters. The game sold over a million copies, and was nominated for many honors and awards, including Game of the Year from many gaming news sources, winning others from conventions including South by Southwest.\nGameplay.\n\"Undertale\" is a role-playing game that shows everything from above. In the game, players control a child and finish tasks in order to go forward in the story. Players explore an underground world of towns and areas, and must solve many puzzles on the way. The underground world is the home of monsters, many of whom fight the player; players decide to fight, run away, act, or make friends with them.\nWhen players meet enemies in either scripted events or random encounters, they enter a battle mode. During battles, players control a small red heart which represents their soul, and must avoid attacks shot by the monster(s) in a way much like a bullet hell shooter. Later the game, new types of gameplay are shown. These include blue-colored bullets that only hurt when the player is moving, or orange bullets that only hurt when staying still. Boss battles often introduce these coloured bullet mechanics. Players can use the FIGHT option to attack, which involves timed button presses. Players can also use the ACT option to do many different actions, which are different for each enemy, usually for a peaceful resolution. Players can also use the ITEM option to eat food to heal, or to put on weapons or armor. Players can also use the MERCY option to spare enemies or run away. Monsters can be spared only if they have been beaten up enough to make them weak and unable to fight, or if they have been pleased by the right actions. In order for some boss battles to be completed without involving murder, the player must survive until the character they are facing has finished their dialogue. The game has many story branches and endings depending on whether players choose to murder or spare their enemies; and as such, it is possible to clear the game without murdering a single enemy. Players earn EXP and gold for killing monsters.\u00a0\nMonsters will talk with players during the battles, and the game will often tell the players what the monster's feelings and actions are. Enemy attacks can change based on how players interact with them: if the player chooses non-violent options, enemy attacks are easy, but they become harder if players choose violent options. The game uses many metafictional elements in both its gameplay and story. When players play in a boss battle more than once, the dialogue will change depending on actions from the times they played the battle before.\nDeltarune.\nIn late October 2018, Toby fox hinted at the release of a new game called \"Deltarune\", which was released on 31 October, on his Twitter page. This new game is set in a similar world to \"Undertale\" and is familiar to previous players of \"Undertale\". It follows the story of a human, a monster and a \"darkner\" to bring balance to the world.\nCurrently, only Chapter 1 and 2 have been released; Fox plans to create a development team and release the full game, with one ending only, when it is complete."}

A \"ranking\" is the assignment of \"first\", \"second\", \"third\", etc. to different observations of a variable. A rank correlation coefficient measures the degree of similarity between two rankings.\nOne might test for \"do colleges with a higher-ranked basketball program tend to have a higher-ranked football program?\" A quite important question is \"do people with higher-ranked education tend to get higher levels of income?\"\nSome of the most used rank correlation statistics are\nAn increasing rank correlation coefficient implies increasing agreement between rankings. The coefficient is inside the interval [\u22121,\u00a01] and assumes the value:\nKerby simple difference formula.\nDave Kerby recommended the rank-biserial as the measure to introduce students to rank correlation, because the general logic can be explained at an introductory level. \nKerby showed that this rank correlation can be expressed in terms of two figures: the percent of data that support a stated hypothesis, and the percent of data that do not support it. The Kerby simple difference formula states that the rank correlation can be expressed as the difference between the proportion of favorable evidence (\"f\") minus the proportion of unfavorable evidence (\"u\"). \nAn illustration.\nSuppose a coach trains long-distance runners for one month using two methods. Group A has 5 runners, and Group B has 4 runners. The hypothesis is that method A produces faster runners. The race to assess the results finds that the runners from Group A do indeed run faster, with the following ranks: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. The slower runners from Group B thus have ranks of 5, 7, 8, and 9. \nThe analysis is done on pairs, a member of one group compared to a member of the other group. For example, the fastest runner in the study is a member of four pairs: (1,5), (1,7), (1,8), and (1,9). All four of these pairs support the hypothesis, because in each pair the runner from Group A is faster than the runner from Group B. There are a total of 20 pairs, and 19 pairs support the hypothesis. The only pair which does not support the hypothesis are the two runners with ranks 5 and 6, because in this pair, the runner from Group B had the faster time. By the Kerby simple difference formula, 95% of the data support the hypothesis (19 of 20 pairs), and 5% do not support (1 of 20 pairs), so the rank correlation is r = .95 - .05 = .90.\nThe maximum value for the correlation is r = 1, which means that 100% of the pairs favor the hypothesis. A correlation of r = 0 indicates that half the pairs favor the hypothesis and half do not. An effect size of r = 0 describes \"no relationship\" between group membership and the members' ranks."}

Most often the writ is from a judge. It is used by law enforcement to take actions such as searching for evidence, making an arrest or seizing property.\nSearch warrant.\nIn the United States, in order for police and other law enforcement personnel to search for evidence, they need a warrant. They must also have probable cause (a good reason to believe they will find evidence of a crime). A search warrant must be signed by a judge or magistrate. The officer must provide a sworn statement of fact called an affidavit. If the judge or magistrate believes the affidavit establishes probable cause, he or she approves the warrant. A warrant is usually for a specific period of time and spells out exactly what the officers may search for and seize.\nArrest warrant.\nUnited States.\nIn many cases an arrest warrant is not needed. If a police officer personally sees someone committing a crime, the officer may arrest that individual without a warrant. An officer may also arrest someone if they have probable cause to believe the person had committed or were about to commit a crime. For example, a police officer is notified a bank has just been robbed and is given a description of the suspect. The single robber left in a dark blue Ford Mustang. The officer stops a dark blue Ford Mustang with bags of money on the back seat (in plain sight) and the driver matches the description. The officer believes he has probable cause and arrests the driver. \nIf the person is in his (or her) own home and the crime is not a serious one, an officer needs an arrest warrant.\nEuropean Union.\nIn the European Union a European Arrest Warrant (EAW) is most often used between member countries in place of a lengthy extradition process.

Since that time they are used to arrest dangerous criminals who flee across borders in Europe.\nJapan.\nIn Japan, an officer may arrest a person they believe may have committed a crime. They can detain the person for up to 48 hours. The police are required to inform the person why they were arrested. During the 48 hour period, the person may be brought before a prosecutor if the police have enough evidence. If the prosecutor believes the evidence is enough, they request a warrant of detention before a judge within 24 hours. The defendant appears before the judge when the warrant is requested. The case may be dropped for lack of evidence either before the prosecutor or before the judge.\nReferences.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

Some examples are:\nSigns and symptoms.\nThe signs and symptoms of a brain injury depend on many things.\nDiffuse or focal.\nA \"diffuse\" injury hurts the entire brain. For example, if a person is drowning, and cannot breathe, no part of their brain will get oxygen. If this lasts long enough, the entire brain will be injured by not having enough oxygen.\nA \"focal\" injury hurts just part of the brain. For example, in some strokes, a person has a blood clot that blocks the blood flow to just part of their brain. If the person gets good medical treatment, just that part of their brain may be injured.\nThis is important because different parts of the brain control different things. When a person has a focal brain injury, their symptoms will depend on what part of the brain was injured. For example, if a part of the brain that controls speech was injured, the person may have trouble speaking.\nSeverity.\nA brain injury's symptoms may also depend on how bad the injury was.\nFor example, brain injuries can cause changes or problems in a person's thinking, senses, feelings, or ability to move. However, some people might have mild problems in these areas, while other people might have more serious problems:\nRecovery.\nThere are many different treatments that may help people with brain injuries.

The amniotic sac is filled with amniotic fluid, which protects the fetus. \nDevelopment.\nThe amniotic sac starts to form and fill with amniotic fluid just days after a woman gets pregnant. At first, the amniotic fluid is made from the mother's plasma (the liquid part of her blood).\nAt first, the amniotic fluid is made mostly of water with electrolytes (salts). However, by the 12th to the 14th week of pregnancy, proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, phospholipids, and urea are all in the amniotic fluid. These things help the fetus grow.\nAs the fetus gets bigger, more amniotic fluid gets created. By the time the baby is born, there is about one liter of amniotic fluid in the amniotic sac.\nPurpose.\nThe amniotic fluid.\nThe amniotic fluid is very important in protecting the fetus and helping the fetus grow:\nAfter the fetus is about four months old, when the kidneys start to work, the amniotic fluid serves another important purpose. The fetus swallows amniotic fluid. This fluid passes through the fetus's digestive system and urinary system and gets urinated out into the amniotic fluid. This helps the fetus \"practice\" swallowing, digesting, and urinating before being born.\nThe amniotic sac.\nThe amniotic sac has two layers, which have two different jobs. The inside layer holds in the fetus and the amniotic fluid. The outside layer attaches to the umbilical cord, so that blood and oxygen from the mother can get through the amniotic sac and to the fetus.\nTesting.\nA sample of amniotic fluid can show whether a fetus has certain genetic disorders or infections. A test called an amniocentesis can take a sample of amniotic fluid with a needle and study it for problems.\nBirth.\nWhen a woman starts to give birth, the amniotic sac should break and the amniotic fluid will leak out the woman's vagina. This is often called the time when a woman's \"water breaks.\" Doctors call it \"rupture of membranes.\"\nOnce the baby is born, the amniotic sac is pushed out of the woman's vagina in the afterbirth, along with the placenta."}

Ohio, 367 U.S. 643 (1961), was a landmark decision in criminal procedure. The United States Supreme Court ruled that evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment may not be used at trial in a state court.\nCircumstances.\nOn May 23, 1957, in Cleveland, Ohio, three police officers arrived at the home of a Miss Mapp, the appellant. The officers said they had information a bombing suspect was in the house and demanded entry. After telephoning her attorney, she refused to admit them without a search warrant. The officers watched the house until more officers arrived. Three hours later and with four more police officers, they again demanded entrance to the home. When Mapp did not come to the door immediately, a door was forced open and the police entered. At about the same time, Mapp's attorney arrived, but was refused permission to see his client or to enter the home. When Mapp was halfway down the stairs she demanded to see the search warrant. A piece of paper was flashed at her which she grabbed and hid on her person. The officers grabbed her to physically recover the paper. The paper was not a warrant. The police did not find the bombing suspect. However, they did find books and photographs they said were sexually explicit. At trial, the prosecution did not produce a search warrant or prove one was ever issued. Mapp was convicted of violating Ohio state law prohibiting \u201clewd, lascivious, or obscene material.\u201d She was sentenced to one to seven years in prison. Mapp appealed the conviction based on her First Amendment rights.\nOhio Supreme Court.\nThe Supreme Court of Ohio heard the case. The court believed an argument could be made for reversing the case because of the way the evidence was obtained. But they did not determine the evidence was taken from Mapp's person by the use of brutalforce against the defendant. They added that even if the search was made without authority, it could be used at the state trial. They ruled the Fourteenth Amendment does not forbid the admission of evidence gained by unreasonable search and seizure. Therefore, her appeal was denied. \nUS Supreme Court decision.\nIn their decision, the court ruled in favor of Mapp and overturned her conviction. In the 6-3 decision, the court found the states were also required to exclude evidence seized in violation of a person's Fourth Amendment rights. They stated that any evidence obtained in searches and seizures that violated the Constitution were not admissible in state courts. Otherwise, there would be no right against unreasonable search and seizure. Associate justice Tom C. Clark delivered the majority opinion."}

According to evolutionary theory, this competition within and between species for resources plays a role in natural selection.\nCompetition occurs when organisms or species need or use the same resources. Common resources are food, water and territory.\nTwo species in competition often continue long-term in the same environment. This suggests they each have an \"edge\" which the other does not. In may cases \"being there first\" is a big edge. For example, plants consume nitrogen by absorbing it into their roots, making nitrogen unavailable to nearby plants. \nSpecies in competition may directly interfere with each other. An example of this can be seen between the ant \"Novomessor cockerelli\" and red harvester ants, where the first interferes with the ability of the second to forage. It does this by plugging the entrances to their rival's colonies with small rocks."}

She was the daughter of King Ae\u00ebtes of Colchis, niece of Circe, granddaughter of the sun god Helios. She married the hero Jason, and had two children with him, Mermeros and Pheres. In Euripides's play \"Medea\", Jason leaves Medea when Creon, king of Corinth, offers him his daughter, Glauce. The play tells of Medea avenging her husband's betrayal by killing their children.\nThe myths involving Jason have been interpreted as part of a class of myths that tell how the Hellenes of the distant heroic age, before the Trojan War, faced the challenges of the pre-Greek \"Pelasgian\" cultures of mainland Greece, the Aegean and Anatolia. Jason, Perseus, Theseus, and above all Heracles, are all figures on the threshold between the old world of shamans, earth deities, and the new Bronze Age Greek ways.\nMedea figures in the myth of Jason and the Argonauts, a myth known best from a late literary version worked up by Apollonius of Rhodes in the 3rd century BC and called the \"Argonautica.\" However, for all its self-consciousness and researched archaic vocabulary, the late epic was based on very old, scattered materials. Medea is known in most stories as an enchantress and is often depicted as a priestess of the goddess Hecate or a witch. The myth of Jason and Medea is very old, originally written around the time Hesiod wrote the \"Theogony\". It was known to the composer of the \"Little Iliad\", part of the Epic Cycle."}

As a whole, the Fourteenth Amendment marked a large shift in American constitutionalism. It applied substantially more constitutional restrictions against the states than had applied before the Civil War.\nThe meaning of the Equal Protection Clause has been the subject of much debate. It has inspired the well-known phrase \"Equal Justice Under Law\". These words are inscribed\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0U.S.\u00a0Supreme court building. This clause was the basis for \"Brown v.

In the case where the trial court made an egregious error in its finding of facts, the state supreme court will send the case back to the trial court for a new trial. This responsibility of correcting the errors of inferior courts is the origin of a number of the different names for supreme courts in various state court systems. The court consists of a panel of judges selected by methods outlined in the state constitution. \nMany states elect their state Supreme Court justices and/or use elections to retain judges. Since 2000, the amount of money raised by judicial candidates has risen enormously. Special interest groups have contributed to many of these campaigns raising questions of impartiality.

This activity became known as Mergers and Acquisitions and today falls into the category of investment banking.

A person who has become forced to migrate is called a \"forced migrant\" or \"displaced person\".

Forced migration occurs when people's lives, well-being or freedom is endangered. They may have little or no choice but to move. In some cases, such as human trafficking and slavery, people are physically removed from their homes.\nOccasionally a government forces people and communities out of their homes or homelands for the purposes of economic development or military. It has been most often been associated with the building of dams and military bases.\nMigration can also be forced by natural disasters, when people are forced to evacuate an area. This is usually temporary, and people can return to their land once it is safe.\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees says Afghanistan produces the most number of refugees each year. It has held that position for 32 years. Almost half of refugees are children under the age of 18. Many of these are separated from their parents."}

{"id": "532089", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=532089", "title": "Freedom Trail", "text": "The Freedom Trail is a walking trail through Boston, Massachusetts. It passes by 16 places that are important to American history. The Trail is 2.5\u00a0miles (4.0\u00a0km) long. It starts at the Boston Common and ends at the USS \"Constitution\" in the Charlestown Navy Yard.\nThe Black Heritage Trail crosses the Freedom Trail between the Massachusetts State House and Park Street Church.\nCreation.\nWilliam Schofield, a journalist in Boston, first thought of creating the Freedom Trail. In 1951, he suggested building a walking trail to connect many of the important historic places in Boston. Boston's mayor, John Hynes, agreed. The Trail was marked with red bricks and red paint, and signs were added along the way to explain the importance of the Trail's 16 stops. By 1953, 40,000 people were walking the Freedom Trail every year.\nThe City of Boston's Freedom Trail Commission is in charge of the Trail. The costs of keeping up the Trail are supported by grants from non-profit organizations and foundations; philanthropy; donations; and Boston National Historical Park.\nStops on the Trail.\nThe Boston Common.\nThe Boston Common is America's oldest public park. When the Puritans came to Boston, they bought the land from William Blackstone, who was the first European person to settle in Boston. The Puritans turned the land into a \"Common Area\" where people could bring their cows to eat grass.\nThe Common was also used to punish and hang people.\nIn 1775, when the British Army occupied Boston just before the American Revolution started, over 1,000 British soldiers camped and trained on the Common.\nThe Common has also been used for many other things, including:\nThe Massachusetts State House.\nThe State House is where the Massachusetts state government does business. It was built in 1798 on land that used to be John Hancock's cow pasture. It is topped by a big dome which Paul Revere coated with golden copper.\nOn the way.\nOn the way from the Common to the State House, the Trail passes a monument to Robert Gould Shaw and the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment. This was the first all-black volunteer regiment in the American Civil War.\nPark Street Church.\nBuilt in 1809, Park Street Church was once the tallest building in Boston. The Church became an important supporter of the abolitionist (anti-slavery) movement. On Independence Day in 1829, William Lloyd Garrison made his first major speech against slavery at the Church.\nDuring the War of 1812, the Church's members stored brimstone (which is used to make gunpowder) in the Church's basement.\nGranary Burying Ground.\nGranary Burying Ground is a very old cemetery, created in 1660. Many important people are buried here, including:\nMany other Bostonians are also buried here.\nKing's Chapel.\nKing's Chapel was the first Anglican church in Boston. It was built in 1688, on land that was part of a burying ground (cemetery). At that time, most people in Boston were Puritans. King James II, who wanted the colonists to follow the Church of England, ordered that an Anglican parish should be built in Boston. However, nobody in Boston would sell good land to build a non-Puritan church. Because of this, the King ruled that a piece of burying ground would be taken and used for the church.\nKing's Chapel Burying Ground.\nKing's Chapel Burying Ground was Boston's first cemetery. (It was created before King's Chapel.) Many important Bostonians were buried here, including:\nBenjamin Franklin statue and Boston Latin School.\nBoston Latin School was the first public school in America. It opened on April 23, 1635. Boys could go to school there for free, whether they were rich or poor. (Girls were taught at home.) Five signers of the Declaration of Independence went to school at Boston Latin:\nThe original Boston Latin School was torn down in 1745, but a statue of Benjamin Franklin marks the spot where the original school was. Boston Latin School still exists today in a different place (and now teaches both boys and girls).\nOld Corner Bookstore.\nThe Old Corner Bookstore is the oldest business building in Boston. It was built in 1718 as an apothecary shop.\nBefore it became a business, Anne Hutchinson lived in this building. She used to hold religious meetings in her home, where she would read scripture. Sometimes as many as 80 people would come to the meetings. This was more than 10% of Boston's population at the time. Eventually Hutchinson was accused of heresy for preaching without being a preacher. (At that time, no women were allowed to be preachers, and Hutchinson's ideas also disagreed with the Puritans'.) Hutchinson was excommunicated and exiled to Rhode Island in 1638.\nIn the 1800s, the Old Corner Bookstore was one of the United States' most important book publishing companies. It published books written by many famous authors, who would also meet at the Bookstore. These authors included:\nOld South Meeting House.\nThe Old South Meeting House was built in 1729 so that Puritans could meet there to pray. Benjamin Franklin was baptized here. The church's famous members included:\nSome of the events that led up to the American Revolutionary War happened at Old South Church. For example, five thousand people met at Old South Meeting House just before the Boston Tea Party in 1773. They were trying to decide what to do with the tea that was waiting on ships in Boston Harbor. After the British passed the Tea Act, Bostonians would have to pay taxes on the tea even though they had no say in whether the taxes were fair or not. They tried to have the tea sent back to England, but they were unable to. After this, Samuel Adams got up and said, \"This meeting can do nothing more to save the country.\" This was a secret signal to tell the Sons of Liberty to go destroy the tea. This is how the Boston Tea Party started.\nSeveral years later, when British soldiers were occupying Boston, they got revenge on Old South Church for its role in the Boston Tea Party. They ripped out the church's pews (benches) and turned the church into a horse stable. They used Old South Church to teach British cavalry soldiers how to ride horses. After the Revolutionary War was over, in 1783, the church's members fixed the building up into a church again.\nOn the way.\nThe Irish Potato Famine memorial statue is on the way to the Old South Meeting House. During the Irish Potato Famine, over one million Irish people died. Another million Irish people immigrated to the United States, mostly to Boston. The statue shows a family that was dying of starvation, who became strong and healthy again after moving to Boston.\nOld State House.\nThe Old State House was built in 1713. The Massachusetts Bay Colony's colonial government worked there. The Old State House was very important in starting the American Revolution. In 1768, the colony's House of Representatives decided that people in Massachusetts should refuse to pay taxes to the British. The British decided to get rid of the colony's legislature, and also sent soldiers to occupy Boston.\nIn 1776, the Declaration of Independence was read to the people of Boston for the first time from the balcony of the Old State House.\nSite of the Boston Massacre.\nThe Boston Massacre happened just in front of the Old State House, in 1770. After British soldiers occupied Boston, many people in Boston got angrier and angrier. On March 5, 1770, an angry mob of Bostonians surrounded British soldiers. Somebody yelled \"fire,\" and the British soldiers started shooting their guns. Five Bostonians were killed.\nAfter news about the Boston Massacre spread throughout the Thirteen Colonies, people became angrier at the British. The Boston Massacre made more people want to fight the British for independence.\nFaneuil Hall.\nA rich merchant named Peter Faneuil built Faneuil Hall in 1741. He meant Faneuil Hall to be a place for trade and business. However, it became an important meeting place for people who wanted to fight against British rule. The Sons of Liberty met there and announced that they would fight back against the British. Leaders like Samuel Adams gave speeches there encouraging independence.\nAmerica's first town meeting was held at Faneuil Hall. Americans first met there in 1764 to protest the Sugar Act and the Stamp Act. Later, they would meet there to protest the Tea Act, the Townshend Duties, and the British occupation of Boston.\nOn top of Faneuil Hall, there is a famous weathervane (which tells which way the wind is blowing). It is shaped like a golden grasshopper. Legend says that Bostonians used this weathervane during the War of 1812 to find spies. If a person did not know the answer to the question \"What is on top of Faneuil Hall?\", they were suspected of being a spy.\nIn the 19th century, abolitionists like Frederick Douglass, William Lloyd Garrison, and Lucy Stone spoke against slavery at Faneuil Hall.\nPaul Revere's House.\nThe Paul Revere house is the oldest building in downtown Boston that is still standing. It was built around 1680. Revere bought it in 1770. He lived here when he made his famous \"Midnight Ride\".\nOld North Church.\nThe Old North Church is the oldest church in Boston that is still standing. This Episcopal church opened in 1723. The first bells ever brought to America were put in its steeple.\nBecause the steeple was the tallest in Boston at the time, it played an important role just before the American Revolution started. Just before the Battles of Lexington and Concord, the first battles of the Revolution, the British had two choices for how they could get to Lexington and Concord. They could walk, or they could row across the Charles River. The Sons of Liberty hung two lanterns in the church's steeple to signal that British soldiers were crossing the Charles River. This helped the Americans figure out the best way to defend against the British.\nCopp's Hill Burying Ground.\nCopp's Hill Burying Ground was the largest cemetery in colonial Boston. It was created in 1659. Famous people who are buried here include:\nBritish soldiers put their cannons at Copp's Hill Burying Ground during the Battle of Bunker Hill.\nThe Bunker Hill Monument.\nThe Bunker Hill Monument honors the Battle of Bunker Hill. This was the first major battle of the American Revolution. Though the British won this battle, it was so difficult for them to win that the battle proved the Americans would not be easy to beat.\nThe USS \"Constitution\".\nUntil May 2015, the USS \"Constitution\" was the oldest warship in the world that still floated. It was first put into the water in 1797. The \"Constitution\" became famous during the War of 1812. The ship got the nickname \"Old Ironsides\" because cannonballs would bounce off the wooden sides of the ship like they were made of iron.\nThe \"Constitution\" is still a United States Navy warship."}

{"id": "532197", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=532197", "title": "Exsanguination", "text": "Exsanguination is losing enough blood to cause death. A person does not have to lose all of their blood to exsanguinate. People can die from losing half to two-thirds of their blood.\nThe average adult has about 4 to 6 liters of blood (9 to 12 US pints) in their body. The average man has more blood than the average woman, and people who weigh more or are taller than others have more blood. This means a person can die from losing 2 1/2 to 4 liters of blood. To compare, this is five to eight times as much blood as people usually give in a blood donation.\nChildren and babies have much less blood than adults, and can exsanguinate by losing much less blood than adults.\nExsanguination is often called bleeding to death or bleeding out. It is a medical emergency.\nDefinition.\nDoctors define exsanguination this way:\nTypes of bleeding.\nBleeding can be \"external\" or \"internal\".\n\"External\" means \"outside the body.\" External bleeding is visible - it can be seen outside the body. For example, a person who cuts their hand and has blood on their hand is having external bleeding.\n\"Internal\" means \"inside the body.\" Internal bleeding cannot be seen, because it is inside the body. For example, a person who is bleeding into their brain because of a stroke is having internal bleeding.\nSometimes, bleeding can be both internal and external. A person can exsanguinate from internal bleeding, external bleeding, or both.\nCauses.\nExsanguination is usually caused by major blood vessels getting injured or breaking open. Smaller blood vessels bleed less, and bleed slower, so it is harder to exsanguinate if they are injured.\nInjuries.\nExsanguination can be caused by trauma (injuries). Out of all people who die from injuries, 30-40% die from exsanguination. Up to half of these people (33-56%) die before they even get to the hospital.\nPenetrating trauma (an injury where something breaks the skin) is one of the most common causes of exsanguination. This is especially true for gunshot wounds to places like the heart, chest, or head, which all have major blood vessels in them.\nOther injuries that can cause exsanguination include:\nA person can exsanguinate from internal bleeding if:\nExsanguination is one of the most common causes of death in soldiers at war. It is usually caused by gunshot wounds, motor vehicle accidents, or explosions.\nMedical problems.\nSome medical problems can make a person exsanguinate by bleeding internally. These problems include:\nEffects.\nIf a person is losing blood very quickly (for example, from a broken aortic aneurysm), they will only be conscious for 20 seconds to a few minutes. If blood loss is slower, and the person does not get medical treatment, they may be conscious for a few hours. However, they will get more and more confused and tired as they lose more blood. Eventually the person will go into a coma because there is not enough blood left in their body to bring oxygen to their brain. Finally their heart will stop and they will die.\nExsanguination is a syndrome.\nDoctors call exsanguination a syndrome (a group of symptoms), because it causes so many problems in the body.\nHypothermia.\nBlood helps keep us warm. Because of this, losing a lot of blood causes hypothermia.\nCoagulopathy.\nCoagulopathy means that the blood no longer clots normally. When a person loses blood, they also lose the platelets and blood-clotting proteins the blood carried. These platelets and proteins make the blood clot. If a person loses too much blood, they will not have enough platelets or proteins left to make the blood clot.\nAcidosis.\nAcidosis means that the body makes too much acid. Usually, the body makes energy out of oxygen carried in the blood and glucose (sugar); this is called aerobic respiration. If a person loses a lot of blood, there will not be enough oxygen in the blood that is left to make energy this way. The body switches to anaerobic respiration and makes energy out of glucose without needing oxygen. However, this creates many acidic waste products (chemicals that the body does not need, which are left over after the body does chemical reactions). Eventually, these waste products can build up so much that they poison the body. This is called acidosis.\nArrhythmia.\nWhen the heart does not get enough blood, it can start beating in ways that are not normal. When this happens because of exsanguination, it usually means that the patient is close to dying.\nShock.\nIf a person loses enough blood, they will go into shock. This means the body's most important organs are not getting the blood, oxygen, and nutrients they need to survive. It also means that the body is not able to get rid of waste products, like acids. If shock gets bad enough, it will kill the person.\nTreatment.\nFirst aid.\nFirst aid is an important first step in treating exsanguination. Things that regular people can do to help include:\nIf possible, a person giving first aid should wear gloves any time they touch another person's blood. The sick or injured person may have an infection that can be spread through blood, like HIV or hepatitis. Wearing gloves will protect the person giving first aid from getting these infections.\nFirst aid saved many lives during the Boston Marathon bombings, when ordinary people used belts for tourniquets or used their own hands to press against bleeding wounds. The three people who died in the bombings died right away. There were many other people who were hurt badly enough that they could have exsanguinated. For example, some people's legs were blown off by the bombs.

This amendment codifies the right to a jury trial in certain civil cases. It also stops courts from overturning a jury's verdict. The Seventh Amendment's provision for jury trials in civil cases has never been incorporated (applied to the states). However, the rights to civil jury trials are found in nearly every state constitution.\nThe prohibition of overturning a jury's verdict applies to federal cases, state cases involving federal law, and to review of state cases by federal courts. \"United States v. Wonson\" (1812) established the \"historical test\", which interpreted the amendment as relying on English common law to determine whether a jury trial was necessary in a civil lawsuit. The amendment thus does not guarantee trial by jury in cases under maritime law, in lawsuits against the government itself, and for many parts of patent claims. In all other cases, the jury can be waived by consent of the parties. The amendment also guarantees a minimum of six members for a jury in a civil trial. \nBackground.\nThe 7th Amendment was ratified on December 15, 1791 as one of ten amendments in the Bill of Rights. But the background for its passing began in England during the 12th century. At the time juries were made up of 12 men who gave their opinions in a trial. The 12-man jury originally included the accusers against the defendant, a supposed enemy of the king. Eventually this led to a system where the jury made a verdict based on evidence. The practice followed English colonists to the American colonies. But juries became a tool used to express American discontent with British rule. A series of Navigation Acts prohibited the American colonies from trading directly with the Netherlands, Spain, France, and their colonies. As more and more trade restriction were imposed, the American colonists turned to smuggling. When smugglers were caught, they were brought before juries made up of other colonists. These sympathetic juries often acquitted their fellow colonists. The king, angered at these lawbreakers going free, created new courts that did not allow juries. This was a breach of common law practice and infringed on their rights as British citizens. After the American Revolutionary War, the Seventh Amendment was written to expressly limit the powers of the executive and the Judicial branches of the new federal government."}

Many illegal drugs and medications can be given intravenously.\nBenefits of intravenous injection.\nDrugs and medications work very fast when given intravenously, because they go right into the bloodstream. They reach the brain and start working in a minute or less. Also, when a drug is given intravenously, 100% of the drug gets into the bloodstream.\nWhen medications are given in other ways, they do not work as fast. Also, not all of the drug reaches the bloodstream.\nHowever, medications given by IV do not last as long as medicines given by mouth As soon as the drug reaches the bloodstream, the body begins to break it down so the body can get rid of it.\nTypes of intravenous injections.\nThere are two types of intravenous injections.\nSingle injection.\nSometimes, people inject just one drug into a vein with a needle. Then they take the needle out.\nWhen people use illegal drugs like heroin intravenously, they use a single injection. They shoot the drug into their veins, and then take the needle out.\nIntravenous line.\nThe second type of IV injection is called an \"intravenous (IV) line.\" This is usually what medical professionals mean when they say a patient is getting an IV.\nTo do an IV line, a medical professional will:\nAn IV line allows medical professionals to give different liquids at different times, without having to put a needle into a vein every time. They can also give many medications at the same time.\nMedical uses.\nIntravenous lines are often used in emergency medicine. Many things can be given through an IV line.\nVolume expanders.\nVolume expanders are special fluids that are used when a person has lost some of the fluids in their body. For example, a person might lose fluids because of dehydration or bleeding. Volume expanders are used to replace these lost fluids. They are called \"volume expanders\" because they expand (increase) the volume of liquid in the bloodstream.\nLosing too much fluid is dangerous. People need liquid in their bloodstream to carry blood cells, glucose (sugar), electrolytes (salts), and many other important things. Usually, the blood plasma (the liquid part of blood) does this job. However, people can lose plasma for several reasons. For example:\nVolume expanders add to the amount of liquid in the bloodstream. They help plasma do its job.\nCommon volume expanders.\nThere are a few common volume expanders. They are mixtures of liquids and other things the body loses when a person loses fluid:\nMedications.\nMany medications can be given by IV. They can be given by themselves, or mixed into volume expanders.\nExamples of medications that can be given by IV include:\nBlood.\nBlood transfusions are usually given through an IV line. A blood transfusion can give a person regular blood, or only parts of the blood, like:\nNutrition.\nIf a person cannot eat for a short time, nutrition can be given through an IV line. IV nutrition mixtures include water, electrolytes, glucose, amino acids, lipids (fats), and vitamins.\nIntravenous drug use.\nIntravenous drug use means injecting illegal drugs into a vein. Illegal drugs that can be injected intravenously include:\nSometimes, people also dissolve prescription medications in water and inject them intravenously. For example, some people dissolve oxycodone or benzodiazepines and inject them.\nPeople use drugs intravenously because it is one of the fastest ways to get the effects of the drug. When a person uses drugs intravenously, the drugs start working within 15 to 30 seconds.\nDangers.\nUsing drugs intravenously can cause many problems.\nInfections.\nIf a person uses a needle that is not clean to inject drugs, they can get an infection. Common infections caused by IV drug use include:\nAn IV drug user can also get some infectious diseases by using the same needles as people who have those diseases. HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and many other infections can be spread by sharing needles.\nIn the world, 40-60% of IV drug users have hepatitis B, and 60-70% have hepatitis C.\nOverdose.\nPeople are more likely to overdose when they use drugs intravenously. There are a few reasons for this:\nProblems with veins.\nWhen an IV drug user injects drugs into their veins over and over again, they can damage their veins. The veins can get scarred and eventually collapse. This leaves marks over the scarred veins that are called \"track marks.\""}

The word \"flautist\" is used, but much less often.\nHistory.\nThere are many stories about how different Native American peoples invented the Native American flute.\nIn one story, a woodpecker pecked holes in the branch of a tree while searching for termites.\nWhen the wind blew along the holes, people heard music.\nIt is not well known how the design of the Native American flute developed before 1823.\nSome of the influences may have been:\nIt is also possible that instruments were carried from other cultures during migrations.\nThe oldest Native American flute made of wood is from 1823. It is now in a museum in Bergamo, Italy.\nParts.\nThe Native American flute has two parts:\nthe \"slow air chamber\" and the \"sound chamber\".\nA \"plug\" inside the instrument separates the slow air chamber from the sound chamber.\nThe parts of the Native American flute can have many alternate names.\nThe plug is sometimes called the \"internal wall\".\nThe slow air chamber is also called the \"SAC\", the \"compression chamber\", or the \"mouth chamber\".\nThe sound chamber is also called the \"pipe body\",\nthe \"playing chamber\", the \"resonating chamber\", the \"tone chamber\", or the \"variable tube\".\nThe \"block\" on the outside of the instrument is a separate part that can be removed.\nThe block is also called the \"bird\", the \"fetish\", the \"saddle\", or the \"totem\".\nThe block is tied by a \"strap\" onto the \"nest\" of the flute.\nThe block moves air through a \"flue\" from the slow air chamber to the sound chamber.\nThe block is often in the shape of a bird.\nThe slow air chamber has a \"mouthpiece\" and \"breath hole\" for the player's breath.\nAir flows through the slow air chamber and up the \"exit hole\" into the flue.\nThe sound chamber contains the \"sound hole\", which creates the vibration of air that causes sound when the airflow\nreaches the \"splitting edge\".\nThe sound hole can also be called the \"whistle hole\", the \"window\", or the \"true sound hole\" (\"TSH\").\nThe splitting edge can also be called the \"cutting edge\", the \"fipple edge\", the \"labium\", or the \"sound edge\".\nThe sound chamber also has \"finger holes\" that allows the player to change the\nfrequency of the vibrating air.\nChanging the frequency of the vibration changes the pitch of the sound produced.\nThe finger holes on a Native American flute are \"open\", meaning that fingers of the player cover the finger hole\n(rather than metal levers or pads such as those on a clarinet).\nThis means that the player must be able to reach all the finger holes on the instrument with their fingers.\nThe finger holes can also be called the \"note holes\", the \"playing holes\", the \"tone holes\", or the \"stops\".\nThe \"foot end\" of the flute \u2014 the end far away from the player's mouth \u2014 can have \"direction holes\".\nThese holes affect the pitch of the flute when all the finger holes are covered.\nThey also relate to the \"Four Directions\" of\nEast, South, West, and North found in many Native American stories.\nThe direction holes can also be called the \"tuning holes\" or \"wind holes\".\nThe picture shown above\n\u2013 \"Parts of the Native American flute\" with\ncan also be seen with labels in\n,\n,\n,\n,\nand\nSpacer Plate.\nAnother way to build Native American flutes uses a \"spacer plate\" to create the flue.\nThe spacer plate sits between the nest area on the body of the flute and the block.\nThe spacer player is usually held in place by the same strap that holds the block onto the instrument.\nThe splitting edge can also be part of the spacer plate.\nThe spacer plate is often made of metal, but spacer plates can be made of wood, bark, and ceramic.\nDimensions.\nMany old Native American flutes were made using measurements of the body.\nThe length of the flute was the distance from inside of the elbow to tip of the index finger.\nThe length of the slow air chamber was the width of the fist.\nThe distance between the sound hole and first finger hole was the width of the fist.\nThe distance between finger holes would be the width of a thumb.\nThe distance from the last finger hole to the end of the flute was the width of the fist.\nCurrently, makers of Native American flutes use many methods to design the dimensions of their flutes.\nThis is very important for the location of the finger holes, since they control the pitch of the different notes of the instrument.\nFlute makers may use calculators to design their instruments,\nor use dimensions provided by other flute makers.\nMaterials.\nMany Native American flutes are made from river cane, bamboo, wood,\nor even plastic. Some makers of Native American flutes use ceramic or glass.\nMusic.\nMany Native American flutes have a musical scale called the pentatonic scale\nin a minor key.\nThis musical scale is used in most Native American flute music.\nHowever, some makers of Native American flute now use different musical scales.\nAlso, many makers of Native American flutes tune flutes carefully so that they\nsound good when played with other instruments such as guitars and pianos.\nNative American flutes may be large or small and have a wide range from very low notes to very high notes.\nFrom the largest flutes (lowest pitch) to the smallest flutes (highest pitch),\nthey span a range of about three and a half octaves,\nfrom C2 to A5.\nEarly recordings of Native American flutes are available from several sources.\nFingering.\nMost Native American flutes have either five finger holes or six finger holes.\nHowever, a flute may have no finger holes or as many as seven finger holes, including a hole for the thumb.\nDifferent makers employ different musical scales and fingerings for their flutes.\nWritten Music.\nWritten music for the Native American flutes is often in the key of F-sharp minor, although some music is scored in other keys.\nHowever, music written for the Native American flute uses a key signature of four sharps.\nThis is known as \"Nakai tablature\".\nMany pieces of written music adds finger diagrams below the notes to show which finger holes to cover for that note.\nThe use of a standard key signature for written music that can be used across Native American flutes in a variety of keys classifies the instrument as a transposing instrument.\nRevival.\nThere were few Native American flute players before 1960.\nHowever, use of the Native American flute increased in the late 1960s.\nMany people began playing Native American flutes, such as Doc Tate Nevaquaya,\nJohn Rainer, Jr.,\nSky Walkinstik Man Alone, and\nCarl Running Deer.\nThe music of R. Carlos Nakai became popular in the 1980s.\nThe album \"Canyon Trilogy\" was issued in 1989.\nIn 1998 it was the first Native American music album certified as a Gold Record\nby the Recording Industry Association of America.\nCanyon Trilogy was certified as a Platinum Record\non July 8, 2014.\nMary Youngblood won two Grammy Awards in the \"Native American Music\" category for her Native American flute music\nin 2002 and 2006.\nToday, Native American flutes are being played and recognized by many different peoples and cultures around the world.\nCommunity Music.\nGroups of players of the Native American flute meet every month or two.\nThese groups are known as \"flute circles\".\nThese organizations help flute circles within their country:"}

In short, the Undue Burden standard says the legislature cannot make a particular law that is too burdensome or restrictive of one's fundamental rights.\nOne use of the standard was in \"Morgan v. Commonwealth of Virginia,\" 328 U.S. 373 (1946). In a 7-to-1 ruling, Associate Justice Stanley Forman Reed fashioned an \"undue burden\" test to decide the constitutionality of a Virginia law requiring separate but equal racial segregation in public transportation. \"There is a recognized abstract principle, however, that may be taken as a postulate for testing whether particular state legislation in the absence of action by Congress is beyond state power. This is that the state legislation is invalid if it unduly burdens that commerce in matters where uniformity is necessary\u2014necessary in the constitutional sense of useful in accomplishing a permitted purpose.\"\nMore recently, the standard has been used in cases involving state restrictions on a woman's access to abortion. The standard was applied by Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor in her dissent in \"City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health,\" 462 US 416 (1983). O'Connor used the test as an alternative to the strict scrutiny test applied in \"Roe v. Wade,\" 410 U.S. 113 (1973)."}

He has been using a traditional farming technique called Za\u00ef to help soil damaged by drought. He is notable for spreading an improved soil and water conservation practice in Burkina Faso.\nEarly Life.\nHe went to a religious school where the students often didn't have enough to eat. Since he was the smallest and youngest, he was the one who had to go without.\nBackground.\nThe northern parts of Burkina Faso are very dry and often have droughts. The most recent big drought in happened in the 1970s, resulting in a famine (lack of food) which killed a lot of people.\nThe drought caused a lot of desertification. There were also other problems like overgrazing, bad land management, and overpopulation. These problems meant that a lot of land could not be used to grow food. \nTogether with Mathieu Ou\u00e9draogo, another local farmer, Yacouba Sawadogo tried different ways of fixing bad soil in about 1980. He uses simple traditional things: cordons pierreux (lines of stones) and za\u00ef holes. Both Sawadogo and Ou\u00e9draogo have tried to get other people to do the same things.\nCordons pierreux (stone lines).\nCordons pierreux are thin lines of fist-sized stones laid across fields. They catch water. When rain falls, it pushes silt (special dirt) across top of the field. The rocks slow down the water so it soaks into the ground more. The silt also makes a good place for seeds of local plants to grow. The plants slow the water even more, and their roots break up the soil, so it's easier for more water to soak in.\nZa\u00ef holes.\nZa\u00ef holes are holes dug in the soil. They also catch water, but in a different way. They used to only be used a little bit to make land better for growing plants. Yacouba Sawadogo had the idea to fill the holes with manure and other things to make food for the plants. The manure attracts termites, whose tunnels help break up the soil even more. He also made the holes slightly bigger than the traditional ones. Za\u00ef holes have been used to help cultivate trees, and crops like sorghum and millet.\nEducation.\nYacouba Sawadogo holds \"Market Days\" to get other people to do these things, especially za\u00ef holes. People come to share seeds and learn from each another.\nProblems with Burkina Faso Government.\nYacouba Sawadogo's work with za\u00ef holes helped him make a forest of about fifty acres (20 hectares). The nearby city of Ouahigouya took the land to make money. Sawadogo and his family members each get one tenth of out of the plot, and don't get any other payment.\nSawadogo is trying to get $20,000 (American dollars) to buy the land."}

This is called a verdict. The judge usually follows the jury's verdict in his ruling. It is distinguished from a bench trial, in which a judge or panel of judges make all decisions.\nHistory.\nWilliam the Conqueror brought to England a system of having witnesses who had any knowledge of a crime, tell the court what they knew. They did this after first swearing an oath. The word juror in English comes from the French \"jurer\" (to swear). In the 12th century juries were used by the king to discover and present facts. Usually this was in answer to questions posed by the king or his ministers who made the final decision in the case. Eventually this led to a system where the jury made a verdict based on evidence. In the late colonial period, juries became a tool used to express American discontent with British rule. A series of Navigation Acts prohibited the American colonies from trading directly with the Netherlands, Spain, France, and their colonies. As more and more trade restriction were imposed, the American colonists turned to smuggling. When smugglers were caught, they were brought before juries made up of other colonists. These sympathetic juries often acquitted their fellow colonists. The king, angered at these lawbreakers going free, created new courts that did not allow juries. This was a breach of common law practice and infringed on their rights as British citizens. After the Revolutionary war, the Seventh Amendment's right to a jury trial was written to limit the powers of the executive and the Judicial branches of the new federal government.\nCriminal trials.\nJury trials are changing worldwide. In 2008 Russia abolished jury trials in cases of treason and terrorism. Britain, where juries got their start, is using them less in cases of serious fraud and may ban them from some inquests. In many asian countries, their legal systems are moving towards using the jury trial more. In the United States jury trials are on the decline. In federal courts \nCivil trials.\nThe right to a jury trial in civil cases is found in the United States but in very few other places. England, Canada, Australia and New Zealand have all but done away with civil jury trials in favor of bench trials. Fewer than 1 percent of civil trials in the US are jury trials. The Seventh Amendment prevents judges from overturning a jury verdict in federal cases where the finding of fact is reasonably supported by the evidence. In addition, the Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to a speedy trial by an impartial jury in criminal trials."}

Other cats have been given this title as a nickname, usually by the British press. There has been a Downing Street cat mouser and pet since the reign of Henry VIII.\nOfficial records about these working cats only date back to 3 June 1929. These come from the Treasury and state the cost for taking care of the cat. Now, the mouser costs 100 GBP (about $140) a year for keep.\nThe cats do not always belong to the Prime Minister in residence. Only rarely do they serve for exactly the same time as a Prime Minister.The cat with the longest known time at Downing Street is Wilberforce. He served for eighteen years under Edward Heath, Harold Wilson, Jim Callaghan, and Margaret Thatcher.\nIncumbent.\nThe incumbent is Larry, since 15 February 2011. The last cat Sybil, was the first mouser after a ten-year gap. She began in September 2007 and left in January 2009. Sybil was owned by the Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling, who lived in 10 Downing Street. The Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, lived in the larger 11 Downing Street. It was reported that Sybil did not like living in London. She went back to Scotland to live with a friend of the Darlings until she died.\nIn January 2011, rats were seen in Downing Street, \"scurrying across the steps of Number 10 Downing Street for the second time during a TV news report,\", as reported by Independent Television News . The Prime Minister's office first said there were \"no plans\" for a cat to be brought in. On 14 February 2011, it was reported that a cat named \"Larry\" had been brought in to get rid of the rodents. The \"London Evening Standard\" reported that the brown and white tabby cat had been chosen by David Cameron and his family, from those at Battersea Dogs &amp; Cats Home.\nIn September 2012, it was reported that Prime Minister David Cameron had dismissed Larry from the post of Chief Mouser. He put in place Chancellor George Osborne's tabby cat, Freya, as the new Chief Mouser to patrol Numbers 10, 11, and 12. Some sources said the two cats would be \"job sharing\" to avoid any hurt feelings. In November 2014 Freya was exiled from Downing Street, again leaving Larry as the Chief Mouser.\nWhen Theresa May became new Prime Minister in July 2016, Cabinet Office staff said that Larry would still live at Downing Street and would be Chief Mouser under the new Prime Minister. However, \"The Daily Telegraph\" says maybe Cameron does not really like Larry. During David Cameron's final Prime Minister's Questions on 13 July 2016, the Prime Minister said to the House that Larry's role as Chief Mouser was secure even after the change of premier. Cameron also showed photos that prove he loves Larry. He spoke of his \"sadness\" that he cannot take Larry with him.\nThe British government voluntarily employees and feeds 100,000 cats to keep down mice on government property. By being chosen Chief Mouser, of course, Larry (and Freya) became quite pampered cats, living in royal luxury.\nLarry's sixth year in Downing Street.\nLarry's birthday was celebrated on 15 February 2016. A month later Larry's importance to the UK was compared favourably to a team of dolphins being trained by the Russian Navy. In April Larry's ability to be a good mouser was again questioned. So a new neighbour, Palmerston the cat, moved into the Foreign Office. Just a week later Palmerston made his first kill, a mouse.\nDuring President Obama's April visit to the UK, Larry got much coverage in American social media and news reports.\nIn June 2016 it was reported that Larry is undecided about the Brexit decision. Whether he gets to keep living at 10 Downing Street, he will still get his daily dinner."}

The other branch of common law is criminal law. Civil law is concerned with the duties individuals owe to other people or to their government. This excludes the duty not to commit crimes. The American form of civil justice is considerably different from European systems. Two features stand out, class actions and the awarding of punitive damages in tort cases. Many people in other countries are amazed at the number of civil cases in the United States. Americans sue in a wide variety of cases for compensation and medical expenses that are covered in other countries by national health insurance and government compensation programs.\nCivil cases.\nCivil law is concerned with cases such as divorce, child custody and support and related lawsuits. Contract cases, tort cases (when someone is hurt and seeks compensation) and crimes which are tried in a criminal court and then tried in a civil case. Examples would be cases resulting from drunk driving or hit and run.\nCivil cases use a lower preponderance of the evidence standard of proof whereas criminal cases use the higher standard of beyond a reasonable doubt. An example of the differences and that the same crime can result in both criminal and civil trials is the O. J. Simpson trials. In his criminal trial a jury decided the evidence did not meet the higher standard so he was acquitted of murder charges. But in the civil wrongful death trial he was found guilty.\nCivil jury trials.\nThe right to a jury trial in civil cases is found in the United States but in very few other places. England, Canada, Australia and New Zealand have all but done away with civil jury trials in favor of bench trials. Fewer than 1 percent of civil trials in the US are jury trials. Where juries are used, the presence of a jury has changed the form of civil proceedings. A jury has to be impaneled, they must hear witnesses and go over evidence before reaching a verdict. The verdict, in turn, must follow the instructions given by a judge.\nCivil bench trials.\nBench trials in civil cases are usually conducted differently than jury trials. Judges usually prefer settlements to trials and prefer bench trials because they save time. A judge can streamline a case by asking for what he wants to see and hear, not what is presented for the benefit of a jury.\nBench trials have several advantages. They are usually much less formal than a jury trial. Attorneys for both sides can usually agree on the facts of a case before the trial starts. This can save a great deal of time otherwise spent on hearing witnesses and reviewing evidence. This can save on the costs of a trial. In a jury trial, the judge is required to give instructions to the jury before they deliberate. If a judge makes an error in his instructions, this is called a reversible error and can be used as a basis for an appeal. In a bench trial, the judge gives no instructions since there is no jury. This means the judge cannot be reversed due to an error in the instructions."}

The policeman on security duty at the front door of Number 10 had to ring the bell for Wilberforce whenever he wanted to come in.\nAccording to Bernard Ingham, the former press secretary to Margaret Thatcher, Wilberforce was a normal cat for whom Thatcher once bought \"a tin of sardines in a Moscow supermarket\". Ingham was allergic to cats and did his best to avoid Wilberforce. \"Bloody Wilberforce used to sit under my desk and I would have a fit of sneezing. I hate cats\", he said.\nOn the BBC coverage of the 1983 UK general election, presenter Esther Rantzen was allowed to hold Wilberforce and introduce him to viewers.\nWilberforce retired in 1986, after 13 years of loyal service.

In organizations like the United Nations, each country sends delegates to represent them.\nPolitical delegates.\nBefore a general election in the US, the process to select candidates begins with delegates. At the state level each of the major political parties selects delegates to attend a national convention. The two ways delegates are selected are the caucus and the Primary election. Each state may have different ways to select delegates as do political parties. The Republican Party lets each state decide how to select delegates. The Democratic Party uses a proportional method for awarding delegates. The percentage of delegates each candidate is awarded depends on the caucus or how many are elected for each candidate. Candidate \"X\" may have 40 percent, candidate \"Y\" may have 20 percent while candidate \"Z\" may have 50 percent. Any remaining percent may be undecided votes or for other candidates. \nA candidate becomes his or her party's presidential nominee after the delegates sent to the convention give that person a majority of the votes. Because there are often multiple rounds of votes taken to select a presidential candidate, delegates sometimes change their votes. But in recent elections that has become unnecessary. Since 1976, it was fairly clear who was the front-runner even before the first vote was taken."}

There are three parts that each come from different places at the top of the arm and join together at the elbow. It straightens the arm. The name is Latin for \"three-headed muscle in the arm\".\nStructure.\nThe triceps brachii has three heads. They are: the long head, medial (inside) head, and the lateral (outside) head.The long head comes from the shoulderblade. It goes down the arm between teres minor muscle and teres major muscle.\nThe medial head and lateral heads comes from the humerus (upper arm bone).\nThe medial head is mostly made of small, slow muscle fibers and motor units. The lateral head is mostly made of large, fast fibers and motor units. The long head is made of a mixture of fiber types and motor units. Some scientists think that each of the three parts can be thought of as separate muscles.\nThe fibers join to a single tendon to attach to the ulna bone. Some research found that there might be more than one tendon. \nNerve supply.\nScientists used to think that all three heads of the triceps brachii got nerve signals from the radial nerve. However, a study found that, in 20 cadaveric (dead) bodies and 15 live people, the long head actually got nerve signals from part of the axillary nerve in every case.\nFunction.\nThe triceps straightens the elbow pulls against the biceps and brachialis muscles. It can also hold the elbow in place when the forearm and hand are used for small movements, like writing.The long head might be used when the same force is needed for a long time, or to help control shoulder and elbow movement. The lateral head is used when a lot of force is needed at once, while the medial part is used for more careful movement.\nThe long head also moves shoulder joint, bringing the arm backwards or inwards.\nTraining.\nThe triceps can be trained by itself or together with other muscles by straightening the elbow or keeping it straight while holding something.\nName.\nThe name triceps brachii is Latin for three-headed. It is called this because there are three parts of the muscle. The triceps brachii is commonly just called the triceps.\nThe plural of \"triceps\" used to be \"tricipites\", but now people usually say \"triceps\" to mean both singular and plural.\nAnimals.\nIn horses, the long head is about 84% of the weight of the triceps, the lateral head is about 15%, and the medial head is about 3%.\nMany mammals, like dogs, cows, and pigs, have a fourth triceps head, called the accessory head.

This plan for farming may grow more rice in the same field. It uses less water, takes more work, and uses younger seedlings spaced apart. SRI calls for hand weeding with special tools. It was started in 1983 by the French Jesuit Father Henri de Laulani\u00e9 in Madagascar. Full testing and spread of the system throughout the rice growing parts of the world did not happen until some years later with the help of schools like Cornell University.\nHistory and main ideas of SRI.\nWriting the plan now called SRI started in the 1960s when Fr. de Laulanie kept notes on growing rice. The SRI plan includes using less water and hand planting very young seedlings in a square. The SRI plan continues to change. Sometimes people try to use only rain for water, and sometimes people try to plant seeds instead of young plants. The main parts of SRI plan written by Cornell University, New York are:\nSpread of SRI.\nThanks to Norman Uphoff, the SRI plan has spread from Madagascar to many places around the world. Norman Uphoff was director of the Cornell International Institute for Food, Agriculture and Development at Cornell University, Ithaca, New York from 1990 to 2005. In 1993, Uphoff met officers from Association Tefy Saina, the non-governmental organisation set up in Madagascar in 1990 by de Laulanie to try SRI. After trying the SRI plan for three years, Malagasy farms that made about 2 tons/hectare improved to about 8 tons/hectare. Uphoff believed the SRI plan works, and in 1997 started to tell groups in Asia about SRI. Uphoff estimates that by 2013 the number of small farms using SRI had grown to between 4 and 5 million.\nDoes SRI Work?\nBelievers and unbelievers of SRI talk about the SRI claims, and many questions about it remain unresolved. Wageningen University has also published an article discussing the problems of measuring SRI. This paper ended by saying: \"Although the technical aspects of SRI have been contested, it clearly exists as a real social phenomenon\".\nThe question now seems to be: is SRI better at making more rice and other benefits to rice farmers, such as healthier soils, when compared with older, trusted ways for growing rice?[source?]\nProponents and critics of SRI debate the claimed benefits and many questions about it remain unresolved. Wageningen University has also published an article discussing the challenges of evaluating SRI in which one concluding sentence read: \"Although the technical aspects of SRI have been contested, it clearly exists as a real social phenomenon\".\nThe question at hand seems to be: is SRI better at delivering increased yield and other benefits to rice farmers, such as healthier soils, when compared with established recommended best management practices for rice production?\nCases of success.\nBelievers of SRI claim it grows more rice, saves water, reduces costs, and raises income and that benefits have been achieved in 40 countries. Uphoff published an article in the International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability that states that SRI \"can raise irrigated rice yields to about double the present world average without relying on external inputs, also offering environmental and equity benefits\".\nA special issue on SRI in the trade journal Paddy and Water Environment (not related to schools) collected recent findings in support of SRI.\nIn 2011 Five farmers beat the old yield record, the best was a young farmer named Sumant Kumar setting a new world record in rice yield of 22.4 tons per hectare using SRI, beating the existing world record held by the Chinese scientist Yuan Longping by 3 tons. In 2014 S Sethumadhavan from Alanganallur, India grew a record yield of nearly 24 tons of paddy rice per hectare using SRI.\nCriticism.\nHow well SRI works is still debated between believers and unbelievers of the plan. Critics of SRI say that claims of high yield in SRI are due to unscientific reporting. They object that there is a lack of details on the methodology used in trials and a lack of printed reports in the peer-reviewed literature (related to schools and universities). Some unbelievers have suggested that SRI success is unique to soil conditions in Madagascar. While unbelievers still claim this, there are over 700 articles and printed reports about SRI that are published in international scientific journals as of January 2016.\nSRI picture gallery.\nBelow is a picture gallery of SRI farming in Chhattisgarh, India:"}

In certain cases, people knowing an addict can increase the addiction through their actions. As an example, take a person who is an alcoholic. Because of alcoholism, that person is not as productive as his colleagues at work. Colleagues at work may work more and compensate for the work the alcoholic has not done. A similar case can be made for family members who help finance a dependency.\nSomeone suffering from codependency will not be able to self-soothe and will rely on their partner in order to meet their own emotional needs. Codependence can cause an irrational fear of rejection and being alone. Codependence can be one-sided, or both partners may suffer from it.\nIn a codependent relationship, individuals put the other person\u2019s needs before their own, often sacrificing their own integrity and sense of self in the process. Codependency can cause a person to have an overinflated belief that they alone are responsible for affecting the beliefs, thoughts, emotions, and behaviours of those around them.\nCauses of Codependency.\nWhile childhood abuse, traumatic experiences, and exposure to narcissistic behaviors of parents and/or partners seem to play a role, it is difficult to predict codependency on the basis of any of these factors alone.\nSymptoms of Codependency.\nThere are two main forms of codependence: passive and active. Someone who is passively codependent is more likely to avoid conflict and confrontation, going to great lengths to keep things smooth and not rock the boat. Active codependency is often more manipulative, and an individual may try to push their partner into behaving a certain way in order to fill their own emotional needs. \nBoth forms of codependence have many things in common, however. Some common signs of codependency include:"}

It was in northern Germany, near the town of Ravensbr\u00fcck.\nThe \"Schutzstaffel\" (SS), led by Heinrich Himmler, ran Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp.\nIn November 1938, Himmler gave the order to start building the camp at Ravensbr\u00fcck. By 1939, Ravensbr\u00fcck was the biggest women's concentration camp in Nazi Germany.\nOver time, the Nazis made Ravensbr\u00fcck much bigger. By 1944, Ravensbr\u00fcck had become a complex (a group of many concentration camps).\nBetween 1939 and 1945, about 153,000 people were prisoners at Ravensbr\u00fcck.\nGrowth of Ravensbr\u00fcck.\nThe women's camp.\nAfter Heinrich Himmler decided that Ravensbr\u00fcck should be built, the SS brought about 500 male prisoners from Sachsenhausen concentration camp to the area. The SS forced these prisoners to build Ravensbr\u00fcck. SS records say that Ravensbruck was designed to hold 3,000 prisoners.pp.\u00a03, 12, 20, 24\nRavensbr\u00fcck opened in May 1939. The camp's first prisoners were a group of about 900 women sent from Lichtenburg concentration camp. Ravensbr\u00fcck very quickly became full. From 1939 to 1945, the Nazis were constantly making the camp bigger to hold more and more prisoners.\nAfter Nazi Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, the Nazis made Ravensbr\u00fcck much larger. They expected to send many Polish people to concentration camps, and they wanted Ravensbr\u00fcck to be able to fit more prisoners. However, by May 1940 (just eight months after World War II started), Ravensbr\u00fcck was full of prisoners.p.\u00a015\nWhen Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in summer 1941, there were about 5,000 prisoners at Ravensbr\u00fcck.p.\u00a015 By the end of 1942, the camp held 10,000 prisoners (including many Soviet prisoners of war).p.\u00a015\nAt its most crowded, the women's camp held 50,000 prisoners.\nNew camps.\nTo make room for more and more prisoners, the Nazis added new camps to the original women's camp.\nIn April 1941, the Nazis added a concentration camp for men next to the women's camp. The SS forced the male prisoners to build the new camps in the Ravensbr\u00fcck complex, and to work on making the women's camp bigger.\nIn June 1942, a \"juvenile protective custody camp\" called \"Uckermark\" was built next to the men's camp. This was a camp just for teenage girls and young women.\nBy 1944, the SS had forced prisoners to build over 40 smaller camps (called sub-camps). These sub-camps held over 70,000 prisoners, mostly women. The original Ravensbr\u00fcck camp became the office for these sub-camps. However, women prisoners were still kept there, and male prisoners had to keep making the camp bigger to fit more prisoners.\nTypes of prisoners.\nOf the 153,000 people who were prisoners at Ravensbr\u00fcck between 1939 and 1945:\nPeople were sent to Ravensbr\u00fcck for many different reasons. Prisoners at Ravensbr\u00fcck included:\nBy country.\nThe Nazis sent people from over 30 countries to Ravensbr\u00fcck. For example, historians estimate that:\nGuards.\nMale SS members were in charge of Ravensbr\u00fcck. However, the camp had over 150 female SS members who guarded the prisoners.\nRavensbr\u00fcck was also a training camp for SS women. They learned how to be concentration camp guards at Ravensbr\u00fcck. Then they would stay and work there, or go work at another camp. Over 4,000 SS women trained at Ravensbr\u00fcck.\nMany of the female SS guards at Ravensbr\u00fcck, like Irma Grese, treated the prisoners very badly.\nLife at Ravensbr\u00fcck.\nArriving at Ravensbr\u00fcck.\nWhen prisoners first got to Ravensbr\u00fcck, their hair was usually shaved off. The SS took away their personal things, including their clothes. Prisoners had to wear striped uniforms, which included a dress and a head scarf. Later on in the war, when there were not enough uniforms, women were sometimes allowed to wear their own clothes. However, they had to mark a big white \"X\" on the back of their clothes to show that they were prisoners.p.\u00a076\nEvery prisoner was given a serial number. The SS never called them by their names - only by their numbers.\nPrisoners had to sew their serial numbers onto their clothes. They also had to wear colored triangles which showed why they were sent to Ravensbr\u00fcck. In the middle of the triangle, they had to sew a letter saying what country they were from. For example, Polish prisoners had to sew a red triangle with the letter \"P\" (for Poland) onto their clothes. (A red triangle showed that a person was a political enemy of Nazi Germany.)\nLiving conditions.\nWhen Ravensbr\u00fcck first opened, and the camp was not too crowded, living conditions were not too bad. However, during the winter of 1939 to 1940, the camp got more crowded, and the SS reacted by giving the prisoners less food. After 1941, the food got much worse, and prisoners got much less of it.\nThe women's camp at Ravensbr\u00fcck had twelve barracks where the prisoners lived. They slept on wooden bunks which had three rows, one on top of the other. Each barrack had a washroom and three toilets with no doors. There was very little sanitation. After 1943, sanitation in the barracks got much worse. This made it easier for diseases to spread.\nTowards the end of World War II, the camp was so crowded that 1,500 to 2,000 women were packed into barracks meant to hold only 250 people. Many women had to sleep on the floor, without even a blanket. In 1945, the barracks were so crowded and sanitation was so bad that an epidemic of typhus spread through the camp. The disease killed many prisoners.\nSlave labor.\nEvery morning, the prisoners had to get up at 4:00 in the morning for roll call. This meant they had to stand in line while the SS counted them.\nAfter roll call, prisoners went to work. Every prisoner at Ravensbr\u00fcck was forced to work. If a person could not work, they would be killed.\nMany prisoners worked at a Siemens Electric Company factory next to the women's camp. The prisoners worked as slaves, making parts for Nazi V-1 and V-2 rockets (flying bombs). Other prisoners worked at important German companies like Daimler-Benz (now Mercedes-Benz) and AEG (a German electrical company).\nSome prisoners in the women's camp did other jobs, like:\nSome women had to work outside. They built roads and buildings. Sometimes these women were used like animals. For example, sometimes twelve to fourteen women would have to pull a huge roller to pave the streets.\nWomen who were too sick or injured to do other jobs - usually because of medical experiments - knitted things like socks for the German Army, or cleaned the barracks and latrines.\nPrisoners usually worked for twelve hours a day. Some worked from 7:00 in the morning to 7:00 at night. Others worked from 7:00 at night to 7:00 in the morning.\nPrisoners did not have to work on Sundays.\nMedical experiments.\nStarting in 1942, Nazi doctors did medical experiments on 86 women prisoners. The doctors did two types of experiments.\nIn the first type, the doctors cut the women's legs, muscles, and nerves, or broke their leg bones. Then they infected these wounds with bacteria. Sometimes they rubbed wood or glass into the wounds. Then they gave the women sulfanilamide antibiotics to see if they would work.\nIn the second type of experiment, the doctors studied whether bones could be taken from one person and put into another person. They amputated some women's arms or legs to do these experiments.\nIn January 1945, Nazi doctors sterilized about 120 to 140 Roma women and children. The doctors were trying to find a quick, easy way to sterilize people.\nSome women died from these experiments. The SS killed some other women who had wounds that did not heal.\nSexual abuse.\nSome of the women and young children at Ravensbr\u00fcck were raped or sexually abused.\nStarting in 1942, the SS created brothels in eight other concentration camps, like Buchenwald and Dachau. Women from Ravensbr\u00fcck were forced to work as prostitutes in these brothels.\nDeath at Ravensbr\u00fcck.\nNobody agrees on how many people died or were murdered at Ravensbr\u00fcck. Estimates range from 52,200, to 90,000,p.\u00a08 to 117,000.\nPrisoners at Ravensbr\u00fcck died for many reasons. These included:\nMany prisoners were also murdered by the SS.\nMurder.\nUnlike many other concentration camps, Ravensbr\u00fcck did not have its own gas chamber until early 1945. The SS used other ways of killing prisoners.\nRegularly, the SS would perform \"selections.\" They would pick out prisoners who looked too sick or weak to work. Then they would kill these prisoners.\nAt first, the SS killed prisoners by shooting them or giving them lethal injections in the camp's \"hospital.\" Then, starting in 1942, they began sending prisoners to other places that did have gas chambers, like Hartheim Euthanasia Centre, so they could be killed there. Between 1942 and 1944, the SS sent about 60 groups of prisoners to Hartheim to be gassed to death. Each group had 60 to 1,000 prisoners in it.\nThe SS also sent prisoners to Auschwitz concentration camp to be killed in its gas chambers.\nIn early 1945, the SS made prisoners build a gas chamber at Ravensbr\u00fcck. By this time, the Nazis knew that the Soviet Red Army was getting close. They wanted to kill as many prisoners as possible before the Red Army arrived. In its last few months, Ravensbr\u00fcck became an extermination camp (a death camp). The SS started sending children and prisoners from Ravensbr\u00fcck's sub-camps to the main camp, so they could be gassed to death. In just a few months, the SS killed 5,000 to 6,000 prisoners in the gas chamber.\nDeath march and freedom.\nIn March 1945, the Red Army was very close to Ravensbr\u00fcck. The SS did not want to leave any witnesses to tell the Soviets what had happened at Ravensbr\u00fcck. In March, they sent about 8,000 prisoners to other concentration camps.\nOn April 27, the SS forced about 20,000 female prisoners and about 3,000 male prisoners to march towards the middle of Germany. This was a death march. The SS guards had been ordered to kill anyone who could not keep up. However, Soviet soldiers found the route of the march and freed the prisoners who had survived the death march.\nOn April 29, the SS guards that were still at Ravensbr\u00fcck ran away from the camp. The next day, the Red Army arrived at Ravensbr\u00fcck and freed the camp. They found only about 3,000 very sick prisoners. These were the prisoners that the SS had left behind because they were too sick to march."}
