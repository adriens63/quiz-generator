It is, in a sense, the reverse of the Chothe Thangwai Pakhangba.\nStory.\nIt is a story of love fulfilled after a near tragic event and is, perhaps, unique of its kind. Nongban Pombi Luwaoba, the leading character of the same name was a Prince of the Luwang dynasty born of King Nungpan Pamingnapa and Queen Santhong Huimuleima. He soon grew into manhood and felt lovesick. He set out alone to cover the wide world in search of a love to quench the thirst of his heart and was welcomed by the King Koubru when he approached him for a rest. There he met the princess, Koubru Namoinu (Lainaotabi) and was instantly smitten with her beauty and had his heart lost to her. The princess, formerly the youngest wife of Thongalel, the God of death, who while accompanying her younger brother in law on a sojourn to earth got separated from him and was later adopted by the king as his daughter. Returning home hastily, the prince requested his parents to get the princess engaged to him. And this was carried out without delay with the offer of choice and the delicious fruit in prickles to the king and the queen. The couple accepted the proposal with a good grace and regarded it as an occasion ordained by Providence. The marriage having been performed with due solemnity, the young couple began to lead a happy and contented life. But this was desined not to last long, for the God did not take kindly to his own wife spending her days as an ordinary mortal in the company of another man. So, her fatal thread was cut short and her soul recalled. However, the distraught Prince did not not take his tragic fate lying down and taking the help of Nongta Chinkhanyang, a pheasant, sent a request to the Lord of the netherworld to give back the soul of his wife or take the challenge of a single combat. Thus, he kept guarding the mortal remains of Koubru Namoinu without the obsequies being performed. Thongalel first sent his younger brother armed with deadly weapons for the fight in which the prince settled his opponent's hash and kept him bound under the heavy weight of a slab. The Lord's second brother too met the same humiliation and at last, Thongalel himself appeared in all splendor in the field of honour. But the prince was prudent enough to realise that he was no match for powerful God, he fell prostrate before him and begged mercy and kindness to restore Koubru Namoinu to him so that the Luwang dynasty might have further progeny. Thongalel, being visibly moved, readily granted the prayer and left for the dark abode. Thus, the couple were united to live for another hundred years with conjugal bliss and Hongnem Luwang Punshiba, a son was born to them."}

Characteristics of these products are the two techniques, which are called \"Nimai hiroge\" (= double layering) and \"Mawashi hagane tsuke\" (= shaping the knife). Thanks to these characteristic techniques, they were chosen as the earliest traditional craft for forged knives in 1979. \nHistory.\nThe origin of Echizen forged knives goes back to the early Nanboku-cho period (in the early 14th century). In 1337, Kuniyasu Chiyotsuru, a sword maker from Kyoto Prefecture in Japan, moved to \"Echizen no kuni\" (=present Echizen city), and\u00a0 made sickles (=one kind of farming tools) for citizens who live there. While he stayed there, he thought how to make the products for many citizens, and many of them began to make the products referring to his techniques. Since then, the Echizen city became a big producing area which was famous for the farmer tools . During the Edo period (from the 17th to the 19th century), merchants selling sickles, which are farming tools,\u00a0 walked from \"Echizen no kun\"i to many places around Japan such as Osaka prefecture or Tokyo Prefecture to sell these tools made in Echizen city. As these products were sold in markets, their high quality such as lightness or sharpness was evaluated, so forged knives made in Echizen city became popular around Japan. Now, Echizen forged knives produce many other products such as hatchets that are used for cutting trees in addition to knives.\nTwo main processes.\nThe two main important processes:\u00a0 \"nimai hiroge\" and \"mawashi hagane tsuke\".\n...The blade is evenly thinned by stretching the two layered plates \nthrough beating both sides with a high-speed machine hammer.\n...The tip of the blade is sharpened carefully to be close to the shape of diamond.\nReferences.\nKOGEI JAPAN https://kogeijapan.com/locale/ja_JP/echizenuchihamono/\nEchizen Forged Knives Cooperative Association HP https://www.echizenuchihamono.com/shop.php\nTakefu Knife village Cooperative Association HP https://tkvstore.net/"}

The museum was finished on July 19, 1992. It is considered to be the tallest castle in Japan, at 57.8 meters, but it is not a castle because it does not have a \"tenshu\" or \"tenshukaku\"\u2013a \u201ckeep tower\u201d (tower to defend from enemies). It was built to look like the Himeji castle. The museum also stands out because it has dragons cut into its foundation stone, which is unusual for a Japanese castle. \nHistory behind the construction.\nDuring the Edo period in Japan, the territory of modern Katsuyama City belonged to the Echizen-Katsuyama Domain (region). During that time, the city was planning to build a \"tenshu\". However, for different reasons, such as the laws that were in place at that time, the city was never able to finish it. Kiyoshi Tada, who was born in Katsuyama and who was the founder of S\u014dg\u014dtakushi, a taxi company that is nowadays divided into many different taxi companies, decided to build a castle, and put into life the long wish of people for a \"tenshu\". Instead of a usual castle he built a museum that looks like a castle, where different items from his own collection are displayed nowadays, including various samurai armor, swords, and traditional folding screens. The museum was built close to another gift to Katsuyama from Kiyoshi Tada--\"Echizen Daibutsu\", a complex of buildings built in a traditional Japanese style with a huge Buddha statue in it. The cost of construction was 10 billion yen.\nModern times.\nSince the opening, the museum has been managed by the Tada Kiyoshi Cultural Educational Commemoration Foundation (\"\u591a\u7530\u6e05\u6587\u5316\u6559\u80b2\u8a18\u5ff5\u8ca1\u56e3\", \"Tada Kiyoshi Bunka Ky\u014diku Kinen Zaidan\"). In 2014, the Katsuyama Castle Museum started working together with the Katsuyama City government.\nIn addition to Kiyoshi Tada\u2019s own collection, the museum also displays a collection of more than 800 articles of embroidery of the Qing dynasty in China. There is also a collection of works by famous calligrapher Goseki Nishiwaki shown in the museum.\nMany events are held on the museum territory throughout the year, including tea ceremonies, haiku competitions, various concerts, and collaborations with the government and other museums. (Please check the information before visiting there as the event may be canceled or changed due to the influence of the coronavirus.\nIn 2019 alone 12,5000 people visited either the museum and/or the \"Echizen Daibutsu\".\nYou can overlook the city of Katsuyama from the observation room on the top floor. \nWe can get to the museum for about 15 minutes from Katsuyama station by bus. This museum closed on Wednesday and open from 9:30 to 16:30 except Wednesday."}

The Sabae area used to be the gate town of J\u014dsh\u014d Temple. In the Edo period, the West-Sabae Jin'ya (administrative headquarter for a small province) was under the direct control of the Shogunate. At that time, Sabae was the gate town until 1871. In meantime Sabae Jin'ya became Sabae Han (historical term for the estate of a daimyo in the Edo period) (1720-1871)\nManabe Akikatsu (1804-1884) is known as the most famous Sabae's feudal lord, who in 1856 opened Ky\u014dy\u014dkei - a place where the lords can relax. Ky\u014dy\u014dkei was the foundation of the current Nishiyama Park.\nWhen Sabae became Han there was a plan to build a castle. However, the Sabae Castle was never built. There were many problems such as financial difficulties and the occurrence of famine. Instead, Manabe Akikatsu took the money that was meant for the castle and gave it to the villages that were suffering from famine.\nThe Birth of Sabae City.\nIn 1889, the municipal system was introduced. 1 city - Fukui, 9 towns and 168 villages were established.\nSabae was one of 9 towns. It had administrated 10 villages. These villages are: Funatsu Village, Shin-Yokoe Village, Shinmei Village, Tachimachi Village, Yoshikawa Village, Yutaka Village, Nakagawa Village, Katakami Village, Kitanakayama Village, Kawada Village.\nIn 1948 Funatsu Village and Shin-Yokoe Village became a part of Sabae Town. Since then Sabae Town was gradually growing until it became Sabae City.\nCulture.\nFormer Uryu Residence.\nIt is the oldest residence in Fukui Prefecture. Originally located on the east side of the former Hokuriku Expressway, but it was relocated to northeastern corner of the Shinmeisha (Shint\u014d Shrine) in 1975.\nJ\u014dsh\u014d Temple.\nBuddthist temple which building stared in 1208. Shisoku Gate of this temple is a cultural property.\nNishiyama Park.\nNishiyama Park is considered to be one of 100 historical parks in Japan. There is also a zoo, which is famous for having Red Pandas, an adventure forest and Japanese garden. \nEconomy.\nSabae is one of the largest manufacturer of eyeglass frames in Japan. \nEyeglasses.\nSabae eyewear is produced in Sabae City, one of the world's three largest eyewear production areas. Fukui Prefecture, particularly Fukui City and Sabae City, manufactures high quality frames that account for 95% of all Japanese eyewear frames sold both nationally and internationally. About 4000 people are involved in the local industry, and it takes about half a year to a year to manufacture one pair of eyewear. Sabae eyewear is manufactured with the technology of titanium. \nThe technology is also used in producing medical and electronic equipment. There are more than 5,000 stores in Japan that sell Sabae eyeglasses, and the average price is 35,000 yen excluding lenses now.\nHistory.\nGozaemon Masunaga, the \"ancestor of domestic eyeglasses,\" started\u00a0 manufacturing eyewear frames in Fukui around 1905. At that time, most people in Sabae were working in the farming industry. Farming was challenging in winter, since the Fukui region experiences a lot of snow. \u00a0Masunaga started this industry because the eyeglass industry does not depend on the season. He invited craftsmen from Osaka to try to spread the industry\u00a0as a side business of a farmer in Fukui. At that time, education and the development of printing technology were spreading so people started to read prints such as newspapers. The demand for eyewear has expanded. In 1935, the eyewear industry spread to Sabae and Fukui. The industry succeeded in manufacturing the titanium-based eyewear frames in 1981 for the first time in the world. After that, a large military factory was converted to an eyewear factory after the end of World War II made Sabae\u2019s eyeglasses industry famous. \nProcess.\nMore than 200 steps are required to complete one eyeglasses frame. However these processes can be divided into 9 processes.\u3000"}

It began in the 1970s. Through the 1990s to the 2000s, live bands performed OPM pop. \nGroups such as Neocolours, Side A, Introvoys, the Teeth, Yano, True Faith, Passage and Freestyle popularized OPM pop. These songs are sentimental.\nFrom 2010 to 2020, Philippine pop music changed. The quality became better, there was more variety, and people were willing to pay more money to make and listen to it. This was because the economy of the Philippines was improving and Filipinos were becoming more interested in their own culture. This was partially because K-pop and J-pop, which are music styles from Korea and Japan, which have Asian style ballads, idol groups, EDM music, and less reliance on Western genres. Famous P-pop music artists include Sarah Geronimo, SB19, XLR8, KZ Tandingan, Erik Santos, Yeng Constantino, MNL48, Regine Velasquez, BINI, BGYO, and P-Pop Generation.\nIndustry.\nIn the Philippines, Culture, Music and etc are also included in P-pop Music scene, K-pop is the one of the biggest and most hot genre right now.

The songs were often sung in Tagalog. It was a mix of rock, folk and ballads. It did not focus on social class. As early as 1973, the Juan De la Cruz Band was performing \"Ang Himig Natin\" (\"Our Music\"), which many people thought was the first example of Pinoy rock. \"Pinoy\" gained popular currency in the late 1970s in the Philippines when Filipinos became more patriotic. Filipino folk singer Heber Bartolome's \"Tayo'y mga Pinoy\" (\"We are Pinoys\") became popular. Filipino rapper Francis Magalona's \"Mga Kababayan Ko\" (\"My Countrymen\") in the 1990s and Filipino rock band Bamboo's \"Noypi\" (\"Pinoy\" in reversed syllables) in the 2000s.\nToday, the word \"Pinoy\" is used as an adjective for things that have to do with the Philippines or Filipinos. Pinoy rock was soon followed by Pinoy folk and Pinoy jazz. Many songwriters made songs critical of Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos and his use of martial law and the Batasang Bayan, other songs were subversive and others were about national pride.\nThe Marcos administration ordered radio stations to play a certain number of Pinoy songs each hour. Both Marcos and his enemies used Pinoy music.\nHistory.\nBeginnings (1960s\u20131970s).\nP-pop includes Filipino pop songs since the 1960s, especially ballads. Many are by major commercial artists like Pilita Corrales, Nora Aunor, Basil Valdez, Freddie Aguilar and Rey Valera.\nSinger-songwriters Ryan Cayabyab and Jos\u00e9 Mari Chan became famous in the 1970s by writing original English love songs alongside modern Tagalog songs. Pop groups in the same decade include Manila sound groups APO Hiking Society and Hotdog.\nGolden age of Filipino music.\nIn the 1980s, disco group VST &amp; Co. and pop icon Gary V. gave rise to dance-pop in the mainstream.\nProminence of rock-acoustic bands, belters, and balladeers (mid-1990s to present).\nThe early to mid-1990s saw the emergence of the pop-rock group, Eraserheads, considered as a turning-point in the OPM music scene. In the wake of their success was the emergence of a string of influential bands such as Yano, Siakol, Parokya ni Edgar, Grin Department, Rivermaya, Moonstar 88 and Hungry Young Poets, each of which mixes the influence of a variety of pop and rock subgenres into their style.\nFilipino rock continues to flourish at present with newer bands such as Hale, Cuesh\u00e9, Sponge Cola, Chicosci, Kamikazee and Urbandub, and the emergence of the country's first virtual band, Mistula. Though only some of the spearheading bands are still fully intact, many old members have formed new bands such as Pupil, Sandwich, and Bamboo. A few band members such as Kitchie Nadal, Barbie Almalbis, and Rico Blanco have established steady solo careers.\nThough rock bands have been dominating the mainstream since their commercialization in the '90s, acoustic groups were still regularly showcased in the live band scene such as Side A, True Faith, Neocolours, South Border and Freestyle popularized songs that clearly reflect the sentimental character of OPM pop. Popular acoustic acts like Nina, Juris (of MYMP) and Aiza Seguerra also prove the diversity of Filipino pop.\nSolo belters and balladeers such as Regine Velasquez, Sharon Cuneta, Joey Albert, Donna Cruz, Zsa Zsa Padilla, Jaya, Jolina Magdangal and Martin Nievera had regular exposure on television and radio.\nRe-emergence of R&amp;B and novelty songs (2000s to present).\nBeginning in the early 2000s, Kyla, Nina and Jay R began to perform contemporary R&amp;B music with Gloc-9 and Abra of hip-hop genre.\nLocal sing and dance groups SexBomb Girls and Viva Hot Babes began to perform.\nPinoy pop renaissance (2010s).\nPinoy pop changed after 2010. Rock bands and novelty songs from the 1990s and 2000s started to fade out of the mainstream. Newer songs did not have influences from rock or hip-hop.\nIn 2010, Little Big Star 2nd runner-up and YouTube star Charice became the first Asian to peak on the top 10 (at No. 8) of the Billboard 200 for her debut album. She was also one of the first Asian artists to have a song peak at No. 1 for Billboard's Dance/Club Play Songs.\nNotable pop artists of the 2010s include Toni Gonzaga, Moira Dela Torre, Yeng Constantino and Sarah Geronimo whose songs \"Tala\" and \"Kilometro\" were chosen by CNN Philippines as best songs of the decade.\nThe rise of P-pop idol groups (2020s).\nFrom the influence of K-pop and J-pop, a new era of P-pop was born. The Philippines' first idol group MNL48, a sister group of the J-pop group AKB48, started a new era for P-pop when they debuted in 2018. Following them is the all-boy idol group SB19 who also debuted in 2018. They are the first Filipino act trained by a Korean entertainment company under the same system that catapulted K-pop artists into global stardom.

It is more powerful than a superpower.\nThe United States was a hyperpower after the cold war because it was the only superpower after the collapse of the Soviet Union. It had a big influence in politics, science, culture and military. It also influenced the balance of power and made a new world order.\nSome say that the United States is still a hyperpower because it is the only uncontested superpower (some say that China is/will be a superpower and some say it is/will not). \nAccording to the Asia Power Index 2020, the United States still has the lead on the \"military capacity\", \"cultural influence, resilience\" and \"defense networks,\" but falls behind China in \"economic and future resources\", \"economic relationships\" and \"diplomatic influence\". This index ranks power and influence only in Asia Pacific.\nIt is easy to see areas where the United States is no longer so dominant. Its economy is weakened by manufacturing abroad; internal social conflicts are greater. However, it is still by far the top country on military capability, though not on size of its army. Perhaps the world no longer has a superpower."}

In a revolving door, several panels are fixed on a central axis. The panel can then be rotated to enter or exit the building. Buildings are usually fitted with revolving doors to save energy: Revolving doors can be made to hinder airflow. This means that less heat is lost. The first to develop revolving doors was H. Bockhacker. In 1881, he registered a patent in Germany for a \"door without airflow\". Theophilus Van Kannel registered a patent for what he called \"storm door\", in 1888.\nRevolving doors also have problems: Once they start spinning, they force the people to keep a certain walking speed. People who cannot keep up the walking speed may fall and hurt themselves. People in a wheelchair cannot use revolving doors. The same probably applies to blind people. Revolving doors cannot be used in an emergency: They cannot be passed at a fast speed. For all these reasons, many countries have rules that buildings must also have other doors. In hotels and public buildings, is usual to find \"push\" doors either side of a revolving door.\nTurnstiles.\nTurnstile exit-only doors are often used at large sports stadia (stadiums), theme parks, and other such venues. They let people exit freely, but stop entry without payment. These doors usually work mechanically, with the door panels constructed of horizontal bars which pass through a \"wall\" of interlacing (interdigitated) bars. This blocks people from entering illegally through the exit."}

Until the Meiji period, the administrative headquarters of the Ono Domain region was established. In 2017, it was included in \"Second series Top 100 Japanese Castle\". The castle which appears every conditions are met in the morning, is called \"castle in the sky (\u5929\u7a7a\u306e\u57ce)\".\nIn 1575, Nagachika Kanamori began to build a castle on Kameyama mountain, a small mountain in Ono County. It took several years to build the castle. After the Kazunori Aoki\u2019s era, the Echizen Matsudaira family became a shogunal property, and the castle owner changed many times until the Doi family got it. The castle burned down in 1775 and was rebuilt in 1795 with the exception of the castle tower, but it was destroyed again after the Meiji Restoration. The castle tower today was built in the Sh\u014dwa period (1968). \nCastle tower.\nEchizen Ono Castle had a large watchtower on the second and third floors with an observation tower in the main area and another smaller watchtower on the second floor. It also had multiple \"Kuruwa\"--districts limited by water, fence, or anything else. These districts were the secondary area of a castle (\u4e8c\u30ce\u4e38, Ninomaru) and the furthest outer area (\u4e09\u30ce\u4e38, Sannomaru) at the beginning of the Kameyama mountain, connecting a canal and a river to protect the castle tower. Protecting the castle tower was important role for Echizen Ono castle. \nStone wall.\nEchizen Ono Castle has a stone wall (\u77f3\u57a3, ishigaki) which is a wall or fence made by assembling stones, with a construction method called Nozura-zumi (\u91ce\u9762\u7a4d\u307f), which is an old style stone wall piled up without processing natural stone. Nozura-zumi has a good drainage, which are resistant to weathering. This is nowadays a valuable historic site.\nLords of Echizen Ono Castle.\nIn the history of Echizen Ono Castle, 19 different feudal lords have changed (\u5927\u540d, daimyo), until the time in which the castle was sold in 1872. In addition to Nagachika Kanamori, the castle owners of the Azuchi-Momoyama period included Kazunori Aoki, who is said to be related to Hideyoshi Toyotomi, and Hideo Oda, the grandson of Nobunaga Oda."}

Dienocus is a dromaeosaurid theropod dinosaur. There are one known species in this genus: \"Deinonychus antirrhopus\".\nAppearance.\nThis dinosaur could be up to 3.4 meters (11 ft) long. It lived during the early Cretaceous Period, about 115\u2013108 million years ago (from the mid-Aptian to early Albian stages). Fossils have been found in the U.S. states of Montana, Utah, Wyoming, and Oklahoma, in rocks of the Cloverly Formation, Cedar Mountain Formation, and Antlers Formation. It had a large claw on its foot.\nHistory of paleontology.\nPaleontologist John Ostrom's study of \"Deinonychus\" in the late 1960s changed the way scientists thought about dinosaurs. It caused the \"dinosaur renaissance\" and made scientists argue whether dinosaurs were warm-blooded or cold-blooded. Before this, most people thought dinosaurs were big, slow, and looked and acted like modern reptiles. Ostrom told other scientists that \"Dienocus\" had a small body, sleek, horizontal posture, the same kind of spine that flightless birds have, and the large claws on its feet. All this, said Ostrom, meant \"Deinonychus\" was probably very fast and caught its food like a predator.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Deinonychus\" means \"terrible claw.\"\n\"Terrible claw\" refers to the unusually large, sickle-shaped talon on the second toe of each hindfoot. The fossil YPM 5205 preserves a large, strongly curved ungual. In life, archosaurs have a horny sheath over this bone, which extends the length. Ostrom looked at crocodile and bird claws and reconstructed the claw for YPM 5205 as over 120 millimeters (4.7 in) long. The species name \"antirrhopus\" means \"counterbalance\", which refers to Ostrom's idea about the function of the tail. As in other dromaeosaurids, the tail vertebrae have a series of ossified tendons and super-elongated bone processes. These features seemed to make the tail into a stiff counterbalance. Still, a fossil of the very closely related \"Velociraptor mongoliensis\" (\"IGM\" 100/986) has an articulated tail skeleton that is curved laterally in a long S-shape. This suggests that, in life, the tail could bend to the sides with a high degree of flexibility. In both the Cloverly and Antlers formations, \"Deinonychus\" remains have been found closely associated with those of the ornithopod \"Tenontosaurus\". Teeth discovered associated with \"Tenontosaurus\" specimens imply they were hunted, or at least scavenged upon, by \"Deinonychus\".\nDiscovery and naming.\nFossilized remains of \"Deinonychus\" have been recovered from the Cloverly Formation of Montana and Wyoming and in the roughly contemporary Antlers Formation of Oklahoma in North America. The Cloverly formation has been dated to the late Aptian through early Albian stages of the early Cretaceous, about 115 to 108 Ma. Additionally, teeth found in the Arundel Clay Facies (mid-Aptian), of the Potomac Formation on the Atlantic Coastal Plain of Maryland may be assigned to the genus. The first remains were uncovered in 1931 in southern Montana near the town of Billings. The team leader, paleontologist Barnum Brown, was primarily concerned with excavating and preparing the remains of the ornithopod dinosaur \"Tenontosaurus\", but in his field report from the dig site to the American Museum of Natural History, he reported the discovery of a small carnivorous dinosaur close to a \"Tenontosaurus\" skeleton, \"but encased in lime difficult to prepare.\" He informally called the animal \"Daptosaurus agilis\" and made preparations for describing it and having the skeleton, specimen AMNH 3015, put on display but never finished this work. Brown brought back from the Cloverly Formation the skeleton of a smaller theropod with seemingly oversized teeth that he informally named \"Megadontosaurus\". John Ostrom, reviewing this material decades later, realized that the teeth came from \"Deinonychus\", but the skeleton came from a completely different animal. He named this skeleton \"Microvenator\"."}

It was originally presented in these forms:\nThere are book versions of the three works in English. They are listed in the usual sources, for example .\nAlthough at first sight the authors seem to have suggested the signal is connected with the galaxy Andromeda, further thought suggests that \"from the direction of Andromeda\" could describe a source within our own galaxy. And so the authors avoid the implication that the message would have taken 2.5 million years in arriving, but could come from within our own galaxy.\nThe message might come from as close as 420 light years away.\nPlot line.\nThe main plot line is that a radio astronomer gets a series of impulses from the direction of the Andromeda galaxy. He interprets the message as instructions to build an advanced computer. When this is done, the computer instructs them as to how they can build a living individual. This they do. In the original BBC version Julie Christie plays \"Andromeda\". The lead scientist fears that her purpose is to enslave humanity.\nProperty rights in the series.\nThe original BBC tv versions have been mostly destroyed, and Christie was not signed up for the sequels. When the sequel was written, Christie had become too expensive for the BBC to hire again. At that time the BBC did not perhaps understand the concept of \"property rights\", an important part of the modern world. Media creations are properties. Property is not to be thought of as just buildings: any creative act is potentially a property in the sense of copyright."}

The person tends to judge other people's good behavior as them having a good personality and the person also judges other people's bad behavior as them having a bad personality. The error comes from the fact that the person judges themselves on the context or situation and not on personality. This can lead people to assume others are bad people instead of them making a mistake.\nAn example of this error would be if we had a person, who we will name Alice. Alice is a driver. Bob goes in front of her and Alice assumes he has bad personal qualities such as being selfish, being a bad driver, or being a jerk. However there are possible explanations that are related to context instead of personal qualities. Bob could have almost missed his flight, or his wife could be giving birth at the hospital. If she goes in front of someone else, she will likely make the opposite mistake and explain her behavior as situational instead of being a personal flaw. This is still the same error because it is an attribution (placement) that is wrong."}

Physically, carbon-oxygen white dwarfs with slow rotation are limited to below 1.44 solar masses. \nSince type Ia supernovae have a known brightness they can be used as standard candles to determine the distance to a galaxy once the stretch-factor is accounted for. \nWhen a runaway thermonuclear explosion rips through a white dwarf star and blows the star to bits, it is called a type 1a supernova. These explosions are incredibly violent and incredibly bright, sometimes outshining entire galaxies.\nType I (especially Ia) supernova create most of the iron and nickel found in the interstellar medium. Type 1a supernovae are several times more luminous than type Ib, Ic, and type II supernovae. They leave no core remnant behind, and happen when a low-mass star's core remnant (a white dwarf) detonates."}

The cabling allows the parts to be connected to the network so that removing one part doesn't impact the network. Here are some of the roles of the parts on the network:\nHow many devices.\nThe network of devices arranged above are usually distributed throughout the plane where designers need the \"doers\" to perform their function. Bus Controllers are usually somewhat centrally located towards the middle, but this isn't always the case. There needs to be one Bus Controller and there really needs to be one Remote Terminal, otherwise there is no need for the network. The maximum number of remote terminals is 30. There is no limit to the number of Bus Monitors because they do not need to be talked to directly by the Bus Controller\nHow does it work.\nThe Bus Controller initiates a conversation. Sometimes it talks to one part, sometimes two parts, sometimes all of the parts. The application inside the Bus Controller sends data to the part of the device that controls communication. This device changes that data into a Manchester Encoded signal and puts that data on the physical cable. All Remote Terminals can listen to that signal at more or less the same time and decide for themselves if they would like to \"take action.\" Some actions include \"turning off\" or \"tell me how you are doing\" (this is known as reporting the results of a built in test). Only one device on the network can talk at a time, or no device can understand what's trying to be communicated on the network, this is called a collision.\nWhat else do I need to know.\nThe protocol spec doesn't tell people that use it how to use it, only what it can do. This is like giving a child lego blocks but with no instructions on what to build. Lots of different organizations have used those lego blocks to build things that don't work together or work very differently than other networks."}

The Marlovian theory says that Christopher Marlowe wrote most of those poems and plays. The theory also says Marlowe did not die in Deptford on 30 May 1593. It says his death was faked. Like William Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe was an Elizabethan poet and playwright. They were both born in 1564.\nMarlovian theory began in the 1800s. The idea is that the Church wanted to punish Marlowe for being an atheist, so Queen Elizabeth's government helped him fake his death, leave the country and continue writing plays by pretending those plays were Shakespeare's.\nOne piece of the puzzle is that the play \"Lust's Dominion\" was attributed to Marlowe when it was published in 1657. The play borrows from a pamphlet published in 1599, about the death of King Philip II of Spain in 1598. Marlowe died in 1593. The attribution has been recognized as spurious (wrong) by critics and scholars for nearly two centuries."}

It literally translates to harm joy. It is the happiness that somebody gets when somebody else is hurt. Psychologists theorize that there are three causes for this emotion. Aggression, rivalry, or justice. Aggression-based schadenfreude happens because seeing someone else's group fail makes them feel better about themselves. Rivalry-based schadenfreude happens because seeing someone else fail makes them feel better about themselves. These may seem similar, but the difference is in that aggression is related to in-group and out-group identities, and rivalry is based on individuals. The last form is justice-based schadenfreude. This happens because people feel happy that someone bad is being punished. They feel good that the bad person is getting what they deserve."}

He escaped from prison many times, but was taken back after he was spotted by a police officer in a very expensive van with homemade tinted windows.\n1987 arrest.\nIn 1987, a month before his 30th birthday, McNair broke into and stole from a grain storage facility in Minot, North Dakota. He shot two men when stealing from another place that same year, and one of the men who McNair shot was killed. He was eventually arrested for the crimes, but when being questioned by police, he took lip balm out of his pocket and slipped his hands out of the cuffs the police had restrained him with during the arrest. He escaped the police station with the officers pursuing him from behind. McNair managed to hide inside a building when police officers came in to take him back to the police station. McNair jumped out of a window and crashed into a tree, but was injured when the branch he landed on snapped. After time in the hospital, McNair was housed at Ward County Jail in Minot, North Dakota. While serving time there, he broke through part of a wall in his cell, but police officers who worked there found out about it. After being moved to the North Dakota State Penitentiary, McNair and two other inmates escaped by crawling through the ventilation shaft. He went around the United States for ten months, but was arrested again and the officers marked him as a bad inmate, and moved him to the Oak Park Heights prison.\nMoving to other prisons.\nMcNair eventually joined a sit down plea that led to him being moved to Florence High Security Prison in Minneapolis. After serving time, he joined another plea that led to him being moved to a high security prison in Denver. After serving time in there, he was moved to a high security federal prison in Louisiana. There, his job was to fix damaged mail bags so they could be sent back to the post office. On April 5, 2006, McNair decided to create an escape pod and hide inside one of the mail bags in a pallet. The pallet was later shrink wrapped but McNair managed to use a tube that he could breathe through once he had secretly pushed through the packaging. When police took the mail bag outside, McNair escaped the prison.\nPolice experiences.\nLater that same day, he was running near train tracks when a police officer saw him. McNair told the officer that he did not escape prison, and that he was doing exercise in the area. McNair told the officer that he and his brother were staying at a hotel when he was actually escaping from prison. In 2007 after over a year, he was stopped by police in Canada when they had seen him driving a stolen car. While being questioned by an officer, McNair escaped from them again. During his time protecting himself from capture, McNair had been making fake identification cards, and used computer technology to create driver\u2019s licenses and monitor what the press was saying about him. He also appeared on Canada\u2019s 15 Most Wanted list multiple times. In November that same year, a police officer noticed a van that seemed to have homemade tinted windows. McNair had made the tints himself, but the officer was suspicious because the van looked like it was a lot of money. The officer took the plate number and called it in. The day after, another officer spotted the van. A chase started, and when McNair drove the van into a parking lot, he ran off, but was stopped by the officer.\nFinal prison sentence.\nMcNair now resides in ADX Florence, a supermax prison where inmates are locked down twenty-three hours a day, and they leave their cells with police by their side, who make sure they cannot escape the prison."}

It is different from psychosis, psychosis is a loss of reality. It can describe many things. The mildest form of it involves things such as daydreaming. A less mild form of it involves altered states of consciousness. This is non-pathological, meaning it is not considered a disorder or mental illness. These forms are often a coping mechanism or defense mechanism. This means that they protect against stress.\nWhen it becomes disruptive in a person's life, it becomes a mental illness. These mental illnesses are known as dissociative disorders. These include dissociative fugue, depersonalization-derealization disorder (DPDR), and dissociative identity disorder. They can be triggered by trauma, stress, drugs, or no known reason. Sometimes other mental illnesses can involve dissociation.

Shakti is the personification of the energy that is creative, sustaining, as well as destructive, sometimes referred to as auspicious source energy.\nAs the Shakti or Creatrix, She is known as \"Adi Shakti\" or \"Adi Para Shakti\" (i.e., Primordial Inconceivable Energy). On every plane of creation, energy manifests itself in all forms of matter, thermal energy, potential energy, gravitational energy etc. These are all thought to be infinite forms of the Para Shakti. But Her true form is unknown, and beyond human understanding. She is \"Anaadi\" (with no beginning, no ending) and \"Nitya\" (forever).\nIn Shaktism, Adi Parashakti is worshipped as the Supreme Being.\nOrigin.\nFound in a Paleolithic context in the Son River valley and dating to 9,000\u20138,000 BCE, the Baghor stone, says Jonathan Mark Kenoyer, is highly probable that the stone is associated with Shakti. The worshipping of Shiv and Shakti was also prevalent in Indus valley civilization.\nEvolution.\nThe Shakti goddess is also known as \"Amma\" in south India, especially in the states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Telangana, and Andhra Pradesh. There are many temples devoted to various incarnations of the Shakti goddess in most of the villages in South India. The rural people believe that Shakti is the protector of the village, the punisher of evil people, the cure of diseases, and the one who gives welfare to the village. They celebrate Shakti Jataras with great interest once a year. Some examples of Shakti names are Mahalakshmi, Kamakshi, Parvati, Lalita, Bhuvaneshwari, Durga, Meenakshi, Mariamman, Yellamma, Poleramma, and Perantalamma.\nShaktisim.\nSri Guru Amritananda Nath Saraswati, performing the Navavarana Puja, an important ritual in Srividya Tantric Shaktism, at the Sahasrakshi Meru Temple at Devipuram, Andhra Pradesh, India.\nShaktism regards Devi (lit., \"the Goddess\") as the Supreme Brahman itself with all other forms of divinity considered to be merely Her diverse manifestations. In the details of its philosophy and practice, Shaktism resembles Shaivism. However, \"Shaktas\" (Sanskrit: \u0936\u0915\u094d\u0924, \"\u015aakta\", ), practitioners of Shaktism, focus most or all worship on Shakti, as the dynamic feminine aspect of the Supreme Divine. Shiva, the masculine aspect of divinity, is considered solely transcendent, and Shiva's worship is usually secondary.\nShakti Peeths.\nMain article: Shakti Peetha\nAccording to some schools, there are four Adi Shakti Pitha and 51 Shakti centers of worship located in South Asia (four Adi Shakti Pitha are also part of 51 Shakti pithas but they are four major parts of Devi Sati's body. So, they are adi shakti pithas). They can be found in India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, Tibet and Pakistan. These are called Shakti Peethas. The list of locations varies. A commonly accepted list of Shakti Peethas and their temple complexes includes:\nOther pithas in Maharashtra are:\nBhajans and mantras.\nThere are many ancient Shakti devotional songs and vibrational chants in the Hindu and Sikh traditions (found in Sarbloh Granth). The recitation of the Sanskrit mantras is commonly used to call upon the Divine Mother.\n\"Merge in the Maha Shakti. This is enough to take away your misfortune. This will carve out of you a woman. Woman needs her own Shakti, not anybody else will do it ... When a woman chants the Kundalini Bhakti mantra, God clears the way. This is not a religion, it is a reality. Woman is not born to suffer, and woman needs her own power.\""}

In a theatre, novel, play or film, the audience immediately knows about him or her without further explanation. All types of fiction use this device, especially comedy.\nThey have been used in all forms of theatre, right back to the Ancient Greek theatre. The Star Wars movie franchise offers many examples. They are archetypal characters, simplified and \"flat\". As a result, they may be easy targets for parody, and criticized as clich\u00e9s. Stock characters help to identify a genre or subgenre. For example, a fairy tale or fantasy is likely to have a knight-errant as hero and a witch as opposition.\nOne stock character often used is the low-class character(s) who warn the hero of danger to come. Examples:\nIt seems their function is to introduce the idea of fatalism, the idea that we are not masters of our fate. Human fame and glory is temporary. Even Achilles has his weakness.\nAs the hero falls, he is usually allowed a final comment. Caesar's was \"Et tu, Brute?\" meaning \"Not you as well, Brutus?\" That's known as a valediction (means a farewell comment). Shakespeare has many examples: Another famous example is Richard III's last cry of \"A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse!\""}

In 2012, a Tamil remake of the film was released and it was called Nanban and in 2017, a Mexican remake of the film was released and it was called 3 Idiotas.\nPlot.\nRight as his flight is about to take off, wildlife photographer Farhan Qureshi receives a phone call from his collegemate Chatur \"Silencer\" Ramalingam, who informs him that he has got the whereabouts of his long-lost best friend and collegemate Ranchhoddas \"Rancho\" Shamaldas Chanchad. Farhan's airplane takes off but he fakes a heart attack and creates an emergency landing and escapes from the airport to the house of his other best friend and collegemate Raju Rastogi. The two then rush to the campus of their old college named Imperial College of Engineering and meet Chatur, who reminds them of the bet which they and Rancho had made ten years ago about who will end up more successful in the next ten years, as he boasts to them about his more successful career in the United States of America as the vice-president of Rockledge Corporation, an American conglomerate. Farhan and Raju initially berate him for his act, but calm down once he reveals to them that he has traced Rancho to Shimla. As the three leave for Shimla, Farhan reminisces about their college days.\nOver a flashback, it is shown that Farhan has come to stay at the Imperial College of Engineering as his father forced him to pursue engineering. He then befriends his second roommate Raju who, has come from a poor family which has pinned very high hopes on him to get out of poverty. While being ragged by the seniors, they stumble upon the seemingly naive Rancho, who comes from a rich family but has a passion for engineering. Rancho, Raju and Farhan, now good friends, meet their college director Dr. Viru Sahastrabuddhe a.k.a. Virus, whose doctrinal methods of learning contrast with Rancho's carefree love for knowledge, resulting in a tiff between them on their first meeting. One day, when Joy Lobo, a student with a passion for engineering similar to Rancho's, is denied graduation by Virus on grounds of failure to submit his project, he dumps his innovative drone camera, which is picked up by Rancho. After the trio learns of Joy's predicament, Rancho recreates the drone camera. Unfortunately, before he can see his drone camera coming to life, Joy committed suicide. Later, when Rancho insults and embarrasses Virus in front of the other students, holding his approach responsible for Joy's death, he complains to Raju and Farhan's parents via letters. The trio is then confronted by Farhan and Raju's respective parents at their respective houses. Later, the hungry trio gatecrashes a wedding for dinner, whence Rancho bumps into a woman named Pia, advising her to leave her materially obsessive fianc\u00e9 Suhas, which ends up in a comical demonstration pushing Pia to anger. However, in a twist, she turns out to be Virus' daughter, and Virus confronts the trio after Pia tricks Rancho; it turns out that the wedding is for Pia's elder sister Mona. The following morning, Virus summons Farhan and Raju and tells them to move in with Chatur, but Farhan decides to stay back, while Raju reluctantly decides to go on despite his friends' warning. Seeking to trap Chatur in order to teach Raju a lesson, Rancho and Farhan print Chatur's Teachers' Day speech edited with obscene words when the librarian, Dubey, is distracted by the duo. Following the speech debacle, which still fails to convince Raju, Chatur learns about the prank, only to angrily confront Rancho in a drunken state, when he makes a bet with Rancho about who would be more successful ten years later. After a few days, Rancho manipulates Pia into insulting and briefly dumping Suhas, which angers her. However, he learns that Raju's paralyzed father has suffered a stroke, and a reluctant Pia gives in to his plea for help. Rancho quickly admits him in a hospital by riding him into the hospital premises on Pia's scooter. Raju, who is able to catch up, realises his mistake on hearing that timely intervention saved his father from near death, and reunites with Rancho and Farhan. Pia also understands Rancho's character and falls in love with him. The trio writes exams, but Farhan and Raju are placed last, while discovering, in a shocker, that Rancho has topped, after they see Chatur venting frustration over his second rank.\nBack to the present, Farhan, Raju and Chatur reach Shimla and go to the house where Rancho lives. Over there, they are shocked to meet another young man, who identifies himself as the real Ranchoddas Shamaldas Chanchad. Farhan and Raju question Chatur about the Shimla address who reveals to them that he spotted Rancho in a photo taken by his secretary Tracy when she had come to Shimla to meet international scientist Phunsukh Wangdu, a sensational inventor with 400 patents to credit, who he has been trying to sign a deal with ahead of the Japanese rivals. Farhan and Raju then confront and threaten the \"imposter\" who, in confessing that he is the real Ranchoddas Shamaldas Chanchad, inadvertently reveals to them that the acquaintance they knew was actually one Chhote, the son of the Chanchad family's gardener, who had an immense passion for learning and studying, and was taken in by the family after being orphaned. Ranchhoddas reveals that he would take advantage of Chhote's thirst for knowledge by having him appear as a proxy for his examinations and also have his assignments written by him. Shamaldas instructed Ranchhoddas's school headmaster, who caught the bluff one day, to continue the ruse so that Ranchhoddas would have a degree to his name. Ranchhoddas went to London for four years, while Chhote assumed his identity. Revealing that Shamaldas had struck a deal with Chhote to get him to attend college in return for him severing ties with his batchmates immediately after graduation, he tells them that Chhote misses them a lot. Farhan and Raju, promising to keep the 'Chhote' story a secret, leave with Chatur for Ladakh, where Chhote is apparently working in a school; Chatur is distressingly delighted to discover that \"Rancho\" is a teacher.\nBack in the past, during their final year, Rancho and Pia fall in love and begin a relationship. After Farhan and Raju drunkenly break into Virus's house and pee while Rancho sneaks in to propose to Pia, Virus threatens Raju with rustication the next morning unless he agrees to implicate Rancho in the scandal. Unwilling to either betray his best friend or disappoint his family yet again, a distraught Raju jumps off the window to attempt suicide, and ends up in a coma. The group successfully recovers him over the next two months, after which he attends his placement interview with a newfound confidence and secures a job while Farhan also successfully convinces his father about his passion for wildlife photography and contentment with the job he got with his role model, photographer Andre Istvan, in Hungary. Unable to take the insult any longer, Virus rigs the final examination question paper in order to fail Raju, but Pia obtains duplicate keys to her father's office and helps Rancho and Farhan break into the office to steal the question paper.\nFarhan and Raju, again in the present, suddenly remember Pia, and learn that she is getting married in Manali. Deciding to pick her up anyway, they gag Chatur, who is instead intending to catch up with Phunsukh Wangdu, and head straight to Manali. Once the duo is able to sneak in, Farhan splits to reunite with Pia, while Raju substitutes himself for a housekeeper to ruin the groom's wedding suit in order to hold back Suhas. Although Pia initially refuses to break off the marriage, believing Suhas is a changed man who has abandoned his material obsession, she is surprised to hear Suhas screaming about his expensive suit, leading Farhan to realize that his plan has worked. Raju escapes in the heat of the moment with the suit, claiming to Suhas that he will return it in mint condition, but instead proceeds to fill in as the groom. An initially worried Pia, as she finds this out, grows concerned over public reaction to the ruse, causing Raju to reveal himself and confront her about her love for Rancho even as Suhas turns up in a gown. As she spots Farhan at the entrance, with the car doors opened, Pia breaks free from the bond and elopes with the duo, as the story rolls again into a flashback where Rancho and Farhan successfully retrieved the question paper for Raju.\nDespite Raju refusing to use the paper, Virus discovers what happened and has the three rusticated in the middle of the night; his initial anger soon turns into disappointment, however, when Pia admits her role in the events, confronting both him and Mona over the suicidal demise of Virus' elder son, which was misinterpreted by Virus as an accident, simply because his passion for literature and desire to be a writer was overruled by Virus, who was insistent on his son becoming an engineer. As the trio is leaving the institute in the middle of heavy rainstorms, Mona goes into labor no later after Pia walks out of the house, and Rancho, unable to get her to the hospital, enlists the help of Pia on a webcam and other students in, successfully conducting the delivery with a makeshift ventouse. Realizing the fault in his ways and how genius Rancho is, Virus lets the trio stay for writing exams and gifts Rancho a very rare Space Pen. Rancho tops the university in the final year, but abruptly leaves the graduation ceremony without informing anyone and has never been heard of again.\nBack to the present, Farhan, Raju, Pia and Chatur finally travel to the school in Ladakh, where, after unbounding Chatur, they are finally reunited with Rancho just as Chatur, who catches up with the trio, condescendingly insults Rancho's apparent status as a schoolmaster and has him sign a \u201cDeclaration of Defeat\u201d and walks away in supposed victory. When Pia asks Rancho his real name, he reveals himself to be Phunsukh Wangdu and promptly calls off the deal with Chatur, to his shock. Wangdu, Pia, Farhan and Raju run away laughing while a humiliated Chatur chases after them."}

(350-375 CE) was a ruler of the Gupta Empire of Ancient India. He was a son of the Gupta emperor Chandragupta I and the Licchavi princess Kumaradevi. He greatly expanded his dynasty's political power.\nThe Allahabad Pillar inscription, a \"prashasti\" (eulogy) was written by his courtier Harishena. It told of his many military conquests. It suggests that he defeated several kings of northern India. Also, that he added their territories to his empire. He also marched along the south-eastern coast of India. He advanced to move as far as the Pallava kingdom. In addition, he subjugated several frontier kingdoms and tribal oligarchies.\nSamudragupta performed the Ashvamedha sacrifice to prove his imperial sovereignty. According to his coins, he remained undefeated. His gold coins and inscriptions suggest that he was an accomplished poet. He also played music. His expansionist policy was continued by his son Chandragupta II.\nExtent of the empire.\nSamudragupta's empire included a core territory in northern India. It was directly controlled by the emperor. Besides, it included some monarchical and tribal tributary states. Historian R. C. Majumdar theorizes that Samudragupta directly controlled an area extending from the Ravi River (Punjab) in the west to the Brahmaputra River (Bengal and Assam) in the east, and from the Himalayan foothills in the north to the Vindhya hills in the south. The south-western boundary of his territory roughly followed a line drawn from present-day Karnal to Bhilsa.\nIn the south, Samudragupta's empire definitely included Eran in present-day Madhya Pradesh. On there, his inscription has been found. The Allahabad Pillar inscription suggests that he reached early up to Kanchipuram in the south. However, since the claims in the Allahabad Pillar inscription are from a royal eulogy, they must be treated with danger.\nPersonality.\nSamudragupta's coins show him as a tall, strong man. The Allahabad Pillar inscription presents him as a compassionate ruler. It was stated that his \"mind was engaged in providing relief to the low, the poor, the helpless, and the afflicted\". It also stated that he reinstated many royal families which had lost their kingdoms, including the kings defeated by him. At the same time, it states that he maintained strict administration (\"Prachanda shasana\").\nThe inscription states that Samudragupta became famous among the learned people because of his poetical works. He earned the epithet \"king of poets\". This suggests that he composed some poetical works. But none of these works now survive.\nThe inscription also says that Samudragupta embarrassed the celestial musician Tumburu and Narada by his lovely performances of music. Samudragupta's musical talents are also corroborated by his gold coins which depict him playing a veena. \nThe inscription praises Samudragupta's wisdom and intellect. It was stated that he was smarter than the preceptor of the Lord of the Gods (that is, Brihaspati)."}

Life as we know it depends on water, and most types of life started in the seas. Earth is the only planet known with liquid water on its surface. The water on Earth may have come from the Solar System as it formed, or it may have formed on Earth. Both are possible.\nOur planet is in the habitable zone, not so far out that all water freezes, and not so close to the Sun that all water evaporates into space. This is why liquid water, necessary for life as we know it, continues to exist on the surface of Earth.\nIt was long thought that Earth\u2019s water did not come from the planet\u2019s region of the protoplanetary disk. Instead, it was thought water must have been delivered to Earth from the outer Solar System later in its history. However, recent research suggests that hydrogen inside the Earth played a role in the formation of the ocean. The two ideas are not mutually exclusive: there is evidence water was delivered to Earth by impacts from icy planetesimals similar in composition to asteroids in the outer edges of the asteroid belt.\nOne problem, not yet resolved, is that the noble gas isotope ratios of Earth's atmosphere are different from those of its mantle. This suggests they were formed from different sources."}

The election was held on November 3, 2020. Biden won the election with 306 votes in the Electoral College to Donald Trump's 232. \nBefore the election Donald Trump claimed without any evidence that there was election fraud. He refused to give up and him and his allies attempted to overturn the results of the election. Trump filed dozens of legal challenges to the results, which were rejected by at least 86 judges, some that Trump even hired. The courts found that his claims had no evidence to prove that there was fraud.\nPro-Trump protesters, including groups such as the Proud Boys, took part in many protests in Washington, D.C., state capitals, and other locations across the nation to show that they did not agree with the election results and shout Trump's claims of election fraud.\nOn January 6\u2014the day when the U.S. Congress counts the electoral votes\u2014Trump supporters got together for the \"Save America\" rally where people heard speeches from Trump and Rudy Giuliani. Before the speeches were over, a large mob of protesters marched on to Congress and stormed the building. Congress was in session at the time, certifying the Electoral College vote count. Several buildings in the U.S. Capitol complex were evacuated, and protesters broke past security to enter the U.S. Capitol building, including National Statuary Hall.\nAfter the storming of the U.S. Capitol, at least 36 House Democrats called for Trump's immediate impeachment and removal by Congress.\nArmed supporters of Trump have continued protesting after of the storming of the US Capitol. As of January 10, armed protests were being planned at the state capitals of most states. Thousands of soldiers were sent to protect the capital, and by the inauguration ceremony for Biden, up to 25,000 soldiers were sent to guard against anymore threats to security. Protests have continued in some U.S. cities after Biden became president.\nProtest.\nProtest in support of Donald Trump started on November 4.\nJanuary 6.\nOn January 6, the protesters planned to march to the United States Capitol. A crowd of thousands of Trump supporters first listened to a speech by Trump. He told them again the election had been stolen and said, \"We will never give up. We will never concede. ... Our country has had enough. We're not going to take it anymore.\" He urged them to march on the Capitol and \"show strength\". Many people then marched on the Capitol, where they got past the police, broke windows, and stormed inside the Capitol building. They marched through Statuary Hall. Rioters took over the Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's office, flipping tables and ripping photos from walls; there was looting in the Capitol. Many police officers were injured in the violence at the Capitol. One died of his injuries, and another committed suicide over the following weekend. A woman was shot inside the Capitol and later died; no information has been told about the shooter. At least one improvised explosive device was found on Capitol, and another was close by at the headquarters of the Republican Party.\nJanuary 17.\nThe FBI reported that protests were being planned at all United States state capitols and in Washington, D.C., and that they are likely to take place from January 16 to 20.

Smoking is harmful to the lungs, and can cause many diseases such as cancer, pneumonia, and many others. When a user smokes, the chemicals from inside the cigarette damage the body, including the smoke, making the person more likely to get certain diseases.\nIn public areas such as arenas or police stations, smoking is usually not allowed. This is because the smoke from the cigarette goes into the air, and can be breathed in by other people. Signs have to be placed in public areas to stop people from smoking while there. If a man was smoking while walking near a police station and he didn\u2019t listen to the sign, he would have questions asked to him or be arrested by police. \nSmoking can cause heart attacks, if continued for years of using tobacco or any other powders used for smoking, including marijuana. Smoking can cause mental, as well as physical health problems, such as schizophrenia, depression, mood swings and many others. If a smoker continues smoking for years, or even decades, their health will worsen. Smoking can cause coughing, or inflammation (swelling) of the throat or lungs. The alveoli are air sacs via which breathing happens, but they will become badly damaged. Once breathed in, the tobacco smoke travels down the trachea and enters the lungs. When entering the body, the smoke would damage the cilia, which are millions of small hairs that push away mucus when it enters the body. If the lungs become even more damaged, smokers may not be able to breathe on their own, and they will be put on a device to help them breathe such as a ventilator. In some cases, smoking causes the lining of the lungs to become inflamed, making the smoker unable to breathe, which leads to death."}

In Australia, it is just called a \u201cmagpie\u201d or \u201cmaggie\u201d. Its scientific name is \"Gymnorhina tibicen\".\nAustralian magpies are related to butcherbirds and currawongs. They live in bush land and in cities near people. They are well known in Australian culture.\nDescription.\nAustralian magpies are from 37 to 43 cm long. They do not have very long tails like European magpies. They are mostly black, with white on the back of their necks, and under their tails. They have white on their wings that can be seen when they are flying. An adult magpie has red eyes, black legs, and a white beak with black tip. Young magpies have brown eyes and their chest feathers are less dark. There are nine kinds of magpies (subspecies or races) in different parts of the country. Some subspecies have black backs and some have white.\nOther common black-and-white birds in Australia are the butcherbird (or \u201cbutcher-bird\u201d) and the magpie-lark (also called \u201cpeewee\u201d). Butcherbirds have white chests and are smaller than magpies. Magpie-larks are also smaller, are thinner than butcherbirds, and have a different pattern of black and white markings. Currawongs are bigger than magpies and are mostly black. Magpie-larks are not related to the family of magpies, butcherbirds, and currawongs.\nBehaviour.\nThey walk on the ground where they look for insects and lizards to eat. Many other birds hop (move with small jumps), but magpies walk. When they are not looking for food, they stand or perch in trees or on man-made structures. \nWhen magpies have baby chicks in their nests, the adults will \u201cswoop\u201d at nearby people \u2013 flying at their heads \u2013 to chase them away.\nSome people feed magpies by throwing small pieces of meat to them. Magpies can learn to come near humans for food. They do not usually let people touch them."}

Together with Friedrich W\u00f6hler, he discovered silicon nitride in 1857.\nDeville was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1860. In 1885, the \"rue Sainte-Claire-Deville\" in the 12th \"arrondissement de Paris\" was named in his honour."}

These people include the Arabs, but not all Arabs live in Arabia. People from the Arabian Desert, known as Bedouins, herded animals as nomads. They were grouped into extended families and tribes. People from other parts of it lived in villages and towns.\nBefore the Muslim era.\nAround 3000 BC, people near the Persian Gulf were trading with Mesopotamia. Dilmun which is now Bahrain, was the center of trade. By 2000 BC, parts of South Arabian Peninsula were trading with Ancient Egypt. During the peaks of their empires, Assyria and Babylonia controlled North and West Arabian Peninsula. \nSometime around 1000 BC, the kingdom of Saba' appeared in South Arabian Peninsula. There were also other kingdoms in South Arabian Peninsula, including Ma'in and Hadhramaut. In the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, Parthia expanded into South and East Arabian Peninsula. Saba' and Parthia became richer because of trade between Egypt and India. In the 1st century BC, Saba' conquered Ma'in. Near Saba', around 115 BC, the kingdom of Himyar appeared. In North Arabian Peninsula, Nabat was a trading kingdom in the 5th century BC. In 106 AD, the Roman Empire took control of Nabat. Parthia lost some wars to Rome and then left East Arabian Peninsula. The Bedouins expanded their area into more parts. Some of them moved to the East and North. \nBy the 4th century (300-400) AD, Himyar conquered all other kingdoms of South Arabian Peninsula. Christianity came to Arabian Peninsula, from Abyssinia and Syria. Some people in Himyar followed Judaism. A Jewish king of Himyar killed Christians. Abyssinia and Rome ruled by Justinian were both Christian countries. In 525 they attacked Himyar. In North and Central Arabian Peninsula, two kingdoms had appeared in the 3rd and 4th centuries AD: The Lakhmids and the Ghassanids. The Sassanid Empire from Persia supported the Lakhmids (and Himyar), and Rome supported the Ghassanids. These two empires were at war. In the 6th century the Bedouins fought each other in wars called the Jahiliyyah. \nMuslim era.\nIn 610, Muhammad, an Arab from Mecca, claimed that God was speaking to him. The people of Mecca, mostly from the Quraysh tribe, worshipped many gods. Muhammad said that there was only one God. Muhammad founded the religion of Islam, and his followers, called Muslims, conquered Arabian Peninsula by war. After Muhammad died in 632, men called caliphs ruled the Muslims in empires called caliphates. These include the Rashidun, Umayyad, and Abbasid caliphates. Some parts of Arabian Peninsula, including Oman, were not always part of the caliphates. Rulers from the 900s to the 1200s included the Fatimid Caliphate, Seljuk Empire, and Ayyubid dynasty. Islam was divided into two forms called Sunni and Shi'a, who fought wars against each other. Yemen and Oman were ruled by different people at times, including the Rasulid dynasty in Yemen.\nThe Hashemite Sharifs of Mecca ruled the Hejaz (Western Arabian Peninsula) region starting in the 900s. The Mamluk Empire from Egypt had control over the Sharifs in the 1300s. In 1517, the Ottoman Empire from Turkey conquered the Mamluks. The Ottomans took control in the Hejaz, Yemen, and other parts of Arabian Peninsula. European countries wanted to control more of Arabian Peninsula, so they fought wars against the Ottomans. Europeans, mainly the Portuguese, won some cities on the coast in the 1500s and 1600s. Persians won control in Oman, and Oman also built its own empire. In the 1700s, a new form of Islam called Wahhabism spread to nomads. In the 1800s Wahhabis led by the House of al-Saud went to war against the Ottoman Empire. Britain helped the Wahhabis and gave them countries along the Persian Gulf. Britain also took part of Yemen into the British Empire. In World War I, the Allied Powers fought against the Ottomans. The Ottomans lost the war, so the Allied Powers broke up their empire into smaller countries. In 1932 Ibn Saud, from the House of al-Saud, founded the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."}

In modern times, they are used to teach physics and how steam engines work."}

It was at that time that Governor-General William Cameron Forbes was the president of the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation from 1911-1913. Governor-General Forbes formed the Far Eastern Olympic Association.\nThe first event was held on the Manila Carnival grounds (later the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex) in Malate, Manila, Philippines on February 4, 1913 and was known as the \"First Oriental Olympic Games\". Forbes was also the one who formally declare the games open. Six countries participated in the eight-day event: the host country then-named Philippine Islands, Republic of China, Empire of Japan, British East Indies (Malaysia), Kingdom of Thailand and British crown colony Hong Kong.\nIn 1915, the name changed to Far Eastern Championship Games and the association to Far Eastern Athletic Association when the event was held at Hongkou Park in Shanghai, China. They were held there again in 1921. The games were held every two years except in 1929 when Japan decided to delay the project to 1930. The FEAA decided to change the time table to four years and the Philippine Islands hosted the tenth games in 1934. Dutch East Indies (Indonesia) joined in the 1934 FECG.\nThe 1934 edition was held in a period of dispute between China and Japan, following the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931. Inclusion of people from this region in the games caused controversy between the two member nations, which resulted in the break-up of the Far Eastern Athletic Association. In September 1937, Japan invaded China with the Marco Polo Bridge Incident and started the Second Sino-Japanese War (which later became part of World War II), thus the planned games in 1938 were cancelled.\nSports.\nA total of nine different sports were contested over the lifetime of the competition. Eight of the sports featured on each programmes of the games, with the ninth sport \u2013 cycling \u2013 being held once only, in 1915."}

They are culturally and linguistically similar to both Rangpuri people of northern Bangladesh and Goalpariya people of Assam. A small number of the community are also found in the neighboring state of Bihar, where they are known as the Bengali Shaikh. These people are more commonly known as Rajbongshi Muslims. The Nashya are considered to be an important indigenous group found in northern West Bengal. They are homogeneous with the Koch Rajbongshi people and are bi-linguistic speaking both Bengali language and Koch language with Koch Rajbongshi language being replaced by Bengali language among the newer generations.\nEtymology.\nThere are descendants from Koch-Rajbonshi, Mech, Rabha, Bodo and Indo-Aryan people who converted to Islam. They mainly speak the Goalpariya dialect . They are mainly settled in the districts of Dhuburi, Goalpara, South Salmara and Kokrajhar. These people were loose followers of Hinduism. But when a small section of these people converted to Islam, the act was frowned upon. The local Hindus started calling them \"nosto seikh\" meaning \"spoiled Shaikh\". But as more number of people got converted to Islam with time these people came in contact with mainstream Muslims, and the term \"nosto seikh\" slowly got islamicised into \"Nashya seikh\".\nOrigin.\nThe Nashyas trace their origin to the indigenous communities of Koch Rajbongshi of northern West Bengal, though some of them are also from Mech community. There conversion to Islam is said to have taken over two to three centuries, and the Nashya still retain many cultural traits of their pre-Islamic past. Most people of the community are non-practicing Muslims though the newer generations are becoming increasing Islamic due to globalization. From historic evidence, it seems a segment of the indigenous population of north Bengal converted started to convert to Islam when the region fell under the control of Bakhtiyar Khilji. Some of the earliest converts were the chiefs Ali Mach and Kala Pahar. Tradition also ascribes the conversion of several lineages to Sufi saints such as Torsa Pir, Pagla Pir, Shah Fakir Sahib and Shah Gari Sahib."}

The 2017 FIFA U-20 World Cup took place in South Korea.\nHost selection.\nAlong with asking member associations whether it wished to host the Under 20, Under 17 or the Beach Soccer World Cup in 2017 (along with Women's Tournaments a year previous), a declaration of interest would need to have been sent by 15 May 2013. A total of 12 countries submitted a bid to host the tournament by the May 2013 deadline:\nThe final decision on who would be hosts were made as part of FIFA's Executive Committee meetings in Brazil on 5 December 2013 with Korea Republic being awarded the hosting rights.\nQualified teams.\nA total of 24 teams qualified for the final tournament. In addition to South Korea who qualified automatically as hosts, the other 23 teams qualified from six separate continental competitions. Starting from 2017, the Oceania Football Confederation received an additional slot (in total two), while UEFA will have five instead of six slots.\nVenues.\nCheonan, Daejeon, Incheon, Seogwipo, Jeonju and Suwon were the six cities chosen to host the competition from a shortlist of nine, with Seoul, Pohang, and Ulsan not chosen.\nPreparation.\nAs part of preparations for the U-20 World Cup, the 2016 Suwon JS Cup, an international football friendly tournament, was held to prepare the host organisers.\nOrganization.\nThe following were key milestones in the organization of the tournament:\nDraw.\nThe draw was held on 15 March 2017, 15:00 KST (), at the Suwon Artrium in Suwon, South Korea. Two Argentine players who have won the FIFA U-20 World Cup, Diego Maradona and Pablo Aimar, participated in the draw. Minho Choi from the South Korean idol group SHINee also participated in the draw.\nThe 24 teams were drawn into six groups of four teams, with hosts South Korea being allocated to position A1. The teams were seeded into their respective pots based on their results in the last five FIFA U-20 World Cups (more recent tournaments weighted more heavily), with bonus points awarded to confederation champions. Teams from the same confederation could not be drawn against each other for the group stage.\nMatch officials.\nA total of 22 refereeing trios (a referee and two assistant referees), 5 support referees, and 21 video assistant referees were appointed for the tournament. This was the first FIFA underage tournament which uses the video assistant referee.\nSquads.\nEach team had to name a preliminary squad of 35 players. From the preliminary squad, the team had to name a final squad of 21 players (three of whom must be goalkeepers) by the FIFA deadline. Players in the final squad could be replaced due to serious injury up to 24 hours prior to kickoff of the team's first match. The squads were announced by FIFA on 11 May 2017.\nGroup stage.\nThe top two teams of each group and the four best third-placed teams advanced to the round of 16.\nAll times are local, KST ().\nTiebreakers.\nThe rankings of teams in each group were determined as follows (regulations Article 17.7):\nIf two or more teams were equal on the basis of the above three criteria, their rankings were determined by:\nGroup A.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup B.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup C.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nResults.\nGroup D.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup E.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup F.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nRanking of third-placed teams.\nThe four best teams among those ranked third are determined as follows (regulations Article 17.8):&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nKnockout stage.\nIn the knockout stage, if a match was level at the end of normal playing time, extra time was played (two periods of 15 minutes each) and followed, if necessary, by a penalty shoot-out to determine the winner. However, for the third place match, no extra time was played and the winner was determined by kicks from the penalty mark.\nIn the round of 16, the four third-placed teams were matched with the winners of groups A, B, C, and D. The specific match-ups involving the third-placed teams depend on which four third-placed teams qualified for the round of 16:\nFinal.\nThis was the first ever final for both England and Venezuela in the history of the tournament, in their 11th and 2nd appearances respectively. England's previous best result was in 1993 when they finished third, while Venezuela were eliminated in the round of 16 in 2009. This was England's first appearance and victory in the final of a global football tournament since their senior side's 1966 FIFA World Cup victory, ending 51 years of waiting for a global tournament trophy.\nAwards.\nThe following awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament. They were all sponsored by Adidas, except for the FIFA Fair Play Award and Goal of the Tournament.\nBroadcasters rights.\nThe following companies held the broadcasters rights:"}

{"id": "821533", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=821533", "title": "Serial position effect", "text": "The serial position effect is a psychological phenomenon that suggests that people are more likely to remember the first and last items on a list, rather than the middle ones. The term was invented in 1913 by Herman Ebbinghaus, a German psychologist who was interested in testing his ability to remember items on a list (). To do so he performed free-recall experiments on himself using a list of 2000 made-up syllables. He observed that how well he would remember an item depended on the item's position on the list and is reflected by the serial position curve. The serial position curve reflects two . The first 2-3 items and up to the last 8 items in a list are always better remembered than those in the middle (in lists with 20 or more items). These findings are not influenced by the size and presentation rate (how fast items were presented) of the list. They show a primacy and recency effect. \nFree Recall.\nFree recall is an experimental method used in psychology to test memory. It is the most common method of studying the serial position effect. It involves presenting participants with a list of items (normally words) and asking them to remember them in any order. However, one major disadvantage is that it is very artificial because experiments are often conducted in labs. So results of free-call experiments may not fully reflect the real world. \u00a0\nPrimacy effect.\nThe tendency to remember the first piece(s) of information given to us is known as the primacy effect. Many psychologists propose that the primacy effect may be a result of rehearsal. Participants may be able to rehearse previous items in the list before being introduced to new ones (repeating the first item in their head by itself, then the first followed by the second when it is presented, then the third after the first two items, and so on). Therefore, items at the start of the list are more likely to be rehearsed than middle and end items. Slower presentation rates allow participants to rehearse a larger number of items, causing a larger primacy effect.\nIn the 1970s psychologists became interested in testing the role rehearsal played on the primacy effect. In 1972 psychologist Phillip Marshal tested whether eliminating rehearsal would affect the primacy effect. He did this by engaging his participants with a word-sorting task while presenting a list of 18 common nouns. Participants were not asked to learn the nouns in this experimental condition but were still tested on recall accuracy. Being unaware that researchers were going to test the participants\u2019 memory meant that there was no need for rehearsal. Marshal found that eliminating rehearsal also eliminated any significant primacy effect. Which proved that rehearsal accounted for the existence of a primacy effect. \nIn 1971, Dewey Rundus developed a technique called overt rehearsal (participants were asked to recite their thoughts out loud), to test \"how\" and \"when\" participants rehearsed each item in a list. In 1977 Brodie and Murdock, used the overt rehearsal technique to offer an alternate explanation for the primacy effect. They discovered that even as participants got towards the end of the list, they were still rehearsing initial terms. Because of this, the initial items were still present in the participant's short-term memory (STM) towards the end of the list, creating a recency effect. Though Brodie and Murdock acknowledged that rehearsal is essential to the primacy effect, they asserted that the primacy effect may indirectly be a type of recency effect.\nRecency effect.\nThe tendency to remember items towards the end of a list is known as the recency effect. Unlike primacy, the recency effect is not influenced by changes in presentation rates and list length. Instead, psychologists have found that asking participants to list the items in the \u2018order they were presented\u2019 decreases the recency effect. Additionally, Glanzer and Kunitz's famous 1966 study found that delaying the retention period (the time between the presentation of the last item and recall test) by just 30 seconds, got rid of the recency effect. Interestingly in 1990, researchers tried to engage participants with a \u2018distractor task\u2019 during the retention period. This is a task that suppresses short-term memory (rehearsal), for example counting backward from 3. And results showed that the presence of a distractor task also eliminated the recency effect.\nTherefore the recency effect is commonly explained by short-term memory (STM)(also known as primary or working memory). Our STM can store a small amount of information (2-4 items) for a limited time. The final few items of a list being present in our STM during recall may be one reason for the primacy effect. This theory explains why the recency effect is generally larger than the primacy effect. More effort is needed to retrieve initial items from long-term memory (LTM). However, distractor tasks can easily suppress or distract STM, explaining why they eliminate the recency effect.\nNewer research, however, shows that the recency effect can exist without STM. For instance, Bjork and Whitten showed that even when STM was engaged there may be a delayed, long-term recency effect. During their study, they added a \"continuous\" distractor task to free recall to suppress STM. This meant participants did a distractor task after each item was presented. Because this did not eliminate the recency effect as expected, some psychologists suspected that the recency effect is based on a theory of temporal context (literally meaning the context of time). Although theories in this field are vague and still developing. The general idea remains that a contextual element is attached to each item on the list. During recall, the test\u2019s context will act as a (a prompt that will help us remember). The later the item in the list, the similar the presentation context would be to test context. However, recall is probably dependent on the effectiveness of the retrieval cue.\nLink to models of memory.\nEarlier research directly related the serial position effect to single store mechanisms such as LTM (primacy) and STM (recency). And research on brain-damaged patients with amnesia (with damaged LTM) who showed a recency effect but not a primacy effect during recall tasks, provides good evidence for this. \nOn the other hand, the serial position effect is also supported by dual-store or multi-store models of memory. For instance, research on the serial position effect provides some of the strongest evidence for the by Atkinson and Shieffrin. Plus, research around the long-term recency effect may provide evidence for theories of the . "}

In her last two pages of her article titled, \"Saamen murre nimelt\u00e4 hoseff\", she talks about how the language most likely formed as a dialect of sami in the late middle ages but then over time reformed due to the hoffish-sami group's migration. The hoffish-sami people she interviewed said that their ancestors moved a lot from northern finland to as far as southern norway while trading furs.

The establishment of the theory is evidence against the rational choice theory.\nFirst establishment and one scientific example.\nThe peak\u2013end rule was first established by Daniel Kahneman and others in 1993. In the experiment, participants were divided into two groups. They had to undergo an unpleasant experience. Everything else was the same, except for one group who had to go through an extra, less unpleasant experience at the end. Let us call this group Group B and previous group Group A.\nThe researchers concluded that the most unpleasant, the peak, and the final intensity of unpleasantness, the end were used to evaluate the procedure. In this case, the end of Group B is less unpleasant. At the same time, the peak of both Group A and Group B were the same. Thus, the sum of the unpleasantness of the peak and the end was less for Group B. As a result, participants from Group B found the experience less unpleasant, although for both the duration of and the sum of unpleasantness, Group A &lt; Group B.\nExplanations.\nWhy only the peak and the end?\nThe peak-end rule is a type of . The peak and the end simplify and represent the whole experience. It reduces people's and helps people make quick decisions.From an evolutionary point of view, emotion related memories help us survive, keep us safe. For example, fear related memories help us recognize and better deal with dangerous situations.\nThe peak is memorable.\nWhen memory sticks, it lasts longer and can be recalled easier. Memories associated with strong emotions stick. Experiments were done to prove strong emotion-related things are recalled more often. An experiment done by found a biological explanation for this. \nThe end is memorable.\nWhy our memory prefers what happened at the end can be explained by the recency effect. suggests that we consider recent events to be more important. What happens at the end of an experience is more recent to us. Thus, we consider the things that happen at the end of an experience to be more important. The end is more memorable than other parts.\nApplication.\nHow to leave a good impression.\nAdding a positive peak can establish a good memory of an experience even though there may be unimportant unpleasant moments in between. This technique has been applied to many fields, for example, the business field. When customers are leaving, salesmen help the customer hold the door. This act leaves a good final and overall impression. Another example is in the educational field. To make receiving negative feedback more acceptable, ending with the most pleasant part of the feedback will help.\nBecome regulars.\nPeople's memories of an experience influence their decision making. Adding a good end encourages people to experience the event a second time. Some medical procedures are too painful for the patients to repeat. Adding something positive at the end creates a more positive impression of the experience. After doing so, there is a smaller probability the patient is unwilling to receive the treatment a second time. Then, patients can more effectively recover with a less total cost and shorter time.\nA negative end.\nInversely, a negative end ruins the memory of an experience even though everything before was perfect.If a person wants themselves or other people to do something less, adding a negative end to the experience helps.\nReflect on our own experiences.\nPeople's memories of their experiences are not what they experienced. So, relying on our memories to make decisions does not lead to the highest net pleasure. To experience the net largest amount of pleasure, people should spend as much time as possible on things that they are unwilling to stop doing.\nRestrictions and criticisms.\nStudies found that other factors influence the peak-end rule. Firstly, the expectation. A high expectation is compared with the actual experience at the start. If a difference exists, the starting experience will be the most important factor in overall experience evaluation. The peak-end rule is more likely to be applicable to lower expectation situations. Secondly, one study finds that the effect of peak-end law is small on one day experiences. Moreover, some people are easily affected by the rule but others are not. Thirdly, according to and Carmon, how we feel at the moment of evaluation also affects the outcome."}

It is to prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. The principle is prominent in economics.\nThe principle of loss aversion was first proposed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in 1979. Loss aversion happens when people face the same amount of gains and losses and find the loss is more unbearable. In other words, the pain of loss is greater than the pleasure of equal gain. In some experiments, it shows females have a higher level of loss aversion than males. \nAffective Science and Neural basis.\nThe cause of loss aversion lies in people's asymmetric emotional response to gain and loss. Studies show that this asymmetry is particularly strong during the anticipation processing and the immediate experience after presenting the outcome. One study of income and well-being indicates that when people make loss-averse choices, it is not directly due to the loss itself but because the impact brings a series of negative consequences that follow the loss.A classic example presented in the book \"Thinking, Fast and Slow\" of a flipping coin implies that people will first compare the satisfaction of gaining with the pain of losing before making a decision. Thus, most people would not choose to participate in coin gambling with 50% to get $150 and 50% to lose $100; and according to the \"loss aversion ratio,\" the minimum amount to fulfil the pain of losing $100 will be $200 (assume the coefficient is 2).\nIn 2001, J. O' Doherty and his colleagues had found that humans process losses and gains in qualitatively different ways by using brain imaging technology and suggests the correlation between the magnitude of brain activation and the extent of reward and losses received.When we are evaluating potential gains, the areas of the brain that process value and reward become more active than it does when assessing the potential losses. The different loss aversion levels differ from individuals by the degrees of sensitivity to losses and gains, in which people are more loss-averse with stronger sensitivity.\nSupports.\nEquity premium puzzle.\nEquity premium puzzle(EPP) refers to the problem of why there is a big difference between returns in stocks and risk-free investments historically. Since stocks are much riskier than government bonds, the underinvestment in stocks relative to bonds supports the idea of loss aversion theory. Specifically, it's the myopic loss aversion introduced by Shlomo Benartzi and Richard Thaler, which indicates the behavioural characteristics of \"loss aversion\" and \"frequent evaluations\" of investors. Benartzi and Thaler argue that loss-averse investors are more willing to take risks if they do not evaluate the performance of their investments frequently. In their model, investors are unwilling to accept return variability and tend to take a short-term view of their wealth.\nDemand elasticity.\nDemand is more elastic for price increases than price decreases, based on the assumption that the price increase is a loss while the price decrease is a gain for consumers.\nDaniel Kahneman's contributions.\nProspect theory.\nBased on the principle of loss aversion, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Twersky developed prospect theory to explain how consumers make decisions in uncertain situations. Unlike the hypothesis of rational man use in economics, prospect theory reveals the irrational psychological factors that affect the choice behaviour. Most people are unwilling to take risks when facing gains but become risk-seeking in losses.\nEndowment effect.\nLoss aversion theory explains the endowment effect. The endowment effect refers to the finding that once an individual owns a good, he/she tends to naturally place more value than he did before he didn't own it. Due to the asymmetric responses to losses and gains in the decision-making process, the consideration of \"loss avoidance\" is far greater than that of \"gain seeking,\" so people value more on a good they own.\nReal world applications: Marketing Strategy.\nBy using the loss aversion theory as a marketing strategy, firms are able to gain higher profits by changing consumers' behaviours.

It is used in power plants, to convert a water flow into a movement of a wheel (and then into energy). Lester Alan Pelton invented it in the 1870s. In a regular wheel for example of a mill, the energy is obtained from the weight of the water. A pelton wheel uses the impulse of the water to generate energy, not its weight. Pelton wheels are used in power plants where there's a big difference in height, but where there is relatively little water. An example might be a dam or barrage in the mountains. One of the drawbacks of a pelton wheel is the relatively hight level of wear: Unlike the Francis turbine, a pelton wheel cannot be used to pump water."}

Shortly after its start, \"Novy Chas\" was stopped to be printed. The newspaper was warned by the government of Belarus at the end of 2007. In June 2010, the paper was also warned by the Ministry of Information. Then it was took away from stores run by the government.\nIt has been writing about the 2020 Belarusian protests and 2020 Belarusian presidential election, so several journalists of \"Novy Chas\" have been tried and arrested for that.\nSince February 2021, the newspaper is taken away from stores run by the government again.\nOn May 28, 2021, the Deputy Prosecutor General of Belarus Maksim Voronin made a warning to the editor-in-chief of \"Novy Chas\". The official did not like three stories printed in the newspaper in February and April 2021. The warning was written in Russian and had some citations from these Belarusian stories. Their translation from the Belarusian language into the Russian language was wrong, though. On June 7, 2021, Belposhta (Belpost (), Belarusian postal service) said no to making an agreement on using its subscription services for the second half of 2021 to the office of \"Novy Chas\".\nOn August 10, 2021, it became known that there will be no newspaper in the print form after August 12. The private printing house \"Roll Print\" wrote a letter about it on July 27. The printing house ran into troubles in the process of printing, so it became not possible to stick to the agreement on printing, it said. \"Novy Chas\" tried to find a new printing house but did not make it. \"Novy Chas\" promised that its website and social network services would be kept going.\nOn October 19\u201320, 2021, the \"Novy Chas\" office and the houses of its journalist were looked for. The people were interrogated. Computers and other things were taken away. The European Federation of Journalists, the International Federation of Journalists, the Belarusian Association of Journalists said bad words on that.\nOn October 28, 2021, the domain name of \"Novy Chas\" novychas.by was stopped working in Belarus and other countries of the world. As a result, its journalists had to make another website of \"Novy Chas\". It is novychas.online."}

This is done because it gives a better picture quality for viewers, lets more channels be broadcast in one area, and is cheaper to run. In some places, digital cable, satellite, or internet protocol television replaced analog television instead of DTT.\nThis started happening in around 2000 when DTT began being used in many countries. It takes a long time to do, because older television sets could not receive DTT signals, and needed either a new television or a set-top box. During this time, broadcasters keep an analog signal broadcasting until enough people have switched to digital. Berlin was the first city to turn off all analog TV signals on 3 August 2003.

{"id": "822370", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=822370", "title": "Hedonic adaptation", "text": "Hedonic adaptation is the idea that humans get used to good and bad events over time. \nGood and bad events change happiness in the moment, but people get used to them. This is called adaptation. Because of adaptation, happiness usually stays the same over time. \nHedonic adaptation is also called the hedonic treadmill. Looking for good events will only make a person adapt to them, leading them to want more. \nOrigins.\nHedonic adaption was developed in 1971. Scientists found that lottery winners were not happier than those who did not win. Also, those who could not walk were not much less happy than those who could. \nNewer studies show the same. For example, a 15-year-long study shows that married people in Germany were much more happy after marriage, but only for a short period of time. By the second year, their happiness was the same as before they got married. \nThese studies show that it may not be possible to increase happiness for a long period of time. \nMechanisms.\nHedonic adaptation contains two important ideas. First, how people feel about an event depends on how they feel before it happened. This means that good events make people happy in the moment. But over time, because they are already happy, their happiness does not change. Second, happiness usually returns to a point that stays the same. This is how people get used to events over time. \nScientists thought that happiness returns to a neutral point: where a person is not happy nor sad. However, new studies show that most people are happy most of the time. So, happiness returns to a point where the person is happy. This point is different for everyone. How happy a person is may depend on personality: how a person usually acts and feels. This can come from their parents. \nHedonic adaptation comes from cognitive changes: changes in how a person thinks. These changes are what a person likes and wants, and what they do and do not think about. Thinking about an event less is the main way adaptation happens. \nHedonic adaptation also comes from neurochemical changes: changes in the brain that make good and bad feelings less strong. \nHowever, people do not get used to all events. Most studies show that people usually adapt to good events quickly and completely. Their happiness returns to exactly where it was before the event soon after the it happens. However, some strong or long-lasting bad events, such as losing a job or partner, result in less adaptation. Happiness may not completely return to its point before the event. In some situations, it may decrease. \nFunctions.\nProtection.\nFrom an evolutionary position, hedonic adaptation is useful. It helps control the effects of bad events. It makes bad events less strong. This protects people from difficult situations and helps them survive in the present. \nSome effects of bad events are helpful. They tell us what is important. For example, hunger, thirst and pain. Other effects can be dangerous. Long periods of fear and worry for example, can harm the body and the mind, leading to disease and illness. \nHedonic adaptation is a part of the \u201cpsychological immune system\u201d. It protects people from dangers to their health. This often happens unconsciously, without the person knowing. \nPerception.\nHedonic adaptation can change the way people see their situation. As bad events become less strong, people are more likely to make changes to better the situation. \nFor example, the death of a partner can make people very sad. They see no way to make the situation better. However, adaptation helps people see what can be changed. They may try to prevent a similar event from happening. This helps people learn from past events to survive in the present. \nApplications.\nTreadmill effect.\nGood events make people happy in the moment. But not for long. People look for other things to stay happy. People get used to them too. This treadmill effect means that the more a person gets, the more they want. This makes staying happy hard. \nQuality of decision-making.\nA person who is not used to an event often thinks it is more important than it really is. For example, healthy people think unhealthy people are less happy than they really are. People who are not used an event can think jobs, marriage, and where they live will affect their happiness more than it really will. \nMoral values.\nBeing used to an event may change what people think is right and wrong. For example, people in the Milgram experiment were asked to harm another person multiple times. Each time was more harmful than the last. When people become used to harming others, they may no longer think that it is wrong. \nPrevention.\nThere are ways to prevent hedonic adaptation. For example, the Hedonic Adaptation Prevention Model (HAP) says that variety and appreciation can make happiness last. \nVariety is when happiness comes at a surprise even after the event has happened. The surprise makes getting used to the event difficult. This keeps happiness high. It also stops people from wanting more. \nAppreciation is when a person is happy with what they have. They know that they may lose it. This is the opposite of adaptation. By being appreciative, people are reminded of the good event. Thinking about it makes happiness continue. \nGiving something up and getting it back can also prevent hedonic adaptation and make happiness last. \nCritical views.\nAreas of Happiness.\nHedonic adaptation says that happiness returns to a single point. However, happiness comes from many things. Change in one area of happiness, such as at work, does not always mean change in another area of happiness, such as in marriage. Different areas of happiness can change in different ways and at different times. The point where happiness returns to after an event may be different depending on which area of happiness is affected. \nHappiness can Change.\nHedonic adaptation says it may not be possible to increase happiness for a long period of time. People will always get used to good events. However, a 17-year-long study found that 24% of people said their happiness changed a lot between the first and last five years. \nAnother study found that differences in happiness can be explained by how much freedom or money countries have. They last for a long time. The difference in happiness shows that people do not completely adapt to some events. For example, a study shows that people adapt to money, but not status: how others see them. "}

{"id": "822398", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=822398", "title": "Conformity", "text": "Conformity is when someone changes their behaviour to match that of other people.\nIt can happen for personal and social reasons. Personally, people conform because they have expectations for themselves. They might believe that behaving a certain way will help them reach a goal. Conformity can also happen because of other people\u2019s influence. People will conform to be liked or to be a part of a group. \nConformity happens in different levels. Furthermore, the reasons that someone conforms for and what they hope to get out of it, are often linked. Growing up, children learn by copying the behaviours of others. They rely on other\u2019s opinions to be true or on their behaviour to be appropriate. Furthermore, the size of the group matters when conforming.\nPeople conform for normative and informational reasons. Additionally, there is a difference between compliance, identification and internalization. \nThere is much research on conformity. Two of the most famous conformity experiments are those by Sherif (1935) and by Asch (1955). \nImportant Studies.\nSherif (1935).\nSherif (1935) studied how people behave in an unclear situation. In his experiment, participants guessed how far a small point of light on a black screen is moving. This point of light didn\u2019t actually move. It was an optical illusion. First, the participants had to make guesses on their own. Then, they were put into groups of three. There, they changed their answers to fit those of the other two participants better. The researchers made sure that two participants with rather high guesses were put together with a participant with a rather low guess. After, this participant changed his answer to be more similar to the ones of the others. The researchers suggested that this is a sign for conformity. Afterwards, the participants had to make a guess on their own again. There, the answers of their group members from before influenced them, because their guesses were similar to what they had guessed in the group situation. Because of the unclear situation, participants looked at what others were doing. Therefore, they changed their answers to conform to the group.\nResearchers criticised Sherif\u2019s study. Because participants had to guess the movement of a point of light that was not actually moving. This meant that there was no right or wrong answer. Being so unsure maybe made participants to conform. \nAsch (1955).\nAsch (1955) wanted to find out if people conformed to other people even if the answer to a question was clear. In his experiment, he showed participants an image of a line. At the same time, he showed them another image with three lines of different lengths. The participants had to choose which line was the same length as the \u201cstandard\u201d one, in the first image. \nA control trial showed the task was rather easy. There, the participants made almost no mistakes in matching the correct lines. However, in the main part of the experiment, all except for one participant were confederates. This means that the researcher had told them how to behave during the experiment. They were told to give wrong answers to see how the other participant reacts. The other participant, however, believed that everyone else was also a participant like him. \nThe confederates and the participants formed groups of 7 to 9 students. Furthermore, they were asked to match the correct lines 12 times (12 trials). Three-fourths of participants gave the same, wrong answer as the confederates in at least one trial. All in all, participants conformed to the others on an average of 36.8% of the time. These results suggest that more than 3 out of 10 times, the participant was not giving the correct answer, probably in order to conform. \nTypes.\nNormative and Informational.\nDeutsch and Gerard (1955) found that people conform for normative and informational reasons.\nNormative social influence is when someone changes their behaviour to meet expectations. These can be their own expectations for themselves or the expectations others have for them. The influence will be bigger between people in a group than between two people, for example. Furthermore, the normative influence is smaller when someone feels that there is no need for them to conform. Additionally, not conforming to these expectations can make someone feel scared or guilty. For example, a small child might laugh with their family even if they cannot understand the joke yet. \nInformational social influence is when someone accepts information from others as the truth. The more unsure someone is, the more likely they are to consider other\u2019s opinions as right. For example, a child might accept whatever new information it is taught by their parents as the truth. \nThese two types of conformity can work together. In Asch\u2019s (1955) experiment, for example, a participant might be confused because his answer is different from the confederates\u2019 answers. He might feel like he has to normatively conform to the group so that he will not be the only one to stand out. Moreover, he might usually trust his eyes, but this time ask himself if there might be something wrong with his vision. This might lead him to conform to the others informationally because he accepts their answers as right and does not want to be wrong. \nCompliance, Identification and Internalization.\nKelman et al (1958) found different three forms of conformity.\nCompliance is when someone conforms because they hope for a positive reaction from others. The person changes their behaviour not necessarily because they agree with it. As a consequence, people who comply might only conform when certain people are present. In sum, compliance is conforming to others \u201con the outside\u201d, while maybe not agreeing with them \u201con the inside\u201d. They do it with the hope of a social effect. For example, a child might sit still during a church service to comply and meet its family\u2019s expectations. In reality, the child might prefer playing outside with the other kids. \nIdentification is when someone changes their behaviour because they want to make their relationship to another person our group better. They conform in situations that are important for the relationship. For example, someone might change their behaviour whenever their older cousin visits. \nInternalization is when someone changes their behaviour because of the content of the behaviour they conform to. They already agree with the values the behaviour stands for and maybe even find it practical. People conform whenever suitable. They do not care who is present or whether it is needed to conform. For example, when someone cares for nature with internalization, they might never leave plastic waste anywhere, no matter who is watching them or where in nature they are. "}

It is a story of the two stepsisters, Sandrembi, the elder and Chaisra, the younger, born to the same father but from different mothers. The protagonist is Sandrembi, a young lady, living in forsaken environment, that are changed into a remarkable fortune.\nShe is considered to be a person having the nature of God like mind.\nThe folk legend is considered a perfect combination of the \"Cinderella\" and the \"The Three Oranges\".\nStory.\nIn the Haya Chak Era, when King Sentreng Apanba reigned in Antique Kangleipak (Ancient Manipur), he had a nobleman named Khulen Nganba who had two wives, the senior named Yangkhuleima (Yangkhureima, Yaibireima or Yaipileima) and the junior named Sangkhuleima (Sankhureima). By the grace of God, the elder one had a daughter named Sandrembi (Sanarembi) (\"and also boy\" in another version) and the younger one had only one daughter named Chaisra (Cheisra). The father died after sometime. The two widows used to go to market for selling vegetables and go to Shilempat (Shilem lake) to catch fish for livelihood. Sangkhuleima, the younger widow always thought of ways to harm Yangkhuleima, the elder one. One day, it so happened that Yangkhuleima (the elder) caught all types of fish but Sangkhuleima (the younger) caught some snakes and reptiles and not a single fish. Both of them took rest under a fig tree. She grew envious of the fate of the elder one and climbed up the fig tree for plucking the fruits. Once or twice she dropped the fig fruits to the elder one who partook of the juice. At last, the latter was made to close her eyes and open her mouth to swallow the most delicious fruit. Then she poured the snakes from her fish basket. The poor woman swallowed them and died on account of snake bite. Sangkhuleima came down and pushed the dead body of Yangkhuleima into the deep water of the lake. It got transformed into a tortoise (or turtle). Everybody was shocked to hear from Sangkhuleima, the younger co-wife, about news of the tragic death of Yangkhuleima, the elder widow by drowning. In another version of the story, Sangkhuleima told others that stubborn Yangkhuleima didn't want to return home and insisted on staying to catch fish until sunset.\nThe younger widow and her daughter Chaisra (Cheisra) began to maltreat lovely Sandrembi (Shanarembi). One night, Yangkhuleima appeared in the dream of her daughter, Sandrembi, and revealed the crime committed by the stepmother. She further instructed Sandrembi to bring her (tortoise form) from the lake and keep her in a pitcher for five days without any break so that she may re-assume human form. Sandrembi did so but before the completion of the five days, Chaisra, the younger step sister, got the knowledge of the tortoise and so, she pretended to be ill in her bed. When Yangkhuleima, her mother came to her, she said that tortoise meat would cure her. \"Get that tortoise which Sandrembi had caught from the lake. Boil it for cooking.\" The stepmother forced poor Sandrembi to boil the tortoise. Sandrembi tried to take away the fuel stick (on hearing the tortoise mother's words from the boiling pan/pot) but she could not save her mother (tortoise) before them.\nChaisra and her mother devoured the tortoise meat to their heart's content and threw away the bones in the verandah. Again Yangkhuleima, the tortoise mother told Sandrembi in her dream to keep the bones of tortoise in a basket after covering it by a piece of cloth and it must not be opened for 7 days. Sandrembi did so. However, before the completion of the said period, out of her anxiety as well as curiosity, she opened the basket and thereby disturbing the normal process of coming to human shape. The tortoise mother assumed the shape of a sparrow and flew away. Both stepsisters grew up in course of time. Sandrembi, the elder, was beautiful and accomplished but not nicely dressed up. Chaisra, the younger, was ugly although properly dressed. Once the King (\"Crown Prince\" in another version) went for hunting with a large retinue, horses and elephants. The king saw the two maidens by a riverside. Realising the quality of Sandrembi, the elder, the king made her the chief Queen after a ceremonial marriage. She spent her life with her brother in a joyous mood. A son was also born to her, the boy was named Machi Sana Melei Khomba in Meitei Manipuri sacred lores. Sangkhuleima, the stepmother and Chaisra, the step sister gnashed their teeth in anger and were planning to kill the Queen. They invited her for a dinner in their house. Sandrembi came\nto her stepmother's house with permission of the King. After the dinner, Chaisra, the younger, out of jealousy, dropped the Queen's dress under a bed (\"in a hole\" in another version). When Sandrembi went down to bring it up, the wicked stepmother poured the hottest water over Queen Sandrembi's body. Poor Queen got transformed into a pigeon and flew away. Chaisra, in the Queen's dress, went to the palace and behaved as if she was the real queen. The suspected king told her in anger, \"You are not my queen whose face is as fair as the lily. You are disfigured.\" Chaisra replied that she contracted mental and physical agony when she wept for her son. The king again continued, \"You are not my queen for your nose is too long, your eyes are very deep and the hairs of the eyelids are bushy.\" Chaisra replied, \"I missed you so much, I cried rubbing my eyes all the way.\" In spite of his suspicion, the King wanted suitable opportunity in order to detect the false queen. In the meantime, the pigeon flew into the Royal Garden, perched on a tree branch and addressed to the Royal Gardener (\"grass cutter\" in another version) concerning the forgetfulness of the King about Queen Sandrembi, animal epidemic, grievances of the Prince and loss of his own sickle along with a warning for reporting these words to the king. The king on getting the report went in search of the pigeon with grains of paddy in his hands. The King kept the supernatural bird in his palace. Even as a bird, she took away the dirty things from the Prince's eyes. Chaisra killed the bird with a stick and prepared a nice meal for the King. The king refused to taste the flesh of the pet bird and threw it away and buried it behind the Royal Kitchen. But it was the age of the truth and there grew a lucious fruit plant and it bore full of fruits overnight (\"only one fruit\" in another version). A big lucious fruit also came from the plant. Chaisra, the false queen gave the lucious fruit as a gift to a monk (\"servant\" in another version). The man kept the fruit in a jar in his house since the same was not yet ripe enough to be eaten. Later it so happened to him that fruit disappeared when the knife was available and vice versa. Early next morning, he went out for work. Returning home, he was surprised to find that his cottage had been washed and the meal cooked. He kept the mystery concealed for some days and was determined to solve it by all means. Long before the first streak of day light came, he got up and had gone some distance secretly in the darkness and entered the cottage silently and peeped into his own room. At Sunrise, he saw a beautiful woman coming out of the jar and roaming in kitchen for house work. \"It is a fruit maiden\", he muttered. Recognising her as the Queen, he took her to the king. There was a quarrel between Sandrembi and Chaisra, the two step sisters on the issue of the identity of the real Queen. The obstinate Chaisra denied the whole story and called Sandrembi to be a \"fruit maiden\".\nAt long last, the king decided to settle the case by appealing to a divine ordeal. The two had to fight a duel with swords. As per the code, the defendant was allowed to use a bright and sharp sword but the plaintiff (Sandrembi) had to use a rusty knife (\"wooden knife\" in another version) for on her part laid the burden of proof. It was thought that if justice was really on her, she would win inspite of using a rusty sword. Chaisra had no belief in the trial by ordeal and was hopeful that she would be able to kill her rival with one stroke. Her demand for use of the bright sword was a legitimate one. The blunt and rusty sword (or \"wooden sword\") was given to Sandrembi for she had to prove her own case. Sandrembi, the elder had the faith in her, \"If I am innocent, may Chaisra's sword become harmless to me.\" In the arena, while Chaisra hewed and hacked at her with the sword, Sandrembi remained unhurt. Suddenly, the blunt sword of its own accord, slipped out of Sandrembi's hand and chopped off Chaisra's neck. In another version of the story, there was no fighting between them. Sandrembi, the elder pardoned Chaisra, the younger. Both of them lived together as chief queen and younger queen respectively in great happiness."}

This role is already alluded to in Zoroastrian scripture (e.g. \"Yasht\" 19, \"Vendidad\" 2), where the figure appears as Yima(-Kshaeta)\n\"Jamshid\" (Jamshed, Jamshyd) and as a short pronunciation Jam remains a common Iranian and Zoroastrian male name that is also popular in surrounding areas of Iran and middle east.\nEtymology.\nThe name \"Jamshid\" is originally a compound of two parts, \"Jam\" and \"shid\", corresponding to the Avestan names \"Yima\" and \"X\u0161a\u0113ta\", \"*X\u0161aitah\" meant \"bright, shining\" or \"radiant\". The modern Turkish name \"Cem\" is derived from Persian \"Jam\". also the word Ajam is derived from the word Jam. acording to the book Documents on the Persian Gulf's name the Persian \"jam\" is the root of Arabic \"Ajam\", assuming that this Arabic word for the Persian-speaking population was derived from a Persian endonym, meaning the people of Jam. \nIn scripture.\nSource:\nYima rules as king for three hundred years, and soon the earth was full of men, flocks of birds and herds of animals. He deprived the \"daevas\", who were demonic servants of the evil Ahriman, of wealth, herds and reputation during his reign. Good men, however, lived lives of plenty, and were neither sick nor aged. Father and son walked together, each appearing no older than fifteen. Ahura Mazda visits him once more, warning him of this overpopulation. Yima, shining with light, faced southwards and pressed the golden seal against the earth and boring into it with the poniard, says \"O Spenta Armaiti, kindly open asunder and stretch thyself afar, to bear flocks and herds and men.\"\nIn tradition and folklore.\nOver time, the Avestan hero \"Yima X\u0161a\u0113ta\" became the world-ruling Sh\u0101h \"Jamshid\" of Persian legend and mythology.\nAccording to the \"Sh\u0101hn\u0101ma\" of the poet Firdaus\u012b, Jamshid was the fourth king of the world. He had command over all the angels and demons of the world, and was both king and high priest of Hormozd . He was responsible for a great many inventions that made life more secure for his people: the manufacture of armor and weapons, the weaving and dyeing of clothes of linen, silk and wool, the building of houses of brick, the mining of jewels and precious metals, the making of perfumes and wine, the art of medicine, the navigation of the waters of the world in sailing ships. \nJamshid had now become the greatest monarch the world had ever known. Jamshid was said to have had a magical seven-ringed cup, the \"J\u0101m-e Jam\" which was filled with the elixir of immortality and allowed him to observe the universe.\nJamshid's capital was erroneously believed to be at the site of the ruins of Persepolis, which for centuries (down to 1620 CE) was called \"Takht-i Jamsh\u0113d\", the \"Throne of Jamshid\".\nHowever, Persepolis was actually the capital of the Achaemenid kings and was destroyed by Alexander. Similarly, the sculptured tombs of the Achaemenids and S\u0101s\u0101nians near Persepolis were believed to be images of the legendary hero Rostam, and so were called \"Naqsh-e Rustam\".\nLegend of the discovery of wine.\nKing Jamshid is featured prominently in one apocryphal tale associated with the history of wine and its discovery."}

It does not dry, and comes in many different colours.\nPlasticine is used for children's play and for modelling more formal or permanent structures. \nBecause of its non-drying property, it is a good material for stop-motion animation. It has been used for several Oscar-winning films by Aardman Animations (Nick Park). The brand-name clay is sometimes mentioned in British music, such as the \"plasticine porters\" in The Beatles' \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\", the Oasis songs \"Little James\" and \"Shakermaker\", the Placebo song \"Plasticine\", and the Thom Yorke song \"Plasticine Figures\".\nIndustrial history.\nPlasticine was invented in Bath, England in 1897 by an art teacher, William Harbutt. In 1983 production was moved to Thailand. Several attempts have been made to change the formula to evade the patent and its licences. There are a number of similar products, but none has proved more successful. There is, however, a good market for epoxy products which set hard after being applied as a liquid or putty. Plasticine does not set hard.\nPlasticine is about 65% gypsum, 10% petroleum jelly, 5% lime, 10% lanolin and 10% stearic acid. It cannot be hardened by firing, melts when exposed to heat, and is flammable at higher temperatures."}

They have been used to find solutions in linear programming and quadratic programming problems. Interior point methods can be used when the solution is a convex set. The problem can then be restated as minimizing or maximizing a linear function over this set of solutions. They are called \"interior\" point methods, because they approximate the convex set from the inside. Interior point methods are often used because they have a better runtime behavior than the algorithms commonly used with linear programming. Because the sequence of values will converge towards a barrier, they are also known as barrier methods. "}
