Some Chinese legends say people started binding women's feet as early as the Shang dynasty (1700\u20131027 BCE). However, writing says that foot binding began at the court of the Song dynasty (960\u20131279 CE). It lasted until the early 20th century, when it was banned by the People's Republic of China. \nFoot binding was a sign of social status. If a woman's feet were bound, it was a sign that she was a higher-class woman who did not have to do hard work. However, foot binding slowly spread to the lower classes who wanted to try and get a higher social status. By the 17th century, Chinese girls of all social statuses had their feet bound. \nSome people think that Chinese women were forced to bind their feet in order to help their husbands feel sexual pleasure. Some people also see foot binding as insulting to women. But other people argue that this view is biased against the Chinese culture in favor of modern Western standards.\nFoot binding usually tried to make the feet about long, at most. Some drastic things were done at times to try to do this. Because of this, women who had their feet bound would usually be impaired, or damaged, for the rest of their lives. The physical consequences (or results) of foot binding stayed in Chinese society until very recently, especially for women in their 70s and 80s (according to a study published by the University of San Francisco}.\nWhen the Manchuria created the Qing dynasty, the Manchurian emperors wrote many laws banning foot binding. However, the laws did not work very well. In 1874, the first anti-footbinding committee (meeting of people) was held in Shanghai by a British priest. After the collapse of the Qing dynasty, the republican government kept trying to stop foot binding. They gave fines (orders to pay money) to women who still had their feet bound after 1915. During the early 20th century, western fashion was affecting China more and more. The People's Republic of China eventually outlawed foot binding, although this was not very successful in actually ending the practice. According to Xinhua News Agency, the last factory to make shoes for bound-feet women stopped making those shoes in 1998, in Harbin, China."}

Over his career, Young wrote 45 books, including novels and non-fiction for adult and youth audiences.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Cypress River, Manitoba, Young grew up in nearby Glenboro, Manitoba, where his father, Percy Andrew Young, owned a drug store. His mother was Jean Ferguson Paterson. After his father went broke in 1926, the family moved to Winnipeg, but were unable to afford to stay there. His parents separated in 1930, and he went to live with an aunt and uncle in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, for a year before moving back to Winnipeg to live with his mother. He left high school at 16 and began working for a tobacco wholesaler.\nYoung began writing while in his teens, submitting stories to various publications, most of which were rejected. At the age of 18, in 1936, he was hired as a copyboy at the Winnipeg Free Press and was soon made sports reporter. He met Edna Blow \"Rassy\" Ragland in 1937 and the two were married in 1940.\nMoves to Toronto.\nUnable to get a raise at the \"Free Press\", Young moved to Toronto in 1941, covering news and sports for the Canadian Press news agency. His first son, Bob Young, was born in 1942 and five months later, Young was sent to England to help cover World War II for CP. He came back a year later and joined the Royal Canadian Navy, where he served until his release from the service when the war ended in 1945. Young returned to CP and soon joined \"Maclean's\" magazine as an assistant editor. His second son, Neil Young, was born in Toronto in November 1945.\nYoung began to sell fiction to publications in Canada and the United States including the \"Saturday Evening Post\" and \"Collier's\". He quit his job at \"Maclean's\" in 1948 to write short stories full-time.\nIn 1949, Young bought a house in Omemee, Ontario, near Peterborough. The family's finances would vary with Young's success in selling his stories and he began taking assignments from \"Sports Illustrated.\" His first novel \"The Flood\" was published in 1956. Young moved to Pickering, Ontario and spent a year working in public relations for a jet engine company before joining \"The Globe and Mail\" as a daily columnist in 1957 and moving back to Toronto. In 1959, Young met Astrid Mead while on assignment in British Columbia and, soon after, he and his wife separated. Following Young's divorce in 1961, he and Mead were married. They had a daughter, Astrid Young, in 1962.\nHe was also a host on Hockey Night in Canada until getting on the wrong side of Toronto Maple Leafs co-owner John Bassett. The Leafs threatened HNIC's sponsor and advertising agency until they agreed to fire Young.\nLife on the farm.\nIn 1967, Young bought a farm near Omemee in Cavan Township and built a house there. In 1969, he asked to be transferred to the \"Globe\"'s news bureau in Ottawa. Shortly after arriving in Ottawa, he got into a dispute with his paper over the publication rights to excerpts from a book he had just written with Punch Imlach. The rights had been acquired by the \"Toronto Telegram\", but the \"Globe\" wouldn't allow Young's writing to appear in a competing newspaper. He quit the \"Globe\" and accepted a job offer from Bassett to become sports editor and columnist at the \"Telegram\", moving back to Toronto within weeks of his move to Ottawa. Young remained at the \"Telegram\" until the paper folded in 1971. He then rejoined the \"Globe and Mail\". Young and his second wife separated in 1976, and in the fall of 1977, he moved in with fellow \"Globe\" writer Margaret Hogan. The two married in 1980. At the same time, Young had a falling out with the \"Globe\" over stories critical of Imlach written by Donald Ramsay and quit. He worked with former Toronto Maple Leafs owner Conn Smythe on Smythe's autobiography, which would be published after Smythe's death in November 1980.\nIn 1988, Young received the Elmer Ferguson Memorial Award from the Hockey Hall of Fame as selected by the Professional Hockey Writers' Association, and was also inducted into the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame. Young and his wife sold the farm in the late 1980s and moved to Howth, Ireland, a suburb of North Dublin. In 1990, Young received an honorary doctorate from Trent University and donated many of his papers to the university's archives. The Youngs returned to Omemee in 1992 and repurchased their old farm, which Young owned for the rest of his life. Scott Young Public School in Omemee was named in his honour in 1993. His autobiography, \"A Writer's Life\", was published in 1994.\nHe and Margaret moved to Kingston, Ontario, in 2004, where he died the following year at the age of 87."}

{"id": "185978", "revid": "1025654", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=185978", "title": "Waxing", "text": "Waxing is a method of removing hair from the body. Waxing removes the whole hair including the root. Both men and women engage in waxing, as do female children as young as eight. Any area of the body can be waxed but the more common areas are the legs, underarms, genitals, torso and face. There are health concerns about waxing such as pain, inflammation, infection and physical damage to the skin. At least two women have been hospitalized due to bikini waxing. The waxing of young girls has been criticized and concerns over emotional problems have been raised by parents and by doctors and psychologists. Although it is known as \"waxing\" not all treatments of this kind use wax. Some waxing treatments use a sugar mixture in the same manner as wax. \nTypes of waxing.\nAny area of the body where hair grows can be waxed. The most commonly waxed areas are;\nHistory.\nWomen in Ancient Egypt removed unwanted hair with a sticky mixture of honey and oil. Women in the Middle East have used a sugaring mixture which is made up of a paste of warm sugar, lemon juice, and water. In 1922 Sears started selling razors to women and the ability for them to remove unwanted hair began. Pubic hair removal began during World War II when the US government ordered less material to be used in making women's bathing suits and the bikini was invented, causing some women to have hair stick out the sides of the bikini bottom. In the 1960s, waxing products became available.\nA sphinx wax or Brazilian wax is a type of hair removal. When sphynxing or doing a Brazilian wax, all the pubic hair is removed. Sphynxing has many health benefits. One of the benefits of sphynxing is when someone has dermatophytes. Full hair removal when sphynxing can also help to avoid jock itch. Another benefit of sphynxing is that it usually involves individuals with experience. Some men have advocated there should be equal access to sphinxing services for men.\nConcerns.\nHealth concerns.\nWaxing rips the hair out of the skin and often causes pain. The pain increases in areas such as the genitals, especially for people who have not waxed before or do not wax often. Redness and swelling also often occurs at the waxing site. Waxing is itself a safe thing, but there are times when it is not safe to get waxed. When skin is sunburned, it is not good to get a wax treatment. Allegic reactions can also happen with waxing. People with medical problems such as diabetes, chronic kidney or liver disease, skin conditions such as eczema or psoriasis, or weakened immune systems are advised not to get wax treatments at all. At least one woman, with diabetes, almost died due to getting a bikini wax and becoming infected and another woman was hospitalised after being waxed in her genital area. In 2007 the New Jersey State Board of Cosmetology and Hairstyling came close to banning genital waxing based on health concerns. There is also concern about the trend to remove all or most of the pubic hair from a person's genitals. Dr. Linda K. Franks, assistant clinical professor of dermatology at the New York University School of Medicine, says \"Pubic hair is there for a reason\u2014to protect the sensitive skin and mucous membranes in the genital region, getting a wax literally strips away that layer of protection.\" Waxing can pull small pieces of skin off the body. This is usually minor and is not usual. Skin infections can also occur such as staph, folliculitis (infection of the hair follicles). Ingrown hairs are also quite common and can become infected.\nWaxing of children.\nYoung children also get waxing treatment with children as young as eight receiving wax treatments such as eyebrows, legs and genital waxing. Such genital waxing on young girls has been called \"virgin bikini\" waxes, and is aimed at either reducing the girl's need for pubic hair removal in the future or stopping hair growth permanently with as few as five or six treatments as long as the child has never shaved before. The increase in demand for preteen waxing is being met by spas, with some 10,000 spas in offering services only for young girls and early teenagers in the United States of America alone. The International Spa Association has reported that 16% of teens who have had spa treatments have had waxing done. The association has not been able to give figures for younger children because it is illegal to survey them. \nBoth parents and children say that young girls feel pressure from television shows and other children to look pretty and sexy and say that peer pressure, magazines, pop stars like Britney Spears and TV shows like Miley Cyrus' Hannah Montana increase children's demands to have spa treatments such as waxing, microdermabrasion and chemical peels. Such pressure has been reported to cause intense stress and emotional problems in young girls. The opinions of boys about girl's beauty is also a pressure to look their best with reports of boys rating girls on a scale of 1 to 10 at school.\nDr. Diane Levin, professor of education at Wheelock College in Boston and co-author of the book \"So Sexy So Soon: The New Sexualized Childhood and What Parents Can Do to Protect Their Kids\" (a book critical of the sexualization of children), believes child waxing to be bad because it tells girls to \u201ckeep your bodies like little girls\u2019 because that\u2019s what men like.\u201d This is backed up with surveys that show that 93% of men want women to, at least, remove some hair from their pubic area. Dr. Doris Pastor, a pediatrician, feels that the problem is not whether young children get wax treatments but that such events might encourage young children and preteens to take part in risky behaviour. Pubic hair waxing of children has caused concern with doctors. Dr. Janice Hillman, of the Penn Health System, a specialist in adolescent medicine, when checking for pubic hair on young girls as a sign of development has said she often has to ask the girls if they wax because it has become so common.\nConcern has also been raised by the cost of such treatments, making regular waxing often only available to children with well paid parents, leaving girls from poorer families unable to compete for beauty and so being made fun off by those who can afford them."}

The Gita has also been translated into Marathi language by him with the name as Geetai means mother Geeta.[2]\nThere are a lot of accomplishments he made. The most famous thing is \"Budan\", which is an idea of sharing lands with the poor. He argued that land is not something that can be occupied. He insisted that land owners should donate their one sixth of their land to people who do not have land. He campaigned to give rice to hungry people. And he also did a campaign of self-supporting and self-sufficient. These worked successfully and he became a great man of India."}

They are 22% of Kenya's population and are of Bantu ethnicity.\nHistory.\nThere are two theories explaining where the Kikuyu came from. First, it is believed the Kikuyus came from Central Africa, where all the Bantus once lived. They then moved south towards present day Tanzania where the migrating group separated again and the Kikuyus moved towards Mount Kenya, where they settled. The second theory is that they came from a mythical place called Shungwaya, which is present day Somalia. \nAccording to Kikuyu creation stories, Ngai (their God) made a man, called Gikuyu, and his wife, Mumbi, and settled them on Mount Kenya. Gikuyu and Mumbi had nine daughters who form the major groups of the Kikuyu people. Due to the fertile soil on Mount Kenya and the hard work of the Kikuyu people, they grew more than they needed and started trading with their neighbours, the Maasai (a Nilotic tribe). The Kikuyus swapped their farm produce and crops for the animal products from the Maasai, who kept livestock. It is also believed that the Maasai are the ones who married the nine daughters of Gikuyu and Mumbi.\nKikuyu language.\nMembers of the Kikuyu tribe speak the Kikuyu language. The Kikuyu greeting is \"Wi mwega?\" which means \"Are you fine?\". There are a few Kikuyu dialects depending on region. Kikuyus from Nyeri, for instance, have other forms of greeting including: \"Wakia Maitu\" greeting an elderly female, \"Wakia Awa\" greeting an elderly male, and \"Wanyua\" for agemates.\nThe Kikuyu language is also similar to other languages like Meru, Mbeere, and Embu which are believed to have been once part of the Kikuyu tribe but moved away and formed their own tribes. Even though English and Kiswahili are the main languages spoken in Kenya across tribes, the Kikuyu language is still spoken a lot today as a sense of cultural pride.\nFamous Kikuyu people.\nFamous people from this tribe include: Jomo Kenyatta (the first president of Kenya), Mwai Kibaki (the third president of Kenya), Uhuru Kenyatta (current president) and Wangari Maathai (the first African female Nobel Peace Prize winner.)"}

The main ingredient (or stuff) is thin sliced beef, and it is simmered in a skillet or pan in the sukiyaki sauce with many vegetables and other ingredients. The word \"yaki\" means \"sautee\" or \"grill\" in Japanese. The word is used because the beef in sukiyaki is sauteed in the hot skillet.\nHistory.\nIn Japan, because of religious beliefs people were forbidden to eat beef, venison, horse, mutton and other meat from Asuka era to Meizi era. issue of religion. Cattle and horse were also work animals, therefore if people eat cattle and horse meat, people were punished. This custom was publicly decided by the then emperor on April 1, 675. But it is said that the real intention of this custom was to raise cultivation of rice product. This is a commandment (or rule) of Buddhism. But difficulty in making a living meant that people secretly ate boar and venison meat. Over time people ate beef secretly. \nThe first sukiyaki store opened in Kyoto at the last days of the Tokugawa Shogunate. The Meiji emperor ate beef. He liked taste of sukiyaki. After that, the emperor lifted the ban on eating beef. People were allowed to eat beef publicly. In the west it is called \u201cSukiyaki\u201d, in the east it is called \u201cGyunabe\u201d. It is popular all over Japan. Sukiyaki\u2019s contents do not change now. It is thinly sliced beef cooked in an iron pot, with bean curd, sliced onion, mushroom and other kinds of seasoning. Then the beef and vegetables are picked directly from the pan by chopstick and eaten by dipping them into a small bowl containing raw egg. Sukiyaki became symbol of cultural enlightenment. \nPreparation.\nEach Japanese region has a preferred way of cooking sukiyaki. Japan can be divided into two regions. The big variation is between \"Kansai\" (western Japan) and \"Kanto\" (eastern Japan). In the Kanto (Tokyo) region, sukiyaki is based on \"Gyunabe\" that was in fashion in \"Meiji\" period. Before cooking sukiyaki, people prepare the soup stock mixing a seasonings (soy sauce, sugar, \"sake\" and \"mirin\") together. They then stew beef in it.\nIn the \"Kansai\" region, people grill meat in the pan greased with lard. After that, they put the other ingredients over these, and the liquid is poured into the pan. They do not grill meat and the ingredients that make the meat tough, and they do not grill the meat and watery vegetables at a same time. This is the\" Kansai\" style of cooking sukiyaki.\nThe border between the styles of cooking sukiyaki is becoming unclear. Some people say that the border between eastern and western is in Aichi. But recently, ready-made stock, pre-mixed with seasoning used to flavor sukiyaki is sold all over Japan, so the border is no longer clear."}

His paintings are very realistic and often portray heroes from Ancient Greece and Rome.

That night San Francisco went through unusually low temperatures, and Epperson awoke the next morning to find a frozen pop that would eventually become a favorite American snack.\nAt first, Epperson named his frozen snack the \"Epsicle\", and it became popular with his school friends. In 1923, while running a lemonade stand at an amusement park in Oakland, California, Epperson realized that he could earn money from his invention. Epperson changed the name of his treat to \"Popsicle\", after his children always asked for \"Pop\u2019s \u2019sicle\", and signed up for a patent. The patent for frozen ice on a stick was issued August 19, 1924.\nAround 1925, Epperson sold the popsicle rights to the brand name Popsicle to the Joe Lowe Company in New York. By 1928, Epperson had earned royalties on more than 60 million Popsicle ice pops."}

Barbirolli was particularly remembered as the conductor of the Hall\u00e9 Orchestra, Manchester, which he conducted for nearly thirty years, turning it into a world famous orchestra. He was conductor of other great orchestras including the New York Philharmonic and the Houston Symphony, and also conducted orchestras including the London Symphony Orchestra, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the Berlin Philharmonic, and the Vienna Philharmonic. He often played the music of English composers such as Edward Elgar and Ralph Vaughan Williams.\nLife.\nEarly years.\nBarbirolli was born into a musical family. His father and grandfather had come from Italy and moved to London. His mother was French. His father and uncle were violinists.\nBarbirolli won a scholarship to study at Trinity College of Music, and later studied at the Royal Academy of Music. In 1916 he joined the Queen\u2019s Hall Orchestra where he was the youngest member. The next year he gave his first solo recital. He spent two years in the army where he got conducting experience with a voluntary orchestra. In 1919 he was again playing in orchestras and twice appeared as soloist with the Bournemouth Municipal Orchestra.\nBetween 1929 and 1933 he conducted opera at Covent Garden. From 1933 to 1936 he conducted the Scottish Orchestra in Glasgow.\nIn 1927 he took over a concert that Thomas Beecham would have conducted with the London Symphony Orchestra. He conducted other English orchestras including the Hall\u00e9 Orchestra and was becoming very well known. He could learn music very quickly. In the 1930s he made many recordings with the London Symphony Orchestra and London Philharmonic, accompanying concertos with famous soloists such as Fritz Kreisler, Jascha Heifetz and Arthur Rubinstein.\nInternational career.\nIn 1937 Barbirolli was invited to take over from Arturo Toscanini as conductor of the New York Philharmonic. To follow such a great conductor was a very great honour. He conducted there for five years with great success, although there were some critics who supported Toscanini and were always criticizing Barbirolli. It was a difficult time for him as a new orchestra had just been formed in New York, the NBC Symphony Orchestra which was conducted by Toscanini and they paid their musicians more money. When he was invited, in 1942, to stay on with the New York Philharmonic he decided not to, partly because he would have to become a US citizen.\nHall\u00e9 Orchestra.\nThe Hall\u00e9 Orchestra, based in Manchester, England, had been famous under the conductor Hamilton Harty. However, in recent years they had been sharing half their players with the BBC. This had saved the orchestra in the difficult years when the economy was bad and during the early war years, but the orchestra was not as good as it had been. Barbirolli was invited to become the conductor of the orchestra, so he moved back to England in 1943.\nThe first thing he had to do was to rebuild the orchestra. It had not had a permanent conductor since 1933 when Hamilton Harty left. Only four of the shared players with the BBC chose to join the Hall\u00e9 in Manchester, so Barbirolli auditioned many musicians. The \u201cnew Hall\u00e9\u201d made several recordings including symphonies by Arnold Bax and Vaughan Williams.\nBarbirolli conducted the orchestra for 25 years. In 1958 he became \u201cconductor-in-chief\u201d, so that he could share the work with others. In 1968 he was given the title \u201cconductor laureate\u201d for the rest of his life.\nAs well as his work with the Hall\u00e9 he conducted the BBC Symphony Orchestra and other London orchestras, and made many recordings. From 1961 to 1967 he was also principal conductor of the Houston Symphony Orchestra in Texas. He was also made guest conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic.\nDuring his last years he had serious health problems His last two concerts were held in the St Nicholas Chapel, King's Lynn, as part of its 1970 Festival. Although he collapsed during the Friday afternoon, he managed to conduct Elgar's \"Symphony No 1\" and \"Sea Pictures\". The last piece he conducted was Beethoven's \"Symphony No 7\" on the Saturday before his death.\nHis reputation.\nBarbirolli is remembered for his great interpretations of Romantic music and of early 20th century English music. He was not interested in very modern music although he did conduct Benjamin Britten\u2019s \"Violin Concerto\" and \"Sinfonia da Requiem\" in New York. He is remembered for his performances of Elgar, Ralph Vaughan Williams and Gustav Mahler, as well as Franz Schubert, Beethoven, Jean Sibelius, Giuseppe Verdi and Giacomo Puccini. Vaughan Williams gave him the nickname \u201cGlorious John\u201d. He was a great supporter and friend of the great cellist Jacqueline du Pr\u00e9.\nHe was knighted in 1949 and made a Companion of Honour in 1969.\nFamily.\nHis first marriage was to singer Marjorie Parry. His second marriage from 1939 to his death was to the British oboist Evelyn Rothwell who died at the age of 97 in January 2008."}

He is an important character in the manga due to the fact that the story basically revolves around Naruto, the main character, and Sasuke, Naruto's rival. Sasuke is a very popular character, there have been many polls that prove this. Merchandise based on Sasuke has also been released, ranging widely from action figures to plush dolls and even to his ninja equipment. Sasuke has also appeared in Naruto related video games and OVAs.\nBackground.\nSasuke is a member of the Uchiha Clan, one of the strongest clans of the village of Konoha (Also known as the hidden leaf village). When Sasuke was a little boy, he saw his older brother kill their parents. Itachi Uchiha, Sasuke\u2019s older brother, told Sasuke that he also killed all of the other clan members to see if he was a strong ninja but that he will save Sasuke\u2019s life because it was not even worth killing. From then on, Sasuke lived a lonely life full of hatred and destined to walk a path of an \u201cAvatar of Revenge\u201d and kill his brother. However, these feelings seemed to be alleviated when he befriended Naruto Uzumaki after graduating Ninja Academy. As they were working together in a team as \u201cGenin\" (which means rookie ninja), Naruto showed him what friendship and companionship were.\nThis ended with Sasuke's encounter with his brother. After battling Itachi, Sasuke realized that he lacked both the strength and intelligence to kill him. Later Sasuke leaves Naruto and Konoha to go to Orochimaru, one of the main antagonists of the series, to learn advanced ninja techniques and to be trained as a stronger ninja. Through mastering \u201cLevel Two of the Cursed Seal,\u201d a restricted ninja technique, Sasuke obtains extraordinary power, thanks to is former master. Eventually, Sasuke defeats and kills his older brother only to find out that the order to massacre the Uchiha Clan was made by the elders of Konoha because the clan was destroying the peace of the entire village. However, Itachi could not kill his little brother because he loved Sasuke too much. In order for Sasuke to become able to protect himself, Itachi told Sasuke to live a life of anger and revenge which would stimulate Sasuke\u2019s progress and allow him to become a strong ninja. After hearing about his brother, Sasuke turns his anger toward Konoha and decides to destroy the village.\nNaruto is a weekly cartoon and has not ended even to this day. The adventures of Sasuke continue. The story now focuses on the reunion of the two rivals, Naruto and Sasuke. The two friends' goals conflict in that Naruto wants to protect Konoha, whereas, Sasuke plans to destroy it."}

In the case of islands far from the mainland, EEZ starts at the coasts of the islands. Normally, EEZ goes out to 200 nautical miles (370\u00a0km), unless EEZs of two or more countries overlap. Many EEZs actually overlap; countries argue over where their outermost boundaries of EEZ should be. EEZ is prescribed by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).\nIt is different from territorial waters in that ships and submarines from other countries can freely travel without any permission. However, this is under the condition that they are just passing by and not taking any resources. These zones were invented in the middle 20th century."}

Until 2020, Castroneves raced for Team Penske in the IndyCar Series. He has won the Indy 500 four times. Castroneves won \"Dancing with the Stars\" in 2007 with his partner Julianne Hough. Castroneves drove for Team Penske since he entered the Indycar series in the late 1990s. Even though he has many race wins, Castroneves has never won an IndyCar Series championship. Castroneves lives in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\nRacing Career.\nCastroneves was born and raised in Brazil and was successful in karting there. He moved to Europe to keep racing and was a top driver in British Formula 3, which many racing experts say is a \"stepping stone\" to a career in a higher series such as F1 or IndyCar. He began racing in the United States in what was then the CART series in the late 1990s and struggled at first. However, in 2000, he got a big break when Team Penske signed him after Greg Moore, who the team originally wanted to drive for them, died in a racing accident in 1999. He joined the team in 2000 and has remained there ever since. In 2001, he won the Indianapolis 500, one of the most important events in the racing world. At the event, he famously climbed the protective fence at the side of the track. The following year he won again in a very controversial finish where it wasn't clear whether Castroneves or rival Paul Tracy had won. Castroneves was declared the winner, but many people believe Tracy was the rightful winner. Tracy has not gotten along with Castroneves since then and has called him a \"two time winner\", leaving out his 2002 win. Castroneves has always been a top driver and finished second in IndyCar Series points in 2008. The following year he won the Indy 500 for a third time. In 2009, the IRS charged Castroneves with tax evasion. After a trial, Castroneves was acquitted by a jury."}

They are Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung, Deoksugung, Changgyunggung, and Gyeonghuigung. The five grand palaces were not built at the same time. Changdeokgung was built as the secondary palace next to Gyeongbokgung. The construction began by King Taejong, the Third King of the Joseon Dynasty, in 1405. Taking 7 years to complete, it was finished in the year 1412.\nThe word Changdeokgung means 'the palace of prospering virtue'. Because of the meaning of the name of the palace, the kings of Joseon Dynasty chose mostly Changdeokgung to live in.\nThe palace had been the home of 14 kings of Joseon Dynasty until it was totally destroyed by the Japanese army in the year 1592. After the Japanese were driven back by the combined forces of Korea and China, Changdeokgung was rebuilt in 1612. After the reconstruction, the palace had suffered little damage and became the primary royal court of the Joseon Dynasty. This was because Gyeongbokgung was also destroyed by the Japanese but the Joseon Dynasty did not rebuild it for some reason and the Changdeokgung became the biggest palace in Korea.\nHowever, Changdeokgung had suffered some damage for 350 years after the reconstruction. As a result, a large scale restoration took palace from 1990 to 1999. This restoration shows how much the Korean people loved Changdeokgung. Apparently, the UNESCO saw its value as well. Seeing Changdeokgung as a vital global asset, UNESCO listed it as a World Cultural Heritage. The UNESCO said that Changdukgung 'was outstanding example of Far Eastern palace architecture and garden design'.\nChangdeokgung is in a park in Seoul, the capital city of South Korea. There are total of 13 buildings remaining in all and the area is designated as Historical Site No. 122. Tourists from all around the world visit this historic site. Changdeokgung is also an enjoyable park for families to spend their weekends."}

As a child he loved to take things apart and put them back together. He was very good at building mechanical things. He built his first moving toy at the age of 13. His father had to hide the family car from him because he liked to take apart and re-build the motor. To keep him away from the family car, his father gave him an old car that didn't work. Joseph-Armand fixed the motor, and put it on old sleds and created the first snow vehicle.\nWhen he was 17 years old he convinced his father to let him quit college and become a mechanic. He continued to study mechanics and electrical engineering at night school.\nInventions.\nHis first patent was for a sprocket wheel and track system in 1937. This system would help him to make the first snowmobile the B7. These first snowmobiles were used by doctors, veterinarians, innkeepers and funeral directors to get around in the winter. Bombardier went on to design bigger snowmobiles that would carry up to 12 people.\nDuring the War, he made snowmobiles and armoured tracked vehicles for the Canadian Government. \n Because of this, his company began to grow. In the 1970s, it began making airplanes and trains and became the large multi-national corporation now called Bombardier Inc.\nHe is a member of the Canadian Science and Engineering Hall of Fame."}

Since it does not require any public utilities such as gas, electricity, water or sewage it can be considered as an off-the-grid housing, meaning that it can live away from public utilities.\nAn Earthship does not require external support to sustain itself. Instead, it is built to use resources available from its natural surroundings. For example, windows are placed so that sunlight is shone inside the house to be used for heating. Electricity is generated by solar panels and stored in batteries. The roofing collects rainwater that is filtered and used for drinking and various household activities such as cooking and washing. Used water from sinks and showers is reused to water indoor plants and after that for toilet flushing.\nEarthships can adapt to different climates and are being build worldwide. In North- and South America, the Carribeans, Asia, Africa and Europe.

Many of its dancers have been trained in ballet, and modern dance companies are rather similar to ballet companies. Here the word \"modern\" is not used to mean \"recent\". Modern dance is over a century old, having begun (in this sense) around 1900.\nThe phrase 'modern dance' is also applied to ballroom dance of the English (now 'International') style. However, this page uses \"Modern dance\" as a term to describe 20th century concert dance, on stage. The modern dance style does not have set rules. Modern dancers often create their own dance routines using their emotions and moods but, on the other hand, many performances are choreographed.\nAlso modern dancing does not require specific costumes. So modern dancers often dance barefoot and choose whatever they want to wear. Modern dancers try to show their innermost emotions through dancing, often trying to get closer to their inner-selves. Modern dance has evolved continually. Artistic content has changed and shifted from one choreographer to another, as have styles and techniques.\nHistory.\nModern dance was developed in the 20th century, mainly in the United States and Germany. In the early 1900s, several female dancers began rebelling against the strict rules of classical ballet.\nThe pioneers of modern dance in the United States were Isadora Duncan, Loie Fuller, Ruth St. Denis and Martha Graham. The pioneers of Germany were Rudolf Von Laban and Mary Wigman."}

When people jump they wear safety equipment like helmets and a harness.\nHistory.\nIt started as the coming-of-age ceremony in a small village on South Pentecost Island in Vanuatu. The young men jump from the top of a 30 meter high tree to demonstrate their courage as an adult. They tied jungle vines around their ankles so that they would not hit the ground.And from then it started to become a sport in which people take part and it was named bungee jumping .\nModern bungee jumping.\nModern bungee jumping began when four British men jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. In 1987 A.J.Hackett became world famous when he jumped from the Eiffel Tower in Paris. Later he set up the Kawarau Bridge in New Zealand, with a height of 47 meters, as a commercial bungee jumping area. People could pay money for the fun of jumping. The idea quickly spread around the world.\nSafety.\nBungee jumping has several dangers. The rope has to be the right size for your weight, or it may break. The safety harness has to fit properly or the force of the drop could cause a person's bones to break. The rope has to be the right length or a person could hit the ground before being stopped by the rope. "}

It is one of the most important annual events in Japan. \"Osechi\" food is packed in colorful lacquer boxes called \"jubako\". Each dish and ingredient in \"osechi\" has a meaning, such as good health, fertility, good harvest, happiness, long life, and so on. The kind of \"osechi\" foods eaten in Japanese homes varies from area to area. It is a Japanese tradition to eat \"osechi\" dishes during the New Year's holidays which go from January 1 to January 3.\nStories.\nOne year there was not much food. People did not have enough rice to cook in their rice cooker. Emperor Nintoku knew about this and it worried him a lot. He said that he would lower the taxes in years when people did not have enough rice for New Years Day. After that the taxes were lowered but the House of Emperor Nintoku became poor. Japanese people celebrated this custom on New Years Day. \"Osechi-ryori\" is a dish that is cooked before New Year's Eve to eat on New Years Day.\nOn New Years Day, the God of the Year, named \"Toshigami\" comes to the world and the world starts a new year. The god came through a special gate, a \"Kadomatsu\", into our world. He is god of agriculture. In Japan when agriculture was the main activity of life, people welcomed \"Toshigami\" and hoped for a rich harvest. A special decoration, a \"shimekazari\" was put up to welcome the god. Another decoration, a \"wakazari\", was put up to make sure that nothing would go wrong during the next year. \"Osechi\" is a meal to give to \"Toshigami\". In Japan people gave the first part of the crop to god. The rest of the celebration was a feast, called \"naorai\".\nHistory.\nThe beginning of \"osechi\" starts in the \"Yayoi\" period. This went from 1000 BC to 300 AD. People at that time were starting to grow rice. As part of a harvest festival, called \"Sekku\", people made food gifts to please the gods. \"Sekku\" foods are eaten to thank the gods for the blessing of nature, a good harvest and big catch. This is the beginning of \"osechi\". This idea came from China.\nIn the \"Heian\" period, from 710 to 1185, this event became more common in Japan as the influence of China became more important. There were five seasonal festival days or \"sekku\", January 7 (\"Jinjitsu\" or \"Nanakusa no sekku\"), March 3 (\"Joshi\" or \"Momo no sekku\"), 5 May (\"Tango\" or \"Shobu no sekku\"), 7 July (T\"anabata no sekku\") and 9 September (\"Choyo\" or \"Kiku no sekku\"). An offering table was set up for the gods. The foods offered to the gods were dry foods, not processed for people to eat. Modern \"osechi\" comes from the Edo period (1603\u20141867). These days many Japanese people buy their \"osechi\" in shops instead of making it at home.\nTypes of osechi.\nThere are many different \"osechi\" foods, and each has a special meaning. The shape, the color, and the name of each food has a meaning which might bring good luck, happiness or long life. One type of \"osechi\" is made from black soybean and herring roe. Black is a color which brings youth and long life. The name of the black soybean means that people can live a long life without sickness. Herring roe symbolizes the prosperity of descendants, because there is a lot of roe in each piece.\nChestnuts are rolled into an omelet mixed with fish paste and steamed fish paste Chestnut means a mass of gold and it represents the wish that people get ahead in business and become rich person. A rolled mixed with fish paste mean the culture and diligence because it is a symbol or a scroll from the meaning of dressing up. And red steamed fish paste means removing evil and white means a pure mind. Kelp is a symbol of congratulation and longevity and is auspicious food endowed happiness."}

He is the god who judges whether the souls of people go to heaven or hell. \nHistory.\nEnma is the god of hell who judges right and wrong after a human dies and falls into hell. Enma gives many kinds of dreadful punishments. The word \"Enma\" comes from \"Yama\" in Sanskrit and Pali, a language for Buddhist writings in Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Thailand. He is said to be a human ancestor in the \"Rigveda\" (an ancient Indian sacred book). He is a god of the Indian Veda myth and he is said to be the incarnation of the \"Jizo Bosatsu\", the stone statue which is the god of help in Japanese Buddhism. \nBelievers in Buddhism think Enma comes from the start of the world. He was linked with death at first. People thought he was king of paradise for the dead, the god who ruled people when they lived in heaven. People thought he tied up souls of the people with the rope that he held in the hand. He became a feared god. Then he was treated as just the god of death. Because he is also an incarnation of the god of help, it is said that he can come and go freely between heaven and hell.\nAppearance.\nThe appearance of Enma usually frightening in nature. Enma is always shown wearing Chinese traditional clothes from the Sung era (AD 960\u20131279). Why he wears Chinese traditional clothes is unknown. Usually, his dress and face are both red. He has a square crown on his head and a mace in his right hand. His eyes are open wide and angry, and are slanted upwards. \nHowever in other countries and at different times in history, Enma is pictured differently. For example, in old pictures from India, Enma has a crown and is riding a water buffalo. He has a club and a big rope. Another Enma from ancient India has a flag and steps on water buffalo with one leg. Enma is well built, with thick arms and a very big chest.\nHis job.\nEnma was the first person in the world to die. He went to paradise, called \"Gokuraku Jyoudo\" (\u6975\u697d\u6d44\u571f). He lived in paradise and his job was looking after the dead. People believed Enma was the god of paradise. Over time people became scared of Enma. His job was changed from looking after the dead to judging them. Enma used a club and a big rope to tie up the souls of dead people. He ruled the lower world and judged the dead. He decided if a dead person went to heaven or hell. He made his judgment on what they had done in their lives. People who had behaved well went to heaven. People who had behaved badly go to hell.\nStories.\nThe stories about Enma are very mysterious. The most famous story is how Enma will pull someone\u2019s tongue out if they did a bad thing. Japanese parents teach their children to be honest by using this story. Enma can also bring dead people back to life. \"Abe-no-seimei\", a famous person in Japanese history, died and was revived by Enma. He also can decide when life should end. \nOne of the strangest stories involves an actor who died and met Enma. The actor went to hell because he played other people \u2013 in other words \"lying\". He told Enma all about himself his life and Enma started to be interested in his acting. He said \u201cI would like to see you act.\u201d The actor agreed and said \"I need a costume, so please give me yours.\" Enma gave it to him and the actor played as Enma, saying \"Ogres! Ogres! Take this bad man away!\" Enma was taken away and punished. The actor became a new Enma instead of the real Enma.\nBooks and movies.\nThere are a number of books and movies about Enma in Japan and even in other countries. Enma has been written about by many Japanese novelists. \"The First Love of Enma, Bungeisya\", by Hideo Watanabe, is about escaping from hell and falling in love with a beautiful dead woman along the way. Another side of Enma is shown in \"Enma\u2019s sword, Syodensya and Hiraiwa\" by Koshihiro Igawa and \"The Worship of Enma\" by Yumie. Enma is not fearful or strong at all. In comic books, like \"Dragon Ball \", Enma is shown as kind and calm. Enma in \"Ojarumaru\" is funny. In the American movie called \"Heaven Can Wait\" (1943), a dead man talked with Enma about his whole life before his death. This Enma is not kind but strict. This movie was nominated for best picture. Enma has also appeared in One Piece as the name of the sword wielded by Kozuki Oden who passed it onto his daughter Kozuki Hiyori, who then entrusted it to Roronoa Zoro as a replacement for his Shusui. Some writers write about his power and the fear he causes and others write about his opposite side, kind, and calm.\nOther websites.\nEnma. Yahoo encyclopedia.

{"id": "186473", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=186473", "title": "Futon", "text": "Futons are traditional Japanese bedding. A futon is a padded mattress, called a \"shikibuton\", a quilt, called a \"kakebuton\", and a pillow filled with beans, called a \"makura\". The futon was put on the floor at night for sleeping. They could be easily rolled up during the day when they were not needed. The word \"futon\" has come to mean a lot more than this. Although many Japanese people sleep in a bed, they say \"I sleep on futon\"; it means to go to bed. Futon now means things that Japanese people sleep on, including beds.\nTypes of futon.\nMany companies make futons, and there are many kinds of futons. Futons are made from chemical fibers like polyester, natural fibers like cotton, feather, down and wool. Japanese quilts usually contain feathers and Japanese mattress usually contain wool.\nThe Japanese quilt can keep in heat and moisture, depending on what it is made from. Usually, a futon that includes over 50% hemp or cotton is called a \"Menfuton\". This is popular all over the world. Futons made from down are called quilt down. This retains heat, so this is a high-class futon. Futons made from feathers are called comforters. This is cheap and is common around the world. Futons made from chemical fibers are called chemical fiber futons. This is cheap so this is popular. Futons made from wool are called \"Yomo futon\". These are warm.\nIn winter, people generally use \"Hadafuton\" like a blanket to keep warm. In summer, people generally use \"Towelket\" like a big towel or Seer quilt which are cooler.\nFutons are generally used with a futon cover, because these make it easy to keep the futon clean. People generally use futons so they can sleep comfortably, stay warm and support their bodies while asleep. People usually sweat during sleep, so futons absorb sweat and collect moisture. Futons have to be hung out in sunlight to keep them dry, this is called \"futon-hoshi\". If this is not done, ticks and mold could grow on the futon and it will become dirty and insanitary. Futons need to be looked after properly.\nHistory.\nIn the 13th century, most people slept on straw mats, but the nobles slept on \"tatami\". These were not as soft as futons are now. It was said that they were hard and uncomfortable. For a very long time, people covered themselves with their clothes to keep warm. Most people slept nude. Rich people never did such things.\nIn the 17th century, bedclothes were made. People made it by stuffing cloth with cotton and wool. These bedclothes are the original form of the futon.\nIn the 18th century, futon production started because there was more domestic cotton available. At that time, futons were too expensive to buy for average people. They could cost 1,200,000 yen. Futons were important gifts and many men gave them to women in order to seduce them. Prostitutes were sometimes presented with futons by rich men. Prostitutes could be ranked by counting the futons; the higher ranks of prostitutes received more futons.\nIn those days, futon meant a mattress, not a quilt. Bedclothes were common. In the Kansai area, they used a square thing like a blanket, a \"fusuma\". The quilt is said to have evolved long before it.\nIn the 19th century, most people were able to buy futons. The import of the raw cotton began, and many factories were built. Because of industrial development, making futons was easier and more efficient than before. This made the price become down and people were able to afford them.\nModern futons.\nThe manufacturer \"Nishikawa\" is the most famous. This company is in Kyoto and Tokyo. They make everything for the futons, for example, pillows, sheets, and quilts. This brand has history of 440 years.\nIn old days, people thought any futon was good as long as they could sleep. But now people want better futons. Today, people like a futon which they can relax on and recover from fatigue. Futon makers have developed futons that can adjust to the human body. This is called \"Seiatsu Futon\" in Japan. There is some advantages to this new type of futon. Since ventilation is good, they are cool in summer and warm in winter. Since it can adjust to ideal posture when you sleep, it improves blood circulation while sleeping. And they are easy to look after. Also a futon of \"low repulsion\" is popular among Japanese people. This is said to fit the body of the user. Some users who are troubled by bedbugs on futon like \"tick guard\" futons."}

Ji became famous for his saying \u201cIf you have money, non-guilty. If you don't have money, guilty.\u201d The phrase criticized social and income inequality of the 1980s Korean society. Also, it raised the issue of \u201cPreventive Custody Policy,\u201d which separated prisoners from the society for a while even after their prison term was over in a preventative approach to potential crimes.\nThe Escape.\nOn October 8, 1988, 12 prisoners from Youngdeungpo Prison escaped into Seoul city during their transfer to Kongju Prison. Although they were known to Koreans as cruel and inhumane criminals, they were actually accused of robbery and other small crimes. They escaped because they were enraged by the idea of \u201cPreventive Custody Policy,\u201d and that trials were conducted unfairly to the poor. Their prison term for stealing 5,000,000 won was longer than that of Jun Kyung Hwan, brother of the former Korean president, who had embezzled approximately 60,000,000,000 won.\nAmong the 12 escapees, 4 out of 5 managed to stay unarrested until the very end. They are Ji Kang Hun (35 years old), An Kwang Sul (22), Kang Young Il (21), and Han E-Chul (20). They moved in search of shelters from houses to houses in Seoul. On October 15th, they smuggled into Ko\u2019s house in Seodaemungu Bukjakadong and took hostage of his family. This hostage taking was broadcasted live on television. Ko managed to sneak out from the house at 4:00 AM in the morning and informed the police. The house was surrounded immediately by more than 1000 police force. The standoff between the escapees and the police started from 4:40 AM. At about 12:00 PM, Kang Young Il came out of the house in an effort to negotiate with the police. He tried to get back to the house, but was stopped by Ji who shot a gun before Kang\u2019s feet. Ji stated that this was his last gift to Kang. Then, two of other escapees, An Kwang Sul and Han E-Chul committed suicide in the other room. Ji asked the police for a cassette tape, Holiday by Beegees. He shouted out to the reporters, policemen, and those who were at the scene, \u201cIf you have money, non-guilty. If you don't have money, guilty.\u201d He tried to kill himself by stabbing his throat with a piece of glass that he had shattered from the window while listening to Holiday. During the process of rescuing the hostages, Ji was shot two times by the Special Squad in the house. He died the same day at the hospital for excessive loss of blood.\nInfluence.\nTo this day, the phrase \u201cIf you have money, non-guilty. If you don\u2019t have money, guilty\u201d is used to criticize politicians or elites in corporations who get away with bribery and embezzlement. \nA movie based on his escape, \u201cHoliday,\u201d was made in Korea in 2006. The title was named after a song by Beegees, which Ji Kang Hun asked for at the hostage taking scene"}

She is most famous for performing the song \"Izlel je Delyo hajdutin\", which was sent to space on board the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 probes in 1977.\nValya Balkanska was born in a hamlet consisting of seven houses near the village of Arda in the Rhodope Mountains. Since her childhood years she has been singing Rhodopean folk songs, which she learned from her mother and grandmother, as well as at work-bee parties. In 1960 she became the main soloist of the \"Rhodopa\" State Ensemble for Folk Songs and Dances. She was only 18 years old at that time. Up to this day Balkanska has performed more than 300 folk songs, having been accompanied by the bagpipe player Petar Yanev for the last 14 years.\nThe most important moment in Balkanska's career came with the folk song \"Izlel je Delyo hajdutin\", which she recorded together with the bagpiper Dimitar Petkovski. In 1972 it became part of the Voyager Golden Record, a collection of songs, sounds and images from our planet, which also contains works of famous composers such as Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, and Stravinsky. NASA put copies of the record in the \"Voyager 1\" and \"Voyager 2\" space probes and launched them on August 20, 1977. According to Carl Sagan, one of the creators of the Voyager Golden Record, only advanced alien civilizations would be able to play it. \nIn 2004 Balkanska released an album called \"Glas ot vechnostta (Voice from the Eternity)\", comprising some of her most popular songs such as \"A bre yunache ludo i mlado, Goro le goro zelena\", and \"Maychinko stara maychinko\".\nRecognition.\nBalkanska received numerous awards throughout her career as a folk music singer. One of her favourite recognitions is a golden statuette from the Art Olympiad in Los Angeles in 1997. In 2002 the Bulgarian president honoured her with a \"Stara Planina\" medal, considered the highest national award. In the same year she also received the \"Golden Lyre\" award by the Union of Bulgarian Musicians and Dancers. Balkanska became an awardee of the \"Golden Phenomenon\" prize for helping the popularization of Bulgarian folk music and culture and for the same reason she was the first Bulgarian to be honoured by UNESCO as a \"citizen of the planet\".\nAccording to \"Time Magazine\" she is one of the people symbolizing the future of Europe, stating that apart from being \"a legend in her own country, Valya Balkanska is very much a legend in space, too\". Since December 2005 she has her own star plate on the Bulgarian Walk of Fame. In 2005 Balkanska was also one of the nominees for the \"St. Paisiy Hilendarski\" national award for notable artists and performers. In May 2009 the Bulgarian Association of Regional Media chose her as \"The Most Exceptional Bulgarian Woman\". \nIn 2008 \"Standard\", a Bulgarian daily newspaper, conducted a survey on what Bulgarians consider as their most important symbol of national pride. Nearly 22 thousand readers of \"Standard\"'s online edition from more than 10 countries around the world took part in the poll. Among the 23 possible choices, Valya Balkanska came in first with 9.46% of the votes. She ranked higher than the inventor of the computer John Atanasoff, the world record holder in the women's high jump Stefka Kostadinova, and even the declaration of independence of Bulgaria in 1908.

Among many gurus who brought forms of yoga to the West, he is one of the most notable. He freely invented yogic and tantric practices, characteristics of Neo-Hinduism that began to emerge in the 1870s. His international following has continued after his death. Rajneesh was born Chandra Mohan Jain; he was known as the Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh during the 1970s and 1980s, and finally as Osho in the last year of his life.\nEarly life.\nHe was born in a small village in the Gadarwara town of Narsinghpur District of Madhya Pradesh state in north India. He spent most of his childhood with his maternal grandparents, which he later mentioned as \"the blessing in his life\" for its carefree environment.\nHe entered college at his age of nineteen. Asked by the principal to leave the college, he transferred to D.N. Jain College and completed his B.A. in philosophy in 1955. After obtaining his M.A. in philosophy in University of Sagar in 1957, he started teaching at Raipur Sanskrit College and became a professor at Govt. \"Mahakaushal Mahavidyalaya, Pachpedhi, Jabalpur affiliated to Jabalpur University in 1960 now known as Rani Durgavati vishwavidyalaya. While teaching at colleges, he became known as a public speaker. He resided in a rented house on Garha Road leading from Ranital Crossing to Garha sub-town around 1957-59 period in a simple house and did all his routine work by himself. In those days he used to meditate in Bhawar Tal Park of Jabalpur City under the \"Maulshri\" tree which is still preserved and known as \"Osho Tree\" in the Park. (based on personal knowledge as a student of Mahakaushal College (now Govt, College of Arts &amp; Science) 1956-60.\" \nAcademic.\nAs a professor of philosophy, he traveled throughout India in the 1960s as a public speaker. He was a critic of socialism, Mahatma Gandhi, and other stalwarts of Indian politics, including institutionalised religions. He advocated a more open attitude towards sexuality: so the press called him a \"sex guru\". In 1970, he settled for a time in Bombay initiating disciples, known as neo-sannyasins, and expanded his spiritual teaching and work. In his discourses, he reinterpreted writings of religious traditions, mystics, and philosophers from around the world. Moving to Poona in 1974, he established an ashram that attracted increasing numbers of Westerners.\nAshrams.\nPoona.\nThe Poona ashram was by all accounts an exciting and intense place to be, with an emotionally charged, madhouse-carnival atmosphere. The day began at 6:00\u00a0a.m. with Dynamic Meditation. From 8:00\u00a0a.m., Rajneesh gave a 60- to 90-minute spontaneous lecture in the ashram's \"Buddha Hall\" auditorium, commenting on religious writings or answering questions from visitors and disciples. Until 1981, lecture series held in Hindi alternated with series held in English. During the day, various meditations and therapies took place, whose intensity was ascribed to the spiritual energy of Rajneesh's \"buddhafield\". In evening \"darshans\", Osho conversed with individual disciples or visitors and initiated disciples (\"gave sannyas\").\nThe ashram offered therapies derived from the Human Potential Movement to its Western audience and made news in India and abroad, chiefly because of its permissive climate and Osho's provocative lectures. By the end of the 1970s, there were mounting tensions with the Indian government and the surrounding society.\nA situation rose when Rajneesh entered a three-and-a-half-year period of self-imposed public silence on 10 April 1981. He occupied himself with \"satsangs\"\u2014silent sitting with music and readings from spiritual works, and gave no discourses. Around the same time, Ma Anand Sheela replaced Ma Yoga Laxmi as Rajneesh's secretary.\nOregon.\nLater in 1981 Rajneesh moved to the United States, and his followers established a community, later known as Rajneeshpuram, in the state of Oregon. Within a year, the leadership of the commune became embroiled in a conflict with local residents, primarily over land use, which was marked by hostility on both sides. Rajneesh lived in a trailer next to a covered swimming pool and other amenities. He did not lecture and only saw most of the residents when, daily, he would slowly drive past them as they stood by the road. He gained public notoriety for the many Rolls-Royces bought for his use, eventually numbering 93 vehicles. This made him the largest single owner of the cars in the world.\nInfluence of Ma Anand Sheela.\nMa Anand Sheela (born Sheela Ambatal Patel, 28 December 1949) was Rajneesh's personal secretary from 1981 to 1985. On 10 July 1981, she purchased the Big Muddy Ranch to create the Rajneeshpuram, Oregon commune. She was the main manager and spokesperson. She carried a .357 Magnum handgun, and created a Rajneeshpuram police force armed with Uzi submachine guns and a Jeep-mounted .30-calibre machinegun. It was under Sheela's influence that Rajneesh decided to travel to the United States and begin an ashram there.\nWhile at Rajneeshpuram, Rajneesh depended on Sheela to manage the organisation. She was seen as Rajneesh's principal aide, and as second-in-command of the organisation. She was also president of Rajneesh Foundation International. The two of them met each day in private to go over significant matters for the group.\nSheela ran the operations of virtually all of the sub-groups under Rajneesh's movement, as well as Rajneeshpuram itself. Rancho Rajneesh was administered through the inner circle of followers managed by Sheela. She made decisions for the organisation in meetings with followers in her own private living space. In addition, Sheela would make decisions for the organisation by herself or after meeting with Rajneesh. Those followers of Rajneesh that did not abide by her rulings risked being kicked out of Rajneeshpuram. According to \"Bioterrorism and Biocrimes\", \"This peculiar decision-making style had a significant impact on the group's move to employ biological agents\".\nThe Oregon commune collapsed in 1985 when Rajneesh revealed that the commune leadership had committed a number of serious crimes, including a 1984 bioterror attack (food contamination) on the citizens of The Dalles, Oregon. He was arrested shortly afterwards and charged with immigration violations, and was deported from the United States in accordance with a plea bargain.\nMa Anand Sheela was sentenced to three concurrent 20-year prison sentences, for assault, attempted murder, telephone tapping, immigration fraud and product tampering. She served 29 months before being released on parole. Upon release, she left immediately for Switzerland, where she now manages two nursing homes.\nAfter the collapse.\nTwenty-one countries denied him entry, causing Osho to travel the world before returning to Poona, where he died in 1990. His ashram is today known as the Osho International Meditation Resort. His teachings emphasised the importance of meditation, awareness, love, celebration, courage, creativity and humour\u2014qualities that he viewed as being suppressed by adherence to static belief systems, religious tradition and socialisation. Osho's teachings have had an impact on Western New Age thought,p177 and their popularity has increased since his death.p182\nOne of his strong hopes was creating what he called \"new man\", who embodies characteristics of Gautama Buddha and Zorba the Greek at the same time. Through this concept, Rajneesh tried to reject neither science nor spirituality, but embrace them both. According to him, \u201cNew man\u201d is not subject to one\u2019s sex and does not belong to institutions such as family, political ideologies, or religions.\nBooks by Rajneesh.\nMany books of his teachings were published. They followed a pattern: he would give talks, they would be recorded. The tapes would be worked up into a typed manuscript by some of his followers. The manuscripts would be published, at first in India, and without ISBN numbers, so they were at first bought by his admirers. Later some of the best were reprinted in the West. His talks covered a wide range of religions and philosophies. The total number of books is not known, but it was certainly more than 30.\nlisted without dates:"}

They once lived in the area of Rhineland and France and after the crusades they moved to Poland, Lithuania and Russia. In the 17th century, avoiding persecution, many Jews moved to and settled in Western Europe.\nScientists believe that Ashkenazi Jews originally came from the Land of Israel and initially went to Italy, France, and Germany. Later, during pogroms in the middle ages, mainly in Germany, they fled to Poland and Lithuania, and from there they spread over the rest of Eastern Europe. They then adopted the Yiddish language.\nAfter that, two terms, Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jews, became commonly used: The former indicates the Jews who worshiped in the German way and spoke Yiddish, the latter indicates the Jews who worshiped in the Spanish way and spoke the Ladino language. They differ in language (pronunciation), cultural tradition and worship style.\nDuring World War II, about 6 million Jews, 5 million of whom were Ashkenazi, were killed in the Holocaust. The Holocaust destroyed or greatly reduced the large Jewish communities and the Yiddish language in Europe. Many of the surviving Ashkenazi Jews emigrated to countries such as Israel, Canada, Argentina, Australia, and the United States after the war.\nAs of 2018, Ashkenazim are around 75% of the 14.6 million Jews of the world. They are also the mainstream of Israeli politics. Famous Ashkenazim are Albert Einstein, George Gershwin, Gustav Mahler, Franz Kafka."}

It may be used as a method of abortion when a woman is in her second trimester (between 12\u201332 weeks pregnant). This procedure also may be used after a woman has a miscarriage, to make sure that the uterus is emptied out completely. If tissue is left behind in a woman's uterus after a miscarriage, she can get an infection.\nA dilation and evacuation involves two major steps. First, the cervix (the bottom part of the uterus) is dilated, or made bigger. This is often done about a day before the actual procedure. To dilate the cervix, a doctor may put special tools into the cervix. The cervix needs to be made larger so that medical tools, like forceps (surgical tongs) or a curette (a tool that is used to scrape away the lining of the uterus) can be put into the cervix.\nThe second step of the D&amp;E procedure is to evacuate, or remove, everything inside of the uterus. The woman is given a local anesthetic to numb part of her body or a general anesthetic to put her to sleep. The doctor will then put a cannula (a medical tube) into the uterus, through the vagina. The cannula is attached to a bottle and a pump that create a vacuum. The cannula is used to vacuum (or suction) out everything that is in the uterus, including the fetus. The doctor may use forceps to take out any tissue that is still in the uterus. The doctor may also use a curette to scrape out the lining of the uterus. The vacuum can then be used again to make sure that the uterus is completely empty. This is to prevent infection from tissue left behind by accident.\nIf a woman is earlier on in her pregnancy, this procedure can sometimes be done without dilating the cervix first. This is called a \"vacuum aspiration\". It can be used for women who are in the first trimester (the first 12 weeks of pregnancy) or for women who are in the early stages of the second trimester. However, sometime during the second trimester, it becomes very difficult to do this procedure without dilating the cervix first. At this point, a full dilation and extraction is needed.\nA complete D&amp;E usually takes 10 to 20 minutes. Often, women are able to go home on the same day as the procedure, without staying overnight in a hospital.\nMost abortions are done much earlier on in the pregnancy, so a full dilation and extraction is usually not needed."}

In STP, they segment the market, choose the target market in which \nthe company can have competitive advantages and determine what is to be their products' \nposition in the market, and then they design the marketing mix. In the process, marketing \nmanagers should design an internally consistent and mutually supportive marketing mix.\nIt was specifically divided into the 4Ps : Product, Place, Price and \nPromotion by E.Jerome McCarthy in 1960, and from then it has been dealt with various \nvariables. These variables include not only goods and services but usage, \nvalue, image and so on.\nRelative importance among 4Ps.\nIn devising the marketing strategy : the total marketing operation, it is usually said that getting a competitive advantage should be considered importantly than any other factors. Thus, product and price is firstly determined because in the case they could be seen more related to the competitive advantage. In that case, decision-making about place and promotion is considered relatively later after determining the strategic position of the products by comparing rival products and then giving relative quality of products, price of products to the market. However, it is usual way of using marketing mix, and the relative importance of each mix can be different in many cases in terms of the situation of the market, the characteristic of the product, the characteristic of the company and so on. Thus, place or promotion can be the highest priority in any cases. In conclusion, marketing managers must pursue the most appropriate marketing mix with a bid to achieving competitive advantage using minimum effort."}

His Bataillon became independent and was first named as \"Sturmbataillon Rohr\" and became about one year later renamed by the \"Prussian Minister of War\" to \"Sturm-Bataillon Nr. 5 (Rohr)\".\nOskar von Hutier was another one of Germany's most successful and innovative generals of World War I. He did the same for the Eastern Front\nAfter rising to army command early in 1917, Hutier began to apply the lessons learned from his three years of commanding troops, along with his study of tactics used by other armies. He devised a new strategy for the Germans to break the stalemate of trench warfare. These tactics were to prove so successful in 1917 and 1918 that the French dubbed them \"Hutier tactics\", although the more commonly used term today is \"infiltration tactics\".\nOperation Michael.\nIn the Spring Offensive of 1918 the first of five parts was called Michael. At the beginning on 21 March 1918, they took three armies, for a total of 42 divisions. The aim was to break through the salient at the junction point between the French forces (south) and the English (north), with operations between Bapaume and Saint Simon, intending to then create a wedge between the two contingents, pushing the British Expeditionary Force out towards the sea. On the first day the defensive lines were already smashed against both Allies, and the Germans completely succeeded in advancing 65 kilometers long into a salient of approximately 80 km. In their sweeping advance the German troops met greater resistance against the English than the French. But although the Germans were successful at first, after a few days the German offensive was suddenly exhausted, and beginning March 27, when the French began to engage their strategic reserve near Amiens, the Germans had no more substantial territorial gain. So the Germans failed to achieve a strategically important victory, and indeed, it had lengthened the battle line and created a salient exposed to Allied counter-offensives."}

The Red Queen said, \"It takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.\" The Red Queen principle can be stated as follows:\nThe hypothesis is used to explain two different phenomena: the advantage of sexual reproduction at the level of individuals, and the constant evolutionary arms race between competing species.\nThe book takes Van Valen's idea, which is about co-evolution, and extends it into a discussion about sexual selection in humans. It argues that few aspects of human nature can be understood apart from sex, since human nature is a product of evolution, and evolution in our case is driven by sexual selection.\nThe evolution of sex.\nSex is an evolutionary puzzle. In most sexual species, males make up half the population, yet they bear no offspring directly and generally contribute little to the survival of offspring. In birds and mammals that idea seems less true. They often help protect females, and help in some way after the young are born. Therefore these males definitely do help in the survival of their offspring. But sexual reproduction is very common in simpler forms of life, where the males have nothing to do with their offspring.\nIn human paleolithic populations, males were no doubt vital for hunting and protection. Many bird species rear the young jointly. However, most invertebrate species are not raised by parents at all, with larvae developing amongst the plankton. In addition, males and females in many vertebrate species spend resources to attract and compete for mates. Sexual selection may appear to favor traits that may reduce the fitness of an organism, such as brightly colored plumage in birds of paradise, which makes them more visible to predators. Thus, sexual reproduction appears to be highly inefficient.\nThe book begins with an evolutionary account of sex itself, defending the theory that sex flourishes, despite its costs, because a mixed heritage confers to each generation a defensive \"head start\" against parasites and disease. The basic reason for this is the way sexual reproduction increases the genetic variety in a population. This greatly increases the chance of at least some individuals surviving the onslaught of predators, parasites and diseases. This much is common ground amongst evolutionary theorists.\nRidley then argues that human intelligence is largely a result of sexual selection. He argues that human intelligence far outstrips any need for survival (this is not generally agreed). He says our intelligence is like the peacock's tail, a product of sexual selection. Human intelligence, he suggests, is used primarily to attract mates through prodigious displays of wit, charm, inventiveness, and individuality. This view of intelligence is also supported by Geoffrey Miller. The history of ideas on sexual selection and the evolution of sex is discussed by Helena Cronin."}

All national federations are members. It decides matters like World Championships and changes in rules of the game.\nFIDE was founded on 20 July 1924 in Paris, France. However, it had little influence until the end of World War II. The reigning world champion at that time, Alexander Alekhine, did not want to have anything to do with it. He regarded the world title as his personal property. This only changed when he died with the title, in 1946 (no other champion has ever died while holding the title). It was obvious that some method was needed to find a new champion. FIDE stepped in and, with Russian backing, put forward a solution. The strong Soviet Chess Federation only joined FIDE in 1946. It had a great influence, with resources and many young strong players.\nAfter WW II.\nIn 1948 a tournament was organized to determine which of the world top players was entitled to call himself World Champion. The death of Alekhine had left a vacuum. Two previous champions, Emanuel Lasker and Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Capablanca had died in the late 1930s. It was clear that a new champion would come from the younger players.\nThe six players chosen by FIDE were:\nIn the end, Reuben Fine dropped out, and the other five contested the event. Mikhail Botvinnik won the tournament and became the new world champion.\nIn 1950 the FIDE awarded its first IM (\"International Master\") and GM (\"International Grandmaster\") titles. However it was not until 1957 that FIDE formulated clear criteria to award these titles. In 1970 a new ranking system, the Elo-rating, was introduced.\nLater years.\nWith the collapse of the Soviet Union FIDE lost a powerful partner. This resulted in a long period of trouble. In 1993 worldchampion Gary Kasparov and his challenger Nigel Short left FIDE. They founded their own organisation for professional top players, the PCA (\"Professional Chess Association\"). So now there were two worldchampions: one from FIDE and one from the PCA. \nIt was not until 2006 that the dust settled down and a re-unification match between Vladimir Kramnik and Veselin Topalov took place. In 1999 FIDE was recognised by the International Olympic Committee. In 2001 FIDE played by anti-doping rules, trying to make chess for like a candidate for the Olympic Games."}

The term was used for a long time to describe someone who was accepted as an expert player, but it now has an official meaning.\nGrandmaster is a chess title for even stronger players. The title comes from the word in Middle French: \"Grand maistre\". It was the title given to the head of an Order of Knights, such as the Knights Templar or the Teutonic Knights. Its first use in chess is a comment in the periodical \"Bell's Life\" (18 February 1838) referring to William Lewis as \"our past grandmaster\".p156\nFIDE titles.\nFIDE titles were first awarded in 1950.&lt;ref name=\"H/W\"&gt;Hooper, David and Whyld, Kenneth 1992. \"The Oxford companion to chess\". 2nd ed, Oxford University Press. &lt;/ref&gt;p133 There are four levels of mastery.p132; 177 There are detailed rules as to the number of games played at a given level, and the full rules are quite lengthy. Some countries go with this system entirely, but others have their own system as well.\nOnce awarded a title, the player keeps it for life.\nTitles open to all.\nIn order of merit, with official abbreviations, they are:\nTitles open only to women.\nThere are also women-only titles:\nIt can be seen that a woman grandmaster is a lower standard than an international master. The purpose of women-only titles is to encourage female players, because there are few female players in the game.\nGrandmaster.\nA grandmaster is the highest title that a player can get, except becoming a world champion. It is given by the world chess organisation, FIDE.\nMeeting the demands is not easy. To become a grandmaster, a player has to play at least 27 games with at least two grandmaster-results. In practice this means achieving at least three grandmaster-results or \"norms\". The tournament rating must be 2600 at least. Besides this, a player's own FIDE rating must be at least 2500. Men and women can earn the GM-title by meeting the demands.\nA chessplayer who is already an IM (international master) will simply become grandmaster, but it is not necessary to get the IM title first.\nNational titles.\nAs chess became more popular in the second half of the 19th century, the term began to be given out by organizations. For example, in Germany, there arose an annual sponsored tournament, the \"Hauptturnier\", the winners of which were awarded the title of \"Meister\". Emanuel Lasker, who later became World Champion, first earned a master title in one such tournament. The Soviet Union had a system of national candidate masters, masters and grandmasters before World War II, and its satellite countries in eastern Europe followed suit after the war. \nIn the United States, the title of \"National Master\" is awarded for life, regardless of whether his rating goes below 2200 later. In August 2002, the USCF (United States Chess Federation) decided that \"Any USCF member, who has had a normal post-tournament rating of 2200 or higher, has demonstrated a significant level of chess ability and thought, and is automatically awarded the lifetime title of National Master\"."}

It was originally played as part of farm work, on rural holidays, at other village community-building events, and in shamanistic and Buddhistic rituals. Pungmul performers wear very gorgeous costumes. A flowery version of the Buddhist kkokkal is the most common headdress. Advanced performers sometimes wear sangmo, which are hats with long ribbons attached to them that players can spin and flip in intricate patterns by moving their heads.\nDrumming is the most important element of Pungmul. Each group is led by a kkwaenggwari (small handheld gong) player, and includes at least one person playing janggu (hourglass drum), buk (barrel drum), and jing (gong). Wind instruments (t'aepyongso and nabal) are sometimes played along with the drummers. Following the drummers are dancers, who often play the sogo (a small drum that makes almost no sound) and tend to have more elaborate choreography. Finally, japsaek (actors) dressed as caricatures of traditional village roles wander around to engage spectators, blurring the boundary between performers and audience. Minyo (Korean traditional chants) are performed in Pungmul sometimes, and audience members enthusiastically sing and dance along. Most Minyo are set to drum beats in one of a few jangdan (rhythmic patterns) that are common to Pungmul, Sanjo, P'ansori, and other traditional Korean musical genres."}

The hair is curled out, forming a ball shape. For some people, this is how their hair grows because it is naturally curly. Not all beauty salons can offer this hairstyle, though.\nIt is called the afro because most people who can grow an afro naturally have ancestors from Africa. The afro became popular among Civil Rights activists in the 1960s in the United States. They were tired of white people's hair and bodies being called beautiful and black people's hair and bodies being called ugly. So they grew their hair into afros on purpose. The afro became less popular in the middle of the 1970s through the late 1990s. Then it came back with the natural hair movement. In the 1960s, wearing an afro was seen as a political choice, but in the 21st century it can also be just a style choice. Some people wear an afro only because they do not want to straighten their hair with hot tools or chemicals.\nAn afro can be any length, short or long, but it is different for everyone, especially depending on the person's race and ethnicity. Europeans and Asians will tend to have wavier, looser curls, so they usually cannot grow natural afros. Some people say it is in poor taste or bad manners for a white person to call their hairstyle an \"afro\" because that cuts the afro off from its history as a way black people showed their hair could be beautiful even when white-majority cultures said it wasn't. Some Jewish people also can naturally grow afros, because of their curly hair. These hairstyles are often called \"Jewfros.\"\nThe afro needs care. In a 2015 interview in \"Glamour\", Dr. Rolanda Wilkerson of Pantene said people with afros should wash their hair once a week instead of every day, air-dry instead of using a hair dryer, and moisturize."}

Feelings, thoughts, desires or emotions appear to come out of nowhere, leaving the person to question where they came from.\nThe unconscious mind is a term coined by the 18th century German romantic philosopher Friedrich Schelling and later introduced into English by the poet and essayist Samuel Taylor Coleridge. It is, however, an ancient idea which has been noticed in many civilisations and cultures. Also, whether other mammals have similar mental mechanisms to man is also a question with a considerable history.\nFreud's views.\nThe unconscious mind plays a large role in Sigmund Freud's psychoanalysis. He discussed the importance of the unconscious mind in understanding conscious thought and behaviour.\nHowever, the unconscious was not discovered by Freud. Historian of psychology Mark Altschule concluded, \"It is difficult\u2014or perhaps impossible\u2014to find a nineteenth-century psychologist or psychiatrist who did not recognize unconscious thought as not only real but of the highest importance\".\nFreud's advance was not to uncover the unconscious but to devise a method for systematically studying it. However, his method is controversial, and so are the rest of his ideas. Freud called dreams the \"royal road to the unconscious\". He developed his idea in \"The Interpretation of Dreams\" (1899). The preconscious was described as a layer between conscious and unconscious thought; its contents could be accessed with a little effort. A key feature of the unconscious is what he called 'repression'. Freud believed that many people repress painful memories deep into their unconscious mind.\nAdaptive unconscious.\nThe adaptive unconscious is a set of unconscious mental processes influencing judgment and decision making. It is different from conscious processing: it is faster, effortless, more focused on the present, but less flexible.\nIn other theories of the mind, the unconscious is limited to \"low-level\" activity, such as carrying out goals which have been decided consciously. In contrast, the adaptive unconscious is thought to be involved in \"high-level\" cognition such as goal-setting as well.\nThe term 'adaptive unconscious' suggests it has survival value and hence is an adaptation which was strongly selected in the past. Indeed, for much of vertebrate evolution, all mental activity was unconscious. No-one supposes that fish have consciousness. Thus our consciousness is added to an already-existing set of mechanisms which operate but whose operation is normally not felt by us.p23"}

One special visit was from the American entertainer Buffalo Bill. Buffalo Bill performed his Western show at the garden in 1890. In 1931, it was placed in the care of the city of Frankfurt. Control of the garden was later moved to the American occupation authorities after World War II. When the Palmengarten was returned to the city's control in the 1960s, a major rebuilding started. The halls that were destroyed in the war were redeveloped and expanded. In 1992, the reconstruction finished and the Palmengarten showed in its new form.\nNext to the area of the Palmengarten is the Frankfurt Botanical Garden, which belongs to the biology department of Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universit\u00e4t Frankfurt.\nThe botanical exhibits are placed according to their start in free-air or climate controlled greenhouses, which also contain many tropical and subtropical plants.\nWith , it is the biggest garden of its kind in Germany."}

Most of Jeju Province is Jeju Island, which is the largest island in South Korea. The island was created as a result of a volcanic eruption. Jeju-do is in the southern part of South Korea. Many people visit this island on honeymoon or to sight-see. Because Jeju-do is in the southern part of South Korea, it's warmer than the rest of South Korea.\nJejudo has exotic views and fruits compared to other places in South Korea. A few things it is famous for are Jeonbokjuk (a kind of congee made of abalone) and Dekopon. Hallasan, the highest mountain in South Korea, is at the center of Jeju-do. The Natural World Heritage Site Jeju Volcanic Island and Lava Tubes is also on the island.\nHistory.\nFrom ancient times, Jeju-do has been said to have plenty of women, winds, and stones.\nJeju-do is the only special autonomous province in South Korea. It was established on July 1, 2006. Before that, it had been an independent province since 1946. During the Japanese occupation of Korea, Jeju was called Jeju Myeon and considered part of South Jeolla Province.\nIn the middle of the 20th century, the Korean War divided Korea into two countries, North Korea and South Korea. In 1948, there was an uprising on Jeju Island. The government of what would become South Korea burned down most of the villages on Jeju Island and killed 30,000 people. People disagree about exactly what happened and why. Some people say the government was trying to stop Communists and other people say the Jeju Islanders who were killed were rebels who didn't want the country cut into two pieces. In 2003, the government of South Korea apologized.\nCulture.\nMany television shows, for example \"Dae Jang Geum\", are filmed in Jejudo.\nThe people who live in Jeju Province do not speak exactly the same type of Korean as other Koreans. The Jeju dialect is recognized as a separate language, the Jeju language. Women have been an important part of family economics in Jeju-do. People on Jeju-do tie some ropes over their roof so that it can withstand strong winds. Jeju island is based on basalt. Because basalt has many holes, people had trouble with getting water to drink. As a result, they used Heobeok to carry water.\nThere are many doll hareubang basalt sculptures on Jeju. This is \"stone grandfather\" in English. They are made out of basalt stone.\nHaenyo is the professional job of getting seafood. Most haenyo divers are women. They can hold their breath for two minutes and dive to 20 meters to collect abalone, oysters, and other edible animals.\nTourism.\nMillions of tourists visit Jejudo every year, 14.4 million in 2019, and they leave large amounts of garbage behind. Environmentalists say that too much of Jejudo has been made into roads, buildings and golf courses for the visitors. Some of the residents of Jejudo do not like that there are so many tourists because they use up the water and leave garbage on the beaches. Because many of the restaurants and hotels are owned by people from China, locals do not always get much money from visitors"}

It was first released in the United States on DVD and VHS on November 7, 2000 by SMV Enterprises, the home media division of Sony's music and entertainment label Sony Music Entertainment. Executively produced by Lopez alongside Cory Rooney and Benny Medina, \"Feelin' So Good\" provides a documentary-style look at the launch of Lopez's music career. With a run time of one hour, it contains a mixture of interviews, behind-the-scenes footage, music videos and live performances. The interview segments of \"Feelin' So Good\" were conducted by Lopez's sister Lynda, who interviews not only Lopez, but also her mother, Medina and her future husband Marc Anthony.\n\"Feelin' So Good\" received generally favorable reviews from critics, although it was noted that it would be of no interest to those who were not fans of Lopez. It was additionally praised for showing Lopez's transition from her acting career to a music career. In the United States, \"Feelin' So Good\" was certified as a Gold Video Longform by the RIAA for shipments of 50,000 units.\nBackground.\nFrom a young age, Lopez's Puerto Rican parents stressed the importance of work ethic and being able to speak English. They encouraged their three daughters to put on performances at home, singing and dancing in front of each other and their friends so that they would stay \"out of trouble\". While attending her final year of high school, Lopez learned about a film casting that was seeking several teenage girls for small roles. She auditioned and was cast in \"My Little Girl\" (1986), an low-budget film co-written and directed by Connie Kaiserman. After she finished filming her role in the film, Lopez knew that she wanted to become a \"famous movie star\". She told her parents this, but they ensisted that it was a \"really stupid\" idea and that \"no Latinos did that\". Their disagreements led Lopez to move out of their family home and into an apartment in Manhattan. During this period, Lopez performed in regional productions of several musicals, before being hired for the chorus in a musical that toured Europe for five months. She was unhappy with the role, as she was the only member of the chorus not to have a solo. From there, she got a job on the show \"Synchronicity\" in Japan, where she acted as a dancer, singer and a choreographer. Lopez then gained her first regular high-profile job as a Fly Girl dancer on the television comedy program \"In Living Color\". She moved to Los Angeles with then-boyfriend David Cruz to film the series and remained a regular cast member until 1993 when she decided to pursue an acting career.\nAfter a series of co-starring film roles, Lopez received her big break came in 1996, when she was cast to play the title role in \"Selena\", a biopic of the late American singer-songwriter Selena. In the film, Selena's real voice is used for the musical sequences in Selena, but Lopez would nonetheless sing the lyrics during the scenes instead of lip synching. When asked by an interview if \"Selena\" inspired her to launch a music career, Lopez stated: \"I really, really became inspired, because I started my career in musical theater on stage. So doing the movie just reminded me of how much I missed singing, dancing, and the like...\" After filming Selena, Lopez was \"really feeling [her] Latin roots\" and cut a demo in Spanish. Lopez's manager then sent the song, entitled \"Vivir Sin Ti\", to Sony Music Entertainment's Work Records, who showed an interest in signing Lopez. Tommy Mottola, the head of the label suggested to her that she sing in English instead. She complied and began recording her debut studio album \"On the 6\".\nTransition from film to music.\nDuring production of the \"On the 6\", Lopez was aware of the fact that she received her recording contract on the premise of her looks and having an already established name in the entertainment industry, and wanted to prove that she had musical talent. Prior to the debut of her music, critics wondered why she would take the risk of launching a music career. It was noted that: \"If the album was a flop, not only would it embarrass Lopez, but it might even damage her career.\" Lopez's debut single \"If You Had My Love\" was serviced to radio in the United States on May 4, 1999. The song debuted at 72 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100 on the week of May 15, 1999, and entered the top ten two weeks later. A month after the single's release, it moved to number six, earning the \"Greatest Gainer\" title of the week, and reached the top spot on June 12, 1999. The song dethroned Ricky Martin's \"Livin' La Vida Loca\" as the number-one song in the country; this was the first time a Latin artist followed another Latin artist to the top of the chart since Gloria Estefan's \"Coming Out Of The Dark\" replaced Timmy T's \"One More Try\" in March 1991. Lopez also became the first artist to top the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 with their debut single since Britney Spears did with her single \"...Baby One More Time\" four months prior. \"If You Had My Love\" stayed atop the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for a period of a month, and remained in the top ten until September of 1999. \"If You Had My Love\" was also a success internationally; topping the charts in countries including New Zealand, Australia, and Canada. The song also peaked at number four on the UK Singles Chart and reached the top ten of seven other countries.\n\"No Me Ames\", a duet with American recording artist Marc Anthony was released as a B-side to \"If You Had My Love\" and as the album's second single. The song was promoted by Sony Discos, who released a salsa and a ballad version of the song on their respective radio formats. The surprising success of both \"If You Had My Love\" and the album made the \"popular actor even more popular\". Both the music industry and the public became intrigued by \"this woman who seemed to have so many different talents\". Following the release of \"If You Had My Love\" and \"No Me Ames\", three additional singles were released. By the end of 1999, Lopez had successfully converted herself from a film star to a pop star.\nVideo contents.\n\"Rather than the usual collection\", \"Feelin' So Good\" provides a documentary-style look at the launch of Lopez's music career. It contains a mixture of interviews, behind-the-scenes footage, music videos and live performances. The interview footage in-between the performance segments has been described as \"very slick and promotional\". It was also noted that in the interview footage Lopez \"comes through energetically\" and without \"much star-ego\". The video album provides very basic information about the singer's career, rather than going too much into detail. The release has been compared to the DVD releases of Mariah Carey. Cory Rooney and Lopez acted as album executive producers of the DVD, while Lopez acted as a video executive producer, alongside Benny Medina. Jeffrey Norskog acted as a video associate producer.\nChapters overview.\n\"Feelin' So Good\" opens with a intertitle that features a behind-the-scenes look at Lopez during the artwork shoot for \"On the 6\", artist's proof of said photoshoot and brief clips of the music videos to the album's five singles. In the second chapter, \"Why Risk a Music Career?\", Lopez is interviewed by her sister Lynda Lopez, who oversees each interview segment, about the risks of starting a music career after having an already thriving movie career. Critics believed that she was only launching a music career with an intent to expand her brand, while Lopez felt as if it was simply the \"next natural step\" in her career. Lopez's manager Benny Medina further discusses this, labeling her as the \"ultimate\" triple threat \u2013 \"the actor, singer and dancer\". Lopez then confers, in the chapter \"Press Tours / Promotions\", about the extensive promotional schedule she was on to promote the album. She examines the differences in promoting an album and a film, stating that promoting an album is more \"personal\" as it is something that is \"closer to your heart\" and something she \"really believes in\". According to Lopez, by the end of the promotional tour for the album she \"lost\" her voice from the amount of interviews she had. Following this, Lopez's performance of the Darkchild remix of \"If You Had My Love\" at the 1999 VH1 Fashion Awards is shown. In the fifth chapter, \"Beginning of the Year\", Lopez discusses her hectic schedule in the beginning of 1999; balancing film events and choosing the album's first single and shooting its music video. Lopez then goes into detail about the concept behind the music video of \"If You Had My Love\". Lopez's sister Lynda makes a formal introduction to the music video, as having a \"special place\" in her heart, and it is shown. Lopez then explains how her duet with Marc Anthony on \"No Me Ames\" came about and the concept of the video. Video footage is shown, as Lopez discusses her first ever live performance, with \"No Me Ames\", in April 1999 at Madison Square Garden alongside Marc Anthony. Following this, the official music video to \"No Me Ames\" is shown.\nIn the eleventh chapter of \"Feelin' So Good\", appropriately entitled \"First Number One Single\", Lopez reveals the moment when she found out that \"If You Had My Love\" went number one in the United States. She then went on to discuss the events that occoured during the release week of \"On the 6\" in \"Record Release Week\". Lopez then reveals how she came to record \"Let's Get Loud\" and her performance of the song at the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup is shown. In \"Jennifer's Energy\", Medina discusses Lopez's ability to work at late hours of the night. Her 1999 Billboard Music Awards performance of the Hex Hector remix of \"Waiting for Tonight\" is then shown. Lopez then speaks of filming the music video for \"Waiting for Tonight\" and behind the scenes footage on set of the video is shown. She also explains how the Hex Hector remix of the song came about and the alternative music video that was created for it. A megamix video of the original and Hex Hector remix follows. The twentieth chapter, \"Jennifer's Mom\", is an interview with Lopez's mother discussing what was like to see Lopez on television for the first time. Lopez then discusses her surprise to the amount of fans she had and their dedication in \"Fan Support\". In \"Working on Record\", the twenty-second chapter of \"Feelin' So Good\", Lopez discusses the process of writing and recording the album. Lopez's sister Lynda interviews her choreographer Tina Landon on what it is like to work with her, before her 1999 Blockbuster Awards performance of \"If You Had My Love\" is shown. Footage is then shown of Lopez \"goofing around\" during a photoshoot, before the music video to her song \"Baila\" is shown, for the very first time. In \"Film Energy vs. Music Energy\" Lopez compares the difference between the fans of her movies and of her music. In the final interview footage of \"Feelin' So Good\", Lopez explains the concept behind the music video of \"Feelin' So Good\" and why Big Pun and Fat Joe were chosen to be featured on the song.

Aaron Beierle of DVD Talk stated that: \"It's interesting to watch this disc after watching Lopez in \"The Cell\". I think it's been impressive to watch her mature as an actress; although much has been made of her supposedly demanding attitude, I think she's talented as not only a singer/dancer but as a dramatic actress \u2013 I'm sure a comedic role is right around the corner\". The reviewer additionally stated that the most interesting segment of the release was the \"Waiting for Tonight\" music video. He concluded by stating that: \"Although I'm not really a big fan of her music, I do appreciate it and found it enjoyable and entertaining to listen to throughout.\""}

It can create the appearance of two or more objects where there is really only one. The light from the object gets bent round the massive body in between.\nThe massive body, such as a galaxy or black hole, creates a very strong gravitational field in space. The exact nature of the effect depends on:\nEinstein.\nAlbert Einstein predicted the possibility of gravitational lensing. The discovery that our Sun bends the light of distant objects when their light passes close to it was evidence that the general theory of relativity was correct.\nTypes of lensing.\nThere are three types of lensing:\nStrong lensing.\nStrong lensing betrays itself by producing multiple images from the same object. A well-known example is \"Einstein's Cross\" (Q2237+0305) at a distance of 8 billion lightyears. Here, the gravitational lens produces four images from the same object (a quasar), although it is only one object. The light of the quasar does not travel in a straight line to earth. Instead, it is bent along the gravitational field of a galaxy in front of it. This galaxy is at a distance of 400 million lightyears.\nThe first discovery of this kind (except the Sun) happened in 1979. Two quasars were close to each other. They both had the same spectrum and proved to be two images of the same quasar (Q0957+651). In 1980 scientists found out which group of galaxies functioned as the lens.\nWeak lensing.\nWeak lensing does not produce multiple images of the same object. Instead it produces a highly deformed or stretched image from an object far beyond the lens. In 1986 this was discovered in cluster Abell 370. Later it was understood that this was a greatly deformed image of a galaxy far beyond the cluster. \nThe object can appear larger or smaller, as is shown in the table. Weak lenses allow us to observe very distant galaxies, which we would be unable to observe without such lens. By bending the light, the amount of light (magnitude) from the source increases. This way a very distant and faint galaxy can become visible, while we normally would not be able to observe it.\nMicrolensing.\nIn cases of microlensing, there is no distortion in shape. However, the amount of light visible from an object changes periodically. This can be used to detect exoplanets. Light from a distant star is bent and enhanced by the gravitational field of a closer star. The presence of an exo-planet rotating around that closer star bends the light of the star farther away periodically. Object OGLE-2005-BLG-390-Lb, discovered 25 January 2006, is the first exoplanet detected by using microlensing."}

He is also known for starring in the movie \"Once\" and co-writing its Academy Award-winning song, \"Falling Slowly.\"\nCareer.\nHansard quit school at age 13 to begin busking on local Dublin streets. He formed The Frames in 1990, and they have been an important part of the Irish music scene ever since. Their first album, \"Another Love Song\", was released on Island Records in 1991, and their most recent, \"The Cost\", was released in 2006.\nHansard first came to international attention as guitar player Outspan Foster in the 1991 Alan Parker movie \"The Commitments\", after attending the New York movie Academy School of Acting. He has often stated that he regretted taking the role, because he felt it distracted from his music career.\nIn 2003, he presented the television programme \"\", which showcased Irish music talent on RT\u00c9.\nOn 22 April 2006, he released his first album without The Frames, \"The swell season\", on Overcoat Recordings in collaboration with Czech singer and multi-instrumentalist Mark\u00e9ta Irglov\u00e1, Marja Tuhkanen from Finland on violin and viola, and Bertrand Galen from France on cello. Hansard also spent part of 2006 in front of the cameras for a music-infused Irish movie \"Once\", in which Hansard plays a Dublin busker, and Irglov\u00e1 an immigrant street vendor. The movie had its American premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in 2007 and received the Festival's World Cinema Audience Award. During the promotional tour, he and Irglov\u00e1 began dating. Said Hansard about his relationship with Irglova: \"I had been falling in love with her for a long time, but I kept telling myself she's just a kid\". One of the songs they wrote together for the movie (\"Falling Slowly\") won an Oscar for Best Song in February 2008. Hansard became the first Irish-born person to win in that category. Hansard and Irglov\u00e1 also recorded a version of Bob Dylan's \"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\" for the movie \"I'm Not There\" in 2007. In 2009, Hansard said that he and Irglova were no longer romantically linked, and that they are now \"good friends.\"\nAside from his projects with The Frames and Irglov\u00e1, Hansard also appeared as part of the band on the 2006 Oxfam charity album, \"The Cake Sale\". In addition, Hansard has recorded a few cover songs, both alone and with band member Colm Mac Con Iomaire, for the Today FM discs \"Even Better than the Real Thing\". Songs that he has recorded include Justin Timberlake's \"Cry Me a River\" on \"Vol. 1\" and Britney Spears' \"Everytime\" on \"Vol. 2\".\nOutside music, he appeared on a \"Simpsons\" episode as a street musician in Ireland.\nInfluences.\nHansard has remarked about his musical influences: \"In my house, when I was a kid, there was the holy trinity, which was Leonard Cohen, Van Morrison and Bob Dylan with Bob sitting center.\"\nHansard and The Frames toured as the support act for Bob Dylan in Australia and New Zealand in August 2007 and Hansard often performs Van Morrison's songs in concert. \"Into the Mystic\" and \"And the Healing Has Begun\" were included on the collector's edition of the soundtrack for the movie \"Once\"."}

It runs macOS and comes with a built in webcam and microphone and a power adapter that is attached by magnets. MacBook Pros are housed in aluminum metal and are currently available in 13\" and 16\" models.\nHistory.\nThe MacBook Pro was first introduced on January 2006 at the Macworld Expo.\nModels.\nThe first MacBook Pro was the 15\" model, but a 17\" model was released later that year. New models were released in late 2006, late 2007, early 2008, late 2008, and early 2009. In June 2009, a 13\" model was added and the other sizes were also updated. The next updates happened in April 2010 and February 2011. Another update was released in June 2012, in which a new 15\" model was introduced with a much higher display resolution (dubbed the Retina Display, meaning that it can display more pixels, creating a smoother image). However, Apple stopped making the 17\" model, but Apple released 16\" model in 2019.\nFeatures.\nThe new MacBook Pro has several features:\nThe aluminum unibody case makes the MacBook Pro lighter, polished, and stronger. On the left side of the computer, there is a button next to many indicator lights. This button will turn on the lights. They say how much battery power the computer has left. More lights on means more battery.\nA built-in battery gives around 10 to 20 hours of power to all models of the computer. This battery can be recharged up to 1,000 times, whereas typical notebooks can only be recharged 200 to 300 times.\nThe keyboard has curved and backlit keys.\nThe trackpad is the part of the laptop that is touch-sensitive. It allows the use to move the cursor on the screen by using their finger. The entire trackpad is also the trackpad button, adding more space to the trackpad. Right-click can be done with two fingers or using a right-click area. Some gestures (involving 2 or more fingers at once) are:\nHard drive sizes range from 320 to 750 GB. One can use a solid-state drive with a capacity of between 128 GB to 8 TB to help improve battery life and performance, though they cost more.\nThe CPUs in the computers are either quad-core, hexa-core or octa-core Intel core i5, i7 or i9 chips, or an Apple M1. An SD card slot in the 13\" and 15\" MacBook Pros can be used to import photos from a camera or camcorder.\nThe GPU is part of the CPU and is called Intel HD Graphics 4000. The 15\" model also has a separate nVidia GeForce GT 650M graphics card, which does the same thing as the Intel HD 4000, but faster and smoother. If the user feels like it, they can switch between the two.\nThere is nothing in this summary about what PORTS are included, what level of USB is supported, etc. This is as basic or more basic than what's on this page. \nEnvironmental impact.\nFeatures to reduce environmental impact.\nThe MacBook Pros have the following environmentally-friendly features:"}

She may be best known and loved for her film noir movies femme fatale roles in movies by director Fritz Lang.\nBiography.\nJoan Bennett had three distinct phases to her long and successful career, first as a winsome blonde ingenue, then as a brunette femme fatale and, finally, as a warm-hearted wife/mother figure.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Palisades, N.J., she was part of a famous theatrical family with a lineage dating back to traveling minstrels in 18th century England. Her father was actor Richard Bennett, her mother, actress Adrienne Morrison, and her sisters, actress Constance Bennett and dancer, Barbara Bennett. Joan first acted onstage with her father at age 18 and by 19 had become a movie star courtesy of her roles in such movies as \"Bulldog Drummond\" (1929) and \"Disraeli\" (1929). She moved quickly from movie to movie throughout the 1930s, appearing with John Barrymore in his version of \"Moby Dick\" (1930) and playing Amy to Katharine Hepburn's Jo in \"Little Women\" (1933). Of the three Bennett sisters, Joan would achieve the greatest fame.\nCareer.\nContracted to 20th Century Fox, Joan Bennett appeared as a blonde ingenue in several movies including \"Puttin' on the Ritz\" in 1930 and \"Me and My Gal\" in 1932, before leaving this studio to appear in \"Little Women\" (1933). The latter movie brought Bennett to the attention of producer Walter Wanger, who signed her to a contract and eventually (in 1940) married her. \nWanger managed Bennett's career, and with director Tay Garnett convinced her to change her hair from blonde (her natural color) to brunette. With this change her screen persona evolved into that of a glamorous seductive, femme fatale and she began to attract attention in a series of highly acclaimed movie noirs by director Fritz Lang. During the search to find an actress to play Scarlett O'Hara in \"Gone with the Wind\", Bennett was tested and impressed producer David O. Selznick. She was briefly considered to be a front runner for this part but Selznick eventually turned his attention to Paulette Goddard, who was then rejected in favour of Vivien Leigh.\nIn the 1940s Bennett appeared in four movies directed by Fritz Lang with whom she and Wanger had formed their own movie company. Three of these movies, \"Man Hunt\" (1941), \"The Woman in the Window\" (1945), and \"Scarlet Street\" (1945) established her as a movie noir femme fatale and leading Hollywood actress. She also worked with noted directors Jean Renoir in \"The Woman on the Beach\" (1947) and Max Oph\u00fcls in \"The Reckless Moment\". Other highlights of the more mature phase of her career include the role of Spencer Tracy's wife and Elizabeth Taylor's mother in both \"Father of the Bride\" (1950) and \"Father's Little Dividend\" (1951).\nScandal &amp; later years.\nIn 1950, Bennett changed agents. In 1951 Wanger shot and injured Bennett's new MCA agent, Jennings Lang (1915-1996), with whom she had allegedly begun an affair. The resulting scandal hurt her career much more than Wanger's, according to the double standards toward women of the time. Wanger's attorney, Jerry Giesler, mounted a \"temporary insanity\" defense and Wanger served a four-month sentence at the Castaic Honor Farm two hours' drive north of Los Angeles, quickly returning to his movie career to make a string of intelligent hit movies. Bennett, meanwhile was forced to flee to Chicago to appear in theater, and later in television because the scandal was too great a stain on her movie career and the movie studios were already floundering in the 1950s as it was. Though Humphrey Bogart, a longtime friend of Bennett's, pleaded with the studios on her behalf to keep her role in \"We're No Angels\" following the shooting scandal, that movie proved to be one of Bennett's last. Wanger and Bennett remained married until 1965. \nBennett continued to work steadily in theatre and television and was a cast member of the television series \"Dark Shadows\" for its entire five year run, from 1966 until 1971, receiving an Emmy Award nomination for her performance therein. Bennett also appeared in a few more movies, most notably the cult horror thriller from Italian director Dario Argento's \"Suspiria\". In the last decades of her life, she was married to David Wilde, a Yale graduate and movie critic. Bennett died from a heart attack in Scarsdale, New York at the age of 80, and was buried in Pleasant View Cemetery, Lyme, Connecticut.\nJoan Bennett was survived by 4 daughters (Diana Fox, Melinda Markey, and Shelley and Stephanie Wanger) and 13 grandchildren.\nBennett has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for services to Motion Pictures, at 6310 Hollywood Boulevard."}

This happened between July 1918 to September 1918. They caused the ending of the Terauchi Masatake government.\nCauses.\nA very large rise in the price of rice caused very bad economic \"(money)\" problems, especially in rural areas \"(outside of cities)\" where rice was the main food of daily life for the people. Farmers, became angry at the government (who set the amount of money the farmer's made) and the rice merchants when they learned that they were making much less money for growing the rice than it was being sold for to the public. They blamed the government and the merchants for letting the price of rice rise so high. The rise in the price of rice happened just at the worst point in the rapid rise in prices in many things such as food and rents that was happening just after World War I. This caused problems for the people of Japan. The Siberian Intervention made things worse because the government themselves bought lots of rice to feed their soldiers who were outside of Japan. This made the price of rice rise even more. The government did not do anything to stop it, and it spread to the towns and cities. \nThe riots.\nThe Rice Riots were the biggest, most violent and widespread in modern Japanese history. The first protest happened in the small fishing town of Uozu in Toyama Prefecture, on 23 July 1918. Starting with peaceful petitioning, the protest quickly grew into riots, strikes, looting, incendiary bombings of police stations and government offices and into armed fights. By mid-September 1918, over 623 protests and or riots had happened in 38 cities, 153 towns and 177 villages, with over 2 million people taking part in them. 25,000 people were arrested, and 8200 were convicted of crimes. Punishments were given including minor fines and up to the death penalty.\nPrime Minister Terauchi said he and his cabinet were to blame for the riots, and they all ended their jobs on 29 September 1918.\nPeople studying this part of Japanese history think that the riots and so the need for rice in some way may have caused the Japanese to grow their occupation of other countries. Evidence of this is thought to be the increase in rice production in Taiwan and Korea."}

It has become colorful, simple and luxurious. Because Japanese people are becoming interested in the samurai, \"kacchu\" is becoming more popular. \"Kacchu\" has a high popularity among couples on the birth of the boy. In marriage, a bridegroom wears a tuxedo or \"hakama\" but, recently there have been more men wearing \"Kacchu\". \"Kanetsugu Naoe\"\u2019s (\u76f4\u6c5f \u517c\u7d9a) \"Kacchu\" is especially popular.

The cattle become very violent and show signs of mental disorder and have trouble when they move. It has a long incubation period, about 4~5 years. Cattle that are 4~5 years old can get the disease very easily.\nIt was not a common disease, but in 1996 the Minister of Health and Welfare in England said that it could be contracted by humans. Mad cow disease has damaged the cattle industry. Some food was made from cattle that had the disease. In England, the nation that was worst affected, more than 179,000 cattle were infected and 4.4 million were killed in an attempt to get rid of the disease.\nKorea.\nIn 2012, Korean President Lee's negotiations about the import of beef from the USA made the public angry.

It measured as a Level 6 disaster on the International Nuclear Event Scale (the Chernobyl disaster and the Fukushima disaster are the only accidents listed as more serious than this one).\nMayak is the name for a number of nuclear facilities, which are about from Ekaterinburg, in Russia. The facilities were also known as \"Chelyabinsk-65\", or \"Chelyabinsk-40\". Mayak was built between 1945 and 1948. It was the first plant that could produce nuclear material in the Soviet Union. At times, up to 25.000 people worked at Mayak. They produced the plutonium fuel that was used for the first Soviet atomic bomb, amongst other things.\nBetween 1948 and 1987, a total of ten nuclear reactors were built. Until 1991, all but two were closed. The two remaining produce radioactive isotopes for health care and for research purposes.\nDuring different accidents, a large amount of radioactivity was released into the environment. The biggest of these accidents happened in 1957, and is known as \"Kyshtym Disaster\" today. It happened in a plant near Kishtim (\u041a\u044b\u0448\u0442\u044b\u043c). There were many accidents in this secret plant. The most serious of them happened on September 29, 1957. The cooling system of the plant failed to work. A (non-nuclear) explosion occurred. This explosion had the force of between 75 and 100 tons of TNT. It threw the lid of the container, which weighted 160 tons, into the air. The accident released about 20 MegaPCi (about 740 Petabecquerel) of radioactivity. At least 200 people died from radiation sickness. About 10,000 people were evacuated from their homes. More than 470,000 people were affected by the radiation, without knowing it.\nDuring the next ten to eleven hours, the radioactive cloud moved towards the northeast, reaching between 300 and 350 kilometers from the accident. The fallout of the cloud resulted in a long-term contamination of an area of more than 800 square kilometers, mostly with caesium-137 and strontium-90. Today, the area is known as the East-Ural Radioactive Trace (EURT).\nThe existence of Mayak was a secret. Only very few people knew it was there. For this reason, the people living in the areas affected by the accident were not told about the accident. On 6 October, a week after the accident, the authorities started to evacuate about 10,000 people, but they did not tell about the reason for the evacuation. People grew hysterical with fear because unknown 'mysterious' diseases were breaking out. Victims were seen with skin 'sloughing off' their faces, hands and other exposed parts of their bodies.\" It was Zhores Medvedev who revealed the nature and extent of the disaster to the world.\nEven though the Soviet government hid information about the figures, it is known that the direct exposure to radiation caused at least 200 cases of death from cancer.\nTo reduce the spread of radioactive contamination after the accident, contaminated soil was removed and kept in fenced enclosures that were called \"graveyards of the earth\".\nIn 1968, the Soviet government disguised the EURT area by creating the East-Ural Nature Reserve, which prohibited any unauthorised access to the affected area.\nRumours of a nuclear mishap somewhere near Chelyabinsk had long been circulating in the West. That there had been a serious nuclear accident west of the Urals was eventually inferred from research on the effects of radioactivity on plants, animals, and ecosystems, published by Professor Leo Tumerman, former head of the Biophysics Laboratory at the Institute of Molecular Biology in Moscow, and associates.\nAccording to Gyorgy, who invoked the Freedom of Information Act to gain access to the relevant Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) files, the CIA knew of the 1957 Mayak accident all along. They kept it secret to prevent adverse consequences for the fledgling American nuclear industry. Only in 1990 did the Soviet government declassify documents pertaining to the disaster.\nAccording to different sources, the amount of radioactivity produced by this disaster is between twice and six times that of Chernobyl disaster of 1986. Because the leakage was more limited, this is classified as a Level 6 (of 7) disaster on the International Nuclear Event Scale. Chernobyl is rated at Level 7.\nIn 2003, Russian authorities closed down the Mayak plant. Lake Karachay, which is close to the plant is seen as one of the most contaminated spots on the planet.\nIn the past 45 years, about 500,000 people in the region have been irradiated in one or more of the incidents. Some of them were exposed to more than 20 times the radiation suffered by the Chernobyl disaster effects victims."}

It a type of art. These days fingernails and toenails are seen by some as important points of beauty.\nAlso, it is a type of fashion activity, related to manicuring. There are commercial shops ('nail bars') where nails are worked on to make them attractive. The main product is acrylic nails with ready-made designs which can be stuck on top of natural nails.\nNail polish.\nNail polish, or nail varnish, is a lacquer applied to human fingernails or toenails to decorate and/or protect the nail. Today\u2019s nail polishes are usually nitrocellulose in a solvent such as butyl acetate or ethyl acetate. They may be clear or coloured with pigments. The coating has a plasticizers (e.g. camphor). This links polymer chains, spacing them to make the film flexible after drying. That way it resists cracking or flaking caused by the natural movement of the nail.\nHistory.\nNail polish was used in the ancient world. In China it started off being made from a combination of beeswax, egg whites, gelatin, vegetable dyes, and gum arabic and rose petals. The Chinese would dip their hands in this mixture until their finger nails turned red or pink. In Ancient Egypt henna was used. The henna stained their fingernails orange, which turned dark red or brown after the stain matured. In 1300 BC, the colour of the nail polish reflected social rank. The colours gold and silver were favoured; later, black and red were the favoured colours. Red is the colour Cleopatra wore.\nBy the turn of the 9th century, nails were tinted with scented red oils, and polished or buffed with a chamois cloth, rather than simply polished. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, people pursued a polished rather than painted look by massaging tinted powders and creams into their nails, then buffing them shiny. After the creation of automobile paint, Cutex produced the first modern nail polish in 1917. Synthetic nail polish was introduced in the 1920s in Paris.\nArtificial nails.\nThe artificial nails are not a replacement, but an extension for natural nails. There are two main approaches to creating artificial nails\u2013\"tips\" and \"forms\". \nAcrylics.\nThis is a mixture of a powder and a liquid. The mixture starts to harden in 30\u201340 seconds after application and gets to its final hardness in fifteen minutes. Powder and liquid acrylics can be removed by using a variety of solvents (usually acetone is used). Usually it takes 15 to 20 minutes to remove the nail.\nUV topcoat.\nAnother material, commonly called \"UV Top Coat\" (in correct terms a polymer resin), hardens under ultraviolet light. These can show a wider range of properties (flexibility, strength, etc.) but may be more expensive. They cannot be removed by organic solvents, but only by filing (or left to grow out with the natural nail).\nOther.\nAnother popular alternative to acrylic or gel preparations are fiberglass or silk wraps. They are done by cutting pieces of actual fiberglass or silk fabric to fit on the surface of the nail or tip and then it is sealed down with a resin or glue. These are an alternative for those who are allergic to chemicals used in the acrylic or gel process. Other materials can be used, as well as combinations of them. There are also temporary, cheaper flexible tips that can be quickly glued at home without help from a professional.\nAcrylic nail powders are available in a variety of colours and can use \"special effects\" such as contours, sparkles and the very popular \"French manicure\" (pink and white appearance).\nGuitar players.\nGuitar players, if they don't use their fingertips, use their nails, or a 'pick' (piece of metal) to play. If they use their nails, the nails must be in perfect condition, and kept to the same length all the time. Alternatively, he/she may use acrylic stick-ons. Every guitarist has their own way.\nThe players of many ancient Chinese instruments, like the guqin, pipa, and ruan, also commonly used artificial nails."}

She was a founder of the House of Chanel. She was the only fashion designer to be named on TIME Magazine's 100 most influential people of the 20th century. She broke free of conventions and became a role model for some. Her behaviour during the German occupation of France in World War II led to criticism.\nBiography.\nChanel was born in 1883 in Saumur, France. In her youth, she was a seamstress and a nightclub singer. Her stage name was Coco, so she used that name publicly.\nIn 1910, she opened a hat shop. In 1919, she opened a house of fashion in Paris, and introduced her perfume, Chanel No. 5, in 1921. She retired in 1939, but returned to fashion with great success in 1954.\nShe is famous for the little black dress, Chanel No. 5, the most famous women's perfume in the world, and the knee-long skirt and box jacket suit worn with pearl necklace.\nFirst shops.\nIn 1913, Chanel opened her first shop in Deauville, France. Society women liked her simple wardrobe. In 1915, she opened a second shop in Biarritz.\nChanel became one of the first women fashion designers to create simple and practical clothes for the sporty women of the era. She took the color black, which was not used in fashion at the time and showed \"chic\" it could be by wearing it. The material jersey was usually used to make men's underwear, but Chanel started to work with it to make women's fashion. Short hair, tans, and casual styles were the new trends. She banned corsets and other uncomfortable garments.\nPersonal life.\nChanel was the mistress of several rich men. During her relationship with the Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia in 1920, she added a Russian touch to her dresses by embroidering Russian patterns on them.\nChanel was with Hugh Grosvenor, from 1924 to 1931. During this time, she discovered the English tweed sweater, English men's suits, and English coats. She added these to her collections.\nWar-time.\nChanel lived at the Hotel Ritz in Paris for over thirty years. During World War II, the Nazis occupied Paris, and her shops were closed. She had an affair with a Nazi officer, and was accused of being a collaborator. She moved to Switzerland, and gave up fashion.\nAfter a 15-year gap, Chanel returned to fashion in 1954. She was shocked to see the new fashion trends, especially those by Christian Dior. She understood better than anyone the requirements and needs of an active woman\u2019s lifestyle. Her 'comeback' collection was in 1954.\nMedia.\nHer life was depicted in the Broadway musical \"Coco\" in 1969. Movies based on her life include: \"Chanel Solitaire\" (1981), \"Coco Chanel\" (2008), \"Coco before Coco\" (2009), and \"Coco Chanel &amp; Igor Stravinsky\" (2009). Chanel also liked drinking cocoa during interviews. She always said she felt better after a few sips.\nToday.\nChanel died in 1971. She is still influencing women\u2019s lifestyles and clothing. The House of Chanel remains in business. It is a member of the \"Chambre syndicale de la haute couture\", the top fashion clique in Paris. The House of Chanel produces modern versions of her best ideas."}

He is one of only two Korean kings called \"great\" (the other is Gwanggaeto the Great of Goguryeo). He picked out young scholars and tried to fix the prejudice of classes by helping intelligent but low-class prodigies. In 1442, he had Jang Young-Sil, a scientist in Joseon, invent the 'Chuk-Oo-Gi (\u6e2c\u96e8\u5668)'. This was a kind of tool to help measure the rain and how much it fell. Also, he expanded the territory of Joseon. \nOne of the best works and the biggest reason why Sejong was called great was because he created the Hoon min jung um (\u8a13\u6c11\u6b63\u97f3). It is called in modern days as 'Han-gul (\ud55c\uae00)'. Because of the creation of the Hoon min jung um, Joseon (now Korea) now got its own alphabet, and many people, most of whom have never learned how to read Hanja (Chinese characters used for Korean) could learn how to read and write much more easily than before.\nEarly life.\nSejong was the third son of King Taejong. When he was twelve, he became grand prince and married Shim On of Cheongsong. When he was young, he was very good at studying. His father liked him more than his other brothers.\nHis older brothers, Yangnyeong and Hyoryeong, thought they were not fit to be king and that it was their duty to make Sejong the king, even though he was younger than them. So they acted rudely and badly in front of the court and were soon . Yangnyeong became a traveler who wandered in the mountains, and Hyoryeong became a Buddhist monk. This later became a heartfelt and traditional legend in South Korea."}
{"id": "187186", "revid": "1133508", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=187186", "title": "Kabuki", "text": " is a traditional form of Japanese classical drama which started about 400 years ago. It is known for its very stylized acting and the elaborate makeup worn by the actors. The word kabuki means \"singing and dancing\", and also means \"to act strange and different, to be outside what is normal.\" The style of kabuki is not meant to look like real life.\nPeople from around the world are now interested in Kabuki. It was recognized by UNESCO in 2006 as an important part of Japan's cultural history.\nHistory.\n1603-1629.\nKabuki theater started during the Edo period (1603\u20141868). Kabuki was started by a woman, Izumo no Okuni, who performed in the dry river bed in Kyoto in 1603. It was very popular, especially because many of the stories and dance moves were about sex. Many of the women performers were probably prostitutes, and it was thought that kabuki disturbed discipline. This caused women to be banned from performing in Kabuki plays in 1629. Beautiful young men replaced women to play female roles, but in 1652 they were banned for the same reason. Kabuki was allowed to continue with adult men playing all the roles, and this style is the one that has became famous. \n1673-1841.\nIt developed into what we now know as kabuki during the Genroku period (1688\u20141704). During this period, the key aspects were formed, such as conventional character tropes. Kabuki and bunraku began to complement each other. \nThe popular playwright Chikamatsu Monzaemon produced several influential works during this time. His most significant work is \"The Love Suicides at Sonezaki.\" It was written for bunraku. \nThe development of mie pose was also developed during Genroku period. \nAfter the \"Genroku\" era, Kabuki became popular in Japanese cities, growing rapidly as proper theater with great authors and actors. Bunraku also influenced the stories, directions, content and style. Ballet and theater music, such as \"Nagauta\", \"Tokiwadubushi\" and \"Kiyomotobushi\" were also influences on the development of kabuki. \n1842-1868.\nIn the 1840s, repeated drought led to a series of fires. It affected kabuki theaters made of wood. When the area of Nakamura-za was destroyed in 1841, the \"sh\u014dgun\" refused to allow the theatre to be rebuilt. \nAfter the restoration of the Emperor in 1888, kabuki was influenced by foreign culture, stimulated by the rise of new drama. \nPost-war to modern day kabuki.\nIn the Sh\u014dwa period, from 1926 to 1989, performances began in other countries. The Empire Theater in Japan was reconstructed, and renamed the National Theater. In 1954, the East Side Theater was constructed, and kabuki was shown from it on TV. In 1965, Kabuki was seen as an important cultural heritage. After World War II, the Japanese came to see that Kabuki as an important part of their culture. Many actors became famous people in Japan.\nActors.\nWoman kabuki actors are rare though there was \"onnakabuki\". The \"onnakabuki\" is woman\u2019s kabuki. Now the men play both male and female roles.\nThere are famous kabuki actors in Japan such as Danjuro Ichikawa, Ebizo Ichikawa and Koshiro Matsumoto. Danjuro Ichikawa is an especially famous kabuki actor. He started \"aragoto\" at the age only of 14. The \"aragoto\" is a kabuki genre dealing with a brave warrior, a fierce god, or a demon. He also wrote kabuki plays under the name of Hyogo Mimasuya.\nThe name of a kabuki actor usually is passed on from one generation to the next. Therefore the name of an actor is passes to the next generation. Kabuki actors do not perform only kabuki but also act in TV drama and movies. Koshiro Matsumoto often appears on TV.\nTheater design.\nKabuki theaters are very unique. In the Genroku era, kabuki was influenced by \"nou\" or \"kyougen\" which were the theater styles made before \"kabuki\". In this period there was no roof for audiences, so that if it rained, actors could not perform. In the Edo period, all seats were covered with a roof. \n\"Mawari-butai\", a revolving stage, began in the Ky\u014dh\u014d era (1716\u20131735). Scenes are built on the revolving stage and when a new scene is needed they simply rotate the stage; it makes progress of plays move quickly and easily. Foreign theaters have copied this kabuki invention. \nOther unique system is \"hanamichi\" or \"flower path\". This is a walkway which crosses the auditorium at the same height as the stage. Actors can use this walkway to enter or leave the stage. During a play it can become many kinds of places. For example, it can be a river, a road, a corridor and so on.\nThe most famous theatre in Japan is the \"Kabuki-za\". It was built in Tokyo in 1889. It was built as western-style theater. The interior decorations were Japanese style but the outside was brick walls and it was a three-storied theater at first. The interior decorations and outside changed many time. Kabuki theaters have long histories and these were so unique.\nPlays.\nFamous authors of kabuki plays include Chikamatsu Monzaemon (1653\u20141724), Tsuruya Nanmboku (1755\u20141829), and Kawatake Mokuami (1816\u20141893). \nKabuki plays can be put into three main groups \"Jidaimono\", \"Sewamono\" and \"Shosagoto\". The \"Jidaimono\" are plays which show the world of samurais or court nobles before the Edo period. The government banned performances that showed the history of the Edo period. \"Sewamono\" are plays about the lives of the town people in the Edo period. \"Shosagoto\" are plays that feature dance.\n\"Gidayu kyogen\" or \"Maruhonmono\" are kabuki plays that were first written as puppet plays. They were turned into kabuki plays when they became famous. \"Shin kabuki\" are plays which were written by writers who did not normally write kabuki plays.\nStage makeup.\nKabuki makeup helps audiences understand each character's role. It is special and emphasizes beauty of form. If an actor plays the role of a daughter or a man in love, he must apply makeup. First, he rubs grease, which is made of canola oil and perfume, into his face. Second, he paints out eyebrow with grease. Third, he rubs face powder on chest, neck, long hair and spreads powder with sponge. Next, he rubs face powder on face with sponge. Also, he puts rouge on nose, eyes cheek and the outer corner of the eye. He paints his eyebrow from red to black and he rubs lip with red lip stick and traces the outline clearly. \nIf the actor is playing a brave man, called \"Aragoto\", he paints on rouge with red and black lines, \"Kumadori\", to show brave feelings. \"Kumadori\" is a type of kabuki's make up. It was started in 1673 by Danjyurou Ichikawa. It shows the character's role, for example, \"Sujiguma\" is one of the \"kamadori\" showing a super hero.\nCommonly used kabuki words.\nModern Japanese has many words that came from kabuki words. For example, there are three famous words; the first is an \"ohako\". \"Ohako\" means skillful things. Japanese often say the \"ohako\" is own good tune with karaoke. The \"ohako\" is derived from a word from Danjuro Ichikawa. He kept the kabuki plays of his good kabuki in a box. The \"ohako\" originated in there.\nThe second is a \"nimaime\". The \"nimaime\" means a good-looking man. The \"nimaime\" was written secondarily from the right in the signboard of the kabuki. Therefore it came to be said so.\nThe third is a \"sanmaime\". The \"sanmaime\" means a comedian. The origin of this word is the same as \"nimaime\", \"sanmaime\" was written third from the right in the signboard of the kabuki.\nToday.\nIn the 21st century, kabuki actors often perform for people who are not from Japan. The group \"Heisei Nakamuraza\", directed by Nakamura Kanzaburou, have become famous for their performances in foreign countries. They were the first traditional kabuki group to perform in New York City in 2004, with actor Nakamura Kankuro V. They used a tent as a playhouse near the opera house. The audience sat on tatami (Japanese mats). They performed \"The Summer Festival: A Mirror of Osaka\" with Japanese actors. In July 2008, \"Heisei Nakamuraza\" again performed in New York and they played in English.\nIn Australia, the Za Kabuki group at the Australian National University began performing kabuki drama each year in 1976. This is the longest regular kabuki performance outside of Japan."}

By the 1750s, it was developing into the modern trombone. It has narrower tubing, does not have a water key, a slide lock or a tuning slide that are found on trombones. It is played by buzzing the lips into a mouthpiece. The length of the instrument could be changed by the use of a sliding tube which meant it could play a full chromatic range of notes. The earliest instruments come from the 1500's. The sackbut was popular because it could be played loudly or softly, and it could also be played in tune. They were made in a range of sizes, a descant (rarely used), alto, tenor and bass. They were often played to accompany a church choir."}

It is made by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It can carry 149 to 189 passengers. It can fly for . The Boeing 727 was made to fly short distances. It can also take off from short runways at smaller airports. It has three Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D engines. One engine is at the back, and the other two are on the sides of the plane. The 727 is the only plane made by Boeing which has three engines.\nThe Boeing 727 was made after the Boeing 707. The 727 and the 707 have some similar features. The 727-100 first flew in February 1963. The first airline to use it was Eastern Air Lines. The 727-200, a longer version of the 727, first flew in July 1967. It was first used by Northeast Airlines in December 1967.\nThe 727 was made during the 1970s. The last 727 was made in 1984. In July 2011, 23 727-100s and 227 727-200s were being used by airlines. The 727 is a very noisy aircraft, so some 727s have been given hush kits to make them quieter.\nDevelopment.\nThe Boeing 727 was made to fly from small cities which had airports with shorter runways. It also carried fewer passengers. United Airlines wanted a plane with four engines so that it could fly to airports which were at high altitude. An example of an airport like this is Stapleton International Airport in Denver, Colorado. American Airlines wanted a plane with two engines. Eastern Airways wanted a plane with three engines so that it could fly to the Caribbean. The airlines decided to ask for a trijet, which is a plane with three engines.\nIn 1959, Lord Douglas said that Boeing and de Havilland Aircraft Company should work together to make trijets. Boeing made the 727 and de Havilland made the D.H.121 Trident. The two planes were quite similar, but the 727 was a bit bigger. Boeing wanted to use Allison AR963 turbofan engines for the 727. The de Havilland plane also used these engines. Boeing and de Havilland sent engineers to look at each other's designs. However, Boeing decided not to work together with de Havilland and changed the engine.\nIn 1960, Pratt &amp; Whitney wanted to sell its new JT8D turbofan engine design. United and Eastern were interested in this engine, so Pratt &amp; Whitney decided to keep designing it. Eddie Rickenbacker, from Eastern, told Boeing that the airline wanted JT8D engines for its 727s. At first, Boeing did not want to use the JT8D for the 727, but it eventually decided to use the JT8D.\nThe 727 has special parts on its wings which help it to make more lift. This means that it can take off from shorter runways than most other jets.\nLater, some longer 727s were made to carry more passengers. They replaced other jet airliners like the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8. They also replaced propeller planes like the DC-4, DC-6, DC-7 and the Lockheed Constellation.\nBoeing stopped making the 727 in 1984. 1,832 were made. 1,831 of these were given to an airline.\nDesign.\nThe 727 was meant for small airports. This meant that it would have to do without some things like stairs. Boeing built airstairs into the 727. At first, the airstairs could be opened while the plane was flying. However, D. B. Cooper, who was a hijacker, jumped out of a 727. This happened while it was flying over the Pacific Northwest. Boeing then changed the design so that the airstairs could not be opened while the plane was flying. The 727 also had an auxiliary power unit (APU). This meant that the 727 could run its systems without any power from the ground. The APU is near the undercarriage. This is quite unusual.\nOne thing which allowed the 727 to land on short runways was the design of its wings. The 727 had no engines on its wings, so flaps could be used on the full wing. There were also some other things which made more lift. Together, these things make a lift coefficient of 3.0.\nNoise.\nThe 727 is one of the noisiest airliners. The 727's JT8D engines are low-bypass. This makes them much noiser than high-bypass engines. Boeing thought about giving the 727 quieter engines. They said that the JT8D-200 engine could be used.\nAll 727s being used today need to be given a hush kit. A hush kit is something which makes a jet engine quieter. FedEx makes one of these kits. Over 60 companies have bought this. Winglets have also been made for the 727 by different companies.\n727s (including 727s which have a hush kit) are banned from some airports in Australia because of how much noise they make.\nHistory.\nThe 727 could fly to different countries as well as to places in the same country. It is useful in airports where the runway is made of gravel. Since the engines are so high up, there is not much risk that they will be damaged by things on the ground.\nThe 727 was also used by the military. Since the airstairs could be opened while the plane was flying, the Central Intelligence Agency used them to put agents and supplies into Vietnam.\nThe \"Boeing C-22\" was used by the Air National Guard and National Guard Bureau to airlift people. Three C-22B's were used. All of them belonged to the 201st Airlift Squadron, District of Columbia Air National Guard.\nThe replacement for the 727 was the Boeing 757. However, the 757 is much bigger than the 727. Because of this, some airlines replaced the 727 with the 737-800 or the Airbus A320.\nDifferent types of Boeing 727.\n\"Source:\" Boeing Aircraft since 1916\"\nThere are two types of 727. The first one is called the 727-100. Airlines began to use it in February 1964. Airlines began to use the next type, the 727-200, in December 1967.\n727-100.\nThe 727-100 first flew on February 9, 1963. United Airlines got the first plane on October 29, 1963.\n571 727-100s were made (407 -100s, 53 -100Cs, and 111 -100QCs). The last one was made in October 1972. Boeing kept one 727-100. This means that the real number is 572.\nThis type could be changed into a cargo plane and into a passenger plane.\nQC stands for \"Quick Change\". This is a 727-100C which can be changed into a cargo plane much quicker (in 30 minutes).\nQF stands for \"Quiet Freighter\". It was made for the United Parcel Service.\n727-200.\nThe 727-200 is a longer version of 727-100. The -200 is longer (153\u00a0feet, 2\u00a0inches, 46.7\u00a0m) than the \u2212100 (133 feet, 2\u00a0inches, 40.6\u00a0m).\nThe 727-200 first flew on July 27, 1967. Northeast Airlines got the first 727-200. 310 727-200s were made. The 727-200 Advanced replaced the 727-200 in 1972.\nThis type can fly for longer. It also has some improvements in the cabin.\nA type of 727-200 Advanced which could carry cargo.\nThis type has more speed. This happened because the engines were replaced with more powerful ones. It also had winglets. This type was first made by Valsan Partners, but Quiet Wing Technologies in Redmond, Washington, began to make it later.\nUsers.\n, 208 727s are still being used. These airlines have five or more 727s:\nGovernment and military.\nThe 727 has been used by some governments. The Belgian, Yugoslavian, Mexican, New Zealand, and Panama air forces have used it. The United States military also used the 727; it was called the C-22.\nAccidents.\nAs of 2010, the Boeing 727 has had 325 accidents. It has had 112 hull-loss accidents. 3,783 people have died in these. The 727 has been hijacked 178 times, and 345 people have died in these.\nOrders and deliveries.\nInformation from:\n727 models.\nBoeing "}

The Ottomans were commanded by 21-year-old Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II, who defeated an army commanded by Byzantine Emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos. The conquest of Constantinople followed a 53-day siege started on 6 April 1453.\nThis event marks the end of the Byzantine Empire, and so it was the end of the Roman Empire, which had lasted for nearly 1,500 years. Previous Sultans had taken most of the Empire in previous centuries. Some places, like the Morea Despotate and Empire of Trebizond were not defeated by the Ottomans until several years later.\nThe fall of Constantinople had important results, because the Ottoman Turks at last had control of the Balkans. Nothing could stop them from further Muslim conquests in Europe, which went on until after the Battle of Vienna in 1683. After the fall of Constantinople and the Byzantine empire, many refugees escaped to Western Europe and helped create humanism. In particular, the arrival in Italy of Greek scholars is said to have helped the Renaissance."}

It is written in short as the Greek letter \"rho\" (formula_1) or sometimes as formula_2. It is a number that shows how closely two sets of data are linked. It only can be used for data which can be put in order, such as highest to lowest.\nThe general formula for formula_2 is formula_4.\nFor example, if you have data for how expensive different computers are, and data for how fast the computers are, you could see if they are linked, and how closely they are linked, using formula_2.\nWorking it out.\nStep one.\nTo work out formula_2 you first have to \"rank\" each piece of data. We are going to use the example from the intro of computers and their speed.\nSo, the computer with the lowest price would be rank 1. The one higher than that would have 2. Then, it goes up until it is all ranked. You have to do this to both sets of data.\nStep two.\nNext, we have to find the \"difference\" between the two ranks. Then, you multiply the difference by itself, which is called squaring. The difference is called formula_7, and the number you get when you square formula_7 is called formula_9.\nStep three.\nCount how much data we have. This data has ranks 1 to 5, so we have 5 pieces of data. This number is called formula_10.\nStep four.\nFinally, use everything we have worked out so far in this formula: formula_11.\nformula_12 means that we take the total of all the numbers that were in the column formula_9. This is because formula_14 means total.\nSo, formula_12 is formula_16 which is 4. The formula says multiply it by 6, which is 24.\nformula_17 is formula_18 which is 120.\nSo, to find out formula_2, we simply do formula_20.\nTherefore, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient is 0.8 for this set of data.\nWhat the numbers mean.\nformula_2 always gives an answer between \u22121 and 1. The numbers between are like a scale, where \u22121 is a very strong link, 0 is no link, and 1 is also a very strong link. The difference between 1 and \u22121 is that 1 is a positive correlation, and \u22121 is a negative correlation. A graph of data with a formula_2 value of \u22121 would look like the graph shown except the line and points would be going from top left to bottom right.\nFor example, for the data that we did above, formula_2 was 0.8. So this means that there is a positive correlation. Because it is close to 1, it means that the link is strong between the two sets of data. So, we can say that those two sets of data are \"linked\", and go \"up\" together. If it was \u22120.8, we could say it was \"linked\" and as one goes up, the other goes down.\nIf two numbers are the same.\nSometimes, when ranking data, there are two or more numbers that are the same. When this happens in formula_2, we take the mean or average of the ranks that are the same. These are called \"tied\" ranks. To do this, we rank the tied numbers as if they were not tied. Then, we add up all the ranks that they would have, and divide it by how many there are. For example, say we were ranking how well different people did in a spelling test.\nThese numbers are used in exactly the same way as normal ranks."}

The dogs have swelling and pain of the upper breathing passages. It can be caused by viral infections such as canine distemper, canine adenovirus, canine parainfluenza virus, or canine respiratory coronavirus, or bacterial infections such as \"Bordetella bronchiseptica\". It is called kennel cough because the infection can spread very quickly among dogs, who live together as in a kennel or an animal shelter.\nInfection.\nBoth viral and bacterial causes of kennel cough are spread through the air by infected dogs sneezing and coughing. It can also be spread through contact with things that have the bacteria or virus on them. It can still be spread days or weeks after symptoms disappear. Symptoms usually begin about 3 to 5 days after the dog is around the infected animal or object. The disease can turn into pneumonia.\nSymptoms.\nSymptoms can include a harsh, dry coughing, retching, sneezing, snorting (noise made with the nose), gagging or vomiting in response to light pressing of the trachea or after excitement or exercise. The symptoms are caused by the inflammation of the airways. It can increase after excitement or exercise because of the quick breathing that takes place which causes the nerves of airway to become more stimulated. A fever is not always present. The disease can last 10\u201320 days and can come back when the dog is put into a stressful situation which puts stress on the dog's immune system. Medical diagnosis is made by seeing these symptoms, having a history of exposure is also helpful but not always found as kennel cough is easily spread through contact with the ground, toys, sidewalks, dog parks.\nTreatment and prevention.\nAntibiotics are given to treat any bacterial infection present. Cough suppressants are used if the cough is not productive (nothing is being coughed up). The usual outcome is good. Prevention is by vaccinating for canine adenovirus, distemper, parainfluenza, and \"Bordetella\". In kennels, the best prevention is to keep all the cages clean. Most kennels will not board dogs without proof of vaccination."}

It is in the southern portion of Nevada in the western United States, 83 miles (133\u00a0km) north-northwest of downtown Las Vegas. At its center, on the southern shore of Groom Lake, is a large military airfield. The base's primary purpose is to support development and testing of experimental aircraft and weapons systems. The base is in the United States Air Force's Nevada Test and Training Range NTTR, formerly called the Nellis Air Force Range NAFR. Although the facilities at the range are managed by the 99th Air Base Wing at Nellis Air Force Base, the Groom facility appears to be run as an adjunct of the Air Force Flight Test Center AFFTC at Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert, around 186 miles (300\u00a0km) southwest of Groom, and as such the base is known as Air Force Flight Test Center Detachment 3.\nThough the name Area 51 is used in official Central Intelligence Agency documentation, other names used for the facility include Dreamland, Paradise Ranch, Home Base, Watertown Strip, Groom Lake, and most recently Homey Airport. The area is part of the Nellis Military Operations Area, and the restricted airspace around the field is referred to as R- 4808N, known by the military pilots in the area as \"The Box\" or \"the Container \".\nThe facility is not a conventional airbase, as frontline operational units are not normally deployed there. It instead appears to be used for highly classified military/defense Special Access Programs SAP, which are unacknowledged publicly by the government, military personnel, and defense contractors. Its mission may be to support the development, testing, and training phases for new aircraft weapons systems or research projects. Once these projects have been approved by the United States Air Force or other agencies such as the CIA, and are ready to be announced to the public, operations of the aircraft are then moved to a normal air force base. \nThere was intense secrecy surrounding the base. The U.S. government did not acknowledge its existence until July 14, 2003. This secrecy made it the frequent subject of fiction and conspiracy theories and a central component to unidentified flying object (UFO) folklore. Testing the U-2 plane in the 1950s \u2013 at altitudes much higher than commercial aeroplanes then flew \u2013 provoked \"a tremendous increase in reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs)\". \nThe presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said she would release information about Area 51, as long as it did not threaten national security.\nIn July 2019, more than 1,700,000 people responded to a joke proposal to storm Area 51 which appeared in an anonymous Facebook post. A further 1,300,000 people said they were interested in the event, scheduled for 20 September 2019, and billed as \"Storm Area 51, They Can't Stop All of Us\", an attempt to \"see them aliens.\""}

Characters include Fagin, Nancy, Bill Sykes, and the Artful Dodger. The book is one of the earliest examples of the social novel.

It is likely that Dickens's own early youth as a child labourer contributed to the story's development. The book influenced American writer Horatio Alger, Jr. and his stories of poor boys living on the streets of nineteenth-century New York City.\nThe book has been adapted to a popular musical play called \"Oliver!\" and several movies, notably a 1948 production starring Alec Guiness as Fagin.

He grew up there. His father was a newspaper editor and he taught the young boy most subjects. His mother played the piano. The family bought a grand piano, which was the first grand piano ever to be taken across the Allegheny Mountains.\nEthelbert showed musical promise when he was very young. His brother and cousins were also musical. When he was four he was playing the piano with cushions on the floor so that he could reach the pedals. His father took him to Dresden for two years to study music. He also studied in Pittsburgh and in Boston.\nHe started his career giving piano lessons. When he had earned enough money he went to Berlin where he had lessons from Karl Klindworth, who was a good teacher for him. He showed Nevin how important it was to have a good general knowledge, and not just to spend hours and hours practising the piano. This helped Nevin, who had good tastes in literature and he chose some good poems to make into songs.\nIn 1885 he was invited to join a group who had lessons from Hans von B\u00fclow. He played works by of Brahms, Liszt, and Raff. Cosima Wagner and Joseph Joachim often came to the concerts given by this group.\nIn 1887 he went back to America and lived in Boston, where he taught and played in some concerts. He asked Richard Strauss to teach him composition but Strauss did not accept him.\nIn 1892 he went to Paris, where he taught singing, and helped many American and French opera singers to learn their parts for singing in operas. He worked very hard and his health got bad. He spent his last years in several European places and then he went back to America. He died in 1901.\nHis music.\nNevin's music is romantic, and sometimes rather sentimental for modern tastes. His best known piece is \"Narcissus\" from \"Water Scenes\". These pieces were used by the dancer Isadora Duncan to dance to. He also wrote a famous song called \"The Rosary\" and \"Mighty Lak' a Rose\".\nNevin was pictured on a 1940 ten cent U.S. postage stamp."}

It can grow to more than and is the tallest flowering plant in the world.\nDescription.\nIt is an evergreen tree, the tallest eucalyptus tree, growing 70\u2013120\u00a0m (230\u2013400 feet) tall. It has a straight, grey trunk with smooth bark. The leaves are narrow, curved, and end in a point, like a sickle. They grow up to long and wide. They are green to grey-green with a red stalk. The flowers are in groups of 9-15 together, each flower about 1 cm (0.5\u00a0in) diameter with a ring of many white stamens. The fruit is a hard nut, up to 9\u00a0mm (0.5\u00a0in) long and 7\u00a0mm (0.4\u00a0in) wide.\nHabitat.\nMountain Ash are found in cool, deep soiled, mountain areas to above sea level, with high rainfall of over each year. They grow very quickly, at more than a metre (3 feet) a year, and can reach in 50 years. They live for an average life-span of 400 years. The fallen logs continue supporting a rich variety of life for centuries more on the forest floor.\nUnusually for a eucalypt, Mountain Ash does not regrow after fire. They grow only from seed which are released from their woody gumnuts by heat. The seedlings need a lot of light, much more than reaches the forest floor normally when there are mature trees blocking the sun. Severe fires can kill all the trees in a forest, which causes a massive release of seed to take advantage of the nutrients in the ash bed. Up to 2.5 million seedlings per have been recorded after a major fire. Competition and natural thinning slowly reduces the number of mature trees to about 30 to 40 per hectare. Because it takes roughly 20 years for seedlings to reach become old enough to make seeds, repeated fires in the same area can cause local extinctions. If, however, there are no fires to release seeds, the trees die off after about 400 years and are replaced by other species.\nTall trees.\n\"Eucalyptus regnans\" is the tallest of all flowering plants, and possibly the tallest of all plants, although no living trees can make that claim. The tallest tree, named \"Centurion\", stands 99.6 metres tall in Tasmania. There are 16 living trees in Tasmania that have been measured taller than 90 metres. The tallest tree ever found was the \"Ferguson Tree\", at 132.6 metres, found in the Watts River region of Victoria in 1872. It had fallen over and was measured by William Ferguson, the Inspector of State Forests. The top of the tree had broken off, but the trunk was still more than one metre in diameter. Ferguson guessed the tree would have been more than 152 metres in height.\nUses.\n\"Eucalyptus regnans\" is valued for its timber, and large areas of trees have been cut down. The main uses are building timber and woodchipping. It also used for newsprint in the 20th century. Most of the woodchips are sent to Japan. While the area of natural stands with large old trees is rapidly decreasing, large areas of new trees exist. It is increasingly grown in plantations where the long, straight, fast growing trunks are more valuable than the old growth timber.\nThe timber is rather rough (stringy) in texture. It is easy to work and the grain is straight with long, clear sections without knots. The wood works reasonably well for steam-bending. It is used for furniture, flooring, woodpanelling, veneer, plywood, window frames and general building."}

It was the fourth cyclone of the 1996 Pacific hurricane season. It formed on June 27. During the night the depression became Tropical Storm Boris. Shortly after this, Boris rapidly became stronger. It became a hurricane. Just as an eye started to form, Boris made landfall in Mexico. It had strongest winds of 85\u00a0mph (140 kn/h). It quickly became weaker. It ended on July 1. Boris caused heavy flooding in southern Mexico. Ten deaths were reported.\nMeteorological history.\nBoris came from a tropical wave that moved off Africa on June 8. It passed near the Cape Verde Island with no convection. It went across Central America on June 23. The wave was very poorly defined on satellite images for many days. The first signs of a circulation on satellite imagery appeared on the 26th. It was about 250 miles south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. The system became a tropical depression on the 27th when convective banding increased around the center.\nAt its first advisory, it was noted that it got better organized. At that time, there were tropical storm warnings for Mexico. It was also noted the Aviation model forecast Tropical Depression Four-E to make landfall in Mexico as a weak tropical storm in 12 hours. Around that time, the forecast track was issued by the National Hurricane Center late on June 27. It said that it would receive an outflow from Hurricane Alma close by. At the same time the Ukmet model had Tropical Depression Four-E remaining offshore Mexico. The same model also had the depression becoming Tropical Storm Boris. The National Hurricane Center forecasted Tropical Depression Four-E to become Tropical Storm Boris and make landfall in Mexico with winds of . In the same advisory, it was noted that the outer rain bands of brand new Tropical Depression Four-E had moved onshore Mexico.\nThe tropical cyclone moved northwestward at 8 to 10 knots for the next two days. It became stronger from 25 knots to 80 knots during a 36-hour period. It had a ragged eye appearing on satellite imagery just before landfall on the afternoon of June 29. It had a peak intensity of . This made Boris a moderate Category 1 hurricane. The center crossed the south coast of Mexico midway between Lazaro Cardenas and Acapulco. Boris quickly became weaker. It became a depression and turned southwestward in response to a building ridge to its north. The system was disrupted by the mountainous terrain of Mexico and dissipated on the July 1 after moving back over water just south of Puerta Vallarta.\nPreparations, impact, and aftermath.\nHurricane Boris was, in general, a well-forecast storm. Due to the short time when the system was at or above tropical storm intensity, long-range forecasts were not verified. The average errors were at one and a half days in the future. As Hurricane Boris was approaching Mexico, a tropical storm watch was issued for the coast between Manzanillo and Puerto Escondido on June 28. From Manzanillo to Puerto Maldonado, the tropical storm warning changed to a hurricane warning the same day.\nDeaths and damage.\nBoris caused ten deaths. Nearby, three other people drowned and five fishermen went missing. Rain was heavy throughout the impacted region. The highest totals were in Guerrero. A total of 12.16\u00a0inches was recorded in Coyuca de Ben\u00edtez. The highest total was 14.98\u00a0in Paso de San Antonio, to the east of the point of landfall. Those rains caused a flood of the San Jeronimo River, which left at least 5,000 people without a home. Tecpan was badly hit by the storm. It reported heavy damage. This included many homes destroyed, at least one person was killed and the storm also flooded lobbies of hotels along the coast. In Acapulco a child was killed when a roof collapsed. Strong surf pushed fishing boats against a sea wall. The storm blew down trees and business signs. Streets were flooded to the level of hubcaps. A total of about 10,000 people were left homeless. At least 70 people were injured. Approximately 12 boats sunk offshore."}

He is thought to be one of the greatest violinists of his time.\nEarly Years.\nSzeryng was born in a very small village called \u017belazowa Wola in Poland. The famous composer Chopin had also been born in this village. Henryk started to learn the piano from his mother when he was five. When he was seven he changed to the violin. His violin teacher was Maurice Frenkel who had been an assistant to the famous violin teacher Leopold Auer. Four years later he went to Berlin to study with Carl Flesch who was a wonderful teacher for him. Szerynk later said: \u201cEverything I know about the violin I learned from him. After three years he went to Paris to have lessons with Jacques Thibaud at the Paris Conservatory. He got the first prize in 1937. He also studied composition in Paris with Nadia Boulanger, and continued studying with her until 1939.\nCareer.\nHe gave his first solo performance on 6 January 1933 playing the Brahms Violin Concerto with the Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra. Szeryng spoke seven languages fluently, so when World War II broke out he became an official interpreter for the Polish government which was based in exile in London. He went with the prime minister to Mexico to find a home for refugees. During the war he gave more than 300 concerts for Allied troops all over the world. During one of these concerts in Mexico City he was given the job of being head of the string department of the university there.\nIn 1946, he became a naturalized citizen of Mexico.\nSzeryng spent several years teaching the violin. Then the pianist Artur Rubinstein told him he ought to perform again, so in 1954 he started to give concerts once more. He spent the rest of his life touring all over the world playing the violin. He made many recordings, and also played many works by Mexican composers, helping them to make their music better known. He became Mexico\u2019s special advisor at UNESCO in Paris. He continued to spend some time teaching, especially in Mexico. He owned several wonderful violins, some of which he gave away.\nHe died in Kassel. \nHis playing.\nSzeryng is remembered for the beautiful tone that he made. He had an amazing technique. He always played very precisely in tune, even \u201cbending\u201d notes slightly to make his intonation very expressive. He could get different qualities of sound by turning the bow slightly or by changing the speed of his vibrato. He was able to play with great emotion in a very individual way. "}

A system that is in equilibrium does not change. The word has been used for different concepts from different fields of study. \nChemical equilibrium.\nChemical equilibrium is an idea which describes the behavior of chemical reactions over time. In reactions that have finished reacting and have attained equlibrium, the concentrations of the reactant and product chemicals do not change. An example of an equilibrium reaction is as follows: \nformula_1\nIn the example above, the double arrow shows that the reaction is an equilibrium reaction. This means that the forward reaction and the backward reaction can happen, usually due to a small enthalpy change in each reaction. Hence, the amount of product chemicals to reactant chemicals remains a fixed value, and such a ratio is called the equilibrium constant (Kc). \nEquilibrium constant.\nThe equilibrium constant is a ratio of the concentration of the products raised to the appropriate powers to the concentration of the reactants raised to the appropriate powers. In the above example, the equilibrium constant is as follows: \nformula_2\nFor some reactions, the equilibrium constant is very large, in which case nearly all of the reactant chemical is turned into products, such as when paper is burned. For other reactions, it is very small, which results in very little products being formed. If the equilibrium constant is close to 1, a mixture of both products and reactants is expected at equilibrium. \nWhen chemists talk about equilibrium constants, they call reactions with large K values favorable and reactions with small K values unfavorable. It is important to note, however, these terms are not judgements about the value or usefulness of a particular chemical reaction. In fact, some very important reactions are actually \"unfavorable\"; one such example is the synthesis of ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen gas (Haber process), which has a rather small equilibrium constant. \nUnderstanding how chemical equilibriums work is important as it helps in understanding how a reaction happens. It allows chemists to calculate how much products will be formed from a reaction. \nLe Chatelier's principle.\nThe concept of Le Chatelier's principle is important in predicting how an equilibrium will change when different factors are changed in a system. For example, using the Le Chatelier's principle, we are able to predict how the position of equilibrium will change when the concentration of a certain reactant/product has changed, as the system will try to counteract the change by favoring either the forward or the backward reaction\nAn exception to this rule is when an outside energy source forces the reaction to occur in the opposite direction, such as when a battery is recharged. Knowing the equilibrium constant of a reaction also helps you to understand the flow of energy that occurs during the reaction (thermodynamics)."}

Some computers and networks do not use packets to communicate. But most currently do, including nearly all computers on the Internet. Packets allow many computers on a network to communicate more quickly and easily.\nStructure.\nA packet consists of two kinds of data: packet information and packet \"data\" (or \"payload\"). If you think of a packet like a letter in the mail, the \"control information\" is like the outside of the envelope. There's an address that says where to send the letter, and a stamp that says how to send it (fast or slow). Similarly, the computer uses the \"control information\" in the packet to decide where, and how, to send the data. People aren't usually interested in the control information.\nThe \"user data\" is like the inside of the envelope. It is the actual information the computer is trying to send. This might be any kind of digital data, such as words, pictures, music, or computer programs. It's generally for people or computers to use, but not for the packet system to use. \nDifferent communication protocols put the control information and user information in different places, or make it look different. But they still do the same thing.\nProblems.\nSometimes the computers make mistakes while transmitting data, or have trouble \"hearing\" each other. So many packets use a checksum or cyclic redundancy check to make sure they have the right information. This is usually one component of the control information. This helps to make sure the packets themselves have the right information. But then computers also need to get the right packets.\nDesigning computer networks can be difficult. Even though today's computers are very advanced, sometimes information doesn't arrive where it's supposed to. Sometimes computers try to fix this and end up sending it twice.

One can measure the same thing again and again, and collect all the data together. This allows us to do statistics on the data. What is meant by errors and residuals is the difference between the observed or measured value and the real value, which is unknown. \nIf there is only one random variable, the difference between statistical errors and residuals is the difference between the mean of the population against the mean of the (observed) sample. In that case the residual is the difference between what the probability distribution says, and what was actually measured.\nSuppose there is an experiment to measure the height of 21-year-old men from a certain area. The mean of the distribution is 1.75\u00a0m. If one man chosen at random is 1.80\u00a0m tall, the \"(statistical) error\" is 0.05\u00a0m (5\u00a0cm); if he is 1.70 tall, the error is \u22125\u00a0cm.\nA residual (or fitting error), on the other hand, is an observable \"estimate\" of the unobservable statistical error. The simplest case involves a random sample of \"n\" men whose heights are measured. The \"sample\" mean is used as an estimate of the \"population\" mean. Then we have:\nThe sum of the residuals within a random sample must be zero. The residuals are therefore \"not independent\". The sum of the statistical errors within a random sample need not be zero; the statistical errors are independent random variables if the individuals are chosen from the population independently.\nIn sum:"}

They have three albums called \"Incredibad\", \"Turtleneck and Chain and The Wack Album.\" \nBackground.\nThe three members of the Lonely Island (Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer, and Jorma Taccone) all grew up in Berkeley, California, and met in junior high school. The three friends moved to Los Angeles and rented an apartment, which they called the Lonely Island.\n\"Saturday Night Live\".\nWith increasing recognition, the trio was invited to write parts of the 2005 MTV Movie Awards, which Jimmy Fallon was hosting. Impressed with their material, he brought them to the attention of Lorne Michaels, the producer of \"Saturday Night Live\", who agreed to see them. \nSamberg auditioned for the show. He was the only member of TLI who had also been doing stand-up comedy in his free time He was called back for a second audition a few weeks later and was invited to be a cast member; Schaffer and Taccone were invited to join the writing staff based on their work in the trio. Since their arrival on \"SNL\", the group has written some of the most popular bits in recent \"SNL\" history, most notably, the \"SNL\" Digital Shorts. \nMacGruber.\nThe group also made the skit \"MacGruber\", in which Will Forte plays a MacGyver parody as the main character. In every episode, MacGruber is trapped with his helpers, played by Kristen Wiig (originally Maya Rudolph) and a third person, usually the episode's host and occasionally Richard Dean Anderson as MacGyver, in a room with a bomb that is about to explode. \nMacGruber starts asking for simple objects to make something to stop the bomb, but he is later distracted by something (usually involving his personal life) that makes him run out of time.

{"id": "188309", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=188309", "title": "Portal (video game)", "text": "Portal is a puzzle video game made by Valve Corporation set inside the \"Half-Life\" series. It was originally sold in \"The Orange Box\", a game collection deal which came with the Valve-made games \"Portal\", \"Half-Life 2\", and \"Team Fortress 2\". It is now sold by itself and is available for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Mac and PC.\nThe player plays as a woman named Chell who has to go though tests while being watched by a computer named GLaDOS, an acronym for Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System. GLaDOS provides all of the game's dialog and is known for being clever, funny, and sarcastic, promising the player character a cake if all of the tests are finished. GLaDOS and the testing rooms were created by a company called Aperture Science, which competes with Black Mesa. The player must use a gun, called the Portal Gun, that makes two linked holes, called portals, to solve puzzles. The two portals, one blue and one orange, are linked together and let the player get from one place to another. When the player enters the blue portal, they will come out of the orange portal. When the player enters the orange portal, they will come out of the blue portal.\nPortal has many jokes in it that have become popular on the internet, for example, \"the cake is a lie\". Because the game was very popular, Valve made a sequel in 2011, called \"Portal 2\".\nPlot.\nThe game starts with Chell waking up in a small glass room that has only a bed, a toilet, and a radio inside. She is told by GLaDOS that testing will start soon, and an orange portal opens on one of the walls. Once the player goes through, she enters the testing rooms and begins testing. There are 20 testing rooms, called Test Chambers, in all.\nThe tests start out simple. Chell has to pick up boxes, called Weighted Storage Cubes (Cubes for short), and put them on buttons, which will open the door to the exit of the chamber. At this point, GLaDOS speaks to Chell as a guide, praises her, and promises her cake when the tests are over. Near the beginning of the game, Chell gets the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, also known as the Portal Gun. At first, her Portal Gun only makes blue portals and the orange portals are made by GLaDOS. Later, Chell gets the full Portal Gun and can make both blue and orange portals.\nThe tests become more and more dangerous farther into the game. In some rooms, there is poison on the floor. In others, there are balls of electricity called High Energy Pellets which will kill Chell if she touches them. During these tests, GLaDOS becomes more and more sarcastic, giving Chell useless advice, such as \"The floor here will kill you. Try to avoid it.\" At one point, GLaDOS tells Chell a chamber is broken and she must go through a chamber full of sentry guns, called Turrets, instead. If a Turret sees Chell, it will shoot at her until she dies. In this chamber is a hidden room. In the hidden room are drawings and writing on the walls left by an unknown person. The writing says things like \"the cake is a lie\" and \"she's always watching\" with a picture of a camera. There are more rooms like this in later chambers.\nIn another chamber, Chell has to use the Weighted Companion Cube, which looks like a Weighted Storage Cube with hearts on it, to solve the test. During the test, GLaDOS tells Chell several times that the Companion Cube is not alive, but at the end of the test, she tells Chell she has to \"kill\" the Companion Cube to get to the next test. \nDuring the last test, Chell has to stand on a moving platform. At the end of the platform's track, it will carry her into a fire pit. GLaDOS thanks Chell for doing the tests. At the last minute, Chell uses her Portal Gun to escape the trap. While trying to escape the building, Chell is led into a room where she finds GLaDOS. Chell breaks a white ball that fell out of GLaDOS. GLaDOS tells her she was stupid to break it because they did not know what it was, but GLaDOS quickly figures out it was her morality core. She tells Chell the people who worked for Aperture Science installed it to make her stop killing them with \"Deadly Neuro-Toxin\". Because Chell broke it, GLaDOS can use the Neuro-Toxin again. Chell has a time limit of 6 minutes to kill GLaDOS before the Neuro-Toxin kills Chell. After breaking pieces off of her and burning them, GLaDOS is destroyed and Chell escapes the building. \nAfter Chell escapes, she faints, and a robot drags her back into the building. During the credits, GLaDOS sings a song called \"Still Alive\" written by Jonathan Coulton, that says even though Chell killed her, she is still alive.\nGameplay.\n\"Portal\" is a first-person shooter game, which means that it is played from the view of the player character, Chell. When players get the fully-powered portal gun, they can make two portals that are linked together on some white surfaces. Chell starts out with nothing, only able to do what GLaDOS lets her, such as entering portals created by GLaDOS and using cubes that GLaDOS gives her. Once Chell gets a half-powered portal gun, she can fire a blue portal that connects to orange portals that GLaDOS puts in the rooms. When Chell gets the fully-powered portal gun, she can put both portals anywhere. \nThe portals are linked, making a tunnel that Chell can walk through. The tunnel works in both directions, so if Chell enters a blue portal, she will exit from an orange portal, and if she enters an orange portal, she will exit from a blue portal. The purpose of the portals is to make shortcuts to different areas, for example, if the player needs to get to a high ledge but is unable to jump to it, they can put a blue portal at their level and fire an orange portal above the ledge. Going through those portals will get the player onto the ledge.\nThe portals can be used in different ways, notably as a way to catapult Chell. If the player cannot put a portal on a high ledge but can put one on a wall across from the ledge and one on the floor below, these portals can be used to propel Chell forward far enough to reach the ledge. This is because portals do not affect forward momentum. When Chell enters the portal in the floor and exits the portal in the wall, she will fall, gaining speed. If she goes through the portal on the floor again while falling, she will be going fast enough that when she exits the wall portal again, she will be able to land on the ledge.\nThe different ways the portals work together mean there are multiple ways to solve the puzzles in the Test Chambers."}

{"id": "188342", "revid": "1025654", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=188342", "title": "Naked mole rat", "text": "The naked mole rat (\"Heterocephalus glaber\"), (or sand puppy) is a burrowing rodent. The species is native to parts of East Africa. It is one of only two known eusocial mammals (the other is the Damaraland mole rat). Both species are similar in many respects. \nThe animal has unusual features, adapted to its harsh underground environment. \nThe animals do not feel pain in their skin. They also have a very low metabolism.\nPhysical description.\nTypically, the animals are between eight and ten centimetres long, and weigh about 30\u00a0grams. Their eyes are quite small, and they do not see very well. Their legs are thin and short. Nevertheless, they are very good at moving underground and can move backward as fast as they can move forward. They have large, protruding teeth, which they use to dig. Their lips are sealed just behind the teeth to prevent soil from filling their mouths while digging. They have little hair and wrinkled pink or yellowish skin.\nThe naked mole rat is well adapted for the limited availability of oxygen within the tunnels that are its habitat: its lungs are very small and its blood has a very strong affinity for oxygen, increasing the efficiency of oxygen uptake. It has a very low respiration and metabolic rate for an animal of its size, about two thirds that of a mouse of the same size. It only uses very little oxygen. In long periods of hunger, such as a drought, its metabolic rate can reduce by up to twenty-five percent.\nThe naked mole rat can only regulate its body temperature in the typical mammalian fashion over a relatively narrow range of temperatures. Outside this range, it overheats or cools. It can overcome this by its behaviour. When cold, naked mole rats huddle together or bask in the shallow parts of their burrow systems. When they get too hot, they retreat to the deeper, cooler parts of their tunnel system.\nEcology and behavior.\nDistribution and habitat.\nThe naked mole rat is native to the drier parts of the tropical grasslands of East Africa, mainly South Ethiopia, Kenya, and Somalia.\nColonies averaging 75-80 individuals live together in complex systems of burrows in arid African deserts. The tunnel systems built by naked mole rats can stretch up to two or three miles in cumulative length.\nSocial structure and reproduction.\nThe naked mole rat is one of the two species of mammals that are eusocial. Only one female (the queen) and one to three males reproduce, while the rest of the members of the colony are workers. Workers do different things. Some are tunnellers, expanding the large network of tunnels within the burrow system, and some primarily as soldiers, protecting the group from outside predators.\nThis eusocial organisation social structure, similar to that found in ants, termites, and some bees and wasps, is very rare among mammals. \nThe relationships between the queen and the breeding males may last for many years. \"Reproductive suppression\" causes the other females not to reproduce: the infertility in the working females is only temporary, and not genetic. Queens live from 13 to 18 years, and are extremely hostile to other females behaving like queens, or producing hormones for becoming queens. When the queen dies, another female takes her place, sometimes after a violent struggle with her competitors.\nMales and females are able to breed at one year of age. Gestation is about 70 days. A litter is usually from three to twelve pups, but may be as large as 28. The average litter size is 11. In the wild, naked mole-rats usually breed once a year, if the litter survives. In captivity, they breed all year long and can produce a litter every 80 days. The young are born blind and weigh about 2 gm. The queen nurses them for the first month; after which the other members of the colony feed them feces until they are old enough to eat solid food.\nDiet.\nNaked mole rats feed primarily on very large tubers (weighing as much as 1000 times the body weight of a typical mole rat) that they find deep underground through their mining operations, but also eat their own feces (coprophagia). A single tuber can provide a colony with a long-term source of food\u2014lasting for months, or even years, as they eat the inside but leave the outside, allowing the tuber to regenerate. Symbiotic bacteria in their intestines help them digest the fibres. \nLongevity.\nThe naked mole rat is also of interest because it is extraordinarily long-lived for a rodent of its size (up to 28 years) and holds the record for the longest living rodent. The secret of their longevity is debated, but is thought to be related to the fact that they can shut down their metabolism during hard times, and so prevent oxidative damage. This has been summed up as \"They're living their life in pulses\".\nDue to their extraordinary longevity for such a small rodent, an international effort was put into place to sequence the genome of the naked mole rat. Results came in 2011 and 2014. Transcriptome sequencing showed that genes related to mitochondria and oxidation reduction processes have high expression levels in the naked mole-rat as compared to mice. This may contribute to their longevity.\nThe DNA repair transcriptomes of the liver of humans, naked mole rats and mice were compared. The maximum lifespans of humans, naked mole rats, and mice are respectively ~120, 30 and 3 years. The longer-lived species, humans and naked mole rats, expressed DNA repair genes at a higher level than did mice. In addition, several DNA repair pathways in humans and naked mole rats were up-regulated compared with mice. These findings suggest that increased DNA repair makes for greater longevity. The findings are consistent with the DNA damage theory of aging.\nConservation status.\nNaked mole rats are not threatened. Despite their tough living conditions, naked mole rats are quite widespread and numerous in the drier regions of East Africa."}

These trains do not run on the London Underground anymore as they were replaced by the London Underground 2009 tube stock between 2010 and 2011. The stock was built by Metro-Cammell. The trains have also ran on the Woodford\u2013Hainault section of the Central Line in the past.\nBackground.\nAn order to buy 30\u00bd 8-car trains of 1967 tube stock was made in March 1964. They were built by Metro-Cammell. Each train is made up of two 4-car units that are joined. The trains cost \u00a32.25 million to build. Today this would buy just three trains. The first unit was delivered to West Ruislip depot on 27 September 1967, and the fleet was bought to run the Victoria Line. The units were then tested at the depot, before they were moved to Hainault depot and being tried out in passenger service on the Woodford-Hainault shuttle on the Central line. Once the tests were finished, the trains were moved from Hainault to Northumberland Park Depot using a battery locomotive. The trains were looked after at this depot until they were scrapped. It is the only part of the Victoria line that is not Underground, and it is unusual because, unlike the rest of the London Underground network, there is a staff rail link from Seven Sisters station.\nThe Trains.\nThe trains had Automatic Train Operation (ATO). The train operator controls when the doors open and close and also starts the train by pressing two buttons at the same time. These buttons start the automatic process of driving the train. The trains were built with wrap-around windows in the driving cabs and were the first London Underground trains to have windows like this. The trains were delivered with a shiny grey coat, but this soon faded to a dull grey.\nWhen the extension Victoria line to Brixton opened in July 1971, a further 72 cars of 1967 tube stock were ordered, which made up 9 trains. This brought the total number of 1967 tube stock trains to 39\u00bd.\nRefurbishment.\nIn 1989, a refurbishment programme was started across the whole fleet of London Underground rolling stock, following the King's Cross fire in 1987. The Victoria line stock was chosen to be the first to be refurbished (repaired, changed and made to look newer). The refurbishment was carried out by Tickford Rail at Rosyth Dockyard. The refurbishment was due to take 5 years to complete, but the last train did not leave the works until 1997, because each train was slightly different to the next train. When the trains had completed the refurbishment the outside was painted in a white, blue and red colour scheme. The insides of the trains have fire-resistant materials and are finished in the Victoria line blue colours, though some have the Bakerloo line brown as they run on that line too.\nReplacement.\nThe last 1967 stock in passenger service ran on 30th June 2011. It has been replaced by 2009 stock."}

It is built by Bombardier Transportation at their Litchurch Lane Works in Derby, England. The stock belongs to Bombardier's \"Movia\" type of train. Bombardier Transportation UK used to be known as ADtranz, and before that ABB Asea Brown Boveri. ABB Asea Brown Boveri built the 1992 tube stock which is currently used on the Central and Waterloo &amp; City lines.\nForty-seven 8-car units will be built for use on the Victoria line. These replace the line's original 1967 tube stock. The trains are still being built. They were introduced by 2012, when all of the 1967 tube stock trains were completely replaced. The first 2009 tube stock train started running on the line with passengers on board on 21 July 2009. One new train will enter service every two weeks from early 2010.\nDescription.\nThe trains are part of a 3.4 billion pound contract that was awarded to Bombardier by Metronet. The contract was to supply new trains featuring Automatic Train Operation and signalling for the Victoria and sub-surface lines. When it is finished this upgrade should make the lines and trains more reliable. There should also be an 8% decrease in journey times between stations, and a 16% overall decrease in journey times. This decrease is partly because the new trains have better performance than the 1967 tube stock that they are replacing. The new trains have a higher top speed of , a faster maximum acceleration of 1.3 m/s2, a normal service deceleration of 1.14\u00a0m/s2, and an emergency brake deceleration of 1.4\u00a0m/s2. This is the same as the 1992 tube stock.\nDuring the busiest times of the day, or the \"peaks\", 43 trains should be available in service. This will be an increase of 6 trains over the 37 units of 1967 tube stock. The trains have seats for 252 people and standing space for an estimated 1196 passengers. This gives a 19% increase in capacity. The new trains also have wider doors for easier boarding and alighting (to descend or step down) of passengers to decrease the times that the trains have to wait at stations.\nThe new trains are being built wider than the current 1967 tube stock. This is because the Victoria line has a larger than normal loading gauge compared to the other deep level tube lines. The larger size means that the new trains cannot leave the Victoria line except by road as they are too wide to travel on the other London Underground deep level tube lines. This means that to move the units, each car has to be uncoupled, loaded onto a lorry, and then re-coupled when they are delivered. The trains have been built using Bombardier's technology called FICAS, which gives them a thinner bodyshell. Along with the larger size this gives more space for passengers.\nThe stock is the first to be designed since the Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations came into force. Because of this they will have more facilities for people with impaired mobility, including multi-purpose areas with tip-up seats and space for wheelchairs and pushchairs and offset centre door poles for wheelchair access.\nIntroduction.\nThe design of the trains was finalised in September 2004, and manufacture of two pre-production trains began in January 2005. The first train was scheduled to be completed by mid-2006. Metronet announced on 3 February 2006 that the first of the pre-production cars had been completed to allow it to be tested without being moved. From 21 July until 4 August 2006, an example of the train was on show at Euston Square Gardens, near Euston Square tube station, for a Customer Acceptance Test followed by public display. From September 2006, the first of the two trains underwent testing at Bombardier's manufacturing and test site at their Litchurch Lane Works in Derby. It was due to be delivered to London Underground by the end of 2006 for testing on the Victoria line during engineering hours (times after the line stops carrying passengers and repair and testing work is carried out), but this did not occur until May 2007. It will also be used for driver and maintenance training and familiarisation. The first of the trains was expected to begin passenger service for the Victoria line for evaluation purposes in July 2008, with the remainder of the fleet being delivered and entering passenger service in 2009. However, by October 2007 the date for the first train entering service had been moved to January 2009. The first train entered service on 21 July 2009, leaving Northumberland Park depot at 23:00 and forming train 277 leaving Seven Sisters at 23:55 to Brixton."}

The weak force causes beta decay, a form of radioactivity. At extremely high energy levels, the force of weak interaction and electromagnetism begin to act the same, and this is called electroweak interaction.\nBeta decay.\nBeta decay is what scientists call a neutron breaking down, in contrast with alpha decay where an atom breaks down. These types of breaking down are more commonly known as radioactive decay. In a beta decay a neutron breaks into a proton, an electron and a neutrino. However, this is not a complete picture, there is an intermediary step. Notice that this process preserves the total charge. Conservation laws are very important when calculating the possible outcomes of these interactions.\nWith more detail, beta decay begins with a neutron, which is made of one up quark and two down quarks. Since up quarks have a charge of +2/3, and each down quark has a charge of -1/3 this results as giving 2/3 -1/3 -1/3 = 0 charge. Due to weak force, if there are too many neutrons in an atom nucleus, one of the down quarks in one of the neutrons turns into an up quark. This would change the charge of the neutron from 0 to (2/3 +2/3 -1/3) = 1. From this, the neutron is no longer a neutron, but actually a proton ( a particle with a charge of +1). \nIn a strange quantum effect, this transformation releases a particle called a W boson. This is the gauge boson (force-carrying particle) of weak force. Oddly, the W boson has a mass about 80 times as much as a neutron. This sort of thing actually happens very often in quantum mechanics, but it follows the conservation of energy because it happens so quickly. After 3x10\u201325 seconds, the W boson breaks into an electron and an electron antineutrino. (The electron antineutrino doesn't really do much). This releases the electron and basically creates a proton from a neutron."}

He was one of the great conductors of his time.\nLife.\nMonteux was born in Paris and started to learn the violin when he was six. When he was nine he learned at the Paris Conservatoire. When he was twelve he conducted an orchestra in Paris with the pianist Alfred Cortot as soloist. He played in orchestras, and was the principal of the viola section in the first performance of Debussy\u2019s opera \"Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande\". He started to conduct some of the concerts in the series Concerts Colonne.\nMonteux also played his viola in chamber music. He played a string quartet by Brahms with the composer in the audience.\nMonteux soon became famous as a conductor. He conducted the orchestra for Diaghilev\u2019s Ballet Russes, conducting the first performances of Stravinskys \"'Petrouchka\", \"Rite of Spring\" as well as Ravel\u2019s \"Daphnis et Chlo\u00e9\" and Debussy\u2019s \"Jeux\". These were some of the greatest ballets of the 20th century.\nIn 1916 Monteux went to the USA and conducted the French operas at the Metropolitan Opera. In 1920 he moved to Boston, conducting many new works by Debussy, Chausson, Darius Milhaud and others. In 1924 he became assistant conductor at the Concertgebouw Orchestra, Amsterdam. He started the Orchestre Symphonique de Paris in 1929, and also a school for conducting, the \u00c9cole Monteux, in Paris. Later he continued this teaching in his American home in Maine. Neville Marriner and Andr\u00e9 Previn were two of his pupils.\nIn 1936 he became conductor of the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. He stayed with this orchestra until 1952. He made this orchestra internationally famous. In 1942 he became an American citizen. In the 1950s he often conducted the Boston Symphony Orchestra.\nMonteux continued to conduct until shortly before his death at the age of 89. In 1961 he was appointed chief conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra for 25 years, although he did not live long enough to fulfil this. He conducted this orchestra in 1963 in a performance of the \"Rite of Spring\", fifty years after he had conducted the first performance.\nMonteux\u2019s conducting.\nMonteux always prepared his work very carefully. He was not a conductor who liked to show off. He rehearsed his orchestras thoroughly, and conducted with small gestures. Although he made gramophone recordings, he did not like recordings.

It does the opposite things of the sympathetic nervous system, the other part of the autonomic nervous system. This way, the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems balance each other's effects. The sympathetic nervous system helps a person \"fight or flight\" when they are in danger. When the danger is gone, the parasympathetic nervous system lets the person \"rest and digest,\" \"feed and breed.\"\nEffects.\nThe parasympathetic nervous system has many different effects. It affects every part of the body, including:\nBecause of these effects, the parasympathetic nervous system always has to balance with the sympathetic nervous system. For example, if only the parasympathetic nervous system was working, a person's heart rate and breathing would keep getting lower and lower. Eventually the person would stop breathing or their heart would stop beating.\nHowever, in a healthy person, the brain realizes when the parasympathetic nervous system's effects are getting too strong. For example, the brain may realize that the person is breathing too slowly, or that their heart rate is too low. The brain reacts by making the sympathetic nervous system kick in. Because the sympathetic nervous system has the opposite effects, it will make the person breathe faster and raise their heart rate. These two systems have to balance each other constantly for a person to stay healthy.\nControl.\nThe parasympathetic nervous system is controlled mostly by the vagus nerve. This is an important nerve that comes from the brain and goes all the way down to the bottom of the spinal cord. The vagus nerve sends out chemical messengers called neurotransmitters - mostly one called acetylcholine. This chemical causes changes in many different parts of the body."}

It is often used to compare the efficiency of different algorithms, which is done by calculating how much memory is needed, and how much time it takes to complete.\nThe Big O notation is often used in identifying how complex a problem is, also known as the problem's complexity class. The mathematician Paul Bachmann (1837-1920) was the first to use this notation, in the second edition of his book \"Analytische Zahlentheorie\", in 1896. Edmund Landau (1877-1938) made the notation popular. For this reason, when people talk about a Landau symbols, they refer to this notation.\nBig O notation is named after the term \"order of the function\", which refers to the growth of functions. Big O notation is used to find the upper bound (the highest possible amount) of the function's growth rate, meaning it works out the longest time it will take to turn the input into the output. This means an algorithm can be grouped by how long it can take in a worst-case scenario, where the longest route will be taken every time.\nMore specifically, given two positive functions formula_1 and formula_2, we say that formula_3 is in the big O of formula_4 (written formula_5) if for large enough formula_6, formula_7 for some constant formula_8.\nBig O is an expression that finds worst-case scenario run-time, showing how efficient an algorithm is without having to run the program on a computer. This is also useful due to the fact that different computers may have different hardware, and therefore need different amounts of time to complete it. Since Big O always assumes the worst-case, it can show a consistent measurement of speed: regardless of the hardware, formula_9 is always going to complete faster than formula_10, because they have different levels of efficiency.\nExamples.\nThe following examples all use code written in Python. Note that this is not a complete list of Big O types.\nConstant.\nformula_9 always takes the same amount of time regardless of input. For example, take a function that accepts an integer (called x) and returns double its value:\nAfter accepting the input, this function will always take one step to return an output. It is constant because it will always take the same amount of time, so it is formula_9.\nLinear.\nformula_13 increases according to the size of the input, represented by formula_14. For example, for the following function that accepts n and returns every number from 1 to n:\nIf we were to input the value of 5, then this would output formula_15, requiring 5 loops to complete. Similarly, if we input 100, then it would output formula_16, requiring 100 loops to complete. If the input is formula_14, then the algorithm's run time is exactly formula_14 loops every time, therefore it is formula_13.\nFactorial.\nformula_10 increases in factorial amounts, meaning the time taken increases massively with the input. For example, say we wish to visit five cities around the world and want to see every possible ordering (permutation). An algorithm we could write using Python's itertools library is as follows:\nThis algorithm will calculate each unique permutation of our cities and then output it. Examples of output will include:\nHere, our input list is 5 items long, and for every selection our remaining options decreases by 1. In other words, our 5 inputs choose formula_21 items (or formula_22). If our input is formula_14 cities long, then the number of outputs is formula_24; in general, assuming that we go through every permutation, then we will require formula_10 loops to complete it.\nLittle-o notation.\nA related concept to big-O notation is little-o notation. Big-O is used to say that a function does not grow faster than another function, while little-o is used to say that a function grows more slowly than another function. If two functions grow at the same rate, big-O can be used but little-o cannot. The difference between big-O and little-o is similar to the difference between formula_26 and formula_27."}

It was started in 1948 and intended by its creators to be \"free at the point of service\". This meant that people who use the NHS would not be required to pay for services each time they used them.\nThe NHS is paid for out of employee contributions from their wages and also from general government money raised in the form of taxes.\nThe promise of a health service that would be free at the point of service was broken almost right away with the start of prescription charges. Prescription charges are a set price that people within England must pay for each item on a prescription form. This charge is currently \u00a38.60 for each item and is raised each year.\nThe NHS is made up of four systems: National Health Service (England), Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland, NHS Scotland and NHS Wales. Each system is run by its government. For example, National Health Service (England) is ran by the UK Government. The systems are run in different ways depending on which country within the United Kingdom a person lives in. For instance, there are no charges for prescriptions in Scotland or Wales, but there are in England.\nThe service also provides basic dental services and prescription eyeglasses, hearing aids, prosthetic limbs and other services. There are normally charges at the point of service for these services unless one lives in a no-charge country or is considered a special needs case; such as children (aged up to 18, or up to 21 if you are a student), pregnant women or the elderly.\nThe coalition government has made cuts to the NHS. On 29 September 2013 around 50,000 people protested in Manchester. They set up a stage with banners saying things like 'Save Our NHS' around it. Hospitals can now earn up to 50% of their income from private work.\nThe NHS has been criticized for working through a 'postcode lottery', meaning that access to quality treatment depends on where you live. The percentage of diabetics getting the NICE recommended levels of care ranges from 6% to 69% depending on where they live."}

Sometimes the crime is called acid attack. The attackers throw acid or other corrosive substances at their victims. Usually they throw it at the targets' faces. They want to damage skin tissue, even to expose and to dissolve the bones. The consequences of these attacks include blindness and permanent scars of the face and body.\nIn India, the number of acid attacks have been rising. There had been 68 acid attacks in Karnataka alone (of which Bengaluru is the capital) since 1999. These are only the cases that have been reported. Unlike India, Bangladesh has introduced the death penalty for throwing acid and laws strictly controlling the sales of acids since 2002. An important role for the introduction of that legislation had the Acid Survivors Foundation.\nAcid throwing is a crime in most countries in the world. Many Islamic countries have the concept of qisas, or retributive justice. With this, a victim can ask that the attacker be disfigured in a similar way. That way, an Iranian court ordered that the attacker of a woman who was blinded by such an attack, be blinded as well.\nEpidemiology.\nAccording to researchers and activists, countries with many occurrences of acid attacks include Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, United Kingdom, Kenya, South Africa, Uganda, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. Acid attacks have been reported however in countries around the world, including:\nAdditionally, evidence for acid attacks exists in other regions of the world such as South America, Central and North Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia. However, South Asian countries maintain the highest incidence of acid attacks.\nPolice in the United Kingdom have noted that many victims are scared to come forward to report attacks, meaning the nobody knows how many attacks have happened."}

They were called \"Mensheviks\". Other members of the party spoke for the dictatorship of the working class. They were called \"Bolsheviks\". The leaders of the Menshevik group were Martov and Potresov. The leaders of the Bolshevik group were Plekhanov and Lenin.\nThe Russian Social Democratic Labour Party was an illegal party. It fought against the autocracy, organized meetings and strikes, and printed illegal newspapers blaming the Tsar and his government. Many members of the party were arrested, put into prison or condemned to penal servitude.\nIn 1917 Lenin and most Bolsheviks became a separate political party, RSDLP(B), which later became the Russian Communist Party.\nDuring the Russian Civil War, the RSDLP was banned by Communists.

The problem of trying to store the negative sign (\u2212) of a binary number is that there are no states left to use with which to represent the negative assignment. It is not possible to just use 'off' for minus and 'on' for plus because the computer would have no way of knowing whether it was a digit or a sign.\nTo overcome this issue computer designers invented two methods for storing negative binary numbers: sign-and-magnitude and 2's complement. These produce alternative representations for signed numbers.\nSign-and-magnitude.\nSign and Magnitude works by changing the most significant bit (MSB - the first digit) to a 1 if the number is negative, and reduce the number by one, for example:\nwill become...\nThis method of storing negative binary numbers does not work because binary arithmetic won't work.\n1's complement.\n1's Complement works by swapping 1s for 0s and the 0s for 1s for example:\nwill become...\nMuch like the sign-and-magnitude method this is easily defined as a negative number because its most significant bit is 1\n2's complement.\n2's Complement is a more difficult way of storing negatives.

{"id": "189192", "revid": "7101359", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=189192", "title": "Floating point", "text": "Real numbers in binary have to be stored in a special way in a computer. Computers represent numbers as binary integers (whole numbers that are powers of two), so there is no direct way for them to represent non-integer numbers like decimals as there is no radix point. One way computers bypass this problem is floating-point representation, with \"floating\" referring to how the radix point can move higher or lower when multiplied by an exponent (power).\nOverview.\nIn mathematics and science, very large and very small numbers are often made simpler and multiplied to a power of ten to make them easier to understand. For example, it can be much easier to read 1.2 trillion as formula_1 than 1,200,000,000,000. This can also be used with negative powers of ten to make small numbers, meaning you can represent 0.000001 as formula_2. This process is called scientific notation.\nSince computers are limited to integers and binary, this means they cannot easily represent fractional decimal numbers. In order to represent fractional numbers, computers use three sets of binary numbers to make a scientific notation representation. They are: the signed bit, which determines if the number is positive (0) or negative (1); the significand, which is an integer (whole) version of the number; and the exponent, which is the power you multiply the base by.\nSignificand.\nThe significand is found by taking your number and moving the radix point until there is no fractional part, making it into an integer. In decimal this is making 1.45 into 145 by moving the point right 2 steps, and in binary this would be making 1101.0111 (13.4375) into 1101 0111 (215) by moving the point right 4 steps; in both cases these numbers aren't related to one another outside using the same digits in a similar ordering.\nSimilarly to how scientific notation makes the significand as basic as possible, the aim in floating point numbers is to make it an integer so it can be represented in bytes and used in calculations.\nExponent.\nThe exponent is the number of digits the radix point has moved past: if it moves left then the exponent is negative, but if it moves right then it is positive. As above, making 1.45 into 145 requires you to multiply by 100, so the exponent is 2 as formula_3. Equally, turning 1101.0111 (13.4375) into 1101 0111 (215) requires you to move the radix point four columns to the right, so the exponent is 4; this can be verified in decimal as formula_4.\nSince the process is inverted to most cases of scientific notation, as it involves making a faction into an integer rather than turning a large integer into a fraction, exponents are generally negative to move the decimal place to the left; in decimal this would be turning your integer 145 back into the fractional number 1.45 by multiplying it by formula_5. Instead of using an signed leftmost bit the exponent is instead biased, giving 32-bit float exponents a range of formula_6 to formula_7. The output value of the biased exponent can be found by adding 127 to it:\nformula_8\nformula_9\nformula_10\nExample.\nDecimal to Bicimal.\nLet's assume, for example, we want to represent the decimal number 37.40625 to its binary counterpoint: a bicimal (or binary decimal/fraction). First, we need to take our decimal number, which is in powers of 10, and convert it to binary, which is in powers of 2. One way to do this is to subtract the largest power of two possible until you reach zero:\nformula_11\nformula_12\nformula_13\nformula_14\nformula_15\nformula_16\nUsing the powers of two above, we can represent our decimal number formula_17 as follows:\nBicimal to Float.\nWe have validated that our decimal number formula_17 is represented in binary as formula_19. However, the issue with computers is that they represent numbers as integer powers of two using bits, which makes fractional and negative numbers complicated. In accordance with IEEE-754, the way this is commonly done with a computer is to create a 32-bit floating point number that consists of three parts: the sign, 1 bit to determine if our number is positive or negative; the exponent, 8 bits to represent our exponent and to which we add 127 to avoid signed bytes; and our significand, which is our binary number without a bicimal point spread across 23 bits. Since we need to move our bicimal point 5 places to make formula_20 into the significand formula_21 our exponent is formula_22. By using a 32-bit float we can represent 37.40625 like this:"}

It is based on a fake investment that one schemer (or group of schemers) gets other people to give money to.\nIn Ponzi schemes, the schemer basically says, \"I found a great way to make money fast. The more you give me, the more I can invest in that cause, and the more I can earn for us all\". But a Ponzi scheme doesn't actually \"earn money\". Instead, \"all\" of the scheme's money comes from the investors.\nOnce a Ponzi scheme gets too many investors, the system will always crash. This is because the investors all expect more money than they invested, and they will get impatient.\nThese schemes always stop one of three ways:\nThe scheme was named after a man named Charles Ponzi. He used the scheme after moving from Italy to the United States in 1903. (Ponzi didn't invent the scheme, though. In 1857, Charles Dickens wrote a book called \"Little Dorrit\" about a scheme like this. The scheme is a simple idea, and probably very old.) However, Ponzi's scheme was so big that it became the most popular. His original scheme was based on using countries' money-exchange rates to make money, based on international postage stamps. But money soon stopped being invested in coupons, and went to early investors, and a lot to Ponzi himself. \nPonzi schemes can be run anywhere, even online, and are being run even now.\nMore examples.\nPeople advertising Ponzi schemes often use impressive words, that are actually very vague. Examples are:\nSchemers often depend on investors \"not actually knowing\" about economics. The Madoff scandal of 2008 showed that even sophisticated people like bankers can fall for them. People are fooled by the schemer seeming to have financial skill or reputation. \nSometimes, the schemers claim that money can only be made if the investment is kept a secret (away from the authorities or public). For example, Bernard Madoff only allowed the accounting firm run by his brother-in-law to perform audits on his \"hedge fund\", claiming it had to be kept a secret to earn money. \nSince the investment is very vague, not many investors come very fast. But the scheme often gets speed like this:\nSchemers often try to tempt the early investors to \"re-invest\" the money they've \"earned\". Schemers sometimes send investors \"invoices\", showing investors how much they've \"earned\" and how much they'll keep \"earning\" if they keep \"investing\".\nSchemers also try to make sure new investors can't take their money back, by making the rules tighter. In this case, the schemer will often have a few investors say they kept their money, making the investment still look productive enough to be good."}

He was a composer and pianist He got involved in the musical politics of his country, which was then the Soviet Union. A lot of people hated him, especially in western countries. He is particularly remembered for what he did at the unpleasant conference in 1948, when some of the most famous Soviet composers, including Shostakovich and Prokofiev, were made to say they were sorry for the music they had written and that they would compose better music in future.\nIn the days of the Soviet Union, and especially under Stalin, musicians had to be very careful about what they did and how they composed. Music, like all arts, was supposed to make people feel that they were lucky to be living in a great country like the Soviet Union. If composers wrote music that the politicians did not like or understand, life became very difficult for them: they would not be allowed to compose, and their music could not be performed. They might even be sent to prison. Tikhon Khrennikov became Secretary to the Union of Soviet Composers in 1948, at the time when Stalin was dictator. He continued in this job until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. He made sure that all musicians obeyed their political leaders.\nIt is difficult for us today to judge the actions of Khrennikov fairly. He survived because he did what he was told by Soviet dictators. After the collapse of the Soviet Union he tried to say he was sorry for what he did. It is difficult to judge whether he really meant this.\nLife and career.\nTikhon Khrennikov was the youngest of ten children, born into a family of horse traders, in the town of Yelets in the Russian province of Lipetsk in central Russia. His family started to teach him the guitar and mandolin. When he was nine he started learning the piano, and when he was 13 he started composing. Three years later he was sent to the Gnesin Academy of Music, studying with the composer Mikhail Gnesin. In 1932 he went on to the Moscow Conservatoire. He studied composition with Vissarion Shebalin and piano with the famous teacher Heinrich Neuhauss who was later the teacher of Emil Gilels and Sviatoslav Richter.\nHis early works include a symphony, a piano concerto, and an opera based on the book \"Into the Storm\" which was based on a novel \"Loneliness\", a favourite book of Stalin. His music was always happy and energetic. He wrote music for 22 films and many patriotic songs. He did everything he could to please Stalin, and soon he became Secretary of the Union of Soviet Composers.\nIn 1948 he headed a conference at which Shostakovich, Prokofiev, Myaskovsky and Shebalin (who had been his teacher), were told that they were bad \u201cformalists\u201d. The word \u201cformalist\u201d has no meaning in music, but it was used by the politicians to describe anyone who was not obeying the politicians\u2019 guidelines. Khrennikov said at the conference that \u201cwe will stop all manifestations of formalism and popular decadence\".\nShostakovich had given Khrennikov some friendly advice about his opera \"Into the Storm\", but Khrennikov had been angry about being criticized and now he could get his own back. Shostakovich made satirical remarks about Khrennikov in an opera \"Rayok\" which he never showed to anyone and was found amongst his papers after his death in 1975.\nAfter the fall of the Soviet Union Khrennikov published a book \"That\u2019s the Way It Was\". In this book he says that everybody had to obey political rules and he was only doing what everyone else did. However, he then wrote some bad things about Shostakovich. Khrennikov had also been an enemy of the composer Alfred Schnittke. He banned his music from being played, and was furious when it was performed in other countries. He also banned music by other composers who have now become famous such as Sofia Gubaidulina and Viktor Suslin.\nKhrennikov was, however, not all bad. He supported Shostakovich and Prokofiev for getting the Stalin Prizes in the 1950s. He also invited Stravinsky, who had been exiled to the United States, to revisit the Soviet Union in 1962.\nWhen he was in his eighties, Khrennikov continued to compose many comic operas, operettas and ballets. They always had tunes that were easy for people to enjoy.\nThe Soviet state gave him many prizes for the work he did: three Stalin Prizes, a State Prize of the USSR and a Lenin Prize. Before his death he was even given an award by Vladimir Putin, which makes it seem as if Russia might be returning to its past values.\nHe died in Moscow aged 94."}

The word \"dialysis\" comes from the Greek word \"dialusis\", \"dia\" meaning through, and \"lusis\" meaning loosening.\nDialysis can be used for people who have become sick and have lost the use of their kidneys for a short time, or for people who no longer have working kidneys. The purpose of the kidney is to keep a balance of water and minerals in the body. These minerals include sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, phosphorous, magnesium and sulfate. The kidneys also take out hydrogen ions from the blood. Dialysis is able to remove these wastes from the body and help keep the minerals in balance.\nHowever the kidneys are also part of the endocrine system and make erythropoietin and calcitriol. Dialysis machines are not able to replace this part of the kidney's function.\nHow dialysis works.\nDialysis machines work by using diffusion and ultrafiltration. A very fine material, called a membrane, allows blood and fluid to flow through it. In the machine, the blood flows in one direction, and on the other side of the membrane, a special fluid, dialysate flows in the opposite direction, this process is known as osmosis. Dialysate is a fluid that has different chemicals in it, such as potassium and calcium. A doctor would decide what mixture of chemicals would be needed for each patient. The dialysate has bicarbonate in it to lower the higher acid levels that these patients often have. The blood and dialysate mix together. The waste products are removed from the blood and caught up in the fine membrane.\nDialyser.\nA dialyser is part of a dialysis machine. The dialyser filters blood like a kidney. It is made of a clear hollow cylinder with two inlets and two outlets. One inlet and outlet is at the upper side and downside which are for blood entrance and exit before and after purification. The other inlet and outlet are beside through which a supporter liquid goes into the dialyser.\nA dialyser has very thin fibres of cellulose. The fibres work as a semi-permeable membrane (SPM). There are about 10,000 of them. Impurities such as urea keratin leave through the SPM. Blood cells cannot go through because the blood cells are bigger than the impurities. The whole process of purification is supported by a liquid called dialysate. Dialysate is sent into the dialyser by the pump in the dialysis machine. The pure liquid goes in and the impure dialysate comes out. Dialysers are also called artificial kidneys."}

The libretto (words) are based on a comedy by Pierre Beaumarchais called \"The Barber of Seville\". It is Rossini\u2019s most famous opera, containing some very well known tunes.\nThe first performance took place on 20 February, 1816 inmjm Rome\nHistory of the opera.\nRossini\u2019s opera was not the first one to be based on Beaumarchais' play. The composer Giovanni Paisiello had written one with the same title, and another was composed in 1796 by Nicolas Isouard. Paisiello\u2019s opera was popular for a time, but soon Rossini\u2019s opera became famous and Paisiello\u2019s opera was forgotten.\nMozart's opera \"Le nozze di Figaro,\" composed in 1786 is also based on the same play, but it deals with the second part of the play (the play was in three parts).\nRossini is well known for being able to compose very quickly. He composed all the music for \"The Barber of Seville\" in less than three weeks. He borrowed the overture from something he had written earlier. \nWhen the opera was first performed on 20 February 1816 it was a big failure. The audience hissed and jeered the whole time, and there were several little accidents on the stage. At one point a cat walked onto the stage.\nThe second time it was performed it was a great success.\nThe story of the opera.\nAct 1.\n\"The square in front of Dr. Bartolo's house\"\nThe story takes place in the town of Seville in Spain. It is supposed to be the 17th century. In a town square outside Dr. Bartolo's house a band of musicians are serenading outside the window of Rosina. Among them is Lindoro, who is pretending to be a poor student, but he is really Count Almaviva in disguise. He hopes that Rosina will love him. He pays the musicians who then leave.\nFigaro comes in. He used to be Almaviva\u2019s servant. The aria that he sings is very famous. It is called \"Largo al factotum\". Almaviva asks him to help him meet Rosina, offering him money if he can do it. Figaro says he should disguise himself as a soldier and pretend to be drunk and to try and get into the house. \nInside Dr Bartolo\u2019s house Rosina sings a song \"Una voce poco fa\" (\"A voice just now\"). \nRosina writes to the Count, calling him Lindoro, because she thinks that is his name. As she is leaving the room, Bartolo and Basilio enter. Bartolo is suspicious of the Count, and Basilio says that they should start to tell bad stories about him to get him out of the way.\nWhen they are gone, Rosina and Figaro enter. Figaro asks Rosina to write a short note to Lindoro. She has already done this. She is surprised by Bartolo, but she manages to fool him.\nBerta, Dr Bartolo\u2019s servant, tries to leave the house. She is met by the Count disguised as an drunken soldier. Bartolo cannot get rid of the Count, who manages to have a quick word with Rosina. He whispers to her that he is called Lindoro and gives her a letter. Bartolo is watching and is suspicious. He wants to know what the letter is about, but Rosina fools him by giving him a list of things to be washed. Bartolo and the Count start arguing. Basilio, Figaro and Berta appear and the noise is heard by the Officer of the Watch and his men. Bartolo thinks that the Count has been arrested, but Almaviva tells the officer his real name and he is immediately released. Bartolo and Basilio cannot understand why this happened. Rosina laughs at them.\nAct 2.\n\"Dr. Bartolo's house\"\nAlmaviva comes to the doctor\u2019s house again. This time he is disguised as a music teacher. He is pretending that Basilio is ill and that he has come instead. At first Bartolo is suspicious but he soon lets him in when he shows him Rosina\u2019s letter. He gives Rosina a singing lesson. Bartolo thinks that Lindoro is one of the Count\u2019s servants and that he is trying to get girls for the Count. Bartolo does not want to leave him alone with Rosina, so he gets Figaro (who is a barber) to shave him.\nWhen Basilio suddenly appears, Almaviva bribes him with some money and he goes away saying he is sick. Bartolo realizes in the end that it is a trick, and gets everyone out of the room. He goes to a notary to get a marriage contract made between himself and Rosina. He shows Rosina the letter she wrote to \"Lindoro\", and makes her think that Lindoro is a servant and cunning friend of Almaviva.\nThe stage is empty while the music creates a thunder storm. The Count and Figaro climb up a ladder to the balcony and enter the room through a window. Rosina shows Almaviva the letter and says she is very sad. Almaviva tells her who he really is. Rosina now loves him. Figaro tells them they should leave. Basilio and the notary come to the front door and try to leave by the ladder, but it has gone. Basilio can either take a bribe a be a witness to the marriage or he can be shot dead. He decides, together with Figaro, to witness the signing of the marriage contract between the Count and Rosina. Bartolo rushes in, but is too late. Bartolo (who was the one who had taken away the ladder) is made happy when he is told he can keep Rosina's dowry."}

There were 93,650 people in Brantford the last time the Government of Canada did a census count, in 2011.\nBrantford is near Hamilton.\nBrantford is sometimes called \"The Telephone City\", because the inventor of the telephone lived in Brantford. Hockey player Wayne Gretzky was born in Brantford.\nHistory.\nBrantford was settled by United Empire Loyalists led by Joseph Brant of the Iroquois in 1784. It became a city in 1877.\nBusiness.\nFrom 1900 until 1950, Brantford had many companies that made equipment and machinery. Those items were sold in Canada and many other countries. Having the river and a railroad for transportation made it easier to ship the items made in Brantford. That helped Brantford change from a farming town to an industrial city.\nBy the 1980s and 1990s, business in Brantford was dropping and some companies like White Farm Equipment, Massey-Ferguson, Koering-Waterous, Harding Carpets, and others stopped making products. Many people lost their factory jobs.\nA new piece of highway (Highway 403) was built in 1997. The new highway made it easier to drive Hamilton and Toronto, and also to Detroit and Buffalo. So, in 2004, Procter &amp; Gamble and Ferrero SpA moved to Brantford. Now other companies set up in Brantford because it is a good location for shipping products to eastern North America.\nEducation.\n40% of people in Brantford did not finish high-school. In the rest of the province of Ontario, this number is 33%.\nPeople in Brantford earn 9% less than people in the rest of Canada.\nPolitics.\nThe city council was elected on October 27, 2014, and is led by Mayor Chris Friel. The city council, in addition to Friel, includes Larry Kings and Rick Weaver (Ward 1), John Sless and John Utley (Ward 2), Greg Martin and Dan McCreary (Ward 3), Cheryl Antoski and Richard Carpenter (Ward 4), and David Neumann and Brian Van Tilborg (Ward 5). There are municipal elections every four years across the province of Ontario. The next election will be in October 2018.\nNewspapers, radio and television (TV).\nThe \"Brantford Expositor\", which began in 1852, is printed six times a week (everyday except Sunday). The Brant News is published weekly in Brantford.\nBrantford has its own television service: Rogers TV (cable 20), a local community channel on Rogers Cable. Other television stations come fromToronto, Hamilton and Kitchener.\nFilming in Brantford.\nBrantford has been used to film parts of the Murdoch Mysteries television series because it has lots of old architecture that fits with the years that the stories take place.\nMovies like \"Welcome to Mooseport\" and \"Where the Truth Lies\" were partly made in Brantford.

It looks at the processes which change the Earth's surface and rocks under the surface.\nGeologists use stratigraphy and paleontology to find out the sequence of the events, and show the plants and animals which lived at different times in the past. They worked out the sequence of rock layers. Then the discovery of radioactivity and the invention of radiometric dating techniques gave a way to get the ages of the layers (strata).\nWe now know the timing of important events that have happened during the history of Earth. The Earth is about 4.567 billion (4,567 million) years old. The geological or \"deep time\" of Earth's past has been organized into various units. Boundaries on the time scale are usually marked by major geological or palaeontological events, such as mass extinctions. For example, the boundary between the Cretaceous period and the Palaeogene period is defined by the Cretaceous\u2013Tertiary extinction event. This marked the end of the dinosaurs and of many marine species.\nProspecting for energy sources and valuable minerals depends on understanding the geological history of an area. Such knowledge can also help lessen the hazards of earthquakes and volcanoes.\nTerminology.\nThe largest defined unit of time is the supereon composed of Eons. Eons are divided into Eras, which are in turn divided into Periods, Epochs and Stages. At the same time paleontologists define a system of faunal stages, of varying lengths, based on the kinds of animal fossils found there. In many cases, such faunal stages have been adopted in building the geological nomenclature, though in general there are far more recognized faunal stages than defined geological time units.\nGeologists tend to talk in terms of Upper/Late, Lower/Early and Middle parts of periods and other units, such as \"Upper Jurassic\", and \"Middle Cambrian\". \"Upper\", \"Middle\", and \"Lower\" are terms applied to the rocks themselves, as in \"Upper Jurassic sandstone,\" while \"Late\", \"Middle\", and \"Early\" are applied to time, as in \"Early Jurassic deposition\" or \"fossils of Early Jurassic age.\" The adjectives are capitalized when the subdivision is formally recognized, and lower case when not; thus \"early Miocene\" but \"Early Jurassic.\" \nBecause geologic units occurring at the same time but from different parts of the world can often look different and contain different fossils, there are many examples where the same period was historically given different names in different locales. For example, in North America the Lower Cambrian is called the Waucoban series that is then subdivided into zones based on trilobites. The same timespan is split into Tommotian, Atdabanian and Botomian stages in East Asia and Siberia. A key aspect of the work of the International Commission on Stratigraphy is to reconcile this conflicting terminology and define universal horizons (time division) that can be used around the world.\nTable of geologic time.\nThe following table summarizes the major events and characteristics of the periods of time making up the geologic time scale. As above, this time scale is based on the International Commission on Stratigraphy. The height of each table entry does not correspond to the duration of each subdivision of time."}

Hansard and Irglov\u00e1 also appeared as working-class immigrants in the popular Irish movie, \"Once\", which was shown at the Sundance Film Festival in 2007. The following year, they won an Oscar, the Academy Award for Best Song for the movie's hit single, \"Falling Slowly,\". Hansard became the first Irish-born person to win in that category. Irglov\u00e1 became the first Czech woman to win an Oscar, and at age 19, she is the youngest person to win an Oscar in a musical category.\nThe Swell Season became famous as a result. The soundtrack recording, \"Once: Music from the Motion Picture\" went gold in February 2008. They went on tour and performed to sold-out crowds in many countries.\nDuring the tour, Hansard and Irglov\u00e1 began dating. Hansard said, \"I had been falling in love with her for a long time, but I kept telling myself she's just a kid\". Hansard and Irglov\u00e1 also recorded a version of Bob Dylan's \"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\" for the movie \"I'm Not There\" in 2007. In 2009, Hansard said that he and Irglova were no longer romantically linked, and that they are now \"good friends.\"\nHansard and Irglov\u00e1 performed the song live on the Oscar broadcast at Los Angeles' Kodak Theater on February 24, 2008. When they went on stage to receive their awards, her acceptance speech was stopped by the orchestra's music cue to leave the stage. Host Jon Stewart asked her back to deliver her speech following the commercial break. Ceremony director Gil Cates said the early cue was an accident.\nShe said:\n\u201cHi everyone.

And, you know, fair play to those who dare to dream and don\u2019t give up. And this song was written from a perspective of hope, and hope at the end of the day connects us all, no matter how different we are. And so thank you so much, who helped us along way.

He played college football for Alcorn State University. McNair was murdered on July 4, 2009.\nEarly life.\nMcNair was born in Mount Olive, Mississippi, USA McNair credits much of his success to his older brother, Fred, who played a very important part in raising McNair and his siblings, plus helping their mother. He and attended Mount Olive High School starting in 1987, where he played football, baseball, and basketball, and ran track. He led his school to the State Championship as a sophomore.\nCollege career.\nMcNair was offered a full scholarship to the University of Florida to play defensive back but wanting to play quarterback. McNair played college football for Alcorn State University in the NCAA. In 1992, McNair threw for 3,541 yards and 29 touchdowns, and ran in for 10 more scores. The Braves went 7\u20134. McNair helped Alcorn State to another good year in 1993, as the Braves upped their record to 8\u20133 while McNair threw for more than 3,000 yards and 30 touchdowns. \nAs a senior in 1994, McNair had nearly 6,000 yards rushing and passing, with 53 touchdowns and was named an All-American. McNair also won the Walter Payton Award as the top I-AA player and finished third in the Heisman Trophy voting behind Rashaan Salaam and Ki-Jana Carter. McNair set career records for the Football Championship Series with 14,496 passing yards.\nProfessional career.\nHouston/Tennessee Oilers/Titans.\nMcNair was selected by the Houston Oilers with new head coach Jeff Fisher. McNair stayed in Houston for a few solid years, although McNair was often used as a backup. Runningback Eddie George assisted McNair with his strong running. In 1997 (McNair's first year as a starter), the Oilers moved to Tennessee, and became the Titans before the 1999 season, and also began play in LP Field, or as it was called then, Adelphia Collesium, in 1999.\nEarly in the 1999 season, McNair was diagnosed with an inflamed disk following Tennessee's 36\u201335 win over the Cincinnati Bengals, and needed surgery. He was replaced by veteran Neil O'Donnell. Over the next five games, O'Donnell led the Titans to a 4\u20131 record. McNair returned against the St. Louis Rams, and with McNair starting, Tennessee won seven of its last nine games to finish 13-3.\nTennessee opened the at home against the Buffalo Bills in a Wild Card game, winning on the \"Music City Miracle\" and got to Super Bowl XXXIV in a re-match with the St. Louis Rams. On the final play of the game, a McNair pass to Kevin Dyson was complete, but Dyson could not break the plane of the goal line, giving the Rams the win. McNair signed a six-year contract with the Titans after the season.\nMcNair led the Titans to another solid 13-3 season in 2000, but it ended in a hard-fought playoff loss to the Baltimore Ravens in the Divisional Round.\nIn 2001, McNair had passing highs in yards (3,350), completions (264), touchdowns (21) and quarterback rating (90.2). He also had five scores rushing. McNair was named to the Pro Bowl for the first time, but the game due to a shoulder injury.\nAfter a solid 2002 season, McNair was arrested for DUI (and he also had a handgun in his possession). However, all charges were eventually dropped. McNair and Indianapolis Colts quarterback Peyton Manning were named co-MVPs for the 2003 season, although McNair had to sit out two games. Injuries continued to bother McNair over the next two seasons, as he played in only eight games in 2004 and fourteen in 2005.\nBaltimore Ravens.\nOn June 8, 2006 McNair was traded to the Baltimore Ravens. McNair was given the starting job in Baltimore over the disappointing Kyle Boller. McNair started all 16 games in 2006, but often rotated in and out with Boller. McNair got the Ravens to a 13-3 record. McNair's 2006 statistics with the Ravens included 295 pass completions on 468 attempts for 3,050 passing yards, 16 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions. McNair also ran for a score in a win against the New Orleans Saints.\nMcNair and the Ravens both had a bad season in 2007. The Ravens went 5-11, and McNair was often injured. Due to bad quarterback play, McNair would always play when healthy over Kyle Boller and rookie Troy Smith, but McNair still threw only two touchdowns next to four interceptions. That was his last year in the NFL. McNair had his retirement press conference with the Ravens in April, 2008.\nPersonal.\nMcNair was married to Mechelle McNair from June 21, 1997 until his death. McNair had a farm in Mississipi, USA, where he would often go.\nMcNair had two sons by Mechelle: Steve LaTreal McNair, Steven O'Brian Koran McNair; and two sons - Tyler and Trenton - by two other women.\nMcNair earned the nickname \"Air McNair\" in High School. He opened his own restaurant in Nashville, which he named Gridiron9. McNair was also a mentor to quarterback Vince Young.\nDeath.\nOn July 4, 2009, McNair and 20-year old Sahel Kazemi were found dead in a condominium rented by McNair in Nashville. McNair had several gunshot wounds, and Kazemi had only one to the head. Kazemi had been arrested for DUI two days earlier, and McNair left with his restaurant chef in a taxi. Traces of gunpowder were found on Kazemi's hand, as well as a gun. Kazemi was having trouble financially, and apparently found out that McNair had other relationships. Police ruled this a murder-suicide, with Kazemi as the killer, McNair as the victim. Many people came to McNair's funeral, including some notable players, like fellow QB Brett Favre and former teammate Ray Lewis. Said Titans owner Bud Adams:\nTo the Associated Press, Ravens General Manager Ozzie Newsome added:\nMcNair was buried in Memphis on July 11, 2009."}

Other studies say it includes 55 species, including the domesticated orchard apple, or table apple as it used to be called. The other species and subspecies are generally known as \"wild apples\", \"crab apples\", \"crabapples\" or \"crabs\".\nThe genus is native to the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, in Europe, Asia and North America.\nApple trees are small, usually 4\u201312 m tall when full grown. The leaves are 3\u201310\u00a0cm long, positioned opposite from each other. They have a simple shape with a saw-tooth edge. The flowers come from corymbs, and have five petals, which may be white, pink or red, with usually red stamens that produce lots of pollen, and an ovary which is below them. Flowering takes place in the spring and pollination is by insects (typically bees, which freely visit the flowers for both nectar and pollen). \nUses.\nThe fruit of the other species is not an important crop in most areas because they are very sour and (in some species) very like wood, and are rarely eaten raw for this reason. However, crabapples are an excellent source of pectin, and their juice can be made into a ruby-coloured jelly. Some kinds of crab apples make good applesauce.\nCrabapples are widely grown as trees for the pleasure of their appearance, grown for their beautiful flowers or fruit. There are cultivars selected for these qualities and for resistance to disease.\nSome crab apples are used as rootstocks for domestic apples to stand up to cold or drought.\nThey are also used as tree for pollinating food apple trees in apple orchards. Varieties of crab apple are selected to bloom at the same time as the apple trees in an orchard, and the crabs are planted every sixth or seventh tree, or limbs of a crab tree are grafted onto some of the apple trees. See also fruit tree pollination.\nBecause of the many blossoms and small sized fruit, crab apples are popular for use in bonsai. Because the trees are small due to the needs of the hobby, but still show the abundant fruit bearing of full-sized crab apples, it is important to thin out fruit so that trees do not stress themselves.\nApple wood \"makes a wonderfully luxurious firewood with a lovely scent [smell], and smoke from an apple wood fire gives a most excellent flavour to smoked foods,\" including Applewood cheese."}

The battles happened between April and December 1944. There were three battles in the Chinese provinces of Henan, Hunan and Guangxi. The goals of Operation Ichi-go were to make a route to French Indochina and to capture bases that American bombers were using to attack Japan and her shipping.\nCourse of the campaign.\nThere were two parts to the operation. In the first part, the Japanese secured the Railway between Beijing and Wuhan. In the second part they destroyed the US air forces in Hunan province and reached the city of Liuzhou. Liuzhou was near the border with Japanese-occupied Indochina.\n400,000 men, 12,000 vehicles and 70,000 horses took part in operation Ichi-Go. The Japanese army included the very well trained Kwantung Army units and equipment from Manchukuo, North China and Japan. It was the largest land operation by the Japanese during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Many of the new American-trained Chinese units were fighting in Burma under General Joseph Stilwell using weapons leased from the United States. Chiang Kai-shek had agreed that Stilwell could manage the distribution of American arms. \nIn \"Operation Kogo\", 390,000 Chinese soldiers, led by General Tang Enbo, defended Luoyang. The Japanese 3rd Tank Division crossed the Yellow River around Zhengzhou in late April and defeated the Chinese near Xuchang. They then moved around to the right and put Luoyang under siege. Luoyang was defended by three Chinese divisions. The 3rd Tank Division began to attack on May 13 and won Luoyang on May 25.\nThe second part of Ichigo began in May. Japanese forces moved south and occupied Changsha, Hengyang, Guilin and Liuzhou. In December 1944, Japanese forces reached French Indochina and completed the operation. Despite this success, US air forces moved inland from the threatened bases near the coast. The U.S. Air Force often stopped the railway between Beijing and Liuzhou that had been started in Operation Ichigo. Japan continued to attack airfields where US air forces were stationed up to the spring of 1945.\nUSA's XX Bomber Command were using B-29 bombers like the ones that were attacking Japan. They were forced to move as well, but this affected their efficiency for only a short time. In early 1945 the Twentieth Air Force moved to newly established bases in the Marianas under the command of the newly established XXI Bomber Command.\nAftermath.\nThe failure to hold the coastal airfields led to a loss of confidence in General Joseph Stilwell by Chiang Kai-shek. Stilwell was replaced in October 1944 by President Roosevelt. The new Chief of Staff to Chiang Kai-Shek and commander of the U.S. Forces in China was Major General Albert Wedemeyer. Stillwell's other responsibilities in China, Burma and India were given to other officers.\nA very different version of events was that General Joseph Stilwell was asking for a fuller use of Chinese forces and had made diplomatic connections with the Chinese Red Army commanded by Mao Zedong. They had agreed to follow an American commander.\nBecause Chiang Kai-shek was ignored by the American general, he had Stilwell called back to the United States. \"New York Times\" reporter Brooks Atkinson wrote at the time: The decision to relieve General Stilwell represents the political triumph of a moribund, anti-democratic regime that is more concerned with maintaining its political supremacy than in driving the Japanese out of China. America is now committed... to support a regime that has become increasingly unpopular and mistrusted in China, that maintains three secret police services and concentration camps for political prisoners, that stifles free speech and resists democratic forces... The Chinese Communists... have good armies that are now fighting guerrilla warfare against the Japanese in North China... The Generalissimo regards these armies as the chief threat to his supremacy... has made no sincere attempt to arrange at least a truce with them for the duration of the war... No diplomatic genius could have overcome the Generalissimo's basic unwillingness to risk his armies in battle with the Japanese...\nBut the \"Time Magazine\" article in which Atkinson was quoted went on to talk about the true failure of Stilwell's goals by saying that: The Chinese, exhausted by seven years of almost singlehanded war against Japan, were reluctant to give General Stilwell the troops he wanted for the Burma offensive; the Japs might suddenly crack down on them in earnest. When the Japs began the drive that last week seemed on the verge of cutting China in two, Chiang Kai-shek's Government might well have felt that its go-slow policy was justified...\" \nThis loss and the poor opinion in the U.S.A. caused the Americans to lose confidence in the Chinese troops. Instead the U.S. focused all its resources on the island-to-island war in the Pacific."}

Many rivers flow to the Black Sea, including the big rivers, the Don, Danube, Dniester and Dnieper.\nIt is connected to the Atlantic Ocean through the Bosphorus strait, the Sea of Marmara, the Dardanelles strait, the Aegean Sea, the Mediterranean Sea and the Strait of Gibraltar. 90% of the sea has no oxygen. The water is saltwater but less salty than the ocean. During the last ice age, the Black Sea was a freshwater lake. \nHistory.\nIn Greek mythology, the Argonauts traveled on the sea. Greeks set up colonies around the sea because it was important to trade for many countries in ancient history. The Gallipoli Campaign during World War I was a fight for access to the Black Sea. It was also important in World War II.\nGeology.\nThe Black Sea sits on continental plates which have subsided. It is a geologic basin, and therefore is a genuine inland sea. Its maximum depth is about 2000 metres. The Black Sea is the world\u2019s largest basin where the deep waters do not mix with the upper layers of water that receive oxygen from the atmosphere. As a result, over 90% of the deeper Black Sea volume is anoxic water. The upper layers are generally cooler, less dense and less salty than the deeper waters, as they are fed by large river systems, whereas the deep waters come from the warm, salty waters of the Mediterranean. \nThe Crimean Peninsula divides this sea. The Bosporus and Dardanelles connect the Black Sea to the Mediterranean."}

The manifesto was published in the daily (newspaper) \"\u017bycie\" (\"Life\"), seated in Cracow, in the year 1898, and was immediately accepted in all the parts of the divided Poland, by analogy with other similar expressions as Young Germany, Young Belgium, Young Scandinavia and so on.\nLiterature.\nPolish literature of the period was based on two main understandings: \nOther important writers of the period were:\nMusic.\nIn music, the expression \"Young Poland\" is put into use to an informal group of composers which include Karol Szymanowski, Grzegorz Fitelberg, Ludomir R\u00f3\u017cycki and probably also Mieczys\u0142aw Kar\u0142owicz. This group worked under the strong influence of the neoromanticism of the music, and especially of composers from another countries as Richard Strauss and Richard Wagner. The composers would be also strong links with the The Five, a group of composers Russian which included Modest Musorgski, Alexander Borodin and Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov.\nArt.\nIn the period of the Young Poland there were not any great artistic currents in Polish art. The painters and the sculptors attempted to continue in the romantic tradition, in bringing new ways of expression already popular in another countries. The more influential current was the Art Nouveau, even if the Polish artists started attempting also new forms of national style. The sculptura just like the painture of the period were strongly influenced by all the forms of the symbolism."}

It crossed the Atlantic and did not start until it was close to the Windward Islands. On July 24 it became Tropical Depression Three. Tropical Depression Three became Tropical Storm Cesar on July 25. Cesar did not strengthen much because it was close to land. It did start to strengthen more as it entered the Southwestern Caribbean Sea. After about half way between Nicaragua and South America, Tropical Storm Cesar became a hurricane on July 27. Hurricane Cesar reached its highest winds on July 28, which were at 85\u00a0mph. Later that day, Hurricane Cesar made landfall near Bluefields, in Nicaragua while it still had its highest winds. Cesar weakened into a tropical storm over Central America. But it did survive crossing Central America. \nLate on July 28, Cesar reached the Pacific Ocean and was renamed Tropical Storm Douglas. By the next day, Tropical Storm Douglas became a hurricane. Later, on August 1, Hurricane Douglas reached its highest wind, which were at 130\u00a0mph. Douglas started getting weaker because of cooler waters. On August 5, Hurricane Douglas died.\nRetirement.\nThe name \"Cesar\" was retired and the name \"Douglas\" was not retired. In 2002 and 2008 the name Cristobal was used instead, it was not retired.

His father changed his name from \"Gy\u00f6rgy\" to \"Georg\" and changed his family name to \"Solti\". This was so that his name did not look Jewish, because there was a lot of antisemitism in Europe.\nHe learned the piano but, when he was 14, he heard Erich Kleiber conduct Beethoven's Symphony No. 5 and he immediately wanted to be a conductor. He studied at the Franz Liszt Academy of Music, under B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k, Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly, Leo Weiner and Ernst von Dohnanyi. By 1935 he was becoming known as a conductor. He conducted \"The Marriage of Figaro\" at the Budapest Opera in 1938. It was the first time he had conducted there, and it was also to be the last time. That very day, Hitler annexed Austria. Life became dangerous for Jews in Hungary. In 1939, he moved to Switzerland, where he continued a career as a pianist and won the Geneva International Piano Competition, but he did not have many chances to conduct there. His father became ill and died, so he never saw him again.\nAfter World War II Solti became music director of the Bavarian State Orchestra in Munich (where he gave the first performance in Germany of Paul Hindemith's opera \"Mathis der Maler\", which had been banned when the Nazis were in power. He conducted the Frankfurt Opera where he gave the first performance in Germany of Alban Berg's \"Lulu\". In 1951 he performed at the Salzburg Festival conducting Mozart's \"Idomeneo\".\nMid career.\nSolti often conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and it was arranged that he would be their main conductor (music director) from 1962. However, Solti changed his mind because they appointed Zubin Mehta as assistant conductor without telling Solti. Mehta became musical director instead.\nIn 1961 Solti became music director at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, and stayed there until 1971. He was a great conductor, but made the musicians work very hard. With his bald head he got the nickname \"The Screaming Skull\". He spent much of his time in Britain and the United States.\nHis first marriage ended in divorce. His second marriage was to Valerie Pitts, a British television presenter whom he met when she was sent to interview him. They had two daughters, Gabrielle and Claudia. He was given an honorary Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1971. The next year he became a British citizen, and was then known as Sir Georg Solti.\nSolti helped many young musicians, training them in workshops and giving them opportunities to perform.\nLater career.\nSolti was music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (CSO) from 1969 until 1991, when he was given the title of Music Director Laureate, the only CSO conductor to be given that title. He made them into a world class orchestra and took them on tours to other countries. He gave 999 performances with the CSO. He died before his 1,000th performance. A square near the Symphony Center in Chicago was called \"Sir Georg Solti Place\" in his memory.\nSolti also had other jobs. He was music director of the Orchestre de Paris from 1972 until 1975. From 1979 until 1983 he was principal conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra. During this time with the London Philharmonic he performed and recorded many works by Elgar including the two symphonies, the Violin Concerto with Kyung Wha Chung and the Cello Concerto with Julian Lloyd Webber. In 1983 he conducted Wagner's Ring Cycle at Bayreuth for the only time. For the 50th anniversary of the United Nations, Solti formed the World Orchestra for Peace, which consisted of musicians from 47 orchestras around the world.\nSolti worked with Dudley Moore on a 1991 television series, \"Orchestra!\", which was made to explain to people all about the orchestra.\nSolti never retired. He had many plans for concerts and recordings when he suddenly died of a heart attack on 5 September 1997 in Antibes, France He was given a state funeral, and was buried next to Bart\u00f3k who had been his teacher and had helped him a lot. Solti\u2019s widow and daughters began the Solti Foundation to help young musicians."}

All modern rockets are based on the V2 design. \nThe first successful launch was from Peenem\u00fcnde on 3 October, 1942, reaching a height of 192\u00a0km. The V2 was designed by Nazis to bomb London, Antwerp and other European cities. It travelled at four times the speed of sound so was impossible to shoot down. \nThe first V-2 used as a weapon exploded in Paris on 8 September 1944, with a second rocket exploding in London later that day. Over 3,000 V-2s were used by the German Wehrmacht against Allied targets in World War II, resulting in the death of about 7,250 military personnel and civilians.\nThe victors used captured V-2 rockets to start their space and missile programs. In the United States they were helped by the team of German rocket scientists from Peenem\u00fcnde, led by Wernher von Braun. They had surrendered to the US at the end of the war. \nThe first US-assembled V-2, made from parts captured in Germany, was launched from White Sands, New Mexico, in April 1946. There were 66 V-2 rocket flights, the last on October 29, 1951.\nDevelopment.\nIn the late 1920s, a young Wernher von Braun bought a copy of Hermann Oberth's book, \"Die Rakete zu den Planetenr\u00e4umen\" (\"The Rocket into Interplanetary Spaces\"). Starting in 1930, he attended the Technical University of Berlin, where he assisted Oberth in liquid-fueled rocket motor tests. In 1933 he went to work for the Army designing and building rockets. The final, biggest rocket was the A-4, later called V-2.\nProduction.\nOn 22 Dec. 1942, Hitler signed the order for mass production, when Speer assumed final technical data would be ready by July 1943. However, many issues still remained to be solved even by the autumn of 1943.\nTest launch was recovered by Polish resistance on 30 May 1944 and rocket from Blizna was transported to the UK during Operation Most III."}

{"id": "190206", "revid": "373511", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=190206", "title": "The Guardian Legend", "text": " is a video game made by Compile in 1988. It is played on the Nintendo Entertainment System. The player controls a half-person half-robot woman to destroy a large alien moon before it gets to Earth. To do this, the player starts ten devices in the moon. Like \"Metroid.\"\n\"The Guardian Legend\" got mixed reviews from \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" and \"Nintendo Power\". People liked the game for how it looked, sounded, and felt. Other people did not like the game because the play was the same. It also had a very long password. The game was not well known at first, but it is more known now. It is an example of a game where players do different things.\nPlot.\nIn \"The Guardian Legend\", the player controls the female guardian of Earth, a \"robot transformer\"; the Japanese version of the game calls her \"Miria\". The player is to destroy the alien moon Naju before it gets to Earth. The player needs to turn on the moon's self-destruct device and escape the moon before it gets to Earth. Five alien tribes who try to control the moon stand in the way of the player. To help players along, messages left by a person help guide them in finding the safety switches to turn on the self-destruct device. These messages also help players get to some other rooms.\nGameplay.\nThe player controls the Guardian in human form while walking on Naju's surface, called the \"Labyrinth\". When in Naju, the Guardian turns into a spaceship in which the player can move around. The Guardian has a life meter that drops when hit by alien attacks. Players can pick up items to help fill the Guardian's life meter again. If the life meter runs out, then the Guardian dies, ending the game. The player can shoot at aliens with different types of weapons by pressing buttons on the gamepad. Players get different and better weapons during play.\nRound, colored creatures in the game named \"Landers\" appear in the game to help players. Landers can help fill the Guardian's life meter and increase the number of times players can fire weapons. Blue Landers may sell weapons to players. They also give out passwords. Passwords let players stop the game and come back to it later.\nThe player goes through the Labyrinth and find entrances to the Dungeon. The ten safety devices are in the Dungeon. The Labyrinth is made up of many rooms that are as big as the screen. Players can look at a map to see where they are at. This map can be looked at while the game is paused. Players can either walk from one room to another, or they can go to another room through a \"warp panel\". Some of these warp panels require the right key to go through. Many rooms contain aliens. Other rooms contain clues, shops, passwords, and entrances to the Dungeon.\nThe Dungeon contains areas in which the Guardian flies through as a spaceship. The Dungeon has many aliens to destroy. At the end of an area in the Dungeon, there is a boss, a very strong alien that must be destroyed. After destroying the boss, the Guardian flies out of the Dungeon and back into the Labyrinth. The player then gets a power-up. The player may also receive a key for a warp panel. Some entrances to the Dungeon are already open. Other entrances need a certain task completed before going in. Clues in the Labyrinth tell players how to get into these entrances.\nHistory.\n\"The Guardian Legend\" was made for the Famicom and came out in 1988 in Japan. It came out for the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America in 1989 and in Europe in 1990. The people who created the game were the same who created \"Guardic\", \"Zanac\", and \"Puyo Puyo\".\nReviewers liked the game for its multiple features. Some have compared the game to other Nintendo games like \"The Legend of Zelda\" and \"Metroid\". Mike Engler, who made \"Retro Game Challenge\", said that \"\"The Guardian Legend\" is one of the best games ever released\". The game was nominated by \"Nintendo Power\" magazine in 1989 for \"Best Graphics &amp; Sound\", \"Best Play Control\", and \"Best Overall\" but did not win any of them. Some of the music of the game were remixed."}

It was the sixth yearly Vengeance event. Eight professional wrestling matches were featured on the event's card. The buildup to the matches and the situations that took place before, during, and after the event were planned by WWE's script writers. The event starred wrestlers from the \"Raw\" brand: a storyline expansion of the promotion where employees are assigned to a wrestling brand under the WWE banner.\nThe main event was a 5-on-2 Handicap match, a match consisting of one team of wrestlers facing off against a team of wrestlers with more people such as three against two, or five against two, between D-Generation X (DX) (Triple H and Shawn Michaels) versus the Spirit Squad (Kenny, Johnny, Mitch, Nicky, and Mikey). Triple H and Michaels won the match after pinning Kenny and Mikey, respectively. Two other matches were on the card. In singles matches, John Cena beat Sabu in an Extreme lumberjack match, which featured wrestlers from the \"Raw\" and \"ECW\" brands at ringside. The other featured match was for the WWE Championship, in which Rob Van Dam beat Edge to keep his title.\nVengeance made over $400,000 in ticket sales from an attendance of 6,800 and received 320,000 pay-per-view buys, which helped WWE increase its pay-per-view revenue by $21.6\u00a0million compared to the year before. When the event was released on DVD, it reached the number one position on \"Billboard's\" DVD Sales Chart. \nBackground.\nThe event had eight professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers played either villains or heroes as they followed a series of events, which lead to a wrestling match or series of matches. All wrestlers belonged to the \"Raw\" brand\u00a0\u2013 a storyline division in which WWE assigned its employees to a different program, the other two being \"SmackDown!\" and \"ECW\".\nThe main event scripted into Vengeance was between D-Generation X (DX) Triple H and Shawn Michaels versus the Spirit Squad (Kenny [Ken Doane], Johnny [Johnny Jeter], Mitch [Nick Mitchell], Nicky [Nick Nemeth], and Mikey [Michael Brendli]) in a 5-on-2 Handicap match consisting of one team of wrestlers facing off against a team of wrestlers with more people such as five against two. The story for the match began after Backlash, \"Raw\"'s previous pay-per-view event, where The McMahons (Vince and Shane) defeated Michaels and \"God\" in a tag team match, with help from the Spirit Squad in a no disqualification match, a match where neither wrestler can be disqualified, allowing for weapons and outside interference. For weeks on \"Raw\", Michaels got revenge on both Vince McMahon and the Spirit Squad, until the May 22 episode of \"Raw\", where the Spirit Squad were scripted to injure Michaels' left knee. Then, by orders of McMahon, Triple H was to \"break Michaels' skull\", with a sledgehammer. Triple H failed to do what McMahon ordered and instead attacked the Spirit Squad, thus turning into a hero. Two weeks later, McMahon put Triple H in a gauntlet match, against the Spirit Squad. In the match, Kenny grabbed a steel chair and put it on Triple H's left knee, similar to what the group did to Michaels. Mitch, who was the only member not participating in the match, was thrown out from the backstage curtain by Michaels. Then, Michaels joined Triple H in the ring as they began to beat down the four members of the Spirit Squad. This lead to Michaels and Triple H reforming D-Generation X for the first time since their teased reunion in 2002. That same night, McMahon scheduled the Spirit Squad and D-Generation X in a 5-on-2 handicap tag team match. On the June 19 episode of \"Raw\", DX marked their return, when the duo humiliated the Spirit Squad as DX dumped green slime onto the group and embarrassed the team afterward, by beating them.\nOne of the featured matches was between John Cena and Sabu in an Extreme lumberjack match, a standard match with the exception that the ring is surrounded by a group of wrestlers not directly involved in it and competed under hardcore rules. On the television debut of \"ECW on Sci Fi\" on June 13, a brawl broke out between Rob Van Dam and Edge. Edge, who tried to leave through the \"ECW\" crowd, was attacked by Cena, because he caused Cena to lose the WWE Championship at ECW's One Night Stand, and Cena wanted revenge against Edge. Following the attack, Cena went to ringside where he knocked ECW Representative Paul Heyman unconscious, after Heyman awarded the win to Van Dam at One Night Stand. Following the attack, Heyman announced that all ECW superstars would be at \"Raw\" the next week. The next week on \"Raw\", Heyman appeared alongside ECW superstar, Balls Mahoney, who was booked to wrestle Cena in a match. The match was won by Cena after he made Mahoney submit. After the match, Cena was attacked by ECW wrestler, Sabu, who, in the premiere of \"ECW on Sci-Fi\" won a 10-man Extreme Battle Royal, (a multi-competitor match type in which wrestlers are eliminated until only one is left and declared winner) where the winner would face Cena at Vengeance in a match. Sabu beat up Cena and performed a leg drop on him, diving onto Cena and putting him through the \"Raw\" announcers' table. The following night on an episode of \"ECW on Sci-Fi\", Cena went to the \"ECW\" locker room, where he challenged Sabu to an Extreme lumberjack match, which Sabu accepted.\nThe other featured match was between WWE Champion Rob Van Dam defending the title against Edge. The story for the match began on the television premiere of \"ECW on Sci-Fi\", when Van Dam was awarded the ECW World Heavyweight Championship by Paul Heyman, making Van Dam a double champion by holding both the ECW and WWE Championship. Van Dam's celebration was then interrupted by Edge and his girlfriend, Lita. Edge, who was number one contender for the title, told Van Dam that they both had a lot in common, meaning that they were both Money in the Bank winners and successfully became WWE Champions. Edge ended his speech by giving Van Dam some kind words and then attacking him. On the June 19 episode of \"Raw\", Van Dam attacked Edge, moments after Edge won a match against Ric Flair."}

It has an axial shaft with a tip of a certain shape that fits into the head of a screw. On the other end of the screwdriver is a cylindrical handle to be held by a person's hand. As the handle is rotated, it creates a torque that turns the tip via the screwdriver's shaft. There are many different sizes and kinds of screwdrivers. A screwdriver is usually identified by the shape of its tip. The tip is shaped in a certain way to match the groove cut into the head of a screw. A screwdriver is, therefore, a mechanism to apply torque to a screw and turn it in tight spaces.\nDrive and blade types.\nScrewdrivers come in a large variety of shapes and sizes to match those of screws. If a screwdriver that is not the right size and type for the screw is used, it is likely that the screw will be damaged in the process of tightening it. Many screwdriver designs have a handle that can be used with different tips. The shaft and the tip can be removed from the handle, and a different one can be attached instead. The shaft and the tip are together called a \"bit\" (as with a drill bit). This allows a set of one handle and several heads to be used for a variety of screw sizes and types.\nPowered screwdriving.\nMost screwdrivers are operated manually, but there are some that use an electric or other motor to rotate the bit. They are used to drive screws quickly into various materials. There are different types of driver bits that let a drill drive different types of screws. The bit can be removed and swapped with another bit of a different shape. Many types of drills are able to be used as power screwdrivers. The best have a control over how much torque force is used, which allows the screws to be tightened to a specific level."}

It carries more passengers than any other Underground line; 206,734,000 a year.\nFor most of its length it is a deep-level tube line. The portion between and opened in 1890 and is the oldest section of deep-level tube line on the Underground network. There were about 252 million passenger journeys recorded in 2011/12 on the Northern line, making it the second-busiest on the Underground. (It was the busiest from 2003 to 2010.) It is unique in having two different routes through central London. Despite its name, it does not serve the northern-most stations on the network, though it does serve the southern-most station, Morden, as well as 16 of the system's 29 stations south of the River Thames. There are 50 stations in total on the line, of which 36 have platforms below ground.\nThe line has a complicated history, and the current complex arrangement of two main northern branches, two central branches and the southern route reflects its genesis as three separate railways, combined in the 1920s and 1930s. An extension in the 1920s used a route originally planned by a fourth company. Abandoned plans from the 1920s to extend the line further southwards, and then northwards in the 1930s, would have incorporated parts of the routes of two further companies. From the 1930s to the 1970s, the tracks of a seventh company were also managed as a branch of the Northern line. An extension from Kennington to Battersea is currently under construction, which may either give the Northern line a second southern branch or may see it split into separate distinct lines with their own identities. It is coloured black on the current Tube map.\nHistory.\nEarly History.\nThe City and South London Railway (C&amp;SLR) was the first deep-level underground \"tube\" railway in the world, and the first major railway to use electric traction. The railway was originally intended for cable-hauled trains, but owing to the bankruptcy of the cable contractor during construction, a system of electric traction using electric locomotives\u2014an experimental technology at the time\u2014was chosen instead. Given the small dimension of the tunnels as well as the difficulty of providing sufficient ventilation, steam power, as used on London's other underground railways, was not feasible for a deep tube railway. Like Greathead's earlier Tower Subway, the CL&amp;SS was intended to be operated by cable haulage with a static engine pulling the cable through the tunnels at a steady speed. Section 5 of the 1884 Act specified that:\nThe Patent Cable Tramway Corporation owned the rights to the Hallidie cable-car system first invented and used in San Francisco in 1873; trains were attached to the cable with clamps, which would be opened and closed at stations, allowing the carriages to disconnect and reconnect without needing to stop the cable or to interfere with other trains sharing the cable. There were to be two independent endless cables, one between City station and Elephant and Castle moving at 10\u00a0mph, and the other between Elephant and Castle and Stockwell, where the gradient was less, at 12\u00a0mph. However, the additional length of tunnel permitted by the supplementary acts challenged the practicality of the cable system.\nIt is reported that this problem with the CL&amp;SS contributed to the bankruptcy of the cable company in 1888. However, electric motor traction had been considered all along, and much engineering progress had been made since the tunnel's construction had begun in 1886. So, CL&amp;SS chairman Charles Grey Mott decided to switch to electric traction. Other cable-operated systems using the Hallidie patents continued to be designed, such as the Glasgow Subway which opened in 1896.\nThe solution adopted was electrical power, provided via a third rail beneath the train, but offset to the west of centre for clearance reasons. Although the use of electricity to power trains had been experimented with during the previous decade, and small-scale operations had been implemented, the C&amp;SLR was the first major railway in the world to adopt it as a means of motive power. The system operated using electric locomotives built by Mather &amp; Platt collecting a voltage of 500 volts (actually +500\u00a0volts in the northbound tunnel and \u2212500\u00a0volts in the southbound) from the third rail and pulling several carriages. A depot and generating station were constructed at Stockwell. Owing to the limited capacity of the generators, the stations were originally illuminated by gas. The depot was on the surface, and trains requiring maintenance were initially hauled up via a ramp although, following a runaway accident, a lift was soon installed. In practice, most rolling stock and locomotives went to the surface only for major maintenance.\nTo avoid the need to purchase agreements for running under surface buildings, the tunnels were bored below roadways, where construction could be carried out without charge. At the northern end of the railway, the need to pass deep beneath the bed of the River Thames and the medieval street pattern of the City of London constrained the arrangement of the tunnels on the approach to King William Street station. Because of the proximity of the station to the river, steeply inclined tunnels were required to the west of the station. Because of the narrow street under which they ran, they were bored one above the other rather than side by side as elsewhere. The outbound tunnel was the lower and steeper of the two. The tunnels converged immediately before the station, which was in one large tunnel and comprised a single track with a platform on each side. The other terminus at Stockwell was also constructed in a single tunnel but with tracks on each side of a central platform.\nWhen opened in 1890, the line had six stations and ran for in a pair of tunnels between the City of London and Stockwell, passing under the River Thames:\nThe original service was operated by trains composed of an engine and three carriages. Thirty-two passengers could be accommodated in each carriage, which had longitudinal bench seating and sliding doors at the ends, leading onto a platform for boarding and alighting. It was reasoned that there was nothing to look at in the tunnels, so the only windows were in a narrow band high up in the carriage sides. Gate-men rode on the carriage platforms to operate the lattice gates and announce the station names to the passengers. Because of their claustrophobic interiors, the carriages soon became known as \"padded cells\". These trains were however, preserved in London Transport Museum as the first static exhibit to the metro train.\nThe diameter of the tunnels restricted the size of the trains, and the small carriages with their high-backed seating were nicknamed \"padded cells\". The railway was extended several times north and south, eventually serving 22 stations over a distance of from Camden Town in north London to Morden in Surrey.\nAlthough the C&amp;SLR was well used, low ticket prices and the construction cost of the extensions placed a strain on the company's finances. In 1913, the C&amp;SLR became part of the Underground Group of railways and, in the 1920s, it underwent major reconstruction works before its merger with another of the Group's railways, the Charing Cross, Euston &amp; Hampstead Railway, forming a single London Underground line called the Morden-Edgware line. In 1933, the C&amp;SLR and the rest of the Underground Group was taken into public ownership. Today, its tunnels and stations form the Bank Branch of the Northern line from Camden Town to Kennington and the southern leg of the line from Kennington to Morden.\nThe CCE&amp;HR (commonly known as the \"Hampstead Tube\") was opened in 1907 and ran from Charing Cross (known for many years as Strand) via Euston and Camden Town (where there was a junction) to Golders Green and Highgate (now known as Archway). It was extended south by one stop to Embankment in 1914 to form an interchange with the Bakerloo and District lines. In 1913 the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL), owner of the CCE&amp;HR, took over the C&amp;SLR, although they remained separate companies.\nDuring the early 1920s, a series of works was carried out to connect the C&amp;SLR and CCE&amp;HR tunnels to enable an integrated service to be operated. The first of these new tunnels, between the C&amp;SLR's Euston station and the CCE&amp;HR's station at Camden Town, had originally been planned in 1912 but had been delayed by World War I. The second connection linked the CCE&amp;HR's Embankment and C&amp;SLR's Kennington stations and provided a new intermediate station at Waterloo to connect to the main line station there and the Bakerloo line. The smaller-diameter tunnels of the C&amp;SLR were expanded to match the standard diameter of the CCE&amp;HR and the other deep tube lines.\nExtensions.\nIn conjunction with the works to integrate the two lines, two major extensions were undertaken: northwards to Edgware in Middlesex (now in the London Borough of Barnet) and southwards to Morden in Surrey (then in the Merton and Morden Urban District, but now in the London Borough of Merton).\nThe Edgware extension used plans dating back to 1901 for the Edgware and Hampstead Railway (E&amp;HR) which the UERL had taken over in 1912. It extended the CCE&amp;HR line from its terminus at Golders Green to Edgware in two stages: to Hendon Central in 1923 and to Edgware in 1924. The line crossed open countryside and ran on the surface, apart from a short tunnel north of Hendon Central. Five new stations were built to pavilion-style designs by Stanley Heaps, head of the Underground's Architects Office, stimulating the rapid northward expansion of suburban developments in the following years.\nThe engineering of the Morden extension of the C&amp;SLR from Clapham Common to Morden was more demanding, running in tunnels to a point just north of Morden station, which was constructed in a cutting. The line then runs under the wide station forecourt and public road outside the station, to the depot. The extension was initially planned to continue to Sutton over part of the route for the unbuilt Wimbledon and Sutton Railway, in which the UERL held a stake, but agreements were made with the Southern Railway to end the extension at Morden. The Southern Railway later built the surface line from Wimbledon to Sutton, via South Merton and St. Helier. The tube extension opened in 1926, with seven new stations, all designed by Charles Holden in a modern style. Originally, Stanley Heaps was to design the stations, but after seeing these designs Frank Pick, Assistant Joint Manager of the UERL, decided Holden should take over the project. With the exception of Morden and Clapham South, where more land was available, the new stations were built on confined corner sites at main road junctions in areas that had been already developed. Holden made good use of this limited space and designed impressive buildings. The street-level structures are of white Portland stone with tall double-height ticket halls, with the famous London Underground roundel made up in coloured glass panels in large glazed screens. The stone columns framing the glass screens are surmounted by a capital formed as a three-dimensional version of the roundel. The large expanses of glass above the entrances ensure that the ticket halls are bright and, lit from within at night, welcoming. The first and last new stations on the extension, Clapham South and Morden, include a parade of shops and were designed with structures capable of being built above (like many of the earlier central London stations). Clapham South was extended upwards soon after its construction with a block of apartments; Morden was extended upwards in the 1960s with a block of offices. All the stations on the extension, except Morden itself, are Grade II listed buildings.\nThe resulting line became known as the \"Morden\u2013Edgware line\", although a number of alternative names were also mooted in the fashion of the contraction of Baker Street &amp; Waterloo Railway to \"Bakerloo\", such as \"Edgmor\", \"Mordenware\", \"Medgway\" and \"Edgmorden\". With Egyptology very much in fashion after the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun in 1922, there was also a proposal to call the line the Tootancamden Line as it passed through both Tooting and Camden. It was eventually named the \"Northern line\" from 28 August 1937, reflecting the planned addition of the Northern Heights lines.\nAfter the UERL and the Metropolitan Railway (MR) were brought under public control in the form of the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) in 1933, the MR's subsidiary, the Great Northern &amp; City Railway, which ran from Moorgate to Finsbury Park, became part of the Underground as the Northern City Line. In preparation for the Northern Heights Plan, it was operated as part of the Northern line, although it was never connected to it.\nThe Northern Heights.\nIn June 1935, the LPTB announced the New Works Programme, an ambitious plan to expand the Underground network which included the integration of a complex of existing London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) lines north of Highgate through the Northern Heights. These lines, built in the 1860s and 1870s by the Edgware, Highgate and London Railway (EH&amp;LR) and its successors, ran from Finsbury Park to Edgware via Highgate, with branches to Alexandra Palace and High Barnet. The line taken over would be extended beyond Edgware to Brockley Hill, Elstree South and Bushey Heath with a new depot at Aldenham. The extension's route was that planned for the unbuilt Watford and Edgware Railway (W&amp;ER), using rights obtained from the earlier purchase of the W&amp;ER (which had long intended an extension of the EH&amp;LR Edgware route towards Watford). This also provided the potential for further extension in the future; Bushey's town planners reserved space in Bushey village for a future station and Bushey Heath station's design was revised several times to ensure this option would remain available in the future.\nThe project involved electrification of the surface lines (operated by steam trains at the time), the doubling of the original single-line section between Finchley Central and the proposed junction with the Edgware branch of the Northern line, and the construction of three new linking sections of track: a connection between Northern City Line and Finsbury Park station on the surface; an extension from Archway to the LNER line near East Finchley via new deep-level platforms below Highgate station; and a short diversion from just before the LNER's Edgware station to the Underground's station of the same name.\nThe peak-hour service pattern was to be 21 trains an hour each way on the High Barnet branch north of Camden Town, 14 of them via the Charing Cross branch and seven via the Bank branch. 14 would have continued on beyond Finchley Central, seven each on the High Barnet and Edgware branches. An additional seven trains an hour would have served the High Barnet branch, but continued via Highgate High-Level and Finsbury Park to Moorgate, a slightly shorter route to the City. It does not seem to have been intended to run through trains to the ex-Northern City branch from Edgware via Finchley Central. Seven trains an hour would have served the Alexandra Palace branch, to/from Moorgate via Highgate High-Level. In addition to the 14 through trains described, the ex-Northern City branch would have had 14 four-car shuttle trains an hour.\nWork began in the late 1930s, and was in progress on all fronts by the outbreak of World War II. The tunnelling northwards from the original Highgate station (now Archway) had been completed, and the service to the rebuilt surface station at East Finchley started on 3 July 1939, but without the opening of the intermediate (new) Highgate Station, at the site of the LNER's station of the same name. Further progress was disrupted by the start of the war, though enough had been made to complete the electrification of the High Barnet branch onwards from East Finchley over which tube services started on 14 April 1940; the new (deep-level) Highgate station opened on 19 January 1941. The single track LNER line to Edgware was electrified as far as Mill Hill East, including the Dollis Brook Viaduct, opening as a tube service on 18 May 1941 to serve the barracks there, thus forming the Northern line as it is today. The new depot at Aldenham had already been built and was used to build Halifax bombers. Work on the other elements of the plan was suspended late in 1939.\nPreparatory work including viaducts and a tunnel had been started but not completed on the Bushey extension pre-war. After the war, the area beyond Edgware was made part of the Metropolitan Green Belt, largely preventing the anticipated residential development in the area, and the potential demand for services from Bushey Heath thus vanished. Available funds were directed towards completing the eastern extension of the Central line instead, and the Northern Heights plan was dropped on 9 February 1954. Aldenham depot was converted into an overhaul facility for buses.\nThe implemented service from High Barnet branch gave good access both to the West End and the City. This appears to have undermined traffic on the Alexandra Palace branch, still run with steam haulage to Kings Cross via Finsbury Park, as Highgate (low-level) was but a short bus ride away and car traffic was much lighter than it would become later. Consequently, the line from Finsbury Park to Muswell Hill and Alexandra Palace via the surface platforms at Highgate was closed altogether to passenger traffic in 1954. This contrasts with the decision to electrify the Epping-Ongar branch of the Central line, another remnant of the New Works programme, run as a tube-train shuttle from 1957. A local pressure group, the Muswell Hill Metro Group, campaigns to reopen this route as a light-rail service. So far there is no sign of movement on this issue: the route, now the Parkland Walk, is highly valued by walkers and cyclists, and suggestions in the 1990s that it could, in part, become a road were met with fierce opposition. Another pressure group has proposed using the track bed further north, as part of the North and West London Light Railway. The connection between Drayton Park and the surface platforms at Finsbury Park was opened in 1976, when the Northern City Line became part of British Rail.\nRecent developments.\nIn 1975, the Northern City Line, known by that time as the Highbury branch, was transferred from London Underground to British Rail; it is now served by Great Northern. In the past, before the introduction of the 1995 stock, the Northern line was sometimes nicknamed the \"Misery Line\" in the press because of its perceived unreliability.\nIn 2003, a train derailed at Camden Town. Although no one was hurt, points, signals and carriages were damaged, and the junctions there were not used while repairs were under way: trains coming from Edgware worked the Bank branch only, and trains from High Barnet and Mill Hill East worked the Charing Cross branch only. This situation was resolved when the junctions reopened, after much repair work and safety analysis and testing by contractor, on 7 March 2004.\nOn 7 July 2005 a defective train on the Northern line (causing its subsequent suspension) saved a Northern line train from being blown up as part of a terrorist attack on the London Underground and bus systems. Three trains on the Circle and Piccadilly lines were blown up. The Northern line bomber-to-be instead boarded a bus, which he later blew up.\nOn 13 October 2005 the Northern line service was suspended due to maintenance problems with the emergency braking system on the entire train fleet. A series of rail replacement buses was used to connect outlying stations with other Underground lines. Full service was restored on 18 October.\nFrom June 2006, the service between East Finchley and Camden Town was suspended for two non-consecutive weekends every month, with service on the Edgware branch suspended for the other two weeks. This was part of Tube Lines's redevelopment of some Edgware and High Barnet Branch stations, including replacement of track, signals, as well as station maintenance. This included refurbishment of all High Barnet branch stations from West Finchley to Camden Town. In October 2006, off-peak service between Mill Hill East and Finchley Central was cut back to a shuttle, except for a few weekend through trains.\nOn 13 August 2010, a defective rail maintenance train caused disruption on the Charing Cross branch, after it travelled four miles in 13 minutes without a driver. The train was being towed to the depot after becoming faulty. At Archway station, the defective train became detached and ran driverless until coming to a stop at an incline near Warren Street station. This caused morning rush-hour services to be suspended on this branch. All passenger trains were diverted via the Bank branch, with several not stopping at stations until they were safely on the Bank branch.\nThe Northern line was originally scheduled to switch to automatic train operation in 2012, using the same SelTrac S40 system as used since 2009 on the Jubilee line and for a number of years on the Docklands Light Railway. Originally the work was to follow on from the Jubilee line so as to benefit from the experience of installing it there, but that project was not completed until spring 2011. Work on the Northern line was contracted to be completed before the 2012 Olympics. It is now being undertaken in-house, and TfL predicted the upgrade would be complete by the end of 2014. The first section of the line (West Finchley to High Barnet) was transferred to the new signalling system on 26 February 2013 and the line became fully automated on 1 June 2014 with the Chalk Farm to Edgware via Golders Green section being the last part of the line to switch to ATO."}

It forms a loop line around the centre of London on the north side of the River Thames. Platforms are 120 metres long in the south and 130 metres long on the part of the track shared with the Metropolitan line.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nIn 1863 the Metropolitan Railway opened in London between Paddington and Farringdon. It was the world's first underground railway. It connected the Great Western Railway's relatively remote terminus at Paddington with Euston and King's Cross stations and the City, London's financial heart. In the same year a report recommended an 'inner circle' of railway lines between the London termini that had been built or were under construction. In the next year the Metropolitan District Railway (commonly known as the District Railway) was formed to build and operate a railway from South Kensington to Tower Hill. The Metropolitan western extension opened in 1868 from a new station at Paddington to South Kensington. By May 1870 the District railway had opened its line from West Brompton to Blackfriars via Gloucester Road and South Kensington, services being operated at first by the Metropolitan. In 1871 the District had built a terminus at Mansion House, and on 18 November 1876 the Met opened its terminus at Aldgate. Due to conflict between the two companies it took an Act of Parliament before further work was done on the inner circle. In 1882 the Metropolitan extended its line from Aldgate to a temporary station at Tower Hill and the District completed its line to Whitechapel. On 6 October 1884 the temporary station was replaced with a joint station and the inner circle was complete. The Metropolitan provided the clockwise or 'outer rail' trains, the District the 'inner rail' or anti-clockwise.\nOther circle routes.\nAs well as the inner circle, other routes circumnavigated London, although these were not complete loops. From 1872 the L&amp;NWR began an \"outer circle\" service from Broad Street to Mansion House via Willesden Junction and Earl's Court, diverting an earlier service that had run to Victoria; and the GWR began a \"middle circle\" service from Moorgate to Mansion House via Latimer Road and Earl's Court. Both of these routes were cut back to Earl's Court: the \"middle circle\" in 1900 and the \"outer circle\" in 1909. The GWR service survived as a shuttle service from the Hammersmith &amp; City line to Addison Road, now Kensington (Olympia), until 1940.\nThe Midland Railway briefly ran a \"super outer circle\" from St Pancras to Earl's Court from 1878 to 1880. Today London Overground runs services between Clapham Junction, Willesden Junction and Dalston Junction and between Dalston Junction and Clapham Junction.\nElectrification.\nWooden carriages were originally hauled by steam locomotives leading to smoke-filled stations and carriages, unpopular with passengers. At the start of the 20th century the District and Metropolitan were seeing increased competition in central London from the new electric underground tube lines and trams, and conversion to electric traction was seen as the way forward. Experiments were carried out on the Earl's Court to High Street Kensington section, and a jointly-owned six-carriage train began passenger service in 1900. Following this an AC system was suggested, and this was accepted by both parties. However, the District was looking for a way to raise the finance needed and in 1901 found an investor, the American Charles Yerkes. He formed the Underground Electric Railways of London (UERL), and his experience in the United States led him to favour DC, with third-rail pick-up similar to that in use on the City &amp; South London Railway and Central London Railway. After arbitration by the Board of Trade the DC system was taken up, and the railways began electrifying the routes, using multiple-unit stock.\nThe District and Metropolitan Railways bought different designs of electric multiple unit. Both had open saloons; the Metropolitan trains with gated ends, the District B Stock with sliding doors in the middle of each car. When their introduction was attempted on 1 July 1905, a Metropolitan train overturned the third rail on the District Railway, requiring all Metropolitan trains to be modified before running again on the District lines. Full electric service started on 24 September, initially with 6-car trains, later reduced to 4-car. The Metropolitan trains were soon modified to enclose the gated end and eventually to add sliding doors in the middle. Trains were increased to 5 cars in 1918 and the Metropolitan introduced new stock in 1921, with three pairs of sliding double doors on trailer cars. In 1926 the Metropolitan took over all inner circle workings except for three trains on Sundays.\nLondon Transport.\nOn 1 July 1933 the Metropolitan and the District Railways were amalgamated with other Underground railways, tramway companies and bus operators to form the London Passenger Transport Board. Metropolitan Railway electric multiple units were refurbished in 1934 at Acton Works to become eighteen 5-car trains of Circle Stock, at first painted red and cream, later painted red all over to reduce costs. These trains included first-class accommodation, but this was downgraded in 1940. From 1947 these were replaced by 5-car trains of O and P Stock, with doors remotely operated by the guard, released by the transfer of F Stock to the Uxbridge line. The 1933 London Underground Beck map shows a Metropolitan line north of and stations and a District line south of these points. On the 1947 map the Metropolitan and District lines were shown together in the same colour and two years later in 1949 the Circle line was shown separately on the map.\nIn 1959\u20131960 Circle line trains were increased to 6 cars, the same length as those operating on the Hammersmith &amp; City line, and the stock of the two lines was integrated with maintenance concentrated at Hammersmith depot, allowing Neasden depot to concentrate on the new A Stock. Aluminium C Stock trains, with public address systems and originally unpainted, replaced these trains from 1970. One person operation of the trains was proposed in 1972 but, due to conflict with the trade unions, was not introduced until 1984. In 2003, the infrastructure of the Circle line was partly privatised in a public\u2013private partnership, managed by the Metronet consortium. Metronet went into administration in 2007 and the local government body Transport for London took over responsibilities.\nOn 7 July 2005, at about 08:50, bombs exploded on two Circle line trains. One was travelling between Liverpool Street and Aldgate and the other was at Edgware Road. The bombs killed 15 people, including the two suicide bombers. Following the attacks, the whole of the Circle line was closed until 8 August.\nA day before a ban on drinking alcohol on public transport in London came into force, a party was held on 31 May 2008, mainly on the Circle line. Thousands of people attended and 17 were arrested by police due to disorderly behaviour, eventually causing several stations to be closed.\nExtension.\nPrior to 13 December 2009, Circle line trains travelled in both directions around a simple loop with 27 stations and of track. In 2006 there were fourteen trains in service on the line with an interval between trains of \u00a0minutes during peak hours and 8 minutes off-peak; the minimum running time around the circle off-peak was \u00a0minutes, although timetabled stops at stations extended this.\nIn December 2009 the Circle line was extended to include the Hammersmith &amp; City route from Edgware Road to Hammersmith. Rather than continuously running around the circle, trains now travel from Hammersmith to Edgware Road, generally going around the circle once before terminating at Edgware Road, and returning via the same route; occasionally, trains may also continue clockwise through Edgware Road to additional stations. The change was made to improve reliability and increase the service frequency on the Hammersmith branch.\nThe first S7 Stock train entered passenger service on the Hammersmith &amp; City line on 6 July 2012, running a shuttle service between Hammersmith and Moorgate, and first ran on the Circle line on 2 September 2013. By June 2014 all services were provided by S7 Stock trains."}

It is coloured in TfL's Corporate Magenta on the Tube map and in other branding. It was the first underground railway (or subway) in the world, opening on 10 January 1863. Today, part of that section are no longer served by the Metropolitan line, but by the Hammersmith &amp; City, District and Circle lines. The main line runs from Aldgate in the City of London to Amersham, with branch lines to Uxbridge, Watford and Chesham. The line once went as far as Verney junction. After it was bought by the London Passenger Transport Board, the line was first cut back to Aylesbury, then to Amersham\nThe line runs parallel to Chiltern Railways London to Aylesbury line from Finchley Road to Amersham. Chiltern railways continues to run services to Aylesbury.\nHistory.\nMetropolitan Railway.\nThe Metropolitan Railway (also known as the Met) was a passenger and goods railway that served London from 1863 to 1933, its main line heading north-west from the City to what were to become the Middlesex suburbs. Its first line connected the mainline railway termini at , and King's Cross to the City, built beneath the New Road using the cut-and-cover method between Paddington and King's Cross, and in tunnel and cuttings beside Farringdon Road from King's Cross to near Smithfield. It opened on 10 January 1863 with gas-lit wooden carriages hauled by steam locomotives, the world's first underground railway. In 1871, when plans were presented for an underground railway in Paris, it was called the \"M\u00e9tropolitain\" in imitation. The modern word metro is a short form of the French word.\nThe railway was soon extended from both ends and northwards via a branch from Baker Street. It reached Hammersmith in 1864 and Richmond in 1877, and completed the \"Inner Circle\" in 1884, but the most important route became the line north into the Middlesex countryside, where it stimulated the development of new suburbs. Harrow was reached in 1880, and the line extended as far as in Buckinghamshire, more than from Baker Street. From the end of the 19th century, the railway shared tracks with the Great Central Railway route out of Marylebone station.\nElectric traction was introduced in 1905 with electric multiple units operating between Uxbridge, Harrow-on-the-Hill and Baker Street. To remove steam and smoke from the tunnels in central London, the railway purchased electric locomotives, exchanged for steam locomotives at Harrow from 1908. In 1910, a seventeen-minute silent film recording was made showing large portions of the journey from Baker Street to Aylesbury and Uxbridge, seen from the cab of a train. The film survives and is publicly available.\nUnlike other railways in the London area, the Met developed land for housing, thus benefitting from the increase in the value of its land caused by the building of the railway. After World War I it promoted its housing estates near the railway with the \"Metro-land\" brand.\nTo improve services, more powerful electric and steam locomotives were purchased in the 1920s. A short branch opened from Rickmansworth to Watford in 1925. After World War I, the Stanmore branch was built from Wembley Park.\nLondon Transport.\nOn 1 July 1933 the Metropolitan was amalgamated with other Underground railways, tramway companies and bus operators to form the London Passenger Transport Board, and a period of rationalisation followed.\nWhile the Metropolitan was run as an outer suburban route with steam-hauled trains and goods services, the LPTB wished to focus on electrified trains and suburban traffic. Goods services were passed to the London and North Eastern Railway, which also took over the role of providing steam locomotives for trains beyond the end of electrification at Rickmansworth. All services north-west of were withdrawn by 1936 though services returned to between 1943 and 1948.\nThe 1930s was a period of rapid growth for the north-western suburbs of London, and LPTB developed ambitious plans to simplify the Metropolitan line and expand capacity. Several stations on the Uxbridge branch were rebuilt, replacing temporary wooden buildings with modernist designs and giving Uxbridge station a new site in the town centre. A major bottleneck in the line, the double-track tunnel from Baker Street to Finchley Road, was bypassed by boring two tube tunnels underneath the Metropolitan tunnels, transferring slow services and the Stanmore branch to the Bakerloo line. (This route was transferred to the Jubilee line in 1979.) In 1936 the line was extended east from to along the tracks of the District line. London Transport inherited a number of incompatible electric multiple units from the railway, including the 1927\u201333 multiple-unit compartment stock used on routes to Watford and Rickmansworth, and these were refurbished to form a uniform fleet and designated London Underground T Stock. In the 1950s, F Stock trains, with sliding doors under the control of the guard, were transferred from the District line; these mainly worked the semi-fast Harrow and Uxbridge services.\nA major rebuilding of the main line from Wembley Park to Amersham was planned in the 1930s but delayed by the war. The line from Wembley to Harrow was rebuilt immediately after the war and the project was completed from 1956\u20131962, on a more modest scale than originally planned. Until 1961, passenger trains continued to be attached to a steam locomotive at to run to Aylesbury. The rebuilding electrified the line from Rickmansworth to Amersham, transferring all Aylesbury services to British Railways. A pair of fast lines was added from Harrow to north of Moor Park by 1962, allowing outer-suburban trains to run fast to Moor Park. Aluminium A stock, originally unpainted, replaced the T stock and locomotive-hauled trains. More A Stock trains were built in 1962\u201363 to replace the trains on the Uxbridge service, giving the main line a single train type for all services. A Stock was 4-car units that could operate as four- or eight-car trains; normally operated as eight cars, a 4-car unit operated the Chesham shuttle. One person operation of the trains was proposed in 1972, but due to conflict with the trades unions was not introduced on the line until 1986.\nA separate identity.\nAlthough the East London line had been an isolated shuttle since 1939, it was shown on London Underground maps as part of the Metropolitan line until 1968. In 1970 it was shown with a thin white line in the middle and labelled the \"East London section\". By the 1985 map it had become the \"East London Line\", remaining the same colour as the Metropolitan line with a white line in the middle, changed to orange by the 1990 map. In 1990 the Hammersmith &amp; City line became a separate line from Hammersmith to Whitechapel (Barking during the peak), the Metropolitan line being from Aldgate to Baker Street and northwards to Amersham with branches to Chesham, Uxbridge and Watford.\nIn 2003, the infrastructure was partly privatised in a public\u2013private partnership managed by the Metronet consortium. Metronet went into administration in 2007 and Transport for London took over responsibilities in the end. Tube Lines was later acquired by TfL in 2011, and managed as owner-designer firm.\nOn 12 December 2010 the service to Amersham was reduced from four trains per hour to two, and a direct service between Chesham and central London was introduced, replacing the 4-car Chesham to Chalfont &amp; Latimer shuttle. The final passenger services operated by the A Stock ran on 26 September 2012, followed by a ticketed public railtour on 29 September."}

{"id": "190713", "revid": "17988", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=190713", "title": "Plasma display", "text": "Televisions with plasma display panel (PDP) are much thinner than cathode ray tubes and are usually higher definition. Only a few television use a PDP.\nPlasma screens are made of two sheets of glass with two gases stored between the sheets. The gases are xenon and neon and they fill thousands of tiny chambers, or spaces. Behind each space are a series of red, blue and green phosphors that give off light when struck by radiation. When electricity connects to the plasma chambers the colored phosphors produce the right color on your screen. They work in a very similar way to fluorescent lamps used for lighting.\nPlasma screens have been in use since 1964 but only two colors could be produced then. Now we have high definition Plasma screens up to 150 inches in size. In the early 21st century fewer plasma screens were made as people bought more liquid crystal displays.\nAdvantages.\nPlasma TVs have more pixels (tiny dots that when put together can create an image on a picture) per inch than the old fashioned cathode ray tube (CRT) screens so they can produce a much sharper image. In the old style of CRT screens the pictures were made up of lines. If you look closely at a Plasma screen you will not see any lines. You will find out that most Plasma screens have a wide screen option so you can see movies in the way they were intended for movie theaters. They are also ideal for the latest digital broadcasting methods.\nOne of the big advantages is the space saving. The problem with old cathode ray tubes is that they needed a lot of space so that the rays can fire upon all areas of the screen. The wider the screen, the larger the volume of the television would be. The average Plasma television is around 6 to 8 inches deep. Moving your Plasma onto the wall can really increase the amount of floor space and they can be looked at from almost any point in the room (usually 180 degrees)\nPlasma screens are also very light especially when compared to a rear projection TV. A 40-inch Plasma TV will weigh from and provided you purchase a suitable bracket (that can hold the TV up to the wall) they can be hung very easily to a suitable wall. When fixing to the wall you need to make sure you choose a bracket which tells you the highest weight it can carry. Most brackets can be tilted if you want to view from a different angle.\nPlasma TVs can display up to 16 million colors so not only are they great for watching TV programs, they also make a good screen for the latest computer games consoles. Most Plasma TV's have inputs for HDMI and laptop computers connections making them ideal to use to display products and sales messages in offices and shops.\nYou will also find out that they are very easy to watch even on a sunny day or a very bright room. Unlike the old CRT screens they are not hard to see in bright areas.\nDisadvantages.\nBecause of the phosphor technology in Plasma TVs, it is possible for traces of an image to be 'burned-in' to the display, meaning you might see little traces of it even while watching other images. This is a concern in commercial uses, where images are shown for long periods of time. Burn-in can generally be avoided by making sure the screen does not show the same image for a long time (sometimes as little as 20 minutes), either by turning the television off, or changing the channel.\nThough Plasma TVs are much brighter than rear-projection TVs, direct view and LCD TVs are often brighter still. Latest generation Plasma TVs have improved on brightness, but a warning is do not view where it is too bright or sunny.\nAlthough Plasma TVs are much lighter and thinner than direct view and rear projection TVs, an LCD TV can be even more light and slim. LCD TVs use the same technology as used in most laptop computers. Plasma TVs are available in larger sizes that LCD TVs. Plasma screen TVs cost more than CRTs and LCDs.\nHow Long Do They Last?\nCompared to other television technologies, Plasma TVs have a shorter life span. Most Plasma TVs have a life span of 20,000-30,000 hours based on maker's estimates. This life span is commonly referred to as the Plasma TV half-life, as it is the number of hours over which the Plasma TV will lose approximately half of its brightness.\nPlasma TVs break easily, and the parts are quite easy to damage. They should only be moved carefully.\nAs technology has been made better, Plasma screens have a much longer life and you should expect 30,000 hours of use. In other words, your television would need to be on for 16 hours a day, every day for the next 5 years. By the time your TV needs replacing higher definition models will have become available.\nWorth the money?\nThe first Plasma televisions for home use were expensive, as much as US$5000 for a basic small model. As the technology improved and production increased, prices became smaller. In the 21st century some 37-inch models sold for $1000 or even less. Buying a CRT television became rare as LCD became the usual kind."}

They consider who is likely to wear a garment and the situations in which it will be worn. They have a range of materials to work with and a wide range of colors, patterns and styles to choose from. \nSome clothes are made specifically for an individual, as in the case of haute couture or bespoke tailoring. Today, most clothing is designed for the mass market, especially casual and every-day wear.\nHistory.\nFashion design started in the 19th century with Charles Frederick Worth, who was the first designer to have his label sewn into the garments he created. Worth's success was such that he was able to dictate to his customers what they should wear, instead of following their lead as earlier dressmakers had done. The term \"couturier\" was in fact first created in order to describe him. While all articles of clothing from any time period are studied by academics as costume design, only clothing created after 1858 is considered fashion design.\nDuring this period many design houses began to hire artists to sketch or paint designs for garments. The images were shown to clients, which was much cheaper than producing an actual sample garment in the workroom. If the client liked their design, they ordered it and the resulting garment made money for the house. Thus, the tradition of designers sketching out garment designs began as an economy.\nTypes of fashion.\nThe garments produced by clothing manufacturers fall into three main categories, although these may be split up into additional, more specific categories\nHaute couture.\nUntil the 1950s, fashion clothing was predominately designed and manufactured on a made-to-measure or haute couture basis. Each garment was made for a specific client. A couture garment is made to order for an individual customer, and is usually made from high-quality, expensive fabric, sewn with extreme attention to detail and finish, often using time-consuming, hand-executed techniques. Look and fit take priority over the cost of materials and the time it takes to make. Due to the high cost of each garment, haute couture makes little direct profit for the fashion houses, but is important for prestige and publicity.\nReady-to-wear (pret-a-porter).\nReady-to-wear clothes have elements of haute couture and mass market. They are not made for individual customers, but great care is taken in the choice and cut of the fabric. Clothes are made in small quantities to guarantee exclusivity, so they are rather expensive. Ready-to-wear collections are usually presented by fashion houses each season during a period known as Fashion Week. This takes place on a city-wide basis and occurs twice a year. The main seasons of Fashion Week include, spring/summer, fall/winter, resort, swim, and bridal.\nMass market.\nCurrently the fashion industry relies more on mass market sales. The mass market caters for a wide range of customers, producing ready-to-wear garments using trends set by the famous names in fashion. They often wait around a season to make sure a style is going to catch on before producing their own versions of the original look. In order to save money and time, they use cheaper fabrics and simpler production techniques which can easily be done by machine. The end product can therefore be sold much more cheaply."}

The point of the game is to find all of the words hidden in the grid.\nThe puzzle consists of a grid of letters that is usually a rectangle or square shape, but different shapes are possible, some that even look like an object like a plant or animal. Besides the grid is a list of words. The letters in the word appear in order somewhere in the grid, and can be placed horizontally, vertically or diagonally. A letter in the grid can be used in more than one word, and not all the letters in the grid have to appear in a word.\nTo solve the puzzle, a person has to find the place where each word is hidden in the grid, and when he or she finds that place, he or she circles all the letters in the word (as shown in the example), and then crosses the word off the list so that he or she knows not to look for that word again. It is easier to find the bigger words first since they have more letters.\nMany word search puzzles have a theme, so all the hidden words are related. Sometimes, once all the words have been found, the letters which have not been used in any of the words (that is, the letters which have not been circled at least once) spell another word or even a short message. An example of a word search with both a theme and a word made up of unused letters is .\nLike other puzzles, word searches are commonly found in newspapers and magazines, which print a different puzzle every day and show the solution in another place or in the next issue.

Amy is also facing the difficulties of her family coming apart, and other problems with her friends and boyfriend \"Ben Boykevich\" (played by Kenny Baumann).\nPlot.\nDuring the summer at band camp, Amy Juergens meets Richard \"Ricky\" Underwood, who persuades her into having sex. Amy learns that she has conceived a child at the beginning of the school year. Her best friends \"Lauren Treacy\" (played by Camille Winbush) and \"Madison Cooperstein\" (played by Renee Olstead) are the first ones to know about her being pregnant. Madison unknowingly spreads word that Amy is pregnant, and Amy considers abortion before telling her parents. Soon, Amy's younger sister Ashley finds out. After some time during an argument at the Juergens' home, Amy admits being pregnant and her boyfriend Ben learns too. Ben remains faithful to her during and after her pregnancy. So that the child is not born out of wedlock, Ben and Amy secretly get married illegally.\nMeanwhile, Ricky develops relationships with \"Adrianne Lee\" (played by Francia Raisa), \"the school slut\" and \"Grace Bowman\", a spunky, innocent girl. Ricky gets Adrianne to have sex, but fails trying to have sex with Grace, who had wanted to save herself for marriage to her on-and-off boyfriend \"Jack Pappas\" who betrayed her by sleeping with Adrianne.\nAmy's parents, \"George Juergens\" (played by Mark Derwin) and \"Anne Juergens\" (played by Molly Ringwald) start having tensions and get a divorce. After the divorce of Anne and George, Amy's child is born. The baby was named John by Ashley because it was a \"clean simple name, his life would already be complicated enough\". Ashley and her father (George) moved in together in a house next door, and Anne is expecting a baby boy of her own after she slept with her new boyfriend, David. The baby turns out not to be David's, but it's George's. George and Anne will move back in together, which Amy does not like. Amy's nemesis Adrianne is moving into George's old house, which Amy does not like either because Adrian only wants to spy on her boyfriend, Ricky, and Amy. Amy does not want Adrianne near her baby.\nGrace has sex with her boyfriend Jack against her father's will. After that Marshall Bowman passes away in a jet crash and Grace lives in misery thinking she killed her father by sleeping with Jack. She thinks God is punishing her. She starts a teen abstinence group (TAG) and a dead parents club.\nMeanwhile, Ben Boykevich wants to go to Bologna, Italy for the summer to work. Amy feels insecure, because she is worried Ben might fall in love with someone else. Amy wants to go, but can not because she has to care for John. Since she can not go, she wants Ben to stay where she can keep any eye on him, but Ben goes to Italy anyway. When he comes back, his personality is changed and Amy thinks that Ben slept or fell in love with someone else. When she asks Ben if he fell in love in Italy, he says no but Amy thinks he's lying, and she thinks Adrianne might know whether he is telling the truth or not. This sparks part of Amy's hatred for Adrianne.\nBen's dad falls in love with a former prostitute named Betty, but Ben does not trust her at first, because he thinks Betty is only in love with his dad for his money. Betty tries to relate to Ben, but Ben is uneasy because Amy does not like Betty either. Betty tries to reassure Ben that she loves his Dad for his heart and not his money, and Ben decides to give her a chance."}

He was famous for conducting opera, but also conducted orchestral concerts. He worked a lot with the orchestra of the Royal Opera House as well as Opera Australia.\nWhen he was old he was almost totally blind and deaf and his wife was dying of cancer, so they both decided that they wanted to die together. They went to Switzerland where they were allowed to commit assisted suicide.\nEarly years.\nDownes was born in Birmingham, England. His father worked in a bank. He left school when he was 14 and got a simple job in a gas store where he earned 16s 10d (16 shillings and 10 pence, which is 84p in modern British money) a week. \nHe had been playing the piano and violin since he was five. When he was 16 he got a scholarship to the University of Birmingham where he studied English literature and music, and began playing the cor anglais. He then got a scholarship to study conducting at the University of Aberdeen.\nMarriage.\nIn the 1960s, he married Joan, a dancer with the Royal Ballet. She later became a choreographer and television producer. They had two children: a son, Caractacus (born December 1967), who became a musician and recording engineer, and a daughter, Boudicca, who became a video producer.\nConducting career.\nIn 1952 he started his work in the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden where he was assistant to Rafael Kubel\u00edk. He worked for the ROH for 17 years, becoming Associate Music Director in 1991. \nFrom 1970 he was Music Director of Australian Opera. He conducted the first performance in the new Sydney Opera House in 1973 conducting Prokofiev\u2019s opera \"War and Peace\". He was Chief Conductor of the Netherlands Radio Orchestra and the BBC Philharmonic.\nDownes was remembered in particular for conducting music by British composers. He was also especially fond of the operas by Verdi as well as the symphonies of Shostakovich. People often thought he looked like Shostakovich, especially when he wore his glasses.\nHe received the honour of CBE.\nIn his last years he could hardly see and so he could only conduct music that he knew from memory.\nDeath.\nWhen he was 85 he had become almost totally blind and deaf. His wife was dying of cancer and was in a lot of pain. They both wanted to die together, but in Britain it is against the law to help someone to die, so they decided to go to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland. There, surrounded by members of their family, they drank a fatal dose of barbiturates and died on 10 July 2009.\nSome people who support the idea of assisted suicide are hoping that this case may lead to more discussion which could bring about a change in the law in Britain and other countries."}

Normally, people who ask for assisted suicide are very ill and in a lot of pain, so they want someone to help them to die, for example by being given access to drugs which will kill them. Some people prefer the terms aid in dying or death with dignity to describe assisted suicide. The term euthanasia is sometimes used, although euthanasia is generally regarded as different to assisted suicide, as it involves causing a person to die rather than helping them to kill themselves.\nThe law about this varies a lot in different countries. In Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland and in three American states it is legal to help someone to die in these circumstances. However, in many countries it is not allowed, and the person who helps someone to die may be arrested and sent to prison.\nSome people who are very ill and want to die may go to these countries, such as Switzerland, in order to end their life."}

This means that, if a person is very ill and wants to die, the doctors and nurses help them to end their life. Only people who have a terminal illness or very bad physical or mental illnesses are allowed to be helped. The patients must be able to understand what is happening and decide for themselves that death is what they want.\nDignitas was started in 1998 by Ludwig Minelli, a Swiss lawyer. The law in Switzerland says that someone can help in an assisted suicide so long as they do not have any self-interest (for example, so long as they are not going to inherit money from the person who dies). The doctor has to meet the person on two occasions and make sure that the person really does wish to die. There must be evidence for this, i.e. the patient has to sign a paper, and two witnesses have to sign to say they saw the patient signing. If the patient is too ill to sign, a video film can be made. The patient is asked several times whether that is what they want. If everyone is absolutely sure, then he or she is given a drug which will kill them.\nSome people travel from other countries such as Britain to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland so that they can be helped to die. For example, the rugby player Daniel James, who was 23, had a terrible injury to his spine which left him paralysed from his chest down, travelled there with his parents to die. In 2009 the British conductor Edward Downes and his wife both travelled to Dignitas where they died together."}

{"id": "190948", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=190948", "title": "Euthanasia", "text": "Euthanasia is when a person's life is ended because of disease or pain, which has made them suffer. This is different from assisted suicide, where a person helps someone kill themselves. It is also different to murder, where the reason is not suffering, but to kill for the killer's own ends. Euthanasia can be voluntary, where the person who dies asks for help in ending their life. Where the person is unable to make their decision known, it is usually called \"non-voluntary euthanasia\". Where someone is killed against their will, it is usually called murder.\nEuthanasia is illegal in most countries. It is permitted in a small number of countries, such as the Netherlands, Belgium and Victoria, Australia. The New Zealand Parliament voted 69 - 51 to pass the End of Life choice Bill. In Is it Time to Kill the Kiwi the Rt Hon Simeon Brown said international precedents show that euthanasia regimes result in the involuntary death of innocent lives, often those who are marginalized\u00a0and vulnerable. The final decision will be made in a binding public referendum. Where it is permitted there are many rules, and only in cases where the patient is terminally ill. Though euthanasia is not legal in the United States, doctors can assist people to kill themselves. This is legal in Washington, Oregon, and Montana. Physician Assisted Suicide (PAD) is different to euthanasia; it is about who gives the medication to end a patient\u2019s life. The World Federation of Right to Die Societies says physician-assisted suicide means \"making lethal means available to the patient to be used at a time of the patient\u2019s own choosing.\" In these cases the patient takes the legal dose of poison themselves, it is not given by the doctor. It is euthanasia when the doctor has the main role in ending the patient\u2019s life by giving the poison. \nTypes of euthanasia.\nEuthanasia can be active or passive, and voluntary, non-voluntary and involuntary. Many people see important differences and they can accept some types but not others.\nActive and passive euthanasia.\nPassive euthanasia means letting a person die. A terminally ill person is allowed to die, even if treatment could help them to live longer. This includes removing life support, such as a ventilator which is being used to keep the person alive, or by not giving them food or water. Active euthanasia means doing something to end a person's life. This could be giving them an injection or pills that will cause their death.\nSome people see passive euthanasia as a more acceptable choice, because it is not a deliberate act to kill. However, others argue that once someone has decided to allow another person to die, they should make it as fast and as painless as possible, and then act to bring about their death. This is also known as mercy killing.\nVoluntary, non-voluntary and involuntary euthanasia.\nVoluntary euthanasia is when someone asks to be allowed to die or to be killed. This is often seen as the best option by people who believe in euthanasia, because it is clear that the person wants to die. If the person can not say that they want to die, but people think that they would ask to die if they could, then it is \"non-voluntary euthanasia.\" Non-voluntary euthanasia is a choice for people who are in a coma or who are very young, as they can not say what they want. \"Involuntary euthanasia\" is when someone is killed even though they asked not to die, or when they could have asked to die but did not. Many people think that this is murder, not euthanasia.\nThese types of euthanasia can be mixed. If someone asks to die, and another person gives them an injection that will kill them, then it is active voluntary euthanasia. Someone in a coma who is kept alive with a ventilator, and the doctors turn it off and they die, would be passive non-voluntary euthanasia.\nEuthanasia arguments.\nSome people believe that euthanasia should be allowed, and some people think that it should not.\nSlippery slope.\nSome people believe that allowing euthanasia will result in bad things happening. If it is allowed for people asking to die, then it might be allowed for people who are very sick but are not able to ask to die. If that happens, then maybe it would be allowed for people who are very sick and will not recover, but do not want to die. This is called the \"slippery slope\" argument. \nPeople who believe in the slippery slope argument point to times when this happened. In Germany, Adolf Hitler allowed disabled children to be killed, and called it euthanasia. People now agree that this was wrong, but if euthanasia was allowed it could happen again. They think it is too big a risk to allow euthanasia at all.\nOther people say there is a big difference between killing a very sick person who asks to die, and killing a child with a disability. They do not think euthanasia will lead to bad things. They say that Hitler's actions were not euthanasia.\nThe American Medical Association (AMA) and other doctors believe it is a doctor's role to help, not kill people. In one study 76% of doctors said they would not carry out euthanasia, even if it was legal. They feel patients would not trust them. In the Netherlands where euthanasia is legal, 60% of older people in one study were scared that their their doctors would kill them.\nAlternatives to euthanasia.\nPalliative care.\nPalliative care is when people who are ill and going to die are given special care to make them more comfortable. It may include hospice care, when the patient is sent to a special hospital for people who are dying. Palliative care can involve pain relief and help for the patient and family to come to terms with death. In some cases, doctors will give patient drugs which make them stay asleep, so that they will not feel pain.\nPalliative care is not perfect, and so it is not always seen as a replacement for euthanasia. There is still some pain, and there can be other side-effects, where the patient can still feel very sick. Palliative care is not available for all people, and not all people who wish to die through euthanasia are so sick that they will die soon. Some people have healthy bodies, but they are suffering in other ways, and palliative care will not always help them.\nPrinciple of double effect.\nThe principle of double effect was first described by Thomas Aquinas over 700 years ago. It says that it is sometimes alright to do a bad thing if something good happens, and if a bad ending was not wanted. Aquinas used the example of self defense: sometimes a person will kill someone who attacks them, but killing was not what the person was trying to do. They only wanted to protect themselves. So even though killing someone is bad, wanting to protect themselves was not.\nSome people say that doctors may treat a person to reduce the their pain, and as a result the person will die sooner. If the doctor gives the treatment in order to help the patient die, then it is euthanasia. But if the doctor gives the treatment in order to stop the pain, and does not intend for the patient to die, then it may not be euthanasia, even if the doctor knew that the treatment would kill the patient.\nAssisted suicide.\nSuicide is when a person kills themselves. Sometimes when a person is very sick they need help to die, and this is called assisted suicide. In some countries people are allowed to help as long as they do not kill the person, and it can be seen as a more acceptable option because it must be the person's own decision. Because the assisting person did not kill, it is not always considered to be euthanasia. "}

The term is mostly used for progressive diseases such as cancer or advanced heart disease. Someone who has a terminal illness may be described as a terminal patient or as being terminally ill. Usually a patient is called \"terminally ill\" when they are not expected to live more than 6 months. Medical conditions such as AIDS are not called terminal illnesses because the patient may live for many years before eventually dying of the illness.\nVery often, terminally ill patients are given palliative care to give them a better quality of life. Sometimes, they go to a hospice to be looked after."}

Then he continued his education at Keble College, Oxford. He was music director and organist of the new chapel at Princeton University between 1928 and 1935. During his time in America he learned a lot about organ building and listened to musicians playing baroque music.\nHe soon became famous for his recitals and radio broadcasts in which he played music using historical performance styles. He gave first performances of pieces by composers such as Darius Milhaud, Paul Hindemith and Arnold Schoenberg. Benjamin Britten invited him every year to perform at the Aldeburgh Festival.\nIn 1948, he was asked to design an organ for the new Royal Festival Hall. When the organ was first played in 1954 not everyone agreed that it was good, but soon it was realised that it was an excellent instrument for playing music from the Baroque and Classical music periods and it had a big influence on the way that other organs were built. \nDownes was Professor of Organ at the Royal College of Music from 1954 to 1975 and was the best known British organ teacher of his day. His students included Gillian Weir and Trevor Pinnock. He made many recordings and wrote a book about organ design.\nHe was given the honour of CBE in 1969. He died in London in 1993. There was no organ music at his funeral. Instead, he had asked for Gregorian chant to be sung."}

He was born in Walthamstow in East London.\nMorris was educated at Marlborough and Exeter College, Oxford. In 1856, he became an to Gothic revival architect G. E. Street. That year he founded the \"Oxford and Cambridge Magazine\". In 1861, Morris founded a design firm in partnership with the artist Edward Burne-Jones, and the poet and artist Dante Gabriel Rossetti. This had a great impact on the decoration of churches and houses in the early 20th century. Morris's major contribution was as a designer of repeating patterns for wallpapers and textiles. This was mainly based on a close observation of nature. He was also a major contributor to the resurgence of traditional textile arts and methods of production.\nMorris wrote and published poetry, fiction, and translations of ancient and medieval texts throughout his life, among others \"Story of Sigurd the Volsung and the Fall of the Niblungs\" (1876). His best-known works include \"The Defence of Guenevere and Other Poems\" (1858), \"The Earthly Paradise\" (1868\u20131870), \"A Dream of John Ball\" (1888) and the utopia \"News form Nowhere\" (1890). His poetry was strongly influenced by Geoffrey Chaucer's work. This influence can be seen in the use of rhyme royal.\nWilliam Morris designed his own furniture. He was frustrated, because he could not find any furniture he liked, so he decided, he wanted to design his own furniture, but it was mostly wallpaper designs.\nMorris was an important person in the emergence of socialism in Great Britain. He founded the Socialist League in 1884. However, he broke with the movement over goals and methods by the end of that decade. He devoted much of the rest of his life to the Kelmscott Press, which he founded in 1891. The 1896 Kelmscott edition of the \"Works of Geoffrey Chaucer\" is considered a masterpiece of book design."}

Because of the shortage of water, towns were started at Milparinka and Tibooburra where there was water available. Towns at Albert and Mount Browne did not last for long because of the lack of water. By 1881 there were more than 2000 people living on the gold diggings or in the towns. Geologist William Henry John Slee was appointed resident Goldfield Warden. The miners had to either take their dirt to one of the towns to use water to pan for the gold, or use a method called dry blowing. Dry blowing means breaking the dirt into fine particles and letting the wind blow away the dirt leaving the heavier gold behind. Life on the goldfields was hard, water was scarce, fresh fruit and vegetables were not available, and basics like flour were very expensive. Disease, including dysentery and typhoid were common.\nBy 1893 the gold rush had ended and most people had left the goldfields."}

Zhu Xi was one of the three most important Confucian philosophers. He organized the classic works of Confucianism and contributed to the philosophy of Neo-Confucianism.He was from Fujian province in China. \nLife.\nZhu Xi was born Wu Yuan, North East Jiangxi province. His father died when he was at the age of thirteen. He continued his studies until he passed the test for a government job. He taught for many years in the Wuyi Mountains and he is also remembered for the time he spent teaching at the Yuelu Academy in Changsha and at his retreat near the White Deer Grotto in Lushan. In his life his ideas were not generally accepted and he was fired from quite a lot of official positions. After his death nearly 1000 people were at his funeral and his tablet was put in a Confucian temple.\nThe Four Books.\nDuring the Song Dynasty, Zhu Xi's teachings were considered to be unorthodox. Rather than focusing on the \"Book of Changes\" like other Neo-Confucians, he chose to emphasize the Four Books: the \"Great Learning\", the \"Doctrine of the Mean\", the \"Analects of Confucius\", and the \"Mencius\" as the core curriculum (thing to learn) for aspiring scholar officials. For all these classics he wrote extensive commentaries (big reviews) that were not widely recognized in his time; however, they later became accepted as their standard commentaries. The Four Books served as the basis of civil service examinations all the way down to 1905.\nKnowledge and action.\nAccording to Zhu Xi, knowledge and action were indivisible components of truly intelligent activity. Although he did distinguish (tell apart) between the priority of knowing, since intelligent action requires forethought (thought before), and the importance of action, as it produces a discernible effect, Zhu Xi said \"Knowledge and action always require each other. It is like a person who cannot walk without legs although he has eyes, and who cannot see without eyes although he has legs. With respect to order, knowledge comes first, and with respect to importance, action is more important.\""}

By 1994, a short section of track existed, and the steam locomotive \"Sir Gomer\" hauled short passenger trains.\nBy 1997, the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation was in charge of the redevelopment of Butetown, and dismissed the idea of a rejuvenated steam railway as part of their plans.\nEven prior to 1997 the railway started negotiations with the Vale of Glamorgan Council and moved in during 1998 to its new base at Barry Island Railway.

It runs along the last section of the old Great Eastern Railway and London Underground Central line branch line. The line runs between Epping and Ongar. There is also an intermediate stop at North Weald. The line was reopened in late 2004 after 10 years of being closed. It runs a Sunday and Bank Holiday service using a Class 117 diesel multiple unit. The service runs between Ongar and Coopersale. The service is provided by volunteers who take care for the line as well as run the trains. The land and infrastructure are owned by Epping Ongar Railway Ltd.\nEarly workings.\nThe branch line to Ongar was built in 1865 by the Eastern Counties/Great Eastern Railway. The eastern section of the line, between Epping and Ongar, was single track. There was one passing loop at North Weald station. Around 14 trains went as far as Ongar station each day. The rest finished at Epping or Loughton.\nThe trains continued to finish at Epping or Loughton until 1949. At this time the London Passenger Transport Board's New Works project extended the Central line to Epping using electric trains. The Central Line would take over the railway from British Rail. As part of this change, the Epping-Ongar branch line had its through trains to London removed. Instead, a shuttle service between Epping (to connect with trains to London) and Ongar was used. At one stage, it was possible to see the unusual sight of steam trains and London Underground electric multiple units side-by-side at Epping. The steam shuttle was hired by the London Transport Executive from British Rail. This was because it was felt that the cost of electrifying the line to Ongar could not be justified because of the low passenger numbers on this part of the branch.\nIn the 1950s, there were attempts to improve the service on the branch line. Over time, permission was given to electrify the line in 1957. However, because the electrification did not cost much, the branch was only able to have special two- or three-car trains running on it. This was because the power supply was not strong enough to support trains that had more cars. Another problem was that the stations on the line had short platforms. This would mean that the normal 8-car trains would not be able to stop at them. Because of this, the Epping-Ongar branch line was normally operated separately from the rest of the Central Line. However, for two days each year, trains did run through from London. These trains would terminate at North Weald for the airshow on the Saturday and Sunday of its opening. The normal Epping-Ongar service would get around this extra service by passing the train on the other line at North Weald station whilst it headed towards Epping. The train from London was run as an extra train on the normal Central Line timetable. However, this extra train was only four carriages long instead of the normal eight.\nCutbacks and closure.\nDuring the late 1960s it became clear that the number of people using the line had not become as high as people thought that it would. Not a lot of new development was allowed because the land was now Green Belt land. The number of people using the line peaked in 1971, and it was still only 650 people every day. This meant that the line did not make very much money. London Underground tried to close the whole line in 1980, but they were not able to. Instead, fewer trains were run on the line and they also closed Blake Hall tube station on Sundays.\nBlake Hall was permanently closed in 1981. Before the station closed it only had six passengers a day. The station building still survives as a private residence. However, the platform was removed, but recently (2015) partially reinstated to a very high standard.\nNorth Weald station's platform one was closed in 1976. The passing loop and westbound tracks were lifted in 1978. Until this time, access to the two platforms was controlled from the original Eastern Counties Railway signal box. This signal box is still on the southbound platform. North Weald was the last section of the London Underground network to be signalled using semaphore signals.\nThe line was making a loss of seven pounds for each passenger journey. It was also in need of some expensive maintenance work. On 30 September 1994, the line was closed to the public, with one months notice. From this time on, the Central Line terminated at Epping station. When the line closed it was carrying just 80 passengers a day. Local lore said that the line was being kept open in case the Cabinet needed to be evacuated to the nuclear bunker at Kelvedon Hatch.\nCravens Heritage Trains have preserved a three-car unit of 1960 stock. This was the train that ran the final London Underground service on the line.\nPurchase and reopening.\nThe line was bought by Pilot Developments in 1998. Pilot Developments is now known as Epping Ongar Railway Ltd. The Ongar Railway Preservation Society also entered an offer to buy the line. Their offer was for \u00a3339,500. However, Pilot Developments matched the offer and got London Underground to accept it. Martin Bell, an independent politician, said that this was \"the most controversial land deal in the constituency for years\". He said that there was a conflict of interest with local politicians.\nThe line reopened on Sunday 10 October 2004. It is being run by the Epping Ongar Railway Volunteer Society. An hourly service between Ongar and North Weald was operated. Shortly after opening the line was extended to Coopersale. However, it is currently not possible to get off the train there.\nBetween 22 January and 9 April 2006 the line was closed for engineering works. The works included general station maintenance, rolling stock maintenance and track maintenance. Ongar station remained closed for engineering works and general maintenance and reopened on Sunday 28 May 2006 to passengers. At first though it was not possible to use the station buildings.\nAt the end of 2007, the railway was sold to a new private owner. This was because planning permission for the Ongar residential development had been given. The new owner wants to bring steam locomotives back to the line.\nIn early 2008, the line was closed to passenger trains. This was to allow the railway to be able to have major engineering works. The work will mean that steam locomotives will be able to run on the line again. To make this happen run-round loops and signalling, amongst other things, must be built.\nHeritage railway operations.\nPassenger services on the heritage line were operated throughout 2006 and 2007 by a Class 117 diesel multiple unit. This unit is currently being restored along with a class 205 DEMU. Class 37029 is in operation along with 03170. There are a selection of British rail Mk1 and Mk2 coaches on the line. The line also has some small diesel shunters; a Drewry shunter (works number 2566, current number D1995), named \"Heather\" by the railway, and two Ruston 88 shunters (RH 512572 is in service, RH 398616 is being used for spares and as a static display). The line employs a Harsco tug unit (\"Badger\") for engineering work. The EOR's fleet also includes a small works trolley, a Shark brake van, a Dogfish ballast hopper, and a box van for permanent way duties. \nAt one point the line owned two trains of 1962 tube stock. Units 1616 and 1491 (formed as an eight-car train) were purchased in 1996, and unit 1744 was purchased in 1998. These units were taken away to be cut up for scrap in 1998 and 2003, respectively, after they were destroyed by vandals."}

Unlike depth charges, mines are put in the water and left to wait until they make contact with a ship. Naval mines can be used offensively, to make it harder for enemy ships to sail easily, or trap them into a harbour. They can also be used defensively, to protect friendly ships and create \"safe\" zones.\nMines can be laid in many ways: by specially built minelayers, refitted ships, submarines, aircraft, or even by dropping them into a harbour by hand. They are a cheap weapon with a basic mine costing as little as US$1000. There are very advanced mines which can cost millions and have several kinds of sensors, and deliver a warhead by rocket or torpedo.\nInternational law says that nations have to say when they put mines in an area. This is to make it easier for civil shipping to avoid the mines. The warnings do not have to be specific; during World War II, Britain said simply that it had mined the English Channel, North Sea, and French coast."}

Seville, 1584; d. Segovia, 1654) was an important Spanish organist, composer, and theorist in the last years of the Renaissance and early years of the Baroque period.\nLife.\nWe do not know very much about Correa de Araujo. He was probably born in 1584. He may have been of Portugese origin. In 1599 he got a job as organist in Seville. It must have been an important job because he earned a lot of money. Many years later he seems to have become a priest. He may have been made a priest because he was a good organist. In 1630 he organized a protest when priests were made to work harder wothout being paid more money. Because he argued about this he was sent to prison for a time. By 1635 his health was very bad. In spite of earning a high salary he often had no money.\nAfter 37 years in Seville he took a job as organist in Ja\u00e9n Cathedral. He was there until 1640 when he went to Segovia Cathedral. He worked there until 1653, by which time he was too ill to work. When he died the following year he was very poor.\nHis music.\nCorrea only seems to have published one collection of organ works. It was called \"Libro de tientos y discursos de m\u00fasica practica, y theorica de organo intitulado Facultad organica\" (1626). This was a collection of organ music, as well as a discussion about music theory. It is one of the few books we have which shows us what musical composition was like in Spain at that time. His organ music uses a divided keyboard (medio registro), so that the upper and lower parts of the keyboard (high notes and low notes) can use different stops (making different sounds). The organ pieces in the collection are arranged in order of difficulty. The pieces at the end are very hard indeed. He uses a lot of dissonances, and he expects the performer to put in lots of ornaments, even if they are not shown in the music. He uses glosa (ornamental figuration), although he also uses counterpoint. His harmony shows the influence of composers such as Cabezon and Aguilera de Heredia."}

It involves co-operation and teamwork and the sharing of ideas, knowledge and skills to reach the same objective. The objective is usually creative in nature. Most collaboration needs leadership or some kind of co-ordination, although responsibilities can be shared within an egalitarian group.\nEach person plays a tightly or loosely defined role in the process of collaboration. For instance, to make a movie a writer, director, producer and actors are needed. There may also be a need for a costumer, a cameraman (if the director cannot do it all), an audio engineer, and a film editor if the project is big enough and the schedule tight enough."}

Its fruits are edible, and are generally used for cooking. This is different from the soft and sweet banana (which is often called \"dessert banana\"). \"Dessert bananas\" are more common to import in countries in the European Union or the United States.\nThe way certain species are called often show how they are used: \"cooking plantain\", \"banana plantain\", \"beer banana\", \"bocadillo plantain\" (the little one), etc. All members of the genus \"Musa\" are indigenous to the tropical region of Southeast Asia, including the Malay Archipelago and northern Australia.\nPlantains are often firmer than dessert bananas; they also have less sugar. Dessert bananas are often eaten raw; plantains are usually cooked or otherwise processed before they are eaten. Plantains are a staple food in tropical regions, treated similarly to potatoes. They also have a similar taste.\nPrimary cultivation originated in Southeast Asia, secondary in West Africa. Other regions with Plantain crops include the Southern United States, the Caribbean, Central America, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Southern Brazil, the Canary Islands, Madeira, Egypt, Cameroon, Nigeria, Uganda, Okinawa, Kerala and Taiwan. Farmers grow plantains as far north as Northern California and as far south as KwaZulu-Natal.\nUse of parts other than the fruit.\nPlantain flowers.\nEach pseudostem of a plantain plant will flower only once. All the flowers grow at the end of its shoot in a large bunch made of multiple \"hands\" with individual \"fingers\" (the fruits). Only the first few hands will become fruits. In Vietnam the young male flower, at the end of the bunch, is used to make salad. \nIn Laos, the plantain flower is often eaten raw; it is added to a special kind of soup. Thoran is made in Kerala with the end of the bunch (called \"Koompu\" in Malayalam and Vazhaipoo in Tamil). It is said to be very healthy. You can fry it or boil it\nPlantain leaves.\nPlantain leaves are used like plates in several dishes, including hallaca from Venezuela, or south Indian Thali. In southern India, meals are traditionally served on a plantain leaf. The position of the different food items on the leaf is important, also for Hindu rituals.\nThe plantain leaves often add an aroma to the dish. In the Indian state of Kerala, a food preparation called \"Ada\" is made in plantain leaves. Plantain leaves are also used in making \"Karimeen Pollichathu\" in Kerala.\nThe leaves are usually easy to find in Venezuela. They are sold at grocery stores, and they can be bought on the open-air markets there . Leaves can be very big, over in length. They are also used to stimulate appetite, as they have a distinctive smell when hot food is placed on them.\nIn Nicaragua, leaves are used to wrap different kinds of food, such as Nacatamales,Vigoron and Vaho. In Peru they are often used to wrap the famous Tamale (Tamales). In Honduras, Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia, these are usually used to wrap tamales before and while cooking, and they can be used to wrap any kind of seasoned meat while cooking to keep the flavor in. The plantain is the main food source of the Dominican Republic, and is used just as much as, if not more than, rice. Mangu and Sancocho are two dishes for which the plantain is very important.\nThe leaves are also dried and used to wrap corn dough before it is boiled to make Fanti kenkey, a fine Ghanaian dish eaten with ground pepper, onions, tomatoes and fish.\nPlantain shoot.\nThe plantain will only fruit once. After harvesting the fruit, the plantain plant can be cut and the layers peeled (like an onion) to get a cylinder shaped soft shoot. This can be chopped and first steamed, then fried with masala powder, to make an excellent dish. This dish is called \"Posola\" in Assamese and a distinct part of Assamese cuisine. "}

It is in the Palerang Shire. In 2006 there were 1,108 people living in Braidwood. It was used as a location for the movie Ned Kelly starring Mick Jagger in 1969.\nGeography.\nBraidwood is on the Kings Highway which joins Canberra to Batemans Bay on the coast. It is about south west of Sydney. It is in a highland area near the headwaters of the Shoalhaven River.\nHistory.\nEuropen explorers, Kearns, Marsh and Packer, reached the area in 1822 and the settlers arrived soon after. The town was surveyed in 1839. Gold was discovered in 1851, and over the next 20 years the population grew to about 10,000.\nThomas Braidwood Wilson.\nThe town was named after Dr Thomas Braidwood Wilson. He had been a surgeon on the ships taking convicts to New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land (now known as Tasmania). He was first given land in Van Diemen's Land in 1824, but changed it for land near Lake George in 1825. He was also given of land in the 'new country' on Monkittee and Flood creeks. In 1833 the government took back the western end of Wilson's land for a future village. They gave him more land at the eastern land in return. Wilson moved to the district in late 1836 with his wife and family. He became a community leader. He built the first courthouse in 1837-38. In 1840 Wilson asked the government to build a road from Braidwood to Huskisson for faster and cheaper shipping of wool to Sydney. Wilson and Col. John Mackenzie, supplied the materials and men to make the Braidwood to Nerriga section. In 1841 there were 141 people living at Braidwood Farm. Wilson lost all of his money because of a drought in the late 1830s. He died in November 1843. His land was sold for \u00a32,000 to John Coghill, who now owned most of the land on the south, east and north of the town. Wilson still owned land on a hill north of the town and was buried there in 1843.\nA memorial and large pine tree mark the site of Wilson's grave. The path to the grave is open to the public and is through a series of paddocks with gateway sculptures and large art pieces by local artists.\nBushrangers.\nBushrangers, Thomas and John Clarke, killed four policemen near Braidwood in 1867. There is a special monument for the police in the Braidwood cemetery.\nAustralia's first Royal Commission took place in Braidwood in 1867. It looked at the role of the police in trying to control bushrangers in the area. The Commission found the police were lazy, and in some cases had actually helped the bushrangers. They found that the superintendent of police did not have 'strict and proper control over his men.'\nGold rush.\nBecause of the goldrush the banks and hotels in Braidwood were well built and made to last. It is these old heritage buildings that now attract visitors to the town. Other businesses in the area are sheep and cattle farming, and timber growing.\nBraidwood today.\nBraidwood used to be the home of the Tallaganda local government area. However, following changes to local government areas by the New South Wales Government, it is now part of the Palerang council. The eastern office of the council is in the town. The local paper is now called the \"Braidwood Times\".\nAfter the gold rush, Braidwood became a quiet and poor country town. Because of this, very little new building work was carried out, and so the town still has most of its original streetscape and architecture intact. On 30 March 2006 the town and its setting were listed on the NSW State Heritage Register. There were arguments between those who wanted to save the town's old fashioned charm and those wishing to develop it.\nMovies.\nThe town has several times been used for movie making locations:\nLocal stories say that Mick Jagger wrote one of his major hits while in Braidwood making the \"Ned Kelly\" film; but there is no agreement as to which one."}

Scottish-born actor Mark McManus played the part of Kelly's friend Joe Byrne. It was a British production, but was filmed entirely in Australia, shot mostly around Braidwood in southern New South Wales, with mainly Australian actors.\nProblems.\nThere were many problems in getting the movie made. The actors' union, Actors' Equity and some of Ned Kelly's relatives protested strongly about Jagger having the lead role. Many people were upset that the movie would be made in New South Wales, not Victoria, where the Kellys had lived.\nJagger's girlfriend, Marianne Faithfull, had come to Australia to play the lead female role of Ned's sister, Maggie. Their relationship was breaking up, and she took an overdose of sleeping tablets soon after she got to Sydney. She was in a coma, but soon got better and went back to England. She was replaced by an unknown Australian actress, Diane Craig. During filming, Jagger was hurt by a pistol misfiring.

This is a deuterocanonical (or apocryphal) book of the Old Testament. The letter is believed to have been made by Jeremiah to the people who were to be taken prisoner into Babylon. It is included in Catholic Bibles as the last part of the Book of Baruch. It is also in Orthodox Bibles as a standalone book.\nAuthor.\nMost learned people argue that the person who started the book was not Jeremiah. Jeremiah was a Hellenistic Jew who lived in Alexandria. Whoever the starter, the work was written with a purpose: to teach the Jews not to worship the gods of the Babylonians. Instead, to worship only the Lord.\nPlace in religious law.\nThe letter (epistle) is part of the Septuagint. There is no evidence of it ever having been rule bearing in the Jewish tradition.\nThe earliest evidence we have of the question of its canonicity arising in Christian tradition is in the work of Origen of Alexandria, as reported by Eusebius in his Church History. Origen listed Lamentations and the Letter of Jeremiah as one unit with the Book of Jeremiah proper, among \"the canonical books as the Hebrews have handed them down\". \nJerome provided the majority of the translation work for the vulgar (popular) Latin translation of the Bible, called the Vulgate Bible. In view of the fact that no Hebrew text was available, Jerome refused to consider the Epistle of Jeremiah, as the other books he called apocryphal, canonical.\nDespite Jerome's reservations, the epistle is included as chapter 6 of the book of Baruch in the Old Testament of the Vulgate. The Authorized King James Version follows the same practice, while placing Baruch in the Apocrypha section. In the Ethiopian Orthodox canon, it forms part of the \"Rest of Jeremiah\", along with 4 Baruch (also known as the \"Paraleipomena of Jeremiah\").\nThe epistle is one of three deuterocanonical books found among the Dead Sea scrolls (the other two are Ben Sira and Tobit.) The portion of the epistle discovered at Qumran was written in Greek. This does not preclude the possibility of the text being based on a prior Hebrew or Aramaic text. However, the only text available to us has dozens of linguistic features available in Greek, but not in Hebrew, hence introductions of a Greek editor, not required for minimalist translation."}

In 1603 he became a priest and organist at the Cathedral of La Seo, Zaragossa. He looked after the organ at the cathedral and often had work done to improve it. He remained at the cathedral until his death on December 16, 1627.\nAll his compositions were for the church: both his organ music and vocal music. His organ works show that he learned from composers such as Antonio de Cabez\u00f3n, but he put new, modern ideas in his music which later influenced younger composers such as Correa de Arauxo. His students became the cathedral organists after his death, and were part of a tradition and style of paying which lasted for over 100 years.\nA very important new technique which he used was the use of a divided keyboard (medio registro) which allowed different sounds in the upper half and the lower half of the keyboard (on today's organs one would need a two-manual organ to get the same effect). He wrote 36 settings of the Magnificat, called \"Canticum Beatissimae Virginis Deiparae Mariae\" (1618). His vocal work shows a skilful use of polyphony."}

The cardinals meet to elect the next bishop of Rome, to become pope. This becomes necessary when the old pope dies or resigns. Usually, popes do not resign, though. The last pope to resign was Pope Benedict XVI. On 11 February 2013, the Vatican confirmed Pope Benedict would resign the papacy and on 13 March it announced the new and current pope as Pope Francis.\nThe word \"conclave\" is from Latin. It refers to the fact that the cardinals are locked up together, until they have agreed on a new pope. Today, this happens in the Sistine Chapel. \nOriginally, the conclave was started in Italian city states, in the 12th century. These cities needed to elect officeholders, and the election needed to be free of party politics. Events such as the Investiture Controversy in medieval Europe led to people wanting \"free\" elections, with a medieval understanding of free. Methods were often combined, the elements used were Acclamation, naming of candidates by predecessors, or by univolved people, and using \"electrors\" who would agree on the successor, behind closed doors. Earliest examples are that of Genua, in 1157, Pisa, in 1162-64, or Pistoia. \nPope Nicholas II published a papal bull called In Nomine Domini, in 1059, which introduced the conclave as the way to elect his successor.

Ghrelin is a hormone that makes people feel hungry. The opposite of hunger is called \"satiety\" or \"fullness\". Leptin causes this feeling. People can survive weeks without eating, but they will start to feel hungry after they have not eaten for a few hours. Hunger is generally considered quite uncomfortable. People who have eaten food usually will feel less hungry, or not hungry at all. People can live longer without food than without water.\nHunger is also used to refer to people who generally have little to eat, and are therefore often hungry. This can lead to starvation."}

The \"Artha\u015bh\u0101stra\" identifies its author by the name Kautilya, except for one verse which refers to him by the name Vishnugupta. One of the earliest Sanskrit literatures to explicitly identify Chanakya with Vishnugupta was Vishnu Sarma's \"Panchatantra\" in the 3rd century BC."}

He served as both National Security Advisor and later as Secretary of State in the Nixon Administration and the Ford Administration.\nEarly life.\nKissinger was born in Germany in 1923. As a German Jew, it was not safe for him to stay in Germany after Adolf Hitler came to power, and he left for the United States in 1933. He fought for the US against the Nazis in World War Two.\nNixon administration.\nKissinger was Richard Nixon's most trusted advisor on foreign affairs. He was in government during the Cold War and promoted what he called \"realpolitik\" in dealing with the Soviet Union and Communist China. He was a major force behind the 1973 ceasefire in the Vietnam War. He won a Nobel Peace Prize for the ceasefire, but the agreement fell apart in 1975. Under Kissinger, the US opened up relations to China, which is considered one of his biggest successes. He also supported d\u00e9tente, an easing of the rivalry with the Soviets.\nLater years.\nIn his later years, Kissinger \u2014 along with William Perry, Sam Nunn, and George Shultz \u2014 called upon governments to reduce nuclear weapons, and in three \"Wall Street Journal\" articles proposed a program of urgent steps to that end. The four have created the Nuclear Security Project to advance this cause.\nLegacy.\nHis legacy is often debated by historians. Some people criticize him, even calling him a criminal, for his tactics during the cold war, notably supporting a military junta in Chile and backing Pakistan during the Bangladesh War. Many people, however, consider Kissinger a great figure in modern American history who ended the Vietnam War, opened up China, and supported peace in the Cold War."}
