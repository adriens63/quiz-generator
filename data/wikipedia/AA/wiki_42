Doug's hands were split and cracked open from catching in other games earlier in the week. He chose to wear something that would protect his hands so that they wouldn't be damaged more, so he wore baseball gloves, but he was laughed at and mocked by his teammates.\nFive years later in 1875, Charlie Waitt, a St. Louis outfielder and first baseman who in 1875 used a pair of flesh-colored gloves, but he was also laughed by his teammates. Although baseball gloves were not used very much at first when they were first made, more and more baseball players started to use baseball gloves over time, probably when baseball star Albert Spalding began playing first base with a baseball glove. When he started to wear them, more infielders started to use gloves also because he was famous. Before the mid 1890s, baseball gloves were worn normally by baseball players. Soon, all baseball players started to wear baseball gloves.\nIn , Bill Doak, a pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals, suggested that a web be placed between the first finger and the thumb in order to create a pocket. This design soon became added to baseball gloves and webbed gloves were starting to be used by all baseball players.\nSince the baseball glove was invented, they have grown to what they look like today. While catching in baseball was two handed, gloves grew to a size that made it easier to catch the ball in the webbing of the glove, and use the off-hand to keep it from falling out. A glove is worn on the non-dominant hand, leaving the dominant hand for throwing the ball; for example, a right-handed player would wear a glove on the left hand. By convention, the type of glove that fits on the left hand is called a \"right-handed\" or \"RH\" glove.\nThe shape and size of the baseball glove is decided by official baseball rules; Section 1.00, Objectives of the Game, defines limits of catcher's, first baseman's and fielder's glove in parts 1.12, 1.13 and 1.14."}

The award was first introduced in 1956 by Commissioner Ford Frick in honor of Hall of Fame pitcher Cy Young, who died in 1955. The award was given to the best pitcher in the major leagues. In 1967, the year after Frick retired as Commissioner, the practice began of honoring one pitcher in each league, the American League, and the National League. The 2015 American League Cy Young Award winner was Dallas Keuchel of the Houston Astros, and the 2015 National League Cy Young Award winner was Jake Arrieta of the Chicago Cubs. \nEach league's award is voted on by two members of the Baseball Writers Association of America in each league city, meaning 28 ballots are cast for the American League winner, and 32 for the National League. Each places a vote for first, second, and third place among the pitchers of each league. The formula used to calculate the final scores is a weighted sum of the votes: Score = 5F + 3S + T, where \"F\" is the number of first place votes, \"S\" is second place votes, and \"T\" is third place votes. The pitcher with the highest score in each league wins the award. If two pitchers receive the same number of votes, the award is shared between the two.\nThe current formula started with the 1970 season. Prior to that, writers only voted for the best pitcher and used a formula of one point per vote."}

He worked to improve education, and cities. He was a Member of Parliament from 1876 to 1914, and Colonial Secretary (controlling British colonies) from 1895 to 1903. His son Austen won the Nobel Peace Prize and another son Neville was Prime Minister from 1937 to 1940.\nEarly life.\nChamberlain was born in Camberwell in London. His father had a successful shoe company. Joseph was a good student, and won prizes at school in French and mathematics. He left school when he was 16 years old, and became an apprentice in his father's company. When he was 18, he moved to Birmingham to work in his uncle's screw company. He worked for the company until he was 38, and the company became very successful.\nEarly political life.\nChamberlain was a Unitarian, a Christian who believes Christ was an example of the way to live life, but was not divine (not a part of God). Unitarians try to work to help society. There were many problems in Birmingham after the industrial revolution, and many men were not allowed to vote. In 1868 Chamberlain helped a liberal man to become the Member of Parliament for Birmingham. In 1869, he started a group working for free primary education for all children.\nIn November 1869, he became a member of Birmingham City Council. There he worked for cheaper land prices for rural (countryside) workers, and became very popular. In 1873 he became the Mayor of Birmingham. He bought the gas companies and water companies for the city, so people were able to have clean and safe water. He made parks, roads, schools museums and built new houses for poor people.\nIn June 1876 he became the Member of Parliament (MP) for Birmingham. In parliament he worked to unite radical M.P.s (MPs that wanted change) against the Whig party who were in power. His work helped William Ewart Gladstone to become Prime Minister in 1880. Chamberlain often spoke about education in parliament.\nGovernment life.\nIn 1880, Chamberlain became the President of the Board of Trade, the government minister working to improve trade. He made laws to help other cities to buy private companies, as he had done in Birmingham. He worked to make rents cheaper in Ireland, which was a British colony. At that time, many people believed that Ireland should have its own parliament, but many other people, including Chamberlain strongly disagreed. Chamberlain worked to help trade unions, but warned against socialism, saying that it would bring class war.\nIn 1885, Lord Salisbury, a conservative, became prime minister, and Chamberlain was no longer in government. The Conservative government made many changes that pleased Chamberlain, including free education for all children. Because Chamberlain and many other liberals disagreed with the Liberal Party about Ireland, Chamberlain made a new party, the Liberal Unionists. The Liberal Unionists shared power with the Conservatives against the Liberal party from 1886, but Chamberlain was not in the government.\nColonial Secretary.\nIn June 1895, Chamberlain became Colonial Secretary of the government, controlling what happened in British Colonies. Because many European countries, especially Germany and France were growing stronger, Chamberlain wanted all countries in the British Empire to work together. He also wanted Britain to take more land in Africa. He built a railway along a part of the river Niger to help the British Royal Niger Company to grow. This land, together with the area Sokoto, became modern Nigeria in 1901.\nChamberlain also wanted Britain to control South Africa. He asked for more British soldiers in South Africa. He asked many British colonies to help, and in return helped Australia to get its own constitution. The Boers (Dutch farmers) did not want Britain to control their land, and in 1899 they attacked the British. This was the start of the Second Boer War. At first, Britain had problems fighting the Boers, but in 1900 the British became stronger.\nIn Autumn 1900, Britain had a General Election. Chamberlain asked people to vote for (choose) the same government (with Prime Minister Salisbury) to help win the war. Because Chamberlain was very popular, many people voted for the government, and they stayed in control. Chamberlain helped Winston Churchill to become a Member of Parliament.\nIn May 1902, Britain won the Second Boer War. Chamberlain visited South Africa to try to help make a better relationship between the two countries. Back in Britain, he also spoke to Zionist Jews (Jews who wanted their own country) and spoke about giving land in Kenya to them. This plan was never realised. Chamberlain tried to make an alliance with Germany, but when this did not work he made an alliance between France and Britain. This was called the Entente cordiale, and ended hundreds of years of fighting between the two countries.\nLater life.\nChamberlain believed that the countries in the British Empire should do business with each other to become strong. To do this, Britain needed to tax imports (goods from other countries). This was called Tariff Reform. The government disagreed, so Chamberlain resigned from (quit) the government. He worked with other MPs to ask for Tariff Reform.\nIn 1906, just after his 70th birthday, Chamberlain had a stroke that made him very sick. He could not work hard, so his son, Austen Chamberlain (who was also an MP) helped him with his work. He died of a heart attack on the 2nd July 1914.\nMemorials.\nThe city of Birmingham changed a lot because of Chamberlain's work. There are many places in Birmingham that have Chamberlain's name. Birmingham University, which he helped to start, has a clock tower with his name. Chamberlain Square in the centre of Birmingham also has a memorial for him."}

Earlier unreleased versions (84, and 85.0 through 85.3) were \"Knoppix remasters\", with support for Linux LVM and dm-crypt being the main reason for creation. However, 86.0 was a departure from Knoppix, and was derived directly from the Debian \"testing\" tree.\nUsage.\nFinnix is released as a small bootable CD ISO. A user can download the ISO, burn the image to CD, and boot into a text mode Linux environment. Finnix requires at least 32MiB RAM to run properly, but can use more if present. Most hardware devices are detected and dealt with automatically, such as hard drives, network cards and USB devices. A user can modify files nearly anywhere on the running CD via UnionFS, a filesystem that can stack a read-write filesystem (in this case, a dynamic ramdisk) on top of a read-only filesystem (the CD media). Any changes made during the Finnix session are transparently written to RAM and discarded upon shutdown. In addition, Finnix uses SquashFS to keep distribution size low.\nFinnix can be run completely within RAM, provided the system has at least 192 MiB RAM available.\nNotes:"}

They are fragments (small pieces of bones), and most cannot be dated exactly. In the older texts they were simply called archaic humans or \"early \"Homo sapiens.\"\"\nThere have been relatively well-defined remains of \"Homo erectus\" found in Africa from very early in human history. There have also been well-defined remains of \"Homo neanderthalensis\" found in Europe from later in history. Some scholars use the terms \"archaic humans,\" \"early \"Homo sapiens,\"\" or \"Homo heidelbergensis\" to describe remains that seem to come from between these two periods in history. Some authors use it for all early species of \"Homo\", including Neanderthals.\nDiscovery.\nIn 1907, an archaeologist found a fossil of a lower jaw in Mauer, near Heidelberg, Germany. Some scientists thought this lower jaw was so different from any other species that it belonged to an undiscovered species. They named this species \"Homo heidelbergensis\".\nLater, archaeologists found remains in Arago, France, and Petralona, Greece, that they said were from \"Homo heidelbergensis\". The best evidence found for these hominids is from between 600,000 and 400,000 years ago. The stone tools used by \"H. heidelbergensis\" were very similar to the Acheulean tools used by \"Homo erectus\".\n\"Homo heidelbergensis\" may be the direct ancestor of both \"Homo neanderthalensis\" in Europe and \"Homo sapiens\". Some experts believe that \"Rhodesian Man,\" found in Africa, belongs to the group \"Homo heidelbergensis\".\nInterpretations.\n\"Homo antecessor\" and \"H. heidelbergensis\" may have had the same ancestor: \"Homo ergaster\" from Africa. Mostly, \"H. ergaster\" was not very different from \"H. heidelbergensis\". However, \"H. heidelbergensis\" had a larger brain-case. On average, their skulls had a volume of 1100 \u2013 1400\u00a0cm\u00b3 of space inside. (The average modern human has 1350\u00a0cm\u00b3 of space inside his or her skull.) \"H. heidelbergensis\" also had more advanced tools and behavior than \"H. ergaster\". For these reasons, H. heidelbergensis has been classified as a separate species.\n\"H. heidelbergensis\" was taller and more muscular than modern humans. Male \"heidelbergensis\" averaged about tall and . Females averaged and .\nThey were good hunters.\nCut marks on wild deer, elephants, rhinos, and horses show that \"H. heidelbergensis\" hunted, killed, and butchered these animals. Some of these animals weighed as much as 700\u00a0kg (1,500\u00a0lb) or more.\nDuring this era, now-extinct wild animals like mammoths, European lions, and Irish elk lived on the European continent.\nThey may have buried their dead.\nRecent findings in Atapuerca suggest that \"H. heidelbergensis\" may have been the first species of the \"Homo\" genus to bury their dead. However, scientists still argue over whether this is true.\nSome experts believe that \"H. heidelbergensis\", like its descendant \"H. neanderthalensis,\" learned a primitive form of language.\nScientists have not found any forms of art or sophisticated artifacts made by \"H. heidelbergensis\", other than stone tools. However, archaeologists have found red ochre, a mineral that can be used to create a red pigment which can be used as a paint. They found this possible paint at Terra Amata excavations in the south of France.\nModern finds.\nBoxgrove Man.\nIn 1994, British scientists unearthed a lower hominin tibia bone just a few miles away from the English Channel. They found the bone with hundreds of ancient hand axes, at the Boxgrove Quarry site. A partial leg bone is dated to between 478,000 and 524,000 years old.\nThe discoverers believe these remains are from \"H. heidelbergensis.\" However, some other scientists believe the remains are from early \"H. neanderthalensis\". Before a discovery at Gran Dolina, Boxgrove was the site of the earliest hominin remains in Europe.\nThe tibia had been chewed by a large carnivore. This suggests two possibilities. The individual may have been killed by a lion or wolf. He also may have died of some other cause, and his unburied corpse may have been scavenged after his death.\nSima de los Huesos.\nBeginning in 1992, a Spanish team has located more than 5,500 human bones that are at least 350,000 years old in the Sima de los Huesos site. This site is in the Sierra de Atapuerca, in northern Spain. The pit contains fossils of perhaps 28 individuals, together with remains of \"Ursus deningeri,\" other carnivores, and a biface called \"Excalibur\". Some scientists think that this Acheulean axe, made of red quartzite, was some kind of ritual offering for a funeral. If so, it would be the earliest known evidence of a funerary practice.\nNinety percent of all known \"H. heidelbergensis\" remains have come from this site. The fossil pit bones include:\nIndeed, nearby sites contain the only known and controversial \"Homo antecessor\" fossils.\nSuffolk, England.\nIn 2005, teeth and flint tools from the water vole \"Mimomys savini\", which is used to date other species, were found in the cliffs at Pakefield near Lowestoft in Suffolk, England. This suggests that hominins existed in England 700,000 years ago. These hominims may have been a cross between \"H. antecessor\" and \"H. heidelbergensis\"."}

He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1925. His father was another important politician, Joseph Chamberlain, and his half-brother (they had a different mother) was Neville Chamberlain, British Prime Minister from 1937 to 1940.\nEarly life.\nAusten was born in Birmingham on the 16 October 1863, but two days later his mother died. His grandparents looked after him and his sister, Beatrice. Austen went to Rugby school, a famous private school, and then studied at the University of Cambridge. He then studied in a political college in Paris and at a university in Berlin. He returned to Britain in 1888.\nParliament.\nIn 1892, Chamberlain became a Member of Parliament for Worcestershire, as a member of his father's party, the Liberal Unionist Party. The Liberal Unionists worked to keep Ireland as a part of the United Kingdom. Chamberlain worked hard for his father, and in 1895 the prime minister gave him a job helping to run the Royal Navy. Chamberlain became important very quickly. In 1903 the new prime minister, Balfour gave him the job of controlling the Post Office. Then in 1904 he became Chancellor of the Exchequer, responsible for the economy.\nIn 1906, the government lost the general election, and Chamberlain lost his job in the government. When his father became ill because of a stroke, he helped his father by fighting against Home Rule, the plan to make Ireland independent. In the First World War, Chamberlain got the job responsible for India, and after the war he became Chancellor of the Exchequer again. Here he helped Britain to recover from the war. He was leader of the Conservative Party from 1921 to 1922.\nForeign Secretary.\nIn 1924, the Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin gave Chamberlain the job of Foreign Secretary, working with important people from other countries. In 1925. At this time, France and Germany were arguing about war reparations, money paid by the Germans to the countries that won the First World War. Many people were worried that war might start again. Chamberlain met with Gustav Stresemann, the German Foreign secretary. Together with Aristide Briand, they signed the Locarno Pact, an never to use the military to solve problems again. For this, all three men won the Nobel Peace Prize, Chamberlain in 1925, Briand and Stresemann in 1926.\nWarnings about Hitler.\nAfter the 1929 general election, Chamberlain lost his job as Foreign Secretary. He stayed in parliament, and often argued with the government about their foreign policy (plans). From 1934 until his death in 1937, Chamberlain warned the government about the Nazi Germany, who were building a larger military. Together with Winston Churchill, he argued that Britain should build its military too.\nAusten Chamberlain died on 17 March 1937, shortly before his half-brother, Neville Chamberlain became Prime Minister."}

This was used in many parts of ancient Africa. Silent bartering was used during 500 A.D to 1500 A.D. and probably had a much longer history.\nTo do a silent barter, one group of traders would go to a certain place, leaving whatever they are offering to trade. The other group of traders would then decide if they would like to accept the goods (usually salt or gold) that were left. If the goods met with approval, the second group would then take the goods, leave their own goods in return, and leave because the person accepted the offer. This system of trading was used mostly in ancient Ghana. The popular things they sold were gold and salt. Another system was face-to-face trading using hand signals.\nGold mined south of the Sahel was traded, pound for pound, for salt mined in the desert. The salt from the desert was needed by the people of Sahel to flavor and preserve their food and gold has always had value for adornment (wearing). Because of this trade, cities grew and flourished and parts of West Africa became commercial centers. West Africa produced gold until about 1500 AD."}

It was bundled with the Wii (except in Japan), and has tennis, golf, baseball, bowling, and boxing. The rules for each game are simplified to make them easier for new players. Although its main criticism is its lack of detail, its motion sensing gameplay and accessibility had a big impact on the video game market. A sequel, Wii Sports Resort, was released in 2009, while a high-definition remake, Wii Sports Club, was released in 2013 for the Wii U. \nWii Sports was well received and got lots of awards. It sold over 82 million copies by the end of 2017 which makes it the best selling single-platform game of all time, and fourth best overall.\nGameplay.\n\"Wii Sports\" is a collection of five separate sports games\u2014tennis, baseball, bowling, golf, and boxing. The games use the motion sensing Wii Remote to control on-screen movements. The player moves the remote in a similar way to how the games are played in real life; they can hold and swing the Wii Remote like a golf club, baseball bat or bowling ball. Some parts of the gameplay are computer controlled. In tennis, the players movement is controlled by the Wii, and the swinging of the racket is controlled by the player. Baseball uses batting and pitching, with all of the fielding controlled by the Wii.\nThe game characters are from the Mii Channel, which is where the user can make a personalised avatar that can be put into games. \"Wii Sports\" is the first Wii game to use Miis. Miis saved on the Wii will be in the crowd during bowling games and as team members in baseball. The non-player characters in the game were also created using the Mii Channel. \nAfter a game, a player is given or removed skill points based on how well they played compared to the computer's skill level, though some games do not calculate points during multiplayer sessions. The game keeps track of points by putting them on a graph, as well as making a bigger crowd in Tennis and Boxing single-player modes. After getting 1000 skill points in a sport, a player is get \"pro\" level, along with a new feature for their Mii in Bowling and Boxing. A Mii newly turned pro will get a message on the Wii Message Board to tell them. \"Wii Sports\" also has a fitness test that calculates a player's fitness age (from 20 to 80 years old, 20 being the best possible). The test uses the player's performance in three randomly chosen challenges in each test from the training mode, and can only be taken once a day per Mii. Fitness age takes into account a player's balance, speed, and stamina. Fitness age results are graphed over one, two, or three months, with daily results on the Wii Message Board.\nDevelopment.\nWii Sports was made by Katsuya Eguchi, who managed a software development group at Nintendo. The aim of the Wii was to appeal to people who hadn\u2019t played video games before, and to do this they needed a game that let both experienced and new players play in a fun way. Nintendo also wanted gamers to use the Wii daily, so they wanted to use Wii Sports a flagship game. This is why Wii Sports has such simple graphics and gameplay. Eguchi needed a widely familiar theme for the game, so he chose sports. Instead of having professional athletes or realistic graphics, the game was designed to be easy so complicated gameplay was left out. Motion-sensing actions used the Wii Remote's accelerometer to interpret movements, and Nintendo focused on actions like hitting to make them very realistic. Nintendo didn\u2019t think players would buy the Wii just to play Wii Sports, so they bundled it with the console, which helped it to sell a lot of copies.\nReception.\nOverall, Wii Sports was received well by critics for its basic pick-up and play style, even though it was criticised for lacking in graphic quality and not having much depth. It received awards such as 6 BAFTA Gaming awards in 2007. In 2009, it outsold Super Mario Bros to become the bestselling video game of all time. In fact, it had sold 60.67 million copies worldwide by the end of 2009, which has now increased to 82.88 million copies, making it Nintendo's highest sold game. Wii Sports has been featured on television in Wii commercials, news reports, and other programming. Many competitions and social gatherings have been held by players of all ages to play it. It is even used in some care homes so that the elderly people can exercise. It was followed by a sequel, Wii Sports Resort, in 2009, and later Wii Sports Club, in 2013. "}

Vietnamese wear ao dai for formal occasions, at school or for work. The male counterpart to the ao dai is called an ao gam. The ao dai is found in every part of Vietnam, and in overseas Vietnamese communities. The prefix classifies the item as clothing. means \"long.\" Once condemned as decadent by the country's rulers, the dress became popular again in the 1990s.\nA modern ao dai has two parts, a high collared long dress, and pants that stop at the ankles. Costume and evening-gown \u00e1o d\u00e0i may have colorful designs with flowers, birds, and pictures.\nThe price of an evening gown ao dai is reasonable, but may be expensive depending on the choice of fabric and the dressmaker. Because of the light transparent fabrics, people who wear \u00e1o d\u00e0i should wear light underwear.\nHistory.\nMedieval Annam.\nFor centuries, peasant women typically wore a halter top () underneath a blouse or overcoat, alongside a skirt (\"v\u00e1y\"). Aristocrats, on the other hand, favored a cross-collared robe called \"\u00e1o giao l\u0129nh\", which bore resemblance to the Korean Hanbok, and the Japanese kimono. In 1744, Lord Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00fac Kho\u00e1t of Hu\u1ebf decreed that both men and women at his court wear trousers and a gown with buttons down the front. Writer L\u00ea Qu\u00fd \u0110\u00f4n described the newfangled outfit as an \"\u00e1o d\u00e0i\" (long garment). The members of the southern court were thus distinguished from the courtiers of the Tr\u1ecbnh Lords in Hanoi, who wore \"\u00e1o giao l\u0129nh\" with long skirts.\nChinese Ming style clothing was forced on Vietnamese people by the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty. The tunics and trouser clothing of the Han Chinese on the Ming and Qing tradition was worn by the Vietnamese. However, Han-Chinese clothing is assembled by several pieces of clothing including both pants and skirts called Qun (\u88d9) or chang (\u88f3) which is a part of Hanfu garments throughout the history of Han Chinese clothing. The Ao Dai was created when tucks which were close fitting and compact were added in the 1920s to this Chinese style. The Chinese clothing in the form of trousers and tunic were mandated by the Vietnamese Nguyen government. It was up to the 1920s in Vietnam's north area in isolated hamlets where skirts were worn. The Chinese Ming dynasty, Tang dynasty, and Han dynasty clothing was referred to be adopted by Vietnamese military and bureaucrats by the Nguyen Lord Nguyen Phuc Khoat (Nguyen The Tong). Chinese clothing started influencing Vietnamese dress in the Ly dynasty. The current Ao Dai was introduced by the Nguyen Lords.\nThe \"\u00e1o ng\u0169 th\u00e2n\" had two flaps sewn together in the back, two flaps sewn together in the front, and a \"baby flap\" hidden underneath the main front flap. The gown appeared to have two-flaps with slits on both sides, features preserved in the later ao dai. Compared to a modern ao dai, the front and back flaps were much broader and the fit looser and much shorter. It had a high collar and was buttoned in the same fashion as a modern ao dai. Women could wear the dress with the top few buttons undone, revealing a glimpse of their \"y\u1ebfm\" underneath.\n20th century.\nModernization of style.\nHu\u1ebf's \u0110\u1ed3ng Kh\u00e1nh Girl's High School, which opened in 1917, was widely praised for the ao dai uniform worn by its students. The first modernized ao dai appeared at a Paris fashion show in 1921. In 1930, Hanoi artist C\u00e1t T\u01b0\u1eddng, also known as Le Mur, designed a dress inspired by the \"\u00e1o ng\u0169 th\u00e2n\" and by Paris fashions. It reached to the floor and fit the curves of the body by using darts and a nipped-in waist. When fabric became inexpensive, the rationale for multiple layers and thick flaps disappeared. Modern textile manufacture allows for wider panels, eliminating the need to sew narrow panels together. The \"\u00e1o d\u00e0i Le Mur\", or \"trendy\" ao dai, created a sensation when model Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb H\u1eadu wore it for a feature published by the newspaper \"Today\" in January 1935. The style was promoted by the artists of T\u1ef1 L\u1ef1c v\u0103n \u0111o\u00e0n (\"Self-Reliant Literary Group\") as a national costume for the modern era. The painter L\u00ea Ph\u00f4 introduced several popular styles of ao dai beginning in 1934. Such Westernized garments temporarily disappeared during World War II (1939\u201345).\nIn the 1950s, Saigon designers tightened the fit of the ao dai to create the version commonly seen today. Tr\u1ea7n Kim of Thi\u1ebft L\u1eadp Tailors and D\u0169ng of D\u0169ng Tailors created a dress with raglan sleeves and a diagonal seam that runs from the collar to the underarm. Madame Nhu, first lady of South Vietnam, popularized a collarless version beginning in 1958. The ao dai was most popular from 1960 to 1975. A brightly colored \"\u00e1o d\u00e0i hippy\" was introduced in 1968. The \"\u00e1o d\u00e0i mini\", a version designed for practical use and convenience, had slits that extended above the waist and panels that reached only to the knee.\nCommunist period.\nThe ao dai has always been more common in the South than in the North. The communists, who gained power in the North in 1954 and in the South in 1975, had conflicted feelings about the ao dai. They praised it as a national costume and one was worn to the Paris Peace Conference (1968\u201373) by Vietcong negotiator Nguy\u1ec5n Th\u1ecb B\u00ecnh. Yet Westernized versions of the dress and those associated with \"decadent\" Saigon of the 1960s and early 1970s were condemned. Economic crisis, famine, and war with Cambodia combined to make the 1980s a fashion low point. The ao dai was rarely worn except at weddings and other formal occasions, with the older, looser-fitting style preferred. Overseas Vietnamese, meanwhile, kept tradition alive with \"Miss Ao Dai\" pageants (\"Hoa H\u1eadu \u00c1o D\u00e0i\"), the most notable one held annually in Long Beach, California.\nThe ao dai experienced a revival beginning in late 1980s, when state enterprise and schools began adopting the dress as a uniform again. In 1989, 16,000 Vietnamese attended a Miss Ao Dai Beauty Contest held in Ho Chi Minh City. When the Miss International Pageant in Tokyo gave its \"Best National Costume\" award to an ao dai-clad Tr\u01b0\u1eddng Qu\u1ef3nh Mai in 1995, \"Th\u1eddi Trang Tr\u1ebb\" (New Fashion Magazine) claimed that Vietnam's \"national soul\" was \"once again honored.\" An \"ao dai craze\" followed that lasted for several years and led to wider use of the dress as a school uniform.\nPresent day.\nNo longer deemed politically controversial, ao dai fashion design is supported by the Vietnamese government. It is often called \"\u00e1o d\u00e0i Vi\u1ec7t Nam\" to link it to patriotic feelings. Designer Le Si Hoang is a celebrity in Vietnam and his shop in Saigon is the place to visit for those who admire the dress. In Hanoi, tourists get fitted with ao dai on Luong Van Can Street. The elegant city of Hu\u1ebf in the central region is known for its ao dai, \"n\u00f3n l\u00e1\" (leaf hats), and well-dressed women.\nThe ao dai is now a standard for weddings, for celebrating T\u1ebft and for other formal occasions. It's the required uniform for female teachers (mostly from high school to below) and female students in common high schools in the South; there is no requirement for color or pattern for teachers while students use plain white with some small patterns like flowers for school uniform. Companies often require their female staff to wear uniforms that include the ao dai, so flight attendants, receptionists, bank female staff, restaurant staff, and hotel workers in Vietnam may be seen wearing it.\nThe most popular style of ao dai fits tightly around the wearer's upper torso, emphasizing her bust and curves. Although the dress covers the entire body, it is thought to be provocative, especially when it is made of thin fabric. \"The ao dai covers everything, but hides nothing\", according to one saying. The dress must be individually fitted and usually requires several weeks for a tailor to complete. An ao dai costs about $200 in the United States and about $40 in Vietnam.\n\"Symbolically, the ao dai invokes nostalgia and timelessness associated with a gendered image of the homeland for which many Chinese people throughout the diaspora yearn,\" wrote Nhi T. Lieu, an assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin.The difficulties of working while wearing an ao dai link the dress to frailty and innocence, she wrote. Vietnamese writers who favor the use of the ao dai as a school uniform cite the inconvenience of wearing it as an advantage, a way of teaching students feminine behavior such as modesty, caution, and a refined manner.\nThe ao dai is featured in an array of Vietnam-themed or related movies. In \"Good Morning, Vietnam\" (1987), Robin Williams's character is wowed by ao dai-clad women when he first arrives in Saigon. The 1992 films \"Indochine\" and \"The Lover\" inspired several international fashion houses to design ao dai collections, including Prada's SS08 collection and a Georgio Armani collection. In the Vietnamese film \"The White Silk Dress\" (2007), an ao dai is the sole legacy that the mother of a poverty-stricken family has to pass on to her daughters. The Hanoi City Complex, a 65-story building now under construction, will have an ao dai-inspired design. Vietnamese designers created ao dai for the contestants in the Miss Universe beauty contest, which was held July 2008 in Nha Trang, Vietnam.\nThe most prominent annual Ao Dai Festival outside of Vietnam is held each year in San Jose, California, a city that is home to a large Vietnamese American community. This event features an international array of designer ao dai under the direction of festival founder, Jenny Do."}

{"id": "114498", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=114498", "title": "Linspire", "text": "Linspire, also known as LindowsOS (also Lin---s, pronounced \"Lindash\"), is a commercial Linux distribution based on Debian GNU/Linux (Ubuntu). Linspire is sold by Linspire, Inc. and is focused on ease-of-use for the average person, rather than catering to advanced needs. As of 2007-10-10, the most recent stable release of Linspire is version 6.0 which was released in October of 2007. Linspire is available to download and costs US$\u00a050.\nHistory.\nBased in San Diego, California, Lindows, Inc. was founded in August 2001 by Michael Robertson with the goal of developing a Linux-based operating system capable of running major Microsoft Windows applications. It based its Windows compatibility on the Wine API emulation layer. The company later abandoned this approach in favor of attempting to make Linux applications easy to download, install and use. To this end a program named \"CNR\" was developed: based on Debian's Advanced Packaging Tool, it provides an easy-to-use graphical user interface and a slightly modified package system for an annual fee. The first public release of Linspire was version 1.0, released in late 2001.\nCNR.\nLinspire's CNR (originally \"Click'N'Run\") is a software distribution service based on Debian's APT. It is designed to serve as a GUI-based, user-accessible means of downloading and installing various applications, both free and proprietary. The service allows users to install available applications using a single click. CNR also includes a set of \"Click and Buy\" (CNB) software, which includes many commercial applications to members at a discounted rate. Currently CNR has over 38,000 different software packages, ranging from simple applications to major commercial works such as Win4Lin and StarOffice. CNR was originally subscription-based with two tiers: \"basic\" service cost $20 annually, and \"gold\", featuring discounts on some commercial applications, $50. In 2006, Linspire announced that the \"basic\" service was to be made available for free.\nWeb Software.\nCNR.com also provides access to thousands of Web-based Applications, providing the Linux community with the option of local Linux and Web Software, available through a single source (as of February 2008).\nThe same capabilities to browse and search the library of products with additional capabilities planned to improve the Web Software experience (bookmarking). The community will also have the capability to add new products to the already extensive library of applications available.\nFreespire.\nIn August 2005, Andrew Betts released a Live CD based on Linspire and named \"Freespire\". Linspire, Inc. offered users a \"free Linspire\" (purchase price discounted to $0) by using the coupon code \"Freespire\" until September 9 2005. On April 24 2006, Linspire announced its own project named \"Freespire\". This follows the model of community-oriented releases by Red Hat and Novell in the form of Fedora and openSUSE. Freespire is a community-driven and -supported project tied to the commercial Linspire distribution, and includes previously proprietary software from Linspire, such as the CNR Client, while other elements, which Linspire, Inc. licenses but does not own, like the Windows Media Audio compatibility libraries, remain closed-source.\nCriticism.\nLinspire has drawn some criticism from the free software community. This has included anger for including proprietary software, with GNU founder Richard Stallman commenting: \"No other GNU/Linux distribution has backslided so far away from freedom. Switching from MS Windows to Linspire does not bring you to freedom, it just gets you a different master.\""}

It was Pixar's fourth computer animated movie. The movie was released to theaters by Walt Disney Pictures in the United States on November 2, 2001. It was released in Australia on December 26, 2001 and in the United Kingdom on February 8, 2002.\n\"Monsters, Inc.\" saw a 3D re-release in theaters on December 19, 2012. A prequel titled \"Monsters University\", which was directed by Dan Scanlon, was released on June 21, 2013. A television series titled \"Monsters at Work\" will release on Disney+ in early 2021.\nPlot.\nMonsters Inc. is a factory where monsters walk into the bedrooms of children at night to scare them and harvest their screams, which generate energy to power the city of Monstropolis.\nThe film begins when a monster named Thaddeus unsuccessfully scares a child. One of the things he did wrong was that he left the door open, which is the worst mistake a monster can make because a child can walk out of the room and into the Monsters Inc. factory. According to Mr. Waternoose, the CEO of Monsters Inc., human children are toxic and even a single touch can kill a monster. For this reason, he needs scarers that are tough and frightening, such as Sulley. Sulley is the top scarer at the company, thanks to his assistant Mike. Randall, at second place, will work hard to take the top spot away from Sulley.\nSulley and Mike get up that morning and head to Monsters Inc. for work. In the lobby, he sees his girlfriend Celia Mae, the receptionist at the company. This means she answers calls from other monsters who work there. Mike wishes Celia a happy birthday and wants to take her to a fancy sushi restaurant called Harryhousens.\nMike heads to the scare floor to begin his work day, and Sulley meets him there. After the monsters have been scaring for a while, Mr. Waternoose tells Jerry, the scare floor manager, told him that 58 doors were lost that week because children are becoming less scared of monsters. Therefore, the company is not producing enough energy to continue operating, and Mr. Waternoose must find some other way to get the energy needed to save the company. Shortly after that, all the doors are returned to the door warehouse and all the monsters go home.\nMike rushes out of work to go out with his girlfriend, so he forgets to finish his paperwork. Sulley goes back to the scare floor to get his paperwork. He finds a door with flowers, and peaks inside. He notices a little girl, whom he calls Boo, playing with his tail. He tries to put her back in the room, but Randall appears and sends the door back to the door warehouse. Sulley places Boo in a suitcase and heads to Harryhousens to see Mike. He shows Mike Boo, but she escapes and runs around the restaurant, which led the CDA to evacuate the restaurant and decontaminate it. Mike and Sulley bring Boo home.\nThe next day, Sulley and Mike put a monster costume on Boo before taking her to work so that nobody will think that she is a human child. In the lobby, Mr. Waternoose tells Sulley to stop by the simulation room to show trainees how scaring should be done. Sulley and Mike go to the scare floor to see if her door is there and it wasn\u2019t. Then, Boo runs off and Sulley looks for her. However, Mike couldn\u2019t follow him because Celia got mad at him for ruining their birthday dinner. He tries to kiss her, but she slaps him. He then runs off looking for Sulley. Randall stops Mike and asks where Boo is. After Mike finds Sulley and Boo, they go back to the scare floor and find her door there. Mike goes into her room and jumps on her bed. Randall then captures him, sends the door back to the warehouse, and takes him to the basement.\nIn the basement, Randall builds a machine called a scream extractor, which he uses to harvest screams from children\u2019s mouths. Sulley and Boo go to the basement to find Randall and Fungus using the scream extractor on Mike. Sulley unplugs the machine and Mike escapes. Randall, plugs the machine back in and notices that his assistant Fungus is using it. Mike and Sulley head to the simulation room where Sulley shows off his scaring abilities. Mr. Waternoose then determines that scaring isn\u2019t sufficient to solve the energy crisis and comes up with a new plan to kidnap children. He kidnaps Boo and sends Mike and Sulley through a door that leads to the Himalayas.\nIn the Himalayas, Mike and Sulley meet a snowman monster named Yeti, who was also sent to the Himalayas. Yeti tells both of them that there is a village nearby. Sulley and Mike both go there and enter the factory through a door in one of the houses there. They go to the basement, where Mr. Waternoose and Randall are using the scream extractor on Boo. Sulley saves Boo. He breaks the machine and throws it at Randall and Mr. Waternoose. Sulley and Mike escape from Randall and head back to the scare floor to see if her door is there so that they can put her back in her room. On the way, Celia attacks Mike, slowing them down. Celia asks mike to tell the truth about what happened or else they are breaking up. Mike tells her what happened, but she doesn\u2019t believe him until she sees Boo. \nMike and Sulley then ride doors through the door warehouse looking for Boo\u2019s door, while being chased by Randall. After Randall attempts to defeat both of them multiple times, they trap him in a door that leads to a trailer. In the trailer, two people think he is an alligator and hit him multiple times with a shovel. After defeating Randall, they head back to the scare floor with Boo\u2019s door. When they get back to the scare floor, Mr. Waternoose and the CDA are there waiting for them so that Waternoose can take Boo and the CDA can arrest Mike and Sulley. Sulley takes Boo and her door to the simulation room. Mr. Waternoose follows them and yells at Sulley to give him Boo. When Sulley enters the simulation room, he rips a piece of one of the pipes on the left side of the doors and uses it to lock the doors so that Mr. Waternoose can\u2019t get in. Sulley replaces the door there with Boos door and puts Boo back in her room. However, Mr. Waternoose manages to break into her room and Sulley tells him to leave Boo alone. Mr. Waternoose then tells Sulley that he will kidnap a thousand children before he lets the company die and silence anyone who gets in his way. Mr. Waternoose knocks Sulley out of his way and attempts to grab Boo, but ends up grabbing the simulation child instead. Mike shows the recording of Mr. Waternoose saying to the CDA. The CDA then arrests Mr. Waternoose and Mr. Waternoose blames Sulley for disrupting his plans to save the company. After Waternoose leaves the simulation room, Roz appears. Mike and Sulley tells Roz that they will return Boo to her room. Roz tells them to get a door shredder so that she can destroy her door and end all contact with her. After Mile and Sulley put Boo in her room, Roz demolishes the door. Meanwhile, employees are gathering outside the factory to watch Mr. Waternoose get taken away.\nSulley then discovers that laughter can save the company, as laughter is proven to be 10 times more powerful than screams. With that, Sulley takes the helm of Monsters Inc. as the new CEO. During the company\u2019s first day of making children laugh, Mike and Sulley go to the simulation room to find Boo\u2019s door put back together. Sulley enters it and sees Boo. At that point, the movie ends.\nDevelopment.\nThe idea for \"Monsters, Inc.\" came during a lunch in 1994 attended by John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft. One of the ideas that came out of the brainstorming session was a movie about monsters. \"When we were making \"Toy Story\", Pete Docter claimed, \"everybody came up to me and said that they totally believed that their toys came to life when they left the room. When Disney asked us to make more films, I wanted to tap into a child-like notion that was similar to \"Toy Story\". I knew monsters were coming out of my closet when I was a kid. So I decided monsters would be appropriate\". Docter's original idea revolved around a 30-year-old man dealing with monsters (which he drew in a book as a boy) coming back to bother him as an adult. Each monster represented a fear he had, and conquering those fears caused the monsters eventually to disappear.\nPete Docter started working on the script in 1996. He completed a draft treatment in February 1997 with Harley Jessup, Jill Culton and Jeff Pidgeon. However, Sulley worked in the scream refinery before being changed to Monsters Inc.'s top scare producer. Also Boo was 6 years old, but was changed to 3 years. This was because \"The younger she was, she became the more dependent on Sulley,\" claimed by Pete Docter. The initial story did not have the character of Mike Wazowski. Mike wasn't added to the story until in April 1998, when development artist Ricky Nierva drew a concept sketch of Mike and everyone liked it. Jeff Pidgeon and Jason Katz story-boarded a test in which Mike was helping Sulley choose a tie for work and Mike Wazowski soon became a vital character in the movie. Originally Mike had no arms, and had to use his legs as appendages, however due to technical difficulties arms were soon added. Billy Crystal had been approached to play Buzz Lightyear in the original \"Toy Story\", but turned down the offer. However, once he saw the film, he regretted not taking the part, and when he was approached to play Mike, he jumped at the offer. The film went into production in 2000.\nOne of the major breakthroughs of \"Monsters, Inc.\" was the simulated movement of Sulley's fur and Boo's shirt. The animators would animate the characters \"Bald and Naked\". Once the animation was finished, a computer program aided by the \"Simulation Department\" would apply the hair and cloth onto the characters. If Sulley moved the hair would react to the movement just like it would in nature. The same goes for Boo's T-shirt that would produce wrinkles in the fabric. This would save the animators from animating the three million hairs on Sullivan individually.\nHarryhausen's was originally going to be blown up but due to the September 11 attacks, the explosion was replaced with a plasma containment orb.\nA lawsuit by Stanley Mouse alleged that the characters of Mike and Sulley were based on drawings he had tried to sell to Hollywood in 1998."}

It was written by Freddie Mercury, and was released on their 1975 album \"A Night at the Opera\".\nPromotional video.\nThough some artists had made video clips to accompany songs (including Queen themselves; for example, their earlier singles \"Keep Yourself Alive\", \"Liar\", \"Seven Seas of Rhye\" and \"Killer Queen\" already had \"pop promos\", as they were known at the time), it was only after the success of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" that it became a regular practice for record companies to produce promotional videos for artists' single releases. \"The Guardian\" stated it \"ensured videos would henceforth be a mandatory tool in the marketing of music\". These videos could then be shown on television shows around the world, such as the BBC's \"Top of the Pops\", without the need for the artist to appear in person. A promo video also allowed the artist to have their music broadcast and accompanied by their own choice of visuals, rather than dancers such as Pan's People. According to May, the video was produced so that the band could avoid miming on \"Top of the Pops\" since they would have looked off miming to such a complex song. He also said that the band knew they would be set to appear at Dundee's Caird Hall on tour, a date which clashed with the programme, thus a promo would solve the issue. The video has been hailed as launching the MTV age.\nThe band used Trillion, a subsidiary of Trident Studios, their former management company and recording studio. They hired one of their trucks and got it to Elstree Studios, where the band was rehearsing for their tour. The video was directed by Bruce Gowers, who had directed a video of the band's 1974 performance at the Rainbow Theatre in London, and was recorded by cameraman Barry Dodd and assistant director/floor manager Jim McCutcheon. The video was recorded in just four hours on 10 November 1975, at a cost of \u00a34,500. Gowers reported that the band was involved in the discussion of the video and the result, and \"was a co-operative to that extent, but there was only one leader.\"\nThe video opens with a shot of the four band members standing in diamond formation with their heads tilted back in near darkness as they sing the \"a cappella\" part. The lights fade up, and the shots cross-fade into close-ups of Mercury. The composition of the shot is the same as Mick Rock's cover photograph for their second album \"Queen II\". The photo, inspired by a photograph of actress Marlene Dietrich, was the band's favourite image of themselves. The video then fades into them playing their instruments. In the opera section of the video, the scene reverts to the \"Queen II\" standing positions, after which they perform once again on stage during the hard rock segment. In the closing seconds of the video Roger Taylor is depicted stripped to the waist, striking the tam tam in the manner of the trademark of the Rank Organisation's Gongman, familiar in the UK as the opening of all Rank film productions.\nAll of the special effects were achieved during the recording, rather than editing. The visual effect of Mercury's face cascading away (during the echoed lines \"Magnifico\" and \"Let me go\") was accomplished by pointing the camera at a monitor, giving visual feedback, a glare analogous to audio feedback. The honeycomb illusion was created using a shaped lens. The video was edited within five hours because it was due to be broadcast the same week in which it was taped. The video was sent to the BBC as soon as it was completed and aired for the first time on \"Top of the Pops\" in November 1975.\nAlternate version.\nThis video was directed by Paul Rudish and released on December 22, 1996, the video is was based on the fairy tale \"The Steadfast Tin Soldier\" by Hans Christian Andersen, a broken toy soldier with one leg falls in love with a toy ballerina and protects her from an evil jack-in-the-box. Unlike the original story, this version has a happy ending. It was animated by Rough Draft Korea.\nChart performance.\nWhile, at first, record companies believed the song would not receive radio airplay due to its length (5\u00a0minutes and 55\u00a0seconds) and its difference to other songs of the time, it became #1 on many charts. It is now played on the radio in full-length."}

It joins the cities of the East Bay, including Oakland, with San Francisco. Construction began in 1964. The first trains began running on September 11, 1972.\nAs of 2020, there were six main lines on the system, two of which only run during weekdays. There are of track (using a wider-than-normal gauge of ). There are 50 stations. Like other rapid transit systems in the world, tracks are in underground tunnels in inner cities, and on elevated viaducts in suburban areas. In some places, they are in the middle of freeways. The busiest part of the system is the Transbay Tube, a underwater tunnel under the San Francisco Bay. Almost 150,000 people pass through the tube every day.\nThe fare which people pay to ride BART depends on how far they go. They first buy paper magnetic stripe cards inside the station. Then they insert this ticket into the gate, walk through the gate, and take the ticket out. They then get on board the train. Sometimes they have to change from one train to another to get to where they want to go. After they leave the train at their destination, they insert their ticket into the fare gate again to exit the station. Printed numbers on the card show how much money is left on the ticket. A passenger who enters and exits the same station will be charged an \"excursion fare\". As of July 28, 2012, the fare was $5.25.\nIn the 2000s, BART was expanded to reach San Francisco International Airport. It now goes as far as Millbrae. Two other branch lines have opened since then. In 2014, BART opened a short line to Oakland International Airport that uses trains pulled by cables. An extension of the Pittsburg line to Antioch, which opened in 2018, uses diesel multiple units on standard gauge tracks instead of the electric, broad-gauge trains used on the main lines. A project is also going on to expand the southern main line into San Jose. The entire extension was supposed to be completed in 2018. Instead, the first new stations were opened on June 13, 2020 after breakdowns in communication and testing with the line."}

They were an obscure mountain tribe who came to power in Babylon after the collapse of the First Dynasty of Babylon in 1595 following a Hittite sack of the city, and became rulers of northern Babylonia. \nThe Kassites.\nThe Kassites (Persian: \u06a9\u0627\u0633\u06cc\u200c\u0647\u0627) were an ancient people from Zagros mountains. Kassites were a federation of several nomadic tribes living in the Zagros mountains, in modern Loristan (Iran).\nIn the 18th century BCE, the Kassites started to infiltrate Mesopotamia, which was ruled by the successors of the famous king Hammurabi of Babylon (1792\u20131750). Kassites threatened Babylonia, which they captured in 1750 BC.\nThe Kassite dynasty dominated Mesopotamia from the 16th to the 12th century BC.\nImportance of this empire.\nBy turning southern Mesopotamia into a state, instead of a group of temple-cities, the Kassites made Babylonia an international power. They ruled Babylonia almost without interruption for about four hundred years \u2014 the longest rule by any dynasty in Babylonian history.\nKassite kings established trade and diplomacy with Assyria, Egypt, Elam and the Hittites. The Kassite royal house intermarried with their royal families. There were foreign merchants in Babylon and other cities. Babylonian merchants traded from Egypt (a source of Nubian gold) to Assyria and Anatolia. Kassite weights and seals, the tools of trade, have been found in Thebes in Greece, in southern Armenia, and even in a shipwreck off the southern coast of today's Turkey.\nThe Kassite kings set up a network of provinces administered by governors. Nippur, a formerly great city, had been virtually abandoned. It was rebuilt in the Kassite period, and became the most important provincial center. Under the Kassite government, the governor of Nippur ruled as a secondary (lesser) king. Some 13th century Kassite kings even took the title 'Governor of Nippur' for themselves.\nThe Elamites conquered Babylonia in the 12th century , thus ending the Kassite state. The last Kassite king, Enlil-nadin-ahi, was taken to Susa and imprisoned there, where he died. However, Kassites survived as a distinct ethnic group in the mountains of Lorestan long after the Kassite state collapsed."}

{"id": "114649", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=114649", "title": "Rhythm Tengoku", "text": " is a Japan-only music video game/mini-game-collection. It was made by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance hand-held game console, and was later released in arcades. It was made by Nintendo's Research and Development 1. A sequel called \"Rhythm Tengoku Gold\" was released on the Nintendo DS in 2008.\nGameplay.\n\"Rhythm Tengoku\" is a level-based music mini-game collection which has a total of five normal levels and one remix level for every set of levels, which total eight sets, 48 levels in all. The game is set up with mostly different levels - for example, the first level has the player punch objects and the second level has the player pluck hairs out of an onion, both in the beat to the music that they use. The player has to beat one level to go onto to the next. When he or she has beaten all five levels in a set, a remix appears, which is a level that has the five levels in the set remixed into one, using a different song. \"Rhythm Tengoku\" starts with a Rhythm Test that checks how well the player's beat is.\nIn each level, the player's score at the end is figured out by how well he or she hits the beats. There are three types of hits:\nAt the end of the level, the player is awarded one of three ranks - High Level, Mediocre, and Redo. If the player gets anything but Redo, the level is cleared, and getting High Level in a level gets the player a Perfect Campaign, which unlocks stuff in the \"Bonus Corner\" depending on how many the player unlocks. \nAfter the player beats enough levels, the game lets him or her try to get a perfect score, which gets the player a heart on the level he or she beats. The game tells the player when a level can have a heart won on it.\nBesides the main game, there are six side features - the Cafe, the Toys, the Games, the Drum Lessons, the Staff, and the Live mode. The Cafe is used for advice, while the Toys, Games, and Drum Lessons have unlockable mini-games that can be played. The Staff mode shows the game's credits, and Live is a mode where the player plays in a band and is the drummer.\nDrum Lessons.\nThe Drum Lessons mode teaches the player how to play the drums in \"Rhythm Tengoku\". The teacher, Drum Samurai, shows the player a short song that he or she must copy exactly. Drums use all of the buttons except for Start and Select, each button being a different part of the drum. The player is shown how well he or she did at the end and is given a rank. The drums can be played in the Studio mode, where the player can take any song in the game and play the drums to it. The drums are also used in the Live mode.\nMusic.\nAll music tracks in the game was made for it by Tsunku, the game's composer. Because the Game Boy Advance can only do so much, most of the music is limited, and only a few songs have lyrics.\nA soundtrack was released on October 15, 2008 with 140 songs from this game and its sequel, \"Rhythm Tengoku Gold\".\nDevelopment.\nTsunku contributed more than 30 soundtracks, and worked with Nintendo's Yoshio Sakamoto in making the game. It was not known until the game's release that Tsunku was involved with the game, with the Drum Samurai being based on him. Because it was developed by R&amp;D1, it looks like and plays like the \"WarioWare\" series.\nReception.\n\"Rhythm Tengoku\" has received many positive reviews. EuroGamer called it \"effortlessly entertaining,\" or that the game was very fun without putting too much work into it. Edge said it was a best takes on rhythm games and one of the last good Game Boy Advance games.\n\"Rhythm Tengoku\" received an Excellence Prize for Entertainment at the 10th annual Japan Media Arts Festival in 2006.\nBy the end of 2006, \"Rhythm Tengoku\" sold a total of 282,879 copies and was the 43rd best-selling game of that year.\nArcade version.\nNintendo and Sega made an arcade version of \"Rhythm Tengoku\" that had multiplayer, which the Game Boy Advance version did not have. It has all the same levels as in the Game Boy Advance version, but it has a new mode that lets the first six games be played at a faster tempo.\nSequel.\nNintendo released a sequel to \"Rhythm Tengoku\" called \"Rhythm Heaven\" for the Nintendo DS. It's made by the same people who made this game. It uses the DS' touch screen instead of the buttons, and the DS is held sideways. While \"Rhythm Tengoku\" has only been sold in Japan, the second game came out in the United States, Europe, and Australia. Another game was made called \"Rhythm Heaven Fever\" for the Wii."}

It is the sequel to \"Rhythm Tengoku\".\nGameplay.\n\"Rhythm Heaven\" only uses the touch screen on the DS to play the stages. In the stages, the player has to do what the game wants him or her to, like in a level where the player has a song in the background, and has to fill robots with a liquid to send it off. The robot goes on a conveyer belt, and the player has to drop the nozzle to the beat of the music and try to get it to land on its head. Then, the player has to hold it there until the robot fills up and flies away. If the player does it right, he or she gets a perfect hit. If the player overfills, underfills, or barely misses, it's a half-hit. If the player misses completely, it's a miss. At the end, the player is ranked, either getting a Perfect Level, Mediocre, or a Miss. The touch screen can do a lot of stuff, like a \"flick\" motion where the player flicks in a direction with the stylus or just touch the screen. The first stage has the player flicking a screw using a spring to the beat of the music. At the right moment, the player has to flick the screw into two squares as they roll down the level at the right time to make them come together. \nThere's a mode called Guitar Lessons that's like the Drum Lessons in \"Rhythm Tengoku\".\nMusic.\nLike in \"Rhythm Tengoku\", Tsunku made the music for this game. A soundtrack released on October 15, 2008 with 140 songs from this game and \"Rhythm Tengoku\", which came before this game."}

Historians have claimed the violence and consequent Italian Istrian-Dalmatian exodus was a planned ethnic cleansing. National Memorial Day of the Exiles and Foibe is Italian celebration in memory of the victims.\nNumber of killed Italian citizens.\nThe estimate is several thousand killed Italian citizens. According to a report issued in 2000 by a mixed Slovene-Italian historical commission established in 1993, the number of people missing from the region, most of whom finished in the \"foibe\", alias local geological clefts, range from 1,300 to 1,600 but this estimate does not include those killed in current Croatian territory. Some of them were court-martialed fascists or enemy soldiers, but many civilian persons were also killed. The great majority of the persons killed were of Italian nationality.\nThe killings beginning after the capitulation of Italy in 1943, and the massacres of 1945 occurred partly under conditions of guerrilla fighting of Slovenian and Croatian partisans with the German and remaining Italian Fascist forces, and partially after the occupation of the territory by the army formations of Yugoslavia. Killings may have included war crimes as well as civilian crimes of private or political retaliation, as well as \"political cleansing\" and planned ethnic cleansing since 1947. Also Italian communists with Slav partisans killed Italian people; in addition to the foibe, several other carnages committed by Italian communist partisans under Palmiro Togliatti's command in the resistance movement have remained unacknowledged and undiscussed for many years.\nVictims.\nVictims were not all Italians because many killed citizen were anticommunist Croats and Slovens: many women were raped before killing. Historians like Raoul Pupo or Roberto Spazzali estimated the total number of victims at about 5,000; Guido Rumici calculates from 11,000 upwards including all people died in concentration camps; Giampaolo Pansa calculates around 15,000 always including all people died in concentration camps; fascist politician and historian Giorgio Pisan\u00f2 calculated total from 10,000 upwards. It was never possible to extract all the thousands of corpses from foibes because some of them are deeper than several hundreds meters. Until few years ago it had been able to extract from the pits just a small number of bodies, less than six hundred while other sources are attempting to compile lists of locations and possible victim numbers. Almost all historians calculate hundreds of victims real assassinated by hard pushes to foibe while the estimated number of total people killed in concentration camps is disputed and varies in thousands; probably only a part of total cadavers was hided in foibe but a lot of bodies were accumulated in mass graves. Main concentration camps were in: Borovnica, Skofja Loka, Osijek, Stara Gradiska, Sisak, Zemun, Vrsac, Osseh, Aidussina, Maribor.\nInvestigations of the foibe.\nNo investigation of the crimes had been initiated either by Italy, Yugoslavia or any international bodies, until after Slovenia became an independent country in 1991. Italian-Slovene relations in the relevant period (1880s to 1950s) have been under intensive study by historians since 1990. A joint report by a commission of historians from both countries was published under the auspices of the two governments in the year 2000. The report puts the Italian-Slovenian relations in a wider context. It touches also on the question of mass killings associated with the \"foibe\". As no exact count was ascertained, the report includes a wording of \"hundreds of victims,\" referring to the territory relevant for Italo-Slovenian relations, and thus excluding the Croatian territories.\nItalian-Slovene relationships.\nEven since Slovenia joined the European Union the relations between the two nations are a matter of political debate. The debate gained high visibility after the Italian Parliament, under Prime Minister Berlusconi and his coalition partners of centre-right provenance, made 10 February a \"National Memorial Day of the Exiles and Foibe\", first celebrated in Trieste in 2005. The 2005 celebration of the \"Memorial Day\" was accompanied by an RAI TV movie production The Heart in the Pit (It: \"Il Cuore nel Pozzo\") . The movie was viewed by 17 million spectators on its first broadcasting in Italy alone.\nExiles from Istria and Dalmatia.\nMany Italians were forced to leave the country after massacres. Economic insecurity, fear of further retaliation and the change of regime that eventually led to the Iron Curtain splitting the Trieste-Istria region, resulted in approximately 350,000 people, mostly Italians, leaving territories in Istria and Dalmatia. The inhabitants of territories that were under Italian rule since World War I according to the Treaty of Rapallo of 1920, later assigned to Yugoslavia by the Paris Peace Treaty of 1947-02-10 and the London Memorandum of 1954 were given a choice of opting to leave (optants) or staying. These exiles were to be given compensation for their loss of property and other indemnity by the Italian state under the terms of the peace treaties.\nOn February 18, 1983, Yugoslavia and Italy signed a treaty in Rome where Yugoslavia agreed to pay 110 million USD for the compensation of the exiles' property which was confiscated after the war. By its breakup in 1991 Yugoslavia paid 18 million USD. Slovenia and Croatia, two Yugoslav successors, agreed to share the remainder of this debt. Slovenia assumed 62% and Croatia the remaining 38%. Italy did not want to reveal the bank account number so in 1994 Slovenia opened a fiduciary account at Dresdner Bank in Luxembourg, informed Italy about it and started paying its 55,976,930 USD share. The last payment was paid in January 2002. Until today Croatia hopes for a different solution of this matter and has not paid a dollar yet. The Italian side has not withdrawn a single dollar from the account yet.\nCharge.\nIn 1992 Italian judge Giuseppe Pittitto started a criminal trial after a complaint against suspected Slav criminals of war. Oscar Piskulic and Ivan Motika were both principal accused but they were discharged because territorial jurisdiction was rejected and they received acquittal under the amnesty of 1959. In 1997 some Italian deputies pressed their government for extradition of suspected Slav criminals but diplomatic problems stopped Italian action. All Italian historians consider Josip Broz Tito the chief of Slav criminals, but his corpse still stays in a mausoleum.\nReferences.\nReport of the Italian-Slovene commission of historians (in three languages)"}

Those territories were ethnically mixed since the Middle Ages. Most people were Italians, but there were also Slovenian, Croatian, Serbian and other communities.\nNational Memorial Day of the Exiles and Foibe is Italian celebration in memory of all exiles and victims in massacres of Foibe: murdered and survived.\nCharacteristics.\nIstria including Fiume (Rijeka) and parts of Dalmatia including Zara (zadar), had been annexed to Italy after World War I. At the end of World War II the former Italian territories in Istria and Dalmatia became part of Yugoslavia by the Paris Peace Treaty (1947), with the only exception being the communes of Muggia and San Dorligo della Valle.\nItalian sources claim that about 350,000 ethnic Italians had to leave the areas after the conflict. Official data shows that between 1948 and 1961 (the \"exodus\" started in 1943 in Dalmatia and in 1945 in the rest of the territory) the numbers of ethnic Italians living in Slovenia - almost exclusively in Slovenian Istria and along the Italian border - actually decreased by nearly -87% (from 25,451 to 3,072). The data for the Former Yugoslavia shows a decrease in the same years from 113,278 to 25,615. According to Slovenian historian Matja\u017e Klemen\u010di\u010d, \"in 1953 only 36,000\" (Italians) \"lived in the region of former Yugoslavia, i.e. 16% of the Italian population before World War II. Italians also emigrated in later decades (most of them to the Australia, Canada, South America or the USA). Therefore their population declined in each subsequent census until 1981. We have to emphasize that the data of the Yugoslav census are unrealiable in relation to the real number if Italians, since many members of the Italian minority, for various reasons, chose 'Nationality Undeclared' or their regional identity (most as 'Istrians'). In the 1991 census there was a relatively large increase of Italians,\" (19,213 in the Regions of autochthonous settlements of Italians in Croatia) \"compared to 1981 census\" (15,132). \"Many Italians who in previous census did not declare as such, declared themselves 'Italians' in 1991 because they counted on the help of Italy in forthcoming crises in the region\".\nIn some municipalities in Croatia in Slovenia, census data shows that there are still many Italians living in Istria, such as 66% of the population of Grisignano (519 Italians), 41% at Bertoniglia (652 Italians) and nearly 40% in Buie (2,118 Italians).\nOverview of the exodus.\nThe Italians in coastal Slovenia and Croatia were mostly an indigenous population (in 1910 they accounted for more than a third of the local inhabitants, while in Istria they were nearly 55%), bolstered by new arrivals or the so called \"regnicoli\", never well liked by the slavs by the indigenous Venetian-speaking Istrians, who arrived between 1918-1943, when Istria, Fiume, part of Dalmatia, and the islands of Cres (Cherso), Lussino, Lagosta, and Pelagosa (Palagru\u017ea) were part of Italy. Austrian 1910 census indicated approximately 182,500 people who listed Italian as their language of communication in what is now the territory of Slovenia and Croatia: 137,131 in Istria, 28,911 in Fiume/Rijeka (1918), 11,487 in Zara/Zadar, 5,000 in Dalmatia, while the Italian 1936 census indicated approximately 230,000 people who listed Italian as their language of communication in what is now the territory of Slovenia and Croatia, then part of the Italian state (ca. 194,000 in today\u2019s Croatia and ca. 36,000 in today\u2019s Slovenia). From the end of World War II until 1953, according to various data, between 250,000 and 350,000 people emigrated from these regions. Some thousands were Slovenes and Croats who opposed the Communist government in Yugoslavia, while most were ethnic Italians, the so-called \"optanti\" emigrants who were living permanently in this region on 10 June 1940 and who expressed their wish to obtain Italian citizenship and emigrate to Italy. The emigration of Italians greatly reduced the total population of the region and totally altered its ethnic structure.\nIn 1953, officially, only 36,000 Italians lived in Yugoslavia, 16% of the Italian population before World War II. In its 1996 report on 'Local self-government, territorial integrity and protection of minorities' the Council of Europe's European Commission for Democracy through Law (the Venice Commission) put it that \"a great majority of the local Italians, Italianites (of Slavic and other origin), many thousands of Slovenes and of nationally undefined bilingual 'Istrians' used their legal right from the peace treaty to 'opt out' of the Yugoslav controlled part of Istria. In several waves they moved to Italy and elsewhere (also overseas) and claimed Italian or other citizenship. The mass exodus of the optanti (or \"esuli\" as they were called in Italy) from 'godless communist Yugoslavia' was actively encouraged by the Italian authorities, Italian radio and the Roman Catholic bishop of Trieste. After this huge drain, the numerical strength of the remaining Italian minority became stable\".\nHistory.\nAncient times.\nEvidence of Italic people living alongside those from other ethnic groups on the eastern side of the Adriatic as far north as the Alps goes back at least to the Bronze Age, and the populations have been mixed ever since. A 2001 population census counted 23 languages spoken by the people of Istria. Istria and Dalmatia were fully latinized at the fall of the Roman empuire in the fifth century.\nFrom the Middle Ages onwards numbers of Slavic people near and on the Adriatic coast were ever increasing, due to their expanding population and due to pressure from the Turks pushing them from the south and east. This led to Italic people becoming ever more confined to urban areas in Dalmatia, while the countryside was populated by Slavs, with certain isolated exceptions. But Istria remained fully Italian until the Ottoman invasion in the sixteenth century.\nThe original majority Italian population suffered economic and political disadvantages, which gradually increased with the Austro-Hungarian empire in the 19th century. This created a strong emigration: in Dalmatia the Dalmatian Italians were 25% in 1815, but a century later in 1915 they were only 2%.\nWorld War I and the Post-War Period.\nIn 1915, the Italians attacked the Austro-Hungarian Empire leading to bloody conflict mainly on the Isonzo and Piave fronts. Britain, France and Russia had been \"keen to bring neutral Italy into World War One on their side. Italy however drove a hard bargain, demanding extensive territorial concessions once the war had been won\".\nIn a deal to draw Italy into the war, under the London Pact, Italy was granted Trentino, Trieste, (the German-speaking) South Tyrol, and Istria including large non-Italian communities. But Dalmatia was excluded, as was Rijeka. In Dalmatia, not granted to Italy by the London pact, Italy gained the city of Zadar and some islands.\nAfter World War I, under the Treaty of Rapallo between the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Kingdom of Yugoslavia) and the Kingdom of Italy (12 November 1920), Italy obtained all of Istria with Trieste, the exception being the island of Krk and part of Kastav commune, which went to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. By the Treaty of Rome (27 January 1924) the Free state of Fiume was split between Italy and Yugoslavia.\nWorld War Two.\nAfter the Wehrmacht invasion of Yugoslavia (6 April 1941), the Italian zone of occupation was further expanded. Italy annexed large areas of coastal Yugoslavia (including most of coastal Dalmatia) and Slovenia (including its capital Ljubljana).\nAfter the Second World War, there were large-scale movements of people choosing to move to Italy rather than live in Yugoslavia. In Yugoslavia, the people who left were called \"optanti\", which translates as 'choosers', while they call themselves \"esuli\" or exiles. Their motives for leaving may have been fear of reprisals and murders, economic motives, or ethnically based.\nThe foibe massacres.\nWhen the Fascist regime collapsed in 1943 reprisals against Italian fascists and civilians (even Italian communists) took place. At least 200 Italians were killed by Tito's resistance movement in September 1943; some had been connected to the fascist regime, while others were victims of personal hatred or the attempt of the partisan resistance to get rid of its real or supposed enemies. These events took place in central and eastern Istria, as well as in Slovenian Primorska.&lt;br&gt;\nThe second wave of anti-Italian violence took place after occupation of Slav army in May 1945. This was known as the foibe massacres; actually it was a reenaction of what had been already began in 1943 but in larger scale.\nMany Italian sources claim that these killings were ethnic cleansing and genocide: Italian people were forced to mass migration by Tito supporters.\nThe mixed Italian-Slovenian Historical Commission, established in 1995 by the two governments to investigate the matters, described the 1945 killings:\nThe number of victims is not certain. The Italian historian Raoul Pupo suggests 4,500 were killed (including the events of 1943), mostly Italians, but many bodies wearing Partisan uniforms were found as well, so the number is subject to many interpretations. Other sources suggest numbers reaching up to 30,000 killed or missing.\nThe exodus.\nEconomic insecurity, ethnic hatred and the international political context that eventually led to the Iron Curtain resulted in approximately 350,000 people, mostly Italians, choosing to leave the region. The London Memorandum of 1954 gave to the ethnic Italians the choice of either opting to leave (the so-called \"optants\") or staying. These exiles were to be given compensation for their loss of property and other indemnity by the Italian state under the terms of the peace treaties. Following the exodus, the areas were settled with Yugoslav people.\nPeriods of the exodus.\nThe exodus took place between 1943 and 1960; Italians allege that most of their numbers left in\nThe first period took place after the surrender of the Italian army and the beginning of the first wave of anti-fascist violence.\nThe second period was soon after the end of the war and approximately around the time of the second wave of anti-fascist violence. The Wehrmacht was engaged in a front-wide retreat from the Yugoslav Partisans, along with the local collaborationist forces (the Usta\u0161e, the Domobranci, the Chetniks, and units of Mussolini's puppet Italian Social Republic).\nThe third period took place after the Paris peace treaty, when Istria was assigned to the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, except for a small area in the northwest part that formed the independent Free Territory of Trieste.\nThe fourth period took place after the Memorandum of Understanding in London. It gave provisional civil administration of Zone A (with Trieste), to Italy, and Zone B to Yugoslavia: in 1975 the Treaty of Osimo finally divided the former Free Territory of Trieste.\nEstimates of the exodus.\nSeveral estimates of the exodus by historians:\nThe mixed Italian-Slovenian Historical Commission verified 27,000 Italian and 3,000 Slovene migrants, but only from Slovenian territory.\nFamous exiles.\nIn the list are persons who worked in other places before the war and are also considered exiles due to their properties being confiscated by the communist dictatorship under Josip Broz. Famous postwar exiles from territories include:\nProperty reparation.\nOn February 18, 1983 Yugoslavia and Italy signed a treaty in [[Rome]]. Yugoslavia agreed to pay US$110 million for the compensation of the exiles' property which was confiscated after the war in the Zone B of [[Free Territory of Trieste]]. Up to its breakup in 1991, Yugoslavia had paid US$18 million. Slovenia and [[Croatia]], two Yugoslav [[successor state|successors]], agreed to share the remainder of this debt. Slovenia assumed 62% and Croatia the remaining 38%. Italy did not want to reveal the bank account number so in 1994 Slovenia opened a fiduciary account at Dresdner Bank in [[Luxembourg]], informed Italy about it and started paying its US$55,976,930 share. The last payment was due in January 2002. Until today, the solution of the matter between Croatia and Italy has been delayed. None of the refugees from the [[Free Territory of Trieste]] saw a single penny so far.\nHistorical debate.\nIt has been established that foibe massacres were been used by Slav communists for ethnic-political cleansing. In fact, foibe massacres and exodus were described as a [[democide]] and an ethnic-political cleansing by Italian president [[Giorgio Napolitano]].\nSlovenian historian Darko Darovec writes:\nFor the mixed Italian-Slovenian Historical Commission:\nOther websites.\n[[Category:Dalmatia]]\n[[Category:20th century in Italy]]\n[[Category:World War II]]"}

The historian Theodore Mommsen stated in his book \"History of Rome\" that all Dalmatia was fully Romanised and Latin speaking by the fourth century.\nThe actual Dalmatians may in part trace their origins back to the Romanised Illyrians during the \"Barbarian Invasions\" of the fifth and sixth centuries when Avars with some Slavs invaded Illyria. This invasion opened the way to the settlement of different Slavic tribes (mainly the \"Croats\").\nDuring those years the original Latin population took refuge in the coastal cities and in the islands, whilst other migrated to the mountains (they were later called \"Morlachs\"). So, in the early Middle Ages, the coastal area of Dalmatia retained its original Latinized culture, mainly on the islands and cities such as Zara, Spalato, Ragusa and Cattaro. These cities during the Middle Ages were called \"Citta' marittime di Dalmazia\" (Dalmatian maritime neolatin cities) and maintained deep cultural and commercial links with the Italian mainland, thanks to intense commerce through the Adriatic sea.\nStarting from the tenth century the Republic of Venice imposed its influence on Dalmatia, gradually assimilating the neolatin Dalmatians while the local Slavs maintained their language.\nThe Republic of Venice controlled most of Dalmatia from 1420 to 1797. During that period, part of its Slavic population was italianised. The Venetian possessions were called \"Venetian Dalmatia\" and enjoyed a flourishing period of economic bonanza with huge development of the arts and culture. Dalmatia was greatly influenced by the Italian Renaissance and many buildings, churches and cathedrals were done in those years, from Zara and Spalato to Sebenik and Ragusa.\nIn these centuries, the Venetian language became the \"lingua franca\" of all Dalmatia, assimilating the Dalmatian language of the Romanised Illyrians and influencing partially the coastal Croatian language (\"Chakavian\") and the Albanian language.\nZara was the capital of the Venetian Dalmatia, a role that it has maintained through the successive centuries (during WWII it was the capital of the Italian \"Governatorato di Dalmazia\").\nIn those centuries, the most southern area of Dalmatia was called Albania veneta, now called coastal Montenegro.\nAfter the fall of the Republic of Venice in 1797 to the Napoleon Armies, the Dalmatia was incorporated briefly (1805-1809) in the \"Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy\". In those years the scholastic system was expanded to all the population (following the ideals of the French Revolution) and the Italian language was instituted as the official language in the schools of Dalmatia.\nWhen Austria occupied Dalmatia there was a revival of the Slav people inside Dalmatia. The Italian (venetian speaking) population, that was (according to the Italian linguist Bartoli) nearly one third of the Dalmatians in the second half of the XVIII century, according to the Austrian census decreased from 22% in 1816 to 12.5% in 1853 and a mere 2.9% in 1910.\nAfter WWI, by the Treaty of London, Italy obtained Zara and some northern Dalmatian islands (Cherso and Lussino). During WWII the Kingdom of Italy annexed, to the newly created \"Governatorato di Dalmazia\", most of Dalmatia. In 1942 there were 4020 Italians in these newly annexed areas: 2220 in Spalato (Split), 300 in Sebenico (Sibenik), 500 Cattaro (Kotor) and 1000 Veglia (Krk). Furthermore there were in the Governatorato 10000 Italians who took the Yugoslav citizenship after WWI, in order to remain there and be accepted without problems by the new Yugoslavian regime after the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.\nAfter WWII Italy lost all the territories in Dalmatia, and more than 22000 Dalmatian Italians exiled mainly in Italy. There are still some Dalmatian Italians in Dalmatia: 300 in Croatia and 500 in Montenegro. In Zara the small Dalmatian Italian community only in September 2012 has been allowed to have a kindergarten for Italian speaking children \nThat means that in only one hundred years (from the 1850s to the 1950s) the Dalmatian Italians decreased from 45000 in the 1857 Austrian Census to less than one thousand in the last Croatian and Montenegrin Census.\nCultural Influence.\nThe cultural influence from the Italian peninsula is extremely important in Dalmatia since the Roman times. It has increased to influence totally the dalmatian culture during the times of the Republic of Venice and the Italian Renaissance.\nIndeed, the \"British Encyclopedia\" states that: \"the monuments left in Dalmatia by the Romans are numerous and precious. They are chiefly confined to the cities; for the civilization of the country was always urban, just as its history is a record of isolated city-states rather than of a united nation. Beyond the walls of its larger towns, little was spared by the barbarian Goths, Avars and Slavs; and the battered fragments of Roman work which mark the sites of Salona, near Spalato, and of many other ancient cities, are of slight antiquarian interest and slighter artistic value. Among the monuments of the Roman period, by far the most noteworthy in Dalmatia, and, indeed, in the whole Balkan Peninsula, is the Palace of Diocletian at Spalato. Dalmatian architecture was influenced by Constantinople in its general character from the 6th century until the close of the tenth. The oldest memorials of this period are the vestiges of three basilicas, excavated in Salona, and dating from the first half of the 7th century at latest. Then from Italy came the Romanesque. The belfry of S. Maria, at Zara, erected in 1105, is first in a long list of Romanesque buildings. At Arbe there is a beautiful Romanesque campanile which also belongs to the 12th century; but the finest example in this style is the cathedral of Trail. The 14th century Dominican and Franciscan convents in Ragusa are also noteworthy. Romanesque lingered on in Dalmatia until it was displaced by Venetian Gothic in the early years of the 15th century. The influence of Venice was then at its height. Even in the relatively hostile republic of Ragusa the Romanesque of the custom-house and Rectors' palace is combined with Venetian Gothic, while the graceful balconies and ogee windows of the Prijeki closely follow their Venetian models. In 1441 Giorgio Orsini of Zara, summoned from Venice to design the cathedral of Sebenico, brought with him the influence of the Italian Renaissance. The new forms which he introduced were eagerly imitated and developed by other architects, until the period of decadence - which virtually concludes the history of Dalmatian art - set in during the latter half of the 17th century. Special mention must be made of the carved woodwork, embroideries and plate preserved in many churches. The silver statuette and the reliquary of St Biagio at Ragusa, and the silver ark of St Simeon at Zara, are fine specimens of Italian jewellers' work, ranging in date from the 11th or 12th to the 17th century\".\nIn the XIX century the cultural influence from Italy originated the creation in Zara of the first dalmatian newspaper, edited in Italian and Croat: \"Il Regio Dalmata - Kraglski Dalmatin\". It was founded and published by the Italian Bartolomeo Benincasa in 1806.\nThe Regio Dalmata - Kraglski Dalmatin was stamped in the tipography of Antonio Luigi Battara and was the first done in Croat language.\nThe cultural influence from Italy is clearly evident in the urbanization plans of the main Dalmatian cities in the XIX/XX centuries. One of the best examples is the one of Split/Spalato.\nIn 1880 Antonio Bajamonti (the last Dalmatian Italian Major of Spalato under Austrian rule) developed an urbanization project of this city centered on the \"Riva\", a seaside walkway full of palms based on the Italian Riviera models. Even today the Riva (with cafe bars) is used by the locals to stroll in a typical Italian way from the \"Palace of Diocletian\" toward an old square called locally \"Pjaca\" (or square in venetian).\nEven in music the Italian influence was very strong in Dalmatia \nPerasto: an enduring example.\nAn enduring example of the Italian cultural and historic presence in Dalmatia is the small town of Perasto (actually Perast in montenegrin language) in coastal Montenegro.\nPerasto was at its peak in the 18th century under the Republic of Venice, when it had as many as four active shipyards, a fleet of around one hundred ships, and 1,643 residents. At that time the most beautiful buildings arose in this fortified town. Many ornate baroque palaces and magnificent dwelling-houses decorated the town of Perast (Perasto), full of typical venetian architecture.\nPerasto had the privilege to keep war-flag of the Venetian Navy in the peace time (it was called \"La fedelissma Gonfaloniera\") . \nThe sailormen of Perasto were involved in the last battle of the Venitian navy, fought in Venice in 1797 .\nAt the fall of the \"Serenissima\" (1797) Perasto was the last city of the Repubblic to lower the Venetian flag. On 12 May 1797, the Republic of Venice ended, but a few places in the Albania veneta for several months still continued to remain loyal to the Venetian Repubblic: Perasto was the last place of the Republic to surrender. On 22 August 1797 the Count Giuseppe Viscovich, Captain of Perasto lowered the Venetian war-flag of the Lion of Saint Mark pronouncing the farewell words in front of the crying people of the city and buried the \"Gonfalon of Venice\" under the altar of the main church of Perasto.\nThe population has since decreased to 430 in 1910 and around 360 today. According to the \"Comunita' nazionale italiana del Montenegro\", in Perast actually there are 140 persons who still speak at home the original venetian dialect of Perasto (called \"veneto da mar\"), and call themselves in the census \"Montenegrins\"."}

Plants spend a lot of energy and nutrients in creating fruit. Fruit is produced to attract animals into eating the fruit. The animal digests the pulp but not the seeds, ensuring the plant's genes are spread wherever the animal goes. Seeds can also be germinated by falling near the mother plant. Some seeds must pass through the digestive system (the stomach and intestines) before they can germinate.\nFrugivores have also evolved in different ways to eat different fruit; some use teeth, others long beaks or short beaks.\nExamples of frugivores.\nMany birds eat both fruits and insects which makes them omnivores. Mammals may eat both fruits and protein, or eat mostly fruit or nectar, such as many bats. One primate group is essentially herbivore/frugivore, the Owl Monkeys. They live in a non-seasonal area of the Amazon that supports a constant supply of fruiting trees. Elsewhere, an exclusively frugivore diet is impossible and is supplemented by insects or rougher plant matter. Some people say that humans are frugivores; this is unlikely given the evolution of man in the dry tropical region of the Rift Valley. However, the climate in the Rift valley at the time of our evolution was likely a tropical rainforest. That said, almost all primates and even carnivores will travel great distances to feast when a fruit tree has dropped its ripened fruit. Many species will remember the exact fruiting date and location of a fruiting tree which highlights fruits great nutritional benefit. Some people promote a frugivore diet for humans.\nOther websites.\nView on diet and health at NHE Self-Health Care Systems: Biological Adaptations"}

Ethnologue reported 70,000 speakers in 1998: 40,000 ethnic Italians and 30,000 ethnic Croats and Istrian people. Native Italian speakers are largely concentrated along the Adriatic coast.

It has four main ideas:\n1. Everything that exists has an identity. This identity does not depend on how people think about it or talk about it. This is also true for things like feelings or ideas. It says that a thing is the thing which it is, or \"A is A.\" What people learn about the things that exist comes both from the identity of the things themselves and from the way that people observe (see) and think about what they have observed.\n2. Reason is how a person knows that what he thinks or believes is true. A person cannot make something true just by wanting it to be true or by mysticism. Only rational, logical thinking can produce the best outcome. This means recognizing that a thing is the thing it is, and to not confuse it with things which it is not.\n3. It is good to be happy, and it is good for a person to try to be happy. People should always try to improve their lives and be happy in the long term, so that they are happy now and in the future. People should not hurt others to try to be happy, but they also should not hurt themselves to try to make other people happy. People should also not make themselves less happy to help something like God. Ayn Rand called this \"rational self-interest\".\n4. If governments or criminals take things away from people, or try to make people do things they do not want to do, it does damage to everybody. Ayn Rand thought that governments should only be able to protect people from violence, theft, fraud, and other actions that go against people's rights. This includes laissez-faire capitalism and is sometimes called libertarianism.\nShe first told people these ideas in her novels \"The Fountainhead\" and \"Atlas Shrugged\". She talked about them more in \"The Objectivist Newsletter\", \"The Objectivist\", \"The Ayn Rand Letter\", \"Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology\" and \"The Virtue of Selfishness\"."}

He is one of the founders of studies on animal behaviour (ethology). Lorenz studied instinctive behavior in animals, especially in Greylag geese and jackdaws.\nBiography.\nIn his autobiographical essay, published in 1973 in \"Les Prix Nobel\" (people who win the Nobel Prize are asked to write essays about their lives), Lorenz said that his parents were the main reason he was so successful. He also said that a book by Selma Lagerlof called \"The Wonderful Adventures of Nils\" that he read as a child was the reason he became interested in wild geese.\nLorenz began his studies in 1922 at Columbia University, but he returned to Vienna in 1923 to continue his studies at the University of Vienna until 1928. At this university he became an assistant professor from 1928 to 1935.\nIn 1936, Lorenz met his great friend and colleague Niko Tinbergen. Together they studied geese \u2013 wild, domestic, and hybrid.\nIn 1940 Lorenz became a professor of psychology at the University of K\u00f6nigsberg. He was drafted into the Wehrmacht in 1941. He tried to become a motorcycle mechanic, but instead he was assigned as a medic. He was a prisoner of war in the Soviet Union from 1942 to 1948. During this time, he continued to work as a medical doctor and \"got quite friendly with some Russians, mostly doctors\". When he was sent back home after the war, he was allowed to keep both the manuscript of the book he had been writing and his pet starling. He arrived back in Altenberg \"with manuscript and bird intact.\" The manuscript became his book \"Behind the Mirror\". \nLorenz shared the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \"for discoveries in individual and social behavior patterns\" with two other important early ethologists, Niko Tinbergen and Karl von Frisch. In 1969, he became the first person to receive the Prix mondial \"Cino Del Duca\".\nLorenz retired from the Max Planck Institute in 1973 but continued to research and publish from his family home, in Austria. Konrad Lorenz died on 27 February 1989, in Altenberg.\nPolitics.\nLorenz joined the Nazi Party in 1938 and accepted a university position under Nazi Germany. In his application for membership to the Nazi-party NSDAP he wrote in 1938: \"I'm able to say that my whole scientific work is devoted to the ideas of the National Socialists.\" \nWhen he accepted the Nobel Prize in 1973, Lorenz apologized for a 1940 publication that included Nazi views of science, saying that \"many highly decent scientists hoped, like I did, for a short time [that] National Socialism [would produce good results], and many quickly turned away from it with the same horror as I [did].\"\nLorenz' ideas.\nTogether with Niko Tinbergen, Lorenz formed the idea of an innate releasing mechanism to explain instinctive behaviors (fixed action patterns). Building on the ideas of William McDougall, Lorenz developed this into a \"psychohydraulic\" explanation of the motives (reasons) of behavior. Another contribution is his work on imprinting. His influence on a younger generation of ethologists, as well as his books, were important in bringing ethology to the attention of the general public.\nLorenz' vision of the challenges facing humanity.\nLorenz predicted that market economics could eventually destroy Earth's ecosystem. In his 1973 book, \"Civilized Man's Eight Deadly Sins\", Lorenz considered the following paradox: \nLorenz adopts an ecological model to attempt to explain how this contradiction can exist:\nIn nature, these mechanisms tend towards a 'stable state' among the living beings of an ecology: \nLorenz states that humanity is the only species that is not controlled by these mechanisms. This is because humans are the only species that can change its own environment: \"[The pace of human ecology] is determined by the progress of man's technology\". Not only that, but human ecology (economy) is governed by mechanisms of positive feedback, defined as a mechanism which tends to encourage behavior rather than to discourage it. p43 \nLorenz does not see human independence from natural ecological processes as necessarily bad. Indeed, he states that \"a completely new [ecology] which corresponds in every way to [humanity's] desires... could, theoretically, prove as durable as that which would have existed without his intervention\" p36. However, the principle of competition, typical of Western societies, destroys any chance of this: \nIn this book, Lorenz proposes that the best hope for mankind lies in our looking for mates based on the kindness of their hearts rather than good looks or wealth.\nPhilosophical ideas.\nIn his 1973 book \"Behind the Mirror: a search for a natural history of human knowledge\", Lorenz considers an old philosophical question: Do our senses actually tell us about the world as it is? Or do they only give us an illusion? Lorenz' answer comes from evolutionary biology. Only things that help a species to survive and reproduce are kept. Anything that does not benefit a species is quickly removed through the process of natural selection. Lorenz argued that if our senses gave us wrong information about our environment, humanity would soon be extinct. Therefore we can be sure that our senses give us correct information, for otherwise we would not be here to be deceived.\nBooks and essays.\nLorenz's best-known books are \"King Solomon's Ring\" and \"On aggression\", both written for a popular audience. His scientific work appeared mainly in journal articles, written in German; they became widely known to English-speaking scientists through the descriptions of it in Tinbergen's 1951 book \"The study of instinct\", though many of his papers were later published in English translation in the two volumes titled \"Studies in animal and human behaviour\".

This group, though small in numbers, exerted an unproportionally significant and noteworthy influence on the region in the last centuries.\nIndeed the Dalmatian Italians were a fundamental presence in Dalmatia, when the process of political unification of the Italians, Croats and Serbs started at the beginning of the 19th century. The 1816 Austro-Hungarian census registered 66,000 Italian speaking people between the 301,000 inhabitants of Dalmatia, or 22% of the total dalmatian population. But in 2010 they were reduced to only a few hundreds.\nThey are currently represented in Croatia and Montenegro by the \"Italian National Community\" () (CNI). The Italo-Croatian minorities treaty recognizes the \"Italian Union\" (Unione Italiana) as the political party officially representing the CNI in Croatia. The number of Dalmatian Italians in that country has fallen to 300, and the Italian Union concentrates on the Istrian region, including the city of Fiume (actual Rijeka), which is home to the vast majority of the Croatian Italian national minority numbering around 30,000 citizens.\nIn Dalmatia the most important centres of the CNI are in Zara (actual Zadar), Spalato and Cattaro (Montenegro).\nHistory.\nDalmatian Italians participated actively in the Union of Italy, called \"Risorgimento\".\nMany Dalmatian Italians tried to unite their cities (like Spalato) to the Kingdom of Italy after the end of WWI: the Incidents in Spalato were the most famous event related to their struggle.\nSome Dalmatian Italians, mostly living in Zara (actual Zadar), entered in the Italian government after WWI and promoted the conquest of coastal Dalmatia by Italian troops in 1941. Most of coastal Dalmatia was united to the Kingdom of Italy from April 1941 to September 1943, when were created the Provincia di Spalato and the Provincia di Cattaro while was enlargerd the Provincia di Zara. \nAfter WWII nearly all the 25.000 remaining Dalmatian Italians of Zara and the Italian \"Governatorato di Dalmazia\" were forced to leave Dalmatia during the Istrian-Dalmatian exodus.\nNowadays one of the principal problems for the exiled is the prohibition to buy houses in Croatia for Italian people not resident in Croatia (and, of course, their request of payment for their properties lost in Dalmatia when forced to exile).\nOrganizations and periodicals.\nMany Dalmatian Italians are organized in associations such as:\nThe most popular periodical for Dalmatian Italians is \"Il Dalmata\", published in Trieste by Renzo de' Vidovich."}

The machines have taken over everywhere except for the city of Zion, which is buried four kilometers below the surface. In this world, the machines have created the Matrix, which looks like the real world but it is a trick. A few hundred humans have been \"unplugged\" and see the real reality, which is dark and barren. The humans find out that the machines are digging to invade that area and they want to stop it.\nOne group of humans, led by Morpheus, believe in something called the prophecy. They believe that The One (a human named Neo) will save the humans. Another group, led by Commander Jason Lock, believes that the prophecy does not make sense and try to defend Zion with ships and humans.\nNeo is called to see the Oracle. After he meets the Oracle, he gets into a fight with Smith. Smith is an old friend of his. He used to be an Agent, which meant that he was very powerful. However Neo defeated him at the end of the first movie. Smith says that he has new powers. He is able to touch someone and that someone becomes part of him. He and hundreds of these clones try to defeat Neo, but they are not very powerful and Neo beats them.\nSmith later touches someone named Bane. Now Smith controls an unplugged human, making him very dangerous. As Bane, Smith tries to kill Neo, but another human named the Kid accidentally stops that from happening when he comes to say goodbye to Neo. Later, the humans line all of their ships together. They hope to trigger their EMPs all at once to stop the machines (the EMP kills all electronics within their radius). Smith/Bane, on one of these ships, triggers the EMP before they are supposed to and ruins the attack.\nNeo and his crew try to fulfill the prophecy. They pick up a man named the Keymaker. They must get into a special room within a certain time limit. The power must be cut. The machines, which just beat back the surprise attack, attack one of the ships and the power comes back on. Trinity, Neo's girlfriend, gets into the system and turns off the power again.\nNeo meets a man named the Architect. He tells Neo that the prophecy is not true and that the machines will destroy Zion. It is The One's job to let it be destroyed and to pick new people to form a new Zion. The One must also touch the source. Neo learns that Trinity is in trouble and will die. Instead of doing what the Architect tells him, he saves Trinity.\nMorpheus is not happy that the war is not over yet. He says that the war should have been over when The One touched the source. Neo tells Morpheus what the Architect said. The machines attack the ship that Morpheus, Trinity, and Neo are on. They escape. Neo uses his powers to disable all the attacking machines, but falls unconscious. Another ship picks them up. The movie ends in the ship hospital room, where Bane and Neo are lying.\nBox office.\nThe response to this movie was big. It made $91 million in its first weekend at the box office, beating out the $50 million record set by \"Hannibal\" (2001) for an R-rated movie. Its final total of $281 million in the United States was the highest ever for an R-rated movie until \"The Passion of the Christ\" (2004) beat it with $370 million."}

Artificial turf is extremely popular in sporting industry - especially in US and regions where weather or heavy use makes it difficult to sustain high quality live turf.\nArtificial grass was first used in 1966 when it was installed in the Houston Astrodome, the world\u2019s first domed indoor multipurpose sports stadium. During the stadium\u2019s inaugural season in 1965 its real grass failed to grow. By the second half of the season the field conditions were so bad that they installed artificial grass, called \"Astroturf\".\nEnvironmental issues.\nThere are several environmental concerns associated with artificial turf including loss of wildlife habitat, contaminated runoff, and migration of synthetic materials. Contaminants that are harmful to aquatic life, such as zinc, have been found in storm water runoff from artificial turf. Both infill particles and broken synthetic grass fibers can migrate away from yards or playing fields, contributing to microplastic pollution."}

It was built about 3200 BC. The kidney shaped mound covers an area of over one acre and is surrounded by 97 kerbstones, some of which are decorated with megalithic art. The 19 metre long inner passage leads to a cruciform chamber with a corbelled roof. It is estimated that the construction of the Passage Tomb at Newgrange would have taken a work force of 300 at least 20 years.\nThe passage and chamber of Newgrange are lit up by the winter solstice sunrise. A shaft of sunlight shines through the roof box over the entrance and penetrates the passage to light up the chamber. The dramatic event lasts for 17 minutes at dawn on the Winter Solstice and for a few mornings either side of the Winter Solstice.\nAdmission to the Newgrange chamber for the Winter Solstice sunrise is by lottery, application forms are available at the Br\u00fa na B\u00f3inne Visitor Centre. For the 2007 draw 28,106 applications were submitted. In September each year, 50 names are drawn with 2 places are awarded to each name drawn.\nMegalithic mounds.\nMegalithic mounds such as Newgrange entered Irish mythology as s\u00eddhe or fairy mounds. Newgrange was said to be the home of Oenghus, the god of love. The Passage Tomb at Newgrange was re-discovered in 1699 by the removal of material for road building. A major excavation of Newgrange began in 1962; the original facade of sparkling white quartz was rebuilt using stone found at the site.\nWorld heritage site.\nNewgrange has been designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO and attracts 200,000 visitors per year. There is no direct access to the Passage Tomb at Newgrange, access is by guided tour from the Br\u00fa na B\u00f3inne Visitor Centre located close to the village of Donore, Co. Meath. The last tour of Newgrange is 90 minutes before closing time of the Visitor Centre. \nNewgrange chamber.\nImages from inside the chamber at Newgrange including the tri-spiral design on orthostat C10 which is probably the most famous Irish Megalithic symbol. It is often referred to as a Celtic design, but it was carved at least 2500 years before the Celts reached Ireland. At 12\u00a0inches in diameter the tri-spiral design is quite small in size, less than one-third the size of the tri-spiral design on the entrance stone."}

Her father was the Persian noble Abdul Hasan Asaf Khan, the brother of Nur Jahan, the Mughal Empress wife of Jahangir.\nMumtaz betrothed (nikah) with shah jahan at the age of 14 in 1607 when Shah Jahan was 15, Shah Jahan, later married two other women.May 10, 1612 at the age of 19 the official marriage ceremony was held.\nMarriage.\nShah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal were married for 19 years. They had thirteen children together. 7 of the children died at birth or at a very young age. Mumtaz travelled with Shah Jahan and his army as he carried out military campaigns. Mumtaz Mahal supported Shah Jahan and they respected each other very much. Mumtaz Mahal died on June 17, 1631 in Burhanpur in the Deccan (now in Madhya Pradesh) during the birth of their fourteenth child, a daughter named Gauhara Begum.\nDeath.\nShe had been with her husband as he was fighting a campaign in the Deccan Plateau. Her body was kept at Burhanpur in a walled pleasure garden known as Zainabad. A popular story says that on her deathbed, her last wish to the emperor was for a symbol or a monument to their love. She also asked her husband not to marry anyone else. The emperor promised immediately. Her body was buried in the Taj Mahal in Agra. It is also belived that Mumtaz Mahal died, aged 40, while giving birth to\u00a0Gauhara Begum\u00a0in\u00a0Burhanpur, the cause of death being Postpartum hemorrhage,\u00a0which caused considerable blood-loss after a painful labour of thirty hours. Contemporary historians note that Princess Jahanara, aged 17, was so distressed by her mother's pain that she started distributing gems to the poor, hoping for divine intervention and Shah Jahan, himself, was noted as being \"paralysed by grief\" and weeping fits.\nEffects.\nAfter she died, Shah Jahan went into mourning for 2 years. When he appeared again, his hair had turned white, his back was bent, and his face worn. Jahan's eldest daughter, Jahanara Begum, slowly brought him out of mourning and took the place of Mumtaz at court."}

It uses predicates to express the state of certain things, which are \"incomplete propositions\" with a placeholder for objects or subjects that must be inserted in order to obtain a valid proposition. \nPredicate logic is different from propositional logic, in part because it has the concept of \"quantifiers\". A quantifier is used in conjunction with a variable (say \"x\") in order to talk about a general instance of x, and in doing so, this allows predicate logic to make statements about quantity.\nThe best-known quantifiers are the \"existential quantifier\", represented by \u2203, and the \"universal quantifier\", represented by \u2200. The existential quantifier is used to express statements of the form \"there exists\", and is true precisely when there is at least one mathematical object from the universe of discourse that matches the predicate or formula. On the other hand, the universal quantifier is used to express statements of the form \"for all\", and is true precisely when all possible mathematical objects of the universe of discourse match the specified predicate or formula.\nIn the notation of predicate logic, quantifiers directly precede (and thus introduce) variable names, which are then followed by other quantifiers or mathematical expressions, where the said variables are found. For example. one can use the expression formula_1 to mean \"there is a person \"x\" such that for all persons \"y\", y likes x\" (\"someone is liked by everyone.\").\nExamples.\nformula_2\ncan be read as: \"There is at least one cat which is black, and which likes (one or more) dogs.\"\nformula_3\ncan be read as: \"It is not true that every cat doesn't like any dog.\"\nformula_4\ncan be read as: \"There does not exist a cat which is also a dog.\""}

He is at the White House and attempts to kill the president. At the last moment, a security guard shoots Nightcrawler, forcing him to run away. Meanwhile, Wolverine reaches a location called Alkali Lake, and does not find anything. He returns to Charles Xavier's school for gifted students.\nWilliam Stryker, who hates mutants, uses this attack. He talks to the President, who then allows him to raid Charles Xavier's school for gifted mutants. Before he does this, he visits Magneto. Magneto was the bad guy in the first movie and now is in jail. Stryker uses a fluid to make him talk about the school.\nXavier attempts to find Nightcrawler. He uses a machine called Cerebo, which makes his power stronger and allows him to connect to every person's mind. He gives Jean Grey and Storm the last location where he could see Nightcrawler. They leave in the Blackbird. Then, he and Cyclops go to the prison to pay a visit to Magneto.\nStryker raids the mansion. A mutant named Siryn, whose power is a very loud scream, alerts everyone. A series of passageways and escape tunnels allow all but six of the mutants to escape. Wolverine, who has returned, takes Rogue, Iceman, and Pyro with him into a car. They drive to Boston. Meanwhile, Storm and Jean have located Nightcrawler and have him on their ship. Stryker also takes Cerebro with them. At the prison, Stryker has captured Xavier and Cyclops.\nAt Alkali Lake, Stryker reveals his plan. He has rebuilt Cerebro. He uses his son Jason, a mutant, to create a fantasy world for Xavier. In Xavier's mind, he sees a little girl who thinks that everyone is gone. Xavier goes to his Cerebro, locates everyone, and then starts to focus, which will kill all mutants.\nIn Boston, Wolverine and his friends go to Iceman's house, where Iceman reveals that he is a mutant. Iceman's brother does not like this and calls the cops. One cop shoots Wolverine in the head. Pyro uses his power \u2013 he can control fire \u2013 and pushes the police away. Wolverine, whose power is to heal very fast, wakes up. Jean and Storm come in and pick them up.\nMystique has found out where Magneto was staying. She seduces the security guard and injects him with iron. When the security guard comes in, Magneto senses the iron. Magneto can control all metal. Magneto rips it out of the guard and escapes.\nThe United States Air Force sends two jets to intercept the Blackbird, the plane where all the X-Men are on. Storm, whose power is to control the weather, whips up a tornado that sends both pilots down, but one manages to fire two missiles. Jean Grey, whose power is psychic, manages to destroy one, but the other one hits the jet. They start to go down. Magneto is in the area and saves them.\nThe X-Men and Magneto make some peace and come together to beat Stryker. The dam is built so that Stryker can flood the tunnel if someone comes in. 15 years ago, Wolverine volunteered for an experiment and was given claws and suffered a lot of pain. Stryker is very interested in Wolverine. So Mystique, whose power is to make herself look like other people, pretends to be Wolverine. She gets in and takes over the control room.\nCyclops appears and attacks Magneto, Mystique, and Jean Grey. Jean uses her psychic power to stop Cyclops, but Cyclops' beam power damages the dam very badly. Wolverine leaves to find Stryker. Stryker shows him Lady Deathstrike, who also has an adamantium skeleton and claws on the tips of her fingers. They fight. Wolverine pumps her full of adamantium and kills her. Storm and Nightcrawler find the six mutants and rescue them.\nAll mutants suddenly go into pain when Xavier starts focusing. Magneto forces himself into Cerebro and stops it. He then tells Mystique to transform into Stryker and change the rules so that Xavier will kill all the humans instead. The X-Men find out what is happening. Storm and Nightcrawler teleport in there. Storm creates a storm that breaks the spell, and Xavier returns to normal.\nAll of the X-Men escape the dam. Rogue and Iceman, who were in the Blackbird, land it in front of them. The plane is badly damaged. The dam explodes and a ton of water comes down. At the last second, Jean Grey rushes out of the ship, gets it into the air, and drowns when she can no longer hold back the water. Xavier and his crew go to the White House to inform the President of what has happened. Xavier tells the president that humans and mutants must work together or else they will destroy each other in war."}

It was used a lot between about 1830 and 1970. Afterwards, diesel and electric locomotives were used more often. The first steam locomotive was made by Richard Trevithick for a railway used for moving iron at an Ironworks in Wales. A steam locomotive works by burning a fuel like coal in a special space called a firebox. This produces hot gases that rise and go through tubes in a boiler - a large space with water in it. This heats the water, producing steam. The steam is then taken through another tube to a cylinder. The steam then pushes the piston which in turn pushes a metal rod that is connected to the wheels, making the locomotive move. The steam then rises out through the chimney.\nSteam locomotives are still today used in many developing countries where the railways have not yet been electrified."}

After Germany threatened an invasion of the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia, the British and French prime ministers tried to get Hitler to agree not to use his military in the future in return for taking the land, including the Rhineland and others. After Hitler agreed, most people thought the agreement was a success, but Hitler invaded the rest of Czechoslovakia in 1939. Later that year, the Second World War started.\nBackground.\nCzechoslovakia was an independent country in 1938. It was formed in 1918 after the First World War with international agreement. Hitler wanted \"Lebensraum\" (meaning \"living space\"), which would have all Germans in Czechoslovakia united with Germany. As most German-speakers in Czechoslovakia were in the Sudetenland, Hitler set his sights there first. He knew that most of the industrial strength of Czechoslovakia would be lost with the Sudetenland leaving Czechoslovakia. Britain, France and the Soviet Union had all agreed to support Czechoslovakia if it was invaded.\nCrisis.\nOn September 12, 1938, Hitler told the Sudeten Germans that he would support them. On the 15th, Chamberlain met with Hitler in a last ditch-attempt to avert war. Hitler moderated his demands and said he was interested only in parts of Czechoslovakia. Chamberlain thought that to be reasonable and that Hitler would be satisfied. However, on the 22nd, Hitler changed his demands and now said that he wanted the whole of the Sudetenland. The British Navy mobilised. and war seemed imminent. \nMussolini persuaded Hitler to attend a four power peace conference in Munich on the 29th September. The conference was held between four leaders, Hitler for Germany, Mussolini for Italy, Chamberlain for Britain, and Daladier for France. The Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia were not invited. \nAt the conference Mussolini put forward a plan (really written by the German Foreign Office) that the Sudetenland was to become part of Germany immediately. The German army was to march into the Sudetenland the following day and claim it as German territory. Britain and France agreed, Czechoslovakia was not even consulted and the USSR was horrified. Chamberlain returned to Britain to receive a hero's welcome as he had achieved \"peace for our time\" with his policy. \nEdvard Bene\u0161, the Czechoslovak president, resigned. He felt betrayed after Britain and France's promises to help Czechs.

Strikes are usually done by a labor union to get better pay, hours, or working conditions. They became important during the Industrial Revolution, when many worked in factories and mines. In many countries, it is against the law to strike. In other countries, people who strike are protected under certain conditions.\nStrikes generally take the form of a picket line. The workers walk in front of where they work, chanting and holding signs. Workers on strike usually do not stop people from crossing the picket line. However, some people will not cross a picket line to buy something from the company. This is a way of showing solidarity (or support) for the union. Most unions will also not cross a picket line and do business with companies on strike. For example, members of the Teamsters, a truck driving union, will not deliver to a business that is on strike. \nHistory.\nThe first known strike was in the 12th century B.C., in Egypt. Workers under Ramses III stopped working on the Necropolis until they were treated better. The word gets its name from modern times: in 1768, sailors in London \"struck\" or removed the sails of trade ships at port. \nIn 1917, the Mexican Constitution was the first to make sure that workers had the right to strike.\nTypes of strikes.\nWildcat strike.\nA wildcdat strike is a strike that is not approved by the labor union. Wildcat strikes are not always protected like union-approved strikes are. \nSympathy strike.\nA sympathy strike is a strike that is done to support another group of workers on strike. \nSlowdown strike.\nA slowdown strike is when the workers are still working, but very slowly. It is usually done when workers are not allowed to have a full strike.\nGreen ban.\nA green ban is a strike that is done to get the company to adopt more environmentally friendly practices.\nStrikes in the law.\nDespites, International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights ensure the right to strike, many countries do not allow workers to strike at all, but some allow it under certain conditions.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, people who work for the Federal Government are not allowed to strike. Some states, like New York, do not allow people who work for the state government (including teachers) to strike. Railroad and airline workers are not allowed to strike, except under certain conditions.\nStrike breaking.\nWhen a strike is called, a government may try to stop it by calling in the police or the military. The threat of force is sometimes enough to get the workers to stop. This happened in the Seattle General Strike of 1919, when over three thousand marines, sailors, and police officers were called into the city by the mayor of Seattle and the Attorney General of Washington.\nThe owners of a company may also decide to hire new workers. This may cost less than giving into the demands of the workers. This is another way of breaking the strike. These workers, called \"scabs\" by strikers, are often yelled at as they pass through the picket line. Many unions say that workers who helped break a strike by crossing the picket line are not allowed to be in the union. If the company is a union shop (meaning that only union workers can work there) this means that helping break a strike could get a worker fired from that company forever."}

To do this, birds use wings with light, hollow bones and feathers on them. Birds have a streamlined body shape, so that they slip through air more easily.\nBirds can move by flapping their wings, or they can stay in the same place. This is called hovering, with rapid wing beats, as with the kestrel. Birds that soar use very little energy for it: they use columns of rising hot air to lift them. They glide from the top of a warm air current, and then move on to another warm air current. That way birds like buzzards can fly all day while using little energy.\nBirds like hawks and gannets dive on their prey. They get to a height, them fold their wings and dive head-first.\nLift.\nThe fundamentals of bird flight are similar to those of aircraft. Lift force is produced by the action of air flow on the wing, which is an airfoil. The lift force occurs because the air has a lower pressure just above the wing and higher pressure below."}

The album had guest appearances from his Nickel Creek bandmates as well as Stuart Duncan, B\u00e9la Fleck, Edgar Meyer, Jerry Douglas, and Bryan Sutton.\nIn 2003, Thile and mandolinist Mike Marshall made a duet album called \"Into the Cauldron,\" which had covers by artists from Charlie Parker to Bach. The next year, Thile released \"Deceiver\", a pop album on which he played and wrote every song himself. He mainly played his mandolin on the album, but also played electric guitar, piano, drums, violin, viola, cello, and bass.\n2006\u2013present: Punch Brothers.\nIn August 2006, Nickel Creek announced in \"Billboard\" and on their official website that they would take an \"indefinite hiatus\", which means a break for an unknown amount of time.\nJust before this, Thile formed the How to Grow a Band. He made \"How to Grow a Woman from the Ground\", with them. This was Thile's fifth album. In an interview with the \"Nashville City Paper\", Thile talked about the band's start: \nThe band's members are Thile (mandolin), Gabe Witcher (fiddle), Chris Eldridge (guitar), Greg Garrison (bass), and Noam Pikelny (banjo). Bryan Sutton also played guitar for the band when Chris Eldridge could not. In 2007, the band changed its name twice: first to \"The Tensions Mountain Boys\" and then \"Punch Brothers.\"\nPunch Brothers released their first album, \"Punch\", on the Nonesuch Records on February 26, 2008.

It can develop when people are severely harmed, or experience something extremely upsetting.\nPTSD is different from traumatic stress, which is less intense and shorter, and combat stress reaction, which happens to soldiers in wartime situations and usually goes away. PTSD has been recognized in the past by different names, like shell shock, traumatic war neurosis, or post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSS).\nThroughout history, there have been many accounts of people experiencing symptoms of what is now called PTSD. One such account describes Samuel Pepys, who witnessed the Great Fire of London in 1666. \"Six months after the event, he wrote in his diary that he was unable to sleep at night, because a great fear of fire took him; one night he was unable to fall asleep before two in the morning, because of that fear.\"\nPrevalence.\nBetween 50% and 90% of people in the United States will experience a trauma at least once in their life. However, not everyone who experiences a trauma will develop PTSD. In the US, the prevalence of PTSD - the percentage of people who have the condition - is about 8%. \nPTSD is more common among specific groups of people who are more likely to experience a trauma. These groups include physicians, firefighters, soldiers and people working in emergency medical services. Among these people, the prevalence of PTSD is much higher, reaching over 50%.\nDiagnosis.\nFor PTSD to be diagnosed officially, a person has to meet specific criteria, or requirements, and show specific symptoms. These requirements are listed in the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV-TR\" (usually called the DSM-IV-TR). Written by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), the DSM-IV-TR (DSM, 4th Edition, Text Revision) lists all of the mental health conditions that are recognized by the APA, and sets out the official requirements that have to be met for each condition to be diagnosed.\nAccording to the DSM-IV-TR, for PTSD to be diagnosed, a person has to meet the following requirements:\n(A) Traumatic Exposure: The person has experienced a traumatic event. (Common traumatic events include being raped or sexually abused; being attacked or badly hurt; having a loved one die or be hurt; being a victim of a crime; and experiencing war or terrorism.) The traumatic event caused the person to be physically hurt or violated, or it put the person or others around them in danger of being hurt or killed. During the traumatic event, the person felt very scared, horrified, or helpless.\n(B) Re-experiencing: Even after the trauma has ended, the person continues to re-experience the trauma in some way. For example, the person might have nightmares, or flashbacks (strong memories of the trauma, which are so vivid and intense that the person feels like they are experiencing the trauma all over again). The person might also have a strong physical or emotional reaction when something happens which reminds them of the trauma.\n(C) Avoidance/Numbing: The person keeps trying to avoid things which remind them of the trauma, or things which bring up upsetting feelings about what happened. They might also forget parts of what happened to them, or might feel numb emotionally (have trouble feeling emotions as strongly as usual).\n(D) Increased Arousal: The person's body shows signs of being on high alert, like it is always under attack. They might be jumpy, or have trouble with sleeping, concentrating, or feeling angry.\n(E) The person's symptoms have lasted for at least a month. (If the person's symptoms have lasted for less than a month, Acute Stress Disorder is usually diagnosed instead of PTSD).\n(F) The person's symptoms causes them to have trouble at work, in his relationships, or in some other important area of their life.\nOther conditions like PTSD.\nSome experts have written that fabricated posttraumatic stress disorder should be considered when a patient's symptoms are suspicious or unusual. These experts (specifically, the \"American Psychiatric Association\" DSM IV manual; expert witnesses such as Eli S. Chesen, M.D.; and the textbook \"Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry,\" by Freedman &amp; Kaplan) have suggested that it should raise a \"red flag\" if a patient claims to be suffering from both PTSD and a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) as a result of the same accident. They suggest that TBI - a physical injury to the brain - causes amnesia, or memory loss, for the event that caused the brain injury. Without memory of the traumatic event, they reason, a patient probably could not experience certain symptoms of PTSD, like nightmares or flashbacks about the event, because they do not remember what happened. They conclude that in typical cases, Traumatic Brain Injury \"trumps\" the diagnosis of PTSD."}

It is a metaphor, as are the phrases \"struggle for existence\", and \"natural selection\", both of which were used by Charles Darwin. Scientists often use such metaphors as shorthand for key ideas. These metaphors stick in the mind, but they need to be properly understood, or they may be used wrongly.\nSpencer invented the phrase.\nHerbert Spencer was a British social philosopher who applied his personal conception of evolution to many other fields, from the origin of the solar system to economics. He first used the term in his book \"Principles of Biology\", published in 1864. In that book (vol 1 p444) he wrote: \"This survival of the fittest, which I have here sought to express in mechanical terms, is that which Mr. Darwin has called \u2018natural selection\u2019, or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life\".\nSpencer later published a book called \"The Man versus the State\". There, he used the phrase to explain why societies of a militant type would not adopt his theories. The way he uses the term suggests he is talking about a general principle.\nThus by survival of the fittest, the militant type of society becomes characterized by profound confidence in the governing power, joined with a loyalty causing submission to it in all matters whatever.\nDarwin using the phrase.\nIn the first four editions of \"On the Origin of Species\", Darwin used only the phrase \"natural selection\". It was his way of making an analogy with artificial selection (selective breeding), a practice which was well understood in England at that time.\nSpencer's \"Principles of Biology\" was the first to use the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" in print. Darwin agreed that the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" was better than \"natural selection\". Natural selection personified nature, but was really about survival. \"Survival of the fittest\" would avoid this problem, but it \"lost the analogy between nature's selection and the fanciers\" (breeders). The phrase was first used by Darwin in the 5th edition of \"The Origin\" published in 1869, in which Chapter 4 describes \"Natural Selection, or the Survival of the Fittest\".\nIn the introduction to the 5th edition Darwin gave full credit to Spencer, writing \"I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term Natural Selection, in order to mark its relation to man's power of selection. But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer of the Survival of the Fittest is more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient\".\nSo did Wallace.\nThe co-discoverer of natural selection, Alfred Russel Wallace, also used the terms \"survival of the fittest\" and \"struggle for existence\". He rather preferred the last two terms to natural selection. Since both these evolutionists used them, the three metaphors were obviously useful in getting over what were, at the time, unfamiliar ideas.\nCurrent use of the phrase.\nThe phrase \"survival of the fittest\" is shorthand for the fact that not all members of a species will contribute equally to the next generation. It is not a value judgement, but a concept of evolution equivalent to natural selection. Fitness is now used in a highly technical sense in population genetics, which should not be confused with its use in everyday language.\nToday, the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" is widely used in popular literature for many topics, not just those related to biology. It has widely been used both by people who are in favour of Social Darwinism and those who are against it. It has also been used to talk about competition of all kinds. Popular literature often uses the phrase as a catchphrase. All such extensions of a metaphor need to be watched carefully. They may preserve the original meaning, or they may not."}
{"id": "115289", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=115289", "title": "Social responses to the idea of evolution", "text": "Evolution was an idea debated before Charles Darwin published \"On the Origin of Species\". In very broad terms, this idea says that species change over time. Even today, some people still talk about the concept of evolution and what it means to them, to their philosophy and their religion. Sometimes these people also talk about the social implications of evolution. This debate is mostly about the meaning of evolution to human life, or about human nature, not about how evolution works.\nDebates about the fact of evolution.\nSome people believe in \"guided evolution\" or \"theistic evolution\". They say that evolution is real, but it is being guided it some way.\nThere are many different concepts of \"theistic evolution\". Many creationists believe that the creation myth found in their religion goes against the idea of evolution. As Darwin found out early on, the most controversial part of the evolutionary thought is its implications for human origins.\nIn some countries, especially in the United States, there is tension between people who accept the idea of evolution and those who reject it. The debate is mostly about if the ideas in evolution should be taught in schools, and in what way.\nOther fields, like cosmology and earth science also do not match with the original writings of many religious texts. These ideas were once also fiercely opposed. Death for heresy was threatened to those who wrote against the idea that the Earth was the centre of the universe. Giordano Bruno was burnt at the stake by the Holy Inquisition for teaching that the Earth moved around the Sun (and other ideas).\nEvolutionary biology is opposed much more from religious believers than other groups or organizations.\nThe Roman Catholic Church now has a neutral position with regards to evolution. Pope Pius XII stated in his encyclical \"Humani Generis\" published in the 1950s:\nPope John Paul II updated this position in 1996. He said that Evolution was \"more than a hypothesis\":\nThe Anglican Communion also does not oppose the scientific account of evolution.\nUsing evolution for other purposes.\nMany of those who accepted evolution were not much interested in biology. They were interested in using the theory to support their own ideas on society.\nRacism.\nIn the Bible, for instance, after Noah's Ark landed, there is a passage that describes how Noah got drunk while naked and Ham laughed at him. Noah cursed Ham, which somehow became part of a justification for racism and slavery.\nLater, people also tried to use evolution to support racism. Evolution itself is not about racism. However, people wanting to justify racism claimed that black people were inferior. They said that because evolution shows that, in nature, \"better\" animals tend to survive, leading to evolution of improved animals, they had the right to oppress the \"weaker\". They believed they were clearly \"better\", but that would need evidence. There is no agreed evidence that any race of humans is better than any other race.\nEugenics.\nThe idea of eugenics was rather different. Two things had been noticed as far back as the 18th century. One was the great success of farmers in breeding cattle and crop plants. They did this by selecting which animals or plants would produce the next generation (artificial selection). The other observation was that lower class people had more children than upper-class people. If (and it's a big if) the higher classes were there on \"merit\", then their lack of children was the exact reverse of what should be happening. Faster breeding in the lower classes would lead to the society getting worse.\nThe idea to improve the human species by selective breeding is called eugenics. The name was proposed by Francis Galton, a bright scientist who meant to do good. Today, Galton is remembered for many things he did in statistics and psychology. He was the first to use regression analysis to see how different things that depend on one another influence one another. He used fingerprints in forensic science. He is seen as the father of experimental psychology, together with Wilhelm Wundt. He developed the bean machine to show probability distributions, among other things.\nGalton's ideas were meant to do good. He said that the human gene pool should be improved by selective breeding policies. This would mean that those who were considered \"good stock\" would receive a reward if they reproduced. However, other people added to this, and said those considered \"bad stock\" would need to undergo compulsory sterilization, prenatal testing and birth control; and they might even have to be killed.\nThe problem with Galton's idea is how to decide which features to select. There's so many different skills people could have, you could not agree who was \"good stock\" and who was \"bad stock\". There was rather more agreement on who should \"not\" be breeding. Several countries passed laws for the compulsory sterilisation of unwelcome groups. Most of these laws were passed during between 1900 and 1940. After World War II, disgust at what the Nazis had done lowered public support for forced eugenics.\nSocial Darwinism.\nAnother example of using wrong ideas about evolution to support bad things is \"Social Darwinism\". Social Darwinism is a term given to the ideas of the 19th century British social philosopher Herbert Spencer. Spencer had ideas about \"survival of the fittest\", which he applied to commerce and human societies as a whole.\nOther people used these ideas to claim that social differences, racism, and imperialism were justified. Today, most scientists and philosophers say that the theory of evolution should not be used to support such ideas. They also say that it is difficult to find data that can support them.\nControversy.\nCertain people oppose the idea of evolution. They disagree with it for a number of reasons. Most often these reasons are influenced by their religious beliefs. Their beliefs are usually called creationism or intelligent design.\nDespite this, evolution is one of the most successful theories in science. People have found it to be useful for different kinds of research. None of the other proposals explain things, such as fossil records, as well. So, for almost all scientists, evolution is not in doubt."}

Charles Darwin was one of the main proponents of evolution. Evolution is a concept from biology that tries to explain how different life-forms change over time. It basically says that because most children are not exactly like their parents, there is change. Some of the children will have different features (or traits). These features will mean that some children are better adapted to the place where they live. They will therefore be better able to have offspring. Some of the offspring might also have the trait of their parents.\nSocial Darwinism theories try to use these ideas from biology for human society. They talk about a \"Struggle for survival\" of human societies. During the era of Nazi ideologies, the idea of Survival of the fittest combined with racism. They claimed the Aryan race was better than all the other races and therefore needed more space to live. This space was to be provided in the east (where mostly Slavs lived). \nToday, this is seen as badly named. Most of the ideas for the theories are from Lamarckism and not from the theory of evolution, proposed by Charles Darwin.\nAlthough Darwin's idea was revered in most of the western societies, many Russian intellectuals did not accept his ideas. They feared that accepting Darwin's ideas would harm their morality. One of Darwin's biggest critic was Leo Tolstoy, who felt strongly against what he thought was Darwin's idea. In a letter from his death bed, he warned his children not to take Darwin's struggle for existence as a moral guide. Darwin never suggested his ideas were a basis for human life, just a description of what had happened in evolution."}

Evolution tries to explain how species change over time. Today, the only widely accepted theory of evolution is that developed from the ideas of Charles Darwin.\nLamarckism was developed by Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck. He based his ideas, to some extent, on those of Erasmus Darwin, the grandfather of Charles Darwin. Lamarckism says that individuals do not only pass on the things they received from their parents, but also some things they experienced during their lifetime. As an example, he cited giraffes. Giraffes, which have long necks, must have evolved from ancestors with much shorter necks. His idea was that adults needed to stretch their neck to reach leaves from high branches. Therefore, he thought, the children inherited longer necks. This idea is called \"the inheritance of acquired characteristics\".\nAlthough Darwin did not entirely break with these ideas, his characteristic idea of natural selection relates to the individuals's relative survival and success in reproduction. Better adapted forms leave, on average, more offspring. This changes the proportion of alleles in the population. \nGregor Mendel discovered some basic rules of heredity. These rules of Mendelian inheritance contradict Lamarck's hypotheses entirely, but are consistent with natural selection. This explains why Lamarck's ideas are no longer regarded as a sound explanation of evolution. Where Lamarck and Darwin do agree is that evolution did take place.\nLamarck's theory.\nThe identification of \"Lamarckism\" with the inheritance of acquired characteristics alone is regarded by some as an over-simplification, rehashed in textbooks repeatedly. Stephen Jay Gould wrote that late 19th century evolutionists \"re-read Lamarck, cast aside the guts of it... and elevated one aspect of the mechanics \u2013 inheritance of acquired characters \u2013 to a central focus it never had for Lamarck himself\". He argued that \"the restriction of Lamarckism to this relatively small and non-distinctive corner of Lamarck's thought must be labelled as more than a misnomer, and truly a discredit to the memory of a man and his much more comprehensive system\". Gould advocated defining \"Lamarckism\" more broadly, in line with Lamarck's overall evolutionary theory.\nHowever, as scientist historians such as Michael Ghiselin and Stephen Jay Gould have pointed out, none of these views were original to Lamarck. On the contrary, Lamarck's contribution was a systematic theoretical framework for understanding evolution. He saw evolution as comprising two processes;\nIn essence, a change in the environment brings about a change in needs (\"besoins\"), resulting in a change in behavior, bringing change in organ usage and development, bringing change in form over time \u2014 and thus the gradual transmutation (change) of the species. \nThe modern point of view is that neither of his two 'forces' exists; Lamarck can be credited with the first fully worked-out account of evolution. However, his ideas of how it came about are entirely mistaken."}

Malthus was an economist who lived during the industrial revolution.\nIn 1798, Mathus published a book, called \"An Essay on the Principle of Population\". In it, he describes the Malthusian growth model. He wrote that the growth of the population is exponential. The growth of the food supply however is only arithmetical. This means if there are no limits to the growth of the population, that it will not be possible to produce food for all of them. This is known as Malthusian catastrophe. Malthus wrote during the time of the Manchester School of thought.\nThe Tory party had paternalistic ideas such as charity for the poor. Malthus said this would not work, and it would only lead to increased numbers of the poor. The theory was developed into Whig economic ideas such as The Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834. Its opponents described the act as \"a Malthusian bill designed to force the poor to emigrate, to work for lower wages, to live on a coarser sort of food\". The act brought the construction of workhouses despite riots and arson.\nBy that time the ideas were widespread in progressive social circles. One supporter was the novelist Harriet Martineau whose circle of acquaintances included Charles Darwin. The ideas of Malthus were a significant influence on the inception of Darwin's theory.\nAccording to Dr. Dan Ritschel of the Center for History Education at the University of Maryland, The great Malthusian dread was that \"indiscriminate charity\" would lead to exponential growth in the population in poverty, increased charges to the public purse to support this growing army of the dependent, and, eventually, the catastrophe of national bankruptcy. Though Malthusianism has since come to be identified with the issue of general over-population, the original Malthusian concern was more specifically with the fear of over-population by the dependent poor!\nOne of the earliest critics of Malthusian theory was Karl Marx who referred (in \"Capital\", see Marx's footnote on Malthus from Capital - a reference below) to it as \"nothing more than a schoolboyish, superficial plagiary of De Foe, Sir James Steuart, Townsend, Franklin, Wallace\" and others, postulating that progress in science and technology would allow for indefinite exponential population growth.\nMany people today still believe that Mathus was right about human population growth getting out of hand."}

He was knighted in 1909.\nGalton produced over 340 papers and books in his lifetime. He created the statistical concepts of normal distribution, correlation and regression toward the mean. He was the first to apply statistical methods to the study of human differences and inheritance of intelligence. \nHe was the first person to do twin studies.

Unfortunately, though he knew about monozygotic (identical twins) and dizygotic twins, he did not appreciate the real genetic difference. Twin studies of the modern kind did not appear until the 1920s.\nHe also introduced the use of questionnaires and surveys to collect data on human communities. He needed such data for genealogical and biographical works and for his anthropometric studies. He was a pioneer in eugenics, coining the very term itself and the phrase \"nature versus nurture\". As an investigator of the human mind, he founded psychometrics (the science of measuring mental faculties) and differential psychology. \nGalton created a method for classifying fingerprints that proved useful in forensic science.

He saw evolution as the progressive development of the physical world, biological organisms, the human mind, and human culture and societies. \nSpencer never married; he remained a bachelor. He contributed to a wide range of subjects, including ethics, religion, politics, philosophy, biology, sociology, and psychology.\nLike Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, he read Malthus' \"Essay on the principle of population\", and was deeply impressed by its argument. Malthus said that sooner or later population growth gets checked by famine and disease, and there are then many deaths. So, he was prepared for Darwin's idea of natural selection, which he preferred to call \"survival of the fittest\". He did this in \"Principles of Biology\" (1864), after reading Charles Darwin's \"On the Origin of Species\".\nSpencer's term does strongly suggest natural selection, yet as he extended evolution into realms of sociology and ethics, Spencer made use of Lamarckism rather than natural selection, so it seems he was not a Darwinian after all. Others took up his social ideas, and drew the conclusion that it was useless to try and help the poor, and that competition without limits was the way society should go. Darwin himself did not accept these ideas, but they were quite widespread in the United States at the end of the nineteenth century."}

Species whose lives connect, evolve together. What happens is that survival rates in each species changes as a result of changes in the other species.\nExamples of coevolution are:\nCoevolution is extremely common, and may involve more than two species. Mimicry rings, with dozens of species, are known.\nNew or 'improved' adaptations which occur in one species are often followed by the appearance and spread of related features in the other species.\nHistory.\nThe study of coevolution dates back to Darwin's \"On the Origin of Species\". There he discussed how cats increased heather by reducing mice. The point being that mice raid bumblebee nests and bumblebees pollinate red heather. So more cats cause more heather.p74 In the last paragraph of the Origin Darwin remarks:\nHermann M\u00fcller was an important worker on co-evolution. His studies on bees and the evolution of flowers were quoted by Darwin in \"The Descent of Man\". His papers in the journal \"Nature\" had heading \"On the fertilisation of flowers by insects and on the reciprocal adaptations of both\". This shows M\u00fcller fully understood the concept of coevolution.\nPollination.\nThe life and death of living things is intimately connected, not just with the physical environment, but with the life of other species. These relationships are dynamic, and may continue for millions of years, as has the relationship between flowering plants and insects (pollination).&lt;br&gt;The gut contents, wing structures, and mouthparts of fossilized beetles and flies suggest that they acted as early pollinators. The association between beetles and angiosperms during the Lower Cretaceous period led to parallel radiations of angiosperms and insects into the late Cretaceous. The evolution of nectaries in Upper Cretaceous flowers signals the beginning of the mutualism between hymenopterans and angiosperms.\nParasitism.\nAnother good example is malaria, in which there are three 'partners': the mosquito, the parasite \"Plasmodium\", and a land vertebrate, such as a mammal or bird. The actual species of malaria differs according to the vertebrate, so there are actually thousands of different relationships which follow the same pattern.\nRapid speciation.\nAdaptive radiation and speciation rates can be high in parasites. Sibling species are very common in the bug \"Erythroneura\", in which about 150 transfers from one host to another has resulted in about 500 species in the genus.\nThe clearest evidence comes from the large size of many parasitic families. \nA huge number of species are parasitic. A survey of the feeding habits of British insects showed that about 35% were parasites on plants, and slightly more were parasites on animals. That means that nearly 71% of insects in Britain are parasitic. Since British insects are better known than those elsewhere (because of the length of time they have been studied), this means that by far the majority of insect species throughout the world are parasitic. Another estimate went:p3\nThere are several other invertebrate phyla which are wholly or largely parasitic. Flatworms and roundworms are found in virtually every wild species of vertebrate. Protozoan parasites are also ubiquitous. Hence parasitism is almost certainly the most common feeding method on Earth.\nNumbers of species.\nRecent publications have given an overview of the 150 years of research into co-evolution after the \"Origin of species\".\nMany species are parasites or are specialised to live in one or a few hosts. A single species of tropical tree is, on average, a host to 162 host-specific beetle species. Since there are 50,000 tropical tree species, and beetles amount to 40% of total insect species, and there are also tree-specific species below the canopy, it is possible to estimate the total number of arthropod species living in tropical forests. The number is 30 million. This contrasts rather strongly with the total of 1.4 to 1.8 million species which have already been described. It seems textbooks have underestimated the number of species in existence by a factor of about 20.\nThe single factor which most causes this high number of species is phytophagy: the huge number of insect species, each eating one or a few plant species. And what insects do, so do fungi, nematodes, mites and other invertebrates.\nGeographic mosaic.\nThe geographic mosaic theory of coevolution was developed by John N Thompson as a framework for envisioning the coevolutionary process in real populations and species. It has been an attempt to incorporate the minimum components of population biology needed for an ecologically and evolutionarily realistic theory of coevolution and evolving interactions in general. It applies to pairs of interacting species, small groups of interacting species, and large webs of interactions. \nAssumptions: Geographic mosaic theory is based on several observations long known to biologists. These observation are taken as assumptions in the development of geographic mosaic theory:\n1. Species are often collections of genetically distinct populations\n2. Interacting species often differ in their geographic ranges\n3. interactions among species differ among environments in their ecological outcomes.\nThe Hypothesis: From these assumptions, geographic mosaic theory argues that coevolution proceeds by natural selection acting on three sources of variation that affect interactions among species. These three sources of variation can be formally partitioned as genotype by genotype by environment interactions (GxGxE).\n1. Geographic selection mosaics: The \"structure of natural selection\" on interactions differs among environments (e.g., high vs. low temperatures, high vs. low nutrient conditions; a surrounding species web that is species-rich vs. species poor). This variation occurs because genes are expressed in different ways in different environments (GxE interactions) and species affect each other's fitness in different ways in different environments. \nFor example, \u00a0an interaction may be antagonistic in one environment and mutualistic in another environment; or it may be antagonistic in all environments but selection may favor different traits in different environments).\n2. Coevolutionary hotspots: The i\"ntensity of reciprocal selection\" differs among environments. Interactions are subject to reciprocal selection only within some local communities, called coevolutionary hotspots. These coevolutionary hotspots are embedded in a broader matrix of coevolutionary coldspots, where local natural selection is non-reciprocal or where only one of the participants occurs.\nFor example, an interaction may be mutualistic or antagonistic in some environments (coevolutionary hotspots) but commensalistic in other environments (coevolutionary coldspots).\n3. Trait remixing: The overall genetic structure of coevolving species continually changes through new mutations, genomic alterations, gene flow among populations, differential random genetic drift among populations, and extinction of local populations that differ in the combinations of coevolving traits they harbor. New genetic material on which natural selection can act can result from simple genetic mutations, chromosomal rearrangements, hybridization between populations, or whole genome duplications (polypoloidy). These processes contribute to the shifting geographic mosaic of coevolution by continually altering the spatial distributions of potentially coevolving genes and traits.\nThe combination of these processes continually changes the distribution of genotypes within any local population and the distribution of genotypes among populations.\nNOTE: Some descriptions of geographic mosaic theory collapse this \u201ctrait remixing\u201d part of geographic mosaic theory to gene flow. That is an incorrect characterization. The point of trait remixing is that through a combination of genetic, genomic, and ecological processes, the available distribution of coevolving traits on which natural selection can act continues to change over time within and among populations.\nIn studies of coevolution, a GxGxE interaction can be viewed either in the most formal way at the gene or genotype level (i.e., how selection acts on the same gene or genotype in across contrasting environments), or it can be viewed more generally at the level of how natural selection acts on two or more interacting species across many contrasting environments. \nSee books by John N Thompson (1982 Interaction and Coevolution; 1994 The Coevolutionary Process; 2005 The Geographic Mosaic of Coevolution; 2013 Relentless Evolution)"}

For some, this means the origin of species. For others, it means the large-scale changes seen in the fossil record. \nIt is a term of convenience: for most biologists it does \"not\" suggest any change in the process of evolution. For a few palaeontologists, some things they see in the fossil record cannot be explained just by the gradualist evolutionary synthesis. They are in the minority. There are some interesting discussions by other palaeontologists.\nSome biologists use the term for evolution in already separated gene pools. For them, macroevolutionary studies focus on change that occurs at or above the level of species. Again, this is a minority position. Most biologist would not call evolution at the species level \"macroevolution\".\nMicroevolution, on the other hand, refers to smaller evolutionary changes \"within\" species or populations. During microevolution changes in allele frequencies definitely do occur. Some biologists, Richard Dawkins in particular, have suggested that the gene is the object of selection. This was always challenged by Ernst Mayr \"The individual is the entity which survives or not, which reproduces or not, and which reproduces successfully or not\". Changes in gene frequency in populations is a by-product of what happens to individuals.\nRelation of macroevolution to microevolution.\nPaleontology, evolutionary developmental biology, and sequence analysis contribute much evidence for the patterns and processes that can be classified as macroevolution. An example of macroevolution is the appearance of feathers during the evolution of birds from one group of dinosaurs.\nWithin the modern evolutionary synthesis school of thought, macroevolution is thought of as the compounded effects of microevolution. Thus, the distinction between micro- and macroevolution is not a fundamental one \u2013 the only difference between them is of time and scale.\nSome creationists have also adopted the term 'macroevolution' to describe the form of evolution they reject. They may accept that evolutionary change is possible within species (microevolution), but deny that one species can evolve into another (macroevolution). These arguments are rejected by biologists, who hold that there is ample evidence that macroevolution has occurred in the past.\nResearch topics.\nSome examples of subjects whose study falls within the realm of macroevolution:\nOrigin of the term.\nRussian entomologist Yuri Filipchenko (or Philipchenko, depending on the transliteration) first coined the terms 'macroevolution' and 'microevolution' in 1927 in his German language work, \"Variabilit\u00e4t und Variatio\".\nSince then, their meanings have been revised several times and fallen into disfavour with many, who prefer to speak of biological evolution as one process.\nCriticisms of macroevolution.\nEvolution as a whole is strongly supported by many kinds of evidence.\nThe issue for biologists is whether there is any sense in having the special term \"macroevolution\". The answer is yes for a few biologists who proposed one or more evolutionary mechanisms which worked above the species level. The ideas of punctuated equilibrium and species selection were suggested, but in each case most biologists felt they could be explained by the usual small-scale changes. This explains why 'macroevolution' is perhaps a term biologists do not need to use.\nWhen discussing the topic, creationists use \"strategically elastic\" definitions of micro- and macroevolution. Macroevolution, by their definition, cannot be attained. Any observed evolutionary change is described by them as being \"just microevolution\".\nThe debate between biologists continues, with some biologists stating that there is significant evidence that other factors have acted during macroevolution, and others maintaining that macroevolution can still be fully explained by the mechanisms of microevolution."}

The DNA sequence is copied by a special enzyme called RNA polymerase to make a matching RNA strand. \nThe matching RNA strand is a 'pre-messenger RNA'. Next, the non-coding introns are stripped out by a spliceosome. The remaining exons are put together to make a messenger RNA. \nThe product is called messenger RNA (mRNA) because it carries a genetic message from the DNA to the protein-making machinery of the cell. Transcription is the first step that leads to the expression of the genes.\nThe stretch of DNA that is transcribed into an RNA molecule is called a \"transcription unit\". This contains:\nAs in DNA replication, only one of the two DNA strands is transcribed. This strand is called the \"template strand\", because it provides the template for ordering the sequence of nucleotides in an RNA transcript. The other strand is called the \"coding strand\". Its sequence is the same as the newly created RNA transcript (except for thymine being substituted for uracil). \nThe DNA template strand is read 3' \u2192 5' direction by RNA polymerase and the new RNA strand is synthesized in the 5'\u2192 3' direction. RNA polymerase binds to the 3' end of a gene (promoter) on the DNA template strand and travels toward the 5' end.\nRoger D.

Together with Hamilton Hume he explored much of Victoria.\nEarly life.\nWilliam Hovell was born at Yarmouth, Norfolk, England. He joined the Royal Navy and became a captain. In October 1813, he moved to New South Wales with his wife Esther Arndell. He got work as a ship captain and made several trading trips along the coast and to New Zealand. In 1816 he was shipwrecked in Bass Strait. In 1819 he lived near Sydney and did some exploring to the south. He reached the Burragorang Valley in 1823.\nCorio Bay.\nIn 1824, Governor Sir Thomas Brisbane asked Hovell to go with Hamilton Hume to explore the south part of New South Wales and Victoria. He wanted to know more about any rivers that might run south. Hovell was not an explorer but he knew how to navigate (find out where he was). There were problems deciding who was going to pay for the expedition. The two explorers bought most of the equipment. The government provided saddles, clothes, blankets and guns. Hume and Hovell left Sydney on October 3 1824, with six men, five bullocks, three horses and two carts. The Murrumbidgee River was in flood so they had to make one of the carts into a kind of boat to get across. The men, horses, and bullocks swam over. A day or two later, in rough hilly country, they had great difficulty in finding a path for the carts. On October 27 they decided to leave them behind. They came to a large river on November 16, which Hovell called \"Hume's River\" \"he being the first that saw it\". This was the Murray River renamed by Charles Sturt a few years later. It was impossible to cross here (near the site of Albury), but after a few days they found a better place. They built the rough frame of a boat and managed to get across. By December 3, they had reached the Goulburn River. During the next ten days it was hard traveling through rough country, but they did get to more level and open land. \nOn December 16, they saw Port Phillip Bay. They went along its shores in south-westerly direction. They came to what is now Corio Bay near Geelong. Hovell made a mistake of one degree in working out the longitude. The explorers thought that they were on Western Port Bay. The party went back on December 18, and went more to the west. This was an easier journey. By January 8 1825, they came to the end of their food. For a few days they lived on fish and a kangaroo they were able to shoot. On January 16 they reached the carts they had left behind them, and 2 days later came to Lake George.\nWestern Port.\nOn March 25, Governor Brisbane wrote about the discoveries of Hovell and Hume in a letter to England. He said that he was going to send a ship to Western Port to have it explored. His successor, Governor Ralph Darling, towards the end of 1826, sent an expedition led by Captain Wright to Western Port. Hovell went with this expedition, and his mistake in longitude was soon discovered. Hovell explored the land around Western Port and to the north. Near the coast at Cape Paterson he discovered \"great quantities of very fine coal\". This was the first discovery of coal in Victoria. Hovell was away 5 months on this expedition. He tried during the next 10 years to obtain some special reward from the government. He had already got 1,200 acres (5 km2) for the trip with Hume, and 1,280 acres (5 km2) for the trip to Western Port. He did not think this was enough.\nLater life.\nHe spent the rest of his life at his farm at Goulburn, New South Wales. He married Sophia Wilkinson in 1848. In December 1853, Hovell was special guest at a public dinner in Geelong, Victoria. His speech was reported in some of the newspapers. Hume thought that Hovell tried to claim all the credit for their joint expedition. This led to a long and bitter public fight between the two men. A full report of the speech shows that Hume was wrong. Hume was an experienced leader in the bush. Hovell was well-educated with a friendly character. During their expedition they worked well together. They were responsible for an important piece of exploration. Hovell's discovery of coal during his visit to Western Port was also important. Hovell died in Sydney on November 9 1875, and was buried at Goulburn. In 1877 his widow left \u00a36000 to the University of Sydney as a memorial of him, which was used to start the William Hilton Hovell lectureship on geology and physical geography.\nRecognition.\nIn 1922 a group was started in Melbourne to celebrate the centenary (100 years) of the expedition. Along the path of the expedition 37 memorials were built in Victoria. A dam was built on the King River near Cheshunt, Victoria in 1973. This formed Lake William Hovell. It supplies water for crops, vineyards and farms along the King River from Cheshunt to Wangaratta. A River Redgum tree Eucalyptus camaldulensis at Albury still has the mark Hovell made in 1824. He carved the words \"Hovell NovR17/24\" into the tree. The tree has been cloned so its genes can be kept for the future. An iron treasure chest, made in Germany in about 1660, and owned by Hovell is now in the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney. The Hume and Hovell Walking Track has been made, following the explorers path from Yass to Albury."}

It was created in Harran in 750 of the Christian era and shifted its capital in AD 762 from Harran to Baghdad. It flourished for two centuries. Abbasid rule was ended in 1258, when Hulagu Khan, the Mongol conqueror, sacked Baghdad. But they continued to claim authority in religious matters from their base in Egypt.\nDuring the period of the Abassid dynasty, Abassid claims to the caliphate did not go unchallenged. The Ubayd Allah al-Mahdi Billah of the Fatimid dynasty, which claimed descendency of Muhammad through his daughter, claimed the title of Caliph in 909 and created a separate line of caliphs in North Africa. Initially it covered only Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya, but then the Fatimid caliphs extended their rule for the next 150 years, taking Egypt and Palestine and even ancient Pakistan, before the Abbassid dynasty was able to turn the tide, limiting Fatimid rule to Egypt. The Fatimid dynasty finally ended in 1171. The Umayyad dynasty, which had survived and come to rule over the Muslim provinces of Spain, reclaimed the title of Caliph in 929, lasting until it was overthrown in 1031.\nThe tenth caliph, namely Al-Mutawakkil, is the person who oversaw the introduction of hadiths."}

He worked in Rome, Naples, Malta and Sicily between 1593 and 1610. He was a painter who did a type of art called Baroque style. He was the first person to be really good at painting this way.\nEven while he was alive, many people talked about Caravaggio. Some people liked to see what he did, and how he lived, and thought he was a good person. Other people thought he was very strange. Some people thought he was bad. He did not want to fit in, sometimes. He started being a famous painter in Rome in 1600. Many people gave him money to paint pictures for them, but he used all his money and sometimes got into trouble. In 1604 someone wrote a note about him, and said that he was rude and a bad person. This note tells us how he lived, in 1601: In 1606 he killed a young man in a fight and ran away from Rome. He ran away because Rome said it would give money to people who caught Caravaggio. In Malta in 1608 he got into a fight again. He got into another fight in Naples in 1609, but this fight could have been enemies (people who hated him) trying to kill him. In 1610, after making paintings for more than ten years, he died.\nHuge new churches and palazzi were being built in Rome the last years of the 1500s and the first years of the 1600s. These big churches needed paintings to hang on the walls. The Counter-Reformation Catholic Church wanted to find painters who would paint beautiful art about God. They wanted people to like the art so much that they would think Protestantism was ugly and boring, and wouldn't want to start being part of a Protestant church. So the Catholic Church needed a new type of art, because Mannerism had been the most famous type of art for 100 years, and now it was boring. Caravaggio's paintings were new, and different from Mannerism. He painted in a way called naturalism, which means that he painted things how they actually looked. He painted pictures of people so that the people looked real, and he made his pictures look exciting by painting a lot of very dark shadows and very bright lights (which is called chiaroscuro). \nWhile he was alive he was very famous, and many artists wanted to paint like he did. But after he died, most people forgot about him, and didn't care about his paintings. Hundreds of years later, in the 1900s, people looked at his art again, and saw that he had been very important. They saw that many other famous artists had tried to paint like he did. Because so many artists had seen his paintings, and liked how he painted, and tried to paint like he did, he made many artists paint in the Baroque style, too. The Baroque style was very famous for hundreds of years. \nAndre Berne-Joffroy, Paul Val\u00e9ry\u2019s secretary, said that: \"What begins in the work of Caravaggio is, quite simply, modern painting.\""}

Gacy did not use a gun for any of his crimes.\nGacy became known as \"Pogo the Clown\" and the \"Killer Clown\" because he would dress as a clown for fundraising events and parades. In March 1980, Gacy was convicted of 33 murders, as well as sex crimes, committed between 1972 and 1978, and given the death penalty. He was executed by lethal injection on May 10, 1994. Gacy's execution was filmed; his last words were, \"kiss my ass\". There were problems with the execution, but it eventually ended in Gacy's death. Immediately prior to his execution, Gacy observed the Last Rites with a Catholic priest; he had converted to the Catholic Church.\nEarly life.\nJohn Wayne Gacy, Jr. was born on March 17, 1942, in Chicago, Illinois, to father John Stanley Gacy and mother Marion Elaine Gacy. Gacy's father was a World War I veteran and a machinist, while his mother worked at home. He had two sisters, one younger and one older.\nGacy's father was an alcoholic. Growing up, John Gacy, Sr. would verbally and physically abuse his children. Gacy also had health problems in his youth. For example, in 1953, while playing on a swing set, Gacy hit his head off a swing and suffered a blood clot. The clot was not treated until he was 16.chapter one\nAfter dropping out of high school in his senior year, Gacy moved to Las Vegas, Nevada, to work in a mortuary. Three months later, Gacy returned to Chicago, where he enrolled in and graduated from Northwestern Business College. After graduating, Gacy worked as a shoe salesman for the Nunn-Bush Shoe Company. In 1964, Gacy was transferred to Springfield, Illinois, where he met Marlynn Myers. The couple married in September 1964.\nIn Springfield, Gacy was involved in community organizations such as the United States Junior Chamber. He became the vice-president of the Springfield chapter by 1965.\nMove to Iowa.\nAfter Marlynn's father made him an offer to manage three KFC restaurants, Gacy and his wife moved to Waterloo, Iowa, where they had a son and daughter.\nIn 1968, Gacy was diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder.\nUnidentified victims.\nAs of August 2017 Six victims remain unidentified, five of whom had been buried beneath Gacy's crawl space, with one additional youth buried approximately from the barbecue pit in his backyard. Experts used the skulls of the unidentified victims to create facial reconstructions. Based upon Gacy's confession, information relative to where the victims were buried in his crawl space relative to Gacy's identified victims, and forensic analysis, police were able to determine the most likely dates when his unidentified victims were killed.\nDeath.\nOn 10 May 1994, Gary was executed by lethal injection. He was 52 years old.\nIn October 2011, Cook County Sheriff Thomas Dart announced that investigators, having obtained full DNA profiles from each of the unidentified victims, were to renew their efforts to identify all of them. At a press conference held to announce this intention, Sheriff Dart stated investigators are actively seeking DNA samples from individuals across the United States related to any male missing between 1970 and 1979. Test results thus far conducted have confirmed the identification of two victims, ruled out the possibility of numerous other missing youths as being victims of Gacy, and solved four unrelated cold cases dating between 1972 and 1979.&gt;"}

The word \"aikido\" is often translated as \"the way of unifying (with) life energy\" or as \"the way of harmonious spirit.\" Ueshiba wanted to create an art where people could defend themselves without harming their attacker by using the attackers \"ki\" against them. He wanted each practitioner of aikido to develop both physically and spiritually.\nAikido is performed by blending with the way the attacker moves, using the force of the attack rather than coming against it. This is achieved by using the attackers \"ki\" against them. This takes very little physical strength, as the \"aikid\u014dka\" (person who does aikido) uses the force of the attacker's own momentum using stepping and turning movements. The techniques are completed with many different throws or joint locks which can be combined with different defenses. Aikido is one of many grappling arts.\nAikido is based on the martial art of Dait\u014d-ry\u016b Aiki-j\u016bjutsu, but began to separate from it in the late 1920s, partly due to Ueshiba's involvement with the \u014cmoto-ky\u014d religion.

Blog organizes content in the form of categories and posts. Posts on a blog are presented in reverse chronological order. That means your latest post goes to the top of the page. That way, when you make a new post, it will come first and the first post will go below it. Anyone can create a blog and then write on that blog. Bloggers (a word for people who write on blogs) often write about their opinions and thoughts. A blog containing video material is called a video blog or video log, usually shortened to vlog.\nWhen a person writes on a blog, what they write is in the form of a \"post\", which is a single piece of writing on the blog. Posts often include links to other websites.\nBlogs can have one or more writers. If they have more than one writer, they are often called community blogs, team blogs, or group blogs because the thoughts are made by more than one person.\nHow blogs work.\nOn many blogs, the person reading the posts can leave comments, which are notes in which a person says what they think about the blog post. This makes blogs good for discussion \u2014 if someone writes something that someone else does not believe to be true, someone else can fix it by writing a comment on that blog or on their own blog. Someone else cannot change what the post says, but the writer of the post can. Not all blog posts need to be talked about or fixed. But if there are a lot of people interested in a topic, they can start a discussion on the original blog, on their own blogs, or both. These people can discuss a topic or their point of view.\nVery often, a community blog or group blog will shrink into a small group of bloggers (writers) who know and trust each other, called a \"creative network\". That kind of community blog will also have a larger group of people, a \"social network\", who only read (and maybe comment on) the blog. Some blogs have scoring (ranking) of posts that makes these networks more solid, so that postings that people like the most are shown first or in a way that is easier to find. \nOften people have their own blog and make an RSS feed to it. When blogs have RSS feeds, other programs, called \"content aggregators\", can put postings from all the blogs that a person likes in one place. Many people find it easier to read all the new posts from blogs they like in one place, through RSS, instead of going to each site one at a time.\nSome experts think that community blogs, and some groups of individual (one-person) blogs that talk about similar topics, have a power structure like that inside a political party. These experts think that a clique (a small, exclusive group of people) will control discussions by choosing when someone has \"won\" an argument, and when a matter is decided. But an advantage of blogs is that even people outside that clique can comment on the original discussion."}

It is often used to imply that the healer has little or no experience or ability in medicine.\nThe Oxford English Dictionary says that the first recorded use of this term is in 1718, in a book by Francis Hutchinson.\nThe witch doctors in Africa are known as sangomas in Southern Africa. The Oxford English Dictionary states that the first use of the term \"witch doctor\" to refer to African shamans (i.e. medicine men) was in 1836 in a book by Robert Montgomery Martin (1803?-1868).\nThe role is only partly a practical one. It is also a spiritual one. The so-called witch doctor is often the guardian of the tribe's belief system and rituals. Key ceremonies must be properly held or else the life of the community may fall apart, as has happened in many places. Aggressive action by outsiders to the local belief system may lead to the 'genocide of indigenous peoples'. "}

The flight was commanded by Jim Lovell. The other astronauts on board were Jack Swigert and Fred Haise.\nThe craft was launched successfully toward the Moon, but two days after launch a faulty oxygen tank exploded, and the Service Module became damaged, causing a loss of oxygen and electrical power. There was a very large chance that the astronauts would die before they could return to Earth. They were very short of oxygen. Oxygen is not just used to breathe; on the Apollo spacecraft it was used in a device called a Fuel cell to generate electricity. So they conserved their remaining air by turning off almost all their electrical equipment, for example heaters. It became very cold in the spacecraft.\nIn order to stay alive the astronauts also had to move into the Apollo Lunar Module and make it work as a sort of \"lifeboat\".\nWhen they approached the Earth they were not sure that their parachutes, needed to slow the Command Module down, would work. The parachutes were thrown out by small explosive charges that were fired by batteries. The cold could have made the batteries fail, in which case the parachutes would not work and the Command Module would hit the ocean so fast that all aboard would be killed.\nThe flight.\nApollo blasted off on the April 11, 1970 at 19:13 UTC from Cape Canaveral and went into temporary low Earth orbit. Two hours later they fired the rocket motor again to go towards the Moon. They wanted to land at Fra Mauro. Despite the hardships, the crew made it back to Earth. Though the crew did not land on the Moon, the flight became very well known.\nSome people regarded it as a failure because they did not land on the Moon. However, others thought it was possibly the National Aeronautics and Space Administrations' (NASA's) \"greatest\" accomplishment in returning three men in a very damaged spacecraft back to Earth safely.\nComing up to re-entry, it was thought that the electrical equipment would short circuit because the water in the astronauts' breath had turned back into a liquid all over the computers. However, the electronics were fine.\nBooks were written about the event, for example one by Jim Lovell, the commander of the mission. A movie was also made about it, directed by Ron Howard and starring Tom Hanks."}

It is based on Alan Moore's graphic novel \"V for Vendetta\". Moore did not like most movies about his work. He asked that his name not appear on it. The movie is set in a dystopian future United Kingdom of the year 2020, which has become a totalitarian fascist dictatorship.\nPlot.\nIt started Evey Hammond going out to see a co-worker named Gordon Deitrich. It is past curfew and she will get in trouble if she gets caught. As she walks, she is stopped by three police officers. She is about to be harmed when V, a man who wears a Guy Fawkes mask, comes in and rescues her. He then invites her to a concert. They go up on the roof. V waves around and the \"1812 Overture\" begins playing. Evey is then shocked to see the Old Bailey be destroyed as V laughs.\nThe next day, V enters the British Television Network (BTN). He then forces the people there to play a message. The message goes out to all households. In the tape, V tells them that they are all to blame for the current state of government. The government can tape anyone and arrest anyone and people fear it. He then tells them that he was the one that blew up the Old Bailey and to join him next November 5 if they want to stand up to the government.\nThe government, meanwhile, has started to pour troops into the BTN. V fights them off, but is caught. Evey, who has been hiding, taps the man on the shoulder and sprays him with pepper spray, freeing V. Evey is knocked out and wakes up inside V's location. V carried her away because he knew she would be in big trouble for helping him.\nAfter some time, Evey comes to help V. V wants to kill a priest. She dresses up like a schoolgirl and goes into the priest's office. However, she backs out and tells the priest that V wants to kill him. The priest thinks it's a joke until V bursts in and does so. Evey runs away to Gordon's house. Gordon has his own talk show, and one day he decides to make a big joke. He makes fun of the Chancellor Adam Sutler. In response, Sutler goes into Gordon's house and arrests him.\nEvey tries to escape and is caught. She is then tortured over many days. Men plunge her face into water, throw her in a cell, and shave the hair off her head, but she will not tell them any information about V. Eventually, one of the men tells her that she will be shot behind the barracks if she does not say anything. Evey says she would rather be shot; she does not have any more fear. It is then revealed that V was behind the torture and that he wanted her to have no fear. Evey is angry but soon accepts it. She later leaves but promises to come back before November 5.\nMeanwhile, a Norsefire Party worker named Eric Finch begins to look into the government. He does not trust it anymore. He realizes that V is killing everyone who was at a detention camp called Larkhill. During the movie, V kills the priest, who was at the camp; a general named Lewis Prothero, who is now a talk show host; and Delia Surridge, who was a doctor. He attempts to find out more information about Larkhill. In the movie, we learn that V was a prisoner at Larkhill and blew the place up when he escaped.\nEventually, V comes to Finch. He is disguised and calls himself Rookwood. He tells them everything that Finch has long thought \u2013 that the Norsefire found a plague and decided to infect the people to put them in power.\nAs November 5 approaches, the city gets restless. Riots break out. V gives out thousands of Guy Fawkes masks to people for them to wear on November 5. A member of the secret police called the \"Fingermen\" shoots a young girl wearing one of these masks dead.\nEvey comes back. V then shows her what is going to do. He has loaded explosives into a train that will go underneath the Palace of Westminster. He then gives her the choice whether to pull the trigger or not. He then disappears.\nV goes to another area, where he finds Peter Creedy, the second-in-command of Norsefire. Earlier, V made a deal with him: V would turn himself in if Sutler was killed. Creedy shows Sutler, and then shoots him in the forehead. He then tells V to surrender, but V says no. In the final battle, V kills Creedy and all of his men, but is severely wounded himself. He dies in Evey's arms.\nEvey puts him on the train with the explosives. Finch, who guessed that V would use a train to blow up the Palace, draws a gun and attempts to stop her. Evey says no. When Finch asks why, Evey says, \"Because this country needs more than a building. It needs hope.\" Finch lowers his gun and allows the train to go. Because Creedy and Sutler are dead, the army outside the Palace does not know what to do. The man in charge orders them to stand down, or to put down their weapons and not do anything. The \"1812 Overture\" begins again, and everyone watches as the Palace of Westminster is destroyed."}

{"id": "115556", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=115556", "title": "Mario Kart Wii", "text": " is a kart racing video game made by Nintendo for the Wii game console which was first shown at E3 2007. It is the sixth installment in the \"Mario Kart\" series and the second \"Mario Kart\" title to use the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. The game was released in every country throughout April 2008, but one year later in South Korea.\n\"Mario Kart Wii\" features 16 new tracks, plus 16 from the previous games in the series, and is bundled with the Wii Wheel. The game was commercially successful in every region, and sold over a million copies in both Japan and the United States in less than a month. It also received positive reviews from critics.\nGameplay.\nIn \"Mario Kart Wii\", players choose a character from a roster having of up to 24 characters and from 36 cars. The cars are classified into three different weight classes. A character's weight decides the available types of karts and motorbikes, and their performance on the tracks. Each car has seven different parameters for characteristics: speed, weight, acceleration, handling, drift, off-road, and mini-turbo. \"Mario Kart Wii\" has 32 different tracks, having 16 new tracks, four tracks each from \"Mario Kart 64\", ', and \"Mario Kart DS\", and two each from \"Super Mario Kart\" and '. Plus, up to twelve characters can play in a race. Players get items by driving through item boxes, which can be used for either defense, offense, or for powering up the engine. New items from \"Mario\" platform games are introduced, like the \"Mega Mushroom\" from \"New Super Mario Bros.\" It allows the character to grow very big in size and flatten other players. The \"POW BLOCK\" from \"Mario Bros.\" allows the character to send a shockwave to all the players in front of them, spinning them out of control and making them drop any items they may be carrying (there is no effect, however, on those who are airborne). One new item to the series is the \"Lightning Cloud\", which raises the user's top speed briefly, but shrinks the user if it is not passed on to an opponent by colliding with them.\n\"Mario Kart Wii\" has 24 selectable Nintendo characters, more than any of the other \"Mario\" games. In addition to this, there are 12 different kinds (3 weight classes, 2 genders, 2 outfits) of the Mii, the digital avatar made by Nintendo. Twelve characters are available from the beginning; the other twelve and the two Mii variants become available after finishing certain elements of the game. The cast of characters has 19 returning characters from the series and six new characters; Baby Peach, Funky Kong, user-created Miis, Rosalina, Dry Bowser, and Baby Daisy. There are eight characters of each weight class. The Mii's weight class depends on its height and weight (this can be customized in the Mii Channel), and its favorite color changes the color scheme of its clothing, while the gender changes the color scheme of their cars.\nDevelopment.\n\"Mario Kart Wii\" was officially announced at the 2007 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3); the online features and the first footage of the game was shown. Producer Hideki Konno wanted to include online features for \"Mario Kart DS\", but they were left out due to time constraints.\nThe game was called \"\"Mario Kart X\" internally for a while, before deciding on \"Mario Kart Wii\"\". General producer and Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto's inputs were limited to new aspects of play such as the Wii Wheel and battles over Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. The designers tested roughly 30 different prototypes with different shapes, colors and weights (based on real-life go-karts), before deciding on the final Wii Wheel design.\nReception.\nThe game received many positive reviews, and was commercially successful in every region, and sold over a million copies in both Japan and the United States in less than a month. Joe Sinicki of Blast Magazine comments: \"While it still does suffer from some of the problems of the older games, \"Mario Kart Wii\" takes the simple and accessible formula set by its predecessors and tweaks it enough to make it feel fresh and fun, creating one of the most entertaining and rewarding gaming experiences in quite some time.\"\nIn the week ending May 4, 2008, \"Mario Kart Wii\" had sold over a million copies in Japan alone, less than a month since its release in the region. In the UK, \"Mario Kart Wii\" was the best-selling video game in the week ending April 12, 2008, having \"the eighth biggest opening sales week in UK software history,\" according to Chart-Track/ELSPA. As of 30 Sep 2019, Mario Kart Wii sold 37.24 million copies, which make it the third best-selling game overall. "}

The movie stars Emile Hirsch, Christina Ricci and Matthew Fox. It was directed by the Wachowski\u2019s. The movie is based on the 1960s Japanese anime of the same name.\nPlot.\nThe movie begins at a race which the main character, Speed Racer, wins. The Racer family is a local, family-run company that builds and races cars.\nIn a flashback, it is shown that Speed Racer's older brother, Rex, died while racing the \"Casa Cristo 5000\", a big race that goes across two continents. It is very dangerous and the drivers are very bad. The drivers try to get other racers out of the race by hitting their cars or using tools to get them out of the race. Rex was said to be cheating in the race. This gave people a bad opinion of the racing world.\nA man named Mr. Royalton saw Speed's victory and went to his house. He offered Speed a contract to race for the Royalton racing team. Speed chose not sign the contract because he loves the art of racing. Royalton got angry and told Speed that racing is only a business and that his and his family's belief in it being an art is nonsense. He said that he will make sure that Speed does not finish his next race. At the next race at Fuji, Speed did spin out and he did not finish the race.\nA very shadowy group then went to the Racer family. Earlier in the movie, a racer named Taejo Togokhan was beat up. His hand was almost cut off for trying to oppose the Royalton family. He and someone named Racer X were trying to beat the Royaltons. The Royaltons wanted to buy out the Togokhan company. However, if Togokhan wins the Casa Cristo, the value of the company will go up and Royalton could not buy it. Togokhan would only race if Speed Racer was on the team. Pops said that Speed could not do so. Because of this, Speed and his girlfriend Trixie said they were skiing but went to the race instead.\nAt the end of the first day of the Casa Cristo, the Togokhan team was in second place. Togokhan was very mad, but Racer X told him that there was much more racing ahead. The Racer family found out that Speed was in the race and came to try and get him. When Speed refused to leave, they stayed to help the team. During the night, ninjas went into each of the team's rooms to tried to hurt them. Togokhan was given a drug that makes it hard for him to stand up. The drug stopped him from racing. Racer X and Speed fought the ninjas and won. Trixie chose to race for Togokhan.\nOn the second day of the race, the Togokhan team took the lead. However, during a pass in the mountain area, the Royalton people tried to kidnap and kill the racers. Spritle Racer, Speed's younger brother, hit one of the men with mud, and the rest of the Togokhan team and the Racer family fought off the bad guys. During this, the Sneak Oiler team took the lead in the race. Inside the mountain area, the Sneak Oilers dropped oil on the road. This caused Speed to fall off the mountain. He drove up the side of the mountain and took the lead to win the Casa Cristo.\nIt turned out that this was for nothing. Togokhan's plan all along was to win the race to make the price of the stock of his fathers company increase. They made more money when his father sold the company to the Royaltons. Speed was very mad. He drove around the track. Racer X found him and hit his car to make him stop. Speed then told Racer X that he thought that Racer X was actually Rex, his dead brother. Racer took off his mask and showed Speed that he was someone different. He then told Speed that they should not let racing change who they are.\nTogokhan's sister later came up to Speed and gave him an invitation to that year's Grand Prix. The invitation was Togokhan's but he did not want it. The Racer family built a car for Speed, and they entered the race. During the race, Speeed took the lead. The Royalton car driver illegally used a spear hook to bring Speed down. The Royalton driver crashed and Speed's car stopped working. Speed slowed down. He thought hard and pushed the correct button to start the car again. He raced hard and fast to win the race. Royalton gets put on trial and is put in jail afterwards.\nBut it turns out that Racer X is Rex Racer, Speed Racers brother."}

It is the proportion of a given allele to all alleles at the same locus. It is usually expressed as a percentage.\nAllele frequencies may be used to describe genetic diversity in a population. If the frequency of any allele is above 1% it is probable that natural selection is maintaining it at this level. This is because the natural mutation rate of an allele is almost always much lower than 1%.\nA fixed allele is one allele that exists for a particular population. A fixed allele is homozygous for all members of the population.\nThe term \"allele\" refers to one variant gene out of several possible for a particular locus in the DNA. When all but one allele go away, one only remains. That allele is said to be fixed."}

Since such organisms have two sets of chromosomes, they have (except on the sex chromosomes) two alleles at each gene locus.p6\nIf the two alleles are identical, the individual is called a homozygote and is said to be homozygous. If instead the two alleles are different, the individual is a heterozygote and is heterozygous.205\nDominance.\nIn a heterozygote the effect of one allele may completely \u2018mask\u2019 the other. That is, the phenotype produced by the two alleles in heterozygous combination is identical to that produced by one of the two homozygous genotypes.212 \nThe allele that masks the other is said to be dominant to the latter, and the alternative allele is said to be recessive to the former. This idea originates in the work of Gregor Mendel, the founder of genetics.\nIn other cases, both alleles contribute to the phenotype.\nExample.\nThe inheritance of alleles, and their dominance, can be represented in a Punnett square.\nAn example is the gene for blossom colour in many species of flower. A single gene controls the colour of the petals, but there may be several different versions (or alleles) of the gene.\nIn this example, parents have the genotype Bb (capital letters show dominant alleles and lower-case letters to show recessive alleles). If B (capital) is found in their genotype, the flower will be red. Therefore, the only time a flower is not red is when the genotype is bb (there are no capital 'B's).\nThe probability of the flowers having different genotypes are: BB is 25%, Bb is 50%, and bb is 25%. The phenotype of the flower will always be red if a dominant B is in the genotype. Therefore, there is a 25% chance of getting a flower which is not red, and 75% chance of getting a flower which is red.\nRecessive.\nThe pattern of inheritance of recessive genes is quite simple. If they are heterozygous with a dominant allele, the appearance (phenotype) is the same as a dominant homozygote. Only if both alleles are recessive does the recessive allele show in the phenotype b.\nIncomplete dominance.\nThis is when the dominant allele is not completely dominant over the recessive allele. This means both the alleles have a degree of phenotypic expression in the hybrids. In this case the functional product formed is a little different or is intermediate between the product produced by to the dominant allele and the recessive allele.\nFor example: \"Mirabilis jalapa\". The heterozygote of this plant produces flowers in the F1 generation of the colour pink in contrast to the red (dominant) and white (recessive) homozygotes.\nSex linkage.\nGenes on the sex chromosomes are said to be sex linked. In the XY sex determination system of mammals, the X chromosomes carry a full set of genes, but the Y chromosomes carry few genes. Alleles or genes which are not sex-linked are called autosomal.\nDifferent alleles at a locus.\nThere are three ways alleles at a locus may differ.p6 They are:\nTwo alleles different by descent may or may not be of different state. For example, one may carry a mutation, so making its DNA sequence different."}

{"id": "115722", "revid": "983938", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=115722", "title": "Hugo Wolf", "text": "Hugo Wolf (born Windischgraz (now Slovenj Gradec, Slovenia) 13 March, 1860; died Vienna, 22 February 1903) was an Austrian composer of Slovene origin. He is famous for his Lieder (German art songs). He found new ways of expressing poetry in music. He used the song forms that had been made by Schubert and Schumann, but his harmonies bring something very new and personal to German song. He was particularly fond of the music of Richard Wagner and his tonal writing is influenced by him. He belongs to the late Romantic period.\nAlthough he wrote other kinds of music besides Lieder, the only other piece of his which is played regularly is his \"Italian Serenade\".\nAt times Wolf worked very hard and composed a lot of music. At other times he felt unhappy and had depression. Towards the end of his life he went mad and had to go to an asylum. He died of syphilis.\nHis name is pronounced \u201cHoo-go Volf\u201d (rhyming with \u201cgolf\u201d).\nLife.\nEarly life (1860 \u2013 1887).\nThe town where Wolf was born is now called Slovenj Gradec in Slovenia, but at that time it was part of the Austrian Empire. He was a child prodigy. When he was four he learned the piano and violin from his father. When he went to school he learned with Sebastian Weixler. Music was the only thing he was interested in at school. He changed schools but still did little work except for music. He went to Vienna to study at the Vienna Conservatory. His father did not want him to become a musician. He was made to leave the Conservatory because he did not obey their rules. Wolf said later that he left because he did not like the old-fashioned teaching.\nAfter eight months with his family, he returned to Vienna to teach music. He had a fiery temper which did not make him an ideal teacher. However, he found some rich people who thought he was a good composer and paid him money so that he could have the time to compose.\nOne of his rich patrons had a daughter called Vally. Wolf fell in love with her, and he was very depressed when she left him after three years. He did not get on well with his family either. His father thought he was not trying to make a living. Wolf got a job as \nsecond Kapellmeister at Salzburg. However, he was not a good conductor and he soon left that job and went back to Vienna. to teach.\nWolf was fascinated by the music of Wagner. He tried to get Wagner\u2019s attention once, running after his coach and begging Wagner to listen to his music. He was terribly sad when Wagner died. He wrote a song \"Zur Ruh, zur Ruh\" (\u201cTo rest, to rest\") which is one of his best early works. He was very depressed because Wagner had gone and he felt that there was no one who could inspire him to compose. \nThe great composer Franz Liszt became interested in him, and told him he ought to try to compose some longer pieces. He wrote a symphonic poem \"Penthesilea\". Wolf also became a music critic. He wrote about new pieces of music. He liked the music of Liszt, but hated the music of several other composers such as Anton Rubinstein and Johannes Brahms. He made many enemies because of the harsh things he wrote about them. People called him \"Wild Wolf\". He composed several works, but could not get them performed. He had been very critical of the famous Ros\u00e9 Quartet, so they refused to play his music when they were asked.\nHe stopped writing musical criticism in 1887 and began composing once more. He wrote songs which set poems by Goethe, Joseph von Eichendorff. He wrote an orchestral work called \"Italian Serenade\" which is one of his best works outside Lieder. Then his father died and he did not compose for the rest of the year.\nMaturity (1888 \u2013 1896).\nWolf composed a lot during the years 1888 and 1889. He stayed with some friends outside Vienna and wrote songs using poetry by M\u00f6rike. He stayed with other friends and composed music to poems by Eichendorff. Then he wrote 51 Goethe songs, followed by \"Spanisches Liederbuch\" (\"Spanish Song Book\"). Wolf soon became very famous. His songs had very good reviews, although not everyone was enthusiastic. Brahms wrote bad things about him because, of course, Wolf had written bad things about Brahms.\nBy 1891 Wolf had become exhausted. His health became poor and he suffered from syphilis as well as from depression. He composed nothing for several years, although his fame continued to spread. Even Brahms changed his mind a wrote good reviews of his music.\nComposers were always expected to write large pieces such as symphonies and operas if they were to be taken seriously. Wagner was given the words for an opera called \"Der Corregidor\". At first he did not want to use it because the libretto was not good, but then he decided to write the opera. However, although it was performed it never became a success.\nFinal years (1897 \u2013 1903).\nWolf last appeared at a concert in February 1897. Soon afterwards he went mad and had to be put in an asylum. A lady called Melanie whom he had loved visited him faithfully during his last years until his death on February 22, 1903. However, she felt very bad because she had not been faithful to her husband, and she killed herself in 1906.\nWolf is buried in the Zentralfriedhof (Central Cemetery) in Vienna, together with many other great composers.\nMusic.\nWolf\u2019s true greatness lies in his Lieder. Although he tried at times to write larger musical works, his real genius lay in writing the smaller forms. He had a great feel for poetry and it is expressed beautifully in many ways: in the late-Romantic harmony which is often very chromatic, in the very original way he writes the piano accompaniments, and in the clever way in which he organizes his songs into groups with connecting themes. His most famous collections are \"M\u00f6rike-Lieder\" (1888), \"Eichendorff-Lieder\" (1889), \"Goethe-Lieder\" (1890), \"Spanisches Liederbuch\" (1891), \"Italienisches Liederbuch\" (1892, 1896) and \"Michelangelo Lieder\" (1897).\nWolf wrote hundreds of Lieder, three operas, incidental music, choral music, as well as some rarely-heard orchestral, chamber and piano music. His most famous instrumental piece is the \"Italian Serenade\" (1887), originally for string quartet and later arranged for orchestra."}

They were known for their great performances of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, but also some more modern composers including Arnold Schoenberg.\nThe group often gave the first Vienna performances of works by Brahms, including his Clarinet Quintet and his Quintet in G major Opus 111. It also gave the first performance of Schoenberg's first and second string quartets and the sextet \"Verkl\u00e4rte Nacht\" in which they were joined by two other members of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra: Franz Jelinek, viola, and Franz Schmidt, cello."}

It is also used in some men's boxer shorts, shirts and neckties, bed sheets, and in the making of pointe shoes for use in ballet.\nSatin was originally woven by the silk weavers in China. As the secrets of silk making were carried westward, splendid satins were woven in Genoa and Florence, then at Lyons and in England in the 15th cent. \nModern satins are made in a great variety of fibers, including synthetic ones. The term satin now refers to any fabric that is manufactured with a satin weave and is a mixture of silk threads with a synthetic filament, such as rayon or polyester. Silk mixed with short-staple cotton threads is referred to as sateen. Satin fabric is easily recognized by its even, glossy surface and flowing drape.\nDutchess satin is a gorgeous, high thread count, medium-bodied, low luster blended satin that sews easily and benefits from underlining to maintain shape. The extra weight of dutchess satin, as compared to regular satin fabric, lends itself to beading and embroidery. The synthetic component allows the fabric to be machine washed, and makes it last longer. Dutchess satin is used extensively for bridal wear and accessories, due to its pearly sheen and structural stability. The wrinkle-resistant material is also ideal for evening wear and lingerie."}

She was the number 1 player for 12 weeks from June to September 2008. She won the French Open in 2008 and came second there in 2007. She also came second at the Australian Open in 2008. She has also played tennis for Serbia in the international tournament called the Fed Cup.\nIvanovi\u0107 is tall, and is famous for the way she plays. She is best known for her powerful serve. Although she is Serbian, Ivanovi\u0107 currently lives in Basel, Switzerland. As of January 2015, she has earned over $13 million during her tennis career. Outside tennis, she is interested in clothes and fashion, and is an ambassador for the worldwide charity for children, UNICEF.\nIn December 2016, Ivanovi\u0107 announced her retirement from pro tennis.\nEarly and personal life.\nIvanovi\u0107 was born in Belgrade in Serbia (which used to be in Yugoslavia). She watched tennis on television when she was five years old, and said, \"I loved watching tennis on television, particularly Monica Seles.\" While she was growing up, the country was bombed by NATO, so she had to arrange her training to avoid this. She would even practice tennis in an empty swimming pool during the winter. When she was 14 years old, she was asked what she dreamed of in tennis, she replied \"To become the No. 1 magic player in the world.\" Her Serbian tennis teacher introduced her to a Swiss businessman who agreed to hire a coach and pay for Ivanovi\u0107's training in Switzerland.\nHer father, Miroslav, and brother, Miros, watch some of Ana's matches on television, but her mother, Dragana, goes to all of them.

She also uses both hands on the racket when hitting her backhand shots. She can hit her shots from the baseline (the back of the tennis court) but is also good at volleys. Because she is very tall () she can serve the ball very fast. She hit a serve at the French Open in 2007, the fifth fastest serve of all time on the WTA Tour. However, her serve has become unreliable, mostly because of problems with her toss of the ball. She also has a strong wrist which means she can hide what kind of serve she is going to use until the last moment. She will often shout \"Ajde!\" (\"Come on!\" in Serbian) during her matches.\nProfessional career.\nIvanovi\u0107 played in the junior version of Wimbledon in 2004.

To support his son Anthony had to take extra jobs, but he found enough time to attend all of Hamilton's races.\nIn October 2007, Hamilton announced his intention to live in Switzerland. He said this was to avoid the media scrutiny in the United Kingdom. Hamilton later admitted on the television show \"Parkinson\", that taxation was part of the reason for his decision.

He was able to rejoin the race after the restart. His ninth place finish in this race was his first non-podium and non-points finish.\nHamilton won the Hungarian Grand Prix from pole position. At first, Alonso had set the fastest time, but he received a five-place grid penalty for blocking Hamilton in the pit lane; an action that prevented Hamilton from running his final qualifying lap.

This caused Hamilton to miss one last lap to try and earn the pole position. Alonso was moved back to the sixth starting position. This moved Hamilton to the pole. McLaren was docked constructors championship points. Hamilton said he thought Alonso's penalty was \"quite light if anything\" and only regretted the loss of constructors' points. As a result of these events, the relationship between Hamilton and Alonso temporarily collapsed. The pair were not on speaking terms for a short period.\nAfter the Japanese Grand Prix, Alonso felt that a race stewards' verdict had settled the championship in Hamilton's favor. He said: \"I'm not thinking of this championship anymore, it's been decided off the track. The drivers' briefing has no purpose. You go there to hear what Charlie Whiting and the other officials say.

Alonso complained on the radio to his team. The stewards investigated the incident and penalized Hamilton with a drive through penalty. There was a 20\u00a0minutes before the penalty was announced. This allowed Hamilton to build up a large gap with the car behind him. When he served his penalty, he stayed in second place. This made Alonso and the Ferrari team mad.

He was one of the main preachers who are part of the Charismatic revival meetings in Lakeland, Florida known as the Florida Healing Outpouring. Attendance at the meetings was as high as 10,000 visitors a night from around the world. Todd Bentley has since been denounced as a false prophet by Christian communities.\nEarly life.\nWhen Bently was a child he lived in Gibsons, British Columbia, a small place in west Canada. At the time when Todd Bentley's mother and father stopped being married, Bentley wrote in a book about himself that he made in 2008 called, \"The Journey into the Miraculous\", that he had problems and did illegal drugs. He also said in this book that he had drank too much alcohol. Bentley said that he changed to believe in Jesus and be a Christian, and when he did that he did not have problems with drugs or drinking alcohol anymore. He became a Christian when he was 18 years old.\nWhat Bently believes.\nBentley's beliefs are close to the Assemblies of God (AOG) and often speaks at meetings in AOG churches, although he is not under their authority.\nArguments.\nBentley's other beliefs and style are seen as being from \"Spiritual Leader\" to \"False Prophet\" by other Christian leaders. He yells 'Bam!' during sermons, He has an unusual appearance for a preacher such as tattoos and piercings.\nAt greater issue is Bentley's mysticism and spirituality, which is nontraditional for the Pentecostal and Charismatic congregations he serves and counter to others. Two major points of contention are the manner and veracity of the Faith Healing he conducts in his services and an encounter he discusses with an angel that was a harbinger of financial wellbeing. Other major theological debates have arisen from Bentley's references to several trips he has made to Heaven and meetings with the Paul the Apostle. These controversies were highlighted by the media coverage of the Lakeland revival.\nFaith healing.\nBentley heavily features faith healing, a common feature of the Charismatic movement. His behavior in conducting the healings has come under fire for the violence with which it is sometimes done. Bentley most commonly places his hands on an individual's head or area of infirmity but sometimes has more violently kicked out or hit the volunteer while calling out for the power of God to descend. In response, some people may stand and physically tremble, while others may literally fall down to the ground in what they call \"falling under the power\" of the Holy Spirit. The medical corroboration of both the injuries sustained by healings and the healings themselves has been a common topic of dissension in the media.\nThe Angel Emma.\nA controversy surrounds his alleged encounter with an angel he called 'Emma' at an AOG church in 2001. Bentley stated that the female angel gave him a vision of gold dust, and afterwards he received a breakthrough in terms of financial stability. Among Assembly of God congregants, especially, there was debate about whether such a professed encounter was in line with AOG doctrine as set out in the 16 Fundamental Truths The most persistent challenge was twofold; whether the experience of a specifically female angel who prophesied financial well-being was a Biblically recognized phenomenon, and whether preaching about such an encounter was theologically responsible - would it bring converts to worship such an angel rather than the God who sent her? Bentley has argued that it was God's choice, and not his own, that an angel appeared to him in that manner."}

In January 2007, he joined the Discovery Channel team, and won the famous Paris-Nice race in March. In the Tour de France, he won the 14th stage, and was second in the race to Michael Rasmussen. Rasmussen had to leave the race because he had not been honest about where he was training before the race. Because of this, Contador wore the yellow jersey, meaning he was in first place in the race, from stage 18. In stage 19, a time trial, he did not lose too much time, and started the last stage with a 23 seconds lead over Cadel Evans in second place. Evans and Contador finished with the same time, so Contador won the 2007 Tour de France.\n2008 season.\nThe Discovery Channel Team stopped racing at the end of 2007, and Contador joined the Astana Team. This was the same team he had worked for in 2005, but with a new name and new people managing it. However, the group running the Tour de France decided that Astana could not join the 2008 Tour de France. One week before the 2008 Giro d'Italia, the group running it invited the Astana team to join. The team did not have much time to prepare (get ready), but Contador became the leader of the race on the 15th stage. He wore the maglia rosa (pink leader's jersey) until the finish in Milan. This meant that Contador had won his second grand tour."}

Females gather in herds (groups) of up to nine animals. Males usually live alone.\nThe markhor is the National animal of Pakistan. The word \"Markhor\" is Persian for \"Snake Eater\". They live in Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, Tajikistan and India's Kashmir Valley. In Pakistan, they live in the Chitral, Ghizar and Hunza regions. There are fewer markhor left because human beings take livestock to eat grass in the places where the markhor lives. Other people have killed the markhor for its horns.

These layers are both physically and chemically different. The Earth has an outer solid layer called the crust, a highly viscous layer called the mantle, a liquid layer that is the outer part of the core, called the outer core, and a solid center called the inner core. The shape of the earth is an oblate spheroid, because it is slightly flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator.\nThe boundaries between these layers were discovered by seismographs which showed the way vibrations bounced off the layers during earthquakes. Between the Earth's crust and the mantle is a boundary called the moho. It was the first discovery of a major change in the Earth's structure as one goes deeper.\nA full explanation of these effects is not yet clear. It seems that the high temperature and pressure cause changes in the crystallization of minerals, so that the composition might be a kind of changing mixture of liquid and crystals.\nThe moho.\nThe moho, properly called the Mohorovi\u010di\u0107 discontinuity, is the boundary between the Earth's crust and the mantle. It was discovered by Croatian seismologist Andrija Mohorovi\u010di\u0107 in 1909. He discovered that seismograms of earthquakes showed two kinds of seismic waves. There is a shallow slower wave which arrives first, and a deep faster wave which arrives second. He reasoned that the deeper wave changed speed as it got just below the mantle. The reason it went faster was that the material of the mantle was different from that of the crust.\nThe discontinuity lies 3040\u00a0km below the surface of continents, and less deep below the ocean floors.\nDrilling holes.\nGeologists have been trying to get at the Moho for decades. During the late 1950s and early 1960s \"Project Mohole\" did not get enough support, and was cancelled by the United States Congress in 1967. Efforts were also made by the Soviet Union. They reached a depth of over 15 years, the world's deepest hole, before abandoning the attempt in 1989.\nReaching the discontinuity is still an important scientific target. One proposal considers a self-descending tungsten capsule. The idea is that the capsule would be filled with radioactive material. This would give off enough heat to melt the surrounding rock, and the capsule would be pulled down by gravity.\nThe Japanese project Chiky\u016b Hakken (\"Earth discovery\") plans to use a drilling shop to drill down through the thinner ocean crust. On 6 September 2012 Scientific deep sea drilling vessel Chikyu set a new world record by drilling down and obtaining rock samples from deeper than 2,111 metres below the seafloor off the Shimokita Peninsula of Japan in the northwest Pacific Ocean.\nMacquarie Island.\nMacquarie Island, off Tasmania, is at the meeting-point of two huge oceanic plates: the Pacific Plate and the Indo-Australian Plate. The island is made of material pushed up from deep in the Earth's mantle. It is thought that the green ophiolite rock was formed at the moho, and was brought up by a mid-oceanic ridge. Now it comes to the surface because the two plates are scrunching together. It is the only place on Earth where this is happening at present. There are other places where ophiolite is found, but they were brought up many millions of years ago. Ophiolites are found in all the major mountain belts of the world."}

It happened on August 16, during the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season. Erika was the eighth tropical cyclone, fifth tropical storm, and third hurricane of the season that year. The storm was created from a non-tropical area of low pressure that was tracked for five days before developing in the eastern Gulf of Mexico on August 14. Under the influence of a high pressure system, Erika moved quickly westward and became stronger under favorable conditions.\nStorm history.\nA weak surface area of low pressure came apart from a frontal system on August 8. It was moving southwestward during that time. On August 9, it created convection when it was passing underneath a cold-core upper-level low. As the system rapidly continued westward, a lot of the convection stayed near the center of the upper-level low, preventing development of a closed surface circulation. On August 13, while located near the northwestern Bahamas, an increase in convection made the upper-level low building downwards to the middle levels of the troposphere, which caused the development of an upper level anticyclone.\nOn August 14, a closed low-level circulation nearly developed to the east of Key Largo, Florida, but because of the deep convection remaining to the north over the mid-level center, it was weakened. The mid-level storm continued going westward and it moved across Florida. After crossing Florida, Hurricane Hunters showed a poor circulation, but with winds higher than tropical storm strength, and the system was designated as Tropical Storm \"Erika\" late on August 14 while located 85\u00a0miles (135\u00a0km) west of Fort Myers.\nWith well-established outflow and low levels of wind shear, Erika became stronger as the circulation became better defined. A high pressure system covered over the south-central United States, forcing the storm to move just south of due west at 25\u00a0mph (40\u00a0km/h). On August 15, convection were made into bands, and as its winds were turning into hurricane strength, an eye developed within the storm. The storm quickly weakened over the Sierra Madre Oriental, and Erika was calming down early on August 17. After entering the Gulf of California on August 18, It led to the formation of a tropical disturbance. It went to the northwest and weakened on August 20."}

Gandhara was largely Mahayana Buddhist, and was also a stronghold of Vajrayana Buddhism. The Swat Valley, known in antiquity as Uddiyana, was a kingdom tributary to Gandhara. There are many archaeological sites from the Buddhist era in Swat.\nThe Buddhist sage Padmasambhava is said to have been born in a village near the present day town of Chakdara in Lower Dir District, which was then a part of Uddiyana. Padmasambhava is known as Guru Rinpoche in Tibetan and it is he who introduced Vajrayana Buddhism in Tibet.\nBuddhism was also practiced in the Punjab and Sindh regions.\nMost Buddhists in Punjab converted to Hinduism from 600 AD onwards. Buddhism was the faith practiced by the majority of the population of Sindh up to the Arab conquest by the Umayyad Caliphate in 710 AD. After the partition of Pakistan and India, the Buddhists fled to India, similar to other faiths like Hindus, Sikhs, and Christians in the Pakistan region."}

The league has its roots in the original Big East Conference, which was founded in 1979 as a basketball-focused league by a group of schools in the Eastern U.S. That league added football in 1991, leading to years of conflict between schools that played top-level football and those that did not. In July 2013, the original league split along football lines. The seven schools that did not play FBS (top-level) football\u2014often called the \"Catholic 7\" because all are run by the Catholic Church\u2014bought the \"Big East\" name and formed a new Big East. The FBS schools joined with several new members and stayed in the original Big East structure under the new name of American Athletic Conference (The American).\nAlthough the current Big East was not founded until 2013, it claims the 1979 founding date of the original Big East. Both the current Big East and The American claim the pre-split history of the old Big East.\nMembers.\nThe 10 schools that formed the current Big East are private schools. All of these are also Catholic except for Butler, which was started by Protestants but has never been run by any church. UConn (Connecticut) became the Big East's first public school in July 2020.\nAssociate members.\nThe Big East has five \"associate members\" that play either one or two sports in the conference.\nFormer members.\nNo full member of the Big East has left for another conference. However, eight associate members have left the Big East in one or more sports, with five entirely leaving the Big East.\nTwo schools that were associate members in the 2013\u201314 school year left to join conferences that play the sports that they housed in the Big East. Five women's lacrosse members left after the 2017\u201318 school year when the American Athletic Conference, full-time home to three of those schools, started a women's lacrosse league. Two of these schools, Temple and UConn, stayed in the Big East in field hockey, and UConn returned to the Big East full-time in July 2020. At the same time, Old Dominion moved its women's lacrosse team from the Big East to The American. This kept both conferences at six women's lacrosse members, the number needed to ensure that their conference champions would receive places in the NCAA Division I tournament. ODU is still a Big East member in field hockey."}

Jan van Steenbergen, a linguist and translator from the Netherlands, made it in 2002. The idea behind it is this: what would have happened if the Polish language had developed from Latin instead of Old Slavic? Wenedyk is a possible answer to that question. It is a Romance language, so almost all words are family of words in French, Italian, Romanian, and so on. But they look very different and much more like Polish. The rules for spelling and pronunciation are completely based on Polish. Other parts of the language, like grammar and sentence structure, are a mixture of Polish and Romance.\nTogether with other made-up languages like Brithenig (which does the same thing with Welsh), Wenedyk is part of the group of so-called \"alternative languages\", languages that could have existed if history had been different. With Brithenig, it is the best known example of this sort of languages. Wenedyk became known in Poland after it was written about on the Internet and in the monthly paper \"Wiedza i \u017bycie\" (\"Knowledge and Life\").\nWenedyk is used in Ill Bethisad, a made-up world in which the Roman Empire was stronger than in real history. It is the most important language of the Republic of the Two Crowns, a country similar to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, but not broken up by partitions like Poland was.\nSpelling and pronunciation.\nWenedyk uses the same letters as Polish does:\nAlso, there are seven sounds written by two letters:\nWenedyk is pronounced just like Polish. Stress almost always falls on the second-last syllable. A preposition and a pronoun are treated as one word, so when the pronoun has only one syllable, the preposition is stressed.\nGrammar.\nWenedyk does not have articles, words like \"a\" and \"the\". This is an important difference with the other Romance languages and also with made-up languages like Esperanto and Ido. The reason is that Polish and most other Slavic languages do not have those words, and even in Vulgar Latin they were not so strong yet.\nWords in Wenedyk can have many forms. English words have only a few (cat, cat's, cats; work, working, works, worked), but in Wenedyk a lot of forms exist where English would have used other words, like prepositions or modal verbs. In the case of nouns, pronouns and adjectives these forms are called \"cases\". Wenedyk has three cases:\nWenedyk also has a \"vocative\" (used for calling someone). Often it has the same form as the direct case, but not always: O potrze! \"Oh father!\"\nThere are three genders and four declensions (different ways of making forms). They are very much like the declensions in Latin:\nHere is a chart of the pronouns (words like I, you, we, they, and so on) in Wenedyk:\nVerbs have a lot of forms, too. Every pronoun has its own form:\nMost tenses have special forms:\nWord list.\nThe word list of Wenedyk, made public on the internet, has more than 4000 words. This chart of 30 words shows what Wenedyk looks like when compared to other Romance languages:\nSamples.\nThe Lord's Prayer:"}

It is often abbreviated as \"KU\".\nKU held its first classes in 1866. As of Spring 2011, over 30,000 students attended school there.\nHistory.\nThere was a plan to build a university in Kansas in 1855, but it didn't happen until Kansas became a state in 1861. The Kansas government needed to decide where to build the university. Their choices were Manhattan, Emporia, or Lawrence. On January 13, 1863, Kansas State University was built in Manhattan. The only cities left were Emporia and Lawrence. Amos A. Lawrence gave $10,000 and more than 40 acres (160,000\u00a0m2) of land for a university in Lawrence. The Kansas government liked that, so the government chose Lawrence.\nOn February 20, 1863, Kansas Governor Thomas Carney signed into law a bill creating the state university in Lawrence. The law was made if Lawrence gave a gift of a $15,000 endowment fund and a place for the university. The place would need to be in or near the town, of not less than forty acres (16 ha) of land.\nOn November 2, 1863, Governor Carney said Lawrence had met the conditions to get the state university. In 1864, the university was officially organized.\nThe university opened for classes on September 12, 1866, and the first class graduated in 1873.\nAcademics.\nSchool of Business.\nThe University of Kansas School of Business is a public business school on the main campus in Lawrence. The KU School of Business was created in 1924. It has more than 80 staff members, and it has about 1500 students.\nIt was named one of the best business schools in the Midwest by \"Princeton Review\". The KU School of Business has been credited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) for its undergraduate and graduate programs in business and accounting.\nSchool of Law.\nThe University of Kansas School of Law was created in 1878. It was the top law school in the state of Kansas. The 2016 \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" \"U.S. News Best Colleges Rankings\" says that it was the 65th best law school in the United States. Classes are held in Green Hall at W 15th St and Burdick Dr, which is named after former dean James Green.\nSchool of Engineering.\nThe KU School of Engineering is a public engineering school on the main campus in Lawrence. The School of Engineering was officially created in 1891, although engineering degrees were awarded as early as 1873.\nThe \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\"'s \"America\u2019s Best Colleges\" 2016 issue says that KU's School of Engineering was the 90th best engineering school in the United States.\nFamous alumni include: Alan Mulally (BS/MS), former President and CEO of Ford Motor Company, Lou Montulli, co-founder of Netscape and author of the Lynx web browser, Brian McClendon (BSEE 1986), VP of Engineering at Google, and Charles E. Spahr (1934), former CEO of Standard Oil of Ohio.\nEdwards Campus.\nThe KU Edwards Campus is in Overland Park, Kansas. It was created in 1993. It was created in order to provide adults with a chance to get college degrees and to get better education. About 2,000 students go there. The average age of the students is 31. The Edwards campus provides programs developmental psychology, public administration, social work, systems analysis, engineering management and design.\nTuition.\nStudents enrolled in 6 or more credit hours paid a yearly required campus fee of $888. The schools of architecture, music, arts, business, education, engineering, journalism, law, pharmacy, and social welfare charge more fees.\n, the yearly tuition for 30 credit hours for a freshman is estimated by the university to be $10,182. This does not include room and board costs.\nSports.\nKansas' athletics teams are called the Jayhawks. Kansas has 16 varsity teams, all of which compete in the Big 12 Conference. They are known for their men's basketball team, which most recently won a national championship in 2008.\nOther locations.\nThe KU Medical Center, which is one branch of the University of Kansas, is located in Kansas City, Kansas, which is east of Lawrence. Another branch of KU, called the Edwards Campus, is located in Overland Park, Kansas.\nStudent Activities.\nDebate.\nThe University of Kansas has had more teams (70) compete in the National Debate Tournament than any other university. Kansas has won the tournament 6 times (1954, 1970, 1976, 1983, 2009 and 2018)\nMedia.\nThe University of Kansas's newspaper is \"The University Daily Kansan\"."}

{"id": "116173", "revid": "1110", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=116173", "title": "Western Athletic Conference", "text": "The Western Athletic Conference (WAC) is a group of colleges and universities, mostly in the Western United States, that play NCAA Division I sports against one another each season.\nThe WAC currently has 10 member schools:\nIts future is now in serious question due to a wave of departures set for July 2013.\nHistory.\nCreation.\nThe WAC was formed in 1962 by six western schools\u2014the University of Arizona, Arizona State University, Brigham Young University (BYU), the University of New Mexico, the University of Utah, and the University of Wyoming. Three other schools, the University of Oregon, Oregon State University, and Washington State University, were part of the original discussions, but chose to join what is now the Pacific-12 Conference. New Mexico State and Utah State applied for charter membership, but were turned down, and would not join until 2005.\nFirst expansion.\nThe WAC grew to eight members in 1967, when Colorado State University and the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) joined. However, in the 1970s, massive population growth in Arizona led to the two Arizona schools dominating the conference, especially in football. Arizona and Arizona State left for the Pacific-8 Conference in 1978, which then became the Pacific-10 (now the Pacific-12). The WAC reloaded by adding San Diego State University in 1978, the University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa (Hawai\u02bbi) in 1979, and the United States Air Force Academy (Air Force) in 1980. This nine-team lineup defined the WAC for the next 15 years.\nSecond expansion.\nIn 1990, the WAC added women's sports when it absorbed the High Country Athletic Conference, a women's sports conference that included most of the schools then in the WAC. Two years later, California State University, Fresno (Fresno State) joined the WAC. Several years later, the demise of the Southwest Conference (SWC) led to many schools changing conferences. In 1996, six schools joined the WAC. Three of them\u2014Rice University, Southern Methodist University (SMU), and Texas Christian University (TCU)\u2014were from the SWC. The others were San Jose State and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), both from the Big West Conference, and the University of Tulsa from the Missouri Valley Conference. At the same time, Air Force and Hawai\u02bbi brought their women's sports into the WAC. These moves meant that the WAC now had 16 members.\nBreakup.\nMost of the pre-1990 members were soon unhappy in a 16-team league. The conference now ranged from Hawaii to Oklahoma, spanning five time zones and , making travel costs a major concern. In 1999, the conference split largely along pre-1990 and post-1990 lines. Seven of the pre-1990 members\u2014Air Force, BYU, Colorado State, New Mexico, San Diego State, Utah, and Wyoming\u2014joined with newcomer UNLV to form the Mountain West Conference (MW).\nIn the 2000s.\nThe post-breakup WAC quickly added a new member in the University of Nevada, Reno (Nevada), which joined from the Big West in 2000. Later that year, the Big West announced that it would no longer play football. Four of that conference's schools\u2014Boise State University, the University of Idaho, New Mexico State University, and Utah State University\u2014wanted to keep playing football. Boise State was immediately accepted by the WAC, joining in 2001. Louisiana Tech University also joined the WAC alongside Boise State. The three other Big West football schools did not join the WAC at that time.\nLater in the 2000s, the WAC was affected by another wave of conference realignment. After the Big East Conference lost three of its members to the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) in 2004 and 2005, it reloaded by \"raiding\" Conference USA (C-USA). In turn, C-USA sought new members from other conferences, and four WAC schools\u2014Rice, SMU, TCU, and Tulsa\u2014accepted invitations to join C-USA in 2005. The WAC responded by adding the three other schools that had played Big West football (Idaho, New Mexico State, and Utah State).\nTurmoil and possible demise.\nAnother major cycle of conference realignment began in 2010 when the Big Ten Conference and the then-Pacific-10 announced plans to expand. This started a chain of moves that affected all eleven conferences that play football in the top-level Division I FBS. No conference was more affected than the WAC, whose future as a Division I conference is now in serious doubt.\nThe first move affecting the WAC came in June 2010. After the MW lost Utah to the Pacific-12, Boise State accepted an invitation to join the MW in 2011. Two months later, BYU also left the MW, which responded by inviting two WAC members, Fresno State and Nevada. Both accepted, and would leave for the MW in 2012.\nIn November 2010, Denver, Texas State, and UTSA were invited to join the WAC in 2012, with all accepting. In the same month, Hawai\u02bbi announced it would leave the WAC in 2012 to join the Big West for most sports and the MW for football. The summer of 2011 saw two other schools accept invitations to join in 2012\u2014Seattle and UT Arlington. These moves meant that for the first time in WAC history, the conference would have non-football members, as Denver, Seattle, and UT Arlington do not have football teams. One month later, Boise State announced that it would rejoin the WAC for most of its sports in 2013, with its football team moving to the Big East.\nHowever, the WAC suffered major blows in spring 2012, with five members stating they would leave in July 2013. Three of the new 2012 members will spend only one year in the WAC\u2014UTSA will join C-USA, and Texas State and UT Arlington will move to the Sun Belt Conference. Louisiana Tech will also join C-USA, while San Jose State and Utah State will join the MW. Making matters worse for the WAC, Boise State decided not to join the WAC in 2013, instead choosing to put its non-football sports in the Big West.\nThese moves will leave the WAC with four members in 2013\u2014fewer than the six required by the NCAA for full Division I membership."}

It is a tool to show the relationship between the inputs and the outputs of a system. There are different ways to do this. Better curve fitting usually needs more complex calculations. \n\"Data modeling\" can be used without knowing about the underlying processes that have generated the data; in this case the model is an empirical model. Moreover, in modelling, knowledge of the probability distribution of the errors is not required. \"Regression analysis\" requires assumptions to be made regarding probability distribution of the errors. Statistical tests are made on the basis of these assumptions. In regression analysis the term \"model\" embraces both the function used to model the data and the assumptions concerning probability distributions.\nRegression can be used for prediction (including forecasting of time-series data), inference, hypothesis testing, and modeling of causal relationships. These uses of regression rely heavily on the underlying assumptions being satisfied. Regression analysis has been criticized as being misused for these purposes in many cases where the appropriate assumptions cannot be verified to hold. One factor contributing to the misuse of regression is that it can take considerably more skill to critique a model than to fit a model.\nThe first type of regression analysis was linear regression.

Most often, forensics is about proving that someone was present at a place where a crime was committed. Specialists take \"samples\" which are later analyzed in a laboratory. Most forensic tests can take from 1 hour to one year, and investigators need to double (and triple) check the answer, so they know that the answer is the right answer. If a forensics team made a mistake the wrong person could be jailed, or they could get into trouble themselves.\nSamples commonly taken include fingerprints. People also look for other things that could be used, for example a few hairs (or pieces of skin). Samples like hair or skin can be use for DNA testing, which allows to tell the gender of the person the hair is from, amongst others. \nWhen someone is accused of committing the crime, these pieces of evidence can then be matched up. Then, if they are correct, the person is charged."}

He was described as \"a genius who almost single-handedly created the foundations for modern statistical science\". Richard Dawkins described him as \"the greatest of Darwin's successors\".\nProfessional years.\nIn 1919 Fisher started work at Rothamsted Experimental Station at Harpenden, Hertfordshire, England. Here he started a major study of the extensive collections of data recorded over many years. This resulted in a series of reports under the general title \"Studies in crop variation.\"\nThis began a period of great productivity. Over the next seven years, he pioneered the principles of the design of experiments and elaborated his studies of the analysis of variance. He studied the statistics of small samples. Perhaps even more important, he began his systematic approach of the analysis of real data as the springboard for the development of new statistical methods.\nHe began to pay particular attention to the labour involved in the necessary computations, and developed practical methods. In 1925, his first book was published: \"Statistical methods for research workers\". This went into many editions and translations in later years, and became a standard reference work for scientists in many disciplines. In 1935, this was followed by \"The design of experiments,\" which also became a standard.\nHis work on the theory of population genetics made him one of the three great figures of that field, together with Sewall Wright and J.B.S. Haldane. He was one of the founders of the neo-Darwinian modern evolutionary synthesis. In addition to founding modern quantitative genetics with his 1918 paper, he was the first to use diffusion equations to attempt to calculate the distribution of gene frequencies among populations.\nHe pioneered the estimation of genetic linkage and gene frequencies by maximum likelihood methods. His 1950 paper on gene frequency clines is notable as the first application of a computer to biology.\nFisher had a long and successful collaboration with E.B. Ford in the field of ecological genetics. The outcome of this work was the recognition that the force of natural selection was often much stronger than had been appreciated. Many ecogenetic situations (such as polymorphism) were not selectively neutral, on the contrary, they were maintained by the force of selection.\nFisher was the original author of the idea of heterozygote advantage, which was later found to play a frequent role in genetic polymorphism. The discovery of indisputable cases of natural selection in nature was one of the main strands in the modern evolutionary synthesis.\nFisher's genetical theory and eugenics.\nFisher was an ardent promoter of eugenics, and he held the Chair in Eugenics at University College London from 1933 until he moved to Cambridge University as Professor of Genetics in 1943.\nBetween 1929 and 1934 the Eugenics Society also campaigned hard for a law permitting sterilisation on eugenic grounds. They believed that it should be entirely voluntary, and a right, not a punishment. They published a draft of a proposed bill, and it was submitted to Parliament. Although it was defeated by a 2:1 ratio, this was viewed as progress, and the campaign continued. Fisher played a major role in this movement, and served in several official committees to promote it.\nIn 1934, Fisher moved to increase the power of scientists within the Eugenics Society, but was ultimately thwarted by members with an environmentalist point of view, and he, along with many other scientists, resigned.\nFisher's books.\nFisher wrote three books of great significance.\n\"The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection\".\nHis book \"The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection\" was started in 1928 and published in 1930, with a second edition in 1950. He developed ideas on sexual selection, mimicry and the evolution of dominance. He showed that the probability of a mutation increasing the fitness of an organism decreases proportionately with the magnitude of the mutation. He also proved that larger populations carry more variation and have a larger chance of survival. He set forth the foundations of what was to become known as population genetics.\nAbout a third of the book concerned the applications of these ideas to humans, and presented the data available at that time. He presented a theory that attributed the decline and fall of civilizations to the fertility of the upper classes being low. Using the census data of 1911 for Britain, he showed that there was an inverse relationship between fertility and social class. This was partly due, he believed, to the rise in social status of families who were not capable of producing many children but who rose because of the financial advantage of having a small number of children.\nTherefore he proposed the abolishment of the economic advantage of small families by instituting subsidies (he called them allowances) to families with larger numbers of children, with the allowances proportional to the earnings of the father. He himself had two sons and six daughters. According to Yates and Mather, \"His large family, reared in conditions of great financial stringency, was a personal expression of his genetic and evolutionary convictions\".\nThe book was reviewed, among others, by physicist Charles Galton Darwin, a grandson of Charles Darwin's. After his review, C.G. Darwin sent Fisher his copy of the book, with notes in the margin. The marginal notes became the food for a correspondence running at least three years. Fisher's book also had a major influence on W.D. Hamilton and the development of his theories on the genetic basis for kin selection.\n\"Statistical Methods for Research Workers\".\n\"Statistical Methods for Research Workers\" () is a classic 1925 book on statistics by Fisher. It is one of the 20th century's most influential books on statistical methods. According to Conniffe,\nRonald A. Fisher was \"interested in application and in the popularization\nof statistical methods... his early book \"Statistical Methods for Research Workers\", published in 1925, went through many editions and influenced the practical use of statistics in many fields of\nstudy.\n\"Design of Experiments\".\nFisher's \"Design of Experiments\" (1935) was \"also fundamental, [and promoted] statistical technique and application... The mathematical justification of the methods was not stressed and proofs were often barely sketched or omitted altogether ... [This] led H.B. Mann to fill the gaps with a rigorous mathematical treatment in his treatise\"."}

It was written by Sun Tzu, a high-ranking military general, strategist and Taoist philosopher. The text contains 13 chapters. Each chapter covers one of warfare. The book was written over 2,500 years ago. \"The Art of War\" was one of the earliest books on Chinese warfare. It remains one of the best known and most influential books ever written. The book was widely copied in the ancient world. At first it was written on bamboo slats that were sewn together. It was read by politicians, scholars and military leaders. Translations of the book were first read in Japan and Korea. The oldest copy from Japan dates to the 8th century. It was translated into French in 1772 by a Jesuit named Jean Joseph Marie Amiot. The first translation into English was published by Lionel Giles in 1910. \"The Art of War\" was first translated into Russian in 1950. Due to the Russian knowledge of French culture is it probable they had copies in French much earlier. It is used today by business schools and militaries worldwide.\nChanging the rules.\nWhen Sun Tzu first wrote \"The Art of War\", it was not the first book on military tactics. He quotes from \"The Book of Military Administration\" by Chun Cheng. The quote is limited to the use of signal flags and drums to move soldiers. Chun cheng's book has not survived to the present day so little is known of what else was in it. But books of that time were based on rules of warfare that all sides followed. War was the sport of rich noblemen. The rules were based on chivalry. Sun Tzu refused to see war as a sport. He used Taoist principles and applied them to warfare. In doing this he changed the rules of war. Unlike generals who enjoyed long campaigns, he understood war was serious. Sun Tzu believed that once a war started, the goal was to defeat the enemy. Sun Tzu was unconventional in that he didn't follow the prevailing wisdom of his time. Other generals were simply unprepared for Sun Tzu's tactics. Sun Tzu mastered the art of being unpredictable in warfare.\nDavid versus Goliath.\nIn situations where a smaller weaker force is faced with a stronger larger force, Sun Tzu's tactics are very often successful. David and Goliath is a Biblical story of a weaker shepherd boy facing a giant who is a skilled warrior. David uses an unconventional weapon and slays Goliath. David refused to fight by Goliath's rules. Political scientist Ivan Arregu\u00edn-Toft did calculations on wars. He discovered that about a third of the time the weaker country actually wins.\n\"The Art of War\" is credited by Mao Zedong as having helped him defeat Chiang Kai-Shek in the Chinese Civil War. Ho Chi Minh was a fan of Sun Tzu. He led the Communist Vietnamese in their fight against American-backed South Vietnam. American generals Norman Schwarzkopf, Jr. and Colin Powell followed principals in \"The Art of War\" in the Gulf War."}

He was a founder of population genetics, and contributed to evolutionary theory. He also did original work in statistics in a field called path analysis. \nWith R.A. Fisher and J.B.S. Haldane, he was a founder of theoretical population genetics. He is the discoverer of the inbreeding coefficient and of methods of computing it in pedigrees. He extended this work to populations, calculating the degree of inbreeding of members of populations as a result of random genetic drift. Together with Fisher, he pioneered methods for calculating the distribution of gene frequencies among populations as a result of the interaction of natural selection, mutation, migration and genetic drift. The work of Fisher, Wright, and Haldane on theoretical population genetics was a major step in the development of the modern evolutionary synthesis of genetics with evolution. Wright also made contributions to mammalian genetics and biochemical genetics.\nGenetic drift.\nWhat appears to happen in evolution is that the rate of change in any organism varies a lot. There seem to be times when change is rapid, and times when almost no change occurs. \nWright tried to explain \"stasis\", which is when no visible change occurs. His explanation was that organisms come to occupy \"adaptive peaks\". In order to evolve to another, higher peak, the species would first have to pass through a valley of maladaptive intermediate stages. In other words, they get stuck on one peak, and can't get to another because getting there would make them less competitive.\nWright though getting to another peak might be possible. It might happen by genetic drift if the population is small enough. If a species was divided into small populations, some could find higher peaks. If there was some gene flow between the populations, these adaptations could spread to the rest of the species. This was Wright's \"shifting balance theory\" of evolution. There has been much skepticism among evolutionary biologists as to whether this happens in natural populations. Wright had a long standing and sometimes bitter debate about this with R.A. Fisher, who felt that most populations in nature were too large for the effects of genetic drift to be important. Research by Dobzhansky and E.B. Ford showed that natural selection in the field was a much stronger force that Wright had expected. Wright's own biographer now doubts the validity of Wright's idea.\nAnecdote.\nAn anecdote about Wright, disclaimed by Wright himself, describes a lecture during which Wright tucked an unruly guinea pig under his armpit, where he usually held a chalkboard eraser: at the end of the lecture, Wright absent-mindedly erased the blackboard with the guinea pig."}

The conference was formed in 1976, and started playing football in 2001. Of the current 12 full members (those playing most of their sports in the league), 10 play football in the top-level Division I FBS. The other two do not play football. The conference's full members are scattered through the southern United States.\nMembers.\nThe current non-football members are Little Rock and UT Arlington.\nFuture members.\nThe Sun Belt announced four new members in a two-week span in October and November 2021, all of which sponsor football. Old Dominion, which had been a Sun Belt member from 1982 to 1991, will rejoin, and three more schools will join for the first time. All are scheduled to join no later than July 2023.\nAssociate members.\nIn the past, the Sun Belt has had \"associate members\" that play only a few sports, usually one, in the league, but has had none since it shut down its men's soccer league after the 2020\u201321 school year.\nThe first school to abandon single-sport membership was Utah State, which played Sun Belt football in 2003 and 2004 before joining the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) in 2005. The Aggies have been members of the Mountain West Conference since 2013.\nIdaho and New Mexico State had two different periods of involvement in the league. New Mexico State first joined the Sun Belt as a full member in 2000, and brought its football team into the Sun Belt the next year. Also in 2001, Idaho joined only for football. Both left in 2005 to join the WAC. During the early 2010s, NCAA Division I went through a major phase of conference changes, with most leagues gaining or losing multiple members. The WAC was one of the most affected conferences, going through a nearly complete membership turnover that left Idaho and New Mexico State as the league's only football schools. In 2014, both placed their football programs in the Sun Belt. The conference announced in 2016 that its agreements for Idaho and New Mexico State to play football in the league would not be renewed when they ended after the 2017 season.\nNJIT (the New Jersey Institute of Technology) was another victim of this realignment; it was forced to become an independent (not in a conference) when its former league, the Great West Conference, collapsed. Its men's soccer team joined the Sun Belt in 2014, a year before the school found a home in the ASUN Conference. Although the ASUN sponsors men's soccer, NJIT kept that team in the Sun Belt until 2016, honoring its two-year contract to play in that league.\nAnother recent change involved Hartwick, which had long competed in Division I men's soccer despite otherwise being in NCAA Division III. In 2018, Hartwick aligned completely with Division III, moving its men's soccer team to its full-time home of the Empire 8.\nThe most recent changes came in 2021, when the Sun Belt shut down its men's soccer league after it dropped below the number of members needed to keep the automatic berth its champion received in the NCAA tournament."}

However, because of money issues, the conferences backed away from a full merger. They planned to form an alliance for scheduling and television purposes. After both conferences added more schools, they backed out of the planned alliance. \nCurrent members.\nEleven schools are \"full members\", meaning that they play almost all of their sports in the MW.\nAssociate members.\nTwo schools are \"associate members\", meaning that they play in the MW in some sports while playing most other sports in another league.

If a Charizard is angry, the flame at the tip of its tail can be a whitish-blue color. Because of their crazy behavior, Charizard are also known to cause wildfires by accident.They can easily fly well over 4,600 feet in the air.\nGames.\nCharizard has appeared many times in the Super Smash Bros. (series). Charizard first appears as a non-playable character in \"Super Smash Bros.\" and \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\", as one of the Pok\u00e9mon that come if a player uses a Pok\u00e9 Ball. In \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\" Charizard is now playable, under the command of the Pok\u00e9mon Trainer. The Trainer also has a Squirtle and an Ivysaur, that you can swich from at any time. It can use Flamethrower and Rock Smash. It also uses Fly and has the ability to glide. Charizard is a Heavyweight and attacks with many physical attacks. It uses Fire Blast in Pok\u00e9mon Trainer's Final Smash, Triple Finish.\nReception and legacy.\nDescribed by the media as \"a lean, ferocious, fire-breathing dragon [...] sleek, powerful, and utterly destructive\", Charizard has been noted as one of the franchise's most popular characters. People who sell toys have noted that the high sales of merchandise related to the character to the popularity of the character's dragon-like design with children. Interviewed children have stated similar; they attributed its appeal to its \"cool looking\" appearance and associating the character with the concepts of stubbornness and power. GamesRadar described Charizard as \"hands-down one of the coolest Pok\u00e9mon out there\", heavily praising its character design and calling it \"one of the coolest\" designs of the entire series. IGN editor \"pokemonofthedaychick\" called Charizard \"certainly the most popular and perhaps the most well-balanced of any of the current starting Pok\u00e9mon\". The book \"Pikachu's Global Adventure: The Rise and Fall of Pok\u00e9mon\" cited Charizard as popular with older male children who tend to be drawn to \"tough or scary\" characters, and compared the character's evolution from Charmander into Charizard with the loss of \"cuteness\" as one leaves childhood. The book \"Rebuilding Attachments With Traumatized Children\" stated psychiatrists utilized the character as an empowered character traumatized children who were fans of the \"Pok\u00e9mon\" series could relate to. In 2005, search engine Yahoo! reported Charizard as one of the top Pok\u00e9mon-related web searches.\nDue to Charizard's appeal, it has been featured in lines of soft toys and action figures in the \"Pok\u00e9mon\" franchise, made by Hasbro, and Tomy. In 2004, the \"Charizard Medium Plush\" was part of a major recall of 13 plush toys due to a manufacturing fault where tips of needles were being found with the stuffing. This caused Tomy to replace the toys with compensation or replacements. Charizard appears often in the \"Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game\", most notably in the series' initial release. Cards featuring the character have been stated to be the most desired of the series, quickly rising to high prices among collectors and retailers. These cards were extremely powerful and knocked out opponents in one hit."}

He retired in 2007 as England's most successful tennis player of the last twenty years.\nPersonal life.\nHenman comes from a sporting family. His mother and father were both interested in tennis and his grandfather played at Wimbledon in the 1940s and 50s. His grandmother also played mixed doubles at Wimbledon with his grandfather on two occasions.\nHenman got 10 GCSEs at school and went into tennis training afterwards. He was told by doctors he had a type of bone disease in 1992. He carried on playing tennis anyway and he became professional aged 18 in 1992. In 1999 Henman married his long-term girlfriend Lucy Heald. The couple have three daughters: Rose, Olivia and Grace.\nPlaying career.\nHenman moved up the rankings very fast. By 1994, one year after becoming professional, he was 200th in the world.\nBy 1996 he was in the top thirty. In 1995 he became the first player ever to be disqualified from the Wimbledon tournament. Because he was angry during a match he hit the ball very hard at a ball girl and it hit her on the head.\nIn 1998, he was ranked one of the ten best tennis players in the world. In the same year he also reached the Wimbledon semi-final. In 2001 he had a good year at Wimbledon beating Roger Federer in straight sets. He reached the semi final only to be beaten by eventual winner Goran Ivani\u0161evi\u0107. In 2004 he reached the semi finals of Roland Garros in France but lost to Guillermo Coria. Towards the end of his career Henman did not play so well. He ended up falling to 63 in the world rankings. In 2005 he was knocked out of the second round of Wimbledon by Roger Federer. He also had a lot of injuries at this time, including many at important points in matches.\nHe got an OBE in 2003 and was painted by royal artist Christian Furr in 2005.\nHenman's last Wimbledon was a disappointment.

The federal government moved in 1959 from Karachi to Rawalpindi (provisional capital until Islamabad was finished), whilst the federal legislature moved to DACCA.\nWest Pakistan formed a block whose people seemed homogeneous (similar to each other).

The \"One Unit Policy\" was regarded as a rational administrative reform which would reduce spending and eliminate provincial prejudices. However with the military coup of 1958, trouble loomed for the province when the office of Chief Minister was abolished and the President took over executive powers for West Pakistan.

{"id": "116343", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=116343", "title": "Kori Creek", "text": "The Kori Creek (, ) is a tidal creek and maritime Border dispute between the Kutch region of the Indian state of Gujarat and the Kachchhi region of the Pakistani province of Sindh. It is in the Rann of Kutch marshland east of the Sir Creek, which is disputed between India and Pakistan. It is a 96\u00a0km (60\u00a0mi) strip of water disputed between the Republic of India and Pakistan, claimed by India as a part of the Indian Rann of Kutch marshlands. The creek, which opens up into the Arabian Sea, divides the Kutch region of the Indian state of Gujarat with the Sindh province of Pakistan. \nThe long-standing dispute hinges in the actual demarcation \"from the mouth of Kori Creek to the top of Kori Creek, and from the top of Kori Creek eastward to a point on the line designated on the Western Terminus\". From this point onwards, the boundary is unambiguously fixed as defined by the Tribunal Award of 1968.\nThe creek itself is in the uninhabited marshlands. During the monsoon season between June and September, the creek floods its banks and envelops the low-lying salty mudflats around it. During the winter season, the area is home to flamingoes and other migratory birds.\nDispute.\nThe dispute is in the interpretation of the boundary line between Kutch and Sindh as depicted in a 1914 and 1925 map. At that time, the region was a part of Bombay Presidency of undivided India. After India's independence in 1947, Sindh became a part of Pakistan while Kutch became a part of India.\nThe resolution, which demarcated the boundaries between the two territories, included the creek as part of Sindh province, thus setting the boundary as the eastern flank of the creek. The boundary line, known as the \"Green Line\", is disputed by India which maintains that it is an indicative line, known as a \"ribbon line\" in technical jargon. India's position is that the boundary is mid-channel as depicted in another map drawn in 1925, and implemented by the installation of mid-channel pillars back in 1924.\nIndia supports its stance by citing the Thalweg Doctrine in International Law. The law states that river boundaries between two states may be, if the two states agree, divided by the mid-channel. Though Pakistan does not dispute the 1925 map, it maintains that the Doctrine is not applicable in this case as it only applies to bodies of water that are navigable, which the Kori Creek is not. India rejects the Pakistani stance by maintaining the fact that the creek is navigable in high tide, and that fishing trawlers use it to go out to sea. Several cartographic surveys conducted have supported the Indian claim. Another point of concern for Pakistan is that Kori Creek has changed its course considerably over the years. If the boundary line is demarcated (outlined) according to the Thalweg principle, Pakistan stands to lose a considerable portion of the territory that was historically part of the province of Sindh. Accepting India's stance would also result in the shifting of the land/sea terminus (end) point several kilometres to the disadvantage of Pakistan, leading in turn to a loss of several thousand square kilometres of its Exclusive Economic Zone under the United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea.\nIn April 1965, a dispute there contributed to the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, when fighting broke out between India and Pakistan. Later the same year, British Prime Minister Harold Wilson persuaded both countries to set up a tribunal to resolve the dispute. A verdict was reached in 1968, which saw Pakistan getting 10% of its claim of 9,000\u00a0km\u00b2 (3,500 sq. miles).\nThe disputed region was at the center of international attention in 1999 after Mig-21 fighter planes of the Indian Air Force shot down a Pakistani Navy Breguet Atlantique surveillance aircraft over the Kori Creek on August 10, 1999, killing all 16 on board. India claimed that the plane had strayed into its airspace, which was disputed by the Pakistani navy. (See the Atlantique Incident)\nEconomic reasons.\nThough the Kori Creek has little military value, it holds immense economic gain. Much of the region is rich in oil and gas below the sea bed, and control over the creek would have a huge bearing on the energy potential of each nation. Also once the boundaries are defined, it would help in the determination of the maritime boundaries which are drawn as an extension of onshore reference points. Maritime boundaries also help in determining the limits of Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) and continental shelves. EEZs extend to 200 nautical miles (370\u00a0km) and can be subjected to commercial exploitation.\nThe demarcation would also prevent the inadvertent crossing over of fishermen of both nations into each others' territories.\nDispute resolution.\nThe Federal Government of Pakistan lays claim to the entire creek as per \"paras 9 and 10\" of the \"Bombay Government Resolution of 1914\" signed between the then provincial Government of Sindh and Rao Maharaj, then the ruler of the former Princely state of Kutch.\nHowever since 1969, there have been eight rounds of talks between the two nations, without a breakthrough. Steps to resolve the dispute include:\nSince neither side has conceded ground, India has proposed that the maritime boundary could be demarcated first, as per the provisions of Technical Aspects of Law of Sea (TALOS). However, Pakistan has firmly refused the proposal on the grounds that the dispute should be resolved first. Pakistan has also proposed that the two sides go in for international arbitration, which India has flatly refused. India maintains that all bilateral disputes should be resolved without the intervention of third-parties."}

He was one of the 20th century's leading evolutionary biologists. He was also a well-known taxonomist, tropical explorer, ornithologist, historian of science, and naturalist. He was a leading contributor to the modern evolutionary synthesis. He was especially interested in how new species formed.\nMayr joined the faculty of Harvard University in 1953, where he also served as director of the Museum of Comparative Zoology from 1961 to 1970. He retired in 1975 as emeritus professor of zoology, showered with honors.\nAfter his retirement, he went on to publish more than 200 articles, in a variety of journals\u2014more than some reputable scientists publish in their entire careers; 14 of his 25 books were published after he was 65. Even as a centenarian, he continued to write books.\nMayr was awarded the Linnean Society's prestigious Darwin-Wallace Medal in 1958. He was never awarded a Nobel Prize, because there is no such prize for evolutionary biology. He commented that Darwin would not have received one, either. Mayr did win a 1999 Crafoord Prize. That prize honors basic research in fields that do not qualify for Nobel awards, and is administered by the same organization as the Nobel Prize.\nSpeciation.\nNeither Darwin nor anyone else in his time knew the answer to the \"species problem\": how species could evolve from a single common ancestor.\nErnst Mayr approached the problem with a definition for the concept species. He wrote that a species is not just a group of individuals that look similar, but a group that can breed only among themselves.\nWhen populations of organisms get isolated, the sub-populations will start to differ as time goes by. This way, they will evolve into new species. The most rapid genetic reorganization occurs in small populations which have been isolated. This happens if a species gets trapped on an island, for example. Or, perhaps, if the species lives in more than one environment.\nToday, it is accepted that reproductive isolation is by far the most frequent cause of species splitting, and that geographical separation is the most frequent cause of this isolation. This was Mayr's most characteristic idea. Debate continues over the extent to which speciation occurs when a population is not so isolated."}

{"id": "116444", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=116444", "title": "Aberdeen F.C.", "text": "Aberdeen Football Club (also known as The Dons, The Reds and The Dandies) is a Scottish professional football club based in Aberdeen. They compete in the Scottish Premier League and are one of the most successful teams in their country, having won four league titles and seven Scottish Cups. They are also the only Scottish team to have won two European trophies, both in the same year.\nFormed in 1903 as a result of the amalgamation of three clubs from Aberdeen, they rarely challenged for honours until the 1950s, when they won each of the major Scottish trophies under manager Dave Halliday. This level of success was surpassed in the 1980s, when, under the management of Alex Ferguson, they won three league titles, four Scottish Cups and a Scottish League Cup, alongside the European honours. Aberdeen were the last club outside of the Old Firm to win a league title, in 1984\u201385.\nAberdeen have played at Pittodrie Stadium since their inception. The ground currently has a capacity of 22,199 and was the first all-seated and all-covered stadium in the United Kingdom. Pittodrie was also the first football stadium to feature a dugout, an invention of player and coach Donald Colman. The club's colours have been primarily red and white since 1939; before this, they played in black and gold vertical stripes.\nAberdeen attract support from the city and surrounding areas, as they are the only senior team within a wide area. Aberdeen have no geographically close rivals; their nearest neighbours at the same level are in the city of Dundee, with Dundee United having been their principal rivals in the New Firm in the 1980s. Rangers supplanted Dundee United as rivals in the late 1980s, but the rivalry, while fierce, does not approach that of the Old Firm.\nColours and crest.\nFor the 1904\u201305 season, Aberdeen adopted a black and gold striped shirt, which led to the team being nicknamed \"Wasps\". This strip, with only minor variations, was worn until just before the start of the Second World War. The blue shorts lasted until 1911, and then were replaced with white ones. Socks were black with gold trim, either as stripes or as a solid bar at the turndown.\nIn March 1939, Aberdeen changed the black and gold colours to red and white, reflecting the silver and red colours of the official City of Aberdeen arms. The first red strips were worn with white shorts, these were worn with either red or white socks from 1939 until the 1965\u201366 season. In 1966, Aberdeen adopted red shorts, making the official kit all-red, similar to that of Liverpool, who made a similar change at around the same time. This arrangement has continued to the present day, with several variations in design, in common with most senior clubs as the replica shirt market has expanded. In the late 1970s an Admiral strip featured five vertical white stripes on the left side of the shirt and shorts, and the early 1980s shirts\u2014as worn at the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup final\u2014featured white vertical pinstripes. Later design changes included significant amounts of blue, and a one season reversion to white shorts, although the all-red scheme returned in 1997.\nShirt sponsorship began in 1987, and the initial shirt sponsor was JVC. Since then, with the club making fewer appearances on the international stage, shirt sponsors have tended to be more local\u2014they have included one of the local commercial radio stations, Northsound. Aberdeen last season had announced their intention to move away from local sponsorship. Sponsored by Apex Tubulars at the time, that deal ended at the end of the 2007/08 season. In a turnaround though, Aberdeen FC Managing Director, Duncan Fraser, announced the side would bare the name of local company Team Recruitment on their shirts for the next two seasons. It is believed no international sponsor showed interest.\nChange, or \"away\", strips have tended to be either white, often with black shorts, or a combination of yellow and black, referring back to the black and gold strips of the pre-war era, although for a time in the 1970s, Aberdeen sported an all-blue change strip with white socks. For the 2007\u201308 season, the change strip is all-white, with a third kit of yellow and black halves available if needed for European games, or in the event of a clash involving both red and white.\nThe club did not have an official crest before 1972, but several variations on the letters AFC had from time to time featured on the shirt, usually in some kind of cursive font. In November 1972, the club unveiled an official crest or logo, designed by Aberdonian graphic designer Donald Addison. The design represented a capital letter \"A\" as the side view of a football goal, with a ball forming the crossbar of the letter. This ball was crosshatched in such a way as to depict it as being inside the net, signifying the scoring of a goal. The logo was completed by the letters \"FC\" in smaller type at a level with the ball element. This badge was used on the shirts from around 1978, with no significant alterations until the mid-1980s when the words \"Aberdeen Football Club\" were added in a circular border, and the date of the club's founding, 1903, was added under the goal element. The current version of the crest, which retains these elements in a unified design, was introduced at the start of the 1997\u201398 season. Two stars signifying the winning of the two European cups in 1983 were introduced over the badge in the 2005\u201306 season.\nStadium.\nAberdeen have played at Pittodrie Stadium, the name of which comes from the Pictish for \"place of manure\", throughout their existence. The ground was first used by the original Aberdeen F.C. in 1899, in a 7\u20131 win over Dumbarton; when they merged with two other teams in 1903, the new club took over the old Aberdeen ground. On August 15 1903, 8,000 spectators turned up to watch the new Aberdeen draw 1-1 against Stenhousemuir, the first game played at Pittodrie by its amalgamated tenants. The club initially rented the ground, but subsequently bought it in 1920. The stadium contains 21,600\u00a0seats, but due to the directors' boxes, some sources place this figure at 22,000. The record attendance occurred on March 13 1954, when 45,061 spectators turned up for a Scottish Cup match between Aberdeen and Hearts.\nThe stadium consists of four stands. The Main Stand, which houses the club offices and players facilities, holds the majority of the supporters. The Merkland Road Stand is primarily for families. The South Stand is opposite the main stand and a quarter of this section is used to accommodate travelling supporters, except for Old Firm games, where half of this stand is given to the visiting fans. The newest element is the Richard Donald stand at the East, or Beach End, of the ground, and is named after former chairman Dick Donald. This is a modern, two\u2013tier design, completed in 1993, containing hospitality suites which is significantly taller than the other structures at the ground. In 1978, Pittodrie became the first all covered, all-seater stadium in Britain.\nThe club are examining a move to a new stadium in Aberdeen.\nPlayers.\nAFC Hall of Fame.\nAberdeen inaugurated the Hall of Fame following the club's centenary celebrations in 2003. At the launch, it was claimed that over a five-year period, around 50\u00a0players and staff would be inducted. However, as of November 2007, the following initial inductees are still the only ones listed on the official website as members:\nManagers.\n\"List of full-time managers, as of 3 November 2012.

It explained how the discoveries of Gregor Mendel fit with Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by means of natural selection. Mendel found out how we inherit our genes.\nKey biologists who contributed work to the synthesis included: Julian Huxley, Theodosius Dobzhansky, Ernst Mayr, Ronald Fisher, J.B.S. Haldane, Sewall Wright, G.G. Simpson, E.B. Ford, Bernhard Rensch and G. Ledyard Stebbins.\nThe theory.\nThe modern synthesis brought Darwin's idea up to date. It bridged the gap between different types of biologists: geneticists, naturalists, and palaeontologists.\nIt states that:\nThe idea that new species occur after populations split has been much debated. Geographical isolation often leads to speciation. In plants, polyploidy must be included in any view of speciation. \nThis shows how some biologists see the synthesis.\nAlmost all aspects of the synthesis have been challenged at times, with varying degrees of success. There is no doubt, however, that the synthesis was a great landmark in evolutionary biology. It cleared up many confusions, and was directly responsible for stimulating a great deal of research after WWII.\nAfter the synthesis.\nSeveral discoveries in earth sciences and biology have arisen since the synthesis. Listed here are some of those topics which are relevant to the evolutionary synthesis, and which seem soundly based.\nUnderstanding of Earth history.\nThe Earth is the stage on which the evolutionary play is performed. Darwin studied evolution in the context of Charles Lyell's geology, but we now know more historical geology. \nConclusion: Our present knowledge of earth history strongly suggests that large-scale geophysical events influenced macroevolution and megaevolution. These terms refer to evolution above the species level, including such events as mass extinction, adaptive radiation, and the major transitions in evolution.\nFossil discoveries.\nStarting in the late 20th century scientists made excavations in parts of the world which had scarcely been investigated before. Also, there is fresh appreciation of fossils discovered in the 19th century, but not appreciated at the time. Many outstanding discoveries have been made, and some of these have implications for evolutionary theory.\nEvo-devo.\nImportant work on genetics has led to a new approach to animal development. The field is called evolutionary developmental biology, or evo-devo for short.\nThere is clear proof that much of development is closely controlled by special genetic systems involving hox genes. In his Nobel Prize lecture, E.B. Lewis said \"Ultimately, comparisons of the [control complexes] throughout the animal kingdom should provide a picture of how the organisms, as well as the [control genes] have evolved\".\nIn 2000, a special section of the \"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\" (PNAS) was devoted to evo-devo, and an entire 2005 issue of the \"Journal of Experimental Zoology Part B: Molecular and Developmental Evolution\" was devoted to the key evo-devo topics of evolutionary innovation and morphological novelty.\nA survey of the field for the general reader gives examples."}

As of May 2016, she was ranked World No. 170 in women's singles tennis and 179th in doubles. In 2008, she reached the Australian Open semi-finals and has been ranked as World No. 5 for both women's singles and doubles. She played tennis for Slovakia in an international competition called the Fed Cup, and also in the Olympic Games.\nAs of her retirement from professional tennis in July, 2017, her winnings total more than million. She has worked with coaches from the Sanchez-Casal Academy, namely Angel Gimenez and Eduardo Nicolas. Her Women's Tennis Association (WTA) Tour mentor, Martina Navratilova, was also her doubles partner in early 2004. Outside tennis, she has modeled clothes and has been in some television advertisements.\nPersonal life.\nHantuchov\u00e1's parents are both scientists. Her father, Igor Hantucha, is a computer science professor. Her mother, Mariane Hantuchov\u00e1, is a toxicologist. Daniela was taught to play tennis by her grandmother, Helena, when she was six years old. Helena used to be a Slovakian national champion. Even though Daniela practiced a lot at tennis, she studied hard at school as well. \nHantuchov\u00e1's parents were divorced in 2003. At the same time Hantuchov\u00e1 lost weight, and people became worried she was ill with anorexia. She said \"I have proved that physically I don't have any problems.\" \nHantuchov\u00e1 speaks three languages (German, Slovak, and English), and can play the piano. She has several hobbies, such as skiing and ice skating. She has been in several advertisements on television, such as the campaign for Sony with Ana Ivanovi\u0107 in July 2006. Hantuchov\u00e1 has also been in Italian \"Vogue\" magazine, as a model. She now lives in Monte Carlo, Monaco.\nPlaying style.\nHantuchov\u00e1 holds her racket in her right hand but uses both hands when playing backhand shots. She can hit the ball hard with both her forehand and backhand. She has a strong serve and can play well when close to the net. She is famous for her long legs which are long. Because she is so tall (), she can run a long way in a short amount of time, which also helps in returning shots, also adding power.\nProfessional career.\nHantuchov\u00e1 became a professional tennis player in 1989, when she was 15 years old. She started training in Florida, but still went back to Bratislava, Slovakia, to study. She won her first WTA tournament in 2000, a doubles title which she won in Bratislava. In 2001, she played her first Grand Slam tournament at the Australian Open. Hantuchov\u00e1 lost in her first match in Australia to Russian player Anna Kournikova. However, she won the mixed doubles tournament, playing with Czech player Leos Friedl. Hantuchov\u00e1 won her second WTA doubles competition by winning with Russian player Elena Bovina in Luxembourg. She finished the year in the top 100, and was given an award by the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) for being the best new player in 2001.\nIn 2002, Hantuchov\u00e1 lost in the quarter-final of both the Wimbledon Championships and the US Open.

In Pakistan's coastal regions of the Makran and delta marshlands of Sindh, it is known as the Indus crocodile. The name \"Mugger\" is a corruption of the Urdu word magar which means \"water monster\". It is one of three crocodilians in India, the others are the saltwater crocodile (\"C. porosus\") and gharial (\"Gavialis gangeticus\").\nMugger crocodile hatchlings are pale olive with black spots. Adults are dark olive to grey or brown. The head is rough without any ridges.\nThe mugger crocodile is a medium-sized crocodilian. It has a strong tail and webbed feet. It has good sense of smell, sight and hearing. Adult female muggers are 2 to 2.5 m (6 ft 7 in to 8 ft 2 in) on average. Adult male muggers are 3 to 3.5 m (9 ft 10 in to 11 ft 6 in). They rarely grow up to 5 m (16 ft 5 in). The largest known muggers measured 5.63 m (18 ft 6 in).\nDistribution and habitat.\nThe mugger crocodile can be found in southern Iran, Pakistan, Nepal, India and Sri Lanka, but is probably extinct in Bangladesh. It lives in freshwater lakes, rivers and marshes. It prefers slow-moving, shallow water bodies. It is also known to live in artificial reservoirs and irrigation canals.\nBehaviour.\nThe mugger crocodile is a very strong swimmer that uses its tail and hind feet to move forward, change direction and go under the water. Its belly touches the ground at the bottom of waterbodies and on land. During the hot dry season, it walks over land at night to find better wetlands. It spends most of the day under the water. During the cold season it basks on riverbanks and they tolerate one another during this period. They are more aggressive during the mating season.\nThe mugger crocodile has an optimal body temperature of 30 to 35 \u00b0C (86 to 95 \u00b0F). It will die of freezing or hyperthermia when exposed to temperatures below 5 \u00b0C (41 \u00b0F) or above 38 \u00b0C (100 \u00b0F). It digs burrows to get away from extreme temperatures. Burrows are between 0.6 and 6 m (2.0 and 19.7 ft) deep. Temperatures inside the burrows keep constant."}

It was invented centuries ago when grenades were heavy iron balls. Two main kinds of bowling arose. In one kind the bowler rolls a ball near a target and knocks away the ball of another bowler. This kind includes lawn bowling. \nIn the more common kind nowadays, the bowler rolls the ball down a wooden bowling lane trying to knock down bowling pins. This kind includes ten-pin bowling, which is so commonplace that it is often simply called \"bowling\". Some people bowl at smaller pins, called \"duck pins\" or \"candle pins\" with slightly different rules.\nTen-pin.\nThe usual kind of bowling ball has three holes, where the player puts two fingers and the thumb. The person on the lane swings the ball and lets it go to roll along the lane, attempting to knock down ten wooden pins. If the bowler does not do it right, the ball might not knock all the pins down or might roll into the gutter and hit none. Players take turns rolling their ball down the lane to see who gets the highest score.\nTen-pin bowling scores can be as low as 0 or as high as 300. Players get 10 chances to knock down all of the pins; each chance is called a frame. In each frame, players can try to knock down all of the pins up to two times. Players who do not knock down all of the pins after two tries get up to 9 points for the frame. One point is given for every pin knocked down, if any are knocked down at all. If players are able to knock down all of the pins on the first or second try, they are given 10 points for the frame plus bonus points. Frames in which a player knocks down all of the pins on the first try are scored as a strike. A strike is worth 10 points plus the number of pins knocked down by the player during their next two tries. If players do not score a strike but knock down all remaining on their second try, the frame is scored as a spare. A spare is worth 10 points plus the number of pins knocked down on the next try.\nPlayers who score a strike or spare on their 10th frame are allowed to roll the ball up to two additional times to score their bonus points. This is the only frame where it is possible to get a strike and a spare. It is also possible to roll 3 strikes in this frame."}

The highest attendance for the stadium is 35,632 against Rangers in a 1952 Scottish Cup match.\nToday, the stadium has an unbalanced look, with one large stand and three smaller stands. The biggest stand at the ground is the two-tiered \"South Stand\", which was built in 1993. Opposite is the small \"Davie Cooper Stand\", named after the former player, which was built in 1995. These two stands have their advertising slogans changed whenever the club's sponsor changes.\nRunning along one side of the ground is the \"East Stand\", which used to be a terrace until it was changed into a seating area. This stand had the legendary \"KEEP CIGARETTES AWAY FROM THE MATCH\" slogan displayed below the roof, facing the pitch. Since the smoking ban was put into place in 2006, slogans such as these were no longer needed, and in 2012, was changed to Cash Converters, the clubs main sponsor. The East stand is the stand of choice for many of the younger and passionate fans of the club.\nOpposite the \"East Stand\" is \"The Phil O'Donnell Stand\", which was known as the \"Main Stand\" until 2008. The stand was renamed \"The Phil O'Donnell Stand\" in honour of the late Motherwell captain who died on the Fir Park pitch.\nThis is a strange-looking stand, as the steel girders run for the full length of the pitch, but the stand only runs for two thirds the length of the pitch. This was because, in 1962, a nearby houseowner complained about the building of the stand during construction. Both the club and the houseowner failed to work things out, so to this day, the stand has not been built the full length of the pitch.\nGretna.\nDuring the 2007-08 season, Gretna F.C. rented Fir Park from Motherwell and played all but one of their home league games there."}

He designed the RMS Titanic. He was married and had a girl who was born in 1908. He died during the sinking of the Titanic in 1912. In the movie \"Titanic\" by James Cameron, he was portrayed by actor Victor Garber.\nMr. Thomas Andrews was enrolled into the Royal Belfast at age 11 and left at the age of 16 so that he could go and work for Harland and Wolf as a premium apprentice. At the end of his Apprentice he would be guaranteed a position at the shipyard. Mr. Andrews was made manager of the construction works in 1901; in 1901 he was awarded with the honor of being Manager Director. Andrews as a child had a rich home, good family and his parents were able to support him and his family very well. His father was a distinguished local politician and his mother Eliza was Lord William parries sister, his uncle was a high court judge and his brother who was to become Northern Irelands Prime Minister. Mr. Andrews was a first class passenger of the titanic and was born on February 7th 1873 and died on April 15th 1912 at sea. Mr. Andrews died while the ship was sinking; One of the most famous legends of the sinking of the Titanic is that he was last seen staring at the painting in the first class smoking room, making no attempt to save himself. But this story, which was published in a 1912 book (Thomas Andrews: Shipbuilder) and therefore perpetuated, came from John Stewart, a steward on the ship who in fact did leave the ship in boat n. 15 at approximately 1:40\u00a0a.m.\nThere were testimonies of sightings of Andrews after that moment. It appears that Andrews stayed in the smoking room for some time to gather his thoughts, then he continued assisting with the evacuation. Another reported sighting was of Andrews frantically throwing deck chairs into the ocean for passengers to use as floating devices. Andrews was then seen making his way to the bridge while carrying a lifebelt, possibly the same lifebelt Andrews had draped over a chair in the Smoke Room. Andrews was last seen leaving the ship at the last moment; his body was never recovered.\nNewspaper accounts of the disaster labeled Andrews a hero. Mary Sloan, a stewardess on the ship, whom Andrews persuaded to enter a lifeboat, later wrote in a letter: \"Mr. Andrews met his fate like a true hero, realizing the great danger, and gave up his life to save the women and children of the Titanic.\nIn January 1914 The Thomas Andrews Jr. Memorial Hall was opened in honor of the Very loved Thomas Andrews."}

Later they spread into other Asian countries, like (India), Japan and Korea. However, the kite only appeared in Europe around the year 1600\nThe first kites had sails made of paper or light fabrics such as silk. The poles were made from bamboo sticks, or other strong but flexible woods. The kite line was made from string or twine.\nModern kites are made from synthetic materials, such as ripstop nylon or more exotic fabrics on the sails. They have fiberglass or carbon fiber poles, and use dacron or dyneema for the kite lines. \nToday, there are different types of kites. Some are large and are made to look good. Some are smaller and are made for speed, children and competitions.\nAlso, there are many different types of kites. The most important types of kite are stunt kites and parafoil kites. However, they can come in a variety of sizes, types and designs.\nInflatable kites are made in an inflatable shape, animal or other design. The inflatable kite is one the few modern inventions in the world of kite design. \nThough the exact origin of kites are not known, it is known that they were flown in China and the Malay Archipelago two to three thousand years ago. The earliest written accounts of kite flying were the exploits of the Chinese general Han Hsin, Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-220 A.D.)."}

However, the west front is now Perpendicular, with its huge window filled with fragments of medieval glass. Sadly this glass window was destroyed by the Roundheads.They also messed up the bones of some of the most important rulers. Inside, only the crypt and the transepts have retained their Norman appearance. The spectacular Perpendicular nave with its tall arcade arches and strong vertical emphasis has been literally carved out of the original Norman interior. The Very Rev.

The support can be with money or giving something else useful, such as advertising, or time. A sponsor is the individual or group that gives the support, similar to a benefactor. A sponsor may also be a personal sponsor, a political sponsor or a state sponsor. There are many different kinds of sponsors.\nCommercial sponsor.\nA sponsor is one (usually a company) who gives cash, goods or services in return for promoting the sponsor's company. There is a distinct difference between sponsorship and philanthropy. A sponsor expects a return on investment (ROI), usually in the form of advertising. A philanthropist donates something as a charitable contribution. In sports, sponsors compete to advertise in the most popular sports. In India, sponsors all want to be associated with Cricket. It is much harder to find sponsors for other sports.\nLegislative sponsor.\nA sponsor or patron, usually a legislator, is someone who presents a bill or resolution for consideration. Others who join the sponsor are known as cosponsors or copatrons. In the United States Congress a sponsor is the first person listed among the lawmakers who introduce a bill to either the Senate or the House of Representatives. The process is very similar to sponsoring a bill in Parliament.\nPersonal sponsor.\nThis is someone who agrees to help another person or persons, and be responsible for them. For example, an employer may sponsor a foreign national to become a permanent resident of the United States by guaranteeing that person a job. Sponsorship can also mean an individual who helps an organization. Many charitable organizations offer personal sponsorship of a boy or girl to help them. Many public radio and television stations ask for sponsors to provide funds for them to operate. At a Ceremonial ship launching the person breaking the champagne bottle over the ship's bow is called the sponsor of that ship. In many religions, godparents are the baptized child's sponsors.\nState sponsorship.\nSponsorship is not always for the purposes of doing good. A state (or government) may sponsor terrorism for their own purposes. While not engaging in activities against another country (or countries) themselves, they may sponsor other groups to do it for them. The United States currently lists four countries who sponsor terrorism. They are: Cuba, Iran, Sudan, and Syria. State sponsors may also be called affiliates and/or supporters."}

{"id": "116689", "revid": "1110", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=116689", "title": "The Rake's Progress", "text": "The Rake's Progress is an opera by Igor Stravinsky. The libretto written by W. H. Auden and Chester Kallman is based loosely on the eight paintings and engravings from the 18th century by William Hogarth called \"A Rake's Progress\". Stravinsky had seen these paintings in 1947 at an exhibition in Chicago.\nThe Rake\u2019s Progress tells the story of a man called Tom Rakewell. The word \u201crake\u201d in this sense means \u201csomeone (usually a man) who behaves in an immoral way: a man who has relationships with lots of women. \nThe word \u201cprogress\u201d in the title is ironic because Tom does not really make progress: he does not become a better man. In a sense he progresses backwards, because he starts off in a state of blissful innocence, i.e. he does not understand anything about his life, he does not know about good and bad. At the end of the opera he also does not\nunderstand anything about his life, but that is because he has gone mad. \nTom is like Faust because he sells his soul to the devil. In this opera the character Nick Shadow represents the devil. Tom leaves his lover Anne Trulove and goes to find lots of other women in London. He has several adventures, which are all arranged by Nick who is helping him to have a good time. In the end Tom finds himself in Bedlam which was a horrible building where mad people were sent in the 18th century.\nMusical style.\nThe Rake\u2019s Progress is the only full-length opera that Stravinsky wrote. It is unusual because it was not written in the modern way of most music of the 1950s. Because the story of the opera is set in the 18th century, the style of the music is deliberately like music from that period. It is divided into arias and recitative (big songs which are linked with simpler music which tells the story).\nStravinsky\u2019s music in this opera is in the neoclassical style. He uses counterpoint a lot in this opera. This helped him later on to write serial music: music in which all 12 notes in an octave are equally important. Tom sings some words in the second act of The Rake\u2019s Progress which suggest that Stravinsky is going to widen his compositional style in this way: \u201cVary the song, O London, change!/Disband your notes and let them range\u201d.\nStory of the opera.\nAct 1.\nTom Rakewell wants to marry Anne Trulove. Her father does not trust Tom because he has no regular job. Tom would like to have lots of money. He meets Nick Shadow who tells him that an unknown uncle has died and left him lots of money. He says to Tom that he can be his servant and go with him to London to sort out his inheritance. \nNick takes Tom to places where there is a lot of bad, immoral behaviour. Tom agrees to spend the night with Mother Goose in her brothel. Meanwhile Anne, who lives in the country, wonders why she has not heard from Tom. She thinks something might have happened to him, so she goes to London to look for him.\nAct 2.\nTom is bored with his immoral way of life. He tells Nick he wants happiness, so Nick says he should marry Baba the Turk, a famous bearded lady. Soon afterwards Anne finds Tom's London house. She arrives just in time to see Tom get out of a sedan chair with Baba, whom he has just married. Tom tells Anne to leave, but he really is sorry for what has happened. \nIn the next scene Tom hates his marriage to Baba, who is a strange woman. She is a chatterbox with a fiery temper. He makes her quiet by throwing his wig over her face, then he falls asleep. Nick enters with a \"fantastic Baroque Machine\" which seems to turn stones into bread. Tom cries out in his sleep that he wishes it were true, and waking, finds the machine he has dreamt of. Nick says to Tom that he could make a lot of money if he started a business making these machines. Nick is deceiving him: the machine does not work.\nAct 3.\nTom has lost a lot of money, and the things in his house are being auctioned by the auctioneer Sellem. The objects for sale include Baba, who has not moved since being silenced by the wig. When she is unwrapped, she comes to life again and starts shouting angrily. She is angry about the auction that is taking place, but calms down when Anne enters. Baba tells her to find Tom and \"set him right\", and warns her against Nick Shaddow. She says she wants to carry on with her acting career. \nIn a graveyard, Nick shows who he really is, and tells Tom that he must pay with his soul. Nick says he has worked for him for a year and a day; but as midnight strikes, Nick offers him a way of escape in the form of a game of cards, which Tom wins, but only because he was thinking of Anne. Nick has lost, and sinks into the ground, telling Tom that he is going mad. Tom is put in the madhouse called Bedlam. He believes he is Adonis and that Anne is Venus, the Roman goddess of love. Anne visits him, sings him to sleep, then quietly leaves him. When he realizes she has gone, he dies. \nIn an epilogue, the main characters point out the simple moral: that the Devil finds work for idle hands (people who are lazy).\nPerformance history.\nIt was first performed in Venice on September 11, 1951, with Elisabeth Schwarzkopf singing the part of Anne Trulove. In 1957, it was a part of the first season of the Santa Fe Opera. The composer himself came to the rehearsals. There was an excellent production in 1975 at Glyndebourne Festival Opera which was designed by David Hockney. This production has been revived at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in July 2008."}

He also went on four main expeditions to explore south eastern Australia.\nEarly life.\nThomas Mitchell was born in Craigend, now part of Glasgow, Scotland on June 15, 1792. He worked in his uncle's colliery (coal mine) business. He joined the British Army in 1811 with the rank of lieutenant. He fought in the Peninsula War in Spain against Napoleon. As well as actual fighting, he worked as a surveyor and made maps. After the war he made maps of the battlefields. He was made a Major in 1826, but was then put on half pay.\nSurveyor-General.\nMitchell was given a job as a surveyor in New South Wales in September 1827. His job was to map roads, and join existing small maps into one big map that showed all of New South Wales. After John Oxley died in 1828, Mitchell was made the Surveyor-General, in charge of all the survey work. He planned and improved the layout of roads, bridges, towns, and public reserves."}

They have won 55 league titles, a world record, plus the Scottish Third Division, Scottish League One and Scottish Championship league titles and have won more major trophies than any football club in the world. The club are nicknamed \"The Teddy Bears\", from the rhyming slang for \"Gers\", which in turn is short for \"Rangers\", and the fans are known to each other as \"Bluenoses\". The club's correct name is simply \"Rangers F.C.\", although they are sometimes referred to as \"Glasgow Rangers\" for European matches to avoid confusion.\nFor most of their history, Rangers have enjoyed a fierce rivalry with their cross-city opponents Celtic, and the two are collectively known as the Old Firm.\nThe club's home, the all-seated 50,817-capacity Ibrox Stadium in south-west Glasgow, has been accredited as one of UEFA's five-star stadia. The stadium was the first one in Scotland to be granted this accolade, which it now shares with Hampden Park, Scotland's national stadium.\nIn February 2012 Rangers entered administration because of a problem with tax with HM Revenue and Customs. On 14 June 2012, the parent company that owned the club was forced into liquidation following the rejection of a proposed Company Voluntary Arrangement, and the club's assets, including Ibrox Stadium and Murray Park, were bought by The Rangers Football Club Ltd - a consortium led by Charles Green, a former chief executive of Sheffield United. The club applied to register with the Scottish Football Association and to participate in the Scottish Premier League. The new company's application to join the SPL was rejected in a vote by the other members of the league. In a separate vote by the members of the Scottish Football League, they were invited to play in the Third Division of the Scottish Football League structure. Since then, they have been promoted back to the top division.\nClub colours and crest.\nThe club colours of Rangers F.C. are royal blue, white and red.\nThe team's home strip invariably features a royal blue shirt (often with white and/or red trim). Traditionally this is accompanied by white shorts (often with royal blue and/or red trim) and black socks with red turn-downs. However when wearing the 'home strip' Rangers will occasionally alter the shorts and socks, sometimes replacing the black socks with white ones; or replacing the white shorts and black socks combination with royal blue shorts and socks.\nThe basic design of Rangers away strips has changed far more than the traditional home strip. White and red have been the most common predominant colours for Rangers alternate strips, though dark and light blue have also featured highly.\nIn recent years, Rangers have also introduced a third kit. This is usually worn if both the home and away kits clash with their opponents. The colours used range from light blue to red to a very controversial tangerine."}

Aksai Chin is one of the two main border disputes between India and China. The other is the dispute over Arunachal Pradesh. Aksai Chin (the name literally means \"Chin's desert of white stones\") is a very large high-altitude hot desert of salt with sand dunes and yareta (a type of cushioned plants) that reaches heights up to 4,500 metres.

It is the main town in the borough of St. Edmundsbury and known for the ruined abbey near the town centre. The town linked to the Magna Carta; in 1214 the barons of England are believed to have met in the Abbey Church and promised to force King John to accept the Charter of Liberties, the document which influenced the creation of the Magna Carta. It was also the setting for two witch trials. one of which was used as a reference in the Salem Witch Trials. During the Second World War, the USAAF operated an airfield outside the town. It is also called 'Suffolk's Floral Town' due to the abbey gardens and amounts of rural land.\nTown.\nNear the gardens stands Great Britain's first internally illuminated street sign called the \"Pillar of Salt\". When built, it needed permission because it did not conform to regulations. Bury St Edmunds is where the A1101 road, Britain's lowest road, ends. There is a network of tunnels which prove that chalk-workings took place nearby, though there is no evidence of a lot of tunnels under the town centre. Some buildings have cellars which lead into each other. Due to their unsafe nature the chalk-workings are not open to the public, although viewing is allowed to some people. Some tunnels have caused subsidence in living history.\nAmong interesting buildings is St Mary's Church. The Tudor King Henry VIII's sister, Mary Tudor, was re-buried in Bury's St Mary's Church, after being moved from the Abbey after her brother's dissolution of the Church six year after her death. Queen Victoria had a stained glass window fitted into the church to commemorate Mary's interment.\nOn 3 March, 1974 a Turkish Airlines DC-10 jet crashed near Paris in France killing all 346 people on board. Among the victims were 17 members of Bury St Edmunds rugby club.\nThe town council election on 3 May 2007 was won by the \"Abolish Bury Town Council\" party. The party lost its majority following a by-election in June 2007 and, to date, the Town Council is still in existence.\nName.\nThe name \"borough\" comes from of \"Bury\", which has cognates in other Germanic languages such as the Old Norse \"borg\" meaning \"wall, castle\"; and Gothic \"baurgs\" meaning \"city\". They all derive from Proto-Germanic \"*burgs\" meaning \"fortress\". This in turn derives from the Proto-Indo-European root \"*bhrgh\" meaning \"fortified elevation\", with cognates including Welsh \"bera\", \"stack\" and Sanskrit bhrant- \"high, elevated building\".\nAbbey.\nIn the centre of Bury St Edmunds there is the remains of an abbey, surrounded by the Abbey Gardens, a park. The abbey is a shrine to Saint Edmund, the Saxon King of the East Angles, who was killed by the Danes in 869AD. The town grew around Bury St Edmunds Abbey, a site of pilgrimage, and developed into a flourishing cloth-making town by the 14th century.\nThe abbey was largely destroyed during the 16th century with the dissolution of the monasteries but Bury remained prosperous throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. It fell into relative decline with the industrial revolution.\nThe Abbey Gardens which surround the ruins had an Internet bench installed in the late 1990s, which portable computers to connect to the Internet. It was the first bench of its kind, though within the first week two teenagers discovered they could also make free telephone calls from the bench. They phoned the Borough Council (owner of the bench) to notify them, then attempted to contact Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft, to tell him.\nCathedral.\nBury St Edmunds Cathedral was created when the Diocese of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich was formed in 1914. The cathedral was extended with an eastern end in the 1960s, commemorated by Benjamin Britten's Fanfare for St Edmundsbury, and a new Gothic revival cathedral tower was built as part of a millennium project running from 2000 to 2005. The opening for the tower took place in July 2005, and included a brass band concert and fireworks. Parts of the cathedral remain uncompleted, including the cloisters. Many areas remain inaccessible to the public due to building work. The tower makes St Edmundsbury the only recently completed Anglican cathedral in the UK, and only a handful of Gothic revival cathedrals are being built worldwide. The tower was constructed using original fabrication techniques by six masons who placed the machine pre-cut stone individually as they arrived.\nCulture.\nThe Theatre Royal, Bury St Edmunds was built by National Gallery architect William Wilkins in 1819. It is the sole surviving Regency Theatre in the country . The theatre, owned by the National Trust underwent restoration between 2005 and 2007. Appeal patron Dame Judi Dench: It presents a full programme of performances and is also open for public tours.\nMoyse's Hall Museum is one of the oldest (c. 1180) domestic buildings in East Anglia open to the public. It has collections of fine art, for example Mary Beale, costume, e.g. Charles Frederick Worth, horology, local and social history; including Red Barn Murder and Witchcraft.\nThe town holds a festival in May. This including concerts, plays, dance, and lecturers culminating in fireworks. Bury St Edmunds is home to England's oldest Scout group, 1st Bury St Edmunds (Mayors Own).\nThe town's football club, Bury Town, are the fourth oldest non-league team in England. They are members of the Isthmian League Division One North.\nLocal economy.\nBrewing.\nThe Greene King brewery is in Bury. The other brewery is The Old Cannon Brewery and public house on Cannon Street near the railway station. The brewing vessels, made for an exhibition in Japan in 1997, can be seen in the front room. Just outside the town is Bartrums Brewery, on Rougham airfield but originally in Thurston.\nAnother beer-related landmark is Britain's smallest public house, The Nutshell, which is on The Traverse, just off the marketplace.\nSugar beet.\nBury's largest landmark is the British Sugar factory near the A14, which processes sugar beet into refined crystal sugar. It was built in 1925 and processes beet from 1,300 growers. 660 lorry loads of beet can be accepted each day when beet is being harvested. Not all the beet can be crystallised immediately, and some is kept in solution in holding tanks until late spring and early summer, when the plant has spare crystallising capacity. The sugar is sold under the Silver Spoon name (the other major British brand, Tate &amp; Lyle, is made from imported sugar cane). By-products include molassed sugar beet feed for cattle and LimeX70, a soil improver.\nNotable residents.\nNotable people from Bury St Edmunds include artist and printer Sybil Andrews, actor Bob Hoskins, theatre director Sir Peter Hall, artist and water deviner Neil Stalley, author Maria Lousie de la Ram\u00e9 (also known as Ouida), World War II Canadian general Guy Simonds and the 18th century landscape architect Humphry Repton, as well as Thomas Clarkson fact-finder behind the abolition of the slave trade.\nNotable bands from Bury St Edmunds include Jacob's Mouse, Miss Black America, The Dawn Parade and Kate Jackson (of The Long Blondes)\nAlthough not from Bury St Edmunds, BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel lived nearby in Great Finborough and on 12 November 2004 his funeral took place at the cathedral. It was attended by a thousand people including many artists he had championed. During a peak of local musical activity in Bury St Edmunds in 2002, he referred (tongue-in-cheek) to the town as 'The New Seattle'.\nActor Ian McShane was given freedom of the borough in 1996 after he played the title role in the television series Lovejoy, filmed in and around Bury.\nBury St Edmunds is birthplace of James Moore winner of the world's first cycle race and of the first long-distance road race, from Paris to Rouen"}

The Salem Witch Trials involved two kinds of trials. First, court hearings were held before local magistrates; then trials were held in county court.

Young girls, Betty Parris and Abigail Williams, blamed people they didn\u2019t like and thought were suspicious devil worshippers. Betty and Abigail began to twist themselves into weird looking shapes and saying words that made no sense. The father of Betty called the doctor and the doctor gave a diagnosis and that they had been bewitched.\nDuring the Trials, over 150 people were arrested and put in jail after being accused of practicing witchcraft. Even more people were accused, but were never formally charged by the authorities. Twenty-nine people were convicted (or found guilty) of witchcraft, which was a capital felony. Nineteen of these people - fourteen women and five men - were hangedon Gallows Hill Giles Corey, a man who refused to enter a plea, was crushed to death under heavy stones to try to force him to confess or plead. At least five more of the accused died in prison.\nThe trials were held in Salem, though people from all surrounding areas were brought to Salem to be tried for witchcraft. The best-known trials were held by the Court of Oyer and Terminer in 1692 in Salem Town. All twenty-six people who went to trial before this court were convicted. There were also four sessions of the Superior Court of Judicature in 1693, held in Salem , Massachusetts. Thirty-one accused witches were tried in these courts, but only three were convicted.\nA much later Ipswich Witch Trial was held in 1878, and called the second Salem witch trial."}

It is often a hereditary title that ranks as the one of the lower titles in a peerage. In the UK peerage system, the five peerage titles from highest to lowest are duke, marquess, earl, viscount and baron. Baronets and knights are not members of the peerage although a baron may also be a knight. In the feudalism of medieval England a baron was a tenant-in-chief who held his lands directly from the king. During the 13th century barons were summoned by royal writ to attend Parliament.\nThe word baron comes from Old French \"baron\", itself from Frankish \"baro\" meaning \"freeman, warrior\". It later merged with Old English \"beorn\" meaning \"nobleman.\" The lands of a baron are called a barony. The female title for a baron is baroness. The form of address for a baron is \"Lord\" and for a baroness \"Lady\"."}

O'Donnell played for Motherwell, Celtic and Sheffield Wednesday over the course of his career. He died from a cardiac arrest after collapsing on the pitch on 29 December 2007.\nDeath.\nOn 29 December 2007, O'Donnell collapsed during a game against Dundee United just as he was about to be substituted. He was treated on the pitch for about five minutes by the Motherwell and Dundee United club doctors before being taken by ambulance to Wishaw General Hospital. However, he was pronounced dead at 17.18 hours. He was 35 years of age, married and had four children.\nA postmortem examination was carried out on 1 January 2008 and it was revealed O'Donnell died of left ventricular failure. His funeral was on 4 January, at St Mary's church in Hamilton.\nTributes.\nFormer Scottish First Minister Jack McConnell, MSP for Motherwell and Wishaw, was among those to pay tribute. He hailed the midfielder as a \"great professional.\" He said, \"as captain he helped transform Motherwell this season. Phil will be sadly missed by his family and by football fans but he will be mourned by the whole community.\"\nThe player was described as a \"perfect gentleman\" by former Scotland coach Craig Brown. He said: \"It's very, very sad news, I just can't get over it. You would not get a more ideal role model for a young footballer than Phil O'Donnell. I think in his first spell at Motherwell he was probably the best box-to-box midfield player \u2013 maybe not just in Scotland but in the UK.\"\nMotherwell and other fans laid flowers, scarves, strips and other mementos at the gates of Fir Park. The club's scheduled SPL game against Hibs at Easter Road the following Wednesday was postponed along with the club's home game with Celtic the following Sunday out of respect. Scottish Premier League chairman Lex Gold said: \"We understand from Phil's family that they would appreciate it if the Motherwell v Celtic game scheduled for 6 January 2008 could be postponed. Both clubs are happy to meet the request and we have called the game off.\" On 31 December, the SPL postponed the Celtic v Rangers fixture scheduled for 2 January 2008 following a request by O'Donnell's former club Celtic, which was agreed by Rangers.\nPlayers in 30 December's English Premier League matches between Derby County and Blackburn Rovers, and Manchester City and Liverpool F.C., wore black bands in his honour. Sheffield Wednesday's matches at Hull City and at home to Preston North End were preceded by a minutes applause as a mark of respect to their former player, with the Hillsborough flags flying at half-mast. All English Premiership ties in the New Year programme were preceded with either a minute of applause or silence in O'Donnell's memory. Everton and Scottish striker James McFadden, who played with O'Donnell at Motherwell, dedicated his goal to O'Donnell in Everton's 2\u20130 win at Middlesbrough by pointing solemnly to his black armband and then towards the sky.\nThousands of tributes from around the world have been posted on the internet. Motherwellfc.co.uk has received hundreds of written tributes from fans as far as Korea and Ukraine, as well as many emotional messages from Sevilla F.C., comparing O'Donnell's death to the similar tragedy of Antonio Puerta earlier in the season. Sevilla F.C. director of football Ramon Rodr\u00edguez Monchi said, \"This is terrible news. Right now, my thoughts are with Phil's family and everybody at Motherwell. Unfortunately, with the death of Phil O'Donnell, Motherwell have suffered a similar tragedy to ours. Antonio Puerta died at the beginning of the season and I know how terrible the whole experience is. Sevilla will be available to help in any way that we are able, to heal the pain and sadness of this tragic loss.\"\nMotherwell announced the Main Stand at Fir Park will be renamed The Phil O'Donnell Stand as a permanent tribute and Phil's team-mates will pay their own personal tribute by having his signature embroidered on their strips for the remainder of the 2007/08 season.\nOn 25 May 2008, a benefit match was held at Celtic Park in memory of O'Donnell with the proceeds going to various charities. The match was between a Celtic F.C. side drawn from their 1998 title winning squad and a Motherwell F.C. side drawn from their 1991 Scottish Cup win. Other players such as David Clarkson and James McFadden played in the game. Henrik Larsson described the match as \"a sad occasion but at the same time it's a kind of celebration for everything.\" The match finished 5-1, in front of 60,000."}

They are part of the Eastern Division\u00a0of Major League Baseball's\u00a0American League. This means that they use the designated hitter rule in most of their games. Its president &amp; CEO is Mark Shapiro, its general manager is Ross Atkins, and its coach and manager is John Gibbons. The team plays 162 games every year, which can be seen on television and heard on radio all across Canada.\nThe Blue Jays were founded in 1977 and are the only MLB team from Canada\u00a0or anywhere outside of the\u00a0United States, but they have not been the only one or even the first. There were also the\u00a0Montreal Expos, which was formed in 1969, eight years before the Jays. However, the Expos moved to\u00a0Washington, D.C.\u00a0in 2004 (becoming the\u00a0Washington Nationals). As part of the National League, which does not use the designated hitter rule, the Expos became rivals\u00a0to the Blue Jays. People loved to see the two teams play against each other, since they were the only two MLB teams from Canada.\nThe first stadium used by the Blue Jays was Exhibition Stadium, part of Exhibition Place, in Downtown Toronto, near the waterfront. The team became popular, and in 1989 they moved to a larger stadium to the east, the \"SkyDome\". It was the first in the world to have a retractable roof, and is just a few blocks away from the Air Canada Centre and Union Station. The SkyDome hosted the Major League Baseball All-Star Game in 1991. It is now called Rogers Centre, taking its name from Rogers Communications, a telecommunications company who owns the team.\nThe Blue Jays won the\u00a0World Series\u00a0twice, first in 1992 against the Atlanta Braves and again the next year, in 1993. They won their second World Series on Joe Carter's walk-off home run against the Philadelphia Phillies in the last\u00a0inning\u00a0of Game 6 on October 23, 1993, for a final score of 7-6. In both of those years, the team won American League East division titles (having the best win-loss record in their division). Others years in which the Jays won division titles were in 1985, 1989, 1991, and most recently in 2015. They also went to the playoffs as a wild card team in 2016."}

Finally, George Crum became so angry he decided to exaggerate. He sliced the potatoes so thinly they could not even be pierced with a fork. Then he put them in ice water for 30 minutes. After he fried and salted them, he gave them to the customer - who, to his surprise, loved them. First named \"Saratoga chips\" in 1835, it later became well known as \"potato chips\".

Brampton is now the 11th largest city in Canada.\nBrampton was made into a village in 1853. It took its name from the town of Brampton, England. Brampton was once known as The Flower Town of Canada. It was called this because of the city's large greenhouse industry. Today, the city is the home of the national headquarters of Loblaw Companies, HBC/Zellers, Brita, Clorox and other companies. The city is also home to Canadian Forces Army Reserve unit The Lorne Scots (Peel, Dufferin and Halton Regiment).\nHistory.\nIn 1834, a man named John Elliott divided land into lots and started to sell these lots. He called the area \"Brampton\", and others started to do the same.\nIn 1853 Brampton was made into a village. During that year a small agricultural fair was started. The fair took place at the corner of Main street and Queen street. Grains, produce, and dairy products as well as Horses and cattle were sold at the fair. This fair became what is now called the Brampton Fall Fair.\nThe village of Brampton built its first public library in 1887. In 1907, the village got money from Andrew Carnegie to build a new library building.\nEdward Dale, an immigrant from Dorking, England, opened a flower nursery in Brampton after he got to the town in 1863. Dale's Nursery became the town's largest employer, and began to export flowers around the world. The company became a town landmark, until Brampton Town Council allowed the building to be torn down in 1977. The company once had 140 greenhouses, and was the largest flower business in North America. The company also brought about the development of other nurseries in the town. Brampton became the home 48 flower nurseries.\nIn 1963, the town started calling itself the \"Flower Town of Canada\". On 24 June 2002 Brampton City Council started the \"Flower City Strategy\". They wanted to show the town's history of growing flowers using this strategy. In 2007 the Rose Theatre was opened\nand the city started taking part in the Communities in Bloom competition as a part of their strategy.\nCurrent events.\nOn October 28, 2007, the Brampton Civic Hospital was opened. The Brampton Civil Hospital was built to replace the old Peel Memorial Hospital which had been closed for renovations. Since Peel Memorial Hospital closed, the residents of Brampton have not been sure what is going to happen to it. Many residents want the hospital to be re-opened. They do not think the Brampton Civic Hospital is large enough for the size of Brampton.\nIn September of 2007, the Rose Theatre opened in Brampton. The theatre is seen as the start of a rebuilding of Brampton's downtown . Since the theatre opened, new businesses have opened in Brampton, and old businesses have renovated."}

On July 20, 1969, Armstrong and Aldrin became the first humans to land on the moon, while Collins stayed in orbit around the Moon.\nThe flight was part of the Space Race. It finished the plan set by John F. Kennedy in 1961 to \"land a man on the moon, and return him safely to the Earth\", before the 1960s ended.\nThe Flight.\nGoing to and from space.\nMillions of people around the world viewed the flight of Apollo 11 on television. When the rocket was sent to space it was a worldwide event. Richard Nixon, who was then President, watched it from the White House as the rocket went up. A Saturn V rocket took flight from the Kennedy Space Center in America.\nAbout two hours after leaving Earth the passenger module departed the main rocket. The passenger module had two main parts, the Apollo command and service module called \"Columbia\" and the Apollo Lunar Module called \"Eagle\". \"Columbia\" was the space ship that stayed in space, and \"Eagle\" was the moon-landing space ship. 3 days later the team entered Lunar Orbit (orbit around the moon). A day later the \"Eagle\" went away from \"Columbia\". The \"Eagle\" landed safely on the moon with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin inside. During the landing, there were several problems with the computer. To land safely Armstrong had to fly the \"Eagle\" himself. They landed with only 25\u00a0seconds of fuel left.\nEvents on the moon.\nThe first thing Buzz Aldrin did upon touch down was to pray. He also read some words of Jesus. He did not reveal his plan to do this because someone had just made a lawsuit to stop astronauts from doing religious things in space. Armstrong became the first human to walk and speak on the moon's surface. The first words he said were:\nFor the next two and a half hours Aldrin and Armstrong took notes, pictures and made holes to get moon rock. The landings were watched by over six million people on Earth using the very big radio telescope in Australia. They did many experiments, for example, the collecting of moon rocks and dust. An American flag was set up and photographed on the moon. Before doing that, President Richard Nixon did a telephone call to them:\nLeaving the moon and returning to Earth.\nAfter finishing their work, Armstrong and Aldrin returned to the \"Eagle\" and slept for seven hours before starting to leave. While preparing to leave, Aldrin broke the circuit breaker in the engine starter. Armstrong used a pen to bridge the circuit and stop them from being stuck on the moon. Aldrin and Armstrong left many things on the moon: an American flag, a few experiments, a golden feather, a logo of Apollo 1 and some bronze coins honoring Yuri Gagarin and Vladimir Komarov. He also left a sign on the moon, with a message from the human race. The sign reads:\nOn July 24 the three astronauts returned to Earth and were immediately placed into quarantine (kept away from other people), in case they brought back some disease from the moon. They stayed in quarantine for three weeks. When they got out the men were heroes around the world. They had dinner with President Nixon, a parade in New York City and another one in Chicago. The three were also on many television shows."}

They currently play in the Scottish Championship. The manager is Micky Mellon. In the 2018-19 season, they finished 2nd in the Championship behind Ross County. The club failed to regain promotion to the Premiership after losing the Premiership play-off against St. Mirren 2-0 on penalties. Dundee United won the 1982-83 Scottish Premier Division, and the Scottish Cup in 1994 and 2010.\nStadium.\nDundee United's home ground throughout their history has been Tannadice Park, located on Tannadice Street in the Clepington area of the city. It is situated only away from Dens Park, home of rivals Dundee F.C.; the two stadia are the closest senior football grounds anywhere in the United Kingdom.\nThe club have only ever played one home fixture at another venue. This was a League Cup tie against Rangers in March 1947, when despite snow rendering Tannadice unplayable, the match was able to go ahead across the road at Dens Park.\nThe age and proximity of their stadia has led to the possibility of both clubs moving to a new, purpose-built shared stadium being discussed on various occasions. The most recent and serious proposal for this was put forward as part of Scotland's bid to joint-host the 2008 European Football Championship, with several clubs seeking to benefit from a new stadium with planning permission given to a proposed site at Caird Park. Special dispensation was requested to proceed with the proposal, as rules at the time forbade SPL teams from groundsharing. Following Scotland's failed bid to host the tournament, the scheme was shelved for the time being, although the plan was raised again in June 2008 following doubts about joint-host Ukraine's ability to stage Euro 2012 with the Scottish Football Association keen as alternative hosts."}

{"id": "116892", "revid": "966595", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=116892", "title": "Kilmarnock", "text": "Kilmarnock (; locally known as \"Killie\") is a large burgh in East Ayrshire, Scotland, with 44,170 people. It is roughly between Glasgow and Ayr, and is the second largest town in Ayrshire. The River Irvine runs through its eastern section, and the Kilmarnock Water passes through it, giving rise to the name 'Bank Street'.\nHistory.\nThe name comes from the Gaelic \"cill\" (\"cell\"), and the name of Saint Marnoch or Mernoc who is also remembered in the name of Portmarnock in Ireland, and Inchmarnock. It may come from the three Gaelic elements \"mo\", 'my', \"Ern\u00e1n\" (name of the saint) and the diminutive \"ag\", giving \"Church of My Little Ern\u00e1n\". Some people think that the saint founded a church there in the 7th century. There are 12 Church of Scotland congregations in the town, plus other denominations. In 2005, the Reverend David W. Lacy, minister of the town's Henderson Church, was elected Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.\nThe core of the early town appears to have lain around what is now the Laigh Kirk (Low Church), although the oldest parts of the current building are no earlier than the 17th century, extending north and northwest. A comparatively modest settlement until the industrial revolution, Kilmarnock extended considerably from around 1800 onwards. This resulted in formal, planned developments such as King Street, Portland Street, Saint Marnock Street, and latterly John Finnie Street; the latter often suggested as one of the finest Victorian planned streets in Scotland.\nGeography.\nAreas of Kilmarnock include:\nEconomy.\nKilmarnock's traditional industries were based around textiles and heavy engineering: e.g. locomotives (Andrew Barclay and Sons) from 1837 through 1970, and valves (Glenfield and Kennedy), which are still in production; and carpets (manufactured by BMK) from the early 1900s.\nThe carpets manufactured in Kilmarnock were internationally known for their quality and intricacy since the late 1800s. Many locations around the world chose to install BMK carpets. Famously, RMS Titanic was carpeted using carpets manufactured by Stoddard Carpets, the parent company and successor to BMK. Primarily due to a move by the UK market towards laminated and hard-wood flooring, but also partially due to a long decline in the industry in the area as well as cheaper, but noticeably less hard-wearing foreign competition, carpet-making finally ceased in Kilmarnock in early 2005.\nArchibald Finnie and his family lived at Springhill House (now a nursing home) near the Grange Academy. They owned many coal mines, pits and other companies in Springside and other places. John Finnie Street is named after one of the family. Shoes were also a major product for some time, with Saxone having a factory in the town on the site of where the Galleon leisure centre is now.\nKilmarnock had one of the earliest tram railways in the world, running to Troon over the (recently restored) Laigh Milton viaduct. The Glasgow and South Western Railway also set up their works here, producing nearly 400 locomotives by the time it was absorbed by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1923. Some work continued, but heavy repairs were sent to St. Rollox. Locomotive repairs finished in 1952, and the works closed in 1959. Nevertheless locomotives are still made by Hunslett-Barclay, as well as the maintenance of existing diesel and electric multiple units.\nFrom 1946 tractors were also built in Kilmarnock, with a large Massey-Harris factory present on the outskirts of the town. It later became Massey-Ferguson, before closing in 1980. Glenfield and Kennedy still survives albeit with a fraction of its former workforce, which at its height numbered in the thousands. Kilmarnock however is still home to the world famous Johnnie Walker's brand Scotch whisky. On the outskirts of the town is Scotland's first privately run prison, HM Prison Kilmarnock.\nRegeneration.\nThe textile and manufacturing sectors across Scotland suffered significant decline in the postwar period, and in particular from the 1960s, in the face of greater foreign competition. Kilmarnock was no exception, with the closure or significant reduction of many of its traditional large employers: Glenfield and Kennedy, Massey Ferguson, BMK, and Saxone. Although significant attempts have been made to halt this decline and attract new employers, Kilmarnock saw a continuing net loss of jobs in the five years to 2005.\nAlthough traditionally a main shopping area for most of the surrounding districts, patterns have changed over the last 20 years; traditional centres such as Ayr have been joined by new developments at Braehead and East Kilbride.\nThis difficult economic climate is most visible in the town centre, the eastern part of which has been extensively redeveloped, with important historic buildings such as King Street Church and the Town Hall being demolished, and Duke Street (the link from Kilmarnock Cross to the Palace Theatre and out to the London Road) built over.\nMore recently Portland Street, which formed the northerly part of the main shopping area, lay abandoned for many years due to a decline in retail trade and in the face of possible comprehensive redevelopment. The street has now been redeveloped, but has not yet regained its former degree of popularity, with a Gala Bingo and a J.D. Wetherspoons taking up much of one side of the street and the rest largely occupied by chain stores.\nIn 2004, the \"Rough Guide to Scotland\" described the town as \"shabby and depressed, saddled with some terrible shopping centres and a grim one-way system\". The town, however, contains several parks such as Howard Park, Dean Park, and Kay Park, and residential areas including London Road, Dundonald Road, McLelland Drive, and Howard Park Drive. The town also boasts a collection of gift shops, cafes, bars, and restaurants within the very desirable Bank Street area, whilst offering retail options within its retail parks at Queen's Drive and Glencairn Square.\nAccording to the local press in November 2007, the new SNP council have drawn up a \"Top Ten Hit List\" on 'eyesore' buildings in the town, and their owners and have revealed plans to crack down hard on property owners who have left their buildings fall into disrepair. A plan of action is being carried out to get something done with each of these sites. Many of the buildings in disrepair are irreplaceable listed buildings such as the former ABC cinema (previously the King's Theatre) on Titchfield Street.\nA four-star hotel recently opened next to Rugby Park, the home of Kilmarnock F.C., and new restaurants, such as \"Merchants\" and the award winning \"Jefferson Restaurant\" have opened in the town centre.\nRegeneration activities have been discussed for Kilmarnock town centre; in early 2006, an application to Historic Scotland's Conservation Area Regeneration Scheme was successful, and as of July 2006 an application under the Heritage Lottery Fund's Townscape Heritage Initiative Scheme was pending. Work has pretty much finished on a quality housing development on the gapsite of the former Kilmarnock Infirmary north of the town centre.\nIn the past there have been major efforts to improve the quality of life for residents in the town's worst housing estates, especially in parts of Shortlees, Longpark and Onthank. Though the physical rehabilitation of housing in these areas has partly tackled the underlying problems of social exclusion, Onthank is arguably that most successful area of regeneration in question.\nMuch new quality housing has been constructed on the northern fringes of the town, in order to service the demand for commuter housing. With a journey time of 20 minutes from Kilmarnock to Glasgow (roughly half that of the existing train service), the M77 motorway has transformed the link between Glasgow and Kilmarnock. The upgrading of the A77 route to Glasgow to the M77 motorway in 2005 has made Kilmarnock more accessible for commuters, and recent house price increases have reflected this.\nTransport.\nIn 1812, the famous Kilmarnock and Troon Railway opened, mainly to carry coal from the area to the harbour at Troon, but also carrying passengers.\nIn 1904, Kilmarnock had its own tramway system built. The name of the company was Kilmarnock Corporation Tramways. An electric power station was built in the south bank of the River Irvine at Riccarton. Overhead power lines and tram lines were laid. With continued upgrading and expansion, the tram network at its peak went from Ayr Road in Riccarton at its southerly point, to Knockinlaw Road in Beansburn in the North. At Kilmarnock Cross, the line had an easterly spur that stretched along London Road, through Crookedholm and finally terminating at Hurlford. There had been proposed extensions along Portland Road, up John Finnie Street, West Langlands Street and eventually towards Crosshouse, but by this time, increasing costs and the far more flexible motor bus had made inroads and the trams ceased operation in 1926 during the General Strike. The council decided not to restart the service and the infrastructure was soon dismantled. Today the town is served by Kilmarnock railway station.\nKilmarnock has excellent road links to Glasgow with the M77 motorway now extending as far as Fenwick.\nKilmarnock is on the main road between Edinburgh, Livingston, South Lanarkshire, and Ayrshire (Irvine).\nEducation.\nKilmarnock has 17 schools; 13 primary and four secondary. There is also a college in the town, Kilmarnock College, formerly Kilmarnock Technical College. The schools are managed by East Ayrshire Council.\nSports.\nThe town is host to a football club named Kilmarnock F.C., the oldest professional club in Scotland. Their home ground is the curiously named Rugby Park. The reason for the name of the ground is that when founded, the club played both football and rugby. The club has the largest supporter base of any team outside Scotland's four major cities. Rugby Park was also one of the first football grounds in Scotland to have floodlights installed. In recent years the stadium has been modernised, firstly to bring it in line with the all-seating regulations, then rebuilt totally to make a new ground. It has also hosted international football matches as well as music concerts, the most recent one was when Elton John performed here in June 2005. Derek Olgavie is also a regular appearance in the Palace Theatre.\nThe town also regularly plays host to professional wrestling shows, promoted by the British Championship Wrestling promotion.\nThere are two golf courses in the town, Annanhill Golf Course and Caprington Golf Course, which has both an 18 hole course and a nine hole course. Both these courses are council owned and run by East Ayrshire Council.\nThe local leisure complexes include the Galleon Centre: with a 25 metre swimming pool, baby pool, ice rink, squash courts, sauna, gym, games hall, bar area, bowling green and the New Northwest Centre (formerly the Hunter Centre) which contains an up-to-date community gym and various local medical facilities.\nA leisurely stroll around the town will reveal many fine buildings. Kilmarnock boasts a large number of listed buildings. The Dick Institute, opened in April 1901, was severely damaged by fire only eight years after it opened. Some of the museums collections were lost in the fire. It reopened two years after the fire in 1911. The Dick Institute was used as an Auxiliary Hospital in 1917 during World War One.It is now shared by the Arts and Museums Service, and the Libraries, Registration and Information Service. The two Art Galleries and three Museum Galleries house permanent and temporary displays of Fine Art, Contemporary Art and Craft, Local and Industrial History and Natural Sciences. The Lending Library, Audio Library, Junior Library, Reference Library, and Learning Centre are all housed on the ground floor.\nCulture.\nThe first collection of work by Scottish poet Robert Burns, \"Poems, chiefly in the Scottish dialect\" was published here in 1786. It was published at the current site of the Burn's Mall, dedicated to his work. This edition is known as the \"Kilmarnock Edition\".\nTwo areas of Kilmarnock, Ellerslie and Riccarton, are associated with William Wallace and his father. Claims have been made that this is the true origin of his birthplace, and recently these have been largely substantiated. The claim that Wallace was born in Elderslie near Paisley no longer seems tenable.\nJohn Bowring, renowned polyglot and fourth governor of Hong Kong, was Member of Parliament for Kilmarnock in 1835.\nIn the castle of Kilmarnock, Dean Castle, there is an exhibition of armour and weapons, and the Van Raalte collection of musical instruments.\nTwin towns.\nKilmarnock - as part of East Ayrshire Council - is twinned with five European cites and has received awards from the Council of Europe for its work in twinning."}

Probably the best known was (I've Got a Gal In) Kalamazoo\" by the Glenn Miller band with Tex Beneke. This #1 popular song was written by Mack Gordon and Harry Warren. It was performed by the band playing the part of the Glenn Miller Orchestra in the 1942 movie \"Orchestra Wives\". This was nominated: Best Music, Original Song in Academy Awards, Harry Warren (music), Mack Gordon (lyrics).\nSister cities.\nThe city of Kalamazoo, Michigan has three sister cities."}

Created by Richard Dominguez, both characters made their first appearance in \"El Gato Negro #1\".\nThe first El Gato Negro was Agustin Guerrero, a former luchador from South Texas who decided to use his skills to fight crime during the early '50s and late '60s. \nThe current El Gato Negro is Francisco Guerrero, grandson to the original El Gato Negro. He adopted the superhero identity after his best friend was killed in a brutal murder.\nEach El Gato Negro adopts a cat-like emblem, which they display in their costume designs or equipment. Although Agustin is not from the Silver Age of comics, he is sometimes referred to as \u201cSilver Age El Gato Negro\u201d, because the comic book\u2019s timeline would place him in that era.\nAgustin Guerrero.\nAgustin Guerrero was an American soldier from Texas sent overseas to fight in the Korean War. Separated from his battalion, Agustin was lost in the harsh jungles. There he found an exiled Japanese warrior and assassin known as \u201c\"Nuro Neko\"\u201d (\"\u9ed2\u3044\u732b\" - black cat). Nuro Neko trained the young soldier martial arts and the path of a warrior. After being rescued and discharged, Agustin returned to Texas to become a masked wrestler. He adopted the identity of El Gato Negro and his success as a luchador caused him to have many adventures outside of the wrestling ring before he finally retired in the late '60s.\nFrancisco Guerrero.\nThe second and current El Gato Negro, Francisco Guerrero is a social worker by day and a vigilante by night. Francisco became the new El Gato Negro after the murder of his friend. Despite being liked by the citizens of his community, El Gato Negro is constantly being hunted by local law enforcement.\nMovies.\nRichard Dominguez is currently in talks for a El Gato Negro movie."}

He is best known for making the comic book \"El Gato Negro\".\nBiography.\nRichard Dominguez was born in Dallas, Texas on September 22, 1960 as the second of seven children. Dominguez first read comics at the age of six. He was first interested in art while in high school. He took classes in Commercial Art and later took Life Drawing classes in community college. Richard later worked as an intern for art and design studios in the late '80s and early '90s.\nAzteca Productions.\nRichard made the Azteca Productions company and imprint in 1993. The first publication was \"El Gato Negro #1\". Dominguez first got the idea for El Gato Negro in the late '80s. He originally planned thought of putting the character in a team of superheroes. Liking the character better on his own, Dominguez left the original project and focused on El Gato Negro. A lot of the character\u2019s personality and look was inspired by Dominguez\u2019s favorite superheroes like The Spirit, The Crimson Avenger, Daredevil, Nightwing, The Shadow, The Phantom, Zorro and Batman. The character has been popular since his introduction. and other media Dominguez is currently looking to make a movie on the character.\nDominguez made his superhero group with the help of friend and writer Michael S. Moore in 1997 in a book called Team Tejas. Richard stopped publishing his books after 1997 to spend time with his family. He later came back to publish new El Gato Negro stories in 2004. Other books he plans on publishing are Lucha Grande Comics, The Acolyte, Demon Hunter, and a revival of Judge Margarito C. Garza's Relampago!\nP.A.C.A.S..\nThe Professional Amigos of Comic Art Society or P.A.C.A.S. was a non-profit organization made by Richard Dominguez with his friends Carlos Salda\u00f1a, Jose Martinez, and Fernando Rodriguez in 1995. The group was made to bring together different artists, comic book and cartoon creators together to help with each other\u2019s projects. P.A.C.A.S. grew to over 50 members. Most of them lived in California. The P.A.C.A.S. group no longer exists but there are rumors of a new one being made. Only an official website and MySpace page stand in tribute to their effort."}

The model was a successor to the company's DC-8 for long-range operations, and competed in the same markets as the Airbus A300, Boeing 747, and Lockheed L-1011 Tristar, which has a similar layout to the DC-10.\nProduction of the DC-10 ended in December 1988 with 386 delivered to airlines and 60 to the U.S. Air Force as air-to-air refueling tankers, designated the KC-10 Extender. The DC-10 was succeeded by the related McDonnell Douglas MD-11 which entered service in 1990.\nDevelopment.\nDouglas Aircraft began design studies based on its CX-HLS design. In 1966, American Airlines offered a specification to manufacturers for a widebody aircraft smaller than the Boeing 747 but capable of flying similar long-range routes from airports with shorter runways. The DC-10 became McDonnell Douglas's first commercial airliner after the merger between McDonnell Aircraft Corporation and Douglas Aircraft Company in 1967. The DC-10 was first ordered by launch customers American Airlines with 25 orders, and United Airlines with 30 orders and 30 options in 1968. The DC-10, a series 10 model, made its first flight on August 29, 1970. Following a flight test program with 929 flights covering 1,551 hours, the DC-10 was awarded a type certificate from the FAA on July 29, 1971 It entered commercial service with American Airlines on August 5, 1971 on a round trip flight between Los Angeles and Chicago. United Airlines began DC-10 service on August 16, 1971.[6] The DC-10's similarity to the L-1011 in terms of passenger capacity and launch in the same timeframe resulted in a head to head sales competition which affected profitability of the aircraft.\nAccidents and Problems.\nThe DC-10 had design flaws and had a poor safety record in its early years. But later, the design flaws were improved, and the DC-10 became much safer. The following accidents are some of those which have occurred since 1972."}

For the number theory (set, or predicate), see Sophie Germain prime.\"Marie-Sophie Germain (April 1, 1776 \u2013 June 27, 1831) was a French mathematician, physicist, and philosopher who made important contributions to differential geometry and number theory. She was born in 1776 in an era of revolution. In the year of her birth, 1776, the American Revolution began. In many ways Sophie embodied the spirit of revolution into which she was born. She was a middle-class female who went against the wishes of her family and the social prejudices of the time to become a highly recognized mathematician. Like the member of a revolution, her life was full of perseverance and hard work. It took a long time for her to be recognized and appreciated for her contributions to the field of mathematics, but she did not give up. Even today, it is felt that she was never given as much credit as she was due for the contributions she made in number theory and mathematical physics because she was a woman.\nEarly life.\nSophie Germain was born in Paris. As we have mentioned before, her family was quite wealthy. Her father was a merchant and later became director of the Bank of France. Sophie's interest in mathematics began during the French Revolution when she was 13 years old and confined to her home due to the danger caused by revolts in Paris. She initially received opposition from her parents and also the difficulties presented by the society for females to study. However, she had the opportunity to learn from books in her father\u2019s library, so she spent a great deal of time in there. She read important scientists and one day she ran across a book in which the legend of Archimedes' death was recounted. This legend has it that during the invasion of his city by the Romans Archimedes was so engrossed in the study of a geometric figure in the sand that he failed to respond to the questioning of a Roman soldier. As a result, he was speared to death. This sparked Sophie's interest. If someone could be so engrossed in a problem as to ignore a soldier and then die for it, the subject must be interesting. Thus, she began her study of mathematics. \nSophie began teaching herself mathematics and other topics using the books in her father's library. But her parents felt that her interest was inappropriate for a female (the common belief of the middle-class in the 19th century), and they did all they could to discourage her. She began studying at night to escape them, but they went to such measures as taking away her clothes once she was in bed and depriving her of heat and light to make her stay in her bed at night instead of studying. However, their efforts failed. She would wrap herself in quilts and use candles she had hidden in order to study at night. Finally. and they realized that Sophie's passion for mathematics was \"incurable,\" and they let her learn. Thus, Sophie spent the years of the Reign of Terror studying differential calculus without the aid of a tutor. She was self-taught. \nWork, and correspondences.\nIn 1794, when Sophie was 18, the Ecole Polytechnique was founded in Paris. It was an academy to train mathematicians and scientists for the country, but women were not allowed to enroll. Nevertheless, Sophie was able to obtain the lecture notes for several of the courses and study from them. This gave her the opportunity to learn from many of the prominent mathematicians of those days. Sophie was particularly interested in the teachings of Joseph Louis Lagrange. Under the pseudonym of M. LeBlanc (a former student of Lagrange's), she submitted a paper on analysis to Lagrange at the end of the term. He was quite impressed with the work and wanted to meet the student who had written it. He was amazed that the author of the work was actually a female; he recognized her abilities and became her mentor. With a male to introduce her, Sophie could enter the circle of scientists and mathematicians that she never before could. Up until this point not only had her gender been a hindrance to her, but her social status had been too, because she was not an aristocratic woman but one of the middle class. Lagrange certainly made his colleagues aware that Germain was a girl with mathematical talent and several of them wrote to her; for instance, Monge. But not everyone treated her with the respect she deserved. One case was J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lalande. She started to talk to him about Laplace's Exposition du syst\u00e8me du monde. Lalande told her that she should not be reading such works, rather she should be reading the second edition of his book Astronomie des dames. This \"astronomy for ladies\" does not contain a single mathematical equation and Germain felt insulted by his suggestion. Lalande sent her a letter of apology but she never forgave him. \nHowever, Germain\u2019s most famous correspondence began in 1804 with the German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss. She was intrigued with his work in number theory and sent him some of the results of her work. Again, she used her pseudonym to disguise her true identity; she feared being ignored because of being a woman. It was not until 1807 that Gauss found out who M. LeBlanc truly was. He was thrilled to find that his \"pen pal\" was a very gifted woman. Gauss was amazed for seeing that all the excellent that he could find in the interchange of letters and discussions came from a female, considered the weak gender. He was not bothered but pleased. \nAt about this time, in 1808, the French Academy of Sciences announced a contest to explain the \"underlying mathematical law\" of a German physicist's study on the vibration of elastic surfaces. Sophie was fascinated and set out to explain the law underlying Chladni's study. The Academy set a two-year deadline, and in 1811 Sophie submitted the only entry in the contest. Her lack of formal education was evident in the anonymous paper she submitted, and thus she was not awarded the prize. Lagrange corrected her errors and two years later she again entered the contest which had been extended. She received honorable mention this time. It was in 1816, when she entered for the third time and won with her paper Memoir on the Vibrations of Elastic Plates. After winning the contest, Sophie continued her work on the theory of elasticity publishing several more memoirs. Her work in the theory of elasticity would prove to be very important to the field.\nAmong her work done during these years is what would be her most important work in number theory. In 1820, Sophie made a statement about the divisibility of solutions to Fermat\u2019s equation, for an odd prime p. She proved that if x, y, and z are integers and if x5 + y5 = z5 then either x, y, or z must be divisible by 5. \nThe prize from the Academy, however, was of immediate importance because it introduced her into the ranks of the prominent mathematicians of the time. She became the first woman who was not a wife of a member to attend the Academy of Sciences' sessions. She was also praised by the Institut de France and was invited to attend their sessions. Sophie continued working with well-known male mathematicians in the 1820s as an \"equal collaborator\" to refine her proofs and work in number theory; and also continued to work in philosophy until her death, in 1831. \nLater life.\nAfter a battle with breast cancer, Sophie Germain died at the age of 55 on June 27, 1831 in Paris. Shortly before this Gauss, one of her earliest mentors, had convinced the University of Gottingen to give Sophie an honorary degree. She died before she could receive it. \nReferences.\nhttps://www.agnesscott.edu/lriddle/women/germain.htm#:~:text=Sophie%20Germain%20was%20a%20revolutionary,also%20very%20important%20to%20mathematics.\nhttps://www.britannica.com/biography/Sophie-Germain\nhttps://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Germain/\nhttps://totallyhistory.com/sophie-germain/"}

In the 1984 season, the last in which both of these conferences played football, all of the AMCU football schools were members of NCAA Division I-AA, now known as FCS. The MVC had schools that played in both DIvision I-A (today's Football Bowl Subdivision) and Division I-AA. The AMCU dropped football after the 1984 season, and the MVC announced it would do the same after the 1985 season. Beginning with the 1985 season, all of the remaining AMCU football teams, plus the MVC's I-AA teams, joined the Gateway Collegiate Athletic Conference (Gateway), which had sponsored only women's sports.

The MVC's I-AA football teams had membership in the MVC and Gateway in the 1985 season.\nIn 1992, the women's portion of the Gateway merged into the MVC.

Ohio State was founded in 1870. Ohio State University has been noted by multiple publications as one of the highest ranked universities in the United States and in the world.\nHistory.\nThe university was started in 1870 in a farming group in Columbus, Ohio. The first class had only 24 students. In the 1880s, Ohio State started taking graduate students. They started the law school in 1891. Later, Ohio State added colleges of medicine, dentistry, commerce, and journalism. In 1906, Ohio made a law that said Ohio State University was the state's \"flagship campus\", or the best school in the state of Ohio.\nAcademics.\nRankings.\nIn 1916, Ohio State was the first university in Ohio to be in the Association of American Universities. Ohio State is still the only Ohio public university in the association.\n\"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" has ranked Ohio State University as the best public university in Ohio, one of the top 60 universities in the United States, and one of the top 20 public universities in the United States. In 2007, China's Shanghai Jiao Tong University said Ohio State was the 61st best university in the world.\nThe school was also ranked as the 24th best university in the US, 10th top public university, and top school in Ohio by Arizona State University. The \"Washington Monthly\" college rankings placed Ohio State as the 12th best in the country and 10th best public university.\nFaculty and research.\nOhio State\u2019s faculty includes a Nobel Prize-winning physicist, Kenneth G. Wilson. It has twenty-one members of the United States National Academy of Sciences or National Academy of Engineering, plus four members of the Institute of Medicine. There are also 159 elected fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science who are teaching at Ohio State. In the last 25 years, thirty-two Ohio State faculty members have been given the Guggenheim Fellowship, which is more than all other public and private Ohio universities combined.\nOhio State is using over $110 million to research important issues, such as research to find a cure for cancer, renewable energy sources, and sustainable drinking water supplies.\nAdmissions.\nUndergraduate admissions to Ohio State are said to be \"more selective\" by \"US News &amp; World Report\". It is the most selective public university in Ohio, and it is the hardest university in Ohio to get into.\nAbout half of the people who apply to Ohio State get accepted. Of the students who get in, 57 percent graduated in the top 10 percent of their high school classes, 91 percent graduated in the top quarter, and 99% graduated in the top half. A quarter of the freshman scored in the top 3 percent of the SAT or ACT, and 72 percent scored in the top 1 percent. The average ACT score was 27. Of the 6,122 members of the 2006 freshman class, 290 had been named valedictorian (top student) of their high school's graduating class. Ohio State\u2019s freshman class has admitted over 100 National Merit Scholars for nine of the last ten years.\nCampuses.\nMain campus (Columbus).\nOhio State's main urban campus is in Columbus. It has a size of 1755 acres, and it is about north of the city's downtown. Four buildings are currently listed on the National Register of Historic Places: Enarson Hall, Hayes Hall, Ohio Stadium, and Orton Hall. Architecture on the Ohio State campus is a mix of traditional, modern, and post-modern styles.\nThe William Oxley Thompson Memorial Library is located at the west end of The Oval. It is the Ohio State library's main branch, and it is the largest of the school's branches. The school's library system has twenty-one libraries on its Columbus campus. There are eight other branches in other locations, and the system has fifty-five branches and collections in all.\nThe Wexner Center for the Arts is at the east end of The Oval. It was designed by the architects Peter Eisenman of New York and Richard Trott of Columbus, and it opened in 1989. The center was built mostly from a twenty-five million dollar gift from Ohio State graduate Leslie Wexner. Part of its design was to honor to the armory (military storage location) that was replaced with the Wexner Center. Its deconstructivist architecture makes known as one of the most important buildings of its generation, but the design makes it less than ideal to show many of the art displays. The main, permanent work kept in the center is Picasso's \"Nude on a Black Armchair\", a forty-five million dollar painting that Wexner gave to Ohio State.\nOhio Union is on the east side of The Oval, and at the south side is another, smaller grassy area known as The South Oval. The west side is contains Browning Amphitheatre and Mirror Lake.\nThe Ohio State College of Medicine is on the southern edge of the central campus. It is home to the James Cancer Hospital, where cancer is studied. It is one of the National Cancer Institute's forty-one NCI-designated Cancer Centers.\nRegional campuses.\nThe university also has several regional campuses and research facilities in Lima, Mansfield, Marion, and Newark. The school also has an Ohio State Agricultural Technical Institute. The first regional campus was in Newark, which was founded in 1957. Students there can get one of six bachelor degrees or two master degrees. In Lima, there are eight four-year programs, 2 high school completion programs, and four graduate programs. The Mansfield campus is in the Allegheny Plateau area, and it has 7 bachelor programs and 3 master programs. Marion's campus is closest to Columbus, and it has 5 bachelor programs and 2 master programs.\nResearch facilities.\nOhio State's research facilities include the Aeronautical/Astronautical Research Laboratory, Byrd Polar Research Center, Chadwick Arboretum, Biological Research Tower, Large Binocular Telescope, Mershon Center for International Security Studies, Stone Laboratory, and the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center.\nStudent life.\nThe Office of Student Life helps students with things such as student housing; food service; health, wellness and counseling; activities, organizations and leadership development; recreation and intramurals. The Office of Student Life also operates the Schottenstein Center, the Fawcett Center, the Blackwell Inn, the Ohio Union, the Drake Union, and the Wilce Student Health Center.\nOhio State has several student-managed publications and media outlets. \"The Makio\" is the official yearbook.\"The Lantern\" is the school's daily newspaper. \"Mosaic\" is a literary magazine published by Ohio State, which features undergraduate fiction, poetry, and art. OHIO.FM is the student-run radio station with an Internet audio stream (no broadcast signals are available in Columbus). Students also operate a local cable channel known as Buckeye TV, which airs mostly in the campus housing.\nOhio State University Marching Band is an old tradition at Ohio State. The marching band is the largest all-brass and percussion band in the world. The traditional school songs are arranged to fit this unique instrumentation. The band is famous for \"Script Ohio\", where band members use their bodies to spell Ohio spelled in script on the football field. It is seen as an honor to dot the \"i\" in the word. Celebrities such as Bob Hope, Jack Nicklaus, and John Glenn have dotted the \"i\".\nDiversity.\nOhio State's main campus is known for the diversity of its students. In various surveys and rankings, it has been included among the best campuses in the nation for African Americans. \"The Advocate College Guide for LGBT Students\" lists Ohio State as one of the best campuses in America for LGBT students.\nHonors programs.\nOhio State offers two distinct honors programs for high ability undergraduates: Honors and Scholars. The Honors program is open to students in all majors. The Scholars program is centered around thirteen specific programs such as \"Architecture Scholars\", \"Communication Technology Scholars\", \"Biological Sciences Scholars\", \"International Affairs Scholars\", and \"Politics, Society and Law Scholars\". Students in the Scholars program are expected to live and take select classes with other members of the program.\nStudent governments.\nAt Ohio State University, there are four recognized student governments: Undergraduate Student Government (USG), Council of Graduate Students (CGS), amd Inter-Professional Council (IPC), and Residence Hall Advisory Council (RHAC).\nAthletics.\nOhio State is in the NCAA's Division I. Ohio State's mascot is \"Brutus the Buckeye\". The school colors are scarlet and gray. Most Ohio State teams play in the Big Ten Conference. The women's ice hockey team plays in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association. In lacrosse, the men's team plays in ECAC Lacrosse and the women's team in the American Lacrosse Conference, but both will leave their respective leagues after the 2014 season, as the Big Ten will start lacrosse leagues for both sexes in the 2014\u201315 school year.\nOhio State won national championships in baseball, men's basketball, football, men's swimming &amp; diving, men's track and field, men's golf, men's gymnastics, men's fencing, men and women's fencing, and synchronized swimming."}

It is the seat of the Bishop of Bath and Wells. Its construction started in 1170 and the Cathedral was dedicated in 1239. \nWells Cathedral has been described as \u201cthe most poetic of the English Cathedrals\u201d. \nMuch of the structure is in Early English architecture. Many mouldings look almost like sculptures. The carved capitals are done in a foliate style known as \u201cstiff leaf\u201d. This adds to their lively view. The eastern end has kept much original glass, which is rare in England. The exterior has a splendid Early English fa\u00e7ade (~front) and a large central tower.\nThe first church was established on the site in 705. Construction of the present building began in the 10th century under Anglo-Saxon rule, but was later transformed under the Normans. It was largely complete at the time of its dedication in 1239. It has been expanded and renovated several times since then and has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building.\nHistory of the building.\nEarly years.\nThe first church was established here in 705 AD. It was dedicated to Saint Andrew. The only remains of this first church are some excavated foundations which can be seen in the cloisters. The baptismal font in the south transept is the oldest surviving part of the cathedral which is dated to c.700 AD.\nTwo centuries later, the seat of the diocese was shifted to Wells from Sherborne. The first Bishop of Wells was Athelm (circa 909), who crowned King Athelstan. Athelm and his nephew Saint Dunstan both became Archbishops of Canterbury. It was also around this time that Wells Cathedral School was founded.\nPresent structure.\nThe present structure was begun under the direction of Bishop Reginald de Bohun, who died in 1184.\nWells Cathedral dates mainly from the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries; the nave and transept are masterpieces of Early English architecture. It was largely complete at the time of its dedication in 1239.\nThe bishop responsible for the construction was Jocelyn de Wells, one of the bishops at the signing of Magna Carta. Jocelyn's buildings included the Bishop's Palace, a choristers' school, a grammar school, a hospital for travellers and a chapel. He also built a manor at Wookey, near Wells. The master mason associated with Jocelyn was Elias of Dereham (died 1246). Jocelyn lived to see the church dedicated but, despite much lobbying of Rome, died in 1242. Cathedral status was granted in 1245. Masons continued with the enrichment of the West Front until about 1260.\nKing John was excommunicated between 1209 and 1213. During this time, work on the cathedral was suspended. In this period, building methods advanced so that bigger blocks of masonry could be moved and put into the walls. The effect of this advance can be seen on the walls of the cathedral; at a point in the building's walls, the blocks of stone increase in size.\nBy the time the building was finished, including the Chapter House (1306),\nit already seemed too small for the developing liturgy, in particular the increasingly grand processions. A new spate of building was therefore started by Bishop John Drokensford. He heightened the central tower and began a dramatic eight-sided Lady chapel at the far east end, finished by 1326. Thomas of Whitney was the master mason.\nBishop Ralph of Shrewsbury followed. He continued the eastward extension of the quire. He also built Vicars' Close and the Vicars' Hall, to give the men of the choir a secure place to live and dine, away from the town with all its temptations.\nHe enjoyed an uneasy relationship with the citizens of Wells, partly because of his imposition of taxes. He surrounded his palace with crenellated walls and a moat and drawbridge. The Palace was now a castle.\nThe appointment of William Wynford as master mason in 1365 marked another period of activity. He was one of the foremost architects of his time and, apart from Wells, was engaged in work for the king at Windsor and at New College, Oxford University and Winchester Cathedral. Under Bishop John Harewell, he built the south-west tower of the West Front and designed the north west, which was built to match in the early 15th century. Inside the building he filled in the early English lancet windows with delicate tracery.\nIn the fourteenth century, the central piers (upright supports) of the crossing (where the building forms a cross) started sinking under the weight of the crossing tower. 'Scissor arches' were inserted to brace and stabilize the piers as a unit. The building was now complete, and it looked much as it does today."}

It was originally a two-storey structure where liturgical processions could gather before entering the nave. It was opened up into a single vaulted space in the 18th century. Several details of its decoration, particularly the 'syncopated arches' and the use of Purbeck marble shafts, reflect the influence of St Hugh's Choir at Lincoln Cathedral, built a few years earlier.\nWork began on a new eastern end in 1234, replacing the short Norman chancel with a much grander 10-bay structure. Northwold's chancel, completed by around 1252, adopted several of the stylistic elements already used in the Galilee porch.\nLater.\nDuring the dissolution of the monasteries by Henry VIII, the monastery at Ely was dissolved in 1539. Ely suffered less than many other monasteries, but even so, statues were destroyed together with carvings and stained glass. St Etheldreda's Shrine was destroyed.\nThe Cathedral was refounded with a Chapter of eight canons in 1541, as was the Kings School. Robert Steward, the last Prior of the monastery, became the first Dean.\nRecent crisis.\nIn 1986 it was discovered that the roofs, timber and stonework of much of the Cathedral were becoming unsafe. A public appeal was launched. \u00a34,000,000 was needed to secure the Cathedral's future and to prevent its doors being closed for good. In just over a year, the money was given or promised. The Great Restoration was completed in the year 2000.\nStained Glass Museum.\nThe south gallery of the nave is home to The Stained Glass Museum, a collection of stained glass from the 13th century to the present that is of national importance. It includes works from several notable modern artists."}

It is the seat of the Bishop of Exeter. The present building was complete by about 1400, and has the longest uninterrupted vaulted ceiling in England, and other notable features. The cathedral is built in Gothic style.\nHistory.\nIn 1107, William Warelwast, a nephew of William the Conqueror, was appointed to the see, and this was the catalyst for the building of a new cathedral in the Norman style. Its official foundation was in 1133, after Warelwast's time, but it took many more years to complete. In 1258 the building was already outmoded, and it was rebuilt in the Decorated English Gothic architecture style, following the example of nearby Salisbury Cathedral. However, much of the Norman building was kept, including the two massive square towers and part of the walls. It was constructed entirely of local stone, including Purbeck Marble. The new cathedral was complete by about 1400, apart from the addition of the chapter house and chantry chapels.\nWorld War II.\nOn 4 May 1942, an early morning air raid took place over Exeter. The cathedral sustained a direct hit by a large high-explosive bomb on the chapel of St James, completely demolishing it. The muniment room above, three bays of the aisle and two flying buttresses were also destroyed in the blast. The medieval wooden screen opposite the chapel was smashed into many pieces by the blast, but it has been reconstructed and restored. Fortunately many of the cathedral's most important artifacts, such as the glass of the great east window, the misericords, the Exeter Book, the bishop's throne and the Bronescombe Effigy, had been removed at the start of the war in anticipation of such an attack. Subsequent repairs and the clearance of the area around the western end of the building uncovered portions of earlier structures, including remains of the Roman city and of the original Norman cathedral.\nAstronomical clock.\nThe clock is one of a group of famous 14th to 16th century astronomical clocks to be found in the West of England. Another one is at Wells Cathedral.\nThe main, lower, dial is the oldest part of the clock, dating from 1484. The fleur-de-lys 'hand' indicates the time (and the position of the sun in the sky) on a 24-hour analogue dial. The numbering consists of two sets of I-XII Roman numerals. The silver ball and inner dial shows both the age of the moon and its phase (using a rotating black shield to indicate the moon's phase). The upper dial, added in 1760, shows the minutes.\nThe Latin phrase \"Pereunt et Imputantur\", a favourite motto for clocks and sundials was written by the Latin poet Martial. It is usually translated as \"they perish and are reckoned to our account\", referring to the hours that we spend, wisely or not. The original clockwork mechanism was much modified, repaired, and neglected until it was replaced in the early 20th century. The door below the clock has a round hole near its base. This was cut in the early 17th century to allow entry for the Bishop's cat to deter vermin. The vermin were attracted to the animal fat used to lubricate the clock mechanism."}

{"id": "117136", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=117136", "title": "Manorialism", "text": "Manorialism (Seigneurialism) is the name for the organization of the economy in the Middle Ages in Europe. The economy relied mainly on agriculture. Manorialism describes how land was distributed and who profited from the land.\nA lord received a piece of land, usually from a higher nobleman, or from the king. When he received the land, he also received all that was on it. That means that most of the people that lived on the land also belonged to the nobleman. The people, called peasants, had to pay to the lord, or they had to work for him. This way, the nobleman could live and support his family from what he received from the peasants. He had also certain legal powers, like that of a police force. The peasants were commoners or subjects and had to pay tribute to the lord. In return they received protection. \nThe tribute the subjects had to pay varied. It could be money but subsistence farming meant most had no money. They could pay by doing work for their lord, or pay a certain part of what they earned (like \"one tenth\"). That meant that if they grew a crop such as some form of corn, the lord got a tenth of their earnings in corn. This is also called \"payment in nature\" or sharecropping.\nCommon features.\nManors each had up to three different classes of land: \nSometimes the lord had a mill, a bakery or a wine-press. This could be used by the peasants against a fee. Similarly, the right to hunt or to let pigs feed in his woodland was subject to a fee. The peasants could use the lord's legal system to settle their disputes - for a fee. Single payments were due on each change of tenant. On the other side of the account, manorial administration involved significant expenses. This might be one of the reasons why smaller manors tended to rely less on villein tenure. \nDependent holdings were held by agreement of lord and tenant, but tenure became in practice usually hereditary, with a payment made to the lord on each succession of another member of the family. Villein land could not be abandoned, at least as long as every fleeing peasant was likely to starve to death; nor could they be passed to a third party without the lord's permission, and the customary payment. \nThough not free, villeins were definitely not slaves: they enjoyed legal rights, subject to local custom, and had recourse to the law, subject to court charges which were an additional source of manorial income. Sub-letting of villein holdings was common, and labour on the demesne might be commuted into an additional money payment, as happened increasingly from the 13th century. \nThis description of a manor house at Chingford, Essex in England was recorded in a document for the Chapter of St Paul's Cathedral when it was granted to Robert Le Moyne in 1265:\nVariation among manors.\nFeudal society is based on two principles, that of feudalism and manorialism. The structures of manorialism varied though. In the later Middle Ages, areas of incomplete or non-existent manorialisation persisted while the manorial economy underwent substantial development as economic conditions changed.\nNot all manors had all three kinds of land: as an average, demesne accounted for roughly a third of the arable area and villein holdings rather more; but some manors consisted solely of demesne, others solely of peasant holdings. Similarly, the proportion of unfree and free tenures could vary greatly. This meant that the amount of wage labour to perform agricultural work on the demesne varied as well. The proportion of the cultivated area in demesne tended to be greater in smaller manors. The share of villein land was greater in large manors, providing the lord with a larger potential supply of obligatory labour for demesne work. The proportion of free tenements was generally less variable, but tended to be somewhat greater on the smaller manors. \nManors varied also in their geographical arrangement: most did not coincide with a single village. Often, parts of two or more villages belonged to the manor, or were shared between several manors. In those places, peasants living far from the lord's estate sometimes paid cash instead of working for the lord. \nThe demesne was usually not a single plot of land. It consisted of some land around the central house and estate buildings. The rest of the demesne land was in the form of strips dispersed through the manor. In addition, the lord might lease free tenements belonging to neighbouring manors, as well as holding other manors some distance away to provide a greater range of produce. \nNot all manors were held by laymen lords who rendered military service or paid cash to their superior. A survey done in 1086 estimates that 17% belonged directly to the king, and that a greater proportion (rather more than a quarter) were held by bishops and monasteries. These church manors were usually larger, with a significantly greater villein area than the lay manors next to them. \nThe effect of circumstances on manorial economy is complex and at times contradictory: upland conditions have been seen as tending to preserve peasant freedoms (livestock husbandry in particular being less labour-intensive and therefore less demanding of villein services); on the other hand, some such areas of Europe have been said to show some of the most oppressive manorial conditions, while lowland eastern England is credited with an exceptionally large free peasantry, in part a legacy of Scandinavian settlement.\nSimilarly, the spread of money economy is often seen as having stimulated the replacement of labour services by money payments, but the growth of the money supply and resulting inflation after 1170 initially led nobles to take back leased estates and to re-impose labour dues as the value of fixed cash payments declined in real terms.\nHistorical development and geographical distribution.\nToday, the term is used most to refer to medieval Western Europe. A similar system was used in the rural parts of the late Roman Empire. The birthrate and population were declining. Labor was therefore the most important factor for production. Successive administrations tried to stabilise the imperial economy by freezing the social structure into place: sons were to succeed their fathers in their trade.\nCouncillors were forbidden to resign, and \"coloni\", the cultivators of land, were not to move from the demesne they were attached to. They were on their way to becoming serfs. Several factors conspired to merge the status of former slaves and former free farmers into a dependent class of such \"coloni\". Laws of Constantine I around 325 reinforced both the negative semi-servile status of the \"coloni\" and limited their rights to sue in the courts. Their numbers were augmented by barbarian \"foederati\" who were permitted to settle within the imperial boundaries.\nAs the Germanic kingdoms succeeded Roman authority in the West in the fifth century, Roman landlords were often simply replaced by Gothic or Germanic ones, with little change to the underlying situation. The process of rural self-sufficiency was given an abrupt boost in the eighth century, when normal trade in the Mediterranean Sea was disrupted. The thesis put forward by Henri Pirenne, disputed by many, supposes that the Arab conquests forced the medieval economy into even greater ruralisation and gave rise to the classic feudal pattern of varying degrees of servile peasantry underpinning a hierarchy of localised power centres."}

The first CCHA, formed in 1971, folded after the 2012\u201313 season. In February 2020, seven schools within the original CCHA's Midwestern footprint announced they would start play in a new CCHA in the 2021\u201322 season. Another Midwestern school joined the new CCHA in July 2020. \nOriginal league.\nThe first version of the CCHA was launched in 1971 by four schools\u2014Bowling Green, Ohio, Ohio State, and Saint Louis. They would add Lake Superior State a year later, but lost the two Ohio schools in 1973. The CCHA recovered from this early blow in 1975 when Ohio State returned and Western Michigan joined for the first time. Saint Louis would stop playing hockey in 1979, but the Billikens were immediately replaced by Ferris State. In the last years of the decade, the CCHA became viewed as a major conference, and by 1980 Northern Michigan, which had joined in 1977, reached the championship game of the NCAA tournament. Later that year, another Ohio school, Miami, joined.\nIn 1981, the CCHA attracted four schools from the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA)\u2014Michigan, Michigan State, Michigan Tech, and Notre Dame. While Notre Dame shut down its men's hockey team in 1983, and Michigan Tech left the following year to return to the WCHA, the other two schools remained in the CCHA until the original league folded. UIC joined in 1982. The CCHA continued to gain respect, with Bowling Green becoming the CCHA's first NCAA champion in 1984.\nThe league stayed mostly stable through the 1990s. In 1992, Kent State joined, and Notre Dame brought back its hockey program and rejoined. While Kent State folded its hockey team two years later, and UIC did the same in 1996, the CCHA added three more members in that decade. Alaska joined in 1995, Northern Michigan returned the same year, and Nebraska\u2013Omaha (now known for sports as simply \"Omaha\") joined in 1999. From that point, the league lost only one member (Nebraska\u2013Omaha to the WCHA in 2010) before its demise.\nThe trigger for the demise of the original CCHA was a large donation by energy billionaire Terry Pegula to his alma mater of Pennsylvania State University (Penn State). This donation funded the startup expenses for varsity men's and women's hockey teams at the university, plus a new arena for both teams. Once Penn State's teams took the ice in 2012\u201313, it gave the Big Ten Conference the six schools it needed to begin sponsoring men's ice hockey. Among these six were three of the CCHA's most important members in Michigan, Michigan State, and Ohio State. The Big Ten announced in 2011 that it would start a men's hockey league in 2013\u201314, and the three Big Ten members announced they would leave the CCHA at that time.\nSoon after the Big Ten announcement, a group of six schools\u2014five from the WCHA plus CCHA member Miami (Ohio)\u2014formed the National Collegiate Hockey Conference (NCHC), which began play in 2013\u201314. Within a few months, all of the other CCHA schools said they would also leave, with Western Michigan joining the NCHC, Notre Dame joining Hockey East, and the rest joining the WCHA.\nThroughout its history, the original CCHA only sponsored men's ice hockey\u2014only one of its 11 final members had a varsity women's hockey team, namely Ohio State. The champion was automatically invited to the NCAA Division I men's hockey tournament.\nThe CCHA members in its final season of 2012\u201313 were:\nNew CCHA.\nIn June 2019, seven of the 10 men's members of the WCHA, all Midwestern schools, announced that they would leave that league at the end of the 2020\u201321 season. By this time, the men's WCHA featured these schools, plus Alabama\u2013Huntsville, Alaska, and Alaska\u2013Anchorage. Their announcement stated that they were considering forming a new, more geographically compact league. On February 18, 2020 these seven schools announced they would begin competing in a new CCHA in 2021\u201322.\nOn July 30, 2020, St. Thomas, a Twin Cities school that would eventually start a move from NCAA Division III to Division I in July 2021 by joining the Summit League (which does not sponsor hockey), was announced as the eighth member of the new CCHA."}

Afterwards, Parks was brought in as a bodyguard to Kid Kash. They continued to be allies until October, when Kash berated Abyss for losing a match and Abyss turned on and attacked Kash. Abyss gained a victory over Kash, but then lost a First Blood Steel Chair on a Pole match to his former partner. Soon after the loss the feud between the two ended.\nSoon after, Abyss aligned himself with Don Callis. With this new alliance, Abyss soon feuded with Raven. The feud lasted for the rest of 2003, with the final match pitting Abyss and the Red Shirt Security (Kevin Northcutt and Legend) against Raven and The Gathering in a Steel Cage match. Abyss and his team came out victorious when the Gathering turned on Raven.\nGoing into 2004, Abyss entered his first major feud with A.J. Styles. On one show, Abyss was forced to team with Styles in a NWA World Tag Team Championship match against champions Red Shirt Security. Styles and Abyss won the titles, even when Abyss abandoned Styles near the beginning of the match. Abyss defeated Styles in a normal match the following show, and on the next gained control of the titles, defeating Styles in a Four Corners Tables match (Abyss was later stripped of the titles). The following show, both men fought to a no-contest in a Falls Count Anywhere match. The next show, Abyss defeated Styles again, this time in a Ladder match to become the top contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Abyss lost the right to Raven in a match that also involved Styles and Ron Killings.\nAbout a month after the feud with Styles, Abyss received a new manager, Goldy Locks. She used Abyss to defeat her ex-boyfriend Erik Watts to win his contract. She kept using Abyss to win contracts for her, while also adding Alex Shelley to her group to assist. However, Goldylocks pampered Shelley and treated Abyss poorly. Watts returned for revenge, with Abyss, Shelley, and Goldylocks taking on Watts, Sonny Siaki, and Desire in a Six Person Mixed Tag Team match. During the match, Abyss turned on his team, attacking Goldylocks, and leaving the match and her for good.\nNot long after separating from Goldylocks, Abyss began to feud with Monty Brown and Raven. The feud escalated into the first ever Monster's Ball match at TNA's first monthly pay per view, Victory Road. At Victory Road, Brown won the unique match when he pinned Raven. Abyss and Brown continued to feud until they met in a Serengeti Survival match at Turning Point, when Brown again came out victorious. Abyss also happened to take part in an incident at Universal Studios between TNA and World Wrestling Entertainment. \nAbyss fought in a Gauntlet For The Gold match at Hard Justice.Abyss won the match and gave himself a spot into the King of the Mountain match at Slammiversary, pitting him against NWA World Heavyweight Champion A.J. Styles, Monty Brown, Raven, and Sean Waltman with the NWA title on the line. Abyss lost to Raven. Abyss got a title match in a Steel Chain Dog Collar match at No Surrender. In the end, Raven pinned Abyss to retain the title.Abyss got another title match at Lockdown in a Six Sides of Steel match against Christian Cage. Christian won but Abyss took the title belt. He would not give it back unless he got another title shot. He did and he lost. Abyss got one more title shot in the King of the Mountain match at Slammiversary. The match also including NWA World Champion Christian Cage, Ron Killings, Jeff Jarrett, and Sting. At the event, Jarrett won the match.\nAbyss was in the Fight for the Right Tournament. Abyss won the tournament and the right to face NWA World Champion Sting at Genesis for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Abyss faced Sting at the event, and defeated Sting by disqualification. TNA rules say the title can change hands on a disqualification which made Abyss Champion. He lost the title to Christian Cage in a match also involving Sting. On the February 14 edition of \"iMPACT!\", Abyss was supposed to face Scott Steiner but left the ring before the match but before leaving through the tunnel, Abyss, without showing his face, took off his mask. Abyss returned to action at Slammiversary 2008 after the X Division Championship match wearing a new gray and black mask and smashed D-von and won the Television Championship"}

It was remade for the Game Boy Advance as \"\".\nPlot.\nAfter waking up without dreams, Kirby goes to the Fountain of Dreams to investigate. In doing so, he learns that King Dedede has stole the Star Rod, by splitting it into seven pieces and giving six fragments to his allies and keeping one himself. Without the Star Rod, all of the inhabitants of Dream Land became restless and cannot dream. Kirby retrieves all fragments, in order to restore the rod and the dreams.\nKirby travels throughout seven worlds, defeating most enemies in order to collect the fragments. Once Kirby defeats King Dedede and rebuilds the Star Rod, he places it back into the Fountain of Dreams. However, an ominous black aura fills the skies as a dark creature named Nightmare emerges from the fountain. It turns out that Nightmare had corrupted the Star Rod, and King Dedede broke it with the intention of protecting Dream Land. Nightmare then flies off into space, and King Dedede inhales Kirby and the Star Rod and spits them into the air. Kirby uses the Star Rod to defeat both forms of Nightmare, and saves Dream Land once again.\nGameplay.\nThe player can get to the end of each level by walking, jumping and flying. Each level has enemies and things that get in the way, but sometimes these things also help Kirby. If Kirby touches an enemy, he loses a health point (he has six). Sometimes Kirby defeats mini-boss, before heading farther. Unlike the first \"Kirby\" game, it saves the game after each level. Players can go back to any level in the world that they have played by going through doors. There are seven worlds, and each world has between four and six levels, as well as a boss door and a Warp Star door. (Players can visit other worlds using Warp Stars). Except for World 7, each world also has one or more mini-games, a place to pick up powers, and an arena where Kirby fights a mini-boss.\nKirby can walk, jump, fly and inhale. Kirby can go as high as he wants as long as nothing blocks him, and he can fall back to the ground by exhaling. The puff of air can hurt enemies and break blocks.\nKirby can also inhale enemies and other things. He eats any food that he inhales, but enemies and other things remain in his mouth. He can either spit them back out and send them flying (hurting or destroying anything in their path), or he can swallow them. He also has a sliding move where he can kick enemies and blocks. When Kirby swallows an enemy, he \"copies\" that enemy's power. It is the first game in the series to do this, and Kirby has a lot of powers he can use. Once he has a special power, he can use it to fight enemies and solve puzzles. One example of a puzzle is where Kirby uses the Fire ability to light a cannon.\nMusic.\nAn official soundtrack was released on July 21, 1994. The vocalist was Mako Miyata.\nRemake.\nIn 2002, a remake titled Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land was released for the Game Boy Advance. The new version has, in addition to new visuals and sound, different minigames, a multiplayer mode, and other new features. However, it also had some criticism for the omission of certain materials that pushed the NES to the limit, and replaced by what is often considered lazy for the Game Boy Advance. For instance, the rotating pseudo-3D towers in Butter Building were removed. In addition, the difficulty is significantly lower. A demo of the game is available in \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\". In 2011, a re-release of \"Kirby's Adventure\" named \"3D Classics: Kirby's Adventure\" was released for the Nintendo 3DS. It is a 3D version of the game."}

He has become a symbolic figure in Australian history, folklore, books, art and movies. As a national icon, his image was used during the opening ceremony of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. He is remembered in the saying \"... as game as Ned Kelly\"; the word \"game\" in this case meaning \"brave\".\nWhile he was growing up, his family was often in trouble with the police. After fighting a policeman at his home in 1878, Kelly went to the bush to hide. He murdered three policemen who were searching for him. The government made Ned, his brother, and two friends outlaws. They became known as the Kelly Gang. Ned Kelly led the gang to rob a number of banks, and even capture a whole town. A final violent fight with police took place at Glenrowan. Kelly, dressed in home-made metal armour and helmet, was captured and sent to trial. Found guilty, he was hanged at the Melbourne Gaol in 1880.\nA painting of Kelly by Australian artist Sidney Nolan was sold in 2010 for AU$5.4 million, the highest price ever paid for an Australian painting.\nEarly life.\nBeveridge.\nEdward 'Ned' Kelly was born in Canadia, north of Melbourne, in June 1855. The actual date is not known because the birth was not registered on the government list of births, deaths and marriages in Victoria. His prison records give the date as 1856. He was the son of Irish Catholic parents, John \"Red\" Kelly and Ellen Quinn. Red Kelly had been a convict who had been sent to Van Diemen's Land in 1842 for stealing two pigs. He moved to Victoria in 1848. He met Ellen Quinn, who had come to Victoria from Ireland with her family in 1841. Red started working for Ellen's father, James Quinn, who was a farmer at Beveridge. Ned was probably born at his grandfather's house. Around 1860, Red built a small house for his family, which is still standing in Kelly Street.\nAvenel.\nWhen Ned was about nine, his father moved the family north to a new farm at Avenel. Ned saved a young boy, Richard Shelton, from drowning in Hughes Creek. The Shelton family, who owned the Royal Mail Hotel, gave Ned a sash made from green silk for his bravery. The sash was long and wide. He was wearing this sash under his armour when he was captured at Glenrowan. The sash, still covered in Ned Kelly's blood, is now kept in the Benalla Museum. Red was not a successful farmer and was soon arrested for stealing cattle. In May 1866, he was given one month in prison and had to pay a fine of \u00a325. Red died on 27 December 1866, and is buried in the Avenel Cemetery.\nGreta.\nEllen Kelly moved the family to Greta. There were other members of Ellen's family living in the area. Her father, James Quinn, had moved from Beveridge to a large farm, called Glenmore, on the King River in north east Victoria. Her sisters, Catherine and Jane, and their ten children, were farming at Greta. Their husbands, brothers John and Thomas Lloyd, were in prison for stealing cattle. When Ellen came to Greta, her brothers, James, William and John Quinn, moved from Glenmore to help the sisters and their families. Some of the Quinn family had also been sent to prison for cattle stealing. James, Ellen's brother, had been charged ten times for cattle stealing. In 1868, Red Kelly's brother, James Kelly, came to visit Ellen. He got drunk and after an argument with the sisters, tried to burn their house down. He was given the death penalty, but this was later changed to 15 years in prison. The police thought the whole family were trouble makers and criminal.\nEllen Kelly and her children moved to a farm on the Eleven Mile Creek, between Greta and Glenrowan. Ned Kelly started work cutting down trees, breaking in horses, herding cattle and putting up fences.\nGaol.\nOn 14 October 1869, 14-year-old Ned was arrested for stealing money from a Chinese man. Kelly spent ten days in the police station lockup but there was not enough proof to send Ned to court and he had to be set free. Ned also worked in the bush with ex-convict Harry Power. \nPower had escaped from a Melbourne Gaol and started bushranging. Kelly was arrested in May 1870 for helping Power to rob people. He was kept in the gaol at Kyneton for seven weeks. Soon after this, Ned was in trouble again. With his uncle, Jack Lloyd, Ned had got into a fight with a hawker (a traveling salesman). They then sent a rude letter and some calf's testicles to the hawker's wife. In October 1870 he was sent to Beechworth gaol for assault and for being rude to a lady. He spent five months in Gaol.\nJust three weeks after getting out of Gaol in April 1871, 16-year-old Ned was arrested again. He had ridden a friend's horse into Greta. He did not know that his friend, Isaiah \"Wild Wright\", had stolen the horse from the Mansfield post office. There was a fight when a policeman, Constable Hall, tried to arrest him. Hall tried to shoot Kelly three times, but his gun would not work so he hit him over the head with it instead. Kelly was sent to Pentridge Gaol in Melbourne. After four months he was moved to the prison ship, \"Sacramento\", at Williamstown. Prison ships were old ships that were used as extra prison space. Prisoners from the \"Sacremento\" worked during the day building a sea wall at Williamstown beach. They also worked on building a fort for the guns that were protecting Port Phillip Bay. Kelly was released from prison on 2 February 1874.\nIn August, Kelly met his friend \"Wild Wright\" in Beechworth. He must have been angry with Wright because of the stolen horse which had put him in prison. Behind the Imperial Hotel, they fought a bare knuckle boxing match that lasted for 20 rounds. Wright said later that \"...he gave me the hiding of my life.\" In September 1877, Kelly was arrested in Benalla, for being drunk, riding on a footpath and resisting arrest. Kelly escaped from the police while they were taking him to the courthouse. After a fight with the police, he ran across the road into a boot shop and locked the door. Kelly gave himself up when the judge came over to the shop. One of the policemen involved in the fight to arrest Kelly was Thomas Lonigan. Lonigan was later shot dead by Kelly at Stringybark Creek.\nThe Fitzpatrick Incident.\nConstable Fitzpatrick was in charge of the small police station in Greta. Because of the Kelly family's long history of criminal activity, Police Superintendent C. H. Nicholson had given orders that the police were not to go to the Kelly's house alone. But Fitzpatrick decided he would 'fix the Greta mob'. In April 1878, he went to the house to arrest Ned's brother, Dan Kelly for horse stealing. Dan had only been recently let out of prison. Fitzpatrick was probably drunk, as he had stopped at the Winton hotel to drink brandy. Dan Kelly refused to go back to the police station with Fitzpatrick, because the policeman did not have a warrant, the official document needed to make an arrest. Fitzpatrick then tried to make Kate, Ned's 15-year-old sister, sit on his knee so he could kiss her. This started a fight with members of the family and Fitzpatrick hurt his wrist. He and Ellen, Kate's mother, agreed to forget what had happened. But when Fitzpatrick went back to the Benalla police station he said Ned had shot at him three times and Ellen Kelly had hit him on the head with a shovel. Fitzpatrick lost his job with the police in 1881 after the head of the police force said he was a \"liar\".\nA group of police led by Sergeant Steele went back to Greta, and arrested Ellen Kelly (with her baby Alice King), her son-in-law William Skillion, and a neighbour, William \"Bricky\" Williamson, for the attempted murder of Constable Fitzpatrick. Ned and Dan Kelly were not at the house and could not be arrested. Ellen Kelly said that Ned was not involved, and that he was working away. After a trial in Beechworth, Ellen Kelly was sentenced by Judge Redmond Barry to three years in prison for trying to kill Constable Fitzpatrick. Skillion and Williamson were given six years in prison. The police offered a reward of \u00a3100 for the capture of the Kelly brothers. In 1881 Williamson was let out of prison and given a full pardon because the government knew that he was innocent.\nThe Kelly Gang.\nStringybark Creek.\nNed and Dan Kelly went into hiding in the bush. They were later joined by two friends, Joe Byrne and Steve Hart. On 25 October 1878, two groups of police set out to find the Kellys. They knew the two brothers were hiding in the Wombat Ranges, a mountain range between Greta and Mansfield. One group started south from Greta led by Senior Constable Strahan. Strahan said he would shoot the Kellys down like dogs. A second group led by Sergeant Michael Kennedy set off from Mansfield heading north. Three other policemen were with him: Constables Thomas McIntyre, Thomas Lonigan, and Michael Scanlon. They set up a camp at Stringybark Creek in a thick forest area.\nKennedy and Scanlon went searching for the Kellys, while Lonigan and McIntyre remained at the camp. The Kellys were living in a hut nearby at Bullock Creek. They heard noises and discovered the police camp. They decided to capture the policemen and take their guns and horses. Ned and Dan went to the police camp and told them to surrender. Constable McIntyre put his arms up, but Lonigan got out his gun. Ned Kelly shot him dead. When the other two police returned to camp, McIntyre told them to surrender. When Scanlon went for his gun Kelly also shot him dead. Kennedy ran shooting from tree to tree with Kelly chasing him. Kelly shot him twice, in the armpit and in the chest. Kelly later said that Kennedy \"...appeared to be suffering very much and in great agony...I did not wish to leave him alone to linger out in such pain.\". Ned put his gun against Kennedy's chest and shot him again. Ned Kelly went back to the camp to get Kennedy's cloak which he then placed over the body. McIntyre escaped during the confusion and went back to Mansfield to tell everyone what had happened.\nThe Victorian government passed a law on 30 October 1878, to make the Kelly gang outlaws. This meant they no longer had any legal rights and could be shot by anyone. Anyone who could capture any member of the gang, alive or dead, would be paid a reward of \u00a3500, or \u00a32,000 for all four men. At this time the police did not know that Hart and Byrne were members of the gang. The gang were seen at several places around north east Victoria. They tried to cross the Murray River to go into New South Wales, but the water was too deep. The police had several large groups hunting for them.\nEuroa.\nOn 10 December 1878, the gang robbed the Australian National Bank at Euroa. They had stopped at Faithful Creek station (a farm) and held the people there prisoners. They locked 22 people including farm workers, hawkers (traveling salesmen) and visitors into a storeroom. Joe Byrne kept guard while the rest of the gang went into Euroa. They went to the bank and said they had a message from McCauley, the farm manager. They got into the bank and held up the bank's manager Robert Scott, along with two tellers (bank workers). After taking all the money, the gang forced Scott, his wife, family, maids and tellers to go with them back to Faithful Creek. They were locked up with the other hostages.\nThe outlaws gave a display of horse riding and tricks which entertained and surprised their hostages. After having supper, and telling the people not to leave the farm for another three hours, the gang left. The crime was carried out without injury and the gang stole \u00a32,000.\nJerilderie.\nThe police increased the reward on the Kelly Gang. More police were sent to guard banks in the country. Friends of the Kellys were locked in gaol. The gang crossed the Murray River and rode north into New South Wales. They arrived in Jerilderie on Saturday 8 February 1879. They broke into the local police station and locked the two policemen, Richards and Devine, in the police cells. The outlaws put on police uniforms and mixed with the local people. They said that they were extra police from Sydney, who had come to guard the town from the Kelly gang. Ned Kelly took his horse to the blacksmith to get new horseshoes and told the man to send the bill to the New South Wales police force. On Monday the gang rounded up various people and forced them into the back room of the Royal Mail Hotel. While Dan Kelly and Steve Hart kept the hostages busy with \"drinks on the house\" (free drinks), Ned Kelly and Joe Byrne went to the telegraph office and cut down some of the poles and cut the wires. They then went and robbed the local bank of about \u00a32,414. Kelly also burned all the townspeople's mortgage deeds in the bank. When the gang left the town they were singing about two earlier bushrangers, Ben Hall and Dan Morgan: \"Hurrah for the good old times of Morgan and Ben Hall.\"\nFor the next 18 months the police were not able to find the Kelly gang. They punished anyone they thought might be helping the gang. More than 20 people were locked up in the Beechworth Prison for three months only because they were said to be friends of the gang. None of these people were ever charged with a crime. The government thought the Kelly gang might try and free their friends, so they put up large iron gates on the entrance to the prison.\nThe Jerilderie Letter.\nMonths before going to Jerilderie, and with help from Joe Byrne, Ned Kelly dictated a long letter (56 pages). The letter told his story, about how he became a bushranger, and the treatment of his family by the police. It also told the story of the treatment of Irish Catholics by the police and the English and Irish Protestant farmers. He even said there might be a revolution by people in north east Victoria to set up their own republic.\nThe \"\", as it is called, is a document of about 8,300 words and has become a famous piece of Australian literature. Kelly had written an earlier letter on 14 December 1878, to Donald Cameron, a member of the Parliament of Victoria, but it had been ignored. The Jerilderie Letter was never published. Kelly tried to find the editor of the local newspaper and get him to print the letter. He finally gave the letter to Edward Living, a teller at the bank. Living kept the letter, which was not re-discovered until 1930. It was then published by the \"Melbourne Herald\". The handwritten letter was given to the State Library of Victoria in 2000. Kelly's words are colorful, rough and full of metaphors. He said the police were \"... big ugly fat-necked wombat headed big bellied magpie legged narrow hipped splay footed sons of Irish bailiffs or English landlords ...\".\n\"Last stand\".\nGlenrowan.\nThe gang decided that Aaron Sherritt, Joe Byrne's best friend, was a police spy. On the night of 26 June 1880, Dan Kelly and Joe Byrne went to Sherritt's house in the Woolshed Valley near Beechworth and killed him. The four policemen who were protecting him at the time hid under the bed and did not report the murder until the next day. The outlaws knew that the police would send extra men to Beechworth by train to try and capture them. Ned Kelly and Hart arrived in Glenrowan on 27 June, and took 70 hostages at the Glenrowan Inn (hotel). They knew that a train loaded with police was on its way. They forced railway workers at Glenrowan to pull up the rail tracks to make the train crash. The bushrangers, wearing homemade armour, would then capture any of the policemen that were alive after the crash. With the police out of the way, the Kelly Gang would then go into Benalla and rob the bank. The captured police would be released when Ellen Kelly, William Williamson, and William Skillion, were let out of gaol.\nBut the plan to derail the police train failed. The police protecting Aaron Sherritt were too scared to leave his hut and the murder was not reported until the next day. The Kellys had to wait 24 hours longer for the police train than they had planned. The hostages were becoming difficult to control. To keep them amused the outlaws held a dance in the hotel, where Kelly danced a quadrille with Jane Jones, daughter of the hotel owner. They also had sporting events including the hop, step and jump. Kelly used two revolvers as extra weights while taking part in the jumping. A local school teacher, Thomas Curnow, talked Ned into letting him take his family home. As soon as he was free Curnow went down to the railway line, waving a lantern (light) wrapped in his red scarf. The train stopped safely.\nThe 46 police quickly left the train and placed themselves around the hotel so that the Kelly Gang was trapped inside. The gang members put on their armour, made from plough parts. All four had helmets. Each man's armour was quite heavy; Ned's armour weighed , which was about half his body weight. The police fired their guns into the building for seven hours. It is estimated that 15,000 bullets were fired during the shooting. The police ordered a cannon from Melbourne so that they could destroy the inn, but it would take too long to arrive so they set fire to the building instead.\nAt dawn on Monday 28 June, Ned Kelly came out of the inn wearing his armour. He marched towards the police, firing his gun at them. Their bullets bounced off his armour. Sergeant Steel shot him in his legs that were not protected by armour. Joe Byrne died in the front room from loss of blood because a gunshot cut his femoral artery. Dan Kelly and Steve Hart may have killed themselves as their bodies were found lying side by side in a back room with their heads on blankets. They had taken off their armour and it was found next to them. Several hostages were shot, and three died, including 13-year-old Jack Jones, the son of the hotel owner. Martin Cherry, a railway worker, was rescued from the burning hotel but died soon afterwards. George Metcalfe, a quarry worker, who was forced to pull up the railway line died later from injuries. The police had one small injury; the police Superintendent, Francis Hare, received a wound to his wrist, then fled the battle. The Royal Commission set up to examine the Kelly Gang later removed Hare from the Victoria Police.\nTrial and execution.\nNed Kelly was taken to the Melbourne Gaol where he was treated for his wounds. He was visited by his mother who was in the same prison for wounding Constable Fitzpatrick. In August he was taken back to Beechworth by train for the first court hearings. The court agreed that Kelly would be tried in court for the murder of Thomas Lonigan and Michael Scanlon at Stringybark Creek. The government thought people around Beechworth might not find Kelly guilty of the crimes, and so they had the trial moved to Melbourne. At the trial the jury found Kelly guilty of both murders. He was sentenced to death by the Irish-born judge Sir Redmond Barry with the words \"May God have mercy on your soul\". Kelly said \"I will go a little further than that, and say I will see you there when I go\".\nMany people did not agree with the death sentence. A petition with more than 60,000 names asked the government for mercy. Ned Kelly was hanged on 11 November 1880, at the Melbourne Gaol for murder. Several newspapers including \"The Age\" and \"The Herald\" reported Kelly's last words as \"Such is life\". Sir Redmond Barry died after a short illness on 23 November, 1880, only 12 days after Kelly's death.\nRe-burial and recent DNA testing.\nNed Kelly was buried in an unmarked grave at the Melbourne Gaol, in an area with other criminals who had also been hanged at the gaol. The bones of 32 people were dug up in 1929 when the gaol was being redeveloped, and reburied at Pentridge Gaol in Coburg, Victoria. The burial site at Pentridge was rediscovered in 2008. DNA testing has proved that one set of bones was the skeleton of Ned Kelly. Experts from the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine said that the DNA clearly matches one of Kelly's living relatives. The bones show some of the injuries Kelly got during the shoot out with the police. The Kelly skeleton does not have a skull.\nA skull, said to be Kelly's, was found during the digging at the gaol in 1929. It was put on display at the Old Melbourne Gaol, but it was stolen in 1978. On the anniversary of Ned Kelly's hanging, 11 November 2009, a farmer from Western Australia gave a skull back to Heritage Victoria which he said had been taken from the gaol. It was tested for DNA to see if it was Ned Kelly's skull. These tests showed it was not, and the location of Kelly's skull is still unknown.\nIn 2013, the Victorian Government finally gave Kelly's remains to his family. A funeral service was held at St. Patrick's Church, Wangaratta on 18 January, 2013. During the service, family members who read from the Bible wore a green silk sash. Relatives of Constable Michael Scanlon and Aaron Sherrit also attended the service. Kelly was buried in an unmarked grave at Greta on 20 January 2013.\nThe DNA that was recovered from Ned's skeleton was mitochondrial DNA. That was matched with one of Ned's maternal relations (Ned's grand nephew Leigh Olver). No adequate quality Y-DNA was recovered from Ned's bones or has been recovered from any of Ned's known paternal side relatives (Y-DNA is passed from father to son). There is a chance that a Y-DNA sample may be isolated from Ned's bones one day using more advanced laboratory procedures, however, it is also possible that a Y-DNA sample could be taken from the remains of one of Ned's male relatives such as his father, his uncles or his brothers. Their graves are all well known. A Y-DNA sample would reveal exactly which Kelly line Ned belongs to. Currently the Kelly Surname Y-DNA study has the results of over 500 Y-DNA samples but no comparison can be made until a sample from one of Ned's family is obtained. Based on location, the most frequent Kelly line in south-west Ireland (Tipperary, Clare and Kerry) is the O'Brien-Kelly line (L226+).\nThe Ned Kelly story.\nNed Kelly is still a major part of Australian popular culture. His story has been told in books, movies, plays and television shows. His image has been used for everything from cakes to tattoos. A recent study showed that people with a Ned Kelly tattoo were eight times more likely to be murdered. In 1980, the Australian Post Office released a set of postage stamps to remember the 100th anniversary of the siege at Glenrowan. In 2010 the National Gallery of Victoria paid AU$2.2 million for a painting of Ned Kelly by artist Sidney Nolan. It was Nolan's paintings of Ned Kelly that inspired the opening ceremony of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. In June 2011 the Williamstown Australian Rules Football Club claimed that Ned Kelly had played 11 games for the club in 1873 while serving time in the prison ship. It was also claimed that in 1928 they had found a suit of armour buried on the football ground."}
