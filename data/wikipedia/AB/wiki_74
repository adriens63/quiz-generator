In Islam, he is the penultimate prophet and messenger of God in Islam, sent to guide the Children of Israel with a revelation: \"Inj\u012bl\". He is believed to be a descendant of Ibrahim, and is seen as an example for all Muslims to follow. According to the Quran, Jibrael told that the name of the figure will be Masih Isa.\nAccording to the Quran, Isa foretold the coming of Muhammad in As-Saff 61:6. In Islam, Isa is the only prophet to return. Muslims believe that Isa will return in a Second Coming to fight Gog and Magog and \"Al-Masih ad-Dajjal\" or \"False Messiah\" and establish peace and justice on earth.\nHistory.\nBirth.\nThe birth narrative in the Quran for Isa begins at Quran 19:16\u201334 and Q3:45\u201353. Islamic theology affirms Maryam as a pure vessel. Islamic exegesis affirms the virginal birth of Isa. The narrative of the virgin birth is an announcement to Mary by the angel Gabriel while Mary is being raised in the Temple after having been pledged to God by her mother. Gabriel states she is honored over all women of all nations and has brought her glad tidings of a holy son. A hadith narrated by Abu Hurairah, quotes Muhammad explaining that both Jesus and Mary were protected from Satan's touch at birth, quoting from Q3:36. The Quran states that son of Maryam and his mother a sign; and we made them abide in an elevated place, full of quiet and watered with springs.\"\nProphethood.\nSome Muslims believe that Isa became a prophet when he was born and spoke in infancy. From the Islamic basis, reflected upon all previous prophets through the lens of Muslim identity, Isa is considered no more than a messenger repeating a repetitive message of the ages. Some Islamic traditions believe Isa's mission was only to the people of Israil and his status as a prophet being confirmed by numerous miracles.\nRevelation.\nMuslims believe that God revealed to Isa a new scripture, \"Inj\u012bl\" (the Gospel), while also declaring the truth of the previous revelations: \"Tawrat\" (the Torah) and \"Zabur\" (the Psalms). The Quran speaks favorably of \"al-Inj\u012bl.\" Traditional Islamic exegesis claiming the biblical message to have been distorted or corrupted. This polemic effort has its origins in the medieval period with Abd al-Jabbar ibn Ahmad's writings.\nDisciples.\nThe Quran states that Isa was aided by a group of disciples who believed in His message. The Quran mentions in chapter 3, verses 52\u201353, that the disciples submitted to the faith of Islam:\nThe longest narrative involving Isa's disciples is when Jesus performs the miracle of bringing a table of food from heaven at their request, for further proof that his preaching is the true message.\nAscension.\nMuslims believe that Isa was not crucified and was raised up into the skies instead of being crucified. Muslims believe that a lookalike was crucified. According to some Shia writings, Isa ascended to heaven wearing a woolen shirt, spun and sewed by Maryam, his mother. As he reached the heavenly regions, he was addressed, 'O Isa, cast away from you the adornment of the world.\nReturn.\nAccording to Islam, Isa Masih will descent at a white minaret, on the eastern side of Damascus (believed to be the Minaret of Isa in the Umayyad Mosque), Isa would slay the Dajjal, and then everyone who is one of the People of the Book (\"ahl al-kit\u0101b\", referring to Jews, Sabians and Christians) will believe in him. Thus, there will be one community, that of Islam.\nAfter the death of \"al-Mahdi\", Jesus will assume leadership. This is a time associated in Islamic narrative with universal peace and justice. Islamic texts also allude to the appearance of \"Ya'juj and Ma'juj\" (known also as Gog and Magog), ancient tribes which will disperse and cause disturbance on earth. God, in response to Jesus' prayers, will kill them by sending a type of worm in the napes of their necks, and send large birds to carry and clear their corpses from the land. According to a hadith, Jesus will marry, have children and rule for forty years after which he will die. Isa would be buried in the city of Madinah in a grave left vacant beside Muhammad, Abu Bakr, and Umar."}

He decides to take his film festival to South Park instead. He plans to ruin South Park too and then move on to the next mountain town.\nMany film watchers come to South Park for the festival. The magical piece of feces, Mr. Hanky the Christmas Poo tells Kyle that the newcomers are killing him.

That means she wanted women to have the right to vote in British elections. She was involved in two major British women's suffrage societies. They were the militant Women's Social and Political Union and the United Suffragists. She helped start the United Suffragists. She became editor of the \"Votes for Women\" newspaper during the First World War. She was sent to prison twice. She was a book writer who was famous for her children's books.\nEarly life.\nEvelyn Sharp was born on 4 August 1869. She was the ninth of eleven children. Sharp's family sent her to a boarding school for just two years. However, she passed several university local examinations. Sharp moved to London although her family did not want her to. In London, she wrote several novels including \"All the Way to Fairyland\" (1898) and \"The Other Side of the Sun\" (1900).\nIn 1903, Sharp started writing articles for the \"Daily Chronicle\", the \"Pall Mall Gazette\" and the \"Manchester Guardian\" with the help of Henry Nevinson. Sharp talks about how important Nevison and the Men's League for Women's Suffrage is: \"It is impossible to rate too highly the sacrifices that they (Henry Nevinson and Laurence Housman) and H. N. Brailsford, F. W. Pethick Lawrence, Harold Laski, Israel Zangwill, Gerald Gould, George Lansbury, and many others made to keep our movement free from the suggestion of a sex war.\"\nSharp's journalism made her more aware of working-class women's problems. She joined the Women's Industrial Council and the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies. In the autumn of 1906 Sharp was sent by the \"Manchester Guardian\" to cover the first speech by Elizabeth Robins. After that speech, she joined the Women's Social and Political Union."}

It forms when a volcano throws viscous pieces of lava during a volcanic eruption. They cool into solid objects before they reach the ground. However, they are still very hot when they reach the ground, because they are still partly molten inside. Because volcanic bombs cool after they leave the volcano, they are extrusive igneous rocks. Volcanic bombs can be thrown many kilometers from an erupting fissure vent. They often get aerodynamic shapes during their flight. Lava bombs can be extremely large; the 1935 eruption of Mount Asama in Japan expelled bombs measuring 5\u20136\u00a0m (16-20 ft) in diameter up to from the vent. Volcanic bombs are a significant volcanic hazard, and can cause severe injuries and death to people in an eruption zone. One such incident occurred at Galeras volcano in Colombia in 1993; six people near the summit were killed and several seriously injured by lava bombs when the volcano erupted unexpectedly. On July 16, 2018, 23 people were injured on a tour boat near the Kilauea volcano as a result of a basketball-sized lava bomb from the 2018 lower Puna eruption.\nVolcanic bombs are known to occasionally explode from internal gas pressure as they cool, but in most cases, most of the damage they cause is when they hit. As they are still hot when they land, they often cause a fire to start. Bomb explosions are most often observed in \"bread-crust\" type bombs.\nOther websites.\n[[Category:Volcanology]]"}

Omayr either belonged to the tribe of Banu al-Alim or the tribe of Banu Kalb. He is known as the 'Christian Martyr of Karbala'.\nBefore being a soldier, Omayr was a well known businessman of Kufa. Omayr is well-known for his courage and soldierly experience. Omayr was a tall and masculine man with broad shoulders, who was held with very high esteem among his people.\nBiography.\nSome sources suggest that Omayr's full name was Abdullah ibn Omayr ibn Wahab ibn Abu Wahab al-Kalbi (). Al-Tabari suggests that Omayr was from the Banu al-Alim tribe.\nAccording to Abu Makhnaf, when Kufis were preparing to fight Husayn, Omayr confronted them and asked them about their intentions. Kufis told that they would fight Husayn and Omayr then went to his wife Wahab bint Abd and informed her of his intention. It is reported that Umm Wahab said: \"God has guided you to a good path, do so and take me with you\". So he went out with his wife at night and joined Husayn.\nOmayr was inspired by Husayn\u2019s spiritual charisma and was reluctant to leave him despite of being aware about the consequences of staying with Husayn. In the Battle of Karbala, when Omayr asked for the permission for fighting, Husayn granted him permission believing him to be match for both the challengers.\nOmayr stepped into the battlefield and the challengers asked his identity to which he introduced himself. However they could not recognize him and asked either Zuhayr ibn Qayn, Habib ibn Muzahir or Burayr to fight them. Yasir was standing nearby to whom Omayr said \"You son of the adulteress! Do you not wish to fight me?!\" saying this he attacked Yasir and engaged him in a sword duel but at the same time Salim charged at him with his sword. Omayr while protecting himself lost fingers of his left hand and in retaliatory attack he killed Salim and Yasir. After killing both of them he moved back to Husayn while reciting Martial poetry. Omayr's wife Umm Wahab witnessed Omayr's assassination.\nOmayr participated in the retaliatory attack when Al-Shimr attacked Al Husayn's right wing. Omayr in that engagement killed 31 of them, of which 19 were horsemen and 12 were footmen. His right hand was severed by Hani ibn Thabit and left hand by Bakr ibn Hayy having left without arms, he was taken captive and according to some sources, was a put on a cross. Then, Omayr's head was cut off and thrown towards Husayn's camp. According to Al-Tabari, Omayr became the second martyr in the Battle of Karbala. After Omayr's head was thrown, his mother picked it up, took it and wiped her son's blood from it and then ran in the direction of the enemy forces. Husayn sent her back saying that she was exempted from participating in Jihad. Omayr's wife Wahab bint Abd went to his corpse and wiped out the dust and the dirt from his head as well as his face. At this time, Shimr ibn Dhil's servant Rustam striked the woman's head with a spear, causing Umm Wahab to be killed. After Wahab bint Abd was also killed, Omayr's mother is reported to have said \"You wicked people! I bear witness that the Christians in their churches are better people than you\".\nLegacy.\nOmayr is highly honored by both Muslims and Christians for his sacrifice in the Battle of Karbala. He is believed to be buried in the Imam Husayn Shrine in Karbala. Every year, Muslims, as well as Christians, visit the site for commemoration on Ashura."}

There are some omissions: folios 1, 2, 70 to 170, and the end; and it is dated to 1306-1307, in a later inscription, which is nonetheless accepted. The text comprises four parts: the history of Persia and pre-Islamic Arabia, the story of the Prophet and Caliphs, the history of the Ghaznavids, Seljuks and Atabeys, and the history of the sultans of Khwarezm. This part of the manuscript was discovered in the 1800s by Duncan Forbes, who found it among the papers of Colonel John Baillie, so this section is sometimes referred to as \"Baillie's collection\".\nSeventy rectangular miniatures adorn the manuscript, which reflect the cosmopolitan nature of Tabriz at the time of its production. In this capital, a crossroads of trade routes and influences, and a place of great religious tolerance, Christian, Chinese, Buddhist and other models of painting all arrived to feed the inspiration of the artists.\nKhalili folios.\nA new painter appears for the portraits of Chinese leaders, which uses special techniques that seem to mimic those of Yuan mural painters (according to S. Blair): an attention to line and wash, and the use of black and bright red. This artist seems to be very familiar with China. The folios are dated 1314, and it was transcribed and illustrated in Tabriz under the supervision of Rashid al-Din.\nPersian manuscripts.\nThere are two early 14th century copies in Persian in the Topkapi Palace Library, Istanbul."}

{"id": "874384", "revid": "2133", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=874384", "title": "Islamic feminism", "text": "Feminism is the idea that different sexes and genders are equal in society, that no sex or gender is better or worse than another. Feminism wants women and men to have equal status and equal rights in society. Islamic feminism tries to bring these ideas to countries in which most people are Muslim. \nPeople who are in favor of the idea also say that there are several countries with Muslim majorities, where women had important roles: There were female heads of state, prime ministers, and state secretaries. Examples of such women are Lala Shovkat of Azerbaijan, Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan, Mame Madior Boye of Senegal, Tansu \u00c7iller of Turkey, Kaqusha Jashari of Kosovo, and Megawati Sukarnoputri of Indonesia. In Bangladesh, Khaleda Zia was elected the country's first female prime minister in 1991. She served as prime minister until 2009. Sheikh Hasina replaced her. Hasina is still prime minister in 2021. This makes Bangladesh the country with the longest continuous female premiership.\nUnlike other feminists, which are usually secular, Islamic feminists want to use Islam and its teachings for their ideas.\nOne of the things Islamic feminists want to reach is that men and women are truly equal in all aspects of daily life, and in society. They also want to include non-Muslims in their view and debate. Islamic scholars see Islamic feminism as more radical as secular feminism, because it uses Islam with the Quran as its most important text. As a \"school of thought\" it refers to people such as Morocccan sociologist Fatema Mernissi and scholars such as Amina Wadud and Leila Ahmed.\nDefinitions.\nIslamic feminists.\nIslamic feminists read the religious texts with a feminist perspective. They can ground their arguments in Islam and its teachings. They want gender justice and the full equality of women and men in the personal and public sphere. They also want to include non-Muslims in this discussion.\nIslamic scholars see Islamic feminism as more radical than secular feminism. They also think that Islamic feminism is part of the teachings of Islam with the Quran as its central text.\nRecently, more people have been talking about the concept of Islamic feminism. Different groups in societies which are influenced by Islam wanted to get more support for some of their ideas and policies. In addition, educated Muslim women want their role in society to be more important.\nUmm Yasmin, of the Centre for Muslim Minorities and Islam, says that feminism is often mistaken as a western movement. According to Yasmin, Muslim feminists have been active since the early nineteenth century. They do not want to change the religion of Islam, but rather \"promote gender equality within a secular society\". Yasmin also says that Muslim feminists have adapted their view: Islam can be seen in context, in order to speak about men and women being equal; for Islam doesn't condone violence against women. Since the nineteenth century, both men and women have questioned the legal system regarding the Sharia Laws: These laws say that women should wear a veil. They limit their education, and have an effect on women's seclusion, polygyny and concubinage. In this context, seclusion means that women need to stay at home, and that they need to ask for permission to see or talk to other people outside the family. Many Muslim women wanted to change these laws. They have started schools for girls, and have been opposed to veiling and one man being married to several women. In support of Yasmin's argument, Fatema Mernissi says that the fact that the ideal Muslim woman is shown as \"silent and obedient\" has nothing to do with the message of Islam. In her view, conservative Muslim men manipulated the religious texts of the Qu'ran to keep their patriarchal system. They did this to prevent women from breaking free, also sexually; with it, they justified a strict veiling and a limitation of women's rights.\nFeminism in Islam.\nMargot Badran says that Islamic feminism gets its understanding and mandate from the Qu'ran. According to her, it \"seeks rights and justice for women, and for men, in [all] their existence.\" In her writings, she explains that radical Islamists have corrupted Islam with the image of patriarchy and oppression to women. This image is what the rest of the world sees and understands Islam to be. Asma Barlas shares Badran's views. In her works, she discusses the difference between secular and Islamic feminism. According to her, \"in countries where Muslims make up 98% of the population, it is not possible to avoid questioning 'its basic beliefs.'\"\nFatima Seedat agrees with both Barlas and Badran about the importance of feminism in the Islamic world. According to her, the term \u201cIslamic feminism\u201d is unnecessary since feminism is a \u201csocial practice, not merely of personal identity.\u201d Seedat thinks that bringing Islam and feminism together creates more conflict. It allows Islamists to interpret the Qur'an to suit their political needs.\nShe believes it is important to show how feminism has existed in the Qur'an. In her view, keeping Islam and feminism separate is better for everyone. In the same article, \u201c\"Feminism, and Islamic Feminism: Between Inadequacy and Inevitability\"\u201d, Seedat explains that the fact that such a term exists, separates Muslims and isolates them from the rest of the world and the feminist movement. In her essay, she states that it is important to share what Islam has to offer feminism with the rest of the world. For this reason, Muslims who are feminists should not refer to themselves as Islamic feminists.\nMoroccan writer and sociologist, Fatema Mernissi wrote the essay \"Beyond the Veil\". In it, she explores the oppressive status of women in Islam, sexual ideology and gender identity through the perspective of Moroccan society and culture. \"Beyond the Veil\" argues against the discourse on women's sexuality by breaking their silence with providing a voice against the dominance of male patriarchy.\nContext in the Quran.\nThe following qoutes show the parts of Qu'ran to put feminism in context:\n\"\u201cO mankind!

The one of you is as the other (Literally: some of you from some others). So, the ones who emigrated, and were driven out of their residences, and were hurt in My way, and fought, and were killed, indeed I will definitely expiate them of their odious deeds, and indeed I will definitely cause them to enter Gardens from beneath which Rivers run.\" A requital from (the Providence of) Allah; and Allah has in His Providence the fairest requital. \u2014 Dr. Ghali\nNineteenth century.\nKhawla bint al-Azwar, was a legendary female Muslim warrior/soldier during the life of the prophet Mohammad. Her brother, Dhiraar al-Azwar, trained her to fight and she fought with him in many battles. Because soldiers wore loose clothing, and wrapped themselves in cloth to protect themselves from the sand and dust, the fact that she was a woman was not known. After she had shown her talent and skill in fighting, she told the men who were close by. \nHistory and context.\nAccording to Ahmed Elewa and Laury Silvers, many people have used Islamic tradition of the past 150 years to try to correct social errors done against Muslim women. According to them, a new form of Islamic law is being developed, to forbid practices such as female genital mutilation. People developing this law also want to make family codes (Personal law) equal, allow women to become clergy, or to help in mosques in other ways. They want women to be able to become judges in civil and religious institutions. Elewa and Silvers say that modern scholars see their work as restoration of rights provided by God and the prophet but denied by society.\nAs of the 2020s, there are many changes in the Muslim world. States where Islam is an important religion are often run by a single ruler, or a small group of people. These stats will need to change so that people can elect who represents them. Such a process is called democratic. When they go through this change, they will need to look to improve the situation of the people as to human rights, social justice and gender equality. Islamic feminists play an important role in this process. For example, in 2012, Jordanian women protested against laws that allowed the charge of rape to be dropped, if the rapist marries his victim, Tunisian women marched for equality for women in a new constitution, Saudi women protested against the ban against car driving, Sudanese women created a silent wall of protest demanding freedom for arrested women. Elizabeth Segran describes the Islamic feminist struggle of Malaysian activist Zainah Anwar. Segran says that just talking about human rights mentioned in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) does not create a direct response with ordinary women. Islam is the source of their values. For this reason, integrating human rights frameworks with Islam makes sense.\nIslamists.\nIslamists are advocates of political Islam. In their view the Quran and hadith want to establish a caliphate, an Islamic government. Some islamists say that women should have rights in public life. They do however not challenge gender inequality in the personal, private sphere.\nSu'ad al-Fatih al-Badawi, a Sudanese academic and Islamist politician, has argued that feminism is incompatible with \"taqwa\" (the Islamic idea of piety). In al-Badawi's view, Islam and feminism are mutually exclusive. Margot Badran of Georgetown University's Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding (now the Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding) argues that Islam and feminism are not mutually exclusive and that \"Islamic feminism, which [takes] its understanding and mandate from the Qur'an, seeks rights and justice for women, and for men, in [all] of their existence. Islamic feminism is both highly contested and firmly embraced.\"\nNineteenth and twentieth century.\nModern ideas of Islamic feminism started in the 19th century.. The Iranian poet T\u00e1hirih was the first modern woman to undertake Qur'anic exegesis. She was born and raised in a traditional Muslim family. Later, she became a prominent member of the B\u00e1b\u00ed Faith. During this time was openly against polygyny, the wearing of the veil, and other restrictions put on women. One of her most notable quotes are her final words before her execution in August 1852, \"You can kill me as soon as you like, but you cannot stop the emancipation of women.\"\nEgyptian jurist Qasim Amin wrote the book \"Women's Liberation\" (\"Tahrir al-Mar'a\"), in 1899. This book probably started the feminist movement in Egypt. In his work, Amin criticized some of the practices which were common in his society at the time: These were polygyny, the veil, and \"purdah\", i.e. sex segregation in Islam, amongst others. He condemned them as un-Islamic and contradictory to the true spirit of Islam. His work had an enormous influence on women's political movements throughout the Islamic and Arab world\nAmin had a big effect on modern-day Islamic feminist movements. Despite this, present-day scholar Leila Ahmed considers his works both androcentric and colonialist. Muhammad 'Abdu, an Egyptian nationalist and proponent of Islamic modernism, could easily have written the chapters of his work that show honest considerations of the negative effects of the veil on women. Amin also uses many male misconceptions about women: In his view, women are unable to experience love. Women also talk about their husbands when they are not present. He also thinks that Muslim marriage is based on ignorance and sensuality, of which women were the main source. \nAmin was not the first to criticize the society he lived in. There were many women who did. The women's press in Egypt started voicing such concerns since its very first issues in 1892. Egyptian, Turkish, Iranian, Syrian and Lebanese women and men had been reading European feminist magazines even a decade earlier, and discussed their relevance to the Middle East in the general press.\nTwentieth century\nAisha Abd al-Rahman, used her pen name \"Bint al-Shati\" (\"Daughter of the Riverbank\"), when she wrote. She was the second modern woman to do Quranic exegesis. She didn't think of herself as a feminist. Despite this, her works have feminist themes. She began producing her popular books in 1959, the same year that Naguib Mahfouz published his allegorical and feminist version of the life of Muhammad. She wrote biographies of early women in Islam, including the mother, wives and daughters of the Prophet Muhammad, as well as literary criticism. Fatema Mernissi has argued that much of the suppression of women's rights in Islamic societies is the result of political motivation and its consequent manipulative interpretation of hadith, which is against the egalitarian Islamic community of men and women Muhammad had in mind.\nSome versions of modern Islamic feminism do not use hadith at all, and only focus on the priciples written down in the Qu'ran. Riffat Hassan has advocated one such movement. She started a theology where what are seen as universal rights for humanity outlined in the Qur'an are prioritized over contextual laws and regulations. In addition, she claims, that if only the Qu'ran is taken as scripture, there is no story that women were created after men, or a story that they started the \"Fall of Man\". Other Muslim feminists have criticized this idea: They say it is too picky and ignores other elements of the Muslim tradition that could be helpful in making Islamic society more egalitarian.\nRevolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan.\nThe Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan (RAWA) is a women's organization based in Quetta, Pakistan.\nIt promotes women's rights and secular democracy. The organization wants to involve women of Afghanistan in both political and social activities. In this way, they should get their human rights. RAWA will also continuing the struggle against the government of Afghanistan. RAWA thinks the Afghan government should be based on democratic and secular ideas - not fundamentalist - principles, in which women can participate fully.\nA group of intellectuals led by Meena founded the group in 1977. At the time, Meena did not use a last name. They founded the organization to promote equality and education for women. Even if Meena was assassinated because of her views, RAWA continues to \"give voice to the deprived and silenced women of Afghanistan\". Before 1978, RAWA focused mainly on women's rights and democracy, but after the coup of 1978, directed by Moscow, and the 1979 Soviet Occupation of Afghanistan, \"Rawa became directly involved in the war of resistance, advocating democracy and secularism from the outset\". In 1979 RAWA campaigned against the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan, and organized meetings in schools to mobilize support against it, and in 1981, launched a bilingual feminist magazine, \"Payam-e-Zan\" (Women's Message). RAWA also founded Watan Schools to aid refugee children and their mothers, offering both hospitalization and the teaching of practical skills.\nTwenty-first century.\nIn 2015 a group of Muslim activists, politicians, and writers issued a Declaration of Reform. This declaration also supports women's rights and states in part, \"We support equal rights for women, including equal rights to inheritance, witness, work, mobility, personal law, education, and employment. Men and women have equal rights in mosques, boards, leadership and all spheres of society. We reject sexism and misogyny.\" The Declaration also announced the founding of the Muslim Reform Movement organization to work against the beliefs of Middle Eastern terror groups. In 2015 Asra Nomani and others placed the Declaration on the door of the Islamic Center of Washington.\nFeminism in the Middle East is over a century old. The war on terror in Afghanistan directly affected it. It continues to grow and fight for women's rights and equality in all conversations of power and everyday life. There is currently a debate about what the status of women in Islam should be like. Both conservative and Islamic femininists use the same sources for their arguments: The Quran, the hadith, and prominent women in Muslim history. Feminists say that early Islam was more egalitarian; conservatives say that the gender assymmetries are \"divinely ordained\"."}

In nature, most systems are non-linear. \nNonlinear problems are interesting to engineers, biologists, physicists, mathematicians, and many other scientists. In nature, most systems are nonlinear. Nonlinear dynamical systems, describe changes in variables over time. Such systems may appear chaotic, unpredictable, or counterintuitive. Linear systems are much simpler.\nA nonlinear system of equations is used to mathematically describe a nonlinear system. This is set of equations in which the unknowns (or the unknown functions in the case of differential equations) appear as variables of a polynomial of degree higher than one or in the argument of a function which is not a polynomial of degree one. In other words, in a nonlinear system of equations, the equation(s) to be solved cannot be written as a linear combination of the unknown variables or functions that appear in them. Systems can be defined as nonlinear, regardless of whether known linear functions appear in the equations. In particular, a differential equation is \"linear\" if it is linear in terms of the unknown function and its derivatives, even if nonlinear in terms of the other variables appearing in it.\nNonlinear dynamical equations are difficult to solve. For this reasln, they are commonly approximated using linear equations. If only limited accuracy or a range of the input values is required, this works well. The problem is that it hides interesting phenomena such as solitons, chaos, and singularities. \nAlthough such chaotic behavior may appear random, it is in fact not random. For example, some aspects of the weather are seen to be chaotic, where simple changes in one part of the system produce complex effects throughout. This nonlinearity is one of the reasons why accurate long-term forecasts are impossible with current technology.\nSome authors use the term nonlinear science for the study of nonlinear systems. This term is disputed by others:"}

The other was to bottle it. In bottles, sugar is used for sweet fruits, but vinegar (acetic acid) is used for savoury items. As the world was not so warm in past centuries, it was possible for houses in the colder zones to keep an ice pit for much of the year. That way iced dishes could be provided. So fruit preserves are something of our past which survives to the present."}

There is controversy over where the southern region of the state officially begins. Lots of people say Southern Illinois starts from Springfield and southward. A number of others Carbondale north to Springfield don't lay claim to that region of Illinois as being that of Southern Illinois, though. Illinois is in the Midwestern United States. But Southern Illinois has been called far more typical for the Upland South, similar to nearby Kentucky, Missouri and Tennessee, rather than the Midwest. Locals (Illinois' people) from certain small towns have been part of a movement to completely expel/remove Chicago from the state so a commonwealth can be set up with similar politics to Missouri, Kentucky and Indiana. These small Illinois towns include Athens, Mount Vernon, Urbana and Effingham. The movement is called New Illinois. Under the movement, Southern and Downstate Illinois would be entirely separated from Chicago. The large city would become the 51st state in the United States.\nThere are lots of cities or towns with a large number of people in Southern Illinois. These include, dependent on references and views of the population of the area and those outside: Springfield, Alton, O'Fallon, Collinsville, Carbondale, Cairo and Mount Vernon. The region also involves St. Louis and Cape Girardeau (both in Missouri), Memphis and Nashville (both in Tennessee), and Evansville, Indiana.\nSouthern Illinois was covered by the Shawnee National Forest. The area also contains hilly landscape.\nThe Southern Illinois area has almost 1.2 million people. Most of them live near/in rural settings that are in farm areas. Others, however, live in/near Carbondale\u2013Marion, the Illinois region of the St. Louis metro area, in the Urbana\u2013Champaign region and in/near the Springfield area.\nMetro East.\nThe area of Southern Illinois with the most of all people is the Illinois side of Greater St. Louis. Noted areas are Cahokia Mounds, the American Bottom and East St. Louis. The last mentioned area has had a very rough history involving industrialization, labor, immigration and the struggle for equal rights.\nCounties\nPrincipal cities\nCity populations\nEast-Central Southern Illinois.\nLocated on the Wabash River, East-Central Southern Illinois is noted by the town of Salem, the birthplace of William Jennings Bryan, the G. I. Bill of Rights and Miracle Whip salad dressing.\nCounties\nPrincipal cities\nCity populations\nWest-Central Southern Illinois.\nChester, Illinois, over West-Central and Southern Illinois is usually called the \"Home of Popeye\". Several of the influences for the characters were seen there. Kaskaskia, the first state capital of Illinois is set located near the Mississippi River. This area also has the ending point of the Kaskaskia River near the Fort Kaskaskia State Historic Site. Rend Lake is in this area.\nCounties\nPrincipal cities\nCity populations\nSouthwest Illinois.\nSet in the western area of the Cache River, Southwest Illinois has the second most people across the region. This area's best-known higher education setting is the main campus of the Southern Illinois University in Carbondale. The university won the 1971 All-America City Award. It was later a finalist in the 2009 contest, and the fastest growing city in Southern Illinois outside the Metro East, Marion, Illinois. Both cities are in the Carbondale-Marion-Herrin, Illinois Combined Statistical Area, home to 123,272 local people. In the southern area of the region Alto Pass and Bald Knob Cross are right near the orchards. The large Crab Orchard lake is the largest in the region. Historic Cairo sits at the far southern end near the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers.\nCounties\nPrincipal cities\nCity populations\nClimate.\nSouthern Illinois happens being on the border between humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification \"Dfa\") and humid subtropical climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification \"Cfa\"). The area doesn't have any large mountains or large bodies of water to moderate its temperature. That means Southern Illinois areas are prone to both cold Arctic air and hot, humid tropical air from the Gulf of Mexico. Along with the rest of the Midwestern United States, such areas are home to some of the largest temperature extremes in the world. The Southern Illinois area has four distinct seasons. Spring is the wettest season. It has uneven severe weather. This involves severe thunderstorms, tornadoes or winter storms. Summers are hot and humid. This season only has occasional and brief rest. Humidity often makes the heat index rise to temperatures feeling well above . Fall is mild with lower humidity. It can, however, make irregular bouts of heavy rainfall with the first snow flurries. This usually happens during late November. Winters are cold with periodic snow. During this season, temperatures often below freezing. Thaws are usually frequent. Winter storm systems, in particular the Alberta clippers and Panhandle hooks, often bring days of heavy freezing rain, ice pellets and snowfall.\nThe normal high temperature in July is 90\u00a0\u00b0F (32\u00a0\u00b0C). The normal low temperature in January is 21\u00a0\u00b0F (\u22126\u00a0\u00b0C). This, though, varies between one year and another. Both and temperatures can be seen on an average 2 or 3 days per year. The official record low is on February 2, 1884 in Harrisburg. The region's record high is on July 14, 1954 in East St. Louis.\nSouthern Illinois has thunderstorms about 50 days a year on average. Thunderstorms add to just over half of the area's overall precipitation. Mainly in the spring, these storms will often be severe, with high winds, large hail and tornadoes. Southern Illinois has been affected on more than one occasion by Southern Illinois tornado history|very damaging tornadoes.\nA period of warm weather late in autumn known as the Indian summer will sometimes occur. Roses may still bloom as late as November or early December during some years.\nPolitics of Southern Illinois.\nSouthern Illinois was historically a conservative and Democratic region. Though the political parties have changed, Southern Illinois has almost always voted for Democratic candidates more times than not since 1818. Democratic roots in Southern Illinois relate to the area's shared cultures with the South. The latter United States area was where the Democratic Party, before the American Civil War and after Reconstruction, was the ruling party before the 1960s. Democratic affiliations were tightened in the Great Depression and Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration. There are, however, some long-time Republican counties in the region. The most well-known is Edwards County.\nBut in the last few decades, Southern Illinois has trended GOP due to the national support for them across rural areas. Northern Illinois has trended towards Democrats due to lots of that area's people leaving from in and near the Democratic-leaning Cook County and nearby counties. Democratic candidates were fierce in the counties across Southern Illinois until around 1996. Beginning from the presidential election of 2000 on, Democratic officials weren't doing well like expected across Southern Illinois even if they had won almost very constantly.\nIn the early months of the Civil War, several local people in Williamson County voted for secession from the Union. On April 15, 1861, the citizens of Marion made a promise calling for the division of Illinois and the secession of Southern Illinois. The promise was soon rescinded meaning canceled). The General Benjamin Prentiss, however, left a company of men near Marion for defense as he passed by on his way to a garrison in Cairo. Despite some southern sympathizers, most young men in the region joined the Union Army."}

Both of his parents lived to age 91 and his youngest son, Fred Hale Sr, to age 97. He married Flora Mooers, who died in 1979, in 1910, and had two daughters, Muriel (1910\u20131970) and Carrie (1913\u20131992) and three sons, Robert (1916\u20131918) who died in the Spanish flu, Norman (born 1920) and Fred (born 1921). At the time of his death, Hale also had nine grandchildren, nine great-grandchildren and eleven great-great-grandchildren.\nAt age 95, Hale surfed for the first time in his life in Hawaii during a stop there on the journey back from Japan where he visited his grandson. At age 100, he traveled to Europe along with his son Norman and his daughter-in-law, to visit Norman's location of military service during World War II. At age 108, Hale was recognized by Guinness World Records as the oldest person ever with a driving license, and he believed \"bee pollen and honey every day, along with the occasional nip of whiskey\" as the secret to a long life.

Tucker adds that accusations of bias could equally be leveled at other akhb\u0101r\u012bs contemporary to Sayf, including the Shi'a historian Abu Mikhnaf. Fuat Sezgin, Albrecht Noth, and Martin Hinds have also challenged Wellhausen's views and placed Sayf on an equal footing with other traditionalists. Linda D. Lau and A. R. Armush also regard Sayf ibn Umar as reliable and accept his accounts and the role of the Saba'iyya at the Battle of the Camel."}

People aren't sure who the Nephilim were.\nThe Biblical book Numbers 13:33 says that they later lived in Canaan at the time that Israel conquered Canaan.\nA similar Hebrew term, read as \"Nephilim\" by some scholars, or as the word \"fallen\" by others, appears in the Biblical book Ezekiel 32:27.\nWhat are Nephilim.\nSome people think Nephilim are Giants, others Fallen Angels, others to be the result of angels mating with humans, and some that they descended from the Biblical figures of Seth and Cain.\nBrown-Driver-Briggs thought that nephilim are \"giants\". Robert Baker Girdlestone thought that they are 'those that cause others to fall down'. Ronald Hendel thinks that it means 'ones who have fallen'.\nThe majority of ancient biblical translations think they were \"giants\". Symmachus thought they were \"the violent ones\" and Aquila thought they were either \"the fallen ones\" or \"the ones falling [upon their enemies]\".\nSome Jews believe that the Nephilim had children called Elioud. Aramaics think that Nephilim refer to the children of Orion. J. C. Greenfield thinks that the Nephilim is based on bad things in Sumerian beliefs. Early Arabs thought that fallen angels were sent to Earth looking like men, and they mated with humans.\nMentions of Nephilim in the Hebrew Bible.\nIn Genesis\u00a06:4:The Nephilim were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bore children to them; the same were the mighty men that were of old, the men of renown.\nIn Numbers 13:32\u201333,:And there we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who come of the Nephilim; and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.\nIn Ezekiel 32:27: They lie with the warriors, the Nephilim of old, who descended to Sheol with their weapons of war. They placed their swords beneath their heads and their shields upon their bones, for the terror of the warriors was upon the land of the living.\nIdea about nephilim fossils.\nCotton Mather thought that fossilized leg bones and teeth discovered near Albany, New York, in 1705, were the remains of Nephilim who died in a great flood, though paleontologists thought they were mastodon remains instead."}

It lives in the Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, other parts of Polynesia, and two subspecies have been found high in the hills in New Guinea. Scientists do not know much about them because they hide so well.\nAppearance.\nThe spotless crake is about half the size of a blackbird. It is about 20 cm long. It weighs about 45 g. It has blue-gray and black feathers. It has orange-pink legs. It has a black beak.\nHabitat and food.\nSpotless crakes live in wetlands that have fresh water, not salt water. They look for food where the plants grow close together. Sometimes they will walk out on bare mud, but they run back into the plants if they think they are in danger.\nThe spotless crake eats the seeds of many plants, but it also eats animals without bones, for example beetles and worms. This bird is crepuscular, which means it looks for food at dawn and dusk.\nBreeding.\nSpotless crakes form one-on-one pairs to lay eggs. They build nests out of pieces of grass woven together. The nest is 30-50 cm above the water. Sometimes they build platforms near the nest. The female lays 2-5 eggs at a time. Both the male and female crake sit on the eggs. The eggs take 20-22 days to hatch. The chicks stay in the nest for about 4 days. They can catch some of their own food at that age. Both parents care for the chicks for 4-5 months.\nThreats.\nHuman beings change their wetlands into farms. Introduced species brought by humans can also kill the crake."}

This kingdom existed from the 1st to the 7th century CE.\nGeneral.\nMost texts written about this subject was written by foreign travelers. As a result, information about this ancient kingdom is often disputed.\nEtymology.\nGeorge C\u0153d\u00e8s thinks that the word \"Funan\" came from the word \"Bna\u1e43\" or \"Vna\u1e43\" in old Khmer. The modern Khmer word \"Phnom\" (meaning mountain or hill) came from this word. Claude Jacques, however, disputes this theory. He pointed out that there is a wrong translation of the Sanskrit word \"Parvatab\u00f9p\u00e1la\" as \"Bna\u1e43.\" There is no ancient Khmer text found using this word to refer to this kingdom.\nThere are other explanations on how the word was formed. Claude Jacques believes the Chinese created this name because they likes to add \"\" (\"nan\") to refer to regions \"to the south\" (Yunnan, Hainan, ...).\nCapital.\nThe exact location of the capital is not known. The Book of Liang said the capital is 500 li (250 kilometers) from the sea, so it might be in Ba Phnom (Cambodian province of Prey Veng), Angkor Borei (in the Cambodian province of Takeo) or \u00d3c Eo (now in Vietnam).\nGeorge C\u0153d\u00e8s believes the name of the capital is \"Vyadhapura\" (city of hunters) because Angkorian texts described about it. The Book of Tang also recorded the word \"T\u00e9m\u00fa\" (old Khmer \"Dalm\u0101k)\" which also means \"hunter\". But Michael Vickery disputes this claim because of two reasons. First, the two words have different meaning. The \"Vyadhapura\" killed the animal, but the \"Dalm\u0101k\" brought the animal home alive. Second, the word \"Dalm\u0101k\" appeared for the first time in the ninth or early tenth century, and the word \"T\u00e9m\u00fa\" appeared in Chinese texts for the first time in the sixth century (Funan: 1st\u20147th century)."}

He allegedly attempted a coup d'\u00e9tat against Malagasy President Marc Ravalomanana on November 18, 2006.\nCoup attempt.\nPrior to his alleged coup attempt, in October 2006 General Andrianafidisoa had been barred from running for president in the election scheduled for December 3, 2006, for not paying the required deposit of 25,000,000 ariary. Andrianafidisoa had earlier supported Ravalomanana in his struggle against Didier Ratsiraka over election results in 2002, and led an attack by pro-Ravalomanana forces on Fianarantsoa at that time.\nWhile Ravalomanana was out of the country, Andrianafidisoa had leaflets distributed declaring military rule; he called Ravalomanana's government unconstitutional and went to a base at Ivato Airport, seeking support from soldiers. One soldier was reported killed in a clash there, and Ravalomanana's flight, returning from Europe, was diverted to Mahajanga. Andrianafidisoa's takeover attempt failed, and he went into hiding or on the run; the government ordered his arrest and began searching for him. However, the general stated that \"I am alive and I am not in hiding,\" on a telephone call to news organization Reuters. According to him, \"Soldiers and politicians have got the message.\"\nSubsequently Andrianafidisoa denied that the events had been a coup attempt, describing this as a misinterpretation. He did, however, acknowledge that he had called Ravalomanana's government unconstitutional and that he called for him to resign. On November 22, Andrianafidisoa received the backing of eight of the 14 presidential candidates, who said he was defending the constitution and the interests of the nation.\nA $50,000 reward was offered for Andrianafidisoa's arrest. The secretary of state for public security said that Andrianafidisoa was taken by surprise and captured on December 12 at a hotel, and that he did not resist. Several guns, along with ammunition, were found with him. Police began interrogating Andrianafidisoa on December 14. Andrianafidisoa pleaded not guilty during his trial, and he and his lawyers argued that he had not attempted a coup, but had instead acted as a \"lone soldier\" attempting to alert the president to the situation of the armed forces. He was sentenced to four years in prison on February 2, 2007, and stated his intention to appeal the verdict. On February 20, he received an additional three-year prison sentence.\nRavalomanana was forced out of office by a combination of popular protests and military intervention in March 2009. Opposition leader Andry Rajoelina then took over as President of the High Authority of the Transition and promptly pardoned Andrianafidisoa, along with many other political prisoners, on 26 March 2009.\nDeath.\nAndrianafidisoa died on 6 October 2021."}

Christianity in these countries and communities, dates back to the ancient African (East African-Horn African) Kingdom of Aksum, when King Ezana first converted to the faith and later on became the official religion of his kingdom and the Ethiopian Empire. Eastern Christianity is the main Christian cultural tradition of these countries and communities.\nThere are several different branches of Christianity in the Ethiopian and Eritrean communities, and can be broken down into several denominations. The largest and oldest branch of Christianity in Ethiopia and Eritrea are the Orthodox Tewahedo churches, a group of culturally and theologically related Oriental Orthodox churches. The second largest Christian branch in Ethiopia and Eritrea is P'ent'ay (Ethiopian-Eritrean Evangelicalism), a grouping of several Evangelical Protestant denominations. The third branch of Christianity in the region is the Catholic Church or Catholicism. \nOrthodox Tewahedo.\nOrthodox Tewahedo is the common and historical name of the Oriental Orthodox church in the former Ethiopian Empire, that would later become the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, and the most dominant Christian denominations in its successor states of Ethiopia and Eritrea respectively. It is one of the few pre-colonial Christian churches in Sub-Saharan Africa and one of the oldest Christian churches in the world with Ethiopia (then including Eritrea) being historically the second country, following only Armenia, to have officially proclaimed Christianity as its state religion (in AD 333). The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church (, \"Y\u00e4ityop'ya ortodoks t\u00e4wahedo b\u00e9t\u00e4krestyan\") and the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church (Tigrinya: \u1264\u1270 \u12ad\u122d\u1235\u1275\u12eb\u1295 \u1270\u12cb\u1205\u12f6 \u12a4\u122d\u1275\u122b, \"Tewah\u0259do Bet'\u0259 K'rstian Ertra)\" are in communion with the the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, the Armenian Apostolic Church and the Syriac Orthodox Church. \nThe Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church is the largest of the Oriental Orthodox Christian churches and has a membership of about 36 million people, the majority of whom live in Ethiopia. It is also a founding member of the World Council of Churches.\nFrom the first half of the 4th century until 1959, the Orthodox Tewahedo churches were administratively part of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria \u00a0 it was granted autocephaly with its own patriarch by Saint Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria, Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria. Following the independence of Eritrea from Ethiopia in 1993, the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church was made autocephalous by Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria and it officially separated from what was now to become the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church.\nP'ent'ay - Ethiopian-Eritrean Evangelicalism.\nP'ent'ay (from Ge'ez: \u1334\u1295\u1324) is an Amharic\u2013Tigrinya language term for Eastern tradition-oriented Protestant Christians within Ethiopia and Eritrea, and the Ethiopian and Eritrean diaspora. The term refers to all Evangelical Christian denominations and organizations in Ethiopian and Eritrean societies and can be translated into English as Ethiopian-Eritrean Evangelicalism or the Ethiopian-Eritrean Evangelical Church. Sometimes the denominations and organizations are also known as Wenig\u0113law\u012b (from Ge'ez: \u12c8\u1295\u130c\u120b\u12ca).\nEthiopian and Eritrean Evangelical Christians are the result of American and European Protestant missionary work among youth who left the Orthodox Tewahedo churches because of theological differences, and later fanned by persecution against them. P'ent'ay Christians Schismed from the Orthodox Tewahedo churches, other branches of Christianity, or converted from other religions with the aid of Protestant missionaries to reform Ethiopian Christianity (and by extension Eritrean Christianity) from what they perceived as doctrinal\u2013theological diversions. Since the creation of P'ent'ay churches and organizations, prominent movements among them have been Pentecostalism, the Baptist tradition, Lutheranism, Methodism, Presbyterianism, and the Mennonites.\nDenominations.\nThe major Protestant denominations in Ethiopia and Eritrea are a group of indigenous, closely linked (part of the or community of churches) Baptist, Lutheran, Pentecostal, and Mennonite denominations.\nPrimary denominations.\nSome P'ent'ay communities\u2014especially the Mekane Yesus Lutheran Church for example\u2014have been influenced by the Orthodox Tewahedo churches, which represents the dominant traditional Ethiopian and Eritrean Christian demographic, but for the most part are very Pentecostal in their worship and theology.\nCatholicism (Catholic Church).\nThe Ethiopian Catholic Church (; ) and the Eritrean Catholic Church (Tigrinya: \u12a4\u122d\u1275\u122b\u12ca\u1275 \u1264\u1270 \u12ad\u122d\u1235\u1272\u12eb\u1295; ) are metropolitan \"sui iuris\" Eastern particular church within the Catholic Church, established in 1930 in Ethiopia and established in 2015 by separation of its territory from that of the Ethiopian Catholic Church and the setting up in that territory of a new \"sui iuris\" metropolitan Eastern Catholic Church, respectively. Like the other Eastern Catholic Churches, the Ethiopian Catholic Church is in full communion with the Holy See. It holds the Christological doctrine of the Council of Chalcedon and accepts the universal jurisdiction of the pope. These points distinguish it from the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, an Oriental Orthodox Church which comprises most Christians in the the Ethiopian and Eritrean Community. The Ethiopian and Eritrean Catholic Churches follow the Alexandrian Rite used by the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, and the Coptic Catholic Church. As its liturgical language it employs Ge'ez, a Semitic language that fell out of daily use several centuries ago."}

Meanwhile (at the same time), the English bought land for settlement from the local tribes. The Dutch had unintentionally killed the Pequots' chief.

On the night of May 26, 1637, the Colonial forces arrived outside the Pequot village near the Mystic River. The palisade surrounding the village had only two exits. Their leader, Colonel John Mason, gave the order to set the village on fire and block off the exits. Those who tried climbing over the palisade were shot.

The village is part of Westerly, Rhode Island. At the 2010 United States Census, Watch Hill had close to 154 people living there. The village is set at the most-southwest point in all of Rhode Island. The village became very important in the 19th and 20th centuries as a major summer resort. It had rich families building sprawling (spread-out) Victorian style cottages near the southwest tips of Rhode Island. Watch Hill was called by \"the New York Times\" as a community \"with a strong sense of privacy and of discreetly used wealth.\"\nHistory.\nThe area was occupied by Niantic Indians in the 17th century, led by Harman Garrett. Colonists used the hill as an important lookout point during the French and Indian War and the Revolutionary War, hence the community's name. Some landmarks in the village include the Watch Hill Lighthouse, the first of which was built in 1745; 1880s The Flying Horse Carousel, the oldest operating suspended-horse carousel in the United States and a National Historic Landmark; the Ocean House hotel; and the 1916 Olympia Tea Room.\nOne point of interest in Watch Hill is the ruins of Fort Mansfield. The ruins are an old coastal artillery post at the very end of Napatree Point. It was one of a series of such forts. They were constructed to guard the eastern entrance to Long Island Sound as part of the coastal defense network for New York City during the Spanish\u2013American War. It was in operation between 1901 and 1909. Then it was closed down over the course of several years. The land was sold in 1926. All the government structures were torn down in winter 1928\u201329. The three concrete gun emplacements were left behind. They remain there as of October 2021. They usually offer tunnels and underground rooms to explore. Occasionally at low tide, some remains can be seen of the Battery Connell.\nFort Road connected Watch Hill to Fort Mansfield. The New England Hurricane of 1938, though, wiped it out. The storm also destroyed 39 houses, the Yacht and Beach Clubs and a bathing pavilion. Fifteen people were killed. Others survived by clinging to wreckage when they were swept across the bay to Connecticut. Several breachways were created in Napatree Point after the hurricane passed. To this day, Sandy Point remains an island, not a northern extension of Napatree. The shortened Napatree Point is now a barrier beach without any roads or houses. It is open to the public. Napatree Point offers bird watching and surf casting.\nGeography.\nWatch Hill is at the most southwest area of Rhode Island. It lies on a stubby peninsula that extends to Block Island Sound. It includes a smaller peninsula known as Napatree Point. Napatree is a -long sandy spit. It extends west from the Watch Hill business district, and Sandy Point. The latter was once attached to Napatree Point. Both Napatree and Sandy Point shelter Little Narragansett Bay. They have made Watch Hill a popular harbor around which the business district has grown.\nWatch Hill is a two-hour drive from Boston. The place is also a three-hour drive from New York City. On clear days, there are views of Montauk, New York to the south and Block Island, Rhode Island to the southeast.\nCulture.\nAccording to \"The New York Times\", Watch Hill was historically home to \"a select group of wealthy families.\" Their lives happened around \"golf and tennis at the Misquamicut Club, bathing and yachting at the Watch Hill Yacht Club, and tea and cocktails at Ocean House and Watch Hill's other grand hotels.\" Rich families built sprawling Victorian-style \"cottages\" along the peninsula. The village was known as \"a somewhat staid and family-oriented community\" compared to glittering Newport. The latter was Rhode Island's other, more famous summer colony. Famous guests to the seaside resort included Albert Einstein, Douglas Fairbanks, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Groucho Marx, David Niven and Jean Harlow.\nFor several generations, the community has maintained its \"old-money summer colony\" atmosphere. This was even as traditional summer communities have developed, namely Nantucket, Martha's Vineyard and the Hamptons. New England traditions are evident in the popular hobbies of its local people. These include golf, sailing, tennis and the \"privacy-loving multigenerational families tucked into century-old shingled houses.\" Many of these are passed down in families for several generations. \"The New York Times\" notes that \"Watch Hill impresses visitors with a strong sense of privacy and of discreetly used wealth\u2014the rambling, old-fashioned, turreted and ginger-breaded Victorian summer houses with piazzas and softly rolling lawns have little in common with the overpowering castles of the very rich in Newport, a place rarely mentioned in Watch Hill even though it is barely 30 miles distant.\"\nThe waterfront was once lined with huge Victorian hotels. However, fire and hurricanes destroyed almost all during the 20th century. The two remaining hotels are the Ocean House and the Watch Hill Inn. Both went through major remodels during the 2000s. The Ocean House was originally opened in 1868. it was torn down in 2005, then completely rebuilt and reopened in 2010. The Ocean House today contains both hotel rooms and condominiums. It is the only Forbes Five-Star and AAA Five Diamond Hotel in Rhode Island It was described by \"The New York Times\" as a place which \"conjures up another age, when women wore white gloves to tea and golf was a newfangled pastime.\" Celebrities have stayed for holidays at this hotel. Those include Hugh Jackman and Regis Philbin.\nThe village is listed as a census-designated place. The Watch Hill Historic District is a historic district in the village. It is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. It is a state-charted Fire District (1901). This means the Watch Hill area is authorized to tax residents to fund their volunteer fire department. The bulk of property taxes, however, go to the town to fund municipal services and schools.\nWell-known people.\nWell-known present and former local people of Watch Hill include: "}

New Shoreham is in Washington County, Rhode Island. It extends over exactly the same area as Block Island. The town was settled in 1637. It was later incorporated in 1672. It was named for Shoreham, Kent in England. At the 2000 United States Census, there were 1,010 people living in New Shoreham. The place is the most southern in Rhode Island and the state's Washington County.\nHistory.\nOn September 21, 1938 a very strong hurricane (either category three or four) brought a storm surge onto Block Island. Two fishermen were killed by strong waves that hit Block Island. Winds, however, caused the most damage. Those winds were 91 miles per hour when the hurricane affected Block Island. Almost sixteen years later, in late August 1954, Hurricane Carol moved across eastern New England. Although not anywhere as deadly as the 1938 violent storm, Carol caused more damage. That tropical cyclones' name was permanently retired due to damage when it ran through New England. On August 19, 1991, Hurricane Bob crossed eastern New England. Bob's path was mostly similar to Carol's. The storm ran across Block Island before it moved into New England. Though Bob was category 2, it was more damaging than either Carol or the 1938 hurricane. Bob's damage was almost $1.5 billion."}

{"id": "876184", "revid": "22027", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=876184", "title": "Antoine-Fran\u00e7ois de Fourcroy", "text": "Antoine Fran\u00e7ois Fourcroy (31 August 175731 August 1809) was a French chemist and a contemporary of Antoine Lavoisier. Fourcroy collaborated with Lavoisier, Guyton de Morveau, and Claude Berthollet on the \"M\u00e9thode de nomenclature chimique\", a work that helped standardize chemical nomenclature.\nEarly life.\nFourcroy was born in Paris. His father was an apothecary in the household of the Duke of Orl\u00e9ans. On the advice of the anatomist F\u00e9lix Vicq-d'Azyr, he took up medical studies. After many difficulties caused by lack of means he finally obtained his doctor's diploma in 1780. He taught chemistry from (1783\u20131787) at the Veterinary School of Alfort. Fourcroy's attention was turned specifically to chemistry by J. B. M. Bucquet (1746\u20131780), the professor of chemistry at the Medical School of Paris. In 1784 Fourcroy was chosen to succeed P. J. Macquer (1718\u20131784) as lecturer in chemistry at the college of the Jardin du Roi, where his lectures attained great popularity.\nWorks.\nChemical work.\nFourcroy was one of the earliest converts to the views of Lavoisier, which he helped to make widely known by his own voluminous writings. The Royal Society's \"Catalogue of Scientific Papers\" enumerates fifty-nine memoirs by Fourcroy alone, and fifty-eight written with others, mostly Louis Nicolas Vauquelin. Fourcroy's 1785 publication, \"Entomologia Parisiensis, sive, Catalogus insectorum quae in agro Parisiensi reperiuntur ...\", co-written with \u00c9tienne Louis Geoffroy, was a major contribution to systematic entomology.\nLater with Louis Nicolas Vauquelin, he identified a metal in a platinum residue they called \u2018\"pt\u00e8ne\"\u2019.This name \u2018ptene\u2019 or \u2018pt\u00e8ne\u2019 was reported as an early synonym for osmium.\nBiological and neurochemical work.\nFourcroy's views and studies grew from Bucquet. Fourcroy was a critic of earlier use of chemistry in medicine and saw great importance in studying the chemical materials of plants and animals, particularly for medical use. The majority of this work was done alongside Vauquelin, who became Fourcroy's assistant in 1784. During this period of work with Vauquelin, Fourcroy founded his own journal: \"La M\u00e9decine \u00e9clair\u00e9e par les sciences physiques, ou Journal des d\u00e9couvertes relatives aux differentes parties de l'art de gu\u00e9rir,\" which detailed his investigations of chemistry and body materials. Fourcroy was convinced that \"the successes of chemistry would one day change the face of medicine and result in beneficial revolution.\"\nAlthough Fourcroy's name appears on a large number of chemical and also physiological and pathological memoirs, he was as much a teacher and an organizer as an original investigator. Beginning in 1791, Fourcroy would go on to publish three memoirs compounding his series of biological experiments, most of which had to do with the chemistry of the human brain. In his first, Fourcroy described the conditions of the brains of the cadavers that he studied. In his second, he would recount his continuing chemical experimentation on the fatty matter in the brain, now known as lipids, as well as the inorganic components present. By using newer methods than the alchemical tradition that had proceeded him, such as extraction and qualitative analysis, Fourcroy concluded that the brain was composed of fatty acids in combination with bases along with recording some physical properties of the substance. His third memoir was a continuation of the separations and extractions he performed on brain matter and addition to his growing compendium of the brain's chemical constituents. One of the most fruitful results of this work was the rediscovery of phosphorus in the brain, reintroducing the 1719 discovery by Johann Thomas Hensing.\nFourcroy also had a prominent role in developing law that would affect medical education in France. Fourcroy collaborated with physician Francois Chaussier to create a report that would be the basis of the Law of 1794, which integrated medicine and surgery and established health schools that taught both of these fields to all students. Prior to this law, medical education was heterogeneous throughout France, with several different colleges and universities operating under varying standards. The law pushed by Fourcroy unified the French medical education system under centralized authority, and led to the issuing of national licensing years later.\nWork in laboratory and medical clinic procedure.\nWhile observing the 18th century clinics of Fourcroy\u2019s time, he observed several problems. Fourcroy noticed that physicians got accustomed to seeing the diseases of an individual patient but failed in considering a large number of cases comparatively. There was also practical problems with this idea, as physician\u2019s individual practices were insufficient in accommodating for large numbers of people with large varieties of issues. To deal with this Fourcroy proposed a program in 1791 to establish more effective clinical laboratories. Along with proposing these hospitals, and the idea that they should be staffed by young physicians well versed in modern sciences, Fourcroy wanted to include material obtained in post-mortem examinations in analysis of humans and how they are affected by disease. This idea was important in linking clinical observations to post-mortem findings, allowing development of new medicine. Although many reform proposals of the time were ignored, Fourcroy had a degree of success because of his political positions. Ultimately, Fourcroy was able to set up a teaching laboratory at the Ecole de Sante in Paris, beginning the development of modern clinical laboratories.\nSocial contributions.\nOutside the scope of his varied scientific work, Fourcroy was involved in the events taking place during the French Revolution, beginning his participation in 1793, where he strived to make positive impacts to French education. By the end of that year, after holding several positions in the National Convention, he was elected as the president of the Jacobin party, taking a seat on the Committee of Public Safety in the process, which he held for about ten months. He would subsequently hold other high ranking positions and directorships in educational institutes and museums during the revolutionary regime and Napoleon's government as well. As an important counselor to Bonaparte, Fourcroy was appointed Minister of Public Instruction in 1802, responsible for education in France at all levels, which he held until his death in December 1809.\nLegacy.\n\"The Chemical Revolution\".\nFourcroy was not the first to publish the phrase \"Chemical revolution,\" even Bucquet described new developments in pneumatic chemistry in 1778 as a \"great revolution in chemistry.\" However, it was Fourcroy that began to better describe the term by lengthening the time scale and broadening the map of nations that were contributing to the Chemical revolution in his written works. It was Fourcroy who had initially noted the division that chemistry had undergone from natural history, concluding that the two studies no longer shared objectives nor methods. While natural historians of his era merely described and preserved that which they studied, as Fourcroy believed, it was chemists who now sought to uncover the most fundamental structures of the natural world by experimental analysis. In his publications, Fourcroy referred to many other contemporary chemists as well as those from other nations, proposing that the extensive chemical reform being done was a collaborative effort.\nAwards and honors.\nIn 1801, Fourcroy was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.\nOn December 16, 1809, the very day on which he died in Paris, Fourcroy was created a count of the French empire. He is buried in the P\u00e8re-Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.\nAntoine-Fran\u00e7ois de Fourcroy's 1787 publication entitled \"M\u00e9thode de Nomenclature Chimique\", published with colleagues Antoine Lavoisier, Claude Louis Berthollet, and Louis Bernard Guyton de Morveau, was honored by a Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award from the Division of History of Chemistry of the American Chemical Society, presented at the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences (Paris) in 2015.\nIt is believed that Cape Fourcroy, at the western tip of Bathurst Island, Northern Territory, Australia, is named after Fourcroy. The cape was named during Baudin's expedition to Australia, and it is known that Baudin had a copy of one of Fourcroy's texts with him on the \"G\u00e9ographe\".\nControversy.\nBy his conduct as a member of the Convention, Fourcroy has been accused of contributing to Lavoisier's death. Baron Cuvier, in his \"Eloge historique\" of Fourcroy, repelled such charges. According to the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" Eleventh Edition: although active, though secret, participation cannot be proved against Fourcroy, \"he can scarcely be acquitted of time-serving indifference.\" See the works in the Bibliography below for other opinions.\nModern references.\nIn 2014, PBS released a three episode documentary series about the search for the basic chemical elements, highlighting seven historical scientists in particular. In episode one of \"The Mystery of Matter: Search for the Elements\", \"Out of Thin Air,\" Fourcroy's character is played by Yan Tual as he assists Lavoisier in his discovery of oxygen."}

His followers were known as Sabayya.\nGhulat career.\nAbdullah ibn Saba is considered the first ghulat (extremist). He was the first one to declare faith in the Imamate of Ali. After Ali\u2019s death, he is said to maintain this idea that \"a devil in \u02bfAli\u2019s appearance had been murdered\" and \u02bfAli had ascended to heaven and that his occultation (raj\u02bfa) was imminent. Saba probably invented the concept of ghayba and return.\nHeinz Halm records him as a representative of a Ghulat group from the city of Seleucia-Ctesiphon (\"al-Mad\u0101'in\") who came to see \u2018Al\u012b in K\u016bfah. When Saba proclaimed divinity, then \u2018Al\u012b denied this angrily and exiled him back to Seleucia-Ctesiphon.\nRoles in Uthman\u2019s assassination.\nTabari and Sayf ibn Umar record Abdullah ibn Saba from playing any major role in the political events that led to Uthman's killing. He and his followers are said to be the ones who enticed the Egyptians against Uthman on the ground of Ali's special right of succession, and participated in further instigation at later conflicts.\nLegacy.\nFor his roles in Uthman's assassination, few Shia Muslims honor Saba and his 'martrydom'. There is a favorable Shia quote that formed around the figure of Abdullah ibn Saba. The story of Saba has also been used by Shia factions to both attack and defend extreme Shia groups. In an non-authentic Shia source, Abdullah ibn Saba was cursed by Ja'far al-Sadiq.\nCriticism.\nJews view Saba negatively and historical Jewish sources regarded him as an apostate from Judaism. Sunni Muslims view Saba as a ghulat seeking to corrupt the message of Islam from by introducing proto-Shia beliefs. Since Saba used to hate Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthman, Sunni Muslims view him negatively and curse him. Sa'd ibn Abdullah al-Ash'ari al-Qummi reported in al-Maqaalaat wal-Firaq p.\u00a020:"}

{"id": "876757", "revid": "508885", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=876757", "title": "Bacon's rebellion", "text": "Bacon's Rebellion was an armed uprising in British Colonial Virginia in 1676. It is named after Nathanial Bacon, a man who moved from England to Virginia. He fought against his cousin, William Berkeley, who was governor of Virginia at the time. Bacon wanted to fight against all the Native Americans in Virginia and make them leave. Berkeley only wanted to attack Native Americans who attacked white settlers first.\nHistory.\nThe white people living in Virginia had problems in the 1670s. They grew tobacco to sell, but the prices had gone down. Also, manufactured goods from England cost more and because of mercantilism, the colonists were not allowed to make their own things. This made them want someone to blame. Many of them blamed American Indians who also lived in Virginia.\nFirst, the Doeg Indians attacked a plantation belonging to Thomas Matthews. Matthews owed them money and had not paid. The colonists attacked the Indians back. But they attacked the wrong group. They attacked Susquehanaug Indians, not Doeg Indians. Then many groups of American Indians began to attack the colonists.\nWilliam Berkeley tried to make peace. He invited Indian chiefs to a meeting, but they were murdered. Colonists kept attacking Native Americans no matter what Berkeley said. Then Berkeley started a meeting called the Long Assembly. He took gunpowder away from peaceful Native Americans and promised the colonists he would send the army to attack Native Americans who were not peaceful (according to him). However, he raised taxes to pay the army. The colonists did not like this. At the Long Assembly, Berkeley also made rules for trading with Native Americans so no one could give them guns or other war supplies. But he gave favors to his friends. The colonists did not like this either.\nBacon and his friends kept attacking different groups of American Indians. Berkeley came with \"well-armed gentlemen\" to find Bacon. Bacon and 200 men ran away into the woods. Berkeley declared Bacon a rebel. Bacon kept attacking American Indians.\nBerkeley offered to pardon Bacon if he would stop, turn himself in, and go to England for trial. But the Virginia government, the House of Burgesses, said Bacon had to come and beg forgiveness. Other Virginians liked Bacon's actions so much that they voted for him to be in the House of Burgesses.\nWhen Bacon showed up to the June Assembly, Berkeley caught him. But instead of putting him in prison, he pardoned him. Bacon took his seat in the Assembly.\nAt the Assembly, Bacon got into a fight about what to do about Native Americans. He walked out and came back with armed men. Bacon told Berkeley to name him General and let him keep fighting American Indians. Berkeley said no and told Bacon to shoot him instead. But eventually, Berkeley changed his mind and told Bacon to keep fighting Indians. After that, Bacon had more control over Jamestown than Berkeley did. Berkeley even left the town for a while.\nBacon and Berkeley fought with armies over who would control Jamestown. They both tried to get white indentured servants and black slaves to join their side. More of these servants and slaves wanted to join Bacon because they knew that they could get more land if there were no American Indians living nearby. At one point, Bacon's fighters set Jamestown on fire. They kept fighting until Bacon died of disease in October 1676.\nBerkeley retook Jamestown and hanged 23 people who had helped Bacon. He also took property away Bacon's supporters without a trial. King Charles II told Berkeley he could not be governor of Virginia any more. Berkeley went back to England and died there in 1677.\nHistorians' view.\nSome people say Bacon was one of the people who pushed for reform at the Assembly of June 1676, but he wasn't. The Assembly did decide to let freed slaves vote and other good things, but those laws had already been started before Bacon's rebellion.\nBefore and during the 20th century, historians thought of Bacon's Rebellion as the first time Americans fought against unjust government. They said it was like the American Revolutionary War, but sooner. The Revolution started exactly one hundred years later in 1776.\n21st century historians disagreed. They said it was about two selfish leaders instead: Berkeley and Bacon.\nHistorians note that white and black people fought together on the same side, both poor free whites, poor free blacks, indentured white servants and enslaved blacks."}

It is on the south of the National Highway No. 53 in the west of Imphal city. The stone engaged in this inscription is the sandstone. The inscription consists of 14 lines of writings in Meitei language (Manipuri language) in archaic Meetei script.\nNotably, the writings from the fifth to the seventh lines were highly damaged and distorted. So, proper study on these particular lines has been very hard and unsuccessful.\nIt does not mention any particular date. But paleographic study confirmed that it was written in two different times. The first 7 lines of writings have been assigned to the time of King (1592 AD-1652 AD). The remaining 7 lines of writings are assigned to the time of King (1697 AD-1709 AD).\nThe inscription shows that King Khagemba assigned compulsory state duty for the Konthoujam clan to worship goddess Huimu Leima. Notably, the Loyumba Shinyen Constitution also assigned the Konthoujam clan to look after the worship of Goddess Huimu Leima, and not Konthousu (Tampha Lairembi). And according to the Konthoujam Nongarol (), Goddess Huimu Leima is the mother of goddess Konthoujam Tampha Lairembi (Chingphulon Konthousu), the one who got married to Salailen (Soraren), the king of heaven."}

The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said that, in January 2021 alone, 297 fires happened across 1,171 acres (4.74 km2) of non-federal land. This is almost three times the number of fires than the five-year average. It is more than 20 times the area of \u200b\u200bthe five-year average. The January fires were worse because of strong Santa Ana winds. Some of the fires burned in the same areas as previous fires.\nThe long-term trend is that wildfires in the state are on the increase due to climate change. There were more fires in 2021 than in 2020 season, which in itself was the largest season in the state's recorded history. As of July 11, more than three times as many acres were burned than in 2020. Experts said drought, extreme heat, and less snow in the winter made the fires burn worse. The state also faces an increased risk of landslides after wildfires because the plants that hold the earth in place have burned and died.."}

It marks the assassination of Umar ibn al-Khattab by Piruz Nahavandi.\nThe day is primarily observed by Sunni Muslims. They perform the ritual of Azadari for Umar. In Pakistan, the day has been an official holiday.\nEtymology.\nThe word Arabic word Shahadat () literally means 'martrydom'. It is derived from Shaheed () which denotes a martyr in Islam. The word \"Shaheed\" occurs frequently in the Quran in the generic sense 'witness', but only once in the sense 'martyr'; this latter sense acquires wider use in the hadiths. In Arabic, Shaheed can mean both a 'witness' and a 'martyr'.\nBackground.\nOne 26 Dhu al-Hijjah, when Umar ibn al-Khattab was praying in the Al-Masjid an-Nabawi, Abu Lulu stabbed him with a double-bladed dagger. Umar died of these wounds on Sunday 1st Muharram of the Islamic year 24.\nObservances.\nShahadat has been an official holiday in Pakistan. Azadari is performed by Sunni Muslims in the country. Rallies are held in various cities including Lahore. In 2011, Tanzeem Ahl-e-Sunnat Wal Jamaat addressed gatherings in Gilgit and demanded of the government to make arrangements for observing the martyrdom day of Umar at government level. He also demanded that a official holiday should be announced on these important days. In 2014, a number of religious scholars and groups in Lahore arranged seminars. The Sipah-e-Sahaba held out a procession from the Data Darbar which was terminated in front of the Lahore Press Club after passing through various streets of the city. In their speeches, Ulema and Mashaikh demanded that 1st Muharram be declared a public holiday. The Sunni Tehreek also took out a procession to mark the day and paid tributes to Umar. In 2020, Shahadat was officially declared a holiday in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan."}

{"id": "877479", "revid": "1057309", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=877479", "title": "Malay land", "text": "The Malay land (known locally as Tanah Melayu) is a word referring to the region where Malay people inhabit. This word initially used by the Javanese people to denotes the Sumatra island (and its surrounding regions) which predominantly ruled by the Malay kingdom, which is a kingdom centered at Jambi in the eastern Sumatra hemisphere. \nEtymology.\nEtymologically, the term \"\"tanah melayu\" is consisting from two Javanese words of \"tanah\" + \"melayu\". The word \"tanah\"\" literally means \"land\", indicating the area of human settlement or the region where human inhabit, while the \"melayu\" itself is a Javanese word which means \"run\", \"runaway\", or \"flee\". This word used to explain the historical origin of Malay people which actually a group of people originating from Java island, but runaway to Sumatra due to a civil war happened between two prince in a Javanese court. The conflict between Malay people and another group also occured in 15th century which resulted some Malay people 'runaway' again from Sumatra to the peninsular area near Sumatra which later known as 'Malay Peninsula' ( 'Kra Peninsula' or 'Malacca Peninsula'). This history is supported by the records in the Malay Annals itself. This recurrent loss of Malay people to defeat the Javanese people however resulting the word \"melayu\" translated as \"wilt\" or \"wilted\" in the Malay language itself, indicating the helplessness of the Malay people.\nHistorical evidences.\nSome of the earliest mentions about the Malay land spesifically can be traced back to 900s CE in the Javanese Anjukladang inscription which mentioned about Malay land that refers to Sumatra island, in the 1200s CE Padang Roco inscription found near the Batanghari river near Jambi also mentioned about the \"\"bhumi melayu\" ( 'Malay land') which referred to Sumatra island as well, this incription is an incription sent by the Javanese king of Singhasari kingdom (a kingdom centered in East Java) to the king of Malay kingdom (a kingdom centered in Jambi). The 'Malay land' also mentioned in the Nagarakretama\u2014an Old Javanese literature\u2014 which mentioned the Sumatra island as the Malay land. On the other hand, the Malay land spesifically has the capital city called as \"Malayapura\" or \"Malayupura\" ( 'Malay city'), this word occured in the 1346 CE incription of Amoghapasa found in the estuary of Batanghari river in West Sumatra. \nIn the older records dating back to 1 BCE to 600s CE, the 'Malay land' were initially called as the 'Malay island'. The historical records that mentioned about the Malay island is written in the Vayu Purana, which is a Sanskrit literature that referred Sumatra island as the \"Malayadvipa\" or \"Malayudvipa\" which means the 'Malay island' in Sanskrit language. \nAccording to the Malay records itself in the Malay annals dating 15th-16th century, 'Malay land' referred to the Sumatra island with the spesific areas of South Sumatra and West Sumatra as the main or notable regions. The Singapore kingdom in Singapore and Malacca Sultanate and Perak Sultanate in Malaysia are few examples of governmental entities that built by some Malay people who runaway from Sumatra island during circa 15th-16th century.\nPolitical usage.\nBrunei.\nEventhough Brunei Darussalam is predominantly Malay, the term 'Malay land' is rarely used in political and daily life.\nIndonesia.\nAs the origin country of the term, 'Malay land' (; ) nowadays still used as the synonym for the Sumatra island, and has the further meaning which refers to Sumatra and its surrounding islands namely Riau islands and Bangka-Belitung islands. 'Malay land' also used for the unity sense of Malay people to denotes the historical importantance of Malay kingdom (centered in Jambi), and Srivijaya empire (centered in Palembang) for Malay people.\nMalaysia.\nThe term 'Malay land' (locally known as \"Tanah Melayu\") used as a political term in 1957 known as \"Persekutuan Tanah Melayu\" by Malay people in the Malay Peninsula to denotes the formation of Malaya Federation which had the mission to become one of the British allies. In 1963, Singapore also join the Federation of Malaya, but due to Malay people habits that always create a conflict with another group entities (in this case, racism against Chinese community), Singapore eventually cancelled their decision and became an independent and sovereign nation in 1965, hence the Malaya Federation renamed themselves as 'Malaysia'. \nNowadays, due to that 1957 Malaya Federation moment, the Malay people in Malay Peninsula ( 'Kra Peninsula' or 'Malacca Peninsula') tend to associate the term Malay land ( 'tanah Melayu') with Malaysia, while in fact this usage isn't correct and can't be used for Malaysia since it's actually a term referred to the Sumatra island (modern-day part of Indonesia). \nThe existence of Malaysia as a country in Southeast Asia has always been a subject of controversial issues since the beginning among Southeast Asian nations that leads into multiple tensions, it's due to Malay people obsession that tried to gain the 'superpower' within Malaysia (also in neighbouring countries). Malaysia ranked as the most racist country in Southeast Asia and second most racist country globally due to continual attempts by Malay people (in Malaysia) to oppress and discriminates non-Malay people. The racist political ideology of \"Ketuanan Melayu\" ( 'the Mastery of Malay') applied in Malaysia as the official constitutional body shows the excessive obsession of Malay people to discriminates and eliminates the rights of non-Malay people community in Malaysia. But to cover the dilapidation within the country, Malaysia tried to deceive the global community by throwing a balderdash branding of 'Malaysia truly Asia'.\nSingapore.\nIn Singapore, the term 'Malay land' is scarcely used as the result of Malaysian racism against Singaporeans back then. But however, Malay language is recognized as one of the official Singapore's languages to respect the historical ties of Singapore with Sumatra island, notably since the kingdom of Singapore is built by the Malay people who originating from Sumatra. Sang Nila Utama\u2014prince of Srivijaya empire\u2014 and Sang Sapurba are among few figures that highly respected and continually mentioned in the history literature of Singapore. Some of Sumatra's people also play an important part in forming the modern nation of Singapore, such as Zubir Said from West Sumatra who composed the national anthem of sovereign Singapore known as \"Majulah Singapura\"\" ( 'Onward Singapore'). The flag of Singapore itself based on Indonesian flag to give a tribute for Indonesia as the origin place of Singapore's Founding Fathers parents, notably Lee Kuan Yew\u2014the first Prime Minister of Singapore\u2014 who are descendant of Chinese-Indonesian ( Chindo) from Semarang (a city in Central Java), and also Yusof Ishak\u2014the first President of Singapore\u2014 who are descendant of Minangkabau and Langkat Malay from Sumatra.

The group's research was published in the May 10, 2007 issue of \"The Astrophysical Journal\".\nAge.\nThe star's age, as measured by ESO's Very Large Telescope, is 13.2 billion years. This makes it among the oldest stars and nearly as old as the estimated age of the universe itself (13.8 billion years as measured by Planck). The measurement uncertainty in the age estimate is 0.7 to 2.7 billion years, depending upon the assumptions made to estimate the uncertainty, although the uncertainty in the relative age of this and other stars using the same method is smaller. HE 1523-0901 is the first star whose age was determined using the decay of the radioactive elements uranium and thorium in tandem with measurements of several neutron capture elements. It is believed to have formed directly from the remnants of the first-generation stars that reached the end of their longevity and exploded as supernovae early in the history of known matter.\nDesignation.\nThe designation \"HE 1523-0901\" indicates that the star is part of the Hamburg/ESO Survey catalog. A list of astronomical catalogues can be used to find which catalog a star or other object is from based on its prefix. Most objects are listed in several catalogs and will often be known by several different designations.\nObservation.\nHE 1523-0901 is approximately 0.8 solar masses.

Paul McCartney was part of the famous band The Beatles. Apple Records released it on 17 April 1970. McCartney recorded it in secret. He mostly usied home-recording equipment at his house in St John's Wood. Professional London studios did some of the mixing and recording. It has loosely arranged performances. McCartney decided to be different from the Beatles' past records: He did not want a polished, precise sound. Instead, he used a lo-fi style. Apart from occasional contributions by his wife, Linda, McCartney performed the entire album alone by overdubbing on four-track tape.\nMcCartney recorded the album when he had depression and felt confused. This was shortly after John Lennon's left the Beatles in September 1969. Conflict over the release of McCartney's album made it harder for McCartney to be friends with his bandmates. He refused to wait to release the album so that the Beatles' album \"Let It Be\" could go first. A press release in the form of a self-interview supplied with UK promotional copies of McCartney led to the Beatles' break-up."}

In the 15 years of their participation in the championship, the team has achieved four victories - the first time in Jordan was won by Damon Hill at the 1998 Belgian Grand Prix (this was the only double victory for the team, with Ralf Schumacher taking second place), and the following season Heinz-Harald Frentzen won twice (1999 Italian Grand Prix and 1999 French Grand Prix). Giancarlo Fisichella took the last of his wins at the 2003 Brazilian Grand Prix. Drivers in Jordan's cars have achieved 19 podium finishes, the first being Rubens Barrichello at the 1994 Pacific Grand Prix and the last being Tiago Monteiro at the 2005 US Grand Prix, although it should be noted that only six drivers competed in this race. Jordan has also won 2 pole positions (Rubens Barrichello in qualifying for the 1994 Belgian Grand Prix and Heinz-Harald Frentzen in qualifying for the 1999 European Grand Prix). The team's best placing in the constructors' standings was 3rd (61 points) in the 1999 season.\nCreation and Beginnings.\nIn 1980, Eddie Jordan founded Eddie Jordan Racing, first in Formula 3 and then in Formula 3000. In the Formula 3000 category, Jean Alesi won the championship in a Jordan-designed car in 1989. After several successful seasons in lower series, Jordan decided to form a team in Formula 1.\nThe debut in the 1991 season turned out to be very successful for the team. Although it was not possible to win the podium, the team scored 13 points and finished 5th in the constructors' standings. Andrea de Cesaris, Bertrand Gachot, Michael Schumacher, Roberto Moreno and Alessandro Zanardi rode for the team in their debut season. The next two seasons were not so successful - in 1992 and 1993 the team was 11th in the constructors' standings. Jordan's drivers managed to score just one point in the 1992 season and 3 points the next. The team returned to its good disposal in the 1994 season, in which it was fifth in the constructors' championship. The drivers scored 28 points for the team, and Rubens Barrichello managed to get pole and bottom of the podium. He also finished fourth five times. The team's second driver, Eddie Irvine, did not do that well, scoring only three times throughout the season. Before the next season, Jordan changed engine supplier from Hart to Peugeot .\nThe team, however, fared slightly worse and fell to the 6th position (21 points). This time PP failed to win, but the 1995 Canadian Grand Prix both drivers finished on the podium - Barrichello in second position, Irvine in third.\nThe team entered the next season with a new sponsor - the tobacco company Benson and Hedges, which sponsored Jordan until 2005 . Eddie Irvine left for Ferrari and was replaced by Martin Brundle, who moved from Ligier . The 1996 season Jordan once again finished 5th - this time with 22 points. The Irish team did not manage to win a place on the podium. In the 1997 season, the team's colors were changed to yellow and black (such colors remained until the end of Jordan's existence). The line-up has also completely changed - Brundle retired and Barrichello moved to Stewart . The new squad was formed by Giancarlo Fisichella and rookie - Ralf Schumacher . The best period in the history of the Irish team was beginning - although the team took 5th place in the constructors' classification (33 points), this time the drivers stood on the podium 3 times - once the younger of the Schumacher brothers, and twice Fisichella. The following season, the engines were changed to Mugen-Honda, and the Italian who left Benetton was replaced by the 1996 world champion, British Damon Hill, who joined the team from the very weak Arrows . He also won Jordan's first victory - in a rainy Belgian Grand Prix, mostly remembered for a huge crash at the start. Hill's partner, Ralf Schumacher, came second in this race. It was the only double win for the team. In addition, the younger Schumacher finished third at the Italian Grand Prix . Jordan finished the season in 4th place in the constructors' standings. Before the next season, Ralf Schumacher was replaced with Heinz-Harald Frentzen, who has been driving for the Frank Williams team so far. It turned out to be a good choice - the 1999 season turned out to be the best in the history of the team. The German fought Mikka Hakkinen and Eddie Irvin for the world championship for a long time. He stood on the podium 6 times, of which he won 2 times. Damon Hill was doing much worse this time - he scored only 7 points and ended his career after the season. Jordan Grand Prix, with 61 points on his account, took 3rd place in the constructors' standings of the 1999 season.\nHowever, the 2000 season was much worse for Jordan - despite quite good positions in qualifying and two-thirds of Frentzen's places, the team scored just 17 points and only finished 6th in the constructors' standings. The next season's results were even worse, this time the competitors in the yellow cars did not win a single podium place for the first time since 1996. However, the team's total score was slightly higher and amounted to 19 points, which allowed it to take 5th place. In the 2002 season, Fisichella returned to the team. However, it was getting worse - the drivers scored only 9 points throughout the season (although it gave 6th place, just like the previous two seasons). After the season, the engine supplier was changed - instead of Honda, Cosworth was chosen. Jordan began to slide slowly to the bottom. Financial problems ensued. Although the team ended the 2003 season with a slightly greater score - 13 points, it was only enough for the 9th place in the constructors' championship. It's also worth noting that 10 of these 13 points were scored by Fisichella after his rather lucky victory at the Brazilian Grand Prix. The next season was even weaker - Nick Heidfeld and Giorgio Pantano (replaced in the last three races by Timo Glock ) scored just 5 points, which allowed only the weakest team - Minardi - to overtake for years.\nOn February 3, 2005, it was announced that in the last - as it turned out later season, the team will be racing debutants - Portuguese Tiago Monteiro, who previously served as the test driver of the Miniardi team, and Indian Narain Karthikeyan, who entered Formula 1 from the World Series by Nissan. The results were slightly better (12 points), but the place remained the same - 9. Eddie Jordan has sold the team to the Russian group Midland and from the next season the team has been transformed into MF1 Racing."}

Now lets say that we want to know how much these observations differ from their expected numbers. One approach would be to calculate the individual differences (expected - observed), add them all up, and divide by the number of observations. The problem here is that some of the observations will be larger than the expected values resulting in negative difference values.\nTo prevent the negative numbers from canceling out the positive we first need to take the absolute value of each of the differences. The average of the absolutes is called the Mean Absolute Error. The MAE treats all numbers as equal when it calculates the average, however, what if we care more about large differences and not so much about smaller ones. \nThis is where the root mean square is helpful. The RMS first squares the difference values, it then calculates the average and finally takes the root of the result. The square and root operations cancel each other out. And the square operation also neatly solves our problem of negative numbers. Since we are now squaring numbers larger differences count heavier in the final value."}

Scientists have seen it between 780 and 1650 meters above sea level. People sometimes keep these frogs as pets.\nAppearance.\nThe adult male frog is 7.4 cm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 8.4 cm long. The fronts of the faces of male and female frogs have different shapes: females' are rounder. This frog has disks on all its front and back toes for climbing.\nThe frog's skin is green on its back but it has many colors on its underside: lavender, pink, orange and blue down the sides. It has green, blue, and orange on its front feet. It has yellow stripes on its front and back legs. Its belly is yellow to orange in color.\nBehavior.\nThis frog hides during the day and looks for food at night. It lives in forests up in the hills, but scientists have also seen it in city parks and lots.\nYoung.\nThe female frog lays eggs on plant leaves or branches hanging above the water, 47 to 162 eggs at a time. The eggs are green when she lays them and turn light brown as the tadpole gets ready to hatch. When they do hatch, they fall off the plant into the water. The tadpoles have dark brown heads and blue color on their bodies. In a laboratory, the tadpoles take 247 days to become frogs, but scientists think it is probably faster in the wild.\nThreats.\nThis frog is in danger of dying out for many reasons. First, human beings build things and graze animals in the forests where they live. Second, climate change is also changing their forests. Third, there is more ultraviolet radiation than there used to be, and this hurts the frog. Fourth, the disease chytridiomycosis. Chytridiomycosis is caused by a fungus that did not come from South America. People brought it there by accident. Fifth, people also brought the fish \"Xiphophorus hellerii\" to Costa Rica. This fish eats the frog's tadpoles. Sixth, the fly \"Megaselia scalaris\" eats the frog's eggs."}

Hinduism finds its earliest literary mention in the ancient Tamil Sangam literature dated to the 5th - 10th century BCE. Tamil has huge volume of literature in Hinduism especially Saivism and Vainavism. Origin of Hinduism is based on Dravidian folk religion, an ancient non-vedic form of Hinduism.Shaivism developed based on pre-Vedic religions and traditions derived from the southern Tamil Dravidian Shaiva Siddhanta traditions and philosophies.\nSanskrit is the language of the Vedas, Bhagavadgita, Puranas like Bhagavatam, the Upanishads, the Hindu epics like Ramayana and Mahabharata and various other liturgical texts such as the Sahasranama, Chamakam and Rudram. Agamas, the scriptures chiefly constituting the methods of temple construction and creation of \"murti\", worship means of deities, philosophical doctrines, meditative practices, attainment of sixfold desires and four kinds of yoga are in Tamil and Sanskrit.\nMost of the Inscriptions in ancient temples across the Indian subcontinent are in Tamil.Tamil archanas and prayers widely used in temples in South India, Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia. The twelve Azhwars (saint poets of Vaishnavite tradition) and sixty-three Nayanars (saint poets of Shaivite tradition) are regarded as exponents of the \"bhakti\" tradition of Hinduism in South India. Tamil is also one of the oldest continuously used languages in the world.\nSanskrit is also the tongue of most Indian Hindu rituals. It is an Indo-Aryan language and therefore a member of the Indo-European language family. It therefore has some similarities with Greek and Latin, as well as with many vernacular languages of Europe and south Asia. Like Latin and Greek, it also has secular literature along with its religious canon. Most Hindu theologians of later centuries continued to prefer to write in Sanskrit even when it was no longer spoken as a day-to-day language.\nWhile Sanskrit has often been associated with Brahmanism, it remains as the only liturgical link language which connects the different strains of Hinduism that are present across India. Apart from Sanskrit and Tamil, several Hindu spiritual works were composed in the various regional languages of India such as Hindi (incl. Awadhi and Braj Bhasha dialects), Assamese, Bengali, Odia, Maithili, Punjabi, Telugu, Tamil, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Tulu, Old Javanese and Balinese."}

{"id": "878348", "revid": "22027", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=878348", "title": "Kaumaram", "text": "Kaumaram is a Hindu denomination that focuses on the deity of love and war \"Kumara\", also known as \"Murugan\" (in South India), \"Kandan\", or \"Kadamban\", or \"Kartikeya\". Most devotees of Kumara also revere members of his family: Parvati, Shiva, and Ganesha. The important theological texts relating to Kumara are a part of the Shaiva agama canon. This sub-tradition is found among the Tamils, Kannada, Vedda in South India, Sri Lanka, and among the Tamil diaspora worldwide. The love story of Kumara/Murugan and his wife Valli, a girl from a local tribe, is immensely popular in Tamil Nadu, where Kumara acquired the status of a national God.\nThiruppugazh is one of the important Tamil literary work on Kaumaram.\nAssociation with Tamil language.\nAccording to local legends and Tamil folklore, Kartikeya is regarded as a veteran and a guardian of the language that is believed to have been founded by the sage Agastya, with the blessings of Kartikeya. He is considered the patron of the Tamils, due to his worship being widespread among those of Tamil descent.\nLegend of Kartikeya.\nAccording to the Skanda Purana, Kartikeya Muruga was the second son of Shiva and Parvati younger brother to Ganesha. According to the Puranic sources, he incarnated as six sparks emanating from the Third eye of Lord Shiva. According to the Skanda Purana, Muruga imprisoned Brahma, protected Vishnu from the asuras and taught the Pranava Mantram to Shiva. Thus Muruga is considered superior to the Trimurti. The worshippers of Lord Muruga are called Kaumaras.\nWorship traditions.\nTamil Nadu has six primary temples for Kartikeya that are known by the name \"Aru Padai Veedu\", which that translates roughly as \"the Six Stations\".\nModes of worship include \"Kavadi\" that is a form of dance, \"Alagu\" which is a sharp piece of metal that one pierces on the body, carrying milk and water on the heads to offer to the deity and involves a Satvic diet.\nThaipusam is an occasion that is celebrated in Kaumaram. This is much more prevalent in the Murugan Temple in Malaysia. Another chief period of worship is the \"Shashti\". This is a period of six days when villages in South India with primary Kartikeya deities come together for a celebration. The people involved take a vow on following a vegetarian diet for the period. The six days portray events from the life of Kartikeya. The chief parts covered are the ceremonies in which he is awarded the Spear \"Shakti Vel\" by his mother Shakthi, the killing of the demon Surapadman, and his marriage.\nOther than this, Karnataka, that is another prominent place for Kaumaras, would have its own mode of worship. Trekking the Kumara Parvatha where he is believed to have attained Mukthi giving up his life is popular although not essentially in a very traditional manner.\nLiterature and arts.\nThe primary works in Sanskrit related to Kaumaram are Skanda Puranam detailing the history of Kartikeya and Kum\u0101rasambhava, a poem by the Sanskrit scholar Kalidas that literally translates as \"The Creation of Kumara\" or \"the Creation of the Son/Boy\".\nAdi Shankara wrote a piece on Kartikeya called \"Subramanya Bhujangam\" .\nIn Tamil, abundant literature is to be found both in the classical texts and in the folklore. The Skanda Puranam was translated into Tamil. Chief contributors to the classical Tamil texts include Arunagirinathar who wrote hymns of praise with complicated grammar patterns and alliteration and onomatopoeia.\nTamil folk music have hymns written praising the beauty and bravery of Kartikeya. Another chiefly written topic is the way he fell in love and converted his bride Valli. There is a dedicated tune called \"Kavadi Sindhu\" that is usually used to sing such hymns. This tune became associated with celebrations and dances.\nParamparai and Sampradayam.\nLord Muruga in his great mercy and compassion responds to his devotees without the need for a mortal guru. He is the Supreme Guru of the Universe and responds to his devotees in ways that suit their consciousness best. There only is one Sampradaya in the Kaumara faith, that which begins from Lord Muruga Himself. Unfortunately, today the Kaumara faith has lost the glory and majesty it once possessed. It has merged largely into Shaivism. However, ancient texts such as the Kumara Tantra and the Skanda Sadbhava Tantra does give significant insight on the Kaumara faith in its original sense.\nPranava Mantram.\nThere's an anecdote where Shiva pretends to forget the significance of the mantra Om and asks little Kartikeya. The young boy astounds everyone by showing Shiva that it is the source of all creation. This earns him the name \"Thagappan Swami\" or \"Swami Naadha\" meaning he outdid his father."}

Scientists have seen it between 70 and 1199 meters above sea level.\nAppearance.\nFrogs that live in different places are different sizes: Adult male frogs from Costa Rica are 4.8 to 5.6 cm long from nose to rear end and the adult female frog is 6.0 to 7.2 cm long. The frogs that live in Panama are 6.7 to 7.6 cm long and 8.2 and 8.7 cm long. It has webbing on its feet and disks on its toes for climbing.\nThis frog is different colors during the day and at night: much of its back is light green during the day and dark green at night. This frog often has white spots with black outlines on its back. Some frogs have green stripes and yellow throats.\nThis frog hides during the day and looks for food at night. This frog climbs up vines by going hand over hand. It can jump and glide from tree to tree by spreading its webbed front and back feet.\nEggs and tadpoles.\nThe female frog leaves 14-67 eggs at a time. She lays them on the upper side of a leaf hanging over a body of water that is not there all year. Sometimes a male frog will scrape them off the leaf. The eggs take six days to hatch. The tadpoles fall into the water and stay near the surface with their mouths facing up.\nPredators.\nDragonfly nymphs, beetles, and aphids, cicadas, and leafhoppers that live in the water eat the frog's eggs. Green kingfishers eat the tadpoles. Snakes that can climb trees eat the adult frogs.\nThreats.\nThe number of frogs living in the wild is going down but it is not endangered now. Scientists think its population is becoming smaller because of habitat loss and humans building farms and cutting down trees in the places this frog lives."}

Currently lives in Lagos and writes an Arts column for \"The Guardian\". She is also a blogger. \nEarly life.\nShe was born in 1967 in Nigeria. Her life, as she described, was \"a fairly peripatetic life\". In a 2015 interview with Oyebade Dosunmu for \"Ak\u00e9 Review\", Wood said: \"Even long before my UK days I had lived in Northern and South-Western Nigeria as well as Los Angeles\u2014 all by the age of eleven or twelve. There is a sense in which you\u2019re always out of time, out of place\u2014and the years in Britain merely compounded that. The feeling doesn\u2019t go away with return to Nigeria, it merely mutates, as people remark about me coming across as someone from \u2018away\u2019, even when I\u2019m trying to blend in. I am therefore pretty sensitive to the permutations of dislocation and re-integration. London was a huge tableau for me to observe this theatre of human experience as far as Nigerian immigrants were concerned.\"\nCareer.\nShe was described as \"one of the eminent voices in the Arts in Nigeria\".\nShe writes short stories, flash fiction, poetry and essays. Her works were published in a media such as \"African Literature Today\", \"Chimurenga\", \"Farafina Magazine\", \"Sentinel Poetry\", \"DrumVoices Revue\", \"Sable LitMag\", \"Eclectica Magazine\", \"The New Gong Book of New Nigerian Short Stories\" (ed. Adewale Maja-Pearce, 2007), and \"\" (ed. Chris Brazier; New Internationalist, 2009).\nIn 2007 her fiction was highly commended in the Commonwealth Broadcasting Association's Short Story Competition. \nIn 2008 she won the inaugural John La Rose Memorial Short Story Competition.\nHer collection of short stories, \"Indigo\", was published in 2013 by Parr\u00e9sia Publishers. \"Indigo\" was well received, with \"Critical Literature Review\" calling it \"a reader's pleasure\".\nAs Oyebade Dosunmu writes: \"Wood tells stories of people who inhabit in between \u2018indigo\u2019 spaces: the borderland of immigration, the no-man's-land of multiculturalism and the frontiers of social mobility. These worlds spiral into one another and their inhabitants spin along, negotiating extremes of human circumstance\u2014barrenness, the (fated) pursuit of glamour, madness, death\u2014struggling, all the while, to plant roots in shifting sand.\" Many of the stories dealt with the lives of African women negotiating concerns such as barrenness, polygamy and widowhood. Wood has said that \"these are the writings of a womanist and a feminist. I have a great empathy, a well of feeling for what women go through. I don\u2019t feel these are given adequate treatment in the writings of male writers, so it\u2019s really up to us, the female writers, to privilege the voices and experiences of women.\"\nWood was a judge for the 2015 Etisalat Prize for Literature.

The frog has two ranges: one on the Pacific side of the mountains and one on the Atlantic side of the mountains. Scientists have seen it between 200 and 2130 meters above sea level.\nThe adult male frog is 6.1 to 6.4 cm long from nose to rear end, and one female was found to be 5.9 cm long. The skin on the frog's back is dark green to light green. It has orange on its sides, inside its legs, and on some of its toes. Its belly is yellow to white. The irises of its eyes are red or purple.\nThis frog lays eggs after heavy rain. The female lays the eggs on rocks or plants that hang over the water. The eggs are green in color. When the tadpoles hatch, they fall into the water. The eggs do not start to hatch for 9-12 days, and they take 2-3 days to hatch completely. Most tadpoles hatch at night. However, scientists have seen these eggs do something strange: If something shakes or disturbs the group of eggs\u2014for example, a tree snake trying to eating some of them\u2014the other eggs will hatch early. This will also happen if the eggs fall into the water.\nThis frog is endangered in Mexico because of the fungal disease chytridiomycosis. The fungus has killed almost all of these frogs there. As of 2007, the disease had spread to El Salvador too. This frog is also in danger because of habitat loss (people changing its forests into farms) and because humans capture them to sell as pets."}

Here, alongside Fritz Overbeck and other young painters of the academy, he joined the Tartarus student association, which also published irregular magazines in which he participated with illustrations. It was also here that he met the painter Fritz Mackensen, who was already well-known at the time. The painter Peter Philippi described 'Tartarus' as \"next to the great Malkasten, [... it] was a [...] refreshing [group or] union of young, seriously aspiring artists, among others Robert Engels, Karl Krumbacher, Ludwig Keller, Otto Modersohn, Robert Weise, Paul Schr\u00f6ter, Adelbert Niemeyer, Ernst Christian Pfannschmidt.\nFrom D\u00fcsseldorf, Schroeter moved to the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich and joined the Allgemeine Deutsche Kunstgenossenschaft. Active in Munich since 1893, he became a member of the Munich Secession with participation in the spring exhibition in May 1894. Study trips took him to Holland, Belgium and Spain and for a short time he stayed in the , where he met Carl Bantzer, Georg Burmester and Wilhelm Thielmann. From 1898 to 1901, Schroeter lived in Hamburg and became friends with and , the co-founders of the Hamburgischer K\u00fcnstlerklub. As an illustrator, he produced commissioned works for the Munich magazine \"Jugend\": 1898 \"Haideblume\" and \"Dornr\u00f6schen und die Alte\" and 1913 a \"Vignette\".\nHe had a close friendship with Mackensen, Modersohn and Overbeck, and they persuaded him to come to the still young K\u00fcnstlerkolonie Worpswede. With his wife Grete and their children, Schroeter moved to Worpswede in 1901, and from there to Horn-Lehe around 1904, where he became a member of the Deutscher K\u00fcnstlerbund. There, in northern Germany, he painted portraits, landscapes and interior pictures with mostly rural themes. The reviews were not always positive, as the magazine \"Die Kunst\" wrote in 1903:\nIn 1908, Schroeter left Bremen, moved to Berlin, was a member of the Verein Berliner K\u00fcnstler, and lived there in Lichterfelde.\nSchroeter was a still life, landscape, genre and portrait painter as well as a graphic artist. Many of his works are in private collections. Most of his work were lost during the Second World War."}

When none of the other people could do it, Columbus took the egg, smashed it from one end, and placed it on the table, showing that it was actually very simple. Seeing this, everyone began to object, saying that they could do the same. To which Columbus replied, \"The difference, gentlemen, is that you could do it, when I did.\"\nHistory.\nHistorians are not sure if Columbus really did this in real life. They think it is likely that people made the story up many years later.\nGirolamo Benzoni wrote about this story in \"Historia del Mondo Nuovo\" in 1565. Historians think Benzoni might have been the first person to tell the story, but they are not sure.\nOne reason they think so is that almost the exact same story showed up in another book, by painter Giorgio Vasari in 1550. In Vasari's book, it was the builder Filippo Brunelleschi who flattened the egg. This was to explain how he built the heavy done for the Santa Maria del Fiore church.\nUses.\nIn English, people use term \"egg of Columbus\" to describe puzzles.\nWriters Mary Shelley, Leo Tolstoy and others have mentioned the story of Columbus and the egg in their books."}

They were common in the British Isles from the time of Elizabeth I to the 1800s. They were thought to be socially inferior to highwaymen (who robbed on horseback), often considered low criminals, opposed to highwaymen who would sometimes become infamous as well as famous. This term was commonly used from the 16th century to the 19th century, but slowly fell out of use.\nFootpads always operated on foot, and robbed people after scaring them. Usually operating in the dark, they used this to their advantage by frightening the victim and getting away unseen; some of these crimes were brutally violent, although most commited them out of need and preferred more passive methods. \nThey opted for this method due to the high price of horses and the incognito factor of the dark. These activities usually took place in gangs."}
{"id": "878782", "revid": "2133", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=878782", "title": "Mercerised cotton", "text": "Mercerisation is a textile finishing treatment for cellulose fabric and yarn. It is mainly used for cotton and flax. The process changes the properties of the materials: They can be colored more easily, they withstand tearing better, and the fabric will shrink less, when washed. Fabrics treated that way also have a luster which make them resemble silk in some ways.\nSometimes, cotton treated that way is called \"Fil d'\u00e9cosse\". Sometimes wool treated in the Mercosett process is also called mercerised. \nThe process of mercerisation is long, and realtively costly. For this reason, only higher quality textiles are treated that way.\nDevelopment.\nAbout 1844, John Mercer developed the process. He noticed that when he treated cotton with solutions of sodium hydroxide, this changed the properties of the cotton: The fabric shrank, and had a higher resistance to tearing. It was also easier to color the material using dyes. \nIn the original process of Mercer, no tension was applied. The product was termed \"fulled cotton\", a nod to the process of fulling in woven wool fabric. For Mercer, making the material easier to color was the most important technical aspect.\nMercer also tried with sulfuric acid and zinc chloride solutions and discovered the parchmentising effect of sulfuric acid.\nThe silk-like lustre now commonly associated with mercerising is produced by tension and was discovered by Horace Lowe in 1890.\nProcess.\nTreatment with sodium hydroxide destroys the spiral form of the cellulose with formation of alkali cellulose, which is changed to cellulose hydrate on washing out the alkali. Caustic soda concentrations of 20\u201326% are used. Effective mercerization requires the use of wetting agents.\nThe improved lustre of mercerised cotton is due to the production of nearly circular cotton fibres under tension. Another characteristic feature is the untwisting (deconvolution) of the cotton hair.\nIn dry mercerization, the process is carried out while drying the fabric on a stenter."}

Anne, after a month of living in a cave, is taken in by the Plantars, a family of frogs that consists of excitable young Sprig; unpredictable and adventurous baby pollywog Polly; and overprotective and traditional grandfather Hop Pop who live on a farm in the town of Wartwood. As she bonds with her newfound family, Anne gradually learns what it means to be a hero and develop a true friendship, all the while trying to find her friends and return home. The matter is complicated when Sasha allies with Captain Grime, leader of the warfaring toads of Toad Tower, who seek to control their home of Frog Valley.\nSeason 2.\nAnne and the Plantars go on a road trip to the Amphibian capital, Newtopia, to learn the secrets of the Calamity Box and find a way to get Anne home. There, Anne reunites with Marcy, who offers to help restore the box's power through a series of ancient trials, unaware that Amphibia's ruler, King Andrias secretly has his own plans for them. Meanwhile, Sasha and Grime plot to invade Newtopia and overthrow the monarch, allowing the toads to rule over all of Amphibia.\nSeason 3.\nAnne and the Plantars are transported to Anne's home in the suburbs of East Los Angeles. Anne must now help the frog family adjust to the human world and keep their identities a secret, while searching for a way to return to Amphibia and stop Andrias's invasion on the Multiverse. In Amphibia, Sasha and Grime lead the people of Wartwood in a rebellion against Andrias. However, Andrias begins sending forces to Earth to eliminate Anne, while keeping Marcy in suspended animation inside of a stasis capsule for future plans."}

The Prime Minister and the ministers have to be members of the National Assembly of Azerbaijan.

This ammunition is usually called cartridge. When guns are used in movies, or theatre performances, special cartridges are used. These cartridges are called blanks.

They will however not fire a protectile (called bullet, or shot). \nBlanks are also used in historical reenactments, special effects for theatre, movie and television productions, and combat training.\nBlanks are less dangerous than real ammunition. There is still a danger in using blanks: Firing a shot will release hot gases. Any object in the cartridge will be propelled outward and may cause injury and perhaps death at close range. \nThere is a difference between a blank cartridge, and fake ammunition: Fake ammunition does not contain gunpowder, and will produce neither a sound, nor flash. Fake ammunition is used for the testing if a firearm works as it should. Blanks are also different from percussion caps, used in cap guns. Percussion caps contain only enough gunpower to ignite: as a result, they sound much softer. "}

During the day it is pale green. At night, it is red-brown, lavender-brown, or orange. Its belly is white.

The eggs are 3 to 3.5 mm in diameter, not including the capsule around each egg. The eggs take one to two weeks to hatch.

This may be because humans have changed the forests where it used to live by cutting down trees for lumber and because of disease. For example, the fungal disease chytridiomycosis."}

American English is spoken in the United States, while British English is spoken in the United Kingdom. Both types of English are different to each other in some ways, for example in spelling, punctuation, grammar and vocabulary.\nSpelling.\nThere are many words that sound the same in both American and British English but have different spellings. British English often keeps more traditional ways of spelling words than American English. For example:\nBecause some chemical elements have different spellings in American and British English, IUPAC has to use only one spelling of a word in their papers. For example:\nPunctuation.\nPunctuation is the name for the marks used in writing text. Punctuations, for example brackets/parentheses, full stops/periods, quotation marks/inverted commas, have different rules in American and British English.\nBrackets/parentheses.\nIn British English, \"( )\" marks are sometimes called \"brackets\", \"[ ]\" are called \"square brackets\" and \"{ }\" are called \"curly brackets\". In formal British English and in American English, \"( )\" marks are \"parentheses\" (singular: parenthesis), \"[ ]\" are called \"brackets\" or \"square brackets\", and \"{ }\" can be called \"curly brackets\" or \"braces\". These marks are used in the same way in both dialects.\nQuotation.\nThe rules on quoting a text is different in American and British English. In American English, \" and ' are called \"quotation marks\". In British English, \" and ' are called \"inverted commas\" or \"speech marks\". In American English, it is common to use the double quotation mark ( \" ) in direct speech. In British English, it is common to use the single inverted comma ( ' )."}

Smith, Jr., is a developer and marketer of both enterprise and consumer-level software and services. Headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Smith Micro maintains multiple domestic and international offices. United States locations include Aliso Viejo, California, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. International offices are located throughout Europe and Asia. Currently, the company focuses on digital lifestyle solutions and security technologies, and is integrated into the evolving wireless media industry, as indicated by partnerships with cellular service providers such as Verizon Wireless, AT&amp;T, and Sprint Corporation, now owned by T-Mobile US after the Sprint &amp; T-Mobile merger in April 2020.\nCorporate history.\nSmith Micro's initial focus was on dial-up modem and fax software technology, distributing predominantly to OEM computer software/hardware manufacturers. Smith Micro established an IPO in 1995, and became publicly traded in the NASDAQ under the symbol SMSI. Initial stock values were approx. $12.75 per share.\nAs the company entered the 90's, dial-up internet was quickly being replaced by cable internet, DSL, and wireless broadband due to substantially higher speeds and increased reliability. This change led Smith Micro to venture into wireless and mobile network software. Network connection management became an expertise of the company and, Smith Micro quickly developed products of interest to large-scale mobile network operators such as AT&amp;T, Bell Canada, Orange, Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon, and Vodafone. While fax and modem-related products were still a part of their portfolio, the QuickLink Platform of wireless connection managers became a primary source of revenue in the early 2000s.\nBy 2005, Smith Micro acquired Allume Systems and their StuffIt data compression software. Soon after, Smith Micro acquired Israel-based image editing company, PhoTags. Smith Micro followed with two more acquisitions, (e frontier America and busineSMS.com Software.) By acquiring these smaller companies, Smith Micro rapidly expanded its consumer business presence, however the company retained focus on network and wireless-related products.\nIn early 2008, the company began to expand its portfolio with the addition of wireless access and mobile services. Smith Micro introduced multiple solutions for enhanced mobile communications, such as push-to-talk software, visual voicemail services, and video streaming. Smith Micro also expressed interest in WiMAX broadband, a newly developed cellular technology which was considered to be a 4G wireless protocol and the replacement of current 3G cellular systems.\nIn 2019, Smith Micro entered the retail technology space with its acquisition of ISM Connect, LLC\u2019s Smart Retail product suite. Most recently, the company has continued to expand its family safety business through the acquisitions of \u00a0Circle Media Labs\u2019 operator business in February 2020, and the Family Safety Mobile Business of Avast Software s.r.o in April 2021."}

If one instruction is not carried out the other instructions below it will not be executed.\nExamples of Procedural Programming Languages.\nThe above languages listed above are considered procedural because of the manner in which they execute when they are run. Consider one example in C programming:\nint main()\n int num1 = 5;\n int num2 = 10;\n int sum = num1 + num2;\n printf(\"%d + %d = %d\", num1, num2, sum);\n return (0);\n/* Output */\n// 5 + 10 = 15\nAs we can see the execution goes from top to bottom. In the event that one instruction is wrong the execution is halted and an error occurs in procedural languages if the error isn't handled.\nDisadvantages.\nConsidering the above pros and cons is important as you develop projects."}

This frog lives in tropical forests that are not too high up in the hills. Scientists have seen this frog sitting on leaves about 4 meters above the ground. The female frog lays eggs on leaves over temporary pools of water (bodies of water that are only there for part of the year and dry up at other times).

All these frogs could have come from the same ancestor frog that lived in early Cenozoic in South America, where the Phyllomedusidae still live. The two families of frogs would have split from one another during the Eocene period. The ancestors of Pelodryadidae probably colonized Australasia from South America by going through Antarctica, which at the time was not yet frozen over. The clade with both families is sister to the Hylidae, from which they split apart in the early Paleogene.\nTaxonomy.\nThe family Phyllomedusidae contains the following genera:"}

The spirituality of transgenders is considered as authentic as that of men and women. The Prophet of Islam treated transgenders with respect, prohibited their ill-treatment, and had good things to say about spiritually-inclined transgenders. Believing that transgenders are dearer to God (The Creator), some Muslim rulers appointed them as intercessors in Royal Palaces, including those of the Ottomans and the Mughals.\nIn the Indus Valley Region i.e. (Pakistan), the Mughals appointed transgenders to positions of power and trust. Transgenders served as courtiers and councils, giving advice to Princes and Princesses. They were familiar with court etiquettes and knew the secret workings of Mughal households. They were domestic insiders. Having the controls of intelligence officers and the prestige of Royal confidantes, transgenders enjoyed special powers and privileges unavailable even to the most powerful Wazirs (ministers) of the Islamic Kingdom. Transgenders were educated in statecraft and nuances of religion.

Max, annoyed with the fuss, decides to hide in the garage parked car and falls asleep.\nConcerned about losing their home, Jeff goes to retrieve the doll, only to find that it is missing. Believing that Max stole it, he manages to locate the Mercer household the next day, only to find the whole family hastily leaving. During the commotion, he overhears the security code and sees where the house key is hidden. He tells Pam about it and they agree to go and steal the doll at night. Meanwhile, Max discovers that the whole family has left and takes advantage of it by having fun, though he quickly grows bored. Jeff and Pam arrive at the Mercer house and get inside. Max overhears them talking about getting an \"ugly little boy\" and assumes they are talking about him. He manages to scare them away by calling the cops. Officer Buzz McCallister arrives, but Pam manages to divert him. Max realizes that if he found out he was home alone, his parents might get arrested.\nCarol discovers that Max has been left home alone and buys a ticket to head back. The McKenzies head to church the next day where they run into their realtor Gavin Washington who tells them that they have a buyer, but they need to decide by the end of the year; putting pressure on them. Max arrives and unknowingly converses with Jeff and Pam's son Chris who sympathetically gives him his nerf gun. Jeff and Pam spot Max talking with an elder afterwards and assume she is his grandmother. They resolve to break into the house once again while the rest of their family is still at church. They sneak around the back of the house, but end up in the neighbor's backyard instead. Max overhears them once again plotting with Jeff agreeing to arrive dressed as Santa in an effort to fool him. Max responds by setting up traps in his house while Jeff and Pam wait for their family to fall asleep on Christmas Eve.\nJeff and Pam are subjected to Max's traps, during which they discover that Max did not steal the doll, but instead stole a can of soda. They clear up the misunderstanding, but learn that Max is also home alone and agree to let him stay with them until his mother comes back. As they explain the whole situation to their family, it turns out that Ollie stole the doll and manage to safely retrieve it, thus ensuring that the McKenzies will stay. Carol arrives to pick up Max and, having moved into their house only two months ago, finds friends in the McKenzies and thanks them for taking care of Max. One year later, the Mercers and McKenzies have Christmas dinner together with Jeff having gotten a new job and willingly gives Max the soda he craved the year prior.\nMarketing.\nThe first trailer released on October 12, 2021.
