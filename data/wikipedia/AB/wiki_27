So \"SmackDown\" needed to find a challenger for Dean for \"SummerSlam\" and they had a six-pack challenge to find the challenger.

Because of that, Stephanie gave Seth the first spot in the first Universal Championship match. Then, Finn beat Cesaro, Kevin Owens and Rusev in a fatal 4-way match and Roman beat Chris Jericho, Sami Zayn and Sheamus in another fatal 4-way.

He was sentenced to death after he wrote an article about discrimination and the caste system in Mauritania.\nMohamed is an engineer from the northern industrial city of Nouadhibou. He belongs to the Moulamines, or blacksmith group, the lowest social group in Mauritania. He worked for SAMMA, a company partly owned by the Canadian mining corporation Kinross.\nAnti-slavery article.\nMohemed wrote an article called \"Religion, religiosity and craftsmen,\" that criticized Mauritania's caste system. The article was published on the news website Aqlame on December 31, 2013. Mauritania abolished slavery in 1981, but activists say it is still very common and that many Mauritanians are born into slavery. Mauritania passed a new anti-slavery law in 2015 that makes slavery a \"crime against humanity\". \nThe editor of Aqlame took down the article, and said it was published by accident.\nCourt cases.\nOn January 2, 2014, Mohamed was arrested in his home in the city of Nouadhibou. He was charged with apostasy under Article 306 of the Mauritanian criminal code, and sentenced to death. There were national demonstrations against Mohamed, and there was a fatwa to kill him. His family denounced him. His lawyers dropped him and he could not get another lawyer, only the lawyers assigned by the court. The trial started a day late because of a fight in the courtroom. The prosecuting lawyer said he was a member of the caste that the blogger criticized in his article. Mohamed belongs to a lower social class.\nAccording to Abdel Nasser Beibe, a Mauritanian activist and representative of the Arab Thinking Foundation, there are many people who wrote about the same things as Mohamed, but they belong to the white community, who are the majority of the people, and no one asks for their death. Their tribes and their families defend them against any attack. But Mohamed comes from the \"blacksmith\" minority, and are very marginalized. After the article, his family and caste had to deny him, and his parents had to go into exile in France. \nMekfoula Brahim, activist and president of For a Green and Democratic Mauritania says that Mohamed was a victim of a very hard prison sentence because he belongs to a powerless and hated group. Mekfoula says Muhamed's future is being controlled by street fanatics, who receive orders from extremist clerics influenced by radicals who have returned from Afghanistan and Iraq, who press them to execute the boy.\nThe president of Mauritania, Abdel Aziz spoke to the country in January 2014, saying Mauritanian is an Islamic state and the death penalty could be used against Mohamed. Abdel Aziz ususally wears a business suit and tie in public, and when he speaks with Western allies, like the United States and France. but when he spoke to the nation about Momhamed Ould Mkhaitir, he wore a white Salafi robe and turban.\nAn appeal court heard the case on April 1, 2016, under tight security. The court upheld the verdict, but sent the case back to Mauritania's supreme court. On Jan. 31, 2017, Mauritania\u2019s supreme court heard the case, and returned it to the appeal court.

{"id": "575284", "revid": "1068258", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=575284", "title": "Goicoechea (canton)", "text": "Goicoechea is the 8th canton in the Province of San Jose, Costa Rica, with a population of 115,084 as of 2011. The city of Guadalupe is its main district. It forms part of the broader San Jos\u00e9 metropolitan area, itself the capital of the Republic.\nGeographic Location.\nGoicoechea is located northeast of the capital city of San Jos\u00e9. Goicoechea's geographic center is 09\u00b057'31\" latitude north and 83\u00ba 59'26\" longitude west.\nThe canton is narrowly shaped in width and elongated in length. It is a maximum of 20 kilometers wide in a southeast by northeast direction from the source of the Durazno River to the bridge crossing the T\u00f3rres River, along Nacional No. 5 road, that leads from San Jos\u00e9 to San Juan de Tib\u00e1s.\nIt borders:\nEtymology.\nThe canton is named after an illustrious national forefather, Franciscan friar Jos\u00e9 Antonio de Liendo y Goicoechea who was born in the city of Cartago in the Province of Cartago, Costa Rica, on the 3rd of May, 1735, and died July 2, 1814, in Guatemala.\nHistory.\nThe area corresponding to the Goicoechea canton during the pre-Columbian period was populated by an indigenous people called the Western Huetar Kingdom, under the rule of king Garabito at the start of the Spanish Conquest.\nThe first canton dwellers established themselves in what today is called Calle Blancos (White Street), the first street neighborhood in the area. This name was assigned to the area as a result of the many people by the name of Blanco (White) who had taken residence there. The population began to spread eastbound, stretching paths toward what later became known as the canton's center.\nIn 1828, the main district (known as the Municipality) of San Jos\u00e9 divided the Murci\u00e9lago neighborhood into several groups of houses. This gave cause for registering, under the name of San Jos\u00e9 del Murci\u00e9lago, what today is known as the , which became a village and eventually on August 6, 1891, according to Law No. 56 during Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn Rodr\u00edguez Zeled\u00f3n's administration, this village was granted township status to head the canton as its main district. Entry for San Jos\u00e9 del Murci\u00e9lago was recorded in the Neighborhoods and Quarters Boundary Register at the Department of San Jos\u00e9 a full 63 years before Guadalupe reached municipality status for the Canton of Goicoechea.\nAs of November 30, 1841, the Neighborhood and Dwellings Boundary Register's entries for the Los Santos neighborhood, along with the San Francisco, San Ram\u00f3n, San Jos\u00e9, San Rafael and San Joaqu\u00edn quarters matched what presently corresponds to a large portion of the Goicoechea canton. And in 1844 residents of the San Jos\u00e9 quarter negotiated a permit to build a hermitage dedicated to their patron St. Joseph. Six years later, the first parson of the area, presbyter Raimundo Mora, changed the patron saint as well as the name of the quarter from San Jos\u00e9 to Guadalupe, in honor of the Virgin of Guadalupe, being that he was her devotee. He also broke ground for the cemetery, which is one of the oldest works in the city of Guadalupe. In 1855 a began to be built where it is still presently located. The following year a parish was built, during the episcopacy of monsignor Joaqu\u00edn Anselmo Llorente y Lafuente, Costa Rica's first bishop, and it is currently suffragan of the archdiocese of San Jos\u00e9, belonging to the ecclesiastic province of Costa Rica.\nThe regional demographic and economic development that occurred in Goicoechea resulted from the planting of coffee. It became the dominant product as of 1850, replacing the large tabacco plantations that had constituted the main source of income for the earliest population. The \"golden bean\" was introduced to Guadalupe in 1840 by Jos\u00e9 Manuel N\u00fa\u00f1ez, who planted it and established the first processing site at his former wheat mill. Another important factor in regional development was the Camino de Carrillo (Road to Carrillo), located near the confluence of the Sucio and Honduras rivers. The need for this road was due to local coffee farmers' demands to deliver their beans to the Lim\u00f3n harbor on the Atlantic for exportation, thereby shortening the cargo journey to their main European markets. At first the thought was to build a train track from San Jos\u00e9, the country's capital, to Lim\u00f3n, moving through Paso de La Palma. Later in 1881, when the road section had reached Carrillo, the national government proposed to discontinue construction to open a road instead from San Jos\u00e9 to Carrillo. The following year that new road was inaugurated, but was in use for very little time, given its high cost of maintenance and traffic on it becoming sparse, once a train track construction from San Jos\u00e9 to the Caribbean coast was completed in 1890.\nGoicoechea's first elementary school was built in 1883. It is located north of the Goicoechea Park. Afterward Escuela Carlos Gagini was built, and then in 1939 a new grammar school was inaugurated called Escuela Pilar Jim\u00e9nez Sol\u00eds, during president Le\u00f3n Cort\u00e9s Castro's administration. The secondary school Liceo Napole\u00f3n Quesada began operations in 1955, during president Jos\u00e9 Figueres Ferrer's first administration.\nGuadalupe has been Goicoechea's municipality since 1891. But given its population growth, as of on August 10, 1920, during president Julio Acosta Garc\u00eda's administration, Law No. 69 conferred to it the title of city.\nOfficial Founding.\nGoicoechea was officially drawn away from the canton of San Jos\u00e9 and established by decree via Law No. 36 on December 7, l848. Law No. 56 decreed on August 6, 1891 that Goicoechea be itself established as a canton in the province of San Jos\u00e9 with Guadalupe as its municipality. Yet this law did not define any other districts for the canton, though it did recognize 6 townships toward that end.\nThe first Canton Board Hearing of Goicoechea occurred on September 13, 1891 with representatives Francisco Jim\u00e9nez N\u00fa\u00f1ez serving as president, Tom\u00e1s Guti\u00e9rrez and Ezequiel Vargas serving as vice presidents. Jes\u00fas Zeled\u00f3n served as secretary and Basileo Araya as political chief.\nThe first aqueduct and sewage lines were inaugurated in 1910 under president Ricardo Jim\u00e9nez Oreamuno's administration.\nPolitical Segmentation.\nGoicoechea consists of 7 districts:\nPhysical Characteristics.\nGeology.\nGeologically, Goicoechea canton is grounded on volcanic matter dating to the Quartenary Period. Rocks from the Pleistocene epoch predominate in the region. Dating to this period, there are rolling structures located between Villa Rancho Redondo and the Purral district. Volcanic structures, recently and presently established, formed during the Holocene epoch. They are associated to pyroclastics and other volcanic matter such as lava, lahars and pyroclasts. The earliest ones are located west of the canton, originating from Villa Rancho Redondo. The later ones originate from Purral and move east.\nGeomorphology.\nThe Goicoechea canton is part of a geomorphic unit of volcanic origin, which is divided into two sub-units called the Iraz\u00fa Volcano and the Volcanic Filling of the Central Valley.\nThe Iraz\u00fa Volcano sub-unit is located to the east of the canton from Villa Mata de Pl\u00e1tano. It consists of slopes of all kinds. The contours of the hills are rounded due to the thickness of recent ash deposits that cover almost the whole surface mass. The sub-unit is composed of volcanic rocks displaying gaps, lavas, tuffs, agglomerates, ignimbrites, ash and also many streams of mud and lahars. The rocks' degree of weathering is highly variable, with its origin being due to the accumulation of different type of volcanic rocks.\nThe volcanic filling of the Central Valley, located in the western sector of the canton, corresponds to a flat undulating surface. It is possible that changes on the surface within the area are due to the presence of lava only a few meters below the surface. This constitutes a front. The sub-unit takes surface form from volcanic rocks, mainly lavas, tuffs and ignimbrites covered by ash in varying thickness. The sequence flow of lavas rests on sedimentary rock. The lavas are of the andesitic type. Geomorphologically, this unit is not a valley. Nevertheless, for political, socio-economic reasons and various other kinds of references, it is preferable to continue calling this region the Central Valley. The correct technical name is Tectonic Pit, due to the presence of a fault along the foot of the Central Volcanic Sierra, which is evidenced by the existence of thermo-mineral sources. Also there is an abrupt interruption in the foothills that align with the fault as they descend from the Central Volcanic Sierra mountain range towards the valley. Additionally, there is the presence of an unexplained \"volcanism\" (Pacacua Formation) that corresponds with or nears the position of the fault.\nAltitudes.\nElevations above sea level for the urban centers in the districts of Goicoechea canton follow:\nHydrography.\nThe fluvial system of the canton of Goicoechea follows Pacific slope, which belongs to the basin of the Grande de T\u00e1rcoles River.\nThe rivers that drain the region begin with the Purral River, with the Navarro River as its tributary as well as the Mozotal brook. The Purral river is a tributary of the Torres River along with the Cangrejos, Patalillo and Patal brooks, together with the Tirib\u00ed, Ip\u00eds, Durazno and Barreal streams. These watercourses, except for the Torres River, have their source in the canton, on the western slope of the Cabeza de Vaca Hill, and course east-to-west. The Torres, Tirib\u00ed, Durazno, Ip\u00eds flows, and the ravines Barreal and Patal serve as cantonal borders. The first borders with San Jos\u00e9 and Montes de Oca. The second borders with the Cartago province. The rivers Durazno and Ip\u00eds along with V\u00e1zquez de Coronado and the ravines, respectively border with the cantons of Moravia and Montes de Oca.\nRelative to Costa Rica's Surface Area.\nThe canton's maximum width is 12.43 miles (20 km), spreading northeast to southwest from the source of the Durazno River to the bridge over the Torres River, along National Highway No.5, which runs from San Jos\u00e9 to San Juan de Tib\u00e1s.\nGoicoechea Institutions.\nGoicoechea is home to important institutions of various kinds, both governmental and private, as well as a series of industries of great recognition, established mainly in the Calle Blancos industrial zone. Worthy to be noted are:\nSocial Challenges.\nThe canton of Goicoechea has been characterized for being an area of important industrial and commercial development in the province of San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica's capital. An example of its importance may best be seen in that companies such as Motorola and Durman Esquivel remained located in the district of Calle Blancos along with Coca Cola-FEMSA bottling corporation for decades. The construction of the industrial complex Parque Empresarial del Este in the same district has added multinational accounts, namely Amazon, Bank of America, Teletech, among others to this list of growing companies that have increased the rate of employment in the area, while the infrastructure, especially roads, has remained unchanged, leading to excessive congestion."}

Tess Fitzpatrick, Professor of Applied Linguistics in the Centre for Language and Communication Research at Cardiff University, is the chair from 2015-2018.\nBAAL's Annual Meeting happens every September in the UK. BAAL is part of the \"Association Internationale de Linguistique Appliquee\" (International Association of Applied Linguistics, AILA). In the UK, it is a registered charity. BAAL meetings usually have a theme.The theme of the 40th conference at the University of Edinburgh was 'Technology, Ideology and Practice in Applied Linguistics'.\nHistory.\nThe association started in the 1960s. At that time, more people were becoming interested in the new science of modern linguistics and they were especially interested in practical results. One important area of applied linguistics is language teaching and learning. Also at this time, the European Union was becoming more important, so people in Europe needed better language teaching.\nPeter Strevens, the Chair in Applied Linguistics at the University of Essex first had the idea to start BAAL. At a meeting at Birkbeck College in July 1965, the original idea for BAAL was to study mainly language teaching and machine translation. However, at the first full meeting in 1967 in Reading, Berkshire the group decided to study many different topics. BAAL became the UK member of AILA, and Pit Corder was its first Chair. At first, membership was only for academics because BAAL wanted people to think it was a group of experts, not a teachers' meeting. However, by the early 1970s it became easier to join BAAL. Since 1985, anyone can join. There are no requirements to become a member. In 1980, the Association began to publish a journal called, \"Applied Linguistics\"."}

The operating system can then emulate the DOS software.\nVDMs like Windows 3.x 386 Enhanced Mode can add support for using 16-/32-bit protected mode software if they use the DOS Protected Mode Interface (DPMI).\nIf a DOS program in a VDM needs to use a peripheral, Windows will give the DOS program a virtual device driver (VDD) which emulates the hardware using commands that the operating system it is running on can understand.\nDOS VDMs.\nDOS VDMs appeared on Windows/386 2.01 in 1987 and were also in Windows 3.x, if you were using 386 Enhanced Mode as well as in 95, 98, 98 SE and Me.\nSimilar to Windows 3.x, VDMs can let you run many DOS applications at one time if you use the EMM386 /MULTI option. Digital Research / Novell was working on a similar system since 1991 under the codename \"Vladivar\" (originally a device driver KRNL386.SYS and not part of EMM386). It was made for the next version of DR\u00a0DOS, released as Novell DOS 7 in 1994, but it was also used in their \"Star Trek\" project, which they stopped working on before finishing.\nOS/2 MVDM.\nVDMs called MVDM (Multiple Virtual DOS Machine) are used in OS/2 2.0 and later. OS/2 MVDMs are better than NTVDM in many ways, for example with block devices. While the OS/2 1.x emulated DOS 3.0, 2.x emulated DOS 5.0.\nRunning Windows 3.1 applications in OS/2 looks similar to XP Mode in Windows 7, but the technologies used are very different. A \"guest\" VDM permits programs to use the disks of the OS/2 or NT operating system that is running the VDM. Applications in a VDM can use named pipes to talk to their \"host\".\nWindows NTVDM.\nNTVDM is included in all x86 versions of Windows made on NT, and let 16-bit Windows and 16-/32-bit DOS applications run. It is not included with 64-bit versions (see Limitations). ntvdm.exe helps emulate the APIs needed to run 16-bit DOS and Windows applications.\nNTVDM uses NTIO.SYS and NTDOS.SYS, which runs a changed version of COMMAND.COM. The 16-bit system files are smaller versions of their MS-DOS 5.0 counterparts, including IO.SYS, MSDOS.SYS and COMMAND.COM, which remove biases with the FAT file system and can also call the 32-bit NTVDM if needed. NTDOS originally gave a DOS version of 30.00 to programs, but this soon was changed to 5.00 to let more programs to run without being changed However, there are many newer MS-DOS functions and commands added to MS-DOS versions 6.x and in Windows 9x which are not there.\n16-bit programs run separately within one 32-bit NTVDM process. Checking \"Run in separate memory space\" in the \"Run\" dialog box or shortcut of the program creates a new process instead. NTVDM emulates BIOS functions, the Windows 3.1 kernel, and its 16-bit API.\n32-bit DOS emulation is used for DPMI and using 32-bit memory. wowexec.exe is the emulator process for 16-bit Windows. Windows 2000 added Sound Blaster 2.0 emulation to 32-bit NTVDM. 16-bit and DOS virtual device drivers can't be run. Win16 programs can communicate with other parts of Windows using OLE, DDE and named pipes.\nAs virtual 8086 mode isn't available on non-x86 processors, NTVDM was a full emulator for NT on these architectures. NT 3.51 could only 80286, but since NT 4.0, 486 emulation was added.\nSecurity issues.\nIn January 2010, Google security researcher Tavis Ormandy discovered a large security problem in NTVDM system letting non-Administrators to increase their permissions to the SYSTEM level. Ormandy claimed it was a problem for all x86 versions of Windows NT after 1993. 32-bit versions of NT 3.X/4.0, 2000, XP, 2003, Vista, 2008, and 7 were affected. Ormandy published how the problem works. Before Microsoft could fix it, you could turn off 16-bit application support to solve the problem, but it made so you could not run 16-bit programs. x64 Windows never had this problem because it doesn't use NTVDM. After applying the security fixes Microsoft made available, NTVDM could be turned on safely.\nLimitations.\nNTVDM and wowexec had limitations on Windows XP and later because of a GDI object limit per session, which might cause GDI handles to be moved two bits to the right when changing 32 to 16 bits. Handles thus could not be larger than 14 bits, so 16-bit programs with a GDI handle larger than 16384 would crash.\nOn x86-64 CPUs, virtual 8086 mode is only available as a legacy sub-mode (if running a 32-bit operating system), but not in 64-bit long mode, which is why NTVDM is not included with 64-bit versions of Windows, so 16-bit applications cannot be run on 64-bit Windows. You'll need Windows XP Mode or similar virtualization software to run 16-bit programs within a 64-bit operating system.\nNTVDM cannot run DOS games on computers of today. Emulation is only provided for simple peripherals. For example, sound in NTVDM can be limited. Windows NT only updates the screen a few times per second when DOS programs write on it, and they can't emulate high-resolution graphics options. As software runs at the speed of the CPU, all \"timing loops\" stop too early. This either makes games run too fast, or causes the software to not see some emulated hardware peripherals, because it can not wait that long for an answer."}

Recently, the ancient Imambara was taken down in 2004 to restructure and rebuild the shrine that stands today. The shrine is large enough to hold more than 32,000 visitors at a time.\nThere are different stories about the construction of the Imambara Zadibal, but the history says Tajik Shah donated the land of the zadibal to Mir Shamshud din Iraqi, who introduced Shia Islam to Kashmir and influenced the government officials of that time. \nThen the family of Mir Shamshud din Iraqi, whose mausoleum is only few feet away from the Imambara Zadibal, lived in the place. The fifth generation of his family built their private mosque and lived nearby well into the early twenty-first century. They set aside productive land to generate money for the upkeep of the mosque. They kept the rights of ownership to themselves but allowed their neighbors to pray there. \nIt became the main center of learning for the the followers of Ahlul bait. The elders of Markdar families would teach about religion. They also built a Hamam to use as a guest house for travelers coming from Baltistan and other distant areas. During time of Maharaja Ghulab Singh who wanted to keep all the centers under the control of his rule through his representatives (Jalalis) so that no one could revolt against him. Then a dispute broke out between Jalalis and Markdars. It went on for 150 years. \nAt the time of prime minister of Kashmir Bakshi Ghulam Mohammad, the Markdars donated the Imambara to the Shia public and later on its guardianship was taken by Shia Association. The Shia Association procured the land around the Imambara from the Markdars through several different deals, including language exchanges and cash payments. Recently, the Imambara was repaired by the late Molvi Iftikhar Hussein Ansari.\nArchitecture.\nInspired by the Persian style of architecture, Imambara Zadibal is a two-storey building. It is made out of oriental bricks. Its Maharaji bricks cover an area of over 75 square meters. This shrine has various sideways floor raisings called Gulam Gardish. There is a central ground level floor called Pokhr. It also has a large gallery with four gates.\nCurrently, the structure is under the supervision of All Jammu and Kashmir Shia Association, who maintain it. The structure that we see today is still undergoing construction work.\nCelebrations.\nShia Muslims are a minority in Kashmir. During the first 10 days of Muharram, Imambada Zadibal becomes a centre of mourning and religious gathering in Zadibal. Shia followers join in the mourning, usually ending in the festival of Ashura, when a large procession parades through the streets of Zadibal ending at Imambada Zadibal. Mourning continues from first day of Muharram to eighth of the Islamic month Rabi al Awwal, after which Eid al Zahra, also known as Eid e Shuja, is celebrated. This marks the end of the two-month mourning period.\nBuilding and destruction.\nImmabara Zadibal has been destroyed and rebuilt many times. From the period of Sultan Nazuk Shah by Mirza Douglat in 1548 AD to the reign of Maharaja Ranbir Singh in 1872 AD, this shine was burnt down around eleven times.\nAt the time Imambara Zadibal was constructed, it was a majestic building and people in the Kashmir Valley were proud of it. However, Mirza Hyder Kashgari Douglat set this shrine on fire in 1548 AD. Daulat Chak began rebuilding it in 1551.\nZafar Kupawari set Imambara Zadibal on fire for the second time in 1553. It was burned down again in 1653 by enemies of Ahlul Bayt during the reign of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan.\nIn 1682 AD, when Emperoro Aurangzeb Alamgir ruled, Imambara Zadibal was set on fire again. In 1719 AD, it was burned down for the fifth time during the Mukhtawi Khan clash. It caught fire for the sixth time in 1748 AD by enemies of Ahlul Bayt. They did so again in 1763. Imambara Zadibal caught fire again in June 1801, during Afghan rule in Kashmir, just before Ashura. \nIn July 1830, the shrine was the site of a massacre when Jammu and Kashmir were under Sikh rule. This same day, many Shias were cruelly murdered. This happened at Ali Park in Zadibal or Margibal.\nImambara Zadibal was rebuilt with financial help sent by a minister of Awadh's Sultan Nasr-ud-din. This grant was sent to Haji Baqir Khan Irani, who passed on the duty of rebuilding this structure to Hatim Mir.\nIn September 1872, the building was again set ablaze under the rule of Maharaja Ranbir Singh. He was a Dogra Ruler of J&amp;K. This time, the king gave considerable financial aid of about Rs. 3 lakhs to renovate the Imambara and restore it to its current prosperous condition. Every time the shrine went through fire, followers of Prophet Mohammad and Ahlul Bayt were only more convinced to make it whole again.\nLocation.\nReaching this shrine is easy because it is close to Srinagar Highway. The Imambara is in the middle of Zadibal, and it is near the Khushal Sar Lake and Hari Parbat Fort that most people call Qilla. The nearest railway station is the Srinagar railway station. It is an hour's ride away by car. Sheikh ul Alam International Airport is only a few kilometers from the Imambara. Taxi services are also available within the city of Srinagar."}

This was made to give software developers time to make their software 32-bit while people moved from Windows 3.1x to Windows 95, so the OS can be upgraded to a newer version while running most, or all of, a customer's 16-bit programs.\nWindows 9x operating systems, which were made on top of DOS, had both 16 and 32-bit systems, so if it kept those 16-bit parts, the OS could run 16-bit software without emulation. NT-based versions are very different in how they run, so they need a more sophisticated solution. There are two main techniques to let 16-bit programs run on 32-bit versions of Windows (with some limitations) called thunking and shimming.\nThunking.\nWOW \"thunks\" 16-bit instructions into 32-bit equivalents to permit 16-bit pointers, memory spaces, and address spaces.\n16-bit programs usually run in a single virtual DOS machine, sharing memory between them. However, they can be changed to run in a private, separate memory space, where every 16-bit process has a separate process. This can reduce system crashes by not letting programs interfere with others, but it can cause reduced 16-bit inter-process communication and can use more of your computer's memory.\nWOW is a part of 32-bit editions of Windows NT. 64-bit versions of Windows (including Windows Server 2008 R2 and later where they only have 64-bit versions) can not run 16-bit software without using different emulation software (for example, DOSBox).\nWOWEXEC.EXE on Windows NT allows WoW to work. Windows-on-Windows can, using the WIN.COM file, emulate the Windows 3.x (for NTVDM), Windows 95 and Windows 98 kernels, which can run 16-bit DOS-powered Windows applications on Windows NT.\nShimming.\nProblems with applications running on newer operating systems, especially with long filenames, multiple user accounts, and least privilege, may prohibit some applications from working correctly. For example, they might incorrectly think that they can write files to any part of the file system, but NTFS file permissions exist and does not allow this in many system folders. When Microsoft was building Windows 95, they had to ensure old programs still worked with 8.3 filenames to allow old applications to keep working properly. Since Windows 95, there was a feature where both a long and short file name are kept, so older applications could still use the 8.3 filenames.\nPrograms that try to access hardware directly can't do so. Old programs may also not work if they expect certain system configuration files from DOS and Windows 9x that are not used in Windows NT operating systems, so empty versions of files like AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS exist even though Windows NT does not use them.\nMany shims exist in the application compatibility layer of later versions of Windows to capture and change API calls from old applications made with different assumptions about the operating system in mind."}

It is a rectangle with a net across the middle. During a tennis match there can be both one player (single) or two players (double) on both half. The surface can be grass, clay or hardcourt.\nThe dimensions are set as the standard for lawn tennis by the International Tennis Federation and written down in the 'Rules of Tennis' document. The Tennis court is 78 feet (23.77 meters) long. Its width is 27 feet (8.23 meters) for singles matches and 36 feet (10.97 meters) for doubles matches. The service line is 21 feet (6.40 meters) from the net.\nSurfaces.\nClay Court is primarily made with stone, brick and crushed shale. The tennis ball on the clay court has the interesting feature of digging into the dirt. The clay court is the cheapest court to construct but is also is the court that requires the most maintenance. The water content should be balanced and the courts have to be rolled often to maintain flattened form. \nGrass Courts are the fastest courts. Before the open era most games were played in grass courts. Over time, the maintenance and cost have made it less popular. Grass courts are made by growing grass in hard packed soil. This can create many micro-variations in the surface type.\nCarpet Courts are rollable court surfaces. They are characterized by their low bounce and fast surface compared to hard courts. Carpet courts went out of fashion in the late 20th century and have been discontinued from the world tour.\nHard Courts are by far the most popular surfaces, primarily due to the one-time investment and minimum maintenance. The courts are made up of uniform rigid material, often covered with an acrylic surface layer to offer greater consistency of bounce than other outdoor surfaces. Hard courts generally vary in speed, being slower than grass courts but faster than clay."}

They grow to be around 4.9 m (16 ft 1 in). \nDescription.\nChokecherry classifies as a suckering shrub or a tree. They grow quite tall, around 1 - 6 meters. \nTheir leaves are oval with coarse, sharp edges. The flowers grow about 38.1\u201376.2 cm (15\u201330 in) long in late spring (well after chokecherry leaves appear). \nThe fruits are about 1 cm (3\u20448 in) across. They range in color from bright red to black. They have a very astringent taste, both somewhat sour and somewhat bitter. The fruits are sweetest when they are very ripe \"berries\" (actually drupes). These are dark in color.\nCharacteristics.\nChokecherries are very high in antioxidants, sharing this trait with chokeberries. This does contribute to confusion between the two. The wild chokeberry is often considered a weed, since it hosts the tent caterpillar. This caterpillar eats tree leaves, robbing trees of energy and heightening the chance that they die. Often people enjoy the cultivars of the plant, such as \"Canada Red\" and \"Schubert\". Both have purple leaves when mature and \"Goertz\", another cultivar, has a palatable taste in it's fruit. The chokecherry is closely related to the well-known black cherry of eastern North America. The name \"chokecherry\" is also used for the related Manchurian cherry, or Amur chokeberry.\nFood use.\nFor many Native American tribes, chokecherries are very important and are part of pemmican, an Indian staple food. The bark of the root is used to ward off or treat colds, fevers and stomach maladies by Indians. It's also used in a ceremonial smoking mix known as kinnikinnick. The chokecherry fruit can be eaten when fully ripe, but if not, the fruit contains a toxin. It can also be used to make jam or syrup, with the use of sugar. The Plains Indians pound up the whole fruit in a mortar, from which they make cakes.\nThe stone of the fruit is poisonous. Chokecherry is toxic to most animals with segmented stomachs, especially after the leaves have wilted. This action produces cyanide, which is very toxic to most living things. It also makes the plant sweet, making farmer's lives harder by keeping their cows away from it. However, birds and game animals eat the berries when they're ripe. It's also used to craft wine in the Western United States.\nEcology.\nThe plant does host many types of moths and butterflies. "}

It emits more energy as the frequency increases. By calculating the total amount of radiated energy, it can be shown that a blackbody would release an infinite amount of energy. This contradicted the principles of conservation of energy and showed a new model was needed for the behaviour of blackbodies. This happened around the end of the nineteenth century. It was one of the things that led to the invention of quantum mechanics.\nIt led theorists like Max Planck to come up with quantum theory in which energy leaves the body in distinct packets called quanta rather than in continuous waves. The quantum theory accurately predicted the energy of the radiation that is observed.\nRayleigh-Jeans formula predicts that the radiated intensity should increase as square of frequency. So energy density (intensity) would become infinitely large at the high frequency end of the spectrum, but experimentally observed that it approaches zero.\nThis divergence for higher frequencies is called ultraviolet catastrophe."}

The idea is that existing makes a good thing better than one that's only imaginary. So the perfect thing we're imagining must exist. Then we call the perfect thing God. The earliest objection was that an argument like that could prove wrong things. You could prove that a perfect island must exist, for example. But no real island is perfect.\nBecause it starts with imagination, not what you can see or experience, this is a kind of \"a priori\" reasoning. David Hume didn't like that way of thinking.

In gas operation, a portion of high-pressure gas from the cartridge being fired is used to power a mechanism to extract the spent case and insert a new cartridge into the chamber. Energy from the gas is harnessed through either a port in the barrel or a trap at the muzzle. This high-pressure gas impinges on a surface such as a piston head to provide motion for unlocking of the action, extraction of the spent case, ejection, cocking of the hammer or striker, chambering of a fresh cartridge, and locking of the action.\nDirect impingement.\nDirect impingement is a form of gas operation that does away with the piston completely. The bolt is designed in such a way so that the gas acts directly upon the bolt (hence the name) to cycle the action. "}

The symptoms of amyloidosis are accordingly highly variable and confirmation of the presence of amyloid in the tissues can be challenging, so that diagnosis is often delayed.\nThere are many different types of amyloidosis, each caused by formation of amyloid fibrils from different soluble precursor proteins in different patients. About 30 different proteins are known to form amyloid fibrils in humans and amyloidosis is named and classified according to the identity of the respective fibril protein. \nThough this disease being rare, many famous people have died from this disease such as: Martin McGuinness, David Lange, Robert Jordan and Robert P.

When the trigger is pulled the bolt goes forward, feeding a round from the magazine into the chamber and firing it. Like any other self-loading design without an external power supply, the action is cycled by the energy of the shot; this sends the bolt back to the rear, ejecting the empty cartridge case and preparing for the next shot (or continuing forward again, if the trigger is held down and the weapon is an automatic). Generally, an open-bolt firing cycle is used for fully automatic weapons and not for semi-automatic weapons (except some semi-automatic conversions of automatic designs).

It was originally a contender for a 5.56 mm Australian military service rifle to replace the then-issued Lithgow L1A1-F1 SLR and Colt M16A1 rifles. What was unique about this endeavor was that Australia had never designed or manufactured its own commercial gas-operated semi-automatic rifle. The rifle was abandoned when the Steyr AUG was adopted for use by the Australian military.\nOf interest to those that study weapons, designs and evolution, the T2 used a triangular bolt-face that was similar to the Winchester Model 100.

It is the busiest train station in the United States with over 600 thousand people using it every day, many of which are commuters travelling to and from work or school. The station is in Midtown Manhattan and is underneath Madison Square Garden, between Seventh Avenue and Eighth Avenue and between 31st Street and 34th Street.\nHistory.\nThe station was built by the Pennsylvania Railroad and is one of several stations in the U.S. with this name. Until the beginning of the 20th century, there were no trains that went directly into New York City from the west, because of the Hudson River in the way. People had to get off trains in Jersey City, New Jersey and take a ferry to cross the river and reach New York City.\nThis all changed when the Pennsylvania Railroad dug two tunnels under the Hudson River, and four under the East River to Queens. The tunnels and the new station in the heart of New York City were completed in 1910 at a cost of $114 million (which is about $2.7 billion today), and the first train ran in November of that year.\nOver the years, more railroad companies began to use Penn Station. During World War II, over 100 million people used the station every year. But as air travel began to rise and the Interstate Highway System was created, fewer and fewer people used the train. In 1963, the station was torn apart and a new one was built in its place, with Penn Plaza and Madison Square Garden built over it. The station reopened in 1968 and continues to be used today.\nLayout and services.\nPenn Station is completely underground, and all trains that run through it have to use electric power from either overhead lines or third rail because the station and the tunnels to it cannot handle exhaust from diesel fuel. There are 21 tracks that run through the station and 11 platforms. Up to 1,200 trains pass through the station every day.\nThe station is owned by Amtrak, which provides many trains to many cities across the U.S. They include long-distance services that go as far as Chicago, New Orleans, and Miami. From those cities, people can change for trains all the way to cities on the Pacific Coast like Seattle, Los Angeles, and San Diego. Amtrak also has high-speed trains (Acela Express) that go to Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C.\nThere are two commuter rail services that use Penn Station. One of them is the Long Island Rail Road operated by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), which goes to many places on Long Island to the east. The other is New Jersey Transit, which runs trains into New Jersey to the west. In the future, there are plans for Metro-North to serve this station as well. These trains currently use Grand Central Terminal a few blocks away, near 42nd Street and Park Avenue.\nBesides long-distance and commuter trains, the New York City Subway has a few stations that connect directly to Penn Station. These are located at 34th Street, Herald Square, and Hudson Yards. Another rapid transit system, PATH, has a station at 33rd Street where people can catch trains every few minutes to Jersey City and on to Newark. Many bus companies serve the station as well."}

The existence of stalemate is a main reason why draws are common in chess, but rare in the chess derivative shogi.\nIn the old Persian form of chess, shatranj, stalemate was a win for the side with the most pieces. The idea of stalemate as a draw in modern chess took a long time to be agreed. It was finally decided by the early 19th century British master J.H. Sarratt in the London Chess Club rules of 1807.\nFigurative uses in general.\nAll uses of the term \"stalemate\" in other contexts come from its use in chess. Stalemates in bargaining, politics and general life are examples of figurative language. The term is used as a metaphor."}

Geiger was born at Neustadt an der Haardt, Germany. He was one of five children born to the Indologist Wilhelm Ludwig Geiger, who was professor at the University of Erlangen.\nIn 1902, Geiger started studying physics and mathematics at the University of Erlangen and was awarded a doctorate in 1906. In 1907 he began work with Ernest Rutherford at the University of Manchester and in 1909, along with Ernest Marsden, conducted the famous Geiger\u2013Marsden experiment called the \"gold foil experiment\". Rutherford and Geiger created the Rutherford-Geiger tube, later to become the Geiger tube. \nIn 1911 Geiger and John Mitchell Nuttall discovered the Geiger\u2013Nuttall law (or rule) and performed experiments that led to Rutherford's atomic model. In 1928 Geiger and his student Walther M\u00fcller created an improved version of the Geiger tube, the Geiger\u2013M\u00fcller tube. Geiger also worked with James Chadwick. In 1912 he became leader of the Physical-Technical Reichsanstalt in Berlin, 1925 professor in Kiel, 1929 in T\u00fcbingen, and from 1936 in Berlin.\nHe was a member of the Uranium Club. Geiger never expressed himself in public about the Nazis. There are reports both about him helping, and rejecting, Jewish colleagues. Geiger died in Potsdam, Germany a few months after World War II ended in Europe. He had four siblings: three sisters and one brother that were all younger than him.

Her work with two other scientists influenced the discovery and creation of the atomic bomb.\nMeitner was of Jewish descent and converted to Lutheranism.\nStarting in 1907, Meitner worked with a man named Otto Hahn. She worked with Hahn throughout her entire career. Working together, they completed a lot of work in chemistry. Hahn won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, even though his work had been with her. The reason that she did not win the prize was that she was a woman. She did attend the ceremony though.\nIn 1914, Meitner volunteered as an X-ray technician in the Austrian army during World War I. Meitner was also the first female professor in Germany. She became a German professor in 1917. Throughout the 1920s, Meitner worked mostly on radiation. She won many prizes and awards. Around 1935, Meitner and Hahn worked together to learn more about uranium. The element Meitnerium is named after her.

After working with Hahn and investigating behavior of beta rays, she received an appointment in the radioactivity apartment and invited Meitner to join him. Soon after, Max Planck asked Meitner to be an assistant professor and lecture at the institute for theoretical physics. Meitner was the first woman in Germany to be in her position.

Wu Zhongyi, her father, participated in the 1911 revolution against the Chinese Manchu dynasty. He was the founder of an all girls\u2019 school in China. Educating girls wasn\u2019t seen as important at that time. Wu went to that school until she was nine. After that, she went to the Soochow Girls\u2019 School. She graduated in 1930. She was the best student in her class.\nStudies.\nWu went to college at Nanjing University. She studied physics there. She graduated in 1934. She spent one year teaching in a university. A year later, she went to study X-ray crystallography, which is the study of crystals. She did so at the National Academy of Sciences in Shanghai. A woman scientist who she worked with told her to go to study in the United States. She said this because China didn\u2019t have a very good physics program. With the help of her rich uncle, she sailed to America in 1936.\nWork.\nWu started working on nuclear physics with a particle physicist named Ernest Livermore. She helped Emilio Segre. He won a Nobel Prize years later. During the same time, Japan invaded China. She didn\u2019t hear from her family for years. She kept working.\nWu also studied the electromagnetic energy a particle gives off when it slows down. She also studied what happens when a uranium nucleus splits. For her work, she got a PhD in 1940. She became known as an expert on fission, which is the splitting of atoms.\nShe studied theories about atoms developed by Enrico Fermi. She ended up confirming one of his theories.\nWu continued with her work in physics in her later career. She faced a difficult hypothesis involving beta decay in 1963. Beta Decay was discovered by Richard Feynman and Murray Gell-Mann.\nDisproving Parity.\nChien-Shiung Wu helped overthrow the law of conservation of parity along with Tsung Dao Lee and Chen Wing Yang. For 30 years, parity was a universal law. The theory states that parity was when an event and its reflection were the same. Scientist believed that the conservation of parity applied to all events. Chien-Shiung Wu helped to disprove this theory. She found this when studying the electrons at a low temperature. Wu did most of the work. The Nobel Prize committee did not acknowledge her. They did recognize her two male partners who won the award.\nAchievements.\nMany considered Wu's work on Fermi\u2019s theory worthy of a Nobel prize. Her work was important but did not qualify for the prize. The two scientist she worked with on the theory about parity won a prize and she did not. People believed her work was not original.\nShe became the first woman to be the president of the American Physical Society. She was the first woman to receive the Comstock Award from the National Academy of Sciences. She was also the first woman to receive the Research Corporation Award. She received honorary degrees from over a dozen universities. Yale, Princeton and Harvard were some of the universities that recognized her work. Princeton gave her an honorary doctorate of science. She became the first woman to ever receive that.\nPersonal life.\nWu married Luke Yuan in 1942. She taught at Smith College in Massachusetts. After that, she taught at Princeton. In 1944, she was recruited to do top-secret work on radiation detectors for the atomic bomb project called the Manhattan Project at Columbia University. She worked in a secret facility.\nAfter World War II, Wu heard back from her family. They had all survived.\nWu retired in 1981. She died of a stroke on February 16, 1997, in New York. She was 86 years old. Her ashes were buried in the courtyard of her father's school.\nWu was an inspiration and a trailblazer. She didn\u2019t let racism or sexism put her down. She kept working hard. She made some amazing discoveries. Her work wasn\u2019t credited with a Nobel Prize but she made a huge impact on the world's knowledge of fission and quantum physics."}

This makes dark matter invisible. Rubin joined the council of American Women in Science in 1984 to promote women in astronomy. \nRubin was given honorary degrees from Creighton University, Harvard University, and Yale University. She won the National Medal of Sciences in 1993.\nLater years.\nRubin was married to Robert Rubin, a physicist. She wrote a children's book on astronomy to encourage young girls to study science. Rubin had four children named David, Allan, Judith, and Carl. Her children all became scientists. \nRubin died in Princeton on December 25, 2016."}

She wrote a number of books about mathematics.\nSynesius of Cyrene was a student of Hypatia. His letters provided some of the most important information on her life and her teachings. She taught Synesius about the building of an astrolabe.\nHypatia was never married because she said she was \u201cwedded to the truth\u201d. She was an acquaintance of Orestes. He was the pagan governor of Alexandria. Radical monks murdered her. They possibly murdered her because the pagans seemed to have caused enmity among the mainly Christian town. They persecuted her, and scattered her body parts around the city. She died at 45 years old, in 415 C.E."}

She stayed as Weizmann Institute for the rest of her career.\nWork.\nAda Yonath is an Israeli chemist who made pictures of ribosomes using X-ray Crystallography. Ribosomes are the part of cells in the human body that put together proteins. X-ray Crystallography makes pictures of molecules by bunching them into crystals. This method is only used to make models of single atoms. Yonath used this methods to crystallize ribosomes although they are made of many atoms and proteins. This made her work very difficult. She returned to the Weizmann Institute of Science in 1970. She started the first Protein Crystallography lab in Israel. She did research at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics in Berlin, Germany from 1979 to 1984. She began trying to make ribosomes into crystals in 1970. \u00a0[1]\nAccomplishments.\nShe made the first model of a large ribosome in 1980. \nIn 2006 she won the Wolf Prize in Chemistry.\nShe won the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz. This Nobel prize was for her work in making images of ribosomes.

It is now called the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences.\nWork and Discoveries.\nIn 1969, China was having a cultural revolution against Western ideas. This means that many schools, colleges, and research centers were closed. Tu was assigned to a secret project that was to find the cure for Malaria during this time. Malaria was killing American and Vietnamese soldiers in Vietnam before the treatment was found. She studied traditional Chinese medicinal ancient text. She was trying to find an herbal treatment. The text they read gave information about a medicinal plant, Qinghao. Qinghao is also known as sweet wormwood. Tu and two other scientists found a part of the plant that helped treat Malaria. This was made into a drug that stopped and treated the disease in millions of people. This drug was called artemisinin."}

She was also famous for supporting more education for women and supporting more civil rights for women. \nEarly life.\nSomerville was born on December 26, 1780, in Jedburgh, Scotland. She was the fifth of seven children. She was one of three who lived to be adults. Her father, William George Fairfax, was a vice-admiral in the Royal Navy. He would go on long trips away. Somerville's mother didn't try to educate her daughters; she thought that all girls needed to know was how to cook and clean. When Somerville wasn't doing household chores, she would often go to the seaside and the moors.\nWhen Somerville's father came home, he discovered that his ten-year-old daughter could not read or write. He sent her to a boarding school. By her teenage years, Somerville had become interested in algebra. Her parents got angry. They told her not to study it - they worried that studying mathematical concepts would cause her physical and mental harm. \"Mary Somerville.\" Scientists: Their Lives and Works, UXL, 2006. Student Resources in Context. Accessed 31 Mar. 2017.\nMarriage and adult life.\nIn 1804, when she was 24, Somerville got married to Samuel Grieg. She found that marriage gave her independence from her parents. She began studying algebra. She had two sons, but her husband died in 1807. As a widow, she found more freedom to study and learned many more mathematical concepts.\"Mary Somerville.\" Scientists: Their Lives and Works, UXL, 2006. Student Resources in Context. Accessed 31 Mar. 2017.\nIn 1812, she married again. Her second husband was William Somerville. They had four children together. Somerville began experiments on solar radiation with her newfound support from William.\nWork.\nShe studied the sun's radiation effects on Earth's substances. In 1826, she published her first paper, \"On the Magnetizing Power of the More Refrangible Solar Rays.\" She later published two more papers and two books. She later moved to Italy and started her third book. In 1848, she had a publication called \"Physical Geography.\"\nHonors and awards.\nSomerville wrote many books. Somerville's second book led to the discovery of Neptune. She then became the one of the first two women to be named Honorary members of the Royal Astronomical Society. Somerville had a picture hung in the Royal Society's great hall. She won the Victoria Gold Medal from the Royal Geographic Society in 1870. \nLate life.\nIn 1860, her only surviving son died. Her husband died 5 years later. Somerville became sad. Her daughter told her to work on more writing projects. She did, but she wasn't in touch with modern science. She began to promote civil rights and higher women's education. She died at age 92 in Naples, Italy, on November 19, 1872. Oxford University named one of its colleges after her."}

The museum started officially on 27 March 1998 at \u2018Het Polenplein\u2019, in the earlier fire-station.\nHistory.\nThe Cycling Museum was founded in 1985 as part of the earlier Municipal Museum of Roeselare. The city of Roeselare took that decision because the region can be seen as \u2018the cradle of the flandriens\u2019. A lot of flandriens and racing cyclists are born in the region. The municipality proper has known a lot of popular racing cyclists for example Odiel Defraeye, the first Belgian winner of the Tour of France and several world-champions: Jean-Pierre Monser\u00e9, Benoni Beheyt, Patrick Sercu, Freddy Maertens\u2026 In the beginning, the museum only showed a few old bicycles and organised an exhibition in summer.\nIn 1998, they made the final decision to replace the old folkloristic museum for a real Cycling Museum, the National Cycling Museum. Ferdy Callewaert was the first conservator till he retired in 2006. Old-racing cyclist Freddy Maertens worked from 2000 till 2007 at the museum and he welcomed often the visitors. In 2005 King Albert II visited the museum. In 2010 the museum got the short name \u2018WieMu\u2019. \nAfter a renovation, the museum re-opened on 8 September 2018. The new name of the museum is \"KOERS. Museum van de wielersport\". At the museum, there are also the municipal touristic service and a pub. \nCollection.\nThe museum shows the history of bicycles from 1760 till now: all sorts of old bicycles and modern bicycles used for professional duties, leisure and sport. In the beginning, that was the heart of the collection of the cycling museum. After some years, the museum became more and more specialized in cycle-racing. So the museum has a lot of racing-bicycles, cycling-trophies and -souvenirs, cycling-clothes, portraits of racing cyclists etc. \nIn one of the halls, you find a lot about the local world-champion Jean-Pierre Monser\u00e9, who lost his life as world-champion during a race in 1971. Another hall shows an old workshop of bicycle-maker Hallaert where you can learn about the technical evolution of the bicycle.\nThe cycling museum has a documentationcentre about cycling with a lot of photos, old newspapers and (cycling-)magazines, programme brochures and cycling archives. The museum publishes regular exhibition catalogues or books of exercises. Since 2012 the museum publishes the cycling-historic magazine \u2018Etappe\u2019.\nBuilding.\nThe museum \u2018WieMu\u2019 is in the earlier fire-station. The station was built between 1899 and 1902. Till 1962 it was a fire-station. During World War I, German soldiers lived in the station. On 21 July 1917, it was bombed by British aircrafts. After the war it was rebuilt. The building was also used for several public services such as a festive hall, a school, sportaccommodation and a folkloristic museum. The building is now a classified monument and partly restored."}

Based off the epic poem, it stars Ray Winstone, Anthony Hopkins, Robin Wright, Brendan Gleeson, Crispin Glover, Angelina Jolie, John Malkovich and Alison Lohman. It was directed by Robert Zemeckis and released on November 16 2007, to financial success and positive critical reviews.\nPlot.\nIn the early Middle Ages, the court of King Hrothgar of Denmark (Anthony Hopkins), is plagued by the monster Grendel (Crispin Glover), who attacks the king's people when they celebrate. Hearing of the king's plight, the warrior Beowulf (Ray Winstone), travels to the kingdom with a band of his fellow Geatish warriors, including his friend Wiglaf (Brendan Gleeson), to slay the beast. When they arrive, Beowulf falls in love with the king's wife Queen Wealthow (Robin Wright), who reciprocates his affections.\nThe warriors celebrate in the king's mead hall Heorot in an attempt to lure Grendel out. When the monster attacks, Beowulf fights him nude and unarmed (it is revealed that he is invulnerable to man-made weapons). In the fight, Beowulf discovers Grendel has hypersensitive hearing, which is why he attacks Hrothgar's celebrations (the noise from the mead hall is painful to him). After his left eardrum is ruptured, Grendel shrinks in size and, while trying to escape, Beowulf restrains him and uses the door of the hall to sever the monster's arm. To thank him for defeating the monster, Hrothgar gives Beowulf his golden drinking horn, which commemorates his victory over the dragon Fafnir.\nGrendel retreats to his cave and with his final breaths, he tells his mother (Angelina Jolie), what has happened to him and she swears revenge. She travels to Heorot and butchers Beowulf's soldiers while they sleep. Hrothgar informs Beowulf and Wiglaf, who were not sleeping in the hall when the attack took place, that this was the work of Grendel's mother; she is the last surviving member of the Water Demons, long thought to have left the land forever. The two travel to Grendel's cave to slay her. When Beowulf encounters her, she takes on the form of a beautiful young woman. She promises to make him the greatest king who has ever lived, in exchange for the drinking horn and a son who will replace Grendel.\nBeowulf agrees to the deal and returns to Heorot, claiming that she has been slain by him. Hrothgar, however, realizes the truth and indirectly tells Beowulf that many years before, he was seduced by Grendel's mother, and Grendel was the product of their affair. Beowulf is then crowned King of the Danes, much to the dismay of Unferth (John Malkovich), Hrothgar's adviser. The king kills himself by jumping off the castle and on to the beach. His body is then washed away by the sea.\nThe years go by, and Beowulf and Wealthow are married. They have grown apart over the years and are husband and wife in name alone. Beowulf has taken a lover called Ursula (Alison Lohman), but is sterile after his affair with Grendel's mother. One day, Unferth's slave Cain finds the golden drinking horn in Grendel's lair and brings it back to the kingdom. That night, a dragon decimates a nearby town, but Unferth is spared to deliver a message to Beowulf; the beast is his illegitimate son with Grendel's mother. Removing the drinking horn has voided their agreement and Grendel's mother has sent the dragon to destroy his father's kingdom."}

Severe tulip breaking virus can cause lighter colors to appear on tulips, whereas mild tulip breaking virus tends to cause darker colors to appear.\nEffects of the virus.\n\"Tulip breaking virus\" infects the bulb of the tulip or lily and changes the color of the petals. This change depends on the strain of the virus, the type of plant and the age of the plant when it gets infected. \"Tulip breaking virus\" causes differences in the pigments in the flowers, which in turn changes the colors. \nIn lilies, it takes two weeks after infection to see a change in petal color and then changes the shape of the leaves and flowers.\nIn all forms, the virus harms the bulb and makes it more difficult for the plant to sprout again year after year. Eventually, the bulb is unable to flower again, which is why rare color broken bulbs from the past are no longer in existence.\nHistory.\n\"Tulip breaking virus\" used to be considered the earliest recorded virus, but now it is considered the second earliest, virus-induced leaf chlorosis being the first in 752 AD. \nThe first time \"tulip breaking virus\" was described was in 1576 by Carolus Clusius, a Flemish professor of botany. He called it \"rectification\" because he believed that the color changes were the plant trying to purify or \"rectify\" itself. Clusius also noticed the harm done to the bulb by the virus, but did not know that a virus was causing it. In fact, it took until a decade after World War I for scientists to figure out that a plant virus was the culprit for the color changes. This was considered quite late because plant viruses themselves were known to scientists since 1897. \nBefore it was known that a virus caused the color changes, it was thought that environmental factors, such as soil, fertilizer or bulb storage, or chronic disorders were to blame. \nPathogen discovery.\nThe virus was discovered by Dorothy Cayley at the John Innes Horticultural Institution in Norfolk, England. She experimented by transferring parts of an infected bulb to a non-infected bulb and seeing if it remained a solid color, or became \"broken\" in color. She concluded that even transferring minute amounts lead to infection in a healthy bulb.\nThe virus was then proven to be transferred by at least four species of aphids. The virus is picked up and lives in the aphid's mouths and is then transferred to another plant when the aphid feeds.\nIn the 1960s it was finally proven that \"tulip breaking virus\" was indeed a virus, and today its genetic code has been partially sequenced. \nDistribution.\nIt is very difficult to control the spread of \"tulip breaking virus\". It is found world-wide and is very common in southern Europe because of the abundant aphid population. Aphid transmission causes millions of dollars of damage, but mineral oils and pyrethroids are used to combat the pests. \nAfter an experiment was done looking at populations of aphids and time of year, it was concluded that \"tulip breaking virus\" transmission starts in April, even though the majority of aphids were not found until May.\nThe United States, Great Britain and other countries do not allow the sale of infected bulbs, in order to restrict the virus. \nBroken tulips today.\nMost tulips today are bred to have stripes, rather than being infected. However, many tulip enthusiasts dislike the bred tulips and prefer the virus infected plants. There are only a few truly \"broken\" older plants, alive today only because the virus has not completely stunted the growth. An example of this is \"Absalon\" from 1780 which has gold flames against a dark brown background.\nCurrently, optical sensors are used to detect \"tulip breaking virus\". Recent research looked at the different types of optical sensors and concluded that spectral cameras may be the best type for specifically finding \"tulip breaking virus\", however it was only a bit more accurate than an expert's visual assessment. Other types of optical sensors considered in the experiment were color cameras, but they were not as effective as spectral cameras nor visual assessment by experts."}

He ruled over the region to the north of the river Kaveri River.The ancient Chola kingdom once famous in Tamil literature and in the writings of Greek merchants and geographers faded into darkness after c. 300 CE. Cholas during this period almost completely disappeared from their native land. They seem to have held on to their old capital city of Urayur. This 'dark' age of Tamil history came to an end with the ascendency of the Pandyas and the Pallavas. The Cholas had to wait for another three centuries until the accession of Vijayalaya in the second quarter of the ninth century to re-establish their dynasty.\nAt the time of 848 CE, there was a struggle or war between the Pallavas and Pandyas. Vijayalaya Chola used this as his own oppurtunity. He captured the Thanjavur region from Elango Mutharaiyars . In this disturbed state of affairs, Vijayalaya defeated the Pandyas, and made himself the ruler of Thanjavur and the surrounding Chola country. He also defeated the Pallavas. After Vijayalaya\u2019s capture of Thanjavur, the Pandyan king Varagunavarman II (c. 862 \u2013 885 CE) made alliance with the Pallava king Nandivarman III (c. 846 \u2013 869 CE). Nandhivarman wished to destroy the growing influence of Chola power under Vijayalaya and called upon the Varagunavarman to help suppress Vijayalaya. Varaguna led an expedition into the Chola country. The Pandyan army reached the north bank of the Kaveri near Thanjavur. Vijayalaya, by this time was aging and was an invalid. The crown prince Aditya I took control of the army in the defence of the Chola kingdom. Vijayalaya was succeeded after his death c. 871 CE by his son Aditya I.\nThe Tiruvalangadu plates state that Vijayalaya captured the city of Tanjavur and made it his capital and that he also built in it a temple to the goddess Nisumbhasudani (Durga). The Kanyakumari inscription states that he developed the city of Tanjore.Vijayalaya took the title of Parakesarivarman. Chola kings succeeding him took the titles of Parakesari and Rajakesari in turns. This is probably to acknowledge their ancestors Parakesari and Rajakesari.Narttamalai, Pudukkottai has a solesvara temple attributed to Vijayalaya."}

Swatantra (\"Freedom\") stood for a market-based economy.The party was thus favoured by some traders and industrialists, but at the state-level its leadership was dominated by the traditional wealthy classes such as \"zamindars\" (landlords) and formerly princely states. Its membership was not restricted on the basis of religion, unlike the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Jana Sangh. In 1960, Rajagopalachari and his colleagues drafted a 21-point manifesto detailing why Swatantra Party had to be formed, even though they were formerly Congressmen and associates of Nehru during the struggle for independence. The Prime Minister was highly critical of Swatantra, dubbing the party as belonging to \"the middle ages of lords, castles and zamindars.\nIn the 1962 general election, the first after its formation, Swatantra received 6.8 percent of the total votes and won 18 seats in the third Lok Sabha (1962\u201367).

In a heteronormative system, there are two strict genders, men and women, and everyone must behave according to their gender role in society. A heteronormative view of the world believes that a person's sex decides their sexuality, gender identity and gender roles.\nHomophobia, transphobia, and heterosexism could not exist without heteronormativity.\nAccording to queer theory, societies force heteronormativity on people it does not fit, such as LGBT people, queer people, and intersex people.\nWhere the word comes from.\nMichael Warner made the word \"heteronormativity\" popular in 1991 in one of the first books on queer theory. It came from Gayle Rubin's idea of the \"sex/gender system\" and Adrienne Rich's idea of \"compulsory heterosexuality.\" According to Samuel A. Chambers, heteronormativity shows what societies expect, demand, and allow when they consider relations between men and women to be the only normal ones.\nDiscrimination.\nPeople who argue against heteronormativity include Cathy J. Cohen, Michael Warner, and Lauren Berlant. They argue that it holds down those who do not fit it, marks them as outsiders, keeps them out of society, and makes it hard for them to express themselves. Heteronormative policies and institutions strengthen the belief that people are heterosexual and that there are only two genders and sexes by nature. They argue that heteronormative culture gives an unfair advantage to heterosexual people (this is called heterosexism). It causes members of society to keep LGBT people out of work, school, and the greater society, sometimes using the law.\nAgainst gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people.\nAccording to the cultural anthropologist Gayle Rubin, heteronormativity ranks sexual practices from \"good sex\" to \"bad sex.\" This \"sex hierarchy\" ranks sex between two married heterosexual people for the purpose of creating a child as \"good,\" and ranks people and acts that fall short of this standard lower until they become \"bad sex.\" Gay couples who are married are somewhere in the middle. Gay people who have sex with many partners are also in the middle, but below gay married couples. Patrick McCreery, a lecturer at New York University, believes this is the reason why gay people are attacked for doing things that straight people also do, such as watching pornography or practicing BDSM.\nMcCreery says that this \"sex hierarchy\" also exists in the workplace. Gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people are more likely to be kept out of work the lower they fall. Transgender people fall especially low in the hierarchy and face the most obvious discrimination. This leaves many LGBT people without jobs. People can be fired for being LGBT, or they can never be offered a job for the same reason. In 1991 the restaurant Cracker Barrel in the United States made the news when it fired a lesbian worker. There was no law against this, and there is still no law against it in most of the country.\nAgainst intersex people.\nIntersex babies can be born with neither a penis nor a vagina. Doctors and parents often force intersex children to have surgery to make them look more like most men and women. Usually they are healthy without this and it is not necessary. Most intersex children are not allowed to decide if they want this surgery. This is not because there is anything wrong with their bodies. Rather, parents are often afraid that their children will be judged. In other words, doctors and parents force them to have surgery for social reasons, not biological ones."}

Heterosexism is not just something a single person can believe but is taught by society and culture. Heterosexist beliefs can cause people to act unfairly towards people who are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or asexual.\nHeterosexism is related to homophobia and biphobia in the same way that sexism is related to misogyny and transphobia."}

This was at Amritsar, Punjab, India. Sixteen people were killed.\nThis incident eventually led to Operation Blue Star and the Punjab insurgency in the 1980s. Clashes occurred when Akhand Kirtani Jatha and Damdami Taksal members led by Fauja Singh protested against and tried to stop a convention of Sant Nirankari Mission followers. This incident is considered to be a starting point in the events leading to Operation Blue Star and the 1980s insurgency in Punjab. \nThe turning point in the Sikh-Nirankari relationship is believed to have come after Avtar Singh took over as the sect chief in 1943. He not only proclaimed himself \u201cSatguru\u201d but also introduced a book \u201cAvtar Bani\u201d and allegedly tried to copy Sikh symbols like starting the system of Sat Piare etc. He was successful in organising Nirankaris into a powerful sect. However, in his book \u201cA History of The Sikhs\u201d, Khushwant Singh noted that the fundamental difference between both was that the Nirankaris were worshiping gurus other than the 10 recognised by the Sikhs.\nHowever, the conflict reached its peak on April 13, 1978. Activists of the Akhand Kirtni Jatha and Damdai Taksal marched towards the venue of a Nirankari convention in Amritsar. It led to a clash that left at least 17 dead and a majority of them were Sikhs.\nFollowing the deadly clash in 1978, Akal Takht issued a hukamnama asking Sikhs to sever ties with Nirankari Sikhs. Later in 1980 in Delhi, Akhand Kirtani Jatha\u2019s Ranjit Singh killed Nirankari chief Gurbachan Singh. Ranjit Singh was later nominated as Akal Takht Jathedar."}

Its creator was Suzette Haden Elgin. She believed that Western languages were better for saying what men think than what women think. She created the language to make it easier for women to say what they think. For example, L\u00e1adan has many words and suffixes for saying how you feel about what you are saying. It also includes words for saying if you know that what you are saying is true, and if so, how.\nThe language became part of a series of science fiction books, Native Tongue. In the book, a group of women create L\u00e1adan as a way to fight a society ruled by men.\nSounds.\nTones.\nL\u00e1adan is a tonal language. Some syllables are said in a higher voice or tone than others. There are two tones:\nL\u00e1adan itself is a three-syllable word, LA-a-dan, where the first syllable is said in a high tone.\nVowels.\nL\u00e1adan has five vowels:\nConsonants.\nL\u00e1adan does not have the consonants p, t, k, g, or s. The consonants b, d, sh, m, n, l, r, w, y, and h are the same as in English. There is also:\nRules.\nMost L\u00e1adan sentences have three short words called particles:\nIn L\u00e1adan, the verbs come first. Verbs are the same words as adjectives. There are no articles like an or the. The object of a verb has the suffix -(e)th. It usually comes after the subject. The prefix me- says that the subject of a verb is plural. The word \"ra\" means the same thing as English \"not\".\nMaking new words.\nNew L\u00e1adan words are made by adding prefixes and suffixes to old words. Each part of a word stays the same when it combines with other parts. Because of this, it is called an agglutinative language. The affixes (prefixes and suffixes) can be used to show feelings and attitudes. Many languages can only show these by tone of voice, body language, or roundabout speech.\nPronouns.\nPronouns in L\u00e1adan are made of many parts. The letter \"l\" is used for I and we. The letter \"n\" is used for you. The letter \"b\" is used for he, she, it, and they.\nThe vowel \"e\" usually comes after these letters. \"a\" can come after them instead to show that someone is loved. If the person is hated, \"lhe-\" can be put before the word.\nThe suffix \"-zh\" makes a pronoun plural but less than four. \"-n\" makes it plural and greater than four. So \"lazh\" means \"we, who are few and loved.\" \"Lheben\" means \"they, who are many and who I hate.\""}

He was known for his work in the field of kidney transplants, and in research, discoveries, and inventions in Renal Science. In 1961, He performed the first successful Kidney transplant between humans who were not identical twins. He was also a member of a team of researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, who developed a device that can preserve kidneys for up to 50 hours from the time they are taken from a person's body. It is now used in hospitals and research labs around the world.\nEarly life and career.\nSamuel Lee Kountz first became interested in medicine at the age of eight, when he went with an injured friend to a local hospital for emergency treatment. He says he was so moved by the way the doctors' helped his friend, that he decided from that moment to become a doctor. During his senior year of high school, Kountz had met Senator J. William Fulbright, who had once been president of the University of Arkansas. The senator was so impressed by Kountz's energy and enthusiasm, that he urged him to consider the medical school at the University of Arkansas, Little Rock. Kountz applied but was turned down. He spent the next two years finishing up his graduate work in chemistry at the university's Fayetteville campus. He did so well that he was awarded a full medical scholarship, and in 1954 became the first black student to be admitted to the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.Kountz completed a master's degree in chemistry in 1956; two years later he received his M.D. He spent the next year as an intern with the Stanford Service of San Francisco General Hospital. In 1959, he began his surgical training at the Stanford University School of Medicine. It was at Stanford that he studied in organ transplants, and decided to make transplant surgery his life's work. In 1976 Kountz performed a kidney transplant on live television, The Today Show and inspired some 20,000 viewers to offer their kidneys to patients who needed them. In 1972 Kountz had been appointed Professor of Surgery and Chairman of the Department at the State University of New York's Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, New York. He also served as Surgeon-in-Chief of Kings County Hospital. The University of Arkansas awarded him the honorary Juris Doctor in 1973. Doctor Kountz also developed the largest kidney transplant research and training program in the country at the University of California, San Francisco.\nIllness and death.\nDoctor Kountz contracted a brain disease while on a speaking tour in South Africa that left him bedridden and unable to talk or care for himself. His illness was never diagnosed, and he died on December 23, 1981, at the age of 51. At the time of his death, he had personally performed some 500 kidney transplants, the most performed by any physician in the world at that time."}

His facial features have not yet fully complete and he still retains an orifice-like mouth rather than normal human-like features seen in later forms.\u00a0The two sections of his head go off in a V-shape. Cell has orange color parts near his abdominal area, the back of his head, and even near the area where gentials would be found. He has two wings which are both green with black spots.He has three fingers in the manga, but five fingers and three toes (just as similar as Frieza and King Cold) in the anime. He has a tail like Frieza and King Cold, but also has a stinger on the end of it. He has black sections as well near his abdominal area, in the middle between the two sections on his head, and even the black part of the opposite side of his tail.

His tail is longer and slightly thicker than before, and comes from his back, as well as becoming orange and black. His voice is deeper than his first form.

His lips are now the color pink, and the black sections above his lips look like a mustache (but it's part of his skin). He now has light blue eyes in this form (a result of absorbing Android 17). He even has boot-like feet in this form and metal-like plates all around both of his ankles. He has the same shape of ears as Frieza's, except that his have an orange line that goes down to the chin and to both sides of the ears. His wings retreat completely into his back.\u00a0In his self-destruction form, Semi-Perfect Cell bloats himself, his belly greatly expanding in size. He also claimed that his bloated appearance was unstable, and that a single touch may set him off when dissuading Gohan from trying to stop him.\nIn his \"Perfect\" form, Cell becomes much more humanoid and more intelligent, complete with both a fully-formed nose and mouth. His tail is retracted and now used to create Cell Jr's. He is also smaller than in his previous form.

His skin is now pale all in his face, neck and hands, he now has purple lines in both sides of his cheeks, similar to Frieza in his first three forms, and the orange line across his ears and chin is now changed into a yellow color.

He is best known for his work to overturn racial segregation in the United States in the 1950s and early 1960s. He was a World War II veteran. He became a field secretary for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). After the 1954 ruling of the United States Supreme Court in \"Brown v. Board of Education\" that segregated public schools were unconstitutional, Evers worked to get African Americans admitted to the all-white University of Mississippi. He also worked for other changes in the nation's then-segregated society, such as voting rights and registration, economic opportunity, and access to public facilities for African Americans.\nEvers was assassinated by Byron De La Beckwith, a member of the \u201cWhite Citizens' Council, a group formed in 1954 to resist integration of schools and civil rights activity in America. His murder and the resulting trials led to many civil rights protests. An all-white jury failed to convict De La Beckwith in his first two trials. He was finally convicted, however, 30 years later in a new state trial in 1994 that was based on new evidence. Evers\u2019 wife Myrlie Evers, later became a noted activist in her own right, serving as national chair of the NAACP. His brother Charles Evers became the first African-American mayor elected in the state of Mississippi in 1969 in Fayette, Mississippi. \nEarly life and Career.\nEvers was the third of the five children born to Jesse (Wright) and James Evers. The family included his father Jesse's two children from a previous marriage. The Evers family owned a small farm, and his father also worked at a sawmill. Evers walked twelve miles to attend segregated schools, and earned his high school diploma. Evers served in the United States Army during World War II from 1943 to 1945. He fought in the Battle of Normandy in June 1944. After the end of the war, Evers was honorably discharged as a sergeant.\nIn 1948, Evers enrolled at Alcorn College, now Alcorn State University majoring in business administration. He also competed on the debate, football, and track teams, sang in the choir, and was junior class president. He earned his Bachelor of Arts in 1952. He married classmate Myrlie Beasley in 1951 while they were still in college. Together they had three children: Darrell Kenyatta, Reena Denise, and James Van Dyke Evers.The couple moved to Mound Bayou, Mississippi, a town that was founded by African Americans. There Evers became a salesman for T. R. M. Howard's Magnolia Mutual Life Insurance Company. In 1954, Evers applied to the segregated University of Mississippi Law School as a test case for the NAACP, but his application was rejected because of his race. In late 1954, Evers was named the NAACP's first field secretary for Mississippi. In this position, he helped organize boycotts and set up new local chapters of the NAACP. He was involved with James Meredith's efforts to enroll in the University of Mississippi in the early 1960s. Evers also helped Dr. Gilbert Mason, Sr., organize the Biloxi, Mississippi wade-ins, protests against segregation of public beaches on the Mississippi Gulf Coast.\nEvers' civil rights work and leadership made him a target of white supremacists. His public investigations into the 1955 lynching of teenager Emmett Till had made him a prominent black leader. On May 28, 1963, a Molotov cocktail was thrown into the carport of his home. \nDeath.\nOn June 12, 1963, Evers pulled into his driveway after returning from a meeting with NAACP lawyers. As he was getting out of his car he was shot in the back and the bullet passed through his heart. He was taken to a hospital in Jackson, Mississippi where he was first refused entry because of his race. After his family explained who he was, the hospital went on and admitted him. He died in the hospital about 50 minutes later.As a veteran, Evers was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery. \nOther websites.\n \n "}

The Thebans had reluctantly accepted this, as well as their compulsory membership in the League of Corinth, which had been previously imposed by\u00a0Phillip II of Macedon, Alexander's father.\nThe expedition against Persia had been long in the works, and Alexander did not make it a secret that he planned to avenge the attacks on Greece by Persia a century and a half before, despite that at the time his kingdom had been a Persian vassal state. It was as a result of this planned expedition that King\u00a0Darius III\u00a0started to distribute money to the Greek city-states with the hope that they would rise against their new Hegemon. In addition to this, he had sent his most able general\u00a0Memnon of Rhodes\u00a0against the Macedonian troops that were already stationed in\u00a0Ionia\u00a0at this time.\nIn addition to this, news of Alexander had not reached the southern Greek city states for some time. He had been busy with the\u00a0siege of Pelium\u00a0and a rumour had reached them that he had died during the course of this siege.\u00a0Demosthenes\u00a0- a prominent Athenian politician - produced a man who claimed to have been present at the siege and claimed that Alexander was dead. Alexander had, indeed, been injured during this siege, so it was not a totally implausible claim to make.\nUpon learning of the alleged death of Alexander, Theban exiles in Athens raced off to their native city in\u00a0Boeotia\u00a0and sought to incite a revolt from Macedonian rule there. The Cadmaea, the citadel that was situated upon a hill in Thebes, was occupied by a Macedonian garrison, and it was this place that the Thebans sought to attack. To this effect, they killed two Macedonian officers who had been roaming the city, and declared their independence from Macedonia."}

Electricity makes the flat surface hot. A hot iron is rubbed on clothes to make them flat and smooth. This is called ironing. The handle does not get hot because that is where it is held. They are named clothes irons because they used to be made out of the metal iron.\nCloth is made from lots of small strings. When people wear clothes or move other things made from cloth, the little strings might bend and make lumps. Because the iron is heavy and hot when it is turned on, the little strings stretch and go flat when the iron is put on top. Different kinds of cloth need to be ironed in different ways. If the iron is too hot then the cloth might get broken or burn. If the iron is too cold then the strings might stay lumpy and not go flat. Sometimes people use water with an iron, which makes steam. This can make it easier to iron clothes because the small strings get soft. Some cloth does not need to be ironed because the strings always stays flat.\nNo one can agree why people iron clothes. Some people think wearing clothes that have been ironed shows they are not lazy. Other people think that not ironing clothes can make them look nicer."}

Kennedy and the assassination of U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. The then-78-year-old Seigenthaler, who was a friend of Robert Kennedy, described the Wikipedia article about him as \"Internet character assassination\".\nThe author of the hoax article was later identified as Brian Chase. On May 26, 2005, Chase added a new article that contained, in its entirety, the following text:\nJohn Seigenthaler Sr. was the assistant to Attorney General Robert Kennedy in the early 1960s. For a short time, he was thought to have been directly involved in the Kennedy assassinations of both John, and his brother, Bobby. Nothing was ever proven.\nJohn Seigenthaler moved to the Soviet Union in 1972, and returned to the United States in 1984.\nHe started one of the country's largest public relations firms shortly thereafter.\nThe hoax was not discovered and corrected until September of that year. Afterwards, Seigenthaler wrote about his experience in \"USA Today\". The incident raised questions about the reliability of Wikipedia and other websites with user-generated content that lack the legal accountability of traditional newspapers and published materials. \nAftermath.\nIn a December 13 interview, co-founder Jimmy Wales expressed his support for Wikipedia policy allowing articles to be edited by anonymous users \u2013 describing the participation of editors in China and Iran in terms of privacy issues \u2013 but announced plans to roll back their article creation privileges as part of a vandalism-control strategy: \"...we've decided that we want to slow down...so starting in January we're preventing unregistered users from creating new pages, because so often those have to be deleted...\"."}

He became the King Zheng of Qin () when he was thirteen, then China's first emperor when he was 38 after the Qin had ruled all of the other Warring States and unified all of China in 221 BC.\nEarly life.\nThe First Emperor's father Yiren was the grandson (son of the son) of Ze, the ruler of Qin. The rulers of Qin and Zhao were from the same family, but the two lands fought against one another frequently. They wanted to make peace. King Ze gave his grandson Yiren to the leaders of Zhao so that, if Qin started to fight Zhao, the ruler of Zhao would kill Yiren and his family. Because King Ze would not want that, the ruler of Zhao was able to have less fear that Qin would fight him. (He also sent people from his family as prisoners to Qin so that things were even.)\nWhile Yiren was a prisoner in Zhao, he met a trader named L\u00fc Buwei. L\u00fc knew that, when King Ze went to death, Yiren's father Lord Anguo would be the leader of Qin. L\u00fc also knew that Yiren had many brothers but Yiren's father loved a woman who had no son. L\u00fc worked hard to make that woman adopt Yiren (take him up as her son); Yiren even changed his name to Zichu (\"son of Chu\") because his new \"mother\" was from a land named Chu. L\u00fc's design turned out well: he and Zichu secretly went out from Zhao and, when Ze and Lord Anguo died, Zichu got to be the ruler of Qin.\nThe ruler of Zhao was angry but Zheng's mother hid. He was not able to kill her or her son. Zheng's mother had been the girlfriend of L\u00fc Buwei, but L\u00fc gave her to Yiren when he fell in love with her. Sima Qian was not certain that Zheng was the son of Zichu and not the son of L\u00fc Buwei, but most people thought that he was the son of Zichu, ruler of Qin. When Zichu died, Zheng got to be the new ruler of Qin. Because he was still very young when this took place, his mother and L\u00fc Buwei were the true rulers.\nTime of ruling.\nLater, Zheng was older and put L\u00fc Buwei and his mother's new boyfriend to death. He put his mother away as a prisoner as well. Now, Zheng and his helper Li Si ruled Qin. Their ideas are called Legalism. It said that the old ways of doing things were not good: if everyone did as ordered by the ruler and by his laws, things would be much better. The best way to run a country was for the ruler to have all the power. That way, no one would be able to fight or hurt other people. As the ruler of Qin, Zheng liked these ideas; as the ruler of China, he said they would be the only ideas. He made Confucianism and other old ideas against the law. Only the library in his palace (great house) was able to have books with any old ideas or with other people's accounts of history. Everyone else would have to read about Legalism and the accounts of history approved by the Emperor. The First Emperor's men then burned the other books and even killed some of the men who tried to keep them by burying them (putting them under the earth).\nAs the ruler of China, the First Emperor ordered great undertakings: his men put together earlier bits into a Great Wall of China and made a new river\u2014the Lingqu Canal\u2014so that boats were able to go from the Yangtze River in the middle of China to the Pearl River in the south. He ordered a large number of new roads and a tomb (last resting place) for himself the size of a city. This resting place was looked after by the thousands of statues of the Terracotta Army. Many people did not like doing as the First Emperor ordered: Sima Qian wrote about three men who made attempts to kill the First Emperor. All three came to nothing.\nDeath.\nThe First Emperor did not want to die. He went to Shandong and Jiangsu to look for people who would be able to make him live forever. No one was able to do that, but some people think that Xu Fu's journeys to look for Mount Penglai were important for Japan. This was about the time Japan's early J\u014dmon stage ended and its Yayoi stage started. The Yayoi time was the start of farming and the start of large countries in Japan. The First Emperor died in 210\u00a0 BC.\nThe First Emperor had many sons, but his helpers Li Si and Zhao Gao tricked the one he liked into killing himself. That way, a younger son became the Second Emperor and Li Si and Zhao Gao was able to be the true rulers for a while. The time when the First Emperor's family ruled China is named the Qin Dynasty, but it was very short. After the Qin, there was fighting that accidentally burned all the old books placed in the First Emperor's library. Then, there was more fighting before Liu Bei came out on top and got to be the new ruler of China. His family was named the Han Dynasty."}

It was in an area of operations more local and major partisan formations, and in 1943/1944, and headquarters support unit of the Supreme Headquarters of the NLA. In fact, before the second session of AVNOJ in Jajce (1943), here he was Supreme Partisan Headquarters, led by Josip Broz Tito. Tito himself was placed under Petrovo Polje, in the village of Kova\u010devi\u0107i, home reputable host Husein Kova\u010devi\u0107, councilors of the local People's Committee \u0160iprage (Committee Chairman: Ismet Had\u017eiselimovi\u0107).\nTo Petrovo Polje partisans have built a military airport with charged ground surface. The village is situated on the slopes of Petrovo Polje, in the valley of Vrbanja river , below the plateau Petrovo Pulje. Some sources stated that Tito at that time lived \"in a small village below Petrovo Polje\".\nThere have been prepared and (fire) marked areas for aviation supply of medical support and weaponry allies and goings of their delegates. So at this place, before the second session of AVNOJ, in Jajce (1943) the (by parachutes) and hung the English mission in connection with the NLA, headed by Major William Deakin.\nIn early 1944, on April 24, the Chetniks attacked the partisan units and their hospital Cor, following the departure of \u0160iprage. They therefore focused on three impact areas: \nOver Imljani hired less power, because between them and Kori\u0107anske stijene is a deep gorge of the river gorge Ilomska.\nThe majority of Chetnik Force in the field headed by Petrovo Polje and Lisina Mountain. By winning the dominant areas Lisina, would open the quickest way to advance (via Ilomska) to the Hospital.\nOver Imljani and Petrovo Polje attacked the Chetniks from Manja\u010da (the Chetnik detachments \"Ko\u010di\u0107\", \"King Petar II Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107\") and detachment \"Obili\u0107\" of Lazo Te\u0161anovi\u0107. Over Petrovo Polje, according to Lisina, performed famous Chetnik Rade Radi\u0107 and combined power Chetnik's Battalion \"Karadjordje\" and \"Tankosi\u0107\", under the command of Mihajlo \u0110uri\u0107 . The entire campaign was commanded Chetnik \"commander of the operation\", Major Slavoljub Vranje\u0161evi\u0107 .\nAt the same time, the first battalion of partisan detachments in Kori\u0107ani and three battalions of the 1st Krajina Brigade went to get some food in Pougarje, on the other side of the canyon of the Ugar. So the defense Hospitals could only organized the 2nd Battalion detachment and one battalion of 14. Centralbosnian Stroke Brigade. Since all were exhausted typhus, hospital was in great danger. That is why the headquarters detachment dispatched couriers to seek his 1st Battalion, which was more numerous. These forces is to be defended part of the front of the river, a left tributary Ilomska to its pouring in Ugar. The rest of the front, to the north, defended the fighters detachment, with the help of troops from Jajce, with the task of defending the line at all costs, because the penetration of the Chetniks in Kori\u0107ani was fatal for the hospital and for units that defend it. Second Battalion detachment had the most about 120 fighters healthy and able to fight. Coincidentally, he had, will prove decisive weapon : 12 machine guns and heavy machine gun brand \"Breda\".\nWhen, from the direction of Petrovo Polje, from hot springs Bijeljine, Chetniks went to Lisina partisans fired a machine-gun burst, which made them develop their forces along Ilomska, the front length of about three kilometers. It is much easier for a planned action of partisans, because the Chetniks were forced to due precautions, ineffective fire while approaching through the dense forest.\nIn a dramatic showdown on Lisina partisans, thanks to the efficiency of the machine gunners, avoid taking the tactically important positions. They literally mowed Chetniks in storming the slopes of the mountain to the Ravni Omar, causing him a key and final defeat on this ground."}

The Dayton Peace Accords were started on November 22, 1995 by the presidents of Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia, on behalf of Serbia and the Bosnian Serb Republic. The actual signing happened in Paris on December 14, 1995. The peace accords contained a General Framework Agreement and eleven supporting annexes with maps. The accords had three major goals: ending of hostilities, authorization of military and civilian program going into effect, and the establishment of a central Bosnian government while excluding individuals that serve sentences or under indictment by the International War Crimes Tribunals from taking part in the running of the government. IFOR's specific role was to implement the military Annexes of \"The General Framework Agreement for Peace (GFAP) in Bosnia and Herzegovina\".\nIFOR relieved the UN peacekeeping force UNPROFOR, which had originally arrived in 1992, and the transfer of authority was discussed in Security Council Resolution 1031. Almost 60,000 NATO soldiers in addition to forces from non-NATO nations were deployed to Bosnia. Operation Decisive Endeavor (SACEUR OPLAN 40105), beginning 6 December 1995, was a subcomponent of Joint Endeavor.\nThe Dayton Agreement resulted from a long series of events. Notably, the failures of EU-led peace plans, the August 1995 Croat Operation Storm and its aftermath, the Bosnian Serb atrocities, in particular the Srebrenica massacre, and the seizure of UNPROFOR peace-keepers as human shields against NATO's Operation Deliberate Force.\nAdmiral Leighton W. Smith, Jr. (Commander in Chief Allied Forces Southern Europe (CINCSOUTH)) acted as the Joint Force Commander for the operation (also known as \"Commander IFOR\" (COMIFOR)). He commanded the operation from HQs in Zagreb and later from March 1996 from the Residency in Sarajevo. Lt Gen Michael Walker, Commander Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC) acted as the Land Component Commander for the Operation, commanding from HQ ARRC (Forward) based initially in Kiseljak and from late January 1996 from HQ ARRC (Main) Ilid\u017ea. This was NATO's first ever out-of-area land deployment. The Land Component's part of the operation was known as Operation Firm Endeavour.\nAt its height, IFOR involved troops from 32 countries and numbered some 54,000 soldiers in-country (BiH) and around 80,000 involved soldiers in total (with support and reserve troops stationed in Croatia, Hungary, Germany, and Italy and also on ships in the Adriatic Sea). In the initial phases of the operation, much of the initial composition of IFOR consisted of units which had been part of UNPROFOR but remained in place and simply replaced their United Nations insignia with IFOR insignia."}

Its name is got because it is strong and durable. Ironstone was developed in the 19th century by potters in Staffordshire. It sold well as a cheaper alternative to porcelain.\nIronstone in Britain's Staffordshire potteries was made by Charles James Mason after his patent of 1813. The name \"ironstone\" later became generally used. The strength of Mason's ironstone enabled the company to produce ornamental objects of large size. Their vestibule vaseswere 1.5 metres high. Mantelpieces were made from several large sections. Mason's tableware was widely used in hotels and restaurants as well as private homes. It was usual for commercial clients to have the name of their establishment transfer printed onto the stoneware. \nMason's was not the only manufacturer. Another high-class pottery was Spode, who made ironstone from 1805 onwards. They had big exports to France, where ironstone was often preferred to faience pottery.\nDuring the mid-19th century The United states was the largest export market for Staffordshire's potteries.

It is also used to make buffer solutions in biochemistry. Factories use it as a fire retardant, and to kill fungi that can harm the human body. It is also used in fiberglass, as a flux in metallurgy, slime, and as an insecticide. When mixed with water, it helps the soap clean dishes or clothes better. It can take the smell and stain off bathroom and kitchen surfaces. It also takes the smell out of shoes.\nMaria Telkes used borax in the first solar-powered home, invented in 1948.

{"id": "581707", "revid": "6487798", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=581707", "title": "Ramjet", "text": "A ramjet is a type of engine which uses the properties of air to create thrust. Ramjets are most often attached to aircraft, and require that the aircraft is moving above the speed of sound, also called Mach 1. They are different from \"normal\" aircraft engines because they do not have any moving parts which compress the air. Instead, they use shock waves to compress the air.\nParts of a Ramjet.\nRamjets are made up of 4 main sections.\nInlet.\nThe first section is called the inlet. The purpose of the inlet is to capture air and compress it. Compression is required in order to burn the fuel correctly. The compression comes from a process called a shock wave. Shock waves only occur when the aircraft is moving at or above Mach 1. For this reason, ramjets are more efficient if moving around Mach 2 or 3. \nDiffuser.\nThe second part of the ramjet is called the diffuser. Air that comes through the inlet is moving very fast, which makes it very hard to burn fuel. The job of the diffuser is to slow the flow down in an efficient way. By the time the air has passed all the way through the inlet, it is traveling slower than Mach 1. This is important for the diffuser to work properly. The diffuser is essentially just a pipe that increases in area as you move along it. Because the flow moving slower than Mach 1, the increasing area causes the air to slow down.\nCombustion chamber.\nThe third part of the ramjet is the combustor, also called the combustion chamber. The combustor is where the fuel is introduced to the air, and then burns. Burning fuel adds energy to the air, which will be later used to create thrust. The air must be moving relatively slowly for the combustor to work properly. There is a part inside the combustor called the flame holder. The flame holder, as the name suggests, holds the flame in place. A typical flame holder looks like a ring of small v-shaped pieces of metal. They create little pockets of slow air, which make it easier for the fuel to keep burning.\nNozzle.\nAfter the fuel is burned and the air is heated, it flows through the last part, the nozzle. The purpose of the nozzle is to turn all of the energy in the air into thrust. In order to do this, the nozzle must first get smaller then get larger. The smallest area of the nozzle is called the \"throat\". The air coming from the combustor is moving slower than Mach 1, so as the nozzle gets smaller, the air speeds up. The nozzle is designed so that once the air reaches the throat, it has sped all the way up to Mach 1. This is an important detail for the nozzle to work properly. Once the air passes the throat, the air gets larger again. Since the flow reached Mach 1 in the throat, increasing the area also increases the speed of the air. This is the key to creating thrust. The air exiting the nozzle essentially \"pushes\" the ramjet forward."}

Humiliated, he took his father and locked him in a tower. While attempting to escape, the wizard made a serpent wrap itself around his son's arm. A witch persuaded Eliaures, who was a magician, to make the snake attach itself to Caradoc's arm, sucking his blood. His friend Cador saved his life by putting his sister Guimer in a vat of milk and Caradoc in a vat of sour wine. This got the snake to cross from one vat to the other, giving Cador the chance to kill it with his sword. The attack caused Caradoc\u2019s arm to \u201cshrivel away\u201d, and he became known as Breifbras (little-arm). Later in life he married Guignier.

Specific heat is the thermodynamic property, which states the amount of heat required for a single unit of mass of a substance to be raised by one degree of temperature. Varying ranges of specific heat values are seen for substances depending on the extent to which they absorb heat. The term heat capacity can be misleading since heat \"q\" is the term given to the addition or removal of energy, across a barrier to a substance or system, as a result of increasing or decreasing the temperature respectively. Temperature changes are really changes in energy. Therefore, specific heat and other forms of heat capacity are more accurately measures of the capacity of a substance to absorb energy as the temperature of the substance increases.\nUnits.\nUnits are very important for expressing any thermodynamic property; the same is true for specific heat. Energy in the form of heat is expressed in Joules (J) or kilojoules (kJ) which are the most common units associated with energy. One unit of mass is measured in grams or kilograms with regard to specific heat. Per one gram is the standard form used in tables of specific heat values, but references using one kilogram are sometimes seen. One degree of temperature is measured on either the Celsius or Kelvin scale, but usually Celsius. The most commonly associated units then for specific heat are J/(g\u2022\u00b0C).\nFactors that determine specific heat.\nTemperature and pressure.\nTwo factors that change the specific heat of a material are pressure and temperature. Specific heat is defined at a standard, constant pressure (usually atmospheric pressure) for materials and is generally reported at 25\u00a0\u00b0C (298.15 K). A standard temperature is used because specific heat has temperature dependence and can change at different temperature values. Specific heat is referred to as an ) As long as the temperature and pressure are at the standard referenced values and no phase change occurs, the value for the specific heat of any material remains constant regardless of the mass of the material present . \nEnergetic degrees of freedom.\nA large factor in the magnitude of the specific heat of a material lies at the molecular level in the energetic available to the material in the phase (solid, liquid or gas) in which it is found. Energetic degrees of freedom are of four types: translation, rotation, vibration and electronic. A minimum amount of energy is needed to reach each degree of freedom. Therefore, the amount of energy that can be stored in a substance depends on the type and number of the energetic degrees of freedom that contribute to the substance at a given temperature. Liquids generally have more low energy modes and more energetic degrees of freedom than solids and most gases. This broader range of possibilities within the degrees of freedom typically generates larger specific heats for liquid substances than for solids or gases. This trend can be seen in the and by comparing liquid water to solid water (ice), copper, tin, oxygen, and graphite.\nUsage.\nSpecific heat is used to calculate the amount of heat absorbed when energy is added to a material or substance through an increase in temperature over a defined range. Calculation of the amount of heat or energy added to a material is a relatively easy process as long as the initial and the final temperatures of the material are recorded, the mass of the material is reported and the specific heat is known. The specific heat, the mass of the material and the temperature scale must all be in the same units in order to accurately perform the calculation for heat.\nThe equation for calculating heat (\"q\") is as follows:\nIn the equation, s is the specific heat in (J/g\u2022\u00b0C). m is the mass of the substance in grams. \u0394\"T refers to the change in temperature (\u00b0C) observed in the substance. The convention is to subtract the initial temperature of the material from the final temperature after heating so \u0394\"T is TFinal-TInitial in the equation. Substituting all the values into the equation and multiplying through cancels the units of mass and temperature leaving the appropriate units of Joules for heat. Calculations such as this are useful in "}

It was announced at the company's Worldwide Developers Conference on June 5, 2017, and released on September 19, 2017.\nSome of iOS 11's changes: the lock screen and Notification Center are combined, allowing all notifications to be displayed directly on the lock screen. The various pages of the Control Center are unified, gaining custom settings and the ability to 3D Touch icons for more options. The App Store receives a big visual change to focus on editorial content and daily highlights. A \"Files\" file manager app allows direct access to files stored locally and in cloud services. Siri can now translate between languages and use a privacy-minded \"on-device learning\" technique to better understand a user's interests and offer suggestions. The camera has new settings for better portrait-mode photos and will use new encoding technologies to reduce file sizes on newer devices. In a future release, Messages will be used with iCloud to better synchronize messages across iOS and macOS devices. A previous point release also added support for person-to-person Apple Pay payments. The operating system also introduces the ability to record the screen, limited forms of drag-and-drop functionality, and support for augmented reality. Certain new features will appear only on iPad, including an always-accessible application dock, cross-app drag-and-drop, and a new user interface to show multiple apps at once.\niOS 11 received mixed reviews. People significantly praised the application dock and new multitasking interface on the iPad, crediting them for renewing the user experience. Further praise was directed at the redesigned Control Center offering customizable toggles, though it was criticized for lack of third-party app support, lack of Wi-Fi network selection ability and for difficult usage on small screen sizes, along with its instability. People also noted the new augmented reality development tools, but said their impact would depend on third-party apps and how fast developers embraced them. Praise was also directed at the App Store's redesign and the new file-management tools. Shortly after release, it was discovered that disabling Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connections through the Control Center does not disable the respective chips in the device in order to remain functional for background connectivity, a design decision sparking criticism for \"misleading\" users and reducing security due to potential vulnerabilities in inactive open connections. The iOS 11.2 update added warning messages and a new toggle color to explain the new functions. iOS 11 has also received continuous criticism from reviewers and end-users for its perceived stability and performance issues, particularly on older devices; Apple has issued numerous software updates to address such issues. \nTwo months after release, 52% of iOS devices were running iOS 11, a slower adoption rate than previous iOS versions. The number increased to 81% of devices by May 2018.\nOn June 4, 2018, at the Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple announced its successor, iOS 12.\nChanges.\nMessages.\nThe user now has the option of downloading applications from a app store in Messages."}

It was first invented by an Austrian physician in 1881. They now come in different shapes and sizes. They can be found in many places.\nThe sphygmomanometer works by wrapping a tube of fabric (called a \"cuff\") around the arm or other body part. The cuff is filled up with air. That stops the flow of blood in the arm. The air is then released slowly until the blood\u00a0flows again. The whole process, from start to finish, only takes about a minute.\nMany sphygmomanometers are inflated by squeezing a bulb. A gauge shows how much the cuff is inflated. The gauge can be mechanical or hydraulic (filled with mercury). It is important that the cuff is not inflated too much, so whoever is using the device has to use a\u00a0stethoscope. \nSome sphygmomanometers, especially those that people use at home, are automatic. They inflate using an electric pump. They show the blood pressure on a screen. They are meant to be very easy to use."}

This effect occurs because of a side effect of the quantum uncertainty principle, where 'virtual' particles cause the plates to be slightly pushed towards each other.\nRelationship to quantum uncertainty principle.\nThe quantum uncertainty principle says that particles, fields, etc. have two values, and that the more accurately you measure one, the less accurately you can measure the other. Since 'empty' space (which is a field) would be completely empty, then we would know both the field's magnitude (which is zero) and its rate of change (also zero). Therefore, there must be tiny fluctuations in 'empty' space, so that the uncertainty principle isn't violated. These take the form of virtual particles, which we wouldn't be able to detect directly. However, we can see the effects they have on real particles. Some of these particles are virtual photons, which can also be considered as waves. Now, between the reflective metal plates, there is a certain distance. Certain virtual photons, specifically ones where the distance divided by the wavelength is a whole number, are the only ones that can fit in here; if it isn't a whole number, eventually the peaks and troughs of the waves will coincide, and cancel it out.\nNegative spacetime.\nSince there are fewer virtual particles on the inside of the plates rather than the outside, there is a greater force on the outside of the plates. This causes the plates to be pushed inwards. Now, the energy density of the universe is zero. This is because every particle has positive energy, but it also has gravity, which balances it out with negative gravitational energy. Since there are fewer virtual particles within the plates, that means that the energy density of the spacetime between the plates must be less than the energy density of spacetime outside the plates. However, since the energy density of the spacetime outside the plates is zero, that means that the energy density of the spacetime between the plates is less than zero, or negative. Negative spacetime has odd properties, such as being saddle-shaped and allowing travel into the past."}

Its speed and ease of operation give instant information about the thermodynamic characteristics that play an important role in understanding complex processes during the formation of substances; for instance, polymer cross-linking, heat exchange due to folding and unfolding of proteins or formation mechanism of single or double stranded DNA. The DSC was firstly invented in 1962 by E.S. Watson and M.J. O\u2019Neil and made available to the market in 1963 at the \"Analytical Chemistry and Applied Spectroscopy\" conference held in Pittsburgh.\nPhysical Structure.\nThe two most common types of differential scanning calorimeter, are \"heat flux DSC\", which operates by keeping the heat supply to the system as constant and \"power-compensated DSC\", which works by maintaining the power supplied to the calorimeter as constant. In general, a DSC calculates heat changes by measuring the temperature difference between the sample and reference holder. The typical design of the \"heat flux DSC\" can be seen from Figure 1. It contains the \"sample holder\", where the material of interest is placed, and the \"reference holder\", which is generally kept empty. Both of these are placed on a \"support\", which is in good contact with the \"walls\" of calorimeter. The \"heating resistor\" is attached to the boundary walls that enables one to obtain a furnace generating and keeping the required heat amount inside the enclosure. The \"thermocouple\" connected to both sample and reference holder is a measuring device that gives the temperature to be used in the analysis. Heat supplied by the \"heating resistor\" flows further into the sample and the reference materials chambers.\nTheory.\nThe simplest theoretical approach to understand the working mechanism of DSC\u2019s is called the simplified \"linear model\" and makes use of the following assumptions:\nThe Fourier\u2019s law of heat conduction, which is the fundamental law explaining how the heat is transferred through materials can be used to see the relationship between the temperature and the heat flow in the system. This law states that the amount of heat energy passing through a small portion of an area (A) of a material, which is called heat flux density and denoted by formula_1 is equivalent to thermal conductivity (k) multiplied by the change in the temperature with respect to position, which can be denoted as formula_2. This relationship in an equation form can be written as,\nformula_3\nGenerally, in DSC a computer is used to supply heat at specific rate into both the reference and sample holders. When the sample holder contains a substance while the reference kept empty leads to either increase or decrease in temperature of sample holder denoted by formula_4 depending on the following processes: \nThen, the resulting change in the heat flow due to these temperature variations can be found by using the Fourier's law as the following,\nformula_5\nor\nformula_6\nHence, based on this simple model it turns out that there is a direct proportionality(K) between the heat flow and the temperature variations of the sample. This proportionality constant is dependent on the distance from the wall to the sample shown as (\u0394x), the cross section area of the support (A) and the thermal conductivity (k). Generally, the main results of the DSC experiment is an output signal of heat flow rate as a function of temperature, which are called DSC curves . Analysis of these curves plays an important role in determination of heat of transformation, heat of reactions or any changes in heat capacity due to temperature variations, for instance, the enthalpy of exothermic and endothermic processes can be determined by finding the area under the DSC curve using a mathematical technique called integral calculus.\nApplications.\nThermal denaturation of proteins.\nOne of the most important applications of DCS is related to the thermal unfolding of the proteins, a process called denaturation.The DCS\u2019s role in this process is used to determine the temperature range over which proteins exhibit structural changes. In addition to that, when the protein solution is treated under constant heat rate and constant pressure, DSC can determine apparent heat capacities of the proteins. In fact, the denatured proteins turn out to have higher heat capacities and proper detection of changes on them over time can help to find out the extent of unfolding.\nEvaluation of lipids and fats.\nFood quality control is one of the most important issues for human health care and well-being. There has been reported many unlawful practices with regard to food products, specifically adulteration of some highly priced vegetable oils and fats. Adulteration is an action of mixing low quality and sometimes harmful ingredients with food products intended to be sold. In this field, DSC is used to analyze the thermal behaviour of lipids mainly by two processes, the cooling process, which reports information about the crystallisation and the heating process, which gives information on the melting behaviour of the building blocks of lipids. The adulteration in fats or oils changes the DSC cooling and heating curves. For example, new peaks appear and existing peaks undergo changes. Hence, analysis of DSC data can be used in estimation of adulteration process on nutrients.\nDrug purity.\nDSC has gained quite a lot interest in drug purity investigation because it requires samples with low quantity (1\u20132\u00a0mg) and is considerably fast in terms of analysis time. For instance, by monitoring the effects of foreign substances, it can be found to what extent a drug is pure. It turns out that impurities decrease the melting temperature formula_7 of the drug. In addition, melting temperature can also be used to estimate the thermal stability of drugs, because the higher the formula_7 the more stable is the protein. Therefore, DSC allows instant monitoring of this temperature leading to much easier and faster way of controlling the drug quality."}

This energy is released in the form of heat, when the substance is burned in standard conditions. \nChemistry.\nHeat of combustion (\"\u0394\"H\"\u00b0c\") is the measure of the amount of energy released in the form of heat (\"q\") when one mole of a substance is burned (combustion). The production of heat means the reaction is an exothermic process and gives off energy. Heat of combustion is a specialized form of reaction enthalpy because it is measured at standard conditions and is limited to one mole starting material. The (\u00b0) symbol shows that the heat of combustion value is obtained at standard conditions: 25 degrees Celsius (298.15 Kelvin) and at a constant pressure. The pressure is reported both at either one bar or at one atmosphere depending on the source. \nHeat of combustion is also called the enthalpy of combustion because the energy evolved from the combustion reaction results from the change in the overall enthalpy of the starting substance as it reacts completely with oxygen. The terms heat of combustion and enthalpy of combustion are used interchangeably due to the First law of thermodynamics and the relationships between heat at constant pressure (\"q\"P), the change in internal energy (\u0394U), and the change in enthalpy (\u0394H). \nThe equation for the change in internal energy is\n\u0394\"U\" = \"qP - \"P\u0394V. \nIf the equation is rearranged, then\nqP = \u0394\"U\" + \"P\"\u0394\"V\".\nThe equation for the change in enthalpy is\n\u0394\"H\" = \u0394\"U\" + \"P\"\u0394\"V\" + \"V\"\u0394\"P\". \nThe term V\"\u0394\"P cancels because there is no change in pressure so\n\u0394\"H\" = \u0394\"U\" + \"P\"\u0394\"V\".\nAs previously stated,\nqP = \u0394\"U\" + \"P\"\u0394\"V\".\nTherefore, qP = \u0394\"H\".\nHeat of combustion measurements are most common for the combustion of organic hydrocarbons, compounds composed of carbon and hydrogen, but can include other atoms found in organic compounds such as nitrogen, phosphorous, sulfur and especially oxygen. Heat of combustion values are most widely used for determining if a substance is an effective fuel source. Many organic compounds can be found in Heat of Combustion Tables\nThe units for heat of combustion can be varied, but are always reported as a unit of energy per mole or per unit of mass or volume depending on the method used to report the values. To evaluate the efficiency of a substance as a fuel, energy per unit of mass or volume is more convenient. \nAs with all combustions and many oxidation reactions, oxygen must be present in order for the substance to combust. Combustion reactions are carried out with oxygen at constant pressure in a calorimeter. A representative combustion reaction is that of methane (CH4) in the presence of oxygen\nCH4(g) + O2(g) \u2192 CO2 + H2O(l)\nThe products of a combustion reaction are water and carbon dioxide gas as long as the reactants are oxygen and hydrocarbons. The water product can be in the form of gas or liquid depending on the temperature post-combustion. A true heat of combustion determination has liquid water at the end of the reaction due to the fact that the experiment is returned to the standard temperature of 25\u00b0C at which water condenses into liquid."}

It is long and allows marine vessels to go from the Atlantic Ocean to all of the Great Lakes. Most of it is in Canada, but a small part of it is in the United States. It gets its name from the Saint Lawrence River, the river which goes from Lake Ontario to the Gulf of Saint Lawrence.\nBefore the Seaway was built, there was no way for boats and ships to get around the rapids and dams on the Saint Lawrence River. Big ships could not pass Niagara Falls, the waterfalls on the Niagara River between Lake Ontario and Lake Erie. In the early 20th century, the governments of both Canada and the U.S. saw that the cities near the Great Lakes could grow and become an important part of the economy of both countries. There were people in both countries who did not want the Seaway to be built, but the project went ahead.\nIn 1954, construction began on a system of canals from Montreal in the east to Port Colborne in the west. It included 15 locks where the water level changes, and several places where electricity could be made from the flow of water. The project also involved making the Welland Canal bigger so that large ships can pass through it.\nThe Seaway was completed in 1959 at a cost of C$470 million. Today, thousands of vessels use it every year, from small recreational boats to huge ocean liners. About 40 to 50 million tonnes of cargo are moved on these ships and they go to all parts of the world including Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. It has been an important part of the economic growth of cities like Toronto, Hamilton, Buffalo, Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee, and Chicago. There are plans to make the Seaway even wider so that container ships as big as those that travel through the Panama Canal can use it."}
