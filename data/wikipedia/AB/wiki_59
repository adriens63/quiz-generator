The Jitsi project started with Jitsi Desktop (previously known as SIP Communicator). With the growth of WebRTC, the Jitsi team decided to focus on Jitsi Videobridge for doing web-based video calling for multiple people. Later the team added Jitsi Meet, a full video conferencing application that includes web, Android, and iOS clients. Jitsi also operates meet.jit.si, a version of Jitsi Meet hosted by Jitsi for free to be used by the community. Other projects are: Jigasi, lib-jitsi-meet, Jidesha, and Jitsi.\nJitsi is supportefd by various institutions such as the NLnet Foundation, the University of Strasbourg and the Region of Alsace and it has participated multiple times on Google Summer of Code program.\nHistory.\nWork on Jitsi (then SIP Communicator) started in 2003as a student project by Emil Ivov at the University of Strasbourg. It was released as an example video phone in the JAIN-SIP stack and later became an independent project.\nIn 2009, Emil Ivov founded the BlueJimp company which has employed some of Jitsi's main contributors in order to offer professional support and development services related to the project.\nIn 2011, after successfully adding support for audio and video communication over XMPP's Jingle extensions, the project was renamed to Jitsi since it was no longer \"a SIP only Communicator\". This name originates from the Bulgarian \"\u0436\u0438\u0446\u0438\" (wires).\nJitsi introduced the Videobridge in 2013 to support video calling with multiple people using a new Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) architecture. Later that year initial support was added to the JitsiVideobridge allowing WebRTC calling from the browser. To demonstrate how JitsiVideobridge could be used as a production service, BlueJimp offered a free use of its hosted system at meet.jit.si.\nOn November 4, 2014, \"Jitsi + Ostel\" scored 6 out of 7 points on the Electronic Frontier Foundation's secure messaging scorecard. They lost a point because there has not been a recent independent code check by people outside jitsi .\nOn February 1, 2015, Hristo Terezov, Ingo Bauersachs and the rest of the team released version 2.6 from their stand at the Free and Open Source Software Developers' European Meeting 2015 event in Brussels. This release includes security fixes, removes support of the deprecated MSN protocol, along with SSLv3 in XMPP. Among other improvements, the OS X version has aa Java 8 runtime inside, enables echo cancelling by default, and uses the CoreAudio subsystem. The Linux build fixes font issues with the GTK+ native LookAndFeel, and fixes someissues about microphone volume level on call starting when using the PulseAudio sound system. A full list of changes is available on the project web site.\nAtlassian bought BlueJimp on April 5, 2015. After that, the new Jitsi team under Atlassian stopped important new development work on the Jitsi Desktop project and expanded its efforts on projects related to the Jitsi Videobridge and Jitsi Meet. Regular contributions from the open source community have maintained the Jitsi Desktop project. Jitsi is fully funded by 8x8.\nPrimary projects of Jitsi.\nThe Jitsi open source repository on GitHub currently contains 103 repositories. The major projects include:\nJitsi Meet.\nJitsi Meet is an open source JavaScript WebRTC application and can be used for videoconferencing. One can share presentations and with just a link can invite new members for videoconference. It can be used by downloading the app or directly in a browser and is compatible with any recent browser. Every user can use Jitsi.org servers or can download and install the server software on a Linux-based machine.\nKey features of Jitsi Meet"}

This frog lives in fast-flowing streams in rainforests and other forests. It does not only lay its eggs in fast streams. It spends most of its time in or near the water. The adult frog is gray or olive on the back with mottling colors and a white belly. This frog can lay eggs at any time of year. The female frog lays her eggs underneath rocks. The tadpoles have strong tails for swimming and mouths on the underside of their bodies so they can hold onto rocks. Adult frogs hide in the stream or near waterfalls during the day and look for food at night. They usually do not go more than 35 metres away from the water.\nThis frog eats almost any animal without bones inside that it can fit into its mouth. It will eat flies, dragonflies, beetles, true bugs, mites, bees, wasps, ants, insect larvae and millipedes.\nThis frog is endangered. Scientists think this might be because feral pigs brought to Australia by humans rip up their streams, but they are not sure. Some scientists looked at whether habitat loss or or chemicals that humans use to kill insects might be killing the frogs, and they found this is probably not what is killing them. Some scientists think the fungal disease chytridiomycosis could be killing the frogs"}

The author of the work is unknown, but he probably had a Christian background. It was probably written in the 6th century Byzantine Palaestina Prima.\nHow the text is known.\nThe text is known from three Greek manuscript copies written between the 14th and 16th centuries, and one Coptic\u2013Arabic bilingual translation from the late 14th century. The first modern edition of the Coptic text was published in 1900/1901. The Greek text was first described in 1931, but published for the first time only in 2007.\nOrigin and authorship.\nThe text was originally written in Palaestina Prima. It was written in the Greek language. The Coptic manuscripts names its author as \"Apa Seba\" (Arabic: \"Saba\"), referring to Saint Sabas of Palestine (439\u2013532). Evidence from the text itself leads to a somewhat later dating: in the second half of the 6th century. It could have been written by a follower of Sabas, possibly a monk in the monastery of Mar Saba. This monastery had been founded by Sabas. A certain anti-philosophical polemic tendency expressed by the text can be related to the Origenist controversies of the mid-6th century, in which Mar Saba had played an important role.\nContents.\nThe unknown author declares he was prompted to the study of the secret meanings of the letters by the words of the Apocalypse, \"I am the Alpha and Omega\", and that he then received a vision about them on Mount Sinai.\nThe author proposes a re-modelled Greek alphabet reduced to 22 letters on the model of the 22 letters of Hebrew (leaving out Xi \u039e and Psi \u03a8), and with the Hebrew letter names. He then interprets these letters as symbolic figures of 22 works of divine creation in the biblical Creation according to Genesis, and of 22 corresponding works of salvation by Christ. He shows this theory through descriptions of the various letters and interpretations of their shapes. This is followed by an account of the history of the alphabet, which weaves together elements of Greek mythology and the Hebrew Bible as well as several Jewish and pagan texts: according to this account, the Hebrew alphabet was first handed down to mankind by divine inspiration during the generation of Enoch, but was lost during the Confusion of Tongues. God then revealed the Greek alphabet on a tablet of stone, which, after the Deluge, was brought to Phoenicia and Greece by Cadmos.\nA long section of the text is devoted especially to the letter Waw and its Greek equivalent, Digamma (called \"Episemon\" in the treatise), the numeral sign for \"6\". This sign is interpreted as a special symbol of Christ. This idea is further connected to the interpretation of all three extra-alphabetic numeral signs of Greek (\"Episemon\" for 6, Koppa for 90, and Sampi for 900) as symbols of the Holy Trinity, i.e. Christ, the Holy Ghost and God the Father respectively later in the text.\nThe final chapters of the text are speculations about more general topics, including the history of mankind \u2013 whose key events are related symbolically to the sequence of vowels and consonants in the alphabet \u2013, a discussion of Christology dealing with issues related to the Council of Chalcedon, and reflections upon the name of \"Adam\"."}

In the low-lying areas, the forest cover is very sparse, also due to the fact that the precipitation is too low for trees and forests to grow in most of these areas; whereas in many mountainous areas, the forest cover is much greater especially in wetter areas.\n49% of the country's forests are located in the Greater Caucasus Mountains, 34% in the Lesser Caucasus Mountains, 15% in the Talysh Mountains-Lankaran Lowland region, 2% in the Kur-Araz Lowland, and 0.5% in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic.\nThe forests are classified into two major ecoregions in Azerbaijan: the Caucasus mixed forests of the Greater Caucasus Mountains and the Lesser Caucasus Mountains, and the Caspian Hyrcanian mixed forests of the Talysh Mountains-Lankaran Lowland region.\nAzerbaijan has many endemic tree and shrub species, relicts of the Tertiary period which were not affected by Pliocene and Pleistocene glaciations."}

Bluey lived for 29 years and 5 months.\nAnother dog named Chilla was said to have lived for 32 years. A study was done to see if Australian Cattle Dogs lived longer than other dog breeds. 100 dogs were surveyed. The study showed that Australian Cattle Dogs lived on average for 13.41 years, almost a year longer than other dog breeds. In the end, the study says that Bluey and Chilla should be seen as distinct from other dogs instead of showing longer lives for Australian Cattle Dogs.\nThree other dogs named Max, Bella, and Maggie were said by their owners to have lived longer than Bluey. \"Guinness World Records\" did not put any of the dogs in their book because the dog owners could not verify that fact."}

Christmas elves are often said to wear green or red clad with large, pointy ears and pointy hats. Santa's elves are known to make the toys in Santa's workshop and take care of his reindeer, among other tasks.\nThe Christmas elf appeared in literature as early as 1850 when Louisa May Alcott completed, but never published a book entitled \"Christmas Elves\". The image of the elves in the workshop was popularized by \"Godey's Lady's Book\", with a front cover illustration for its 1873 Christmas Issue showing Santa surrounded by toys and elves with the caption, \"Here we have an idea of the preparations that are made to supply the young folks with toys at Christmas time.\" During this time, Godey's was immensely influential to the birth of Christmas traditions, having shown the first widely circulated picture of a modern Christmas tree on the front cover of its 1850 Christmas issue. Additional recognition was given in Austin Thompson's 1876 work \"The House of Santa Claus, a Christmas Fairy Show for Sunday Schools\".\nThe elves are generally said to live for hundreds, or even thousands, of years, despite the fact that in some cases they appear eternally youthful as children."}

He was the 96th emperor of Japan. When he lived, the shoguns had a lot of power in Japan. Emperor Go-Diago tried to take power from them so he could rule Japan.\nWhen Go-Daigo lived, Japan had two governments. There was one government set up by the emperors of Japan, who lived in Kyoto. There was another government run by the shoguns, the \"bakufu\". The law said the emperors were rulers, but the bakufu had more power than they did. Neither the emperor's government nor the shogun's government was powerful enough to rule very well.\nEarly life.\nGo-Daigo was born with the name Takaharu on November 26, 1288. He was born on Mount Yoshino, near the town of Yoshino in Nara.\nEmperor.\nGo-Daigo became emperor in 1318 when he was 30 years old. This was not usual for the time. Usually, small boys were made emperor. When they became adult men, they went to religious communities for men, where they would set up a government and rule even though they stayed in the monastery. A new boy from the imperial family was put on the throne. This system, with a boy on the throne in public and a \"former\" emperor ruling from a monastery, was called cloistered rule or \"insei\".\nGo-Daigo wanted to rule Japan himself. The bakufu government was weak because they had not been able to reward their warriors. When the Mongols invaded, the bakufu brought an army and kept them from invading. But the usual way to reward warriors was to give them the defeated enemy's lands and treasure. Because the Mongols were invaders, they had no lands for the shoguns to give to their warriors. This made the warriors unhappy with the shoguns. Go-Daigo began to quietly raise an army to defeat the bakufu and take control of Japan, but he was found out. The shogun caught him and imprisoned him on the Oki Islands.\nGo-Daigo's supporters fought for him while he was on the Oki Islands. One of the shogun's generals, Ashikaga Takauji changed sides. Go-Daigo's side won, and Go-Daigo ruled. His rule is called the Kemmu Restoration.\nGo-Daigo did not reward Ashikaga Takauji with a high rank, only the rank of counsellor. He did not reward many of his other supporters either. In 1335, Takauji declared himself shogun and rebelled. Takauji and his army captured Kyoto and set up one of Go-Daigo's relatives as an emperor there. Go-Daigo ran away from Kyoto and set up a court Yoshino, south of Nara. Go-Daigo's court only ruled the land nearby. So for many years, there were two men who said they were emperor of Japan.\nLegacy.\nAfter Go-Daigo's time as ruler, the line of emperor was split in two, one northern and one southern. They were made one line again in 1392."}

It was released in December 19, 1986. It is the sixth King Kong movie, as well as the sequel of the 1976 movie.\nPlot.\nAfter being shot down from the World Trade Center, Kong is revealed to be still alive and is kept in a coma for about 10 years at the Atlantic Institute, under the care of surgeon Dr. Amy Franklin. In order to save Kong's life, Dr. Franklin must perform a heart transplant and give Kong a computer-monitored artificial heart. However, he has lost so much blood that a blood transfusion is badly needed, but Franklin says there is no species of ape or other animal whose blood type matches Kong's.\nHank \"Mitch\" Mitchell, adventurer and Franklin's eventual lover, who travels to Borneo (as he theorizes that Borneo and the island from the first movie were once part of the same landmass) and captures a giant female ape who is named \"Lady Kong\". Mitchell brings her to the institute to use her blood for King Kong's surgery. The transfusion and the heart transplant are a success, but Kong escapes along with Lady Kong.\nArchie Nevitt, an insane army lieutenant colonel, is called in with his men to hunt down and kill the two apes. Lady Kong is captured alive by Nevitt's troops and imprisoned; Kong falls from a cliff and is presumed dead. However, as Franklin and Mitchell soon discover, Kong's artificial heart is beginning to fail, forcing them to attempt a jailbreak. They discover that Lady Kong is pregnant with Kong's offspring. The jailbreak is successful thanks to Kong, who has survived the fall and breaks his mate out. After being followed, attacked, and shot by the military, Kong kills Lt. Col Nevitt and dies slowly near a military base on a farm where Lady Kong gives birth to an infant son. Kong reaches out to touch his son just before dying. Having returned to Borneo, Lady Kong lives peacefully with her son in the jungle.\nCritical response.\n\"King Kong Lives\" was criticized by movie critics and the reviews were very negative. Rotten Tomatoes reported that none of the movie critics gave the movie a positive review, which has an average rating of only 2.20 out of 10. On Metacritic, the movie has an average score of 32 out of 100 based on 9 reviews by movie critics, meaning \"generally unfavorable reviews\".\nBox office.\nAcross the world, \"King Kong Lives\" was a commercial success at the box office, with a total revenue of $48.9\u00a0million, which was much more than the movie budget of $18\u00a0million.\nIt was a box office bomb in the United States and Canada, grossing $4,711,220 during its theatrical run. But the movie's success elsewhere, covered the losses in North America."}

Scientists saw the adult frogs sitting on rocks or leaves near the streams.\nThe tadpoles live in the fast water. Scientists wrote that they had strong tails for swimming and bodies meant for the water to flow over them. Sometimes they would dig into the sand to hold on during floods. The tadpoles would spend the winter in mountain streams and grow into frogs in the spring.\nThis frog is in danger of dying out. Scientists last saw the adult frog and tadpoles in 1990. They saw them in the Carbine Tableland.\nScientists think pigs that escaped from humans might be one reason why the frog is endangered. The pigs rip up the streams where the frog would live. They also think the fungal disease chytridiomycosis might be killing these frogs. Scientists also thought habitat loss, human beings building roads and farms where the frog would live, was killing the frogs, but the Australian government protected the frogs' home in 1988."}

It is only found on Hispaniola. It is also called the Haitian solenodon, or agouta.\nDescription.\nThe Hispaniolan solenodon looks like a shrew. Adults are 49 to 72\u00a0cm (19 to 28 in) in length. Its average weight is about 800 g (28\u00a0oz). They are usually dusky brown, with a paler underside and reddish fur on the sides of the head, throat and upper chest. The tail, legs, snout, and eyelids are do not have any hair.\nDistribution and Habitat.\nHispaniolan solenodon is only found on the Hispaniola. Their habitat is usually found in moist forests that are not disturbed by human activities. They are usually found below an altitude of 1,000 m (3,300\u00a0ft). They are sometimes found at higher altitudes or near developed agricultural land.\nFeeding.\nHispaniolan solenodons mainly eats arthropods. It also eats worms, snails, mice and small reptiles. It may also eat a small amount of fruit, grains, and leaf litter.\nBehaviour.\nHispaniolan solenodons are nocturnal. During the day, they stay in their burrows, in trees, caves, or hide. Their burrows may have lots of chambers and tunnels. Adult male and female usually live together with six young ones.\nReproduction.\nIt breeds throughout the year. It has a gestation period of over 84 days. It gives birth to one to three young ones. Usually, if it gives birth to three only two will survive, because the female only has two teats. The young ones are born blind with no hair. The young ones weigh 40 to 55 g (1.4 to 1.9 oz). For two months, they are carried around by the mother. No one knows how long it takes for them to be weaned. They can live for over eleven years in captivity.\nConservation status.\nThe Hispaniolan solenodon is an endangered species because of habitat loss and predation by introduced species. Its numbers have decreased during the last few decades.\nThe species is protected by law. However, national parks in both Haiti and the Dominican Republic are threatened by deforestation, using the land for farming and charcoal production. The US Agency for International Development and the Nature Conservancy are working with local nongovernmental organisations to make the protection for these parks better."}

They occur because of kidney damage. This is different from nephritic syndrome where there are red blood cells in urine, giving it a red colour appearance. \nNephrotic syndrome is diagnosed by doctors based on the classical symptoms of oedema, proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia and hyperlipidaemia (which is explained below).\nCauses.\nCauses can be divided into two as primary and secondary causes.\nPrimary causes are conditions developing within the kidney.\nSecondary causes affect other body parts in addition to kidneys.\nTreatment.\nTreatment is with drugs that will reduce the damage to the kidneys. Prednisone, Cyclophosphamide, levamisole are some drugs used to treat nephrotic syndrome. \nIn addition to that lack of albumin is treated by giving albumin from outside into a vein. Fluid retention is treated with drugs called \"diuretics\" which will remove excessive water collected in the body. The person is advised to consume salt, fat containing foods and fluids including water in low amounts.\nPrognosis.\nPrognosis is the medical term for the likely outcome of a disease. Good prognosis means the person will have a good outcome with no organ damage and no long lasting effects due to the disease.\nNephrotic syndrome in children usually has a good prognosis. However in children less than 5 years old and in adults over 30 years the prognosis is usually not good and can lead to permanent kidney damage. In these groups the disease will reappear after some time and need continuous drug treatment to keep the disease under control."}

More than 12% of all the plants in the Pantanal rainforest had burned by August.\nIn June, Brazil's National Institute for Space Research (INPE) said its satellites had taken pictures of 2,248 fires. In June 2019, there had been 1,880 fires.\nCauses.\nIt is normal for there to be some fires in the rainforest. Some are caused by lightning. But experts say most of the 2020 wildfires were set by humans. Satellite photos of the new fires show most of them started along roads leading into land belonging to indigenous peoples who live in Brazil.\nEnvironmental scientists say that a time with very dry weather made the fires worse. In 2020, Brazil saw its worst drought in 50 years. Other experts say the COVID-19 pandemic also made the fires worse because government agencies were too busy to fight the fires.\nFirefighter Alexandre Pereira who works in Mato Grosso do Sur said over 95% of the fires in his state had been started by people.\nEnvironmentalist Carlos Rittl from Germany's Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies blamed Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who encouraged people to start fires. He also weakened IBAMA, Brazil's environmental agency, so it could not fight fires or punish people who started fires.\nBolsonaro said the indigenous peoples started the fires, but photographs taken from craft orbiting the Earth show that the fires did not start on indigenous land. Bolsonaro has said he wants people to be able to start farms and mines on land that the law says belongs to the indigenous Brazilians.\nIndigenous people.\nThese fires are bad for the indigenous people in Brazil because they burn up the food that they would eat. The smoke from fires in some areas is flowing into other areas, harming people's health."}

Guppy holds the legal rights of the title as per the contract drawn up between him and the Manorial Counsel Limited on October 13, 2016, in compliance with the Honours (Prevention of Abuses) Act 1925 (Hatton Solicitors).\nHistory.\nBefore the Battle of Hastings, Norman Invasion in 1066, Caldecote was Edeva the Fair. After the Norman Invasion, in 1085, William the Conqueror ordered the commission of the Domesday Book. It was published in 1086 and divided the English counties into 13,418 manors under the governance of Lord of Manor. During this time, Caldecote was under the ownership of Bishop of Chester. The Caldecote Manor was transferred to Herbert Ruffus of Walsall in 1166 and was then passed to William Rufus. It then descended through Margaret, William\u2019s daughter.\nKing Henry I granted the Lordship of Houghton Regis and Domesday manors to Dunstable Priory, the Priory Church of St Peter. King John supported the decision, and it resulted in an attack on gallows of the Priory at Eddesuthe by Eudo la Zouche, Lord of Cantelou. The Lords also broke open the Priory\u2019s jail at Caldecote.\nDescription.\nManorial Lordship is not a title of nobility as per the modern British honours system and is related to property ownership. It is an ownership title that can be transferred, conveyed, and even sold. This title is inheritable by the Lord or Lady\u2019s child after their demise. The title is also referred to as the incorporeal hereditament as per the law."}

Fish have been raised as food in pools and ponds for thousands of years.\nTypes of fishkeeping.\nFishkeeping can be divided into three disciplines, depending on the type of water the fish came from. They are freshwater, brackish, and saltwater fishkeeping.\nFreshwater fishkeeping.\nFreshwater fishkeeping is the most popular type of fishkeeping. Small pet stores often sell many types of freshwater fish such as goldfish, guppies, and angelfish. Many fishkeepers create freshwater aquascapes where there are lots of aquatic plants as well as fish.\nSaltwater fishkeeping.\nMarine aquaria is a type of fishkeeping that is not very popular. This is because saltwater fish have more specific needs to keep them alive. Saltwater fish is also expensive. Many types of saltwater fish are kept in saltwater fishkeeping.\nBrackish water fishkeeping.\nBrackish water aquaria is a type of fishkeeping. The salinity in a brackish-water aquarium must stay between the salinity of freshwater and seawater. Many types of fish prefer brackish water including some types of mollies, many types of gobies, some types of pufferfish, monos, and scats."}

There are 145 species in 16 genera. \nMost sunbirds feed largely on nectar, but will also eat insects and spiders, especially when feeding their young. Long narrow flowers are punctured at the base near the nectaries, where the birds get the nectar. Fruit is also often part of their diet. \nThe sunbirds have similarities with two distantly related groups: the hummingbirds of the Americas and the honeyeaters of Australia. The resemblances are due to convergent evolution. They all have a similar nectar-feeding lifestyle. Some sunbird species can take nectar by hovering like a hummingbird, but they usually perch to feed."}

{"id": "792261", "revid": "551548", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=792261", "title": "Cradleboard", "text": "When children are infants, they need to be carried around a lot. Indigenous cultures in North America and throughout northern Scandinavia have come up with a structure they called Cradleboard. Cradleboards are baby-carriers that protect the baby. In Cheyenne, a cradleboard is called p\u00e2hoe\u0161est\u00f4tse or \u2603\u2603, in Skolt Sami it is called \u01e9i\u00f5tk\u00e2mp\u00e2hoe\u0161est\u00f4tse or \u01e9i\u00f5tk\u00e2m. There are different styles of cradleboard; each culture has its own style or styles. Some communities still use cradleboards. \nStructure.\nCradleboards are used for the first few months of an infant's life. At that time, babies are carried around a lot, and a portable baby-carrier is a great help. Some cradleboards are woven, as with the Apache. Woven cradleboards are made of willow, dogwood, tule, or cattail fibres. Wooden cradleboards are made by the Iroquois and Penobscot. Navajo cradleboards are made with a Ponderosa pine frame with buckskin laces looped through the frame.\nCradleboards are built with a broad, firm protective frame for the infant's spine. A footrest is located at the bottom of the cradleboard. A cradleboard also has a rounded cover over the infant's head that is similar to a canopy or a modern-day baby carriage hood. The purpose of this headpiece is to provide shade for the infant, since it could be covered with an animal skin, or a blanket in winter to protect against the elements in colder climates. The headpiece also provides extra head protection in case anything bumps against the cradleboard. Ornaments and sacred amulets are often attached to the headpiece as well, for example \"beaded umbilical cord cases, and dream catchers or medicine wheels\", to amuse and help the infant develop his or her eyesight.\nThe inside of the cradleboard is padded with a lining of fresh plant fibres, such as sphagnum moss, cattail down, or shredded bark from juniper or cliffrose. The lining serves as a disposable diaper, although the Navajo could clean and reuse the lining made of shredded juniper or cliffrose bark. These plant fibres have antiseptic properties, they keep the infant's skin healthy. The Chippewa tradition was to make a lining for the cradleboard usually from moss growing in cranberry marshes. Before it is used, the moss is smoked over a fire to kill insects; afterwards it is rubbed and pulled to soften it. In cold weather, the infant's feet may be wrapped in rabbit skin with the fur facing inward. The moss lining is surrounded by a birch bark tray insert placed into the cradleboard, which could be removed for cleaning.\nUse.\nCradleboards have been used in cultures ranging from the sub-Arctic regions of present-day Canada, down to Mexico and Central America. In Arctic regions, cold weather does not make a cradleboard feasible for the infant's survival, and infants are carried in a sling worn under the mother's parka. Cradleboards were widely used by indigenous people across present-day North America. Cradleboards are used by the Kickapoo people in Mexico and were used by Aztecs and the Seri people and Mayan communities as far south as Belize. In present-day South America, most indigenous cultures used slings or pouches, sometimes called a \"rebozo\", rather than cradleboards. Cradleboards were used in the southernmost part of the continent, in the Patagonia region.\nCradleboards were used during periods when the infant's mother had to travel or otherwise be mobile for work, and needed to protect the infant. The cradleboard could be carried on the mother's back, using support from \"tumplines\", or \"burden straps\" that would wrap around her forehead, chest or shoulders; if she carried a pack as well as the cradleboard, the pack strap would go around her chest and the cradleboard strap would go around her forehead. The cradleboard can also be stood up against a large tree or rock if the infant is small, or hung from a pole (as inside an Iroquois longhouse), or even hung from a sturdy tree branch. They were also used when longer travel was required, as the cradleboard could be attached to a horse for transportation.\nIn the southwest United States and northern Mexico, among cultures such as the Hopi and Apache, infants would spend most of their day and night in the cradleboard. When they got older, infants were taken out of it more and more, for up to five times per day. When the infant reaches the age when it can sit up unsupported, it is then gradually weaned from the use of the cradleboard, and spends less time in it. At this time, the infant may use a second, larger cradleboard that replaces the first. By the time the infant is a year old and begins to walk, they are generally finished with cradleboard use.\nCradleboard use and its effect on mother-infant interaction has been studied in Navajo communities. It has been shown that cradleboard use has no significant negative effect on this development. In the first few months of infancy, cradleboards have a soothing effect on babies. After six months of age or more, infants begin to resist being placed in cradleboards more vigorously as they become more mobile, and they are often placed in the cradleboard with their arms and hands free, so that they can play with objects hung from the cradleboard for their amusement.\nDevelopmental dysplasia of the hips.\nCradleboard use has been associated with increased incidence of developmental dysplasia of the hip. The technique requires straightening the legs, which encourages dislocation of the femur and malformation of the acetabulum. This can be avoided by placing padding between the baby's legs to keep the knees slightly bent with the hips angled outwards.

{"id": "792368", "revid": "22027", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=792368", "title": "Westlink M7", "text": "The Westlink M7 Motorway or Westlink M7 \u2013 formerly Western Sydney Orbital \u2013 is one of Sydney's urban motorways and a part of the Sydney Orbital Network. It is a tolled motorway that is owned and operated by NorthWestern Roads Group (NWR) and connects three motorways: M5 South Western Motorway at Prestons, M4 Western Motorway at Eastern Creek and M2 Hills Motorway at Baulkham Hills. It opened on 16 December 2005, eight months ahead of schedule.\nHistory.\nWestern Sydney is the fastest growing part of the Sydney metropolitan area. The Ring Road 5 and State Route 55 \u2013 and later State Route 77 \u2013 originally meant to bypass Sydney, had instead become primary arteries for the western suburbs.\nBy the late 1990s and first decade of the 21st century Western Sydney had become the third biggest producer of Australia's GDP, after the Sydney CBD and Melbourne. The growth of industrial and residential areas brought about a massive increase in traffic on its local roads. This led to the planning of the Western Sydney Orbital which, among its original purposes, was to serve the stillborn second international airport at Badgerys Creek.\nIn January 2001 the federal government made a commitment to progressively contribute A$356 million to the M7 project, with the remaining A$1.5 billion required for the design and construction provided by the private sector. The NSW Minister for Planning authorised the undertaking in February 2002.\nThe M7 Motorway was privately funded through an innovative construction contract method known as a \"deed\" to facilitate the expedition of the tendering phase; several deeds were drawn up based on the contractors proposals. The deed was for the full design, construction, operation and maintenance of the motorway including more than 40 kilometres (25 mi) of continuously reinforced concrete (CRCP) and asphalt roads, upgrading of local roads, the longest free-flowing (no toll booths) toll road in the world at the time. More than 90 bridges (of four different types) and the largest shared path network in the southern hemisphere. The design, construct, operate and maintain contract worth at least A$2.0 billion was awarded to WSO (Western Sydney Orbital Pty Ltd) by the Roads &amp; Traffic Authority. The design and construct portion of the contract valued at A$1.8 billion was awarded to a joint venture between Abigroup and Leighton Contractors (ALJV) with design work undertaken by a further joint venture by Maunsell AECOM and SMEC (Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation) with further subcontracting to other designers (Arup) and independent verification by Sinclair Knight Merz (SKM).\nThe motorway was opened to traffic in 2005. WSO (commonly known as Westlink) operate the motorway with maintenance subcontracted to Westlink Services and tolling to ROAM. With its opening, Metroad 7 between Liverpool and Beecroft was transferred from Cumberland Highway to Westlink M7. Westlink M7 was the first Sydney motorway to be marked with an alphanumeric shield rather than the hexagonal Metroad shield.\nOn 25 December 2005, just 9 days after opening, the M7 suffered its first fatality: a 12-year-old boy died at Cecil Park when the four-wheel drive he was travelling in rolled down an embankment and onto Elizabeth Drive, almost crushing another car.\nRoute.\nLight Horse Interchange\nThe M7 originates at the Roden Cutler Interchange, a Y-junction with the M31 Hume Motorway and M5 South Western Motorway at Prestons, and weaves to the west of Liverpool to the junction of Elizabeth Road and Wallgrove Road in Abbotsbury. From then on it runs parallel to Wallgrove Road north towards the Great Western Highway and the Light Horse interchange, a stack junction with the M4. Continuing north, it leads to Minchinbury and follows alongside Rooty Hill Road up to Dean Park at an exit with Rooty Hill Road North and Richmond Road.\nFrom this junction the M7 turns eastward along the preserved Castlereagh Freeway corridor through Quakers Hill and Kings Langley up to the interchange with Old Windsor Road to Norwest Business Park and continues southeast to reconcile with the existing M2 Hills Motorway in Baulkham Hills. It is 4 lanes (2 lanes each way) for its entire length.\nLight Horse Interchange.\nThe Light Horse Interchange is the junction of the M4 and M7 motorways. The stack interchange is the largest of its type in the southern hemisphere. It was named in honour of an Australian World War One formation, the Australian Light Horse. It is also the only one in Australia\nTolls.\nThe Westlink was built as a fully tolled, gateless motorway employing electronic payment, with an initial toll-free period that ended on 15 January 2006. The toll was originally 29.91 cents per kilometre, capped after 20 kilometres (12 mi) at $5.98. On 1 April 2006, this increased to 30.07 cents per kilometre, capped after 20 kilometres (12 mi) at $6.01. As of 2015, the toll was 38.31 cents per kilometre, capped at $7.66, and adjusted quarterly according to the CPI."}

The skeleton turned out to be 33.000 years old, and was probably among the first people on the British Isles.\nThe skeleton was painted with red ochre. As pearls and ivory was found nearby, the skeleton was first thought to be that of a woman. William Buckland who found it, thought that it must have been that of a witch or a prosititute during the Roman Era Britain. In 1968, radiocarbo dating was done, and the skeleton was found to be about 22.000 years old. The man had been bout 21, at the time of his death. The age of 22.000 years was problematic though: it meant that the British Isles would have been settled during a time when it was very cold. Another dating was done in 1989; it found an age of 33.000 years. Another dating, done in 2008, gave an age of 33.000 years. 33.000 years ago, there was one of the warmer periods of the ice age. \nToday , the skeleton is kept at the Oxford Museum of Natural History."}

During this time, the person for whom the handkerchief was thrown should get up quickly and catch the person running. If she fails, she takes the handkerchief and goes around the circle."}

It lives in rainforests and sclerophyll forests, in streams where the water flows quickly. The adult male frog spends time in rocky streams and the female frog and young frog sit on plants near streams. The tadpole lives where the water flows fast. They hold onto rocks with their mouths, which are on the undersides of their bodies.\nThe female frog lays 46-63 eggs at a time. They are 2.4-2.6 mm in diameter. She lays them in groups under rocks in the water.\nScientists are not sure why this frog is endangered, but they do not think it is droughts or that humans have changed too much of the wild places where they live. This is because Australia made laws protecting the frogs' home in 1988, but there are still fewer and fewer of them. Scientists say one reason this frog is endangered is because pigs that have run away from people run through their streams and kill adult frogs. This frog can catch the fungal disease chytridiomycosis.\nScientists say this frog is related to \"Ranoidea nannotis\"."}

{"id": "793252", "revid": "508885", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=793252", "title": "The Proud Boys", "text": "The Proud Boys are a twenty-first century alt-right organization. They do most of their things in the United States. A Canadian-British man called Gavin McInnes started the group because he hoped Donald Trump would win the 2016 United States presidential election. The Proud Boys only allow men to join, so there are no women. They call themselves \"western chauvinists,\" meaning they think Western Civilization is the best, and they say they are not racist, are not alt-right and do not support white supremacy or fascism or violence. Experts disagree and say they are racist, are alt-right and do support white supremacy and violence.\nAccording to the Anti-Defamation League, the Proud Boys hate women, Muslims, transmen and transwomen, and immigrants. The United States FBI says they are an extremist group. The Southern Poverty Law Center says they are a hate group.\nAs of 2020, Twitter, Facebook and other social media sites do not allow Proud Boys to post. Square, J.P. Morgan Chase and Paypal all stopped processing payments from the Proud Boys' online store.\nActivities.\nThe Proud Boys like to show up to places where liberal organizations are protesting to counter-protest and fight. \nIn 2017, Proud Boy Jason Kessler helped organize the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. There, the Proud Boys joined Neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan to say they did not want a statue of Robert E. Lee taken down. A woman named Heather Heyer was killed when a right-winger drove his car into a crowd.\nIn 2019, some Proud Boys were arrested in New York for physically attacking members of Antifa, an anti-fascist group. The Proud Boys have shown up to Black Lives Matter protests.\nPolitics.\nThe Proud Boys say that they are not racist and say they do not like white supremacy, racism, violence or fascism, however they do have many people and factions within their organization that do support Fascism along with other ideologies. They like to carry weapons in public. They say they must exist as a politically right counter to the anti-fascist group Antifa. According to scholar Amy Cooter of Vanderbilt University, they do support White supremacy and only say they don't. Cooter told \"USA Today\" that the Proud Boys are trying not to look like Neo-Nazis. \nJoan Donovan of Harvard University's Technology and Social Change Research Project said the Proud Boys don't want to be called a hate group because then they cannot use Paypal, Chase or most other programs to sell things or collect donated money through the Internet. Most online payment collection services, for example PayPal, say in their terms of service that they will not work with hate groups. In 2019, McInnes sued the SPLC for calling the Proud Boys a hate group.\nRecruiting.\nThe Proud Boys are very good with technology and social media. As late as 2018, they used Facebook to bring in new members. They had rules and prizes for different things. A member could earn \"first degree\" by posting a video of himself saying the Proud Boys oath: \"\"My name is ____, I'm from ____, ____, and I am a western chauvinist who refuses to apologize for creating the modern world.\" You can add anything else you'd like to your video, as long as you say those words exactly.\" Members could earn other degrees by letting other Proud Boys beat them up, getting a Proud Boys tattoo or getting into a fight \"for the cause.\"\nPresidential debate.\nThe Proud Boys became more famous on September 29, 2020 because the candidates talked about them in the first debate of the 2020 United States presidential election. Presidential debates are when the two or more people who want to be president stand on a stage. Another person called a moderator asks them questions and lets them argue with each other. People watch in person or on television or the Internet.\nPresident Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden debated each other that night. The host running the debate, Chris Wallace, asked Trump if he would say white supremacist and militia groups were bad and tell them to stop hurting people and breaking property. Donald Trump asked Wallace to say the name of a specific group. Biden said \"The Proud Boys.\" Then Donald Trump said \"Proud Boys, stand back and stand by, but you know what? Someone's got to do something about Antifa.\" In English, \"stand by\" means \"wait and be ready to act.\"\nAccording to Elon University professor Megan Squire, this made the Proud Boys \"extremely happy.\" \"They reacted exactly as I thought they would,\" Squire told \"USA Today\". \"They were extremely excited by what he said. They felt validated. They took it the same way everybody listening took it \u2014 that he was giving them a shout-out, basically.\"\n#ProudBoys hashtag on Twitter.\nA few days later, gay men started to use the #ProudBoys Twitter hashtag. Officially, Twitter does not allow Proud Boys to post, but some do anyway. Gay men posted pictures of themselves with their husbands or other partners and tagged the posts #ProudBoys, because they are boys and they are proud. Englishman Matt Dechaine started the idea. He said he did it to \"spread joy\" and work for \"movement for positive change [...] rooted in respect and love for each other.\"\nEnrique Tarrio said thought the idea was funny but did not like it for other reasons: \"One of the messages they want to send with this is that they're trying to drown out our supporters, they're trying to silence us. ... When you're trying to drown out other people's thoughts, I don't think there's anything progressive about that. Why don't these people just engage?\"\nColors and logos.\nProud Boys like to wear red MAGA hats because they support United States President Donald Trump. They also like to wear black-and-yellow Fred Perry polo shirts. Fred Perry stopped selling the shirts in the United States because they do not like the Proud Boys.\nAfter Donald Trump told them \"stand back and stand by,\" Proud Boys started wearing clothes saying \"Standing back and standing by.\""}

These rules can be laws, guidelines, or regulations. Ideally, these rules affect all groups in society in the same way. When this is not the case, and one group or community is affected more than the others, this is known as environmental racism. As is common with racism, the groups are defined based on race, or skin color; sometimes on income. Very often, all the people decide on these rules. When some groups are excluded from the decision-making process, this is also known as environmental racism. \nBenjamin Chavis first used the term, in the 1980s. At the time, he was a leading member of the Civil rights movement in the United States. The movement found that when a new landfill was constructed, minorities such as hispanics and black people were affected more often than the white people. The explanation given was the difference in income - hispanics and black people often earn less than white people. A study of 2007 showed that this explanation is too simple and that there are more complex patterns at play. The study also showed that environmental racism occurs in almost all bigger cities in the United States. \nThe term was later used to describe the situation in the Niger delta, and in Western New Guinea. \nEnvironmental justice is a term that started about the same time; it focuses more on distruibuting the benefits and burdens of environmental policies equally in society."}

In all episodes, she wonders about something different. The other cows in the field, who are black and white, do not believe her, so they say \"she's off again.\" Blue Cow then rides in a red double decker bus, which takes her to a place where she finds out the answer to what she is wondering about.\nWhen Blue Cow goes back to her field at the end of the episode, she tells the other cows in the field what she did during the day. The other cows still do not believe her, so they say \"Everyone knows cows can't ...\", then a description of what she did. After that, the narrator usually says \"But we know they can, don't we?\"."}

{"id": "793625", "revid": "551548", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=793625", "title": "Observational learning", "text": "One way to learn new skills is by observing the behavior of other people or animals. This is called Observational learning. It is a form of social learning which can take different forms. In humans, this form of learning seems to not need reinforcement; instead a social model such as a parent, sibling, friend, or teacher with surroundings is needed. For a child, a model is someone of authority or higher status in an environment. In animals, observational learning is often based on classical conditioning. In classical conditioning instinctive behavior is provoked by observing the behavior of another (e.g. mobbing in birds), but other processes may be involved as well.\nIn humans.\nMany behaviors that a learner observes, remembers, and imitates are actions that the model does not try to intentionally instill: A child may learn to swear, smack, smoke, and deem other inappropriate behavior acceptable through poor modeling. Albert Bandura claims that children continually learn desirable and undesirable behavior through observational learning. Observational learning suggests that an individual's environment, cognition, and behavior all incorporate and ultimately determine how the individual functions and models.\nThrough observational learning, individual behaviors can spread across a culture through a process called \"diffusion chain\". This occurs when an individual first learns a behavior by observing another individual and that individual serves as a model for other individuals to learn the behavior.\nCulture plays a role in whether observational learning is the dominant learning style in a person or community. Some cultures expect children to actively participate in their communities: the children are therefore exposed to different trades and roles on a daily basis. This exposure allows children to observe and learn the different skills and practices that are valued in their communities.\nAlbert Bandura, who is known for the classic Bobo doll experiment, identified this basic form of learning in 1961. The importance of observational learning lies in helping individuals, especially children, acquire new responses by observing others' behavior.\n Albert Bandura states that people's behavior could be determined by their environment. Observational learning occurs through observing negative and positive behaviors. Bandura believes in reciprocal determinism in which the environment can influence people's behavior and vice versa. For instance, the Bobo doll experiment shows that the model, in a determined environment, affects children's behavior. In this experiment Bandura demonstrates that one group of children placed in an aggressive environment would act the same way, while the control group and the other group of children placed in a passive role model environment hardly shows any type of aggression.\nIn communities where children's primary mode of learning is through observation, the children are rarely separated from adult activities. This allows children to use observational learning skills in multiple spheres of life. This learning through observation requires them to be attentive. Culturally, they learn that their participation and contributions are valued in their communities. This teaches children that it is their duty, as members of the community, to observe others' contributions so they gradually become involved and participate more in the community.\nIn animals.\nWhen an animal is given a task to complete, it is almost always more successful after observing another animal doing the same task before them. Experiments with several different species have shown the same effect: animals can learn behaviors from peers. However, there is a need to make a difference between the propagation of behavior and the stability of behavior. An animal might show the behaviour just once. In this case, the behaviour is not stable. Research has shown that social learning can spread a behavior, but there are more factors regarding how a behaviour is spread from one generaton of animals to the next, in an animal culture.\nLearning in fish.\nExperiments with ninespine sticklebacks showed that individuals will use social learning to locate food.\nSocial learning in pigeons.\nA study in 1996 at the University of Kentucky used a foraging device to test social learning in pigeons. A pigeon could access the food reward by either pecking at a treadle or stepping on it. Significant correspondence was found between the methods of how the observers accessed their food and the methods the initial model used in accessing the food.\nSocial learning in crows.\nThe University of Washington studied this phenomenon with crows: There is a tradeoff between acquiring costly information firsthand and learning that information socially. Using social learning is easier for the individual, but there is a risk of inaccuracy. The experimenters exposed wild crows to a unique \u201cdangerous face\u201d mask as they trapped, banded, and released 7-15 birds at five different study places around Seattle, WA. An immediate scolding response to the mask after trapping by previously captured crows illustrates that the individual crow learned the danger of that mask. There was a scolding from crows that were captured that had not been captured initially. That response indicates conditioning from the mob of birds that assembled during the capture.\nLearning from peers is called horizontal social learning, learning from parents is called vertical social learning. Horizontal social learning is consistent with the lone crows that recognized the dangerous face without ever being captured. Children of captured crow parents were conditioned to scold the dangerous mask, which demonstrates earning from parents. The crows that were captured directly had the most precise discrimination between dangerous and neutral masks than the crows that learned from the experience of their peers. The ability of crows to learn doubled the frequency of scolding, which spread at least 1.2\u00a0 km from where the experiment started to over a 5-year period at one site.\nObservational learning in Everyday Life.\nObservational learning allows for new skills to be learned in a wide variety of areas. Demonstrations help the modification of skills and behaviors.\nLearning physical activities.\nWhen learning skills for physical activities can be anything that is learned that requires physical movement, such as learning a sport, learning to eat with a fork, or learning to walk. There are multiple important factors that help with modifying physical skills and psychological responses from an observational learning standpoint. Modeling is a factor in observational learning where the skill level of the model is considered. When someone is supposed to demonstrate a physical skill such as throwing a baseball the model should be able to execute the behavior of throwing the ball flawlessly if the model of learning is a mastery model. Another model that can be used is a coping model: This model would show a physical skill that they have not yet mastered or achieved high performance in. Both models are found to be effective and can be used. These models can be used as interventions to increase observational learning in practice, competition, and rehabilitation situations.\nNeuroscience.\nRecent research in neuroscience has shown that mirror neurons are the basis for observational learning. These specialized visuomotor neurons fire action potentials when an individual performs a motor task and also fire when an individual passively observes another individual performing the same motor task. In observational motor learning, the process begins with a visual presentation of another individual performing a motor task, this acts as a model. The learner then needs to transform the observed visual information into internal motor commands that will allow them to perform the same motor task; this is known as visuomotor transformation. Mirror neuron networks provide a mechanism for visuo-motor and motor-visual transformation and interaction. Similar networks of mirror neurons have also been implicated in social learning, motor cognition and social cognition."}

It lives near the Great Dividing Range in Victoria and New South Wales. It lives between 200 and 1100 metres above sea level.\nThe adult frog is 4.2 to 7.0 cm in length. It is green or brown and can have spots. This frog lives in forests on mountains, both dense forests and open forests, both dry forests high in the mountains and wet forests lower down. It always lives in rocky places near streams.\nThe female frog lays 200-1000 eggs at a time in between rocks or underneath rocks in the water. The tadpoles eat algae off rocks and dead things from the bottoms of the water. Male frogs that live near the bottoms of mountains become adults 18 months after transforming from tadpoles to frogs. Female frogs that live near the bottoms of mountains become adults 3.5 years after transforming into frogs. Male frogs that live high in the mountains become adults 3.5 years after transforming into frogs. Female frogs that live high in the mountains become adults 4.5 years after transforming into frogs. Adult frogs eat insects.\nThis frog is in danger of dying out. Scientists only ever saw this frog in 19 streams. The frog has disappeared from 4 of them. The other streams make up 12 groups of frogs who only mate within their group. Adult frogs do not move much. Scientists think a single frog does not move more than 80 metres in its whole life.\nScientists are not sure why this frog is endangered, but they think many of them died during the 20th century.

Paracelsus thought that it was good for treating almost anything. According to Paracelus, laudanum consists of about 9 parts wine, and one part opium. Other ingredients, such as henbane, mandrake and deadly nightshade were commonly added. Since its discovery in the 16th century, laudanum was often used to treat different diseases. Its popularity and use is comparable to the modern drug aspirin. Its main effect was that of the opium: it was a painkiller, and a sedative. \nThe main problem is that opium causes addiction. This was only seen starting with the 19th century. Towards the end of the 19th century, there were good alternative drugs. England banished opiates in the 1920s, Germany regulated their use in 1929. \nLaudanum, like other opiates was used as a painkiller, and a sedative. Until the 1970s it was used to treat clinical depression. Laudanum is dangerous to children, it is easy to get an overdose. Today, laudanum is still used to treat severe cases of diarrhea which sometimes occur with chemotherapy."}

Even though it is called the New England tree frog, it does not live in New England. It lives on Australia's New England Tablelands. It lives near the Great Dividing Range in Queensland and New South Wales. It lives more than 600 metres above sea level.\nThe adult male frog is 4.0 cm long and the adult female is 5.0 cm long. It can be green or brown on the back and green on the sides. It has a white stripe on each side of its body. Parts of its sides and legs are bright orange.\nThe tadpoles are about 3.5 cm long. Unlike tadpoles of other tree frogs, they do not have teeth or beaks. Instead, they have things similar to tentacles near their mouths. Scientists do not know what the tadpoles eat.\nThis frog is in some danger of dying out. Scientists say this is because human beings take animals to eat grass where the frog lives and collect trees from its forests for lumber. Invasive species such as trout also eat the eggs and tadpoles.\nScientists say this frog is related to \"Ranoidea citropa\"."}

It is the only German-based Creole language with an ISO code. It was developed in Papua New Guinea, around 1900. At that time, Papua New Guinea was a German colony. Today, most speakers live in Eastern Australia. Most speakers are old, so the language will soon disappear. Australian speakers of Unserdeutsch now live scattered in cities on the east coast, but communicate with one another in closed groups of social networks. It is estimated that fewer than ten Unserdeutsch speakers live in Papua New Guinea today. All speakers of Unserdeutsch know at least two other languages. In most cases, these are English and Tok Pisin. Estimates are that there are about 100 speakers left.\nOrigin.\nUnserdeutsch developed around 1900 around today's provincial capital Kokopo. At the time, this city was called Herbertsh\u00f6he. It was the seat of the provincial governor of German New Guinea. There was a Catholic school at the outskirts of town, which taught mixed-race children standard German. Most of the time, the mothers were locals, from Melanesia, and the fathers were Europeans; most often from Germany. They were civil servants, traders, and adventurers. \nOutside school, the children mixed the high German with the local language Tok Pisin. They were not allowed to use Tok Pisin in school. The language that developed essentially used German words, with the grammar from Tok Pisin. Even after German rule in Papua New Guinea ended, the Vunapope mission station (which ran the school) remained in German hands with German as a school subject and even partly as the language of instruction. Since the children who developed Unserdeutsch often kept to themselves as mixed-race children and got married, they passed their Unserdeutsch on to the next generation and Unserdeutsch became the Creole language. After Papua New Guinea gained independence from Australia in 1975, most of the Unserdeutsch speakers decided to take on Australian citizenship and to emigrate to Australia, especially Queensland, because offices and posts in their homeland were to be filled by indigenous Papuans.\nUnserdeutsch is a spoken language; there is no governing body that regulates how to write it. \nLinguists at the University of Augsburg (now: University of Bern) began to research Unserdeutsch in 2014.\nGrammar.\nNouns in Unserdeutsch have no gender. The article is always called \u201cde\u201d, for example de Mann, de Frau, de Haus. The plural of a noun is formed by prefixing the word \u201calle\u201d with: \u201calle Frau\u201d, \u201calle Knabe\u201d. Interrogative pronouns are often placed at the end of the question sentence (\u201cDu geht wo? \"). Sometimes, words from Tok Pisin and English are used, for example \u201caufpicken\u201d (In English: to pick up) for \u201cabholen\u201d (translates as fetch). Unserdeutsch is a strict SVO language.\nPlanned languages as alternatives.\nTwo planned languages were developed to be used in German colonies: One is called Weltdeutsch, the other is called Kolonialdeutsch."}

The Hyderabad state flag shows Green and Red (fly) with a Star and reversed Crescent (in white) in the centre, used as a state flag. It was annexed by India in 1948, after Winston Churchill had proposed to the United Nations to consider it as an independent state.\nFlag History.\nThe forebears of the Asaf Jahi Dynasty came to India from Samarkand, in Central Asia, but the family actually originated from Baghdad. In 1724, the Mughal Governor of the Deccan, (Nizam ul-Mulk) Qamar-ud-din Khan, Asaf Jah I, established himself as an independent ruler of Deccan. Hyderabad became the capital and later lent its name to that of the state he had created. The first Nizam's successors became closely allied to the British colonialists, frequently assisting them in subduing their enemies, the Maratha dynasty, Tipu Sultan of Mysore, and the French. In later years, the Nizam's troops invariably took part in all the main campaigns undertaken by the British Indian Army. Large numbers of his troops took part in the First and Second World Wars. These contributions earned for the Nizam unequalled titles and honours from a grateful Emperor.\nThe state was the largest and premier of all princely states within the British Indian Empire. After the Pakistani and Indian Independences, the 7th Nizam of Hyderabad, Osman Ali Khan, Asaf Jah VII decided that the Princely state of Hyderabad will not join the New Dominion of India or Dominion of Pakistan. His decision found favour with Pakistan but not with India, when he formally declared it on the 24th of August in 1947 respectively. The Nizam\u2019s state was a prosperous one and had its own army, railway and airline network, postal system and radio network. On 15th August 1947, India declared itself an independent nation. And so did Hyderabad.\nAt the time of the Independence movement of India, the State of Hyderabad was the largest of all princely states in India. The Nizam ruled over lands extending to cover 82,698 mi\u00b2 (214,190 km\u00b2) of fairly homogenous territory and was bigger than Belarus but was smaller than the Guyana. The Nizam ruled over a cosmopolitan comprised of a population of roughly 16.34 million people (as per the 1941 census) of which a majority (83%) was Hindu. These advantages persuaded the Nizam to attempt an Independent existence when the British withdrew from the sub-continent in 1947. He blatantly refused to succumb to be subdued to any pressure whatsoever to reluctantly join either India or Pakistan, preferring to form a separate Kingdom of its own within the British Commonwealth of Nations. Hyderabad State had its own Army, Airline, Telecommunication system, railway network, postal system, currency and Radio broadcasting service.\nOn 6 October 1948, Pakistan's Foreign Minister Zafarullah, requested the President of the United Nations Security Council that Pakistan be permitted to participate in the discussion of the Hyderabad question in accordance with Article 31 of the United Nations' Charter. The Government of Pakistan took the case and raised the question of the State of hyderabad to the United Nations security council Pursuant to Article 31, where it is still pending for resolution Pakistan has been mainly involved in arguments for the rights of Kashmiris. In spite of raising questions that predominantly affect Pakistan, the Pakistan delegation is often able to play a significant role in debates on other issues as well. As a number of states had not attained independence in the 1950s, Pakistan became an effective spokesman of many Asian states and movements, It states:\nIn this distinct entity of State of hyderabad, where no official Referendum was held and where the ruler did not accede, the forced accession to India brought about by Military action, was presumed to have the tacit approval of the predominantly Hindu population. In each case of annexation there was a different rationale, but a similar goal, namely Annexation of territories. The use of military force provided the only consistency in India's policy. The state that was once so well noted for its religious and ethnic toleration, ruled by a highly cultured and intellectually brilliant elite who maintained all that was best in the old Mughal order, was now no more. Although it has not always been satisfied with the effectiveness of the United Nations to act on Kashmir, Pakistan remains a keen and active member. Pakistan would like to see the United Nations strengthened so that it can serve as an effective force to uphold International law and protect weaker states."}

According to traditional official description, The badge is a white disk with Green objects are described in the warrant as 'bezants' and 'mountains' in the centre of the disk, with the name of the state at the top, with the state badge located in the fly respectively.\nHistory.\nJunagadh and Bantva-Manavadar was a Princely \"Maritime State\" which faced towards the Arabian Sea with Pakistan, in the Kathiawar Peninsula, the capital city was Junagarh. Ruled by Muslim rulers in British Raj till its illegal annexation into the Indian nation in 1948. It had an area of 8,904.6 Sq. Km\u00b2 (3,438 Sq. Mi\u00b2) and was bigger than Puerto Rico but was smaller than the Cyprus.\nMohammad Sher khan Babi, who owed allegiance to the Mughal governor of Gujarat subah, founded the state of Junagadh and declaring independence in 1730 after Marathas Gaikwad invasion. Muhammad Sher khan Babi, was the founder of the \"Babi Dynasty\" of Junagadh State dynasty. His descendants, the Babi Nawabs of Junagadh, conquered large territories in southern Saurashtra and ruled over the state for the next two centuries, first as tributaries of Marathas, and later under the Suzerainty of the British Raj. The Junagadh family shares joint descent with the princely houses of Radhanpur and Balasinor, and the small states of Bantva, Manavadar and Sardargarh. Descendents of the Ghilzai Pathans from Afghanistan, they entered India under Usman Khan Babi, a follower of Emperor Humayun. His son, Sher Khan Babi, arrived in Gujarat in the train of Prince Murad Baksh, the Imperial Viceroy. For many years, the family remained the faithful, though powerful, local fief holders of and exceptional loyalty to the Mughal power. The impending collapse of the Islamic Indian empire during the early years of the eighteenth century, prompted the family household to carve out independent Kingdoms of their own to govern, from various landholdings and governorships they held sway. Sher Khan Babi, the Chief of the family, founded the state by expelling the then Mogul Governor in 1735. Originally a Rajput domain, it fell to the Muslims commanded by Mohammed Bagra of Ahmedabad in 1472.\nSher Khan's descendent held the posts and ruled over the state for the next two centuries, for a period as tributaries of Baroda, and later it came under the Suzerainty of the British Raj. In 1807 the Junagadh State became a British protectorate and The East India Company took control of the state by 1818 and the Saurashtra area with other Princely states of Kathiawar peninsula were separately administrated under Kathiawar Agency by British India.\nIn 1947 upon the Independence of Pakistan and the Indian Transfer of Power, the last Babi dynasty ruler of the state Mohammad Mahabat Khanji III merged it into newly formed Dominion of Pakistan. Although surrounded on three sides by the Dominion of India, and on the fourth by open Arabian Sea. On 15th August it acceded to Pakistan and Pakistan Government accepted on 13th September 1947, following the Independence of the new Dominions of the Republic of India and Pakistan, the Khan Sahib Ghulam Moinuddin Khanji acceded his state of Manavadar to Pakistan, even though, being a Vassal state of Junagadh State, the prince had every right to do so. This act was done at the same time as his master, the Nawab of Junagadh who himself had the right not to accede his state to modern India, this was fully in accordance with the agreed principles for accession of Princely states. The accession not agreeable to the Indians, they applied various methods of tactic intimidation. They induced two vassal rulers to accede to their country in return for recognition as independent rulers, but even this did not last very long. Simultaneously, 'People's Committees' and the Indian National Congress party agitators were most encouraged to ferment civil unrest and create disturbances, against the new Dominion of Pakistan aimed at reducing the administration to chaos. The Nawab and his remaining family had fled to the safety fearing for their lives on the 24th October in 1947, and chose to flee to their desired country, followed shortly afterwards by his Prime Minister they all eventually settled in the port city of Karachi (then as the capital of the nation).\nIn response to this Indian armed occupying forces acted very quickly and illegally entered the abandoned state by invading it inhabitants and assumed full control on the poor defenceless people, then arranged a Referendum by the GOI under their own organised auspices and even appointed its own administrator on the 9th November. The largely Hindu population were influenced and inevitably expressed an overwhelming wish to join the India. A mere 91 voters out of 201, 457 souls taking part wanted to remain and voted in favour of Pakistan. A surprising result, given that the state had a 40% Muslim population, which was considered a Dependency to the allied country by safeguarding their rights as a minority now as the claimed Disputed territory of Pakistan. Nawab Mahabat Khan III is much maligned by modern Indian \"historians\" and popular writers, largely because of his concern for wildlife and domesticated animals, their welfare and conservation. Much is written about a marriage party that he arranged for a favourite pet dog, but the fact of matter is that Saurashtra was blessed with its only tracts of forests land because of him, was never mentioned. He took major steps and dedication to protect the dwindling Gir forests, final abode of the remaining population of the Asiatic Lions. His interests in animal husbandry improved the breeding stock of Kathiwadi horses and Gir cattle, greatly improving the milk yields of the latter. His reign saw the opening of the massive Willingdon Dam, built the Bahadur Khanji Library and opened the Mahabat Khan free college. Upon his death in 1959 the Government of Pakistan installed and recognised the Junagadh House in Karachi, 9th October 1991. The Nawab of Junagadh Foundation Trust is also located there."}

Over the years, scientists have changed their minds about which frog species should be in \"Hyla\" and which should be in \"Litoria\", \"Ranoidea\" or other genera. At one time, \"Hyla\" had more than 300 species from Europe, Asia, Africa, and across the Americas. Now, \"Hyla\" has only 17 extant (living) species. They are from Europe, northern Africa and Asia. The earliest known fossil from a \"Hyla\" frog is \u2020\"Hyla swanstoni\" from the Eocene. The fossil was found in Saskatchewan, Canada, but it is not clear whether we would consider \"swanstoni\" a \"Hyla\" frog today.\nJosephus Nicolaus Laurenti made the genus in 1768. He named it after Hylas from Greek mythology. Hylas was a friend of Hercules. Even though the mythological person Hylas was male, the name \"Hyla\" is given the feminine grammatical gender.\nSome people say this word comes from the Greek word (\"\", \"forest\" or \"wood\"), but it does not.\nMating systems.\nFemale choice based on male calling.\nIn most \"Hyla\" frogs, the male frogs sing, and then the female frogs choose which male to mate with based on their songs. But females from different species like different things about male frogs' voices. Female \"H. versicolor\", for example, choose males whose calls last longer. Female \"H. arborea\" choose males who show up to sing in the same place for many nights.\nMale-male contests.\nIn some \"Hyla\" frogs, the male frogs fight and compete. Male \"H. versicolor\" frogs show up where the females like to go. This behavior, called lekking, is common in many species of \"Hyla\". In order to sing clearly, the males need to be a certain distance apart from each other. When one male gets too close to another male's singing place, the two males may fight or do something else that is like fighting. Male \"H. versicolor\" sometimes show off to each other before they fight, so they can see whether they are likely to win first.\nIndirect selection.\nIndirect selection is when one partner chooses a mate based on just one thing that is related to how fit and healthy the mate is all together. \"H. arborea\" is a frog that is awake at night, and the females listen to the males sing and then choose one, so the frogs must be able to hear well. These frogs can also see well in low light. This ability to see may be related to how females choose males. Scientists say female \"H. arborea\" choose males with more brightly colored vocal sacs. They think colorful vocal sacs may show that the frog has enough carotenoids in the food it eats. This may mean the male frog is better at finding food than other frogs, and he might pass on some of this skill to his offspring."}

He was born in New York City. He is best known for founding the anonymous English-language imageboard 4chan in October 2003. He served as the site's head administrator for more than 11 years before stepping down in January 2015. In 2016, he began working for Google. As of 2018, he works in the company's Google Maps division, based in Tokyo.\nCareer.\n4chan.\nIn April 2009, Poole was voted the world's most influential person of 2008 by an open Internet poll conducted by \"Time\".\nOn September 12, 2009, Poole gave a talk on why 4chan has a reputation as a \"Meme Factory\" at the \"Paraflows Symposium\" in Vienna, Austria, which was part of the Paraflows 09 festival, themed Urban Hacking. In this talk, Poole mainly attributed this to the anonymous system, and to the lack of data retention on the site (\"The site has no memory\"). His talk was published in the academic reader \"Mind and Matter: Comparative Approaches towards Complexity\" (edited by G\u00fcnther Friesinger, Johannes Grenzfurthner, Thomas Ballhausen).\nOn February 10, 2010, Poole spoke at the TED2010 conference in Long Beach, California. He spoke about the increasing prevalence of persistent user identities and the sharing of personal information on sites such as Facebook and Twitter, and he also spoke about the value of anonymous posting on sites such as 4chan. Fred Leal of the Brazilian newspaper \"O Estado de S. Paulo\" said his inclusion in the conference \"indicates that something extraordinary is happening... [4chan] challenges every Internet convention: it is, alone, the antithesis of Google, social networking sites, and blogs.\"\nCanvas.\nIn 2010, Poole was reported to have raised $625,000 to create a new online enterprise, Canvas. The website opened on January 31, 2011, and featured digitally modified images uploaded by users who are required to self-identify using Facebook Connect. The enterprise ran until January 2014 when Poole announced that Canvas, and its DrawQuest feature, would be going out of business.\nPost-4chan.\nIn January 2015, Poole announced that he would be stepping down as the 4chan administrator. On January 23, he hosted a final Q&amp;A with site users using the /qa/ board and YouTube to livestream. This marked the beginning of his \"retirement\" from being an administrator and owner of the website after eleven and a half years. He began a process of turning control of the site over to three anonymous 4chan moderators while searching for a buyer for the website. On September 21, 2015, it was announced that Hiroyuki Nishimura, founder of the Japanese BBS 2channel, would take over as the site's owner."}

So it does this: inside each folder, it goes as far down into subfolders as it can. Every time it checks something to see if it matches, it will write it down on the list as \"already searched\". Then it will leave and go to the next subfolder. If there are no subfolders left, it will backtrack another step and look in the next bigger folder. It does this until it has looked through everything.\nWe know that this is the best way to make sure the search program looks through every folder and file once, and only once, because graph theory has proved it."}

She studied at the University of Marburg under philosopher Martin Heidegger and at the University of Heidelberg under philosopher Karl Jaspers. Because of her Jewish background she fled from Nazi Germany in the 1930s, and settled in the United States in 1941 (she became an American citizen in 1950).\nCareer.\nArendt was also active as a journalist and a university professor. She didn't like to be called philosopher, and also didn't like the term political philosophy. In 1959, she was the first woman to teach at Princeton University.\nBetween 1963 and 1967 she taught at University of Chicago, and from 1975 at The New School, in New York. \nArendt is best known for two major works that had a large impact: The first one is the book \"The Origins of Totalitarianism\" (published in 1951), which was a study of the Nazi and Stalin regimes. The second major work, \"The Human Condition\" (published in 1958), was a philosophical book on the human nature and human activities throughout Western history. Over the years, she published several influential essays on topics such as revolution, freedom, authority, tradition and the modern age.\nIn 1961, she attended the trial of Nazi criminal Adolf Eichmann in Israel and wrote thereafter \"Eichmann in Jerusalem\" in 1963. In this book she launches the idea which she calls \"the banality of evil\": a person accused of terrible crimes did not perform these atrocities because of an immoral conviction but as an everyday person who 'did just his job'.\nHannah Arendt died at the age of 69 in her hometown New York City."}

The symptoms are caused by the lack of those genes. \nThe symptoms often include congenital heart problems, facial features, infections, developmental delay, learning problems and cleft palate. Other conditions include kidney problems, hearing loss and autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis or Graves disease.\nDiGeorge syndrome is due to the deletion of 30 to 40 genes in the middle of chromosome 22 at a location known as \"22q11.2\". About 90% of cases occur due to a new mutation during early development, while 10% are inherited from a person's parents. \nThe condition is autosomal dominant: only one affected chromosome is needed for the condition to occur. Diagnosis is suspected based on the symptoms and confirmed by genetic testing.\nAlthough there is no cure, treatment can improve symptoms. This often includes efforts to improve the function of the many organ systems involved. Long-term outcomes depend on the symptoms present and the severity of the heart and immune system problems. With treatment, life expectancy may be normal.\nDiGeorge syndrome occurs in about 1 in 4,000 people. The syndrome was first described in 1968 by American physician Angelo DiGeorge. In late 1981, the underlying genetics were determined."}
