It was first shown on television on March 31, 1996. In the episode, Bart gets a fake driver's license and takes his friends to Knoxville, Tennessee. However, Bart's car gets destroyed and Homer must use a courier to get Bart and his friends back to Springfield. \nThe episode makes references to the movie \"Naked Lunch\", singer Andy Williams, and the \"Look\" magazine.\nStory.\nPrincipal Skinner closes the Springfield Elementary School and tells his students to go to work with your parents. Bart wants to stay at home with Marge, but he is told that housecleaning is not a real job. Instead, Bart goes to Patty and Selma's job at the DMV (department of motor vehicles). Lisa goes to Homer's job at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Bart makes a fake driver's license at the DMV and rents a car with Nelson, Milhouse, and Martin.\nBart and his friends tell their parents that they are going to Canada for a grammar competition. They instead use the rented car for a road trip to the 1982 World's Fair at Knoxville, Tennessee. However, the world fair happened 14 years ago and only a wig shop is still there. They all buy wigs and Martin uses the last money they have on a doll of Al Gore. Nelson knocks down the Sunsphere, which destroys their car. They are left being stuck in Knoxville.\nLisa uses her time during spring break at the power plant. Bart places a collect call on Lisa to help him and his friends return home without having Homer and Marge know. Bart becomes a courier but does not get enough money to go home. Principal Skinner sees Bart in Hong Kong while being a courier. Lisa makes Homer promise that he will not get angry about Bart, so she tells Homer where Bart is. Homer orders a new console for the power plant from Oak Ridge so Bart can get home. He gets it shipped near Knoxville, where Bart is still a courier. Nelson, Milhouse, and Martin hide in a crate.\nMarge does not know about any of this and gets confused when she gets phone calls on what Bart has done.\nReception.\nJohn Thorpe of \"Central Michigan Life\" called it the 8th best episode of \"The Simpsons\". Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict gave the episode a grade of B+ and thought that the best part of the episode was Patty and Selma telling Bart about their job, saying \"Somedays we don't let the line move at all. We call those weekdays.\" Robert Canning of IGN calls the episode \"outstanding\" and says that \"it's the way everything comes together that really makes it memorable.\" Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide said that he loved the children at their parents' jobs and said \"when they head out of town, the fun continues.\""}

In 2015, Prime Minister Najib Razak was accused of sending over Malaysian ringgit (about US$) from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), a government-run company that was made to develop the country's economy, to his own bank accounts. Many Malaysians called for Najib to resign because they did not want a corrupt prime minister. In 2018, Najib was defeated in an election by Mahathir Mohamad.\nA Malaysian politician, Anwar Ibrahim, has asked questions about the true purpose of 1MDB. He told Parliament that the company \"has no business address and no appointed auditor\" to check the company's finances. According to records, 1MDB has nearly RM 42\u00a0billion (US$11.73\u00a0billion) in debt.\nIntroduction.\n\"Berhad\" is a Malay word that means limited. In this case it means a limited company. That means that a company's finances are separate from those of the owners.

{"id": "777323", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=777323", "title": "Unist\u02bcot\u02bcen Camp", "text": "The Unist\u02bcot\u02bcen Camp (pronounced OO-nis-TAH-den) is a camp built on the territory of the Unist'ot\u02bcen clan of the Wet\u02bcsuwet\u02bcen Nation. It is in northern British Columbia, Canada. It is located at the point where several planned energy pipelines will pass, as a means to block the crossing of Wet\u02bcsuwet\u02bcen territory by pipeline-related industries. It is at the point where several planned energy pipelines will pass.\nThe camp is by road from Vancouver, BC and about from the town of Smithers, BC.\nThe Wet\u02bcsuwet\u02bcen have built a checkpoint some east of the camp on the Morice River Forest Services Road. At this point, visitors must have permission to enter the territory. They have banned construction workers and equipment from coming in. In 2019, the Coastal GasLink Pipeline went to court to enforce the permission granted by the Wet\u02bcsuwet\u02bcen and other First Nations band councils to build in the area. A court decision in 2020 gave an injunction against the Unis\u02bctot\u02bcen clan and its supporters. In February 2020, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) took down the blockades and checkpoints. After the RCMP's actions, there have been protests across Canada supporting the Wet\u02bcsuwet\u02bcen.\nHistory.\nThe Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en are divided into five clans. Each clan is led by a hereditary chief. Hereditary means that he or she got the position from a parent who was also a hereditary chief. These chiefs were part of a precolonial government system and are responsible for taking care of the land.\nThe Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en also have an elected council, which was created after the arrival of Europeans in Canada. These councils were created through the Indian Act and are a way for the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en to meet with the Canadian government. There is a lot of confusion on whether the chiefs or the council represent the Wet\u2019suwet\u2019en people.\nThe council approved for a pipeline to be built on Wet'suwet'en territory. However, the hereditary chiefs did not agree. The chiefs set up the camp in 2010. The area of the camp is where the pipelines are supposed to cross Talbits Kwah (Gosnell Creek). At the camp, there is a pit house, a garden, several greenhouses, a healing center, and a bunkhouse.\nIn 2015, the Unist\u02bcot\u02bcen released a declaration which included this statement:\"The Unist\u02bcot\u02bcen settlement camp is not a protest or a demonstration. Our clan is occupying and using our traditional territory as it has for centuries. Our free, prior, and informed consent protocol is in place at the entrance of our territory as an expression of our jurisdiction and our inherent right to both give and refuse consent and entry into our territory.\"\nThis quote meant that the clan can refuse to let people in because they have authority over the land as the traditional caretakers.\nHealing and learning activities take place at the camp. A healing center was built in 2015. The healing center welcomes people to reconnect with the land, learn cultural practices, and recover from health issues such as substance abuse using traditional Indigenous methods. According to the traditional beliefs of the Wet\u02bcsuwet\u02bcen people, healing can come from being connected to the land and that the impacts of colonialism, including living away from traditional territories, are harmful. A youth camp provides opportunities for young people to learn and practice their culture.\nUnist'ot\u02bcen checkpoint conflict.\nThe Wet\u02bcsuwet\u02bcen set up a checkpoint on the Morice River Forest Services Road several kilometers from the camp, controlling access to the area. The area was blocked to the pipeline project.\nIn 2018, TC Energy was granted an injunction to remove the checkpoint so they can have complete access to the pipeline project construction. In January 2019, the RCMP entered the territory to enforce the court injunction and allow workers from the Coastal GasLink pipeline project access to the area. The RCMP arrested 14 people on January 8 at the checkpoint. The pipeline workers completed their pre-construction work. Afterwards, the blockades were rebuilt.\nPeople who support of the blockade consider the action taken at the Unis\u02bctot\u02bcen checkpoint and the lack of consultation with hereditary chiefs to be violations of the United Nations' Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). Many Indigenous peoples have written and discussed the ways this action will impact the Canadian government's efforts to put in practice the recommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Report, with many famous Indigenous peoples such as broadcaster Jesse Wente, speaking at rallies and protests.\nIn December 2019, the injunction was put in place again. More discussions ended without the pipeline proponents convincing the hereditary chiefs and their supporters to withdraw. The RCMP returned to the area in 2020 and arrests began again as the RCMP cleared the Morice Forest Service Road. Supporters of the blockade remained along the road, including the camp. The arrests sparked protests in BC and across Canada in support of the Wet'suwet'en.\nStatements showing supporting the Unist\u02bcot\u02bcen Camp have been issued by organizations and institutions such as: OCAD University, the British Columbia Teachers' Federation, Ryerson University School of Social Work."}

The members of The Drasticles are two fish named Grand Maul Granny and Not Dead Ted and a krill named Johnny Krill. A British fish tells SpongeBob and Patrick that they are part of an extreme sports team. Patrick thinks that the fish said \"extreme spots\" because of the fish's lisp, so he stings himself with a jellyfish to get \"extreme spots\". Johnny Krill tells SpongeBob to get on a motorbike to see if SpongeBob can play extreme sports. Patrick sandboards down a mountain with Grand Maul Granny. Both SpongeBob and Patrick are not able to keep up with the sports and are told that the sports are too extreme for them. \nSpongeBob and Patrick try jump roping. The Drasticals show \"extreme\" jump rope by having Not Dead Ted being put on fire and having him jump to an airplane. SpongeBob tries blowing a bubble next. The Drasticals make Johnny Krill ride a motorcycle inside a bubble, which hits a building. SpongeBob tries to do boxing with a pillow and loses. Johnny puts the pillow in a washing machine and gets attacked by a mattress. Patrick shows himself dumpster diving. Grand Maul Granny shows \"extreme\" dumpster diving by having herself compacted with the waste. SpongeBob and Patrick tell The Drasticals that they like to catch jellyfish. The Drasticals try catching jellyfish and get injured and covered in spots. The British fish comes back and says that extreme spots come from extreme sports.\nReception.\nPaul Mavis of DVD Talk said that the episode \"gets big laughs from some very funny bits\" but called the \"stereotypical\" British fish \"a scream.\" Joe Corey of \"Inside Pulse\" calls the episode \"equally dangerous\" as the rest of the episodes in the \"Extreme Kah-Rah-Tay\" DVD."}

It was approved by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) and the Confederaci\u00f3n Sudamericana de F\u00fatbol (CONMEBOL). Teams from these confederations played against each other. It was usually the winners of the UEFA Champions League against the South American Copa Libertadores winners. It ran from 1960 to 2004. The FIFA Club World Cup replaced it. These cups ran at the same time from 2000 to 2004. The Intercontinal Cup was also known as European/South American Cup, or the Toyota Cup from 1980 to 2004. This was because they had an agreement with the car maker Toyota. \nBetween 1960 and 1979, the competition was two matches between the same teams. There was a playoff if the teams were level until 1968. After this date, there were penalty kicks instead. During the 1970s, the European teams were unsure about playing due to events in the 1969 final. Some European Cup-winning teams did not play. From 1980, the competition was a single match. The teams played in Japan. The sponsor was the multinational car maker Toyota. It gave a second trophy called the Toyota Cup. The organisation of the competition was then done by the Japan Football Association. UEFA and CONMEBOL continued to approve of the tournament.\nThe first winner of the cup was Spanish team Real Madrid. They beat Pe\u00f1arol of Uruguay in 1960. The last winner was Portuguese team Porto. They beat Colombian team Once Caldas in a penalty shoot-out in 2004. The competition ended in 2004. It merged with the FIFA Club World Cup in 2005.\nTrophy.\nThe competition trophy has the words \"Coupe Europ\u00e9enne-Sudamericaine\" (\"European-South American Cup\") at the top. At the bottom of the trophy, there is the round logo of UEFA and a map of South America in a circle.\nDuring the sponsorship by Toyota, the competition gave a second trophy called the \"Toyota Cup\". \nPerformances.\nThe performance of various clubs is shown in the following tables:\nMan of the Match.\nThe man of the match was selected from 1980.

Ramachandran (born 1951) is an Indian scientist and educator. He has written more than 180 scientific research papers. He co-discovered the mirror neuron, a nerve cell that helps human beings understand other human beings' actions. Richard Dawkins called him \"the Marco Polo of Neuroscience.\" \"Time\" magazine called him one of the 100 most influential people in the world.\nRamachandran is the director of the Center for Brain and Cognition at the University of California, San Diego, distinguished professor in the Psychology Department and Neurosciences Program at the University of California, San Diego, and adjunct professor of biology at the Salk Institute. He is an Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians.\nEarly life.\nRamachandran was born in Tamil Nadu, in India. His father was a diplomat. His grandfather, Alladi Krishnaswamy Iyer, helped write India's constitution. When Ramachandran was a child, he collected shells and fossils. He sent his fossils to the American Museum of Natural History. When he was an adult, the dinosaur \"Minotaurasaurus ramachandrani\" was named after him.\nCareer.\nAt first, Ramachandran learned to be a medical doctor (MBBS) at Stanley medical Collage in Madras in India. He became a research scientist later. He earned a Ph.D. at the University of Cambridge's Trinity College.\nRamachandran helped discover the mirror neuron, a type of brain cell that does not work the same way in autistic people. He also figured out how to help people with phantom pain. A person who is missing part of their body, for example a hand, may feel as if the hand is still there. They may feel hot or cold or as if their hand is closed too tight. This is called a phantom limb. They may feel pain in their hand, even though it is not there. Really, it is the brain's sensory cortex making this pain. Ramachandran figured out how to use mirrors to trick the person's brain into thinking that the limb was there and healthy, so it would stop hurting.\nV.S. Ramachandran wrote many books. The BBC made one book, \"Phantoms in the Brain\", into a mini-series.\nRamachandran also studies evolution, dinosaurs, plate tectonics, Indian art, and medicine in the 1800s.\nAwards.\nThe government of India named Ramachandran Padma Bhushan in the 2000s. This is India's third-highest honor.\nFamily.\nRamachandran married Diane Rogers-Ramachandran in 1987. She is an experimental psychologist, and she and Ramachandran have performed experiments together. They have two sons, Chandramani and Jaya."}

The most popular and ever-lasting songs during this period of music are also known as pop standards or American standards.\nAbout.\nThe works of these songwriters are usually considered part of the great pieces known as the \"Great American Songbook\". In general, the word \"standard\" means any popular song that has become very widely known within our basic culture.\n\"Traditional pop\" is now also currently used for standard music, as one category of popular music in Grammy Awards. AllMusic defines traditional pop as \"post-big band and pre-rock &amp; roll pop music.\"\nHistory.\nOn the Broadway, Tin Pan Alley, and Hollywood show in the 1930s and 1940s, a number of popular songs were written by many songwriters - such as: Irving Berlin, Frederick Loewe, Victor Herbert, Harry Warren, Harold Arlen, Jerome Kern, George Gershwin and Ira Gershwin, Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, Oscar Hammerstein, Johnny Mercer, Dorothy Fields, Hoagy Carmichael and Cole Porter.\nGood improvements were added then. These are string sections or orchestral parts and put more importance on the vocal presentation before the listenners. In this way, rich sounds of strings can be heard in much of the popular music throughout the 1940s and 1950s. Songs made by these writers became popular among people in America. Some of these are now forgotten, but others called standards by people at present time.\nIn 1960s, rock and roll appeared in music scene and became more popular than such standard music. But some singers like Frank Sinatra, Doris Day, Tony Bennett and others still remained popular on television and radio. \nHarry Nilsson recorded an album \"A Little Touch of Schmilsson In the Night\" in 1973 with orchestra by Gordon Jenkins. In 1980s, Linda Ronstadt, a popular female singer sang and recorded albums of standard songs. She performed with Nelson Riddle orchestra. Recordings by Rod Stewart's It Had to Be You: The Great American Songbook, Willie Nelson's Stardust and Carly Simon's Torch were made public. These were great successes on the music scene."}

Lakshmi Narasu", "text": "Pokala Lakshmi Narasu (1861 \u2013 14 July 1934), sometimes known as P. L. Narasu or P. Lakshmi Narasu, was an Indian scholar, author, social reformer and Buddhist philosopher. He was a professor of Physics. His research papers have been published in science journals. He worked mainly on dynamics. \nPersonal life.\nNarasu was born in 1861 to a rich family. His father was Pokla Chellum Narayanguru belongs to Kapu Community. He was a prominent lawyer at the Madras High Court. Narasu had one sister named Andal Ammal. He also had three brothers named Krishnaswamy, Ramanujan and Bhashyam. In 1911, Ramanujan and Bhashyam died in a train accident. Narasu's first wife was Rukmini Ammal. She was also active in public life through a Women\u2019s Welfare Association. \nThey had ten children, but only two survived. These two children were their son Venkat and daughter VeerLakshmi. Venkat died in Paris while he was studying. Narasu's wife died soon after. In 1925 Narasu married Ramarathnam Ammal, a widow, as per Buddhist rite in the Perambur Viyaram.\nEducation and professional life.\nNarasu studied science. He graduated from . He was the joint winner of the Jagirdar of Arni\u2019s Gold Medal of 1892-94. He joined the Madras Christian College as Assistant Professor in 1894. \nIn 1909 Narasu left Christian College. He became a full-time professor at Pachaiyappa\u2019s college. He was at the college for 16 years. Narasu retired from teaching at the college in 1925. Narasu's main interests were exact sciences, but he was also interested in society, literature, art, philosophy, history, culture and religion.\nReligious works.\nPt. Iyothee Thassar, M. Singaravelu(Father of Indian communist party) and P. L. Narasu started the South Indian Buddhist Association (Shakya Buddhist Society). This was to make Buddhism more popular. They worked with the Mahabodhi Society which Anagarik Dharmapal started in 1890. Narasu wrote several articles and books on Buddhism. The Shakya Buddhist Society used his book \"The Essence of Buddhism\" (1907) to promote their ideas. The book had in huge demand in Japan. Czechoslovakian foreign Minister Jim Mosarik translated his other book \"What is Buddhism?\" (1916) into Czech. It was regarded as a guide on Buddhism. He also wrote \"Religion of Modern Buddhist\" in the early 1930s. He also wrote a book on caste called \"A Study of Caste\" (1922). \nIn 1910, with the help of South Buddhist Association, he did a census of Buddhist people of Madras. He found there were 18,000. Narasu gave lectures at various places to promote Buddhism. He also organised four Buddhist conferences. The first was held in 1917 at Moore Pavilion People\u2019s Park in Madras. The second was in 1920 in Bangalore. The third was in Madras in 1928. The fourth one was in Bangalore Presidency, at Tirupatur Kolar Gold Field in 1932. \nP. L. Narasu had a large influence on the work of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, who revived Buddhism in India. He also republished (published again) his most famous book \"The Essence of Buddhism\" in 1948. He also wrote a preface to it. In the preface of the book he recommended the book for those who are interested in the study of Buddhism.\nViews.\nThoughts on caste.\nCaste is a crippling disease. The physician\u2019s duty is to guard against disease or destroy it. Caste organization crushes the individual under its dead weight and hinders progress by killing all consciousness of liberty.\nThoughts on women.\nThough perfectly consistent with the principles of the Dhamma, which sees no difference between man and man, except that which may exist by superiority of virtue, yet the step taken by the Buddha and his followers was indeed bold, considering the depraved moral condition of Ancient India and the consequent low self-estimation in which woman was then held. \nThoughts on Science: The scientific method is at once experimental and rational, requiring such evidence as will make doubt impossible. Science aims at obtaining a complete systematic survey of all possible phenomena in terms of irreducible elementary processes. Knowledge that is not scientific is not to establish immutable truths and eternal dogmas, but to approach truth by approximations.\nDeath.\nProf. P. L. Narasu passed away at the age of seventy-three on 14 July 1934, due to heart problems. His body was cremated in a simple Buddhist ceremony in the Mylapore burning-yard.\nWriting.\nNarasu wrote many books especially in English. His books have been translated into many languages."}

It was directed by Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s. In Britain it was released as The Infernal Cauldron and in the United States as The Infernal Caldron and the Phantasmal Vapors. It was released by M\u00e9li\u00e8s's Star Film Company and is numbered 499\u2013500 in its catalogues.\nPlot.\nIn a Renaissance chamber decorated with devilish faces and a warped coat of arms, a gleeful Satan throws three human victims into a cauldron, which spews out flames. The victims rise from the cauldron as nebulous ghosts, and then turn into fireballs. The fireballs multiply and pursue Satan around the chamber. Finally Satan himself leaps into the infernal cauldron, which gives off a final burst of flame.\nVersions.\nThe movies Meli\u00e8s did before 1903 were often pirated by American producers. This is especially true for his popular movie \"A Trip to the Moon\". To fight against this product piracy, M\u00e9li\u00e8s opened an American branch of his Star Film Company. He began producing two negatives of each movie he made: one for home markets, and one for foreign release. To produce the two separate negatives, M\u00e9li\u00e8s built a special camera that used two lenses and two reels of film.\nIn the 2000s, researchers at the French film company Lobster Films noticed that M\u00e9li\u00e8s's two-lens system was a fully functional, stereo film camera. 3D versions of Meli\u00e8' movies could e made by combining the domestic and foreign prints of the film. Serge Bromberg, the founder of Lobster Films, presented 3D versions of \"The Infernal Cauldron\" and another 1903 M\u00e9li\u00e8s film, \"The Oracle of Delphi\", at a January 2010 presentation at the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise. According to the film critic Kristin Thompson, \"the effect of 3D was delightful \u2026 the films as synchronized by Lobster looked exactly as if M\u00e9li\u00e8s had designed them for 3D.\" Bromberg screened both films again\u2014as well as the 1906 M\u00e9li\u00e8s film \"The Mysterious Retort\", similarly prepared for 3D\u2014at a September 2011 presentation at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences."}

The season had a record-breaking 12 storms that hit the U.S, with many making landfall in Louisiana. The season had had thirty-one tropical or subtropical cyclones, thirty named storms, fourteen hurricanes, and seven major hurricanes. It had over twenty tropical storms that broke formation date records. The season happened during the COVID-19 pandemic, making it harder to evacuate and give help to people who needed it. \nSeason summary.\nThe season had 30 named storms and one that wasn't named because it wasn't strong enough.\nStorms.\nTropical Storm Arthur.\nTropical Storm Arthur was an early storm. It formed on May 16 from a stormy area near Cuba, and caused damage in Florida, North Carolina, and South Carolina, as well as The Bahamas and Bermuda. Even though the storm was somewhat strong, it only lasted three days.\nTropical Storm Bertha.\nTropical Storm Bertha was an early storm as well. While it only lasted one day, it caused some damage in The Bahamas and Southern United States. It also led to the Crew Dragon Demo-2 flight being delayed.\nTropical Storm Cristobal.\nTropical Storm Cristobal was the earliest third named storm on record. The storm had formed from clouds left-over by Tropical Storm Amanda. The storm formed in the Bay of Campeche, devastated Mexico, and stalled, before hitting Louisiana. The storm then traveled up to Wisconsin, as a weaker tropical depression, before becoming post-tropical.\nTropical Storm Dolly.\nTropical Storm Dolly was a short-lived storm. It formed on June 22 as a subtropical system, becoming tropical on June 23, as it reached tropical storm status, and dissipated on June 24.\nTropical Storm Edouard.\nTropical Storm Edouard formed in an unusual time of the year, in July. It formed on July 4, and reached tropical storm status on July 6. After reaching tropical storm status, it became the earliest fifth named storm until Hurricane Elsa formed on July 1, 2021.\nTropical Storm Fay.\nEarliest sixth named storm. Tropical Storm Fay formed off the coast of the Carolinas and then struck New Jersey as a tropical storm, weakening inland. \nTropical Storm Gonzalo.\nEarliest seventh named storm. Nearly made a landfall in Guyana. \nHurricane Hanna.\nIn July 23, Hanna formed in the Gulf of Mexico, from a tropical wave. On July 24, it reached tropical storm status, becoming the earliest named eighth storm. The storm rapidly strengthened, becoming a hurricane on July 25. It then before hitting Texas later that day. The damage was bad, as a pandemic was growing at that time.\nHurricane Isaias.\nIsaias was a bad storm. It hit the Bahamas, before moving up the east coast of the United States, making landfall in North Carolina. Before the storm formed, it was broad and disorganized, but upon being named on July 30, Isaias became the earliest ninth named storm ever recorded. It then moved up into the Dominican Republic, and then into the Bahamas. It then traveled off the coast of the United States, and hit North Carolina. Isaias caused over $4.2 billion dollars worth of damage.\nTropical Depression Ten.\nTropical depression Ten formed on July 31, but failed to strengthen due to harsh conditions. The storm moved slowly, and dissipated on August 2. Some tropical storm force winds were found in the center of the system by the National Hurricane Center, but they said it was bloated. \nTropical Storm Josephine.\nEarliest tenth named storm.\nTropical Storm Kyle.\nEarliest eleventh named storm, breaking the record of Hurricane Katrina.\nHurricane Laura.\nOn August 20, a tropical wave organized into a tropical depression. The next day, the depression, which was originally disorganized, strengthened into Tropical Storm Laura. Upon reaching tropical storm status, it became the earliest twelfth tropical storm in the Atlantic. The system then passed over the Leeward Islands, passing south of Puerto Rico. The system made landfall on the Dominican Republic, but the system had not lost any strength, despite the mountainous terrain. The system then made landfall in Cuba twice, before becoming a hurricane over the Gulf of Mexico on August 24. The storm underwent rapid intensification, becoming a category 2 hurricane on August 25. Laura became a major hurricane (Category 3) 9 hours later. The storm then became a Category 4 six hours later. Its highest winds were 150 mph. The storm hit Louisiana around that time. After going over Louisiana, the system quickly weakened, and lost its life over Kentucky.\nIn Louisiana, buildings were damaged very badly by the storm. The highest winds were reported at 95 miles per hour in Lake Charles, along with a gust of 137 miles per hour also in Lake Charles. Damage was the worst in Lake Charles, where almost every house had a tarp on it to keep out rain after their roofs had been destroyed. Luckily, even though a push of water was suppose to be more than 15 feet in places, at last minute, it moved to the west, pushing all the water into places with less people.\nHurricane Marco.\nEarliest thirteenth named storm.\nTropical Storm Omar.\nEarliest fifteenth named storm. Very unusual track.\nHurricane Nana.\nEarliest fourteenth named storm. Formed after Omar, but strengthened into a tropical storm before Omar.\nHurricane Paulette.\nEarliest sixteenth named storm. It then made a very rare landfall in Bermuda, and then dissipated. After it dissipated, it became a tropical storm again. Because of this, people called it a \"zombie storm,\" because it came back after dissipating. \nTropical Storm Rene.\nEarliest seventeenth named storm. \nHurricane Sally.\nEarliest eighteenth named storm.\nHurricane Teddy.\nEarliest nineteenth named storm. This storm formed and eventually became a category 4, before weakening and hitting Newfoundland with winds 65 mph. \nTropical Storm Vicky.\nEarliest twentieth named storm.\nTropical Storm Beta.\nEarliest twenty-third named storm.\nTropical Storm Wilfred.\nEarliest twenty-first named storm.\nSubtropical Storm Alpha.\nEarliest twenty-second named storm. Made an extremely rare landfall in mainland Europe. Made 2020 only the second season to use the Greek Alphabet.\nHurricane Gamma.\nEarliest twenty-fourth named storm.\nHurricane Delta.\nEarliest twenty-fifth named storm. Made landfall in Louisiana as a Category 2, causing catastrophic damage.\nHurricane Epsilon.\nEarliest twenty-sixth named storm. Fourth major hurricane of the season.\nHurricane Zeta.\nEarliest twenty-seventh named storm. Caused damage in the Southeast United States. Brought snow to New England.\nHurricane Eta.\nEarliest twenty-eight named storm. Became a powerful Category 4 hurricane. Struck Central America, Cuba, and Florida.\nTropical Storm Theta.\nOn November 10, Subtropical Storm Theta formed, making the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season the busiest Atlantic hurricane season on record. The next day, the storm transitioned into a tropical storm, as it peaked with winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h). The storm then weakened, but restrengthened to reach 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km/h), before weakening, and eventually dissipating on July 15.\nHurricane Iota.\nHurricane Iota was a deadly and damaging storm that hit Central America on November 17. Forming in the Caribbean Sea, the storm strengthened a lot rapidly, becoming one of the latest Category 4 storms to form, reaching Category 4 status on November 16.\nSeason effects.\nThis is a table of all the storms that have formed in the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their duration, names, landfall(s), denoted in parentheses, damages, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a tropical wave, or a low, and all the damage figures are in USD. Potential tropical cyclones are not included in this table.\n \n "}

Ettore Majorana, an Italian physicist, thought they would exist, in 1937. Majorana disappeared in 1938, and the particles are named after him. As Majorana fermionns are thought to have the same properties as their antiparticles, they cannot have an electric charge. Today, atomic particles with an electric charge are called Dirac fermions. An example for Dirac fermions are electrons, and positrons; they have the same properties, but their electric charge is different. \nNeutrinos do not have an electric charge, and might be Majorana fermions, but their status is unclear\nTheory.\nThe concept goes back to Majorana's suggestion of 1937. Majorana suggested that neutral spin- particles can be described by a real wave equation (the Majorana equation). The wave functions of particle and antiparticle are related by complex conjugation. For this reason, they would be identical to their antiparticle.\nThe difference between Majorana fermions and Dirac fermions can be expressed mathematically in terms of the creation and annihilation operators of second quantization: The creation operator formula_1 creates a fermion in quantum state formula_2 (described by a \"real\" wave function), whereas the annihilation operator formula_3 annihilates it (or, equivalently, creates the corresponding antiparticle). For a Dirac fermion the operators formula_1 and formula_3 are distinct, whereas for a Majorana fermion they are identical. The ordinary fermionic annihilation and creation operators formula_6 and formula_7 can be written in terms of two Majorana operators formula_8 and formula_9 by\nIn supersymmetry models, neutralinos\u2014superpartners of gauge bosons and Higgs bosons\u2014are Majorana.\nStandard model of particle physics.\nThe standard model of physics has no Majorana fermions, all particles are Dirac fermions. There are neutrinos, and anti-neutrinos. In the standard model, neutrinos have no mass, though. The question how to differentiate between neutrinos and anti-neutrinos is not settled yet.\nExtensions to the standard model.\nThere are different extensions of the standard model. One of them is called Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model. It allows for supersymmetry, and can transform one kind of particle, the bosons, into the other, the fermions. In condensed matter physics, bound Majorana fermions can appear as quasiparticle excitations\u2014the collective movement of several individual particles, not a single one, and they are governed by non-abelian statistics."}

It is used for \"divinity\", a \"divine presence\" or a \"divine will.\" The Latin authors defined it as follows. Cicero writes of a \"divine mind\" (\"divina mens\"), a god \"whose numen everything obeys,\" and a \"divine power\" (\"vis divina\") \"which pervades the lives of men.\" It causes the motions and cries of birds during augury. In his Aeneid, Virgil tells about the how the one-eyed giant, Polyphemus, is blinded: First, Odysseus and his men \"ask for the assistance of the great numina\" (\"magna precati numina\"). Reviewing public opinion of Augustus on the day of his funeral, the historian Tacitus reports that some thought \"no honor was left to the gods\" when he \"established the cult of himself\" (\"se ... coli vellet\") \"with temples and the effigies of numina\" (\"effigie numinum\"). Pliny the younger in a letter to Paternus raves about the \"power,\" the \"dignity,\" and \"the majesty;\" in short, the \"\"numen\" of history.\" Lucretius uses the expression \"numen mentis\", or \"bidding of the mind,\" where \"bidding\" is \"numen\", not, however, the divine numen, unless the mind is to be considered divine, but as simply human will.\nSince the early 20th century, numen has sometimes been treated in the history of religion as a pre-animistic phase. This is a belief system that comes from an earlier time. Sociologists also use the term \"Numen\" to refer to the idea of magical power coming from an object, particularly when writing about ideas in the western tradition. When used in this sense, \"numen\" means almost the same thing as \"mana\". However, some authors only use the word \"mana\" for ideas about magic from Polynesia and Southeast Asia.\nEtymology.\nThe literal meaning is simply \"a nod\", or more accurately,\"that which is produced by nodding\". In the same way, \"flamen\" is \"that which is produced by blowing\", \"i.e.\", a gust of wind. It came to mean \"the product or expression of power\" \u2014 not, be it noted, power itself.\"Numen\" (divinity) is not personified (although it can be a personal attribute) and should be distinguished from \"deus\" (god).\nRoman cults of the numina.\nNumen was also used in the imperial cult of ancient Rome, to refer to the guardian-spirit, 'godhead' or divine power of a living emperor. It was a way of worshiping a living emperor without literally calling him a god.\nThe cult of Augustus was promoted by Tiberius, who dedicated the \"Ara Numinis Augusti\".\nIn this context, a distinction can be made between the terms \"numen\" and \"genius\".\nDefinition as a pre-animistic phase of religion.\nThe expression \"Numen inest\" appears in Ovid's \"Fasti\" (III, 296) and has been translated as 'There is a spirit here'. Its interpretation, and the exact sense of \"numen\" has been discussed extensively in the literature.\nSome people thought, that numen could have been a leftover of ealier animist religions which was incorporated into the Roman religion. Sometimes the etymology of Latin names for deities, has often been popularly implied, but it was criticised as \"mostly a scholarly fiction\" by McGeough (2004).\nNumina and specific religions.\nThe phrase \"numen eris caeloque redux mirabere regna\" appears on line 129 of the poem \"Metrum in Genesin\", attributed to Hilary of Arles.\nIn popular culture.\nIn modern times, the term (referring to the Christian God) has been used in various expressions:"}

In this case, it refers to the ability of the M\u0101ori people (the indigenous people of New Zealand) to rule themselves and be recognized as the owners of the land. \"\"Tino rangatiratanga\" shows up in the M\u0101ori version of the Treaty of Waitangi, which they signed with the British in 1840. They were promised that they would have \"tino rangatiratanga\" forever in the treaty. However, this concept was not respected since the British colonizers took a lot of things from the M\u0101ori people. To this day, people in New Zealand do not agree on what \"tino rangatiratanga\" means or what kind of things it is supposed to cover.\nOrigin.\nA \"rangatira\" is a chief in the M\u0101ori culture. The suffix -tanga is added so \"rangatiratanga\" refers to the qualities of being a chief. \"Tino\"\" is a M\u0101ori word that means \"most\" or \"absolute.\" So by using this term, the British were allowing Maori chiefs to have complete control and allow them to use their powers as chiefs.\nSome people think that the term can be used to describe self-determination, autonomy, or M\u0101ori independence.\nHere are the meaning of the terms from an online M\u0101ori dictionary:\nTreaty.\nThere is a lot of confusion about the Treaty of Waitangi because Articles 1 and 2 in the treaty say different things.\nAccording to the M\u0101ori version of the treaty, Article 1 is talking about \"kawanatanga\" (governorship) while Article 2 is talking about \"tino rangatiratanga\" (absolute chieftainship). To them, these are two totally different concepts. Therefore, they believe that they never gave away their land rights and ability to rule themselves. In fact, a tribunal that was created to focus on the Treaty of Waitangi said that the M\u0101ori can never give up those rights and never did.\nFlag.\nThere is a Tino rangatiratanga flag that is used to represent the M\u0101ori people. It is red, white, and black. It was designed by M\u0101ori artists Hiraina Marsden, Jan Smith and Linda Munn in 1990 as part of a contest.\nA woman named Poua Erstich came up with the meaning for the flag. The red represents the sky, the black is earth, and the white is light separating the sky and earth. The flag is supposed to show the M\u0101ori story of how the world was created.\nThis flag is flown next to the flag of New Zealand to show people that the land still belongs to the M\u0101ori. Sometimes, this flag is used in protests to show how certain issues are affecting M\u0101ori."}

They may be stopped by the courts or the legislature if they are against laws or against the constitution. \nHowever, in countries where there is no real separation of powers and the head of state is actually a dictator, the executive order cannot be stopped by the courts or the legislature, which as a result have no powers and are controlled by him. In many cases, the head of state with dictatorial powers often rules the country by making executive orders rather than making laws in the legislature which he also controls.\nExecutive orders have a big effect on the internal affairs of the government and on the citizens. They decide how and to what degree legislation will be enforced. They also deal with emergencies and wars."}

They are often noted as an important historical piece in America. In May 2015 the original lyrics written by himself was sold in market publicly (at an auction).

On May 5, 2009 Azerbaijani president Ilham Aliyev, who is also the chairman of the National Olympic Committee, signed an executive order starting a state-supported chess development program, covering the years 2009\u20132014.\nHistory of chess in Azerbaijan.\nChess may be found in the works of 12th century Persian poets such as Khaqani and Nizami, who lived in modern-day Azerbaijan, and also in the works of 16th century Azerbaijani writer and poet Fuzuli and others. Azerbaijani writer and philosopher Mirza Fatali Akhundov explained the rules of chess in his 1864 poem \"The Game of Shatranj\".\nAzerbaijan as a member of the USSR.\nOrganized chess began in Azerbaijan shortly after the creation of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic in 1920, and the game soon became widespread. The first chess column appeared in the newspaper \"Bakinsky Rabochy\" in the early 1920s. In 1923 the first Baku championship took place.\nOn May 2\u20133, 1929, a match between teams from Baku and Tbilisi, the capital of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, was held on 8 boards in Baku.\nIn 1934 the first Azerbaijani Championship took place. This was won by Selimkhanov, who in 1935 became chairman of the Azerbaijan Chess Organization. In 1936 the first Women's Championship was held. In 1936, A. Polisskaya of Baku became women's champion of the South Caucasus. In 1938, a women's chess school was opened at the Baku Chess and Checkers Club.\nHowever, these chess championships at the local and national level were not held every year and the World War II, disrupted the chess tournaments and activities. But since 1947 chess championships have been held every year.\nModern times.\nAfter Azerbaijan gained its independence after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Azerbaijani chess players have achieved high results in various international competitions, World and European championships. In 1992, the national team of women for the first time at the World Chess Olympiad in Manila, Philippines represented independent Azerbaijan and ranked 7th among 67 teams. The women team won bronze medals at the European Championship held in Debrecen, Hungary in 1993. The national team of men won bronze medals in 2007 in European Championship held in Greece. Men's team won the title of \u201cEurope\u2019s strongest team\u201d in Serbia in 2009, then won silver medals in 2011 in Greece and in 2013 in Poland. In 2012 and 2014, the men's team \u201cSOCAR-Azerbaijan\u201d won the inter-club European Championships twice. Azerbaijani Grandmasters Shahriyar Mammadyarov, Teymur Radjabov and Vugar Hashimov managed to rise to the 4th and 6th places in the world rankings.\nGrandmaster Teymur Radjabov became the first owner of the World Chess Cup in the history of Azerbaijan on October 4, 2019, in Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia."}

The Governor of Beirut, Marwan Abboud, said over 300,000 people lost their homes.\nIt is said that the explosion may have been caused by 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate. Ammonium nitrate is a chemical substance that can be used for fertilizer. It can also be used to make explosives. The government took the ammonium nitrate from a ship in the port of Damascus, the MV Rhosus. The MV Rhosus had been abandoned in the port, after the Lebanese government said it was no longer fit to travel by sea. The ammonium nitrate was then stored in the port, for at least six years. This may have been without the proper precautions. There are various regulations how ammonium nitrate should be stored, and handled. In its pure form, ammonium nitrate does not burn; but it increases fires a great deal. It should therefore not be stored near flammable substances, and it should not be heated in a closed space. It is also very sensitive to temperature.\nBefore the big explosion, here seems to have been a fire in a part of the warehouse, where fireworks were stored. The ammonium nitrate was stored in the same building.\nThe explosion has been compared to three thousand tonnes of TNT.\nSome countries offered medical aid, rescue teams and money to help deal with the aftermath of the disaster."}

Old writings from ancient Greece talk about orichalcum and the Romans made coins out of a metal they called orichalcum, but they might not have been the same metal. People today are not sure exactly what it was. Some scholars think orichalcum was the ancient Greek name for platinum. Others think it was an alloy, or mixture, of copper and either gold, tin, or zinc. Scientists examined Roman coins and found a mixture of copper and zinc.\nName.\nThe name \"orichalcum\" is from the Greek word for \"mountain copper\" or \"mountain metal.\"\nSome people think name \"aurichalcum\" comes from the word \"aurum\" for \"gold,\" but it does not.\nGreek orichalcum.\nIn general, when ancient Greek writers wrote about orichalcum, they said it was a metal that looked like gold but that they did not know much else about it. To Homer, Hesiod and Plato, orichalcum was a metal from much earlier times that did not exist in their own time and place.\nIn one of the Homeric Hymns, Homer writes about orichalcum earrings. He says the goddess Aphrodite wears them. Hesiod writes about orichalcum greaves, which are leg armor. Neither writer was talking about his own time and place.\nPlato wrote about orichalcum in his book \"Critias\". In the book, Plato says orichalchum was in the ground of the legendary island of Atlantis. To the Atlanteans, it was the second-most-valuable metal, after gold. Plato says the Atlanteans put orichalcum on their city walls and temples. Plato calls orichalcum \"only a name\" in his own time, meaning he did not think he had ever seen orichalcum.\nRoman orichalcum.\nThe ancient Romans also had a metal that they called orichalcum. Around the time the Roman Republic ended and the Roman Empire started, the Romans stopped making coins out of bronze and started making them out of orichalcum: asses coins, sestertii coins, dupondii coins and semisses coins.\nRoman orichalcum does corrode over time, the way iron rusts and silver tarnishes.\nMaking orichalcum.\nScientists analyzed Roman coins and saw they were made of copper and zinc. During the early days of the Roman Empire, Romans invented a better way to make zinc-copper alloys. This way is called cementation. To do it, the metalworker has to heat the zinc and copper to exactly the correct temperature. Then there can be as much as 30% zinc in the orichalcum.\nIn fiction.\nOrichalcum appears in many works of fiction, especially stories about Atlantis. It is in television shows, for example \"The Mysterious Cities of Gold\" and \"\". It is in video games, for example \"Castlevania: Curse of Darkness\" and \"Elder Scrolls\"."}

There is a relationship between the energy that an organism uses and the amount eaten. Eating more leads to weight gaining and often obesity. It may be regarded as an eating disorder.\nOne consequence of overeating is weight gain, and excess weight may cause blood pressure to rise. In turn this makes illness and even death more likely.\nThe problem is very difficult to reverse: losing weight is often attempted, but rarely succeeds. Weight lost is usually rapidly replaced. Diets are famously unsuccessful. Obesity is the end product of overeating.\nSome difficult facts are known. Poorer families tend to eat worse food than better-off families. Children learn from the experiences in their families. Once established, habits are hard to break. In 2013, several medical societies, including the American Medical Association and the American Heart Association, classified obesity as a disease."}

Bova after allegedly speeding and running red lights while driving his wife, who was in labor, to the hospital. His wife later sued Los Angeles for wrongful death, and was represented by Johnnie Cochran, but lost the case. However, Deadwyler's death inspired the building of Martin Luther King, Jr. Community Hospital in South Central.\nLife.\nDeadwyler was born on February 19, 1941 in Gainesville, Georgia. He was the oldest of three children. He met his wife Barbara (nee, Buffington) in Kindergarten and they married in 1960. Shortly after, they moved to Kansas then Chattanooga, Tennessee and finally, Los Angeles. The Deadwylers had two children together. At the time of his death, Barbara Deadwyler was pregnant with their youngest son, Michael.\nShooting.\nBarbara Deadwyler, Leonard's wife was 8 months pregnant and began experiencing what she believed to be labor pains. Deadwyler tied a white handkerchief to the car's antenna, to signify an emergency, a common sign in Georgia, where the couple had moved from a year earlier. While driving, Deadwyler ran through several red lights while speeding, causing a police chase that began at 108th St. and Avalon Blvd., which he mistook as a police escort. Bova eventually pulled the car over at 60th St. and Avalon, where he approached Deadwyler with his gun drawn and leaned into the car. Bova testified that the car lurched forward, causing his gun to go off and shoot Deadwyler at point blank range. Deadwyler's wife stated that no such movement had taken place and that Bova \"shot him for no reason.\"\nInvestigation and inquest.\nDuring testimony, the State proffered that Deadwyler had a .35 blood-alcohol level and was drunk. His widow refuted this, as he had not been drinking and an alcohol level that high would make it very difficult for an individual to function and drive safely at a high speed. Bova testified that the car had lurched forward while the defense argued that it would be near impossible as the car had been parked behind another vehicle.\nOn May 31st, 1966 a coroner's jury ruled Deadwyler's death an accidental homicide, with one juror calling it an \"excusable homicide.\" The jury, who deliberated for two hours and thirty-five minutes consisted of eight men and one female. Only one member of the jury was black.\nAt the time, it was the longest inquest over the death of a single individual in the Los Angeles County Coroner's office lasting eight days with testimony from 49 witnesses and 87 exhibits and the first televised inquest in California."}

It is the former residence of the Bishop of Durham. University College, Durham is there since 1837. \nTogether with Durham Cathedral, the castle is a World Heritage Site in England since 1986. It is open to the general public to visit through guided tours.\nHistory.\nThe construction of the Castle began in 1072. It follows the usual Norman style. It was built by order of William the Conqueror about six years after the Norman conquest of England, and soon after the Normans first came to the North. The building took place under the supervision of Waltheof, Earl of Northumbria. Stone for the new buildings was cut from the cliffs below the walls and moved up using winches.\nThe Castle remained the bishop's palace for the Bishop of Durham until Auckland Castle became the bishops' residence in 1832. Durham Castle was donated to the University of Durham by Bishop William Van Mildert and later become the college. The college did not occupy the castle until 1837, renovations of the building was completed by the next Bishop, Edward Maltby.\nChapels.\nThe Norman Chapel is the oldest accessible part of the castle built in about 1078. Its architecture is Anglian in nature, possibly due to forced Anglian labour being used to build it. In the 15th century, its three windows were all but blocked up because of the expanded keep. It then fell into abandonment until 1841 when it was used as a corridor through which to access the keep. \nDuring the Second World War, it was used as a command and observation post for the Royal Air Force when its original use was recognised. \nThe chapel was re-consecrated shortly after the war and is still used for weekly services by the college.\nTunstall's Chapel, named after Cuthbert Tunstall, was built in the 15th century and is used for worship within the college. It was modified in the 17th Century by Bishop Cosin. "}

After the end of the monasteries in 1539 by Henry VIII, the Abbey buildings and over 500 acres (200 ha) of land were sold by the Crown to a merchant named Sir Richard Gresham. The property was passed down through several generations of Sir Gresham's family. Between 1598 and 1604, it was sold to Stephen Proctor, who built Fountains Hall. \nThe hall is a Jacobean mansion, built partly with stone from the Abbey ruins. Fountains Abbey mill is the only 12th-century Cistercian cornmill left in the UK and the oldest 'intact' building on the estate.\nStudley estate.\nFrom 1452 onwards, Studley Royal was inhabited by the Mallory family, most notably by MPs John Mallory and William Mallory. John Aislabie inherited the Studley estate from his elder brother in 1693.

He was the only English aristocrat to be executed during the reign of William I.\nEarly life.\nWaltheof was the second son of Siward, Earl of Northumbria. His mother was Aelfflaed, daughter of Ealdred, Earl of Bernicia, son of Uhtred, Earl of Northumbria. In 1054, Waltheof became the heir of his father's throne as his elder brother Osbearn was killed in battle. Siward died in 1055, and Waltheof being far too young to succeed as Earl of Northumbria, King Edward appointed Tostig Godwinson to the earldom.\nFirst revolt.\nWhen Sweyn II invaded Northern England in 1069, Waltheof and Edgar Aetheling joined the Danes and took part in the attack on York. He would again make a fresh submission to William after the departure of the invaders in 1070. He was restored to his earldom and went on to marry William's niece, Judith of Lens. In 1072, he was appointed Earl of Northampton.\nWaltheof had many enemies in the north. Amongst them were members of a family who had killed Waltheof's maternal great-grandfather, Uchtred the Bold, and his grandfather Ealdred. This was part of a long-running blood feud. In 1074, Waltheof moved against the family by sending his retainers to ambush them and succeeded in killing the two eldest of four brothers in the family. \nSecond revolt and death.\nIn 1075 Waltheof joined the Revolt of the Earls against William I. His motives for taking part in the revolt are unclear, as is the depth of his involvement. However he repented, confessing his guilt first to Archbishop Lanfranc and then in person to William I, who was at the time in Normandy. He returned to England with William but was arrested, brought twice before the king's court and sentenced to death.\nCult of martyrdom.\nIn 1092, after a fire in the chapter house, the abbot had Waltheof's body moved to a prominent place in the abbey church. When the coffin was opened, it is reported that the corpse was found to be intact with the severed head re-joined to the trunk. This was regarded as a miracle, and the abbey began to publicise it. As a result, pilgrims began to visit Waltheof's tomb. He was celebrated on 31 August.\nDue to the beliefs in the miracle, Waltheof became the subject of popular media. His heroic yet often inaccurate accounts were preserved in the \"Vita et Passio Waldevi comitis\", a Middle English \"Waltheof saga,\" and the Anglo-Norman \"Waldef\".\nPersonal life.\nIn 1070 Waltheof married Judith de Lens, daughter of Lambert II, Count of Lens and Adelaide of Normandy, Countess of Aumale. They had three children, the eldest of whom, Maud, brought the earldom of Huntingdon to her second husband, David I of Scotland, and another, Adelise (Alice of Nothumbria) married the Anglo-Norman noble Raoul III of Tosny.\nOne of Waltheof's grandsons was Waltheof (died 1159), abbot of Melrose."}

It is considered to be the \"finest examples of late 13th century and early 14th century military architecture in Europe\".\nHistory.\nFor the 20th century, the castles and walls were mainly known for their military purpose. It is described as the \"zenith of English castle-building\" by D. J. Cathcart King. It is because of the use of concentric defences, barbicans, and substantial gatehouses. Also, Sidney Toy considers them as \"some of the most powerful castles of any age or country\". \nIn the late 20th and 21st centuries, historians such as Michael Prestwich and Abigail Wheatley both appreciate its roles as palaces and symbols of royal power. \nThe location of the castles in Caernarfon and Conwy were chosen for their political significance and their military uses. The castles include luxury apartments and gardens. Caernarfon's castle and town walls had expensive stonework. They were perhaps made to suggest images of Arthurian or Roman imperial power. They are believed to have been made to improve Edward's personal prestige. \nThe exact role of the royal architect James of St George in the construction is still being argued by many academics. The same with the influence of his native county of Savoy on the designs. However, the main sources indicate that he played a key role in its construction. They even described him as: \u201cMagistro Jacobo de sancto Georgio, Magistro operacionum Regis in Wallia\u201d. It means \u201cMaster James of Saint George, Master of the King\u2019s Works in Wales.\u201d\nRecognition.\nIn 1986 sites were collectively announced a UNESCO World Heritage site. Together, they were called the \"Castles and Town Walls of King Edward in Gwynedd\". \nUNESCO considered the sites to be the \"finest examples of late 13th century and early 14th century military architecture in Europe\". UNESCO also brings up the importance of their links to Edward I and James of St George, their scale and advanced military architecture, and their unusually good condition and historical documentation. \nMaintenance costs.\nThe estimated costs to maintain the sites is around \u00a3239,500 during 2002\u201303. \"Buffer zones\" have been established around the sites. They are aimed to protect the views and setting from inappropriate development or harm. The sites are protected by a mixture of UK Scheduled Monument, Listed Building and conservation area legislation."}
{"id": "779469", "revid": "215016", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=779469", "title": "Fountains Abbey", "text": "Fountains Abbey is one of the largest and best preserved ruined Cistercian monasteries in England. It is sits approximately south-west of Ripon in North Yorkshire. It was founded in 1132 and operated for 407 years. It one of the wealthiest monasteries in England until it was dissolved in 1539, under the order of Henry VIII.\nIt is a Grade I listed building owned by the National Trust. It is part of the designated Studley Royal Park including the Ruins of Fountains Abbey. It is one of the recognised World Heritage Site by UNESCO.\nFoundation.\nAfter a riot in 1132 at the Benedictine abbey of St Mary's in York, 13 monks were expelled. Among them was Saint Robert of Newminster. They were taken under the protection of Thurstan, Archbishop of York. He provided them with land in the valley of the River Skell, which is a tributary of the Ure. The enclosed valley had all the natural features needed for the creation of a monastery. It provided shelter from the weather as well as stone and timber for building. It also had a good supply of running water. \nAfter a harsh winter in 1133, the monks applied to join the Cistercian order. At that time, it was a fast-growing reform movement. By the beginning of the 13th century, it had over 500 houses. In 1135, Fountains became the second Cistercian house in northern England, just after Rievaulx. \nThe Fountains monks were under Clairvaux Abbey, in Burgundy. It was under the rule of St Bernard. Under the guidance of Geoffrey of Ainai, a monk sent in from Clairvaux, the group learned how to celebrate the seven Canonical Hours. According to Cistercian usage, they were shown how to construct wooden buildings in accordance with Cistercian architecture.\nArchitecture.\nThe abbey precinct covers and is surrounded by an wall. The wall was built in the 13th century. Some parts of it are visible to the south and west of the abbey. \nThe precinct can be divided into different groups of buildings. The central group is the abbey church, the cloister, and the buildings round the cloister. This was where the monks lived, prayed, ate, slept, and worked. The \"inner court\" has other buildings for the daily life of the abbey. These are buildings such as the infirmary, the abbot's house, and guest houses for visitors. The infirmary was a place where monks could stay when they were ill.\nThe \"outer court\" had buildings for farming and industry, such as the watermill and the wool house. Over the years Fountains Abbey became very rich, mostly by selling wool. \nThe original abbey church was built of wood and \"was probably\" two stories high. It was, however, quickly replaced with stone. The church was damaged in the attack on the abbey in 1146 and was rebuilt as a larger church on the same site. Building work was completed c.1170. This second church was completed around 1170. It was long , made up of 11 bays. The infirmary (marked \"Abbots House\" on the plan) had one of the largest halls in England in the middle ages , It had its own chapel and kitchens. Parts of it are on top of tunnels where the River Skell flows.\nBecoming a World Heritage Site.\nThe archaeological excavation of the site began under the supervision of John Richard Walbran. In 1846, he published a paper \"On the Necessity of clearing out the Conventual Church of Fountains\". In 1966, the Abbey was placed in the guardianship of the Department of the Environment and the estate. It was purchased by the West Riding County Council, which later transferred its ownership to the North Yorkshire County Council in 1974. \nThe National Trust bought the Fountains Abbey and Studley Royal estate from North Yorkshire County Council in 1983. In 1986 the parkland in where the abbey stands was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. \nIt was recognised for fulfilling the criteria of \"\"being a masterpiece of human creative genius\".\" It was described \"\"as an outstanding example of a type of building or architectural or technological ensemble or landscape which illustrates significant stages in human history\".\" \nFountains Abbey is owned by the National Trust and maintained by English Heritage. The trust owns Studley Royal Park, Fountains Hall, St Mary's Church, which was designed by William Burges and built around 1873. All of them are significant features of the World Heritage Site.\nIn January 2010, Fountains Abbey and Studley Royal became two of the first National Trust properties to be included in Google Street View, using the Google Trike.\nFilm location.\nFountains Abbey was used as a film location by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark for their single \"Maid of Orleans (The Waltz Joan of Arc)\" during the cold winter of December 1981. In 1980, Hollywood filmed its final scenes to the film \"\". Other productions set on location of the abbey include: \"Life at the Top\", \"The Secret Garden\", \"The History Boys.\" Television series such as \"Flambards\", \"A History of Britain\", \"Terry Jones' Medieval Lives\", \"Cathedral\", \"Antiques Roadshow.\" Several game shows such as \"Treasure Hunt\" The BBC Television series \"Gunpowder\" (2017) also used Fountains Abbey as a location.\nLiterature.\nFountains Abbey was featured twice in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Books. It includes poetical illustrations by Letitia Elizabeth Landon. "}

It took 10 years to design and build. It was completed in 1805. It is the longest aqueduct in Great Britain, and is the highest canal aqueduct in the world. The 18-arched stone and cast iron structure is designed for narrowboats.\nThe aqueduct was part of a grand plan which was never completed. It was part of the proposed Ellesmere Canal. It would have been an industrial waterway which made a link between the River Severn at Shrewsbury and the port of Liverpool on the River Mersey. \nThe westerly high-ground route across the Vale of Llangollen was chosen. A less expensive route was surveyed to the east, but the route chosen would have taken the canal through a mineral-rich area. It would have taken the canal through the coalfields of North-East Wales. However, only parts of the canal route were completed. The plan fell through because the money ran out. The capitalist system at the time was primitive and unreliable. Most major work on the canal stopped after the completion of the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct in 1805.\nThe structure is a Grade I listed building. It is recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nName.\nThe name \"Pontcysyllte\" is Welsh for \"Cysyllte Bridge\", or \"Bridge of Cysyllte\". Cysyllte is the township of the old parish of Llangollen, where the southern end of the bridge lies. \nWorld Heritage Site.\nIn 1999, the aqueduct and its surrounding lands were submitted to the \"tentative list\" of properties being considered for UNESCO World Heritage Site status. The aqueduct was suggested as a contender in 2005, its 200th anniversary year. It was finally announced in 2006 that a larger proposal, which covers a section of the canal from the aqueduct to Horseshoe Falls would be the United Kingdom's 2008 nomination.\nParts of the site including the length of canal from Rhoswiel, Shropshire, to the Horseshoe Falls, Pontcysyllte Aqueduct, and Chirk Aqueduct were visited by inspectors from UNESCO in October 2008. It was carried out to analyse and confirm the site management and authenticity. The aqueduct was named by UNESCO on the World Heritage List on 27 June 2009."}

Among the issues include the fall in state's income as this forced the president to order that the salaries of public servants be reduced. Many reforms were made to the finance laws which caused the the property tax to increase in cities throughout the State. At the same time, taxes on salaries were created. Despite the economic difficulties, the industrial sector's growth did not slow down its growth.

It is part of molecular biology. Scientists use DNA barcoding to tell different species apart from each other. Scientists use DNA barcoding to tell which species are related to each other or evolved from the same older species.\nHow it works.\nThe first types of DNA sequencing started in the 1980s.\nIn DNA barcoding, the technician sequences part of a gene and compares it to that same gene in other species. Sometimes scientists use the short fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene as a DNA barcode gene. The fragment is usually 400 to 800 base pairs long.\nGroups of scientists choose different genes to barcode depending on their project. A good barcode gene has to be short in length and have the exact same sequence at its beginning and end, but its middle has to be different enough in different species.\nSome scientists say DNA barcoding is the opposite of genomics. DNA barcoding uses a few specific parts of the genome, and genomics is about looking at the entire genome.\nAdvantages.\nDNA barcoding costs less money than other kinds of DNA sequencing. This means that smaller laboratories can afford to use it, and all laboratories can do more of it. It is also much easier to learn how to do than other forms of taxonomy. That means more people can learn to use it.\nOne good thing about DNA barcoding is that it helps human beings get around ideas that seem right but are really wrong. For example, some animals look similar even though they are not closely related. Some animals look different even though they are closely related. It is easy for a scientist to think two species are related because they look or act alike. For example, cows are more closely related to whales and orcas than they are to horses, even though cows walk on hooves, live on land, and eat grass like horses do. Looking at DNA barcoding makes it easier to see what really happened in evolution.\nAnother good thing about DNA barcoding is that scientists do not need to get close to the animal or plant they want to study. This is good for studying animals that are easily damaged, very shy, or dangerous to humans. The scientists do not even need to see the organism to use DNA barcoding. In one study, scientists collected feces (poop) from an African savanna. They used DNA barcoding to tell which species of animal had left it there and which plants it had eaten, all from the undigested DNA.\nDNA barcoding makes it much much faster and easier to tell what a species eats. Before DNA barcoding, scientists had to follow an insect or other animal around and watch it eat. This could take many years. With DNA barcoding, scientists can look at what is in the animal's digestive system. This is fast enough that scientists can watch animals' eating habits change with climate change.\nWith DNA sequencing and DNA barcoding, scientists went into museums to look at specimens, or preserved example animals, that had been collected many years before. Using DNA sequencing, the scientists were able to tell that one butterfly collected in the 1700s was really ten different species of butterfly and not just one. Scientists made many discoveries of this kind in old museum collections.\nUses.\nHerpetologists (amphibian scientists) used DNA barcoding to analyze the parachuting frog in 2019. They found it by climbing mountains in Papua New Guinea."}

Although there were already Roman and Celtic churches had existed for centuries. Together with the Canterbury Cathedral and St Augustine's Abbey, they are part of a World Heritage Site.\nSince 1668 the church has been part of the benefice of St Martin and St Paul Canterbury. Both St Martin's and nearby St Paul's churches are used for weekly services. The current rector of the parish is the Reverend Mark Richard Griffin.\nEarly history.\nSt Martin's was the private chapel of Queen Bertha of Kent (died in or after 601). Queen Bertha was a Christian Frankish princess who arrived in England with her chaplain, Bishop Liudhard. Her pagan husband, King \u00c6thelberht of Kent, let her to continue to practise her religion by renovating (ca. AD 580) an existing church. As Bede named it, this church was dedicated to Saint Martin of Tours. It is the city located near where Bertha grew up.\nUpon Augustine's arrival, he used St Martin's as his mission headquarters. King \u00c6thelberht was baptised here. When Canterbury Cathedral and St Augustine's Abbey were established, St Martin's lost its initial prestige. However, it still remains of historical importance.\nArchitecture.\nLocal finds prove that Christianity did exist in this area of the city at the time. The church contains many reused Roman bricks or spolia. It also has complete sections of walls of Roman tiles. At the core of the church the brick remains of a Roman tomb were integrated into the structure. Several sections of walls are clearly very early. It is possible that a blocked square-headed doorway in the chancel was the entrance to Bertha's church. Meanwhile, other sections of wall come from the period after the Gregorian mission in the 7th or 8th centuries. The apse that was originally at the east end has been removed. The tower came much later, in Perpendicular style. The church is a Grade I listed building.\nGraves.\nMany notable local families and well-known graves were buried in its churchyard. These people include: \nMusic.\nThe church has a continuing musical tradition from the monks of St Augustine to the present day. The choral director for the parish is Dom del Nevo.\nThe tower has three bells set for swing-chiming using levers. "}

The European Broadcasting Union answered this with the creation of their own news channel. Euronews started broadcasting on 1 January 1993, from Lyon, in five languages (English, French, German, Spanish and Italian). The channel was special in the news market because it had no presenters or studios, just videos showing the news. The channel's most important segment is \"No Comment\", which shows videos with no voiceover.\nLater, the channel started broadcasting in Portuguese in 1999, in Russian in 2001, in Arabic in 2008, in Turkish and in Persian in 2010, in Ukrainian in 2011, in Greek in 2012, and in Hungarian in 2013.\nThe channel is controlled by a company called Euronews SA.

This was meant to market itself as \"pure news\" distancing from other competing channels (BBC, CNN, etc.) in the 24-hour news market.\nIn February 2015, Media Globe Networks got a 53% share of Euronews SA in a deal with the company. In January 2016, the channel started a sister network called Africanews, which is aimed at an African news market, with a pan-African view. Euronews got a new logo on 17 May 2016.\nNBC steps in.\nIn November 2016, NBCUniversal said they wanted to buy a share in the Euronews network. They also said they would share news reports with the channel. The deal was agreed upon in February 2017, and NBC bought a 25% share.\nIn May 2017, Euronews went from having one TV channel with 13 audio tracks, to 10 separate TV channels and 12 websites. This is part of a \u2019\"glocal\"\u2019 idea. Now, certain language editions can offer their own selections of local and global news. By doing this, the Arabic and Persian services stopped TV broadcasting, and they are now only on social media and the Euronews website. The Ukrainian service was closed because the Ukrainian government was not giving it money.\nIn 2018, the English Euronews channel started its first news shows with live presenters. Then, other Euronews language editions did the same and started their own presented evening news shows too.\nIn April 2020, NBC left the channel and sold its share to Media Globe Networks.

It includes select mining landscapes in Cornwall and West Devon. The site was added to the on July 2006. Plans to restart mining at South Crofty, and to build a supermarket at Hayle Harbour, caused its status to be questioned.\nThe World Heritage Committee considered placing the site on the List of World Heritage in Danger in 2014. This proposal was rejected. Instead, they agreed on a follow-up \"Reactive Monitoring Mission\".\nHistory.\nDevon made around 25-40% of the amount of tin that Cornwall did up to the mid-16th century. However, the total amount of tin made in both Cornwall and Devon at this time was relatively small. After the 1540s, Cornwall's production took off while Devon's production was only about between a ninth to a tenth of that of Cornwall.\nFrom the mid-16th century onwards, the Devon Stannaries were giving very little in income to the King. They were sidelined after the Supremacy of Parliament Act 1512.\nThe landscapes of Cornwall and West Devon were reshaped during the 18th and 19th centuries by the mining of copper and tin. The underground mines, engine houses, foundries, new towns, smallholdings, ports, harbours, and other supporting industries together meant the region produced \"two-thirds of the world's supply of copper\". \nDuring the late 19th century, arsenic production came to the east of Cornwall and West Devon. As a result, the region supplied half the world\u2019s demand. \nAreas.\nThe World Heritage site consists of individual but topical linked areas around Cornwall and West Devon. The areas (with the area codes from the site nomination) are:\nAncient rocks, rare heavy elements.\nDevon and Cornwall rocks were once in the core of huge volcanic mountains. Those rocks usually contain more heavy metallic elements than usually found on the Earth's surface. A recent news item says a new mineral was found in Cornwall called Kernowite.\nRocks from ocean floor mid-ocean ridges (oceanic lithosphere) may come to the surface under orogeny as ophiolites. Wherever there is a large ground-down mountain chain there may be a source of heavy metals."}

In these cases, it is even common to use only the second surname, as in \"Lorca\", \"Picasso\" or \"Zapatero\".

It has buildings and other things that were built in the Joseon Dynasty or that have been rebuilt in the same style. Hahoe Village hosts cultural events, including traditional mask dances. It is in the city of Andong, in North Gyeongsang Province. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nThe people who built the town used Confucian philosophy and the clan system to decide where to put each building and road. The clan system was very important in Korea during the Joseon Dynasty. Some of the houses are made of wood and some are made of mud. Some of the houses have tile roofs and some have thatched roofs. Some of the buildings are made of traditional materials and some have been rebuilt with modern materials. There is a 600 year old zelkova tree in the village. People have named the tree \"Samsindang,\" and there is a shrine next to it. Unlike many homes in South Korea, which face south, the houses in Hahoe Village face the tree. The Byeongsanseowon Confucian Academy is 4 km east of the village.\nPeople still live in Hahoe Folk Village. Many of them are members of the Ryu clan who have lived there since the 1400s. There are about 127 households in Hahoe Folk Village. Some of them still have a \"jongga\" or head of the family and practice ancestor worship in the Confucian way.\nHahoe Folk Village is known for its traditional outdoor mask performances. Most traditional masks in Korea are made out of calabash and are used only once. Masks in Hahoe are made from wood, usually alder wood, and are reused many times.\nHahoe Folk Village also hosts Seonyu Julbul Nori. On the birthday of the spiritual leader Buddha, people ride down the Nakdong River in boats. People read poetry. There is also a display called line fire. This is a special way of lighting fireworks. Mulberry tree charcoal is put in long pouches that are tied every few centimeters on their length. The pouches are attached to a rope made of straw, one pouch every five meters. The rope is long enough to go between two trees. One end of one charcoal pouch is lit, and it takes a long time for all the charcoal to burn down the whole length of the rope.\nThe name \"Hahoe\" comes from \"ha\" for \"river\" and \"hoe\" for \"turn around\" in Korean. The village is built right where the Nakdong River turns around. \nIn 2020, the village added a traditional brushwood bridge near Hahoe Folk Village.\nQueen Elizabeth II visited Hahoe Folk village in 2019."}

It is a dependency of Tristan da Cunha. It is part of the British overseas territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha. It is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Gough and Inaccessible Islands. \nIt is about south-east of the Tristan da Cunha archipelago (which includes Nightingale Island and Inaccessible Island), , north-east from South Georgia Island, west from Cape Town. It is over from the nearest point of South America.\nNobody lives on Gough Island except for the workers of a weather station, which is usually six people. The South African National Antarctic Programme has maintained the island with British permission since 1956. It is one of the most remote places with a people always being there. \nName.\nThe island was first named \"Ilha de Gon\u00e7alo \u00c1lvares\" on Portuguese maps. It was named Gough Island after the British mariner Captain Charles Gough of the \"Richmond\", who first saw the island in 1732. Confusion of the unusual Portuguese saint name Gon\u00e7alo with Spanish Diego led to the wrong name Diego Alvarez Island in English-language sources from the 1800s to 1930s. \nHowever, the most likely explanation is that it was simply a misreading of 'Is de Go Alvarez', the name by which the island is represented on some of the early charts, the 'de Go' mutating into 'Diego'.\nHistory.\nThe details of the discovery of Gough Island are unclear, but the most likely occasion is July 1505 by the Portuguese explorer Gon\u00e7alo \u00c1lvares. Maps during the next three centuries named the island after him. On some later maps, this was erroneously given as Diego Alvarez.\nAccording to some historians, the British merchant Anthony de la Roch\u00e9 was the first to land on the island in the austral autumn of 1675.\nCharles Gough rediscovered the island on 3 March 1732. He thought it was a new find. It had been named Gon\u00e7alo \u00c1lvares since 1505 after the captain of Vasco da Gama's flagship on his epic voyage to the east. It was under this name that it was marked with reasonable accuracy on the charts of the South Atlantic during the following 230 or so years. \nThen, in 1732, Captain Gough of the British ship \"Richmond\" reported the discovery of a new island. He placed it 400 miles to the east of Gon\u00e7alo \u00c1lvares. Fifty years later, cartographers realised that the two islands were the same. Despite the priority of the Portuguese discovery, and the greater accuracy of the position given by them, \"Gough's Island\" was the name adopted.\nIn the early 19th century, sealers briefly inhabited the island. The earliest known example is a sealing gang from the U.S. ship \"Rambler\" (Captain Joseph Bowditch) which remained on the island in the 1804\u20131805 season. The sealing era lasted from 1804 to 1910 during which 34 sealing vessels are known to have visited the island, one of which was lost offshore.\nThe Scottish National Antarctic Expedition on the \"Scotia\" made the first visit to the island by a scientific party on 21 April 1904, when William Speirs Bruce and others collected specimens. The Shackleton\u2013Rowett Expedition also stopped at the island in 1922.\nGough Island was formally claimed in 1938 for Britain, during a visit by HMS \"Milford\" of the Royal Navy. In 1995, the island was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In 2004, the site was extended to include Inaccessible Island and renamed Gough and Inaccessible Islands.\nGough Island is the only place outside South America from which the solar eclipse of September 12, 2034, will be visible; the centre of the path of totality crosses over the island.\nGeography and geology.\nGough Island is roughly rectangular with a length of and a width of . It has an area of and rises to heights of over above sea level. Topographic features include the highest peak, Edinburgh Peak, Hags Tooth, Mount Rowett, Sea Elephant Bay, Quest Bay, and Hawkins Bay.\nIt includes small satellite islands and rocks such as Southwest Island, Saddle Island (South), Tristiana Rock, Isolda Rock (West), Round Island, Cone Island, Lot's Wife, Church Rock (North), Penguin Island (Northeast), and The Admirals (East).\nClimate.\nAccording to the K\u00f6ppen system, Gough Island features an oceanic climate (\"Cfb\"). Gough Island's temperatures are between and during the day year-round, due to its isolated position far out in the Atlantic Ocean. The Atlantic is much cooler in the southern hemisphere than the northern, but frosts are still very rare. As a result, summers are not very hot. It features a similar climate to the Fiordland area of New Zealand, the west coast of Scotland, or the Alaskan Panhandle. Precipitation is high during the entire year, and sunshine hours are few. Snow falls in the interior, but is rare at sea level.\nWeather station.\nA weather station has been running on Gough Island since 1956. It is operated as part of the network of the South African Weather Service. Because cold fronts approach South Africa from the south-west, the Gough station is particularly important in forecasting winter weather. Initially it was housed in the station at The Glen, but moved in 1963 to the South lowlands of the island, more precisely . The new location improved the validity and reliability of the data acquired for use in modeling.\nHuman presence.\nEach year a new overwintering team arrives by ship from Cape Town (beginning in 2012, the \"S. A. Agulhas II\") to staff the weather station and perform scientific research. The team for a particular year may be termed as \"Gough\" and an expedition number: for example, the 1956 team were \"Gough 01\", and the team for 2013 were \"Gough 58\". Each new team directly replaces the departing one, thereby maintaining a continual human presence on the island.\nA team normally consists of:\nThe team is supplied with enough food to last the whole year. People and cargo are landed either by helicopter, from a helideck-equipped supply ship, or by a fixed crane atop a cliff near the station (a place aptly called \"Crane Point\").\nIn 2014 a member of the research team choked to death on the island and his body was taken back to South Africa."}

First settlers were there since 1612. It is the first permanent English settlement on the islands of Bermuda. It is usually described as the third successful British settlement in the Americas. It is the oldest British town in the New World where people continue to live up to this day. \nName.\nIn the Bermudian convention where the name of the place has the name of a person, it sets the person's name in the possessive form. The place is rarely treated as equivalent to the person. \nOther examples include most of the parishes (which \u2013 other than St. George's Parish \u2013 all commemorate historical people). It includes churches such as Hamilton Parish (named for James Hamilton, 2nd Marquess of Hamilton), Devonshire Parish (named for William Cavendish, 1st Earl of Devonshire), and Paget Parish. While the city of Hamilton is commonly referred to as \"Hamilton\", The Town of St. George, St. George's Parish, St. George's Island, and St. George's Harbour (and any other names of the place usually containing a person's name in the possessive form). It always remains possessive when shortened, such as in the \"St. George's Foundation\".\nFor example, Bermudians will always say \"St. George's and St. David's are the largest islands in St. George's Parish.\" It is never \"St. George and St. David are the largest islands in St. George Parish\". As many maps and other printed materials featuring Bermuda are produced abroad, it is extremely common to find maps, books and other material using the non-possessive forms. However, visitors to Bermuda should be aware that using the non-possessive forms when speaking to Bermudians is likely to cause as much offence as saying \"Bermudan\". \nHistory.\nOriginally called \"New London\", St. George's was first settled in 1612. This was three years after the first English settlers landed on St. George's Island on their way to Virginia. Led by Admiral Sir George Somers and Lieutenant-General Sir Thomas Gates, they had deliberately steered their ship, \"Sea Venture,\" to a reef to escape a storm. The survivors built two new ships, the \"Deliverance\" and \"Patience\", and most continued their voyage to Jamestown, but the Virginia Company laid claim to the island.\nBy the Virginia Company's Third Charter in 1612, the boundaries of the new colony were extended to include Bermuda. The company sent a party of 60 new settlers to Bermuda to join the three men left behind by the \"Sea Venture.\" After a brief period in nearby St. David's, the settlers started building at St. George's. By 1615, the shareholders of the Virginia Company created a second company, the Somers Isles Company. It managed Bermuda separately until the company was dissolved in 1686. The Virginia Company was later dissolved in 1624. \nThis small town was the capital of Bermuda until 1815. It was linked to the history of colonial America. Ten thousand Bermudians moved to Virginia and the American Southeast. This was before United States independence made them citizens of separate nations. Branches of wealthy Bermudian merchant families ruled the trade in the area's ports. \nAs Bermuda's population centre, St. George's was connected to the development in the North American colonies. During the American War of Independence, and as requested by George Washington, Bermudians assisted the American rebels in stealing much-needed gunpowder from a St. George's magazine. It supplied the forts protecting that were protecting the port. \nTwin cities.\nIn 1996, the town was twinned with Lyme Regis, Dorset, England. It was the birthplace of Admiral Sir George Somers. In 2000, the town, together with numerous surrounding fortifications, including the Castle Islands Fortifications, they were added to the UNESCO World Heritage Site. Together, they are formally known as the \"Historic Town of St George and Related Fortifications\".\nSports.\nSt. George's Colts and Hamilton Parish football clubs play their games at the Wellington Oval, which also serves as a cricket ground.\nEducation.\nSt. George's Preschool serves the area. St. George's Primary School is in the community."}

The three other caves are Vanguard Cave, Hyaena Cave, and Bennett's Cave.\nIt is located at Governor's Beach on the southeastern face of the Rock of Gibraltar. People lived there about 55,000 years ago. It was approximately 5 kilometres from the shore, but, due to changes in sea level, it is now only a few metres from the Mediterranean Sea.\nDiscovery.\nThe cave is named after Captain A. Gorham. He discovered it in 1907 while opening a fissure at the rear of a sea cavern. Gorham wrote his name and the date of his discovery in lamp-black on the wall of the cave. It has his name ever since. After this initial discovery, it seems the cave was forgotten, at least at an official level. Gibraltarian historian and potholer George Palao recalls an inscription on the cave wall that read \"J. J. Davies 1943\".\nDescription.\nGorham's Cave is a sea cave which has formed in Jurassic limestone. Total length of this cave is approximately 100 m and at the entrance it is approximately 35 m high. Further inside the cave, it becomes narrower, and turns per approximately 90 degrees. From the entrance of cave opens a view on the Alboran Sea. It is possible that during further research the cave will become longer.\nUNESCO World Heritage site.\nGorham's Cave got its name Gorham's Cave complex.

The three other caves are the nearby Vanguard Cave, the Hyaena Cave, and Bennett's Cave.\nIn November 2010, the Gorham's Cave complex was put forward to compete for a nomination as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Professor Clive Finlayson, director of the Gibraltar Museum, was responsible for coordinating the efforts to obtain this nomination. The first step was a proposal to the United Kingdom cultural authorities to get Gorham's Cave complex added to the UK's World Heritage tentative list. The list is changed every ten years. The process for a new list was ongoing at the date of the submission.\nThe ownership of land associated with Gorham's Cave was passed from the UK Ministry of Defence to the government of Gibraltar in 2011. The agreement swapped this MOD land and more than 300 MOD houses with the government of Gibraltar, who in exchange agreed to build 90 new houses on remaining MOD land.\nIn May 2012 Gorham's Cave complex was on the short list of two sites, along with the Forth Rail Bridge, that was forwarded for submission to UNESCO. The site was inscribed by UNESCO as a World Heritage site on 15 July 2016, and is Gibraltar's only World Heritage site."}

It was built early in the 1st century AD. The municipality of Orange owns the structure. The theatre is the home of the summer opera festival called the Chor\u00e9gies d'Orange.\nIt is a very well preserved Roman theatres. It served the Roman colony of \"Arausio\" (more specifically, \"Colonia Julia Firma Secundanorum Arausio\": \"the Julian colony of Arausio started by the soldiers of the second legion\"). This colony was founded in 40 BC. The theatre played an important role in the life of the citizens. They spent a large part of their free time there.The Roman authorities saw it as a way to spread spreading Roman culture to the colonies. They also saw it as a way to make them forget about political activities.\nMime, pantomime, poetry readings and the \"attelana\" (a kind of farce, similar to the commedia dell'arte) were the most important forms of entertainment. It often lasted all day. The common people liked spectacular effects and beautiful stage sets became very important. The use of stage machinery also became important. The entertainment was open to everyone. It was free of charge.\nThe Western Roman Empire declined during the 4th century. Christianity had become the official religion. An official edict closed the theatre in AD 391. This is because at that time the Church was against what it saw as uncivilised performances. The Visigoths probably pillaged it in 412. Like most Roman buildings, a lot of its better stone was used again for other buildings. It was used as a defensive post in the early Middle Ages. By the 12th century, the Church started to use it for religious plays. During the 16th-century there were religious wars. The theatre became a place to hide for the townspeople. In 1981 UNESCO declared the theatre as a World Heritage Site. In modern days, it is used mostly for opera. It is also a tourist attraction.\nConstruction and structure of the theatre.\nThe Romans made early Roman theatres mostly with wood. They were meant to be temporary structures. In 55 BC Pompey asked for a stone theatre in his home city of Rome. After this, important (and permanent) Roman theatres became more popular in the Empire. The Orange theatre was built under the rule of Augustus. It was one of the first of its kind in this area of France. The grand exterior (outside) facade is one of the most famous parts of the structure. It is 103 meters long and 37 meters high. At the beginning, there was a wooden roof across the theatre. This protected the people watching from bad weather. There is evidence on the walls that shows that, at some point, the roof burnt in a fire. There is not very much decoration on the theatre. However, the tall wall gives an imposing look to the whole building. The three main doors on the first level of the facade open directly onto the stage inside the theatre. The theatre can seat between 5,800 up to 7,300. Today, much of the seating is new. This is to make sure that tourists and people watching plays are safe. \nThe stage is 61 meters long. It is about one meter above the ground. To the back is the wall. Its height is the same as in Roman times. This wall is very important to the theatre. This is because it helps to make the sound louder for the large audience. The wall is also known as the scaenae frons. It is the only place with decoration in the entire theatre. It used to have marble mosaics of many different colours. It also had many columns, friezes and statues placed in niches. The central niche contains a statue of the emperor Augustus. This was likely a restoration of an original statue of Apollo, the god of music and the arts. The central door, below the central niche, is called the Royal Door, or \"valva regia.\" Only by the most important actors used this door to enter and exit the stage. Above the door there was a frieze decorated with centaurs. It is not there anymore. It is now on display across the street in the Orange Museum. Only some parts of it are left. The stage now has a modern platform. This is to stop damage when actors use it for operas and other performances.\nReconstruction.\nThe reconstruction (building again) of the theatre started in 1825. People wanted to bring back the theatre to its original use: to host large, exciting performances. In 1869, the theatre was still being restored. It hosted \u201cThe Roman Festivals,\u201d which brought over 10,000 guests. A very important part of the restoration was excavating the area around the theatre. This happened in the 1930s. This excavation and levelling of buildings around the theatre helped find many historical objects and artifacts. These helped make knowledge better about the history and uses of the structure. Today, all three levels of seating have been completely restored. This is the same for many staircases, large parts of the pavement, the stage, the orchestra, and parts of walls.\nCurrent uses of the theatre.\nDuring the Middle Ages, around the 12th century, the Church used the theatre to host plays. Theatre companies also hosted plays. In the 16th century this tradition stopped once again when the town was sacked during The French Wars of Religion. Much of the population left.In the 19th century, the theatre went back to its original use. Today, the Orange theatre is considered the best preserved (kept) Roman theatre in all of Europe. Culturespaces manages it. This is an organisation that also manages other related cultural sites in the area, for example the Orange Museum and the Triumphal Arch. It also manages other sites in the South of France. \nThe theatre is a historical site, but also a venue for concerts and theatrical performances. The first major festival held in the theatre in 1869 after the restoration started was called \u201cThe Roman Festival\u201d. This festival became a yearly festival called the Chor\u00e9gies (see below). These decadent events brought in thousands of visitors from around the world. During the rest of the year, the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre d'Orange is a major tourist attraction. Tourists can walk through the main theatre and rooms around it. They can also walk through the corridors.\nThe \"Roman Festival\" and the Chor\u00e9gies.\nDuring the 19th century, the theatre slowly started to look better again. Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e helped with this. At the time, he was the director of \"\"Monuments Historiques\".\" He led the restoration. The work began in 1825 and in 1869 the theatre became the home of a \"Roman Festival\" which celebrated the glory of Rome. It included a performance of M\u00e9hul's opera, \"Joseph\". In the second half of the 19th century, and early 20th century, all the major players of the French classical stage appeared in the Orange festivals. For example, Sarah Bernhardt played \"Ph\u00e8dre\" there in 1903.\nBy the end of the century, the tiered seats were restored. In 1902 the festival had a new name, the \"Chor\u00e9gies\". It was planned as a yearly summer festival. The name comes from the tax that wealthy Romans had to pay for theatre productions. Until 1969 the Chor\u00e9gies consisted of plays and musical works, for example opera and symphonies. However, after that date, it became just an opera festival. Plays were done at Avignon.\nIn 1981 UNESCO made the theatre a World Heritage Site."}

It is inside the city of Gyeongju, which used to be the capital of Korea. It has buildings and other things that were built in the Joseon Dynasty or that have been rebuilt in the same style. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nYangdong was built in the 1400s by two important clans, Yeogang Lee and Wolseong Son. Many of the people who live in Yangdong now are from these families. Many members of these families who do not live in Yangdong come back a few times a year for special occasions.\nYangdong Folk Village is a World Heritage Site as part of a pair with Hahoe Folk Village. Both places were built during the Joseon Dynasty and many of the buildings are still intact. Some of the buildings have been rebuilt with modern materials, though. Like Hahoe, Yangdong's layout shows influences from the Confucian way of thinking and the importance of the clan system in Korea at the time. There are timber houses with tiled roofs for high-ranking people and mud houses with thatched roofs that were originally for low-ranking people. The village is on the sides of hills. The buildings were built in specific places so their rooftops would match and complement the hillsides around them. The buildings belonging to nobler or richer people are higher up on the hills. One home once had 99 rooms.\nThere are two Confucian schools, Oksanseowon and Donggangseowon, near Yangdong Folk Village.\nThere are about 149 houses in Yangdong Folk Village and people still live in them. Yangdong Folk Village has modern, paved roads, some modern bridges, and a railway.\nBefore it was declared a World Heritage Site around 2010, few people visited Yangdong. After it was declared a World Heritage Site, many more came. People worried about whether the extra visitors would damage the site. Tourists, including schoolchildren on field trips, often visit Yangdong.\nFamous people from Yangdong include the Joseon era philosopher Lee Eon-jeok (1491-1553), nicknamed \"Hoejae.\" Hojae is called one of the \"Five Great Sages of the East.\""}

They were chosen because their paintings are so detailed and show daily life, because the way they were built shows good engineering, because modern people can use the tombs to tell what the people of the Kingdom of Koguryo thought about burying people, and because the burials in the Kingdom of Koguryo affected many later countries, including the modern Koreas and Japan.\nThe 63 tombs of the World Heritage Site are not all in the same place. They are spread out across the city of Pyongyang and nearby provinces. Historians think these tombs were made for kings and other royals and nobles.\nSometimes experts from North Korea and South Korea work together on the Koguryo tombs, but this depends on how well the two countries are getting along.\nThieves and other looters broke into some of the tombs, and only a few were completely untouched when scientists first saw them.\nIn 2018, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea began to allow more visitors from outside the country to see the tombs.

It is sometimes described as a serpentine wall or a wavy wall. It is found most often in England, though the idea has been used elsewhere. The walls do look elegant, but the main object is practical. The format resists the usual pushes from the surrounding earth, and so needs fewer repairs than straight walls do.\nThomas Jefferson (1743\u20131826) incorporated serpentine walls into the architecture of the University of Virginia, which he founded. On both sides of its rotunda and down the length of the lawn are ten pavilions. Each has its own walled garden separated by crinkle crankle walls.\nMany crinkle crankle walls are found in East Anglia, England. There the marshes of The Fens were drained by Dutch engineers, starting in the mid-1600s. They apparently introduced the idea.\u00a0 The county of Suffolk has at least 50 examples, twice as many as in the rest of the country. The term \"crinkle crankle\" is said to derive from a Suffolk dialect. The crinkle crankle wall running from the former manor house to All Saints' Church in the estate village of Easton is believed to be the longest existing example.\nThe idea, which is never seen in cities, is not that uncommon in south-eastern England. The ancient village of Wheathampstead in Hertfordshire has a crinckle-crankle wall near its church. It has needed far less maintenance than the straight walls in the vicinity.\nIn Lymington, Hampshire, there are at least two examples of crinkle crankle walls. The older of the two is thought to have been constructed at the time of the Napoleonic Wars (1803\u20131815) by exiled Hanoverian soldiers living in a nearby house."}

In 2014-15 there were 19,422 crofts, with 15,388 crofters. S\nRequirements.\nTenants and owner-occupier crofters are required to comply with a range of duties specified in sections 5AA to 5C and 19C of the Crofters (Scotland) Act 1993. There is a requirement to be ordinarily resident within 32km of the croft. If the croft is the sole dwelling and the crofter's family are resident while the croft is away this would probably be accepted as ordinarily resident. Other situations involving other places of residence would need to be assessed individually. In addition to the duty of residence tenants and owner occupier crofters are required to ensure the croft is cultivated, maintained and not neglected or misused.\nOther websites.\nNotes"}

It is also known as the Pont d'Avignon ().\nA wooden bridge was built between 1177 and 1185. It went across the Rh\u00f4ne river between Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon and Avignon. This early bridge was destroyed forty years later in 1226. This was during the Albigensian Crusade when Louis VIII of France attacked Avignon. In 1234 building started again for a new bridge with 22 stone arches. The stone bridge was about long and only wide. This width included the parapets at the sides. The bridge was abandoned in the mid-17th century. The arches collapsed (broke and fell into the water) each time the Rh\u00f4ne flooded. This made it very expensive to maintain (fix) the bridge. \nFour arches and the gatehouse at the Avignon end of the bridge still exist. The Chapel of Saint Nicholas sits on the second pier of the bridge. It was built in the second half of 12th century. It has changed a lot since then. The western terminus, the Tour Philippe-le-Bel also still exists.\nThe bridge was the inspiration for the French song \"Sur le pont d'Avignon.\" The bridge is an important landmark in the city. In 1995, the arches of the bridge, together with the Palais des Papes and Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame des Doms were classified as a World Heritage Site.\nHistory.\nThe bridge went across the Rh\u00f4ne between Avignon and Villeneuve-l\u00e8s-Avignon. The first bridge was built between 1177 and 1185. It was destroyed during the siege of Avignon by Louis VIII of France in 1226. They started rebuilding the bridge again by 1234. Many historians think that the first bridge was made of wood or maybe a wooden structure supported on stone piers. When the bridge was built a second time, it was all made of stone. The stone bridge had 22 arches and 21 piers. Its length was . It did not run directly between the two gatehouses. It had a curved path. This was probably because of the position of the islands on the river at the time. Over the centuries the Rh\u00f4ne has moved across its floodplain. The position of the islands in the 13th century is not well documented. A 17th-century map shows that the southern end of the \u00cele de la Barthelasse was upstream of the bridge. The bridge crossed small islands that were upstream of the \u00cele de Piot. The space between the piers was between . The bridge was only in width with the parapets at the sides. The arches sometimes broke when the river flooded. They were sometimes replaced with temporary wooden structures, and after they were rebuilt in stone.\nThe bridge fell into a bad state during the 17th century. By 1644 the bridge was missing four arches. A flood in 1669 broke even more of the structure. After this, the other arches have collapsed one after the other, or they have been demolished. As of 2020, only four of the arches are left. The only other visible part of the bridge is some masonry from pier\u00a011. This is attached to a private building on the \u00cele de la Barthelasse. Remains of other piers are buried under a thick layer of sediment on the island or at the bottom of the Rh\u00f4ne. Piers\u00a09 and 10 are both now on the \u00cele de la Barthelasse. They were confirmed by cores drilled at the positions historians thought. They found masonry from the piers at a depth of below ground level. Just below the masonry, at a depth of around there were wooden fragments (small pieces). These were made of silver fir (\"Abies alba\"). Carbon-14 dating of this material gave dates of 1238\u20131301\u00a0AD for pier\u00a09 and 1213\u20131280\u00a0AD for pier\u00a010 (the range is for 2\u03c3).\nThe arches are segmental rather than the semi-circular shape usually used in Roman bridges. Of the 4 arches that still exist, the largest span is . This is between the third and fourth piers. The piers have cutwaters. These are pointed both upstream and downstream. These mean there is less scour around the piers. This is one of the main problems for the stability of stone bridges. The piers were built with holes in the stone. This was to help lessen pressure from the flow of water when the river was in flood.\nAfter the collapse of the Saint-B\u00e9n\u00e9zet bridge, people crossed the Rh\u00f4ne at Avignon by ferry. This happened until the beginning of the 19th century. Between 1806 and 1818 a wooden bridge was built across the river. The new bridge was a few hundred metres south of the old bridge at the . A suspension bridge replaced the section across the Avignon branch of the Rh\u00f4ne in 1843. This was demolished in 1960 with the opening of the Edouard Daladier bridge. The section of the wooden bridge across the Villeneuve branch of the Rh\u00f4ne was not replaced until 1909. The replacement stone bridge, the Nouveau Pont, was damaged by bombing in 1944. It was repaired after the war but was replaced by the Pont du Royaume in 1972.\nSaint B\u00e9n\u00e9zet legend.\nSaint B\u00e9n\u00e9zet inspired the building of the bridge. He was a shepherd boy from the hamlet of Villard in the Ard\u00e8che. According to tradition, he heard the voice of Jesus Christ while he was looking after his sheep. Jesus asked him to build a bridge across the river. Although he was ridiculed at first, he \"proved\" his divine inspiration by miraculously lifting a very large block of stone. He won support for his project and formed a Bridge Brotherhood to help with building the bridge. After his death, he was interred on the bridge itself. This was in a small chapel standing on one of the bridge's surviving piers on the Avignon side.\nSaint Nicholas Chapel.\nThe Saint Nicholas Chapel sits on a platform on the upstream side of the second pier (between the second and third arches). The bridge chapel has been restored and built again a few times. It now has two floors. Each floor has a nave and an apse. The upper floor is at the same level as the platform of the bridge. It makes the width of the walkway smaller. In this place, the walkway is only . There is a set of steps to get to the lower floor from the bridge.\nThe outside of the chapel shows marks of the rebuilding work. For example, there are blocked windows on the south-eastern wall. The nave is covered with stone roof tiles. These tiles rest on a series of corbels. The polygonal apse has a flat roof. It sits above the cutwater of the pier.\nThe lower chapel's apse is decorated with five arches. It is from the second half of the 12th century. At a later date, maybe as early as the 13th century, there was a floor supported by a ribbed quadripartite vault inserted into the structure. The simple rectangular upper chapel was consecrated in 1411. A side door was created in the lower chapel. This is because the stonework of the raised bridge blocked the original entrance. In 1513 a pentagonal apse with gothic columns was added to the upper chapel.\nIn 1670, after the bridge was abandoned, the relics of Saint B\u00e9n\u00e9zet were transferred to the H\u00f4pital du Pont (also called the H\u00f4pital St B\u00e9n\u00e9zet). This is within the city walls next to the gatehouse.\nThe bridge was also the site of devotion by the Rh\u00f4ne boatmen. This is because their patron saint was Saint Nicholas. They initially worshipped in the Saint Nicholas Chapel on the bridge itself (where Saint B\u00e9n\u00e9zet's body was also interred). However, the bad condition of the bridge made it difficult to go there. In 1715 the confraternity of boatmen built a chapel on dry land on the Avignon side of the bridge. This was outside the ramparts next to the gatehouse. This chapel was destroyed by a major flood of the Rh\u00f4ne in 1856. A house for a caretaker was built on the ruins during the restoration work. This started around 1878. The residence was demolished after the restoration work on the bridge and gatehouse in the 1980s.\nGatehouses.\nThe bridge had great strategic importance. When it was built, it was the only fixed river crossing between Lyon and the Mediterranean Sea. It was also the only river crossing between the Comtat Venaissin (an enclave controlled by the Pope) and France controlled by the kings of France. As such, it was closely guarded on both sides of the river. The right bank was controlled by the French crown. The fortress of the Tour Philippe-le-Bel was close enough to see the bridge. This was built at the beginning of the 14th century. On the Avignon side, a large gatehouse was built in the 14th century. It was changed a lot in the 15th century. The walkway passed over the city wall and down a ramp (now destroyed). This led into the city.\nBetween 1265 and 1309 another stone bridge was built across the Rh\u00f4ne, . This was upstream from Avignon, at what is now Pont-Saint-Esprit. At the time, it was called Saint-Saturnin-du-Port. The Pont-Saint-Esprit bridge originally had 20 arches. It was long. Although it is now changed, the medieval bridge still exists as of 2020.\nThe Chapel of Saint Nicholas and the four remaining arches were listed as a \"Monument historique\" in 1840.\nRoman bridge hypothesis.\nThere has been a debate on whether there was a bridge before the Saint B\u00e9n\u00e9zet bridge was built in the 12th century. Henri Revoil first said there may have been an older bridge. He said this at the French Archaeological Conference held in Avignon in 1882. His main argument was that the stonework at the base of the four surviving piers became visible. At very low water, stone blocks were visible. They were larger than those above. They had features that looked foreign to the existing bridge. The style of the masonry indicated to Revoil that there had been an earlier bridge dating from either the late Roman or Carolingian periods. In 1892 Louis Rochetin published an article. It said that the stone blocks at the base of the first pier and those on either side of the second pier supporting the chapel were the remains of springers that would have supported earlier Roman arches.\nDenis-Marcel Mari\u00e9 self-published a book about the bridge in 1953. It looked at all the previous publications. In the last chapter it supported the hypothesis that there was an earlier bridge built by the Gallo-Romans around the end of the Roman occupation. He said that the bases of the piers that were still there belonged to this earlier bridge. He also said that the semi-circular arches used during the Roman period meant that the level of the roadway would have been higher than the top of the surviving chapel. Mari\u00e9 supposed that this early bridge had collapsed over the following seven centuries. He said that the 12th century B\u00e9n\u00e9zet bridge had a decking supported on wooden piles linking the ruined Roman piers. The piles were needed because the gaps between the Roman stone piers would have been too large to span with wooden beams without the support in between. The height of the B\u00e9n\u00e9zet bridge would have been at the level of the lower chapel.\nPerrot \"et al.\" published an article in 1971 about a Roman bridge too. The article talked about a survey in 1969 on the vestiges of the piers in the Villeneuve branch of the river the Compagnie Nationale du Rh\u00f4ne (CNR) destroyed them. The article also had long quotes from an unpublished report by Mr Mathian, an engineer working for the CNR. This was about a survey carried out in 1965 on the four intact piers on the Avignon side of the river. This survey found a layer of wood, at least 20\u00a0cm in thickness. This was under the foundations of each of the four intact piers. \nA sample of the wood was dated by the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS). They used the radiocarbon technique. It was from between 290 and 530\u00a0AD, corresponding to the end of the Roman Empire. In the survey of the ruined piers in the Villeneuve channel, a pier (listed as number 14) was found to contain wooden beams inside the masonry. A sample of this wood was radiodated to 890\u00a0AD. During the dredging of the Villeneuve channel the remains of three large wooden piles were recovered. Two of these were still covered with iron tips. \nThe archaeologist Dominique Carru, accepted the radiocarbon date for the sample of wood. However, he argued in 1999 that it is very unlikely that an earlier bridge existed. It is not mentioned in the surviving texts from the high medieval period . Also, a bridge would have led to the development of a town on the right bank of the Rh\u00f4ne opposite Avignon, similar to those at other locations in the Rh\u00f4ne valley, such as Trinquetaille opposite Arles and Saint-Romain-en-Gal near Vienne. There is no evidence for an important early settlement near the terminus of the bridge. The main east-west route in the Roman period passed through Tarascon-Beaucaire, to the south. It avoided the river at Avignon which was wide and variable in position.\nThe song \"Sur le Pont d'Avignon\".\nThe bridge has became famous with the song \"Sur le Pont d'Avignon\" (\"On the Bridge of Avignon\"). An earlier song with the same title was popular in the 16th and 17th centuries. Ottaviano Petrucci published the melody in his \"Harmonice Musices Odhecaton\" of 1503-4. The 16th-century composer Pierre Certon used the melody in a mass with the title: \"Sus le Pont d'Avignon\". The modern version of the song dates from the mid-19th century. Adolphe Adam included it in the op\u00e9ra comique \"Le Sourd ou l'Auberge pleine.\" This was first played in Paris in 1853. The opera was an adaptation of the 1790 comedy by Desforges."}

It is related to Korean.\nHistory.\nThe Jeju language comes from Middle Korean, which is also the ancestor of the Korean language.\nJeju became a separate language from (mainland) Korean due to its isolation as an island and because in 1629, Jejuans were banned from leaving Jeju, causing more disconnection.\nUsage.\nUNESCO lists Jeju as a \"critically endangered\" language, since most of its speakers are over the age of 70. Younger Jejuans speak Korean instead. As of 2010, the language is spoken by 5,000 - 10,000 people, which is less than 2% of Jeju Island's total population.\nDialect or language.\nMany linguists think Jeju is its own language, mostly because mainland Koreans cannot understand it. Others think Jeju is a dialect of Korean, although a very different one. The local government calls Jeju as a separate language, and the idea of it being a language is becoming more accepted in both Korean and foreign academia. UNESCO listed Jeju as one of the world's languages in 2011."}

All together, they were named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2013.\nKaesong was the capital city of the Kingdom of Koryo. The city's gates, palaces, tombs and monuments, walls, schools, tower for looking at the stars and other buildings all together make up the World Heritage Site because they show the philosophy, culture, politics and spiritual beliefs of the Koryo people. The city's layout shows a mixture of Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism. It especially shows the change from Buddhism to neo-Confucianism that happened during the Koryo Dynasty.\nWalls and gates.\nUNESCO says three different sections of wall and a few gates in Kaesong have enough historical value to be part of the site. The Palocham Wall was built in 896 c.e., just before the Koryo Dynasty. The Outer Wall was built in 1009-1029 and connected the city to the nearby Songak, Puhung, Tokam, Jine and Ryongsu Mountains. The wall was built to defend the city, but it also shows what people believed about the magic or spiritual power of mountains. The Inner Wall was built in 1391-3, just as the Koryo Dynasty was ending.\nThe Namdae Gate in the Inner Wall was the main gate on the south side of Kaesong.\nPalaces and schools.\nManwoldae Palace is now an archaeological site. It was the royal palace for 500 years. It burned down four times and the people rebuilt it over and over. In modern times, North Korean and South Korean teams have worked at the site together to study it. \nThe ruins of the Kaesong Chomsongdae are also part of the site.. Comsongdae was an observatory where people studied the stars and weather. The Koryo Songgyungwan was a school for government officials and Sungyang Sowon was a school of Confucian philosophy.\nSonjuk Bridge is where the high official Jong Mong Ju was assassinated, an event that was part of the end of the Koryo Dynasty.\nTombs and monuments.\nThe Heritage Site includes large mausoleums for King Wang Kon and King Kongmin. It has two other groups of tombs as well, the Seven Tombs Cluster and Myongrung Tombs Cluster. There are also two steles for Jong Mong Ju, called the Phyochung Monuments. Steles are memorial pillars that may have the dead person's name written on them but do not contain his or her body."}

As a result, the Rhino also has high accuracy and high rate of fire.\nThe Rhino is named after the rhinoceros because it looks somewhat like a rhinoceros's head. Most models shoot the .357 Magnum (as well as the .38 Special), but there are also models that shoot the 9x19mm Parabellum or the S&amp;W .40. Due to its futuristic look, it is often shown in science-fiction movies like the live-action \"Ghost in the Shell\", \"\", and the remake of \"Total Recall\"."}

It is a Confucian royal shrine from the Joseon Dynasty. It was built in the late 1300s, destroyed during a Japanese invasion in the 1500s, and rebuilt in the 1600s. People still use it in modern times.\nThe Jongmyo Shrine holds spirit tablets, each dedicated to a specific king or queen from the Joseon Dynasty. The Confucian way of life includes ancestor worship. During the Joseon Dynasty, the king of Korea would go to Jongmyo to pray to earlier kings and queens. There were also larger rites, with more people. Some of them involved singing and dancing. Some of these rites are still performed in modern times.\nThe layout of the shrine was planned very carefully to complement and work with the hills and other natural structures around it. \nJongmyo has a main shrine, called Jeongjeon. It has a smaller shrine called Yeongnyeongjeon, or \"the Hall of Eternal Peace\" in English. It also has a place specifically for the king, a storage building for ritual items, and a waiting area. There is also a specific shrine to King Kongmin from the earlier Koryo Dynasty. That shrine was built by the Joseon-era King Taejo.\nThe Jongmyo-Daejae, or \"Royal Shrine Ritual\" in English, was the most important rite performed at the shrine. During the Joseon Dynasty, it was performed five times each year. During the Japanese occupation of Korea (1910-1945), it was not performed because the Japanese did not allow it. Since 1969, the Royal Family Association has performed the Jongmyo-Daejae once each year. The Jongmyo-Daejae itself and the music used in the Jongmyo-Daejae were both declared Intangible Cultural Heritage by UNESCO in 2001.\nJongmyo was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995."}

This is done by sending out sound waves, and measuring how long it takes for the echo of the sound to come back. The speed of sound in the water is known, so the depth can be calculated. It is a kind of sonar. Note that the word sounding is used for all kinds of technologies, even though some do not use sound. Before echo sounding was used (in the early 20th century), sounding lines were lowered into the water to measure the depth.\nThe sound reflects off the seafloor and returns to the transducer. The time the sound takes to travel to the bottom and back is used to calculate the distance to the seafloor. Water depth is estimated by using the speed of sound through the water (approximately 1,500 meters per second). The product is divided by two because the measured time is the round-trip time (from the transducer to the seafloor and back to the transducer). The faster the sound pulses return to the transducer from the ocean floor, the shallower the water depth is and the higher the elevation of the sea floor. The sound pulses are sent out regularly as the ship moves along the surface, which produces a line showing the depth of the ocean beneath the ship. This continuous depth data is used to create bathymetry maps of the survey area."}

They study plant life in the forests of oak and maple trees. Now, the 6,000-hectare site is the newest national park, and also 61st national park in the United States. It became Indiana Dunes National Park on February 15, 2019.\nA name change.\nThe park used to be known as Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, managed by National Park service. The related act in February, 2019 did not influence finance and the area of the park at all. It changed the name from Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore into Indiana Dunes National Park. It does, however, give the area the same recognition as more well-known national parks like Yellowstone and Yosemite.\nEcology.\nThe park is one of the most ecologically mixed places in North America. Indiana Dunes has about 1,500 different kinds of plants.\nThe Dunes are also along a major migration path, and birdwatching is a big reason visitors come to Indiana Dunes each year. The area is home to more than 300 species of birds. The birds include waterbirds such as loons and herons, as well as birds of prey like bald eagles and hawks. Several species of songbirds also live there.\nMaple sugar.\nIn winter season, people living near by or visitors enjoy collecting sap from maple trees in the park in order to make maple syrup. Sap is a liquid containing sugar inside the trees. People can get sap by making a small hole in a tree. Maple tree sap was historically collected by local American Indians, pioneers and early residents of a farm.\nA Maple Sugar Time festival is held in March every year. visitors can learn how American Indians first boiled maple sap into sugar, and how early settlers used large iron kettles to make syrup. Pure maple syrup and sugar, and related products like maple-flavored popcorn and maple water, are for sale."}

They are in Jeju Province. Jeju has Mount Halla, a shield volcano located over a volcanic hotspot with many parasitic volcanoes, called oreums, around it. According to UNESCO, the Geomunoreum lava caves are \"the finest lava tube system of caves anywhere.\" UNESCO named Jeju Volcanic Island a Biosphere Reserve in 2002, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007, and a Global Geopark in 2010. It is the only island in the world with three UNESCO designations.\nJeju Volcanic Island started to form 1.8 million years ago when the volcano was still active.\nAccording to UNESCO, the three important things that make Jeju Volcanic Island and lava caves a World Heritage site are the Geomonoreum lava cages, Seongsang Ilchulbong, and Hallasan.\nThe Geomunoreum lava caves are covered in many-colored carbonate deposits on the roof and floor. They formed about 300,000 years ago when magma from the Geomonoreum parasitic volcano cooled.\nThe Seongsan Ilchulbong tuff cone rises straight out of the ocean. It formed between 50,000 and 120,000 years ago from underwater volcanic activity. It is 180 meters tall. Because it is surrounded by cliffs and sharp rocks, many people think it looks like a fortress.\nHallasan, or Mount Halla, also called Yeongjusan Mountain, is Korea's tallest mountain, 1950 meters. It has not been an active volcano for 1000 years. It has many rock formations, a crater lake full of islands, and many cliffs and waterfalls. Over 1800 types of plants live on the mountain and 4000 types of animals, including 3300 species of insects.\nOther parts of Jeju Volcanic Island are considered important by the government of South Korea but not UNESCO. For example, Bijarim Forest, which is on Mount Halla, is Natural Monument No. 374.\nJeju Volcanic Island is a popular tourist destination in South Korea, with 14.4 million visitors in 2019 alone. Environmentalists say they make 20,000 tons of garbage each year. Environmentalists and scientists have said that the government has cut down too much of Jeju's forests to make roads, buildings, resorts and golf courses for visitors. In 2020, environmentalists protested plans to build a second airport on the island. Among other problems, this airport would need a road through Bijarim Forest. This is a forest of nutmeg trees, some of them 800 years old. It is the only place in the world where nutmeg trees grow so closely together.\nIn 2008, Jeju Volcanic Island and Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park became sister parks."}

It was the first hurricane to make landfall on Bermuda since Emily in 1987. The sixth named storm and fifth hurricane of the 2014 Atlantic hurricane season, Fay formed several hundred miles northeast of the Lesser Antilles on October 10. Initially a large subtropical cyclone, the storm gradually turned into a tropical cyclone on October 11 as it turned north. Despite being disrupted by wind shear for most of its duration, Fay steadily intensified. Turning east, Fay briefly achieved Category 1 hurricane status on October. Fay made landfall on Bermuda early on October\u00a012 as a hurricane. Wind shear finally caused Fay to weaken to a tropical storm later that day. Fay weakened into an open trough early on October\u00a013.\nA few tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued due to Fay on Bermuda. Despite its low strength, Fay caused much damage on Bermuda. Wind gusts over 100\u00a0mph (155\u00a0km/h) blocked roads with downed trees and poles. The winds also left a majority of the island's electric customers without power. The terminal building at L.F. Wade International Airport was flooded due to damage to its roof. Along the coast, the storm destroyed numerous boats and unmoored many others. Immediately after the hurricane, 200\u00a0Bermuda Regiment soldiers were called for cleanup and to help in damage repairs. These occurred at the same time as preparations for the stronger Hurricane Gonzalo, which struck the island less than six days later and increased the damage. Fay and Gonzalo were the first pair of hurricanes to make landfall in Bermuda in the same season."}

This was for a fee of up to \u20ac80\u00a0million (\u00a367.6\u00a0million). Fernandes also needed to pass a medical and agree personal terms. The transfer was officially done the day after. The initial fee is around \u20ac55\u00a0million (\u00a347\u00a0million), and up to \u20ac25\u00a0million (\u00a321\u00a0million) in add-ons. Sporting will also get 10% of the profits if United ever sell Fernandes. Fernandes signed a five-and-a-half-year contract.\nHe made his debut on 1 February. He played the full 90 minutes of a 0-0 draw at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers. In Manchester United's 2\u20130 away win over Chelsea on 17 February, he made an assist for the second goal.

He played 66 minutes in a 3\u20133 group stage draw against Spain.\nStyle of play.\nFernandes is an attacking midfielder. He is a direct, energetic playmaker. He can take on defenders and also set the rhythm of play. Because he is direct, Fernandes sometimes takes risks. He tries difficult passes to create chances of scoring goals.He often presses the opposition quickly after losing possession. In addition, he is a a good free-kick taker. He likes to shoot from outside the penalty area. His movement off the ball is also important, as he looks to find space to create chances. Fernandes can also play in a deeper central midfield role, or as a second striker.\nHonours.\nSporting CP\nPortugal\nIndividual"}

The parrot is about 35 cm (14 in) long. \nColours.\nThe male is mostly bright green with a yellow-tinge on the head. It has blue flight feathers, and red flanks and underwing coverts. Its tail is creamy yellow, and is dark grey edged with creamy yellow underneath. The tail feathers are green and blue. The upper beak of the adult male is orange.\nThe female is mostly bright red with a darker hue on the back and wings. The mantle and underwing coverts darken to a more purple in colour. The tail is edged with yellowish-orange above, and is more orange tipped with yellow underneath. The beak of the adult female is all black. The upper beak of the young ones are brown and yellow.\nGeneral principles of bird colouration.\nThe colours are interesting because they are the reverse of normal. In most birds the females are \"self-coloured\" (all one colour, and usually quite dull). Males, who compete for females, are usually brightly coloured. The essential idea is that the female should be dull or camouflaged because she carries the \"precious package\", the eggs. Parrots are often native to tropical forests, where green is camouflage. The males, on the other hand, need to signal their excellent health and general fitness. An extreme case would be the Twelve-wired bird-of-paradise. The implication of colouring in the \"Eclectus\" must be that the selection pressure is somehow different from that experienced by most bird species.\nFeeding.\nThe birds eats fruits, wild figs, unripe nuts, flower and leaf buds, and some seeds. In captivity, they mostly eat fruit. \nThe eclectus has an unusually long digestive tract, so it tolerates food with lots of fiber. In captivity, the eclectus parrot benefits from specially made pellets, fruits, vegetables, and a small amount of seeds and nuts such as almonds and walnuts.\nBreeding.\nIn its natural habitat, the eclectus parrot builds its nests in holes in large rainforest trees. Males may travel up to 20 km to find food. Eclectus parrots are polygynandrous, which means that females may mate with different males, and males may travel from nest to nest to mate with females.\nTwo white eggs are laid. They are incubated for 28\u201330 days. Young fledge at about 11 weeks. Although eclectus parrots usually reach sexual maturity between 2\u20133 years.\nEclectus hens have a strong maternal instinct, which is shown in captivity. It is often possible to place abandoned eggs from other types of parrot under a female eclectus hen, which she will always accept. She will then incubate the egg until it hatches. She will even raise the chick until it grows big enough to leave the nest.\nCaptivity.\nEclectus parrots are one of the popular birds kept in captivity. Unlike many other types of parrot they are easy to breed but are difficult to feed with the hand. Eclectus parrots are generally calm birds in captivity.\nThe average lifespan of the eclectus parrots in captivity is not known, because these birds are not kept in captivity in big numbers until the 1980s. Some sources say that the lifespan is 30 years. The longest lifespan officially recorded is 28.5 years, but a life of 40.8 years has also been reported."}

It has at least one and sometimes two pointed ends. The first mention and patent for it was in February 1872. A person can push a toothpick between their teeth to remove very small pieces of food, after a meal. Toothpicks are also used for celebrations to hold or stick small appetizers (like cheese cubes or olives). \nToothpicks sometimes have plastic frills or look like small paper umbrellas or flags.\nHistory.\nThe toothpick is the oldest tool for cleaning teeth. The skulls of Neanderthals and Homo sapiens, show clear signs of teeth picked with a tool. Toothpicks that are made of bronze have been found in prehistoric graves in Northern Italy and in the East Alps.\nMaterials used to make toothpicks.\nThere are artistic toothpicks made of silver in antiquity, as well as from mastic wood.\nIn the 17th century, toothpicks were luxury objects. They were made using precious metal and set with expensive stones.\nThe first toothpick-manufacturing machine was developed by Marc Signorello in 1869. Another was patented in 1872, by Silas Noble and J. P. Cooley.\nWooden toothpicks are cut from birch wood. Logs are first cut into thin sheets, which are then cut, chopped, milled and bleached into each toothpicks. Plastic toothpicks, also called dental pics, are still made in America in Georgia, by Armond's Manufacturing. Nowadays other ways of keeping include using dental floss, toothbrushes, and oral irrigators."}

It is based in The Hague. It was founded in 1798. The KB collects everything that is published in the Netherlands. It also collection everything about the Netherlands. This includes anything from medieval literature to today's publications (books, newspapers, etc.). There are about 7 million publications in the stockrooms of the library. This includes books, newspapers, magazines and maps. The KB also offers many digital services. The main service is the national online Library. It has e-books and audiobooks. Other digital services include Delpher (millions of digitised pages) and The Memory. Since 2015, the KB has helped to bring together many institutions to make a large digital library.\nHistory.\nRepresentative Albert Jan Verbeek had the idea to create a national library. He suggested this on August 17, 1798. The basis of the collection would be William V's confiscated book collection. The library was officially founded as the \"Nationale Bibliotheek\" on November 8 1798. This was after a group of representatives gave advice for the creation of a national library on the same day. At first, the National Library was only open to members of the Representative Body.\nKing Louis Bonaparte (the brother of Napoleon Bonaparte) gave called the national library the Royal Library in 1806. Napoleon Bonaparte transferred the Royal Library to The Hague as property, while also allowing the Imperial Library in Paris to expropriate publications from the Royal Library. In 1815 King William I of the Netherlands confirmed the name of 'Royal Library' (Dutch: Koninklijke Bibliotheek) by royal resolution. It has been known as the National Library of the Netherlands since 1982, when it opened new quarters. The institution became 'Independent Administrative Body' of the state in 1996, although it is financed by the Department of Education, Culture and Science. On 18 November 2014 the Wsob (Public Library Facilities System Act or 'Library Act') came into being. The act became valid on 1 January 2015 and from this moment onwards four organizations from the library world continued under the name Koninklijke Bibliotheek. These organizations are Sector Institute Public Libraries (SIOB), the Foundation Bibliotheek.nl (BNL), the Digital Library for Dutch Literature (DBNL) and the Koninklijke Bibliotheek (KB).\nCollection.\nThe humanities are central to the collection of the KB, with an emphasis on Dutch history, language and culture.\nIn 2016, the KB contained 7,000,000 items, equivalent to 115 kilometers of bookshelves. Most items in the collection are books. There are also pieces of \"grey literature\", where the author, publisher, or date may not be apparent but the document has cultural or intellectual significance. The collection contains almost the entire literature of the Netherlands, from medieval manuscripts to modern scientific publications. As there was no law for depositing Dutch publication the library started on January 1 1974 the voluntary . This in contrast with most other countries that have a legal deposit of publications. For a publication to be accepted, it must be from a registered Dutch publisher. \nThe collection is accessible for members. Any person aged 16 years or older can become a member. One day passes are also available. Requests for material take approximately 30 minutes. The KB hosts several open access websites, including the \"Memory of the Netherlands\" (\"Geheugen van Nederland\"), Digital Library for Dutch Literature and Delpher, an archive of more than 100 million pages as of 2020.\nLiterature museum.\nThe Literature museum (in Dutch: Literatuurmuseum) was founded in 1750 as Nederlands Letterkundig Museum, The museum contains a large collection of letters, manuscripts and memorabilia. The museum has three permanent and several temporary exhibitions. It also contains a special children's book museum. On 4 February 2016, an online museum was opened. On 1 November 2016, the museum was renamed to Literature museum. The museum has a reading room with an extensive collection of newspaper clipping, and under certain conditions, some archival material can be consulted.\nResearch.\nThe KB's Research Department is engaged in internationally renowned research in the field of digital technology, sustainable preservation and accessibility of both paper and digital heritage. Important topics are the applicability of artificial intelligence, the use of big data, the increasing importance of privacy &amp; security, the changes in the publishing and publishing world and the role of public libraries in today's society."}

{"id": "784649", "revid": "495413", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=784649", "title": "MacGuffin", "text": "In fiction, a MacGuffin is an object, detail, or event in the story that is important to the plot or the motivation of the story's characters. The term was first used by filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock. He was not the first to use or discover the trope, but he is given credit for coming up with the name. Other filmmakers like George Lucas used the term MacGuffin as well, but their definition was somewhat different from Hitchcock's. Nevertheless, details about MacGuffins below will describe Hitchcock's point of view.\nAccording to Hitchcock, the MacGuffin has no importance other than moving the story forward, and it has no meaning by itself. It does not matter what the \"thing\" the characters want is, as long as it drives the character or moves the plot forward. In other words, any detail of a story is a MacGuffin if it can be replaced by something else without changing the rest of the story. If changing what the \"thing\" the characters want changes anything else in the story, then it is not a MacGuffin.\nAn example of a MacGuffin is Marsellus Wallace's briefcase in the movie \"Pulp Fiction\". Getting the suitcase and giving it back to Marsellus Wallace is the reason why Wallace's hit men are willing to kill other people and risk their lives to keep it, but what is inside the briefcase is never shown or explained. According to the movie's writer and director Quentin Tarantino, he says that whatever is in the briefcase is whatever the audience wants it to be, because such knowledge of what is inside does not affect the story at all.\nAn example of a detail that is not a MacGuffin is the Ark of the Covenant in the movie \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\". Even though the Ark is important to the motivation of the movie's hero, Indiana Jones, and the villains, the Nazis, the Ark's importance becomes more clear in the later half of the movie, and it cannot be replaced by anything else because the Nazis' misuse of the Ark was the direct cause of their death at the climax of the movie."}

The phrase is commonly translated as \"don't touch me\". In Koine Greek, the phrase reads \u039c\u03ae \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u1f05\u03c0\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 (\"m\u1e17 mou h\u00e1ptou\"), which is translated differently, as cease holding on to me or stop clinging to me. Many artists and painters have been inspired by the phrase.\nText.\nIn the translation of Saint Jerome, the text is as follows:\n\"11. Maria \"autem stabat ad monumentum foris, plorans. Dum ergo fleret, inclinavit se, et prospexit in monumentum\"\" - Mary [on the other hand] was near the tomb and wept. While she was weeping, she bent forwards and looked inside the tomb\n\"12. \"et vidit duos angelos in albis sedentes, unum ad caput, et unum ad pedes, ubi positum fuerat corpus Jesu.\" - And she sees two angels, [dressed in] white, which were sitting, where the corpse of Jesus had been; one at the head, the other at the feet.\n\"13. \"Dicunt ei illi : Mulier, quid ploras ? Dicit eis : Quia tulerunt Dominum meum : et nescio ubi posuerunt eum.\" - They ask her: woman, why do you weep - she answers them: They have taken my lord, and I don't know where they have put him\"\n\"14. \"H\u00e6c cum dixisset, conversa est retrorsum, et vidit Jesum stantem : et non sciebat quia Jesus est.\" - When she had said this, she turned around, and she sees Jesus standing [there], and she did not know that it was Jesus\"\n\"15 . Dicit ei Jesus : Mulier, quid ploras ? quem qu\u00e6ris ? Illa existimans quia hortulanus esset, dicit ei : Domine, si tu sustulisti eum, dicito mihi ubi posuisti eum, et ego eum tollam.\" - Jesus asked her: Woman, why do you weep? Who are you looking for? - She answered him, thinking he was the gardener: My lord, if it was you who took him, you should tell me where you put him, and I will remove him.\n\"16: \"Dicit ei Jesus : Maria. Conversa illa, dicit ei : Rabboni (quod dicitur Magister).\" - Jesus said to her \"Maria\" - she turned around, and said \"Raboni\", which means master\n\"17. \u00a0 \"Dicit ei Jesus : Noli me tangere, nondum enim ascendi ad Patrem meum : vade autem ad fratres meos, et dic eis : Ascendo ad Patrem meum, et Patrem vestrum, Deum meum, et Deum vestrum.\" - Jesus told her: Don't touch me, because I have not risen towards my father. Go, to my brothers, and tell them: I rise twords my father and your father, my god and your god.\n\"18. \u00a0 \"Venit Maria Magdalene annuntians discipulis : Quia vidi Dominum, et h\u00e6c dixit mihi. - Maria of Magdala comes, and she tells the disciples: I have seen the lord, and that's what he told me.\""}

They are marketed as 'Sveriges mest k\u00f6pta bil' (Swedish for \"Sweden's most bought car\"), which might technically be correct because of the total number of marshmallows in the shape of cars that are sold.

The risk factors for developing ovarian cancer rates are higher in lesbian women.\nMany doctors find woman-to-woman sex to have negligible risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

He is also famous for being the rosh yeshiva of the Radin Yeshiva.\nChildhood.\nRabbi Kagan was born on January 26, 1838 in Dzyatlava, a town that was in those days part of the Russian Empire (nowadays in Belarus). His parents were Rabbi Aryeh Zev and Dobrusha Kagan. When he was nine years old, his father brought him to Vilnius to study in the yeshiva that Rabbi Chaim Nachman Parnes ran. His father was a teacher in the yeshiva as well. Rabbi Kagan's father died when he was eleven years old.

In the 1870s, he wrote the \"Sefer Chofetz Chaim\", a book that discusses the \"halachos\" (Jewish laws) about not saying hurtful things. The book was very popular, and nowadays, he's known as the \"Chofetz Chaim.\" In 1907, he completed a six volume series called the \"Mishna Berurah\", in which he discussed the \"halachos\" pertaining to Jews' everyday life, Shabbat, and holidays. He became famous to Orthodox Jews and many people came to visit him for blessings; he was considered the leader of Orthodox Jewry. He passed away on September 15, 1933."}

He was born in New York City on January 27, 1885 and died in New York City on November 11, 1945 at the age of 60.\nJerome Kern is often called the father of American musical theater. Kern is remembered for the hundreds of songs he wrote for musical plays and movies. Music historians say that Kern gave artistic importance to American popular music for the first time. And, they say, he led the development of the first truly American theater music.\nYounger days.\nJerome Kern was born into a middle-class family in New York City in 1885. Jerome\u2019s mother, Fanny, loved the piano. She began to teach Jerome how to play when he was very young. He became a fair piano player but not so good that anyone expected him to become a great musician.\nJerome was a quiet boy and not a top student. When he completed high school, his father said he would have to work in the family\u2019s store. Mister Kern said his son could never make money writing music. But he later came to believe that Jerome might do better in music than in business after all. So he let the boy go to Europe to study music, as almost all serious young musicians did at the time.\nAs a songwriter.\nJerome Kern began his career as a songwriter in theaters in London and New York City. Success came quickly. By the early 1920s, Kern was a successful young composer for Broadway musical comedies. In one three-year period alone, he wrote music for 19 shows.\nOther people wrote the words for Kern's songs. Kern wrote only the music. And he worked with each song until he was satisfied that the music was perfect. He almost never changed his music to fit the words. One of Kern's best-loved songs is \"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\", sung by Dinah Washington.\nAlthough Kern's songs are easy to remember after hearing a few times, they are not simple. His melodies -- the musical line of the song -- are always inventive, even demanding. An example of his inventiveness is the song \"All the Things You Are\". Several composers say they consider it the greatest song ever written. Singers continue to like Kern songs because they can be sung in many different ways. The melody remains the same. But different singers can change the feeling of the song completely.\nJerome Kern once said he was trying to bring modern art to music. One critic wrote this about his music: Kern's songs are like black and white drawings. They need no color, no decoration. A Kern song is always in balance, perfect in form and pleasing in design. Here is an example, \"Why Do I Love You?\" played by Andre Previn and friends.\nInfluence on musical play.\nAll but one of Kern's songs were written for musical plays. American musical plays at that time were still usually copied from European ones. Often the stories seemed foolish and the people in them did not seem real. Songs and dances often had no connection to the story.\nKern wanted to try something completely new. He thought a musical play should be a real work of art, not just a collection of songs and dances. He thought songs should help move the action of the play along, by showing a person's feelings. Kern wanted to do a truly American musical, with real American characters and real situations.\nIn 1927, he found the story he wanted. It was the book \"Show Boat\" by American writer Edna Ferber. \"Show Boat\" takes place in the 1818s on a passenger steam boat that travels along the Mississippi River. The boat is called a show boat because singers and dancers entertain the passengers. The captain of the show boat has a daughter who is a singer on the boat. She falls in love with a man who earns his money by gambling with cards.\nThe story dealt with some unusually serious issues for a musical. It showed the hard lives of African-Americans in the South. And it showed marriage between people of different races, which was against the law at that time. Although serious in places, \"Show Boat\" was not a tragedy.\nThe public and critics loved it. \"Show Boat\" became the greatest work of American musical theater. Music critics said Kern's effect on musical theater was revolutionary. It was Kern's music that made the show a great success. Perhaps his most famous song was written for \"Show Boat.\" It is called \"Ol' Man River\".\nIt is about what life was like for black people who worked along the Mississippi River. Edna Ferber later remembered her excitement when Kern first played the melody for her. She said her hair stood up, and tears came to her eyes. Paul Robeson sang the song."}
