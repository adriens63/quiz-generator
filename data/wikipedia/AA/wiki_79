He was particularly famous for playing chamber music and was one of the original members of the Beaux Arts Trio (a group of three musicians: a pianist, violinist and cellist).\nEarly life.\nGreenhouse was born in Newark, New Jersey to a musical family. He started to learn the cello when he was nine. He studied with Felix Salmond at the Juilliard School of Music in New York City. Then he studied with the great cellist Emmanuel Feuermann. He was also one of the very few students of the legendary cellist Pablo Casals.\nWhen he started his career he soon became the principal cellist of the CBS Symphony Orchestra from 1938-1942 and he also played chamber music with the Dorian String Quartet. After his studies with Casals he gave many solo recitals, but most of all he loved chamber music.\nCareer.\nIn 1955, he met the violinist Daniel Guilet and the pianist Menahem Pressler in New York. Together they formed the Beaux Arts Trio. This group became a world famous trio. Bernard Greenhouse played with them until 1987. \nAt the time there were a few string quartets who were famous, but the idea of having success as a piano trio seemed strange. However, Columbia Artists asked them to play in 10 concerts, then they were offered 80 concerts. Soon they were performing in Europe and then all over the world, giving about 130 concerts a year in the USA alone and making many recordings. \nBernard Greenhouse taught at the Julliard and Manhattan schools of music in New York and at several other music schools in the USA. \nWhen he retired he went to live in Massachusetts. There he gave lessons to talented young players, never charging them fees. Greenhouse was given many awards, including the Prix Mondial du Disque and the US Presidential Medallion 1985.\nGreenhouse was still playing the cello at the age of 95. He died in Wellfleet, Massachusetts on Cape Cod, on May 13, 2011."}

It is about 280\u00a0kilometres (straight line \u2013 646\u00a0km by road) from the capital city Adelaide.\nHistory.\nThe first people to live in the area were the Barngarla (Parnkalla) people, who are Indigenous Australian people. The name they used to call this area was Galinyala.\nEuropean people settled in the area in 1836.\nBritish Royal Navy explorer Matthew Flinders discovered the harbour in February 1802. He named it \"Port\" Lincoln rather than just Lincoln, where Flinders came from.\nFresh water.\nPort Lincoln may have become the state capital of the future South Australia, but it did not have a good water supply.. Even as a small town, Port Lincoln could not get enough fresh water, which is now supplied mostly from the underground aquifers to the south of the city. Recently the water supply on the Eyre Peninsula has been connected to Murray River water through a link from Kimba to Whyalla to connect into the Morgan to Whyalla pipeline water.\nDemographics.\nAbout 14,245 people live in the Port Lincoln area as of 2006.

The crew was given shore leave in Port Lincoln, encountering large amounts of Australian wine. \"Moshulu\" finally sailed to Port Victoria for cargo.\nDuring the 1939 season, \"Passat\" and \"Lawhill\" also went to Port Lincoln. Newby wrote about his round-trip from Ireland to South Australia in his book \"The Last Grain Race\" (1956).

They are joined by the Eyre Highway across the inland edge, and the Flinders Highway and Lincoln Highway along the west and east coasts.\nThe major industry is farming - cereal crops, sheep, and cattle in the dry north area. More water-intensive farming such as dairy farming and growing wine industry happen in the south. Many coastal towns have commercial fishing. Port Lincoln had a large tuna fishing fleet, which is now changing to fish farming in bays along the coast. The Eyre Peninsula has a growing population of around 55,390 people.\nThere is a commercial nephrite jade mine near Cowell. Iron ore is mined in the hills near Iron Knob and taken by rail to Whyalla for smelting.\nNational Parks located on the Eyre Peninsula include Lincoln National Park, Coffin Bay National Park, Gawler Ranges National Park, and several conservation parks and reserves like Acraman Creek Conservation Park.\nIn January 2005, bushfires on the Eyre Peninsula killed nine people.\nTransport.\nThe peninsular is served by the isolated narrow gauge Eyre Peninsula Railway."}

It has a hotel, cafe, general store and a post office.\nIn December 1859, a shepherd called Robert Blinman, from the nearby Angorichina station (farm) found copper. He was nickmaned \"Peg Leg\" because he had a wooden leg. With a group of friends he started the Wheal Blinman, a copper mine in 1861. The town grew quickly and by 1869 there were about 1,500 people living there. Many miners were Cornish men, who had been mining for copper at Burra, South Australia. The mine, later called the Blinman Consolidated Copper Mining Company of South Australia, soon became the biggest and most productive mine in the Flinders Ranges. About 10,000 tonnes of copper were taken from the mine which finally closed in 1918.\nWilliam Kekwick (died 1872), who explored South Australia and the Northern Territory with John McDouall Stuart, is buried in the Blinman cemetery.\nThe Blinman Copper Mine is now a tourist attraction, and visitors can explore the underground mine."}

He developed new ideas about education for the oppressed - people who have been trodden down.\nQuotes.\nPaulo Freire wrote about the philosophy of education that came not only from old school such as Plato, but also from modern Marxist and anti-colonialist thinkers. In fact, in many ways his \"Pedagogy of the Oppressed\" (1970) may be best read as an extension of, or reply to, Frantz Fanon\u2019s \"The Wretched of the Earth\" (1961), which emphasized the need to provide native populations with an education which was simultaneously new and modern (rather than traditional) and anti-colonial (not simply an extension of the culture of the colonizer).\nIn \"Pedagogy of the Oppressed\" (1970), Freire, talks about the oppressors-oppressed distinction,seeing differences between the two positions in an unjust society: the oppressor and the oppressed. Freire makes no direct reference to his most direct influence for the distinction, which stems back to a least Hegel in 1802, and has since been reprised by many authors including Engels, Marx, Lenin, Gramsci, Simone Weil and others.\nFreire advocates that education allows the oppressed to regain their humanity and overcome their condition; however, he acknowledges that in order for this to take effect, the oppressed have to play a role in their own liberation. As he states:\nNo pedagogy which is truly liberating can remain distant from the oppressed by treating them as unfortunates and by presenting for their emulation models from among the oppressors. The oppressed must be their own example in the struggle for their redemption (Freire, 1970, p. 54).\nLikewise, the oppressors must also be willing to rethink their way of life and to examine their own role in the oppression if true liberation is to occur; \"those who authentically commit themselves to the people must re-examine themselves constantly\" (Freire, 1970, p.\u00a060).\nThe ideas of Paulo Freire.\nFreire believed education to be a political act that could not be divorced from pedagogy. Freire defined this as a main tenet of critical pedagogy. Teachers and students must be made aware of the \"politics\" that surround education. The way students are taught and what they are taught serves a political agenda. Teachers, themselves, have political notions they bring into the classroom (Kincheloe, 2008). Freire believed that \"education makes sense because women and men learn that through learning they can make and remake themselves, because women and men are able to take responsibility for themselves as beings capable of knowing \u2014 of knowing that they know and knowing that they don't\" (Freire, 2004, p.\u00a015)\nPedagogy: How teachers teach.\nIn terms of actual pedagogy, Freire is best known for his attack on what he called the \"banking\" concept of education, in which the student was viewed as an empty account to be filled by the teacher. He notes that \"it transforms students into receiving objects. It attempts to control thinking and action, leads men and women to adjust to the world, and inhibits their creative power\" (Freire, 1970, p.\u00a077). The basic critique was not new \u2014 Rousseau\u2019s conception of the child as an active learner was already a step away from tabula rasa (which is basically the same as the \u201cbanking concept\u201d). In addition, thinkers like John Dewey were strongly critical of the transmission of mere facts as the goal of education. Dewey often described education as a mechanism for social change, explaining that \u201ceducation is a regulation of the process of coming to share in the social consciousness; and that the adjustment of individual activity on the basis of this social consciousness is the only sure method of social reconstruction\u201d (1897, p.\u00a016). Freire\u2019s work, however, updated the concept and placed it in context with current theories and practices of education, laying the foundation for what is now called critical pedagogy.\nTeachers and students: an organic whole.\nMore challenging is Freire's strong aversion to the teacher-student difference. This splitis admitted in Rousseau and constrained in Dewey, but Freire comes close to insisting that it be completely abolished. This is hard to imagine in absolute terms, since there must be some enactment of the teacher-student relationship in the parent-child relationship, but what Freire suggests is that a deep reciprocity be inserted into our notions of teacher and student. He goes so far as to say that \u201cEducation must begin with the solution of the teacher-student contradiction, by reconciling the poles of the contradiction so that both are simultaneously students and teachers\u201d (Freire, 1970, p.\u00a072). Freire wants us to think in terms of teacher-student and student-teacher \u2013 that is, a teacher who learns and a learner who teaches \u2013 as the basic roles of classroom participation.\nFreire however insists that educator and student, though sharing democratic social relations of education, are not on an equal footing, but the educator must be humble enough to be disposed to relearn that which he/she already thinks she knows, through interaction with the learner. The authority which the educator enjoys must not be allowed to degenerate into authoritarianism; teachers must recognize that \"their fundamental objective is to fight alongside the people for the recovery of the people's stolen humanity\", not to \"win the people over\" to their side (Freire, 1970, p.\u00a095)."}

Written in 1931 by lyricist E. Y. \"Yip\" Harburg and composer Jay Gorney, \"Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?\" was part of the 1932 musical \"New Americana;\" the melody is based on a Russian lullaby Gorney heard as a child. It became best known, however, through recordings by Bing Crosby and Rudy Vallee. Both versions were released right before Franklin Delano Roosevelt's election to the presidency and both became number one hits on the charts. The Brunswick Crosby recording became the best-selling record of its period, and came to be viewed as an anthem of the shattered dreams of the era.\nSummary.\nThe song asks why the men who built the nation \u2013 built the railroads, built the skyscrapers \u2013 who fought in the war (World War I), who tilled the earth, who did what their nation asked of them should, now that the work is done and their labor no longer necessary, find themselves abandoned, in bread lines.\nMusical structure.\nThe song has unusual structure for a Broadway song. Firstly, rather than starting in a major key, as most Broadway songs do, it begins in a minor key, which is darker, and more appropriate for the Depression. When discussing the prosperous past and building the railroads, the song jumps an octave and moves briefly into a major key, evoking energy and optimism. It then reverts to a minor key in the word \"time\" in the line \"Once I built a railroad, made it run / Made it race against time,\" marking the end of prosperous times, and changing to a wistful mood. The song then ends, not on a note of resignation, but with anger \u2013 repeating the beginning (as is usual for Broadway songs), an octave higher, but with a significant change: the friendly \"\"Brother,\" can you spare a dime?\" is replaced with the aggressive \"\"Buddy,\" can you spare a dime?\"\nUpdate.\nDuring the bad times in the 1970s, the \"New York Times\" asked Harburg to update \"Brother\" for a new age, and he responded with:"}

After a song and a comic encounter with Laxman's daughter Geeta (Manimala), he falls in love with her. He also achieves very good success in convincing Geeta's father into starting the project. During a sight visit for the project, his suitcase gets swapped with a similar suitcase of a co-passenger named Mala (Manorama), which is full of money. For this reason Ramesh is detained in a police lock-up. Also Mala is revealed to be part of a criminal gang. When the gang leader, Jumboo, is not able to kill Mala (because he needs a particular diary from her), he instead arranges a dangerous rowdy named Bijua Pakiri (R.S. Manohar)to kill Ramesh within the lock-up.\nHowever, instead of killing Ramesh, Bijua decides to hold Ramesh captive. Together they escape the lock-up that very night to prove Ramesh's innocence. Bijua also angers the criminal gang of Mala, when he asks for a greater sum in return for killing Ramesh. When a mysterious man (Gemini Ganesan) makes phone calls and tried to save Ramesh from captivity, Ramesh escapes by himself out into the city. The mysterious man also attacks Bijua before running away. The criminal gang try to kill Bijua but he escapes after a fight. Geeta meets him and helps him by giving him a hanky and some milk from her flask.\nRamesh being chased by police, Bijua Pakiri and the criminal gang attempts to fake his death. Geeta believing his death to be real comes to the waterfall where he committed suicide and learns that he is not really dead. They both go one of the villas owned by Geeta's father, and make a secret stay there. Bijua confronts them and threatens to kill Ramesh but is tamed by the very pleading words of Geeta. He instead promises to help Ramesh out of the situation. Both Bijua and Ramesh don disguises to roam about in public, to search for Mala and with her prove his innocence. But, they are chased by police and are lead to a comic encounter where they sing a song for a dance by Savitri. Later, Mala and Babu drive a car together and develop romantic feelings for one another. When Ramesh and Bijua get to know this, they try to use their relationship to get the truth out of Mala. But their plan backfires.\nAfter this, the mysterious man (Gemini Ganesan) appears secretly inside Ramesh's car promising to help him. He accepts that he is a police officer when asked, and says he knows that Ramesh is innocent. But leaves when Bijua and Babu enter the car. Men from the criminal gang disguise as policemen and \"arrest\" Ramesh whom they intend to murder at a safe spot. However, with the help of his friends Ramesh escapes.\nLater, the same mysterious man appears once again, and meets Ramesh once again to tell him that he knows Mala well and also Bijua is planning to give off Ramesh to the criminal gang, for money. Ramesh, believes him and starts to avoid Bijua, telling him that he now knows his true colours.\nWhen Mala is forced by Jumboo, the gangleader, to fly abroad, she is confronted by the still mysterious man who forces her to give him the diary, failing which she would end up in jail. But she is shot by a shadowy figure, who is then chased by the mysterious man. But, Bijua gets hold of the diary after coming there. Ramesh learns of the death of Mala and becomes sad. Jumboo arrives there and Bijua confronts him, now asking for twice the earlier amount for the diary and the life of Ramesh.\nBijua takes Ramesh with him to prove his innocence, after pleading with Ramesh and Geeta for a long time. They arrive at a cave on a hill. There Bijua tries to sell Ramesh and the Diary for the agreed sum, apparently betraying Ramesh. The mysterious man arrives at the scene to whom Ramesh explains the situation.\nWhen the mysterious man tries to act his police disguise there, Bijua reveals he is Mr.Prakash, the true leader of the crime gang and he himself is Inspector Sekar of Vigilance Branch. With this information both Prakash and Ramesh are startled. After some talk an elaborate fight and chase scene, Mr.Prakash drives a boat that crashes into a rock fatally killing him. Ramesh is proven innocent through the information in the diary.\nBijua (now Inspector Sekar) attends the marriage of Ramesh and Geeta in full inspector uniform.

He extrapolates this critical remark to the media across the board and its failure to focus public attention on the putative biological hazard of nuclear power.\nCritics.\nB.J. Bullert, in his book \"Public Television: Politics and the Battle over Documentary Film\" protested what he viewed as censorship. He stated that Dark Circle was outside of the mainstream at that time but now the viewpoint in the movie is widely accepted. Nat Katzman, former KQED station manager, disagreed. He is quoted in Bullert's book, saying \"It's more difficult to say (\"Dark Circle\") falsified anything, but it left one with the uncomfortable feeling that this is propaganda, not journalism\".\nPoint of view.\nThe movie is clearly created to raise public alarm about the hazards of nuclear power. It is also about problems at the regulatory agency, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). However, there are numerous points in the movie in which the voices heard are those of the workers. We also hear from the Pacific Gas and Electric management, and the lawyer for the NRC."}

{"id": "297241", "revid": "420403", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=297241", "title": "English grammar", "text": "English grammar is the grammar of the English language. Grammar is the rules about how to speak and write in a language. English grammar started out based on Old English, which is considered to be a Germanic language. After the Norman French conquered England in 1066, parts of the Latin language were brought to the English language by the Norman French.\nDialect grammar.\nDialects of English vary not only in pronunciation but in grammar. For example, people who use what is called General American English or BBC English might say, \"I didn't do anything\", while someone who speaks what is called African American Vernacular English might say, \"I didn't do nothing\". London working class version: \"I ain't done nuffink!\" The dialect a person uses is usually decided by where they live. \nEven though the dialects of English use different words or word order, they still have grammar rules. However, when writing in American English, grammar uses the rules of General American English. When people talk about using \"proper English\", they usually mean using the grammar of general British English, as described in standard reference works. The models for \"spoken\" English in Britain are often called Received Pronunciation or BBC English.\nWord endings.\nEnglish makes few changes to its word endings. These are called ('suffixes'): plurals and possessives (\"John's\") are the most common. English verbs drop most endings except one: I love, you love, they love, but \"she loves\". That final 's' is a remnant of Anglo-Saxon, which had more suffixes. Verbs do have endings which show changes in tense: walked, walking.\nWord order.\nWord order is the other big difference. In English, adjectives usually come before the noun. Most Romance languages normally put their adjectives after the nouns. For example, in English, a person may say \"I like fast cars\", but in Spanish, it is \"Me gustan los coches r\u00e1pidos\" [coches = cars; r\u00e1pidos = fast]. The order of the words has changed: if just the words, without the grammar, are translated into English, it would mean 'to me they please the cars fast'. This is because Spanish and English have different rules about word order. In German, main verbs often come near the end of sentences, but in English we usually put them between subject and object, as: \"the cat sat on the mat\".\nParts of speech.\nGrammar studies the different parts of language. The parts of language are called \"parts of speech.\" The parts of speech are nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections.\nNouns.\na noun is a word that names something, such as a person, place, thing, or idea. They can be a single thing such as an apple. They can also be plural such as a box of apples. There is a special kind of noun called a proper noun, which is a name. For instance, Johnny Appleseed.\nPronouns.\nPronouns are words that take the place of nouns. We often use them to avoid repeating the nouns that they refer to. An example is the word \"it.\" In the sentence \"I like the ball; it is blue,\" you have to look at what comes before \"it\" to know that \"it\" is talking about the ball. The noun before a pronoun that the pronoun really means is called the antecedent.\nThere are different types of pronouns in English language. The most important ones are:\nVerbs.\nThe basic verb form is called the infinitive. The infinitive for existence is \"to be\". A famous example is the speech of Hamlet: to be or not to be?\nVariations of the infinitive create verb tenses. \nAdjectives.\nWords that tell you about nouns are called adjectives. When an adjective is used, you learn more about the noun. An example would be the words \"red\" and \"juicy\" in the phrase \"the red apple is juicy.\" They do not have any endings. Even if the noun they talk about is plural, they stay the same. You can see this in the sentence \"the red apples are juicy.\"\nDeterminers.\nDeterminers are words placed in front of a noun to make it clear what the noun refers to. The difference is each noun can only have one determiner and the determiner always comes before all the other parts of the noun phrase. The most common determiners in English are \"the\" and \"a/an\".\nAdverbs.\nAdverbs are words that tell you about words that are not nouns. An adverb can describe a verb, like the word \"quickly\" in the sentence \"He ran quickly.\" They can also describe an adjective. The adverb \"very\" describes the adjective \"sick\" in the sentence \"The boy is very sick.\" Adverbs can even describe other adverbs, as in the sentence \"He ran very quickly.\"\nPrepositions.\nA preposition is a word that describes how one noun (or pronoun) relates to another in the sentence as a whole. The preposition usually comes before the noun that it adds to the sentence, which is called the object of the preposition. An example is the word \"over\" in the sentence \"he walked over the bridge.\"\nConjunctions.\nA conjunction is a word that connects other parts of a sentence. It can connect two words that both do the same thing in a sentence. \"And\" in the sentence \"the boy and the girl run\" connects the boy to the girl because they both run. Conjunctions can even connect two clauses that would normally be different sentences together. The word \"but\" in the sentence \"I like cats, but he likes dogs\" is a conjunction doing this.\nInterjections.\nInterjections are words that do not fit normal grammar rules. Interjections can and often do take the place of an entire sentence, as they can give they meaning of a whole sentence in a single word. These can be used to show emotions, such as the word \"Hooray,\" which means that the speaker is happy or likes something. They are also used to shorten common phrases that would otherwise need a full sentence to talk about. For example, saying the word \"yes\" is much simpler than saying \"what you say is true,\" so it is usually used instead. Interjections like these can be helpful for saving time and making complex sentences very simple. Often, though, interjections may have no meaning at all, such as the word \"um.\"\nSyntax.\nGrammar also studies how the parts of language work together. This is called \"syntax.\" Some common ways in which the words fit together are sentences, phrases, clauses, and paragraphs."}

Most of Dor\u00e9's work was wood engraving and steel engraving.\nBiography.\nDor\u00e9 was born in Strasbourg. His first illustrated story was published at the age of fifteen. As a young man, he began work as a literary illustrator in Paris. He was hired to illustrate scenes from books by Rabelais, Balzac, Milton and Dante.\nIn 1853, Dor\u00e9 was asked to illustrate the works of Lord Byron. British publishers asked him to do more work, including a new illustrated English Bible. Ten years later, he illustrated a French edition of Cervantes's \"Don Quixote\". His images of the knight and Sancho Panza have influenced later readers, artists, and stage and film directors' ideas of how the two characters looked. Dor\u00e9 also illustrated an edition of Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Raven\" with larger than usual pages. He was paid 30,000 francs by the publisher Harper &amp; Brothers in 1883.\nDor\u00e9's English Bible (1866) was a great success, and in 1867 Dor\u00e9 had a major exhibition of his work in London. The Dor\u00e9 Gallery in Covelant Bond Street opened after the show. In 1869, Blanchard Jerrold suggested that they work together to make a complete portrait of London. Jerrold got the idea from \"The Microcosm of London\" produced by Rudolph Ackermann, William Pyne, and Thomas Rowlandson in 1808. Dor\u00e9 signed a five-year contract with the publishers Grant &amp; Co. He had to stay in London for three months each year. He was paid \u00a310,000 a year for the project.\nThe completed book, \"London: A Pilgrimage,\" was published in 1872. It had 180 engravings. The book was successful financially and influenced many people. However, many critics at the time disliked it. Some of these critics wrote that Dor\u00e9 paid too much attention to the poverty in parts of London.\nHis later works included Coleridge's \"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\", Milton's \"Paradise Lost\", Tennyson's \"The Idylls of the King\", \"The Works of Thomas Hood\", and \"The Divine Comedy\". His work also appeared in the \"Illustrated London News\".\nHe continued to illustrate books until he died in Paris after a short illness in 1883. He is buried in P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.\nList of works.\nDor\u00e9 made many works of art. This list is very long, but does not include every piece of art that Dor\u00e9 made.

They vibrate during flight, and help the insect fly better.\nThe halteres evolved from wings. Ancestral flying insects had two pairs of wings, like dragonflies, hymenoptera and lepidoptera still do. Flies have only the front pair of wings.\nFunction.\nHalteres help balancing and improve flight. They help flies to perform their fast aerobatics. In addition to providing rapid feedback to the muscles steering the wings, they also help stabilise the head during flight.\nThey are flapped rapidly and work as gyroscopes, telling the insect about its body position during flight.\nEvery vibrating object tends to maintain its plane of vibration, a result of the Coriolis effect. If the body of the insect changes direction in flight or rotates about its axis, the vibrating halteres exert a force on the body. The insect detects this force with sensory organs at the base of the halteres.\nThe two halteres vibrate in different planes, each forming an angle of about 45 degrees with the long axis of the insect. This increases the information got from the halteres.\nDevelopment.\nIn Diptera, the formation of the haltere during metamorphosis is dependent on the homeotic gene \"Ultrabithorax\" (Ubx). If this gene is experimentally deactivated, the haltere will develop into a fully developed wing. This is an excellent illustration of an important mechanism of evolutionary development; a simple homeotic gene change can result in a radically different phenotype.\nConvergent evolution.\nThe Strepsiptera, small insects parasitic on bees, wasps and cockroaches, also have halteres. We know the evolution was independent because in the Strepsiptera the \"forewings\" evolved into halteres while, in the Diptera, the \"hindwings\" changed into halteres. This is a classic case of convergent evolution.\nGrimaldi and Engel say halteres have evolved at least seven times in insects, and \"in most cases it is known to be associated with improved manoeuvering in flight\"."}

The museum is housed in a historic former silk mill which is part of Derwent Valley Mills. Between 1717 and 1721 George Sorocold built Britain\u2019s first mill beside the River Derwent. This mill was built to produce silk threads using machines powered by a water wheel. The museum re-opened with the new name, the Museum of Making on 21 May 2021.\nJohn Lombe copied the design for the machines used for spinning large quantities of silk, when he was working within the Italian Silk Industry. This may be the first example of industrial espionage.\nTraditionally the spinning wheel had been used for producing small quantities of silk thread at the homes of local spinsters. But these new, large machines were able to produce far greater quantities of silk and came to compete with the Italians. However, these machines required large buildings and a huge power source. An undershot water wheel turned by the mill fleam on the west side of the new Silk Mill drove these large spinning machines.\nJohn Lombe unnaturally died in 1722. It was believed that he was killed with poison by an Italian as the revenge for stealing trade secrets. His half brother, Sir Thomas Lombe Knt., died on 2 June 1739 leaving his estate to his widow and their two daughters. \nDame Elizabeth advertised the lease of the building and machinery in 1739, and the remaining 64 years of the lease were assigned to Richard Wilson junior of Leeds for \u00a32,800.\nRichard Wilson stayed in Leeds and took a proportion of the profits. The mill was conducted by William and Samuel Lloyd (both London merchants) and Thomas Bennet as salaried manager.\nA description of the mill by William Wilson dating from sometime between 1739 and 1753 is left as follows:\nThese circular spinning machines (also known as 'throwing machines'), were the most progressive feature of the factory. Also, they used the single source of power (water), and employed many organized workers (200-400, according to recent sources). Due to these total process of production from raw silk to fine quality thread, the Lombes' silk mill is regarded as the first successful use of the factory system in Britain.\nThe Silk Mill was visited by many tourists. For example, Boswell visited there in September 1777. Not all visitors thought that the mill was in good condition. Torrington commented on the \"heat, stinks and noise\". In 1835, Fairholt was shocked at unhealthy poor children. Foreign visitors also visited the mill during their trips.\nWilliam Hutton was once the employees and he later recalled the long hours, low wages and beatings. Work only stopped in time of extreme dryness or frost, or lack of silk supply. But in August 1748, unofficial holidays were taken during elections and Derby races.\nThe partnership of Wilson and Lloyd ended in 1753 due to quarrel and legal suits. Lloyd remained in possession of the building and machinery. \nIn 1765 Thomas Bennet bought the mill from Lloyd subject to a mortgage to the Wilson family but the mill was neglected for years, because other mills in Derby and Cheshire had grown to become competitor, and silk trade itself had declined.\nLamech Swift became the sub-tenant in 1780. He paid \u00a37 to the Corporation and \u00a3170 to Thomas Wilson (brother of Richard and William) per year respectively. He conflicted with the Corporation on repairs to dams in 1781, he remained in occupation until the lease expired in 1803.\nThe Corporation advertised the lease in 1803 to run for 60 years. The advertisement said that the \"Italian works\" was still used for throwing silk.\nIn November 1833, labor movements began in Derby which led to the formation of the Grand National Trades Union in February 1834. Several months later, Tolpuddle Martyrs occurred. The Silk Mill was not at the centre of the movements, Taylor (the mill's lessee at this time) was one of the employers who agreed not to employ any worker who was a union member. By the middle of April 1834 Taylor reported that two-thirds of his machinery was working and many of his former workers were applying for reinstatement. According to \"The Derby Mercury\" some of the former unionists were never able to find next employment in Derby. This event is commemorated by a march organized by the Derby Trades Union Council every year on the weekend before MayDay.\nThe Taylor family remained in occupation of the mill but in 1865 they ruined and were forced to sell their machinery and lease. \"The Derby Mercury\" advertised many silk mills for sale that year, and it were obvious that a general depression was hitting the industry. This took place four years before the Cobden Treaty with France which is said to have effectively destroyed the British silk industry.\nThe long connection with silk production ended in about 1908 when F.W. Hampshire and Company, the Chemists, moved into the buildings to make fly papers and cough medicines. On 5 December 1910 at 5.00 am, fire broke out in the near flour mill of Sowter Bothers and soon the flame spread to the Silk Mill. The mill's east wall fell into the river and the whole building was burnt up. Great efforts were made by the Borough Fire Brigade and the Midland Railway Company who saved the shell of the tower and the outline of the doorways leading into the original five floors. These can still be seen today on the tower staircase. The building was rebuilt at the same height but with three stories instead of five and remains that way today.\nDuring the 1920s the building passed ownership to the Electricity Authority. They used it partly as stores, workshops and a canteen. Hidden from the road by the power station, the mill's existence was largely forgotten by the general public until the power station was removed in 1970. It was then converted into Industrial Museum which Derby had proposed for a long time. The museum opened on 29 November 1974.\nClosure and mothballing in 2011.\nDerby City Council closed the museum on 3 April 2011 in order to free funds for the redevelopment of the Silk Mill museum and other museums in the city. The Report of the Strategic Director of Neighbourhoods (Item 7 put before the Council Cabinet meeting held on the 26 October 2010) indicated that 8.6 full time jobs would be lost but on the contrary \u00a3197,000 would be saved to offset the loss of \"Renaissance Programme\" funding. No date for the re-opening of the museum is given in the report, although a period of two years has been reported.\nSources.\nSources of information: "}

It is a medieval tower house from the 15th century. It was restored in 1989. It is located beside the Visitor Centre which has information on the 5,500 years of park and area history.\nMagazine Fort.\nThe Magazine Fort in the south east of the Park is the location where Phoenix Lodge was built by Sir Edward Fisher in 1611. In 1734 the house was knocked down when the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Lionel Sackville, 1st Duke of Dorset wanted a powder magazine (\"a building to store gunpowder\") for Dublin. An extra wing was added to the fort in 1801 for troops. The Christmas Raid of 1939 happened here.\nDublin Zoo.\nDublin Zoo has more than 600 animals and tropical birds from around the world. It was founded in 1830 and opened to the public on 1 September 1831, which means it is the third oldest zoo in the world. It received animals from the Zoological Society of London. Within a year the zoo housed 123 different kinds of animals.\nMonuments.\nThe Wellington Monument is a tall obelisk. It remembers the victories of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. It is the largest obelisk in Europe and would have been even higher if the public funding had not run out.\nThe \"phoenix monument\" is a Corinthian column with a Phoenix bird rising from the ashes at the top. Lord Chesterfield had it made in 1747.\nThe \"Papal Cross\" is a large cross that was placed in the park for the visit of Pope John Paul II on 29 September 1979. Over one million people attended an open-air mass in the park at the time. The large white cross is high and is made of steel.\nNature.\nThere are 351 plant species in the Park; three of these are rare and protected. The park has kept almost all of its old grasslands and woodlands. It also has rare examples of wetlands. The current 400\u2013450 fallow deer descend from the original herd.\nA Birdwatch survey in 2007-8 found 72 species of bird including buzzard, sparrowhawk, kestrel and jay.\nThe park also has several streams that flow into the River Liffey.\nPeople's Gardens.\nThese gardens were created in 1840 as the \"Promenade Grounds\" (\"grounds for talking a walk in\"). It has small lakes, a children's playground and a picnic area. The gardens are located close to the Parkgate Street entrance.\nFurry Glen.\nThe south western corner of the park is known as the Furry Glen. It has a number of short walks around a small lake with birds, plants and wildlife.\nEvents.\nThe park has sports grounds for football, hurling, soccer, cricket and polo.\nPhoenix Cricket Club.\nPhoenix Cricket Club is located in the park. It was founded in 1830 by John Parnell, the father of Charles Stewart Parnell. It is the oldest cricket club in Ireland. During the 1930s, 1940s and 1970s, it was the most important club in Leinster cricket.\nMotor racing events.\nMotor racing first took place in the Phoenix Park in 1903. The Irish Gordon Bennett Race Speed Trials were held on the main straight road for both cars and motorcycles. This was followed in 1929 by the Irish International Grand Prix; the first of three Irish motor racing grands prix.\nRacing took place between 1932 until the beginning of World War II in 1939. It was started again after the War in 1949 with a sprint on the \"Oldtown\" circuit. Over the years seven different circuits have been used, two of which are named after the famous Ferrari World Champion racing driver Mike Hawthorn.\nGreat Ireland Run.\nThe Great Ireland Run is a 10\u00a0km running competition. It has been held every year in April since 2003. It includes races for professional runners and the public. In 2010 over 11,000 people joined in.\nBloom.\nA large gardening, food and family event called \"Bloom\" is organised in the park every year since 2006. It had nearly 90,000 visitors in 2011.\nConcerts.\nMusical acts like U2, Coldplay, Duran Duran, Robbie Williams, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Kanye West have played concerts in the park.\nPopular culture.\nThe park plays a big role in James Joyce's novel, \"Finnegans Wake\"."}

To a remarkable degree, \"Thylacosmilus\" paralleled the evolution of felid sabre-toothed cats like \"Smilodon\". Its canine teeth were long and powerfully developed; they were used for stabbing prey. Its killing method was to hold its prey, and make deep bites into the soft tissue driven by powerful neck muscles. The canine teeth were protected by a well-developed flange, or projecting edge, in the chin region of the lower jaw. The canines continued to grow during adult life, which they do not in marsupials or placental mammals.\n\"Thylacosmilus\" died out during the late Pliocene, whereas saber-toothed cats did not get to South America until the middle Pleistocene epoch. As a result, the last appearance of \"Thylacosmilus\" is separated from the first appearance of \"Smilodon\" by over one and a half million years."}
{"id": "297396", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=297396", "title": "Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na", "text": " (), more commonly referred to as the Garda\u00ed (Guards), is the police force of the Republic of Ireland. The service is headed by the Commissioner who is appointed by the Irish Government. Its headquarters are located in Phoenix Park in Dublin.\nTerminology.\nThe old English language name of the force was the Civic Guard, but this title is no longer used. \"Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na na h\u00c9ireann\" is usually rendered as the \"Guardian of the Peace of Ireland\" or the \"Guardians of the Peace (of Ireland)\".\nThe full official title of the force is rarely used in speech. It is known, in decreasing order of formality, as ( pronounced ); \"the\" '; the ' (in the preceding names, ' \"guard\" is a collective noun, like \"police\"); the ( ; \"guards\", plural); or the Guards.\nAn individual officer is also called a ' (plural '), or, informally, a guard. A police station is called a \" station\". ' is also the lowest rank within the force, also used as a title (e.g. \" John Murphy\"), analogous to the British term \"constable\" or the American \"officer\" (\"deputy/trooper/etc.\"). \"Guard\" is the most common form of address used by members of the public speaking to a garda on duty. A female officer was once officially referred to as a ' (; \"female guard\"; plural '). This term was abolished in 1990, but is still used colloquially in place of the now gender-neutral '.\nOrganisation.\nThe force is headed by the Commissioner. Immediately below him are two Deputy Commissioners, one in charge of \"Operations\" and the other \"Strategy and Change Management\". The Chief Administrative Officer has responsibility for resource management (personnel, finance, ICT and accommodation) has the same rank as a Deputy Commissioner. There are twelve Assistant Commissioners: one for each of the six geographical Regions, and the remainder dealing with various national support functions. At an equivalent or near-equivalent level to the Assistant Commissioners are the positions of Chief Medical Officer, Executive Director of ICT and Executive Director of Finance.\nThe six geographical \"Assistant Commissioners\" command the six \"Garda Force Regions\", which are currently:\nReporting to the Assistant Commissioners are about 50 Chief Superintendents, about half of whom supervise what are called Divisions. Each Division contains a number of Districts, each commanded by a Superintendent assisted by a team of Inspectors. Each District contains a number of Subdistricts, which are usually commanded by Sergeants.\nUsually each Subdistrict contains only one Garda station. A different number of are based at each station depending on its importance. Most of these stations employ the basic rank of Garda, which was referred to as the rank of Guard until 1972. The most junior members of the force are students, whose duties can vary depending on their training progress. They are often have clerical duties, as part of their extra curricular studies.\nThe Garda organisation also has over 2,500 civilian support staff covering areas such as human resources, occupational health services, finance and procurement, internal audit, IT and telecommunications, accommodation and fleet management, scenes-of-crime support, research and analysis, training and general administration. The figure also includes industrial staff such as traffic wardens, drivers and cleaners. It is ongoing government policy to bring the level of non officer support in the organisation up to international standards - thus enhancing its capacity and expertise in a range of specialist and administrative functions, and releasing more of its police officers for core operational duties.\nReserve Garda\u00ed.\nThe Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na Act 2005 provided for the establishment of a Garda Reserve, consisting of 4,000, to assist the force in performing its functions, and supplement the work of members of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na.\nThe job of the Garda Reserve is \"to be a source of local strength and knowledge\". Reservists carry out duties decided by the Garda Commissioner and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. With reduced training, these duties and powers must be operated under the supervision of regular members of the Force, and are also limited from those of regular members.\nAs of November 2010 there are 850 graduated Garda Reserve, and another 148 in further training, the first batch of 36 Garda Reserves graduated on 15 December 2006 at the Garda College, in Templemore.\nUnarmed Garda\u00ed.\nMost uniformed members of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na do not usually carry firearms. It is a tradition of the service that standard policing is carried out in both rural and urban areas by uniformed officers equipped only with a wooden truncheon. From March 2007 all new Garda\u00ed have been issued with ASP extendable batons, with existing members trained in time. In addition, the Garda Commissioner announced in October 2008 that all Garda\u00ed are to be issued with Pepper Spray. As of December 2009, all Garda\u00ed have been trained and issued with this Spray.\nThe force, when originally created, was armed, but the Provisional Government reversed the decision and reconstituted the force as an unarmed police force. This was in contrast to the attitude of the British Dublin Castle administration, which refused appeals from the Royal Irish Constabulary that that force be disarmed. In the words of first Commissioner, Michael Staines, TD:\nAccording to Tom Garvin such a decision gave the new force a cultural ace: \"the taboo on killing unarmed men and women who could not reasonably be seen as spies and informers.\"\nArmed Garda\u00ed.\nAlthough a mostly unarmed force, certain units of the Garda\u00ed, such as detective units, the regional support units, and the Emergency Response Unit are commissioned to carry firearms. The original stock of Smith &amp; Wesson Model 10 revolvers are being replaced by the Sig Sauer P226 and Walther P99C semi-automatic pistols. Regional Support Units have Heckler &amp; Koch MP7 sub-machine guns in addition to issue pistols and non-lethal weapons such as tasers and pepper spray. They serve as a first response to back up regular Garda officers in critical situations due to a rise of incidents that involve firearm use. In order to be issued with a firearm, or to carry a firearm whilst on duty, a Garda must be in possession of a valid gun card.\nVehicles.\nGarda patrol cars are mainly white, with yellow and blue fluorescent livery whereas traffic unit vehicles adopt the battenburg pattern. The Garda crest is also present on vehicles. An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na also use unmarked patrol cars in their duties and use of such vehicles is increasing becoming a matter of cost rather than the need to hide the vehicles, as the amendments to the exterior of the vehicle such as LED strobes, Tetra aerials and bumper LEDs in particular are extremely visible.\nHistory.\nThe Civic Guard was formed by the Provisional Government in February 1922 to take over the responsibility of policing the fledgling Irish Free State. It replaced the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) and the Irish Republican Police of 1919-1922. In August 1922 the force accompanied Michael Collins when he met the Lord Lieutenant in Dublin Castle.\nThe Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na (Temporary Provisions) Act 1923 enacted after the creation of the Irish Free State on 8 August 1923, provided for the creation of \"a force of police to be called and known as 'The Garda S\u00edochana'\". Under section 22, The Civic Guard were deemed to have been established under and to be governed by the Act. The law therefore renamed the existing force.\nDuring the Civil War of 1922-23, the new Free State set up the Criminal Investigation Department as an armed, plain-clothed counter-insurgency unit. It was disbanded after the end of the war in October 1923 and elements of it were absorbed into the Dublin Metropolitan Police.\nIn Dublin, policing remained the responsibility of the Dublin Metropolitan Police (DMP, founded 1836) until it merged with the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na in 1925. Since then the Garda has been the only police force in the state now known as the Republic of Ireland, with the exception of the Military Police within the Irish Defence Forces, the Airport Police, and Dublin Port and D\u00fan Laoghaire Harbour police forces.\nScott Medal.\nFirst established in 1925, the Scott Medal for Bravery is the highest honour for bravery and valour awarded to a member of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na. The first medals were funded by Colonel Walter Scott, an honorary Commissioner of the New York Police Department. The first recipient of the Scott Medal was Pat Malone of St. Luke's Cork City who - as an unarmed Garda - disarmed Tom\u00e1s \u00d3g Mac Curtain (the son of Tom\u00e1s Mac Curtain).\nTo mark the United States link, the American English spelling of \"valor\" is used on the medal. The Garda Commissioner chooses the recipients of the medal, which is presented by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.\nIn 2000, Anne McCabe - widow of Garda Jerry McCabe, who was killed by armed Provisional IRA bank robbers, accepted the Scott Medal for Bravery that had been awarded posthumously to her husband.\nThe Irish Republican Police had at least one member killed by the RIC 21 July 1920.\nGarda Commissioners.\nThe first Commissioner, Michael Staines, who was a Pro-Treaty member of , held office for only eight months. It was his successors, Eoin O'Duffy and \u00c9amon Broy, who played a central role in the development of the force. O\u2019Duffy was Commissioner in the early years of the force when to many people\u2019s surprise the ability of the force to succeed despite being unarmed was established. O'Duffy later became a short-lived political leader of the quasi-fascist Blueshirts before heading to Spain to fight alongside Francisco Franco's Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War. Broy had greatly helped the Irish Republican Army (IRA) during the Anglo-Irish War, while serving with the Dublin Metropolitan Police (DMP). Broy's fame grew in the 1990s when he featured in the movie \"Michael Collins\", in which it was misleadingly suggested that he had been murdered by the British during the War of Independence, when in reality he lived for decades and headed the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na from 1933 to 1938. Broy was followed by Commissioners Michael Kinnane (1938\u201352) and Daniel Costigan (1952\u201365). The first Commissioner to rise from the rank of ordinary Garda was William P. Quinn, who was appointed in February 1965.\nOne later Commissioner, Edmund Garvey, was sacked by the Fianna F\u00e1il government of Jack Lynch in 1978 after it had lost confidence in him. Garvey won 'unfair dismissal' legal proceedings against the government, which was upheld in the Irish Supreme Court This outcome required the passing of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na Act 1979 to retrospectively validate the actions of Garvey's successor since he had become Commissioner. Garvey's successor, Patrick McLaughlin, was forced to resign along with his deputy in 1983 over his minor involvement in a political scandal. The current Commissioner, since December 2010, is Martin Callinan.\nPast reserve forces.\nDuring the Emergency (as World War II was known in Ireland) there were two reserve forces to the Garda, An Taca S\u00edoch\u00e1na and the Local Security Force.\nAn Taca S\u00edoch\u00e1na had the power of arrest and wore uniform, and were allowed to leave the reserve or sign-up as full members of the Garda at the end of the war before the reserve was disbanded. The reserve was established by the Emergency Powers (Temporary Special Police Force) Order, 1939.\nThe Local Security Force (LSF) did not have the power of arrest, and part of the reserve was soon absorbed into the Irish Army Reserve under the command of the Irish Army.\nPolicing abroad.\nSince 1989, the Garda has been part of United Nations peace-keeping forces. Its first mission was when a 50 strong force was sent to Namibia. Since then the force has acted in Angola, Cambodia, Cyprus, Mozambique, South Africa and the former Yugoslavia. The force's first fatality abroad was Garda Sergeant Paul M. Reid, who was fatally injured while on duty with the United Nations UNPROFOR at \"Sniper's Alley\" in Sarajevo on 18 May 1995.\nMembers of the Garda also serve in the Embassies of Ireland in London, The Hague, Madrid and Paris. Members are also seconded to Europol in The Hague, Holland and Interpol in Lyon, France. There are also many members working directly for UN and European agencies such as the War Crimes Tribunal.\nGarda officers also co-operate with members of the Police Service of Northern Ireland to combat cross-border crime. They have also accompanied politicians from the Republic, such as the President on visits to Northern Ireland.\nUnder an agreement with the British Government and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the Garda and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland are allowed to inspect the Sellafield nuclear facility in Cumbria, England.\nControversy and allegations involving the force.\nLike every police force in the world the Garda\u00ed have had many complaints against them including allegations of discourtesy, harassment and perjury (lying to a court). A total of 1,173 complaints were made by the public against the Garda\u00ed in 2005, while over 2000 complaints were made in 2009.\nSome incidents involving the Garda have attracted wide scale attention\u2014such as those that led to the Morris and Barr Tribunals\u2014and have resulted in broad reform initiatives. Other reports suggest that people who frequent gay and lesbian establishments feel that the Garda\u00ed are not doing enough to tackle reported homophobic crime in Ireland. In 2007 there was also some debate when a potential Sikh applicant of the Garda Reserve requested that he be allowed wear a turban in place of a standard uniform cap - Ultimately the provision was not made as it was stated that the force had the same uniform requirements for all members.\nMishandling of cases and complaints.\nThe Kerry Babies case was one of the first public inquiries into mishandling of a Garda investigation. Later, in the 1980s, the Ferns Report (an inquiry into allegations of clerical sexual abuse) described as \"wholly inadequate\" the handling of one of eight formal complaints made to Wexford garda\u00ed, but noted that the remaining formal complaints were handled in an \"effective, professional and sensitive\" manner.\nThe Garda\u00ed were also criticised in the Murphy Report in relation to the handing over of the case of Fr. Edmondus (a pseudonym) to Archbishop McQuaid by Commissioner Costigan. Some very senior Garda\u00ed were criticised for regarding priests as being outside their remit in 1960. On November 26, 2009, then Commissioner Fachtna Murphy apologised for the failure of An Garda Sioch\u00e1na to protect victims of child abuse in the Dublin Archdiocese. He said that inappropriate relationships and contacts between garda\u00ed and the Dublin Archdiocese had taken place at a time of undue or misguided deference to religious authorities and that these were incompatible with any investigation. On 27 November 2009 he announced that a senior investigator would examine the findings in the report.\nThe Garda\u00ed were criticised by the commission of investigation into the Dean Lyons case for their handling of the investigation into the Grangegorman killings. In his report, George Birmingham said that the Garda\u00ed had used leading questions in their interviews with Lyons, and had failed to act on a suspicion that Lyons' confession was unreliable. For a period, the garda\u00ed involved in the case failed to act on the knowledge that another man, Mark Nash, had confessed to the crime. They were also criticised for failing to keep adequate records of their interviews with Lyons.\nAllegations resulting in Tribunals of Inquiry.\nIn the 1990s and early 2000s there were a series of allegations, including suggestions of corrupt and dishonest policing in County Donegal. This became the subject of a judicial inquiry: the Morris Tribunal. The tribunal found that some garda\u00ed based in County Donegal had invented a Provisional IRA informer, made bombs and claimed credit for locating them, and attempted to frame Raphoe publican Frank McBrearty Junior for murder\u2013 the latter case involving a \u20ac1.5m settlement with the State. In a report to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the Morris Tribunal expressed grave concern about \"organised insubordination\" within the force that \"proper discipline has been lost from Garda\", suggesting that a few mischief-makers abused their positions within the Garda and used the disciplinary process to damage the force. The tribunal also expressed concern that recruits were brought into an undisciplined culture that had the potential to do great damage in the longer term, and warned that a \"terrible and costly\" waste of talent would occur if the situation continued. These scandals damaged the reputation and standing of the force in County Donegal.\nOn 20 April 2000, members of the Emergency Response Unit shot dead, from behind, 27-year-old John Carthy at the end of a 25-hour siege as he left his home in Abbeylara, County Longford with a loaded shotgun in his hands. There were allegations made of inappropriate handling of the situation and of the overuse of armed force by the Garda\u00ed. This led to a Garda inquiry, and later a Tribunal of Inquiry chaired by Mr Justice Robert Barr. This inquiry was established on 1 July 2002, and the hearing of evidence was completed on 7 December 2004. The final report was expected within six months, but publication of the report was delayed until 20 July 2006. The official findings of the tribunal were that Sgt Michael Jackson made 14 mistakes in his role as negotiator during the siege, and that he failed to make real efforts to achieve resolution during the armed stand-off. It further stated however that Sgt Jackson was limited by lack of experience and resources (\"psychologists, solicitors, dogs\"). The tribunal recommended that there be an urgent review of Garda command structures, and that the ERU be with stun guns and other non-lethal options, including \"non-compliant firearms support police dogs\".\nThe Barr tribunal also recommended a formal working arrangement between Garda\u00ed and State psychologists, and improvements in Garda training (especially for the ERU in siege situations, including those with mental illness as a factor). This included a recommendation that local Garda superintendents undergo refresher training for one week every year as scene commanders and a similar refresher course for ERU officers of the rank of inspector or superintendent. Garda Commissioner Conroy, in a letter to the family of John Carthy, stated that the force was 'truly apologetic' for his death. Former Superintendent Joe Shelley, whose failure to interview John Carthy was cited in the Barr Tribunal Report as \"extraordinary\", and who was also severely criticised in the Report of the Morris Tribunal into the controversial death of Richie Barron, was awarded a top-up bonus of \u20ac110,000 when he took early retirement in July 2005. Mr Justice Morris described Shelley's probe as \"prejudiced, tendentious, utterly negligent in the highest degree\".\nAllegations involving abuse of powers.\nOne of the first charges of serious misconduct against the force came from the handling of the Sallins Train Robbery in 1976. This case eventually led to a serious miscarriage of justice and accusations that a \"Heavy Gang\" within the force intimidated and tortured accused. This eventually led to a Presidential pardon for one of the accused.\nIn 2004, an RT\u00c9 \"Prime Time\" documentary accused elements within the Garda of abusing their powers by physically assaulting people arrested. A retired Circuit Court judge (W. A. Murphy) suggested that some members of the force had committed perjury in criminal trials before him but later stated that he was misquoted, while a Minister of State (Dick Roche, a junior government minister) accused Garda\u00ed in one instance of \"torture\". The Garda Commissioner accused the television programme of lacking balance.\nThe Prime Time documentary followed footage published by the Independent Media Centre Ireland showing scuffles between Garda\u00ed and Reclaim the Streets demonstrators. One Garda in this footage was later convicted of common assault, which is a summary matter, while several other Garda\u00ed were acquitted.\nAllegations about cross-border policing.\nThe family of Eddie Fullerton, a Buncrana Sinn F\u00e9in councillor killed in his home by members of the Ulster Defence Association in 1991, have criticised the Garda\u00ed's handling of the investigation and in 2005 they started a campaign for an inquiry.\nThe Smithwick Tribunal is also investigating allegations of collusion following the deaths of two Royal Ulster Constabulary officers killed by the Provisional IRA as they returned from a meeting with the Garda\u00ed in the Republic of Ireland following a recommendation from the Cory Collusion Inquiry.\nOperations around the Corrib Gas Project.\nProtests at the proposed Royal Dutch Shell Corrib gas refinery in Kilcommon parish, Erris, County Mayo have seen a large Garda operation at its construction sites with up to 200 Garda\u00ed involved, making it the single biggest policing operation in the country at times. By September 2008, the cost of the operation was \u20ac10 Million and is estimated to have cost \u20ac13.5 Million by the end of January 2009. This is comparable to the \u20ac20 Million budgeted for Operation Anvil, targeting organised crime, criminal gangs and their associates. A section of road used by the protesters has been dubbed \"the Golden Mile\" by Garda\u00ed because of the overtime opportunities. Complaints have been made about the Garda handling of the protests and several TDs, including former Green Party leader Trevor Sargent have criticised the Garda's handling of the situation.\nReform initiatives.\nPartly as a result of some of the above incidents, the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na has undergone a number of reforms in recent years. The Morris Tribunal in particular recommended major changes to the way the force's management, discipline, promotion and accountability arrangements. Many of these recommendations were enacted by the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na Act 2005.\nMr Justice Morris also said that the code of discipline was extremely complex and, at times, \"cynically manipulated\" to promote indiscipline across the force. Judicial reviews, for example, were cited as a means for delaying disciplinary action.\nThe fall-out form the Morris Tribunal was considerable. While fifteen members of the force were sacked between 2001 and 2006, and a further 42 resigned instead of being dismissed, Commissioner Conroy said that he was limited in what he could do to deal with members whose misbehaviour is cited in public inquiries.\nNew procedures and code of discipline.\nWith strong support from opposition parties, and reflecting widespread political consensus, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform responded to many of these issues by announcing a new draft code of discipline on 17 August 2006. The new streamlined code introduced new procedures to enable the Commissioner to summarily dismiss a Garda alleged to have brought the force into disrepute, abandoned duties, compromised the security of the State or unjustifiably infringed the rights of other persons.\nIn addition, a four-member \"non officer management advisory team\" was appointed in August 2006 to advise on implementing change options and addressing management and leadership challenges facing the Garda\u00ed. The advisers were also mandated to promote the ideas of performance management, succession planning, recruitment of non officers with specialist expertise, and improved training. The advisory team included Senator Maurice Hayes, Emer Daly (former director of strategic planning and risk management at Axa Insurance), Maurice Keane (former group chief executive at Bank of Ireland), Michael Flahive (Assistant Secretary at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform) and Dr Michael Mulreany (assistant director general at the Institute of Public Administration).\nEnhanced non officer support.\nClerical and administrative support has been greatly increased in recent times. In the two-year period from December 2006 to December 2008 whole-time equivalent civilian staffing levels were increased by over 60%, from under 1,300 to approximately 2,100, in furtherance of official policies to release more desk-bound Garda\u00ed for operational duties and to bring the level of general support in line with international norms. A new tier of middle and senior non officer management has also been introduced in a range of administrative and technical/professional support areas. A Chief Administrative Officer at Deputy Commissioner level was appointed in October 2007 to oversee many of these key support functions.\nGarda Inspectorate.\nIn accordance with Section 115 of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na Act, the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na Inspectorate consists of three members who are appointed by the Irish Government. The job of the Inspectorate, is to:\nThe first Chief Inspector (since July 2006), is former Commissioner of Boston Police, Kathleen O'Toole. She reports directly to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.\nFrom 2006 to 2009, O'Toole was supported by two other inspectors, Robert Olsen and Gwen M. Boniface. Olsen was Chief of Police for 8 years of the Minneapolis Police Department. Boniface is a former Commissioner of the Ontario Provincial Police, and was one of 3 female police commissioners in Canada when appointed in May 1998. She suggested that rank and file Garda\u00ed were not equipped to perform their duties or protect themselves properly. She also suggested that routine arming may become a reality but dismissed the suggestion that this was currently being considered.\nGarda S\u00edoch\u00e1na Ombudsman Commission.\nOver 2000 complaints were made against the organization in 2009. The Garda Commissioner referred over 100 incidents where the conduct of a garda resulted in death or serious injury to the Ombudsman for investigation. Also newly instrumented, the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na Ombudsman Commission (usually called the Garda Ombudsman or GSOC) replaces the earlier system of complaints (the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na Complaints Board).\nWhen it became fully operational on 9 May 2007, the Commission was allowed to:\nThe Members of the Garda Ombudsman Commission are: Dermot Gallagher (Chairman; former Secretary General at the Department of Foreign Affairs), Carmel Foley (former Director of Consumer Affairs), and Conor Brady (former Editor of The Irish Times and author of a book on the history of the Garda\u00ed). The Commission's first Chairman was Kevin Haugh (a High Court Judge) who died in early 2009, shortly before his term of office was to conclude.\nPublic Attitudes to An Garda Siochana.\nThe Garda Public Attitudes Survey 2008 found that 81% of respondents were satisfied with the Garda\u00ed, although 72% believed the service needed improvement. 91% agreed that their local Garda\u00ed were approachable.\nThe survey also found that 8% of people believed a Garda has acted unacceptably towards them; this rate was highest in Dublin South Central at 14%, lowest in Mayo at 2%. The most common complaint was of Garda\u00ed being disrespectful or impolite.\nGarda Band.\nThe Garda Band is a public relations branch of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, and was formed shortly after the foundation of the force.

Delaney and he formed a c\u00e9il\u00ed and pipe band within the Garda Band. In 1938, the Dublin Metropolitan Garda Band (based at Kevin Street) and the Garda Band joined and were based at the Garda Headquarters in Phoenix Park.\nThe band was disbanded in 1965. However to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the foundation of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na it was reformed in 1972.\nBesides providing music for official Garda functions (such as Graduation Ceremonies at the Garda College) the band has a community orientated programme each year performing at schools, festivals and sporting events.

He may have been the most important cue stick maker. He is sometimes called \"the Stradivarius of cuemakers\". His full name or last name alone is often used to refer to a cue stick made by him. He arrived in the U.S. in 1942. He worked at different carpentry and toy and furniture making jobs. He loved playing pool and bought a pool room with a business partner in 1959. Then he started making cues as gifts for friends. This soon became a business when others wanted to buy them. \nBalabushka made about 1,200 handcrafted cues during his 16 year career from 1959 to his death in 1975. His cues are highly valued collectors items. They appeared in Martin Scorsese's 1986 film, \"The Color of Money\". Original Balabushka cues may sell for tens of thousands of dollars at auction. \nLife and career.\nEarly life.\nGeorge Balabushka was born in Russia on December 9, 1912 and immigrated to the United States in 1924 at 12 years of age. His family, parents Anton and Natalie and younger sister Mary, settled in New York City. Although originally named Gregori, according to Balabushka he was given a new first name, George, by emigration officials when he was processed through Ellis Island.\nEmployment.\nBalabushka's first job was as a wooden toy designer and maker at the Educational Equipment Company. in Manhattan, The company made building blocks for nurseries and schools. Later, he built children's furniture for the Playtime Woodworking Company in Greenwich Village. While working, Balabushka lost his middle finger to a band saw. Using a wooden mold, he made himself a replacement plastic finger. It was very realistic so that even his friends did not realize his loss until long after the incident. As Balabushka's carpentry skills improved he began building accordions and other detailed carpentry pieces on his own time. \nBalabushka worked hard on playing ability and fine craftsmanship in his cues. He created new methods of cue construction, cue finishes and cue design. Most Balabushka cues look simple. Many of his construction techniques have become standard in the industry.\nGeorge Balabushka died in 1975 at the age of 62. He was named the first member the American Cuemakers Association Hall of Fame in February, 1993. In 2004, he entered the Meritorious Service category of the Billiard Congress of America's Hall of Fame."}

It flows through the centre of Dublin. The river supplies much of Dublin's water. Major rivers that flow into the Liffey are the River Dodder, the River Poddle and the River Camac.\nHistory of the name.\nThe river was called \"An Ruirthech\", meaning \"fast (or strong) runner\" before it was called Liffey. The word \"Liphe\" (or \"Life\") was the name of the plain (\"flat area of land\") through which the river flowed but was later used to name the river itself. It was also known as the Anna Liffey, possibly because of the Irish for \"River Liffey\" - \"Abhainn na Life\" which sounds like \"Anna Liffey\" in English.\nFlow.\nThe Liffey starts with a lot of small streams in the Liffey Head Bog between Kippure and Tonduff in the Wicklow mountains. It flows for around through counties Wicklow, Kildare and Dublin. It flows into the Irish Sea at the mid-point of Dublin Bay. Most of its length is in Kildare.\nThe Liffey has a lot of tributaries (\"rivers that flow into it\"). Its major tributaries include the King's River, River Dodder, the River Poddle and the River Camac.\nThe Liffey does not have any natural lakes, and has only a few islands. There are a few areas with rapids, mostly as the river comes close to Dublin city.\nThere are dams built for three hydroelectric power stations along the river, at Poulaphouca, Golden Falls and Leixlip. A large reservoir is built at Poulaphouca.\nTowns along the river include Ballymore Eustace, Athgarvan, Kilcullen, Newbridge, Caragh, Clane, Celbridge, Leixlip and Lucan before the river reaches the city of Dublin as it approaches its mouth.\nNavigation and uses.\nThe River Liffey in Dublin city was used for many centuries for trade. The Vikings already used the river, and it was used until recent times. It is connected to the River Shannon via the Grand Canal and the Royal Canal. This connects Dublin to the west of Ireland by water.\nWater supply.\nAround 60% of the Liffey's flow is used for drinking water, and to supply industry. Much of this makes its way back into the river after it is cleaned in wastewater treatment plants. A popular myth is that Liffey water is used to make Guinness beer, but this is not true. Guinness uses water piped from the Wicklow mountains.\nTraffic.\nThe \"Lady Patricia\" and \"Miranda Guinness\" were cargo ships that were used to export Guinness from the St. James's Gate Brewery. They were well-known sight on the Liffey up to the 1990s.\nIn recent years, the only regular traffic on the river within the city is a boat which runs guided tours along the River Liffey through Dublin City centre. Downstream of the East-Link bridge, the river is still mainly used for commercial and ferry traffic.\nRecreational use in Dublin.\nThe river is used by private, university and Garda rowing clubs in Chapelizod. The Liffey Descent canoeing event covers a course from Straffan to Islandbridge. That race has been held every year since 1960. The Liffey Swim takes place every year in late August or early September between Watling Bridge and The Custom House.\nBridges.\nHistory.\nThe earliest stone bridge over the Liffey was the Bridge of Dublin. It was built by the Dominicans in 1428. It survived well into the 18th century. It replaced an earlier wooden bridge (Dubhghalls Bridge) on the same site. Island Bridge was added in 1577.\nWhen Dublin became important for business in the 17th century, 4 new bridges were added between 1670 and 1684. They were Barrack, or Bloody Bridge, (what is now Rory O'More Bridge), Essex Bridge (Grattan Bridge), Ormond Bridge (O'Donovan Rossa Bridge) and Arran Bridge.\nThe oldest bridge still standing is the Mellows Bridge. It was built in 1764 after the Arran Bridge (which was there before) was destroyed by floods in 1763.\nThe first iron bridge was the elegant Ha'penny Bridge built in 1816. The newest bridge is the Samuel Beckett Bridge opened in December 2009. It is a suspension bridge, it can move to allow river traffic to pass.\nPresent day.\nThe river divides the Northside from the Southside of Dublin. It has a lot of bridges, mostly open for vehicular traffic (\"cars, trucks, buses etc.\"). Large bridges are the West-Link Bridge on the M50 motorway, the Se\u00e1n Heuston Bridge and O'Connell Bridge.\nThere are 3 foot bridges in the city: the Millennium Bridge, the Se\u00e1n O'Casey Bridge and the Ha'penny Bridge.\nBridges outside of Dublin include the Liffey Bridge at Celbridge, \"The Bridge at 16\" (a 19th century pedestrian suspension bridge), and the Leinster Aqueduct - which takes the Grand Canal over the Liffey at Caragh.\nPopular culture references.\nFrom Joyce to Radiohead, the Liffey is often mentioned in literature and song:"}

From 1641 to 1647, he was the leader in the fight against the Irish Catholic Confederation. From 1649 to 1650 he was top commander of the Royalist forces fighting against Oliver Cromwell who wanted to invade Ireland. In the 1650s he lived in exile in Europe with Charles II of England. When Charles II was put back on the British throne during the restoration in 1660, Ormonde became very important in English and Irish politics.\nEarly life.\nThe Butlers of Ormonde were an Old English dynasty. They had been very important people the southeast of Ireland since the Middle Ages. His father was Thomas Butler, Viscount Thurles. Thurles is a place in County Tipperary. James was the oldest son. \nHis father died in 1619, when he was 9 years old. He became \"Viscount Thurles\". His mother took him to England where his grandfather (Walter Butler, 11th Earl of Ormond) made him go to a Catholic school. James I was King at the time. James I was a Protestant, and wanted to make sure that James would also be a Protestant. This would give him power in Ireland once James Butler went back to Thurles. James I placed James Butler under the care of archbishop George Abbot. When he was fifteen he went to live with his grandfather at Drury-lane.\" \nIt became very important in his life that he was a Protestant. Almost all his relatives were Catholics. This made his family not like him very much. They had land and possessions taken from them, and they were not treated fairly because they were Catholics. This did not happen to James.\nIn December 1629, he married Lady Elizabeth Preston. In 1634, on the death of his grandfather, he became Earl of Ormonde.\nRebellion and Civil War.\nIn 1633 Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford became head of government in Ireland. He liked Ormonde. He wrote to Charles I saying that Ormonde was \"young, but take it from me, a very staid head\". Ormonde became Wentworth's friend and supporter. \nWentworth planned to take land from the Catholics in Ireland. He did this to get money for the British king. He also wanted to break the political power of the Irish Catholic gentry. Ormonde supported this plan. \nThe plans made his relatives very angry, and many of them opposed Wentworth. This led to armed rebellion. The opposition to Wentworth helped an impeachment of the Earl by the English Parliament. He was executed in May, 1641. \nWhen the Irish Rebellion of 1641 started, Ormonde was in command of government troops based in Dublin. Most of the country was taken by the Catholic rebels, who included Ormonde's Butler relatives. Rebel leader Richard Butler, 3rd Viscount Mountgarret, was Ormonde's cousin. In spring 1642 Mountgarret and Ormonde were the commanders of the two sides at the battle of Kilrush, with Ormonde's side winning.\nIn spring 1642 the Irish Catholics formed their own government, the Catholic Confederation. The capital was Kilkenny. They started to organise their own troops. Also in early 1642 the king sent in troops from England and Scotland to help with the fight. The Irish Confederate War had started. \nOrmonde cleared the area around Dublin of Confederate forces. He got control of the area historically known as the Pale. In March 1643 Ormonde brought his troops to New Ross. This was deep in the territory of the Catholic Confederation. He won a small victory there (Battle of New Ross) before returning to Dublin. \nHowever, Ormonde was in a very difficult situation. The Confederates held two thirds of the island. The English Civil War had started in September 1642. This meant that there were not going to be more troops from England to help him. The King had even asked to send back the troops he had sent before.\nIsolated in Dublin, Ormonde agreed to a ceasefire (\"to stop fighting\") with the Catholics, which began in September 1643. The greater part of Ireland was given up into the hands of the Catholic Confederation. This left only districts in the north, the Dublin Pale, round Cork City, and certain smallish garrisons in the possession of Protestant commanders. This truce was strongly opposed by the Lords Justices and the Protestant community in general in Ireland.\nIn November 1643 the king appointed Ormonde as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. This was the highest post in the Irish government. Ormonde was told to stop the king's Parliamentarian enemies being helped from Ireland. He also had to deliver more troops to fight for the Royalist side in England. He was also given the king's authority to make peace with the Catholic Confederation. They could then allow their troops to fight against the Parliamentarians.\nNegotiations with the Irish Confederates.\nOrmonde had a difficult job to do. \nThe Old native Irish and Catholic Irish of English descent (\"the Old English\") had their own government in Confederate Ireland. They would support King Charles I of England if he would allow them freedom to be Catholics, and give them self-government. On the other side, any deals he made with Catholic Confederates meant that his support among English and Scottish Protestants in Ireland would become less. \nOn August 25, 1645, Edward Somerset, 2nd Marquess of Worcester, acting on behalf of King Charles, signed a treaty (\"peace agreement\") in Kilkenny with the Irish Catholic Confederates. He did not talk about this with the Irish Protestant community. Irish Protestants were strongly against this, and Charles was forced to undo the treaty almost immediately. He was afraid that almost all Irish Protestant would give support to the other side in the English Civil War. \nOn March 28, 1646, Ormonde, on behalf of the king, signed another treaty with the Confederates. This one gave them religious and other rights. However, the Confederates' General Assembly (\"their government\") in Kilkenny did not like the deal. This was in part because of what the pope's ambassador (nuncio) Giovanni Battista Rinuccini said. He did not want the Catholics to compromise. The Confederates arrested those among them who had signed the treaty with Ormonde.\nOrmonde then judged that he could not keep the Confederates out of Dublin. He asked for help from English Long Parliament and signed an agreement with them on June 19, 1647. At the beginning of August Ormonde handed over Dublin, together with 3000 royalist troops under his command, to the Parliamentarian commander Michael Jones. He had arrived from England with 5000 Parliamentarian troops. Ormonde in turn sailed to England. He said about his surrender that he \"preferred English rebels to Irish ones.\" \nThe royalist and parliamentarian troops were fighting on different sides in the English Civil War. But in Ireland, they fought together against the Catholic Confederates. The combined troops won a major battle against the Confederates soon afterward near Dublin (Battle of Dungan's Hill).\nCommander of Royalist Alliance.\nIn March 1648 he joined the queen and the Prince of Wales in Paris. In September he went back to Ireland. He was going to try to get the Irish Confederates and the Irish Protestants to support the king now that the pope's nuncio was gone. \nThe Irish Confederates wanted to make a compromise now. Their battle against the English Parliamentarian forces was not going well. On 17 January 1649 Ormonde signed a peace with the rebels which said that they could practice their religion freely.\nAfter Charles I was executed in 1649, he stated Ireland's support for Charles II. Ormonde was put in command of the Irish Confederates' armies and also the English Royalist troops who had come to Ireland. Almost all of Ireland was under his control before August 1649. Yet Ormonde was not able to stop the conquest of Ireland by Oliver Cromwell in 1649-50. \nMost of the English and Protestant Royalist troops left Ormonde's side and went to fight for Cromwell in May 1650. The Irish Catholic troops were the only ones left under his command. They did not trust him. Ormonde was made to leave his command in late 1650. He returned to France later that year. In Cromwell's Act of Settlement 1652, all of Ormonde's lands in Ireland were taken from him.\nOrmonde was great friends with Charles II and the queen mother in Paris. He went to Aix and Cologne with Charles when he had to leave France. He played an active part in the secret planning of the Restoration (\"the plan to put Charles II back on the throne of England.\").\nOrmonde's career after Charles II became King.\nAfter Charles II became king, Ormonde got a lot of different responsibilities and titles from the king. He was made\nHe also got back his lands in Ireland. On 4 November 1661 he became Lord Lieutenant of Ireland again. He did not like it when Charles II stopped importing cattle from Ireland. In return, he stopped importing cattle from Scotland.\nIn March 1669, Ormonde was removed from the government of Ireland. He did not mind. He made sure that his sons and others that listened to him stayed in their posts. He was chosen as Chancellor of the University of Oxford on 4 August 1669.\nIn 1670 an attempt was made to kill the duke by an adventurer named Thomas Blood. Ormonde was attacked by Blood and his helpers while driving up St James's Street on the night of 6 December 1670. He was pulled out of his carriage, and taken on horseback along Piccadilly. They wanted to hang him at Tyburn. Ormonde managed to escape.\nIn 1677 the king decided that he would become the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland once again. \nOn his arrival in Ireland he set up a tax system, and reorganised the army. After the Popish Plot (1678) in England, Ormonde at once took action that would make Roman Catholics powerless. There were far more Catholics than Protestants in the country (15 Catholics for every 1 Protestant). In 1682 he went back to London at the request of the King, who he supported.

It is based on Shakespeare\u2019s play with the same name. The opera is normally in Italian, though there is also a French version that's almost never used anymore. The libretto (the words) was written by Francesco Maria Piave with some extra additions by Andrea Maffei.\nVerdi wrote several works based on Shakespeare plays. \"Macbeth\" was the first of these. It was composed in 1847, at a time when he was composing a lot of operas. In those days Italian operas were always about a love story, but \"Macbeth\" was unusual because there was no love story. Instead, it is a story about wanting power, even if means murder. The opera helped to make him very famous, and it has remained one of his most popular operas. \nComposition history.\nAndrea Maffei, a poet and friend of Verdi, suggested to him that \"Macbeth\" would be a good story to make into an opera. Verdi did not read Shakespeare\u2019s original work until after he had composed the opera. The words were written for him by Piave who based the libretto on an Italian translation. Verdi loved the story, he thought it was \u201cone of the greatest creations of man\u201d. The opera is very similar to the story told by Shakespeare, but Verdi uses a large chorus of witches instead of just three. The last act ends with the refugees coming together on the English border, and, in the revised version, ends with a chorus of bards celebrating their victory over the cruel tyrant.\nThe 1847 version was performed a great deal all over Italy. Then, in 1865, Verdi made several changes to the opera in a revised version. It was to be performed in Paris, and in France people expected to have ballet music in operas. Verdi wrote some music for the dancers, and took the opportunity to make other changes as well. Verdi worked in Italian, and had it translated into French for the performance there, but people don't use the French translation. They instead use all his changes for the French version, but keep the Italian text.\nAfter 1865 it was not performed very often. Verdi was very disappointed about this because he was particularly proud of this opera. He had worked closely with Piave. It was Verdi who gave Piave the outline of the story he wanted him to write. Verdi concentrated on three main characters: Lady Macbeth, Macbeth and the Witches. It was not until around the time of World War II that it became very popular again.\nThe story of the opera.\nAct 1.\n\"Scene 1: A heath\"\nIn the prelude (the music of the opening) we hear music that comes later in the sleep-walking scene. The chorus of Witches prophesy the future. A messenger arrives to say that Macbeth has been given the title and estates of Cawdor. Macbeth and Banquo, his general, think about the witches\u2019 prophecy. Half of the prophecy has just come true (the other half being that Macbeth will become king, and that the kings that come after him will be Banquo\u2019s heirs). The witches dance and sing at the end of this scene.\n\"Scene 2: Macbeth's castle\"\nLady Macbeth reads a letter from her husband in which he tells her about the prophecy the witches had made. She decides to make sure that Macbeth really does become king. She decides that she must persuade her husband to murder Duncano (Duncan, King of Scotland). Macbeth sees a dagger in front of him. He takes it and murders Duncano (who never sings in the opera). Then he is horrified at what he has done. His wife is disgusted that her husband feels terrible about the murder. She takes the dagger and completes the crime, then smears Duncano\u2019s blood on the guards who are asleep. Banquo and Macduff, a Scottish nobleman, arrive, Macduff discovers the crime, and all the characters sing a chorus asking God to punish the murderer(s). \nAct 2.\n\"Scene 1: A room in the castle\"\nMacbeth is now king. He is worried about the prophecy that Banco\u2019s heirs will become king. He and his wife decide that Banco and his son must be murdered.\n\"Scene 2: Outside the castle\" \nA gang of murderers are waiting for Banco. He is caught, but his son Fleanzio manages to escape. \n\"Scene 3: A dining hall in the castle\"\nMacbeth receives the guests and Lady Macbeth sings a brindisi (drinking song) which is quite similar to the famous one in \"La Traviata\". Macbeth is told that Banco has been murdered, but when he goes back to the table he finds Banco\u2019s ghost sitting in his place. He shouts and raves at the ghost. The other people cannot see the ghost and think that Macbeth has gone mad. The feast ends quickly.\nAct 3.\n\"The witches' cave\"\nThe witches are sitting round a cauldron in a dark cave. They sing, and then dance a ballet which was written for the 1865 version. The music sounds like magic. Macbeth enters and wants the witches to tell him his future. They conjure up three apparitions for him. The first one tells him to beware of Macduff. The second tells him that he cannot be harmed by a man 'born of woman'. The third one says that he cannot be conquered till Birnam Wood marches against him. \nMacbeth is then shown the ghost of Banco and his descendants, eight future Kings of Scotland. This shows that the witches prophecy from the beginning of the opera must indeed come true. Macbeth collapses. When he recovers and tells his wife what he saw, she is even more determined to kill Banco\u2019s son and all his family.\nAct 4.\n\"Scene 1: Near the border between England and Scotland\"\nScottish refugees stand near the English border and sing a song about how Macbeth, the tyrant, is oppressing his people.\nMalcolm, Banco\u2019s son, tells his soldiers to cut branches from trees in Birnam Wood and carry them as they attack Macbeth's army. They want to free Scotland from tyranny.\n\" Scene 2: Macbeth's castle\" \nA doctor and a servant watch the Queen as she walks in her sleep, wringing her hands trying to clean them of blood. \n\"Scene 3: The battlefield\"\nMacbeth has heard that an army is coming towards him. He is told that the Queen is dead, but he does not seem to mind. He gets his army together. Banco\u2019s army march against him with their tree branches. The prophecy has come true: Birnam Wood has marched up against him. Macduff fights Macbeth and kills him. He tells Macbeth that he was not \"born of woman\" but \"ripped\" from his mother's womb. The fight continues. Macduff kills Macbeth. Macduff's men call out that Macduff is the new King. All the soldiers and the women sing a hymn to victory."}

Diffraction occurs with all waves, including sound waves, water waves, and electromagnetic waves such as light that the eye can see. Diffraction also occurs with matter such as electrons.\nCauses of diffraction.\nDiffraction is caused by one wave of light being shifted by a diffracting object. This shift will cause the wave to have interference with itself. Interference can be either constructive or destructive. When interference is constructive, the intensity of the wave will increase. When interference is destructive, the intensity will decrease, sometimes to a point where it is completely destroyed. These patterns of interference rely on the size of the diffracting object and the size of the wave. The strongest examples of diffraction occur in waves where the wavelength is similar to the size of the object causing diffraction.\nUses of diffraction.\nDiffraction can be used to separate different wavelengths of light using a diffraction grating. A diffraction grating can be a series of closely-spaced slits or a mirror with a series of small grooves. Diffraction gratings work because different wavelengths of light will constructively interfere at different angles. Diffraction gratings are used in many analytical chemistry tools, such as a spectrometer.\nDiffraction can also be used to look at molecules using X-ray crystallography. In X-ray crystallography, X-rays are aimed on a crystal. The crystal diffracts the X-ray and makes a diffraction pattern. This pattern is unique to the type of crystal and can be used to identify the molecule that makes the crystal. Diffraction also occurs in a bending movement where the wave becomes more spread out\nReferences.\nSkoog, D.A.; Holler, F.J.; Crouch, S.R. Principles of Instrumental Analysis.

The monastery was home to the first Norse base (\"longphort\") in Ireland.\nIn the 12th century the lands on the banks of the Liffey belonged to the Knights Templars. Strongbow built a castle for them, about a mile away from the Danish wall of old Dublin. Here the Templars lived for nearly a century and a half. In 1308, Edward II ruled that they were no longer allowed to practice their religion. Thirty members of the Templars were imprisoned in Dublin. Their lands and rights were given to the priory of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem. They were there until the monasteries were closed in the 16th century. \nThe Manor of Kilmainham was a liberty. This means it had special rights. \"The manor\" was an area that included parts of James's Street and side-streets and went as far as Lucan and Chapelizod. \nUntil the time of Queen Elizabeth, the lord lieutenants used the manor of Kilmainham. In 1559, the earl of Sussex, found that the building at Kilmainham was damaged by a storm. The following year Elizabeth ordered that Dublin Castle be improved so the lord lieutenant could live there. From that time, Kilmainham was no longer used much.\nThings to see.\nThe Royal Hospital Kilmainham is in Kilmainham. It was built on the site where the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem had their priory in Dublin. It is now the Irish Museum of Modern Art. Nearby is also Kilmainham Gaol, where the executions of the leaders of the Easter Rising took place. \nKilmainham also has one of a small number of Viking era burial sites (Old Norse \"haugr\" meaning barrow or mound), within Dublin."}

In this way genetic polymorphism is conserved.\nEvidence for balancing selection can be found in the number of alleles in a population which are maintained above mutation rate frequencies. All modern research has shown that this significant genetic variation is common in panmictic populations. It is the field experience of Darwin, Wallace and others, that natural populations in the wild are extraordinarily varied.

The two major and most studied are heterozygote advantage and frequency-dependent selection.\nMechanisms of balancing selection.\nHeterozygote advantage.\nIn heterozygote advantage, or \"heterotic balancing selection\", an individual who is heterozygous at a particular gene locus has a greater fitness than a homozygous individual. Polymorphisms maintained by this mechanism are \"balanced polymorphisms\".\nA well-studied case is that of sickle cell anemia in humans, a hereditary disease that damages red blood cells. Sickle cell anemia is caused by the inheritance of a variant hemoglobin gene (HgbS) from both parents. In these individuals, hemoglobin in red blood cells is extremely sensitive to oxygen deprivation, and this causes shorter life expectancy.\nA person who inherits the sickle cell gene from one parent, and a normal hemoglobin gene (HgbA) from the other, has a normal life expectancy. The heterozygote is resistant to the malarial parasite which kills a large number of people each year. The heterozygote frequency is kept high because of the fierce selection against both the homozygotes.\nThe heterozygote has a permanent advantage (a higher fitness) wherever malaria exists.\nFrequency-dependent selection.\nFrequency-dependent selection occurs when the fitness of a phenotype depends on its frequency.\nIn \"positive frequency-dependent selection\" the fitness of a phenotype increases as it becomes more common. In \"negative frequency-dependent selection\" the fitness of a phenotype increases as it becomes less common. For example, in prey switching, rare morphs of prey are fitter because predators concentrate on more frequent morphs.\nFitness varies in time and space.\nThe fitness of a genotype may vary greatly between larval and adult stages, or between parts of a habitat range.\nSelection acts at different levels.\nThe fitness of a genotype may depend on the fitness of other genotypes in the population: this covers many natural situations where the best thing to do (from the point of view of survival and reproduction) depends on what other members of the population are doing at the time."}

He got his schooling at Trinity Hall, Cambridge. After that, he went on the Grand Tour of the continent. He became gentleman of the bedchamber to the Prince of Wales.\nCareer in government.\nIn 1715, he entered the House of Commons as Lord Stanhope of Shelford and member for St Germans. He left for Paris and sent the government valuable information about the Jacobite plot. In 1716, he returned to Britain and sat in the House of Commons. He liked to take part in the debates. \nHe took his seat in the House of Lords. In 1728, he was sent to the Hague as ambassador. He did a good job, and got the Order of the Garter in 1730, and the position of Lord Steward. After he did not support Walpole's Excise Bill, he was dismissed from his stewardship. He spent years opposing the ruling party in the House of Lords. First against Robert Walpole and then against King George II of England. In 1744, the \"Broad Bottom\" party, led by Chesterfield and Pitt, came into office. They ruled together with the Pelhams. \nHe was then sent to the Hague as ambassador a second time. The object of his mission was to persuade the Dutch to join in the War of the Austrian Succession. His mission was successful. When he got back to London, he was made Lord-Lieutenancy of Ireland. This was a position he wanted for a long time.\nHe took the his role seriously. He established schools and manufacturing in Ireland. In politics, he found a way to work with both Protestant and Roman Catholic parties. \nHe also still took his seat in the Upper House. In 1751, he helped in making the Gregorian calendar a fact. That Act of Parliament is sometimes known as Chesterfield's Act. After he slowly became deaf, he had to stop his work in the parliament. \nHe lived for some years at the Ranger's House, Chesterfield Walk, Greenwich, London.\nHow he is remembered.\nIn politics, he is best known for the time he was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. As a writer, he is best known for his \"Letters to his Son\". Those letters were not really written to be read by the general public. His widow Eugenia Stanhope first published them in 1774. \"Letters to his Godson\" was published in 1890. Both sets of letters are written with great style and knowledge. \nChesterfield County, Virginia and Chesterfield County, South Carolina in the United States were named in his honour. He also plays a role in the 1757-1758 novel \"The Virginians\" by William Makepeace Thackery.\nThings he has probably said: "}

They would mostly travel with servants and a teacher called a \"bear-leader\".\nExample Grand Tour.\nWhich places the Grand Tour would visit changed through the years. An example would be a British tourist would go from Dover, England and crossed the English Channel to Ostend, in the Spanish Netherlands/Belgium, or Calais, or Le Havre in France.\nThere they could rent or buy a carriage and travel to Paris. Or they could make the trip by boat, traveling up the Seine to Paris, or up the Rhine to Basel.\nIn Paris, the traveler could take lessons in French, dancing, fencing, and horse riding. Paris was popular because of the language and fashion of French high society.\nFrom Paris he would go to Switzerland for a while, often to Geneva. From there the traveler would make a difficult crossing over the Alps into northern Italy.\nOnce in Italy the tourist would visit Turin, then might spend a few months in Florence. Other Grand Tourists would be in Florence to welcome him. A trip to Pisa then on to Padua, Bologna, and Venice.\nVenice was seen as the most important place for Italian architecture, and was very important place to visit.\nFrom Venice the traveler went to Rome to study the ruins of ancient Rome. Some travelers also visited Naples to study music. Naples was often the final destination before turning back.\nFrom here the traveler went north through the Alps to the German-speaking parts of Europe.

At other times, the post was used to move politicians that were no longer wanted in London out of the way.\nBy the mid-to-late 19th century the post was no longer very important. The Chief Secretary for Ireland had become more important in ruling the country than the Lord Lieutenant.\nHousing.\nThe official house of the Lord Lieutenant was the Viceregal Apartments in Dublin Castle. This was also where the Viceregal Court was based. When the Lord Lieutenant had to live in Ireland full time, this had to change. In 1781 the British government bought the former ranger's house in Phoenix Park. It was named the Viceregal Lodge. It is now known as \u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in.

An HCL takes advantage of the hollow cathode effect, which causes conduction at a lower voltage and with more current than a cold cathode lamp that does not have a hollow cathode.\nThe HCL is a light source or radiation source which is used to excite electrons of a metal of interest to a higher energy level. Excitation is when an electron in its lowest energy state, also known as the ground state, undergoes a transition to a higher energy state known as an excited state. These transitions can occur through heat, electrical energy, light, particles, or a chemical reaction.\nInstrument Design.\nA HCL consists of an anode and a cathode inside of a glass tube. The glass tube is filled with some type of inert gas such as argon or neon with a pressure of around 5 torr (666 Pascal). It is important that the gas is inert in order to minimize interferences in the output of the data. The anode is an electrode in which loss of electrons by ionization takes place. The anode is typically constructed of an inert conducting metal to ionize the inert gas. \nThe cathode is made of the pure metal of interest or a mixture of metals containing the metal of interest. It is important that the cathode be stored under a vacuum to avoid any kind of contamination. Contamination of the cathode compromises the purity of the metal of interest and the data obtained for that metal. The material of the window is specifically selected in order to get the best transmission of spectral lines for the cathode element.\nExcitation Process.\nThe excitation process of the element of interest takes place through a few steps. First, the inert gas contained inside of the glass tube is ionized by a voltage. Ionization is the process by which neutral atoms are converted to charged species. This voltage is applied across the anode and the cathode and generates a current of 5-15 mA. This current allows for electrons to move to the anode and cathode. \nIf the voltage applied is large enough, the ions of the inert gas gather enough energy to remove some of the metal atoms of interest from the surface of the cathode by striking the surface. The removal of these atoms produces a cloud around the cathode. The process of producing this cloud is called sputtering. Some of these metal atoms in the cloud have moved to an excited energy state and as they return to their ground state, they emit a specific radiation which is characteristic to the metal of interest. The release of this radiation allows for data to be collected and information gathered pertaining to the metal of interest. After a period of time, the atoms move to the glass walls of the lamp or back to the surface of the cathode.\nOperation Conditions.\nHow well the HCL works and how long it lasts is dependent on the care of operation. When a high voltage is applied, higher currents arise. These higher currents allow for more intense data output but at the same time can produce a number of unexcited atoms in the cloud. These unexcited atoms can interfere with good output data because they are able to absorb the radiation that is emitted from the excited electrons returning to their ground state. This process is called self adsorption. The process of self adsorption results in weaker intensities. Increasing the current too much can also result in a shorter lifetime of the lamp, as well as melting the metal on the cathode thus ruining the lamp."}

Photomultiplier tubes are used to detect low levels of incident light, even as low as a single photon.\nAn incoming photon will strike the photocathode surface of the PMT which will emit electrons. These electrons are then accelerated toward additional electrodes by a potential difference of about 90 volts. Upon striking this electrode, more electrons are emitted. This process repeats nine times, each time generating more and more electrons. This process can generate 106 to 107 electrons for each individual photon. These electrons are then collected at the anode where the current and voltage is then measured. \nPhotomultiplier tubes are highly sensitive and have very quick response times. The sensitivity of the PMT can be improved by cooling it, to reduce temperature induced noise. Photomultiplier tubes must not be exposed to intense light, such as the sun or ambient light because the intensity can damage the components. \nPhotomultiplier tubes are commonly used for analysis techniques as well as medical and research purposes."}

This makes it possible to identify different substances within a test sample. GC-MS has many uses include drug detection, fire investigation, environmental analysis and explosives investigation. It can also be used to identify unknown samples. GC-MS can also be used in airport security to detect substances in luggage or on human beings. Additionally, GC-MS can identify trace elements in deteriorated materials, even after the sample fell apart so much that other tests cannot work.\nGC-MS is the best way for forensic experts to identify substances because it is a \"specific test\". A specific test positively identifies the actual presence of a particular substance in a given sample. A \"non-specific test\" only says that categories of substances are in the sample. Although a non-specific test could statistically suggest the identity of the substance, this could lead to false positive identification.\nHistory.\nThe first research papers on gas-liquid chromatography were published in 1950. Chemists used different detectors to see that compounds were flowing out of the end of the chromatograph. Most of the detectors destroyed the compounds, because they burned them or ioned them. These detectors left chemists guessing the exact identity of each compound in the sample. In the 1950s, Roland Gohlke and Fred McLafferty developed a new combined machine. They used a mass spectrometer as the detector in gas chromatography. These early devices were big, fragile, and originally limited to laboratory settings.\nThe design was complex. The time interval between different compounds flowing out of the chromatograph was hard to control. So, the mass spectrometer had to finish working on one compound before the next one flowed out of the chromatograph. In the early models, the measurements from the mass spectrometer was recorded on graph paper. Highly-trained chemists studied the patterns of peaks to identify each compound. By the 1970s, analog-to-digital converters were added to mass spectrometers. This allowed computers to store and to interpret the results. As computers grew faster and smaller, GC-MS became faster and spread from laboratories into every day life. Today, computerized GC-MS instruments are widely used in environmental monitoring of water, air, and soil. It is also used in the regulation of agriculture, food safety and in the discovery and production of medicine.\nThe development of small computers has helped in the simplification of GC-MS machines. It also greatly reduced the amount of time it takes to analyze a sample. Electronic Associates, Inc. (EAI) was a leading U.S. supplier of analog computers. In 1964, EAI began development of a computer-controlled mass spectrometer under the direction of Robert E. Finnigan. By 1966, over 500 gas-analyzer instruments were sold. In 1967, the Finnigan Instrument Corporation (FIC) was formed. In early 1968, delivered the first prototype quadrapole GC-MS instruments to Stanford and Purdue University. FIC was eventually renamed Finnigan Corporation and went on to establish itself as the worldwide leader in GC-MS systems.\nBasic operation.\nGC-MS can find all of the compounds mixed together in a sample object. The operator dissolves the sample in a liquid. The operator then injects the liquid into a stream of gas. (Helium, Hydrogen or Nitrogen gas are used most often.) The gas flows through a tube with a special coating. Because each compound in the sample sticks to the coating in a different way, each compound comes out of the tube at a different time. So the coating is used to separate each compound that was mixed together in the sample. As each compound comes out at the end of the tube, it is ionized and gets an electric charge. Most compounds break apart when they are ionized. The different pieces fly under a magnet which separates the pieces based on their weight and charge. A computer then measures all of the pieces of each compound. By comparing the measurements against a computer library of known compounds, the computer makes a list of the names of all of the compounds in the sample. The computer can also tell how much of each compound was in the sample.\nInstrumentation.\nThe GC-MS is made up of two major building blocks: the gas chromatograph and the mass spectrometer. The gas chromatograph uses a capillary column which depends on the column's dimensions (length, diameter, film thickness) as well as the phase properties (e.g. 5% phenyl polysiloxane). The difference in the chemical properties between different molecules in a mixture will separate the molecules as the sample travels the length of the column. The molecules take different amounts of time (called the retention time) to come out of (elute from) the gas chromatograph. This allows the mass spectrometer downstream to capture, ionize, accelerate, deflect, and detect the ionized molecules separately. The mass spectrometer does this by breaking each molecule into ionized fragments and detecting these fragments using their mass to charge ratio.\nThese two machines, used together, allow a much finer precision of substance identification than either unit used separately. It is not possible to make an accurate identification of a particular molecule by gas chromatography or mass spectrometry alone. The mass spectrometry process normally requires a very pure sample. In the past, gas chromatography use other detectors such as a Flame Ionization Detector. These detectors cannot separate different molecules that happen to take the same amount of time to travel through the column. (When two different molecules have the same retention time they are said to \"co-elute\".) The co-eluting molecules will confuse the computer programs that are reading a single mass spectrum for both molecules.\nSometimes two different molecules can also have a similar pattern of ionized fragments in a mass spectrometer (mass spectrum). Combining the two processes reduces the possibility of error. It is extremely unlikely that two different molecules will behave in the same way in both a gas chromatograph and a mass spectrometer. Therefore, if a mass spectrum matches the analyte of interest, the retention time of that spectrum can be checked against a characteristic GC retention time to increased confidence that the analyte is in the sample.\nTypes of mass spectrometer detectors.\nThe most common type of MS associated with a GC is the quadrupole mass spectrometer. Hewlett-Packard (now Agilent) markets it under trade name \"Mass Selective Detector\" (MSD). Another relatively common detector is the ion trap mass spectrometer. Additionally one may find a magnetic sector mass spectrometer. However these particular instruments are expensive and bulky and not typically found in high-throughput service laboratories. Other detectors are used such as time of flight (TOF), tandem quadrupoles (MS-MS) (see below), or in the case of an ion trap MSn. The n indicates the number mass spectrometry stages.\nAnalysis.\nA mass spectrometer is typically used in one of two ways: Full Scan or Selective Ion Monitoring (SIM). The typical GC-MS can work either way alone, or both at the same time.\nFull scan MS.\nWhen collecting data in the full scan mode, a target range of mass fragments is selected and put into the instrument's method. An example of a typical broad range of mass fragments to monitor would be \"m/z\" 50 to \"m/z\" 400. The determination of what range to use is largely set by what one expects being in the sample while being aware of the solvent and other possible interferences. If an MS looks for mass fragments with a very low m/z, it may detect air or other possible interferring factors. Using a large scan range decreases the sensitivity of the instrument. The machine will perform fewer scans per second because each scan will take more time to detect a wider range of mass fragments.\nFull scan is useful in determining unknown compounds in a sample. It provides more information than SIM when it comes to confirming or resolving compounds in a sample. Most instruments are controlled by a computer which operates a computer program called an \"instrument method.\" The instrument method controls the temperature in the GC, the MS scan rate and the range of fragment sizes being detected. When a chemist is developing an instrument method, the chemist sends test solutions through the GS-MS in full scan mode. This checks the GC retention time and the mass fragment fingerprint before moving to a SIM instrument method. Specialized GC-MS instruments, such as explosive detectors, have an instrument method pre-loaded at the factory.\nSelected ion monitoring.\nIn selected ion monitoring (SIM), the instrument method focuses on certain ion fragments. Only those mass fragments are detected by the mass spectrometer. The advantages of SIM are that the detection limit is lower since the instrument is only looking at a small number of fragments (e.g. three fragments) during each scan. More scans can take place each second. Since only a few mass fragments of interest are being monitored, matrix interferences are typically lower. To improve the chances of reading a positive result correctly, the ion ratios of the various mass fragments are comparable to a known reference standard.\nTypes of ionization.\nAfter the molecules travel the length of the column, pass through the transfer line and enter into the mass spectrometer they are ionized by various methods. Typically only one ionization method being used at any given time. Once the sample is fragmented it will then be detected, usually by an electron multiplier diode. The diode treats the ionized mass fragment like an electrical signal that is then detected.\nChemists select an ionization technique separately from choosing Full Scan or SIM monitoring.\nElectron ionization.\nThe most common type of ionization is electron ionization (EI). The molecules enter into the MS (the source is a quadrupole or the ion trap itself in an ion trap MS) where they are hit with free electrons emitted from a filament. This is like the filament one would find in a standard incandescent light bulb. The electrons hit the molecules, causing the molecule to fragment in a characteristic way that can be repeated. This \"hard ionization\" technique results in the creation of more fragments of low mass to charge ratio (m/z). EI has few, if any, fragments having a mass that is near the mass of the original molecule. Chemists consider hard ionization to be shooting electrons into the sample molecules. In contrast, \"soft ionization\" is placing a charge on the sample molecule by hitting it with an introduced gas. The molecular fragmentation pattern depends on the electron energy applied to the system, typically 70 eV (electron Volts). The use of 70 eV helps to compare the spectra generated from the test sample against known library spectra. (The library spectra can come from manufacturer-supplied software or software developed by the National Institute of Standards (NIST-USA)). The software searches the library spectra using a matching algorithm such as Probability Based Matching or dot-product matching. Many method standardization agencies now control these algorithms and methods to assure their objectivity.\nChemical ionization.\nIn chemical ionization (CI), a reagent gas, typically methane or ammonia is put into the mass spectrometer. There are two types of CI: positive CI or negative CI. Either way, the reagent gas will interact with the electrons and analyte and cause a 'soft' ionization of the molecule of interest. A softer ionization fragments the molecule to a lower degree than the hard ionization of EI. Chemists prefer CI over EI. This is because CI produces at least one mass fragment with a weight, that is nearly the same as the molecular weight of the analyte of interest.\nIn Positive Chemical Ionization (PCI) the reagent gas interacts with the target molecule, most often with a proton exchange. This produces the ion species in relatively high amounts.\nIn Negative Chemical Ionization (NCI) the reagent gas decreases the impact of the free electrons on the target analyte. This decreased energy typically leaves the fragment in great supply. (The fragments do not break up further.)\nInterpretation.\nThe primary goal of instrument analysis is to measure an amount of substance. This is done by comparing the relative concentrations among the atomic masses in the generated mass spectrum. Two kinds of analysis are possible, comparative and original. Comparative analysis essentially compares the given spectrum to a spectrum library to see if its characteristics are present for some known sample in the library. This is best performed by a computer because there are many visual distortions that can take place due to variations in scale. Computers can also correlate more data (such as the retention times identified by the GC), to more accurately relate certain data.\nAnother method of analysis measures the peaks in relation to one another. In this method, the tallest peak is set at 100%. The other peaks given a value equal to the ratio of the peak height to the tallest peak height. All values above 3% are assigned. The total mass of the unknown compound is normally indicated by the parent peak. The value of this parent peak can be used to fit with a chemical formula containing the various elements which are believed to be in the compound. The isotope pattern in the spectrum is unique for elements that have many isotopes. So, it can also be used to identify the various elements present. This tells the overall chemical formula of the unknown molecule. Because a molecule's structure and bonds break apart in characteristic ways, they can be identified from the difference in peak masses. The identified molecule structure must be consistent with the characteristics recorded by GC-MS. Typically, this identification is done automatically by computer programs which come with the instrument. Those programs match the spectra against a library of known compounds that have same list of elements which could be present in the sample.\nA \u201cfull spectrum\u201d analysis considers all the \u201cpeaks\u201d within a spectrum. But, selective ion monitoring (SIM) only monitors selected peaks associated with a specific substance. Chemists assume that at a given retention time, a set of ions is characteristic of a certain compound. SIM is a fast and efficient analysis. SIM works best when the analyst has previous information about a sample or is only looking for a few specific substances. When the amount of information collected about the ions in a given gas chromatographic peak decreases, the sensitivity of the analysis increases. So, SIM analysis allows for a smaller quantity of a compound to be detected and measured. But the degree of certainty about the identity of that compound is reduced.\nGC-tandem MS.\nWhen a second phase of mass fragmentation is added, for example using a second quadrupole in a quadrupole instrument, it is called tandem MS (MS/MS). MS/MS are good at measuring low levels of target compounds in a sample with a matrix of background compounds that are not of interest.\nThe first quadrupole (Q1) is connected with a collision cell (q2) and another quadrupole (Q3). Both quadrupoles can be used in scanning or static mode, depending on the type of MS/MS analysis used. Types of analysis include product ion scan, precursor ion scan, Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) and Neutral Loss Scan. For example: When Q1 is in static mode (looking at one mass only as in SIM), and Q3 is in scanning mode, one obtains a so-called product ion spectrum (also called \"daughter spectrum\"). From this spectrum, one can select a prominent product ion which can be the product ion for the chosen precursor ion. The pair is called a \"transition\" and forms the basis for SRM. SRM is highly specific and almost completely eliminates matrix background.\nApplications.\nEnvironmental monitoring and cleanup.\nMany chemists believe that GC-MS is the best tool for monitoring organic pollutants in the environment. The cost of GC-MS equipment has decreased a lot. The reliability of GC-MS has increased at the same time. Both improvements have increased use in environmental studies. Some compounds, such as certain pesticides and herbicides, cannot be identified by GS-MS. They are too similar to other related compounds. But for most organic analysis of environmental samples, including many major classes of pesticides, GC-MS is very sensitive and effective.\nCriminal forensics.\nGC-MS can analyze the particles from a human body in order to help link a criminal to a crime. The law accepts using GC-MS to analyze fire debris. In fact, the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) has a standard for fire debris analysis. GCMS/MS is especially useful here as samples often contain very complex matrices and results, used in court, need to be highly accurate.\nLaw enforcement.\nGC-MS is used for detection of illegal narcotics, and may eventually replace drug-sniffing dogs. It is also commonly used in forensic toxicology. It helps to find drugs and/or poisons in biological specimens taken from suspects, victims, or a dead body.\nSecurity.\nAfter the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, explosive detection systems have become a part of all US airports. These systems run on a host of technologies, many of them based on GC-MS. There are only three manufacturers certified by the FAA to provide these systems. The first is Thermo Detection (formerly Thermedics), which produces the EGIS, a GC-MS-based line of explosives detectors. The second is Barringer Technologies, which is now owned by Smith's Detection Systems. The third is Ion Track Instruments (part of General Electric Infrastructure Security Systems).\nFood, beverage and perfume analysis.\nFoods and beverages contain a lot of aromatic compounds, some naturally present in the raw materials and some forming during processing. GC-MS is extensively used for the analysis of these compounds which include esters, fatty acids, alcohols, aldehydes, terpenes, etc. It is also used to detect and measure contaminants from spoilage or adulteration which may be harmful. The contaminants are often controlled by governmental agencies, for example pesticides.\nAstrochemistry.\nSeveral GC-MS have left earth. Two went to Mars in the Viking program. Venera 11 and 12 and Pioneer Venus analysed the atmosphere of Venus with GC-MS. The Huygens probe of the Cassini-Huygens mission landed one GC-MS on Saturn's largest moon, Titan. The material in the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko will be analysed by the Rosetta mission with a chiral GC-MS in 2014.\nMedicine.\nGC-MS are used in newborn screening tests. These tests can find dozens of congenital metabolic diseases (also known as Inborn error of metabolism). GC-MS can determine compounds in urine even in very small amounts. These compounds are normally not present but appear in individuals suffering with metabolic disorders. This is becoming a common way to diagnose IEM for earlier diagnosis and beginning of treatment. This eventually leads to a better outcome. It is now possible to test a newborn for over 100 genetic metabolic disorders by a urine test at birth based on GC-MS.\nIn combination with isotopic labeling of metabolic compounds, the GC-MS is used for determining metabolic activity. Most applications are based on the use of 13C as the labeling and the measurement of 13C-12C ratios with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS). A IRMS is an mass spectrometer with a detector designed to measure a few select ions and return values as ratios."}

She is from Amarillo, Texas. She was the twelfth place finalist on the ninth season of \"American Idol\".\nEarly life.\nBorn on August 13, 1985, Brown is the daughter of the pastors of Victory Church, a local Christian Church, in Amarillo. There, she served as Venue (Victory's college-aged group) director and taught civics and Christian values to Victory's internship students. During her childhood, she learned how to play the violin. She also spent time in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where she had Bible schooling. Her education includes studying art. Her musical influences include folk and country, as well as rock music, such as Lady Antebellum, Kings of Leon, Coldplay, and U2, apart from Patsy Cline, Joni Mitchell, Dolly Parton, and Pete Yorn.\n\"American Idol\".\nBrown first auditioned for the eighth season of \"American Idol\", where she made it into the Top 54 of the Hollywood rounds. Brown later auditioned in Orlando, Florida with the song \"Over the Rainbow\", from \"The Wizard of Oz\", by Judy Garland. The judges all loved her performance, including guest judge Kristin Chenoweth, and she made it through to the next round. During Hollywood week, her performance of \"What a Wonderful World\" was featured as a montage for contestants who made it to the Top 24. She performed \"Landslide\" on the first night of the semi-finals but did not impress the judges. The judges did not like her performance of \"Kiss Me\" by Sixpence None the Richer during the second week. Despite this, it was well received by the band's lead singer, Leigh Nash. Her cover of Brandi Carlile's \"The Story\", on the final night before the finals, was considered to be better. Brown eventually made it to the Top 12.\nBrown's performance of \"Ruby Tuesday\" by The Rolling Stones (she stated that her version is the one by Melanie Safka), was described by the judges as not having energy, but Simon Cowell added that there was nothing wrong with her vocals. Brown was eliminated from the show on March 17, 2010. The song \"What a Wonderful World\" was played at the beginning of the episode, with a montage of the Top 12's journey, setting the tone for her elimination. Her elimination caused problems after Ryan Seacrest tweeted the results. Angry fans did not watch the show which had \"the smallest audience among 18-49 year-olds for a regularly scheduled in-season episode in \"Idol\" history\".\nBrown thanked her fans for their support and plans to return to her hometown, after doing interviews in New York. She says she will try \"acting\" (from a criticism to her by Simon Cowell) as well as a career in music. In her final moments on the show, she said she might try country music although her MySpace page lists \"pop\" and \"folk\" as her genres. A notable line of Brown in the show was: \"You've got to take no's and turn them into yes'es\"\nCareer after \"Idol\".\nAfter leaving Idol, Brown gave several media interviews with \"Entertainment Weekly\", \"USA Today\", \"The Los Angeles Times\", \"People\", several Fox affiliates, MTV, E!, with Ryan Seacrest on his radio show (\"On Air with Ryan Seacrest\"), with Ellen DeGeneres on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\", along with several in New York, including \"the Wendy Williams Show\" and \"The Late Show with David Letterman\", where she performed \"What a Wonderful World\". Among the finalists, her closest friends are Paige Miles and Lee DeWyze although she is friends with all of them including Siobhan Magnus and Katie Stevens. She said in these interviews that she is planning to continue her career in music but she is also open to any offers that may come to her. She now lives in Nashville, Tennessee. She released an EP entitled \"Let It Go\" on May 31, 2011. In 2011, Brown signed a management contract with Tracy Lawrence and she will be touring at the CMA Fest in Nashville in June 2011.\nDiscography.\n\"Let It Go\" (2011).\nThe alternative country EP \"Let It Go\", with five songs on it, was released on May 31, 2011 through the independent (self-owned) record label LEB Records. Brown's voice was described as a mix \"...of sweet, yet haunting tones with a hint of Brenda Lee\". Her writing style was described as \"...pop lyrics resting on a bed of American Bluegrass.\"\nTrack listing.\nThe official track listing released through the iTunes Store and Amazon.com on 31 May 2011."}

Recall a mixture can be composed of many substances each with different physical and chemical properties which can be used to differentiate them. SEC essentially allows components that are larger in size to exit the column (elute) first while components that are smaller in size will exit the column last. \nA typical column used in SEC has two substances called phases that interact with the mixture and these substances help force the separation of the mixture. The mobile phase is a solvent which helps carry the mixture down the column, and the stationary phase which does not move. Unlike other chromatography methods, the stationary phase used in SEC does not exploit the polarity of each component. It is worth noting there is no chemical interaction between the stationary phase and a component. A column could be packed with two types of stationary phase material. First the stationary phase could be a porous solid. A common porous solid is silica which has a diameter of 5-10\u00b5m and a pore sizes ranging from 100-1000\u00c5. Silica provides excellent rigidity and will not move throughout the column. Porous solids are also stable at high pressures and temperatures which allows for the use of a vast variety of solvents. Unfortunately silica particles have a tendency to allow absorb soluble components and they have the capacity to break down components into atoms. For these reasons columns could also be packed with porous gels. The structure of gel is vastly different from a porous solid because gel\u2019s have a polymer-like (a repeating structure of the same substance) structure. Gels have been shown to be more effective than porous solids at allowing components through its pores. Gels have pore sizes ranging from 100-100000\u00c5. So how is it that larger molecules exit the column before smaller molecules? \nThe porous material will not allow larger molecules to pass so these molecules go to the next pore and again they cannot pass. They eventually get to the bottom of the column and exit the column. Remember there is volume inside the column that is not inhabited by the stationary phase which allows for the flow of both the mobile phase and the sample. These larger molecules then find themselves at the bottom of the column whereas smaller molecules have a longer path to travel. Smaller molecules can pass through a pore and then pass through another one. The smaller a molecule is, the greater the chance is that it can fit into a pore which means the longer it spends inside the column.\nReading a Chromatogram.\nNotice the graph is logarithmic not linear. There at two distinct positions on the curve the exclusion limit and the permeation limit. The exclusion limit defines the maximum molecular weight that can enter a pore, while the permeation limit signifies the minimum molecular weight to enter a pore. The curve itself is called the permeation region and this provides a range of molecular weights which could be found in the experiment. Retention time, how long the component spends in the column, is plotted against molecular weight. The peaks located in Figures 1 and 2 are similar to peaks liquid or gas chromatography readout. Normally peaks found in liquid or gas chromatography indicates how many components are in a mixture if the number of components is unknown and the relative amount of each component in the mixture within a given range. In the case of SEC these peaks indicate the relative amount of each component (based on molecular weight) within the permeation region. \nAdvantages/Disadvantages.\nSEC has several advantages and disadvantages. First in SEC the time it takes the mixture to exit the column can be controlled. Depending on the chemical characteristics of the mixture and its components the process could be quick or slow. Second the peaks are well-defined, sharp, and narrow. All characteristics indicate SCE provides good sensitivity. Next there is low mass loss since the sample theoretically is not supposed to come interact with the stationary phase. Last the stability of the stationary phase allows close packing to provide greater separation of components in the sample. \nA clear disadvantage to SEC is with short retention times the peaks overlap and little information could be extracted from such data. Resolution (how well two peaks can two peaks be distinguished between) must be sacrificed if the process is to be shorter in time. SEC does not provide data to distinguish between components of similar molecular mass. For example if component A has molecular mass equal to 900 g/mol and component B has molecular mass equal to 950 g/mol, SEC will show one peak in this region and both components will be represented by the same peak. To have statistically different peaks there should be a 10% difference between molecular weight. Also lumped into this category are enantiomers and diastereomers which are molecules of the same molecular weight but have slightly different structures. Last SEC fails to take into account for a component\u2019s viscosity or resistance to flow."}

These plates consist of a layer of silica and are usually backed by a thin piece of glass, although other materials like plastic may be used. The silica coating on the front of the TLC plate is called the stationary phase. \nPerforming TLC.\nThe process of running a TLC experiment starts with placing a small droplet of liquid analyte near the bottom of the TLC plate. This is called \u201cspotting\u201d the TLC plate. Very thin glass tubes are commonly used as spotters.\nOnce a plate has been spotted, it is placed into a glass container with a small amount of solvent. This solvent is called the mobile phase. It is important that the height of the solvent is below the height that the compound was spotted on the plate. As the solvent moves up the TLC plate by capillary action, the compound will also move. The compound will be separated into its components based upon each component\u2019s attraction for the stationary phase versus the mobile phase. Components that are attracted to the mobile phase more than they are attracted to the stationary phase will move further up the column. Attractive forces are based on polarity differences. \nThe TLC plate should be removed before the solvent reaches the top of the plate. Separated compounds will sometimes be colored, but further work is often required for analysis. Many compounds will be illuminated when the TLC plate is placed under an ultraviolet lamp. TLC plates are also commonly dipped in stains (such as anisaldehyde, potassium permanganate, or iodine) to force a compound to appear on the plate.\nApplication.\nTLC is commonly used by organic chemists to monitor the progress of reactions. The presence of starting material and products may be monitored using a single TLC plate.\nBased on the results of a TLC experiment, a larger volume of mixture may be separated by another technique (like column chromatography) using a similar solvent system. Or, a TLC experiment may be repeated using a different solvent. Mixtures of solvents may also be used. Use of different solvents will affect how well individual components are separated on the TLC plate."}

The Philippine Commonwealth had been created by the Tydings-McDuffie Act, which was approved by the U.S. Congress in 1934. When Manuel L. Quezon became president in 1935, he was the first Filipino to head an elected government in the Philippines.\nThe President of the Philippine Commonwealth had strong control of the islands and was guided by a Supreme Court. The National Assembly or law-making part of the government, members mostly come from the Nacionalista Party, was at first only one, but later became two, a lower part and a higher part. In 1937, the government chose Tagalog, the language of Manila, as the national language.\nWomen were allowed to vote, and the economy was strong.\nThe Philippine Commonwealth government was forced out of the country from 1942\u20131945, when the Philippines was under Japanese control. In 1946, the Philippine Commonwealth ended when the Third Philippines Republic began.\nNames.\nThe Philippine Commonwealth was also known as the Commonwealth of the Philippines, or simply as the Commonwealth. It had official names in Malasariling Pamahalan ng Pilipinas (p\u026al\u026a\u02c8pin\u0250s) and Mancomunidad Filipina (f\u026al\u026a\u02c8pin\u0250). The 1935 constitution specifies Philippines as the country's short form name and uses Philippine Islands only to refer to pre-1935 status and institutions. Under the previous regime, known most formally as the Territory of the Philippine Islands, both terms had official status.\nStructure.\nThe Philippine Commonwealth had its own constitution, which remained effective until 1973, and was self-governing although foreign policy and military affairs would be under the responsibility of the United States, and certain legislation required the approval of the American President.\nIt featured a very strong President, a single National Assembly, and a Supreme Court, all composed entirely of Filipinos, as well as an elected Resident Commissioner to the United States House of Representatives (as Puerto Rico does today). An American High Commissioner and an American Military Advisor, were also present in the government while a Field Marshall was in charge of the Philippine Army.\nIn 1939-40, after an amendment in the Constitution, an upper and lower Congress, consisting of a Philippine Senate, and of a House of Representatives, was restored replacing the National Assembly.\nHistory.\nStart.\nThe pre-1935 U.S. territorial administration, or Insular Government, was headed by a governor general who was appointed by the president of the U.S. In December 1932, the U.S. Congress passed the Hare-Hawes-Cutting Act (First Philippine Independence Act) with the premise of granting Filipinos independence. Provisions of the bill included reserving several military and naval bases for the United States, as well as imposing tariffs and quotas on Philippine exports. It was vetoed by President Herbert Hoover but the American Congress overrode his veto in 1933 and passed the bill. The bill, however, was opposed by the then Philippine Senate President Manuel L. Quezon and was also rejected by the Philippine Senate.\nThis led to the creation and passing of a new bill known as Tydings-McDuffie Act, or Philippine Independence Act, which allowed the establishment of the Commonwealth of the Philippines with a 10-year period of peaceful transition to full independence. The Commonwealth was officially inaugurated on November 15, 1935. \nA Constitutional Convention was convened in Manila on July 30, 1934. On February 8, 1935, the 1935 Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines was approved by the convention by a vote of 177 to 1. The constitution was approved by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on March 23, 1935 and ratified by popular vote on May 14, 1935.\nIn October 1935, Philippine presidential elections were held. Candidates included former president Emilio Aguinaldo, the \"Philippine Independent Church\" leader Gregorio Aglipay, and others. Manuel L. Quezon and Sergio Osme\u00f1a of the Nacionalista Party were proclaimed the winners, winning the seats of president and vice-president, respectively.\nThe Commonwealth Government was inaugurated on the morning of November 15, 1935, in ceremonies held on the steps of the Old Congress Building in Manila. The event was attended by a crowd of around 300,000 people. \nBefore World War II.\nThe new government embarked on ambitious nation-building policies in preparation for economic and political independence. These included national defense (such as the National Defense Act of 1935, which organized a conscription for service in the country), greater control over the economy, the perfection of democratic institutions, reforms in education, improvement of transport, the promotion of local capital, industrialization, and the colonization of Mindanao.\nHowever, uncertainties, especially in the diplomatic and military situation in Southeast Asia, in the level of U.S. commitment to the future Republic of the Philippines, and in the economy due to the Great Depression, proved to be major problems. The situation was further complicated by the presence of agrarian unrest, and of power struggles between Osme\u00f1a and Quezon, especially after Quezon was permitted to be re-elected after one six-year term.\nA proper evaluation of the policies' effectiveness or failure is difficult due to Japanese invasion and occupation during World War II.\nWorld War II.\nJapan launched a surprise attack on the Philippines on December 8, 1941. The Philippine Commonwealth government drafted the Philippine Army into the U.S. Army Forces Far East, which would resist Japanese occupation. Manila was declared an open city to prevent its destruction, and it was occupied by the Japanese on January 2, 1942. Meanwhile, battles against the Japanese continued on the Bataan Peninsula, Corregidor, and Leyte, until the final surrender of United States-Philippine forces on May 1942.\nQuezon and Osme\u00f1a were escorted by troops from Manila to Corregidor, and later they left for Australia and then the U.S. There they set up a government in exile, which participated in the Pacific War Council as well as the Declaration by United Nations. During this exile, Quezon became ill with tuberculosis, and later he died of it. Osme\u00f1a replaced him as the president.\nMeanwhile, the Japanese military organized a new government in the Philippines known as the Second Philippine Republic, which was headed by president Jos\u00e9 P. Laurel. This government ended up being very unpopular.\nThe resistance to the Japanese occupation continued in the Philippines. This included the \"Hukbalahap\" (\"People's Army Against the Japanese\"), which consisted of 30,000 armed people and controlled much of Central Luzon. Remnants of the Philippine Army also fought the Japanese through guerrilla warfare, and it was successful, since all but 12 of the 48 provinces were liberated.\nThe American General Douglas MacArthur's army landed on Leyte on 20 October 1944, and they were all welcomed as liberators, along with Philippine Commonwealth troops when other amphibious landings soon followed. Fighting continued in remote corners of the Philippines, until Japan's surrender in August 1945, which was signed on 2 September in Tokyo Bay. Estimates for Filipino casualties reached one million, and Manila was extensively damaged when certain Japanese forces refused to vacate the city (against their orders from the Japanese High Command).\nAfter the War in the Philippines, the Philippine Commonwealth was restored, and a one-year transitional period in preparation for independence began. Elections followed in April 1946 with Manuel Roxas winning as the first president of the independent Republic of the Philippines and Elpidio Quirino winning as vice-president. In spite of the years of Japanese occupation, the Philippines became independent exactly as scheduled a decade before, on July 4, 1946.\nIndependence.\nThe Commonwealth ended when the U.S. recognized Philippine independence on July 4, 1946, as scheduled. However, the economy remained dependent to the U.S. This was due to the Bell Trade Act, otherwise known as the Philippine Trade Act, which was a precondition for receiving war rehabilitation grants from the United States.\nPolicies.\nUprisings and agrarian reform.\nAt the time, tenant farmers held grievances often rooted to debt caused by the sharecropping system, as well as by the dramatic increase in population, which added economic pressure to the tenant farmers' families. As a result, an agrarian reform program was initiated by the Commonwealth. However, success of the program was hampered by ongoing clashes between tenants and landowners.\nAn example of these clashes includes one initiated by Benigno Ramos through his \"Sakdalista\" movement, which advocated tax reductions, land reforms, the breakup of the large estates or \"haciendas\", and the severing of American ties. The uprising, which occurred in Central Luzon in May 1935, claimed about a hundred lives.\nNational language.\nDue to the diverse number of Philippine languages, a program for the \"development and adoption of a common national language based on the existing native dialects\" was drafted in the 1935 Philippine constitution. The Commonwealth created a \"Surian ng Wikang Pambansa\" (National Language Institute), which was composed of Quezon and six other members from various ethnic groups. A deliberation was held, and the Tagalog (due to its extensive literary tradition) was selected as the basis for the \"national language\" to be called \"Philipino\".\nIn 1940, the Commonwealth authorized the creation of a dictionary and grammar book for the language. On the same year, Commonwealth Act 570 was passed, allowing Pilipino to become an official language upon independence.\nEconomy.\nThe economy of the Commonwealth was mostly based on farming, as agriculture-based. Farmers grew abaca, coconuts and coconut oil, sugar, and timber trees. Other foreign income came from money spent at the American army, navy, and air bases in the Philippines, such as the naval base at Subic Bay and Clark Air Base. The economy was good until World War II stopped growth.\nDemographics.\nIn 1941, the estimated population of the Philippines reached 17,000,000 while Manila's population was 684,000. The number of Chinese people rose to 117,000. There were also 30,000 Japanese people, with 20,000 living in Davao, and 9,000 U.S.-Mexicans. English was spoken by 27% of the population. Spanish was spoken by only 3%.\nThe following is the estimated number of speakers of the dominant languages:\nList of presidents.\nThe colors indicate the political party or party groups of each President at Election Day."}

These detectors are best at detecting organic compounds. The first flame ionization detector was developed in 1957 in Australia.\nThe purpose of a FID is to detect compounds as they exit the gas chromatography column. The compounds that are exiting the column are in a gaseous state. Detection is done by first turning the gas compounds into ions and electrons and then collecting the charged molecules. The FID turns compounds into ions and electrons by putting them into a flame. The fuel used to make the flame in FIDs is usually made of a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen. As these charged materials are collected, they make a current which is measured. The larger the current the more charged compounds are being collected. Currents for FIDs are usually about 10-12 amps and are measured by a high-impedance picoammeter.\nFlame ionization detectors are used most often for organic compounds. This is because organic compounds contain lot of carbon atoms which easily turn into ions. Reduced carbons (carbons with no oxygen bonds) make the most ions. Other carbons such as alcohols (C-O-H) and carbonyls (C=O) do not make as many ions.\nMany times organic samples being tested are not pure. The samples often contain impurities such as water (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrous oxides (NO), and noble gases. The FID does not detect these impurities because they do not burn. This makes the FID a very useful detector because the samples being tested do not have to be purified before being tested.\nFID can be used to detect very small amounts of material, as small as 10-13 g/s. It is also accurate over a large range of molecule amounts (a range of over 107). One problem with FID is that it destroys the sample being tested. Any sample used in gas chromatography with an FID cannot be used for other measurements afterwards. Also, a lot of fuel is required as well as very exact equipment to get exact results."}

Normal spectroscopy is frequency-domain spectroscopy. It measures radiation as a function of frequency or wavelength. Time-domain spectroscopy usually requires the use of Fourier transforms.\nTwo monochromatic lights of different frequencies can combine to show interference patterns. At time t=0, the waves interfere constructively. This gives a maximum in the added plot. The waves get more out of phase. This leads to destructive interference and a minimum in the added plot. From one peak maximum to the next is a \"cycle\". So when looking at two monochromatic lights, they can be graphed as two lines in the frequency-domain (this plot shows power, P(\u03bd), as a function of frequency). The same two lights can be plotted as the sum of their waves in the time-domain (this plot shows power, P(t), as a function of time).\n Absorptions in spectra usually look like broad peaks. This means that a peak may contain many wavelengths of radiation. These wavelengths can be plotted in the time domain. Notice that there are now smaller areas of constructive interference. This is because the closely spaced wavelengths quickly become more and more out of phase.\nGetting time-domain spectra.\nSpectroscopy done with visible or infrared radiation involves wavelengths of 1012 to 1015 Hz. Phototransducers (instruments that convert light to information readable by a computer) cannot make measurements that quickly. What is needed, then, is a way to make these high-frequency signals into low-frequency signals. For optical spectroscopy (such as infrared spectroscopy) the most common way to do this is by using a \"Michelson interferometer\".\nMonochromatic light traveling through a Michelson interferometer is split into two beams by a beam splitter. These beams travel to mirrors, reflect, and then recombine at the beam splitter. One of the mirrors can be moved. If the two mirrors are the same distance apart, they meet at the beam splitter in-phase and show constructive interference. As the one mirror is moved, the beams become slightly more out of phase. When the movable mirror has moved a distance equal to \u00bc of the light's wavelength, the extra distance it travels is \u00bd the light's wavelength. This means that when the two beams combine at the beam splitter, they destructively interfere. So moving the mirror a total distance of \u00bd the wavelength of light means the spectra will show one complete cycle. One could then plot the power of radiation as a function of distance traveled by the movable mirror. However, by knowing the speed of the movable mirror the power of radiation can be plotted as a function of time.\nMost time-domain spectroscopy experiments involve broadband radiation (radiation that consists of a large range of wavelengths). \nApplications.\nTime-domain spectroscopy is used very often in infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and NMR spectroscopy(FT-NMR). It has several advantages over frequency-domain spectroscopy. In frequency-domain experiments, each wavelength must be measured one at a time. This means scans can take several minutes. A single time-domain experiment takes no longer than a minute. Usually it only takes seconds. This means that many scans may be taken for a given sample, and that the scans can be averaged. So not only is the time-domain experiment faster, but it can also have a better signal to noise ratio.\nReferences.\nD.A. Skoog, F.J. Holler, S.R.

It is the largest reservoir of microbes in the human microbiome.\nThe human body, consisting of about 100 trillion cells, carries about ten times as many microorganisms in the intestines. The metabolic activities performed by these bacteria resemble those of an organ, leading some to call gut flora a 'forgotten organ'. It is estimated that these gut flora have around 100 times as many genes in aggregate as there are in the human genome.\nBacteria make up most of the flora in the colon and up to 60% of the dry mass of faeces. Somewhere between 300 and 1000 different species live in the gut, with most estimates at about 500. However, it is probable that 99% of the bacteria come from about 30 or 40 species. Fungi and protozoa also make up a part of the gut flora, but little is known about their activities.\nResearch suggests that the relationship between gut flora and humans is not merely commensal (a non-harmful coexistence), but rather a symbiotic relationship. Though people can survive without gut flora, the microorganisms perform a host of useful functions, such as fermenting unused energy substrates, training the immune system, preventing growth of harmful, pathogenic bacteria, regulating the development of the gut, producing vitamins for the host (such as biotin and vitamin K), and producing hormones to direct the host to store fats. However, in some conditions, some species can cause disease by producing an infection or increasing cancer risk for the host.\nSuch food compounds as polyphenols, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides may be useful for good bacteria and help reduce pathogenic species of human gut flora.\nOver 99% of the bacteria in the gut are anaerobic, but in the cecum, aerobic bacteria reach high densities.\nThe traditional view is that no metazoan phylum can break down cellulose by producing the enzyme cellulase. Instead, herbivores contain, in their gut, microorganisms which produce cellulase. This is important because cellulose is the most common organic compound on Earth. About 33% of all plant matter is cellulose (the cellulose content of cotton is 90% and that of wood is 40\u201350%). Recently, evidence has emerged that some animals do produce their own cellulase. The question is not yet quite settled."}

In these constituencies people known as candidates, each of whom usually represents a different political party, will stand for election to the country's parliament. In the individual constituencies, the candidate who gets the most votes from people, wins the race to be elected to a seat in parliament. Plurality is another name for such an electoral system. It is in contrast to the majority system, where the winning candidate must have more votes than \"all other candidates combined\".\nIf a party wins over 50% of the seats, it can form a majority government. If no single party wins over 50% of the seats, then either the party with the most seats can form a minority government, or a coalition government can be formed from two or more of the other political parties who together have over 50% of the seats.\nCountries using first-past-the-post include the United Kingdom, Canada, India and partly in the United States.\nConsiderations.\nFirst-past-the-post, often called 'plurality voting', is the most common method for electing representatives in the United States and some other countries. Voters vote for one candidate, and the candidate with the most votes wins.\nPolitical parties often use a primary in order to avoid splitting their party vote in a general election. For example, if 60% of the voters are Republican, and 40% Democrat, but two Republicans run for the same office and each get 30% of the vote, the Democrat would win with 40%, since that is the most votes, even if 60% of voters least preferred the Democrat.\nIf more than two candidates are on the general election ballot, voters often compromise vote an acceptable candidate whom they think has a chance of winning.\nOpponents of plurality voting argue that the media has too much power since they tell people which of the two has a chance and that voting for a third candidate is in effect voting for the worse of the two strong candidates. It is theoretically possible that the two \"front runner\" candidates not to be not centrist and not to represent the people.\nProponents of plurality voting argue that it is very simple and that it forces voters to elect a centrist candidate through compromise voting. To avoid its problems, some elections require a minimum percentage of votes, or a majority, through a \"run-off election\".\nExample.\nIn a first-past-the-post system, candidate A wins because that candidate received more votes than anyone else."}

This energy causes an electronic transition from a ground state (non excited) to an excited state.\nThis is used in a technique of absorption spectroscopy known as ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy.\nEnergy absorption.\nDifferent molecules will absorb different wavelengths of light. The wavelengths of light for UV-visible absorption are from about 200 nanometers to 800 nanometers. This is a section of the electromagnetic spectrum pictured.\nAbsorption of light starts with energy of a certain wavelength in this UV-visible region being exposed to a molecule. The light/energy then excites the ground state (non excited) outer or valence electrons to an excited state (high energy). The outcome of this can be measured by a UV-visible spectrophotometer. The data is shown as a spectrum with absorption versus wavelength. This pattern can be used to learn properties of the molecule. Only certain molecules can absorb light in this region.\nChromophores.\nMolecules that absorb light at these wavelengths are called chromophores. Chromophores are functional groups of a molecule that absorb light in this UV-Visible region. They are most of the time characterized by delocalized pi electrons. Pi electrons refer to a type of bond that occurs between electron orbitals called pi orbitals. When many of these pi bonds exist in a molecule this allows electrons to be delocalized or spread out across a molecule. An example of this type of molecule is pictured below. Many dyes (colored molecules) are characterized by these delocalized pi electrons and their color. These molecules can be used for pH indicators to determine if a solution is acidic or basic. The addition of acid or base disrupts the delocalized pi electrons. This disruption causes a color change.\nBeer\u2019s Law.\nThe absorption of a molecule can be used to determine the concentration of the molecule in solution. To find concentration, Beer\u2019s law is used. This is a mathematical relationship shown by the equation below. \nformula_1\nA= absorption, a=absorptivity coefficient, b=pathlength, c=concentration\nThe components of Beer\u2019s Law can be determined by tests. They can also be referenced in literature. If the absorption is measured by a UV-visible spectrophotometer (instrument to measure absorption and wavelength of molecules), pathlength (b) is related to the sample container used in the test. The sample container (named a cuvette) is made of a material that does not absorb light in this region. The thickness of this cuvette is a known value. This is the pathlength the light will travel through to reach the sample. \nThe molar absorptivity coefficient can be calculated by measuring the absorption of a sample of a known concentration and known pathlength. The absorptivity coefficient units are dependent on the pathlength and concentration units. Molar absorptivity units are L mol-1\u00a0cm-1 when the concentration units are molarity. The absorptivity is a measure of how strongly a molecule absorbs light at a particular wavelength. Once this constant is determined, unknown concentrations can be determined from this relationship."}

There are many different systems of units, so some conversions can be very complex. Most conversions involve a \"conversion factor\" (named \"m\"), and a shift amount (such as \"b\"), to change from a unit \"x\" into a unit \"y\" by the general equation: y = mx + b. That type of conversion is known as a \"linear transform\" or a mathematical \"translation\".\nA conversion factor is a ratio that lets one convert a measured quantity to a different unit of measure without changing the amount. When a conversion factor is multiplied by the item one are converting, it cancels out the units they does not want and leaves those that they do. Because the top and bottom of conversion factors are the same, conversion factors always equal 1. For example, a conversion factor of (1 day)/(24 hours) equals 1, because 1 day = 24 hours.\nOne of the most common conversions is to change meters (or \"metres\") into feet, by multiplying the amount in meters by about 3.28 feet per meter (ft/m):\nTypically, conversion amounts are rounded to the same precision as the original input amount, such as 10 meters being 33\u00a0feet (when 32.8 feet is rounded to 2 digits as \"33\")."}

Roy Rogers Restaurants chain was named after him. He and his wife Dale Evans, his golden horse, named Trigger, and his German Shepherd dog, named Bullet, were in more than 100 movies and \"The Roy Rogers Show\". The show came on radio and then came on television from 1951 through 1957. His productions usually had a sidekick (a companion), usually either Pat Brady, (who drove a Jeep called \"Nellybelle\") or Andy Devine, or the crotchety (irritating) George \"Gabby\" Hayes. Rogers's nickname was \"King of the Cowboys\". Evans's nickname was \"Queen of the West.\"\nAbout Roy Roger's life.\nEarly life.\nLeonard Franklin Slye was born in Cincinnati, Ohio in USA. His parents' name was Andrew and Mattie Syle. His family lived in a tenement building (apartment on rent) on 2nd Street. (Riverfront Stadium was built at this place in 1970 and Leonard joked that he had been born at second base.) His father, Andrew Syle was not happy with his job and city life. So,Andy Slye and his brother Will built a 12-by-50-foot houseboat from salvage lumber. Then, in July 1912, the Slye family floated on the Ohio River towards Portsmouth, Ohio. The Syles family wanted a more stable life in Portsmouth. So, they bought land on which they could built a home.\nBut, because of the flood of 1913, they were able to move their houseboat to the land. So, they continued living in the houseboat on dry land.\nIn 1919, the Slyes bought a farm in Duck Run, located near Lucasville, Ohio which is 12 miles north of Portsmouth. There they built a six-room home. But the farm alone could not give a good income for his family, so Leorand's father, Andrew took a job at a shoe factory in Portsmouth. He lived there during the week and came back home on the weekends. He used to bring gifts for his family after paydays (the day payment is given). One important gift was a horse on which Leonard learned how to ride a horse.\nAfter Leonard completed his eight grade, he studied at High School in McDermott, Ohio. When he was 17, his family returned to Cincinnati. In Cincinnati, his father started work at another shoe factory. Leonard also wanted to help his family to earn more money. So, he left high school. He started to work with his father at the shoe factory and went to night school. \nLeonard was made laughed at (made fun of) for sleeping in class. So, he left the night school and never joined again.\nLeonard and his father did not like their factory jobs. In 1929, his older sister, Mary, went to Lawndale, California with her husband. Leonard and his father left their shoe factory jobs. The family lived with Mary for four months and then cam back to Ohio. Soon, Leonard got to go to California with Mary's husband's father. Rest of the family came to California in the spring of 1930.\nThe Slyes took a small house on rent near Mary. Leonard and his father very soon found jobs as truck drivers for a highway making project. But, when they came to work they got to know that their employer (person who gives job) had become bankrupt (did not have enough money). Soon, came the years of Great Depression. The Slyes were now moving from job to job collecting fruit and living in worker camps. One day, Andrew Slye got to know about a shoe factory giving jobs in Los Angeles. Andrew asked Leonard to join him. Leonard used to feel happy playing guitar and singing around campfires. So, he told his father that he wanted to earn money through music. His father allowed him to do so. Leonard and his cousin Stanley Slye went to Los Angeles and started to perform as The Slye Brothers.\nLeonard now came to be known as \"Len\". In 1932, he met Lucille Ascolese while on tour. The same year, a palomino colt (a breed of horse) was born in Santa Cietro, CA. The young horse was first named \"Golden Cloud\", and later renamed \"Trigger\". In May 1933, Len, 21, proposed to Lucille, 19, through radio. Len then went on tour with the \"O-Bar-O Cowboys\". In June 1933, Len met Grace Arline Wilkins at a radio station in New Mexico. She gave Len a lemon pie in return of his singing \"Swiss Yodel\" on the radio. By August 1934, Len and Lucille had separated as she was jealous and tired of being a musician's wife. Len and Lucille's divorced on June 8, 1936. Len and Grace Arline Wilkins married in Roswell, New Mexico, on June 11, 1936.\nIn 1941, Len and his wife, Grace adopted a girl, Cheryl Darlene. In 1942, they legally changed their names to Roy and Grace Arline Rogers. The next year, Arline gave birth to a daughter, Linda Lou. "}

It is often known as the Last Judgment, Final Judgment, Judgment Day, Doomsday, or sometimes it is called The Day of the Lord.\nBeliefs of the early Christians.\nIn the Torah the prophets had said that one day God would send His son to forgive people for the wrong things they had done and to save their souls. In the early years of the Christian church people thought that, although Jesus Christ had now visited the world and died for us on the cross, salvation will only be completed when the world ends and all people alive or dead will face God who will judge them.\nReferences to the Day of Judgment in the Bible.\nThe Day of the Lord is mentioned several times in the Old Testament (e.g. Book of Ezekiel chapter 13 v.5 and Isaiah chapter 2 v.12). In the New Testament the coming of Christ as Judge of the world is mentioned very often. In Paul\u2019s letters and in the Revelation to John, then Christians who are saved by their faith in Jesus will reign with Christ. When Christ comes, His arrival will be announced by a trumpet call. He will come down from heaven. All the people who are alive will stay alive, and all the people who are dead will become alive again.\nChrist\u2019s Second Coming is talked about in the ancient creeds.

In the Nicene Creed it says: \u201cHe will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead\u201d.\nThe Day of Judgment in art.\nThis belief about the Day of Judgment has inspired many painters throughout the ages to draw or paint the Second Coming of Christ. One of the most famous is Michelangelo\u2019s painting on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome."}

In 1966 architect Hanns Wiser made the first sketch of the new venue with 15 000 seats and two roofed stands. In 1967 the City decided to build the new stadium in Lehen and to make places for 18 000 spectators. The space for the new venue was also before a football groundTogether with Jakob Adlhart Wiser made a new plan and the stadium was built between 1969 and 1971. Because money was short, the east stand was designed as standingroom so the capacity could be 18 000 although the building was cheaper. The floodlight was opened in 1974 because neighbours took legal action against it.\nThe stadium was opend with a friendly match between SV Asutria Salzburg and the national team of Tunesia. In mid-1990s the stadium was to small because Austria Salzburg played international matches and the UEFA licensed it for only 5 300 spectators. So Austria Salzburg played the international matches in Viennas Ernst Happel Stadion. It was planed to expand the stadium but the city of Salzburg decided to build a new stadium in Wals-Siezenheim because the city needed a venue for the UEFA Euro 2008. The last match was held on 4 December 2002 versus SK Sturm Graz.\nThe stadium was demolished in 2006. One part of the former stadium is now used by Salzburgs Citylibrary and a housing project is planed.\nNotable matches.\nIn the stadium 9 matches of the Austrian nationalteam were held. The most memorable was the 9:0 versus Malta on 30 April 1977 (Qualification for the FIFA World Cup 1978) where the young Hans Krankl scored 6 goals. But Austria Salzburg played notable matches in the venue for example the 3:0 victory over Sporting Lissabon in the 1993/94 UEFA Cup and in the second round of the UEFA Cup 1976 versus Roter Stern Belgrad."}

{"id": "298018", "revid": "440431", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=298018", "title": "Passion play", "text": "A Passion play is a religious drama of medieval origin dealing with the suffering, death, and Resurrection of Christ. Early Passion plays (in Latin) consisted of readings from the Gospel with interpolated poetical sections on the events of Christ\u2019s Passion and related subjects, such as Mary Magdalene\u2019s life and repentance, the raising of Lazarus, the Last Supper, and the lament of the Virgin Mary. Use of the vernacular in these interpolations led to the development of independent vernacular plays, the earliest surviving examples being in German. Such plays were at first only preludes to dramatic presentations of the Resurrection. The introduction of Satan (which became typical of German and Czech plays), and thus of introductory representations of the fall of Lucifer and the Fall of man (as in the early 14th-century Vienna Passion), and of scenes from the Old Testament and of the Last Judgment, led to development of cyclic plays similar to the Corpus Christi cycles. The great Celtic Passion cycles of Cornwall and Brittany, and the St. Gall Passion play (which begins with the entry of St. Augustine, who introduces the Old Testament prophets and patriarchs, and also includes the marriage at Cana), exemplify this type of Passion play.\nThe Tirol plays early formed a separate group, representing only scenes from the Passion and Resurrection. The Bohemian plays, such as the St. Eger Passion, developed from a simpler version of the Vienna Passion, were also distinct in style and incident.\nThe earliest Passion plays of France and Flanders are thought to have their source in a nondramatic narrative poem of the 13th century, the Passion des jongleurs. These plays became highly elaborated in the course of their development, culminating in performances (Mons, 1501; Valenciennes, 1547) lasting more than a week. Confraternities were founded for performance of Passion plays, the most famous being the Confr\u00e9rie de la Passion (1402). Passion plays were also performed in Spain, Italy, and elsewhere, with local variations.\nBy the 16th century, many of the Passion plays, debased by secular influences, had degenerated into mere popular entertainments, full of crude slapstick and buffoonery. Many were forbidden by ecclesiastical authorities, and many more were suppressed after the Reformation.\nThe most famous of the Passion plays to survive into the 20th century is that performed at Oberammergau, in the Bavarian Alps. According to tradition, the play has been presented every 10 years since 1634, in fulfillment of a vow made after the village was spared an epidemic of plague (shifting to decennial years in 1700), except in 1870 during the Franco-Prussian War and World War II, when religious plays were banned. It remains an entirely local production, with villagers taking all the parts and singing in the chorus. Since 1930 roofed seats have protected the audience from the weather. The production runs from May through September. Some villagers and some Jewish organizations have protested anti-Semitic overtones in the 1860 text. Traditional Passion plays have also been revived in villages in the Austrian Tirol. In northern Spain, during Lent and Holy Week, a Catalan Passion play is performed by villagers; and in Tegelen, in the Netherlands, a modern play by the Dutch poet Jacques Scheurs is given every five years."}

The behaviours ranged from excitement to apathy, depending on the position of the stimulation. He could induce different types of responses in the anterior (lateral) hypothalamus compared to stimulating the posterior ventromedial hypothalamus. When stimulating the anterior part, he could induce fall of blood pressure, slowing of breathing and responses such as wanting food, wanting water, needing to pee and needing to poop. On the other hand, stimulation of the posterior part led to extreme excitement and defensive behaviour.\nHess also found that he could induce sleep in cats \u2013 a finding that was highly controversial at the time but later confirmed.

Electromagnetic induction creates energy in the source by causing ions to circulate. Movement of the ions generates energy in the form of heat.\nOperation.\nInductively coupled plasma sources usually use argon as a fuel. Unfortunately, most ICP sources require at least 5 L/min of argon. This makes inductively coupled plasma a rather expensive source. The argon atoms are ionized with a spark from tesla coil. These ions will circulate due to the magnetic field to produce heat and high temperatures. This will cause additional ions to be formed from the argon fuel. After a period of time, the torch will reach temperatures between 6 000 and 10 000 Kelvin.\nApplications.\nThe high temperatures produced by ICP make it a popular source for many scientific experiments. This source had the advantage of providing strong signals and only small amounts of noise or interference. Also, the data obtained from experiments using an inductively coupled plasma source is often linear. This makes it easy for scientists to determine the amount of something in a sample. Some of the most common applications are \nICP-AES.\nInductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy is one of the most common applications of ICP. The plasma source is used to heat a sample. At high enough temperatures, electrons in the sample atoms will gain enough energy to move into an excited state. Energy is released in the form of photons when electrons \"fall\" from the excited state to a lower energy. The lower energy state is usually called the ground state of an atom.\nThe wavelength of the emissions are determined by a detector. Most atoms will emit light at different wavelengths so scientists may use this information to identify atoms in a sample. The intensity of emission is related to the amount of an atom in the sample. Scientist may use the wavelength and intensity to determine both the identity and amount of an atom. ICP-AES is often used for the detection of toxins, such as heavy metals. It may also be used for chemical studies.\nDetection.\nInductively coupled plasma source may be used for the detection of approximately 60 different elements. These include most alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, metalloids, all transition metals, and some f-block elements."}

He used phylogenetic taxonomy of 16S ribosomal RNA, a technique pioneered by him which is now standard practice.\nHe was also the originator of the RNA world hypothesis in 1977, although not by that name. He was the Stanley O. Ikenberry professor of microbiology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\nWork and discoveries.\nAfter defining Archaea as a new domain, Woese redrew the taxonomic tree. His three-domain system is based upon genetic relationships. It divides life into 23 main divisions in three domains: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. Archaea are neither bacteria nor eukaryotes. Looked at another way, they are prokaryotes that are not bacteria.\nThe tree of life shows the diversity of microbes. Single-celled organisms represent the vast majority of the biosphere's diversity. This is surprising to some, given our familiarity with the larger metazoan world. Microbes are responsible for many biochemical cycles and are crucial to the whole biosphere. Woese's efforts to clarify the evolution and diversity of microbes was an invaluable service to ecology, conservation and evolutionary biology.\nPersonal life.\nWoese was born on July 15, 1928 in Syracuse, New York.

{"id": "298185", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=298185", "title": "Michael Todd", "text": "Michael Todd (June 22, 1909 \u2013 March 22, 1958), also known as Mike Todd, was an American theatre and movie producer. He is known for making movies, starting the movie formats of Cinerama and Todd-AO, and his 1957 marriage to actress Elizabeth Taylor (1930-2011). Todd's 1956 production of \"Around the World in Eighty Days\" won an Academy Award for Best Picture. Todd is also well known as the third of Elizabeth Taylor's seven husbands.\nPersonal life.\nTodd was born Avrom Hirsch Goldbogen in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to Chaim Goldbogen (an Orthodox rabbi) and Sophia Hellerman, both Polish Jewish immigrants. He was one of nine children in a poor family, the youngest son, and his siblings nicknamed him \"Toat\" to mimic his difficulty saying the word \"coat\". It was from this nickname that his name \"Todd\" was derived (said in Germanic/Yiddish as \"Tote\").\nThe family later moved to Chicago, arriving on the day World War I ended. Todd was expelled in the sixth grade for running a game of craps inside the school. In high school, he produced the school play, \"The Mikado\", which was considered a hit. He eventually dropped out of high school and worked at a variety of jobs, including shoe salesman and store window decorator. One of his first jobs was as a soda jerk at a drugstore. When that drugstore went out of business, Todd had learned enough medical knowledge from his work there to be hired at Chicago's Michael Reese Hospital, as a type of \"security guard\" to stop visitors from bringing in food that was not on each patient's diet.\nAt age 17, Todd married Bertha Freshman in Crown Point, Indiana, on Valentine's Day 1927. He had been serious about Bertha since age 14, but needed to develop confidence before even asking her out. In 1929, she bore him a son, Michael Todd, Jr. A turning point came for Todd when his father died in 1931; Avrom Goldbogen made the decision to change his name to \"Michael Todd\" on the same day. Bertha Todd died of a pneumothorax (collapsed lung) in 1946 in Santa Monica, California, while undergoing surgery at St. John's Hospital, for a damaged tendon in her finger. Todd and his wife were separated at the time of her death; less than a week before, he had filed for divorce. The following year, Todd married actress Joan Blondell on July 5, 1947. They were divorced on June 8, 1950, after she alleged that he had abused and extorted her. Todd's third marriage was to the actress Elizabeth Taylor, with whom he had a tempestuous relationship. The couple exchanged vows on February 2, 1957. Todd was 47 and Taylor was 24; he was her third husband. Todd and Taylor had a daughter, Elizabeth Frances (Liza) Todd, who was born on August 7, 1957.\nOn 22 March 1958, Todd's private plane \"Lucky Liz\" crashed near Grants, New Mexico. The plane, a twin-engine Lockheed Lodestar, suffered an engine failure while being flown overloaded in icing conditions. The plane was flying at an altitude which was too high to sustain flight with only one working engine under those conditions. The plane went out of control and crashed, killing all 4 people on board. In addition to Todd, those who died in the crash were screenwriter and author Art Cohn, who was writing Todd's biography \"The Nine Lives of Mike Todd\"; pilot Bill Verner; and co-pilot Tom Barclay. Taylor wanted to fly to New York with her husband, but stayed home with a cold after her pleas to come along were overruled by Todd. Just hours before the crash, Todd described the plane as safe as he phoned friends, including Joseph Mankiewicz and Kirk Douglas, in an attempt to recruit a gin rummy player for the flight: \"Ah, c'mon,\" he said. \"It's a good, safe plane. I wouldn't let it crash. I'm taking along a picture of Elizabeth, and I wouldn't let anything happen to her.\"\nHis son, Mike Jr., wanted his father's body to be cremated after it was identified through dental records and brought to Albuquerque, New Mexico, but Taylor refused, saying he would not want cremation. Todd was buried in Forest Park, Illinois, at Beth Aaron Cemetery in plot 66, which is part of Jewish Waldheim there. In his autobiography, Eddie Fisher, who considered himself to be Todd's best friend, stated:\nThe remains were desecrated by thieves, who broke into Todd's coffin looking for a $100,000 diamond ring, which, according to rumor, Taylor had placed on her husband's finger prior to his burial. The bag containing Todd's remains was found under a tree near his burial plot; the bag and coffin had been sealed in Albuquerque after Todd's remains were identified following the 1958 crash. Todd's remains were once more identified through dental records and were reburied in a secret location.\nWork.\nTodd began his career in the construction business, where he made a fortune but later lost it. He opened the so-called College of Bricklaying of America, buying the materials to teach bricklaying on credit. The school was forced to shut its doors when the Bricklayers' Union did not view the college as an accepted place of study. Todd and his brother, Frank, next opened their own construction company. Their company was worth over a million dollars but came to an abrupt halt when its financial backing failed in the wake of the Great Depression. Not yet twenty-one, Todd had lost over a million dollars with the loss of his backer. He was now the father of an infant son and had no home for his family.\nHe later served as a contractor to Hollywood studios, and during the 1933-1934 Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago, he produced an attraction called the \"Flame Dance.\" In this number, gas jets were designed to burn part of a dancer's costume off, leaving her naked in appearance. The act attracted enough attention to bring an offer from the Casino de Paris club in New York City. Todd got his first taste of Broadway life with that engagement and was determined to find a way to work there. He came up with the idea of producing the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta \"The Mikado\" with an all-African-American cast. \"The Hot Mikado\", starring Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson, opened on Broadway March 23, 1939. His Broadway success gave him the nerve to try taking on showman Billy Rose. Todd visited Grover Whalen, president of the 1939 New York World's Fair, with a proposal to bring the Broadway show to the World's Fair. Whelan, eager to have the show at the fair, covered Todd's Broadway early closing costs. Rose, who had an exclusivity clause in his fair contract, met Todd at Lindy's, where Rose learned his contract covered new forms of entertainment only. Todd's \"Mikado\" dated back to 1885. To avoid any head-to head competition, Rose quickly agreed to promote Todd's production along with his own. Todd went on to produce 30 Broadway shows during his career.\nTodd's business career was volatile, and failed ventures left him bankrupt many times.\nIn 1945, Todd suggested the idea of holding the Major League Baseball All-Star Game in newly-liberated Berlin (Germany). Although baseball's new commissioner Happy Chandler was reportedly \"intrigued\" by the idea, it was ultimately dismissed as impractical. The game was finally cancelled due to wartime travel restrictions.\nIn 1952, Todd made a production of the Johann Strauss II operetta, \"A Night In Venice\", complete with floating gondolas at the then-newly constructed Jones Beach Theatre in Long Island, New York. It ran for two seasons.\nIn 1950, Mike Todd formed The Cinerama Company with the broadcaster Lowell Thomas (who founded Capital Cities Communications) and the inventor Fred Waller. The company was created to exploit Cinerama, a movie process created by Waller that used three movie projectors to create a giant composite image on a curved screen. The first Cinerama feature, \"This is Cinerama\", was released in September 1952.\nBefore its release, Todd left the Cinerama Company to develop a widescreen process which would eliminate some of Cinerama's flaws. The result was the Todd-AO process, designed by the American Optical Company. The process was first used commercially for the successful 1955 movie adaptation of \"Oklahoma!\" (starring Gordon MacRae and Shirley Jones). Todd later produced the movie for which he is best remembered, \"Michael Todd's Around the World in 80 Days\", which debuted in cinemas on October 17, 1956.

It is now in the Derby Museum and Art Gallery. This is a precise sundial which tells not only local apparent time but also local mean time using a scale on it. It is accurate to the nearest minute.\nManufacturer.\nThe Whitehurst family was known in Derby as skillful mechanics. John Whitehurst (1713\u20131788) was born in Congleton, but came to Derby where he became a watch and clock maker. He moved to London to assume the post of Inspector of Weights. His nephew continued the business under the name of Whitehurst &amp; Son. The family business was known for their turret clocks.\nConstruction.\nTo construct a sundial, one must understand the geometry of the solar system, and particularly how the sun will cast a shadow onto a flat surface, in this case a horizontal surface. Each day over a yearly cycle the shadow will be different from the day before, and the shadow is specific to the location of the dial, particularly its latitude. The dial is designed to tell local apparent time so the longitude is not important. In this case, noon will be at the point when the sun is highest in sky and due south, and standard time would be when the sun was due south at another point such as the Royal Observatory at Greenwich. Derby is at 1\u00b0 28\u2032 46.2\u2033 West of Greenwich, so the sun is approximately 5 mins and 52.05 s later in reaching noon. And also when telling the time, we must consider the equation of time. That is to say, as the earth moves around the sun in a slight ellipse, day length slightly varies everyday. For example, the difference from the average becomes up to 16\u00a0minutes in November and February. This equation of time had been really unknown for a long time until people started comparing sundials with mechanical clocks. If a clock ignores this difference, it measures average time. If a clock is re balanced each day to make them correspond with the natural cycle, it measures local mean time. A fixed noon and fixed day are essential for railways timetabling, so Greenwich Mean Time was adopted. In the case of Midland Railway, it was by January 1848.\nThis particular bronze sundial is marked \"Whitehurst and Son/Derby/1812\" and is thought to have been made for George Benson Strutt (who was the younger brother of the cotton spinner William Strutt), for his home Bridge Hill House, in Belper. This has the precise location of 53\u00b0 1\u2032 49.08\u2033 north, and 1\u00b0 29\u2032 26.88\u2033 West of Greenwich, which is slightly different from those of Derby, at 52\u00b0 55\u2032 00\u2033 north, a difference of 6\u2032 49\u2033. The Longitude is almost same, and gives only a 2 second time difference.\nThe Gnomon.\nThe dial is stoutly made and has one thick style (gnomon, a stick which casts shadow on the plate). The dial plate is not one complete circle but two semicircles separated by the thickness of the style. In this design of sundial, the angle of the style to the dial plate is exactly the same as latitude, which is 53\u00b0 1\u2032 49\u2033 (the latitude of the Bridge Hill House). \nThe dial plate will be perfectly horizontal there. In case it is placed at different location, slight adjustment for latitude is required by slanting the dial plate. As the dial is now 0\u00b0 6\u2032 49\u2033, or about 1/10th of a degree south- the nose of the gnomon needs to be raised by that amount.\nThe dial plate.\nIn the \"horizontal sundial\" (also called a \"garden sundial\"), the plane that receives the shadow is aligned horizontally. (In the equatorial dial, the style stands vertically against the plate.) Hence, the line of shadow does not rotate uniformly on the dial face. Consequently, the hour lines are spaced according to a calculation.\nThe dial plate is strictly engraved with hour lines which were calculated using the formula:\nwhere \u03bb is the sundial's geographical latitude (and the angle the style makes with horizontal), \u03b8 is the angle between a given hour-line and the noon hour-line (which always points towards true North) on the plane, and \"t\" is the number of hours before or after noon.\nThe Maths.\nFor each of the hours 1 to 6, the formula is calculated. For instance at 3 hours after noon, we substitute the numbers 53.03 and 3 into the formula\nThis generates these results\nThe hours before noon are exactly the same, because the dial is symmetrical, so the other lines are mirror images of those above.\nIn the same manner, the half hours and the minute lines would be calculated. As noon is set exactly on the north-south line, and not 5' and 54\" (time difference between Belper and Greenwich) to one side, we can tell that this dial is telling Belper time and not Greenwich time.\nEquation of Time.\nSignificantly, on the plate we can see a pair of scales that help the observer make the equation of time correction. One scale gives the date in months and days. Along side of it, another scale is engraved with the minutes on that day that the watch would be running faster or slower. Here it is labeled \"Watch Slower, Watch Faster. The 15th April is one day when no conversion needs to be made. This dial can be used both to read solar time shown by sundials and also the mean time that is favoured by clocks, with the practical purpose that observers can use the dial to calibrate their pocket watches, which in 1812 would not always run true. By 1820 watches manufacture had improved and the Lever escapement had become popular, so frequent calibration was no longer needed.\nOther Commissions.\nAnother Whitehurst sundial dated around 1800 sold for \u00a31850 in 2005 in Derby."}

In the latter years of his life, Gould also taught biology and evolution at New York University near his home in SoHo.\nGould's greatest contribution to science was the theory of punctuated equilibrium, which he developed with Niles Eldredge in 1972. The theory proposes that most evolution is marked by long periods of evolutionary stability, which is punctuated by rare instances of branching evolution. The theory was contrasted against the idea that evolutionary change is marked by a pattern of smooth and continuous change in the fossil record.\nMost of Gould's empirical research was based on the snail genera \"Poecilozonites\" and \"Cerion\". He also contributed to evolutionary developmental biology, and has received wide praise for his book \"Ontogeny and Phylogeny\". In evolutionary theory he opposed strict selectionism, sociobiology as applied to humans, and evolutionary psychology. He campaigned against creationism.\nMany of Gould's \"Natural History\" essays were reprinted in collected volumes."}

Its answer is that \"Parents matter less than you think and peers matter more\".\nEducation.\nHarris graduated from Tucson High School and attended the University of Arizona and Brandeis University, from where she graduated magna cum laude in 1959. In 1961 she received a master's degree in psychology from Harvard University.\nThe Nurture Assumption.\nHarris's most famous work is \"The Nurture Assumption\". It was published in 1998. A revised version was published in 2009. Children often act like their parents act. Some psychologists thought this was because of the way that parents raised their children. Harris argues that (some or all of) this similarity is due to genetics. Otherwise, parents are not the most important factor in child development. This book argues that peers are more important. Harris argues that children are socialized by peers.\nNo Two Alike.\nHarris also wrote \"No Two Alike: Human Nature and Human Individuality\". It was published in February 2006. Harris attempts to explain why people are so different in personality, even identical twins who grow up in the same home.\nOpinions of her work.\nGeorge A. Miller was chair of the Department of Psychology which formally dismissed Harris from the PhD program at Harvard, 1960, on the grounds that her 'originality and independence' did not live up to Harvard's standards.\nLater, in 1994, she developed a theory of child development, which focussed on the peer group rather than the family.

Although the theft from the Magazine Fort building in Phoenix Park was successful, most of what was stolen was recovered by the Irish Army a few days later. Several IRA volunteers were arrested.\nReasons for raid.\nThe reason for the raid was that the IRA had many Thompson submachine guns. They found it hard to get the .45 ACP bullets used in these guns in Europe. Because the Irish Army also used the Thompson and had large supplies of bullets, the IRA decided to steal some.\nThe raid.\nAround 2030 the gate bell rang, and the Military Police officer on guard opened the gate a little for a civilian who said he had a parcel to deliver to the officer-in-charge. The unidentified man told the MP to open the gate fully and put his hands up. At this point the IRA team appeared from both inside and outside the fort, confiscating the weapons of the sentry and MP.\nThe two hostages were then forced to act as human shields for the two intruders to the guardroom where the remaining soldiers were caught by surprise and gave up without a fight. The captives heard 'many' heavy lorries coming and going from the depot. At 2210 hrs the IRA locked the prisoners in the so-called 'C' Magazine area which the raiders had completely emptied.\nIt was 2250 by the time a party of soldiers was sent from Portobello Barracks to find out what was happening at the fort. They managed to catch two of the raiders.\nA total of 1,084,000 rounds of ammunition had been taken and removed in thirteen lorries with no casualties.\nOver the next three to four days a large, nationwide hunt was organised to find the stolen items.\nOn 1 January 1940 it was reported that almost three-quarters of the ammunition had been found, a total of 850,000 rounds; \nIn addition, some IRA volunteers who were caught storing the ammunition were arrested.\nWhat happened after the raid.\nThe raid was not good for the IRA. The massive hunt to find what was stolen turned up all and more. It caused IRA Volunteers to be arrested.\nThe day after the raid the Irish Minister for Justice, Gerald Boland, at an emergency meeting of the D\u00e1il (\"government\") introduced the Emergency Powers bill to allow internment (\"taking prisoner\"), Military Tribunal, and executions for IRA members.

They have lost, or almost lost, their original feature.\nVestigiality is evidence for evolution, since they only make sense if evolution has occurred. They were one of the puzzles of pre-Darwinian natural history. The puzzle vanished once biologists realised they once were working adaptations, in the ancestors of present-day animals.\nThey occur in animals (and plants) which have changed their style of life from their ancestors. Thus snakes lost their legs as their system of movement changed. But one type of snake \u2013 the boas \u2013 have vestigial rear legs and pelvis. The human vermiform appendix is another example. That was much larger, and stored microbes which produced cellulase to break down plant cell walls. Leaves are the main diet of apes, but they are not a main part of man's diet. Cellulose cannot be digested by our species.\nAn unused organ usually degenerates, and becomes smaller or vanishes altogether. Thus amphibia living in dark caves lose their sight and their body colour. Mutations pile up. All structures need energy for their development, maintenance, and weight. This, and the risk of disease in the part (e.g., infection, cancer), provide some selection for the removal of parts which no longer help an organism's fitness.\nThe human appendix had selection against it because of deaths from appendicitis. Appendicitis was untreatable until modern times. The selection pressure was probably weak, because most cases occur after the age of peak fertility.\nObservations on the cave-dwelling amphipod \"Gammarus minus\" showed active selection against their vestigial eyes. When mating, the males remain on their females for a week or so after fertilisation, guarding them against other males. The eye sizes of paired males were compared with those of unpaired males. The eye sizes of paired males were smaller than the unpaired ones. Obviously, on average, the paired males would have higher fertility than the unpaired males. The selection gradient was estimated as \u20130.30, which means the selection for small eyes was quite strong. The researchers supposed that the loss of sight freed more of the nervous system to process other sensory inputs.p310\nOccasionally, selection turns vestigial organs to a new function. Thus the mammalian ear ossicles were once bones in the jaw of early proto-mammals, the Therapsida. The halteres of flies is a perfect example. The word exaptation was coined for this phenomenon.\nFitness.\nAll functions and structures develop and change because they affect the biological fitness of the organism. They make it more or less likely that individuals reproduce and contribute genes to the next generation. So, for example, an ability of a frog to survive the bite of its local venomous snake increases its fitness. But if it lives in an area where the snake does not, then it reduces its fitness. This is because it bears the \"cost\" of a complicated mechanism without getting any advantage in survival and reproduction. It works the other way round, too. Snakes which eat toxic prey have to use ways to survive the prey's toxins. The snake's digestion and metabolism is slower, and they move around more slowly. See rough-skinned newt and garter snake.\nEverything has a cost: either it uses up energy or its structure occupies space that might be used differently."}

It is too hard and brittle for meaningful use. The carbon must first be burned off the iron to produce steel. This process is called \"conversion\" and the reactor a \"converter\".\nThe first converter was invented by Sir Henry Bessemer in 1856. He built a pear-shaped large vessel with nozzles (tuyeres) for air in the bottom. Hot molten pig iron from blast furnace was poured in the converter, and then air was pumped in at the bottom with high pressure. The result was a loud noise and a flame of up to 20 metres off the mouth of the converter. After ten minutes all the pig iron had become steel. The Bessemer converter was the first successful reactor on converting pig iron into steel, and the era of steel began. Steel was now plentiful and cheap.\nHowever, steel becomes better if only oxygen is blown in. Air contains nitrogen, which is harmful for some steel grades. A modern converter called basic oxygen furnace uses pure oxygen instead of air. It was invented 1949 in Austria.\nThe modern basic oxygen converter is a large pumpkin-shape vessel which is made from steel and lined with refractories such as calcium oxide and magnesium oxide line so the vessel can withstand the high temperature of molten metal. \nMolten pig iron and scrap are loaded in the converter. The scrap usually is rusty and contains oxygen, so some of the rust reacts with the pig iron, burning the carbon away and creating heat which melts the scrap. Once all scrap has melted, a special pipe called \"oxygen lance\" is lowered in the pig iron, and a very fast and sharp blow of oxygen is blasted in. The oxygen burns all the carbon away and mixes the liquid steel thoroughly. Once all carbon has been burned away, some extra carbon is inserted to raise the contents to desired level. The result is liquid steel, which is then tapped away and taken to rolling mill to produce steel products."}

{"id": "298688", "revid": "212856", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=298688", "title": "Tuning fork", "text": "A tuning fork is a sound resonator which is a two-pronged fork. The prongs, called tines, are made from a U-shaped bar of metal (usually steel). This bar of metal can move freely. It resonates at a specific constant pitch when set vibrating by striking it against an object. It sounds a pure musical tone after waiting a moment to allow some high overtone sounds to die out. The pitch depends on the length of the two prongs. Its main use is as a standard of pitch to tune other musical instruments, and in some tests of hearing.\nDescription.\nThe tuning fork was invented in 1711 by British musician John Shore. He was the Sergeant Trumpeter to the court, who had musical parts written for him by the composers George Frideric Handel and Henry Purcell.\nThe fork shape produces a very pure tone. Most of the vibrational energy is at the fundamental frequency, with very few overtones (harmonics). This is not the case with other resonators. The reason for this is that the frequency of the first overtone is about 52/22 = 25/4 = 6\u00bc times the fundamental (about 2\u00bd octaves above it). By comparison, the first overtone of a vibrating string is only one octave above the fundamental. So when the fork is struck, little of the energy goes into the overtone modes; they also die out correspondingly faster, leaving the fundamental. It is easier to tune other instruments with this pure tone, when listening to compare with the tone of each other instrument.\nAnother reason for using the fork shape is that, when it vibrates in its principal mode, the handle vibrates up and down as the prongs move apart and together. There is a node (point of no vibration) at the base of each prong. The handle motion is small, allowing the fork to be held by the handle without damping the vibration, but it allows the handle to transmit the vibration to a resonator (like the hollow rectangular box often used), which amplifies the sound of the fork. Without the resonator (which may be as simple as a table top to which the handle is pressed), the sound is very faint. The reason for this is that the sound waves produced by each fork prong are 180\u00b0 out of phase with the other, so at a distance from the fork they interfere and largely cancel each other out. If a sound absorbing sheet is slid in between the prongs of a vibrating fork, reducing the waves reaching the ear from one prong, the volume heard will actually increase, due to a reduction of this cancellation.\nCommercial tuning forks are normally tuned to the correct pitch at the factory, but they can be retuned by filing material off the prongs. Filing the ends of the prongs raises the pitch, while filing the inside of the base of the prongs lowers it.\nThe most common tuning fork sounds the note of A = 440 Hz. This is the standard concert pitch, used as tuning note by some orchestras. It is the pitch of the violin's second string, the first string of the viola, and an octave above the first string of the cello, all played open. Tuning forks used by orchestras between 1750 and 1820 mostly had a frequency of A = 423.5\u00a0Hz, although there were many forks and many slightly different pitches. Standard tuning forks are available for all the musical pitches within the central octave of the piano, and other pitches. Well-known manufacturers of tuning forks include Ragg and John Walker, both of Sheffield, England.\nCalculation of frequency.\nThe frequency of a tuning fork depends on its dimensions and the material from which is made:\nWhere:\nUses.\nForks have traditionally been used to tune musical instruments, although electronic tuners are replacing them in many applications. Tuning forks can be driven electrically, by placing electromagnets close to the prongs that are attached to an electronic oscillator circuit, so that their sound does not die out.\nIn musical instruments.\nA number of keyboard musical instruments using constructions similar to tuning forks have been made, the most popular of them being the Rhodes piano, which has hammers hitting constructions working on the same principle as tuning forks.\nIn watches.\nThe Accutron, an electromechanical watch developed by Max Hetzel and manufactured by Bulova beginning in 1960, used a 360-hertz steel tuning fork powered by a battery as its timekeeping element. The fork allowed it to achieve greater accuracy than conventional balance-wheel watches. The humming sound of the tuning fork could be heard when the watch was held to the ear.\nMedical uses.\nTuning forks, usually C-512, are used by doctors to check a patient's hearing. Lower-pitched ones (usually C-128) are also used to check vibration sense as part of the examination of the peripheral nervous system.\nTuning forks are also used in alternative medicine, such as sonopuncture and polarity therapy.\nMedical Tuning Fork 128 Hz\nRadar gun calibration.\nA radar gun, used to measure the speed of cars or balls in sports, is usually calibrated with tuning forks.\nInstead of the frequency, these forks are labeled with the calibration speed and radar band (e.g. X-Band or K-Band) for which they are calibrated.\nIn gyroscopes.\nDoubled and H-type of tuning forks are used for tactical-grade Vibrating Structure Gyroscopes, like QuapasonTM and different types of MEMS."}

It was built in an island on the River Derwent in Derby. John Lombe visited Piedmont in 1717 and studied details of the Italian silk throwing machines- the \"filatoio\", and the \"torcitoio\". Then, he returned to England with some Italian craftsmen, and built the mill. George Sorocold designed the building.\nLocation.\nLombe's Mill was built next to Thomas Cotchett's 1704 mill on the west bank of the River Derwent in Derby. At this point a weir had been constructed across the river and the mill was built on an island downstream, which separated the river from the tail race of three corn mills. Derby was an important place, because the river had a fast flow and A6 road (from London to Carlisle) crossed the river here.\nHistory.\nThis mill is significant as it was the first successful silk throwing mill in England, and probably the first fully mechanized factory in the world. \nThomas Cotchett built the first mill in Derby in 1704, but it was unsuccessful. So John Lombe visited Piedmont in 1716 to see the successful silk throwing mill there. This was an early example of industrial spying. He returned to Derby with the knowledge and a group of Italians. He and his half brother Thomas Lombe (born 1685) instructed George Sorocold to build a mill to his design and fitted it with the new machines. It was built to the south of Cotchetts Mill. Thomas Lombe was given a 14 year patent to protect the design of the throwing machines he used. This displeased the King of Sardinia, and he stopped exporting suitable raw silk. It is speculated that he was responsible for John Lombes mysterious death six years later in 1722. His elder brother, Thomas Lombe took over the business. When the patents lost effect in 1732, other mills were built in Stockport and Macclesfield. To the north of the powered Italian Works an unpowered Doubling Shop was built- this happened before 1739. The mill was sold in 1739 to Thomas Wilson, and an inventory of this time is still exists.\nThe mill- the Italian Works.\nMost of the building was rebuilt in after years, and little of the original mill remain. It is known from written sources that it was five storeys high rectangular in plan. It was 17m high, 33.5m long, and 12m wide. The roof was slightly sloped. It was built of brick in Flemish bond, on a series of stone arches that allowed the waters of the River Derwent to flow through. The throwing machines were two storeys high, and fastened on the first floor. The winding machines were placed on the top three floors. All the machines were powered by Sorocolds external undershot water wheel. It was 7m in diameter and 2m in width. Its stem entered the mill through a hole at first floor level. It drove a vertical shaft which was 0.45m square. This drove a line shaft (horizontal shaft or lay shaft) that ran the length of the mill. The \"torcitoios\" and \"filatoios\" took their power from this shaft. The vertical shaft was extended to a further vertical shaft that reached the top 3 floors to drive the winding machines. The mill needed to be heated in order to process the silk and this was explained in the 1718 patent. It was reported in 1732 that Lombe used a fire engine (steam engine) to pump hot air round the mill. The stair column was 19.5m high, but its layout is unknown. There is no information on how materials were carried up and down between the floors.\nThe mill- the Doubling Shop.\nThe main range was three storeys high, 42.4m by 5.5m. Each floor was used for doubling- and there were 306 doubling machines.\nThe silk throwing process.\nIn 1700, the Italians were the most technologically advanced in silk throwing in Europe, and they had developed two machines capable of winding the silk onto bobbins while putting a twist in the thread. They called the throwing machine, a \"filatoio\", and the doubler, a \"torcitoio\". There is an illustration (drawn in 1487) of a circular handpowered throwing machine with 32 spindles. The first evidence of a externally powered filatoio comes from the thirteenth century, and the earliest illustration from around 1500. Filatorios and torcitoios contained parallel circular frames that revolved round each other on a central axis. The speed of the relative rotation determined the twist. Silk would only cooperate in the process if the temperature and humidity were high, in Italy the temperature was elevated by sunlight but in Derby the mill had to be heated, and the heat evenly distributed.\nThe Silk Mill today.\nThe mill then passed through several hands and has been rebuilt several times, but the modified structure still exists and has been restored to house the Derby Industrial Museum. A Bas relief sculpture of John Lombe may be found at the nearby Exeter Bridge."}

The town of Wadebridge developed in the parishes of Egloshayle and St Breock. A Vicar of Egloshayle named Thomas Lovibond was responsible for the building of the first bridge across the River Camel to replace a dangerous ford which was begun in 1468 and completed in 1485.\nChurches.\nThe parish church, named after St Petroc, is built almost entirely in the Perpendicular style. It has a Norman font, a stone pulpit dating from the 15th century, and a peal of eight bells. The Anglican chapel at Washaway, dating from 1882, has a font which is one of the earliest in the county.\nForts and houses.\nPencarrow House, seat of the Molesworths (18th century), and Croan House (17th century) are fine examples of smaller country houses.\nKelly Rounds (or Castle Killibury) is an Iron Age fort on the border of the parish and has been associated with the legend of King Arthur."}

They are used in computers. They take two binary numbers and put them together to get a sum. In its most basic form, it uses two XOR gates, two AND gates, and an OR gate. These gates figure out what the numbers being sent in mean and if the digit needs to be turned on or not. \nWhen solving this example: 1001 + 1100 (9 + 12 in decimal form), it would need five single bits to give an answer. The first digits in each number would go to one adder, 1 and 0. It would calculate that 1 + 0 = 1, so that first digit would be 1. The second digits from each are 0 and 0, and 0 + 0 = 0, so the second digit is 0. the third digit from each are 1 and 0, and 1 + 0 = 1, so the third digit is 1. The fourth digit in each are 1 and 1, and 1 + 1 = 10, but because this is a 2 digit number, it holds the first digit (0) and send the second digit to the next adder. The next adder sees 1, and 1 = 1, so the fifth digit is 1. If we take the sum digits in order, they come out as 10101 (21), so 1001 + 1100 = 10101 (9 + 12 = 21)."}

In a scientific setting, this would be the \"total\" number of digits (sometimes called the \"significant figures\" or \"significant digits\") or, less commonly, the number of fractional digits or decimal places (the number of digits following the decimal point). This second definition is useful in financial and engineering applications where the count of digits in the fractional part has particular importance.\nIn both cases, the term \"precision\" can be used to describe the position at which an inexact result will be rounded. For example, in floating point arithmetic, a result is rounded to a given or fixed precision, which is the length of the resulting significand. In financial calculations, a number is often rounded to a given number of places (for example, to two places after the decimal separator for many world currencies).\nAs an example, the decimal quantity 12.345 can be expressed with various numbers of significant digits or decimal places. If insufficient precision is available then the number is rounded in some manner to fit the available precision. The following table shows the results for various total precisions and decimal places rounded to the nearest value using the round-to-even method.\nNote that it is often not appropriate to display a figure with more digits than that which can be measured. For instance, if a device measures to the nearest gram and gives a reading of 12.345\u00a0kg, it would create \"false precision\" if the measurement were expressed \"12.34500\u00a0kg\" with 2 extra zeroes (\"00\") at the end.\nThe representation of a positive number \"x\" to a precision of \"p\" significant digits has a numerical value that is given by the formula\nFor a negative number, the numerical value is minus that of the absolute value.\nThe number 0, to any precision, can be taken to be 0."}

{"id": "298861", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=298861", "title": "Rounding", "text": "The word \"rounding\" for a numerical value means replacing it by another value that is approximately equal but has a shorter, simpler, or more explicit form. For example, US$23.74 could be rounded to US$24, the fraction 312/937 could be rounded to 1/3, and the expression formula_1 could be rounded to 1.41.\nRounding is often done on purpose to obtain a value that is easier to write and handle than the original. It may also be done to indicate the accuracy of a computed number; for example, a quantity that was computed as 123,456, but is known to be accurate only to within a few hundred units, is better stated as \"about 123,500\".\nOn the other hand, rounding can introduce some \"round-off error\" as a result. Rounding is almost unavoidable in many computations, especially when dividing two numbers in integer or doing fixed-point arithmetic; when computing mathematical functions such as square roots, logarithms, and sines; or when using a floating point representation with a fixed number of significant digits. In a sequence of calculations, these rounding errors generally accumulate, and in certain \"ill-conditioned\" cases, they may make the result meaningless.\nAccurate rounding of transcendental mathematical functions is difficult, because the number of extra digits that need to be calculated to resolve whether to round up or down cannot be known in advance. This problem is known as \"the table-maker's dilemma\" (\"below\").\nRounding has many similarities to the quantization that occurs when physical quantities must be encoded by numbers or digital signals.\nTypes of rounding.\nTypical rounding problems can include:\nRounding to a specified increment.\nThe most common type of rounding is to round to an integer; or, more generally, to an integer multiple of some increment\u2014such as rounding to whole tenths of seconds, hundredths of a dollar, to whole multiples of 1/2 or 1/8 inch, to whole dozens or thousands, etc..\nIn general, rounding a number \"x\" to a multiple of some specified increment \"m\" entails the following steps:\nFor example, rounding \"x\" = 2.1784 dollars to whole cents (that is, to a multiple of 0.01) entails computing \"y\" = \"x\"/\"m\" = 2.1784/0.01 = 217.84, then rounding \"y\" to the integer \"q\" = 218, and finally computing \"z\" = \"q\"\u00d7\"m\" = 218\u00d70.01 = 2.18.\nWhen rounding to a predetermined number of significant digits, the increment \"m\" depends on the magnitude of the number to be rounded (or of the rounded result).\nThe increment \"m\" is normally a finite fraction in whatever numeral system that is used to represent the numbers. For display to humans, that usually means the decimal numeral system (that is, \"m\" is an integer times a power of 10, like 1/1000 or 25/100). For intermediate values stored in digital computers, it often means the binary numeral system (\"m\" is an integer times a power of 2).\nThe abstract single-argument \"round()\" function that returns an integer from an arbitrary real value has at least a dozen distinct concrete definitions presented in the rounding to integer section. The abstract two-argument \"round()\" function is formally defined here, but in many cases it is used with the implicit value \"m\" = 1 for the increment and then reduces to the equivalent abstract single-argument function, with also the same dozen distinct concrete definitions.\nRounding to integer.\nThe most basic form of rounding is to replace an arbitrary number by an integer. All the following rounding modes are concrete implementations of the abstract single-argument \"round()\" function presented and used in the previous sections.\nThere are many ways of rounding a number \"y\" to an integer \"q\". The most common ones are\nThe first four methods are called directed rounding, as the displacements from the original number \"y\" to the rounded value \"q\" are all directed towards or away from the same limiting value (0, +\u221e, or \u2212\u221e).\nIf \"y\" is positive, round-down is the same as round-towards-zero, and round-up is the same as round-away-from-zero. If \"y\" is negative, round-down is the same as round-away-from-zero, and round-up is the same as round-towards-zero. In any case, if \"y\" is integer, \"q\" is just \"y\". The following table illustrates these rounding methods:\nWhere many calculations are done in sequence, the choice of rounding method can have a very significant effect on the result. A famous instance involved a new index set up by the Vancouver Stock Exchange in 1982. It was initially set at 1000.000, and after 22 months had fallen to about 520 \u2014 whereas stock prices had generally increased in the period. The problem was caused by the index being recalculated thousands of times daily, and always being rounded down to 3 decimal places, in such a way that the rounding errors accumulated. Recalculating with better rounding gave an index value of 1098.892 at the end of the same period.\nTie-breaking.\nRounding a number \"y\" to the nearest integer requires some tie-breaking rule for those cases when \"y\" is exactly half-way between two integers \u2014 that is, when the fraction part of \"y\" is exactly 0.5.\nRound half up.\nThe following tie-breaking rule, called round half up (or round half towards plus infinity), is widely used in many disciplines. That is, half-way values \"y\" are always rounded up. \nFor example, by this rule the value 23.5 gets rounded to 24, but \u221223.5 gets rounded to \u221223.\nThis is one of two rules generally taught in US elementary mathematics classes.\nIf it were not for the 0.5 fractions, the roundoff errors introduced by the round to nearest method would be quite symmetric: for every fraction that gets rounded up (such as 0.268), there is a complementary fraction (namely, 0.732) that gets rounded down, by the same amount. When rounding a large set of numbers with random fractional parts, these rounding errors would statistically compensate each other, and the expected (average) value of the rounded numbers would be equal to the expected value of the original numbers.\nHowever, the \"round half up\" tie-breaking rule is not symmetric, as the fractions that are exactly 0.5 always get rounded up. This asymmetry introduces a positive bias in the roundoff errors. For example, if the fraction of \"y\" consists of three random decimal digits, then the expected value of \"q\" will be 0.0005 higher than the expected value of \"y\". For this reason, round-to-nearest with the \"round half up\" rule is also (ambiguously) known as asymmetric rounding.\nOne reason for rounding up at 0.5 is that only one digit need be examined. When seeing 17.50000..., for example, the first three figures, 17.5, determines that the figure would be rounded up to 18. If the opposite rule were used (round half down), then all the zero decimal places would need to be examined to determine if the value is exactly 17.5.\nRound half down.\nOne may also use round half down (or round half towards minus infinity) as opposed to the more common \"round half up\" (the \"round half up\" method is a common convention, but is nothing more than a convention).\nFor example, 23.5 gets rounded to 23, and \u221223.5 gets rounded to \u221224.\nThe \"round half down\" tie-breaking rule is not symmetric, as the fractions that are exactly 0.5 always get rounded down. This asymmetry introduces a negative bias in the roundoff errors. For example, if the fraction of \"y\" consists of three random decimal digits, then the expected value of \"q\" will be 0.0005 lower than the expected value of \"y\". For this reason, round-to-nearest with the \"round half down\" rule is also (ambiguously) known as asymmetric rounding.\nRound half away from zero.\nThe other tie-breaking method commonly taught and used is the round half away from zero (or round half towards infinity), namely:\nFor example, 23.5 gets rounded to 24, and \u221223.5 gets rounded to \u221224.\nThis method treats positive and negative values symmetrically, and therefore is free of overall bias if the original numbers are positive or negative with equal probability. However, this rule will still introduce a positive bias for positive numbers, and a negative bias for the negative ones.\nIt is often used for currency conversions and price roundings (when the amount is first converted into the smallest significant subdivision of the currency, such as cents of a euro) as it is easy to explain by just considering the first fractional digit, independently of supplementary precision digits or sign of the amount (for strict equivalence between the paying and recipient of the amount).\nRound half towards zero.\nOne may also round half towards zero (or round half away from infinity) as opposed to the more common \"round half away from zero\" (the \"round half away from zero\" method is a common convention, but is nothing more than a convention).\nFor example, 23.5 gets rounded to 23, and \u221223.5 gets rounded to \u221223.\nThis method also treats positive and negative values symmetrically, and therefore is free of overall bias if the original numbers are positive or negative with equal probability. However, this rule will still introduce a negative bias for positive numbers, and a positive bias for the negative ones.\nRound half to even.\nA tie-breaking rule that is even less biased is round half to even, namely\nThus, for example, +23.5 becomes +24, +22.5 becomes +22, \u221222.5 becomes \u221222, and \u221223.5 becomes \u221224.\nThis method also treats positive and negative values symmetrically, and therefore is free of overall bias if the original numbers are positive or negative with equal probability. In addition, for most reasonable distributions of \"y\" values, the expected (average) value of the rounded numbers is essentially the same as that of the original numbers, even if the latter are all positive (or all negative). However, this rule will still introduce a positive bias for even numbers (including zero), and a negative bias for the odd ones.\nThis variant of the round-to-nearest method is also called unbiased rounding (ambiguously, and a bit abusively), convergent rounding, statistician's rounding, Dutch rounding, Gaussian rounding, or bankers' rounding. This is widely used in bookkeeping.\nThis is the default rounding mode used in IEEE 754 computing functions and operators.\nRound half to odd.\nAnother tie-breaking rule that is very similar to round half to even, namely\nThus, for example, +22.5 becomes +23, +21.5 becomes +21, \u221221.5 becomes \u221221, and \u221222.5 becomes \u221223.\nThis method also treats positive and negative values symmetrically, and therefore is free of overall bias if the original numbers are positive or negative with equal probability. In addition, for most reasonable distributions of \"y\" values, the expected (average) value of the rounded numbers is essentially the same as that of the original numbers, even if the latter are all positive (or all negative). However, this rule will still introduce a negative bias for even numbers (including zero), and a positive bias for the odd ones.\nThis variant is almost never used in most computations, except in situations where one wants to avoid rounding 0.5 or \u22120.5 to zero, or to avoid increasing the scale of numbers represented as floating point (with limited ranges for the scaling exponent), so that a non \"infinite\" number would round to infinite, or that a small \"denormal\" value would round to a normal non-zero value (these could occur with the \"round half to even\" mode). Effectively, this mode prefers preserving the existing scale of tie numbers, avoiding out of range results when possible.\nStochastic rounding.\nAnother unbiased tie-breaking method is stochastic rounding:\nLike round-half-to-even, this rule is essentially free of overall bias; but it is also fair among even and odd \"q\" values. On the other hand, it introduces a random component into the result; performing the same computation twice on the same data may yield two different results. Also, it is open to unconscious bias if humans (rather than computers or devices of chance) are \"randomly\" deciding in which direction to round.\nAlternating tie-breaking.\nOne method, more obscure than most, is round half alternatingly.\nThis suppresses the random component of the result, if occurrences of 0.5 fractional parts can be effectively numbered. But it can still introduce a positive or negative bias according to the direction of rounding assigned to the first occurrence, if the total number of occurrences is odd.\nSimple dithering.\nIn some contexts, all the rounding methods above may be unsatisfactory. For example, suppose that \"y\" is an accurate measurement of an audio signal, which is being rounded to an integer \"q\" in order to reduce the storage or transmission costs. If \"y\" changes slowly with time, any of the rounding method above will result in \"q\" being completely constant for long intervals, separated by sudden jumps of \u00b11. When the \"q\" signal is played back, these steps will be heard as a very disagreeable noise, and any variations of the original signal between two integer values will be completely lost. \nOne way to avoid this problem is to round each value \"y\" upwards with probability equal to its fraction, and round it downwards with the complement of that probability. For example, the number 23.17 would be rounded up to 24 with probability 0.17, and down to 23 with probability 1 - 0.17 = 0.83. (This is equivalent to rounding down \"y\" + \"s\", where \"s\" is a random number uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.) With this special rounding, known as dithering, the sudden steps get replaced by a less objectionable noise, and even small variations in the original signal will be preserved to some extent. Like the stochastic approach to tie-breaking, dithering has no bias: if all fraction values are equally likely, rounding up by a certain amount is as likely as rounding down by that same amount; and the same is true for the sum of several rounded numbers. On the other hand, dithering introduces a random component in the result, much greater than that of stochastic tie-breaking.\nMore precisely, the roundoff error for each dithered number will be a uniformly distributed random variable with mean value of zero, but with a standard deviation formula_12, which is better than the 1/2 standard deviation with the simple predictive methods, but slightly higher than with the simpler stochastic method. However, the sum of \"n\" rounded numbers will be a random variable with expected error zero, but with standard deviation formula_13 (the total remaining noise) which diverges semi-quadratically and may become easily perceptible, even if the standard deviation of the roundoff error per sample will be formula_14 which slowly converges semi-quadratically to zero. So, this random distribution may still be too high for some applications that are rounding a lot of data.\nMultidimensional dithering.\nThis variant of the simple dithering method still rounds values with probability equal to its fraction. However, instead of using a random distribution for rounding isolated samples, the roundoff error occurring at each rounded sample is totalled for the next surrounding elements to sample or compute; this accumulated value is then added to the value of these next sampled or computed values to round, so that the modified values will take into account this difference using a predictive model (such as Floyd\u2013Steinberg dithering).\nThe modified values are then rounded with any one of the above rounding methods, the best ones being with stochastic or dithering methods: in this last case, the sum of \"n\" rounded numbers will still be a random variable with expected error zero but with an excellent constant standard deviation of formula_15, instead of diverging semi-quadratically when dithering isolated samples; and the overall average roundoff error deviation per rounded sample will be formula_16 that will converge hyperbolically to zero, faster than with the semi-hyperbolic convergence when dithering isolated samples.\nIn practice, when rounding large sets of sampled data (such as audio, image and video rendering), the accumulation of roundoff errors is most frequently used with a simple predictive rounding of the modified values (such as rounding towards zero), because it will still preserve the hyperbolic convergence towards zero of the overall mean roundoff error bias and of its standard deviation. This enhancement is frequently used in image and audio processing (notably for accurate rescaling and antialiasing operations, where the simple probabilistic dithering of isolated values may still produce perceptible noise, sometimes even worse than the moir\u00e9 effects occurring with simple non-probabilistic rounding methods applied to isolated samples).\nThe effective propagation of accumulated roundoff errors may depend on the discrete dimension of the sampled data to round: when sampling bidimensional images, including colored images (that add the discrete dimension of color planes), or tridimensional videos (that add a discrete time dimension), or on polyphonic audio data (using time and channel discrete dimensions), it may still be preferable to propagate this error into a preferred direction, or equally into several orthogonal dimensions, such as vertically vs. horizontally for bidimensional images, or into parallel color channels at the same position and/or timestamp, and depending on other properties of these orthogonal discrete dimensions (according to a perception model). In those cases, several roundoff error accumulators may be used (at least one for each discrete dimension), or a (\"n\"-1)-dimension vector (or matrix) of accumulators.\nIn some of these cases, the discrete dimensions of the data to sample and round may be treated non orthogonally: for example, when working with colored images, the trichromatic color planes data in each physical dimension (height, width and optionally time) could be remapped using a perceptive color model, so that the roundoff error accumulators will be designed to preserve lightness with a higher probability than hue or saturation, instead of propagating errors into each orthogonal color plane independently; and in stereophonic audio data the two rounded data channels (left and right) may be rounded together to preserve their mean value in priority to their effective difference that will absorb most of the remaining roundoff errors, in a balanced way around zero.\nRounding to simple fractions.\nIn some contexts it is desirable to round a given number \"x\" to a \"neat\" fraction \u2014 that is, the nearest fraction \"z\" = \"m\"/\"n\"\nwhose numerator \"m\" and denominator \"n\" do not exceed a given maximum. This problem is fairly distinct from that of rounding a value to a fixed number of decimal or binary digits, or to a multiple of a given unit \"m\". This problem is related to Farey sequences, the Stern-Brocot tree, and continued fractions.\nScaled rounding.\nThis type of rounding, which is also named rounding to a logarithmic scale, is a variant of Rounding to a specified increment but with an increment that is modified depending on the scale and magnitude of the result. Concretely, the intent is to limit the number of significant digits, rounding the value so that non-significant digits will be dropped. This type of rounding occurs implicitly with numbers computed with floating-point values with limited precision (such as IEEE-754 \"float\" and \"double\" types), but it may be used more generally to round any real values with any positive number of significant digits and any strictly positive real base.\nFor example it can be used in engineering graphics for representing data with a logarithmic scale with variable steps (for example wave lengths, whose base is not necessarily an integer measure), or in statistical data to define classes of real values within intervals of exponentially growing widths (but the most common use is with integer bases such as 10 or 2).\nThis type of rounding is based on a logarithmic scale defined by a fixed non-zero real scaling factor \"s\" (in most frequent cases this factor is \"s\"=1) and a fixed positive base \"b\"&gt;1 (not necessarily an integer and most often different from the scaling factor), and a fixed integer number \"n\"&gt;0 of significant digits in that base (which will determine the value of the increment to use for rounding, along with the computed effective scale of the rounded number).\nThe primary argument number (as well as the resulting rounded number) is first represented in exponential notation \"x\" = \"s\"\u00b7\"a\"\u00b7\"m\"\u00b7\"b\"\"c\", such that the sign \"s\" is either +1 or \u22121, the absolute mantissa \"a\" is restricted to the half-open positive interval [1/\"b\",1), and the exponent \"c\" is any (positive or negative) integer. In that representation, all significant digits are in the fractional part of the absolute mantissa whose integer part is always zero.\nIf the source number (or rounded number) is 0, the absolute mantisssa \"a\" is defined as 0, the exponent \"c\" is fixed to an arbitrary value (0 in most conventions, but some floating-point representations cannot use a null absolute mantissa but reserve a specific maximum negative value for the exponent \"c\" to represent the number 0 itself), and the sign \"s\" may be arbitrarily chosen between \u22121 or +1 (it is generally set to +1 for simple zero, or it is set to the same sign as the argument in the rounded value if the number representation allows to differentiate positive and negative zeroes, even if they finally represent the same numeric value 0).\nA scaled exponential representation as \"x\" = \"a\"\u00b7\"s\"\u00b7\"b\"\"c\" may also be used equivalently, with a signed mantissa \"a\" either equal to zero or within one of the two half-open intervals (\u22121,\u22121/\"b\"] and [+1/\"b\",+1), and this will be the case in the algorithm below.\nThe steps to compute this scaled rounding are generally similar to the following:\nFor the abstract \"round()\" function, this type of rounding can use any one of the \"rounding to integer\" modes described more completely in the next section, but it is most frequently the \"round to nearest\" mode (with tie-breaking rules also described more completely below).\nFor example:\nRound to available value.\nFinished lumber, writing paper, capacitors, and many other products are usually sold in only a few standard sizes.\nMany design procedures describe how to calculate an approximate value, and then \"round\" to some standard size using phrases such as \"round down to nearest standard value\", \"round up to nearest standard value\", or \"round to nearest standard value\".\nWhen a set of preferred values is equally spaced on a logarithmic scale,\nChoosing the closest preferred value to any given value can be seen as a kind of scaled rounding.\nSuch \"rounded\" values can be directly calculated.\nFloating-point rounding.\nIn floating-point arithmetic, rounding aims to turn a given value \"x\" into a value \"z\" with a specified number of \"significant\" digits. In other words, \"z\" should be a multiple of a number \"m\" that depends on the magnitude of \"z\". The number \"m\" is a power of the base (usually 2 or 10) of the floating-point form.\nApart from this detail, all the variants of rounding discussed above apply to the rounding of floating-point numbers as well. The algorithm for such rounding is presented in the Scaled rounding section above, but with a constant scaling factor \"s\"=1, and an integer base \"b\"&gt;1.\nFor results where the rounded result would overflow the result for a directed rounding is either the appropriate signed infinity, or the highest representable positive finite number (or the lowest representable negative finite number if \"x\" is negative), depending on the direction of rounding. The result of an overflow for the usual case of \"round to even\" is always the appropriate infinity.\nIn addition, if the rounded result would underflow, i.e. if the exponent would exceed the lowest representable integer value, the effective result may be either zero (possibly signed if the representation can maintain a distinction of signs for zeroes), or the smallest representable positive finite number (or the highest representable negative finite number if \"x\" is negative), possibly a \"denormal\" positive or negative number (if the mantissa is storing all its significant digits, in which case the most significant digit may still be stored in a lower position by setting the highest stored digits to zero, and this stored mantissa does not drop the most significant digit, something that is possible when base \"b\"=2 because the most significant digit is always 1 in that base), depending on the direction of rounding. The result of an underflow for the usual case of \"round to even\" is always the appropriate zero.\nDouble rounding.\nRounding a number twice in succession to different precisions, with the latter precision being coarser, is not guaranteed to give the same result as rounding once to the final precision except in the case of directed rounding. For instance rounding 9.46 to one decimal gives 9.5, and then 10 when rounding to integer using rounding half to even, but would give 9 when rounded to integer directly.\nSome computer languages and the IEEE 754-2008 standard dictate that in straightforward calculations, the result should not be rounded twice. This has been a particular problem with Java as it is designed to be run identically on different machines, special programming tricks have had to be used to achieve this with x87 floating point.\nThe Java language was changed to allow different results where the difference does not matter and require a \"strictfp\" qualifier to be used when the results have to conform accurately.\nExact computation with rounded arithmetic.\nIt is possible to use rounded arithmetic to evaluate the exact value of a function with a discrete domain and range. For example, if we know that an integer \"n\" is a perfect square, we can compute its square root by converting \"n\" to a floating-point value \"x\", computing the approximate square root \"y\" of \"x\" with floating point, and then rounding \"y\" to the nearest integer \"q\". If \"n\" is not too big, the floating-point roundoff error in \"y\" will be less than 0.5, so the rounded value \"q\" will be the exact square root of \"n\". In most modern computers, this method may be much faster than computing the square root of \"n\" by an all-integer algorithm.\nThe table-maker's dilemma.\nWilliam Kahan coined the term \"The Table-Maker's Dilemma\" for the unknown cost of rounding transcendental functions:\nThe IEEE floating point standard guarantees that add, subtract, multiply, divide, square root, and floating point remainder will give the correctly rounded result of the infinite precision operation. However, no such guarantee is given for more complex functions and they are typically only accurate to within the last bit at best.\nUsing the Gelfond\u2013Schneider theorem and Lindemann\u2013Weierstrass theorem, many of the standard elementary functions can be proved to return transcendental results when given rational non-zero arguments; therefore it is always possible to correctly round such functions. However determining a limit for a given precision on how accurate results needs to be computed before a correctly rounded result can be guaranteed may demand a lot of computation time.\nThere are some packages around now that offer full accuracy. The MPFR package gives correctly rounded arbitrary precision results. IBM has written a package for fast and accurate IEEE elementary functions and in the future the standard libraries may offer such precision.\nIt is possible to devise well-defined computable numbers which it may never be possible to correctly round no matter how many digits are calculated. For instance, if Goldbach's conjecture is true but unprovable, then it is impossible to correctly round down 0.5 + 10-n where n is the first even number greater than 4 which is not the sum of two primes, or 0.5 if there is no such number. This can however be approximated to any given precision even if the conjecture is unprovable.\nHistory.\nThe concept of rounding is very old, perhaps older even than the concept of division. Some ancient clay tablets found in Mesopotamia contain tables with rounded values of reciprocals and square roots in base 60.\nRounded approximations to \u03c0, the length of the year, and the length of the month are also ancient.\nThe \"Round-to-even\" method has served as the ASTM (E-29) standard since 1940. The origin of the terms \"unbiased rounding\" and \"statistician's rounding\" are fairly self-explanatory. In the 1906 4th edition of \"Probability and Theory of Errors\" Robert Simpson Woodward called this \"the computer's rule\" indicating that it was then in common use by human computers who calculated mathematical tables. Churchill Eisenhart's 1947 paper \"Effects of Rounding or Grouping Data\" (in \"Selected Techniques of Statistical Analysis\", McGrawHill, 1947, Eisenhart, Hastay, and Wallis, editors) indicated that the practice was already \"well established\" in data analysis.\nThe origin of the term \"bankers' rounding\" remains more obscure. If this rounding method was ever a standard in banking, the evidence has proved extremely difficult to find. To the contrary, section 2 of the European Commission report \"The Introduction of the Euro and the Rounding of Currency Amounts\" suggests that there had previously been no standard approach to rounding in banking; and it specifies that \"half-way\" amounts should be rounded up.\nUntil the 1980s, the rounding method used in floating-point computer arithmetic was usually fixed by the hardware, poorly documented, inconsistent, and different for each brand and model of computer. This situation changed after the IEEE 754 floating point standard was adopted by most computer manufacturers. The standard allows the user to choose among several rounding modes, and in each case, specifies precisely how the results should be rounded. These features made numerical computations more predictable and machine-independent, and made possible the efficient and consistent implementation of interval arithmetic.\nRounding functions in programming languages.\nMost programming languages provide functions or special syntax to round fractional numbers in various ways. The earliest numeric languages, such as FORTRAN and C, would provide only one method, usually truncation (towards zero). This default method could be implied in certain contexts, such as when assigning a fractional number to an integer variable, or using a fractional number as an index of an array. Other kinds of rounding had to be programmed explicitly; for example, rounding a positive number to the nearest integer could be implemented by adding 0.5 and truncating.\nIn the last decades, however, the syntax and/or the standard libraries of most languages have commonly provided at least the four basic rounding functions (up/ceiling, down/floor, to nearest, and towards zero). The tie-breaking method may vary depending the language and version, and/or may be selectable by the programmer. Several languages follow the lead of the IEEE-754 floating-point standard, and define these functions as taking a double precision float argument and returning the result of the same type, which then may be converted to an integer if necessary. Since the IEEE double precision format has 52 fraction bits, this approach may avoid spurious overflows in languages have 32-bit integers. Some languages, such as PHP, provide functions that round a value to a specified number of decimal digits, e.g. from 4321.5678 to 4321.57 or 4300. In addition, many languages provide a \"printf\" or similar string formatting function, which allows one to convert a fractional number to a string, rounded to a user-specified number of decimal places (the \"precision\"). On the other hand, truncation (round to zero) is still the default rounding method used by many languages, especially for the division of two integer values.\nOn the opposite, CSS and SVG do not define any specific maximum precision for numbers and measurements, that are treated and exposed in their Document Object Model and in their Interface-description-language interface as strings as if they had infinite precision, and do not discriminate between integers and floating point values; however, the implementations of these languages will typically convert these numbers into IEEE-754 double floating points before exposing the computed digits with a limited precision (notably within standard Javascript or ECMAScript interface bindings).\nOther rounding standards.\nSome disciplines or institutions have issued standards or directives for rounding.\nU.S. Weather Observations.\nIn a guideline issued in mid-1966, the U.S. Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorology determined that weather data should be rounded to the nearest round number, with the \"round half up\" tie-breaking rule. For example, 1.5 rounded to integer should become 2, and \u22121.5 should become \u22121. Prior to that date, the tie-breaking rule was \"round half away from zero\".\nNegative zero in meteorology.\nSome meteorologists may write \"-0\" to indicate a temperature between 0.0 and -0.5 degrees (exclusive) that was rounded to integer. This notation is used when the negative sign is considered important, no matter how small is the magnitude; for example, when rounding temperatures in the Celsius scale, where below zero indicates freezing.\nOther websites.\nAn introduction to different rounding algorithms that is accessible to a general audience but especially useful to those studying computer science and electronics."}

Its primary cause was the people's response to the raising of war taxes by King Henry VII to pay for a campaign against Scotland. Tin miners were angered as the scale of the taxes overturned previous rights granted by Edward I of England to the Cornish Stannary Parliament which exempted Cornwall from all taxes of 10ths or 15ths of income.\nRebellion.\nIn reaction to King Henry's tax levy, Michael Joseph (An Gof), a blacksmith from St Keverne and Thomas Flamank a lawyer from Bodmin, persuaded many of the people of Cornwall to revolt against the King. An army of 15,000 marched into Devon, attracting support in terms of provisions and recruits as they went. Apart from one isolated incident at Taunton their march was not accompanied by any violence or looting. From Taunton, they moved on to Wells, where they were joined by the seventh Baron Audley, an able soldier. \nFrom Wells to Winchester and Kent.\nAfter issuing a declaration of grievances, the army left Wells and marched to Winchester via Bristol and Salisbury, remarkably unopposed as they progressed across the south of England. At this point, having come so far, there seems to have been some questioning of what exactly should be done. Flamank proposed that they should head for Kent, 'the classic soil of protests', the home of the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 and Jack Cade's rebellion, to rally the volatile men of Kent to their banner. Having failed to attract support in Kent part of the army abandoned the march and returned home while the rest turned towards Surrey.\nIn Surrey.\nMoving back west, by Tuesday 13 June 1497 the Cornish army arrived at Guildford. Although shocked by the scale of the revolt, Henry VII had not been idle. The army of 8000 men assembled for Scotland was recalled. The same day that the Cornish arrived at Guildford, Lord Daubeney and his army took up position upon Hounslow Heath and were cheered by the arrival of food and wine dispatched by the Lord Mayor of London.\nThe Crown decided to take the offensive and test the strength and resolve of the Cornish forces. Lord Daubeney sent out a force of 500 mounted spearmen and they clashed with the Cornish at 'Gill Down' outside Guildford on Wednesday 14 June 1497.\nThe Cornish army left Guildford and moved via Banstead and Chussex Plain to Blackheath where they pitched their final camp, looking down from the hill onto the Thames and City of London. Somehow An Gof held his army together, but faced with overwhelming odds, some Cornish deserted and by morning there remained only some 9-10,000 Cornish stalwarts left in arms.\nBattle of Deptford Bridge.\nThe Battle of Deptford Bridge (also known as Battle of Blackheath) took place on 17 June 1497 on a site in present-day Deptford south-east London, near the River Ravensbourne and was the climax of the Cornish Rebellion. Henry VII had an army of some 25,000 men and the Cornish lacked the supporting cavalry and artillery arms essential to the professional forces of the time. After carefully spreading rumours that he would attack on the following Monday, Henry moved against the Cornish at dawn on Saturday (17 June 1497). The Royal forces were divided into three 'battles', two under Lords Oxford, Essex and Suffolk, to wheel round the right flank and rear of enemy whilst the third waited in reserve. When the Cornish were duly surrounded, Lord Daubeney and the third 'battle' were ordered into frontal attack.\nCornish force at the bridge.\nAt the bridge at Deptford Strand, the Cornish had placed a body of archers to block the passage of the river. Here Daubeney had a hot time of it before his spearmen eventually captured the crossing with some losses (a mere 8 men or as many as 300 depending on one's source). Through ill-advice or inexperience, the Cornish had neglected to provide support for the men at Deptford Strand bridge and the main array stood well back into the heath, near to the top of the hill. Lord Daubeney and his troops poured across in strength and engaged the enemy with great vigour. Daubeney himself was so carried away that he became isolated from his men and was captured. Astoundingly enough, the Cornish simply released him and he soon returned to the fray.\nContinuation of the battle.\nThe two other Royal divisions attacked the Cornish precisely as planned and, as Bacon succinctly put it: being ill-armed and ill-led, and without horse or artillery, they were with no great difficulty cut in pieces and put to flight. Estimates of the Cornish dead range from 200 to 2000 and a general slaughter of the broken army was well under way when An Gof gave the order for surrender. He fled but only got as far as Greenwich before being captured. The less enterprising Lord Audley and Thomas Flamank were taken on the field of battle.\nAftermath.\nBy 2pm, Henry VII had returned to the City in triumph, knighting deserving parties on the way, to accept the acclamation of the Mayor and attend a service of thanksgiving at St Paul's.\nIn due course, severe monetary penalties, extracted by Crown agents, pauperised sections of Cornwall for years to come. Prisoners were sold into slavery and estates were seized and handed to more loyal subjects. The remaining rebels that escaped went home ending the rebellion.\nAn Gof and Flamank were both executed at Tyburn, London on 27 June 1497.

Shuttles are thrown or passed back and forth through the shed, between the yarn threads of the warp in order to weave in the weft.\nThe simplest shuttles, known as \"stick shuttles\", are made from a flat, narrow piece of wood with notches on the ends to hold the weft yarn. More complicated shuttles incorporate bobbins or pirns.\nShuttles are often made of wood from the Flowering Dogwood, because it is so hard, resists splintering, and can be polished to a very smooth finish.\nOriginally shuttles were passed back and forth by hand. However, \"John Kay\" invented a loom in 1733 that incorporated a \"flying shuttle\". This shuttle could be thrown through the warp, which allowed much wider cloth to be woven much more quickly and made the development of machine looms much simpler and easier to use."}

When you pull the trigger, the infrared LED lights up, but the infrared can not be seen by humans. The packs sensors are actively looking for Infrared lights, if you are in range your pack will register the hit. the part of the laser tag beam that you can see is sometimes a laser or a very bright focused red LED. \nIn earlier versions of laser tag the packs sensed light, this was bad, because you needed to large area to play, you were usually in view of the sun, you often got false tags with the sun."}

So he started at the age of ten with piano lessons. After the First World War, he became interested in blues. He was influenced by Hersal Thomas and Jimmy Yancey. At the beginning of the 1920s, he worked as taxi driver where he met another pianist, Meade Lux Lewis. They formed a team and played at clubs and parties.\nIn 1934, he formed his own band, Albert Ammons's Rhythm Kings. Their version of Swanee River Boogie sold over a million copies. Later he went to New York City where he teamed with another pianist, Pete Johnson. They often played at the Caf\u00e9 Society. Sometimes they were joined by Meade Lux Lewis. But they also played there with famous jazz musicians like Benny Goodman or Harry James.\nOn December 23, 1938, Ammons, Lewis and Johnson played at the \"From Spirituals to Swing\" concert. This concert was the start of the public interest in boogie-woogie. One visitor was record producer Alfred Lion who started two weeks later Blue Note Records with recordings of Ammons and Johnson, nine Ammons solos including \"The Blues\" and \"Boogie Woogie Stomp\", eight by Lewis and a pair of duets.\nAfter the interest in boogie-woogie faded, Albert Ammons still had a lot of work. He went on tours as solo artist. Ammons played at President Harry S. Truman's inauguration in 1949. He died on December 2, 1949 in Chicago.\nA lot of pianists like Dave Alexander, Dr. John, Hadda Brooks, Johnnie Johnson, Ray Bryant, Erroll Garner, Katie Webster, Axel Zwingenberger and J\u00f6rg Hegemann named Ammons as a main influence. J\u00f6rg Hegemann recorded a tribute album, \"A Tribute To Albert Ammons\", celebrating his 100th birthday in 2007."}

Much of the present house dates back to Victorian times but some sections date from the 1620s. It is a Grade I listed building and is set in gardens with formal areas. The hill behind the house is planted with a fine selection of shrubs and trees.\nIn 1620 the rich merchant Sir Richard Robartes acquired the estate and began building Lanhydrock House, designed to a four-sided layout around a central courtyard. Robartes died in 1624 but work on the building was continued by his son John Robartes, 1st Earl of Radnor. During the 18th century the east wing of the house was demolished leaving the U-shaped plan seen today. In 1881 a major fire destroyed the south wing and caused much damage to the central section. Of the main house only the north wing, with its 29 metre Long Gallery, and the front porch building survived intact, though the original gatehouse also dates back to the mid 17th century."}

They can see the slightest movement. They can see small prey from a distance. Once they see the prey, the bird makes a short, steep dive. Kestrels eat almost any mouse-sized mammals like voles. They also eat shrews and true mice. Small birds are also eaten, mostly in the summer when young birds are born. The bird also eats spiders and beetles when it finds them."}

{"id": "299188", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=299188", "title": "Diet soft drink", "text": "Diet sodas (or diet pop, diet, sugar-free, or light soft drinks, refreshments, or carbonated beverages) are usually sugar-free, artificially sweetened, non-alcoholic carbonated beverages targeted towards health-conscious people, diabetics, athletes, and other people who want to lose weight, improve physical fitness, or reduce how much sugar they eat.\nSweetening.\nDifferent artificial sweeteners are used instead of sugar to give diet soda a sweet taste and some are often used combined with one another.\nAspartame.\nAspartame, commonly known by the brand name NutraSweet, is one of the most commonly used artificial sweeteners. When aspartame-sweetened Diet Coke was released in 1982 it make aspartame more popular. Today, at least in the United States, when the word \"diet\" is seen or heard it is assumed to be aspartame.\nCyclamates.\nThe first artificial sweeteners used in diet soda were cyclamates (often synergistically with saccharin). While many say these cyclamate-sweetened soda had a better taste than the diet soda that came after them, in 1970 the Food and Drug Administration banned cyclamates in the United States because there was proof that they caused cancer in lab rats. Cyclamates are still used in many countries around the world, including for diet soda.\nSaccharin.\nOnce cyclamates were banned, American producers turned to saccharin. Saccharin alone was often criticized for having a bitter taste and \"chemical\" aftertaste. Some manufacturers, such as Coca-Cola with Tab, attempted to rectify this by adding a small amount of sugar. In 1977, the FDA was petitioned to ban saccharin, too, as a carcinogen, but a moratorium was placed on the ban until studies were conducted. The ban was lifted in 1991, but by that time, virtually all diet soda production had shifted to using aspartame. Perhaps the most notable holdout is Tab, which nevertheless also uses some aspartame in its formula.\nSucralose and acesulfame potassium; \"sugar-free\" sodas.\nRecently two other sweeteners, sucralose (marketed as Splenda) and acesulfame potassium (\"Sunett\" or \"Ace K\" (the K is the chemical symbol for potassium) which is usually used in conjunction with aspartame, sucralose, or saccharin rather than alone) have come into growing use, particularly by smaller beverage producers (e.g. Big Red). Diet Rite is the non-aspartame diet soda brand with the highest sales today; it uses a combination of sucralose and acesulfame potassium.\nAdvocates say drinks employing these sweeteners have a more natural sugar-like taste than those made just with aspartame, and do not have a strong aftertaste. The newer aspartame-free drinks can also be safely consumed by phenylketonurics, because they do not contain phenylalanine. Critics say the taste is not better, merely different, or note that the long-term health risks of all or certain artificial sweeteners is unclear.\nThe widespread, though not universal, agreement that the newest formulations taste much more \"normal\" (sugar-like) than the older diet sodas have prompted some producers, such as Jones Soda, to abandon the \"diet\" label entirely in favor of \"sugar-free soda,\" implying that the taste is good enough to drink the soda even when not trying to lose weight. (This idea was first floated by Diet Coke in 1984, with the tagline, \"Just For the Taste of It.\")\nIn 2005, the Coca-Cola Company announced it would produce a new formulation of Diet Coke sweetened with sucralose, to be called Diet Coke with Splenda, but it would continue to produce the aspartame version as well. There were also rumors that a sugar-free version of Coca-Cola Classic, also sweetened with sucralose, was being formulated as well. This formulation was eventually called Coca-Cola Zero, though it is sweetened with aspartame in conjunction with acesulfame potassium.\nHistory.\nThe beginning of the diet soda or refreshment era was in 1952, when Kirsch Bottling in Brooklyn, New York launched a sugar free ginger ale called No-Cal. It was designed for diabetics, not dieters, and distribution remained local. Royal Crown Cola placed an announcement in an Atlanta newspaper in 1958 announcing a diet soda product, Diet Rite. In 1962, Dr Pepper released a diet(etic) version of its soda, although it sold slowly due to the misconception that it was meant solely for diabetic consumption. In 1963, the Coca-Cola Company joined the diet soda market with Tab, which proved to be a huge success. Tab was originally sweetened with cyclamates and saccharin.\nTab, Diet Rite, and Fresca (a grapefruit-flavored soda introduced by Coca-Cola) were the only brand-name diet refreshments on the market until Pepsi released Diet Pepsi in the 1960s (initially as Patio Diet Cola). Diet 7 Up was also released in 1963 under the name Like. It was discontinued in 1969 due to the US government ban of cyclamate sweetener. After reformulation, it was reintroduced as Diet 7 Up in 1970. It was renamed Sugar Free 7 Up in 1973 then back to Diet 7 Up in 1979. Coca-Cola countered by releasing Diet Coke in 1982. After the release of Diet Coke, Tab took a backseat on the Coca-Cola production lines; Diet Coke could be more easily identified by consumers as associated with Coca-Cola than Tab. Additionally, a study was released claiming that saccharin was a possible carcinogen, leading to Coca-Cola's decision to decrease production of Tab. Prompted by the rising popularity of soft drinks, in the mid-1980s some of those in the alcohol industry began to follow their lead with some beer companies putting sugar-free beer on the market.\nBy the early 1990s, a wide array of different companies had their own diet refreshments on supermarket shelves. Tab made a comeback during the late 1990s, after new studies demonstrated that saccharin is not an important factor in the risk of cancer. Nevertheless, the Coca-Cola Company has maintained its 1984 reformulation, replacing some of the saccharin in Tab with NutraSweet.\nBy 2002, some soda companies had diversified to include such flavors as vanilla and lemon among their products, and diet sodas were soon being produced with those flavors as well (see Diet Vanilla Coke, Diet Pepsi Vanilla). By 2004, several alcohol companies had released sugar-free or \"diet\" alcoholic products too.\nHealth concerns.\nThere are possible health concerns of sugar substitutes and caffeine overuse. Also, the effectiveness of diet soda as a weight loss tool should also be considered.\nChanging the food energy intake from one food will not necessarily change a person's overall food energy intake, or cause a person to lose weight. One study, at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, reported by Sharon Fowler at the ADA annual meeting, actually suggested the opposite, where consumption of diet soda was correlated with weight gain. While Fowler did suggest that the undelivered expected calories from diet soda may stimulate the appetite, the correlation does not prove that consumption of diet soda caused the weight gain. The ADA has yet to issue an updated policy concerning diet soda.\nAn independent study by researchers with the Framingham Heart Study in Massachusetts, has turned up results which indicate that the consumption of diet soda correlates with increased metabolic syndrome. Of the 9,000 males and females studied, findings stated that 48% of the subjects were at higher risk for weight gain and elevated blood sugar. The researchers also acknowledged that diet soda drinkers were less likely to consume healthy foods, and that drinking diet soda flavored with artificial sweeteners more than likely increases cravings for sugar flavored sweets.\nA preliminary abstract presented by the University of Miami's Hannah Gardener linked daily consumption of diet soda to a 61% higher incidence of \"vascular events\" such as strokes and heart attacks, although Gardener acknowledged that these results could not be conclusively linked to harmful effects of diet soda itself, and may be the result of other behaviors. The author stated confirmation was required prior to drawing conclusions. These studies were published as abstracts and presented at a conference. These data and conclusions should be considered to be preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal\nAmong individuals who drink several regular sodas per day, diet soda may be a better choice, according to a website on dieting. Studies have also indicated that body mass gain is an unlikely consequence of artificial sweetener consumption.\nAnimal studies suggest that artificial sweeteners cause body weight gain, theoretically because of a faulty insulin response, at least in cattle and rats. Rats given sweeteners have steadily increased caloric intake, increased body weight, and increased adiposity (fatness). Adding saccharin to the food of calves increases their body weight as well.\nNomenclature.\nIn some countries outside the United States and Canada, the term \"light\" is often used instead of \"diet\".\nReduced-calorie soda.\nIn an effort to cash in on the surging popularity of low-carbohydrate diets, in 2004 both Coca-Cola and Pepsico released reduced-calorie versions of their flagship sodas that contain approximately half the sugar of the regular version. The Pepsi variant, Pepsi Edge, is sweetened with sucralose and corn syrup. The sweetening of the Coca-Cola variant, Coca-Cola C2, is a combination of corn syrup, aspartame, acesulfame potassium, and sucralose. Pepsi discontinued Edge in 2005, citing lackluster sales. Coca-Cola soon followed suit.\nHalf the sugar of a can of regular cola is still more sugar than many people on popular low-carbohydrate diets are permitted to have in a day. It is possible that these sodas are targeted, instead, at so-called \"carb-conscious consumers\" who are paying attention to, but not trying to drastically reduce, their carbohydrate intake."}

It is the most common home language in South Africa, where 24% of people speak it at home. Over 50% of the population also speak and understand the language.\nIn 1994, it became one of South Africa's 11 official languages. Like other Bantu languages, Zulu is written using the Latin alphabet.\nWhere it is spoken.\nZulu belongs to the Nguni group of Bantu languages. Zulu migrants (people who move from place to place) have taken the language to other regions. There are now Zulu speakers in Zimbabwe, Lesotho, Mozambique, Malawi, and Swaziland. \nZulu speakers in Zimbabwe speak a dialect called \"Northern Ndebele language.\"\nPeople who speak Xhosa can understand most Zulu. The opposite is also true: Zulu speakers can understand Xhosa. Xhosa language is the most common language spoken in the Eastern Cape of South Africa.\nHistory.\nThe Zulu, Xhosa, and other Nguni people have lived in South Africa for a long time. The Zulu language has a lot of click sounds common in Southern African languages. These click sounds are not found in the rest of Africa. The Nguni people have lived together with other Southern tribes like the San and Khoi. \nZulu and all other native Southern African languages was at first an oral language. It was not written down until missionaries came from Europe. These missionaries used the Latin alphabet to write the Zulu language. The first Zulu grammar book was published in Norway in 1850 by Hans Paludan Smith Schreuder.\nThe oldest document written in Zulu is a Bible from 1883. John Dube, a Zulu from Natal, wrote the first Zulu novel, \"Insila kaShaka\", in 1933. Another important Zulu author was Reginald Dhlomo. Dhlomo wrote \"U-Dingane\" (1936), \"U-Shaka\" (1937), \"U-Mpande\" (1938), \"U-Cetshwayo\" (1952) and \"U-Dinizulu\" (1968). Other important Zulu writers are Benedict Wallet Vilakazi and Oswald Mbuyiseni Mtshali.\nBefore 1994, the Zulu language was controlled by the Zulu Language Board in KwaZulu-Natal. Today, the Pan South African Language Board supports the use of all 11 official languages of South Africa.\nUse today.\nBefore 1994, the official languages of South Africa were English, Dutch, and Afrikaans. During Apartheid, Zulu was spoken commonly in the Kwazulu bantustan. All education, however, at the high school level was in English or Afrikaans.\nAfter Apartheid ended in 1994, Zulu became one of the official languages in South Africa. The SABC first started showing Zulu-language television and news programs in the 1980s. There are many Zulu radio stations and newspapers available, mostly in the Kwazulu-Natal province and Johannesburg. The first full-length feature film in Zulu was \"Yesterday\". It was made in 2004 and nominated for an Academy Award (Oscar).\nIn \"The Lion King\" movie, the \"Circle of Life\" song has many Zulu phrases in it. Some of these phrases are:\nOther \"Lion King\" songs also had Zulu phrases in them.\nStandard and urban Zulu.\nThere are two main types of Zulu. One type is called standard Zulu, and it is taught in schools. Standard Zulu is also called \"deep Zulu\" (). Standard Zulu is a purist language. This means that new ideas are described using words that are derived from other Zulu words.\nThe other type of Zulu is called urban Zulu (). Urban Zulu is the kind of Zulu spoken by people who live in cities. Urban Zulu uses loan words borrowed from other languages to describe new ideas. Most of these loan words come from English.\nSome of these different words for new ideas in Standard and Urban Zulu are listed here:\nThese two different types of Zulu language make problems in learning and education. Young people speak urban Zulu and do not often understand standard Zulu.\nPhrases.\nThis is a list of phrases in Zulu.\nCommon place names in Zulu.\nZulu place names occur in the \"locative\" form most of the time. A place name is both a preposition and a name. Changing the prefix of the place name changes the preposition.\nFor example, the Zulu name for Johannesburg is \"iGoli.\" The word \"eGoli\" means to/at/in/from Johannesburg. The root word \"Goli\" means \"Johannesburg,\" but doesn't mean anything by itself in Zulu.\nMost of the time, changing the \"i-\" or \"u-\" prefix to the \"e-\" prefix changes the meaning like this. In some cases, like with Durban, the name changes too.\n'Zulu' or 'isiZulu'?\nThe Zulu name for the language is \"isiZulu\". The \"isi-\" prefix means \"language.\" (It also means other things, but here it means language.) For example, \"isiNgisi\" means English, \"isiXhosa\" means Xhosa, \"isiBhunu\" means Afrikaans, and \"isiJalimane\" means German.\nWhen the word Zulu has a prefix that is \"not\" \"isi-\", it means a lot of different things. This is a table that shows how the meanings of the word changes:\nZulu words in South African English.\nMany Zulu words are used in South African English. Some words, like the names of local animals, are used in standard English. \"Impala\" and \"mamba\", for example, are zulu words. Some Zulu words used in South African English are:"}

During Apartheid, the Zulu people were third-class citizens and suffered from official discrimination. Today the Zulu people are the largest ethnic group in South Africa and have equal rights.\nBeginning.\nThe Zulu were originally a major clan in the area that is today Northern KwaZulu-Natal. The Zulu clan was started around the year 1709 by Zulu kaNtombhela. In the Nguni languages, the words \"iZulu\", \"iliZulu\", and \"liTulu\" mean \"heaven\", or \"sky.\"\nIn the early 1700s, many large Nguni communities and clans lived in the area. These groups were called \"isizwe\" (nations) and \"isibongo\" (clans). These Nguni communities had migrated down the East coast of Africa over thousands of years. These movements of people were called the Bantu migrations. They probably arrived in what is today South Africa in the 800s."}

The trophy could be won in a race between automobile clubs from different countries. The trophy was given out every year until 1905. After that, the ACF held the first Grand Prix motor racing event at the Circuit de la Sarthe, in Le Mans.\nThe British Racing Green was first used in the 1903 Gordon Bennet Cup in Ireland.\nThe Gordon Bennett Cup auto races included racing drivers from across Europe. There were also drivers from the United States like Alexander Winton, who drove his Winton automobile. \nThe rules were that the races were done in the country of the winner of the year before. The races were between national teams. Because of this, the national racing colours had to be set for each country. Great Britain had to choose a different colour to red, white or blue (the colours of the flag) because they had been taken by Italy, Germany and France. They choose shamrock green because the race that year was run in Ireland. This became known as the British racing green."}

It runs from Madison Square (at 23rd Street) to the Madison Avenue Bridge across the Harlem River (at 138th Street). In doing so, it passes through Midtown Manhattan, the Upper East Side (including Carnegie Hill), Spanish Harlem, and Harlem. It is named after Madison Square, which is itself named after James Madison, the fourth President of the United States. Since the 1920s, the street's name has been synonymous with the American advertising industry.\nMadison Avenue was not part of the original New York City street grid established in the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, and was carved between Park Avenue (formerly Fourth) and Fifth Avenue in 1836, due to the effort of lawyer and real estate developer Samuel B. Ruggles. Ruggles was a graduate of Yale University who had previously purchased and developed New York's Gramercy Park in 1831, who was in part responsible for the development of Union Square and who also named Lexington Avenue.\nTraffic.\nMadison Avenue carries one-way traffic uptown (northbound) from 23rd Street to 135th Street, with the change from two-way traffic having taken place on January 14, 1966, at which time Fifth Avenue was changed to one way downtown (southbound).\nOne lane of Madison Avenue in Midtown is limited to turns made by city buses or taxicabs, at some hours of the day. Based on Section 4-12(m) of the New York City Traffic Rules, driving a vehicle, other than a bus, is prohibited in the bus lane on Madison Avenue to turn right during the restricted hours specified by sign between 42nd Street and 59th Street. All vehicles are allowed at 60th Street, but a taxicab carrying a passenger may use the bus lane to turn right at 46th Street.\nAdvertising industry.\nThe term \"Madison Avenue\" is often used to mean \"advertising\". Madison Avenue became identified with the advertising industry after the quick growth along the avenue during the 1920s.\nAccording to \"The Emergence of Advertising in America\", by the year 1861 there were twenty advertising agencies in New York City. In 1911, the New York City Association of Advertising Agencies was founded, as years ahead of the establishment of the American Association of Advertising Agencies.\nAmong various depictions in popular culture, the portion of the advertising industry which centers on Madison Avenue serves as a backdrop for the AMC television drama \"Mad Men\", which focuses on industry activities during the 1960s.\nLate in the 20th century, many agencies left Madison Avenue. Some moved further downtown and others moved west. Today, only a few agencies are still located in the old business cluster on Madison Avenue, including Young &amp; Rubicam, StrawberryFrog, TBWA Worldwide and Doyle Dane Bernbach. However, the term is still used to describe the agency business as a whole and the large, New York\u2013based agencies in particular."}

She was the youngest daughter of Duke Philip of Parma and his wife, Louise \u00c9lisabeth of France, the eldest daughter of King Louis XV.\nBiography.\nChristened Luisa Maria Teresa Anna, but known as Mar\u00eda Luisa was born at the Ducal Palace of Colorno in the Duchy of Parma. She was the favourite child of her mother, who tried to engage her to the heir to the French throne, however the prince died in 1761. In 1762 Maria Luisa became engaged to the Prince of Asturias (heir to the throne), Charles, later King Charles IV of Spain. She married the future Charles IV on 4 September 1765. From her marriage she was the most senior female at the Spanish court, Queen Maria Amalia having died in 1761. \nMaria Luisa was regularly painted by the famous Spanish artist Goya. She was often described by contemporaries as an ugly, vicious, and coarse woman who greatly dominated the king. Maria Luisa dominated her husband and was believed to have had many love affairs, but there is no evidence that Maria Luisa had any lovers. Gossip pointed out Manuel de Godoy, her husband's Prime Minister, was her long-time lover. She was unpopular during her reign and has also long had a bad reputation in history, mainly because of her alleged love affairs and her support of pro-French policies that eventually were not good for Spain. In 1792, the \"Order of Queen Maria Luisa\" was founded on her suggestion, an order which was given only to women.\nHer husband abdicated the throne of Spain in 1808, and together with Maria Luisa and Godoy spent the rest of his life in exile. When Napoleon's army invaded the country, several pamphlets blamed her for that. Maria Luisa spent some years in France and then in Rome, Italy. Both Maria Luisa and her husband died in Italy in early 1819."}

It passes through Alcester, Birmingham, Lichfield and Derby.\nFour Roman roads are named in the Laws of Edward the Confessor; Watling Street, Ermine Street, the Fosse Way and Hikenild (or Icknield) Street. Hikenild Street, is generally supposed to be connected with the Iceni. Various forms of the name, the earliest, in Anglo-Saxon, are Icenhilde Weg or Icenilde We. These roads are from the borders of Norfolk through Cambridgeshire, Bucks, Berks, Hants, and Wilts into Dorset. These locations however would identify the path as Icknield Way, an Iron Age trackway running from Norfolk to Dorset. \nThis road got the name Ryknild Street during the 12th century when it was named by Ranulf Higdon, a monk writing in 1344 in his \"Polychronicon\". Higdon, gives the name of the fourth road as Rikenild Strete, which, he says, tends from the south-west to the north, and begins at St. David's and continues to the mouth of the Tyne, passing Worcester, Droitwich, Birmingham, Lichfield, Derby, and Chesterfield. It has borne that name, or Rigning, Reenald, or Rignall, from early times. In three of the four MSS. of Higdon, the name is given Rikenilde, Rikenyldes, and in the fourth, which is said to be one of the earliest, Hikenil Street. Trevisa's English translation (1387) calls it Rykeneldes Street. Harverfield writing in the Victoria County History of Warwickshire doubted if the road had any real and original right to either name, preferring Ryknild as no less correct, (or no more wrong) and being able to separate it from Icknield Street in Oxfordshire and Berkshire. It is now called Icknield or Ryknild Street to separate it from the older Icknield Way. A kept part of the Roman road can be seen at Sutton Park in Birmingham."}

Damages of friendly army were so heavy, and Grenfell was left as the senior officer. When he was reorganizing the regiment behind a railway bank, he was twice hit and severely wounded. But once he was asked to save the guns by Major Ernest Wright Alexander of the 119th Battery, Royal Field Artillery, Grenfell and some volunteers helped to push the guns out of range of enemy fire, under a shower of bullets.\nLondon Gazette on 16 September 1914 wrote as follows:\nHe was killed in action on 24 May 1915 and is buried in the Vlamertinghe Military Cemetery.\nLegacy.\nHis Victoria Cross is displayed at the Regimental Museum of the 9th/12th Royal Lancers housed in Derby Museum and Art Gallery, Derby, England.\nPolo.\nAll nine of the Grenfell brothers were expert polo players.

Before 1994, KwaZulu-Natal was made up of the province of Natal and the KwaZulu homeland.\nBackground.\nIn the 1830s, the northern part of KwaZulu-Natal was part of the Zulu Kingdom. The southern part of KwaZulu-Natal was a Boer republic called Natalia (1839-1843). In 1843, Natalia became a British colony. Zululand remained independent until 1879. \nToday KwaZulu-Natal is the traditional home of the Zulu nation. It is called the \"garden province.\" Two natural areas, the iSimangaliso Wetland Park and the uKhahlamba Drakensberg Park, have been declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\nKwaZulu-Natal is located to the east of South Africa. It borders the Indian Ocean as well as three other provinces, and the countries of Mozambique, Eswatini, and Lesotho. Its capital is Pietermaritzburg and its largest city is Durban.\nGeography.\nKwaZulu-Natal is about in area, making it about the same size as Portugal. The province has three different geographic areas. The lowland region lies along the Indian Ocean coast. It is very narrow in the south and widens in the northern part of the province. The central region is called the Natal Midlands. The midlands are hilly plateaus that rise toward the west. \nThe third region is mountainous. The two mountain ranges are the Drakensberg Mountains in the west and the Lebombo Mountains in the north. The Drakensberg mountains are basalt cliffs that rise near Lesotho. The Lebombo Mountains are ancient granite mountains that run south from Swaziland. The Tugela River flows west to east across the center of the province and is the region's largest river.\nThe coastal areas have dense stands of subtropical trees and shrubs and deep ravines. Afromontane Forest grows on the steep sides of the ravines. The midlands have moist (wet) grasslands and small pockets of Afromontane Forest. The north is mostly wet savanna. The Drakensberg region is alpine grassland.\nHIV.\nOne of the biggest problems in the province is HIV infection. The country of South Africa has more HIV-positive citizens than any other country in the world. KwaZulu-Natal has the highest rate of HIV infection of all of the provinces. According to UNAIDS in 2009, the infection rate is 39%.\nMany people die from complications from AIDS. Infected people in KwaZulu-Natal do not have the health care, medicine, and proper food they need to stay healthy. HIV/AIDS has slowed economic growth by destroying human capital, the ability of people to make money in society."}

It began in South Korea. As well as music, K-pop has grown into a popular subculture among teenagers and young adults throughout Asia. There is a lot of interest in the fashions and styles of Korean idol groups and singers.\nK-pop can now reach a much larger audience through use of the Internet. With Facebook fan pages, iTunes, Twitter, and music videos on YouTube, K-pop is becoming popular in many other countries around the world.\nEntertainment shows like Weekly Idol show the K-Pop stars' comedic side.\nFashion.\nToday, young people like K-Pop star fashion. The World Fashion Company spoke to G-Dragon from Big Bang, because his fashion is unique. Jeremy Scott, a well-known American fashion designer, worked together with CL from the K-Pop band 2NE1, to design clothes.\nOther K-pop stars such as Baekhyun from Exo have started their own fashion brands.\nDance.\nGroup dancing is one of the most important parts of K-Pop. Group members dance in sync. Fans often learn and copy the key moves of the dance.\nMany different styles of dance can be seen within K-Pop.\nHistory.\n1990s.\nThe setting up of Seo Tai-ji &amp; Boys in 1992 was a turning point for popular music in South Korea. Using rap rock and techno styles, Hip hop duos such as Deux also were popular in the early 1990s.\nIn 1995, Korean businessman Lee Soo Man opened South Korea's largest talent agency, S.M. Entertainment, and set up the first K-Pop girl groups and boy bands. By the late 1990s, new agencies like YG Entertainment, DSP Entertainment, and JYP Entertainment were producing talents as quickly as possible.\nGroups such as H.O.T, Sechs Kies, god, and Shinhwa, and artists like Drunken Tiger had huge success in the 1990s.\n2000s.\nThe talent agencies train new artists and bands for the K-pop industry. To make sure it is successful, they take over every part of the young person's career and life. They can spend more than $400,000 to train and launch a new artist. Through this practice of apprenticeship, which often lasts two years or more, trainees are taught to sing, learn professional choreography, sculpt and shape their bodies through exercise, and study multiple languages, all the while attending school. In order to get this money back, the artists are signed up to long contracts, with little money being paid. These have been described as slave contracts. The band Dong Bang Shin Ki or TVXQ were given a 13-year contract which the Korean courts have said was too long and had too many restrictions. With CD sales being low, and Internet sales making only a few cents from a song, most money is made through tours and selling merchandise.\nK-Pop is becoming popular outside of Asia, most notably in the United States, Canada, and Australia. In 2009, the Wonder Girls became the first Korean singers on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart with their single, \"Nobody\". The following year, solo artist Taeyang and girl group 2NE1 also reached the top of various music charts throughout the United States and Canada with albums and hit songs. In 2011, Big Bang's album \"Tonight\" became the first K-pop album to reach the top 10 on US iTunes chart. It was also only non-English language album in the top 100.\nTo make the genre popular around the world, K-pop artists are starting to work with stars outside of Korea. In the United States, Korean artists are touring with groups such as the Jonas Brothers. They are also working with well-known producers including Kanye West, Teddy Riley, Diplo, Rodney Jerkins, and will.i.am.\nJapanese public broadcaster NHK decided to ban K-Pop from the New Year's Eve show in 2012 for political reasons, due to ongoing disputes between Japan and Korea over Liancourt Rocks.\nKorean rock.\nK-Pop does include other popular Korean genres of music than Pop, such as rock. Some popular Korean rock bands are DreamCatcher, Guckkasten, YB and Nell. See also the Pentaport Rock Festival."}

It is the area on the West Side of Manhattan. It is between 34th Street and 59th Street, from 8th Avenue to the Hudson River.\nThe neighborhood has transportation, hospital and warehouse infrastructure for the Midtown Manhattan business district. Its bad reputation made real estate prices in the area lower than much of the rest of Manhattan until the early 1990s.\nOnce a center of poor and working-class Irish Americans, over the last three decades of the 20th century and into the new millennium, Hell's Kitchen has undergone change as a result of its location at Midtown. The 1969 edition of the \"Plan for New York City\" book, authored by the City Planning Commission, stated that people of modest means were being driven from the area by development pressures due to the Midtown location. Today, many actors live in the neighborhood due to its closeness to the Broadway theaters and Actors Studio training school.\nBorders of area.\n\"Hell's Kitchen\" generally refers to the area from 34th to 59th streets, southwest of Central Park. Starting west of 8th Avenue, city zoning regulations limit buildings to 6 stories high (although exceptions are often made). As a result, most of the buildings are older, often walk-ups. For the most part the neighborhood covers the ZIP codes 10019 and 10036. The post office for 10019 is known as Radio City Station, the original name for Rockefeller Center on Sixth Avenue.\nName.\nSeveral different explanations exist for the original name.

According to the Irish Cultural Society of the Garden City Area:\nAccording to an article by Kirkley Greenwell, published online by the Hell's Kitchen Neighborhood Association:\nLocal historian Mary Clark adds a story when she states the name:\nToday, most residents of the area, and most New Yorkers in general, refer to the area as \"Hell's Kitchen\", with \"Clinton\" being the name favored by the municipality, \"gentrifiers\", and eager real estate agents."}

It is transmitted through food containing endospores or through a wound. The most potent neurotoxin known is produced when the bacteria is exposed to low oxygen and body temperature. Foods which have been improperly canned are responsible for 90% of the cases of botulism. Natural, unpasteurized honey has been known to transmit infection and intoxication with the pathogen and the neurotoxin. Botulism is a neuroparalytic disease causing a flaccid paralysis; the neurotoxin blocks neurotransmitters. This results in an inability to contract muscles.

It is also known as siNdebele or simply Ndebele.\nNdebele is related to the Zulu language spoken in South Africa. The Ndebele people of Zimbabwe are descended from followers of the Zulu leader Mzilikazi. Mzilikazi and his people left kwaZulu in the early 1800s during the Mfecane. They travelled North, past what is now Gauteng, Mpumalanga and Limpopo, in South Africa, and into Zimbabwe and Botswana.

The Southern Ndebele language has similarities to the Sotho and Tswana languages.\nPronunciation.\nIt is relatively easy to pronounce Ndebele words because the vowel sounds are constant.

Dietary habits are the usual decisions someone or a culture makes when choosing what foods to eat. \nIn discussing diet, the key issue is the change in work done. People have moved from manual work to office-type work, and to houses which have washing machines (et cetera). This has happened usually without changes in eating habits got during childhood. This is the basic reason why people get fat, with all the problems which follow. \nWith the word diet, it is often expressed the use of specific intake of nutrition for health or weight-management reasons (with the two often being related). Although humans are omnivores, each culture and each person holds some food preferences or some food taboos, due to personal tastes or ethical reasons. Individual dietary choices may be more or less healthful. A proper nutrition requires a proper ingestion and, also important, the absorption of vitamins, minerals, and food energy in the form of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Dietary habits and choices play a significant role in health and mortality, and can also define cultures and play a role in religion.\nDiets are about eating the right quantity and type of food at the right time. When people talk about a diet, they are usually referring to a special kind of diet. When someone says they are \"dieting\", it means that they are trying to lose weight. People who study diet and eating habits are called dietitians.\nWhen the diet is not right, people can gain or lose weight. They may become overweight or underweight. To get back to their normal weight, they need to change their diet. This may be very hard to do. Often help from a specialist is required.\nSome people will also do fasting - they will not eat anything for some time to lose weight, balance their diet and clean their bodies.\nSome people have diseases where they cannot eat certain foods without becoming very sick. They need to change their diet to avoid these foods. A food allergy is a condition in which a specific food makes someone sick. Phenylketonuria is a disease in which a person cannot digest certain foods properly because they have an amino acid, or type of chemical, called phenylalanines in them.\nA fad diet is a type of diet that becomes popular for a short time without any major health organizations recommending it."}

It is a phrase used by historians and political scientists to describe the time period between 1828 and 1854. People quickly became more interested in voting starting in 1828. More people came to political rallies and showed up to vote on election day. There were also more partisan newspapers, which supported a certain political party. People became very loyal to their party. \nThere were two main political parties during this time period. One was the Democratic Party, led by Andrew Jackson. The other was the Whig Party, started by Henry Clay. The Whig party was made up of members of the National Republican Party and other people who opposed Jackson.\nThere were also a number of important minor parties. The Anti-Masonic Party (1827-34) was important in developing political ideas and laws. The Liberty Party in the 1840s was an important abolitionist party (against slavery). The United States Free Soil Party in 1848 and 1852 was another anti-slavery party.\nThe Second Party System was an important part of the politics, society, economics, and culture of the Jacksonian Era. It was followed by the Third Party System after 1854. \nPatterns.\nThe phrase \"second party system\" was defined by the historian Richard P. McCormick. He said that the system was:\nLeaders.\nA number of important historical people were political leaders in this system. Some famous democrats were: Andrew Jackson, Martin Van Buren, John C. Calhoun, James K. Polk, Lewis Cass, and Stephen Douglas. Some famous Whigs were: Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, William H. Seward, and Thurlow Weed. \nBeginnings.\nThe United States presidential election in 1824 did not have any political parties. There were four main candidates for president: Henry Clay, William Crawford, Andrew Jackson, and John Quincy Adams. At the end of the race, none of the candidates had enough votes in the electoral college to win, and the United States House of Representatives had to choose the winner. The three final candidates were Adams, Crawford, and Jackson. Even though Clay was not one of these finalists, he was the Speaker of the House, and it was his job to negotiate who would become president. Jackson had the most popular votes (votes cast by citizens) and the most electoral votes (votes cast by the electoral college), but was not elected. Instead, John Quincy Adams was elected president. He immediately chose Clay to be his Secretary of State.\nJackson loudly declared this to be a \"corrupt bargain.\" Jackson was a very popular politician, the most famous fighter of the American Indian Wars, and a hero of the War of 1812. He gathered his supporters in politics and the local militias and created the Democratic Party. Martin Van Buren, a brilliant leader in New York politics, was Jackson's most important supporter. Van Buren was popular in Virginia and Pennsylvania, and he had the support of their electoral college votes. The new Democratic Party beat Adams in the U.S. presidential election of 1828 and Jackson was elected president. Van Buren became the Secretary of State, and later Vice President. Adams, Clay, and their supporters in the Democratic-Republican Party became known as the National Republicans.\nThe Bank War.\nAndrew Jackson was against the idea of giving special favors to special interest groups. He strongly opposed the Second Bank of the United States. The Bank was a federal institution that worked somewhat like a central bank. (It was very similar to the Federal Reserve System that would be developed later.) The bank was controlled by the banker Nicholas Biddle and supported by Henry Clay. Jackson did not like any banks, and he did not believe in paper money. (He believed that money should only be gold and silver.) As president, he was able to close the Second Bank.\nJackson continued to attack the banking system. He issued his \"Specie Circular\" in July 1836. (\"Specie\" is a word that means gold and silver used as money.) The Circular said that only gold and siver coins, and not paper money, could be used to buy federal land. This made most businessmen and bankers join the Whig party. Also, cities that depended on commerce (trade) and industry became supporters of the Whig party. Jackson became more popular with subsistence farmers (farmers who grow crops to eat, but not to sell) and day laborers.\nSpoils System.\nIn US politics, the \"Spoils System\" was the practice of a political party giving its supporters positions in government. These government jobs were given as rewards and incentives (something that makes a person try harder) to keep working for the political party. \nJackson used the spoils system a lot when he was president. He rewarded his supporters and promised future jobs if local and state politicians joined his team. He believed in the theory of rotation in office, where people would only remain in a position for a short time. He believed that this would keep the civil service from becoming corrupt. Other leaders of the Democratic Party wanted to give civil service jobs to friends and loyal party members. In total, Jackson dismissed less than twenty percent (20%) of the original civil service. \nAs president, Jackson encouraged the use of the spoils system. It became an important part of the Second Party System and the Third Party System. The spoils system was ended in the 1890s."}

She died unmarried. She was known at court simple as \"Madame Victoire\".\nEarly years.\nVictoire, Daughter of France was born at the Palace of Versailles in 1733. As a daughter of the king of France she had the title of \"daughter of France\" which was highly prized within the royal family. She was the seventh child of ten. From birth she was known as \"Madame Quatri\u00e8me\", as she was not baptised. She was however eventually named Victoire Louise Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, being known simply by her first name. Unlike the older children in the royal family, Victoire was raised at the Palace of Versailles but only till the age of five when she left Versailles to live at \"Abbey of Fontevraud\" in northern France. Leaving in 1738 with her sisters Sophie and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se. The princesses left Versailles on 6 June 1738 accompanied by furniture and a military escort. \nLife at Versailles.\nAt the age of 15, 1748, she was allowed to return to the royal court. Her religious education stayed with her all her life and she would always remain close to her siblings and mother. Victoire arrived to a court which was dominated by the powerful Madame de Pompadour who had become Louis XV's mistress in 1745. Victoire was often described as the most beautiful of the kings daughters. The only project for marriage arose in 1753 when it was suggested that she marry King Ferdinand VI of Spain as his wife was seriously ill at the time. However she recovered and there were never any other projects. \nIn 1765, her older brother died of consumption at Fontainebleau at the age of 36. Victoire, like all of her sisters, mourned their brother greatly. As a result of his death, the future Louis XVI became the heir to the throne and the family was pushed closer together. Three years later, 1768, Versailles was again mourning, this time for the death of Queen Marie. The sadness within the royal family was worsened by the kings new passion for \"Madame du Barry\". The princesses redused to acknowledge the Barry and this caused friction within the court. However, at the death of Louis XV in 1774, Madame du Barry was exiled and Louis XVI came to the throne. Victoire and her sister Marie Ad\u00e9la\u00efde were close to the young king but did not like his wife \"Marie Antoinette\" purely because she was Austrian. \nLouis XV having died, Victoire and her sisters had to move out of their apartments and soon took up residence at the \"Ch\u00e2teau de Bellevue\" outside the capital. Victoire lived their with Marie Ad\u00e9la\u00efde and their younger sister Sophie and they redecorated the building to suit their tastes. Having no power at Versailles, the sisters began touring France at great expense which caused havoc for France's already bad finances. When Versailles was stormed, the sisters were at Bellevue and thus were not placed under house arrest. They quickly fled France and went to stay with their niece Marie Clotilde of France, (Turin) who was the wife of Charles Emmanuel IV of Sardinia. They then traveled to Rome in 1791 and soon ended up in Naples in 1796, home of Marie Antoinette's sister, the Queen of Naples. Moving to Corfu in 1799 followed by Trieste where Victoire eventually died of breast cancer. Marie Ad\u00e9la\u00efde died the following year in Rome. The two sisters were bought back to France during the reign of their nephew Louis XVIII and buried at the Basilica of Saint Denis. "}

He went to South Australia to map the geography and the location of minerals.\nBabbage was very thorough, and spent a lot of time making sure that his information was correct. He carried a lot of equipment, as well as four and half tonnes of food, enough to last 18 months in the desert. Among his supplies he had 20 kilograms of chocolate and 5000 litres of water. He also took a flock of 150 sheep, which limited the speed the group could move. The government became frustrated with Babbage's slow progress, they wanted to know about possible farm lands and valuable minerals as soon as possible. Eventually Babbage was removed from the job and replaced by Major Peter Warburton.\nBabbage later helped on the planning for the Australian Overland Telegraph Line. He was interested in growing grapes and retired to his large vineyard at St.Marys. He died on 20 October 1878, and is buried at St.Marys."}

Short day plants flower when the length of daylight falls below a certain critical level. \nIt is not actually the period of light exposure that limits flowering. Rather, a short day plant requires a minimal length of uninterrupted darkness in each 24-hour period (a short daylength) before floral development can begin. \nPlants make use of the phytochrome system to sense day length or photoperiod. This fact is used by florists and greenhouse gardeners to control and induce flowering out of season, such as with \"Poinsettia\"."}

They didn't speak in exactly the same way as the people they learned English from, instead they spoke in a distinct way, the Cornish dialect of English.

In the east, it is more like how people in Devon speak.\nDifferences between Cornish Dialect and 'proper' English.\nSometimes Cornish people use different words to people who speak 'proper' English. They might also say the words in a different order when they speak Cornish dialect from when they speak 'proper' English, which is a difference in grammar between Cornish dialect and 'proper' English. Other times, they say the same words in a different way using different vowel sounds from 'proper' English.\nDecline.\nWhen Cornish people started to go to school in the late 19th century, teachers told them to speak 'proper' English not dialect. A lot of people thought that people who spoke the dialect were not as intelligent and educated as those who spoke 'proper' English, so people spoke the dialect less, and the dialect declined. In the 20th century, a lot of people moved into Cornwall from the south east part of England near London. These people did not speak the Cornish dialect and found it hard to understand Cornish people who spoke it. The Cornish people spoke the dialect less because they did not want people not to be able to understand them.\nPreservation.\nAs fewer people spoke the Cornish dialect, other people, such as people in the Old Cornwall Society, wrote down the dialect, and made audio recordings, so the dialect wouldn't be lost.\nLiterature.\nPeople have written books, short stories, and poetry in Cornish Dialect."}

They grow faster than any other mammal bones. Growth occurs at the tip, and is initially cartilage, which is mineralized to become bone.

First, they can compete when males use their antlers as weapons to compete for mates; second, they can compete where males present their antlers to display their strength and fertility.

And 2,200 pressed British plants in Derby Museum and Art Gallery are also Whittaker's.\nBiography.\nEarly Days.\nWhittaker's exact birth date is not known. He was christened at Quarndon near Derby on 8 February 1813. His father was also named Joseph, and was a labourer who married to Sarah (born Clarke). The son is sometimes reported as being born in Breadsall in 1815.\nAustralian Botany.\nIn 1838 Whittaker went on a voyage to Austratia as \"gardener\". His new employer was Lt. Col. George Gawler who had recently been appointed as the second Governor of South Australia. Whittaker, seven other employees from Derbyshire, Gawler and his wife and children arrived on the Pestonjee Bomanjee on 12 October 1838 in Adelaide. They had traveled for four months via Rio de Janeiro. When Whittaker and Gawler arrived they found poor conditions so gardening was not important.\nWhittaker collected plants around Adelaide in South Australia in 1839-40. Whittaker traveled to places within South Australia where he collected a wide range of plant samples. These included Mount Lofty range, Mount Jagged, River Torrens, River Murray and the Hindmarsh River. Whittaker was the first person to collect from the mountainous district of the Fleurieu Peninsula, Encounter Bay and Mount Barker.\nWhittaker stayed in South Australia for nineteen months before sailing home on the \"Katherine Stuart Forbes\" which left from Port Adelaide on 11 April 1840. On the way home his boat stopped four times at Kangaroo Island, Mauritius, St Helena and Corvo Island in the Azores. Whittaker collected further plant samples while the boat was in these harbours.\nDerbyshire Botany.\nWhittaker arrived back in England on 23 September 1840 and by 1844 had begun collecting plants again. His activity peaked in 1851 and 52, ceasing sometime after 1867. He collected from many parts of Derbyshire, but he occasionally traveled outside the county including Bulwell, Nottinghamshire, Rhyl and Denbigh in Wales.\nBy 1846 he was living at Breadsall in Derbyshire where he was a teacher at Breadsall Boys School. From here he exchanged letters with Sir William J. Hooker Director of the Kew Botanic Gardens. Because Whittaker had planed to write a number of books on British botany, and needed to exchange some of his Australian and related samples for that. Whittaker collected about 300 plants that were eventually acquired by Kew. Whittaker's collections from outside the U.K. are now in Kew Gardens. Whittaker had the species of sundew \"Drosera whittakeri\" named after him.\nIn February 1847 Whittaker became a member of the Botanical Society of London and he swapped plant samples between 1849 to 1853 with its members. He then joined the Botanical Exchange Club and finally the Botanical Locality Record Club. By 1847 he had enough information to publish \u201ca list of rare plants found in the neighbourhood of Breadsall, Derbyshire\u201d. This contained a mixture of both rare and relatively common species, and gives a good information of the botanical variety of the area at that time. In 1857 he was the schoolmaster of ninety children at Breadsall in Derbyshire, a village whose inhabitants included the naturalists Rev. Henry Harpur Crewe and Francis Darwin. The school was funded by the Harpur-Crewe family.\nWhittaker lived in the small village of Morley near Derby in the late 1850s.\nHe lived with his wife Mary in the house named Ferriby Brook.\nHe continued to teach there, taking up to twelve scholars into his classes, usually after they had left the local school, and were between eight and eighteen years of age. He eventually established a large collection of living plants. Local gardener groups reported that he was growing over 1,300 different species. In 1864 he was publishing works referring the local extinction of the \"Lady's Slipper Orchid\" Cypripedium calceolus with the Rev. Henry Harpur Crewe. By 1871 he quitted a schoolmaster, and became a \u201cseedsman and florist\u201d. By 1881 successfully became a \u201cnurseryman and farmer\u201d. He lived with two servants and twenty year old William Whitehead in his house. Whitehead was to eventually become a partner in their market gardening venture.\nWhittaker\u2019s plant collecting activities began to decline around 1863, around the time his botanical partner, Henry Harpur Crewe, moved away to become the Rector of Drayton Beauchamp in Buckinghamshire. In the following year they cooperated in the production of a manuscript list of the principal flowering plants and ferns of Derbyshire. His partnership with Crewe lasted for at least eighteen years and was very productive. The Harpur Crewe's family lived nearby Calke Abbey and they had funded the school at Breadsall.\nIn the late 1880s Joseph Whittaker gave valuable assistance, and supplied a range of plant samples, to Rev W.H.Painter who was preparing to publish a book on the Flora of Derbyshire. Many of Whittaker\u2019s samples and records were also used by William Richardson Linton, vicar of Shirley in a further Flora of Derbyshire in 1903.\nWhittaker died on 2nd March 1894. By popular subscription, a memorial reading desk and engraved brass inscription were built for St Matthew's Church, Morley, where he was a church warden and where he was buried.\nLegacy.\nWhittaker's collection at Kew Gardens is from his trip to Australia and from ports where he stayed shortly during the way home. He also left a collection of 2,200 pressed plants in 79 volumes, mostly from Derbyshire, which are now held in the herbarium at Derby Museum and Art Gallery. They provide important evidential samples for local studies on the flora of Derbyshire. Due to his participation in botanical exchanges clubs, there are now Whittaker samples in many UK museum collections, including those at Bolton, Birmingham, Gloucester and Manchester. The Wisbech and Fenland Museum also has a small collection.\nThe carnivorous sundew species was scientifically described by the French botanist Jules \u00c9mile Planchon in 1848. This is commonly known as the \"Scented Sundew\" or \"Whittaker's Sundew\"."}

It is sometimes called the Barcoo River after one of its tributaries. It is one of three major Queensland river systems that flow into Lake Eyre. The water flow in Cooper Creek comes from monsoonal rains falling months earlier and many hundreds of kilometres away in eastern Queensland. At in length it is the second longest inland river system in Australia after the Murray-Darling system.\nHistory.\nCharles Sturt named the river in 1845 after Charles Cooper, the Chief Justice of South Australia. The explorers Burke and Wills died from starvation in 1861 on the banks of Cooper Creek. John King survived the expedition with help from the Aborigines. Only ten years after the explorers' deaths, homesteads were being built along the creek. A station (farm) at Innamincka was the first permanent settlement in the area.\nBy 1880 the reliable water source had attracted many settlers. The whole area was taken up and stocked with cattle. This pushed the local Aborigines from their traditional lands. By 1900 their population was just 30, only 10% of the original number, as influenza and measles took their toll.\nCourse.\nThe creek starts west of the Great Dividing Range as two rivers, the Thomson from near Longreach and Charters Towers, and the Barcoo in the area around Barcaldine, about inland from Rockhampton. \nCooper Creek spreads out into a vast area of channels, making its way south into the far south-west corner of Queensland before turning west into South Australia towards Lake Eyre. In most years, the water soaks into the earth, fills channels and waterholes, or simply evaporates without reaching Lake Eyre. In very wet years, however, it can flood the entire Channel Country and reach Lake Eyre after flowing through the Strzelecki Desert, Sturt Stony Desert and the Tirari Desert. Although the Cooper carries much more water than the Diamantina and the Georgina, it does not flow into Lake Eyre as often as those rivers. One reason is that much more water is lost than with the Diamantina or Georgina. During a flood Cooper Creek may be as wide as .\nLand use.\nMost of the land around the Cooper is used for sheep and cattle grazing on natural grasslands. The rainfall is not reliable enough to grow crops. The soils are quite fertile, though generally heavy in texture and often crack when they dry out."}

He was frequent champion and leading player in the sport. He is most well known for his skill at the game of straight pool (14.1 continuous). He won six world billiards titles in this game. \nEarly life.\nCrane became very interested in billiards when he was 11 years old. He started play on a toy pool table his brother received as a Christmas gift. His parents soon replaced their dining room table with a 4' by 8' pool table. Soon, Crane started to play in public at a local pool room. Crane could play all day and never get bored. He could not wait to get home from school and start to play pool.\nThough he taught himself to play, at age 14 he ran 89 balls in straight pool at a local pool room. He called each shot in advance. His parents replaced the smaller table with a full size tournament table. Over the next ten years some of the best players, including Willie Hoppe and Andrew Ponzi, came to practice with Crne. Despite consistent play throughout his teenage years, Crane did not enter any tournaments until he was 23 years old.\nIn February 1939, at age 26, Crane sank 150 balls in a row against his opponent in an exhibition straight pool match. The game was played on a difficult 5' by 10' table in Layton, Utah. This was impressive. But the crowd cheered him, and he continued to play. He finally put 309 consecutive balls thus shattering the previous world record of 244 consecutive balls.\nWorld titles.\nHe won his first world title in 1942. Over the next thirty years, Crane won almost two dozen major championships, including the World Crown in 1946, 1955, 1966, 1968, 1970 and 1972, the Ballantine International Championship in 1965, the International Roundrobin championship in 1968, and the World Series of Billiards in 1978 at age 65. At the 1966 World Crown tournament, he ran 150 and out in the finals. He never let his opponent back to the table after an early safety battle. No other player has ever done this. Crane also holds the record for the most runner-up finishes for the World Crown with 13.\nCrane found it hard to make a living only by playing pool, even though he was very skilled. In 1957, he began working as a Cadillac salesman at a dealership in Rochester, New York. He continued there for 17 years. At Rochester's annual auto show his dealership's exhibit had a pool table. Crane would run balls while answering questions. Working at a regular job was not Crane's first choice. In an interview with Sports Illustrated in 1969, he said \"If I had to make a choice between selling cars and playing pool, I'd choose pool... The only time I've ever been really happy is when I was at a pool table.\"\nHe was \"tall, lean man with the imperial bearing of the headmaster of Eton,\" Crane got the nickname \"The Deacon\" because of his gentlemanly ways, his very cautious approach to the game and his careful style of clothing. He always wore a conservative suit when he played. \nConservative style.\nThe \"Los Angeles Times\" interviewed Crane's wife Althea. They were married 64 years. She said, \"A lot of people, if it was a hot day and there was no air conditioning, they'd take off their coat to play. But not Irving Crane.\" Minnesota Fats, once said, \"Irv Crane would have been the only guy to notice the horse under Lady Godiva\". Willie Mosconi criticized Crane for his cautious style. He wrote in his 1993 autobiography, \"Willie's Game\", that \"Crane wouldn't take a shot unless his grandmother could make it.\" \nLater life.\nCrane became a member of the Billiard Congress of America's hall of fame in 1978. In 1999, Crane was number eight on \"Billiard Digest's\" fifty greatest players of the century. In 1980 Crane retired from professional play. He stopped playing entirely in about 1996. On 17 November 17 2001, four days after entering a nursing home, Crane died of natural causes. He was 88 years old."}

In 1844 Leichhardt led a small group from Moreton Bay in the south east corner of Queensland west to Port Essington in the Northern Territory. This was a trip of 4,828\u00a0km. They returned to Sydney by boat. He was presented with the Patrons Gold Medal by the Royal Geographical Society in London.\nIn 1848 he set out to cross the continent from east to west. He believed he could go north around the deserts to the coast of Western Australia, and then follow the coast south to the Swan River. After leaving the Darling Downs, Leichhardt's group disappeared. Many people searched, and there were stories about marked trees, or found items, but nothing was proved. \nIn 2006 a small piece of brass with Leichhardt's name on it proved to be a genuine item from the explorer. It had been found in 1900 by an Aboriginal stockman in Western Australia, close to the Northern Territory border, in the area between the Great Sandy Desert and the Tanami Desert."}

This is an animal characteristic. Most have chloroplasts, which are characteristic of algae and plants.\nEuglenids are believed to descend from an ancestor that took up green algae by secondary endosymbiosis.\nOver 1,000 species of \"Euglena\" have been described, and there are more to be discovered. Their relationships are being analysed.\nForm and function.\nWhen acting as a heterotroph (animal), the \"Euglena\" surrounds a particle of food and consumes it by phagocytosis. When acting as an autotroph, the \"Euglena\" has chloroplasts which produce sugars by photosynthesis. The chloroplasts use the pigments chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b.\nThe number and shape of chloroplasts within \"Euglena\" varies greatly. \"Euglena\" are able to move through aquatic environments by using a large flagellum for locomotion. To detect light, the cell has an eyespot, a primitive organelle that filters sunlight into light-detecting, photo-sensitive structures. These structures, at the base of the flagellum, allow only certain wavelengths of light to register. With the aid of this photo-sensitive area, the \"Euglena\" can shift its position to get better photosynthesis. \nThe mobility of \"Euglena\" also allows hunting. Most \"Euglena\" are considered mixotrophs: autotrophs in sunlight and heterotrophs in the dark. \"Euglena\" do not have plant cell walls, but have a pellicle instead. The pellicle is made of protein bands that spiral down the length of the \"Euglena\" and lie beneath the plasma membrane.\n\"Euglena\" can survive in fresh and salt water. In low moisture conditions, \"Euglena\" forms a protective wall around itself and lies dormant as a spore until environmental conditions improve. \"Euglena\" can also survive in the dark by storing starch-like paramylon granules inside the chloroplast.\nReproduction.\n\"Euglenas\" reproduce asexually by binary fission. There is no evidence of sexual reproduction. Reproduction includes transverse division and longitudinal division, which both occur in the active and encysted forms. \nAs a food source.\nStarting in 2005, the Tokyo-based Euglena Company now markets \"Euglena\"-based food and beverage products. The fitness of \"Euglena\" for human consumption had been thought about before, but this is the first attempt to cultivate and farm it. The company's main production facility is on Ishigaki Island, Okinawa, where there is a favourable climate.\nEuglena Company is also experimenting with the use of \"Euglena\" as a potential fuel source."}

As coach he coached the Austrian national football team, helping the team reach third place in the 1954 FIFA World Cup.\nCareer.\nOver two minor clubs Nausch came 1923 to FK Austria Wien, then named Wiener Amateur-SV. Other than most of the players in the pre-war eara Nausch came out of Viennas middle classes. In 1924 he reached the Austrian championship which stayed to only championship he reached.

He did not play the 1934 FIFA World Cup because he was ehavyly injured in a match versus Bulgaria.\nAfter the occupation of Austria in 1938 Austria Vienna was suppressed by the Nazi authoritys mainly because there were a lot of players and officials of Jewish origin. The Name was forbidden and they played under the name Sportclub Ostmark. Protected by his popularity Nausch often showed his disfavour of the nazis. As Nausch wanted to coach the team he was ordered by the authoritys to leave his wife who was of Jewish origin. He did not and fled to Switzerland. He became coach and player of Z\u00fcrcher Young Fellows. \n1948 Nausch came back to Austria and became coach of the Austrian national football team. He stayed with the team from 1948 till 1954. He formed a team with stars like Zeman, Happel, Hanappi, Ocwirk, Probst und Stojaspal. This team was almost so successful like the old \"Wunderteam\". In this time Austria reached the third place in the FIFA World Cup 1954 the best place an Austrian team reached ever. After being coach of the team he went to his old team FK Austria Wien which he coached from 1954 till 1955. \nHe died in 1957 because of a heart attack."}

To represent a population proportion, the letter formula_2 can be used.\nProportionality constant.\nA proportionality constant is a number that is used to convert a measurement in one system to the equivalent measurement in another system. For instance, people who are familiar with the traditional system of units used in the United States (pounds, feet, inches, etc.) may need to find out the metric equivalent for these measures in grams and meters. To make these calculations, they would need some proportionality constants.\nOne way to write a formula showing how to use a proportionality constant K is:\nKX = Y\nFor example, people may know that they have 100 eggs and want to know how many dozen eggs they have.

The set has 13 volumes, or sections, and has been printed often as 13 physical books (numbered I-XIII), rather than one large book. It has been translated into Latin, with the title \"Euclidis Elementorum\". It is the most famous mathmetical text from ancient times.\nEuclid collected together all that was known of geometry in his time. His \"Elements\" is the main source of ancient geometry. Textbooks based on Euclid have been used up to the present day. In the book, he starts out from a small set of axioms (that is, a group of things that everyone thinks are true). Euclid then shows the properties of geometric objects and of whole numbers, based on those axioms.\nThe \"Elements\" also includes works on perspective, conic sections, spherical geometry, and possibly quadric surfaces. Apart from geometry, the work also includes number theory. Euclid came up with the idea of \"greatest common divisors\". They were in his \"Elements\". The greatest common divisor of two numbers is the greatest number that can divide evenly into both of the two numbers.\nThe geometrical system described in the \"Elements\" was long known simply as \"geometry\" and was considered to be the only geometry possible. Today, that system is referred to as \"Euclidean geometry\", to distinguish it from other so-called \"non-Euclidean geometries\" which mathematicians discovered in the 19th century.\nAdded volumes XIV and XV.\nOccasionally in ancient times, writings were attributed to celebrated authors but were not written by them. It is in this way that the apocryphal books XIV and XV of the Elements were sometimes included in the collection. The spurious Book XIV was probably written by Hypsicles on the basis of a treatise by Apollonius of Perga. The book continues Euclid's comparison of regular solids inscribed in spheres. The chief result is that the ratio of the surfaces of the dodecahedron and icosahedron inscribed in the same sphere is the same as the ratio of their volumes.\nThe spurious Book XV was probably written, at least in part, by Isidore of Miletus. This book covers topics such as counting the number of edges and solid angles in the regular solids, and finding the measure of dihedral angles of faces that meet at an edge.\nEditions.\nCurrently in print.\n\"Euclid's Elements \u2013 All thirteen books in one volume\", based on Heath's translation, Green Lion Press, .\n\"The Elements: Books I-XIII-Complete and Unabridged\" (2006), translated by Sir Thomas Heath, Barnes &amp; Noble, ."}

This has been recognized since the 1930s. Recent genomic sequence data show that duplicated genes are common in all organisms surveyed. \nOrigin.\nIn classical genetics it may occur as an error in crossing-over during meiosis, or the duplication of an entire chromosome.\nIn non-classical genetics it may happen by a retrotransposition event.\nImplications.\nThe second copy of the gene is often relatively free from selective pressure. Mutations of it have no deleterious effects to its host organism. Thus it accumulates mutations faster than a functional single-copy gene, over generations.\nA duplication is the opposite of a deletion. Duplications arise from unequal crossing-over that occurs during meiosis between misaligned homologous chromosomes. The product of this recombination are a duplication at the site of the exchange and a reciprocal deletion.\nEvolutionary importance.\nGene duplication is believed to play a major role in evolution; this idea was first suggested 100 years ago. Susumu Ohno was one of the most famous developers of this theory in his classic book \"Evolution by gene duplication\" (1970). Ohno argued that gene duplication is the most important evolutionary force since the emergence of the last universal common ancestor (LUCA).\nMajor genome duplication events are not uncommon. It is believed that the entire yeast genome underwent duplication about 100 million years ago. Plants are the most prolific genome duplicators. For example, wheat is hexaploid (a kind of polyploid), meaning that it has six copies of its genome.\nNormally, a big change in gene function is resisted because the original function is needed, but after a duplication one gene carries on the original function. Therefore, a change of function in the second copy is possible without loss of fitness.\nThis freedom from consequences allows for more mutations to be 'carried' in the population. Some of these might increase the fitness of the organism or code for a new function. \nThe two genes that exist after a gene duplication event are called paralogs and usually code for proteins with a similar function and/or structure. By contrast, orthologous genes are ones which code for proteins with similar functions but exist in different species, and are created from species-splitting."}

In 2006 the population was 629.\nIt is in the middle of a farming area that grows wheat and raises sheep, but Gladstone is important because it has lots of very big buildings to store wheat, barley, durum wheat, peas, faba beans and fiesta beans. All together, these buildings store the biggest amount of grains in the Southern Hemisphere in a place not by the sea.\nRailways.\nThe railways are important to Gladstone so the grains can be moved to the sea and put on ships. The nearest place where this happens is Port Pirie. \nThe railways are also important to move the grains to the big cities in Australia. Gladstone is on the biggest railway line in Australia that goes between Sydney in the east and Perth in the west. Railway lines also go south to Adelaide, and north to other small towns. Now, all of the railway lines are 4\u00a0ft 8 1\u20442 in (1,435\u00a0mm) apart. This is called standard gauge. Before 1970, the railway lines going north were 3\u00a0ft 6 in (1,067\u00a0mm) apart (narrow gauge), and the railway lines going south were 5\u00a0ft 3 in (1,600\u00a0mm) apart (broad gauge).

It is also the headquarters of the BBC itself and contains the offices of key figures within the organisation, such as the Director General.\nConstruction.\nThe Original Construction of Broadcasting House took place in 1932, and opened on the 14 May 1932, 8 years after the corporation was created and was built as a housing for all their current operations, of offices and radio operations. Architect George Val Myer designed the building in collaboration with the BBC's civil engineer, M T Tudsbery. The original interiors were the work of the Australian-Irish architect Raymond McGrath. He set up and directed a team that included Serge Chermayeff and Wells Coates and designed the vaudeville studio, the associated green and dressing rooms, and the dance and chamber music studios in a flowing Art Deco style. It was later said of his efforts that \"the designs for the BBC gave the first real fillip to industrial design in England\".\nThe building was designed with the radio elements, such as the studios, in a central location constructed of Portland stone. The remainder of the building was steel framed and faced with Portland stone on the outside. These areas housed the offices, so that they could be both away from the noise of the radio operations, and have access to daylight. Issues with local residents also caused the structure to be changed: The east side of the building blocked out the light to local residents, and after complaints and seeking the right of ancient lights, the building was changed so that the East side of the building had a sloped roof. The building also faced issues with the fact that both the Bakerloo and the Victoria lines of the London Underground, as well as sewers 100 years old ran under the site.\nThe building also incorporated other elements, the ground floor of the building was fitted with floor to ceiling windows overlooking the street, as it was believed that to finance such a project (costing \u00a325,000,000 in today's money) they would need to rent out the ground floor as a retail unit. This however never occurred, as the Corporation expanded so quickly the space was needed by the BBC."}

On Halloween 1963 in Illinois, six year old Michael Myers murders his sister. Fifteen years later, he escapes from a psychiatric hospital, returns home, and stalks teenager Laurie Strode and her friends.\nIt was remade in 2007. The movie's script was created and the movie was filmed in under twenty days.\nPlot.\nOn Halloween night 1963, in the town of Haddonfield, Illinois, six-year-old Michael Myers, dressed in a clown costume, stabs his older sister Judith to death with a kitchen knife in their home. Fifteen years later, on October 30, 1978, Michael's psychiatrist, Dr. Samuel Loomis, and his colleague, Marion Chambers, arrive at Warren County's Smith's Grove Sanitarium to escort Michael to court. Michael escapes the sanitarium, stealing Loomis' car in the process, and returning home to Haddonfield.\nOn the road, Michael kills a mechanic for his coveralls. He then steals a mask, knives, and rope from a local hardware store. The following day, on Halloween, Michael begins stalking high school student Laurie Strode after she drops off a key at his former house, so her father can sell it. Throughout the day, Laurie notices Michael following her, but her best friends Annie Brackett and Lynda Van der Klok dismiss her concerns. Loomis arrives in Haddonfield in search of Michael, visiting Judith's grave in the local cemetery, only to find her tombstone stolen. He meets with Haddonfield's sheriff, Leigh Brackett, Annie's father, and they both go to Michael's house, where Loomis tries to convince Sheriff Brackett about the danger Michael poses. Sheriff Brackett patrols the streets while Loomis waits at the house, expecting Michael to return.\nLater that night, Laurie babysits Tommy Doyle, while Annie babysits Lindsey Wallace just across the street, unaware that Michael has followed them. When Annie's boyfriend, Paul, calls her to come and pick him up, she takes Lindsey over to the Doyle house to spend the night with Laurie and Tommy. Annie is just about to leave in her car when Michael, who had hidden in the back seat, strangles her and slits her throat. Soon after, Lynda and her boyfriend Bob Simms arrive at the Wallace house. After having sex, Bob goes downstairs to get a beer for Lynda, but Michael fatally stabs him. Michael then poses as Bob in a ghost costume and confronts Lynda, who teases him, to no effect. Annoyed, Lynda calls Laurie, but Michael strangles Lynda with the telephone wire just as Laurie picks up. Meanwhile, Loomis discovers the stolen car and begins searching the streets.\nSuspicious, Laurie goes over to the Wallace house, and finds the bodies of Annie, Bob, and Lynda in an upstairs bedroom, as well as Judith Myers' headstone. Horrified, Laurie cowers in a hallway, when Michael suddenly appears and attacks her, slashing her arm. Barely escaping, Laurie flees back to the Doyle house. Michael follows, but Laurie manages to fend him off long enough for Tommy and Lindsey to escape, defending herself by stabbing him with a knitting needle, a metal hanger, and his own knife. Loomis sees Tommy and Lindsey fleeing the house, and investigates and sees Michael attacking Laurie. Loomis shoots Myers off the balcony; when Loomis goes to check Michael's body, he finds it missing. Loomis stares off into the night, while Laurie begins sobbing in terror. As various shots of the Doyle and Wallace houses are displayed, the Myers house is shown, as sounds of Michael's breathing are heard, leaving his whereabouts in further doubt."}

Gibson was a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority.\nBiography.\nAlthea Gibson was born at 9:00\u00a0am EDT on August 25, 1927 in Silver, Clarendon County, South Carolina to Daniel and Annie Bell Gibson. Althea had two siblings, a brother, Daniel Jr. (known as \"Bubba\") and a sister, Mildred.\nGibson played tennis while going to school for an education. In 1946, she moved to Wilmington, North Carolina, to work on her tennis game with Dr. Hubert A. Eaton and enrolled at Williston High School.\nIn 1958, Gibson retired from amateur tennis. Before the open era of tennis began, there was no prize money, other than an expense allowance, and no endorsement contracts. To begin earning prize money, tennis players had to give up their amateur status. As there was no professional tour for women, Gibson was limited to playing in a series of exhibition tours.\nAccording to Lance Tingay of \"The Daily Telegraph\" and the \"Daily Mail\", Gibson was ranked in the world top ten from 1956 through 1958, reaching a career high of No. 1 in those rankings in 1957 and 1958. Gibson was included in the year-end top ten rankings issued by the United States Tennis Association in 1952 and 1953 and from 1955 through 1958. She was the top-ranked U.S. player in 1957 and 1958. In 1957 Althea became the first African American woman to win Wimbledon. She won again in 1958. In 1958, she appeared as the celebrity challenger on the TV panel show \"What's My Line?\".\nIn retirement, Gibson wrote her autobiography and in 1959 recorded an album, \"Althea Gibson Sings\", as well as appearing in the motion picture, \"The Horse Soldiers.\" In 1964, she became the first African American woman to play in the Ladies Professional Golf Association. However, she was too old to be successful and only played for a few years.\nIn 1971, Gibson was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame, and in 1975, she was appointed the New Jersey state commissioner of athletics. After 10 years on the job, she went on to work in other public service positions, including serving on the governor's council on physical fitness. In later years, she suffered two cerebral aneurysms and, in 1992, a stroke. A few years later, Gibson called her former doubles partner Angela Buxton and told her she was considering suicide, as she was living on welfare and unable to pay for rent or medication. Buxton arranged for a letter to appear in a tennis magazine. Buxton told Gibson nothing about the letter, but the latter received nearly US $1 million from around the world.\nGibson was married twice. Her first marriage to William Darben took place on October 17, 1965, but the couple was divorced in 1976, eleven years later. Darben died in 1995. She was also married to Sydney Llewellyn on April 11, 1983 and was divorced from him in 1988.\nOn September 28, 2003, at the age of 76, Gibson died in East Orange, New Jersey due to infections. She was buried there in the Rosedale Cemetery, at Orange, New Jersey.\nOn the opening night of the 2007 US Open, the 50th anniversary of Gibson's victory at the US Championships in 1957 (now the US Open), Gibson was inducted into US Open Court of Champions. She was a 1994 inductee of the Sports Hall of Fame of New Jersey and 2009 inductee of the New Jersey Hall of Fame. In September 2009, the City of Wilmington, NC named its new community tennis complex the Althea Gibson Tennis Center.\nGolf.\nGibson became the first African American woman to join the Ladies Professional Golf Association tour, in 1964. Her best finish on the tour was a tie for second after a three-way playoff at the 1970 Len Immke Buick Open. Gibson retired from professional golf at the end of the 1978 season.\nGrand Slam singles tournament timeline.\nA = did not participate in the tournament\nSR = the ratio of the number of Grand Slam singles tournaments won to the number of those tournaments played"}

There is strong support for the theory that all living organisms on Earth are descended from a common ancestor.\nCharles Darwin proposed the theory of universal common descent through an evolutionary process in \"On the Origin of Species\", saying, \"There is a grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one\".p490\nThe last universal ancestor (LUA) (or last universal common ancestor, LUCA), that is viewed by evolutionary theory to be most recent common ancestor of all currently living organisms, is believed to have appeared about 3.9 billion years ago.\nHistory.\nIn the 1740s, Pierre-Louis Maupertuis made the first known suggestion that all organisms may have had a common ancestor, and that they had diverged through random variation and struggle for existence. In \"Essai de Cosmologie\", Maupertuis noted:\nCould one not say that, in the fortuitous combinations of the productions of nature, as there must be some characterized by a certain relation of fitness which are able to subsist, it is not to be wondered at that this fitness is present in all the species that are currently in existence? Chance, one would say, produced an innumerable multitude of individuals; a small number found themselves constructed in such a manner that the parts of the animal were able to satisfy its needs; in another infinitely greater number, there was neither fitness nor order: all of these latter have perished... The species we see today are but the smallest part of what blind destiny has produced...\nEvidence of universal common descent.\nCommon biochemistry and genetic code.\nAll known forms of life are based on the same fundamental biochemical organisation.\nGenetic information is encoded in DNA, and transcribed into RNA, then translated into proteins by (highly similar) ribosomes, with ATP, NADH and others as energy sources, etc.\nThe similarities include the energy carrier adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and the fact that all amino acids found in proteins are left-handed (chirality).\nFurthermore, the genetic code (the \"translation table\" according to which DNA information is translated into proteins) is nearly identical for all known lifeforms, from bacteria to humans.\nThe universality of this code is generally regarded by biologists as definitive evidence in favor of the theory of universal common descent. Analysis of the small differences in the genetic code has also provided support for universal common descent. A statistical comparison of various alternative hypotheses has shown that universal common ancestry is significantly more probable than models involving multiple origins.\nPhylogenetic trees.\nAnother important piece of evidence is that it is possible to construct detailed phylogenetic trees (that is, \"genealogic trees\" of species) mapping out the proposed divisions and common ancestors of all living species. In 2010 an analysis of available genetic data, mapping them to phylogenetic trees, gave \"firm quantitative support for the unity of life. ...there is now strong quantitative support, by a formal test, for the unity of life.\nTraditionally, these trees have been built using morphological methods, such as comparative anatomy, embryology, etc. Recently, it has been possible to construct these trees using molecular data, based on similarities and differences between genetic and protein sequences. All these methods produce essentially similar results. That phylogenetic trees based on different types of information agree with each other is strong evidence of an underlying common descent.\nLast universal common ancestor.\nSome things are deduced about LUCA or LUA. It was not the very first cell, but one whose descendants survived beyond the very early stages of microbial evolution. On the basis of their presence in eubacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes, about 325 proteins were present in the LUCA.\nThese amino acids were probably the first to be built into proteins: alanine, asparagine, aspartic acid, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, serine, threonine, and valine. These amino acids were also found in spark tube simulations, and analysis of the Murchison meteorite. The other amino acids, later additions to the genetic code, include several of the most complex amino acids.\nStudies from 2000 to 2018 have suggested an increasingly ancient time for LUCA. In 2000, estimations suggested LUCA existed 3.5 to 3.8\u00a0billion years ago in the Paleoarchean era, a few hundred million years before the earliest fossil evidence of life, for which there are several candidates ranging in age from 3.48 to 4.28 billion years ago. \nA 2018 study from the University of Bristol, using a molecular clock model, puts the LUCA shortly after 4.5\u00a0billion years ago, in the Hadean era."}

For example, if the temperature is and the calculated humidex is 40, then that means the humid heat feels like a dry temperature of . The index is widely used in Canadian weather reports during summer to give the discomfort level.\nAccording to the Meteorological Service of Canada, a humidex of at least 30 causes \"some discomfort\", at least 40 causes \"great discomfort\" and above 45 is \"dangerous\". When the humidex hits 54, then heat stroke is very near.\nThe current formula for getting the humidex (see below: Humidex formula) was developed by J.M. Masterton and F.A. Richardson of Canada's Atmospheric Environment Service in 1979. The humidex differs from the heat index used in the United States, in being derived from the dew point rather than the relative humidity.\nThe record highest humidex in Canada occurred on July 25, 2007, when Carman, Manitoba hit 53.0. That number broke the previous record of 52.1 set during 1953 in Windsor, Ontario (The residents of Windsor would not have known it at the time, since the humidex had yet to be invented).\nHumidex formula.\nWhen the temperature is 30 \u00b0C (86 \u00b0F) and the dew point is 15 \u00b0C (59 \u00b0F), the humidex is 34. Note how humidex is a dimensionless number, but it indicates an approximate temperature in \u00b0C. If the temperature remains and the dew point rises to , the humidex rises to 42. The humidex tends to be higher than the U.S. heat index at equal temperature and relative humidity.\nThe humidex formula is as follows:\nComplete:"}

The result is also known as the \"felt air temperature\" or \"apparent temperature\". For example, when the temperature is with very high humidity, the heat index can be about .\nThe human body normally cools itself by perspiration, or sweating, which evaporates and carries heat away from the body. However, when the relative humidity is high, then the evaporation rate is reduced, so heat is removed from the body at a lower rate, causing it to retain more heat than it would in dry air. Measurements have been taken based on subjective descriptions of how hot subjects feel for a given temperature and humidity, allowing an index to be made which relates one temperature and humidity combination, to another, at a higher temperature in drier air.\nThe heat index was developed in 1978 by George Winterling as the \"humiture\" and was adopted by the National Weather Service a year later. It is derived from work carried out by Robert G. Steadman. Like the wind chill index, the heat index contains assumptions about the human body mass and height, clothing, amount of physical activity, thickness of blood, sunlight and ultraviolet radiation exposure, and the wind speed. Large deviations from the typical values will result in heat-index values which do not accurately reflect the perceived temperature.\nIn Canada, the similar humidex is used in place of the heat index. The humidex differs from the heat index in using the dew point rather than the relative humidity.\nThe heat index is defined so as to equal the actual air temperature when the partial pressure of water vapor is equal to a baseline value of 1.6 kPa. At standard atmospheric pressure (101.325 kPa), this baseline corresponds to a dew point of 14 \u00b0C (57 \u00b0F) and a mixing ratio of 0.01 (10\u00a0g of water vapor per kilogram of dry air). This corresponds to an air temperature of 25\u00b0C and relative humidity of 50% in the sea-level psychrometric chart.\nAt high temperatures, the level of \"relative\" humidity needed to make the heat index higher than the actual temperature is lower than at cooler temperatures. For example, at approximately 27 \u00b0C (80 \u00b0F), the heat index will agree with the actual temperature if the relative humidity is 45%, but at about 43\u00b0C (110\u00b0F), any relative-humidity reading above 17% will make the Heat Index higher than 43\u00b0C (110 \u00b0F).\nThe heat index is calculated only if the actual temperature is above 27 \u00b0C (80 \u00b0F), dew point temperatures greater than 12 \u00b0C (54 \u00b0F), and relative humidities higher than 40%. The heat index and humidex figures are based on temperature measurements taken in the shade and not the sun, so extra care must be taken while in the sun.\nSometimes the heat index and the wind chill are denoted collectively by the single terms \"apparent temperature\" or \"relative outdoor temperature\"."}

It is the first film with the character Hannibal Lecter, a psychotic killer. It is based on a book by Thomas Harris, called \"Red Dragon\". The movie was written and directed by Michael Mann. It stars William Petersen, Brian Cox, Dennis Farina and Tom Noonan. It tells the story of a serial killer and the detectives who are trying to find him.\n\"Manhunter\" shows the science that police use to find criminals. This movie was not the only movie made from a book by Thomas Harris. Earlier, \"Black Sunday\" had been made, but not with the character of Lector. Later, \"The Silence of the Lambs\", \"Hannibal\", \"Red Dragon\" and \"Hannibal Rising\" were also made from his books.\n\"Manhunter\" did not get very good reviews when it came out. It did not make a lot of money in cinemas. It took $15 million to make \"Manhunter\" but the movie only made $8.6 million in the United States. Today the movie gets better reviews and is seen by more people. It is thought of as a 'cult movie'.\nStory.\nWill Graham (William Petersen) is an agent who worked for the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He retired after he caught a killer named Hannibal Lecter (Brian Cox). Graham is asked by Jack Crawford (Dennis Farina) to help with a new police case. Crawford is trying to find a killer named \"The Tooth Fairy\". Graham goes to the house of the killer's victims. He finds The Tooth Fairy's fingerprints there.\nGraham goes to a prison to meet Hannibal Lector again. Lector is very good at understanding how other people think. Graham asks him for help. It is clear that Graham is afraid of Lecter. Later on, a prison guard finds a letter that belongs to Lecter. The letter is from The Tooth Fairy. Graham and Crawford find out that The Tooth Fairy is talking to Lecter through advertisements in a newspaper. Graham asks a journalist from the newspaper to write an article despising the Tooth Fairy. They feel sure this will result in another advertisement, and this time they will pick up the code. The journalist is caught by The Tooth Fairy (Tom Noonan) and killed.\nThe Tooth Fairy, called \"Francis Dollarhyde\", works in a photographic lab. He is attracted to a woman he works with called Reba McClane. Reba is blind. Dollarhyde drives her home one night. They start a relationship with each other. This stops Dollarhyde from killing more people. One night Dollarhyde sees Reba with another man. He thinks she is having an affair but he is mistaken. Dollarhyde kills the other man and takes Reba to his house.\nGraham has found out how The Tooth Fairy finds his victims. The Tooth Fairy uses the home movies brought to his job to pick a family to kill. Now that he knows this, Graham is able to find out who The Tooth Fairy is. He goes to Dollarhyde's house with several policemen. Dollarhyde uses a shotgun to kill some of the policemen. Graham kills Dollarhyde and rescues Reba.\nProduction.\nThe movie was going to be named \"Red Dragon\" because this was the name of the book. The name was changed because it sounded like a karate movie. It was also changed because a movie named \"Year of the Dragon\" did very badly in cinemas.\nWilliam Petersen worked with policemen in Chicago and with the Federal Bureau of Investigation to learn more about his part. Michael Mann took three years to write the movie, and he also spoke to policemen to learn about their jobs. Because of this, books have said the movie is very true to real life.\nTom Noonan started getting ready for the movie by reading about other serial killers. He did not like this idea when he started. He changed his mind and acted his own way instead. He said he wanted The Tooth Fairy to seem like \"he was doing this out of love\". Joan Allen played Dollarhyde's blind girlfriend. She went to the New York Institute for the Blind to learn about blind people. She walked with a mask on to learn about being blind.\nActors John Lithgow, Mandy Patinkin, William Friedkin and Brian Dennehy were all asked to play Hannibal Lecktor. Brian Cox played the part instead. Cox read about a Scottish serial killer named Peter Manuel to learn about his part. William Petersen played Will Graham. He was chosen because Michael Mann liked his movie \"To Live and Die in L.A.\". Richard Gere, Mel Gibson and Paul Newman were also asked to play the part. Tom Noonan says he was asked to act his part because Michael Mann thought he was very scary in real life.\nDante Spinotti, who filmed the movie, made use of strong colors. Parts of the movie with Will Graham and his wife use a \"romantic blue\". Parts that show The Tooth Fairy use an ugly green or purple color.\nWhen the move was being made, Tom Noonan asked that nobody saw him. Those people who could saw him called him \"Francis\", because he pretended to be his character the whole time. This made the other actors afraid of him. The first time Noonan met William Petersen was when Petersen jumped through a large window while making the last part of the movie. At first, actor Tom Noonan wore a fake tattoo of a dragon on his chest. The parts of the movie that showed this were made again without the tattoo. This is because Michael Mann and Tom Noonan thought it did not look right.\nSoundtrack.\n\"Manhunter\"'s soundtrack album came out in 1986. It could be bought on cassette, tape and vinyl record but not on CD. In March 2010, the soundtrack came out on CD for the first time. One more song, named \"Jogger's Stakeout\" by The Reds, was on the CD.\nMusic in the film's screen credits which are not listed above included:\nThemes.\nBooks written about the movie discuss the relationship between Graham and The Tooth Fairy. They make a comparison between the characters and how they both live. It has also been said that movie gives the idea that to catch a killer you must think like one.\nRelease.\nBox office.\n\"Manhunter\" came out in the United States on 15 August 1986. It earned $8,620,929 in the United States. Its budget was $15 million, so it did not make as much money as it cost. It was shown in November 1987 during the London Film Festival and came out in the United Kingdom on 24 February 1989. In France, the movie was shown on 9 April 1987 at the Cognac Festival du Film Policier. It won the Critics Prize at this festival. It was also shown at the 2009 Camerimage Film Festival in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Poland. On 19 March 2011, the movie was showne at Grauman's Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood for its 25th anniversary. Michael Mann answered questions at this event.\nHome media.\n\"Manhunter\" came out on laserdisc in 1986. It also came out on VHS several times. It came out on DVD first in 2000. This DVD was made by Anchor Bay Entertainment and it could be bought with one disc or two discs. A different DVD also came out in 2003. In 2004, MGM also made a DVD of the movie. In 2007, \"The Hannibal Lecter Collection\" came out. This was a collection of \"Manhunter\", \"The Silence of the Lambs\" and \"Hannibal\". \"The Hannibal Lector Collection\" also came out on Blu-ray in September 2009.\nReception.\nWhen \"Manhunter\" came out, its reviews were not very good.\nReviews thought that the music and the color effects were not very good. William Petersen's acting was also thought of negatively. The \"New York Times\" thought the movie was very bad, and so did the \"Chicago Tribune\". The \"Los Angeles Times\" said the movie was too much like Michael Mann's television program \"Miami Vice\"; and so did \"Film Threat\", who thought that was why the movie did not do very well. The \"San Francisco Chronicle\" did not like the movie's acting. On the other hand, \"Time\" magazine liked the movie. It called \"Manhunter\" \"bold\" and \"intelligent.\" Leonard Maltin liked the movie, and called it \"gripping\".\nToday, the reviews for the movie are much better. Salon.com says it is the best Hannibal movie. \"Slate\" magazine also thought it was very good, and said it inspired television programs like \"Millennium\" and '. \"The Independent\", Film4, Sky Movies, BBC, \"Total Film magazine and \"Empire\" magazine have all praised the movie as being very good. Television channel Bravo put the movie in a program named \"30 Even Scarier Movie Moments\" in 2007. The website UGO Networks thought that Tom Noonan's acting in \"Manhunter\" was the best he has done.\nToday, \"Manhunter\" is more popular. It is thought of as a 'cult movie'. This new popularity might be because of the other Hannibal movies doing very well. The websites Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes compare the modern reviews of the movie and give an average review. Metacritic used ten reviews to give \"Manhunter\" a score of 78 out of 100. Rotten Tomatoes used 33 reviews to give the movie a score of 94 out of 100.\nEffects of the movie.\n\"Manhunter\" shows how police use forensic science to catch criminals. This has inspired other movies and television programs. These include \"\", \"Millennium\", \"John Doe\", \"Profiler\", and \"The X-Files\"; as well as movies such as \"Copycat\", \"Switchback\", \"The Bone Collector\", \"Seven\" and \"Fallen\".\n\"The Silence of the Lambs\" came out in 1991. It was based on a different book by Thomas Harris. It earned many awards, including the Academy Award for Best Picture. It is one of only three movies that have won the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Actress, and Best Screenplay. After \"The Silence of the Lambs\", three more Hannibal movies came out. These were \"Hannibal\", \"Red Dragon\" and \"Hannibal Rising\".\nThe 2002 movie \"Red Dragon\" was based on the same book as \"Manhunter\". It made much more money than \"Manhunter\" did. It earned $209,196,298 and it cost $78 million to film it. Rotten Tomatoes used 183 reviews to give \"Red Dragon\" a score of 68 out of 100. Metacritic used 36 reviews to give it a score of 60 out of 100. The same man, Dante Spinotti, did the filming for both movies."}

The spots appear to be white, and the name was based on Jupiter's Great Red Spot. The spots can be several thousands of kilometers wide. Currently, a large band of white clouds called the Northern Electrostatic Disturbance (because of an increase in radio and plasma interference) has covered Saturn since 2010, and the Cassini orbiter is tracking the storm. Cassini information shows a loss of acetylene in the white clouds, an increase of phosphine, and an unusual temperature drop in the center of the storm. In April 2011, the storm had a second eruption. Scientists believe the white spots are made from ammonia ice pushed up by warmer gas through the tops of the planet's clouds.\nOccurrence.\nThe spots happen every 28.5 Earth years. This is the solstice when Saturn's northern hemisphere tilts most toward the Sun. The following is a list of recorded sightings; years with spots that are part of the cycle are 1876, 1903, 1933, 1960, and 1990.\nWhy there were no spots recorded before 1876 is a mystery. It is like the break in sightings of the Great Red Spot in the 18th and early 19th centuries. The 1876 Great White Spot was very large, and could be seen even with small telescopes. Was the earlier record simply poor, or was the 1876 GWS truly a first for the telescopic era? Some believe that neither scenario is likely.\nMark Kidger has described three important Great White Spot patterns:\nKidger predicts that the next Great White Spot will happen in the NTZ in 2016, and will probably be less spectacular than the 1990 Great White Spot.\nCharacteristics.\nA \"classic\" Great White Spot is a spectacular event. Very bright white storms light up Saturn's usually dull atmosphere. All the major ones have happened in the planet's northern hemisphere. They usually begin as separate \"spots\", but then rapidly get bigger in longitude, as the 1933 and 1990 Great White Spots did. In 1990 the Great White Spot grew to circle the whole planet.. "}

The movie was released on October 21, 2010.\nDespite receiving negative reviews from film critics, the film was well-welcomed from audience.\nIn the movie, Boog (Matthew J. Munn) is about to go on a special guys' trip with the boys, but everyone is extremely busy living with their families. This disappoints Boog and it makes him go on a trip himself and encounters the Maslova Family Circus that came from Russia and meets a doppelganger named Doug (Matthew J. Munn), his annoying friend Alistair (Dana Snyder), and a circus performer named Ursa (Melissa Sturm), whom he falls in love with. When the animals at the forest find out the circus is going back to Russia, they make a whole new plan to rescue Boog and bring him back home.\nPlot.\nBoog (Matthew J. Munn) plans an annual guys' trip to spend time with his male friends. But Elliot (Maddie Taylor) has distanced himself from him since he had started a family with his wife Giselle (Melissa Sturm) and his three children: Gisela (Karley Scott Collins), Giselita (Ciara Bravo), and Elvis (Harrison Fahn). Boog is disappointed since everyone else wanted to spend time with their families, which makes the grizzly go on a trip of his own, which leads him to a Russian traveling circus called the Maslova Family Circus.\nWhile in the circus, Boog meets Doug (Matthew J. Munn), a lazy, scruffy grizzly bear who is tired of performing in the circus on the sidelines (as well, Boog also meets Doug's friend, an Argentina llama named Alistair {Dana Snyder}). Doug craves recognition as a full-fledged king of the forest, the ruler of wildlife. Doug convinces Boog to switch his life in the forest for his place at the circus, which Boog accepts. But the whole thing turns out a scam since all Doug really wanted to do all this time was escape.\nMeanwhile, Boog falls madly in love with Ursa (Melissa Sturm), a female grizzly bear who was born in Russia and can effortlessly walk on a tightrope, juggle and dance. When the couple begin working together, they obtain much more as a harmonious duet than it might seem at first glance. When Boog's pals find out about Boog's disappearance, they, as well as the pets put aside their differences and hatch a rescue mission to save Boog.\nBoog's friends arrive at the circus.

He is the first Jewish mayor of Chicago.\nEmanuel was chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee during the 2006 mid-term elections and remained a top strategist for House Democrats during the 2008 cycle. After Democrats regained control of the House in 2006, Emanuel was elected chairman of the Democratic Caucus. This made him the fourth-ranking House Democrat, behind Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Majority Whip Jim Clyburn.\nWhite House Chief of Staff (2009-2010).\nTwo days after Obama's election victory, Emanuel was announced as Obama's designee for White House Chief of Staff. He resigned from the House on January 2, 2009, and began his duties as Chief of Staff on January 20, 2009, the day of Obama's inauguration.\nMayor of Chicago (2011-2019).\nEmanuel resigned as Chief of Staff effective October 1, 2010, in order to run for Mayor of Chicago pending the announced retirement of six term incumbent Richard M. Daley.\nOn January 27, 2011, the Illinois Supreme Court reversed a lower court's ruling that had cast doubt on Emanuel's candidacy; the court unanimously decided that Emanuel did not abandon his Chicago residency by serving in the White House, thus affirming his ability to run for mayor. He won the Mayoral election on February 22, 2011, with 55% of the vote. President Obama appointed William M. Daley, the brother of Emanuel's predecessor as mayor, as Chief of Staff to replace Emanuel.\nEmanuel created a transition team from varied backgrounds. On November 16, the city council voted unanimously to adopt the mayor's first budget, which decreased the budget by $34 million and increased spending by $46.2 million, supported by increasing fees and fines. Despite most Aldermen opposing cuts to library workers and the closure of mental health clinics, they ultimately supported it, calling it \"honest\". At a news conference in November 2012, Emanuel listed his top three priorities for the state legislature as security and pension reform, adding a casino to Chicago, and equal marriage rights for same-sex couples. At a press conference with Illinois Governor Pat Quinn, who previously vetoed legislation to put a casino in Chicago, the two were \"very close\" to reaching a deal.\nEmanuel won his second term during the run-off re-election campaign. He defeated Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia. Emanuel won 56.76% of the votes.\nIn November and into December 2015, Emanuel has been criticized for his handling of the Laquan McDonald shooting, mainly for covering and allowing Chicago police to get away with excessive use of force on black minorities. \"Chicago Tribune\" columnist John Kass wrote that the Emanuel administration withheld from the public the police dashboard camera video of the Laquan McDonald shooting in order to secure the re-election. Since December 2015, over half of Chicagoans believe that Emanuel should resign with such support from the \"New York Times\", Al Sharpton, Black Lives Matter, U.S senator Bernie Sanders and Illinois governor Bruce Rauner.\nDespite growing disapproval ratings, Emanuel announced his candidacy for re-election in the 2019 mayoral race, though there are petitions seeking for a two-term limit for Chicago mayors. However, on September 4, 2018, Emanuel reversed this decision and stated he would not seek a third term.\nBiden administration.\nWhen Joe Biden was elected President of the United States, he wanted to pick Emanuel as the United States Secretary of Transportation.Initially, Emanuel was considered for Transportation secretary in the Biden administration. However, many progressives were against this because of his handling of the police shooting of Laquan McDonald. \nIt was reported in February 2021 that Emanuel was being considered by the Biden administration as an ambassador to either China or Japan. In April 2021 it was reported that Biden had chosen him for ambassador to Japan. In May 2021, Biden formally nominated Emmanuel to serve as ambassador to Japan.\nPersonal life.\nWhile a high school student working part-time at an Arby's restaurant, Emanuel severely cut his right middle finger on a meat slicer, which was later infected from swimming in Lake Michigan. His finger was partially amputated due to the severity of the infection.\nEmanuel married Amy Merritt Rule in 1994. They have three children. They live in Ravenswood, Chicago."}

In 1907 it was again lengthened to four years, the present duration. Until 1861, municipal elections were held in March. In that year, legislation changed them to April. In 1869, however, election time was changed to November, and terms expiring in April of that year were lengthened. In 1875, the election day was moved back to April by the city's vote to operate under the Cities and Villages Act of 1872. Lester L. Bond was the acting mayor when Joseph Medill left to a tour around Europe. Thomas Hoyne won election as mayor, but could not become the mayor so the election became a void. As of 1995, no mayor can run for a political party, they are considered as nonpartisans.\nVice Mayor.\nThe city council elects a vice mayor who is interim mayor in the event of a vacancy in the office of the mayor or the inability of the mayor to serve due to illness or injury. As of May 2019, the current vice mayor is Tom Tunney.\nPast holders of this office have included Brendan Reilly (2015\u20132019) Ray Suarez (2011\u20132015), and David Orr.\nNotes.\n1 Rahm Emanuel is a Democrat, but he and all other candidates in the 2011 election officially ran as nonpartisans. Under a 1995 Illinois law, \"candidates for mayor . . . no longer would run under party labels in Chicago.\""}

For example, two separate people who see a traffic accident, at the spot, could be considered independent sources. However, if one person saw the accident and told the other one about it, then they would not be \"independent\", since one would \"depend\" on the other for their information. Also, if two witnesses to an event discuss what they saw before they are asked about it and agree to tell the same story, then they are also no longer independent. As another example, two scientific devices could be considered independent sources of measurement data, unless they shared the same wiring or electrical power supply (or similar factors).\nConsulting multiple independent sources is a common technique for detecting errors and deception, as any divergences or contradictions between statements, or data samples, would likely indicate one of these.\nFamously, the \"New York Times' \" minimal standard for reporting a fact not otherwise attributed to a single speaker is that it be verified by at least two independent sources.\nCircular reporting is a situation where multiple sources \"appear\" to be independent, but in reality originate from a single source.

He was very important for the development of playing harp. \nBiography.\nJacobs was born in Marksville, Louisiana and grew up in Alexandria, Louisiana, where he first learned to play the harmonica. At the age of 12 he left school and travelled around. He played in the streets of New Orleans, Memphis, Helena, Arkansas and St. Louis and made his living. He learned more about playing harp from Sonny Boy Williamson II, Sunnyland Slim, Honeyboy Edwards and others.\n1945 he went to Chicago. There he made first recordings playing guitar for Floyd Jones. Frustrated about the fact that guitars were louder than his harmonica he started using a microphon and pluging it into the guitar amplifiers. So he could compet with any guitar sound. 1947 he did his first recordings for a small label in Chicago. 1948 he became member of Muddy Waters band and recorded with him for Chess records. First he played acoustic, the first appearance on record of Little Walter's amplified harmonica sound was on Muddy's \"Country Boy\"/\"Too Young To Know\" (Chess 1452), recorded on July 11, 1951. \nHis first hit record was \"Juke\", an instrumental, which was intended to be the signature song of Muddy Waters band. The song was published on Checkers, a sub label of Chess. It stayed 20 weeks in the charts, eight of them on #1. Till 1957 he played with Muddy Waters but in this year he was replaced by Junior Wells. Walter took his band \"The Aces\" and renamed them into \"The Jukes\". Walter had a lot of hits, f.e. \"My Babe\" written by Willie Dixon, but with the beginning of the 1960s his success faded away.\n1964 and 1967 he came with the American Folk Blues Festival to Europe. After his second tour he was involved in a fight during a concert break. Although he was not severely injured he died in the night due to an heart failure. He was buried on February 22, 1968 at St. Mary's Cemetery in Evergreen Park, IL on February 22, 1968.\nHis influence can be heard in every modern blues harp player, from blues greats such as Junior Wells, James Cotton, George \"Harmonica\" Smith, Carey Bell, and Big Walter Horton, through modern-day masters Sugar Blue, Billy Branch, Kim Wilson, Rod Piazza, William Clarke, and Charlie Musselwhite, in blues-rock crossover artists such as Paul Butterfield, Southside Johnny (who named his band The Asbury Jukes after Little Walter's band), and John Popper of the band Blues Traveler.\nSingles in the charts.\nLittle Walter made 15 singles that reached the Billboard R&amp;B chart."}

Each person knows part of the secret that is shared, but a number of people need to cooperate to rebuild the secret. The knowledge of one person alone is not enough to reconstruct the secret. Adi Shamir and George Blakley developed the method independently of each other, in 1979.\nOne example where secret sharing is used is the RSA cryptosystem. It uses a \"secret key\". If this key is distributed among many people, no single person can make a signature. Even if the part of one person is revealed or lost, a number of them can still make a signature. This is often used is areas where security is very important, such as banks, or the military.\nThe dealer hands each player their part of the secret. In an easier setup, the parts of the players can be combined to form the secret, but with each part there is extra information. Say that a secret needs five parts, and three parts are known. In this setup, guessing the two parts that are missing will be easier than guessing the secret awhen no parts are known. The other setup is said to be secure from the point of view of information theory, because knowing part of the required number of player parts will not change how difficult it is to guess the secret. \nThere are different methods of secure secret sharing techniques.\nShamir's method.\nIn this method, any t out of the n shares may be used to recover the secret. The idea is that a polynomial of degree t-1 is defined by t points on the polynomial: It takes two points to define a straight line, three to define a quadratic curve, four for a cubic, and so on. It takes t points ot define a polynomial of degree t-1. That way it is possible to build a polynomial, the first coefficient is the secret; there are n randomly picked coefficients. Each player receives one of the n coefficients. If there are at least t players, they can rebuild the original curve, and get the secret."}

In such a protocol, two parties are communicating. The task of one party is to convince the other that it knows some secret, but without revealing the secret.\nExample.\nThere is a well-known story showing some of the ideas of zero-knowledge proofs. Usually, the two parties in a zero-knowledge proof are called Peggy (the prover of the statement) and Victor (the verifier of the statement).\nIn this story, Peggy has uncovered the secret word used to open a magic door in a cave. The cave is shaped like a circle, with the entrance on one side and the magic door blocking the opposite side. Victor says he'll pay her for the secret, but not until he's sure that she really knows it. Peggy says she'll tell him the secret, but not until she receives the money. They devise a scheme by which Peggy can prove that she knows the word without telling it to Victor.\nFirst, Victor waits outside the cave as Peggy goes in. They label the left and right paths from the entrance A and B. Peggy randomly takes either path A or B. Then, Victor enters the cave and shouts the name of the path he wants her to use to return, either A or B, chosen at random. Providing she really does know the magic word, this is easy: she opens the door, if necessary, and returns along the desired path. Note that Victor does not know which path she has gone down.\nHowever, suppose she did not know the word. Then, she would only be able to return by the named path if Victor were to give the name of the same path that she had entered by. Since Victor would choose A or B at random, he would have a 50% chance of guessing correctly. If they were to repeat this trick many times, say 20 times in a row, her chance of successfully anticipating all of Victor's requests would become very small. \nFor this reason, if Peggy reliably appears at the exit Victor names, he can conclude that she is very likely to know the secret word."}

It was made in 1964 by the company RCA. The CED is similar to a record because it stores the video and sound as small groves on a black disk. Because of this, the CED is an analog disc format instead of a digital format like a CD. The CED is stored inside a plastic case so you can not touch the disk as it is very easy to damage. On the plastic case is a label that has the name of the movie on the disc as well as other information such as a summary of the movie.\nHistory.\nThe first CED was made in 1964 but were not available for purchase until 1981. About 200 movies were made available on CED. Each movie that was on CED was about $15 to $35 depending on the length of the movie. The CED did not sell well, this is because you could not record on the disc like you could with a video tape. The production of the CED stopped in 1986.\nDetails of a CED.\nCEDs are conductive vinyl platters that are 30.0 cm (11.8 in) in diameter. To avoid using the metric system to name their discs, they were called \"12 inch discs\" even though they were actually slightly smaller. Each side of the disc has grooves that are about 19 miles long and are 37 times smaller than the grooves on a regular phonograph record. When the disc is playing, it spins at about 450 times per minute and each rotation of the disc contained several frames of audio and visual information. \nTo read the disc, a titanium needle was placed very lightly on the outer edge of the disc. A small electric current was then passed through the center of the needle, where it would touch the bottom of the groove and read the audio information, which was stored in small holes. The needle would read these by detecting how much air was between the needle and the pit and then the electronics of the player would convert these into audio. The visual information was stored in the grooves and were read like a regular phonograph record. As the needle passed over the grooves, it would vibrate and the player would convert the vibrations into the pictures."}

It had a population of 744,900 in 2010, 646,175 in 2002 and 620,516 in 1989.\nName.\nThe city was founded on January\u00a012, 1794 (Gregorian calendar) as Yekaterinodar (). The original name meant \"Catherine's Gift\", both in recognition of Catherine the Great's grant of land in the Kuban region to the Black Sea Cossacks (later the Kuban Cossacks), and also in recognition of Saint Catherine, \"the Martyr\", who is considered to be the patron of the city. After the October Revolution, Yekaterinodar was renamed Krasnodar (December 1920). There are two potential meanings for the new name of the city: Krasno- (\u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e-), meaning either 'beautiful' (an older root) or 'red' (especially relevant considering the political atmosphere of the time); and -dar (-\u0434\u0430\u0440), meaning 'gift'. Thus, the city's name means either \"beautiful gift\" or \"red gift\" (i.e. 'gift of the reds')..\nHistory.\nThe origin of the city starts with a fortress built by the Cossacks in order to defend imperial borders and claim Russian ownership over Circassia, which was contested by Ottoman Turkey. In the first half of the 19th century Yekaterinodar grew into a busy center of the Kuban Cossacks. It was granted town status in 1867. By 1888 about 45,000 people lived in the city and it became a vital trade center of southern Russia. In 1897, an obelisk commemorating 200 year old history of Kuban Cossack Host was built in Yekaterinodar.\nDuring the Russian Civil War the city changed hands several times between the Red Army and Volunteer Army, many Kuban Cossacks were committed anti-Bolsheviks who supported the White Movement.\nDuring the Great Patriotic War (World War II), Krasnodar was occupied by the German Army between August 12, 1942 and February 12, 1943. The city sustained heavy damage in the fighting but was rebuilt and renovated after the war.\nIn the summer of 1943, the Soviets began trials, including of their own citizens, for collusion with the Nazis and participation in war crimes. The first such trial was held at Krasnodar on July 14\u201317, 1943. This was the first public trial of the mass murder of Jews during the Holocaust. The Krasnodar tribunal pronounced eight death sentences, which were summarily conducted in the city square in front of a crowd of about thirty thousand people.\nFamous Russian soprano Anna Netrebko, soprano Evgenia Kononova, cosmonaut Gennady Padalka, counterrevolutionary Andrei Shkuro and rhythmic gymnast Inna Zhukova were born in Krasnodar. Another notable native of Krasnodar is Greece basketball international Lazaros Papadopoulos, who emigrated to Greece with his Pontic Greek parents when he was 10 years old.\nMain sights.\nKrasnodar is home to the steel lattice hyperboloid tower built by the Russian engineer and scientist Vladimir Grigorievich Shukhov in 1928; it is near Krasnodar Circus.\nOther attractions include St. Catherine's Cathedral, the State Arts Museum, a park and theatre named after Maxim Gorky, the beautiful concert hall of the Krasnodar Philharmonic Society, which is considered to have some of the best acoustics in southern Russia, State Cossack Choir and the Krasnodar circus\nThe most interesting place of Krasnodar is Krasnaya Street (which translates as \"Red, Beautiful Street\"). There are many sights there. In the beginning of this street one can see the Central Concert Hall; at the other end one can see the Avrora cinemacenter. A \"Triumphal Arch\" is in the middle of Krasnaya Street.\nTransportation.\nThe main airline is Kuban Airlines (at Krasnodar International Airport), and the largest hotels in the city include the Intourist, Hotel Moskva, and Hotel Platan. Krasnodar uses a 220 V/50\u00a0Hz power supply with two round-pin outlets, like most European countries.\nPublic transportation within Krasnodar consists of city buses, trolleybuses, trams, and marshrutkas. Trolleybuses and trams, both powered by overhead electric wires, are the main form of transportation in Krasnodar. Unlike Moscow and Saint Petersburg, Krasnodar does not have a metro system.\nCoat of arms.\nThe coat of arms of Yekaterinodar was introduced in 1841 by the Cossack yesaul Ivan Chernik. The royal letter \"E\" in the middle is for Ekaterina II (Russian for Catherine II). It also depicts the date city was founded, the Imperial double headed eagle (symbolizing Tsar's patronage of Black Sea Cossacks), a bulawa of a Cossack ataman, Yekaterinodar fortress, and flags with letters \"E\", \"P\", \"A\", and \"N\" standing for Catherine II, Paul I, Alexander I and Nicholas I. Yellow stars around the shield symbolized 59 Black Sea stanitsas around the city.\nInternational relations.\nTwin towns \u2014 Sister cities.\nKrasnodar has five sister cities, as designated by Sister Cities International, Inc.

A short-period comet will complete its orbit in less than 200 years. A long-period comet will take more than 200 years to orbit. In most cases the comets are named after the person who discovered them. The Shoemaker-Levy comets were named after Eugene Shoemaker, Carolyn Shoemaker and David Levy. A few comets are named after the person who calculated the orbits, such as 2P/Encke and 27P/Crommelin. It is very difficult to work out the orbit of a long-period comet because the orbit changes. The gravity of planets, or the release of gas or material from the comet itself, changes the orbit. Short-period comets can be predicted very accurately.\nPeriodic comets sometimes have the same name, for example there are nine Shoemaker-Levy comets and twenty-four NEAT comets. The Minor Planet Center, a part of the International Astronomical Union gives comets a different number prefix or uses the full title such as 181P/Shoemaker-Levy and 192/Shoemaker-Levy which are both \"Comet Shoemaker-Levy\". Sometimes an informal numbering system is used for periodic comets so 181P is Comet Shoemaker-Levy 6 and 192P is Comet Shoemaker-Levy 1. Because non-periodic Shoemaker-Levy comets are included in the number sequences there appear to be gaps in the numbers, for example C/1991 B1 is between Shoemaker-Levy 2 and 3, C/1991 T2 is between 5 and 6, C/1993 K1 and D/1994 E2 after Shoemaker-Levy 9.\nIn naming a comet, the letter before the \"/\" is:\nSome lists keep the \"C\" prefix for comets of with orbits longer than about 30 years until their return is confirmed."}

He is currently the Chairman of Mottola Media Group and previously the Chairman &amp; CEO of Sony Music Entertainment, parent of the Columbia label, for nearly 15 years. He is married to the Mexican actress and singer Thal\u00eda.\nEarly career.\nMottola was born in The Bronx, New York. He graduated from Iona Grammar School in 1962 and Iona Preparatory School in New Rochelle, New York in 1966. He briefly attended Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York before dropping out. He initially had aspirations of a music career, and released with CBS Records, but his singing career was short-lived.\nWishing to stay in the industry, Mottola started Champion Entertainment Organization Inc. to manage other artists. While working at the Chappell music-publishing company, he became the mentor to Philadelphia-based soul/rock performers Daryl Hall and John Oates.\nHis belief in the duo led him to push them relentlessly to do appearances and advertising promotions, including some of the first specialized music videos and one of the first modern \"sponsored tours,\" for Beech-Nut's Care Free Gum, Panasonic, and Pontiac.\nHall &amp; Oates paid tribute to him in their track \"Gino (the Manager)\" on their self-titled 1975 RCA release, better known as the Silver Album. Mottola also figured\u2014this time, being mentioned by name\u2014in \"Cherchez La Femme,\" the 1976 dance hit by another Mottola act, Dr. Buzzard's Original Savannah Band. (\"Tommy Mottola / Lives on the road ...\")\nRaised as a Roman Catholic, Mottola converted to Judaism shortly before his marriage to Lisa Clark. That marriage, which ended in divorce in 1992, produced a daughter (Sarah) and a son (Michael, who is now a production assistant with MTV).\nBrisbane rock band Regurgitator wrote a tribute song to him called \"I Love Tommy Mottola\" for their 1999 album \"...Art\".\nCBS.\nIn 1987, Mottola was chosen to run CBS Records at the age of 37.\nSoon afterward, Sony Corporation closed on its deal to buy the CBS Records group unit from CBS, naming him President and CEO of the music division, where he succeeded his former mentor Walter Yetnikoff, who had originally brought Mottola into CBS. Mottola served as Chairman and CEO Sony Music Entertainment.\nSony.\nDuring his tenure, he transformed Sony into one of the most successful global music companies, expanding its businesses into over 60 countries, while creating one of the strongest management teams in the industry. He revitalized Sony Music's publishing division by making such acquisitions as the Beatles catalogue and enabled Sony to become the first major music company to make available commercial digital downloads. He is widely well known for signing, developing, and nurturing the careers of Mariah Carey, Celine Dion, Destiny's Child, Jennifer Lopez, Shakira, Gloria Estefan, the Dixie Chicks, Marc Anthony, Barbra Streisand, Bruce Springsteen, Billy Joel, among others. He also worked with Michael Jackson from the time he began recording his \"Dangerous\" (1991) album. Jackson would later state that his relationship with Mottola dissolved based on corruption in his working practices, publicly referring to him as a \"racist\" and \"devil\". \"The recording companies really, really do conspire against the artists.\" Jackson said.(source: Vh1).\nMariah Carey.\nIn 1988, Brenda K. Starr, a Columbia artist, handed Mottola a demo tape from one of her backup singers. Initially he tossed it aside, but later decided to listen to it. He was impressed by the demo and tracked down the singer, a then-unknown Mariah Carey, and eventually signed her. Mottola is seen as the main architect for Mariah's success in the early years of her career.\nIn June 1993, Mottola and Carey married in a lavish ceremony, but the marriage was short-lived with the couple separating shortly before Christmas 1996 and divorcing in early 1998. In 2000, Carey, at the time Columbia's biggest selling artist, signed an $80 million contract with Virgin Records, but after the commercial and critical failure of her first album for the label, \"the Glitter soundtrack\", Virgin dropped her from the company and it rescinded the $80 million contract. Carey later signed with Island Records.\nThal\u00eda.\nMottola later went on to date other stars before dating Mexican singer Thal\u00eda, whom he married December 2, 2000. They have a daughter together, Sabrina Saka\u00eb (Oct 7, 2007). Their second child, a son, Matteo Alejandro was born on June 25th 2011 . He also is credited with creating the Latin Explosion in popular music by championing such Sony artists as Marc Anthony, Ricky Martin, Jennifer Lopez and Gloria Estefan. Additionally, Mottola was the architect for some of Sony's biggest global brands such as Celine Dion and Mariah Carey. During his 15-year tenure, Mottola built Sony up from a company with revenues of 800 million dollars a year to one with over 6 billion dollars of annual revenue by the year 2000.\nIn June 2010, he decided to sell his Ranch in Colorado, for an amount of 27.5 million dollars, as he was not spending time in it anymore and wanted to be closer to his family.\nAfter Sony.\nTommy Mottola was the head of Sony Music Entertainment until January 2003. Since leaving his post as chief of Sony Music, Mottola has been building a new entertainment company, complete with recorded music, television production, theater, and fashion, alongside a branding and management company launching. He was instrumental in re-launching the various careers of such artists as Grammy winner and Latin pop star Marc Anthony, and teen sensation Lindsay Lohan. Later signings included Cassie Ventura in 2006 and Mika, who in 2007 had a #1 single in the UK.\nA collaboration with former Miramax chief Harvey Weinstein has them teamed on two current projects for live theater, namely producers of Pink Floyd's \"The Wall\". Mottola's TV production arm is currently producing and developing many shows for cable and network television.\nMottola bought out the rights to Casablanca Records (a then-diminished imprint of Polygram), and resurrected it, signing actress Lindsay Lohan, and singer Mika.\nPhilanthropy.\nKnown also for his many philanthropic activities, Mottola has served on the Board of Directors of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the Police Athletic League of New York City, T.J. Martell Foundation for Cancer, Leukemia and AIDS Research, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation and Museum, and the Federal Law Enforcement Foundation.\nCultural references.\nThe character of Gene Balboa in the Channel 101 Internet TV Series Yacht Rock is loosely based on Mottola, in particular his time as manager of Hall and Oates.\nThe Australian band Regurgitator include the song \"i love tommy mottola\" on their 1999 album \"...art\"."}
