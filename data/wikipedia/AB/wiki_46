It is about 3000 light years across, tilted toward the galactic plane by about 16 to 20 degrees. It contains many large and bright O- and B-type stars.\nThe belt may be the local spiral arm to which the Sun belongs. At present the Sun is about 325 light years from the arm's centre. The belt is thought to be from 30 to 50 million years old, and of unknown origin. Benjamin Gould identified it in 1879.\nThe belt contains bright stars in many constellations including (in order going more or less eastward) Cepheus, Lacerta, Perseus, Orion, Canis Major, Puppis, Vela, Carina, Crux (the Southern Cross), Centaurus, Lupus, and Scorpius (including the Scorpius-Centaurus Association). \nOverview.\nStar-forming regions with bright O and B stars make up the Gould Belt. These regions include the Orion Nebula and the Orion molecular clouds, the Scorpius-Centaurus OB Association, Cepheus OB2, Perseus OB2, and the Taurus-Auriga Molecular Clouds. \nA theory proposed around 2009 suggests that the Gould Belt formed about 30 million years ago when a blob of dark matter collided with the molecular cloud in our region. There is also evidence for similar Gould belts in other galaxies."}

He is sometimes called the \"Radioactive Boy Scout\" or the \"Nuclear Boy Scout\".\nHe was a scout in the Boy Scouts of America. Hahn did his experiments without anyone knowing. He did them in a backyard shed at his mother's house in Commerce Township, Michigan. While he never actually was able to build a reactor (what he built was a neutron source), Hahn got the attention of local police when he was stopped for a different reason. The police found things in his vehicle that troubled them. He warned that it was radioactive. His mother's property was cleaned up by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ten months later as a Superfund cleanup site. Hahn attained Eagle Scout rank shortly after his lab was dismantled.\nBackground.\nHahn was born in Royal Oak, Michigan.\nCreation of the neutron source.\nHahn was a Boy Scout. He was interested in chemistry. He spent years doing amateur chemistry experiments. Those experiments sometimes made small explosions. He was inspired by reading \"The Golden Book of Chemistry Experiments\", and he tried to get samples of every element in the periodic table. This included the radioactive ones. He later received a merit badge in Atomic Energy. He became interested with the idea of building a breeder reactor in his home. Hahn got a lot of radioactive material by collecting small amounts from household products. It included things such as americium from smoke detectors, thorium from camping lantern mantles, radium from clocks, and tritium from gunsights. His \"reactor\" was a bored-out block of lead, and he used lithium from $1,000 worth of bought batteries to purify the thorium ash using a Bunsen burner.\nFBI Investigation.\nOn April 23, 2007, the FBI heard that Hahn may have a second breeder reactor in his freezer. The FBI contacted him via telephone. Hahn said that he did not have any radioactive material. The FBI decided he was not a terrorist threat. However, they decided to do a personal interview. During a May 16, 2007 interview at an FBI office, investigators asked Hahn about flyers that he had sent out promoting his book and upcoming film. They also asked about him stealing tires and rims from a vehicle before he joined Navy service. They also asked him about a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. FBI agents then interviewed a person (whose name was not given) who said that Hahn was using cocaine a lot. They also said he was not taking his prescribed medication, and that he was paranoid of people that he claimed \"had the ability to 'shock' his genitals with their minds\". They also said he had possibly been visited by prostitutes. The person also said that he believed that Hahn was still trying to build a reactor, and that Hahn was collecting radium. He said that he did not believe Hahn wanted to hurt anyone, but was worried for his mental health.\nLarceny of smoke detectors.\nIn Clinton Township, Michigan on August 1, 2007, Hahn was charged with larceny for removing many smoke detectors from the halls of his apartment building. He wanted to get americium from them. In his mug shot, his face is covered with sores. Investigators believe those sores could be from being near radioactive things, psoriasis, or possible drug use.\nDeath.\nHahn died on September 27, 2016. He was 39 years old. Hahn died in his hometown of Shelby Charter Township, Michigan. His death was accidental and due to intoxication from the combined effects of alcohol, diphenhydramine, and fentanyl."}

Because of this imbalances, southern Taiwanese often feel they're not fairly treated by the government.\nIn Taiwan, best schools and educational institutions supported by Taiwanese government are based in northern Taiwan. If you're southern Taiwanese wanting to study deeper, you will need to go to northern Taiwan. If you're an engineer or manager in a company, you will often need to go to northern Taiwan to update your knowledge.\nFrom 1980 to 2000 in Taiwan, money that is paid, usually every month, to an employee was getting higher and higher leading to a tendency that companies moved out of Taiwan.\nAt the same time, many companies, who were able to earn more and thus pay more to their employees, started to grow in Taiwan. These companies made higher-value-added products and offered jobs needing college education not the kind of work that needs physical skills or strength in the past. Because Taiwan's higher educational institutions were near Taipei City, Taiwan, these \"new companies\" liked to go to northern Taiwan to run businesses.\nBefore 1980, Taiwan's main industries were farming, fishing, light industries and heavy industries. . Thanks to Japanese's policy that equally distributed resources for economic development, southern Taiwanese could find a job near their home in that time and even in the early time of the governance by KMT who succeeded Japanese to rule Taiwan since 1945. \nBirth, price, and population.\nSince Taiwanese government invests everything in northern Taiwan, southern Taiwanese have had to go away from their home in southern Taiwan to northern Taiwan to find jobs. \nMore and more Taiwanese move to northern Taiwan. However, northern Taiwan just has a little plain in the need of buildings. As a result, the price tags for people from southern Taiwan to buy a house in northern Taiwan to live become very expensive. \nBecause of the expensive housing price, people in northern Taiwan have no choice but cut their desire to have babies. At the same time, southern Taiwanese don't have enough money to own a baby. So southern Taiwanese cut their desire to have babies, too. These lead to very low birth rate in Taiwan. After many southern Taiwanese moved to northern Taiwan, because they didn't own a house in northern Taiwan and were new to the environment, these movers' pockets generally not deep enough to pay a new house to start a family.\nThese lead to very low birth rate in Taiwan. Taiwan is one of the countries with the lowest brith rates in the world.\nIn southern Taiwan, the Skipped Generation Families/Grand-parenting Families are very often seen. In that, because many young children's parents have left to northern Taiwan to work. In the end, grand-parents become these young children's \"real parents\"."}

Biochar is made by heating biomass like wood in an oven to very high temperatures. This removes all of the water and easy to burn material from the biomass leaving only carbon. The final result is fragile and dark black charcoal.\nUses.\nCarbon sink.\nBiochar is made from organic material known as biomass. Biomass is mostly made from carbon. Carbon in biomass is captured from carbon dioxide in the air by plants. This means that when biochar is made carbon that was once in the air is made into a solid material. Biochar can last a very long time in soil and even longer in containers.\nSome people propose making biochar to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=\"DOI10.1038/ncomms1053\"&gt;\n&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that traps heat in the atmosphere, causing climate change. If a lot of biochar were made then there would be less carbon dioxide in the air, meaning less heat would be trapped. This is known as a carbon sink, because the carbon is sunk or put into a long lasting material instead of floating in the air.\nSoil amendment.\nWhen biochar is made the biomass it is made from has most of its material removed. This means that biochar is very light and filled with tiny holes. These holes can hold water and nutrients which act as food for plants growing in biochar. Biochar can be soaked in nutrients to \"charge\" it which makes it a very good soil additive or fertilizer. The holes in biochar can also trap toxins which make water unsafe.\nBiochar was used by people in the Amazon to make their poor quality soil better for growing food. This made the soil very dark and the dark soil can still be seen today.\nSlash-and-char.\nIn some rainforest places the forests are cleared for farming. When the forests are cleared they are usually cut down and burned. This process is called slash-and-burn and doesn't leave very many nutrients in the soil. If the forests were cleared and turned into biochar rather than burned the soil would have more nutrients. This is known as slash-and-char and would make the soil better for farming.\nAnimal food.\nBiochar can be mixed with molasses for use as animal food. The biochar helps digestion and reduces the amount of methane produced by cows. Feces from animals that eat biochar is a high quality fertilizer.\nCommercial sector.\nBiochar is mainly sold by fertilizer companies to people who grow plants. This may change. There are many tons of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which is causing climate change. Many countries have agreed that this is a problem. In the future it may cost money to release carbon dioxide. If people who remove carbon dioxide are paid then there could be businesses which remove carbon dioxide for money. One way a business like that could remove carbon dioxide is by growing plants and turning them into biochar. This removes a large amount of carbon dioxide and could be very profitable in the future."}

It is one of the largest and most impressive gates in the country. Together with the \"outer square (El Hedim Square)\", it is considered the country's business card. The gate is located in front of El Hedim Square which is considered to be the most popular square in Morocco.\nHistory.\nThe gate structure was completed in 1732 by Mulay Abdullah who was the son of Sultan Mulay Ismail. The gate marks the main entrance of the imperial palace built for Isla Mulay and the ancient city of Meknes. \nThe door was designed by a Christian who converted to Islam whose name was \"Mansur\". Hence the gate's name: \"Mansur Gate\". The gate structure has been part of the Meknes protected heritage since 1914 and since 1996 has been used as a World Heritage Site along with the Old Town of Meknes.\nGeography.\nThe gate structure separates the outer square called Al-Hadim Square. It is adjacent to the Old City wall of Meknes, from the inner square called Lela Awda Square. It served as the \"Royal Order Ground\". Next to the gate within the walls are the Royal Order Stables, the Royal Prison, and the Meknes City Museum. It is decorated with green ceramics designed with Islamic motifs.

The sausage used in a corn dog is usually the same types that are used in hot dogs. It is a popular type of fast food or street food.\nCorn dogs originate from the United States in the 1920s. It is commonly found in American cuisine. They are found as a frozen food at most supermarkets.\nHistory.\nCorn dogs were first introduced by German Texans in the 1920s. The corn dog was first made as just a sausage rolled in cornbread battered and fried. Many years later, sticks were added to corn dogs as a unique food-holding tool that would later create the modern corn dog.\nOn 1927, the idea of fried food on a stick was filed for a patent in the US. On 1929, the patent was accepted. On the patent, it states that many foods other than sausages can also be used in the same way that a corn dog is prepared. The patent also states that by having a stick, the stick would allow the fried food to be handled and eaten in a cleaner way.\nThe earliest known year when the corn dog was first prepared in the US was on 1937. During a high school baseball game in Adel, Iowa, ballpark vendors ran out of hot dog buns for their hot dogs. Roger Newman, a local tavern owner who runs one of the vendors, took the remaining hot dogs in order to make corn dogs without sticks. He breaded each hot dog in a cornmeal batter that he had prepared for an upcoming fish fry, and returned to the ballpark with these corn dogs. Even though there were not any sticks for any of the corn dogs, patrons held the corn dogs with a wide variety of different methods. Some patrons held the corn dogs with wax paper, paper cones, and even pocket knives.\nMany current corn dog vendors believed that they invented or popularized the corn dog. Carl and Neil Fletcher claimed that they had popularized the corn dog by introducing \"Corny Dogs\" at the State Fair of Texas sometime between 1938 and 1942. The Pronto Pup vendors at the Minnesota State Fair claim to have invented the corn dog in 1941. On June 16, 1946, Cozy Dog Drive-in, in Springfield, Illinois, claims to have been the first to serve corn dogs on sticks. Also on 1946, Dave Barham opened the first location of Hot Dog on a Stick at Muscle Beach in Santa Monica, California."}

It received its royal charter from Queen Elizabeth II on 22 April 1966.\nAston is famous for having a placement year as part of many of its undergraduate degree courses. It pioneered the integrated placement year concept from its start in 1966.\nHistory.\nPredecessor institutions.\nIn 1875, a School of Metallurgy was formed in the Birmingham and Midland Institute.\nIn 1895, the Birmingham Municipal Technical School separated from the Institute. It taught chemistry, physics, metallurgy and electrical engineering.\nIn 1911, commercial classes were introduced. By 1916, this had grown into an independent School of Commerce.\nIn 1927, the school changed its name to the Birmingham Central Technical College. This was to reflect its changing approach to teaching technology.\nIn 1951, the Technical College was renamed the \"College of Technology, Birmingham\".\nWork began on the Main Building at Gosta Green. Princess Margaret laid one of the first foundation stones at the base of the new building in 1951. The building is said to be one of Europe's largest freestanding brick buildings.\nIn 1956 it became the UK's first College of Advanced Technology. It had a major expansion.\nThe college expanded again to a design by the City Architect of Birmingham Alwyn Sheppard Fidler between 1957 and 1965.\nUniversity status.\nOn 22 April 1966, it it was given its Royal Charter. It became the \"University of Aston in Birmingham\".\nOn 10 May 1966, the first Chancellor of the University, Lord Nelson of Stafford, was installed.\nThe Charter of the University outlines its objectives. These are appropriate to a technological university:\nDue to the history of the institution, there is emphasis given to the sandwich course system and the maintenance of strong links with industry.\nThe motto of the University is the same as that of the City of Birmingham \u2013 \"Forward\".\nIn 1983, Aston University, Birmingham City Council, and Lloyds Bank, established Birmingham Technology Ltd.. This company manages the Aston Science Park. The science park is next to the university site. In 1984, the area was granted its own postal address \"The Aston Triangle\". This made the campus an official district of Birmingham. The logo of the establishment takes from the shape of the area.\n2000 to present.\nIn September 2010, Aston University hosted the British Science Festival. This is one of Europe's largest public science events.\nSince May 2011, Sir John Sunderland has been the Chancellor.\nThe university is a lead sponsor of Aston University Engineering Academy. This university technical college (UTC) opened in September 2012. The UTC is for students aged 14 to 19 wishing to study and have a career in engineering. It is located at the edge of the Aston University campus.\nIn October 2014, the University announced a \u00a335 million cash injection for a major upgrade of the campus. This included a new \u00a319 million revamp of Aston Business School and improvement work to the Aston Institute of Photonic Technologies and the School of Languages and Social Sciences.\nIn October 2015, Aston launched the Aston Medical School. This was for postgraduate research students. In September 2018 the first Bachelor of Medicine MBChB course started. The course takes five years.\nIn February 2017, the University launched its online programme website. Four MSc programmes are offered 100% online to students in the UK and worldwide. It also offers the Aston Business School's MBA.\nIn July 2017, Aston became the first University in the UK to award degree apprenticeship graduates. Aston began working in close partnership with Capgemini, to create the first degree apprenticeship: \"Digital and Technology Solutions\" in 2012.\nCampus.\nThe university sits on a 40-acre campus at Gosta Green, in the city centre of Birmingham, England. The campus has accommodation for over 3000 students. It has sports facilities, a library, caf\u00e9s, restaurants, pubs, shops, travel centre, hairdresser, health centre, dentist, places of worship, opticians, a bank, automated teller machines and outside leisure space.\nLibrary.\nAston University Library is on four floors. It contains over 250,000 books and 800 current printed periodicals. It has over 700 reader places. It provides online access over 3,400 electronic journals. The Library is open 24\u00a0hours a day to Aston students and staff during exam time,and 12\u00a0hours a day during term time.\nIT.\nAround the campus there are open-access IT suites. They offer computer and internet access 24\u00a0hours a day. They offer access to software packages, database systems and computer-aided learning materials.\nSports.\nAston University sports facilities include a 25m swimming pool, sauna and steam room, two sports halls, a gym, weights and fitness rooms, and a two storey dance studio. It has 35 sports clubs. The campus also has two floodlit sports pitches. Many of the University clubs train and compete in the British Universities and Colleges Sports (BUCS) Leagues. Away from the campus, the University manages a 40-acre sports ground with floodlit pitches and a pavilion for all outdoor sports.\nOrganisation and administration.\nFaculties and departments.\nAll of the Aston University's faculties are based on one campus. They are organised into the following five schools:\n&lt;br&gt;\nCoat of arms.\nThe university's arms were granted on 18 March 1955 by Garter, Clarenceux and Norroy and Ulster Kings of Arms to the Birmingham Corporation. This was for use by the former College of Technology. They were designed to show the College's connection with the City and with the teaching of technology. The arms consist of a shield and crest.\nThe shield has two sections \u2013 the field (the main background) and a chief (the broad band across the top of the shield). The field is\ncoloured blue. The chief is coloured silver. On the field is a diagonal line of five gold diamonds joined one to the other. This is similar to the first quarter of the Arms of the City of Birmingham. It is incorporated in the Arms of the College to show its connection to the City. On the chief is depicted an open book bound in red placed between two black hammers. This shows the connection of the University with technology. The book represents learning. The hammers represent engineering and allied trades.\nThe crest is designed to stress the pursuit of knowledge. It consists of a red torch held erect by a forearm between two branches of gold laurel. Originally it would have been worn on the helmet of a fully armed person. The crest is always placed on the top of the helm. The method of joining the crest to the helm was usually concealed by decoration. In the University's arms this is done by the use of a wreath and a crown. The wreath is silver, red, and black. These colours being taken from the shield. On top is a mural crown (resembling a wall). This is reserved in modern grants for persons and organisations connected with public corporations. The cloth mantling hangs down from the top of the helm. This represents the cloak which was originally worn to protect the armour. It is coloured blue and gold. These being the two principal colours of the shield.\nIn 2016, Her Majesty's College of Arms granted the favour of supporters to Aston University's arms. This marked the 50th anniversary of the University. Professor Julia King, the Baroness Brown of Cambridge, the Vice-Chancellor, had made the request.\nThe Letters Patent was formally presented to Aston University by the York Herald, Michael Peter Desmond O'Donoghue Esq.. This was made in a service at St Phillips Cathedral, Birmingham, on 29th September 2016.\nThe arms are supported by a Canada goose and a red squirrel. The Canada goose is a symbol. It represents the family of geese living on the University campus. The squirrel is the crest of the arms of Aston Manor. This is a rebus. (The picture is a pun on the persons name. The owners of Aston Manor were the Holte family and a squirrel's nest is called a holt). This explains the ancient connection between the squirrel and Aston. The animal also appears on the University mace. It also appears on the Chancellor's chain of office. This chain was originally the property of the Mayor of Aston Manor.\nThe gorse around the animals' necks is a reference to Gosta Green. It was known as \"Gostie\" Green during the 18th century. This combined the name of the landowner (William de Gorsty) with the local plant called 'gorse'\nAcademic dress.\nThe academic dress for graduates of the University is as follows:\nAcademic profile.\nResearch.\nIn the 2008 Research Assessment Exercise, Aston University was ranked in the top 12 in the UK in all four of its broad subject areas. Of the research undertaken, 86% was described as 'internationally significant'. 88% of Aston academic staff were submitted for research assessment. This is one of the highest proportions in the UK. According to the Research Assessment Exercise, the university's strengths include Business and Management, General Engineering, subjects allied to Medicine (Optometry, Biology, Pharmacy and Psychology), Languages and European Studies.\nRankings.\nIn the 2012 QS World University Rankings, graduate employers ranked Aston University 51st for graduate employability. Aston was ranked in the top ten of all UK universities for its graduate employment record.\nIn 2012, Aston University was responsible for educating 2.3 per cent of the UK's millionaires. This placed Aston at number 8 in the UK.\nIn 2015, Aston was ranked as the 42nd best university in the world under 50 years old.\nFor 2018, it was put in the top 55 universities in the UK. It was ranked 18th for student experience in the Sunday Times Good University Guide.&lt;ref name = \"Aston University key facts 2017/2018\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nAston is ranked 34th in the University League Tables 2020.\nAston Business School.\nFounded in 1947, Aston Business School (ABS) is one of the largest and oldest business schools in the UK.\nIn 1999, ABS was the first UK business school to be awarded the prestigious EQUIS accreditation.\nThe school's most recent Research Assessment Exercise was in 2008. All research areas submitted ranked in the top 12 in the UK. 45% of the research submitted was judged to be \"excellent\" or \"world-leading\".\nIn 2012, the business school's Masters Management course was ranked by the \"Financial Times\" as 36th in the world.\nIn 2014, Aston was 2nd in the UK for developing marketing professionals, 7th for finance professionals,23rd for accounting professionals. This was based on the career outcome data of more than 313 million LinkedIn members.\nIn 2019, Aston is in the top 1% of Business Schools Worldwide with Triple Accreditation (AMBA, AACSB and EQUIS). It is in the World Top 100 Universities for Business and Management Studies (QS Ranking 2019).\nStudent life.\nStudents' Union.\nAston Students' Union (SU) used to be called Aston \"Guild\" of Students. It is a non-profit independent charity. It was set up to represent and support its members. Most members are current students at Aston University. The SU operates a number of commercial and non-commercial services. These include; the Advice &amp; Representation Centre (ARC), the Aston Athletic Union, the Aston Societies Federation, the SU Shop, Copyshop and B4 Bar. The Aston Athletic Union supports the university sports clubs. The Aston Societies Federation supports non-sporting societies.\nThe SU is funded by grant income from Aston University. This is added to by funds raised by the SU's commercial services. The SU is led by a Trustee Board of elected students and external trustees. Day-to-day management is by a team of permanent staff and the Executive Committee. The Executive Committeeby is an elected student team.\nThe SU building consists of 5 floors and is located in the centre of the Aston University Campus.\nOn 29 November 2006, the students voted to disaffiliate the Guild (now Union) from the National Union of Students. On 26 November 2014, they voted to re-affiliate.\nStudent housing.\nIn the 1970s, three tower blocks containing student accommodation were constructed on Aston University campus. They were named Dalton, Lawrence and Stafford Towers. In August 1999, the Lakeside complex added further student accommodation on to the campus.\nIn April 2007, Aston University submitted a planning application for demolition of the three 1970s towers. They were to be replaced by new student accommodation blocks, apartments for tutors, retail units and administrative offices.\nOn 8 May 2011, Lawrence and Dalton Towers were demolished.\nOn 27 April 2014, Stafford Tower, Gem Sports Centre and Lakeside Conference Centre were demolished. This made way for a new entrance to Aston University and a five-acre green space. The new landscaped area includes a walkway into the university from the city centre. It also contains a pavilion for teaching. The pavillion is also used as a catering facility for outdoor events. The new buildings are named the William Murdoch, the James Watt, the Harriet Martineau and the Mary Sturge Residences.\nIn 2016, Aston sold all of the student housing that it owned to UNITE Students."}

The first and second estates paid low taxes and enjoyed the facilities provided to them. In France in the 18th century the third estate paid 60% taxes, food was not provided to them and they were mostly peasants or farmers so they could not get much money. \nAfter the money in treasury was spent, the king called a meeting of the three estates. He asked the estates to pay more taxes. The first and second estates walked out, and the king let them. The third estate however, was asked to do the heavy lifting again, and pay more tax. They didn't accept and took a pledge called the tennis court pledge and protested against the king. They got thrown in jail, but the rest of the third estate bailed them out.\nThis act of bravery led to the execution of the last ruler of the Bourbon Dynasty and the end of monarchy."}

They have lived around the border of Peru and Ecuador long before the Spanish colonization of the Americas. Their oral traditions and expressions were declared an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity by UNESCO. Since 2009, the S\u00e1para people are a Nation inside of the Republic of Ecuador.\nPopulation and Territory.\nAbout 480 S\u00e1paros live in 400,000 hectares of Amazonian territory between the Conambo and Pinduyacu rivers, and between the rivers Curaray and Napo inside of the Yasuni National Park in Ecuador. There are also a hundred S\u00e1paros living in two towns, Arabelas and Iquitos, near the river Tigre in Peru. Most of the S\u00e1para territory is located within these coordinates: latitude: -2.2186; longitude: -76.5087. &lt;mapframe latitude=\"-2.2186\" longitude=\"-76.5087\" zoom=\"10\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" align=\"right\" /&gt;The S\u00e1para people are the smallest native group in the Ecuadorian Amazon. The population has decreased from about 200,000 people in the 16th century to almost 500 in the second decade of the 21st century. They live in the Ecuadorian towns of Kuitza (Llanchamacocha), Aremano (Jandiayacu), Mazaraka (Mazaramu), Cuyacocha, and Akamaru. \nOrigin and Culture.\nIn Kichwa language, \"Z\u00e1paro\" means a basket made of \"bejuco\", a tropical woody vine while in the Zaparo language, the word \"Z\u00e1para\" means person of the forest. The spelling of the Nation\u2019s name has been changed to \"S\u00e1para\" because the Z sound does not exist in the language of the S\u00e1paras.\nThe S\u00e1paras consider their lands, language and spirituality the three main aspects of their identity. \nTheir dress is mainly a vest made out of a bark from the Llanchama tree and a feather headdress. \nSome S\u00e1paras have married persons from other tribes such as the Kichwa, Shuar, and Achuar. However, the people still identify themselves as S\u00e1para. S\u00e1paras have become confused with their neighbors because the young people speak Kichwa and because of their low population. In fact, in the mid-1970s, the Z\u00e1para were declared extinct in Ecuador, while in Per\u00fa, they were unknown before 2001 although they appeared on the language map of the country. \nBeliefs.\nThe S\u00e1para people do not have a religion. Their mythology and stories develop from their environment. Dreams and the spiritual role of Amazonian animals are important for S\u00e1paras when making decisions. \nDuring the 20th century, missionaries came to the rainforest to convert native people to Christianity. The S\u00e1paras have refused these outside influences. Even when speaking Spanish, some leaders prefer not to use vocabulary related to western ideas, such as the word \"devil\". \nLanguage.\nZaparoan, or \"Saparoan\", is a family of languages. Within this group, there are five separate languages: Coronado, Omurano, Andoa, Gae and \"Z\u00e1paro\". More than a dozen extinct tribes spoke the Zaparoan languages. The only Zaparoan languages and dialects alive in modern times are Iquitos, Sabela and Z\u00e1paro. Iquitos is spoken by 500 people in Peru and the dialect Sabela is spoken by approximately 100 people in Ecuador. \nThe Z\u00e1paro language is spoken, in Ecuador, by 9 S\u00e1paras, elders who are over 60 years\".\" Most of the S\u00e1para people speak Kichwa, the largest native language in South America, as their mother tongue. In the 20th century, they also started to speak Spanish. \nDeclarations.\nEcuador and Per\u00fa suggested including the language and cultural expressions of the S\u00e1para people in the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. The UNESCO Intergovernmental Committee made the declaration in November 2008. \nOrganization and Government.\nThe S\u00e1para people became the Z\u00e1para Nationality of Ecuador in 2003. In the beginning, the S\u00e1para organization, NAZAE, represented the towns of Llanchamacocha, Jandiayacu, Mazaramu, and one family in Cuyacocha. Since 2005, the Nation includes the towns of Shiona, Pindoyacu, Balsaura and San Jos\u00e9 del Curaray. \nIn 2009, the S\u00e1para people were of\ufb01cially recognized as the S\u00e1para Nation or NASE by the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (CONFENIAE), and the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (CONAIE). Because of their distinction, the S\u00e1para Nation became member of the executive board of the Development Council of Nationalities and Peoples of Ecuador, CODENPE. \nThreats and Political problems.\nThe S\u00e1para population decreased because of diseases, forced migrations, and slavery. Diseases brought by rubber companies and religious missionaries reduced the S\u00e1para people to one group. The people also were separated from each other when their land was divided in 1941 during the war between Ecuador and Peru. \nThe S\u00e1para Nation have asked for rights such as health and bilingual education, in addition to demanding the Government of Ecuador to help them to keep their language alive. The S\u00e1paras are concerned about their right to own the land where they have lived for centuries and about protecting the environment from the actions of oil, timber and pharmaceutical companies. \nEconomy.\nThe S\u00e1paras have been fishers, hunters, gatherers and farmers. During the 1940\u2019s, the S\u00e1paras started to move to cities for study and work. At the same time, S\u00e1para men were drafted into the Army. They also left their communities to work for the Shell Oil Company and large plantations. Around 2007, men used to go to the Ecuadorian coast to work for construction companies. Meanwhile, women stayed in the villages taking care of the children, keeping the house and farming. As a result of such migration, most S\u00e1para men have learned Spanish. \nEducation.\nS\u00e1para people have two different education systems, the mainstream educational system and the Intercultural Bilingual Education System of the Governmental Education Division of Ecuador. While some S\u00e1paras have moved to cities to attend Spanish-language high schools, others attend Kichwa-language schools located in their villages. "}

It has roots in Christianity and has its headquarters in N'kamba in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nHistory.\nIn April 1921, during the Belgian colonization in Congo, Simon Kimbangu started preaching to people and using the powers that he believed he had received from God in visions to heal people. During his ministry, he attracted a large group of people. Under pressure from the Catholic Church, who was afraid of the popularity of the movement, the Belgian authorities tried to arrest Kimbangu on June 09, 1921. They failed in arresting him, and Kimbangu escaped. He continued his ministry in secret before turning himself in on September 12, 1921. He was sentenced to death, but the sentence was changed to life imprisonment. He died in prison in 1951.\nDuring Kimbangu\u2019s imprisonment, Kimbanguism was prohibited, but the followers continued to practice it. It grew through the leadership of Kimbangu\u2019s wife, Muile Marie, and his son, Joseph Diangenda. After Kimbangu\u2019s death, the movement was recognized as a religion by the Belgian authorities in 1959 and became a member of the World Council of Churches in 1969. The church was led by Kimbangu\u2019s youngest son, Joseph Diangenda Kuntima, until his death in 2001. Since 2001, Kimbangu\u2019s grandson, Simon Kimbangu Kiangani, has become the spiritual leader.\nBelief and Practices.\nSimon Kimbangu is an inspirational figure and he is considered the Black Messiah by his followers.\nThree dates are important in Kimbanguist beliefs: April 6 (the start of the ministry of healing), May 25 (Christmas), and October 12 (Kimbangu\u2019s death anniversary). Kimbanguism has roots in Christianity and the Bible. However, it has developed its own beliefs.\nThe basic principles of the Kimbanguist church are Bolingo (Love in English), Mibeko (Laws in English), and Misala (Works in English). According to Kimbanguist beliefs, Simon Kimbangu is God the Holy Spirit. Charles Kisolokele, his first son, is God the Father. Salomon Dialungana, his second son, is believed to be Jesus Christ who has come back in our times. Joseph Diangenda, his third son, is the reincarnation of his Father, the Holy Spirit.\nAccording to\u00a0 Kimbanguist rules, polygamy, smoking, drugs, alcohol, eating pork, sleeping naked, and trading on Sundays are all forbidden. During the Sunday services, believers do not wear shoes in the church. Green and white are the colors used in Kimbanguism. Green represents hope and white represents integrity. The churches are painted in these colors, and the believers wear them almost every day. The Kimbanguist has its headquarters in N'kamba, the hometown of Simon Kimbangu, which is considered \u201cthe New Jerusalem.\u201d \nOrganization.\nKimbanguism has expanded outside of the Congo. Some smaller communities are in other central African countries, as well as Belgium, France, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\nThe spiritual leader is the supreme authority of the church. He is followed by the elders, who are the highest level of the Kimbanguist clergy. National and regional representatives make the second level of the leadership of the church. Decisions are made by the elders during meetings of representatives from the congregations. The Kimbanguist Church has its headquarters in N'kamba, the hometown of Simon Kimbangu, which is considered \u201cthe New Jerusalem.\u201d Baptism is required to become a member of the church."}

{"id": "720097", "revid": "396686", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=720097", "title": "Pramoedya Ananta Toer", "text": "Pramoedya Ananta Toer (6 February 1925 \u2013 30 April 2006) was an Indonesian writer. He wrote novels, short stories, essays, and histories of Indonesia and its people. His writing includes much personal and national history. The Dutch Government put him in prison him from 1947 to 1949. Later, the Suharto government sent him to a prison island from 1965 to 1979.\nColonial and later authoritarian governments did not approve of Pramoedya's writings. They often censored his writing in Indonesia even though he was well known outside his home country. The Dutch imprisoned him from 1947 to 1949 during the War of Independence. During the coup when Suharto gained power, Pramoedya was involved in political fighting. Suharto put him in prison from 1969 to 1979 on the Maluku island called Buru. Suharto called Pramoedya a Communist. Suharto thought Pramoedya was still loyal to the Sukarno government even though Pramoedya had struggled with Sukarno.\nHe created his most famous work, the Buru Quartet, on the prison island. The prison did not allow him to have writing materials, so he told the story aloud to other prisoners. Then it was written down and smuggled out.\nPramoedya was against some policies of Indonesia's first President, Sukarno, and against the New Order regime of Suharto. Often, he did not make direct political criticisms. His writing was subtle. He was outspoken against colonialism, racism and the corruption of the Indonesian Government. During the many years he suffered in prison and house arrest, human rights advocates fought for his freedom of expression.\nEarly years.\nPramoedya was born on February 6, 1925, in Blora in central Java, then a part of the Dutch East Indies. He was the oldest son in his family. Pramoedya's father was a teacher. His father was also active in Boedi Oetomo (the first recognized indigenous national organization in Indonesia). Pramoedya's mother was a rice trader. His maternal grandfather had made the pilgrimage to Mecca. As it is written in his semi-autobiographical collection of short stories \"Cerita Dari Blora\", his name was originally Pramoedya Ananta Mastoer. But he felt that the family name Mastoer was too aristocratic. The Javanese prefix \"Mas\" means a man of the higher rank in a noble family. So, he removes \"Mas\" and kept Toer as his family name. Pramoedya went to the Radio Vocational School in Surabaya but had just graduated when Japan invaded Surabaya in 1942.\nDuring World War II, Pramoedya supported the occupying forces of Imperial Japan at first. He believed the Japanese to be bad but better than the Dutch. He worked as a typist for a Japanese newspaper in Jakarta. However as the war went on, Indonesians opposed harsh treatment by the Japanese military and wartime rationing. The Nationalist forces loyal to Sukarno switched their support to the incoming Allies against Japan. Pramoedya did as well.\nOn August 17, 1945, after the news of Allied victory over Japan reached Indonesia, Sukarno proclaimed Indonesian independence. This started the Indonesian National Revolution against the British and Dutch. In this war, Pramoedya joined a paramilitary group in Karawang, Kranji (West Java). He was sent to Jakarta. In Jakarta, he wrote short stories and books, and propaganda for the Nationalist cause. The Dutch put him in Bukit Duri prison in Jakarta from 1947 until 1949, the year the Netherlands recognized Indonesian independence. While in prison, he wrote his first major novel, \"The Fugitive\".\nImportance after Indonesia became independent.\nIn the first years after Indonesia became independent, Pramoedya wrote stories about the problems of the new nation. He also wrote semi-autobiographical works based on his memoirs during World War II. Then he went to live in the Netherlands as part of a cultural exchange program. Later he went on several other cultural exchanges, including trips to the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.\nIn Indonesia, Pramoedya built up a reputation as a critic of literature and society. He joined the left-wing writers' group Lekra and wrote in newspapers and literary journals. His writing style became more political. One example is his story \"Korupsi\" (\"Corruption\"). It is the story of a civil servant who falls into the trap of corruption. This caused problems for him with the Sukarno government.\nFrom the late 1950s, Pramoedya began teaching literary history at the \"Universitas Res Publica\". That university was politically left-wing. As he prepared lessons, he began to realise that ideas about Indonesian language and literature had been distorted by the Dutch colonial authorities. He searched for materials that had been ignored by colonial educational institutions and by Indonesians after independence.\nPramoedya had spent time in China, so he had good feelings towards Indonesian Chinese people. This was unusual in Indonesia after independence. The Indonesian government had made many laws restricting Indonesian Chinese people's freedom and ethnic Malay or Javanese people often discriminated against Indonesian Chinese. Pramoedya published a series of letters to an imaginary Chinese correspondent discussing the history of the Indonesian Chinese, called \"Hoakiau di Indonesia\" (History of the Overseas Chinese in Indonesia). He criticized the government for being too Java-centric and insensitive to the needs and desires of the other regions and peoples of Indonesia. As a result, he was arrested by the Indonesian military and jailed at Cipinang prison for nine months.\nImprisonment under Suharto.\nIn an October 1965 coup the army took power after making a false claim that the assassination of several senior generals was organized by the Communist Party of Indonesia. This was the start of Suharto's New Order. This government was violently anti-communist. Pramoedya was head of People's Cultural Organisation, a literary group connected to the Indonesian Communist Party. So, the New Order regime called him a communist and enemy of the state. During the violent anti-Communist purge in 1965-66, Pramoedya was arrested, beaten, and imprisoned by Suharto's government. He was named a political prisoner. His books were banned and he was imprisoned without trial, first in Nusa Kambangan off the southern coast of Java, and then in the penal colony Buru in the eastern islands of the Indonesian archipelago.\nHe was banned from writing during his imprisonment on the island of Buru, but created his best-known series of work, the Buru Quartet. It is a series of four historical fiction novels telling about the development of Indonesian nationalism. The books are partly based on his own experiences growing up. The English titles of the books are: \"This Earth of Mankind\", \"Child of All Nations\", \"Footsteps\", and \"House of Glass\". The main character of the series is named Minke. He is a minor Javanese royal. The character is similar to an Indonesian journalist named Tirto Adhi Surjo. He was active in the nationalist movement.\nThe quartet includes strong female characters of Indonesian and Chinese ethnicity. The books show how hard it was for these people to live under colonial rule. They experienced racist discrimination and attacks. They struggled for personal and national political independence. These books are typical of much of Pramoedya's writing. They tell personal stories and focus on individuals caught up in the movements of a nation's history.\nPramoedya had done research for the books before he was sent to the Buru prison camp. When he was arrested his library was burned and much of his collection and early writings were lost. On the prison colony island of Buru he was not permitted even to have a pencil. Pramoedya thought that he would ever be able to write the novels on paper. He told the stories of the novels to his fellow prisoners. Other prisoners listened to the stories then helped him. They did extra labor so that Pramoedya did not have to work as much. So finally he was able to write the novels down. The final books took their name, \"Buru Quartet,\" from the prison where he created them. They have been collected and published in English. Maxwell Lane translated them. They are also in many other languages. By 2005, they had been published in 33 languages (BIWP). Many people outside of Indonesia though that these were excellent books. They won many awards. But the Indonesian government banned their publication in Indonesia. So one of Indonesia's most famous literary works was almost impossible to find the country's people whose history it addressed. Indonesians abroad scanned copies and shared them on the Internet with people inside the country.\nPramoedya's works on colonial Indonesia recognised the importance of Islam as a vehicle for popular opposition to the Dutch. His works are not about religion and do not have clear religious themes. He opposed people who used religion to control how people think. Sometimes he wrote negatively about the religiously pious.\nFreed from prison and later writing.\nPramoedya was freed from prison in 1979. But, he was still under house arrest in Jakarta until 1992. During this time he released \"The Girl From the Coast\", another semi-fictional novel based on his grandmother's own experience (volumes 2 and 3 of this work were destroyed along with his library in 1965). He also wrote \"Nyanyi Sunyi Seorang Bisu\" (1995); \"A Mute's Soliloquy\", an autobiography based on the letters that he wrote for his daughter from imprisonment in Buru but were not allowed to be sent, and \"Arus Balik\" (1995).\nHe wrote many columns and short articles criticizing the Indonesian government. He wrote a book called \"Perawan Remaja dalam Cengkeraman Militer\" (\"Young Virgins in the Military's Grip\"), a documentary written showcasing the plight of Javanese women who were forced to become comfort women during the Japanese occupation and were subsequently subject to oppression by their own Indonesian society. The Japanese military took these women to Buru island. They were raped and sexually abused by the Japanese. Many stayed there instead of returning to Java. Other political prisoners on Buru with Pramoedya were able to meet some of these women. They told the women's stories to Pramoedya. He wrote them down in narrative form in the 1970s. This was the start of the book published in 2001.\nPramoedya was hospitalized on April 27, 2006 for complications from diabetes and heart disease. He was also a heavy smoker of Kretek (clove) cigarettes and had endured years of abuse while in detention. Pramoedya was praised for his writing and won many awards. Many thought he was the best candidate for a Nobel Prize in Literature from Indonesia and Southeast Asia.\nPramoedya's writings on Indonesia address the international and regional currents caused by political events in history and how these events flowed through his homeland and buffeted its people. Pramoedya also shares a personal history of hardship and detention for his efforts of self-expression and the political aspects of his writings, and struggled against the censorship of his work by the leaders of his own people.\nFurther reading.\nBooks on Pramoedya Ananta Toer"}

During the post-Meiji restoration cadastral reform of April 1, 1889, Herai Village and neighboring Nozawa Village were formed. On July 29, 1955 the western portion of Nozawa Village merged into Herai, which was then renamed Shing\u014d.\nEducation.\nShing\u014d has two public elementary schools and two public middle schools operated by the village government.

It is called the \"Tomb of Jesus\" (\"Kirisuto no haka\"). It's also where Jesus' last descendants, the family of Sajiro Sawaguchi, lives. The Sawaguchi family says that Jesus Christ did not die on the cross at Golgotha. Instead, his brother, Isukiri, took his place on the cross. Jesus left, and he went through Siberia to Mutsu Province (in northern Japan). Once in Japan, he changed his name to Torai Tora Daitenku. He became a rice farmer, and he married a twenty-year old Japanese woman named Miyuko. He raised three daughters near what is now Shing\u014d. While in Japan, he supposedly traveled around. He supposedly died at the age of 106. His body was exposed on a hilltop for four years. Jesus' bones were collected, bundled, and buried in the mound said to be the grave of Jesus Christ.\nAnother mound near the supposed grave of Jesus is said to have an ear of the brother of Jesus. It is also said to have some hair from Mary, the mother of Jesus. They were the only things from his family that Jesus could carry when he left Judaea. The claims started in 1933 after the people found supposed \"ancient Hebrew documents about Jesus' life and death in Japan.\" They were supposedly the from Jesus. These documents are called the Takeuchi Documents. They are said to be very old documents that were passed down through the family of Takeuchi Kiyomaro. The documents were supposedly taken by the Japanese authorities, and the documents were taken to Tokyo, shortly before World War II. They have not been seen since."}

He named it after the county. \"Center\" was added to its name to indicate its location in the central part of the county. County residents initially voted to place the county seat in Lincoln Center. However, elections in November 1870 led to the seat being moved to nearby Abram. This started a county seat war. Another vote in February 1872 reversed the switch, and Lincoln Center became the permanent county seat. The people moved all the buildings in Abram to Lincoln, combining the two communities. In 1879, the town was incorporated as the city of Lincoln Center. It is still officially called \"Lincoln Center\" in the United States Census. However, both the city government and local chamber of commerce call the city Lincoln. It shows as \"Lincoln\" on state maps and signs.\nIn 1906, the city's first power plant opened, providing electric power. By 1950, the state highway commission had completed K-14 and K-18 through Lincoln.\nIn 1989, because Lincoln had been using post rock limestone in local buildings for so long, the Kansas Legislature named Lincoln County as \"The Post Rock Capital of Kansas\".\nGeography.\nLincoln Center is at (39.041744, -98.146760).

In versions 1 and 2, it was used to create automation scripts for Microsoft Windows programs. These are sometimes called macros. In version 3, the programming language was extended to allow it to do more things.\nThe scripting language in AutoIt 1 and 2 was statement-driven. It was designed to simulate a user's input to the computer. From version 3 onward, the AutoIt syntax changed. It is now similar to the BASIC programming language. AutoIt version 3 is a general-purpose programming language. It can have types of data, such as arrays.\nAn AutoIt script can be converted into a stand-alone executable. This can be run on computers that do not have the AutoIt interpreter installed. A wide range of function libraries are available. They are known as UDFs, or \"User Defined Functions\". Some are included as standard. Others are available from the website. They add extra abilities to the language. AutoIt has a special editor, an Integrated development environment or IDE. It is based on the free SciTE editor. The compiler and help text are included in this special editor and provide a standard environment for developers.\nUsage.\nAutoIt is often used to produce utility software for Microsoft Windows. These programs can automate routine tasks. Example use includes: systems management, monitoring, maintenance, and software installation. It is also used to simulate user interaction. In this use an application is \"driven\" to do things by an AutoIt script which behaves like a human user. An AutoIT script can issue keypresses, mouse clicks, type text and so on. In this way it simulates a human user of an application.\nAutoIt has been used in low-cost laboratory automation. Applications include instrument synchronisation, alarm monitoring and results gathering. Devices such as 3D-printers can also be controlled.\nLicense.\nThe developers of AutoIt originally released the source code under the GNU General Public License (GPL). \nIn 2006, the license was changed for version 3.2.0 and later versions to their own closed source license.\nSome of the code from version 3.1 was used to create a fork by the AutoHotkey project.

It was written by Al Hunter Ashton for the BBC.\nIt stars Gary Oldman, Phil Davis, Charles Lawson and Steve McFadden.\nThe film is based on the activities of the Inter City Firm, a football firm of West Ham United during the 1970s and 1980s.\nThe film, courted controversy on release. It has come to be regarded among the best films on the subject of football hooliganism.\nIt is notable for having almost no background music. The only music is over the opening titles. It is Dean Martin's rendition of \"That's Amore\".\nOldman's performance has been hailed as one of the greatest of his career.\nPlot.\nClive Bissel (nicknamed \"Bex\", or \"Bexy\") is a married man with a baby son. He is the leader of a hooligan firm known as the ICC (Inter City Crew). His wife disapproves of his activities as a football hooligan. These contrast to his respectable job as an estate agent. He is unwilling to give up violence as it gives him a \"buzz\".\nBexy's father accepts his son's lifestyle. He takes a group photograph of the 'tooled up' gang. He boasts that he did similar activities when younger. He feels that Bex has gone soft because they now use weapons.\nThe film begins with a rival gang called \"The Buccaneers\" vandalising Bexy's Ford Sierra XR4x4. While Bexy is playing football, they spray graffiti in the dressing room. Yeti, the leader of the Bucaneeers drives a white Volkswagen Golf GTi cabriolet across the football pitch.\nBexy wants to form a 'National Firm' made up from rival gangs. He wants this 'firm' to be big enough to take on the large international hooligan groups. Bexy meets leaders from other firms in the Tower Hotel in London. This includes the Buccaneers. The other gangs like the idea. They do not like the idea of Bexy being \"top boy\". The rival firms agree to fight each other to decide who will lead the new \"firm\" into Europe.\nBexy uses intimidation to keep his position as leader of the ICC. The young men think of themselves as respected figures in their local community. Bexy's wife tells him that is not correct. She says everyone thinks of him as a joke. She says they fear his violent nature, so few are willing to stand up to him.\nThe ICC survive violent clashes with the other gangs. They must still defeat the Buccaneers. Bexy is looking forward to defeating Yeti. Bexy beats up Yeti during the ICC's clash with the Buccaneers. He is shot dead by an injured Yeti.\nThe closing scene depicts the surviving ICC members in a pub. They honour Bexy as a hero. They will fight the European firms in memory of their dead leader. The hooligans agree that Bex was a visionary who brought them together. They give him legendary status. They vow to continue.\nReception and legacy.\n\"The Firm\" proved controversial.\nIt has been both celebrated and condemned for its violent content.\nTom Dawson in \"The List\" reported that it \"is widely considered to be the toughest and most insightful screen depiction of football hooligans\".\n\"Vice\" critic Harry Sword wrote that \"\"The Firm\" remains the definitive celluloid document on football hooliganism\".\nPhilip French in \"The Observer\" described the film as \"by some way the best movie on the subject of football hooliganism and a key text on the subject of Thatcher's Britain.\"\nFilm4 hailed \"The Firm\" as a \"brilliant and compelling drama\". It features Oldman \"at his visceral, intense best\".\nJosh Winning of \"Total Film\" observed its \"unflinching depictions of violence\". He named Oldman's \"stunning\" performance as the best of his career.\nIn 2018, Matthew Thrift of the British Film Institute wrote that Bissell \"remains probably Gary Oldman's greatest screen performance\".\n\"The Firm\" has been described as a cult classic.\nHome media releases.\nThe film was first released on VHS on 21 Oct 1996. It was in a double pack with the similarly themed ID.\nA DVD was first released by Prism Leisure on 2 Feb 2004.\nThe film has been sold as part of numerous box-sets. These often include films of a similar nature or from director Alan Clarke.\nOn 10 Sep 2007, the BBC released a special edition DVD in collectible SteelBook packaging. Extra features on the special edition include:\nA version of the film was included in the 2016 DVD set \"Alan Clarke at the BBC, Volume 2: Disruption\". This version includes censored scenes restored from tape. The new scenes include: a more graphic version of Bex's blinding of Oboe, a scene of Bex mock-raping his wife, and Bex performing a knife attack on Yeti's private parts).\nIt was also released as a stand-alone DVD. Both releases were under the British Film Institute's control.\nRemake.\nThe story was adapted by Nick Love into the 2009 film of the same name."}

They came top of the \"folding and faulting\" category. \nThe cliffs have a series of horizontal chevron folds. The rocks were once sedimentary rocks laid down in deep water during the Devonian and Carboniferous periods. We know this because they still contain brachiopod fossils of a type which lived in the late Devonian period. Later they were altered by heat from granite during mountain building in the English counties of Devon and Cornwall.\nThe Variscan orogeny caused the intrusion of the hot granite. The subsequent contact with the sandstones created the metamorphic rocks seen today. This also put intense pressure on the sediments causing them to be folded and faulted. What we see is a small part of a huge mountain system caused by a continental collision between Euramerica (Laurussia) and Gondwana. This formed the supercontinent of Pangaea."}

{"id": "721199", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=721199", "title": "Duty to rescue", "text": "Duty to rescue is a concept that many law systems have: In certain cirumstances, someone can be held responsible for not helping another person who is in danger, and who would be injured, or who would die, if not helped. People are required to help to the best of their abilities. As a bare minimum, this often means alerting emergency services. \nNot all law systems have this concept, and in general the following is true:\nThose helping are often protected by law, against errors they make.\nIn many cases, the duty to rescue has become customary law. This is the case for example for helping people at sea.\nMoral duty to help.\nA moral or ethical duty to rescue may exist even where there is no legal duty to rescue. Such a duty can be justified in different ways.\nOne kind of justification is general and applies regardless of role-related relationships: Under this general justification, people have a duty to rescue other people in distress because of their common humanity. With this justification, the specific skills of the rescuer or the nature of the victim's distress are irrelevant. \nThis kind would justify cases of rescue and in fact make such rescue a duty even between strangers. With this justification in mind, philosopher Peter Singer suggests that if one saw a child drowning and could intervene to save him, they should do so, if the cost is moderate to themselves. Damage to their clothing or shoes or how late it might make them for a meeting would be an insufficient excuse to avoid assistance. Singer goes on to say that one should also try to rescue distant strangers, not just nearby children, because globalization has made it possible to do so. Such general arguments for a duty to rescue also explain why after the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Haitians were digging family members, friends, and strangers out of the rubble with their bare hands and carrying injured persons to whatever medical care was available. It also explains why, journalist and physician Sanjay Gupta and a number of other MD-journalists began acting as physicians to treat injuries rather than remaining uninvolved in their journalistic roles. Similarly, they justify journalist Anderson Cooper's attempt to shepherd an injured young boy away from some \"toughs\" nearby in the aftermath of the Haiti earthquake.\nSpecific arguments for such a duty to rescue include:\nThere are also ethical justifications for role-specific or skill-specific duties of rescue such as those described above under the discussion of U.S. Common Law. Generally, these justifications are rooted in the idea that the \"best\" rescues, the most effective rescues, are done by those with special skills. Such persons, when available to rescue, are thus even more required to do so ethically than regular persons who might simply make things worse (for a utilitarian, rescue by a skilled professional in a relevant field would maximize the good even better than rescue by a regular stranger). This particular ethical argument makes sense when considering the ability firefighters to get both themselves and victims safely out of a burning building, or of health care personnel such as physicians, nurses, physician's assistants, and EMTs to provide medical rescue."}

Maria Aitken received a nomination for Best Supporting Actress.\nCleese received a nomination for best actor and Curtis received a nomination for best Actress at the Golden Globes\nAnother movie called \"Fierce Creatures\" came out in 1997. The same actors star in it but play different characters. It does not continue the story of A Fish Called Wanda.\nPlot.\nGeorge Thomason and Ken Pile are gangsters in London. Ken loves animals and he has a stutter. They plan to steal a jewels. They ask two Americans for help: con artist Wanda Gershwitz and weapons expert Otto West. Otto is a stupid and mean. Also, he does not like British people. Wanda and Otto are lovers. They hide this from George and Ken by pretending to be siblings. This frees Wanda to work her charms on them.\nThe robbery is successful and the gang escapes with a lot of diamonds. They hide them in a safe in an old workshop. Wanda and Otto betray George to the police and he is arrested. They return to collect the diamonds. Wanda plans to double-cross Otto as well. She finds that George has moved the diamonds. Wanda discovers the key to the safe deposit box containing the diamonds in Ken's fish tank. She hides it in her pendant.\nWanda seduces George's barrister, Archie Leach. Archie is in a loveless marriage. He quickly falls for Wanda. She gets him to persuade George to plead guilty and to tell the location of the diamonds. Otto is jealous. His interference causes Wanda and Archie's liaisons to go disastrously wrong. Wanda accidentally leaves her pendant at Archie's house. Archie's wife, Wendy, mistakes it as a gift for her. At Wanda's insistence, Archie recovers the pendant by staging a burglary. Archie feels guilty and ends the affair.\nGeorge asks Ken to kill Mrs Coady. She is the Crown's only eyewitness to the robbery. Ken tries three times. Each time he accidentally kills one of her dogs instead. This causes him great distress. The last dog's death gives her a fatal heart attack. So Otto is successful. With no witness, George seems poised to get off soon. He reveals the location of the diamonds to Ken. Otto learns Ken now knows where they are. Otto tries to force Ken to reveal where the diamonds are by eating his pet fish. He leaves Ken's favourite, named Wanda, until last. Ken reveals that the diamonds are at a hotel near Heathrow Airport.\nWith Otto's knowledge and Wanda's key, the pair want George to remain in jail. At his trial, defence witness Wanda unexpectedly gives evidence against him. Archie is stunned. He is flustered and messess up his questioning. He inadvertently calls Wanda \"darling\". Wendy realises that Archie has had an affair. She declares their marriage over.\nWith no career and no marriage, Archie resolves to cut his losses, steal the diamonds for himself and flee to South America. George tells Archie that Ken knows where the diamonds are. Archie sees Wanda fleeing the courthouse. He pulls her into his car and races to Ken's flat. As Archie runs into the building, Otto steals Archie's car, taking Wanda with him. Ken and Archie give chase. Otto and Wanda recover the diamonds. Wanda double-crosses Otto and leaves him unconscious in a broom cupboard. After recovering, Otto shoots his way out and is confronted by Archie. Otto is about to kill Archie. Archie stalls him by taunting Otto about American failures such as the Vietnam War. Ken arrives, driving a steamroller, seeking vengeance for his fish. Otto, who has stepped in wet concrete and cannot move, is run over but survives. Archie and Wanda board the plane. Otto clings to the outside of the plane. He curses them until he is blown off as the plane takes off.\nProduction.\nIn 1969, Cleese and Crichton tried to make a film together but it never got started.\nThey promised each other that they would work on a film in the future.\nIn June 1983, they began writing the script for \"Wanda\". For the next two and half years they met three times a month to work on the script.\nAccording to Crichton, \"We had a week of rehearsals and then a gap of two weeks in which to incorporate any new ideas which had been thrown up and to polish the script.\"\nAccording to Michael Palin, the original title was \"A Goldfish Called Wanda.\"\nCleese told an interviewer why he called his character Archie Leach. Cary Grant's real name was Archie Leach. Cleese said \"I feel this film is as near as I'll ever get to being Cary Grant.\"\nCleese served as co-director as the studio executives at MGM were worried about Crichton's age. He was 78 years old at the time. On the set, Crichton wore a T-shirt presented to him by Cleese and inscribed \"Age and treachery will always overcome youth and skill\".\nThe film was shot in London during the summer of 1987.\nReception.\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 93% approval rating, based on 61 reviews, with an average rating of 8/10.\n\"Smartly written, smoothly directed, and solidly cast, \"A Fish Called Wanda\" offers a classic example of a brainy comedy with widespread appeal.\"\nOn Metacritic, the film holds a score of 80 out of 100, based on 17 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\"\nSix weeks after release it reached number one at the box office in the United States. It eventually grossed $62,493,712 in the US. It was the number one rental video in the US in 1989.\nDuring the initial run of the film, a Danish audiologist named Ole Bentzen died during a screening when his heart rate rose to an estimated 250\u2013500 beats per minute from laughing at a scene too hard, leading to a fatal heart attack.\nIn 2016, \"Empire\" magazine ranked \"A Fish Called Wanda\" 35th on their list of the 100 best British films. They called it \"a must-own for any British comedy fan\". They said, \"it made possible Richard Curtis's later Brit-com oeuvre by establishing that British eccentricism can sell, revived the world's interest in Ealing comedies, and allowed a character with Cary Grant's real name \u2013 Cleese's bumbling lawyer Archie Leach \u2013 to live again on the big screen\".\nAccolades.\nThe film is number 27 on Bravo's \"100 Funniest Movies\". It is also included in the \"Reader's Digest\" \"100 Funniest Films\" list.\nIn 1999, the British Film Institute ranked it 39th of the BFI Top 100 British films of the 20th century\nIn 2000, the American Film Institute placed the film 21st on its 100 Years...100 Laughs list.\nIn 2003, AFI nominated Otto West as a villain from this film for AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes &amp; Villains.\nJames Berardinelli of \"ReelViews\" awarded the film four out of four stars in his review; it is also number 10 on his \"Top 100\" list.\nSequels and adaptations.\nThe main actors worked together again in 1997 to make \"Fierce Creatures\". It is not a sequel or prequel, but is similar in style to A Fish Called Wanda. It is called a spiritual sequel. The actors played different characters. \"Fierce Creatures\" was not as well received by critics or audiences as \"A Fish Called Wanda\".\nThe novelization of \"Fierce Creatures\", written by Iain Johnstone, who co-wrote the film, begins with a letter from Archie (John Cleese's character in the first film) to his brother Rollo. According to the letter:\nA loose Indian adaptation, \"Padmashree Laloo Prasad Yadav\", was released in 2005.\nIn 2008, it was reported that John Cleese and his daughter, Cynthia (who played his screen daughter, Portia), had started to work on a stage musical version of the film."}

It nurtured the early careers of many actors and actresses. Some of whom went on to achieve national and international reputations. \nArchitectural changes have been made to the building over the years. The latest change was in 1968. A modern-style extension was added to the north of the theatre. \nIn 1999 a trust was formed. This joined the management of the Playhouse with that of the Everyman Theatre.\nHistory.\nIn 1866, the present theatre opened. It was named the Star Music Hall. It was designed by Edward Davies. It replaced an earlier theatre called the Star Concert Hall. \nIn 1895 its name was changed to the Star Theatre of Varieties. \nIn 1898 it was improved by Harry Percival with a new auditorium and foyer. Electricity was installed. \nIn 1911 the Liverpool Repertory Theatre Limited was established. Basil Dean was its \"controller and producer\". The company could not afford to build a new theatre. It bought the Star Theatre for \u00a328,000 (). \nThis made it the first repertory in Britain to own the freehold of a theatre. The company spent a further \u00a34,000 () on redesigning and modernising the theatre. \nThe auditorium and the basement foyer were redesigned by Stanley Adshead. He was the Professor of Civic Design at the Liverpool School of Architecture. \nThe theatre was for many years managed by Maud Carpenter.\nThe theatre was renamed the Liverpool Repertory Theatre.\nIn 1916, it was renamed the Liverpool Playhouse. \nIn 1961 and 1966, minor structural alterations were made to the theatre. \nIn 1968 a modern-style extension was added to the north of the theatre. This was to accommodate new foyers, bars, dressing rooms and a workshop. \nIn the 1990s the theatre company went into liquidation.\nIn 1999 the Liverpool and Merseyside Theatres Trust Limited was established as a charity, and the theatre re-opened. It is managed jointly with the Everyman Theatre by Liverpool City Council.\nArtistes.\nAs a repertory company, the theatre has been involved in the careers of actors and actresses who have later achieved wide fame. No\u00ebl Coward and Gertrude Lawrence worked with the company as child actors. Other artistes who gained experience at the theatre include Robert Donat, Lilian Braithwaite, Cecil Parker, John Gregson, Clive Brook, C. Aubrey Smith, Richard Burton, Michael Redgrave, Diana Wynyard, Rex Harrison, Patricia Routledge, Anthony Hopkins, and Richard Briers.\nArchitecture.\nOlder section.\nThe exterior of the older part of the theatre is stuccoed. It has a slate roof. \nIts entrance faces Williamson Square. It has seven bays and is in three storeys. The central three bays project forward. They are surmounted by a broken pediment. On the ground floor the central bays contain three entrances. These are separated by pillars. These lead to a recessed porch. Over each entrance is an architrave containing a fanlight. The lateral bays contain two round-headed and one flat-headed entrance on each side. There are three blind round windows. In the middle storey the bays are separated by pilasters. The three central bays each have a balustrade and a window with a tympanum containing a roundel. Each of the three lateral bays contains a window with a cornice, and a round window above it. Along the top storey are oculi between panelled pilasters. On the summit of each of the two lateral bays is a cupola on a short Tuscan colonnade. \nInside the older part of the theatre are two balconies. These are supported by cast iron columns. The interior is decorated in Greek Revival style.\nNewer section.\nThe newer section is constructed in concrete. It is mostly faced by glass. \nOn the ground floor are entrance doors. Above this, the building is based around three cylinders. The largest of these starts at the first floor and rises through two storeys. It is cantilevered from a central column. To the left is a smaller cylinder, cantilevered from a separate column, interlocking with the larger cylinder. \nInside the whole is a hollow column containing the stairs.\nAssessment and critique.\nThe theatre is recorded in the National Heritage List for England. On 14 March 1975, it was designated a Grade\u00a0II* listed building. \nThe list quotes the \"Architects' Journal\" of 1968. This says the older section is \"significant as an early and rare work by one of the pioneers of the Liverpool School of Architecture, in the Grecian style favoured by the school at that date\". Of the newer section it says that it is \"a brilliant concept, joyously realised, which exploits asymmetrical volumes and ever varying spaces yet achieves unity and also balance with the adjoining Victorian fa\u00e7ade\". \nIn the \"Buildings of England\" series, the architectural historians Richard Pollard and Nikolaus Pevsner say of the newer section that it is \"a spectacular composition which creates an atmosphere of excitement and anticipation, exactly right for a theatre foyer\"."}

Unveiled during the \"Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2019\" press event held on February 20, 2019, the devices started shipping in certain regions such as Australia and the United States on March 6, 2019, then worldwide on March 8, 2019. It is the tenth generation of Samsung's Galaxy S series of smartphones.\nAs has been done since the Galaxy S6, Samsung unveiled flagship Galaxy S10 and Galaxy S10+ models, differentiated primarily by screen size and an additional front-facing camera on the S10+. In addition, Samsung also unveiled a smaller model known as the Galaxy S10e, as well as a larger, 5G-compatible version, the Galaxy S10 5G. In 2020, a midrange variant, the Galaxy S10 Lite, was also introduced.\nThe Galaxy S10e, S10 and S10+ launch prices started at $749/\u00a3586, $899/\u00a3704 and $999/\u00a3782, while the S10 5G's launch price was $1299.\nOn March 6, 2020, Samsung launched the successor to the S10, the Samsung Galaxy S20.\nSpecifications.\nHardware.\nDisplay.\nThe S10 line comprises five models with various hardware specifications; the main S10 and S10+ respectively feature 6.1 and 6.4-inch 1440p \"Dynamic AMOLED\" displays with HDR10+ support and \"dynamic tone mapping\" technology. The displays have curved sides that slope over the horizontal edges of the device. Unlike previous Samsung phones, their front-facing cameras occupy a rounded cut-out near the top-right of the display, and both models use an ultrasonic in-screen fingerprint reader. While providing better performance over the optical in-screen fingerprint readers introduced by other recent phones, they are not compatible with all screen protectors. Due to this, the S10 and S10+ are both supplied with a pre-installed plastic screen protector.\nChipsets.\nInternational models of the S10 use the Exynos 9820 system-on-chip, while the U.S. and Chinese models use the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855. The two devices are sold with 128 or 512\u00a0GB of internal storage along with 8GB of RAM, with the S10+ also being sold in a 1-terabyte model with 12GB of RAM. They respectively contain 3400 mAh with the standard S10 and 4100 mAh batteries for the S10+ model, supporting Qi inductive charging, and the ability to charge other Qi-compatible devices from their own battery power.\nCameras.\nThe S10 features a 3-lens rear-facing camera setup; it retains the dual-aperture 12-megapixel and 12-megapixel telephoto lenses of the Galaxy S9+, but now uses a camera module introduced on the Note 9 and also adds a 16-megapixel ultra-wide angle lens. The front-facing camera on the S10+ is accompanied by a second RGB depth sensor, which Samsung states helps improve the quality of photo effects and augmented reality image filters. Both sets of cameras support 4K video recording and HDR10+. The camera software includes a new \"Shot Suggestion\" feature to assist users, \"Artistic Live Filters\", as well as the ability to post directly to Instagram posts and stories. S10+ uses a double hole punch design for the front camera, while S10 uses a single hole punch design. The Galaxy S10e and S10 make use of \"advanced heat-pipe\" cooling systems, but the more expensive Galaxy S10 Plus uses a vapor chamber cooling system.\nIn the manual mode, the exposure time can be increased up to ten seconds.\nModels.\nAlongside the main S10 and S10+, Samsung also unveiled two additional models. The S10e is a downsized version of the S10, featuring a smaller, flat, 5.8-inch 1080p display with no curved edges. Its fingerprint reader is contained within the power button on the right side rather than in-display, and it excludes the 12-megapixel telephoto camera of the S10. It still includes the dual-aperture 12-megapixel and 16-megapixel ultra-wide-angle sensors. There is also a larger, phablet-sized premium model known as the S10 5G, which features support for 5G wireless networks, a 6.7-inch display, 256 or 512 GB of non-expandable storage, additional 3D time-of-flight cameras on both the front and rear, and a non-user-replaceable 4,500\u00a0mAh battery. This model was temporarily exclusive to Verizon Wireless on launch in 2019 before expanding to other carriers in the weeks after launch.\nCharging speeds are 45 Watts on the S10 Lite, 25 Watts on the S10 5G and 15 Watts on the S10e.\nThe S10 series (except S10 Lite) is the last model in the Galaxy S series to feature 3.5 mm headphone jack as its successors, the S20, S20+ and S20 Ultra, do not. \nIn January 2020, the S10 Lite was released. It is a midrange variant of the S10, containing the same cameras as the main variant. It features 128 GB of expandable storage, a 6.5 inch 1080p screen on a plastic frame, and a 4,500\u00a0mAh battery. This variant removes the 3.5 mm headphone jack featured on all of the 2019 variants of the S10, as well as wireless charging, instead being equipped with 25 watt Super Fast Charging picked up from the Galaxy Note 10. Unlike the main variants, the S10 Lite is only offered with Snapdragon 855 chipset.\nColours.\nGalaxy S10e, S10, and S10+ are available in the colors Prism White, Prism Black, Prism Green, Prism Blue, Cardinal Red, Flamingo Pink and Smoke Blue. Galaxy S10e is also available in Canary Yellow. Galaxy S10 5G comes in the colors Crown Silver, Majestic Black, and Royal Gold. Galaxy S10+ and Galaxy S10+ Performance Edition offer two additional color choices: Ceramic Black and White. The Performance Edition ceramic models offer 12GB RAM and 1TB of internal storage.\nSoftware.\nThe S10 range ships with Android 9.0 \"Pie\". They are the first Samsung smartphones to ship with a major revamp of Samsung's Android user experience known as One UI. A main design element of One UI is intentional repositioning of key user interface elements in stock apps to improve usability on large screens. Many apps include large headers that push the beginning of content towards the center of the display, while navigation controls and other prompts are often displayed near the bottom of the display instead.\nSamsung released the Android 10 update to the Galaxy S10 series on 28 November 2019. The update includes One UI version 2.0.\nOn 18 August 2020, it was announced by Samsung that all variants of the S10 series would be supported for three generations of Android software updates. \nAn official list released by Samsung on December 2, 2020, further confirmed that all S10 models would be receiving the Android 11 upgrade with One UI 3.\nKnown issues.\nThe fingerprint scanner had a security flaw that allowed anyone to unlock the phone with a silicone screen protector, which also affected the Note 10. Samsung rolled out a patch to fix this problem on October 23, 2019.\nReception.\nDan Seifert from \"The Verge\" gave the S10 a score of 8.5/10, praising its excellent display, performance, battery life, versatile camera system and headphone jack inclusion. However, he noted that the new in-screen fingerprint scanner was slower and more finicky and camera performance was not as good as the Pixel 3's in low light.\nAndrei Frumusanu from \"AnandTech\" reported that the Exynos 9820 performed significantly better than last year's Exynos 9810, although he also stated that the Exynos 9820 still couldn't keep up with the Snapdragon 855. He has not tested the power efficiency of the Exynos 9820 yet.\nMarques Brownlee praised the S10's One UI for improving one-handed usability. He labelled the S10+ as one of the few $1000 smartphones that are worth their price tag.\nJeffrey Van Camp from \"Wired\" rated the S10 9/10 for its all-screen design, fun features, ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, wireless charging with power sharing and headphone jack inclusion. His complaints were that the camera, while fantastic, still couldn't rival the Pixel 3's night shots, it could be difficult to find what the user wanted in the settings menus, wireless power sharing was slow and the edges needed palm rejection.\nThe S10+ received an overall score of 109 from \"DXOMARK\"; it had a photo score of 114, a video score of 97, and a selfie score of 96. The S10 5G received an overall score of 112, tying it as the site's top ranked phone at the time along with the P30 Pro. It had a photo score of 117, a video score of 100, and a selfie score of 97.\nSales of the S10 have exceeded that of the preceding S9, with the S10+ being the most popular model followed by the regular S10 and then the S10e."}

The entire SS was judged to be a criminal organisation at the Nuremberg trials. The fact that Reagan had not been scheduled to visit former Nazi concentration-camp sites compounded the controversy, and a trip to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp was later added to his itinerary.\nOn Sunday 5 May, Reagan and Kohl appeared at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. The U.S. President's speech there, according to \"Time\", was a \"skillful exercise in both the art of eulogy and political damage control.\" Reagan said:\nAll these children of God, under bleak and lifeless mounds, the plainness of which does not even hint at the unspeakable acts that created them. Here they lie, never to hope, never to pray, never to live, never to heal, never to laugh, never to cry... And then, rising above all this cruelty, out of this tragic and nightmarish time, beyond the anguish, the pain and suffering, and for all time, we can and must pledge: never again.\nReagan responded about the controversy: \"This visit has stirred many emotions in the American and German people too.

It is directed by Jeff Fowler.\nIt was originally going to be released on November 8, 2019, but had been delayed because the design for Sonic was criticized by fans. The movie was released in February 14, 2020.\nPlot.\nThe film begins with Sonic running away from Dr. Robotnik. The movie then rewinds to the beginning.\nSonic is shown running in Green Hill Zone, bringing back a flower to Longclaw, Sonic's guardian. Longclaw warns Sonic that somebody could have seen him, but Sonic doesn't believe her. It turns out she is right and multiple people had sawn him, and attack them for his speed. Longclaw gives Sonic her rings, and tells him that they can travel between dimensions, and that Sonic should use them if he is ever spotted. Sonic uses the ring and goes to another dimension. He tries to get back to his home realm, but the gateway closes before he could do so.\nTen years later, Sonic would eventually find his way into Earth. There, Tom Wackowski, on parking duty, is bored and is waiting for a car to speed. He finds a turtle, and his speed gun reads \"0.01\". Then, Sonic passes by, with his speed gun reading 296. He passes by again, this time his gun reads 300. The turtle is in the street, about to get run over when Sonic saves him, and brings him to a forest, and returns home.\nSonic tells the viewers his life, then accidentally drops his rings. He picks them up, and then tells us that if he gets spotted, he will have to migrate to a mushroom planet.\nAfter watching a baseball game, that night, he plays baseball by himself, but realizes that he is alone and runs fast, accidentally causing a horrible power outage across the entire Pacific Coast. The government suggests Dr. Robotnik to figure this out.\nDr. Robotnik joins the investigation, insulting the workers. He uses his technology and one of his drones finds a blue hair left from Sonic. Robotnik identifies this as a \"new species\".\nProduction.\nThe first trailer for Sonic the Hedgehog movie was released to YouTube on April 2019. However, on the video, it received many more dislikes than likes on the trailer. Many fans were concerned that the Sonic design in the trailer looked too human-like, which made it too creepy to them. Paramount had to delay production of the movie so that they could redesign Sonic.\nIn the second trailer, many fans were praised the new design of Sonic. Sonic now appears more similar to how he appears in the original Sonic games.\nReception.\nBox office.\n\"Sonic the Hedgehog\" has earned a total earning of $149 million in the United States and Canada, and in other countries, for a worldwide total of . It was the sixth-highest-grossing film of 2020. It was also highest-grossing superhero film of the year, even more than any film made by Marvel Studios during the 2010s."}

She became the first female doctor in Kansas.\nIn the fall of 1862, Spring Hill was not attacked by Quantrill's Raiders. This is because a farmer talked to them on their way. He convinced them there were soldiers in town. There were not any soldiers in town. This stopped them from continuing. However, in 1863, the Quantrill Raiders did come to Spring Hill.

However, a railroad to come right through the town wanted to go around Spring Hill unless the town paid $15,000. The people did not want to share the costs, so the railroad was moved to about a half-mile east of the town square. The town's businesses then quickly moved closer to the train depot and tracks.\nOn May 20, 1957 around 7:00\u00a0p.m., an F5 tornado, known as the Ruskin Heights tornado, hit Spring Hill.

The members are: Moon Hee-joon, Jang Woo-hyuk, Tony An, Kangta, and Lee Jae-won.\nH.O.T. was successful in South Korea, China, and Japan. They were among the first stars of the Korean Wave in Asia.\nThe group broke up in 2001 after a disagreement with SM Entertainment. However, they later reunited in 2018.\nFormation.\nH.O.T. was formed in 1996 by record producer Lee Soo-man of SM Entertainment. Lee had done a survey of high school students to find out what their ideal pop group would be like. He used this information to create H.O.T.\nThe first member to join was Kangta, who Lee discovered at an amusement park. Next to join were Moon Hee-joon and Lee Jae-won. The fourth to join was Jang Woo-hyuk who Lee found when he won first place in a dance contest. Finally, Tony An joined the group after an audition in Los Angeles.\nCareer.\n1996\u20131997.\nH.O.T. made their first album in September 1996. It is called \"We Hate All Kinds of Violence\" and sold 1.5 million copies. Their first single was \"Descendants of Warriors\" which was a criticism of bullying. Their second single, \"Candy,\" was a cheerful bubblegum pop song. That year, H.O.T. won Best New Artist at the Golden Disc Awards.\nIn July 1997, H.O.T. released their second album. It has the title \"Wolf and Sheep,\" and sold 1 million copies in ten days. The album included the singles \"Wolf and Sheep,\" \"Happiness,\" and \"We Are the Future\". The album won the Grand Prize at both the 1997 Golden Disc Awards and the 1997 Seoul Music Awards.

With their success came the rise of K-pop fan culture.\nIn 1997, H.O.T. made their first Chinese album.\n1998.\nH.O.T. released their third album in September 1998. The title is \"Resurrection\" and it included a variety of styles. It had sold more than 1.1 million copies by the following year. At the 1998 Seoul Music Awards, it was awarded the Grand Prize.\nSome accused the group of plagiarism as their song \"Line Up!\" was similar to a song by Rage Against the Machine.\n1999\u20132000.\nH.O.T. made greatest hits album in April 1999. Then in June, they sang with Michael Jackson and S.E.S. at a concert in Seoul.\nIn September 1999, H.O.T. released their fourth album. It had the title \"I Yah!\". The title track is about a 1999 fire that killed kindergarten students at the Sealand Youth Training Center in South Korea. The album sold more than 1.3 million copies. That month, H.O.T. also became the first K-pop group to perform at the Seoul Olympic Stadium.\n2000.\nIn February 2000, H.O.T. held their first concert in China.

This inspired other South Korean groups to also hold concerts in China.\nIn September they released their fifth called \"Outside Castle\".\nThat year, the group also starred in the sci-fi movie \"Age of Peace\". Despite H.O.T.'s popularity at the time, the movie was not a hit.\n2001: Disbandment.\nH.O.T. announced in May 2001 that the group would break up. The members told the public that this was due to a contract dispute with S.M. Entertainment. In the following days, hundreds of fans protested outside of S.M. Entertainment. Some fans blocked roads and threw rocks at the company's windows.\n2018: Reunion.\nIn February 2018, H.O.T. appeared as a group on the South Korean television show \"Infinite Challenge\". This was their first appearance as a group since 2003.\nOn October 13 and 14, the group held a reunion concert at the Seoul Olympic Main Stadium with 100,000 present."}

When all twenty-six characters have spoken, the youths rhythmically stamp their feet and sing offstage.\nOriginally a rite of passage at the age of seventeen to mark the formal acceptance of the eldest son into the community of the twenty-two families of Kami-fukawa, the Daimokutate is now performed annually in mid-October by young men of various ages and from many different families.Unique in Japan as a dramatic performance without acting or music, the Daimokutate is an important marker of identity and plays an indispensable role in maintaining solidarity in this mountainous town.\nHistory.\nThe Daimokutate was performed around the end of the Muromachi period (XVI century). Daimokutate is the last living example of a tradition of reciting in sanctuary by ordinary people, attested for the first time in a document of 1534.\nDocuments collected by the folklore specialist Hosen Jungo between 1953 and 1955, have been preserved, but it is likely that the repertoire was much larger.\nDaimokutate was inscribed in 2009 on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of Unesco ."}

The nearby monastery at Sanahin was built around the same time. \nThe largest church in the complex, the Cathedral of Surb Nishan, probably begun in 976, was completed in 991 by king Smbat.

Lowrey (1871-1955). He was a Chicago-based industrialist and entrepreneur. It was in 1955, the year he died, that Lowrey's full-sized electronic organ was first commercially successful. It was called the Model S Spinet or \"Berkshire\".\nLowrey had earlier developed an attachment for a piano. This added electronic organ stops on 60 notes while keeping the piano functionality. It was called the \"Organo\". It was first sold in 1949 It was a successful competitor to the Hammond \"Solovox\".\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, Lowrey was the largest manufacturer of electronic organs in the world. In 1989, the Lowrey Organ Company produced its 1,000,000th organ.\nUp until 2011, Lowrey organs were built in LaGrange Park, Illinois. In 2011, it was announced that some models would be made in Indonesia.\nHistory.\nFrom 1918-1940's, Frederick Lowrey experimented with electronic organ design. He tried different methods of tone generation. In the 1940s he fixed on the Eccles-Jordan circuit. This is a stable flip-flop oscillator. It became a Lowrey hallmark. The Lowrey organ relied on all-electronic tone generation. This was different to its main competitor, the Hammond organ. Hammond used electromechanical tonewheels until 1975. Lowrey led Hammond in the development of automatic accompaniment features. In 1968, automatic rhythm was added. In 1970, the \"Genie\" model added automatic left hand and pedal. Lowrey originally targeted the home entertainment market. Lowrey also produced theatre organs and a full 2-manual with pedal church organ. \nNotable users.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Lowreys were used by some rock groups. \nGarth Hudson, the keyboardist of The Band, played a Lowrey Festival organ on many of the group's most notable songs.\nIts sound can be heard prominently on the 1968 recording of \"Chest Fever\", which begins with a Bach-inspired prelude/intro. \nThe Beatles' 1967 song \"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\" included use of a Lowrey organ. It was used to help create a fairground atmosphere. \nA Lowrey DSO Heritage organ was used to produce the opening for \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\".\nThe Who song \"Baba O'Riley\" used a Lowrey Organ, on a percussive \"marimba repeat\" setting, to give the synthesizer-like background noise. \nMike Oldfield made use of the instrument quite extensively on his \"Tubular Bells\" album, and on several later albums as well. The Gotye song \"State of the Art\" was written to showcase the sounds of the Lowrey Cotillion model D-575.\nLater Models.\nFrom 1966 to 1971, Lowrey produced combo organs for the guitar maker Gibson. The most popular of these was made in 1966, called the Kalamazoo K-101, but was soon renamed the Gibson G-101. The Gibson branded organs' design and circuitry were based on Lowrey's \"T-1\", \"T-2\", \"TLO-R\" and \"Holiday\" spinet models. They had several additional features that made their sound distinctive from the Lowrey models. The extra effects included \"Repeat\", \"Glide\", and \"Trumpet Wow-wow\".\nIn the late 1970s, selling features of Lowrey home organs included Magic Genie Chords, Track III Rhythm and the Automatic Organ Computer.\nIn the 1980s, Lowrey launched the MicroGenie series of portable organs. These had built-in speakers. Some models could run on batteries. They including the MicroGenie V60, V100/101, V105, V120, V125 and MicroGenie Pro V600 (which was programmable and had MIDI capability).\nPurchase by Kawai.\nIn 1988, Lowrey was purchased by Kawai. \nOn October 5, 2018, Vice-President of Lowery Division of Kawai America Corp., Seijiro Imamura, announced that Lowery Organ production would cease in January 2019.

Ifugao is known for its terraced rice fields in the mountains. This tradition is practiced during rice planting, as well as in funerals and funeral rituals. The hudhud probably dates from before the seventh century and consists of over 200 stories of 40 episodes each. The full recitation lasts several days. \nCultural importance.\nAs Ifugao has a matrilineal culture, it is usually the wife who leads in these stories, and her brother occupies a higher position than her husband. Thus, the hudhud has value as an anthropological document. The language of stories, rich in figurative expressions and repetitions, uses metonymies, metaphors and onomatopoeias, which makes transcription very difficult. There are very few written documents of this tradition. The stories evoke ancient heroes, religious beliefs, traditional practices, and reflect the importance of rice cultivation. The narrators, especially the older women, occupy important positions in the community, as priestesses and as holders of history. The hudhud epics are alternately sung by the first reciter and the choir. \nAttempts to keep Hudhud alive.\nIfugao's conversion to Catholicism weakened his traditional culture. The hudhud has been associated with manual rice harvesting, and this task is now mechanized.The terraced rice fields are inscribed on the World Heritage List under the name \" Terraced Rice Fields of the Philippine Ranges \", the number of farmers is constantly falling. The last reciters are already very old and need support in their efforts to transmit their knowledge and sensitize young people. But with support from organizations including the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA), the hudhud is increasingly being appreciated by the younger Ifugaos today. \nIn 2008 UNESCO integrated the \"Hudhud, sung accounts of the Ifugao\" into the representative list of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. \nTo encourage the involvement of the community and to ensure the continuous practice of the hudhud in its social-cultural context, the Hudhud Perpetual Award was created and launched in 2006. The annual award encourages the chanting of the stories during harvests, wakes, and bone washing (bogwa) occasions in the participating municipalities."}

Quonset huts are made at a factory and then later put together at their location. They use steel that is corrugated and galvanized.\nThe Quonset hut was first designed in the United States. It was based on the Nissen hut, which was made by the British during World War I. Hundreds of thousands of Quonset huts were made during World War II. After the war, the left over huts were sold to the public. The name comes from the site where they were first made. This was Quonset Point at the Davisville Naval Construction Battalion Center in Davisville, Rhode Island.\nDesign and history.\nThe first Quonset huts were made in 1941 for the United States Navy. They needed a building that could be used for many different purposes. At the same time, it had to be light and easy to ship. It also had to be possible to put it together without skilled workers. The George A. Fuller construction company made the first Quonset huts. They were made within 60 days of signing the contract. Afterwards Quonset huts were made by many factories around the world.\nThe original design was a \u00d7 building with a radius. The most common design was \u00d7 with a radius. This created of usable floor space with optional overhangs at each end to protect the entrances from the weather. Other sizes were also made.\nThe sides were made from corrugated steel sheets. The two ends were covered with plywood which had doors and windows. The inside was insulated and had pressed wood lining and a wood floor. The building could be placed on concrete, on pilings, or directly on the ground with a wood floor. The inside space was open, so it could be used for a variety of purposes. Some uses were as barracks, latrines, medical and dental offices, isolation wards, housing, and bakeries.\nAbout 150,000 to 170,000 Quonset huts were made during World War II. The military then sold the extra huts to the public after the war. Many are still used in the United States for various purposes. Some are also still in active use at the United States military bases."}

The Planck scale is the physical scale beyond which current physical theories may not apply and cannot be used to calculate what happened. At this time scale, every physical quantities like temperature, energies etc were in the range of Planck units values. During the Planck epoch, the temperature and average energies within the universe were so high that even subatomic particles could not form and even the four fundamental forces that shape our universe were combined and formed one unified fundamental force.\nTraditional Big Bang cosmology predicts a gravitational singularity before this time, but this theory relies on the theory of general relativity, which is thought to break down for this epoch due to quantum effects. Due to the extraordinarily small scale of the universe at that time, the quantum effects of gravity were the strongest and it is believed that cosmology and physics are assumed to have been dominated by the quantum effects of gravity. At this scale, the unified force is assumed to be unified with gravitation. Immeasurably hot and dense state of the Planck epoch is succeeded by the grand unification epoch, where gravitation force is separated from the unified fundamental force."}

It was also the former name of the theatre it owned and operated. The theatre opened in 1975. In 2008, the company ceased and the theatre closed. \nThe Derby Playhouse company had a national reputation for its productions. It premiered new theatrical works and the regional premieres of others.\nIn 2009, the theatre was reopened as the Derby Theatre. It is owned and operated by the University of Derby. \nHistory.\nIn 1948, the original Playhouse opened as the Little Theatre in a converted church hall on Becket Street. \nIn 1952, the company moved to a venue in Sacheverel Street.\nIn 1956, it survived a major fire.\nIn the 1960s and early 1970s the British government invested in the Arts Council of Great Britain's \"Housing the Arts\" fund. The fund enabled cities to renovate existing theatres and commission new ones. In response, the company formed the New Theatre Trust to fund its own purpose-built theatre. Roderick Ham was commissioned to design the new theatre. \nDerby City Council offered the land. This was part of the new Eagle Centre shopping development. \nThe new Derby Playhouse was opened on 20 September 1975 by the 11th Duke of Devonshire. It had a seating capacity of 535.\nIn 2002, the company had money problems. It had a debt of \u00a3400,000, the biggest in its history, and it nearly closed. \nBy 2004 it had recovered and was breaking box-office records.\nIn 2007, the company again ran into serious money problems. The Board of Trustees of the theatre asked Derby City Council to advance \u00a340,000 from their 2008 grant. It was refused. On 29 November, the Board of Trustees of the theatre announced that it was going into voluntary liquidation and that performances would immediately stop. \nNevertheless, the cast and crew of \"Treasure Island\" put on that evening's performance. \nAfter the curtain call, the cast were joined on stage by the staff, the theatre's chief executive and director of the show (Karen Hebden), and two former chairmen of the Playhouse board (Michael Hall, and Jonathan Powers). They addressed the audience and press and asked them to fight for the city's theatre and get the Playhouse open again. \nThe following day, the Board of Trustees announced that the company had been put into administration.\nThe administrators allowed the Playhouse to reopen on 7 December 2007 to finish its run of \"Treasure Island\". \nThe theatre was being operated by a skeleton of essential staff, initially working unpaid. A fund was set up to accept donations to keep the Playhouse going. It was now operating as a charitable trust and relied on ticket sales and donations alone. Tickets for a Spring/Summer 2008 season had already been on sale before the closure. They were put back on sale while an appeal was made to the Arts Council. The Arts Council refused the appeal in January 2008. The theatre closed after the last performance of \"Treasure Island\" on 2 February 2008.\nOn 30 July 2008, the creditors voted to accept a rescue package put together by the company's new board of trustees. \nThe theatre reopened on 13 September 2008 with \"The Killing of Sister George\". This ran until 18 October. \nIt was the company's last production. The theatre was then sold to the University of Derby. It reopened in October 2009 as the Derby Theatre.\nProductions.\nThe new Derby Playhouse opened with \"My Fair Lady\". \nThe first season also included \"Hamlet\" and Alan Bates in \"The Seagull\". \nMark Woolgar was Resident Director for the first five seasons. Plays by Shakespeare, Shaw, Ibsen, Ayckbourn, Orton and Coward were put on.\nIn 1980, Christopher Honer joined the Playhouse as Artistic Director. Over the next seven years, the Playhouse's productions included \"All My Sons\" with Miranda Richardson, \"Piaf\" with Caroline Quentin, \"The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui\" starring Ben Roberts. New plays included Rony Robinson's \"The Brewery Beano\" and Don Shaw's \"The Conspirator\".\nBox office successes included \"Funny Peculiar\", \"Having A Ball!\" and \"Blood Brothers\". During this time, the Derby Playhouse Studio, under the direction of John North, David Milne and Claire Grove, provided a year-round programme of productions. They also put on community tours and a Theatre in Education programme.\nIn 1987, Annie Castledine became Artistic Director. During the next three years, the Playhouse saw a completely different style of theatre. Plays included \"The Innocent Mistress\", \"The Children's Hour\" and \"The Dark at the Top of the Stairs\" and classic plays such as \"A Doll's House\" and \"Jane Eyre\". Other plays included \"Arsenic and Old Lace\", \"Gaslight\" and \"Noises Off\" alongside new work such as \"Sunday's Children\", \"The Queen of Spades\", \"Selling the Sizzle\" and \"Self Portrait\". There was a series of co-productions with the companies Shared Experience, Paines Plough and Temba. During this period, the theatre's productions became known for the strength of their on-stage visual imagery. The Playhouse was shortlisted for the Prudential Awards.\nIn the summer of 1990, Derbyshire County Council cut their entire arts budget. This took \u00a3130,000 of revenue grant from the Playhouse. \nThe City Council offered the theatre a small grant. This enabled the Playhouse to continue to operate. According to Lyn Gardner writing in \"The Guardian\", \"it was Castledine's head that was demanded by the council as the price of underwriting the theatre's deficit.\" Castledine left the Playhouse.\nFrom the summer of 1990 to Christmas 1991, Executive Director, David Edwards, was in charge of the programme. This ended with the Playhouse's production of \"Hobson's Choice\". This won the Theatrical Management Association's Regional Theatre Award for Best Overall Production.\nIn spring 1991, Mark Clements was appointed Artistic Director. His first season opened with a production of \"And A Nightingale Sang\". The production of John Godber's \"On The Piste\", was repeated later in the year, and again in 2001. Godber's work remained a popular part of the programme while Clements' was in charge. During the Clements period the programme included a variety of work, ranging from classics such as \"Death of a Salesman\", Aphra Behn's \"Lucky Chance\" and Shakespeare's \"Richard III\", to contemporary drama such as \"Our Boys\", \"The Rise and Fall of Little Voice\" and \"Children of a Lesser God\", and newly commissioned work such as \"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\", \"Passion Killers\" and \"Blood Money\". \nMusicals became an important part of the programme, including \"Grease\", \"Little Shop of Horrors\", \"Cabaret\" and \"Assassins\". The pantomimes written by Mark Clements and Michael Vivian drew in record numbers at Christmas time.\nIn 2002, Mark Clements and David Edwards left the company. Karen Hebden was appointed as chief executive and Stephen Edwards as Creative Producer. Over the following years the Playhouse gained a national reputation for its productions.\nThere were in-house productions of \"\", \"Into the Woods\", \"Company\" and \"Merrily We Roll Along\". \nThree of these productions featured Glenn Carter. One of these was a new music drama, \"Moon Landing\", in which he played Buzz Aldrin. It was written, composed and directed by Stephen Edwards. \"Moon Landing\" was nominated in the Best Musical Production category of the 2008 TMA Awards. \nAn original cast recording of the final performance was made. The company's last production before its permanent closure was \"The Killing of Sister George\" starring Jenny Eclair and directed by Cal McCrystal. Its run ended on 18 October 2008. The rest of the 2008 autumn season, including the Christmas production of \"Peter Pan\", was cancelled."}

Butler is best known as the bassist and primary lyricist of the heavy metal band Black Sabbath. He has also recorded and performed with Heaven &amp; Hell, GZR, and Ozzy Osbourne. He currently serves as bassist of Deadland Ritual.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nButler received the nickname \"Geezer\" when he was about eight years old. This was because he \"used to call everybody Geezer\" at school. \"It was just a slang term for a man.\" \nButler grew up in a working-class Irish Catholic family in Birmingham. Butler was one of seven children. The family were poor.\nAs a teenager, Butler was heavily influenced by the writing of Aleister Crowley. By his late teens, he had stopped attending Mass. He feels that everyone should sooner or later decide for themselves what to believe in. \"I was going to Mass every Sunday just to take a look at all the nice girls that were going there\". \nBlack Sabbath.\nIn autumn 1967, Butler formed his first band, Rare Breed. John \"Ozzy\" Osbourne joined as lead vocalist. Butler was dating a girl who lived near Tony Iommi. Iommi's earliest memories of Butler was of seeing him walking past his house every day to visit her. Iommi and Butler became acquainted when their bands played at a nearby nightclub. Butler and Osbourne joined guitarist Iommi and drummer Bill Ward in the band Polka Tulk. They renamed their new band Earth, but a band already existed with that name, so they were forced to change the name again. In early 1969, inspired by the Boris Karloff horror film of the same name, Butler suggested the name Black Sabbath.\nIn his pre-Sabbath days, inspired by John Lennon, Butler played rhythm guitar. When Sabbath was formed, Iommi made it clear that he did not want to play with another guitarist, so Butler moved to bass. According to Butler, \"I'd never played bass until I was on stage at the first gig that we played. Borrowed the bass guitar off one of my friends and it only had three strings on it.\" \nButler lists Jack Bruce of Cream as his biggest influence as a bassist. Iommi described Butler as being \"from another planet\" in the band's early days; he took LSD, wore Indian hippie dresses, and was very peaceful. At the time Black Sabbath was formed, Butler was studying to become an accountant, and this training resulted in him managing the band's finances in the early days.\nAfter Black Sabbath fired vocalist Ozzy Osbourne in 1979, Butler also briefly left the band to deal with the divorce from his first wife. The 1980 album \"Heaven and Hell\" was recorded with bassist Craig Gruber but Butler returned to the band at the last minute and re-recorded the bass parts prior to release. \nIn 1984, he left the band after touring in support of their 1983 album, \"Born Again\". He returned months later as the band attempted a comeback with vocalist David Donato. \nIn 1988, Butler joined the backing band of his former Sabbath bandmate, Osbourne, to take part in the \"No Rest for the Wicked\" World Tour. \nIn 1991, he rejoined Black Sabbath for the reunion of the \"Mob Rules\" line-up.\nIn 1994, he left again after the \"Cross Purposes\" tour.\nIn 1995 Butler again joined Osbourne's band to perform on the \"Ozzmosis\" album. After recording \"Ozzmosis\", he formed G/Z/R, issuing \"Plastic Planet\" the same year.\nIn 1997, he released his next solo album, \"Black Science,\". \nButler returned to Sabbath for the 1997 edition of Ozzfest. He has remained with the band since. \nIn 2005 he released \"Ohmwork\", his third solo album.\nIn October 2006 it was announced that Butler, along with Tony Iommi, would be reforming the \"Dehumanizer\"-era Black Sabbath line-up with Vinny Appice and Ronnie James Dio, under the name Heaven &amp; Hell to differentiate between the reunited touring band fronted by Osbourne, and the current Sabbath line-up. \nIn 2013, he recorded on the Black Sabbath album \"13\" and was on the supporting album tour.\nIn 2017, toured on the final Black Sabbath tour, The End Tour.\nPersonal life.\nButler is married to Gloria Butler, who managed Heaven &amp; Hell. He was divorced from his first wife in 1980. He also shares his Los Angeles home with several cats, of whom he has posted pictures on his website. His oldest son, Biff Butler, was the frontman in the nu metal band Apartment 26. Butler's younger son James has a degree in social sciences from Oxford University.\nButler is a lifelong supporter of Aston Villa Football Club. During Black Sabbath's induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Butler is heard shouting \"Up the Villa\" as the members of the band left the stage. He has referred to soccer as his \"religion\" and has stated that Villa legend Peter McParland is his \"all-time hero\".\nAccording to Osbourne, Butler \"never uses foul language\". He was raised on a vegetarian diet, largely due to his family being too poor to buy meat on a regular basis, and is now a vegan since about 1994. His mother was also a vegetarian.\nIn 2009, Butler appeared in a promotional ad for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. He later urged fans to boycott Fortnum &amp; Mason until they remove foie gras from their shelves. Butler said, \"I've seen some outrageous things in my time, but watching those poor birds suffer simply so that their diseased livers can be sold on your shop floor is horrific!\"\nOver the years, Butler has become disillusioned with politics, saying \"For me, it's almost pointless voting anymore because it seems to be the same no matter what party or politics you stand for. It all seems corrupted to me. It's all the same old people that rule the world.\" He has also expressed concern over the increasing level of control government has in people's lives. \"Every time I go back to England, there are things that totally surprise me that you never think would happen in England, just all the CCTV everywhere. There seems to be so much control over people these days\", he said in 2014.\nIn January 2015, Butler was briefly detained after a bar brawl in Death Valley, California and charged with misdemeanor assault, public intoxication and vandalism. He was released following detoxification and a citation. In 2016 he opened up about the event: \"This guy started mouthing off about something. He was, like, some drunken Nazi bloke. He [...] started going on about Jews and everything - Jews this, Jews that. My missus is Jewish and I'd just had enough, and me hand sort of met his chin. I whacked him one.\"\nStyle and legacy.\nButler is noted as being one of the first bassists to use a wah pedal and to down-tune his instrument (from the standard E-A-D-G to the lower C#-F#-B-E), as on Black Sabbath's \"Master of Reality\" album. This was to match Iommi who had started tuning his guitar to C# (a minor third down). During the band's Ozzy Osbourne era, Butler wrote almost all of the band's lyrics, drawing heavily upon his fascination with religion, science-fiction, fantasy and horror, and musings on the darker side of human nature that posed a constant threat of global annihilation.\nButler is regarded as one of the most influential bassists in heavy metal. Billy Sheehan of Mr. Big said: \"He\u2019s a founding father of a whole genre of music and a man who really set the bar early on to be such an integral part of the sound and song structure of Sabbath\". \nIn Mick Wall's biography of Iron Maiden entitled \"Run to the Hills\", founder Steve Harris recalls: \"I distinctly remember trying to play along to Black Sabbath's \"Paranoid\" \u2013 at first I just could not get it. I threw the guitar on my bed and walked out in a huff, but the next day I came back, picked it up and played it all the way through note-for-note! Once I got going, I started getting into bass-lines with a bit more subtlety to them...\".\nFormer Metallica bassist Jason Newsted, who defined him his \"number 1 influence\", stated: \"All true metal bassists look up to Geezer as a pioneer and Godfather of our chosen instrument. The best, ever\". \nRex Brown of Pantera and Kill Devil Hill asserted: \"He\u2019s a legend. He\u2019s everything. Geezer is so much of an influence on me. \nOther bassists such as Cliff Burton, \nLes Claypool, Steve DiGiorgio, \nAlex Webster, \nJohn Myung, \nJohnny Lee Middleton, \nGreg Smith cited Butler as a significant influence on their style.\nEquipment.\nButler currently endorses Lakland basses and has his own signature model. For amplification, Butler is endorsed by Hartke bass amplification, \"Kilo\" bass head and 4X10 HyDrive cabinet. In the past, he has been known to use Ampeg SVT &amp; B-15 bass amps and Fender, Dan Armstrong Plexi, Rickenbacker, Yamaha BB, Vigier and B.C. Rich Basses.\nAccording to the Geezer Butler Bass Rig Rundown, he used the following over the years.\nLakland basses.\nFrom early 2000's\nSignature Lakland basses.\nReleased in 2013"}

Currently, certain trains would still terminate at this station for the truncated service between Yishun station and Marina South Pier MRT station which only operates during morning peak hours on weekdays. Prior to 2 October 2019, short-working trips exist from Yishun to Marina South Pier in early evening periods and late night periods.\nYishun station is currently one of the two MRT stations that serve Yishun New Town; the other being Khatib MRT station. Together with Yishun Bus Interchange and Northpoint City, it also forms as an integrated transport hub - Yishun Integrated Transport Hub.\nHistory.\nIn December 2001, the Singapore embassies attack plot was discovered, and had included plans to bomb this station at several points, including the sewers near the station. This was brought up in a debate during a session of the parliament, during which new security measures were proposed, especially on the MRT system itself.\nOn 16 April 2003, power supply to trackside equipment between Yio Chu Kang and Sembawang stations was disrupted at 8.02 am due to a lightning strike which affected eight point machines along the track. \nOn the early morning of 5 December 2006, a foreign worker in his early twenties, was hit by a train that was travelling towards Marina Bay. Train service was disrupted for more than an hour. He was later declared dead.\nOn 19 January 2008 at about 1530 hours, a call was made from a public telephone at the MRT station stating that there was a bomb at the station. Police arrested a 31-year old Chinese man that was believed to be linked to the crime on 23 February 2008. He was later charged for transmitting a false message that makes reference to a bomb.\nAt 11.45 am on 11 October 2008, a man was found on the tracks of the station and was sent to hospital. Train service was disrupted in between Sembawang and Yio Chu Kang stations, affecting 2900 people."}

Hasta Mitra first published it in 1980. The story happens at the end of the Dutch colonial rule in Indonesia. Pramoedya wrote the novel in prison on Buru island in eastern Indonesia. Pramoedya told the story aloud to other prisoners in 1973 because he was not allowed to write. The story spread through all the prisoners until 1975. Then Pramoedya was finally allowed to write the full story.\nThe main character and narrator of \"This Earth of Mankind\" is a Javanese boy named Minke. He attends an elite Dutch school. Minke's life becomes dangerous when he falls in love with Annelies, the beautiful Indo daughter of Nyai Ontosoroh. In \"This Earth of Mankind\", Pramoedya showed the racism of the Dutch colony. \nThe Indonesian Attorney General banned \"This Earth of Mankind\" in 1981. Many copies of the first editions survived. In 2005 the publisher Lentera Depantara started to publish it again in Indonesia. It had already been published worldwide in 33 languages.\nPlot summary.\n\"This Earth of Mankind\" tells the story of Minke. He is a Javanese minor royal who studies at a Dutch \"Hogere Burger School\". At that time, usually only Europeans could study there. Minke is a talented young writer. His writing is published in several Dutch-language journals. They are popular. But many of Minke's classmates hate him because he is \"native\". His classmates are all at least partly European descent.\nMinke meets an unusual Indonesian woman, Nyai Ontosoroh. She is the concubine of a Dutch man called Herman Mellema. Minke falls in love with their daughter, Annelies. They marry in an Islamic wedding. But by Dutch law, they are not marriedbecause it was \"native\" and Annelies' Dutch guardians did not approve.\nIt was common for local women to become the concubines of Dutch men living in the East Indies. Their children were either illegitimate \"natives\" and lost legal rights. Or if their father accepted them as his children they were called \"Indos\". Then the mother lost all rights over their children. Nyai Ontosoro suffers because of her low status and lack of rights. But, she believes education is the way to show her basic humanity. She believes that learning is the way to oppose racism, stupidity, and poverty. However, deciding to make her children Herman Mellema's children causes terrible problems for them.\nPublished by ex-political prisoners.\nAfter release from detention in April 1980 Pramoedya and Hasjim Rachman met with Joesoef Isak. Rachman had been editor of the \"Eastern Star\". Isak used to be a journalist at the \"Merdeka\" newspaper. He had been in Salemba prison. They agreed to publish works by ex-political prisoners that other publishers would not.\nThey chose \"This Earth of Mankind\" (\"Bumi Manusia\") as the first book. Pramoedya began working hard on the papers that he had brought from the Buru island. Prison officials had taken most of his writing. At the same time, Hasjim and Joesoef talked to government officials, including the Vice-President, Adam Malik. They were positive about the plans.\nIn July 1980, the manuscript of \"This Earth of Mankind\" was sent to the Aga Press printers. 5,000 copies of \"This Earth of Mankind\" sold in 12 days. Soon other publishers in Hong Kong, Malaysia, the Netherlands, and Australia asked the publishers, Hasta Mitra, for permission to make translations. The Wira Karya publishing house in Malaysia paid royalties of as much as 12% direct to Pramoedya.\nBy November, Hasta Mitra had published its third edition, and had sold about 10,000 copies. The book was well-received critically. It was called \"the best work of literature of our times.\" The Armed Forces daily newspaper called it \"a new contribution to the treasury of Indonesian literature\".\nBanned.\nthe Attorney General of Indonesia banned \"This Earth of Mankind\" in 1981. He said it promoted Marxist-Leninist ideas and Communism. Neither are in the book.\nFirst, the Ampat Lima printing house were told to not print any books published by Hasta Mitra. The editors of major media were told that they were not allowed to review or praise \"This Earth of Mankind\" or any of Pramoedya's other writing.\nIn April 1981, some New Order youth groups criticized Pramoedya's writing. Mass media reported this as the people not liking Pramoedya's work. New Order media such as \"Suara Karya\", \"Pelita\" and \"Karya Dharma\" began publishing criticisms of \"This Earth of Mankind\" and its author.\nThe Association of Indonesian Publishers (IKAPI) had been planning an exhibition of books that year. They canceled Hasta Mitra's membership in the association. IKAPI had been enthusiastic about asking the publisher to become a member and be involved in its activities. Newspapers that used to support Pramoedya stopped publishing his writing. They also started rejecting writing by authors who supported Pramoedya.\nFinally, on 29 May 1981, the Attorney General published regulation SK-052/JA/5/1981 about the banning of \"This Earth of Mankind\" and its sequel \"Child of All Nations (Anak Semua Bangsa)\". The regulation mentioned a letter from Suharto.\nThe Attorney General's office took all copies of \"This Earth of Mankind\" and \"Child of All Nations\" tried to take all copies of the books from all book shops. However, by August 1981, they only took 972 copies of the books although about 20,000 copies had been printed.\nThe translator of \"This Earth of Mankind\" into English, Maxwell Lane, was a staff member of the Australian Embassy in Jakarta. The Australian Government recalled him in September 1981. The Ampat Lima printing company closed because of pressure from the Attorney General's office and the Interior Ministry.\nAdaptation.\n\"This Earth of Mankind\" was made into an Indonesian language movie. Production started in 2006. Armantono wrote the script.\nThe moviewas shown in Indonesian movie theaters in August 2019."}

The flood depositedfertile soil on the river's banks, allowing the Egyptians to grow crops. Hapi was greatly celebrated among the Egyptians. Some of the titles of Hapi were \"Lord of the Fish and Birds of the Marshes\" and \"Lord of the River Bringing Vegetation\". Hapi is typically depicted as an androgynous figure with a big belly and large drooping breasts, wearing a loincloth and ceremonial false beard.\nMythology.\nThe annual flooding of the Nile occasionally was said to be the \"Arrival of Hapi\". Since this flooding provided fertile soil in an area that was otherwise desert, Hapi symbolised fertility. He had large female breasts because he was said to bring a rich and nourishing harvest. Due to his fertile nature he was sometimes considered the \"father of the gods\", and was considered to be a caring father who helped to maintain the balance of the cosmos, the world or universe regarded as an orderly, harmonious system. He was thought to live within a cavern at the supposed source of the Nile near Aswan. The cult of Hapi was mainly located at the First Cataract named Elephantine. His priests were involved in rituals to ensure the steady levels of flow required from the annual flood. At Elephantine the official nilometer, a measuring device, was carefully monitored to predict the level of the flood, and his priests must have been intimately concerned with its monitoring.\nHapi was not regarded as the god of the Nile itself but of the flooding event. He was also considered a \"friend of Geb\" the Egyptian god of the earth, and the \"lord of Neper\", the god of grain.\nIconography.\nAlthough male and wearing the false beard, Hapi was pictured with pendulous breasts and a large stomach, as representations of the fertility of the Nile. He also was usually given blue or green skin, representing water. Other attributes varied, depending upon the region of Egypt in which the depictions exist. In Lower Egypt, he was adorned with papyrus plants and attended by frogs, present in the region, and symbols of it. Whereas in Upper Egypt, it was the lotus and crocodiles which were more present in the Nile, thus these were the symbols of the region, and those associated with Hapi there. Hapi often was pictured carrying offerings of food or pouring water from an amphora, but also, very rarely, was depicted as a hippopotamus. During the Nineteenth Dynasty Hapi is often depicted as a pair of figures, each holding and tying together the long stem of two plants representing Upper and Lower Egypt, symbolically binding the two halves of the country around a hieroglyph meaning \"union\". This symbolic representation was often carved at the base of seated statues of the pharaoh.\nEgyptian historian Al Maqrizi (1364\u20131442) related in his \"El Khutat El Maqrizia (The Maqrizian Plans) that living virgins were sacrificed annually as \"brides of the Nile\" (\"Arous El Nil\") and this has been historically accepted as late as the 1970s. but this claim is disputed by some Egyptologists such as Bassam El Shammaa.\nReferences.\nWorks cited"}

This flood carried rich sediments, which made the soil fertile. Egypt is located in the desert, and agriculture is only possible close to the Nile. A rainy season in Ethiopia starts the flooding, which used to occur between May and August. During this time, the Blue Nile has five times as much water as the White Nile. During the rest of the year, the White Nile has almost twice as much water than the Blue Nile. This event was visible in Aswan, starting in June, and reaching its peak in August.

They are thermophile Archaea that live in very hot places underground. People have found them in sand at the bottom of the ocean, deep mines, hot springs, and other places underground.\nName.\nHadesarchaea were first called the South-African Gold Mine Miscellaneous Euryarchaeal Group (SAGMEG) because they were found in a gold mine in South Africa. They were renamed \"Hadesarchaea\" in 2016 (Hades was the Greek god who ruled the land of the dead).\nGenome.\nIn 2016, scientists used a method called shotgun sequencing to make a model of the Hadesarchaea genome. A genome is all the genes in an living thing and the other pieces of DNA and RNA that help them work. The Hadesarchaea genome is about 1.5 Megabase pairs in size, which is about 0.5 Mbp smaller than most other Archaea. The scientists think the small genome is how the Hadesarchaea can stay alive with only a little to eat.\nScientists believe Hadesarchaea came from an ancestor that used methane as food.\nEcology.\nThe first Hadesarchaea that people found were in a mine in South Africa about 3\u00a0km (2\u00a0mi) under the surface of the Earth. They do not need oxygen or light to live. They were later also found in the White Oak River estuary in North Carolina, a place where a river meets the ocean, and in Yellowstone National Park's Lower Culex Basin. These areas are hot, 70\u00a0\u00b0C (158\u00a0\u00b0F), and are so alkaline that they would destroy most living things. Other scientists looked through the soil near old mines in East Harz, Germany and think they may have found pieces of 16S rRNA that could be from Hadesarchaea or their close relatives.\nHadesarchaea are the only archaea that can turn carbon monoxide and water into carbon dioxide and oxygen. When they do this, the reaction gives off hydrogen. Scientists looked at more information about the Hadesarchaea genome and believe they have genes that let them put carbon atoms into other molecules and make methane. Other scientists think Hadesarchaea may be able to use sugar and amino acids as fuel and change nitrite into ammonium. Scientists think Hadesarchaea help in geochemical processes."}
