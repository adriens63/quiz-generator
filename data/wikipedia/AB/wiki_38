The end result of doxing is a dox. Doxes are often shared to incite harassment, intimidation, and/or violent acts toward their victims. It can be used to help police or to assist criminals. Typically, a person is doxed for revenge-based reasons, motivating the person who is wronged or who has perceived a wrong to humiliate and expose their target. Doxing is legal in all 50 U.S. states, only if the information is gathered from public websites, is public knowledge and does not contain private information such as SSNs or cell phone numbers. \nDoxing was originally started, back in the 1980s to 1990s, by black-hat hackers and penetration testers of the time to silence and/or intimate their hacker rivals in the BBS and internet communities. Doxing is a form of vigilantism and many instances of doxing have led to swatting, years of harassment, people having to move out of their homes and change their phone numbers. Being doxed will also make you more vulnerable to identity theft. In the present day, specifically in the United States, doxing is used as a method of political dissent and political attack, primarily by left-leaning people against those with Conservative leanings. Doxing as well as deplatforming have become an integral part of \"Cancel Culture.\""}

For example, the 'ch' sound in English (written as /t\u0361\u0283/ in IPA) is said with an 't' (/t/) sound with an 'sh' (/\u0283/) sound immediately afterwards. Both voiced and voiceless affricates exist; in English, they are /d\u0361\u0292/ (the 'j' sound) and t\u0361\u0283 (the 'ch' sound) respectively. \nIn Mandarin Chinese, affricates are told apart by aspiration, or breathiness, since voiced affricates do not exist; aspirated affricates, or breathy affricates, are /t\u0361\u0255\u02b0/ (written as 'q' in Hanyu Pinyin), /t\u0361s\u02b0/ ('c'), and /\u0288\u0361\u0282\u02b0/ ('ch'), and unaspirated affricates, or non-breathy affricates, are /t\u0361\u0255/ ('j'), /t\u0361s/ ('z'), and /\u0288\u0361\u0282/ ('zh')."}
{"id": "655699", "revid": "495413", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=655699", "title": "Aspiration", "text": "Aspiration is a feature in languages where saying a consonant gives out a puff of air. For example, if you dangle a piece of paper in front of your mouth, you will see it move if you say an aspirated, or breathy, consonant. If the paper does not move, then it is unaspirated, or not breathy. In English, voiceless stops and fricatives that happen at the beginning of a word are aspirated, which are the sounds 'p', 't', 'k', and 'ch' (which are written as /p/, /t/, /k/, /t\u0361\u0283/ in IPA in the same order). In IPA, aspirated sounds can be written with an \u02b0 symbol afterwards, as in /p\u02b0/, /t\u02b0/, /k\u02b0/, and /t\u0361\u0283\u02b0/. For example, the first sound in the words \"pick\", \"tick\", \"kick\", and \"chick\" are all aspirated. In IPA, they are written as /p\u02b0\u026ak/, /t\u02b0\u026ak/, /k\u02b0\u026ak/, and /t\u0361\u0283\u02b0\u026ak/ in the same order. However, voiceless stops and fricatives that appear after the first sound are unaspirated. For example, while the /p/ in \"pit\" is aspirated, the /p/ in \"spit\" and the /p/ in \"tip\" are not, so they would not be marked with an \u02b0 symbol afterwards. Below are more examples of aspiration.\nEnglish has no aspirated voiced sounds, but Hindi does. They are normally written with an 'h' after the consonant letter. An example of this is the name Bhattacharya, in which 'bh' is an aspirated 'b' sound, so it would be written as /b\u02b1/ in IPA.\nIn Mandarin Chinese, there are no voiced stops, fricatives, or affricates, so the only way to tell them apart is by aspiration. In Pinyin, aspirated sounds are written like voiceless sounds in English, so the sounds /p\u02b0/, /t\u02b0/, and /k\u02b0/ are written as 'p', 't', and 'k' in the same order, but unaspirated sounds are written like voiced sounds in English, so the sounds /p/, /t/, and /k/ are written as 'b', 'd', and 'g' respectively. For example, the word \"Gaokao\" would be written in IPA as /kau\u032f.k\u02b0au\u032f/. In Wade-Giles spelling, aspirated stops, fricatives, or affricates are written with an apostrophe after the letter instead of using a different letter like in Pinyin, so \"Gaokao\" would be written as \"Kaok'ao\" in Wade-Giles."}

All high school students in China must take the Gaokao in their last year of school, and much of their time in high school is spent preparing to take the exam. Like many other Asian countries, such as Japan, South Korea, and India, the Gaokao has been well-known internationally for being a very difficult exam because many students do not get a high enough score to attend university in China.\nThe required subjects are mathematics, Chinese and English, and the full score of each three subjects is 150 points. For the remaining subjects, there are two choices: the liberal arts comprehensive are history, geography and politics, with a score of 100 for each subject; The science subjects include physics, chemistry and biology, with 100 points for each subject. Students are allowed to choose between science and liberal arts based on their level of study, and each student scored a maximum of 750. Although two kinds of choice means brought the power that examinee learns, but in China, the obtain employment of liberal arts living is more difficult than science living, the score of the university entrance exam also is lower than science living, so the examinee that chooses science department is much more than the examinee that chooses liberal arts.\nIn the national college entrance examination in June 2018, 9.75 million people took the exam, which shows the great pressure of competition. It is a pity that many people are ruined on their way to university just because of one failure in the exam. One of the disadvantages of Chinese education is that it only takes one exam to select talents. However, because there are too many references, the nation can only select talents through examinations. Facts have proved that this selection method still has some merits."}

Its states that the growth of a plant is limited by the resource, which is most scarce, and nor by the total amount of resources available. The law has also been used to predict the growth of populations.\nWassily Leontief (1905-1999) formulated a similar rule for economics: It is known as Leontief production function today.\nLiebig's barrel.\nDobenecks used the image of a barrel \u2014 often called \"Liebig's barrel\" \u2014 to explain Liebig's law. In a barrel, with staves of unequal length, the capacity of the barrel is determined by the shortest stave. This is also true for the growth of a plant: it is limited by the nutrient in shortest supply.\nIf a system satisfies the law of the minimum then adaptation will equalize the load of different factors because the adaptation resource will be allocated for compensation of limitation. Adaptation systems act as the cooper of Liebig's barrel and lengthens the shortest stave to improve barrel capacity. Indeed, in well-adapted systems the limiting factor should be compensated as far as possible. This observation follows the concept of resource competition and fitness maximization.\nDue to the law of the minimum paradoxes, if we observe the Law of the Minimum in artificial systems, then under natural conditions adaptation will equalize the load of different factors and we can expect a violation of the law of the minimum. Inversely, if artificial systems demonstrate significant violation of the law of the minimum, then we can expect that under natural conditions adaptation will compensate this violation. In a limited system life will adjust as an evolution of what came before."}

Oganesson has the highest atomic number and highest atomic mass of all known elements. The radioactive oganesson atom is very unstable, and since 2005, only five (possibly six) atoms of the isotope oganesson-294 have been created.\nHistory.\nThe element is named in honor of Yuri Oganessian. It was first created in 2002 at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, Russia by a joint team of Russian and American scientists. In December 2015, it was recognized as one of four new elements by the Joint Working Party of the international scientific people at IUPAC and IUPAP. It was formally named on 28 November 2016. It had a previous name given by the IUPAC called \"Ununoctium\" meaning \"one-one-eight\" in Latin. This was a placeholder name until the element was discovered and a name was given. The possibility of a seventh noble gas, after helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon, was considered almost as soon as the noble gas group was discovered. Danish chemist Hans Peter J\u00f8rgen Julius Thomsen predicted in April 1895, the year after the discovery of argon, that there was a whole group of chemically unreactive gases similar to argon that would link the halogen and alkali metal groups. He expected that the seventh of this series would end a 32-element period which contained elements like thorium and uranium and have an atomic weight of 292, close to the 294 now known for the first and only confirmed isotope of oganesson.\nChemistry.\nThe chemistry of Oganesson can not be found because of how radioactive it is and how short its half-life is, which is only 0.69 milliseconds. However, predictions can be made based on properties the group has in common with each other. Since its a noble gas, it is predited that its going to be a diatomic molecule (it only pairs with itself).\nUses.\nIt currently has no use because of how radioactive and short its half life is."}

They are mostly in the Western United States, but also partly in the Midwest states of Nebraska, Kansas, and South Dakota.\nGeologically, the high plains are caused by the same process as caused the Rockies. The cause is the westward movement of North America away from Eurasia, which has been going on for over 100 million years. As the continent moved west, it subducted plates under the western side, and stretched out its eastern side. This explains why the western states all have some mountainous terrain, and the eastern states in the south are so low-lying.\nFrom east to west, the High Plains rise in elevation from around to over . The High Plains has a \"cold semi-arid\" climate\u2014K\u00f6ppen \"BSk\"\u2014they get between of precipitation annually.\nDue to low moisture and high elevation, the High Plains get extremes of temperature.

It became Tropical Storm Florence on September 1, 2018.\nThe storm strengthened to a major hurricane on September 5, and then strengthened to a Category 4 hurricane with estimated maximum sustained winds of 130 mph later that day.\nThe state Governors of North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia declared a state of emergency for each state. It was becoming evident that the hurricane might strike South or North Carolina as a major hurricane.\nFlorence later weakened to a strong tropical storm. However, the storm later strengthened back to a hurricane. This time, it strengthened to 140 miles per hour, stronger than it was before.\nOn September 10, 2018, mandatory evacuations were issued in certain parts of North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia.\nOn September 11, 2018, tropical cyclone watches were posted for the North and South Carolina coastlines.\nThe storm made a slow landfall (7 km/h) on September 14 as a Category 1 hurricane. It had heavy rain. It took energy and water from the warm Gulf Stream near the coast for one day. When the storm was inland, it weakened to a tropical depression.\nFlorence had a wind speed of 140 mph and a central pressure of 939 millibars, but from post-analysis it had a wind speed of 150 mph.\nDamage from Florence was estimated at $24 billion (2018 USD). There were 53 deaths from Florence.\nRetirement.\nOn March 20, 2019, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name \"Florence\" due to severe and very expensive damage it caused along its track, particularly in the Carolinas, and it will never again be used for another Atlantic hurricane.

It has been domesticated at least since 1360 BC. The genus name is from \"anser\", the Latin for \"goose\".\nGreylag geese travel to their northerly breeding grounds in spring, nesting on moorlands, in marshes, around lakes and on coastal islands. They normally mate for life and nest on the ground among vegetation. A clutch of three to five eggs is laid. The female incubates the eggs and both parents defend and rear the young. The birds stay together as a family group, migrating southwards in autumn as part of a flock, and separating the following year. During the winter they occupy semi-aquatic habitats, estuaries, marshes and flooded fields, feeding on grass and agricultural crops. Some populations, such as those in Southern England and in urban areas, are resident and occupy the same area year-round."}

He is the first son of Eugene Thomas Long, Jr. and Emily Barker Long. He is a graduate of Randolph-Macon College in Virginia (BA), Duke University (BD) and the University of Glasgow, Scotland (Ph.D). He was a student of John Macquarrie and Ronald Gregor Smith.\nHe was a Professor of Philosophy at Randolph Macon College between 1964 and 1970. He was a Professor of Philosophy at the University of South Carolina between 1970 and 2002. During that time he was Chair of the Department of Philosophy (1972-1987). He retired in 2002 as Distinguished Professor of Philosophy Emeritus.\nHe was elected President of The Metaphysical Society of America and President of the Society for Philosophy of Religion. He served as Editor-in-Chief of the International Journal for Philosophy of Religion (1990-2010) and the Handbook of Contemporary Philosophy of Religion.\nThe major focus of Long\u2019s work is the dialogue between philosophy and theology and he is often characterized both as a philosophical theologian and philosopher of religion. Attracted in his early days to the work of Hegel and British and American Idealism, he is influenced in particular by the work of Karl Jaspers, Martin Heidegger, Paul Tillich and John Macquarrie. Appealing to the theories of experience in the tradition of so-called radical empiricism, Long argues for transcendent dimensions of general human experience to bridge the gap between specifically religious and ordinary experience. \nLong died on March 13, 2020 at the age of 84."}

Animals which have grinding teeth do not need a gizzard, but there are many animals which do have one.\nGizzards are standard equipment for pterosaurs and birds, dinosaurs, and crocodilia, also many fish, and crustacea. \nGizzards work because the animal eats some gravel and small stones, and they grind against the food in the gizzard. Gizzards are muscular, and lined with tough material.\nIn birds, it works like this. Birds swallow food and store it in their crop if necessary. Then the food passes into their glandular stomach, or proventriculus. Secretions are added here to the food. Then the food passes into the gizzard (also known as the \"muscular stomach\" or \"ventriculus\"). The gizzard can grind the food with previously swallowed stones and pass it back to the true stomach, and vice versa. In layman's terms, the gizzard 'chews' the food for the bird as it does not have teeth. Bird gizzards are lined with a tough layer made of the carbohydrate-protein complex \"koilin\", to protect the muscles in the gizzard.\nIn birds the stomach is before the gizzard, but in grasshoppers the gizzard comes before the stomach. In earthworms there is only a gizzard, and no stomach."}

He held the Gibbs Professorship of Theoretical Chemistry at Yale University. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1968.\nEducation and early life.\nLars Onsager was born in Kristiania (now Oslo), Norway. His father was a lawyer. After completing secondary school in Oslo, he attended the Norwegian Institute of Technology (NTH) in Trondheim, graduating as a chemical engineer in 1925.\nCareer and research.\nIn 1925 he discovered that the\u00a0Debye-H\u00fcckel theory of electrolytic solutions\u00a0was wrong. This theory explained\u00a0Brownian movement of ions in solution. In 1926 he published a correction to the theory.\u00a0He traveled to Z\u00fcrich, where Peter Debye was teaching, and told him his theory was wrong. Debye was so impressed by Onsager's work that he asked him to become his assistant. Onsager stayed at the Eidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule (ETH)\u00a0until 1928.\nJohns Hopkins University.\nIn 1928 Onsager went to the United States to teach at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. He was a genius in developing theories, he was not a very good chemistry teacher, and he was dismissed after one semester.\nBrown University.\nHis next job was teaching\u00a0statistical mechanics at\u00a0Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. Again he was found to be no good at teaching. He did make significant contributions to statistical mechanics and thermodynamics. The only student who could really understand his lectures on electrolyte systems was Raymond Fuoss. Fuoss eventually joined him at Yale University. \nIn 1933, during the\u00a0Great Depression\u00a0Brown's decided they could not afford to employ someone who could not teach and he was dismissed. .\nHis research at Brown was on the effects on diffusion of temperature gradients. He came up with\u00a0a set of equations\u00a0 in 1929 now called\u00a0Onsager reciprocal relations. The importance of these equations\u00a0in statistical mechanics was not realized for many years. However by 1968 they were considered important for Onsager to win the\u00a0Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In 1933, after leaving Browns, Onsager traveled to Austria to visit electrochemist Hans Falkenhagen. He met Falkenhagen's sister-in-law, Margrethe Arledter. They were married on September 7, 1933, and had three sons and a daughter.\nYale University.\nHis next job was at Yale University, where he remained for most of the rest of his life, retiring in 1972. At Yale, it was discovered that he had never received a Ph.D.\u00a0The\u00a0Norwegian Institute of Technology\u00a0found that his his work in reciprocal relations was too incomplete to qualify as a doctoral dissertation. Yale said they would accept one of his published papers instead, but Onsager insisted on doing a new research project.\u00a0His dissertation, called \"Solutions of the Mathieu equation of period 4 pi and certain related functions\", was too hard for the\u00a0chemistry and physics faculty to understand. It was only after the\u00a0mathematics department said they\u00a0would give him the doctorate instead, that he was granted a Ph.D. in chemistry in 1935. He was appointed assistant professor in 1934, and associate professor in 1940. At Yale he produced brilliant theoretical research, but could not teach or explain ideas to students.\u00a0He was also unable to direct the research of graduate students, except for the occasional outstanding one.\nDuring the late 1930s, Onsager researched the dipole theory of dielectrics. He again improved on earlier work by Peter Debye. However, when he gave his paper to a journal that Debye edited in 1936, it was rejected. Debye would not accept Onsager's ideas until after World War II. During the 1940s, Onsager studied the statistical-mechanical theory of phase transitions in solids. He came up with a mathematical theory\u00a0which was enthusiastically received. In a tour de force of mathematical physics, he obtained the exact solution for the two dimensional Ising model in zero field in 1944.\nIn 1935 he was awarded an honorary degree\u00a0from the Norwegian Institute of Technology, later part of Norwegian University of Science and Technology.\nIn 1945, Onsager was naturalized as an American citizen. He\u00a0 was awarded the title of \"J. Willard Gibbs Professor of Theoretical Chemistry\". Willard Gibbs\u00a0worked on using\u00a0mathematics to solve problems in physics and chemistry. Onsager\u00a0continuing in the same areas Gibbs had pioneered.\nIn 1947, Onsager was elected to the National Academy of Sciences, and in 1950 he joined the ranks of Alpha Chi Sigma.\nAfter World War II, Onsager researched new topics of interest. He came up with a theoretical explanation of the superfluid properties of liquid helium in 1949. Two years later the physicist Richard Feynman independently proposed the same theory. He also worked on the theories of liquid crystals and the electrical properties of ice. While on a Fulbright scholarship to the University of Cambridge, he worked on the magnetic properties of metals. He developed important ideas on the quantization of magnetic flux in metals. He was awarded the Lorentz Medal in 1958, Willard Gibbs Award in 1962, and the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1968. He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1975.\nAfter Yale.\nIn 1972 Onsager retired from Yale.\u00a0He became a member of the Center for Theoretical Studies, University of Miami, and was appointed Distinguished University Professor of Physics. At the University of Miami he guided and inspired postdoctoral students as his teaching skills had improved.\u00a0He developed interests in semiconductor physics, biophysics and radiation chemistry. However, his death came before he could produce any breakthroughs comparable to those of his earlier years.\nPersonal life.\nHe died from an aneurysm while living in Coral Gables, Florida in 1976. Onsager was buried next to John Gamble Kirkwood at New Haven's Grove Street Cemetery.\u00a0Onsager's tombstone simply said \"Nobel Laureate\". When Onsager's wife Gretel died in 1991 and was buried there, his children added an asterisk after \"Nobel Laureate,\" and \"*etc.\" in the lower right corner of the stone.\nLegacy.\nThe Norwegian Institute of Technology established the Lars Onsager Lecture and The Lars Onsager Professorship in 1993 to award outstanding scientists in the scientific fields of\u00a0 Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics. In 1997 his sons and daughter donated his scientific works and professional belongings to NTNU (before 1996 NTH) in Trondheim, Norway as his Alma Mater. These are now organized as \"The Lars Onsager Archive\" at the Gunnerus Library in Trondheim.\nThe Lars Onsager Prize is a prize in theoretical statistical physics. It is awarded annually by the American Physical Society. It was established in 1993 by Drs. Russell and Marian Donnelly."}

His series work in 1970s-2000s about semi metal and topologically protected spinor/femionic excitations in topological defects and boundary are paid enormous amount attentions in recent decade years because the discoveries about the topological solid state materials and potentially technical application on quantum computation. He also contributes a lot on emergent quantum field theory and gravity theory, one idea is phenomenological Q theory of cosmological constant problem.\nLife.\nVolovik completed his master's degree at the Physico-Technical Institute in Moscow. In 1973 he went to the\u00a0Landau Institute in Moscow, becoming Senior scientist in 1992. He completed his PhD in 1973 with\u00a0a thesis called the\u00a0\"Dynamics of a particle strongly interacting with a Bose System. In\u00a0\"1981, his habilitation (Russian doctor degree) was on\u00a0\"the Topology of defects in condensed matter\". In 1993, he was made Professor at the laboratory for low temperature physics of the Technical University of Helsinki (today's Aalto University), but still worked at the Landau Institute.\nIn 1992, he received the Landau prize of the Russian Academy of Sciences. In 2004, he received the Simon Memorial Award in low-temperature physics for his \"fundamental research on the role of symmetry in low-temperature physics, and applications in Cosmology, quantum gravity, quantum field theory and particle physics\" (Eulogy). from 2003 to 2006 he was the leader of the European science Foundation, \"Cosmology in the Laboratory\". Volovik is the author of several books and of more than 340 scientific journal publications.\nIn 2001, he became a member of the Finnish Academy of Sciences and in 2007, the Academy of Sciences Leopoldina. In 2014, he was awarded the Lars Onsager prize.\nResearches in Physics.\nOne of his contributions in middle of 1970s together with colleges was independently clarify the relationship between topology (Homotopy) of order parameter manifold and defects. Together with few work about topological property of instanton in high energy physics during that time, those work are enter in textbook nowaday. In 1996, the Chiral anomaly originating from the Fermi/Weyl point in superfluid helium-3 has been observed. After almost twenty years, same phenomena has been observed in solid material experiment.\nIn 1999, he firstly claimed that the existence of [[Majorana]] fermion zero mode located in the core of vertex in spinless superconductors.\nReferences.\n[[Category:1946 births]]\n[[Category:Theoretical physicists]]\n[[Category:Russian physicists]]\n[[Category:Living people]]"}

It has programs in education, science outreach (specifically Physics Outreach), and media relations. APS has about 50,000 members. In 1999, APS Physics celebrated 100 years with the biggest-ever physics meeting in Atlanta. In 2005, APS took the lead role in United States participation in the World Year of Physics.

This directive will be expected to take place in January 2019. If this directive passes, each country of the EU will be required to create laws that support this new directive.\nThe European Council described their key goals as ways to reduce the amount of conflict related to copyright violation. One of their goals is to reduce the \"value gap\" between the profits made by internet platforms and content creators, which involves requiring financial agreement before they can use their content. Another one of their goals is to encourage \"collaboration\" between companies and people who use their products. The other goal they proposed is creating copyright exceptions for text and data mining (the use of high quality words to describe specific copyrighted content).\nThe directive aims to give online press publishers more freedom to protect their content from news aggregators (Article 11), as well as requiring websites who primarily host content posted by users to warn users very harshly against posting unauthorized copyrighted content (Article 13).\nArticles 11 and 13 have attracted widespread criticism from many people and companies in Europe and North America. Article 11 has been criticised as a \"link tax\" which would require websites to obtain a license before linking to and previewing (using html snippets) news stories, and Article 13 as a \"meme ban\", because current content-filtering technology cannot distinguish copyright violation from fair dealing such as parody, and may counteract the panorama freedom. Supporters of the directive, mostly from large companies that support copyright, ignore these claims and think that it is disinformation. People from large companies that support this new directive try to claim that the opposers are trying to make the information seem worse than it actually is.\nHistory.\nProgress of the directive.\nThe first draft of the proposed directive was created on 14 September 2016, After many changes to the original draft, the Council of the European Union's Committee of Permanent Representatives (The EU's political leaders, abbreviated to COREPER) approved of the new changes on 25 May 2018. Afterwards, they prepared to vote for what would be the final draft of this new directive, but without the support of Germany, Finland, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Belgium, or Hungary. The European Parliament Committee on Legal Affairs had finished off making the final draft of the directive on 20 June 2018. They then discussed in parliament whether the directive will be approved to be added as a new law or not.\nOn 5 July 2018, this was not approved. Instead, the EU parliament decided to change the date of discussing about the directive on September 2018. There were 318 votes that approved re-opening the debate on a later date, 278 votes that approve the directive immediately, and 31 votes that oppose the directive.\nOn 12 September 2018, the parliament approved the directive. The final votes for the updated directive is 438 in favour and 226 against. The European Commission, the Council of the European Union, and the European Parliament will now discuss any other details relating to the directive before they release it to the EU. It is expected they will reach a solution in early 2019. If all of these three groups agree, then the directive will be sent to all of the EU. When this happens, each country of the EU will change their existing laws to include information related to this directive.\nRomania noticed that the EU was proposing to do meetings about Article 11 and Article 13 on 19 January 2019. Romania cancelled these meetings because Romania's proposal for the directive used wrong wording to describe how the directive will be run. There were 11 countries currently in the EU that did not like Romania's wording to describe Article 11 and 13: Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Finland, Slovenia, Italy, Poland, Sweden, Croatia, Luxembourg, and Portugal. With the exclusion of Portugal and Croatia, the other nine countries that opposed Romania believed that Romania's wording did not cover enough information regarding protecting the EU's citizens' copyright protections. Romania will have an opportunity to improve their wording for Article 11 and 13 to gain a majority vote, but this has caused the final vote for the directive from May 2019.\nContent.\nArticle 3.\nArticle 3 proposes a copyright exception for text and data mining (the use of high-quality words to describe a copyrighted subject, commonly abbreviated as TDM for short) for the purposes of scientific research.\nDepending on whether this article (a specific rule of a directive) understands what is considered in the public domain, TDM will potentially increase or decrease copyright restrictions compared to if this article is not approved.\nArticle 4.\nArticle 4 proposes that all educational establishments (schools, universities, etc.) are able to use copyrighted content for illustrative purposes only. Once this article has been approved, this article will clarify that educational establishments can make non-commercial use of copyrighted works for illustrative purposes.\nArticle 11.\nArticle 11 is a section of this proposed directive that will restrict access to linking to other websites. Companies who try to link to other news without permission will be punished.\nArticle 12a.\nArticle 12a proposes that sport event organizers have full copyright over recordings of their events.\nArticle 13.\nArticle 13 is a section of this proposed directive that will aim to censor any unauthorized copyrighted content. They will make it compulsory for all companies that post primarily user-generated content to do this.\nIt is very controversial. People think that it will make it very difficult to share new content on the internet. People also think it will make it confusing for filters to distinguish fair use and copyright violation. People who love memes, tend to call it the \"meme ban\". They also make memes about the EU in retaliation.\nCriticism.\nLots of people think Article 11 and Article 13 are bad. They think they are going to make the internet very restricted. They also think free internet content will become very difficult to find or create.\nOn November 2018, Google also threatened to shut down YouTube for the EU if the directive passes unless adjustments are made to the directive."}

Lister successfully introduced carbolic acid (phenol) to sterilise surgical instruments and to clean wounds.\nApplying Louis Pasteur's advances in microbiology, Lister championed the use of carbolic acid as an antiseptic, so that it became the first widely used antiseptic in surgery. \nHe knew it was used to ease the stench from fields irrigated with sewage waste. He thought it was safe because fields treated with carbolic acid had no ill-effects on the livestock that grazed on them.\nLister's work led to a reduction in post-operative infections (infections after an operation). This made surgery safer for patients. So he became known as the \"father of modern surgery\"."}

He was born in Belfast in 1824. At the University of Glasgow he did important work in the mathematical analysis of electricity and formed the first and second laws of thermodynamics. \nKelvin did much to unify physics in its modern form. He also had a career as an electric telegraph engineer and inventor, which propelled him into the public eye and gave him wealth, fame and honour. \nFor his work on the transatlantic telegraph project he was knighted in 1866 by Queen Victoria, becoming Sir William Thomson. He was noted for his work on the mariner's compass. This had been rather unreliable owing to the iron in ships' hulls.\nAbsolute temperatures are stated in units of kelvin in his honour. The existence of a lower limit to temperature (absolute zero) was known before his work, but Lord Kelvin found its correct value as approximately \u2212273.15 degree Celsius or \u2212459.67 degree Fahrenheit.\nHe was made Lord Kelvin in 1892 in recognition of his achievements in thermodynamics, and of his opposition to Irish Home Rule. He became Baron Kelvin, of Largs in the County of Ayr. \nHe was the first British scientist to be elevated to the House of Lords. His title refers to the River Kelvin, which flows close by his laboratory at the University of Glasgow. Despite offers from several world-renowned universities, Lord Kelvin refused to leave Glasgow, remaining Professor of Natural Philosophy for over 50 years, until his eventual retirement. The Hunterian Museum at the University of Glasgow has a permanent exhibition on the work of Lord Kelvin.\nAlways active in industrial research and development, he was recruited around 1899 by George Eastman to serve as vice-chairman of the board of the British company Kodak Limited, affiliated with Eastman Kodak."}

He was born in Zanesville, Ohio. \nFrom 1966 to 1967 Abel wrote a weekly syndicated humor column \"The Private World of Prof. Bunker C. Hill\" that appeared in the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" and several other newspapers. Following the Watergate scandal, Abel hired an actor to pose as Deep Throat for a press conference in New York City before 150 reporters.\nIn 1959, Abel started his most elaborate hoax. He appeared on a national TV show as a representative of the \"Society for Indecency to Naked Animals\" (SINA). SINA's mission was to put clothes on naked animals. Their slogan was: \"A nude horse is a rude horse\". An actor appeared on television and radio several times, including the CBS Evening News on August 21, 1962. The hoax began as a satire of media censorship, but soon people started sending financial contributions to the organization. (The organization returned the money.) Other people started making official citizen complaints against people for walking naked dogs. Some people started selling clothes for the naked animals.\nOther hoaxes.\nIn 1979, Abel staged his own death from a heart attack near a famous ski resort. A fake funeral director collected his belongings and a woman posing as his widow notified The New York Times. The Times published an obituary January 2, 1980. On January 3, 1980, Abel held a news conference to announce that the \"reports of my demise have been grossly exaggerated.\"\nIn 1985, Abel organized a TV hoax on The Phil Donahue Show. On that day's program, seven members of the audience appeared to faint during the broadcast, which was seen live on TV. Donahue, the show's host, thought the fainting was caused by both stress from being on television and an overheated studio on a morning that was cold and snowy outside. He cleared the studio of audience members and then resumed the show. It turned out the fainting \"spell\" was invented by Abel as a protest against bad-quality television.\n\"Omar's School for Beggars' was a fake school for professional panhandlers. As Omar, Abel was invited to many national television talk shows. He often made the TV hosts angry when he his lunch on camera. The hoax was a satirical commentary on the rise of unemployment and homelessness in the U.S. \nIn 1993, when euthanasia was a big topic in the news, Abel set up the fake Florida company \"Euthanasia Cruises\", which would offer cruises allowing suicidal participants to jump into the ocean after three days of partying. \nIn 1999, Abel appeared in the documentary \"Private Dicks: Men Exposed\", in which he claimed to be the current holder of the Guinness World Record for the smallest penis. Abel did not take off his clothes for the documentary crew. He said that he would only take off his clothes if they agreed to have group sex afterwards. Abel stated that \"They said no. So I didn't have to take off my shorts.\"\nAt the 2000 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, Abel introduced a campaign to ban all breastfeeding because \"it is an incestuous relationship between mother and baby that manifests an oral addiction leading youngsters to smoke, drink and even becoming anti-social.\" After 200 interviews over two years, Abel confessed the hoax in U.S. News &amp; World Report.\nAbel once ran for Congress. He promised to install a lie detector in the White House and truth serum in the Senate drinking fountain; he wanted all doctors to publish their medical school grade point average in the telephone book after their names; he proposed removing Wednesday to establish a four-day workweek.\nDeath.\nAbel died of heart failure complicated by cancer on September 14, 2018 in Southbury, Connecticut at the age of 94."}

It is studied in epistemology (the theory of knowledge). \nDefinition.\n\"Something (A) is relevant to a task (T) if it makes it more likely that the goal (G) can be reached. Similarly, understanding one concept often means understanding other concepts beforehand. This is the main reason why educators work from a syllabus which guides the order in which topics should be taught.\nEpistemology.\nIf schizophrenia is caused by bad communication between mother and child, then family interaction studies become relevant. If it is inherited genetically, then the study of family trees becomes relevant. If you are an empiricist, then only carefully designed observations are relevant. If you are a feminist, then the sex of the observer becomes relevant.\nEpistemology is not just one domain among others. Epistemological views are always at play in any domain. Those views determine or influence what is regarded relevant.\nRelevance logic.\nRelevance is argued to depend upon the \"remoteness relationship\" between an actual world in which relevance is being evaluated and the set of possible worlds within which it is true.\nPolitics.\nDuring the 1960s, \"relevance\" became a fashionable buzzword, meaning roughly 'relevance to social concerns', such as racial equality, poverty, social justice, world hunger, world economic development, and so on. The implication was that some subjects, e.g., the study of medieval poetry and the practice of corporate law, were not worthwhile because they did not address pressing social issues.\nThe contrary view is that the social world is not our only concern. We can be (and are) concerned also about many other things. Also, real-world problems are problems because there is no obvious way to solve them. Increases in crop production in the 20th century were all fuelled by developments in basic science, not by social movements."}

The dispute has gained significant media coverage, and has drawn legal attention to Cohen's involvement in the matter.\nIn August 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to eight charges, including one related to the scandal, and he stated under oath that he paid Daniels \"in coordination with and at the direction of a candidate for federal office,\" meaning Trump.\nThe first reports of an alleged affair between Trump and Daniels were published in October 2011 by the blog \"The Dirty\" and the magazine \"Life &amp; Style\". \nEvents.\nOn January 12, 2018, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that Cohen paid Daniels $130,000 in October 2016, a month before the presidential election, to stop her discussing an affair she allegedly had with Trump in 2006.&lt;ref name=\"Rothfeld_Palazzolo_1/12/2018\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nIn an interview with \"60 Minutes\" on March 25, Daniels said that she and Trump had sex once, and that later she had been threatened in front of her infant daughter, and felt pressured to later sign a nondisclosure agreement.\nOn April 5, 2018, while on Air Force One, Trump said he did not know about the $130,000 payment Cohen made to Daniels. He also said he was not aware of why Cohen had made the payment or where he got the money.\nIn May 2018, Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani said on Fox News that \"the president repaid\" Cohen the $130,000 that Cohen had paid to Daniels. Giuliani also said that Trump \"did know the general arrangement\" of Cohen's payment, but not \"the specifics\".\nIn June 2018, Daniels sued both Michael Cohen and her own former lawyer, Keith M. Davidson, accusing Cohen of encouraging Davidson to violate her attorney-client privilege. The lawsuit also alleges Trump was aware of the efforts for Daniels to deny the affair on media interviews.\nIn August 2018, Cohen officially surrendered to the FBI. That afternoon, Cohen pleaded guilty to eight charges: five counts of tax evasion, one count of making false statements to a financial institution, one count of willfully causing an unlawful corporate contribution, and one count of making an excessive campaign contribution at the request of a candidate or campaign. He also said two senior Trump Organization executives were also involved in the hush money payments.\nIn September 2018, lawyers for Trump said that Trump will neither enforce the non-disclosure agreement nor oppose Daniels' claim that it is invalid."}

They were very different from current organisms. They are considered to be one of the early forms of multicellular organisms. Their bodies were shaped like discs. Based on the fossils, they were between four millimeteers an 1.4m in size. They were only a few millimetres thick. Their body was segmented: there is a large central furrow, and smaller ones around the body of the organism. Their body was symmetric. Mostly based on the shape and size of the fossils found, they have been classified into different species. \nThe Dickinsonia species probably did not move around the ocean on their own: they used ocean currents to float around. Possibly they had a way to attach to the ocean floor. Their feeding probably resembled that of the placozoa.\nProblems with classification.\nThey were also compared to modern-day Cnidarians, Polychaetes, and Turbellaria. Because of the prominent central part, they were also seen as Chordates. Because of their feeding habit, they were classified as similar ot the Placozoa. It was suggested, that they lived in symbiosis with organisms doing photosynthesis, and were possibly comparable to modern-day Lichen; if the mechanism worked the same as in modern-day lichens, they would be fungi.\nDickinsonia are animals.\nA study published in 2018, has shown Dickinsonia were animals. \nVery little cholesterol was found outside the specimen in the surrounding rock. The Ediacara biota (571 million to 541 million years ago) is the first complex organisms in the geological record large enough to be seen without magnification.\nHistory of discovery.\nThe first fossils were found in the Flinders Ranges, in Australia in the 1940s. Reginald Sprigg, a paleontologist, published the first scientific study of Dickinsonia in 1947. Sprigg named the genus after Ben Dickinson, who was the director of the Mines of South Australia, at the time. In the study, Sprigg thought t he had found the fossil of a jellyfish. In 1956, Harrington and Moore classified Dickinsonia as Cnidarians.In 1966, they were classified as Annelids. Most Annelid fossils are quite different from fossilized Dickinsonia, but they resemble some fossilized marine worms. S. Manton contradicted this interpretation in 1967. Because of these incertainities, the discussion about how to classify Dickinsonia is still ongoing."}

It is also the highest Oscar nominated comic book movie, earning eleven nominations.\nA sequel is currently in development, with Philips, Silver and Phoenix expected to return.\nPlot.\nIn 1981, party clown and aspiring stand-up comedian Arthur Fleck lives with his mother, Penny, in Gotham City. Gotham is rife with crime and unemployment, leaving swaths of the population disenfranchised and impoverished. Arthur suffers from a medical disorder that causes him to laugh at inappropriate times, depending on social services for medication. After a gang of delinquents attacks Arthur in an alley, his co-worker Randall gives him a gun for protection. Arthur pursues a relationship with his neighbor, single mother Sophie Dumond, and invites her to his upcoming stand-up routine at a nightclub.\nWhile entertaining at a children's hospital, Arthur's gun falls out of his pocket. Randall lies that Arthur bought the gun himself, and Arthur is fired. On the subway, still in his clown makeup, Arthur is beaten by three drunken Wayne Enterprises businessmen; he shoots two in self-defense and wounds the third before pursuing him off the train and executing him on the stairs. The killings are condemned by billionaire mayoral candidate Thomas Wayne, who calls those envious of more successful people \"clowns\". Demonstrations against Gotham's rich begin, with protesters donning clown masks in Arthur's image. Funding cuts shutter the social service program, leaving Arthur without his medication.\nSophie attends Arthur's stand-up routine, which goes poorly; he laughs uncontrollably and has difficulty delivering his jokes. Arthur's idol, popular talk show host Murray Franklin, mocks Arthur by showing clips from the comedy routine on his show. Arthur intercepts a letter written by Penny to Thomas, alleging that he is Thomas's illegitimate son, and berates his mother for hiding the truth. Arthur goes to Wayne Manor, where he meets Thomas's young son Bruce, but flees after a scuffle with the family butler Alfred Pennyworth. Following a visit from two Gotham City Police Department detectives investigating Arthur's involvement in the train murders, Penny suffers a stroke and is hospitalized.\nArthur sneaks into a private event and confronts Thomas, who tells him that Penny is delusional and not his biological mother. In denial, Arthur visits Arkham State Hospital and steals Penny's case file; the file says Penny adopted Arthur as a baby and allowed her abusive boyfriend to harm them both. However, Penny claims that Thomas used his influence to fabricate the adoption to hide their affair. Distraught, Arthur returns home and enters Sophie's apartment unannounced. Frightened, Sophie tells him to leave; their relationship was merely a figment of Arthur's imagination. The following day, Arthur kills Penny at the hospital.\nArthur is invited to appear on Murray's show due to the unexpected popularity of his comedy routine's clips. As he prepares, Arthur is visited by ex-colleagues Randall and Gary. Arthur murders Randall but spares Gary for treating him well in the past. En route to the studio, Arthur is pursued by the two detectives onto a train filled with clown protesters. One detective accidentally shoots a protester and incites a riot, allowing Arthur to escape; the rioters brutally beat the detectives as Arthur leaves.\nBefore the show goes live, Arthur requests that Murray introduce him as Joker, a reference to Murray's previous mockery. Arthur walks out to applause, but starts telling morbid jokes, confesses to the train murders, rants about how society abandons the downtrodden and mentally ill, and berates Murray for mocking him on the previous segment. When Murray criticizes him and threatens to call the police, Arthur shoots him twice on live TV, killing him; he is arrested for murder as riots break out across Gotham. One of the rioters corners the Wayne family in an alley and murders Thomas and his wife, Martha, sparing Bruce. Rioters in an ambulance crash into the police car carrying Arthur, freeing him; he stands atop the car, dances to the cheers of the crowd, and smears blood on his face in the form of a smile.\nAt Arkham, Arthur laughs to himself about a joke and tells his psychiatrist she would not understand it. He runs from orderlies, leaving behind a trail of bloodied footprints."}

They are cephalopods from the Order Goniatitida. They evolved from earlier forms in the Middle Devonian some 390 million years ago.\nAll goniatites had an external shell like other ammonites. It was divided internally into chambers filled with gas, giving it buoyancy. An open chamber at the front of the shell was where the animal lived. It drew in and expelled water through a ventral spout called a siphuncle. They had a head with two well developed eyes, and arms (or tentacles). They were free-swimming. \nAlmost any fossil-bearing limestone or shale from inland seas of the late Paleozoic tropics or subtropics is likely to contain some goniatites."}

Tcl was made to be easy to use, but able to do many things. Tcl's language is based on commands which tell the computer what to do or how to save a variable. Tcl is able to do object-oriented, imperative, functional, or procedural styles.\nTcl is used a lot to in C to create prototypes quickly. There are interpreters available for many operating systems. This means many different kinds of computers are able to run Tcl code. Tcl is a very small language which means it is good to use as embedded systems.\nTcl is sometimes combined with Tk. When it is, it is called Tcl/Tk. Tcl/Tk is a part of the normal Python installation.\nHistory.\nTcl was created by John Ousterhout at University of California, Berkeley. Ousterhout won a ACM Software System Award in 1997 for making Tcl/Tk.\nSafe-Tcl is a form of Tcl that has certain parts turned off so it can't hurt the computer which is running it. Nathaniel Borenstein and Marshall Rose created Safe-Tcl. Safe-Tcl can only work on some files including email messages.\nExamples.\nIn Tcl programming, empty whitespace separates words. Commands are ended by going to a new line or a semicolon:\n word0 word1 word2 ... wordN\nThe first word is always a command which comes from Tcl's library:\n commandName arg1 arg2 ... argN\nFor example, the commmand \"puts\" makes the computer display something:\nIn that example, \"Hello, World!\" is called a string. Tcl adds a special character which can't be seen at the end of a line. This character tells the computer to go a new line after the command is complete.\nTcl is able to do math and many other things using variables. In order to use a variable, the programmer must set their value:\nAfter a variable is set, it can be used in other parts of the program or set to something different. Variables can be used to perform math:\nThe command \"expr\" tells the computer to solve the \"expression\" or, in this case, an equation."}

The wig used for Chitti's 2.0 look had a silver streak in the middle, made out of Yak hair, while its leather jacket was designed by Vogt.

It opened in 1849 as one of the first public museums in the United Kingdom. New Walk contains displays of both science and art, international and local.\nDinosaurs and fossils.\nTwo skeletons are permanently on display \u2014 a cetiosaur found in Rutland, and a plesiosaur from Barrow upon Soar. The dinosaur is a specimen of \"Cetiosaurus oxoniensis\". The 15 metre dinosaur is among the most complete sauropod skeletons in the world. The bones in the display are mostly replicas of the originals, which are too fragile to be used.\nThe Barrow Kipper, named after the flatfish, is a skeleton of a plesiosaur discovered in Barrow upon Soar in 1851. It has been wrongly classified twice, and at present has no accepted name. Other \"star attractions\" of the gallery are a \"Leedsichthys\" (a giant fossil fish) and a piece of the Barwell meteorite.\nThe museum has a specimen of international importance, the Charnia fossil. This was the first fossil ever described from undoubted Precambrian rocks. Until then, no large (non-microscopic) forms of life were known to exist at that time. The object in the museum \u2013 \"Leicester's fossil celebrity\" \u2013 is a holotype. It is the actual physical example from which the species was first identified and formally described. \"Charnia masoni\" was named after Roger Mason. He discovered it in Charnwood Forest in 1957, when he was a schoolboy. He who went on to a career as an academic geologist. The fossil had been discovered a year earlier by a schoolgirl, Tina Negus, \"but no one took her seriously\".\nArt.\nThe museum holds the UK's largest collection of German Expressionist art. These paintings, including works by George Baselitz, Wassily Kandinsky and Paul Klee, were smuggled out of Nazi Germany before World War II. The Nazis condemned the work of these painters. Hans Hess, son of the German-Jewish industrialist and art collector, Alfred Hess, was assistant curator at the museum.\nIn 2007, more than 100 pieces of art went on display at the museum, donated by Richard Attenborough, namely a collection of Picasso ceramic art.\nOther exhibitions.\nOn the first floor of the museum is an exhibition area that changes periodically. Recent exhibits have included a display focusing on the search for the remains of Richard III, a \"Wallace and Gromit\" display, and \"Spirits of War to Hands of Peace\", an exhibit of paintings and sculpture on the horrors of war and the power of peace."}

The term \"Weinstein effect\" came into use in October 2017. That's when media outlets began reporting on alleged sexual abuse against movie producer Harvey Weinstein.\nThe effect gave rise to the Me Too movement. That movement encourages people to share any experience of sexual harassment or sexual assault. The two events caused a cascade of allegations. The allegations brought about a fast removal of many men and women in positions of power in the United States.\nAs a result, many notable figures were accused of sexual harassment/abuse such as Kevin Spacey, Charlie Rose, Louis C.K., Dustin Hoffman, Matt Lauer, U.S. Representative John Conyers, United States Senator Al Franken, former Senate candidate Roy Moore, Les Moonves, Garrison Keillor, Welsh MP Carl Sargeant, Asia Argento and U.S. Associate Justice-nominee Brett Kavanaugh.

The word comes from the Greek adjective \"triptukhon\" (three-fold), from \"tri\", (three) and \"ptysso\", (to fold) or \"ptyx\", (fold) The paintings are usually joined together, with hinges, so that they can be folded shut or displayed open. The middle painting is usually larger, although they can be of equal size.\nA triptych is usually an art work, but the word can be used for anything in three parts which join together to make a single item. \nExample.\nThe English painter William Etty painted a 28 ft (8.5 m) wide and 9 ft 9 in (3 m) high triptych of the life of Saint Joan of Arc. Etty sold the painting; The new owners were an engraver and a dealer who went bankrupt in 1852. The paintings were separated and sold by 1893. The first panel which showed Joan of Arc finding the sword in the church of St. Catherine de Fierbois ended up in the collection of Llantarnam Abbey, Cwmbran, South Wales, U.K. The Second panel is in the collection of the Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts d'Orl\u00e9ans. The third panel has since been lost."}
{"id": "660254", "revid": "68157", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=660254", "title": "Epenthesis", "text": "Epenthesis is a term in phonology. It refers to adding one or more sounds to a word. \nIf it is added at the beginning, it is called\u00a0\"prothesis\". If added at the end of the word, it is called\u00a0\"paragoge\". There are two types of epenthesis: when a consonant\u00a0is added, and when a vowel\u00a0is added. The opposite process where one or more sounds are removed is called\u00a0elision.\nUses.\nEpenthesis can happen for many reasons. The rules of how sounds are placed\u00a0in a language may not allow vowels next to each other, but in different syllables.\u00a0Some consonant clusters\u00a0may not be allowed.\u00a0In this situation a consonant or vowel can be added to make pronunciation easier. Epenthesis may be shown in writing or may happen in spoken language.\nSeparating vowels.\nA consonant can be added to separate spoken vowels in hiatus. This happens with linking and intrusive R, which is a rule that puts an 'r' in a place where it doesn't normally happen.\nLinking consonant clusters.\nA consonant can be placed between consonants in a consonant cluster where the place of articulation is different (e.g., where one consonant is labial\u00a0(pronounced with the lips) and the other is alveolar. \nBreaking consonant clusters.\nA vowel can be placed between consonants to separate them.\nRegular examples in English are \"-i-\", used in making words from Latin such as \"equidistant\", and \"-o-\", used in making words from Greek roots or general compound\u00a0words, as in \"speedometer\".\nRules in present-day languages.\nIn French, is placed in inverted interrogative phrases\u00a0between a verb that ends in a vowel and a pronoun that begins with a vowel: ('he has') &gt; ('has he?'). \u00a0Because the \u00a0come from Latin ('he has') there is no epenthesis from the point of view of history. This is because the is the original third-person verb inflection. However it is correct to call it epenthesis in the modern language\u00a0because the modern basic form of the verb is , so the way the process works in the mind is to add a\u00a0 to the basic form.\nA similar example is the English indefinite article \"a\", which becomes \"an\" before a vowel. It comes from Old English \"\u0101n\" (\"one, a, an\"), which kept an \"n\" in all positions. From a\u00a0diachronic\u00a0(historical) analysis, the original \"n\"\u00a0disappears, except if a following vowel needs for it to stay: \"an\" &gt; \"a\". However, with a synchronic analysis\u00a0people can also see it as epenthesis: \"a\" &gt; \"an\". This is how most native speakers see it.\nIn Dutch, when the suffix \"-er\" (which has several meanings) is placed after a word which already ends in \"-r\", another\u00a0 is put in the middle. For example,\u00a0the comparative form (the form people use to compare things) of the adjective\u00a0\"zoet\" (\"sweet\") is \"zoeter\", but the comparative of \"zuur\" (\"sour\") is \"zuurder\" and not the expected *. The same happens with\u00a0the agent (someone who does something) noun form of \"verkopen\" (\"to sell\") which is \"verkoper\" (\"salesperson\"), but the agent noun of \"uitvoeren\" (\"to perform\") is \"uitvoerder\" (\"performer\").\nVariable rule.\nIn English, people often add a\u00a0stop consonant\u00a0in nasal + fricative combinations:"}

Glass-ceramic has very low thermal conductivity. It's a coefficient thermal expansion of almost zero. It lets infrared radition pass very well.

The series has received critical acclaim for its use of celebrity talent and combining entertainment with an educational series. \"Broadcasting &amp; Cable\" said the show was \"among the highest-rated PBS shows for school-age children.\" A reboot titled \"The Magic School Bus Rides Again\" began on Netflix on September 29, 2017. \nProduction and broadcast.\nScholastic Entertainment, Nelvana, Bardel Entertainment and PBS Kids made \"The Magic School Bus\" books into an animated television series. It began on September 10, 1994. Many parents and teachers wanted Scholastic Entertainment, Nelvana, Bardel Entertainment and PBS Kids to help girls and minorities learn more about science. Scholastic Entertainment, Nelvana, Bardel Entertainment and PBS Kids president Deborah Forte, Patrick Loubert, Delna Bhesenia and Pamela Aguilar said that making the books into an animated series helped kids \"learn about science in a fun way\".\nEach episode of the series ran for 30 minutes. There was a \"Producer Says\" part at the end of each episode when \"The Magic School Bus\" had no advertisements. There were no advertisements on international television, VHS, and DVD. The \"Producer Says\" part was taken out when \"The Magic School Bus\" had advertisements. This way, there was enough time for advertisements. Sometimes the episode faded to black at the start of the advertisements. When there are no advertisements, the episode faded to black and then faded back in.\nPeter Lurye wrote the song played at the beginning of the show. It was called \"Ride on the Magic School Bus\". Famous rock' n 'roll singer Little Richard sang it.\nBrian Muehl and Jocelyn Stevenson helped write the show. They also worked on \"Fraggle Rock\".\nBroadcast history.\nIn the United States, \"The Magic School Bus\" originally aired on PBS as a part of its children's block, PBS Kids, through South Carolina's SCETV network; it was the first fully animated series to be aired on PBS. The final episode aired on December 6, 1997; the series then aired reruns on PBS until October 1998. Fox Kids Network, in a hasty effort to fill educational television mandates for its stations, aired reruns on its weekday block from September 1998 to September 2002. Begining September 27, 2010, \"The Magic School Bus\" started a daily run on Qubo in the US, and on Saturday mornings on NBC. The Fox Kids and Qubo airings both used a shortened version of the opening. Based on information from their website, Qubo no longer carries \"The Magic School Bus\" in their programming lineup.\n\"The Magic School Bus\" was also seen on TLC from February 15, 2003 until 2008, and aired on the Ready Set Learn block on Discovery Kids from 2004 to 2009, TVOntario and the Knowledge Network in Canada and Pop, Channel 4 and CITV in the United Kingdom, with no plans to make more episodes. The series was widely known in Canada for showing reruns on CBC as part of its children's block, now known as Kids' CBC, from 1999 to 2004. In 2005, Nelvana sold the series to Latin America's Cartoon Network. Child-oriented network Qubo showed episodes between 2010 and 2012. In Canada, it ran on Teletoon from 1998 until 2000, and has run on TVO Kids from 1998 until the present time.

Only the VHSs and DVDs contain the funding credits. In the home video releases, all the episodes are uncut with the \"Producer Says\" segments intact. In the UK, it was broadcast until mid-2007 when it was removed off the air on Pop channel.\nOn July 31, 2012, New Video Group released the complete series on DVD in Region 1 for the very first time.\nOn August 15, 2013, Scholastic announced the entire series would be available on Netflix.\nReception.\nJason Fry, in a column for the online edition of \"The Wall Street Journal\", expressed an overall appreciation for the show, but wrote that the episode \"The Magic School Bus Gets Programmed\" should have been about the dangers of Internet searches and network concepts arising at the time, rather than an old-fashioned technology-run-amok story about the respective roles of programmer and machine (although he conceded that the episode was ten years old).\nTomlin won a Daytime Emmy for her role as Ms. Frizzle.\nGames.\nVarious computer and video games associated with the series were released from 1994 to 2001, and were typically amalgamations of storylines from both the original book series and the television show. The games were published by Microsoft Home for the Educational purpose.\nA video game titled \"The Magic School Bus: Oceans\" was released for Nintendo DS on October 25, 2011, ten years after the release of the last game. The video game, similar to the computer game before it, was likely based on the book, \"The Magic School Bus On the Ocean Floor\" and the TV episode, \"The Magic School Bus Gets Eaten\". This is the only game to have been released for the Nintendo platform.\nReboot series.\nOn June 10, 2014, a new series was announced by Netflix and Scholastic Media titled \"The Magic School Bus 360\u00b0\". The new iteration of the franchise features a modernized Ms. Frizzle and high-tech bus that stresses modern inventions such as robotics, wearables and camera technology. The producers hoped to captivate children's imaginations and motivate their interest in the sciences. 9 Story Media Group would produce the series. Producer Stuart Stone, who voiced Ralphie in the original series, stated that \"The Magic School Bus 360\u00b0\" will feature some of the original voice actors in different roles. The show's voice cast is based in Los Angeles, California, United States and Toronto, Ontario, Canada with Susan Blu as the Los Angeles voice director and Alyson Court as the Toronto voice director.\nIn February 2017, Netflix announced that Kate McKinnon was cast in the role of Fiona Felicity Frizzle, the younger sister of Ms. Frizzle, now Professor Frizzle, again played by Lily Tomlin. By this point the title of the series had been changed to \"The Magic School Bus Rides Again\". Lin-Manuel Miranda of \"Hamilton\" performs the theme song. The series began on Netflix on September 29, 2017."}

He produced the Russian film \"Countdown\" (Russian title: \"Lichniynomer\") in 2004. He also served as the Deputy Director of Renaissance Capital until 2006 and founded SP-Consulting.\nBiography.\nYuri Sagaidak was born in 1950 in Alma-Ata (today Almaty), completed his secondary-school education in 1968, and graduated in 1972 from the FSB Academy (known until 1982 as The Dzerzhinsky Higher School of the KGB). In addition to acting as a journalist for the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda, he worked for the foreign intelligence service of the USSR. He served first in Indonesia and then in the United Kingdom. In 1989, he was deported from the United Kingdom after being exposed and accused by the authorities of espionage. His expulsion was accompanied by a diplomatic scandal related to his attempt to recruit the UK Member of Parliament Lady Olga Maitland, who reported this to the Security Agency MI5. According to a local publication, Sagaydak was issued a temporary residence permit to live in Lithuania.\nYuri Sagaidak founded a limited company Consulit in Lithuania in 2011, which had a staff of five people[2]. J. Sagaydak remained the Director and sole shareholder of \u201cConsulit\u201d until February 2015.[3] He later worked in Austria.

The story takes the viewer deep into the bowels of Russian internal affairs and politics, and was well-received in cinemas. The story revolved around a group of individuals who had to work together to foil the attempts of a terrorist organization that was preparing to carry out an attack on Rome. Sagaydak\u2019s name is mentioned in the book [4] \u201cCinematic Terror. A Global History of Terrorism in Film\u201d by Tony Shaw.[5]\nYuri Sagaydak, was deputy general director of Renaissance Capital Investment Management Ltd. until 2006.[6] During the investigation in the Magnitsky case related to allegations in tax evasion and fraud Sagaydak gave testimony regarding the First Tax Refund of 2002, which was and still is not recognized as a crime by the Russian Government[7]. \nIn March 2011, Alexander Lebedev,[8] Russian entrepreneur and publisher of the British newspaper the Evening Standard, accused Sagaydak of cooperating with criminals and being involved in alleged extortion.[9]\nIn October 2015, the Lithuanian publication Veidas (Lithuanian for \"Face\") reported[10] on Sagaydak's links with the former Defense Minister and campaigner for Lithuanian independence, AudriusButkevi\u010dius, who did not deny cooperating with the KGB during the collapse of the USSR. The publication reported that Sagaydak had tried to emigrate to Lithuania giving Butkevi\u010dius's address, but his application had been turned down. Earlier in 1997 he was accused of committing an offence. Case of \u201cSnipers\u201d was instituted against the defendant and dealt with his participation in the shooting of pro-European demonstrators in Vilnius and his cooperation with the KGB. In October 1997 he was arrested in Vilnius whereupon he was imprisoned and sentenced to five and a half years in jail.\nIn November 2016, the Russian magazine Forbes (\u201cForbes\u201d) published an article entitled \u201cBad guys: why there are no positive heroes in the story of Sergei Magnitsky\u201d about the participation of Yuri Sagaydak in fraudulent transactions with shares of the Mikhailovsky GOK. The article states that one of the defendants in this case was Sagaydak.[11]\nIn April 2017, Edward Malnick, Deputy Investigations Editor at The Telegraph described the circumstances of the death of prominent Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky and linked Sagaydak together \nwith Dmitry Klyuev to Renaissance Capital Investment Management Ltd.[12] Sagaydak was recruited by Igor Sagiryan, his side, financial advisor to the Kremlin to work under Vladimir Dzhabarov.[13] Vladimir Dzhabarov is the First Deputy Chairman of the International Affairs Committee of the Federation Council of the Russian Federation. He is no. 2 on the U.S. Department of the Treasury list \"Sanctions Target Russian Government Officials, the Inner Circle that Supports Them, and Bank Rossiya, the Personal Bank for Officials of the Russian Federation\"[14] of 3/20/2014.\nIn February 2018, Valentine Low, a British journalist at The Times, described the circumstances around Sagaydak's expulsion from London in 1989 in the article \"My friend Yuri... the Communist spy[15]\".\nSagaydak is married with five children. His wife, Vera Aleksandrovna Sagaydak is CEO of the Vienna based Astreya Consulting[16], she lives permanently in Austria.\nIn August 2019, Isabelle Daniel, an Austrian journalist at OE24, repeated allegations against Vera and Yuri Sagaydak and disclosed their criminal record[17].

He originally wanted to learn to skate in order to play hockey, but soon became interested in figure skating. His coach, Osborne Colson, made him spend 30 minutes a day on basic stroking, edge work, cross-cutting and balance drills. Chan said, \"I tell people I owe the flow in my knees and the flow I generate from my edges to Mr. Colson.

He placed first in the short program, landing his first 4T in competition and was awarded a high grade of execution for the jump. In the free skate, he missed the 4T, but landed a 3A-3T combination for his first time in competition, and took the gold medal.\nAt the 2011 World Championships held in Moscow after a delay of a month, Chan won the short program with a score of 93.02 points, a new world record. In the free skate, he picked up 187.96 points (another world record), giving him a total of 280.98 points for his two days of competition.

He credited Krall with improving his quad jump.\n2012\u20132013 season.\nDuring the season, Chan was coached by Kathy Johnson and Eddie Shipstead. He left his longtime choreographer Lori Nichol and asked Jeff Buttle and David Wilson to produce his competitive programs.\nIn January, at the 2013 Canadian Championships, Chan ranked first in both segments and won his sixth Canadian national title.

Hanyu's program featured the same jumps as Chan, but he had achieved better quality and amplitude on the jumps, particularly the triple axel. Hanyu fell twice during his free skate and had another triple discounted for putting his foot down in the middle of a jump sequence, while Chan struggled on several of his jumps including a miss on a relatively simple double Axel. As a result, Hanyu outscored Chan in the free skate by 0.54 points to take the gold medal, while Chan received the silver medal.\n2015\u20132016 season.\nDuring the spring of 2015, Chan confirmed in several interviews that he would start training for the 2015\u20132016 season.\u00a0\nChan easily nabbed his eighth national tile at the 2016 Canadian Figure Skating Championships \nChan won gold at the 2016 Four Continents Championships, defeating Jin Boyang and scoring a new personal best in the free skate.

It is near the village of Val Marie, Saskatchewan. It is the second national park of Canada that was created in Saskatchewan. The park is next to the border between Canada and the United States. It is next to the state of Montana. More than 18 000 people visit the park every year.\nThe park was created in 1981. Before this, the only national park in Saskatchewan was Prince Albert National Park. The park has some of Canada's last prairie grasslands that humans have not affected. The park's climate also lets some rare and endangered plants and animals live there. Grasslands National Park also have Canada's last black-tailed prairie dog groups. The park is also a dark-sky preserve. Grasslands National Park is the darkest dark-sky preserve in Canada. It is also one of the darkest in the world.\nGrasslands National Park also has a lot of fossils. It has many fossils that can't be found in other parts of Canada. Some of the fossils come from the Miocene Era.\nHistory.\nBefore the 1950s, the First Nations people of Canada lived in the park. They hunted animals in the park.\nMany people wanted to protect the grasslands in the area. They also wanted to protect the plants and animals that lived in the area. In the 1950s and 1960s, many people wanted a large area of grasslands protected. A study in 1965 showed that this area of Saskatchewan would be the best place to start a park. Both the governments of Alberta and Saskatchewan created a group to listen to the public's opinion in 1975. The group said that the public wanted the park to be created.\nIn 1981, the governments of Saskatchewan and Canada signed an agreement. This would make sure that a park would be created. After the agreement was signed, Parks Canada bought two ranches. These ranches were near the Frenchman River and were . In 1988, many organisations came together to add to the 1981 agreement. This would make it so that Grasslands National Park would be created. The plan for the park would be that it would be around . Parks Canada continued to buy more land for the park from ranchers.\nThe park officially became a national park on 19 February 2001. This was because of the Canada National Parks Act. In 2006, some of the plains bison that lived in Elk Island National Park in Alberta were moved to Grasslands National Park. This was important because many of the bison in Canada were killed in the 1800s. It was the first time that plains bison were on the shortgrass prairies of Canada since the 1890s. 71 bison were first moved to the park. Nine years later, in 2015, there were 310 bison. There are now plains bison at other national parks in Canada.\nThe park became a dark-sky preserve in 2009. This was during the International Year of Astronomy. The park was chosen by the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada. It became Saskatchewan's second dark-sky preserve. In 2009, Parks Canada also added black-footed ferrets back to the park. They added 34 ferrets. People thought that the black-footed ferret was extinct. This is because the last time they were seen was in 1937 in Saskatchewan. Scientists from the United States began working on bringing them back to the wild. When Parks Canada added black-footed ferrets back to Grasslands National Park, there were already ferrets that were being added to places in the United States and Mexico. The scientists were working to bring back the black-footed ferret for many years. The people working at Parks Canada were working on bringing them back for many years.\nGeography.\nThe park is divided into two parts. The west park of the park (called the West Block) is in Division No. 4, Saskatchewan. The West Block has the Frenchman River valley. They also have a herd of 300 plains bison and many prairie dog colonies. The Frenchman Valley Campground lets visitors use camping sites and teepees. Backcountry camping is also allowed in the West Block. The east part of the park (called the East Block) is in Division No. 3, Saskatchewan. Visitors to the East Block can see views of the badlands and see the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene boundary in the rock."}

Performing negative actions, such as feeding Baron rubbish in the beginning of the game, causes Lore to become more evil and negative. Performing positive actions, such as feeding Baron dog food, causes Lore to become more positive himself.\nAn Alpha version of the game has been released - the full version is planned for release in December 2018.\nGameplay.\nHeartbound is similar to another role-playing game, Undertale, in that interactions with the environment causes the game's story to change. According to Pirate Game's website:\n\"Every time you interact with an object, talk to an NPC, forget to turn off a light-switch, take out the trash, or disregard a sparkly bush the game remembers this and will change subtly for all further interactions. The greatest part about this design is that it already works and is in the current builds of the game. Both minor and major differences are going to pop up throughout the game and give the community something to share with one another. Everything you do matters no matter what kind of player you are or choose to be.\" \nCombat.\nHeartbound has a different combat system to most other role-playing games. Instead of attacking enemies based on a statistics system, the player has to complete minigames, which can either deal damage or cause the player to lose health, depending on the exact minigame. Equipment can also be found around the worlds Lore explores, which will increase attack strength or maximum health. Battles are not random - they are supposed to occur at specific points in the game, although some are avoidable if the player goes down certain gameplay routes."}

It was the first Category 5 hurricane and the strongest on record to impact the Florida Panhandle, and was the fourth-strongest landfalling hurricane in the United States in terms of wind speed. As Michael became a Category 5 hurricane, the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season became a third consecutive season to feature at least one Category 5 hurricane since Matthew in 2016 and Irma in 2017; this also makes Michael the third straight \"M\" name to feature as a Category 5 hurricane since Matthew in 2016 and Maria in 2017 as well.\nThe storm passed near western Cuba on October 7-8.\nThe storm led to six deaths in Honduras, four in Nicaragua and three in El Salvador.\nMichael became a major hurricane on Tuesday, October 9, 2018.\nThe storm struck near Mexico Beach, Florida in the Florida Panhandle as a borderline Category 5 hurricane, which makes it the first tropical cyclone to make landfall in the United States as a Category 5 hurricane since Hurricane Andrew in 1992. It had a wind speed of 160 mph and a central pressure of 919 millibars. It was originally designated as a high-end Category 4 hurricane with wind speed of 155 mph, but from post-analysis, it was indeed a Category 5 hurricane as originally thought. It was said to be the strongest hurricane to hit Florida since Andrew in 1992 in terms of pressure which it had a central pressure of 922 millibars. It was also the strongest hurricane to hit the United States in terms of pressure since Hurricane Camille in 1969, which had a pressure of 900 millibars.\nRetirement.\nOn March 20, 2019, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name \"Michael\" due to extreme and very expensive damage it caused along its track, particularly in the Florida Panhandle and southwest Georgia, and it will never again be used for another Atlantic hurricane. It will be replaced with \"Milton\" for the 2024 season."}

It is a two-dimensional diagram which gives a computation of a mathematical function. \nThe field of nomography was invented in 1884 by the French engineer Philbert Maurice d\u2019Ocagne (18621938). It was used for many years to provide engineers with fast graphical calculations of complicated formulas. Nomograms use a parallel coordinate system invented by d'Ocagne rather than standard Cartesian coordinates.\nA nomogram consists of a set of n scales, one for each variable in an equation. Knowing the values of n-1 variables, the value of the unknown variable can be found, or by fixing the values of some variables, the relationship between the unfixed ones can be studied. \nThe result is got by laying a straightedge across the known values on the scales and reading the unknown value from where it crosses the scale for that variable. The virtual or drawn line created by the straightedge is called an \"index line\" or \"isopleth\".\nUse.\nNomograms were widely used for about 75 years. They allowed quick and accurate computations before the age of pocket calculators. Results from a nomogram are got quickly and reliably by drawing one or more lines. The user does not have to know how to solve algebraic equations, look up data in tables, use a slide rule, or substitute numbers into equations to obtain results. The user does not even need to know the underlying equation the nomogram represents. \nNomograms have domain knowledge into their design. For example, to create larger nomograms for greater accuracy the nomographer usually includes only scale ranges that are reasonable and of interest to the problem. Many nomograms include other useful markings such as reference labels and colored regions. All of these provide useful guideposts to the user. \nLike a slide rule, a nomogram is a graphical analog computation device. Like the slide rule, its accuracy is limited by the precision with which physical markings can be drawn, reproduced, viewed, and aligned.A slide rule is a general-purpose calculator, but a nomogram is designed to perform a specific calculation. Nomograms can still be used to check an answer from another, more exact but possibly error-prone calculation."}

Ibogaine, the active alkaloid, is also used to treat substance abuse disorders and depression. A small amount of ibogaine, along with precursors of ibogaine, are found in \"Voacanga africana\".\nNormally, the plant grows to a height of about 2m. It may eventually grow into a small tree up to 10\u00a0m tall. It has small green leaves. Its flowers are white and pink, while the fruit can be either an elongated oval shape, or a round spherical shape. Fruits are orange in color. Its yellow-colored roots contain a number of indole alkaloids, most notably ibogaine, which is found in the highest concentration in the root-bark. The root material, bitter in taste, causes anesthetic sensation in the mouth as well as systemic numbness to the skin."}

Dinosaurs show some of the most extreme variations in size of any land animal group, ranging from the tiny hummingbirds, which can weigh as little as three grams, to the extinct titanosaurs, which could weigh as much as .\nWe will never be certain of the largest and smallest dinosaurs to have existed. This is because only a tiny percentage of animals ever fossilize, and most of these remain buried in the earth. Few specimens recovered are complete skeletons, and impressions of skin and other soft tissues are rare. Rebuilding a complete skeleton by comparing the size and morphology of bones to those of similar, better-known species is an inexact art, and reconstructing the muscles and other organs of the living animal is, at best, a process of educated guesswork. Weight estimates for dinosaurs are much more variable than length estimates, because estimating length for extinct animals is much more easily done from a skeleton than estimating weight. Estimating weight is most easily done with the laser scan skeleton technique that puts a \"virtual\" skin over it, but even this is only an estimate.\nCurrent evidence suggests that dinosaur average size varied through the Triassic, early Jurassic, late Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. Predatory theropod dinosaurs, which occupied most terrestrial carnivore niches during the Mesozoic, most often fall into the 100- to 1,000-kilogram (220 to 2,200\u00a0lb) category when sorted by estimated weight into categories based on order of magnitude. In comparison, recent predatory carnivore mammals peak in the 10- to 100-kilogram (22 to 220\u00a0lb) category. The mode of Mesozoic dinosaur body masses is between one and ten metric tonnes. This contrasts sharply with the size of Cenozoic mammals, estimated by the National Museum of Natural History as about ."}

In the United States, lynchings rose in number after the American Civil War in the early-to-mid 1860s.\nAlthough lynchings went down in the 1920s, they have continued into the 21st century.\nMost lynchings were of African American men in the South. But women were also lynched. 92 women were lynched in the United States between 1882 and 1927. Also, white lynchings of blacks happened in the Midwest and Border States. There were also lynchings of Native Americans, Hispanics and Asian Americans in the West, including California. Even white people were occasionally lynched. \nAccording to the Tuskegee Institute, 4,743 people were lynched between 1882 and 1968 in the United States. This includes 3,446 African Americans and 1,297 whites. More than 73 percent of lynchings after the Civil War occurred in the Southern states. According to the Equal Justice Initiative, 4,084 African-Americans were lynched between 1877 and 1950 in the South. Whites lynched blacks to defend white supremacy. Blacks were lynched for violating social norms, including segregation (the separation of whites and blacks), and the lower status of blacks. White acted together to lynch an individual black person. In the Deep South, lynching was also used to scare blacks away from voting.\nAfter the Civil War, nearly four million slaves in the South were made free. In some states and many counties, freed blacks made up over half the people there. The first Ku Klux Klan was founded in 1866 by Confederate veterans in Tennessee. Ku Klux clan groups were then founded by veterans throughout the South. They wanted to keep African Americans in fear, as they were before the war. This was when lynchings became common. In the 1890s, African American journalist and anti-lynching fighter Ida B. Wells was one of the first people to study lynching cases. She found that black lynching victims were accused of rape or attempted rape about one-third of the time. The most common accusation was murder or attempted murder. Other accusations were verbal and physical aggression, spirited business competition, and independence of mind among victims.\nThe stereotype of lynching is hanging. Hangings are what crowds of people saw. Hanging is also easy to photograph. But there are other methods related to lynching. They include being shot repeatedly, being burned, dragged behind cars and being forced to jump from a bridge.\nIn the late-1800s to early-1900s South, photographs were taken at lynchings to print. These were used in postcards and newspapers. These images usually showed an African-American lynching victim and all or part of the crowd that attended. Women and children often attended lynchings. The people who killed the victim were not identified. At one particular lynching, nearly 15,000 people were in the crowd. Often lynchings were advertised in newspapers prior to the event so photographers could attend. After the lynching, photographers would sell their pictures as-is or as postcards, sometimes costing as much as fifty cents a piece, or $9, as of 2016."}

They include natural androgens such as testosterone and synthetic androgens. The synthetic androgens have similar chemical structure and similar effects to testosterone.\nThe steroids increase protein within cells, mainly skeletal muscles. They cause the development and maintenance of male secondary sexual characteristics. They stimulate the growth of hair on the face and body.\nThe word anabolic, in reference to anabolism, comes from the Greek word \"anabole\". That means: \"That, which is thrown up, mound\". \nAndrogens (or AAS) were synthesized in the 1930s. They are now used in medicine to bring on muscle growth and appetite. They also cause male puberty. AAS can also be used to treat chronic wasting conditions such as AIDS and cancer.\nLong term use of androgens can lead to or cause harmful health effects. These effects include harmful changes in cholesterol levels, acne, high blood pressure and liver damage.\nUse of androgens in sports, racing and bodybuilding as performance enhancing drugs is under controversy because of their adverse effects. There is also the chance to gain unfair advantage in physical competitions. The use of androgens in sports is called doping. Their use is banned by most major sporting bodies."}

It was hosted by Allen Ludden from October 2, 1961 to September 15, 1967 during daytime and was on primetime from January 2, 1962 to May 22, 1967 on CBS. A revival was made in 1971 and aired on ABC. The show spawned two revivals in 1979 and 1984 respectively, \"Password Plus\" and \"Super Password\".\nGame play.\nTwo celebrities play with two civilians in two teams of two people each \u2013 a celebrity and a civilian. A \"password\" shown on the screen is given to the celebrities/civilians and they have to give the partners one-word clues to get it correctly. For example, if the password was \"word\", someone would give the clue \"pass\" and the civilian/celebrity would try to guess the password (e.g. \"word\"). If the password is guessed in one guess, they get 10 points. Each wrong guess removes a point (e.g. 1 wrong guess makes it 9, 2 wrong guesses makes it 8, etc.). Two word clues (e.g. \"light sleeper\") or \"sounds\" were not allowed, other wise a buzzer would sound and Allen Ludden would say \"When you hear this sound it means your clue has not been accepted by our word authority (name of word authority)\". The first person to get 25 points wins $250 and goes to the \"Lightning Round\" where they are given 60 seconds to guess 5 words worth $50. Each one correct will cost that amount and a second game is played where a new set of civilians comes in (Prior to November 1962, the civilians switched seats instead). At the end of the show, Allen Ludden would give a \"password of the day\" (e.g. \"parties\") and would make a sentence about the password (\"\"Password\" is a great game to play at \"parties\"\") before signing off.\nThe show was announced by Jack Clark and announced all the \"passwords\" on the screen. Sometimes Allen Ludden would take a vacation and Jack Clark would fill in for him and Bob Kennedy would be the announcer on those occasions.\nThe word authority for most of the CBS run was Dr. Reason A. Goodwin. He wrote the \"World Book Encyclopedia Dictionary\" which was released in 1963, two years after \"Password\" began.\nIn 1966 the show switched from black and white to color. On the first color show (September 12, 1966) Allen Ludden said \"We're in color! Look at us-we're in color.\" This episode, along with many others are available on YouTube.\nTheme music.\nFrom 1961 to 1963, the theme song was called \"Holiday Jaunt\". From 1963 to 1967 the theme was called \"You Know The Password\". In 1971 a song by Score Productions was used. In 1974 the theme song was changed to \"Bicentennial Funk.\" \"Password Plus\" and \"Super Password\" used different themes for both versions.\nRevivals.\nIn 1971, the show returned on ABC. In 1974, the show changed its name to \"Password All-Stars\". The show was cancelled in 1975.\nIn 1979, a revival called \"Password Plus\" was made. After Allen Ludden died in 1981, Tom Kennedy took over as host. \"Password Plus\" was cancelled in March 1982.\nIn 1984, a new version called \"Super Password\" was made with Bert Convy as host. The show was cancelled in 1989.\nEpisode status.\nEvery nighttime episode was recorded on videotape and has aired on GSN and Buzzr. All daytime episodes before September 12, 1966 (except one from January 14, 1966) is gone forever. Color daytime episodes from September 1966 to 1967 last aired on GSN in 2009 and are currently airing on Buzzr.\nThe 1971 version is almost gone except for a few episodes.

A trapeze artist and commercial photographer, who used various stage names including Madame Olga, Lady Olga and Lady Olga Roderick. In her only film role in Tod Browning's cult classic \"Freaks\", using her sideshow stage name Olga Roderick, she was billed as the \"Bearded Lady\".\nBiography.\nJane Barnell was born in Wilmington, North Carolina, to George Barnell, a Russian Jewish itinerant wagon maker, and his wife, a woman of Irish and Catawban ancestry. When she applied for her social security card in May 1939, she gave her parents as George Barnell and Nancy Shaw. Her mother's name is not mentioned in the interviews she gave. She was their second child, and she had three sisters and two brothers. She was named after her maternal grandmother. Her mother was from York County, South Carolina. By two years of age, she was capable of growing a beard. Her mother took her to hoodoo doctors and other folk healers to remove her condition.\nIn 1875, Barnell's mother sold the 4-year-old Jane to the Great Orient Family Circus and Menagerie while her father was away on business in Baltimore. The circus consisted of the Muslim woman who worked as manager, two of her daughters who danced, and three sons who juggled and were tight rope walkers. Jane toured with the circus for several months around the South before the circus went to New Orleans, left for Europe, and took her with them. In Europe the circus toured with a German circus. She fell ill with typhoid fever in Berlin. She was placed in a charity hospital and later in an orphanage. She was later found by her father by the time she was five. He had either tracked the circus from the Carolinas to Germany, or the woman who ran the circus had the Berlin police contact the sheriff of Wilmington.\nAfter that incident, Barnell was placed in the care of her Catawban grandmother who lived in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina. She began to shave in order to conceal her condition. Her grandmother told her stories about Florence Nightingale, which inspired her to work as a student nurse in the old city hospital at Wilmington when she turned 17. She worked there for about a year until an unpleasant incident occurred that made her believe she would never have a normal life. She returned to her grandmother's farm. In spring 1892 she met a circus performer named Professor William Heckler who talked her into stopping shaving and got her employment with John Robinson\u2019s Circus. She tried several stage names before eventually settling on Lady Olga Roderick. At that time her beard was 13 inches long. She went back to North Carolina every winter until her grandmother died in 1899. She worked with the Robinson circus for fourteen years.\nAt some point during her life, Barnell worked as a trapeze artist before having a railroad accident that ended her career. She then became a commercial photographer.\nBarnell toured for a time with a number of circuses, including the Ringling Brothers circus, and later joined Hubert's Museum in Times Square, New York City. She appeared in a Tod Browning's 'Freaks' (1932) which, according to the documentary on the \"Freaks\" DVD (\"Freaks: The Sideshow Cinema\", 2004), left her unhappy with the overall portrayal of the sideshow performers in the film.\nIn April 1935, she was working at the Ringling Brothers' sideshow at Madison Square Garden.\nIn 1940, she was interviewed by Joseph Mitchell for an article for \"The New Yorker\". His interview is one of the few sources that exists about her life.\nThe exact date and place of her death is unknown. Her date and place of death has been erroneously reported online as October 26, 1951. That date comes from some researchers confusing her death with that of a Susan Jane Barnell. When approached by Diane Arbus about information regarding her death, Joseph Mitchell verified her passing.\nPersonal life.\nBarnell was married four times. Her first marriage was to a German musician who played in the band for John Robinson's Circus. She had two children with him. Her husband and their two children died within several years. Her second husband was a balloonist who was killed months after their marriage. Her third marriage was to an alcoholic whom she divorced. Her last marriage, in 1931, was to her manager Thomas O'Boyle, an orphan ex-circus clown and a sideshow talker for Hubert's Dime Museum. She had little contact with her family after she became a performer. She believed they thought she was a disgrace. By 1940, she claimed to have not seen her siblings in 22 years and believed them to be dead. One of her sisters worked as a nurse helping blind Chinese children.\nIn April 1935, she gave a slightly different account of her personal life when interviewed by Ruth McKenney. She claimed that she had been married thrice; the first time when she was fourteen; the second time when she was nineteen; and then to her husband of four years Thomas O'Boyle."}

As with other kinds of machine-learning, learning sessions can be unsupervised, semi-supervised, or supervised. In many cases, structures are organised so that there is at least one intermediate layer (or hidden layer), between the input layer and the output layer.\nCertain tasks, such as as recognizing and understanding speech, images or handwriting, is easy to do for humans. However, for a computer, these tasks are very difficult to do. In a multi-layer neural network (having more than two layers), the information processed will become more abstract with each added layer.\nDeep learning models are inspired by information processing and communication patterns in biological nervous systems; they are different from the structural and functional properties of biological brains (especially the human brain) in many ways, which make them incompatible with neuroscience evidences."}
