{"id": "357722", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=357722", "title": "Australian Aboriginal astronomy", "text": "Australian Aborigines were some of the first people in the world to develop ideas with astronomy. It is possible that their interpretation of astronomy is the oldest still alive today. Studying astronomical subjects \u2013 such as the Sun, Moon, stars and planets \u2013 and the way they appeared to move was used as a way to find and explain the relationship between people, nature and the sky. The ideas that came from this contributed to their basic perception of the universe (their cosmology), and still form an important part of traditional culture and knowledge. Many legends, art forms, music and ceremonies originate from interpretations of astronomical phenomena and objects in the sky. Many Aboriginal groups give spiritual or mythological meanings to these things. Some groups used their knowledge of the movement of objects across the sky to develop practical tools like calendars.\nOld Australian Aboriginal culture is an oral tradition, so knowledge of astronomy has been passed down through stories, song and dance. A lot of knowledge is kept secret, only passed to those who have been initiated. As in all aspects of Aboriginal society, some things are only known to men, other things are only known to women. The earliest written account of Aboriginal astronomy was published in 1857. It was written by Edward Stanbridge, an Englishman who became friends with the Boorong people of Victoria. \nAstronomy is a huge part of Aboriginal people's social, cultural and religious knowledge. It has little relation to the scientific theory of Western thinking. There are many different Aboriginal groups in Australia, and each interpret the sky in different ways. The interpretations all developed along the same lines and share the same basic themes, but can be very different in meaning. Most objects and phenomena are interpreted as figures or events in the Dreaming. Unlike in other ancient cultures, these legends and beliefs are still part of modern life for Australian Aborigines.\nSun and moon.\nIn most Aboriginal cultures, the Sun is regarded as a woman, and the Moon is a man. Tradition in Arnhem Land says that each morning, the Sun wakes up and lights a fire at her camp in the east. She then gets up and carries a torch across the sky from east to west, creating daylight. The Yolngu call her Walu, and believe that at sunrise and sunset her ochre body paint is brushed onto the clouds. At night, she is said to travel under ground back to her camp in the east. Similar stories are used to explain the phases of the Moon. For example, the Kuwema people say that at each full moon, he grows fat by eating the spirits of those who disobey tribal law. Some coastal peoples, such as the Yolngu, clearly saw the connection between the Moon and the tides. In other groups, the Moon is linked with fertility due to the similar pattern of the lunar cycle and the female menstrual cycle.\nSolar and lunar eclipses were widely explained as the male Moon and female Sun mating with or marrying each other. Several astronomers note that these explanations show Aborigines understood that eclipses are caused by the paths of the Sun and Moon crossing each other. Norris (2009) argues that early Aborigines must have had a very good understanding of this in order to identify a lunar eclipse as being caused by the alignment of the Sun and Moon (since the Sun does not actually appear in the sky).\nConstellations.\nIn his study of the central desert peoples, anthropologist Charles P. Mountford wrote that most, if not all, of the stars seen in the southern hemisphere had Aboriginal myths associated with them. Most groups distinguish red, white, blue and yellow stars. Stars are often grouped together in unique ways \u2013 some groups classify stars using social kinship systems. So many of the constellations known to Aboriginal groups are different to those known to Western astronomers.\nThe broad band of the Milky Way that runs across the sky at night is commonly interpreted by Aboriginal groups as a legendary river. Several groups in the central desert believe the river divides two tribes of ancestor spirits who live on either side. To some groups, the stars along the river represent fish; other groups, such as the Yolngu, believe the stars are the campfires of their ancestors. Other groups identfy the Milky Way as the Rainbow Serpent, a major creator being.\nEmu.\nThe Emu is a constellation known to many Aboriginal groups in Australia. It is not a constellation in the usual sense, because it is defined by areas of dark shadow between the bands of the Milky Way (caused by dust and gas clouds in space), rather than by stars. The emu's head is the very dark Coalsack nebula, next to the Southern Cross. The body and legs are other dark clouds trailing out along the Milky Way and across the Scorpius constellation.\nThis shape in the sky is said to have influenced the style of the emus drawn on rock art. Where it appeared in the sky during the course of the year indicated when ceremonies should be held. Just north of Sydney is a well-known set of rock engravings, one of which is an emu in the same pose and orientation as the emu in the sky. In autumn, the emu in the sky will stand directly over her portrait on the rock, indicating to the Kuring-gai people that it is time to gather emu eggs.\nAt the head of the emu, the Southern Cross is easily spotted in the sky, and there are many different interpretations of this constellation across Australia. Several groups identify it as an eagle, a sky god, or both. For the Arrernte, it represents the foot of Waluwara, an eagle spirit \u2013 the four bright stars mark his talons, and the Coalsack is his nest. To the Ngarrindjeri of South Australia, the Southern Cross is a stingray being chased by two sharks. The sharks, which is a sacred totem to the Ngarrindjeri, are represented by Alpha Centauri and Beta Centauri. In Victoria, the Boorong people identified the Southern Cross as the possum Bunya hiding from an emu spirit whose outline could be seen in the Coalsack nebula. To the Wardaman, the Coalsack is the head of a \"law man\". In 1972, the poet Oodgeroo Noonuccal wrote of the Southern Cross as the hands and feet of a wise leader named Mirabooka, who was given eternal life as a spirit in the sky.\nOrion and the Pleiades.\nAboriginal interpretations of the constellations Orion and Pleiades are very similar to the stories about them in Greek mythology. The stars of Orion are widely associated with young men \u2013 usually fishermen or hunters \u2013 while the seven stars of Pleiades are usually seen as young women. The two constellations often appear in legend together, and are part of the Dreamings of several language groups.\nIn the central desert region, the Pleiades are said to be seven sisters running away from the unwelcome attentions of a man represented by some of the stars in Orion. In Pitjantjatjara legend, the Pleiades represent the Kungkarungkara, a group of seven ancestral sisters. They are guarded by a pack of dingos from Njiru, the hunter, who is the stars in Orion's Belt. Njiru is said to have raped one of the sisters, who then died and became the darkest of the Pleiades stars. The sisters transformed into birds and fled to safety in the sky, but Njiru still chases after them. Other legends are less harsh: the Adnyamathanha, for example, believe the Pleiades are the wives of the stars in Orion. Tiwi people see them as a group of kangaroos being chased by a pack of dingos.\nThe similarity between these legends and the Orion and Pleiades of Greek mythology is believed to be a coincidence (by chance) \u2013 there is no proof of any cultural connection.\nYolngu people see the constellation of Orion as a canoe. They tell the story of three brothers who went fishing, and one of them ate a fish that was forbidden under their law. Seeing this, the Sun blew the three brothers and their canoe up into the sky. The three stars in the constellation's centre, which form Orion's Belt in Western mythology, are the three brothers. The Orion Nebula above them is the forbidden fish, and the bright stars Betelgeuse and Rigel are the front and back of the canoe. In this example, the astronomical legend has a clear message about a moral that people would follow on Earth. Aboriginal myths such as these are often focused around moral lessons, such as reminders of whether it is alright to eat certain types of food.\nTagai.\nTagai is a large constellation made up of Scorpius, Lupus, Centaurus, Crux, Corvus, with part of Hydra and one of the stars of Ara. In the culture of the Torres Strait Islanders, Tagai is a legendary sea hero. He is depicted as a fisherman standing in a canoe. His crew is represented by the six stars of the Pleiades and six stars of Orion. In the legend, Tagai's crew eats all the food and water that had been prepared for their journey. Tagai punishes them by tying them together and throwing them into the ocean. The stars in the sky are said to be their reflection.\nThe islanders used this constellation to tell the seasons. This calendar organised their cycle of fishing and farming, as well as their rituals and social activities. The appearance of the Pleiades told them that it was turtle-mating season, time for travelling and to prepare for planting before the rainy season.\nComets and meteors.\nUnexpected new arrivals in the sky, such as comets and meteors, were widely associated as omens of death or bad spirits. Ngarrindjeri people of the central desert say that a meteor is an omen of deathly disease. Tiwi-speaking people in New South Wales and the Kuninjku in Arnhem Land both interpreted meteors as the eyes of evil spirit creatures running across the sky hunting for the souls of the sick and dying. The idea of comets and meteors bringing misfortune and death was also shared by many other cultures around the world.\nImpact events are also described in Aboriginal legends, including in creation stories about particular landforms. An example is the Arrernte story about the creation of Gosse's Bluff, an impact crater said to be nearly 150 million years old. According to the Arrernte legend, this was created by a baby's cradle that fell from the sky world. The baby's mother and father are the evening and morning stars (Venus), still searching for their baby. Several other legends from across Australia tell about falling stars that bring fire to the earth.\nPractical uses.\nAborigines traditionally used the stars to navigate to where they wanted to go. This is still the case in the remote outback, where there might not be any other signs or landmarks. They also use the Sun, the Moon and the stars to tell the time. Aboriginal calendars are usually more complex than those from Western culture. Many groups in northern Australia use a calendar with six seasons, and know what season it is by what stars can be seen during that period. In 1857, an Englishman named William Edward Stanbridge published the first written account of Aboriginal astronomy. He wrote about the Boorong people of northern Victoria, and how they used astronomy to better understand seasons. They thought of the constellation Lyra as a malleefowl (which they called \"Neilloan\"). It disappears from the southern sky in October, and this event told the Boorong that the bird's egg-laying season had begun.\nOther groups know that when Orion first appears in the sky, dingo puppies are about to be born. When Scorpius appears, the Yolngu know that the Macassan fisherman would soon arrive to fish for sea cucumber and bring goods to trade. For the Pitjantjatjara, the rising of the Pleiades at dawn (in May) marks the start of the cool season, when some animals in the desert go into hibernation."}

Hings and engineering teams at Motorola led by Henryk Magnuski.\nTypical walkie-talkies today are phone sized and have a push to talk button. Walkie-talkie are used for various reasons, in the military, for amateur radio, and for personal use.\nHistory.\nThe first walkie-talkie was so large it had to be carried in a backpack, and was called Motorola SCR-300. Mortorola also made other Walkie-talkies during World War Two. During World War Two The first hand-held Walkie-talkies were also developed by Mortorola during WWII. \nDevelopment.\nThe idea of walkie-talkies did not get much interest until the war started in 1939. After a few years the Motorola team had improved them, so that the army could use them. There were also vehicle and tank versions. The British, Germans and Americans all had their own versions. \nMotorola also produced the hand-held radio during World War II, and it was called the \"handie-talkie\" (HT). The terms are often confused today, but the original walkie talkie referred to the back mounted model, while the handie-talkie was the device which could be held entirely in the hand (but had vastly reduced range).\nUses.\nWalkie-talkies are widely used in many settings, business, police force, military and recreation.

He was also White House Chief of Staff under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford. He also was Vice Chief of Staff of the Army. This is the second-highest ranking officer in the Army. He was in charge of all US and NATO forces in Europe.\nHaig was a veteran of the Korean War and Vietnam War. He received the Distinguished Service Cross, the Silver Star with oak leaf cluster, and the Purple Heart.\nOn February 20, 2010, Haig died from complications from a staphylococcal infection, aged 85.\nLife and career.\nHaig was born in Pennsylvania and had two siblings. His father died when he was young and he was raised by his mother. Haig went to college at Notre Dame University for two years before switching to the United States Military Academy. He later attended Columbia and Georgetown to get his masters. While in the army, he served in the Korean War in several major battles. He served as a commander in the Vietnam War. At one point, his helicopter was shot down and he saw two days of violent hand-to-hand combat. He was awarded the Purple Heart and Distinguished Flying Cross for his notable bravery in wartime.\nIn 1969, President Richard Nixon made him a national security advisor. Haig helped negotiate the ceasefire in the Vietnam War. Nixon promoted him to White House Chief of Staff after H. R. Haldeman resigned facing criminal charges. Haig has been praised by many people by keeping the government running during the Watergate scandal that brought down Nixon. Haig has even been called an \"acting president\" during the last days of Nixon's administration. When Nixon was forced to resign, Haig helped the new president Gerald Ford. He remained Chief of Staff during Ford's administration.\nIn 1974, Haig became Supreme Allied Commander of Europe, a job that made him the head of all NATO forces. In 1979 he survived an assassination attempt. In 1979, he retired from the army as a four star general. After this he was on the board of a number of companies. In 1981, Ronald Reagan appointed him as Secretary of State. In this new job, Haig was the head of US foreign policy. Haig believed that the US should take a strong stand against the Soviet Union.\nIn March 1981, Reagan was shot by John Hinckley, Jr., a mentally ill man in Washington DC. Vice President George Bush was on a plane, and Haig was put in charge of the government until Bush could be reached. He told reporters that \"I am in control here.\" Reagan made a full recovery.\nIn 1982, after Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands, Haig tried to solve the crisis peacefully by bringing UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Argentinian dictator Leopoldo Galtieri to negotiate. No solution was reached and the crisis ended with the full blown Falklands War between the two countries. The British won the war, and Galtieri's regime collapsed. In July 1982, Haig retired from the State Department. Reagan nominated George Schultz as the new Secretary of State.\nHaig ran for President in 1988, but George Bush beat him. Haig was involved in a number of businesses after leaving office. He also advised several presidents, who wanted his expertise in foreign policy. In 2006, President George W. Bush held a meeting of ten former State and Defense Secretaries. Haig was at the meeting. He published his memoirs in 1992.\nHaig died of natural causes on February 20, 2010.

He was born in St. Louis. He acted in numerous television sitcoms. \nRedd Foxx is one of the best-known comedians and actors of the late twentieth century. He was often vulgar, raunchy, and politically incorrect, but to millions of Americans, he was also the funniest person on television. His standup routines were huge hits, influencing scores of comedians to follow. His crass performances drew the ire of critics long before the likes of Eddie Murphy and Chris Rock, but the role that made his a household name was that of Fred Sanford on the show Sanford and Son. The TV show was a huge hit at a time when there were few black stars on television.\nFoxx's comedic talent was showcased early in life as he worked the nightclubs around St. Louis as a teenager. He left home at sixteen and got into trouble with the law on numerous occasions, especially after he joined a New York street gang. It was during this time that he befriended another up-and-coming black man who would later become known as Malcolm X. He worked every nightclub he could find as he developed his style during the early 1940s. Part of the reputation he developed in the clubs was that of a foul mouth, which was a big draw for some crowds but limited his appeal to larger audiences.\nHe worked the so-called \u201cchitlin\u2019 circuit,\u201d where black clubs became the training grounds for larger venues that he would later sell out. He came up with a new stage name in the clubs, combining his nickname \u201cRed\u201d with the last name of the baseball star Jimmie Foxx.\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Sanford drew larger audiences to his shows and sold a large number of comedy albums. His audience was still largely African American men, but times were changing and his comedy was beginning to reach people from all walks of life. He landed a movie role in the film Cotton Comes to Harlem in 1970, which was the springboard he needed to finally become a household name.\nSoon after his first movie role, television producer Norman Lear approached Sanford about starring in his own show. The show was based on a popular British comedy, but in America it took the name of Sanford and Son. The show was set in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles and gave many white Americans their first real look inside the lives of black families. He played Fred Sanford, the lovable junk dealer who was always bickering with his son. The show was an hit across racial lines, lasting 5 years and leading to more roles and more stardom.\nSanford went on to star in a number of other TV shows, including the The Redd Foxx Comedy Hour and The Redd Foxx Show. He used his immense popularity to garner even more movie roles for himself. In the late 1980s, he starred with Eddie Murphy in the critically acclaimed Harlem Nights, and worked the Las Vegas comedy circuit. His life came to a sudden end doing what he loved to do. He was shooting a new sitcom, The Royal Family, when he died from a heart attack in 1991.\nSanford\u2019s body of work continues to entertain a new generation of fans even today while continuing to rack up accolades. During his life, he became one of the small number of performers to have the lead role in a television show on each of the big three networks, Sanford and Son on NBC, The Royal Family on CBS, and The Redd Foxx Comedy Hour on ABC. His character, Fred Sanford on Sanford and Son, was ranked No. 42 in TV Guide\u2019s list of the \u201c50 Greatest TV Dads of All Time.\u201d\nFoxx died in Los Angeles at age 68 from a heart attack."}

Often they were written in Hebrew letters, including the block letters used in Hebrew today and Rashi script. Due to the insular (isolated) nature of many Jewish communities, many Jewish languages retained archaic (old) vocabulary and linguistic structures of the language from which they descended long after they had been lost or changed in later forms of the parent language.\nWidely spoken.\nAmong the most widely spoken Jewish languages to develop in the diaspora are Yiddish, Ladino, and the Jud\u00e6o-Arabic group of languages. Yiddish is the Judeo-German language developed by Ashkenazi Jews who migrated to Central Europe, and Ladino, also called Judezmo and Muestra Spanyol (our Spanish), is the Judeo-Spanish language developed by Sephardic Jews who lived in the Iberian peninsula. \nMany ancient and distinct Jewish languages, including Gruzinic (Jewish Georgian), Judeo-Arabic, Judeo-Berber, Krymchak (Jewish Uzbek) and Judeo-Malayalam (a kind of Indian language) have largely fallen out of use due the impact of the Holocaust on European Jewry, the Jewish exodus from Arab lands, the assimilation policies of Israel in its early days and other factors.\nYiddish was the language spoken by the largest number of Jews in the 1850s, but today the three most commonly spoken languages among Jews are English, modern Hebrew, and Russian\u2014in that order. Some people think that since Jews who use English and Russian have a lot of Jewish things to say and ways to say them, one day there might be a Judeo-English and maybe Judeo-Russian language."}

They live in the sandy and heathland areas of Europe. Adults are 60\u201370\u00a0mm in length. They are different from other toads because they have a yellow line down the middle of the back. They have relatively short legs. This gives them a distinctive gait, which is different than the hopping movement of many other toad species.\nNatterjacks have a very loud and distinctive mating call.\nLife history.\nNatterjacks live for up to 15 years and feed on insects, worms and small reptiles. At night they move around open land with little vegetation. Their tracks can often be seen in loose sand. They move large distances each night.\nReproduction.\nThe Natterjack Toad spawns between the end of April and July. They lay 'strings' of eggs in shallow, warm pools. Because the Natterjack Toad is often present in low numbers, its loud mating calls are important so that the sexes can find each other.\nFor Natterjacks, pools need to have a small slope with little vegetation on the banks and in the water. Sometimes the larvae die when the pools dry out. The Natterjack mates a few times each summer. The age of the young can vary from a month to 3 months in September. \nDistribution.\nThere are toads in seventeen European countries. In the British Isles the toad is mostly in coastal areas. In mainland Europe, particularly in the southern part of its range, it lives inland in a variety of places.\nIreland.\nThe Natterjack Toad is the only species of toad native to Ireland. It is found on the Dingle peninsula and Derrynane in County Kerry and also in County Wexford."}

The ballet was first performed in Hartford, Connecticut by Ballet Caravan in November 1937. A performance was given at the Martin Beck Theater in New York City on May 18, 1939, with Christensen again in the role of the attendant.\nMac is a young, good-looking filling station attendant. His evening solitude is broken by two young and greasy but good-natured truck drivers. The State Trooper (policeman) enters in pursuit. He lectures the boys on their disregard for the speed limit. A brash motorist, his wife, and bratty child interrupt. The Rich Boy and The Rich Girl enter. They are drunken refugees from a country club dance. They rhumba and the others join them. Suddenly, a gangster enters shooting his gun. Mac, the truck drivers, and The State Trooper thwart his attempt to stage a robbery. The Rich Girl however is caught in the gangster's line of fire and dies on the pavement. Her limp body is carried off. The spectators drift away. Mac settles down with his radio and a newspaper to wait for business.\nDance historian Grace Robert praises the ballet in her book \"The Borzoi Book of Ballets\". She singles out the characterizations in particular, noting that they are \"definite and well-rounded\" and that all of them are seen in terms that are \"balletic\". She points to the pursuit of the gangster as an especially effective moment. On a darkened stage, several figures with flashlights perform \"grand jet\u00e9e\" (leaps). The beams of light and flying figures create an effect \"dramatic out of all proportion to the simplicity of the means employed.\" The ballet was popular in South America when it was performed there in 1941 by an American company assembled by Lincoln Kirstein. Writing in 1949, Robert noted that only the score survived at that date but a suite arranged from it was heard occasionally in concert or on the radio."}

They are found in most of Europe, except for Ireland, Iceland and some Mediterranean islands. The toad usually lies hidden during the day. It becomes active at dusk and spends the night hunting for the invertebrates on which it feeds. It moves with a slow ungainly walk or a short jump. It has a greyish brown skin covered with wart-like lumps.\nThe toads in this genus are known as true toads. They have no teeth, a dry warty skin and horizontal pupils to the eyes.\nDescription.\nThe common toad can grow to about in length. Females grow larger than males. Those in the south tend to be larger than ones in the north. The head is broad with a wide mouth. The nose has two small nostrils. There are no teeth. The large, protruding eyes have yellow or copper coloured irises and horizontal slit-shaped pupils. They have a noxious substance called bufotoxin. It is used to keep away predators. The head joins the body without a noticeable neck. There is no external vocal sac. The body is broad and squat. The front limbs are short with the toes of the front feet turning inwards. At breeding time, the male gets nuptial pads on the first three fingers. These are to hold the female. The back legs are short and the back feet have long, unwebbed toes. There is no tail. The skin is dry and covered with small warts. The colour is brown, olive-brown or greyish-brown. Sometimes it is partly blotched or banded with a darker shade. The common toad tends to be sexually dimorphic. The females are browner and the males greyer.\n The underside is a dirty white spotted with grey and black patches.\nCommon toads can live for many years. They have lived for fifty years in captivity. In the wild, common toads are thought to live for about ten to twelve years. Their age can be found by counting the number of yearly growth rings in the bones of their phalanges.\nBehaviour.\nThe common toad usually moves by walking rather slowly or in short jumps using all four legs. It spends the day hiding. It comes out at dusk. It may travel some distance in the dark while hunting. It is most active in wet weather. By morning it has returned to its base. It may live in the same place for several months. It has a large appetite and eats woodlice, slugs, beetles, caterpillars, flies, worms and even small mice. Small, fast moving prey may be caught by a flick of the tongue. Larger items are grabbed with the jaws. Having no teeth, it swallows food whole in a series of gulps. It will try to eat any small, dark coloured, moving object it encounters at night. A research study showed that it would snap at a moving piece of black paper as if it were prey. It would ignore a larger moving piece. On occasion, the common toad sheds its skin which comes away in tattered pieces. The skin is then eaten.\nWhen attacked, the common toad puffs up its body and stands with its back end raised and its head lowered. Its main means of defence is a foul tasting secretion. It has a bufotoxin called bufagin and is enough to keep away many predators. Grass snakes seem to be unaffected by it. Other predators of adult toads include hedgehogs, rats and mink, and even domestic cats. Birds that feed on toads include herons, crows and birds of prey. The tadpoles also have noxious substances which keep fishes from eating them but not the great crested newt. Aquatic invertebrates that feed on toad tadpoles include dragonfly larvae, diving beetles and water boatmen. These usually avoid the noxious secretion by puncturing the tadpole's skin and sucking out its juices.\nA parasitic fly, \"Lucilia bufonivora\", attacks adult common toads. It lays its eggs on the toad's skin. When these hatch, the larvae crawl into the toad's nostrils and eat its flesh.\nReproduction.\nThe common toad comes out of hibernation in spring. Large numbers of toads move towards the breeding ponds. The toads meet on certain ponds that they favour. Adults use the same pond year after year. Over 80% of males marked as juveniles have been found to return to the pond at which they were spawned.\nThe males arrive first and stay for several weeks. The females only stay long enough to mate and spawn. Rather than fighting for the right to mate with a female, male toads use the pitch of their voice. Croaking gives a sign of body size and prowess. Fights do sometimes happen. Male toads outnumber female toads at breeding ponds.\nThe males mount on the females' backs. They hold the females with their front limbs in a grip called amplexus. The males are very enthusiastic. They will try to grasp fish or inanimate objects and often mount on the backs of other males. Sometimes several toads form a heap, each male trying to grasp the female at the base. It is a stressful period and deaths are high among breeding toads. A successful male stays in amplexus for several days. The female lays a long, double string of small black eggs. He fertilises them with his sperm. The egg strings may have 3,000 to 6,000 eggs and be in length. They get tangled in plant stalks.\nThe strings of eggs absorb water and swell in size. Small tadpoles hatch out after two to three weeks. At first they hold onto the remains of the strings and feed on the jelly. They later attach themselves to the underside of the leaves of water weed before becoming free swimming. The tadpoles look like those of the common frog (\"Rana temporaria\"). They are a darker colour, being blackish above and dark grey below. They can be told apart from the tadpoles of other species by the fact that the mouth is the same width as the space between the eyes, and this is twice as large as the distance between the nostrils. Over a few weeks their legs develop and their tail slowly gets reabsorbed. By twelve weeks of age, they are small toads measuring about long and ready to leave the pond.\nThe common toad reaches maturity at three to seven years.\nConservation.\nThe IUCN Red List of Threatened Species says the common toad is of Least Concern. This is because it lives in many areas and is common in those areas. It is not threatened very much by habitat loss. It can live in many different areas. Chytridiomycosis, an infectious disease of amphibians, has been reported in common toads in Spain and the United Kingdom. This may affect some populations.\nCultural significance.\nThe toad has long been thought to be an animal of ill omen or a connection to the other world. This may be because it is at home both on land and in the water. It may cause people to not like it because of its blackish, warty skin, its slow movements and the way it comes from some dark hole.\nOne of the earliest references to toads as being linked to the forces of darkness was when Zoroaster said in 600 BC that all toads should be killed. In Europe in the Middle Ages, the toad was associated with the Devil, whose coat-of-arms has three toads on it. It was thought that the toad could poison people. It was also thought that it was the witch's familiar and thus had magical powers. In France it was thought that witches could be found because they were marked by a toad's foot somewhere on their body. In Dorset it was believed that if one found a toad in the house it should be removed without harming it or the householder would face the wrath of the witch whose familiar it was. In some areas, the finding of a toad in a house was seen as evidence that a witch was present. The saliva of the toad was thought to be poisonous. It was believed that it could spit or vomit poisonous fire. It was thought unlucky for a toad to jump over one's foot and in some regions, this was a sign of death. Toads were associated with devils and demons and in \"Paradise Lost\". John Milton showed Satan as a toad when he poured poison into Eve's ear. The First Witch in Shakespeare's Macbeth gave instructions on using a toad in the making of spells:\nThe toad is also associated with female fecundity. Models of toads were left at shrines by women who wanted to conceive. In Romania it was believed that someone who killed a toad was able to kill their own mother. In Scottish folklore it was said that the tongue of a toad, carried by a man in his breast pocket, would let him have his way with any woman. It was also believed that there was a jewel inside a toad's head called a \"toadstone\". It was said that when worn as a necklace or ring would warn the wearer of attempts to poison them. Shakespeare mentioned this in \"As you like it\":\nTouching a toad has long been thought to cause warts. This has been shown to be a myth and warts are actually caused by the human papillomavirus. They are transferred by direct contact from person to person.\nMr. Toad Esq. is one of the main characters in the children's novel, The Wind in the Willows, by Kenneth Grahame. This has been dramatized by several authors including A. A. Milne who called his play Toad of Toad Hall. Mr Toad is a very conceited,anthropomorphic toad."}

{"id": "358744", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=358744", "title": "Horatio Alger, Jr.", "text": "Horatio Alger, Jr. (January 13, 1832 \u2013 July 18, 1899) was an American writer. He wrote magazine stories and poems, a few novels for adults, and 100 plus boys' books. His boys' books were hugely popular.\nAlger was born in Massachusetts, and attended Harvard College. He became a Unitarian minister, but his career as a clergyman was brief. It ended when his congregation charged him with child molestation. Criminal charges were not placed against him, but his career in the church was finished.\nHe moved to New York City to become a professional writer. In 1868, Alger found his place in the literary world with his fourth boys' book, \"Ragged Dick\". This book is about a poor shoe shine boy in New York City who rises to middle class comfort and security through hard work, honesty, and a little luck. The book was a great success.\nAlger continued to write boys' books. They were similar to \"Ragged Dick\" in theme and other details. Characters such as the poor but honest boy, the snobbish youth, and the greedy lawyer appeared in one book after another. Details changed from book to book, but the essentials remained the same. Boys loved the books.\nBy the 1870s, boys' tastes had changed. They wanted cowboys, hunters, and Indians. Alger headed west to gather material for future books. The trip had little impact on his writing however. He wrote four books set in the west called the \"Pacific Series\", but they were stuck in Alger's rags-to-riches rut.\nIn the last decades of the 19th century, boys' tastes changed again. They wanted violence, murder, and other sensational themes. Alger gave them what they wanted. Public librarians did not like these books. They wondered whether children should be reading them. They began throwing Alger's books away.\nAlger passed his last years quietly. He went to the theatre, visited old friends, and kept in touch with the boys he had helped over the years. He based new books on those of his past. He died at his sister's home in South Natick, Massachusetts, in 1899.\nBiography.\nBoyhood.\nHoratio Alger, Jr. was born in Chelsea, Massachusetts on January 13, 1832. His parents were Horatio Alger, a Unitarian clergyman, and his wife Olive Augusta Fenno Alger. Horatio was the eldest of the couple's five children. He was a descendant of several Plymouth Pilgrims, a brigadier general of the American Revolution, and a member of the Constitutional Convention.\nHoratio was a sickly child. He had asthma and myopia. He was timid and shy. He was bullied by the bigger boys in the neighborhood. His father decided Horatio would become a clergyman. He taught the boy Greek and Latin. He took Horatio along with him on parish house calls to give the boy a sense of a minister's duties.\nEducation.\nIn 1842, Horatio entered the Chelsea Grammar School. He was a good student. His father had money troubles about this time. He took a better paying job in Marlborough, Massachusetts, a farming community about 25 miles west of Boston. The Alger family moved there in December 1844.\nIn Marlborough, Horatio went to a prep school called Gates Academy. He began writing poems and short stories. He sent his writings to local newspapers. The family's money troubles made a lasting impression on Horatio. Money ills like foreclosure and bankruptcy became themes in his books. He had fond memories of Marlborough, despite the family's woes. Quiet country villages are settings in many of his boys' books.\nAlger entered Harvard College in 1848. He became a professional writer the following year when he sold two essays and a poem to a Boston magazine. He was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, a fraternity for outstanding scholars. He graduated in 1852, ranking eighth in a class of eighty-eight. He went to Harvard Divinity School in 1853. He quit the same year to take a job as an assistant editor with a Boston magazine. He hated editing, and quit in 1854.\nHe taught briefly in two New England boys' boarding schools. In 1856 he published \"Bertha's Christmas Vision\", a book of short stories and poems. He returned to the Harvard Divinity School in 1857, and graduated in 1860. His health was poor. He was rejected for military service during the American Civil War, but wrote for the Union cause instead. His first boys' book \"Frank's Campaign\" was published in 1864.\nAlger's ministry.\nOn December 8, 1864, Alger became pastor of the First Unitarian Church and Society in Brewster, Massachusetts. The people of Brewster liked him. He was a good speaker. He played ball games with the boys, and took walks with them. He kept writing stories, and sent them to a boys' magazine in Boston called \"Student and Schoolmate\". He wrote another boys' book, \"Paul Prescott's Charge\". It was published in September 1865. The critics gave it good reviews.\nEarly in 1866, the people of Brewster accused Alger of sexually molesting two boys. These boys were 13 and 15 years old. Three men of the church discovered that this was true. Alger said that he had been \"unwise\", and quit his job with the Brewster church. He left town quickly, and went to his parents' home in South Natick, Massachusetts.\nHis father got in touch with Unitarian church authorities in Boston. He promised them that his son would never take a job in the church again. These authorities were satisfied. Further action was not taken. This was probably done so Alger's father would not be publicly embarrassed. Some members of the Brewster church wanted Alger put to death as the Bible ordered. Alger never mentioned his days in Brewster again.\nLife in New York City.\nIn April 1866, Alger moved to New York City to become a professional writer. In the summer of 1866, he wrote \"John Maynard\". This is a poem about a real shipwreck on Lake Erie. It brought Alger the notice of other writers when it was published in \"Student and Schoolmate\" in January 1868. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, for example, sent a letter of compliments to Alger. Children loved the poem and read it aloud in classrooms for many years.\nAlger loved the attention, but he needed money. He rewrote some of his old stories. One became his third boys' book \"Charlie Codman's Cruise\". Although readers liked the book, it did not make much money. Alger made more money with the boys' stories he published in \"Student and Schoolmate\". His writings for boys satisfied his two biggest concerns at this time\u2014the need for a good income and the need to atone for his crimes in Brewster.\nAlger met many poor boys on the docks and streets of New York City. These boys had been made homeless by the Civil War. They had drifted to the city looking for work. Alger collected material from them about their lives in the city and the lives of the poor. He put this material into his books.\nSome of these real boys became characters in his books. Johnny Nolan, for example, was one of the first boys Alger met in New York City. He appears in several of Alger's early books as a lazy, carefree street boy. Alger often had a crowd of street boys in his apartment. They would play while Alger sat calmly at his desk writing a page or two for his latest book. There is no record of sexual misconduct on Alger's part during this period.\nNewsboys Lodging House.\nIn 1866, Alger began visiting the shelters for homeless boys in the city such as the YMCA, the Five Points Mission, and the Newsboys Lodging House. This last shelter was opened in 1854 by people concerned about the welfare of street children.\nAt this shelter, a homeless boy could have a hot meal and a clean bed for a few pennies. He could come and go as he pleased. There was even something like a savings bank at the shelter.\nAlger had his own room, a desk, and a bed at the Newsboys Lodging House. He wandered about in slippers and an old sweater talking to the boys. In this way, he gathered the material he needed for his stories. In the introductions to his books, Alger asked his readers to give generously to such shelters.\nSuccess with \"Ragged Dick\".\nIn October 1866, Reverend Henry Morgan published \"Ned Nevins, the Newsboy; or, Street Life in Boston\". It was a great success. Alger sharpened his pencils and began a similar story. He wanted readers to believe his story was a realistic picture of street life, but it was actually a sentimental story that carefully avoided any mention of the sex and violence that threatened street boys every day.\nIn January 1867, Alger's \"Ragged Dick\" began serialization (publication in parts) in \"Student and Schoolmate\". The story is about a poor shoe shine boy's rise to middle class comfort and security. The book was a huge success. Boys' loved it. It had all sorts of exciting adventures in a big city. It had lots of street slang. It exposed the swindles and crimes practiced by big city crooks. The story surprised and delighted boys in small town America. They had never read of such things.\nThe parts of the story were gathered together and published as a book in 1868. It became Alger's all-time bestseller. It is the first in the 6-volume Ragged Dick Series. This series follows the further adventures of Ragged Dick and his friends. Alger wrote almost entirely for boys after the success of \"Ragged Dick\". He had found his place in literary America.\nTrips West.\nIn 1875, Alger's stories about street boys were growing stale. Boys' tastes had changed. They wanted exciting stories about hunters, cowboys, and Indians. Alger went West to look for material.\nHe arrived in California in February 1877. He travelled the length of the West Coast, then returned to New York late in the year. In 1878, Alger went West again.\nThese two trips had little impact on his stories. He wrote a few dull books with western settings in the following years, but remained stuck in his \"poor boy makes good\" formula.\nBacklash.\nIn the early 1870s, librarians, teachers, ministers, and others interested in the well being of the young said the stories by Alger and other boys' writers were not suitable for children. These people thought such books were too violent.\nCritics said his popularity among boys was due to his \"sensational\" style. In 1877, one minister wondered why the public library allowed children to read books that could only demoralize and weaken them. He complained about \"the endless reams of such drivel poured forth by Horatio Alger, Jr.\" In 1879, a public library in Vermont was the first library in America to throw away Alger's books. Other public libraries then did the same.\nAlger's publisher A. K. Loring of Boston, Massachusetts was a victim of this censorship effort. The company had relied on Alger's stories to make them money, but Loring went bankrupt in 1881. These efforts to get rid of Alger's books were defeated. People started reading them again after his death.\nBiographies.\nIn 1881, Alger wrote President James A. Garfield's biography, \"From Canal Boy to President\". He thought this was serious literary work. He hoped the book would make him famous. He paid no attention to the facts however. Instead, he filled the book with exciting details to thrill boy readers. The book was a success. It sold 20,000 copies. The publisher wanted to bring out an entire series about the great men of America.\nAlger was hired to write Abraham Lincoln's biography. Once again, he paid no attention to the facts. He wrote thrilling details for boy readers. The book did not sell well. He went on to write a biography of Daniel Webster. Then he stopped writing biographies. He said such books were time-consuming and required too much work. The publisher dropped the idea of a series.\nLast years.\nAlger led a quiet life in the years before his death. He dined out, went to the theater, and visited old friends. He kept in touch with the boys he had taken an interest in over the years. He read parts of \"Ragged Dick\" to boys' groups.\nHe was a Republican, and took an interest in politics. He forgot his past life in Brewster, and wrote of his days as a clergyman: \"I studied theology chiefly as a branch of literary culture and without any intention of devoting myself to it as a profession.\"\nThe quality of his writing deteriorated in his last years. He reworked his old books. Times had changed. Boys wanted more excitement and violence in books. Alger gave them what they wanted.\nCritics complained of the sameness in his characters, themes, and other details. Alger defended his work. He said that his readers did not object to the \"family resemblances\", so why should the critics?\nDeath.\nIn the last years of the 1890s, Alger's books did not sell well. His income dwindled. In 1896, he had (what he called) a nervous breakdown. He moved to his sister's house in South Natick, Massachusetts. He died there on July 18, 1899 after an asthma attack. He was almost forgotten by the public in his last years. His death received little attention in the newspapers.\nAlger once estimated that he made no more than $100,000 during his New York years (1866\u20131896). He was paid about US$250 for each of his stories published in parts in magazines. He received a small amount of money when each story was published in book form. He was not rich at the end of his life, but he was not poor either. He left only small amounts of money to family and friends. He also left them his copyrights, his manuscripts, and his personal library.\nRenewed interest.\nPeople became interested in Alger's books in the twenty years after his death. This was the Progressive Era. It was a time when people wanted honest business practices, equal opportunity, and a return to old-fashioned values. About seventeen to twenty million Alger books were printed and sold during this time.\nPeople lost interest in Alger's books in the early 1920s. His leading publisher stopped printing the books.\nAlger was competing at that time with \"The Rover Boys\", \"Tom Swift\", and other popular books for boys. Surveys in 1932 and 1947 indicated that very few children had read or even heard of Alger. In 1932 (one hundred years after Alger's birth), \"The Literary Digest\" declared him \"forgotten\".\nJust before his death, Alger claimed to have sold 800,000 books during his years as a writer. After his death, his books sold at one million \"per year\". More Alger books were sold per year after his death than were sold during the writer's lifetime. Edward Stratemeyer, the head of a company that published a great amount of boys' fiction, adopted Alger's heroic moral stance to his own books for boys. Other writers adjusted Alger's morality and ethics to suit more money-focused times. These revisions remained strong until the beginning of the Great Depression in 1929.\nBoys' books.\nThe quality of his literary allusions however makes his writing distinctive. These allusions set his work apart from the books cranked out in the \"fiction factories\" of the day. Great authors alluded to in Alger's boys' book include Shakespeare, Milton, Longfellow, Cicero, Horace, Alexander Pope, Joseph Addison, and dozens of others. The Bible is referenced in more than half of his works. These allusions reveal Alger's knowledge of literature and \"enhance the literary quality of his work\".\nThe most prevalent theme in Alger's novels is the \"rise to respectability\". Business success was important to the young Alger hero, but even more important was becoming a respected citizen. This does not mean a rise to wealth and riches. Many of Alger's books end with their young heroes getting modest clerical jobs in large firms. These jobs offer chances to rise further. Alger's heroes deserve their good fortune because they are virtuous young men. Alger was mainly a moral instructor for the young. He was content to guide boys on the path of piety and moral virtue rather than business success. Other themes in his works include Strength through Adversity, Beauty versus Money, the Country versus the City, the Old World versus the New World, and the Search for an Identity.\nAlger's books are filled with stereotypical characters and dramatic highpoints (setpieces) played over and over again in book after book. One such setpiece is the struggle between the virtuous young hero and a snobbish youth. These setpieces always end with the snobbish youth getting his just deserts. This particular setpiece likely has its source in the childhood bullying Alger suffered from neighborhood boys in Chelsea.\nOther setpieces include the cold, unfeeling lawyer threatening the young hero and his widowed mother with foreclosure (another setpiece taken from Alger's childhood), and the brutal poorhouse staff making the young hero's life miserable while he dwells under their roof. Alger's young readers never tired of these stock characters and setpieces.\nIn the 1970s Alger's work was regarded by readers and scholars as almost unreadable. He received a new lease on literary life when his homosexuality became known. Edwin Hoyt speculated in \"Horatio' Boys\" (1974) that Alger might become of interest to communities outside the literary one, and may even attain a status to rival that of Oscar Wilde.\nLiterary influences.\nAlger's success stories provided material for satirists. One of the earliest satires is William Dean Howells' \"The Minister's Charge; or, The Apprenticeship of Lemuel Barker\" (1887). This novel satirizes in a serious, realistic way Alger's \"country boy makes good\" theme. Stephen Crane satirizes the Alger success story with a ridiculous version of one in \"A Self-Made Man: An Example of Success That Anyone Can Follow\" (1899).\nIn the 20th century, F. Scott Fitzgerald satirized Alger in his play \"The Vegetable: or From President to Postman\" (1922), the Dan Cody episode in \"The Great Gatsby\" (1925), and the short story \"Forging Ahead\" (1929). Nathaniel West parodied Alger in \"A Cool Million\" (1934). John Seelye did the same in \"Dirty Tricks; or, Nick Noxin's Natural Nobility\" (1973). Glendon Swarthout followed the sexual misadventures of an Alger anti-hero in \"Luck and Pluck\" (1973). William Gaddis took the Alger success story to absurd lengths in \"JR\".\nLegacy.\nThe Horatio Alger Association is a \"nonprofit educational organization, [that] was established in 1947 to dispel the mounting belief among the nation's youth that the American Dream was no longer attainable.\" The Association awards scholarships to young people who pursue their own idea of the American Dream.\nAn annual street fair (once the Horatio Alger Street Fair) was held annually in October in Marlborough, Massachusetts. The Fair became the Heritage Festival in 2006, and Alger's name dropped from the event. It originally used Alger's name because he lived in a house in the town as a teenager, but accusations of child sexual abuse forced fair organizers to part company with Alger."}

The first title was released for Sony's PlayStation. The \"Spyro\" series has become very popular since the first release and several sequels and spin offs. The \"Spyro\" series has sold more than 20 million units worldwide. The original \"Spyro\" series was restarted in 2006 with the release of the Legend of Spyro series. The series was rebooted again in 2011 when Skylanders was released. The first three games got a remake called Spyro Reignited Trilogy (2018).\nThe Original Series.\nConsole Games.\n\"Spyro the Dragon\" was released on the Playstation in 1998. It features Spyro, a small, purple dragon; his dragonfly companion, Sparx; and a multitude of fellow dragons. It takes place in the Dragon Realms, an imaginary fantasy world, which is itself divided in six worlds: Artisans, Peace Keepers, Magic Crafters, Beast Makers, Dream Weavers, and Gnasty's World. At the beginning of the game the main antagonist, Gnasty Gnorc (a half gnome, half orc hybrid), seeks revenge against the dragons for banishing him and traps them in stone. Spyro was out playing hooky and was spared from a crystal prison. The point of the game is to charge, fly, and flame your way through each world, defeating enemies, saving dragons, and eventually facing and taking down Gnasty.\n\"\" is the sequel to \"Spyro the Dragon.\" It was released on the Playstation in 1999.

It was founded in 1914 by J.B.M. Hertzog as a result of disagreements between him and the leaders of the South African Party, which he then was a member of. In 1948 its leader Daniel Francois Malan became Prime Minister of South Africa, and the party began instituting apartheid in South Africa. However, apartheid was only one among a variety of issues that helped bring the National Party to power. Most people who voted for the National Party in 1948 were voting more against the previous United Party led by Jan Smuts than for Malan's National Party. This was because of Smuts's support of the United Kingdom in the Second World War, and other issues that irritated Afrikaner voters such as the poverty of Afrikaners, the competition from native Africans for jobs, the urbanization of Afrikaner towns, and the threat of communism, which the Afrikaner voters generally felt Smuts had wrongly handled and felt that the problems were partially his fault. South African President FW de Klerk, the last South African government leader to belong to the party, disbanded apartheid in the 1990s and allowed all adults of all races to vote for the first time in 1994, which resulted in the National Party being voted out of office."}

It is in a partnership between NBC Universal and The Blackstone Group. The resort consists of two theme parks (Universal Studios Florida and Islands of Adventure), CityWalk (a nighttime entertainment destination), and three Loews hotels. CityWalk includes the 20 screen Loews Universal Cineplex, a lot of restaurants, shops, and clubs. There are eight restaurants, five entertainment areas and 11 shopping stores.\nUniversal Studios Florida.\nUniversal Studios Florida is one of the themes parks in Universal Orlando Resort. It includes rides and many shows.\nIslands of Adventure.\nIslands of Adventure is a theme park in Orlando, Florida. It opened in 1999 as an expansion to the Universal Orlando Resort and CityWalk areas. The park has six \"islands\", each having its own theme.\nThe Port of Entry is the area north of the entrance, positioned at the southernmost point of the park. It is primarily a shopping center, and has the feel of an Arabian bazaar. Its main feature is the Confisco Grille, a restaurant. Located next to the Port of Entry, Marvel Super Hero Island has rides similar to Marvel comic books. Its four rides are the Incredible Hulk Coaster, the only launched Bolliger and Mabillard roller coaster, The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man, a simulator ride set in New York, Doctor Doom's Fearfall, a vertically launched ride similar to Power Tower at Cedar Point in Ohio, and Storm Force Accelatron which is a faster version of the traditional Teacup ride.\nToon Lagoon contains mostly water rides and is themed after the cartoons found in the Sunday newspaper. These rides include Popeye &amp; Bluto's Bilge Rat Barges, a whitewater rapids ride, and Dudley Do-Right's Rip Saw Falls, a log flume with a 50 foot drop. Also here is Me Ship, The Olive, a kids play area. The Comic Strip Cafe and Wimpy's provide food here.\nSet in the time of Jurassic Park the movie, the only ride is Jurassic Park River Adventure. The Lost Continent has a theme of a lost medieval city. Dueling Dragons is an inverted roller coaster with two different tracks, Fire and Ice. Poseidon's Fury is a special effects show where you can explore Poseidon's underground tomb. Close by is The Eighth Voyage of Sindbad, a live action stunt show. Outside the entrance to this show is the mystical Talking Fountain which talks to, and soaks people who goes by it. Also in the Lost Continent is the Flying Unicorn, a roller coaster for children and The Enchanted Oak Tavern. Mythos is a casual sit-down restaurant at the entrance to the Continent.\nSeuss Landing is the only zone at Islands of Adventure for small children. It is based on the works of the author Dr. Seuss. It has several Seuss-themed rides including the Caro-Seuss-el, The Cat in the Hat Ride, and If I Ran the Zoo. It also features One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish and the Green Eggs and Ham Cafe.\nFormer Attractions.\nWhen the park opened, a boat ride, Island Skipper Tours, took park guests around the central lagoon of Islands of Adventure. It had stops in Port of Entry across from the Confisco Grille restaurant, and in Jurassic Park next to the Discovery Center. The ride was closed in 2002.\nOriginally Toon Lagoon featured a live show with cartoon characters. It was replaced in 2002 by a Dave Mirra-themed BMX stunt show. There used to be a Triceratops Encounter in Jurassic Park that featured a lifelike animatronic dinosaur.\nA ride that was supposed to open with the park in Seuss Landing was Sylvester McMonkey McBean's Incredible Driving Machines. This was similar to Pteranodon Flyers in Jurassic Park in that parents and children could ride together in cars that ran on an elevated track that toured Seuss Landing. They were never able to get the ride to work, and the supplier that made most of the components went bankrupt in 1999. The ride never opened, but the tracks are still at the park."}

It is named after \"The Truman Show\", a movie from 1998. In the movie, the main character discovers that he is living in a constructed reality that is shown on television. All people except the main character of the movie are paid actors. People with this disorder have delusions about being followed. The may also think that they are famous. As of 2012, there were over forty reported cases of this delusion, in the U.S and the United Kingdom. \nOne of the patients, an upper-middle class Army veteran who wanted to climb the Statue of Liberty in the belief that doing so would release him from the \"show\", described his condition this way:\nI realized that I was and am the center, the focus of attention by millions and millions of people ... My family and everyone I knew were and are actors in a script, a charade whose entire purpose is to make me the focus of the world's attention.\nThe choice of the name \"Truman Show Delusion\" by the Golds was influenced by the fact that three of the five patients Joel Gold initially treated for the syndrome explicitly linked their perceived experiences to the film.\nTruman Syndrome.\nIn the U.K., psychiatrists Paolo Fusar-Poli, Oliver Howes, Lucia Valmaggia and Philip McGuire of the Institute of Psychiatry in London described in the \"British Journal of Psychiatry\" what they referred to as the \"Truman Syndrome\":\n[A] preoccupying belief that the world had changed in some way that other people were aware of, which he interpreted as indicating he was the subject of a film and living in a film set (a \u2018fabricated world\u2019). This cluster of symptoms ... is a common presenting complaint in individuals ... who may be in the prodromal phase of schizophrenia.\nThe authors suggest that the \"Truman explanation\" is a result of the patients' search for meaning in their perception that the ordinary world has changed in some significant but inexplicable way."}

They can weigh as much as 3 or 400\u00a0kg (660880\u00a0lbs) and can grow to be 1.3 to 1.9\u00a0m (45.9\u00a0ft) long (accounts vary). They live, or lived (some species are recently extinct), in the Seychelles, the Mascarenes and the Galapagos. Today, the world's largest population lives on Aldabra Atoll in Seychelles, where there are about 150,000 individuals. Although looking similar, the tortoises represent separate branches of evolution. The Seychelles and Mascarenes tortoises came originally from nearby Madagascar, while the Galapagos tortoises came from nearby Ecuador. Their similarity is an example of convergent evolution.\nThese tortoises are capable of living over 100 years in the wild. This makes them the longest-living vertebrates. The longest living survivor is 182 years old (probably).\nThe Madagascar tortoise \"Tu'i Malila\" was 188 at death in Tonga in 1965. \"Harriet\" was reported by the Australia Zoo to be 176 years old when she died in 2006. Also, on 23 March 2006, an Aldabra giant tortoise named \"Adwaita\" died at Alipore Zoological Gardens in Kolkata. He was brought to the zoo in the 1870s from the estate of Lord Robert Clive. He was around 255 years old when he died.\nAround the time of its discovery, they were caught and killed for food in such large quantities that they became virtually extinct by 1900. Giant tortoises are now under strict conservation laws and are categorised as threatened species.\nDuring the 16th and 17th centuries, the Gal\u00e1pagos were frequented by buccaneers preying on Spanish treasure ships. Filling a ship's hold with tortoises was an easy way to stock up on food, a tradition that was continued by whalers in the centuries that followed. \"whaling skippers were almost lyrical in their praise of tortoise meat, terming it far more delicious than chicken, pork or beef\". They said the meat of the giant tortoise was \"succulent meat and the oil from their bodies as pure as butter, but best of all, the giants could hibernate in a ship\u2019s damp for a year or more\".\nAt least five species of the genus \"Cylindraspis\" have gone extinct in historic times. They lived in the Mascarene Islands (Mauritius, Rodrigues and R\u00e9union) in the Indian Ocean.\nGalapagos tortoise.\nThe Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise or Gal\u00e1pagos giant tortoise (\"Chelonoidis nigra\") is the biggest living species of tortoise and the 10th-heaviest living reptile.\nThe tortoise lives in seven of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. The island is a volcanic archipelago about 1,000\u00a0km (620\u00a0mi) west of the Ecuadorian mainland. Spanish explorers, who discovered the islands in the 16th century, named them after the Spanish \"gal\u00e1pago\", meaning tortoise.\nTheir shell size and shape are different between populations. On islands with humid highlands, the tortoises are larger, with domed shells and short necks. On islands with dry lowlands, the tortoises are smaller, with \"saddleback\" shells and long necks. Charles Darwin's observations of these differences on the second voyage of the Beagle in 1835, helped him to develop his theory of evolution.\nThe population of the Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise is getting smaller. There were over 250,000 individuals in the 16th century. In the 1970s, that number got smaller to around 3,000. The decline is believed to be caused by over-exploitation, habitat loss and introduced species to the islands such as rats, goats and pigs. Ten subspecies of the original fifteen survive in the wild. An eleventh subspecies (\"C. n. abingdoni\") had only a single known living individual. It was kept in captivity. \"Lonesome George\" died in June 2012.\nThere have been many conservation efforts. Because of this, thousands of captive-bred juveniles were released onto their home islands. As a result, the population grew to 19,000 at the start of the 21st century. However, the species is still classified as \"vulnerable\" by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).\nAldabra giant tortoise.\nThe main population of the Aldabra giant tortoise lives on the islands of the Aldabra Atoll in the Seychelles. The atoll has been protected from human influence and is home to some 100,000 giant tortoises, the world's largest population of the animal. Another isolated population of the species lives on the island of Changuu, near Zanzibar and other captive populations are in conservation parks in Mauritius and Rodrigues. The tortoises exploit many different kinds of habitat, including grasslands, low scrub, mangrove swamps, and coastal dunes.\nThe species is called \"Aldabrachelys gigantea\" or \"Dipsochelys dussumieri\". The names refer to the same tortoise."}

They do have legs but they are very small. Amphiumas can be up to long, their legs are only up to about . It is because of this that they are often mistaken for eels or snakes. They also do not have eyelids or a tongue. \nFemale amphiumas lay their eggs in wet mud. They then stay coiled around them for about five months, until they hatch. The larvae have external gills. After about four months these external gills disappear and the lungs begin to work. \nDistribution.\nAmphiumas live in the southeastern part of the United States. \nIn the past they have lived in more areas. Fossils from the Pleistocene time show that they once lived in Europe.\nBehavior.\nDuring the day amphiumas hide in plants. At night they become active and go hunting. Their prey include frogs, snakes, fish, crustaceans, insects and even other amphiumas. Hunting and eating habits are similar to that of the Axolotl. They suck food into their stomachs with vacuum force. They can become aggressive. \nSpecies.\nThere are three amphiuma species. They are different because of the number of toes:"}

It was invented by Richard James in 1943, and quickly became a bestseller. Other Slinky toys were developed such as the Slinky Dog and the Slinky Train. Company president Betty James has always kept the toy's price low so children could buy it. It originally sold for $1. Slinky has received many toy industry awards and honors over the years. Its television jingle is the longest running jingle in advertising history.\nOrigin.\nSlinky was the invention of Richard James, a mechanical engineer in the United States Navy. In 1943 he was looking for a way to lessen the vibrations that sensitive equipment endured shipboard in rough waters. An accident during his experiments led to the creation of a \"walking\", tumbling metal spring. Neighborhood children loved it. James's wife Betty named the toy Slinky after finding the word in a dictionary. The Jameses had 400 Slinkys made by a local machine shop. The Jameses put Slinky on display at Gimbels department store in Philadelphia in November 1945. All 400 units were sold.\nOther Slinky products.\nThe Jameses went into the Slinky business. They invented a machine that could produce a Slinky from 80 feet of steel wire within 10 seconds. A huge advertising campaign was launched in America. James showed television viewers how Slinky worked. Other Slinky toys manufactured during the 1950s were the Slinky Dog, Suzie the Slinky Worm, and a pair of eyeglasses with eyeballs dangling at the end of two Slinkys. Other companies were granted licenses to produce Slinky toys. \nThe Jameses divorced. Richard became a missionary in Bolivia. Betty James moved the company to Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania in 1964. She was president of the company from 1960 to 1998. She kept the price of Slinky low so all children could afford one. The original Slinky was $1. In 2008 Slinky cost about $4. She explained the toy's appeal by saying, \"It's the simplicity of it.\"\nSlinky Dog.\nVery early in the production history of Slinky, Helen Malsed of Washington developed ideas for Slinky pull toys. The company liked her ideas and added Slinky Dog and Slinky Train to their line in 1952. The Slinky Dog was a small plastic dog whose front and rear ends were joined by a Slinky. Malsed received annual sums of $60,000 to $70,000 per year for 17 years for her idea. \nSlinky Dog was reworked in 1995 for Pixar's \"Toy Story\". James Industries had dropped their Slinky Dog from production, but Betty James liked the new Slinky Dog. She said, \"[The earlier Slinky Dog] wasn't nearly as cute as this one.\" The dog's front and rear ends were made in China, and the Dog put together and packaged in America. The entire run of 825,000 new Slinky Dogs sold out well before Christmas 1995.\nJingle.\nThe first Slinky television commercial was shown on Miss Patty's Romper Room in 1946. Homer Fesperman and Charles Weagley wrote the Slinky television jingle in 1962. In \"Timeless Toys\", Tim Walsh writes that this jingle is the longest running jingle in advertising history. In 1990 \"USA Today\" reported that 90 percent of all adults surveyed knew the Slinky jingle. \nAwards and honors.\nSlinky is a part of the Smithsonian Institution's permanent Americana exhibition. In 1999 the United States Postal Service issued a Slinky postage stamp. Slinky joined the Toy Hall of Fame in 2000. A bill to nominate the Slinky as the state toy of Pennsylvania was introduced in 2001, but not enacted. The same year, Betty James was inducted into the Toy Industry Association's Hall of Fame. In 2003, Slinky was named to the Toy Industry Association's \"Century of Toys List\", a roll call of the 100 most memorable and most creative toys of the twentieth century. \"Orange Coast Magazine\" writes, \"[T]he original machines designed and engineered by [James] turn 80 feet of steel wire into a coil in only 10 seconds. Since its introduction, more than 250 million Slinkys have been sold, enough for every person in the United States to have one. Stretched out, the wire would encircle the planet more than 126 times.\""}

They are among the most widespread of the anglerfish, found in all oceans from the tropics to the Antarctic.\nThe females are large: females of the largest species, Kr\u00f8yer's deep sea angler fish, \"Ceratias holboelli\", reach in length. Males, on the other hand, are dwarfed, only maximum. When these fish were first studied, the males were mistaken for parasites. Females usually have more than one male attached to them, which is a good example of polyandry.\nAt birth, tiny male ceratiids already have extremely well-developed olfactory organs that detect scents in the water. The male lives solely to find and mate with a female. They are significantly smaller than a female angler fish, and may have trouble finding food in the deep sea. Furthermore, the growth of the gut may stop in some species, preventing them from feeding at all. This means the male must find a female quickly to prevent death. The sensitive olfactory organs help the male detect the pheromones from female anglerfish.\nWhen the male finds a female, he bites into her skin, and releases an enzyme. The enzyme digests the skin of his mouth and her body, fusing the pair down to the blood-vessel level. The male then slowly wastes away, first losing his digestive organs, then his brain, heart, and eyes, and ends as nothing more than a pair of gonads. The gonads release sperm in response to hormones in the female's bloodstream. This extreme sexual dimorphism makes sure that, when the female is ready to spawn, she has a mate right there. Multiple males can be incorporated into a single female.\nCeratiids are the only animals known to become chimaeras as a normal part of their life-cycle."}

When, on the other hand, the genetically distinct cell types originate from the same zygote, the organism is called a mosaic.\nDispermic chimaeras are formed from at least two fertilized eggs or early embryos fused together. Each population of cells keeps its own phenotype and the resulting organism is a mixture of the two phenotypes.\nMicrochimerism is a form of chimerism in which a host harbors a small set of genetically distinct cells. This often happens with blood transfusion or transplants, but also during pregnancy due to the two-way cell trafficking between the mother and the foetus.\nRecently, epigenetic chimeras have been discovered in mouse models.\nGermline chimerism.\nGermline chimerism occurs when the germ cells (for example, sperm and egg cells) of an organism are not genetically identical to its own.\nMarmosets almost always give birth to fraternal twins.

The foam is laid above a water source, so the tadpoles fall into the water once they hatch.\nThe species in this family vary in size, from to . Like other arboreal frogs, they have toe discs. This family has the Old World flying frogs, including Wallace's flying frogs(\"Rhacophorus nigropalmatus\"). These frogs have extensive webbing between their hands and feet. This lets them glide through the air."}

Its SI unit is m/s2. Acceleration due to gravity is a vector, which means it has both a magnitude and a direction. The acceleration due to gravity at the surface of Earth is represented by the letter \"g\". It has a standard value defined as . However, the actual acceleration of a body in free fall varies with location.\nWhy heavier objects do not fall faster than lighter objects.\nIsaac Newton worked out that resultant force equals mass times acceleration, or in symbols, formula_1. This can be re-arranged to give formula_2.\nThe bigger the mass of the falling object, the greater the force of gravitational attraction pulling it towards Earth. In the equation above, this is formula_3. However, the amount of times the force gets bigger or smaller is equal to the number of times the mass gets bigger or smaller, having the ratio remain constant. In every situation, the formula_4 cancels down to the uniform acceleration of around 9.8\u00a0m/s2. This means that, regardless of their mass, all freely falling objects accelerate at the same rate.\nConsider the following examples:\nformula_5\nformula_6\nSurface acceleration.\nDepending on the location, an object at the surface of Earth falls with an acceleration between .\nEarth is not exactly spherical. It is similar to a \"squashed\" sphere, with the radius at the equator slightly larger than the radius at the poles. This has the effect of slightly increasing gravitational acceleration at the poles (since we are close to the centre of Earth and the gravitational force depends on distance) and slightly decreasing it at the equator. Also, because of centripetal acceleration, the acceleration due to gravity is slightly less at the equator than at the poles. Changes in the density of rock under the ground or the presence of mountains nearby can affect gravitational acceleration slightly.\nAltitude.\nThe acceleration of an object changes with altitude. The change in gravitational acceleration with distance from the centre of Earth follows an inverse-square law. This means that gravitational acceleration is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the centre of Earth. As the distance is doubled, the gravitational acceleration decreases by a factor of 4. As the distance is tripled, the gravitational acceleration decreases by a factor of 9, and so on.\nAt the surface of the Earth, the acceleration due to gravity is roughly . The average distance to the centre of the Earth is .\nUsing the constant formula_10, we can work out gravitational acceleration at a certain altitude.\nExample: Find the acceleration due to gravity above Earth's surface.\n\u2234 Distance from centre of Earth is .\n\u2234 Acceleration due to gravity above Earth's surface is .\nGravitational acceleration at the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line, the boundary between Earth's atmosphere and outer space which lies at an altitude of , is only about 3% lower than at sea level."}

They live in the northernmost Atlantic Ocean and parts of the Arctic Ocean. It now belongs to the monotypic genus \"Pagophilus\". Its scientific name, \"Pagophilus groenlandicus\", means \"ice-lover from Greenland\".\nDescription.\nThe harp seal has a black face with silvery-gray body. Its eyes are pure black. It has black harp or wishbone-shaped markings on the back. They show little sexual dimorphism. This means there is little difference between the males and females. The baby harp seal (pup) has a yellow-white coat at birth. After three days, the coat turns white and stays white for about 12 days. Adult harp seals grow up to be 1.7 to 2.0 m (5 to 6 feet) long and weigh from 140 to 190\u00a0kg (300 to 400 pounds).\nHarp seals like to swim in the ocean. They spend little time on land. They are very social animals. They can be very noisy, as well. They will form large colonies where they spend a great deal of time. Many harp seals are able to live up to 30 years in the wild.\nOn the ice, pups call their mothers by \"bawling\" and \"mumble\" while playing with others. Adults \"growl\" and \"warble\" to warn off others. Underwater, adults use more than 19 call types during courting and mating.\nReproduction.\nFemales mature sexually at age five to six. Then each year, they bear one pup. This is usually in late February.\nNewborn pups weigh around and are long. After birth, the mother only feeds that pup. During the 12 day nursing period, the mother does not eat. She loses up to per day. Harp seal milk has up to 48% fat, so pups gain over per day.\nWeaning is sudden. The mother turns from nursing to promiscuous mating. She leaves the pup behind on the ice. While courtship starts on the ice, mating usually takes place in the water.\nPups are unable to swim or find food until seven to eight weeks old or until the ice melts. This leaves them open to polar bears and other predators. Because they cannot eat, they lose up to 50% of their weight. As many as 30% of pups die during their first year."}

They live in the Arctic and sub-Arctic areas. The ringed seal is a small seal. They are rarely greater than 1.5 m in length. \nThey have a distinctive patterning of dark spots surrounded by light grey rings. It is the most abundant and wide-ranging ice seal in the northern hemisphere. The live throughout the Arctic Ocean, into the Bering Sea and Okhotsk Sea as far south as the northern coast of Japan in the Pacific, and throughout the North Atlantic coasts of Greenland and Scandinavia as far south as Newfoundland, and include two freshwater subspecies in northern Europe. Ringed seals are one of the main prey of polar bears. They have long been a part of the diet of indigenous people of the Arctic.\nDescription.\nThe ringed seal is the smallest and most common seal in the Arctic. They have a small head, short cat-like snout, and a plump body. Their coat is dark with silver rings on their back and sides with a silver belly. Depending on subspecies and condition, adult size can range from 100 to 175 cm (40-69 in) and weigh from 32 to 140 kg (70-308 lbs). The seal averages about 5\u00a0ft (1.5 m) long with a weight of about 50\u201370\u00a0kg (110-150\u00a0lbs). Their small front flippers have claws more than 1\u00a0inch (2.5\u00a0cm) thick that are used to make breathing holes through 6.5\u00a0ft (2 m) thick ice.\nRange and habitat.\nRinged seals live throughout the Arctic Ocean. They can be found in the Baltic Sea, the Bering Sea and the Hudson Bay. They like to rest on ice floe and will move farther north for denser ice. One subspecies can be found in freshwater.\nLife history.\nFemales reach sexual maturity at 4 years. Males do not reach maturity until 7 years old. During the spring breeding season, females make lairs in the thick ice and give birth in these structures. Females give birth to a single pup in March or April after a 9 month gestation period. Pups are weaned after one month. They build up a thick layer of blubber.\nFemales usually begin mating in late April. Males will roam the ice for a mate. When found, the male and female may spend several days together before mating. Then the male looks for another mate.\nRinged seals live about 25 to 30 years. They are solitary animals. They separate themselves from each other by hundreds of yards.\nDiet.\nRinged seals eat a wide variety of small prey. They eat 72 species of fish and invertebrates. Their prey of choice includes mysids, shrimp, arctic cod, and herring. While feeding, ringed seals dive to depths of 35 to 150\u00a0ft (10\u201345 m). In the summer ringed seals feed along edge of the sea-ice for polar cod. In shallow water they feed on smaller cod. Ringed seals may also eat herring, smelt, whitefish, sculpin, perch, and crustaceans.\nPredators.\nRinged seal are an important food item in particular for polar bears. During the pupping season, arctic fox and glaucous gulls take ringed seal pups born outside lairs. Killer whales, Greenland sharks and occasionally Atlantic walruses prey upon them in the water.\nReferences.\nThis article has public domain work of the United States Government from references."}

Also published in the same issue was Alger's poem \"Friar Anselmo\". \"Brave and Bold\" was then published in book form by A. K. Loring of Boston in 1873. The story was serialized in \"Reader\", an English magazine, in 1872, and was one of Alger's few stories to be so published.\nAlger had lost some of his steam as the 1870s approached. He had made his literary name in exposing the horrors of life for street children in books such as \"Ragged Dick\" (1866). As the years passed, the government had taken on these horrors, studies were being conducted, and the plight of street children was being relieved. As a result, Alger was left without a literary subject. Boys' tastes were changing. They knew everything they needed to know about street boys from Alger's many novels about the poor. They wanted cowboys and Indians. Alger's publisher and his editor urged him ramp up the excitement in his books. Alger agreed, but let it be known that his moralizing would remain at its usual high level.\n\"Brave and Bold\" was the first in a new series of Alger novels published by Loring, and the first in which sex rears its head. Before \"Brave and Bold\", the girls of the hero's age were sisters or simply prop figures. In this new book, Hester Paine, the lovely daughter of Millville's most prominent citizen and the reigning village belle, becomes a source of fascination and contention for \"factory boy\" hero Robert Rushton and his nemesis, the rich, snobbish, kid glove-wearing youth Halbert Davis.\n\"Brave and Bold\" hit a new high in Alger's work, according Edwin Hoyt, but Hoyt describes the story as a \"fiasco\". Gary Scharnhorst describes it as \"horrifying\", and lists a shooting, a stabbing, and a suicide among the book's elements. The book was reviewed by a reader of the children's magazine \"St. Nicholas\"; he described it as \"of the sensational order\" and was glad he did not meet its characters in real life. This was the last review of an Alger work published by the prestigious magazine. The book initiated the controversy over making Alger's works available to the young."}

Carthage was a city in the country now known as Tunisia. Dido lived in the 9th century BC (about 3000 years ago). Some parts of her life may be true. Other parts are myths. She is best known from the story about her in the \"Aeneid\" by the Roman poet Virgil. In some writings about her, she is called Alyssa or Elissa. She was also worshipped as a goddess in ancient Carthage.\nEarly stories about her life.\nThe oldest story about Dido was written by Timaeus. He was an ancient Greek historian who lived in the 3rd century BC. One hundred years later, a Roman historian, Pompeius Trogus, wrote about her. His story about her is now lost, but a later Roman historian, Justin, wrote a summary of Trogus' story. In the stories by Timaeus and Trogus, Dido was the daughter of the King of Tyre (a city in the country now known as Lebanon). She was married to Acerbas who was a priest of Hercules. When Dido's brother Pygmalion killed Acerbas, Dido ran away. She took some of her people with her. They went first to Cyprus, and then to the north coast of Africa in the place now known as Tunisia.\nWhen they got to Africa, Dido asked the Berber ruler, a man named Iarbus, if she could buy some land to for her people to start a city. He said that she could buy as much land as she could cover with the skin of a dead ox. She told her people to cut the skin into very thin strips. They laid all the strips out to mark the borders. This gave them a very big piece of land. Dido and her people built a city on the land. The city was named Carthage, and Dido was its first queen. Carthage grew and became a very rich city. Many Berbers also went to live there.\nWhen he saw what a rich city Carthage was, Iarbus wanted to marry Dido. He told her that if she did not marry him, he would make war on Carthage. Dido did not want to marry Iarbus. She still loved her husband . Before her wedding to Iarbus, she built a large fire. She told him that the fire was a ceremony to honor Acerbas. She said that when the ceremony was finished, Iarbus would be her new husband. Instead, she climbed onto the pyre where the fire was burning. Then she killed herself with a sword. After she died, the people of Carthage worshipped her as a goddess. Carthage stayed a very rich and powerful city for 600 years. It was destroyed by Rome in 146 BC.\nAeneas and Dido.\nDido is most well known today for the story told about her in Books 3 and 4 of Virgil's \"Aeneid\". Virgil's story about the early life of Dido is very like those told by Timaeus and Trogus. But his story of how she died is very different. In Virgil's story, Aeneas, a prince from the ancient city of Troy, goes to Carthage after losing a war against the Greeks (the Trojan War). Aeneas and Dido fall in love. Aeneas decides to stay in Carthage with Dido. But the god Jupiter sends Mercury to tell Aeneas that he must leave Carthage and go to Italy. Aeneas does not want to go, but knows he must do what Jupiter asks. He and his men sail away from Carthage. Dido is very sad and very angry. She builds a large fire to burn all the things that belonged to Aeneas. Then she climbs to the top of the fire and kills herself with the sword that she gave Aeneas when he first came to Carthage.\nMost people say that Virgil was the first writer to make up the story about Aeneas and Dido. Others think that he got the idea from a long poem by Gnaeus Naevius called \"\" (\"The Punic Wars\"). Most of Naevius's poem is lost, so it is hard to know for sure.\nSince Virgil's time, many plays and operas have been written about his story of Aeneas and Dido. Christopher Marlowe wrote a play about them in 1583. It was called \"Dido Queen of Carthage\". Henry Purcell composed an opera about them in 1688 called \"Dido and Aeneas\".\nThe Italian poet Pietro Metastasio also used Virgil's story for a libretto (the story and words for an opera). It was called \"\". (Its title means \"Dido \" in Italian.) The first opera to use Metastasio's libretto was composed by Domenico Sarro in 1724. In the next 100 years more than 40 operas by other composers used this libretto."}

He, his wife and his children were later caught up in the 1937 deportation of the \"Koryo-saram\" to Central Asia. Anita's mother was born in 1944 in Tashkent, Uzbek SSR, Soviet Union. She successfully graduated from the Moscow State University and became a chemistry doctor.\nShe did everything she could to make her daughter educated in all kinds of arts . Anita's favourite one became music. She began violin lessons at a young age; she later studied piano, flute, and guitar. She wasn't a loved one at school. Many classmates, being children of influential parents, often abused her. Most teachers were not as friendly to her as they were to the other classmates.\nWhen she became an adult, a tragedy happened: her mother was branded a \"class enemy\" in the 1970s in response to her record of speaking out in support of Nobel Peace Prize-winning dissident Andrei Sakharov. For her dissent she was briefly committed to a mental institution. She became a permanent invalid. After leaving school Anita attended the teacher training college, then law school at Moscow State University, where she met her husband Sergey P. Tsoy.\nCareer.\nAfter graduation, rather than becoming a teacher or lawyer, she began saving up money in order to launch a singing career, while her husband began working as a press secretary for Moscow mayor Yury Luzhkov in 1994. Her first album \"Polyot\" (\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0451\u0442; \"Flight\") was released in 1997; she kept it a secret from her husband until after she had already signed the contract with her production company.\nIn 1998 her second album, named \"\u0427\u0435\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043b\u0435\u0431\u0435\u0434\u044c\" (\"The Black Swan\") was released and in 1999 a concert show \"\u0427\u0435\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043b\u0435\u0431\u0435\u0434\u044c \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0445\u0440\u0430\u043c \u043b\u044e\u0431\u0432\u0438\" (\"The Black Swan or a Love Palace\") was held in the concert hall \"Rossiya\". This show was accepted as \"Best Show of the Year\" and Anita won an \"Ovation\" She went to the United States in 2003 to record an English-language album, where she worked with cinematic composer Lee Holdridge; while there, she was offered a five-year contract as a solo vocalist in the Cirque du Soleil, but turned it down in order to return to Russia and be near her family.\nShe records her third Russian dance solo-album \"1000000 \u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\u0442\" (\"1000000 Minutes\") in 2003, which was introduced to public in the \"Elevator\" club, a former factory in Moscow. In 2005 a major show-concert \"ANITA\" was held in the \"Rossiya\" Concert Hall, Moscow, featuring high technology decorations like large LCD-screens and fountains on the stage. The show was considered to be one of the most successful ones in Russia and was released on DVD by Universal Music.\nAnita Tsoy records her fourth album \"\u041d\u0430 \u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043a\" (\"To The East\") in 2007 and changed her image greatly since the 2003; she turns to manga-anime style. In autumn of the same year she performs with her \"To The East\" show, which attracted more than ten thousand people. Following the show, the DVD-recording of this live concert was released.\nBoth \"ANITA\" and \"To The East\" shows are considered to be one of the best live-performances in Russia and the recordings of these concerts were shown on Channel One, Muz-TV and other influentable Russian channels.\nAnita recorded 5 albums in total and won more than 10 major awards for both performing and charity during her 13-year career as a solo artist.\nAlbums.\nThis information was received from the singer's official site.\nLive Concerts.\nThis information was received from the singer's official site."}

{"id": "360044", "revid": "68157", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=360044", "title": "Rigidly rotating disk paradox", "text": "In theoretical physics, a branch of physics, the rigidly rotating disk paradox, sometimes called the Ehrenfest paradox, is a paradox concerning a rotating disk. Basically, the paradox says that when a disk (or any circular object in general) is rotated, it will have a smaller circumference than 2\u03c0r, because the radius will remain the same, but the circumference is shortened due to the Lorentz contraction. For a more detailed explanation, see below.\nDefinition(s).\nMathematical definition.\nIf the rotating disk has an angular velocity of \"\u03c9\", and a radius of \"R\", then the circumference of the disk is \"\u03c9\"\u00b7R. So the circumference will undergo a Lorentz contraction of \nformula_1. However, the radius, R, will not undergo a Lorentz contraction since it is perpendicular to the direction of motion.\nTherefore, the circumference divided by the diameter will end up being a little bit less than formula_2.\nAlternate explanation.\nThe simpler definition is given by the following. To an observer \"X\" riding on the edge of the rotating disk, the effects of high-speed motion are still in place. So, if \"X\" were to crawl along the circumference with a ruler and measure the circumference, his ruler will be shortened (due to the Lorentz contraction) and he will have to lay out his ruler \"more times\" to measure the circumference. Therefore, he will measure the circumference to be \"greater\" than he would measure it to be if the disk were stationary.\nIf an observer \"Y\" were to sit on the radius of the rotating disk, he will measure the radius to be the same as he would measure it to be if the disk were stationary, since the radius is not affected by the Lorentz contraction (the radius is perpendicular to the direction of motion). Therefore, when observers \"X\" and \"Y\" compare their measurements, they find that\nformula_3\nIn verbal terms this means \"The circumference is greater than 2\u03c0 times the radius\". So, the circumference and the radius are not proportional by 2\u03c0 in this case.\nExplanation for the paradox.\nIn differential geometry, there exists a certain type of mathematical plane called a hyperbolic plane. In it, if you draw a normal circle, the radius will remain the same, but the circumference will be greater than 2\u03c0r. Physicists began to realize that the accelerated angular motion of the disk caused a curvature in spacetime, therefore distorting the normal flat geometric plane, causing the circumference to be greater than 2\u03c0r.\nUnderlying this explanation is the fact that Euclidean geometry is not the actual geometry of space, but an approximation which works well at the level of human life.\nRelation to gravity.\nUsing an ingenious argument concerning the equivalence principle, Albert Einstein showed that the curvature in spacetime caused by the rotated disk could be a logical explanation for gravity. For more information on this topic, see Gravity and the rotating disk."}

The word \"pyre\" comes from the Greek word for \"fire\". Pyres are built outdoors. They are usually made from wood. The body is placed on top of the pyre or under it. Then the pyre is set on fire. Pyres are still used for funerals in some parts of the world. They are also used for other types of ceremonies. In those ceremonies, there is a big fire, but a body is not burned. Historically, pyres have also been used to kill people by burning them alive.\nPyres used for funerals.\nThe Hindu, Sikh, and Buddhist religions still use pyres for the cremation of dead people. This form of funeral is thousands of years old. However, it is no longer legal in many countries. The ancient Greeks and ancient Romans used funeral pyres. The Vikings also used them. Viking funeral pyres were usually built on boats floating in the sea.\nOther uses for pyres.\nPeople sometimes use pyres to make a big fire or bonfire but they do not burn a real body. These types of pyres are used for celebrations or to remember a person or a special event. Pyres are often used in Guy Fawkes Night celebrations in the United Kingdom and some Commonwealth countries. In Denmark and Germany people light pyres to celebrate the summer solstice (the longest day of the year). People light pyres in Switzerland to celebrate their National Day.\nFarmers sometimes use pyres to destroy the bodies of dead animals. They especially use them when the animals have died of a disease. This helps prevent the spread of the disease to other animals.\nIn the past, pyres were sometimes used to execute people. The people were burned while they were still alive. Often the person was tied to a stake (a very big stick) on top of the pyre. This type of execution was known as \"burning at the stake\". Joan of Arc died in this way."}

Onam is the official state festival of Kerala. It is celebrated with joy and enthusiasm all over the state by Malayalees regardless of religion, caste or creed. According to a popular legend, the festival is celebrated to welcome King Mahabali, whose spirit is said to visit Kerala in the time of Onam. \nOnam is a 10 day long festival celebrated in the beginning of the month of Chingam, the first month of the Malayalam Calendar (Kollavarsham). This corresponds with the month of August to September according to the Gregorian Calendar. Of the 10 days, the first day, Atham and tenth day, Thiruvonam are most important of all.\nOrigin.\nThe legend is of King Mahabali (popularly known as Maveli), a mythical king who ruled over Kerala. He was greatly respected in his kingdom and was considered to be wise, and extremely generous. Everybody was happy in His kingdom. There was no discrimination on the basis of caste or class. Rich and poor were treated equally. There was neither crime, nor corruption. Due to his popularity, the Gods became extremely concerned and jealous. They felt threatened and decided to end his reign. They asked Lord Vishnu to go to earth in the form of a dwarf Brahmin.Disguised as Vamana, Vishnu requested Mahabali for 3 feet of land. Kind Mahabali granted him the land, Vamana began to expand and eventually increased himself to the size of cosmic proportions. With his first step, the Brahmin boy covered the whole of earth and with the other step he covered the whole of the skies. He then asked the King where is the space for him to keep the third foot. King Mahabali with folded hands bowed before Vamana and asked him to place his last step on his head so that he could keep the promise. The brahmin placed his foot on the head of the King and trampled Mahabali to the netherworld. There, the King requested Lord Vishnu to be allowed to visit his land and people once a year, and Vishnu granted him his wish. It is the day of the visit of King Mahabali to Kerala that is celebrated as Onam every year. The orgin of Onam is beliefs from the Thrikakara Vamana Moorthi Temple in Ernakulam district of Kerala.\nCelebration.\nElaborate feasts known as sadhya, folk songs, elegant dances, energetic games, elephants, boat race (Vallam Kali) and concentric floral decorations (Athapookkalam) are all part of this dynamic festival. Malayalees make all the efforts to celebrate the festival in a grand way and impress their beloved King that they are happy and to wish him well. People buy new clothes and sweets during the celebration of Onam. Popularity and presentation of rich culture of the state during the festival made Onam the official State Festival of Kerala in 1961.\nTourism.\nThe government promotes Onam internationally in a big way and celebrates 'Tourist Week' for Kerala during Onam celebrations. Thousands of domestic and foreign tourists visit Kerala to be a part of Onam every year."}

It can be found in tropical waters, including Hawaii, the Gulf of Mexico, off the coast of west Africa, Oceania, and the Indian Ocean.\nDescription.\nSpotted eagle rays are around 17 to 35\u00a0cm wide at birth, but adults can be as long as 16\u00a0ft (5 meters), and have the wingspan of 3 meters (10\u00a0ft). An adult weighs 180 to 225\u00a0kg. The heaviest ever recorded weighed 230\u00a0kg. They have flat disk-shaped bodies, the top is dark blue or black in colour and is covered in white spots, and the belly is white. Spotted eagle rays also have flat snouts which look like a duck's bill. \nThey have a long tail which is longer than most other ray's tails, and they have 2-6 venomous spines right behind their pelvic fins.\nBehaviour.\nSpotted eagle rays prefer to swim in waters with the temperature of 24 to 27 \u00b0C (75 to 81 \u00b0F), and are more active during high tides. They are shy animals and usually avoid humans, but they have been seen leaping out of the water onto boats and landing on people. They search for their food by digging their snouts into the sand on the sea beds. Groups of them are made up of around 6 members swimming in the same direction, at exactly the same speed.\nSpotted eagle rays eat crustaceans including shrimp, prawns and crabs, molluscs like octopuses, clams and oysters.\nReproduction.\nSpotted eagle rays are viviparous, meaning they give live birth. Females are pregnant for around 1 year before giving birth to about 2-4 young which are 17 to 35\u00a0cm long. Spotted eagle rays mature at the age of 4 to 6 years old. Spotted Eagle Rays live for around 15\u201320 years.\nPredators.\nThe predators of the spotted eagle ray are mainly sharks like the tiger shark, the lemon shark, the bull shark, the great hammerhead shark, and the silvertip shark. These sharks are known to follow female spotted eagle rays during the breeding season and eat the newborn babies.\nWhere they live.\nSpotted eagle rays live in shallow, coastal waters and coral reefs in tropical regions, including Hawaii, the Gulf of Mexico, Oceania, west Africa, the Indian Ocean and the west coast of the United States of America. They are found down to the depths of 80 meters. They can be found in the Atlantic Ocean, off the coast of North Carolina, down to Florida, in the Gulf Stream, in the Caribbean, and down pass the southern part of Brazil. In can also be found in the Pacific Ocean, from the Red Sea to South Africa, and northern Japan and Australia.\nOther names.\nThe spotted eagle ray is also called the \"\"White-spotted eagle eay\", the \"bonnet skate\", the \"Bonnet ray\", the \"Duck-billed ray\", and the \"Spotted Duck-billed ray\"\"."}

{"id": "360774", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=360774", "title": "Vietnamese alphabet", "text": "The Vietnamese alphabet (c\"h\u1eef Qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef\" in Vietnamese) is a version of the Latin alphabet used to write the Vietnamese language. It uses all of the letters of the ISO Basic Latin Alphabet except for F, J, W, and Z (which are only found in loanwords). However, the alphabet has been changed heavily in order to accurately show Vietnamese pronunciation. Some letters and digraphs make very different sounds than what most readers of the Latin alphabet expect, such as D, R, and GI. One letter has been added, \u0110, to show it is a completely different sound from D. Vowel markers are added in order to distinguish different vowel sounds like A, \u00c2, and \u01cd. Tone markers are also added, because Vietnamese is a tonal language, such as \u00c1, \u1ea2, \u00c3, \u1ea0, and \u00c0. Some vowels have both a vowel marker and a tone marker. For example, the vowel \u01cd can be written as \u1eae, \u1eb2, \u1eb4, \u1eb6, and \u1eb0. Sometimes, even non-speakers of Vietnamese can tell something is written in Vietnamese simply based on how many markings a word can have.\nHistory.\nUnlike many other Asian languages that are mainly written using an Asian-made writing system, Vietnamese is mainly written using the Latin alphabet, which came from Europe. Before the Vietnamese used the Latin alphabet, they used a writing system based on the Chinese character system called \"ch\u1eef n\u00f4m\". Chinese loanwords were written the same as they were in Chinese, but thousands more characters were invented write native Vietnamese words. Due to the amount of time it took to learn the system, the literacy rate in Vietnam was low when this system was used.\nIn the 17th century, Portuguese Catholic missionaries created a writing system based on their own Latin alphabet to translate Vietnamese and to make it easier to learn for Europeans. When Vietnam first became a French colony, the Vietnamese alphabet and 'ch\u1eef n\u00f4m' were used alongside each other. Today, however, only the Vietnamese alphabet is used in Vietnam, and very few Vietnamese can read 'ch\u1eef n\u00f4m.'\nLetters of the alphabet.\nVietnamese characters.\nHere is the total set of characters for the lowercase letters:\nThe little \u20ab is just the Dong (Dollar) sign - most people just write VND for Vietnamese Dong - the currency of Vietnam.\nThis makes the useful alphabet 89+ letters.\nI.e.\nThis letter is a word: '\u1edf, it means \"at\" (or \"where\", \"place\").\nThe Latin alphabet.\nThe main letters from the Latin alphabet:\na, b, c, d, e, g, h, i, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, x, y, qu\nThe first set of changed letters.\n\u00f4, \u01a1, \u00e2, \u0103, \u00ea, \u01b0, d\nThis changed set of characters makes new alphabet letters for use in the Vietnamese language. They are an extension to the set of Latin characters already used. English doesn't extend the alphabet. English just uses the same written characters over again, to denote different (letter) sounds. For example: ape, angry, all, art, aorta, and apple. For the Vietnamese language, sounds are split up with their own letter/character changes.\nNote: i and y are essentially the same vowel (and may be exchanged in some situations)\nThe school alphabet.\nThe alphabet is taught in Vietnam's schools with these letters\na, b, c, d, e, g, h, i, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, x, y - \u00f4, \u01a1, \u00e2, \u0103, \u00ea, \u01b0, \u0111 \nVietnamese schools teach the alphabet with these 29 letters. The total number of possible letters is much higher if diacritical marks are added.\nThe F, J, W, Z are not used in native Vietnamese words. Only loanwords borrowed from other languages use these letters.\nMaking the vowel sounds.\nThese are the tone rules for vowels with different sounds. It's like music where only the correct sound can come from the instrument. It doesn't matter which instrument, as long as the sound follows the rules.\n \nNote: This is a spoken language so musical pitch or lilt is not the most changed sound quality. Different voices have different musical pitches. What the speaker will change is the intensity, and time given to the sound parts for each letter (or word). If a speaker uses strong pitch changes, it will probably be for pronunciation.\nTreatment of the Alphabet.\nSounds similar to letters.\nBefore, the alphabet was arranged from 'a to z' by foreign dictionaries, it included two letter sounds. The letters are like two letter sounds in English. 'Ch' in mechanic, or Christmas are good examples. In Viet characters the 'j'(jeh) sound has an equal (sound) that is written as 'tr'(jeh). Letters like 'Tr' used to be in every dictionary's order right in between the other alphabet letters. Another sound is 'ph'. 'Ph' is very famous - it's used in 'ph\u1edf' the most famous Vietnamese soup in the world. 'Ph' is an 'f' sound, just like in English - 'phone'. \nIn addition to the normal alphabet consonants, there are nine possible double-letters and one triple-letter.\nThe syllables.\nBecause of a relationship with East Asian languages (Japanese,Chinese etc.) the Vietnamese words can be moved around in their order. The reversal of the syllable-words moves them to another position in the dictionary. Also, the syllable-words can be held behind different syllable-words - like the articles in English. It's best to use a computer query to find them.\nThe alphabet in daily life.\nYoung Vietnamese learners will spend a lot of time with this alphabet. Correction is very common. The need for correction is used in many comedies about uneducated people. Comedies about foreigners are becoming very common too. \nThe reason for all the attention is how quickly the meaning will change. To say \"I have a sore head, somewhere\" (\"\u0111\u1ea7u c\u1ee7a t\u00f4i l\u00e0 \u0111au \u0111\u00e2u!\" in Vietnamese) is nearly impossible for (foreign) learners on their first day. A learner will only hear 'dow, dow dow' or 'dough, dough, dough' or 'dow, dough, dough' which does not help when listening. The same problem can be stated in English - 'four forks for foreigners' foreheads forthwith!' \nEach word in Vietnamese can be identical to another word, except for the sounds/tones/letter-changes. The sound is also identical to the ears of English speakers that allow for expression (sound changes) still. \nSee: Vietnam Eyes lesson on YouTube\nForeign characters/letters.\nFrom English.\nThe world includes Vietnam! So, the other letters 'j, f, w and z' are now OK to use in many places - on billboards, posters, T-shirts... But, if you work for any type of Vietnamese authority or association, then limit their use until the authority declares them as acceptable letters. But, the other alphabets that are used in English might not be accepted. For example: the Greek alphabet is very useful for English speakers - but in Vietnam it can lack meaning - it would be a decoration for the general population. Educated people will know more letters from the Greek alphabet.\nFrom Chinese.\nVietnamese used to be written in Chinese characters. A variety for Vietnamese is used in traditional culture. Many Chinese speakers find Vietnamese easy to grasp. The combination of two words is very common to Chinese. Example: phat am, Hong Kong/Xiong Gong etc. .\nCombined characters.\n'Diphthongs' are the next most important step to understanding the use of Vietnamese letters. The combination of toned vowels as \"dipthongs\" and \"triphthongs\" makes the Vietnamese language very fast. Some phrases can be spoken clearly without a strong clarity from consonants. It's very hard for English speakers to follow the combinations of sounds, especially vowels.\nNorthern vs. southern accent.\nThere are many differences between northern and southern dialects of Vietnamese. Hanoi is the standard for northern dialects and Saigon is the standard for southern dialects.\nDifferences in pronunciation include\nThe alphabet in computers.\nThe Vietnamese keyboard is always virtual (in software). Nobody can buy a computer keyboard for Vietnamese, in Vietnam. The common QWERTY keyboard is used in Vietnam. Software programs for Vietnamese characters are very common.\nOn a webpage.\nThe webpage is usually set to include the UTF-8 standard when using the Vietnamese alphabet. If the design of the characters is strange the designer of a web-page will set the font to plain \"Arial\". Some special fonts have been made for Vietnamese alphabets.\nJavascript codes.\n&lt;script type=\"text/javascript\"&gt;\ndocument.write(\"\\ta\"+\"\\tb\"+\"\\tc\"+\"\\td\"+\"\\te\"+\"\\tg\"+\"\\th\"+\"\\ti\"+\"\\tk\"\n+\"\\tl\"+\"\\tm\"+\"\\tn\"+\"\\to\"+\"\\tp\"+\"\\tq\"+\"\\tr\"+\"\\ts\"+\"\\tt\"+\"\\tu\"+\"\\tv\"+\"\\tx\"+\"\\ty\"\n+\"\\u00E0\"+\"\\u00E1\"+\"\\u00E2\"+\"\\u00E3\"+\"\\u00E8\"+\"\\u00E9\"+\"\\u00EA\"+\"\\u00EC\"\n+\"\\u00ED\"+\"\\u00F2\"+\"\\u00F3\"+\"\\u00F4\"+\"\\u00F5\"+\"\\u00F9\"+\"\\u00FA\"+\"\\u00FD\"\n+\"\\u0103\"+\"\\u0111\"+\"\\u0129\"+\"\\u0169\"+\"\\u01A1\"+\"\\u01B0\"+\"\\u1EA1\"+\"\\u1EA3\"\n+\"\\u1EA5\"+\"\\u1EA7\"+\"\\u1EA9\"+\"\\u1EAB\"+\"\\u1EAD\"+\"\\u1EAF\"+\"\\u1EB1\"+\"\\u1EB3\"\n+\"\\u1EB5\"+\"\\u1EB7\"+\"\\u1EB9\"+\"\\u1EBB\"+\"\\u1EBD\"+\"\\u1EBF\"+\"\\u1EC1\"+\"\\u1EC3\"\n+\"\\u1EC5\"+\"\\u1EC7\"+\"\\u1EC9\"+\"\\u1ECB\"+\"\\u1ECD\"+\"\\u1ECF\"+\"\\u1ED1\"+\"\\u1ED3\"\n+\"\\u1ED5\"+\"\\u1ED7\"+\"\\u1ED9\"+\"\\u1EDB\"+\"\\u1EDD\"+\"\\u1EDF\"+\"\\u1EE1\"+\"\\u1EE3\"\n+\"\\u1EE5\"+\"\\u1EE7\"+\"\\u1EE9\"+\"\\u1EEB\"+\"\\u1EED\"+\"\\u1EEF\"+\"\\u1EF1\"+\"\\u1EF3\"+\n\"\\u1EF5\"+\"\\u1EF7\"+\"\\u1EF9\");\n&lt;/script&gt;\nOpen source.\nSome software is free to use.

It is on the Adriatic Sea. Its main industries are wine-making, fishing, and mining. The number of people living in Trani in 2011 was 53,940.\nHistory of Trani.\nThe old name of Trani was or Tirenum. An old myth says that Tirenus built the city. Tirenus was the son of Diomedes, a hero in ancient Greece who fought in the Trojan War. The city was on an ancient Roman map called the \"\". It was the first map to show this city. The map was made in the 3rd century. At first, Trani was a very small city and not very important. It started to grow and be more important in the 9th century. At that time, the Lombards (a Germanic people) ruled Trani. Later, the Byzantine Empire ruled the city.\nThe Normans took over Trani from the Byzantine Empire in the 11th century. From the 11th century until the 13th century, Trani was a rich and very important city. This was especially true when the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II ruled Trani. Trani was an important port for the Knights Templar during the Crusades. People came from all over Italy to do business there. Many churches, palaces, and castles were built in Trani during this time. Many Jews lived in Trani at this time. There were 200 Jewish families and four big synagogues in the city. Isaiah di Trani, one of the most famous rabbis of the Middle Ages, lived there.\nAfter Frederick II died in 1250, there was trouble in Trani. In the next 300 years, there were wars between the Angevins, Aragon and Venice over who should rule Trani. The city became poorer and less important. Trani was almost destroyed during the French Revolutionary Wars at the end of the 18th century. Many people in the town were against the French Revolution. In March 1799, they rioted and killed many members of the city's most important families. When the French army saw this, they attacked the city on April 1, 1799. The army killed many people and burned Trani's buildings. Over 1000 people died in the riots and the French attack.\nTrani began to grow again in the middle of the 19th century. It grew even more in the 20th century. By 2011, 53,940 people lived in the city.\nIndustries.\nToday, the main industries in Trani are wine-making, fishing, and mining. Trani is famous for a sweet wine called '. The grapes for this wine are grown in the Trani countryside. Fruit and olives for making olive oil are other important crops for Trani. There are mines for bauxite just outside the city. There are also quarries for a special kind of rock called ' (Trani stone). Trani has special factories for cutting this stone. Many buildings in Trani and in southern Italy are made from this stone. Trani stone was used to build the ports in Malta and Egypt. Trani also has some small factories for making clothes and shoes.\nReferences.\nSources"}

If the province is in the city (), then it will have districts (). If the city has some country districts attached, then they are separated as counties ().\nInside the city, the districts break down into smaller divisions called city wards (). If the county is outside the city, or in a country province, then that county will be broken down into smaller divisional areas ().\nThere are more divisions in every province:\nAdministration units.\nFive city provinces are directly under the government of Vietnam. Administratively, each city is divided into districts and counties. \nEach city has smaller level administrative units, including the districts, wards, communes, and areas. Administration includes the total area in kilometers square, an official census of the city's population (per million people), and the density of people (per kilometers square). Concentration is usually in the inner city, including more people, with closer living. The country districts have less people.\nAdministration of each city is done through the City People's Council, with representatives elected directly every five years. Elected representatives decide the plans for economic development, culture, education, and all other responsibilities. The Head of the People's Council consists of a chairman, a vice chairman, and permanent members. Councils are under the supervision and guidance from the National Assembly Standing Committee.\nThe City People's Council elects the People's Committee, it is the agency directly responsible for the management of the political, security, economic, and cultural interests of the city. The departments of the People's Committee will manage specific areas, such as health, education, investment, justice, finance . In addition, the People's Committee also manages a number of corporations in the city.\nThe government of Vietnam names at least one level of every location a commune. There is a slight difference between an active commune (Xa), and an administrative commune (Xa Huyen). Some communes are very active as cooperatives. In other areas (and in other divisions) the residents have more to do than just commune activities. It's a difference created by the market-economy. Not everyone elects to work for the commune - in commune jobs.\nInvestment and ownership.\nForeigners don't normally invest in the cultural homes directly. And, little or no re-gentrification has been occurring after progress. Hems are different. Hems are transformed into beautiful villas/towns. Some hems have a full circuit of interior roadways that allow for better communities.\nMany cities are beautified in arrangement between departments, province, district, ward, local committees, and residents. However, this is the source of numerous disputes/arguments. The management of the activity doesn't satisfy all the people involved. But, some people are happy with the result - some people choose to get paid to demolish their own house for the progress of a city plan. \nConservation.\nOlder residencies can be left intact for various reasons.\nCommittees.\nEvery division is described so that a committee can manage it. In some provinces committees have established industrial parks. Foreign investment is directed at larger divisions (provinces) who can grant tax and regulation help and incentives."}

{"id": "360792", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=360792", "title": "Containerization", "text": "Containerization is a system of freight transport based on a range of steel containers (\"shipping containers\", \"ISO containers\" etc.). Containers are built to standardized sizes. They can be loaded and unloaded, stacked, transported over long distances. They can be transferred from one mode of transport to another\u2014ships, rail and semi-trailer trucks\u2014without being opened. The system developed after World War II. It led to greatly reduced transport costs, and supported a great increase in international trade.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nContainerization has its origins in coal mining regions in England from the late 18th century onwards. \"Loose boxes\" were used to containerize coal from the late 1780s, at places like the Bridgewater Canal. They were used for moving coal on and off barges.\nBy the 1830s, railroads on several continents were carrying containers that could be transferred to other modes of transport. The Liverpool and Manchester Railway in the United Kingdom was one such. \"Simple timber boxes, four to a wagon, they were used to convey coal from the Lancashire collieries to Liverpool, where they were transferred to horse drawn carts by crane\". By the 1840s, iron boxes were in use as well as wooden ones. The early 1900s saw closed container boxes designed for movement between road and rail.\nIn the United Kingdom, several railway companies were using similar containers by the beginning of the 20th century and in the 1920s the Railway Clearing House standardized the RCH container. Five- or ten-foot-long, wooden and non-stackable, these early standard containers were a great success.\nFrom 1926 to 1947 in the US, the Chicago North Shore and Milwaukee Railway carried motor carrier vehicles and shippers' vehicles loaded on flatcars between Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Chicago, Illinois. Beginning in 1929, Seatrain Lines carried railroad boxcars on its sea vessels between New York and Cuba. \nDuring World War II the Australian Army used containers. These non-stackable containers were about the size of the later 20 foot ISO container and perhaps made mainly of wood.\n1950s expansion.\nToward the end of World War II, the United States Army used containers to speed the loading and unloading of transport ships. The army used the term \"transporters\" for shipping household goods of officers in the field. A \"transporter\" was a reusable container, long, wide, and high, made of rigid steel with a carrying capacity of 9,000 pounds. \nDuring the Korean War the transporter was evaluated for handling sensitive military equipment and, proving effective, was approved for broader use. \nIn 1952 the army began using the term CONEX, short for \"Container Express\". The first major shipment of CONEXes, containing engineering supplies and spare parts, was made by rail from the Columbus General Depot in Georgia to the Port of San Francisco, then by ship to Yokohama, Japan, and then to Korea. \nIn 1955, a trucking company owner, Malcom McLean, worked with engineer Keith Tantlinger to develop the modern container. The challenge was to design a shipping container that could be loaded onto ships and held securely for long sea voyages. The result was a tall by wide box in -long units constructed from thick corrugated steel.\nThe design had a twistlock mechanism on top each of the four corners. This meant the container could be easily secured and lifted by cranes. After helping McLean make the successful design, Tantlinger convinced him to give the patented designs to the industry. This began international standardization of shipping containers.\nThe U.S. Department of Defense standardized an 8'\u00d78' cross section container in multiples of 10' lengths for military use. This was exactly the standard proposed by McLean and Tantlinger in Britain, and it was rapidly adopted for shipping purposes.\nShipping industry standard.\nThere are many variations on the standard 8'x8'x10' size, but the use of containers for transport is now world-wide. In addition to ships, containers are universally used on planes for international air transport. Countries with large rail networks still use containers for much of their freight transport.\nOther widely used standard include the 20 Foot container having external dimensions of 20 feet long, 8 feet wide and 8.5 feet high and the 40 Foot length.\nPorts.\nPorts round the world have been adapted to freight transport by container. The ships that carry containers are huge, and ports must have depth and size to dock ships. China is by far the world's largest user of container transport. Container ships cannot get down the Thames to London, so a modern container port was built at Felixtowe on the Suffolk coast. The Port of Felixtowe is the UK's largest container port, and carries 35% of the UK container cargo. However, it is only the 29th busiest container port in the world. \nWorld #1 container port is Shanghai, China; #2 is Singapore, and #3 is Rotterdam, Netherlands. Top U.S. container port is South Louisiana at #9, just in front of Houston. These rankings are by millions of tons.\nThe use of containers has caused increased efficiency in loading and unloading. Also, there have been changes in short-term storage and handling in ports."}

It is about two and a half hours drive southeast of Calgary, Alberta, Canada.\nThe park is in the valley of the Red Deer River, which is noted for its badland topography. The park is one of the richest dinosaur fossil locales in the world. Forty dinosaur species have been discovered at the park and more than 500 specimens have been removed and exhibited in museums across the globe. The fossil assemblage of nearly 500 species, from microscopic fern spores to large carnivorous dinosaurs, justified it becoming a World Heritage Site in 1979.\nDinosaur Provincial Park Visitor Centre.\nThe Visitor Centre has exhibits about dinosaurs, fossils, and the geology and natural history of the park. There is a video theater, fossil prep lab area, and a gift shop. Public programs are offered in the summer.\nJohn Ware's Cabin is a restored early 20th century cabin that was used by John Ware, an African-American cowboy and important figure in Alberta's ranching history. The cabin is near the visitor center and is open on select days in the summer.\nHistory.\nThe Park was set up on June 27, 1955 as part of Alberta's 50th Jubilee Year. The main aim was to protect the fossil beds. The park was recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site on October 26, 1979. Its significant badlands and riverside habitats, and the importance of the fossils found here, were listed as reasons.\nUntil 1985, discoveries made in the park had to be shipped to museums throughout the world for scientific analysis and display, including the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa, and the American Museum of Natural History in New York. This changed with the opening of the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology 100 kilometers upstream in Midland Provincial Park. This has a mission to \"collect, preserve, research and interpret palaeontological history with special reference to Alberta\u2019s fossil heritage\".\nNature.\nThe Park protects a very complex ecosystem with three communities: prairie grasslands, badlands, and riverside cottonwoods. Its ecosystem is surrounded by prairies. Choruses of coyotes are common at dusk, as are the calls of nighthawks. Cottontail rabbits, mule deer, and pronghorn can all be seen in the park; the prairie rattlesnake, bull snake and the red-sided garter snake are present as well. Curlews and Canada geese are among the 165 bird species that can be seen in the spring and summer. Some of the most northern species of cactus, including \"Opuntia\" (prickly pear) and \"Pediocactus\" (pincushion) can be seen in full bloom during the later half of June.\nGeology.\nThe sediments of Dinosaur Provincial Park span 2.8 million years and three formations. The terrestrial Oldman Formation is at the base of the strata; the terrestrial Dinosaur Park Formation above, and the marine Bearpaw at the top. The Dinosaur Park Formation, which contains most of the fossils with articulated skeletons, was mostly laid down by large rivers in very warm temperate coastal lowlands. It was on the western margin of the Western Interior Seaway. The formation dates to about 75 million years ago. The Dinosaur Park Formation lasted about a million years.\nPaleontology.\nDinosaur Provincial Park preserves an extraordinarily diverse group of freshwater vertebrates. Fish include sharks, rays, paddlefish, bowfins, gars, and teleosts. Amphibians include frogs, salamanders, and extinct albanerpetontids. Reptiles include lizards (such as the large monitor \"Paleosaniwa\"), a wide range of turtles, crocodilians, and the fish-eating \"Champsosaurus\". Mammals such as shrews, marsupials, and squirrel-like rodents are also there, although usually only noticed by their fossilized teeth, rather than bones.\nMega-plant fossils are rare in the park, but pollen grains and spores collected from here suggest that these forests contained sycamore, magnolia and bald cypress trees, and \"Metasequoia\".\nThe dinosaurs of the park are astonishingly diverse. They include:\nCeratopsia\nHadrosauridae\nAnkylosauria\nHypsilophodontidae\nPachycephalosauria\nTyrannosauridae\nOrnithomimidae\nCaenagnathidae\nDromaeosauridae\nTroodontidae\nClassification Uncertain\nBirds of the \"Hesperornis\" type were present, as well as giant Pterosauria related to \"Quetzalcoatlus\". multituberculates, Stagodont marsupials and placental mammals scurried underfoot."}

Sometimes, exploitation movies attract a cult following they get the attention of the movie critics. Some of these movies set trends, and become important. An example of such a movie is Night of the Living Dead, of 1968. \nThe term \"exploitation\" is defined very loosely: it is more about the viewers' impression that this exploitation happens, than the people actually being exploited. The first exploitation movies appeared in the 1920s. Exploitation movies only became popular after the 1960s and 1970s, when there was less censorship. Very often, exploitation movies use recent news events to base their story on. Major film studios ofen avoid such events, because producing the movie takes a long time and a lot of money. \nIn 1938, Orson Welles produced War of the Worlds to be broadcast on radio, as a Halloween special. When it was aired, this shocked many Americans. As a result, Universal Pictures edited one of their Flash Gordon serials into a short movie which it released ot movie theatres one week after Welles' boradcast.

A great deal is now known about the sequences of DNA which are on our chromosomes. What the DNA actually does is now partly known. Applying this knowledge in practice has only just begun.\nThe Human Genome Project (HGP) produced a reference sequence which is used worldwide in biology and medicine. \"Nature\" published the publicly funded project's report, and \"Science\" published Celera's paper. These papers described how the draft sequence was produced, and gave an analysis of the sequence. Improved drafts were announced in 2003 and 2005, filling in to \u224892% of the sequence.\nThe latest project ENCODE studies the way the genes are controlled.\nDNA and proteins.\nThe human genome contains just over 20,000 protein-coding genes, far fewer than had been expected. In fact, only about 1.5% of the genome codes for proteins, while the rest consists of non-coding RNA genes, regulatory sequences, and introns.\nHowever, a single gene can produce a variety of proteins by means of RNA splicing. One particular Drosophila gene (DSCAM) can be alternatively spliced into 38,000 different mRNAs. Each mRNA codes for a different peptide chain. Therefore the number of proteins produced is far above the number of coding genes.\nWith RNA splicing and post-RNA translation changes, the total number of unique human proteins may be in the low millions.\nThe idea that most DNA is useless 'junk' is wrong. At least 80% of the genome has definite functions.\nDifferences between humans and chimpanzees.\nThe animal that is alive now that is closest to humans is the chimpanzee. 98.4% of the DNA is the same between humans and chimpanzees. However, this applies only to single nucleotide polymorphisms, that is, changes in \"single\" base pairs only. The full picture is rather different.\nThe draft sequence of the common chimpanzee genome was published in 2005. It showed that the regions which are similar enough to be aligned with one another account for 2400 million of the human genome\u2019s 3164.7 million bases, that is, 75.8% of the genome.\nThis 75.8% of the human genome is 1.23% different from the chimpanzee genome in single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs - changes of single DNA \u201cletters\u201d in the genome). Another type of difference, called 'indels' (insertions/deletions) account for another ~3% difference between the alignable sequences. In addition, variation in copy number of large segments (&gt; 20 kb) of similar DNA sequence provides a further 2.7% difference between the two species. Hence the total similarity of the genomes could be as low as about 70%."}

Between 133-137 people were killed, when the Red Army and the KGB shot the protesters. As a result, the Azerbaijanis became totally opposed to stay a part of the Soviet Union and started to plan the independence of Azerbaijan. This happened with the end of the Soviet Union in December 1991.\nIt was one of the rare events during the liberal reform era of \"glasnost\" (reform of the government) and \"perestroika\" (reform of the economy) in which the Soviet Union used force against peaceful protesters. Before this era, the Soviet Union did not allow any protests of its population and stopped them violently if they did protest. \nThe reason for using violence, was that powerful conservative people in the Communist Party, the Red Army and the KGB did not like these reforms and feared that the ethnic groups and republics of the Soviet Union were getting out of their control with the rise of nationalism. \nHowever, the use of violence angered the people in Azerbaijan and the rest of the Soviet Union. It had the opposite effect, because the liberal Soviet leaders and their reforms were too popular and powerful in the end. Neither the use of force against protesters nor the reforms prevented the republics becoming independent."}

It can be identified by the shape of its \"hammer\" (called the \"cephalofoil\"), which is wide and has an almost straight margin at the front, and by its first dorsal fin which is tall, and is sickle-shaped.\nDescription.\nLike all other Hammerhead sharks, the Great Hammerhead Shark has a streamlined body and a \"hammer\" on its head. They have usually been confused with the Scalloped Hammerhead Shark and the Smooth Hammerhead Shark, but adult Great Hammerhead Sharks can be identified by their wide cephalofoil which has an almost straight margin at the front, and by their first dorsal fin, which is tall and sickle-shaped. The cephalofoil is usually around 1 to 1.5 meters long.\nGreat Hammerhead Sharks are around 2.85 to 5.5 meters long, and weigh around 450\u00a0kg, but the longest ever found was 6.1 meters long. The heaviest ever found was a 4.4 meter long female, which weighed 580\u00a0kg, and was caught off Boca Grande, Florida. But the female weighed this much because it was pregnant. The top part of the Great Hammerhead Shark is grey-brown or green, and the belly is white.\nWhere they live.\nThe Great Hammerhead Shark is found in tropical waters around the world, between the latitudes 40\u00b0N to 37\u00b0S. In the Atlantic Ocean it is found from North Carolina to Uruguay, including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, and from Morocco to Senegal, and the Mediterranean Sea. It is found all along the rim of the Indian Ocean, and in the Pacific Ocean from the Ryukyu Islands to Australia, New Caledonia, and French Polynesia, and from southern Baja California to Peru. It's said to be found off Gambia, Guinea, Mauritania, Sierra Leone, and Western Sahara, but this has not been confirmed. Great Hammerhead Sharks can be found from inshore waters which are less than 1 meters deep, to a depth of 80 meters offshore. They live mainly in coral reefs, but have been found in lagoons and deep water near land.\nBehaviour.\nEven though Great Hammerhead Sharks are apex predators, young pups have been seen eaten by Bull sharks. Yellow jacks have been seen rubbing themselves against Great Hammerhead Sharks, probably to get rid of parasites. Pilot fish have been seen swimming with Great Hammerhead Sharks.\nReproduction.\nGreat Hammerhead Sharks are viviparous, meaning they give live birth. Females are pregnant for around 11 months, before giving birth to a litter of 6-56 pups. When they are born, the pups are around 50\u201370\u00a0cm (20 to 28 in) long. Males mature when they are about 2.3 to 2.8 meters long, and weigh around 51\u00a0kg. Females mature when they are about 2.5 to 3 meters long, and weigh around 41\u00a0kg. Great Hammerhead Sharks live for around 20\u201330 years, but the oldest Great Hammerhead Shark ever found was said to be 40\u201350 years old.\nFeeding.\nGreat Hammerhead Sharks are known to hunt at dawn and at dusk. They feed on crustaceans like crabs and lobsters, molluscs like squids and octopuses, bony fish like tarpon, sardines, herrings, sea catfish, toadfish, porgies, jacks, croakers, groupers, flatfish, boxfish, and porcupine fish. They also eat other sharks like smoothhounds and grey reef sharks. Great Hammerhead Sharks have been known to eat others of their kind.\nGreat Hammerhead Sharks' favourite prey are rays and skates; its favourite type of ray are stingrays. The venomous spines of the stingrays don't seem to affect them, because a Great Hammerhead Shark caught off Florida had 96 venomous spines found in and around its mouth.\nThe cephalofoil of the Great Hammerhead Shark is said to be used to pin stingrays down, because one Great Hammerhead Shark was found attacking a southern stingray in the Bahamas; the Great Hammerhead Shark first pinned the stingray down by hitting the stingray with its cephalofoil, and then it grabbed the stingray in its jaws and started to rip apart the stingray by shaking its head rapidly. Another Great Hammerhead Shark was found attacking a spotted eagle ray in open water; the Great Hammerhead Shark first bit off one of the ray's pectoral fins, and then pinned the ray down with its cephalofoil, and then ate the ray head-first.\nHuman interactions.\nAlthough they have been said to be dangerous towards humans, Great Hammerhead Sharks rarely ever attack humans. Divers have reported that Great Hammerhead Sharks are shy and avoid humans, but there have been reports of Great Hammerhead Sharks approaching divers closely and even chasing them. In 2009, the International Shark Attack File listed 34 attacks caused by a shark which belonged in the \"Sphyrna\" genus, but it is not confirmed if the shark was a Great Hammerhead Shark or not. The Great Hammerhead Shark has been confirmed to be responsible for one provoked attack.\nConservation status.\nThe Great Hammerhead Shark has been listed as endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), because of fishing for its fins, which are made into shark fin soup, for its skin which is made into leather, and their liver oil for vitamins. Populations of the Great Hammerhead Shark have decreased by 50% because of fishing. "}

The relationships of the owls in general are still unresolved.\nMorphology.\nTypical owls vary greatly in size. The smallest is the Elf owl. Its weight is a hundred times less than the largest, the Eurasian Eagle owl and Blakiston's Fish owl. Most owls have very similar bodies. They have large heads, short tails, and round facial circles around the eyes. Most live in trees (with a few exceptions like the Burrowing owl) and get their food on the wing. The wings are large, broad, rounded and long. Like other birds of prey many owls have females that are larger than males.\nThey are nocturnal. Because of this the plumage is not much different between males and females. The feathers are soft and the base of each is downy. This give them silent flight. Hearing in owls is highly sensitive. The ears are asymmetrical which lets the owl localise a sound. Owls have massive eyes relative to their body size."}

His is the first known model that put the Sun at the center of the known universe with the Earth revolving around it (see Solar system).\nAristarchus was influenced by Philolaus of Croton, but he identified the \"central fire\" with the Sun, and put the other planets in their correct order of distance around the Sun. His astronomical ideas were often rejected in favour of the geocentric theories of Aristotle and Ptolemy.\nPersonal information.\nHis name is \"\u1f08\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2\" in Greek letters, which transliterates to Aristarchos. He was born on the island of Samos, in the eastern Aegean Sea.\nHeliocentrism.\nHeliocentrism is the idea of the Sun at the centre. Though the original text has been lost, a reference in Archimedes' book \"The Sand Reckoner\" describes another work by Aristarchus in which he advanced the heliocentric model as an alternative hypothesis. Archimedes wrote:\nSo Aristarchus believed the stars were very far away, which is an important step. Therefore, there was no observable parallax, that is, a movement of the stars relative to each other while the Earth moves around the Sun. The stars are much farther away than was generally assumed in ancient times; and the tiny amount of stellar parallax is only detectable with telescopes.\nThe old geocentric model explained planetary parallax, and was assumed to be the reason why no stellar parallax was observed. Rejection of the heliocentric view was common, as the following passage from Plutarch suggests (\"On the apparent face in the orb of the Moon\"):\nThe only other astronomer of antiquity who is known by name and who is known to have supported Aristarchus' heliocentric model was Seleucus, a Hellenistic astronomer who lived a century after Aristarchus.\nThe heliocentric theory was successfully revived nearly 1800 years later by Copernicus, after which Johannes Kepler and Isaac Newton gave the theoretical explanation based on laws of physics, namely Kepler's laws for the motion of planets and Newton's laws on gravitational attraction and dynamics.\nPrecession.\nThe Vatican library has preserved two ancient manuscripts with estimates of the length of the year. The only ancient scientist listed for two different values is Aristarchus. Both are close to the values later used by Hipparchus and Ptolemy, and the precession indicated is almost precisely 1 degree per century, a value which is too low. 1 degree per century precession was used by all later astronomers until the Arabs. The correct value in Aristarchus's time was about 1.38 degrees per century."}

The word \"Sphyrna\" is a Greek word meaning \"hammer\", which refers to the shape of the shark's head.\nDescription.\nMembers in the \"Sphyrna\" group measure in size from the Scoophead, which is 100 centimeters (1 meter) long, to the Great hammerhead shark, which is 610 centimeters (6.1 meters) long. The Smalleye Hammerhead Shark weighs around 9\u00a0kg, and the Great hammerhead shark weighs about 230\u00a0kg. Members of this group are usually light grey or brownish grey in colour with a tint of green, and have a white belly.\nFeeding.\nMembers of the \"Sphyrna\" group's favourite type of food are stingrays. But they also eat crustaceans like blue crabs and shrimp, molluscs like octopuses and squids, many types of fish like sardines and herrings, and other types of sharks. When they can not find food they start eating each other, but the Great hammerhead shark is known to eat its own young.\nReproduction.\nMembers of this group are mainly viviparous, but in 2007, a bonnethead was found to be capable of asexual reproduction. They give birth to around 12-40 young at a time. Once they are born, young ones come together in groups, and swim towards warmer waters. They then stay together in groups until they are older and big enough to live on their own. They live for around 20\u201330 years."}

Adults are greyish-brown in colour, darker on the back. Occasionally the face and neck are reddish-brown. Bearded seal pups are born with a greyish-brown fur with scattered patches of white on the back and head. The bearded seal is unique in the subfamily Phocinae in having two pairs of teats. This is a feature it shares with monk seals.\nBearded seals are about to in nose-to-tail length. They are to in weight. Both sexes are about the same size.\nBearded seals are a main food source for polar bears and for the Inuit of the Arctic coast. The body fat content of a bearded seal is 30\u201340%.\nHunting and Diet.\nBearded seals feed on a variety of small prey found along the ocean floor, including clams, squid, and fish. Their whiskers serve as feelers in the soft bottom sediments. Adults tend not to dive very deep. They like shallow coastal areas no more than deep. Pups up to one year old will venture much deeper, diving as deep as .\nReproduction and Lifecycle.\nBearded seals give birth in the spring. In the Canadian Arctic, seal pupping is in May. Further south, in Alaska, most pups are born in late April. Pups are born on small drifting ice floes in shallow waters. They usual weigh around 30\u201340\u00a0kg. They enter the water only hours after they are born, and quickly become very good divers. Mothers care for the pups for 18\u201324 days. During this time the pups grow at an average rate of 3.3\u00a0kg per day. Pups consume an average of eight liters of milk a day. By the time they are weaned, the pups have grown to about one hundred kilograms.\nJust before the pups are weaned, a new mating cycle takes place. Females ovulate at the end of their lactation period, but stay close to their pups, ready to defend them if necessary. During the mating season, male seals will \"sing\". This sound may attract females, or may be used by the males to say what territory is theirs or their readiness for breeding. Males live in the same areas from one year to the next."}

Its wingspan is and the body mass is . It has a white face and black head, neck, and upper breast. Its belly is white. The wings and its back are silver-gray with black-and-white bars that look like they are shining when the light reflects on it. During flight a V-shaped white rump patch and the silver-gray underwing linings can be seen.\nEcology, behavior and life history.\nBarnacle geese often build their nests high on mountain cliffs. This keeps them away from predators (mostly Arctic foxes and polar bears) but also away from food. Like all geese, the goslings are not fed by the adults.\nInstead of bringing food to the newly hatched goslings, the goslings are brought to the ground. Unable to fly, the three day old goslings jump off the cliff and fall. Their small size, feathery down, and very light weight helps to protect most of them from serious injury when they hit the rocks below. Some do die from the fall. Arctic foxes are attracted by the noise made by the parent geese during this time. They eat dead or injured goslings. The foxes also stalk the young as they are led by the parents to wetland feeding areas."}

It is migratory. It winters in northwest Europe, especially Great Britain, the Netherlands, and western Denmark.\nIt is a medium-sized goose, 60\u201375\u00a0cm (24\u201330\u00a0in) long. The wingspan is 135\u2013170\u00a0 (53\u201367\u00a0in) cm. It weighs 1.8\u20133.4\u00a0kg (4\u20137.5 lbs). It has a short bill, bright pink in the middle with a black base and tip, and pink feet. The body is grey-brown, the head and neck a richer, darker brown, the rump white, and the tail grey with a broad white tip.\nEcology.\nNesting is often on cliffs close to glaciers. This gives protection from mammalian predators (mainly Arctic Fox). Three to six eggs are laid in early to mid May in Iceland, late May in Svalbard. Incubation lasts 26\u201327 days. On hatching, the goslings go with the parents on foot to the nearest lake. They fledge after about 56 days. Southbound migration is from mid September to early October, and northbound from mid April to early May.\nThe diet is almost entirely vegetarian. In summer, they feed on a wide range of tundra plants, both on land and in water. In winter, they graze mostly on oilseed rape, sugar beet, potato, and various grasses. Damage to crops can be large."}
{"id": "361453", "revid": "183483", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=361453", "title": "Common eider", "text": "The common eider (\"Somateria mollissima\") is a large sea-duck. They live on the northern coasts of Europe, North America and eastern Siberia. It breeds in Arctic and some northern temperate regions. They winter farther south in temperate zones. There it can form large flocks on coastal waters. It can fly at speeds up to 113\u00a0km/h (70\u00a0mph).\nDescription.\nThe common eider is both the largest of the four eider species and the largest duck found in Europe and in North America. It measures in length, weighs and spans across the wings. It has a bulky shape and large, wedge-shaped bill. The male is unmistakable, with its black and white plumage and green nape. The female is a brown bird. It can be told apart from all ducks, except other eider species, because of size and head shape. This duck's call is a pleasant \"ah-ooo\". The species is often readily approachable.\nThis species dives for crustaceans and molluscs, with mussels being a favoured food. The eider will eat mussels by swallowing them whole; the shells are then crushed in their gizzard and excreted. When eating a crab, the Eider will remove all of its claws and legs, and then eat the body in a similar fashion.\nSocial behaviour.\nEiders are colonial breeders. They nest on coastal islands in colonies ranging in size of less than 100 to upwards of 10,000-15,000 individuals. Female eiders often return to breed on the same island where they were hatched. This can lead to a high degree of relatedness between individuals nesting on the same island."}

It breeds along Northern Hemisphere Arctic coasts of northeast Europe, North America and Asia. The birds spend most of the year in coastal marine ecosystems at high latitudes. They migrate to the Arctic tundra to breed in June and July. They lay four to seven eggs in a scrape on the ground lined with grass and down.\nThe king eider winters in arctic and subarctic marine areas, most notably in the Bering Sea, the west coast of Greenland, eastern Canada and northern Norway. It also happens yearly off the northeastern United States, Scotland and Kamchatka. Breeding areas include the Arctic coastal tundra of the north coast of Alaska. This species dives for benthic invertebrates, such as crustaceans, polychaete worms, and molluscs, with mussels being a favoured food. Wintering birds can form large flocks on suitable coastal waters, with some flocks bigger than 100,000 birds.\nThis species is smaller than the common eider. The male is unmistakable with its black body, white breast and multicoloured head. The drake's call is a deep cooing. \nThe female is a brown bird. They can still be told apart from all ducks except other eider species on size and structure. The head is shorter than in the common eider, and the feathering onto the bill is rounded, not triangular in shape.\nAn immature drake is typically all dark with a white breast and a yellow bill patch. \nTraditional Uses.\nThe king eider is a regular source of fresh meat in the spring. They begin their migration past the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta in late April and are hunted in great numbers. In May, several hundred thousand eiders pass Point Barrow in northern Alaska on their way to Alaskan and Canadian breeding grounds."}

The party was stranded north of the Arctic Circle for two years before being rescued. All but one of its members survived. The expedition was paid for by William Ziegler and led by Anthony Fiala. They left from Troms\u00f8, Norway, on June 14, 1903, aboard \"America\". \nPlanning.\nZiegler chose Anthony Fiala, who was a photographer on an earlier mission, to lead his second polar trip. Fiala calculated that the food for an eight dog team and driver would be at least 1100 pounds. This was an issue, as the most a sled could hold was 600 pounds. He planned to use ponies to carry the extra supplies. Then to feed the dogs on horse meat when the supplies were low.\nIsolation and rescue.\nIn November 1903 severe weather started. The ship broke up, destroying the provisions and coal. \nThe following spring, more tries were made to reach the pole by traveling both east and west. The conditions were too severe, and open water caused difficulties. Supplies ran low, and the expedition headed south. They reached depots at Cape Flora, Cape Dillion, and Camp Ziegler.\nWilliam Peters, who was second in command, took this time to lead the crew in survey work. This helped to make maps and charts better.\nWith the knowledge that rescue ships would be sent to them, the expedition stayed hopeful. A rescue party, led by William S. Champ aboard the \"Terra Nova\", sailed direct to the ice fields. On July 24, they encountered thick ice. This made the crew doubt they could reach their destination. However the ship reached Palmi Island on July 28 and Cape Dillion the following day. 6 expedition members were found there. More members were found at Cape Flora, and the Terra Nova returned to Cape Dillion. A sled party was organized, which brought back the crew."}

The existence of this ability is disputed.\nThe claims made differ somewhat, but stress the recall of visual information. Examples of the information include: pages from books, magazines, and license plate numbers. It is claimed that those with a photographic memory tend to have higher IQs than those without it. A person with this ability does not use mnemonics. \nThe ability is said to occur in the early childhood of a small number of children (between 2 percent and 10 percent) and generally is not found in adults. \nSceptics.\nSome do not believe this skill exists. The American cognitive scientist Marvin Minsky, in his book \"The Society of Mind\" (1988), thought that reports of photographic memory were an \u201cunfounded myth\u201d.\nAdriaan de Groot studied the ability of chess grandmasters to memorize the positions of chess pieces on a chess board. At first, people thought they had photographic memory because they could memorize far more information than nonexperts. However, arrangements of pieces that could never occur in a game, their recall was no better than nonexperts. This suggests that they only have an ability to remember certain types of information, rather than photographic memory.\nAround 1970, Charles Stromeyer studied his future wife, Elizabeth. He claimed that she could recall poetry written in a foreign language which she did not understand. She could remember the poetry years after she had first seen the poem. She also could, apparently, recall random dot patterns so as to combine two patterns into a stereoscopic image. She is the only person who is known to have passed such a test. The methods used in the testing procedures were not clear. Additionally, the tests have never been repeated (Elizabeth has consistently refused to repeat them). This raised further concerns, and increased skepticism about whether photographic memories were real."}

{"id": "362135", "revid": "6522802", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=362135", "title": "Lemma (linguistics)", "text": "A lemma is a word that stands at the head of a definition in a dictionary. All the head words in a dictionary are lemmas. Technically, it is \"a base word and its inflections\".\nA lemma is the word you find in the dictionary. A lexeme is a unit of meaning, and can be more than one word. A lexeme is the set of all forms that have the same meaning, while \"lemma\" refers to the particular form that is chosen by convention to represent the lexeme.\nIn English, for example, \"run\", \"runs\" and \"running\" are forms of the same lexeme, but \"run\" is the lemma.\nMorphology.\nIn English, the lemma of a noun is the singular: e.g., \"mouse\" rather than \"mice\". In languages with gender, the head word of regular adjectives and nouns is usually the masculine singular. If the language also has cases, the lemma is often the masculine singular nominative.\nIn many languages, the citation form of a verb is the infinitive: French \"aller\", German \"gehen\", Spanish \"ir\". In English it usually is the full infinitive (\"to go\") although alphabetized without 'to' (\"go\").\nDifference between stem and lemma.\nIn computational linguistics, a stem is the part of the word that never changes even when different forms of the word are used. A lemma is the base form of the verb. For example, from \"produced\", the lemma is \"produce\", but the stem is \"produc-\". This is because there are words such as production. When sound (phonology) is taken into account, the definition of the unchangeable part of the word is not so useful. Notice the sound of the words in the example: \"produced\" versus \"production\" .\nSome lexemes have several stems but one lemma. For instance \"to go\" (the lemma) has the stems \"go\" and \"went\". Here, the past tense is based on a different verb, \"to wend\". The \"-t\" suffix is equivalent to \"-ed\"."}

It is originally a wood product called lignite, squeezed and heated by geological processes. The older definition of mineral did not apply to organic material. Therefore, jet was not called a mineral, but instead a \"mineraloid\". However, this view is changing, as so many crystalline materials have organic origin.\nThe English noun \"jet\" comes from the French word for the same material: \"jaiet\". Jet is either black or dark brown, but may contain pyrite inclusions, which are of brassy colour and metallic lustre. The adjective \"jet-black\", meaning as dark a black as possible, comes from this material."}

It was caused by cyanobacteria doing photosynthesis. It took a very long time, from about three billion years ago to about one billion years ago.\nPhotosynthesis was producing oxygen both before and after the GOE. The difference was that before the GOE, organic matter and dissolved iron chemically captured any free oxygen. Earth has much iron, and iron has higher solubility than its oxides, so the oceans had much dissolved iron. It became iron oxide and made huge deposits as banded iron rock from the Archaean and Proterozoic eras. When not enough iron remained to capture more oxygen, free oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere. This was the GOE.\nOxygen was toxic to most of the Earth's anaerobic inhabitants at the time. As cyanobacteria produced oxygen, and built their stromatolites, they changed the environment for other protists. Since the other protists had no way to deal with oxygen, most would have become extinct. Another consequence was the effect of free oxygen on atmospheric methane, a greenhouse gas. The reaction removed the methane and caused the Huronian glaciation, possibly the longest snowball Earth episode ever. Free oxygen has been an important part of the atmosphere ever since.\nTiming.\nThe evidence is that free oxygen was first produced by photosynthetic organisms (prokaryotic, later eukaryotic) which emitted oxygen as a waste product. These organisms lived long before the GOE, perhaps 3500 million years ago (mya). The oxygen they produced would have quickly been removed from the atmosphere by the 'mass rusting' which led to the deposition of banded-iron formations. Oxygen only began to persist in the atmosphere in small quantities shortly (~50 million years) before the start of the GOE. Without a draw-down, oxygen would accumulate very rapidly. At today's rates of photosynthesis (which are much greater than those in the land-plant-free Precambrian), modern atmospheric O2 levels could be produced in around 2,000\u00a0years.\nSummary:"}

They are membrane-spanning, that is, they reach from the outside of the cell to the inside. \nTLRs recognize molecules which come from microbes. Once microbes get through physical barriers such as the skin or intestinal tract mucosa, they are recognized by TLRs. The TLRs set up an immune cell response.\nTLR signalling leads to the induction or suppression of genes that orchestrate the inflammatory response. In all, thousands of genes are activated by TLR signalling, and the TLRs are one of the most important means of gene modulation.\nToll-like receptors have also been shown to be an important link between innate and adaptive immunity through their presence in dendritic cells.\nExtended family.\nMost mammalian species have between ten and fifteen types of Toll-like receptors. Thirteen TLRs (TLR1 to TLR13) have been identified in humans and mice, and similar ones have been found in other mammalian species. TLRs are not identical in all mammals. For example, a gene coding for a protein like TLR10 in humans is present in mice, but seems to have been damaged at some time by a retrovirus. On the other hand, mice express TLRs 11, 12, and 13, none of which is present in humans. Other mammals may express TLRs that are not found in humans. Non-mammalian species may have TLRs different from mammals.\nHistory.\nThey got their name from their similarity to the protein coded by the Toll gene identified in \"Drosophila\" in 1985 by Christiane N\u00fcsslein-Volhard. The gene in question, when mutated, makes the Drosophila flies look unusual. The researchers were so surprised that they spontaneously shouted out in German \"Das ist ja toll!\" which translates as \"That's great!\".\nToll-like receptors are now counted among the key molecules that alert the immune system to the presence of microbial infections. In 1996, \"Toll\" was found by Jules A. Hoffmann and his colleagues to have an essential role in the fly's immunity to fungal infection. It worked by activating the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides. Plant homologues were discovered in 1995 (rice XA21), and 2000 (\"Arabidopsis\" FLS2).\nTLR 4 function as a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) sensing receptor was discovered by Bruce A. Beutler and colleagues. These workers proved that mice which could not respond to LPS had mutations which abolished the function of TLR4. This identified TLR4 as one of the key components of the receptor for LPS."}

In the case of television commentary, the commentator is usually only heard and not often seen. In North American English, a commentator is also called an announcer or sportscaster. Often, the main commentator (called a play-by-play in North America) works with a color commentator and sometimes a sideline reporter. With big events, many sideline reporters are used. \nTypes of sports broadcasters.\nMost sports television broadcast have one play-by-play announcer and one color commentator. An example is NBC Sunday Night Football in the United States. It is called by Cris Collinsworth, a former American football receiver, and Al Michaels, a professional announcer. In the United Kingdom, there is not as much of a difference between play-by-play and color commentary. Two-man commentary teams usually have a person formal journalistic training but little or no sports experience leading the commentary, and an expert former (or current) competitor dealing with analysis. There are exceptions to this. All of the United Kingdom's major cricket and snooker commentators are former professionals in their sports. The well known Formula One racing commentator Murray Walker had no formal journalistic training and only a small amount of racing experience of his own.\nUsing a play-by-play announcer and one or more color commentators is standard . In the past it was much more common for a play-by-play announcer to work alone. \nUnited States.\nAlthough sports broadcasts started in 1912, the first sports commentary was broadcast in April 1921. It was done by Florent Gibson of the Pittsburg Star newspaper. He was covering the fight between Johnny Ray and Johnny \"Hutch\" Dundee at the Motor Square Garden, Pittsburgh.\nIn the United States, nearly all professional sports teams, most collegiate teams have their own Sports commentators. These people are usually thought of as the voice of the team on radio broadcasts. They are often considered a part of the team like the players or the coaches. Television networks and cable channels will also have their own group of play-by-play announcers that work with different teams."}

This structure is what makes proteins work.\nProteins are important biological macromolecules present in all organisms. They are polymers formed from 20 possible amino acids by RNA translation. Protein structures range in size from tens to several thousand amino acids.\nAfter translation, proteins fold into specific shapes. This is not done by chemical bonds but by weaker forces such as hydrogen bonds. To understand how proteins work, it is often necessary to discover their three-dimensional structure. To do this biophysics uses techniques such as X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and dual polarisation interferometry.\nA protein may switch from one shape to another as it does its job. The alternative states of the same protein are called conformations. An enzyme, for instance, will have at least two conformations: one with its co-enzyme and one without. The form with its coenzyme will have two conformations: one with its substrate and one without.\nLevels of protein structure.\nThere are four distinct levels of protein structure.\nPrimary structure.\nProteins are molecules that consist of one or more chains of amino acids. Each different protein has a distinct set of amino acids in a particular order. The primary structure refers to the sequence of the amino acids of a single polypeptide chain from its start (N-terminus) to its end (C-terminus). The amino acids are held together by a specific type of covalent bond, known as a peptide bond, which are made during the process of protein biosynthesis or translation.\nSecondary structure.\nSecondary structure refers to parts of the protein chain that form regular structures. There are two main types of secondary structure: alpha helix and beta strand (beta sheet). Alpha helices are coils that turn in a clockwise rotation and beta strands form a beta sheet where the chains lie alongside each other. The two types of secondary structure were suggested in 1951 by Linus Pauling and coworkers. Unlike the polypeptide chain, which is bonded through covalent peptide bonds, secondary structure is formed by hydrogen bonds.\nTertiary structure.\nThis is the shape (spatial organization) of an entire protein molecule. Protein folding is largely self-organising. It is mainly done by the protein's primary structure its sequence of amino acids. This is called Anfinsen's dogma. However, the environment in which a protein is synthesized and folds also effect its final shape.\nQuaternary structure.\nIf proteins are built of sub-units this gives another level of structure. This, the quaternary structure, is how the subunits fit together. Haemoglobin, for example, has two alpha and two beta chains. Both the alpha chains and beta chains are coded for by a cluster of six or seven genes, which provide the code for different versions of the molecule."}
