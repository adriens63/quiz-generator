In 1070 he became the Archbishop of Canterbury in England. This was the peak of an extraordinary life.\nLife.\nLanfranc was born in the early years of the 11th century at Pavia in Italy. His father, Hanbald, held a rank equivalent to a magistrate. He was orphaned at an early age. Lanfranc was trained in the liberal arts. He crossed the Alps, and took up the role of teacher in France and eventually in Normandy. About 1039 he became the master of the cathedral school at Avranches. He taught for three years with much success. \nIn 1042 he gave this up to become a monk in the newly founded Bec Abbey. He became the first prior of Bec Abbey in 1045. He became a friend of William, Duke of Normandy and by 1050 his counselor. Lanfranc then became the abbot of St Stephen in Normandy. \nIn 1067, when Maurilius, Archbishop of Rouen, died, Lanfranc declined the position. He would not have been able to do so without the consent of William I. It is likely William had something bigger in mind for Lanfranc. In 1070 Stigand, the Archbishop of Canterbury was deposed by papal legates. William brought Lanfranc from Normandy to England to become the Archbishop of Canterbury."}

He was instrumental in the early stages of the unified University of London.\nCarpenter was born on 29 Oct 1813 in Exeter, the eldest son of Dr Lant Carpenter, an important Unitarian preacher who influenced a \"rising generation of Unitarian intellectuals\". From his father, Carpenter inherited a belief in the essential lawfulness of the creation: this meant that natural causes were the explanation of the world as we find it. William embraced this \"naturalistic cosmogeny\" as his starting point.\nAlthough qualified medically, he was best known for his work on marine zoology, notably the lower organisms such as Foraminifera and crinoids. These researches gave an impetus to deep-sea exploration, such as the 1868 oceanographic survey with \"HMS Lightning\" and later the more famous Challenger Expedition.\nIn the long term, however, he has become known as a founder of idea of the adaptive unconscious. He observed that the human perceptual system almost completely operates outside of conscious awareness. These same observations were also made by Hermann Helmholtz. Perhaps because these views were in conflict with the theories of Descartes, they were neglected for a hundred years. Carpenter noticed that the more he studied the mechanism of thought, the more clear it became that it operates largely outside awareness. He noticed that the unconscious prejudices can be stronger than conscious thought and that they are more dangerous since they happen outside of conscious.\nHe also noticed that emotional reactions can occur outside of conscious until attention is drawn to them:\nHe also asserted both the freedom of the will and the existence of the ego.\nIn the popular mind, he was perhaps better nown for his work against alcoholism, for which he won a prize of 100 guineas. It was one of the first temperance books.\nIn 1856 Carpenter became Registrar of the University of London, and held the office for twenty-three years. He was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath."}

Complaints are pleadings that must be written carefully to properly state the facts and legal basis for the claim. Usually this requires the help of an attorney.\nIn some jurisdictions, specific types of criminal cases may also be started by the filing of a complaint. This is also called a criminal complaint or felony complaint. All criminal cases are prosecuted in the name of the governmental authority. This is the same authority whose criminal laws were broken and who enforces criminal statutes. The government is sometimes called \"the state\", \"the People\" or \"the Crown\" (in Commonwealth realms).

It has a key role in the normal functioning of the brain and nervous system, and for the formation of blood. It is one of the eight B vitamins. \nB12 is normally involved in the metabolism of every cell of the human body, especially DNA synthesis and regulation, but also fatty acid and amino acid metabolism. Fungi, plants and animals (including humans) cannot produce vitamin B12. Only bacteria and archaea have enzymes for its synthesis, although animals can convert it to the version they need. \nMany foods are a natural source of B12 because of bacterial symbiosis. It is produced by some of the gut flora of herbivores. Carnivores, of course, eat herbivores. Also algae and plants get it from symbiosis. So, by one route or another, animals must get vitamin B12 from bacteria (and archaea).\nThe vitamin is the largest and most structurally complicated vitamin. It can be produced industrially only by bacterial fermentation-synthesis.\nVitamin B12 is a group of chemically related compounds, all of which have vitamin activity. It contains the biochemically rare element cobalt sitting in the center of a ring called a corrin ring. In the human body it is converted to the human physiological forms.\nVitamin B12 was discovered by its relationship to pernicious anemia, which is an autoimmune disease. Because an \"intrinsic factor\" is needed for B12 to be absorbed, its lack causes a vitamin B12 deficiency. Many other kinds of vitamin B12 deficiency have since been found."}

Due process balances the power of law of the land and protects the individual person from it. When a government harms a person without following the exact course of the law, this is a due process violation, which offends the rule of law.\nA judiciary process.\nDue process has also been frequently interpreted as limiting laws and legal proceedings. This means that judges\u2014instead of legislators\u2014may define and guarantee basic fairness, justice, and liberty. This interpretation has proven controversial, and is seen as being closer to the concepts of natural justice, and procedural justice used in various other jurisdictions. This interpretation of due process is sometimes expressed as a command that the government must not be unfair to the people or abuse them physically.\nHistory.\nDue process developed from clause 39 of the Magna Carta in England. The Magna Carta called it \"the law of the land\" which became the more modern term due process. When English and American law gradually went in different directions, due process was not upheld in England, but did become part of the Constitution of the United States. It is found in the Fifth Amendment which says \"No person shall\u2026be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,\". It is applied to all states by the Fourteenth Amendment.\nIn other legal systems.\nDue process is not used in contemporary English law. But it recognizes two similar concepts are natural justice and the British constitutional concept of the rule of law. However, neither concept lines up perfectly with the American theory of due process. It contains many implied rights not found in the ancient or modern concepts of due process in England. \nIslamic law provides for due process. It includes the presumption of innocence, the right to remain silent and a fair and public trial before a judge. There is no jury and both parties, the injured party and the accused, usually present their own cases.\nScandinavia gets high ratings by the World Justice Project. They were noted for their criminal justice system including their observance of due process.

In 1995, they appeared in the hit movie \"Clueless\" and in 1997, the band released their most successful album, \"Let's Face It\", which sold over one million copies and spawned the hit single \"The Impression That I Get\", which charted at #1 on the Billboard Modern Rock Songs and entered the top 20 in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia. Although none of the Bosstones' future albums or singles were able to meet with the same kind of success, the band has kept a loyal following and continue to tour and record.\nThe Bosstones briefly disbanded in 2003, though reunited in 2007 to continue touring and recording. The band has released nine studio albums, three EPs and a live album."}

Bede says this was by C\u00e6dmon (flourished 658\u2013680). He was, according to legend, an illiterate herdsman who produced poetry at a monastery at Whitby. This is probably the earliest written Anglo-Saxon poetry we have.\nMuch of the poetry of the period is difficult to date, or even to arrange chronologically. Estimates for the date of the great epic \"Beowulf\" range from AD 608 through to AD 1000, and there has never been agreement. \nIt is possible to identify some key moments. \"The Dream of the Rood\" was written before about AD 700, when parts were carved in runes on the Ruthwell Cross. Some poems on historical events, such as \"The Battle of Brunanburh\" (937) and \"The Battle of Maldon\" (991), seem to have been written shortly after the events, so they can be dated reasonably precisely.\nAnglo-Saxon poetry is known by the manuscripts in which it survives. The most important manuscripts are from the late 10th and early 11th centuries. They are known as the C\u00e6dmon manuscript, the Vercelli Book, the Exeter Book, and the Beowulf manuscript.\n\"Beowulf\" is the only heroic epic to have survived in its entirety, but fragments of others show that it was not unique in its time. Other genres include much religious verse, from devotional works to biblical paraphrase. \nWith one notable exception (the so-called \"Rhyming Poem\"), Anglo-Saxon poetry depends on alliteration for its structure. Any rhyme included is just ornamental."}

They are generally easier to design and easier to build. They usually cost less to build for longer moveable spans. The counterweights in a vertical lift bridges are only required to be equal to the weight of the deck. Bascule bridge counterweights must weigh several times as much as the span being lifted. As a result, heavier materials can be used in the deck, and so this type of bridge is especially suited for heavy railroad use.\nAlthough most vertical-lift bridges use towers, each with counterweights. Some use hydraulic jacks located below the deck. An example is the span bridge at St Paul Avenue in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA. Another design used balance beams to lift the deck with pivoting bascules located on the top of the lift towers. An example of this kind is the La Salle Street Bridge in Chicago, Illinois, USA.\nThe biggest disadvantage to the vertical-lift bridge is the height restriction for ships passing under it.

They follow on from each other. \nThe three original books.\n\"Foundation\" was originally a series of eight short stories published in \"Astounding Magazine\" between May 1942 and January 1950. According to Asimov, the premise was based on ideas set forth in Edward Gibbon's \"The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\".\nAsimov wrote the three books \"Foundation\", \"Foundation and Empire\" and the \"Second Foundation\" in 19501952. They dealt with a remarkable two-part idea. The Foundation was a research project, run by advanced social forecasting and social planning. It is based on the ideas of the character called Hari Seldon. Seldon developed \"psychohistory\". This method predicts the future, but only on a large scale. Seldon foresees the fall of the Galactic Empire, which includes the entire Milky Way, and a dark age lasting 30,000 years before a second great empire arises. \n\"Foundation and Empire\" tells how the Empire was destroyed, and what followed. \nThe Foundation takes over what remains of the Empire, and applies its social science methods. The now peaceful galaxy is disrupted by an unpredictable event. A mysterious person arises. He is known only as \"the Mule\". The Mule is a mutant, and can sense and manipulate the emotions of others, often creating fear. He uses this ability to take over the independent systems bordering the Foundation, and conquers the Galaxy.\n\"Second Foundation\" is about the Mule's search for the Second Foundation, which has been tucked away in a hard-to-find part of the galaxy. As the Mule comes closer to finding it, the mysterious Second Foundation comes out of hiding to face him. It is a collection of the most intelligent humans in the galaxy. Using its strongest minds, the Second Foundation wears down the Mule. His destructive attitude is adjusted to a benevolent one. He returns to rule over his kingdom peacefully for the rest of his life, without any further thought of conquering the Second Foundation.\nThe later books.\nThirty years later, he wrote the sixth and seventh books that tell what happened later. Then he wrote the first and second books that tell what happened before.\nThe books in order of the plot are:\nAn account of the series is as follows:\n10,000 years in the future, all humans in the Galaxy live in an empire, ruled by an Emperor on the planet Trantor. Dr. Hari Seldon, a mathematician , arrives on Trantor to give a talk. He has an idea that the history of the human race can be predicted by mathematics, but the problem is too much for him alone. Seldon can see that the fall of the empire is coming and wants to help preserve the science of humans.\nWith the assistance of Dors Venabili, Yugo Amaryl and many others, Seldon spends his whole life to create a \u2018Foundation\u2019. This foundation is a colony of scientists on Terminus, which is an isolated planet far away from Trantor. Their job is to become the foundation for a new empire. He is also assisted by Eto Demerzel, a high government official, who is secretly a robot named Daneel Olivaw. Daneel is many thousands of years old. Seldon asks his grand-daughter Wanda, who has unusual mental powers, to help create a secret Second Foundation.\nAfter Seldon\u2019s death, the people on Terminus create new and powerful technology. They take over nearby planets and start trading with other planets. The Foundation fights the armies of the empire that attack them, but as Seldon thought would happen, the empire armies are defeated.\nA mysterious man, known only as the Mule, has begun taking over planets belonging to the Foundation with his armies. No-one has seen him and no one knows how he manages to conquer them. Ebling Mis, a scientist, thinks he has discovered the reason; the Mule has mental powers that help him to make his enemies loyal to him. Mis has also discovered where the Second Foundation is located, but dies before he can tell anyone. \nThe leader of the secretive Second Foundation, who also has strong mental powers, comes face-to-face with the Mule, and adjusts his mind so that he will not conquer anymore and will leave the Foundation alone.\nGolan Trevize, a politician on Terminus, travels by spaceship with Janov Pelorat, to find the Second Foundation. They visit many planets but find no evidence of it. But Pelorat thinks that it may exist on the planet known as Earth. \nMeanwhile, Stor Gendibal, a prominent member of the Second Foundation, discovers that people with mental powers \u2013 known as Mentalics \u2013 exist. They are a force as powerful as the Mule was, and more powerful than even the Second Foundation. \nTrevize and Pelorat discover a planet called Gaia, which is inhabited solely by Mentalics. Trevize is made to decide what the future of the galaxy will be. Gaia plans to absorb the entire Galaxy into one shared intellect. Gendibal is sent back home to the Second Foundation, which is actually secretly based on Trantor.\nTrevize and Pelorat continue with the search for Earth with an inhabitant of Gaia known as Bliss. They search for a long time and eventually discover Earth. Earth no longer has any people living on it. They travel to the Earth's satellite, known as the Moon. There they meet a robot called Daneel Olivaw.\nOlivaw explains that he has been guiding human history for thousands of years, and that he helped Seldon to set up the original Foundation. This is how the Seldon plan has remained on course. Olivaw tells them that his electronic brain cannot last much longer and that he is going to die. He explains that he must combine his mind with an organic (human) mind before this happens.\nIsaac Asimov planned to continue the stories, but was unable to do so. Other authors have written stories to suggest what happened next."}

A diameter would cut the orbit into equal parts, but the plane through the sun parallel to the equator of the earth cuts the orbit into two parts with areas in a 186 to 179 ratio, so the eccentricity of the orbit of the Earth is approximately\nwhich is close to the correct value (0.016710219) (see Earth's orbit).\nThe calculation is correct when perihelion, the date the Earth is closest to the Sun, falls on a solstice.

It was not recognized by UEFA because it had a team that was banned from UEFA competitions, Rangers F.C.. Since there was no stadium chosen to host the game, they played one match at one team's stadium, and one match at the other's. In 1973, the first Super Cup final to be recognized by UEFA was played between Ajax and Milan. On aggregate (the added score from the 2 matches), Ajax won 6-1.\nIn 1991, the UEFA Super Cup between Manchester United and Red Star Belgrade was only played at Old Trafford (Manchester United's stadium) because of the war in Yugoslavia. In 1992, the Champions Cup was renamed the UEFA Champions League. In 1995, the European Cup Winners' Cup was renamed the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. The tournament was made the same. In 1998, the tournament was made 1 match with a host stadium. In 1999, The Cup Winners' Cup was ended by UEFA. The last Super Cup to be played with the winner of the Cup Winners' Cup was between Manchester United, winners of the Champions League, and Lazio, the winners of the last ever Cup Winners' Cup. Lazio won 1-0. In the year 2000, the Cup Winners' Cup was replaced in the Super Cup by the UEFA Cup.

Galatasaray won 2-1.\nIn 2009, the UEFA Cup was renamed the UEFA Europa League. The tournament stayed the same.\nTrophy.\nThe UEFA Super Cup trophy is with UEFA at all times. A replica trophy is given to the winning club. Forty gold medals are given to the winning club and forty silver medals to the runners-up.\nThe Super Cup trophy has went through several changes in its history. The first trophy was presented to Ajax in 1973. In 1977, the original trophy was replaced by a plaque with a gold UEFA emblem. In 1987, the next trophy was the smallest and lightest of all the European club trophies, weighing 5 kg (11 lb) and measuring 42.5 cm (16.7 in) in height.

They were sung by pagans at the celebration of the Winter solstice. Later, medieval carols were sung in elaborate formal rituals (such as the Catholic Mass). As they are known today, Christmas carols date back to about the 19th century. The tradition of going from house to house was not a part of Christmas caroling at first. It dates back further to Anglo-Saxon traditions. the word \"wassail\" comes from the Anglo-Saxon toast \"W\u00e6s \u00feu h\u00e6l\", meaning \"be in good health\". Wassailing likely predates the Norman conquest in 1066. The wishing of good fortune to neighbors produced the song \"Here We Come-A-Wassailing\". Another song, \"We Wish You a Merry Christmas\", also comes from the Wassailing tradition. The two forms, singing and wassailing, came together during the Victorian era in England. They produced the modern custom of Christmas caroling. Today Christmas carols are a very known tradition.\nChristmas carols in classical music.\nIn the 1680s and 1690s, two French composers added carols into their works.

It introduces his new characters, the detective Sherlock Holmes and his friend, Dr. John Watson. They became two of the most famous characters in literature.\nConan Doyle wrote the story in 1886, and it was published the next year. Holmes describes the story's murder investigation as his \"study in scarlet\": \"There's the scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty is to unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it\".\nThe story and its main characters attracted little public interest when it first appeared. It was published in \"Beeton's Christmas Annual\" for 1887. Only 11 complete copies of the Annual exist now, and they have considerable value. Although Conan Doyle wrote 56 short stories about Holmes, \"A Study in Scarlet\" is one of only four full-length Holmes novels. The novel was followed by \"The Sign of the Four\", published in 1890.\n\"A Study in Scarlet\" was the first work of detective fiction to have the magnifying glass as an investigative tool.\nPlot.\n1881 Dr John H Watson having received a medical degree is attached to the British army war in Afghastan; however after being badly wounded and stricken with fever, he is sent back to England with a half-pay pension for a year. Finding that he must move to cheaper lodgings, he makes the acquaintance of Sherlock Holmes -an eccentric student of chemistry and crime; this however is a sideline-Holmes real profession is that of a private consulting detective-with an extraordinary memory for both observation and knowledge Holmes can deduce both a persons profession and where they have been. Insepector Lestrade of Scotland Yard asks Holmes to consult him on a murder case. Holmes and Watson go to the scene of the crime-Holmes deduces that the victium Enoch Drebber had been poisoned; that the murderer smoke cigars; was over six feet tall and had a flord complexion, and that a cause of the murder was a woman. Despite a false start-Holmes tries to trap the killer with a fake ring advertisement but fails-a second murder is that the murder victiums secretary Joseph Strangerson who was stabbed in his hotel room. One clue is a small pillbox containing two pills-one harmless and one a poison. Holmes has a cabman try to lift his trunk-and arrests the cabman Jefferson Hope by name as the killer. Taken to Scotland Yard, Hope-who is dying from a weak heart-confesses: over twenty years before he was enguaged to marry the daughter of a wealthy farmer in Salt Lake City Utah; however Strangerson killed the father and Drebber forced the girl to marry him; she died within a month of a broken heart; Hope vowed revenge and after many years traced Drebber and Strangerson to Cleveland Ohio; the now wealthy Drebber had Hope imprisoned; when Hope was released he found that Drebber and Strangerson fled to Europe-; St Petersburg Russia; Cobenhagen Denmark; Paris, France and then to London. Hope got himself hired as a Cabman so he could spy out his query. Drebber and Stragerson split up; the drunken Drebber gets himself thrown out of his boarding house for trying to court the landladys daughter. Hope takes Drebber in his cab to the murder scene and confronts Drebber with his real identity. He then forces Drebber to take a pill while he eats the second one. Drebber dies looking at his wives wedding ring; Hope then goes after Strangerson and offers him the same choice-Starangerson tries to strangle Hope who stabs him. Hope deceides to earn a little more money to go back to America even though he admits he has nothing left to live for having accomplished his revenge] when he hears a Baker Street Irregeler [a gang of boy spies employed by Holmes] inquire for him by name for a cab job. That very night Hopes heart bursts in his cell; after Holmes and Watson read about it in the newspaper Watson begins to write for the public an 18-year career of Holmes consulting work.,"}

He was best known for his popular call and response song \"Ooh Poo Pah Doo\". As a singer, he recorded a successful single. In addition to his original, there have been over 100 cover versions made by other artists.\nEarly life.\nHill was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. While still a teenager, he played drums in local bands. In 1951, while still drumming, he started his own group, the House Rockers. At first, Professor Longhair played piano, then later it was Huey \"Piano\" Smith. Hill got different musicians for the House Rockers in 1958, and started singing.\nCareer.\nThe idea for the song \"Ooh Poo Pah Doo\" began from some music played by a local pianist, who had the nickname Big Four. Hill wrote the lyrics and melody. Over time, while performing it on stage, it became a longer song. Hill also added an opening part written by Dave Bartholomew. In the end, the song became \"a nonsensical yet rollicking call-and-response workout that perfectly captures the energy of French Quarter life...\".\nHill recorded a demo that he shopped to local record labels, finally recording a session at Cosimo Matassa's studio. The record was produced by Allen Toussaint. When it was released in early 1960, it became popular, especially during Mardi Gras in New Orleans. That year, the record sold 800,000 copies and reached the Top 5 in the US \"Billboard\" R&amp;B chart. It was in the Top 30 in the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 pop chart as well. There have been over 100 cover versions of \"Ooh Poo Pah Doo\" recorded and performed live over the years by other popular musicians.\nOther records he made in New Orleans were not as successful. He then moved to California and worked with other musicians from New Orleans, including Harold Battiste and Mac Rebennack. Songs he wrote there were recorded by Ike Turner and Tina Turner, (singing together as \"Ike &amp; Tina Turner\"), Sonny Bono and Cher (singing together as \"Sonny &amp; Cher\") and Willie Nelson.\nLater life and death.\nStil living in California, a 1972 solo album was not successful at all. He ended up living in poverty and had a drinking problem. He moved back to New Orleans in 1977. He continued to drink alcohol and use narcotics. After he was arrested for drunk driving, he could no longer earn money driving his black Cadillac as a taxi. For a while he was homeless. There were several benefit concerts given to try to help him, but he did not recover from his failures.\nHill died of heart and renal failure in New Orleans in September 1996. He was 63. He is buried in Holt Cemetery in New Orleans, in a grave for the poorest citizens of the city.\nFamily.\nTwo of his grandsons are James and Troy \"Trombone Shorty\" Andrews. The pair performed \"Ooh Poo Pah Doo\" in Episode 7 of the HBO series \"Treme\". A third grandson, Travis \"Trumpet Black\" Hill, also performed as a trumpet player in New Orleans.

It is usually for sexual reproduction. Some definitions limit the term to pairing between animals. Other definitions extend the term to crossing in plants and fungi. It is usual for mating in plants or fungi to be called cross-fertilization, or \"crossing\" if the offspring have DNA from both genetic sources. \nCopulation is the union of the sex organs of two sexually reproducing animals for internal fertilization. Fertilization is the actual fusion of gametes.\nMating may also lead to external fertilization. This is done by amphibians, most fish, many lower animals, and plants. Many aquatic species just spread their eggs and sperm in the water at one specific time of year. That time varies between species. \nFor some hermaphroditic species, copulation is not needed because the parent organism can self-fertilize (autogamy). In some flowering plants self-pollination can happen within the same flower, and some hermaphrodite animals self-fertilize. Many gastropods are hermaphrodite, and do simultaneous copulation in pairs. So do earthworms. \nIn some birds, mating includes behaviors such as nest-building and feeding offspring. The human practice of artificial insemination of domesticated animals is part of animal husbandry."}

Its lyrics were written by American folk singer Woody Guthrie in 1940, based on a melody that already existed. Guthrie's melody was very similar to the melody of \"Oh, My Loving Brother\". This was a Baptist gospel hymn that had been recorded by the Carter Family as \"When the World's On Fire\", and had inspired their \"Little Darlin', Pal of Mine.\" He used the same melody for the chorus and the verses.\nGuthrie did not like Irving Berlin's song \"God Bless America\", sung at that time by Kate Smith. Guthrie was angry with the positive (smug) attitude of the song. He thought it was not realistic and the words sounded too proud of the country. The song was popular and was being played on the radio all the time. Tired of hearing it on the radio, he wrote a response originally named \"God Blessed America For Me\".\nGuthrie rewrote the lyrics and the title over time and the song finally became \"This Land Is Your Land\". He sometimes added more overtly political verses in line with his views of communism than appear in recordings or publications.\nAlthough Gutrie wrote the song in 1940, he did not record it until 1944. The song was not published until 1945, when it was included in a mimeographed booklet of ten songs with typed lyrics and hand drawings. The booklet was sold for twenty-five cents, and was copyrighted in 1951.\nThe first known professionally printed publication was in 1956 by Ludlow Music (now a unit of The Richmond Organization), which administered the publishing rights to Guthrie's song.

It is involuntary: a person cannot control it consciously. Also, it is a in the walls of the heart. It makes up the tissue called the myocardium. \nThe other types of muscle are the skeletal and smooth muscle. The cells that make up cardiac muscle have one (74%) or two (24.5%) nuclei. The myocardium forms a thick middle layer between the outer epicardium layer and the inner endocardium layer.\nCoordinated contractions of cardiac muscle cells in the heart force blood out of the atria and ventricles to the blood vessels of the left/body/systemic and right/lungs/pulmonary circulatory systems. This mechanism illustrates systole (contraction) of the heart.\nCardiac muscle cells, unlike most other tissues in the body, rely on the coronary arteries to deliver oxygen and nutrients and remove waste products directly. There is no time for them to diffuse.\nProblems of the myocardium.\nThe heart muscle can become sick and weak. For example, if a person has very high blood pressure (hypertension), part of the heart muscle can get overworked. The heart muscle becomes bigger and cannot do its job as well. This is called hypertrophy.\nIf a person has a problem with the system that controls the heart, the heart muscle may not beat the way it needs to. It may beat too slowly to get blood out to the body (this is called bradycardia). Or it may beat so fast that the heart does not have time to fill with blood and then squeeze the blood out to the body. This is called tachycardia (there are many kinds).\nThe heart gets blood through the coronary arteries. These are special blood vessels that carry blood only to the heart. In order to do its job, the heart muscle needs a constant supply of blood and oxygen from the coronary arteries. If these coronary arteries get blocked, blood flow to the heart muscle can stop. Without blood flow, the heart muscle gets no oxygen. If this lasts long enough, the part of the heart muscle which is not getting enough oxygen dies. This is called a myocardial infarction, or a heart attack."}

It is the second generation of the Harrier Jump Jet family. It is capable of vertical or short takeoff and landing (V/STOL). The aircraft was designed in the late 1970s as an Anglo-American development of the British Hawker Siddeley Harrier, the first operational V/STOL aircraft. It can hover like a helicopter but can also fly like a jet at near supersonic speeds. It is named after the a bird of prey. It is primarily used on light attack or multi-role missions. These range from close air support of ground troops to armed reconnaissance. The AV-8B is used by the United States Marine Corps (USMC), the Spanish Navy, and the Italian Navy. A variant of the AV-8B, the British Aerospace Harrier II, was developed for the British military. Another is the TAV-8B, is a dedicated two-seat trainer.\nThe project that eventually led to the AV-8B's creation started in the early 1970s. It was a cooperative effort between the United States and United Kingdom (UK). it was aimed at working on solving the problems of the first-generation Harrier. Early efforts centered on a larger, more powerful Pegasus engine to improve the Harrier's performance. The UK dropped out of the project in 1975.\nFollowing the withdrawal of the UK, McDonnell Douglas extensively redesigned the earlier AV-8A Harrier to create the AV-8B. While retaining the general layout of its predecessor, the aircraft uses a new wing, an elevated cockpit, a redesigned fuselage, one extra hardpoint per wing, and other structural and aerodynamic changes. The aircraft is powered by an upgraded version of the Pegasus, which gives the aircraft its V/STOL ability. The AV-8B made its maiden flight in November 1981 and entered service with the USMC in January 1985. Later upgrades added a night-attack capability and radar. This resulted in the AV-8B(NA) and AV-8B Harrier II Plus, respectively. An enlarged version named Harrier III was also studied, but was not built. The UK, through British Aerospace, re-joined the improved Harrier project as a partner in 1981. After corporate mergers in the 1990s, Boeing and BAE Systems have jointly supported the program. Approximately 340 aircraft were produced in a 22-year production program that ended in 2003."}

The main village is located 5\u00a0miles (8\u00a0km) north-east of Eastbourne, one mile (1.6\u00a0km) inland from Pevensey Bay. The settlement of Pevensey Bay forms part of the parish. It was here that William the Conqueror first landed on and invaded England in 1066 after crossing the English Channel from Normandy, France.\nName.\nThe name \"Pevensey\" was first recorded in 947 as \"Pefenesea\", meaning \"River of [a man named] Pefen\". It comes from the Anglo-Saxon personal name \"Pefen\" plus \"e\u00e3\", meaning \"river\". This is probably a reference to the now largely silted-up marshes.\nHistory.\nIn the 290s the Romans built a fort at Pevensey, which they named Anderitum. In 471 Saxons attacked Pevensey and the fort was abandoned for centuries. When William the Conqueror invaded England in September 1066, he landed at Pevensey. The bay provided a safe haven for his fleet of 700 ships. The English army had been awaiting Duke William's arrival on the south coast all summer. With supplies running short King Harold allowed his soldiers to return home. When Harald Hardrada the king of Norway invaded northern England in late September, King Harold gathered his army and moved north to York, 250 miles away, to meet the invaders. William, meanwhile, moved his army and fleet to Hastings and built a castle while he awaited Harold and his army. \nAfter the Battle of Hastings the Roman fort at Pevensey was occupied by the Normans. It was given to Robert, Count of Mortain (William's half brother). Robert de Mortain built his castle there. The castle was besieged several times during the 11th\u201313th centuries. Queen Elizabeth I ordered that it be demolished but the order was ignored. As late as 1942 small additions were made to the castle for the defence of Britain. It became a lookout over the channel for German aircraft during World War II. Today the castle is in the upkeep of English Heritage. "}

In some places, the appellate court has limited powers of review. \"Generally speaking, an appellate court's judgment provides 'the final directive of the appeals courts as to the matter appealed, setting out with specificity the court's determination that the action appealed from should be affirmed, reversed, remanded or modified'\"."}

In a letter dated November 7, Zhou told Nehru that the LAC consisted of \"the so-called McMahon Line in the east and the line up to which each side exercises actual control in the west\". During the Sino-Indian War (1962), Nehru claimed not to know where the line was: \"There is no sense or meaning in the Chinese offer to withdraw twenty kilometers from what they call 'line of actual control'. What is this 'line of control'? Is this the line they have created by aggression since the beginning of September? Advancing forty or sixty kilometers by blatant military aggression and offering to withdraw twenty kilometers provided both sides do this is a deceptive device which can fool nobody.\" It should be noted that these incursions were in response to India's \"forward policy\" in which India began to contest areas controlled by China, including some that were not included in the McMahon Line."}

Scholars believe they first settled in the Amazon rainforest. Later, they started to move to the south and settled on the Atlantic coast.\nHistory.\nThe Tup\u00ed people were living in almost all of the Brazilian coast when the Portuguese first arrived there. In 1500, their population was estimated to be 1 million people. They were divided into tribes, each tribe numbering from 300 to 2,000 people. Some of these tribes are: \"Tupiniquim\", \"Tupinamb\u00e1\", \"Potiguara\", \"Tabajara\", \"Caet\u00e9s\", \"Temimin\u00f3\", \"Tamoios\".\nThe Tup\u00ed had agriculture. They grew cassava, corn, sweet potatoes, beans, peanuts, tobacco, squash, cotton and many other crops.\nEuropean colonization.\nAfter the 16th century, the Tup\u00ed were assimilated, made to work as slaves, or killed by diseases such as smallpox or by Portuguese settlers and Bandeirantes (colonial Brazilian scouts). Except for a few communities, nearly all the Tup\u00ed were killed. Today, the descendants of the survivors live on Indian reservations or are part of the dominant Brazilian society.\nCannibalism.\nThe Tup\u00ed were divided into several tribes which would constantly engage in war with each other. In these wars, the Tup\u00ed would try to capture their enemies to later kill and eat them.\nThey believed that they would gain the strength of the warriors they eat. The Tup\u00ed also ate the remains of dead relatives.\nCannibalism by the Tup\u00ed decreased after European contact and religious intervention. When Cabeza de Vaca, a Spanish conquistador, arrived in Santa Catarina in 1541, for instance, he attempted to ban cannibalism.\nSome scholars question whether the Tup\u00ed actually engaged in cannibalism. They do not think the sources that talk about cannibalism, mostly written by Europeans, are reliable.\nRace-mixing and \"Cunhadismo\".\nIn the 16th century, the Tupi were the first group to have contact with the Portuguese. The Portuguese colonists did not bring many women, so miscegenation between Portuguese settlers and indigenous women started. The Tupi had a tradition, called \"Cunhadismo\", of incorporating strangers to their community. The Indians offered the Portuguese an Indian girl as wife. Once he agreed, he formed a bond of kinship with all the Indians of the tribe. The settlers also adopted the Indian practice of polygyny.\nThe relatives of an Indian woman would have to work for her husband. If a settler had many Indian wives, he would have a large number of Indian relatives who would have to work for him. They would mostly have to cut wood and take it to the ships on the coast. Since there were not a lot of Portuguese women in Brazil, intermarriage made it easier for the Portuguese to colonize the country.\nInfluence in Brazil.\nAlthough most of the Tup\u00ed population died, a large population with Tup\u00ed-Portuguese ancestry occupied much of Brazilian territory. They continued the ancient Tup\u00ed traditions in several points of the country. Darcy Ribeiro wrote that the first Brazilians looked more like the Tup\u00ed than the Portuguese. The language that they spoke, called Nheengatu or L\u00edngua Geral, was based on Tup\u00ed.\nEventually, Brazilian society started to lose its Tupi characteristics. L\u00edngua Geral was replaced by the Portuguese language. Indian ways of making things were replaced by European ones. Brazilian Portuguese absorbed many words from Tupi."}

His father, Andrew Skumin, was a KGB officer. The family many times moved from one city to another. These cities were Penza, Chelyabinsk, Petrozavodsk.\nSkumin studied medicine at the Kharkov National Medical University. He graduated the university in 1973 with diploma with honours.\nIn 1976, he became a psychotherapist in Kiev Institute of Cardiovascular Surgery. Skumin was the first to described a previously unknown disease, now it is called \"Skumin syndrome\".\nFrom 1980 to 1990, he has been professor of psychotherapy at the Kharkov Medical Academy of Postgraduate education. During this period Skumin investigated borderline mental disorders in chronic diseases of the digestive system in children and adolescents.\nFrom 1990 to 1994, Skumin held positions as Professor by the Chair of Psychology and Pedagogy, and Professor by the Chair of Physical Education and Health life at the Kharkov State Academy of Culture. In 1994, Skumin became President of the World Organization of Culture of Health (WOCH) \u2014 International social movement \"To Health via Culture\" (Russian: \u041c\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0443\u043d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0301\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0301\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u0414\u0432\u0438\u0436\u0435\u0301\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u00ab\u041a \u0417\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0301\u0432\u044c\u044e \u0447\u0435\u0301\u0440\u0435\u0437 \u041a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0443\u0301\u0440\u0443\u00bb).\nIn 1995, Skumin became the first editor-in-chief of the journal \"To Health via Culture\". This journal of the World Organisation of Culture of Health (\u2033World Health Culture Organization\u2033) received an International Standard Serial Number (ISSN) 0204-3440. The main topics of the magazine are the dissemination of ideas of Culture of Health, holistic medicine, and Buddhism.\nIn the Russian Orthodox Church the social activities of this international organization qualifies as an ideology of the New Age.\nSkumin's doctrine of the culture of health.\nIn 1968, when Skumin was still a medical student, he proposed the term \u2033culture of health\u2033 (Russian: \u2033\u041a\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0443\u0301\u0440\u0430 \u0417\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0301\u0432\u044c\u044f\u2033), which has become widespread. The main task of the culture of health is to do health programs that support a holistic approach to physical, mental and spiritual well-being.\nThe 'culture of health' means recognizing health\u2019s central importance in life. Skumin referred to the works of Helena Blavatsky, Helena and Nicholas Roerich, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, and Alexander Chizhevsky. In some of his publications, he argues that the culture of health will play an important role in the creation of a human spiritual society in the Solar System.\nThe doctrine of a culture of health, proposed by Skumin, the culture \u2013 spiritual, mental, and physical \u2013 determines the status of human health. And health \u2013 spiritual, mental, physical \u2013 is a prerequisite for achieving a higher level of culture.\nSkumin syndrome.\n\"Skumin syndrome\" () was described by Skumin in 1978 as a \"cardioprosthetic psychopathological syndrome\", associated with mechanical heart valve implant and manifested by irrational fear and sleep disorder. Patients have doubts about the reliability of the device, fear of breakdown, and suffer anxiety and depression. This syndrome is often accompanied by asthenia.\nAlain Carpentier \u2013 a member of the French Academy of Sciences and the head the Department of Cardiovascular Surgery at the H\u00f4pital Europ\u00e9en Georges-Pompidou in Paris \u2013 believed in 2011 that Skumin syndrome develops in a quarter of the patients with an artificial heart valve. It is possible that a similar problem arises in the conduct of operations to implement an artificial heart.\nSkumin mind control method.\nIn 1979, Skumin created a special modification of mind control method for psychological rehabilitation of patients. \nThis method is based on autogenic training. Autogenic training is a relaxation technique developed by the psychiatrist Johannes Heinrich Schultz. He emphasized parallels to techniques in yoga and meditation. It is a method for influencing one's autonomic nervous system. The technique involves the daily practice of sessions that last around 15 minutes, usually in the morning, at lunch time, and in the evening. During each session, the practitioner will repeat a set of visualisations that induce a state of relaxation. Each session can be practiced in a position chosen amongst a set of recommended postures.\nThe technique of the Skumin mind control method (Russian: \"\u041f\u0441\u0438\u0445\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0301\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0433 \u043f\u043e \u0421\u043a\u0443\u0301\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0443\") involves the use of two standard postures: sitting meditation and lying down meditation. This method of psychotraining includes five psychological exercises: the first is \"the relaxation\", the second one is \"the warming\", the third one is \"the zero gravity\", the fourth one is \"the target autosuggestion\", and the fifth exercise is \"the psychological activation\". Each session contain explanation of the theory and practice of each new exercise as it is reached. \nThe therapeutic effect of the Skumin mind control method is achieved by the neutralization of traumatic emotional experiences and the progressive reorganization of the psychic structures to include previously unacceptable mental contents, too. This method of psychotherapy has found application in medical practice, in particular in the treatment of phobias, headaches, etc.\nSkumin\u2019s mixture.\nSkumin proposed mixture subsequently named after him. \"Skumin\u2019s mixture\" () is a medicine with a sedative effect, affecting the central nervous system. It is used to treat Skumin syndrome, light forms of heart failure, anxiety and sleep disorders, and asthenia. The medicine is known to be well tolerated, with no contra-indications, except sensitivity. The formula contains Adonis vernalis, Crataegus, Valerian root, Leonurus cardiaca, Eucalyptus, Peppermint, and Rose hip.\nHis works.\nSkumin wrote many books and articles on a variety medical and spiritual topics advocating a holistic approach to health. He is the author or co-author of a series illustrated books on the culture of health, yoga, Roerich\u2019s philosophy, and Buddhism. \nHe is the author of music and lyrics of several songs. Among them:\nSkumin was important in the Western transmission and revival of Theravada Buddhism. Today Theravada Buddhists, who are also known as Theravadins, number over 100 million worldwide; in recent decades Theravada has begun to take root in the West and in the Buddhist revival in Nepal."}

It is possible to win a wrongful death lawsuit even if the person is acquitted of a crime that caused the death, because even though both trials may use the same evidence a wrongful death case has a lower standard of proof.\nThe claim is brought in a civil action, usually by close relatives, based on tort laws.

It uses multiple layers of security controls (defenses) placed throughout an information technology (IT) system. The multiple layers are not of the same security tool. It uses several different kinds of security with each protecting against a different security attack.\nBackground.\nDefense in depth is originally a military strategy. It seeks to delay rather than prevent the advance of an attacker by yielding space to buy time. The National Security Agency (NSA) changed the concept to be a approach to information and electronic security.\nThe placement of protection mechanisms, procedures and policies is intended to increase the dependability of an IT system. Multiple layers of defense can prevent espionage. They also prevent direct attacks against critical systems. In terms of computer network defense, defense in depth measures should not only prevent security breaches but also buy an organization time to detect and respond to an attack.\nOnion model.\nDefense in depth has long been explained by using the onion as an example of the various layers of security. The outer layer contains the firewall. Middle layers contain various controls. The data is in the center protected by the other defenses.\nA newer concept is the kill chain. Borrowed from the military it is a method of detecting and breaking an opponent's kill chain. Lockheed Martin adapted this concept to information security, using it as a method for modeling intrusions on a computer network. \nRelated pages.\nUsing more than one of the following layers constitutes defense in depth."}

Because of this, French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande announced a national state of emergency. In his speech of 14 November, Hollande said that 128 people were killed and another 128 were gravely injured.\nIn total, over 350 people were injured during the attacks, about 100 of them are gravely injured. One of the attacks was at the Paris stadium, one of the others was at a theatre. The others six were at well known places in the city. At least seven people were involved in the attacks: seven were suicide bombers, one was shot by police.\nThe next day, November 14, ISIS claimed responsibility of the attacks. The leader of the attacks was Belgian terrorist Abdelhamid Abaaoud. He was killed in a police raid on 18 November.\nBackground.\nFrance had been on high alert for terrorist threats since the \"Charlie Hebdo\" shooting in early January 2015 and other related incidents during the January 2015 \u00cele-de-France attacks. France had also increased security in anticipation of the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, scheduled to be held in Paris from 30 November to 11 December 2015, and had restored border checks the week before the attacks.\nThe \"Charlie Hebdo\" shooting in January 2015 occurred in the 11th arrondissement of the city, where the Bataclan theatre is situated. Other attacks in France also took place, such as the stabbing of 3 military men in Nice who were guarding a Jewish community center, the Saint-Quentin Fallavier attack and the 2015 Thalys train attack.\nIslamic State and their branches have claimed responsibility for numerous deadly attacks within the weeks leading up to the attacks. On 12 November 2015, twin suicide bombings took place in Beirut, Lebanon, killing 43 people. On 31 October 2015, Metrojet Flight 9268, carrying mostly Russian passengers crashed in the Sinai in Egypt, killing 224 people. Islamic State's Sinai branch claimed responsibility.\nAlso, during the day of the attacks, ISIL's lead executioner Jihadi John was reported to have been killed by a U.S. drone strike and had lost the Battle of Sinjar to Kurdish forces.\nAttacks.\nSeven distinct attacks took place, comprising six shootings and three explosions. The explosions occurred near the Stade de France, while shootings were reported in the vicinity of Rue Alibert, Rue de la Fontaine-au-Roi, Rue de Charonne, the Bataclan theatre in Boulevard Voltaire, Avenue de la R\u00e9publique, and the Boulevard Beaumarchais.\nIt is likely that three teams carried out the coordinated series of attacks.\nAttackers.\nThe Islamic State officially claimed responsibility for the attacks on the morning of 14 November, praising their \"eight brothers\" led by Abdelhamid Abaaoud on the death of \"at least 200 'crusaders'\" and claiming that \"this was only the beginning of the storm.\"\nThe people who committed the crime were:\nThe exact number of attackers is currently unclear; certain media speak of seven, others of eight attackers. Police think there might be 3-5 attackers who survived, and are on the run. About ten people were taken in police custody in Brussels, as they might have connections to the attacks. The ringleader of the attack, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, was killed in a police raid in France on 18 November.\nAftermath.\nPresident Fran\u00e7ois Hollande issued a statement asking the French people to remain strong in the face of such incidents. Hollande also visited the Bataclan theatre and vowed to \"mercilessly\" fight against terrorism. Hollande also chaired an emergency meeting of the French Cabinet that night, and organized his national security council to meet the next morning. The authorities urged the residents of Paris to stay indoors for their own safety. Hollande also cancelled his trip to the 2015 G-20 Antalya summit because of the attacks, instead sending Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and Finance Minister Michel Sapin as his representatives.\nOn 14 November, President Hollande announced three national days of mourning. Later that day, some of the names of the dead were released:\nReactions.\nPope Francis has condemned the attacks. He said that violence would not solve problems, and that the attacks could not be justified from a religious or humanitarian point of view. Representatives of Islam in France have also condemned the attacks, as did those of the Jewish community. Iranian president Hassan Rouhani cancelled his trip to France, and called the attacks a crime against humanity.\nThere are reports of isolated acts against Muslim institutions: Red crosses were found on a mosque in Cr\u00e9teil, near Paris, the day after the attacks. A man of North African descent was attacked during a series of demonstrations of a right-wing group against illegal immigration."}

As far as can be determined they were bred from the Gray Wolf Spitz, the German poodle (pudel) and the Wirehaired Pinscher. About the middle of the 19th century German dog enthusiasts took an interest in the Schnauzer. Dog breeders experimented by crossing them with other breeds.

For a time he was second in power after William became King of England.\nCareer.\nEarly life.\nOdo was born about 1030. He was the son of William the Conqueror's mother Herleva and Herluin de Conteville. Count Robert of Mortain was his younger brother. \nNorman Conquest and after.\nAlthough he was an ordained Christian cleric, he is best known as a warrior and greedy nobleman. He provided 100 ships for his brother's invasion of England. Odo is one of the very few proven companions of William the Conqueror, known to have fought at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. He probably commissioned the Bayeux Tapestry. In 1067, Odo became the Earl of Kent. For several years he was a trusted royal minister. On some occasions when William was absent (back in Normandy), he served as the \"de facto\" regent of England. At times he led the royal forces against rebellions. There are also other occasions when he accompanied William back to Normandy. During this time Odo acquired vast estates in England. He held land in twenty-three counties, mainly in the southeast and in East Anglia.\nCharacter.\nAs the Earl of Kent he became infamous for being greedy, ruthless and a tyrant. Odo obtained a large fortune in land and gold by plundering the landowners of Kent. One chronicler, Thomas of Marlborough, called him a \"ravening wolf\". Orderic Vitalis, writing nearly a century after Odo's death, he showed him to be a very complex man. On the one hand Odo had great . He was the perfect example of Norman oppression on a conquered England. Yet he was deeply religious and contributed to the al growth of England. Orderic wrote of him:\nFall from grace.\nIn 1076 Odo was placed on trial. He was accused of defrauding the Crown and the Diocese of Canterbury. At the conclusion of the trial he was forced to return a number of properties he had taken. Most of his wealth was redistributed.\nIn 1082, he was suddenly d and put in prison. This time it was for having planned a military expedition to Italy. He wanted to crown himself the Pope. His brother, the king, disapproved of the plan and put a stop to it. Odo spent the next five years in prison in Rouen. His English estates were taken back by the king, as was his office as Earl of Kent. He was allowed to remain the Bishop of Bayeux, however. Odo was released from prison after William died. In 1096 Odo set off on the First Crusade with his nephew, Robert Curthose. He died in Palermo while wintering there in early 1097. He was buried in the Cathedral there."}

Their orbital periods may be related by a ratio of two small integers. It is caused by the changing gravitational forces of bodies which go round each other. The stability of the Solar System was first investigated by Laplace, and there is still much that is not known about it.\nAs a satellite goes round a planet or two stars go round each other, the gravitational forces can change, sometimes hugely. This is partly because orbits are usually ellipses, not circular, and so the forces change accordingly. Also, the planets and stars are usually not spherical. They spin, and vary in their degree of oblateness. This also changes the forces on an orbiting body.\nIn particular, the forces may be unstable, so the smaller partner may change until the forces are stable (do not change with time). Satellites often end up with one face towards their planet, because that is the most stable position (tidal locking).\nThere are other stability effects. Gaps in Saturn's rings are caused by the particles shifting into more stable positions. In the rings of Saturn, the Cassini Division is a gap between the inner B Ring and the outer A Ring. It was cleared by a 2:1 resonance with the moon Mimas. Jupiter makes similar Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt.\nThere is a stability ratio for Neptune and Pluto: the 2:3 ratio means Pluto completes two orbits in the time it takes Neptune to complete three.\nThe area of mechanics which is used for these studies is called celestial mechanics."}

Derogation is different from dispensation (an to a law) in that it applies to the law. A dispensation applies to specific people who are affected by the law.\nIn terms of European Union legislation, a derogation can also imply that a member state delays putting into effect a part of an European Union regulation (etc.) into their own legal system.

A repeal with re- (or ) of the repealed law, or a repeal without replacement. The move to , repeal, or is used in parliamentary procedure to cancel or an action or order previously adopted by the assembly. Removal of secondary legislation is normally referred to as rather than repeal in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Under the common law of England and Wales, the effect of repealing a statute was \"to it completely from the records of Parliament as though it had never been passed.\" This, however, is now subject to savings provisions within the Interpretation Act 1978.\nPartial or full repeals.\nA partial repeal occurs when a specified part or of a previous act is repealed but other provisions remain in force. For example, the Acts of Union 1800, providing for the union between the formerly separate kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland as the United Kingdom, was partially repealed in 1922. This was when (as a consequence of the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty), twenty-six of the thirty-two counties of Ireland were constituted as the Irish Free State, and ceased to be part of the United Kingdom.\nA full repeal occurs where the entire Act in question is repealed.\nRepeal with or without re-enactment.\nA typical situation where an Act is repealed and re-enacted is where the law in the area is being updated but the law being repealed needs to be replaced with one suitable for the modern era. Re-enactment can be with or without amendment. However, repeal and re-enactment without amendment normally occurs only in the context of a Consolidation Bill (a bill to consolidate the law in a particular area).\nFor example the repeal of the Poor Laws in England in 1948 reflected their replacement by modern social welfare legislation.\nA repeal without replacement is generally done when a law is no longer effective, or it is shown that a law is having far more negative consequences than were originally envisioned. Many repeals without replacement are the result of significant changes in society. Major examples include:"}

His kind of surgery is called \"ablative surgery\": in most cases ablative brain surgery does not mean removing brain tissue, but rather destroying tissue and leaving it in place.\nIn 1825, Flourens pioneered the experimental method of ablating parts of the brain in living rabbits and pigeons. He carefully observed their effects. His intention was to find out whether different parts of the brain had different functions.\nFlourens was able to show for the first time that the main parts of the brain were responsible for largely different functions. By removing the cerebral hemispheres, for instance, all perceptions, voluntary action, and judgment were abolished. The removal of the cerebellum affected the animal's equilibrium and motor coordination, while the destruction of the brainstem (medulla oblongata) caused death. These experiments led Flourens to conclude that:"}

Primary legislation consists of Acts of Parliament or statute. Secondary legislation (also called delegated legislation) is the granting of additional law-making powers to another branch of government by an Act or statute. In the European Union, primary and secondary legislation are two of the three processes of law. The third is supplementary law which includes International law and covers any gaps between primary and secondary legislation.\nPrimary legislations.\nIn parliamentary systems, of three branches of government\u2014executive, legislative and judicial\u2014the legislative branch is the most powerful. In other forms of government, such as democracy for example, the three branches of government are equal in power. When a parliament makes a law, called an , it is ing on the other two branches of government. Acts are made by a majority vote of the legislature. The exact process differs in different parliamentary systems. In a bicameral (two-chamber) system there is usually a lower house (such as the House of Commons in the UK) and an upper house (such as the House of Lords). A new law starts out as a bill, usually in the lower house. It must pass both houses before it can become an act. Other systems use a unicameral or one-chamber legislation. In either system, an act becomes the law. Judges and the courts have almost no authority to challenge the validity of a law.\nIn the United States, primary legislation is, at the federal level, an Act of Congress. A statute that s authority or responsibility to an agency is called an \"authorizing statute.\" A law created by the executive branch of the United States Government or that of a state government as the result of primary legislation is called a regulatory law.\nSecondary legislation.\nSecondary (also called subordinate) legislation is all other forms of legislation that are not Acts of Parliament. It is very similar to administrative law in the United States. The legislative branch of governments often delegates power to allow ministers to make secondary legislation. Secondary legislation also includes s, s and decisions by s or s. Most Acts of Parliament in the UK contain s to allow secondary legislation. \nThe two types of secondary legislation are delegated legislation and prerogative legislation."}

Statutes (also called legal codes) provide the authority for other laws. Many state and federal agencies, such as the IRS, EPA and state Secretaries of State may issue regulations for the areas of the law they cover. A statute usually commands something, prohibits something or declares something to be policy. When there is a dispute over the meaning of a statute, a state or federal court may issue a judgment that s the statute more clearly. When this happens it also becomes case law.\nBefore a statute becomes law in some countries, it must be agreed upon by the highest executive in the government. Then it is published as part of a legal code. In many countries, statutes are organized (or codified) for a particular jurisdiction. In many nations statutory law is distinguished from and is to constitutional law."}

This ambitious project is of great importance in the history of mathematics and philosophy. The authors believed that such a project could be done. However, in 1931, G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem proved that \"PM\", and any other attempt, could never reach this goal. For any set of axioms and inference rules proposed, either the system must be inconsistent, or there must in fact be some truths of mathematics which could not be deduced from them.\nOne of the main inspirations and motivations for \"PM\" was the earlier work of Gottlob Frege on logic.\n\"PM\" is not to be confused with Russell's 1903 \"Principles of Mathematics\". \"PM\" states: \"The present work was originally intended by us to be ... a second volume of Principles of Mathematics...

It was formerly part of the sanjak of Siirt, which was in Diyarbak\u0131r vilayet until 1880. It was in Bitlis Vilayet in 1892. Later it became part of Mu\u015f sanjak in Bitlis vilayet. Sason remained part of Mu\u015f until 1927. It was one of the districts of Siirt province until 1993. The boundaries of the district varied considerably in time. The current borders are not the same as in the 19th century. This is when the district of Sasun was situated more to the north (mostly territory now included in the central district of Mu\u015f).\nSasun, as it is called by Armenians, holds a prominent role in Armenian culture and history. It is the setting of \"Daredevils of Sassoun\", Armenia's national epic. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries it was a major location of Armenian \"fedayi\" activities, who staged two uprisings against the Ottoman authorities. They rebelled against the Kurdish tribes in 1894 and 1904.\nHistory.\nHistorically the area was known as \"Sasun\", part of the historical Armenian Highland. Sasun was in the Arzanene province of the ancient Armenian Kingdom. Later the region was ruled by the Mamikonian dynasty from around 772 until 1189/1190. This is when the Mamikonians moved to Cilicia after being forced out by Shah-Armen.\nThe Ottoman period.\nThe region was eventually conquered by the Ottoman Empire, becoming part of the sanjak of Mu\u015f in Bitlis Vilayet, and continued to hold a substantial population of Armenians. During this period, Sason was a federation of some forty Armenian villages, whose inhabitants were known as Sasuntsis (). Surrounded by fierce Kurdish tribes to whom they were often forced to pay tribute, the Sasuntsis were able to maintain an autonomy free of Turkish rule until the end of the 19th century when the Kurds themselves were finally brought under government control. Proud warriors, the Sasuntsis made all their own weapons and relied on nothing from the outside world.\nIn 1893, about three to four thousand nomadic Kurds from the Diyarbak\u0131r area entered the Sason region. This of nomads, who customarily used the mountain meadows of the area in summer for their herds, was harmful to the sedentary Armenians. The Kurds were responsible for bringing economic ruin to the agrarian community of the Armenian villagers. They would steal livestock and demand the Armenians to pay a second tax (that is, a separate tax in addition to the one Armenians paid to the Ottoman government). When Armenians decided to challenge the Kurds, there was a fight and a Kurd was killed. Using the Kurd's death as a reason, Turkish officials allowed a Kurdish attack against the Armenians of Sason.\nThe Kurds, however, were successfully driven off by the armed Armenian villagers. But that success was then seen as a possible threat by the Ottoman authorities. In 1894 the villagers refused to pay taxes unless the Ottoman authorities protected them against more Kurdish attacks and extortions. Instead, the government sent a force of about 3,000 soldiers and Kurdish irregulars to disarm the villagers. This ended in a general massacre of between 900 to 3,000 men, women and children. The \"Sasun affair\" was d by European Powers. This resulted in demands that Ottoman Turkey initiate reforms in the six \"Armenian vilayets\". Abdul Hamid II's response to those demands culminated in the anti-Armenian pogroms of 1895 and 1896.\nAs part of the Hamidian massacres, it is estimated that at least 1,000 Armenian villagers were slain in the Sason atrocity. This was caused by the buildup of Ottoman troops in early 1894. Officials and military officers involved in the Sason massacres were decorated and rewarded.\nModern Sason.\nToday, most of Sason's population is Kurd, Arab, or Zaza. An Armenian minority may still exist (in 1972 there were estimated to be some 6,000 Armenian villagers in the region)."}

The first recorded use of an ironclad was during the Japanese invasion of Korea. Western use of ironclads began about the second half of the 19th century.

These protected the sides and top from bullets, arrows and fire. This allowed his small fleet to be victorious in several battles with the ese fleet. The first Western ironclad battleship, \"Gloire\", was launched by the French Navy in November 1859. The British Admiralty had been considering armored warships since 1856. They prepared a draft design for an armored corvette in 1857. In early 1859 the Royal Navy started building two iron-hulled armored frigates, and by 1861 had made the decision to move to an all-armored battle fleet. After the first clashes of ironclads (both with wooden ships and with one another) took place in 1862 during the American Civil War. It became clear that the ironclad had replaced the unarmored ship of the line as the most powerful warship afloat. This type of ship would come to be very successful in the American Civil War.\nBy the 1870s, ironclads were the main warships of the world's most powerful Navies. But the ironclad era only lasted about 50 years. By the 1890s most sailing ironclads had been replaced by modern battleships."}

More recently a third term, \"lawful orders\", has been used for the same defense. \nPrinciple V.\n\"Any person charged with a crime under international law has the right to a fair trial on the facts and law.\"\nPrinciple VI.\n\"The crimes hereinafter set out are punishable as crimes under international law: \nPrinciple VII.\n\"Complicity in the commission of a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity as set forth in Principle VI is a crime under international law.\""}

They are listed, usually by subject, forming a legal code (a codex or book of law). Codification is the defining feature of civil law jurisdictions.\nHistory.\nAncient Sumer's Code of Ur-Nammu was compiled 2100-2050 BC. It is the earliest known surviving civil code. Three centuries later, the Babylonian king Hammurabi enacted the set of laws named after him.\nReligious laws such as the Torah were codified. Important codifications were developed in the ancient Roman Empire, with the compilations of the Lex Duodecim Tabularum. Much later the Corpus Iuris Civilis was assembled. These codified laws were the exceptions rather than the rule. During much of ancient history the Roman laws were left mostly uncodified.\nThe first \"permanent\" system of codified laws could be found in China. This was with the compilation of the \"Tang Code\" in AD 624. This formed the basis of the Chinese criminal code. This was then replaced by the \"Great Qing Legal Code\". This code was in turn abolished in 1912 following the Xinhai Revolution and the establishment of the Republic of China. The new laws of the Republic of China were inspired by the German codified work, the \"B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch\". A very influential example in Europe was the French Napoleonic code of 1804.\nAnother early system of laws is Hindu law framed by Manu and called as Manu Smriti. They date back to the 2nd century BC. The use of civil codes in Islamic Sharia law began with the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century AD."}

There should, therefore, be no observable irregularities in the large scale structure. The structure is the result of the evolution of the matter field after the Big Bang.\nAstronomer William Keel explains:\nThe cosmological principle is usually stated formally as 'Viewed on a sufficiently large scale, the properties of the universe are the same for all observers.' This amounts to the strongly philosophical statement that the part of the universe which we can see is a fair sample, and that the same physical laws apply throughout.\nThe two testable consequences of the cosmological principle are homogeneity and isotropy. Homogeneity means that the same observational evidence is available to observers at different locations in the universe (\"the part of the universe which we can see is a fair sample\"). Isotropy means that the same observational evidence is available by looking in any direction in the universe (\"the same physical laws apply throughout\"). The principles are closely related, because a universe that appears isotropic from any two (for a spherical geometry, three) locations must also be homogeneous."}

He was the first mixed-race British outfielder in the top division of English football. His professional football career began after he was spotted while playing for his local amateur club, Clapton F.C.. He began playing for Clapton in 1908. Within a few months he had won winners' medals in the FA Amateur Cup, London County Amateur Cup and London Senior Cup. In March 1909 the \"Football Star\" called him \"the catch of the season\".\nTull was brought up in a National Children's Home orphanage in Bethnal Green, London, along with his brother. They were placed there following the death of their parents. He joined Tottenham in 1909 and transferred to Northampton Town in 1911, where he made 111\u00a0first-team appearances.\nDuring the First World War, Tull served in the Footballers' Battalion of the Middlesex Regiment. He fought in the Battle of the Somme in 1916. Tull was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant on 30 May 1917. This was in spite of the fact there was a ban on black people being given that status.\nTull fought in Italy in 1917\u201318. He was noted for his \"gallantry and coolness\" while leading his company of 26\u00a0men on a raiding party into enemy territory. He returned to France in 1918. Tull was killed in action on 25 March during the Spring Offensive. His body was never recovered.\nCampaigners have called for a statue to be erected in his honour. Northampton South MP Brian Binley has campaigned for Tull to be posthumously awarded the Military Cross. He was honoured with a commemorative plaque in London placed close to where he lived. A Walter Tull commemorative coin is part of a set of \u00a35 coins released by the Royal Mint."}

{"id": "522803", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=522803", "title": "Trust law", "text": "In law a trust is a relationship where property is held by one party for the benefit of another party. A trust is created by the owner, also called a \"settlor\", \"trustor\" or \"grantor\" who transfers property to a trustee. The trustee holds that property for the trust's beneficiaries. Trusts exist mainly in common law jurisdictions. They have existed since Roman times.\nBasics of trusts.\nWhen an owner of property places that property into trust, he or she turns over part or all of his or her rights to the trustee. This separates the property's legal ownership and control from its settlor's ownership and benefits. This controls the property and its benefits if the settlor is absent, incapacitated, or dead. Trusts are frequently created in wills, defining how money and property will be handled for children or other beneficiaries.\nThe trustee is given legal title to the trust property, but has an obligation to act for the good of the beneficiaries. The benefits of the trust belong to the beneficiary. The trustee may be compensated and have expenses reimbursed. But the trustee must otherwise turn over all profits from the trust properties. Trustees who don't do this are self-dealing. Courts can reverse self dealing actions, order profits returned, and impose other sanctions.\nThe trustee may be either a individual, a company, or a public body. There may be a single trustee or multiple co-trustees. The trust is governed by the terms under which it was created. In most jurisdictions, this requires a contractual trust agreement or deed.\nAdvantages of a trust may include:\nTestamentary trusts.\nTestamentary trusts transfer property into the trust after the death of the settlor. The trust allows the settlor to specify any conditions and may spread payments from the trust over a period of time. Testamentary trusts are not automatically created when the settlor dies but may be specified in will. Because a testamentary trust is created by a provision of a will, it is necessary for the estate to go through probate.\nLiving trusts.\nA living trust may be more complicated than a testamentary trust. Many people use a living trust to avoid probate, although even with a trust a deceased person's estate will often still include assets that must be probated. You also cannot use living trusts to name guardians for your children, but may designate a guardian in your will.\nLiving trusts may be used to manage property both during the settlor's lifetime and after death. If the settlor becomes incapacitated, disabled by an accident or illness, or is unavailable to manage the property the trustee may manage the property on behalf of the settlor in a manner consistent with the terms of the trust."}

For example, the male great-tailed grackle is 60% heavier than the female. The smallest icterid species is the orchard oriole, in which the female averages 15\u00a0cm in length (6\u00a0in) and in weight, while the largest is the Amazonian oropendola, the male of which measures and weighs about . This variation in size is greater than usual in passerine families. \nOne unusual adaptation shared by the icterids is gaping, where the skull allows them to open their bills strongly rather than passively. This lets them force open gaps to get at hidden food."}

It is made of small metal rings linked together in a pattern to form a mesh. The Celts are usually credited with inventing mail armour. Celtic mail was usually made in the form of a vest.\nEtymology.\nThe origins* of the word \"mail\" are not fully known. One theory is that it originally comes from the Latin word \"macula\", meaning \"spot\" or \"opacity\". Another theory relates the word to the Old French \"maillier\", meaning \u201cto hammer\u201d (related to the modern English word \"malleable\"). A mail shirt is a called a hauberk (haubergeon or byrnie). Mail leggings were called chausses. A mail Hood is called a coif and covered the head, neck and shoulders. \nHistory.\nMany scholars think mail was invented by ancient Celts about the 3rd century BC. At that time their iron work was probably the best in Europe. The Romans quickly adopted it for their own army. A shirt of mail armour weighed about . After a battle it was common practice to strip weapons and armour from the dead. Vikings were known to wear mail armor whenever they could get their hands on it. Mail was expensive, time-consuming to make, and required a supply of iron. It became more expensive as improvements were made in materials and workmanship. Mail armour was in use in Europe until the 15th century.\nModern uses.\nMail is today used in gloves to prevent cuts by butchers and firefighters. Some divers wear mail suits when swimming around sharks and particularly when feeding sharks. But mail is heavy and it makes moving around more difficult. Mail is very popular with history reenactors. It is also popular in live action role playing."}

It is part of the Great Rift Valley in East Africa. \nThe area overlaps the borders of Eritrea, Djibouti and the entire Afar region of Ethiopia. \nHuman fossils.\nImportant fossil specimens of the earliest hominins have been found in this area. These are the earliest of the human clade. The area is thought by some paleontologists to be the cradle of the evolution of humans. \nMany important fossil localities exist in the Afar region. These sites have produced specimens of the earliest (fossil) hominins and of human tool culture, as well as many fossils of flora and fauna.\nGeography.\nThe Triangle includes the lowest point in Africa, Lake Asal, Djibouti, at 155 m (or 509\u00a0ft) below sea level.\nThe Awash River is the main waterflow into the region. It runs dry during the annual dry season, and ends as a chain of saline lakes. The northern part of the Afar Depression is also known as the Danakil Depression. The lowlands are affected by heat, drought, and poor air circulation. Some of the lowlands are the hottest places (year-round average temperatures) of anywhere on Earth.\nThe Afar Triangle is bordered by high areas, as shown on the topographic map.\nPlate tectonics.\nThe Depression is a plate tectonic triple junction. This geologic feature is one of earth's great active volcanic areas, so the floor of the depression is composed of lava, mostly basalt.\nThe continuous process of volcanism makes mineral deposits, like sulfur, salt, bentonite, and gypsum. There are also geothermal energy sources and hot springs in different areas of the region.\nIn 2005, a giant rift was formed in just a few days. The rift opened when the Dabbahu Volcano erupted. The rift is part of the process of the Arabian and African plates moving apart. This new crack, long, and deep, opened when the lava from the erupting volcano flowed underground and cooled. It left a long, wide dike within days."}

It is a high, flat land between 700 meters and 2100 meters above sea level. It is in northeaster Kerala, in the Western Ghat mountains. It is next to the states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Wayanad is about 885.92.km2 forest. Most of the people in Wayanad live in tribes. There are also many Nature Resorts in Wayanad for the travelers with great natural view points with silent atmosphere. Wayandad is one of the biggest foreign exchange earners in Kerala because it makes money-earning crops like pepper, cardamom, coffee, tea, and other spices.\nHistory.\nIn ancient times the Vedar Rajas ruled Wayanad. Later the Pazhassi Raja of the Kottayam Royal Dynasty ruled. Then there was a Mysorean invasion. Later, the British took over India, which lasted for 200 years. The British fought the Pazhassi Rajah. When the state of Kerala started in 1956, Wayanad was part of the Cannannore district. In 1957, south Wayanad was added to Kozhikode district and north Wayanad stayed with Cannannore district. Today's Wayanad was made by putting north Wayanad and south Wayanad together. This happened on November 1, 1980.\nPeople.\nMany Adivasi people live in Wayanad. They are Paniyas, Kurumas, Adiyars, Kurichyas, Ooralis, Kadans, and Kattunaikkans. These are the areas aboriginal tribes, meaning they lived there before other people came to Wayanad. Most of the Kurichyar own small pieces of land, but most of the members of other tribes are labourers and work for other people. Wayanad has the highest Adivasi population of any district in the state, at about 36%. Over the past thirty or forty years, these people have become marginialized, meaning life has become harder for them as other groups of people take more control of the area.\nMany settlers also live in Wayanad. People came to Wayanad from almost all the other parts of Kerala because the farmland is good. Wayanad has a small Jain community made of Gowders who came from Karnataka. They built temples all over the district. There are also many different kinds of Christians living in Wayanad. One fourth of the population of Wayanad is Christian. Another fourth of the population is Muslims, and the rest of the people are Hindus."}

There are two basic systems: Simple, standalone sensors usually make a sound or flash a light when they detect smoke. More sophisticated sensors usually send a signal to an fire alarm panel, or system. Most smoke detectors use either an optical sensor, or they use a physical process called ionization. Many simple smoke sensors use batteries. Very often dead batteries are not replaced; when this happens, the smoke sensors stop working. But, the detector may \"chirp\" when the battery is low to try and stop this from happening. There are also systems which are directly connected to electrical power; these may use batteries just as a backup.\nSmoke detectors are housed in plastic enclosures, typically shaped like a disk about in diameter and thick, but shape and size vary. Smoke can be detected either optically (photoelectric) or by physical process (ionization); detectors may use either, or both, methods. Sensitive alarms can be used to detect, and thus deter, smoking in areas where it is banned. Smoke detectors in large commercial, industrial, and residential buildings are usually powered by a central fire alarm system, which is powered by the building power with a battery backup. Domestic smoke detectors range from individual battery-powered units, to several interlinked mains-powered units with battery backup; with these interlinked units, if any unit detects smoke, all trigger even if household power has gone out.\nDesign.\nPhotoelectric.\nPhotoelectric smoke detectors rely on detecting a lack of light to set the alarm off. The light used could be infrared, visible light, or ultraviolet. When smoke blocks out the light inside a photoelectric smoke detector, the smoke detector detects that there is less light. Below a certain brightness, whether or not it comes from smoke or not, the photoelectric smoke detector will beep.\nIonization.\nIonization smoke detectors use radioactive elements to ionize the air. Alpha particles are released from the radioactive element onto air particles so that those air particles become charged. An ionization smoke detector will detect smoke if there is a change in voltage. If smoke enters the smoke detector, some of the alpha particles will attach to the smoke instead of the air particles. This will change the voltage inside the smoke detector, so the smoke detector will beep.\nIonization smoke detectors are cheaper than photoelectric smoke detectors, but they cause more false alarms than photoelectric smoke detectors. Additionally, ionization smoke detectors are slower to react in real house fires."}

Incumbent President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) won over Republican Thomas E. Dewey in the general election. In the Electoral College, Roosevelt won 432 votes while Dewey won 99. Roosevelt, a Democrat, won an unprecedented fourth term as president.\nThe election was held during the latter part of World War II. By this time the war was going well for the United States and its Allies. Roosevelt had already served longer than any other president, but remained popular. Unlike in 1940, there was little doubt that he would run for another term as the Democratic candidate, as his health was failing. Dewey, the Governor of New York, campaigned against the New Deal and for a smaller government. But he could not convince the country to change course. Roosevelt's aides covered up the fact the president was in poor health. Roosevelt would die in office three months after starting his fourth term. His Vice President, Harry S. Truman, would serve out the remainder of his term of office.\nThe campaign.\nThe Republicans campaigned against the New Deal. They wanted a smaller government and less-regulated economy. Roosevelt's continuing popularity was the main theme of his campaign. To quiet rumors of his poor health, Roosevelt insisted on making a vigorous campaign trip in October and rode in an open car through city streets. A high point of the campaign occurred when Roosevelt gave a speech on national radio where he ridiculed Republican claims that his administration was corrupt and wasteful with tax money. He particularly ridiculed a Republican claim that he had sent a US Navy warship to pick up his Scottish Terrier Fala in Alaska. He added that \"Fala was furious\" at such rumors. The speech was met with loud laughter and applause. In response, Dewey gave a blistering partisan speech in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, a few days later on national radio. He accused Roosevelt of being \"indispensable\" to corrupt big-city Democratic organizations and American Communists. Dewey also referred to members of Roosevelt's cabinet as a \"motley crew\". However, the allies had several battlefield successes in Europe and the Pacific during the campaign. These included the liberation of Paris in August 1944 and the successful Battle of Leyte Gulf in the Philippines in October 1944. These were Roosevelt's greatest assets in his campaign.\nResults.\nThe 1944 presidential election was a milestone in American politics for two reasons. It was the first time a candidate for president was born in the 20th century. It was the last time Democrats carried every state in the southern United States. The election had at least one other long-reaching effect. It led to the 1951 passing of the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution. It prohibits anyone from serving more than two terms as president of the United States."}

It declared independence in 1730 after the Marathas Gaikwad invasion. Muhammad Sher Khan Babi, was the founder of the Babi Dynasty of Junagadh State dynasty. His descendants, the Babi Nawabs of Junagadh, took large territories in southern Saurashtra and ruled over the state for the next two centuries. First they were a tributary state of Marathas. Later they were under the rule of the British Raj.\nIn 1807 the Junagadh State became a British protectorate. The East India Company took control of the state by 1818. The Saurashtra area, with other princely states of Kathiawar, were separately administered under Kathiawar Agency by British India.\nOn 15 August 1947 upon the independence of India, the Nawab of Junagarh decided to merge it into newly formed Pakistan. The Indian government maintained the people of Junagadh should decide. Pakistan waited until 13 September to respond saying they accepted Junagarh's acceptance of Pakistani rule. This caused a general revolt among the Hindu majority of Junagadh as well as protest movements in the surrounding states that had acceded to join India. The Nawab then occupied territory in several of those states claiming he had rule over them. When the Indian government sent a small force to restore order, the Nawab fled to Pakistan. His Dewan (Prime minister) agreed to rule by India. This resulted in the integration of Junagadh into India.\nRulers.\nThe Nawabs of Junagadh belonged to Pathan Babi khel tribe. They were granted a 13 gun salute by the British authorities:\nDispute.\nMany in Pakistan still maintains the 1948 plebiscite and rule by India was an illegitimate action. One of the reasons is because Kashmir at the time was ruled by a Hindu but had a clear Muslim majority. By acceding to India it was the opposite of the situation in Junagadh.\nFor its part India knew Junagadh was the premier state in the western Kathiawar region. It was bound on three sides by states that acceded to India. On the fourth side was bounded by the Arabian Sea. This gave it great strategic importance to both countries. India was not prepared to accept Junagadh's acceding to Pakistan. This would create a Pakistan state in the middle of Indian states. India's taking administrative control of Junagadh to restore order is seen as a pretext by Pakistan. The referendum taken by the people of Junagadh, under the control of the Indian army, was overwhelmingly in favor of Indian rule. Pakistan has never accepted this vote by the people there and believes Junagadh rightly belongs to them.\nPakistan's legitimacy claim.\nPakistan's government has maintained its territorial claim on Junagadh, along with Manavadar and Sir Creek in Gujarat, on its official political map issued on 4th August 2020."}

The gate was built around 1595. Today, the little landmark is in use as a symbol for the German town Flensburg.\nHistory.\nIn 1345 the town of Flensburg began to build its town wall. A gate was built on the north side of the town. It was called \"Norder Porte\". It was replaced by a building in the 16th century called the Nordertor. This marked the northern boundary of the town. It was a checkpoint that was closed in the night.\nOn the north side of the gate are two plaques. The left one shows the royal coat of arms of King Christian IV, 1577-1648 and the Latin words: \u201eRegna Firmat Pietas\u201c \u2014 Piety strengthens the Realms. The right one shows the coat of arms of Flensburg with the German words: \u201eFriede ern\u00e4hrt, Unfrieden verzehrt\u201c \u2014 Peace nurtures, strife devours. There is also a date- 1767. This means that the town gate was restored in the time of Christian VII, 1749-1808.\nAfter 1796 the town grew beyond the town wall. There had been a ban on building outside the wall before then. The Neustadt (\"Newtown\"), in the neighborhood of the Nordertor was built. In 1913 and 1914 it was restored by the architect Paul Ziegler. The Nordertor got a clock. In 1966 the Deutsche Bundespost made a stamp with a picture of the gate on it. It was a 30 Pfennig stamp, used to send letters within Germany. The Nordertor stamps were sold over 3 billion times. In the 1990s the gate was again restored and the clock was removed. In 2004 the gate was licensed as a venue for civil weddings, so that the weddings could be performed since then directly above the archway of the gate."}

Ship's cats have been very popular in history, and date back to ancient times.\nCats have been carried on ships for many reasons - most importantly, to catch mice and rats. On a ship, these rodents can damage ropes and wooden parts of the ship. Once electricity was discovered, rodents would also damage ships' electrical wiring. Also, rodents threatened the ship's cargo - the things it carried. Rodents would eat the food carried to feed the crew. If the ship was carrying things like grain as part of its cargo, rodents could also cause the ship to lose money by eating the cargo. Also, rats and mice spread disease, which is dangerous for ships that are at sea for long periods of time. For example, rat fleas can carry plague, and rats on ships may have been one of the main reasons why the Black Death spread.\nCats naturally attack and kill these rodents. Cats also have a natural ability to get used to new surroundings, so they could get used to serving on ships. They also offered companionship (friendship), a sense of home and security, and lifted sailors' spirits. This was helpful to sailors who could be away from home for long periods, especially in times of war.\nEarly history.\nCats were probably domesticated about 9,500 years ago. Not long after that, people began taking cats aboard boats and ships. The Ancient Egyptians took cats on board Nile boats to catch birds in the thickets along the riverbanks. The ancient Egyptians also carried cats on trading ships to control rodents. Traders from other areas soon started doing the same thing. This led to the spread of cats throughout the world. Cats eventually reached nearly all parts of the world that could be reached by ship. Phoenician cargo ships are thought to have brought the first domesticated cats to Europe in about 900 BC.\nCats and superstition.\nCats in Ancient Egypt were worshipped as deities (powerful spirits). For many centuries, cats have had a reputation as magical animals. Many sailors believed myths and superstitions about cats. Cats were thought of as smart, lucky animals. Sailors usually took very good care of their ship's cats to keep them happy. Some sailors believed that six-toed cats were better at catching pests. They may have thought that extra toes give a cat better balance, which would be important when at sea. In some places, all six-toed cats became known as \"ship's cats\".\nCats were believed to have miraculous powers that could protect ships from dangerous weather. Sometimes, fishermen's wives would keep black cats at home too. They believed that these cats would use their special powers to protect their husbands at sea. Many sailors believed that it was lucky if a cat came up to a sailor on deck, but unlucky if it came only halfway and then turned around. Another popular belief was that cats could start storms through magic stored in their tails. Other sailors also believed that if a ship's cat fell or was thrown overboard, a terrible storm would come and sink the ship, and if the ship was able to survive, it would be cursed with nine years of bad luck. Still other sailors thought that if a cat licked its fur against the grain, it meant a hail storm was coming; if it sneezed, rain was coming; and if it was frisky, wind was coming.\nSome of these beliefs are partly true. Cats can notice slight changes in the weather, because of their very sensitive inner ears. (Their inner ears also allow cats to land on their feet when falling.) Cats often get nervous and restless when they sense low atmospheric pressure, which often comes before stormy weather.\nFamous Ship's Cats.\nBlackie.\nBlackie was HMS \"Prince of Wales\"'s ship's cat. He became famous during the Second World War. Blackie's ship, \"Prince of Wales\", carried Prime Minister Winston Churchill across the Atlantic Ocean to Naval Station Argentia in Newfoundland in August 1941. There, Churchill secretly met with the United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and the two signed the Atlantic Charter. But as Churchill started to leave \"Prince of Wales\", Blackie came up to him. Churchill bent down to say goodbye to Blackie, and the moment was photographed and reported in the world media. In honour of the success of the visit, Blackie was renamed Churchill. Blackie survived the sinking of HMS \"Prince of Wales\" later that year and was taken to Singapore with the survivors. He could not be found when Singapore was evacuated the following year and nobody knows what happened to him (though there is a chance he may have died by then).\nChibbley.\nChibbley was the ship's cat aboard the tall ship \"Picton Castle\". She was rescued from an animal shelter. She circumnavigated the world - sailed all the way around it - five times. Because \"Picton Castle\"\u2019 was a training ship, Chibbley had many visitors. She became a celebrity, and people even sent her fan mail. Chibbley died on November 10, 2011, in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia. She had sailed over 180,000 miles at sea.\nConvoy.\nConvoy was the ship's cat aboard HMS \"Hermione\". He was named \"Convoy\" because he often went with the ship on convoy escort duties (where the ship would sail with a group of other ships for protection). Like the ship's sailors, Convoy was listed in the ship's book, and given a full kit, including a tiny hammock where he would sleep. He was killed along with 87 of his crew mates when \"Hermione\" was torpedoed and sunk on 16 June 1942 by German submarine U-205.\nEmmy.\nEmmy was the ship's cat on RMS \"Empress of Ireland\". She was an orange tabby cat who never missed a voyage. However, on 28 May 1914, Emmy tried to escape the ship. The crew could not get her to return to the ship, and \"Empress of Ireland\" left without her. This was thought to be a very bad sign. Early the next morning, \"Empress of Ireland\" ran into SS \"Storstad\" while sailing through fog at the mouth of the St. Lawrence River. \"Empress of Ireland\" sank quickly, killing over 1,000 people.\nFelix.\nFelix was the ship's cat aboard \"Mayflower II\" when she set sail from Devon, England, to Plymouth, Massachusetts, in 1957. The goal of this voyage was to show cooperation between the UK and the US after World War II. Felix was given his own life jacket for the trip. During the voyage, he broke one of his paws. The paw was set by the ship's doctor. After Felix returned to the US, photos and stories about him appeared in \"National Geographic\" magazine, \"Life\" magazine, and \"Yankee\" magazine. The cat and the rest of the crew marched in a New York ticker tape parade and toured the East Coast that summer. Felix was eventually adopted by the cabin boy's girlfriend, Ann Berry, and settled in Waltham, Massachusetts. The captain of the Mayflower II wrote a children's book about Felix called \"Felix and his Mayflower II Adventures\". The book was published during the celebration of the ship's fiftieth anniversary at Plimoth Plantation.\nMrs. Chippy.\nMrs. Chippy was the ship's cat aboard \"Endurance\", the ship used by Sir Ernest Shackleton for his Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition. (The Expedition's goal was to cross the Antarctic by land.) After about a month, the crew realized that \"Mrs. Chippy\" was actually a male cat. However, by then, everyone was used to the name \"Mrs. Chippy,\" and kept using it.\nThe ship became lost, trapped and then crushed in pack ice. At that point, Shackleton ordered his men to shoot the sled dogs and Mrs. Chippy, because he did not think they could survive.\nSimon.\nSimon was the ship's cat of HMS \"Amethyst\" during the Yangtze Incident in 1949, during the Chinese Civil War. During the Yangtze Incident, the HMS \"Amethyst\" was attacked and was trapped on the Yangtze River for months. The ship and its crew were badly hurt in the attacks on the ship. These attacks killed 25 of \"Amethyst\"\u2019s crew, including the commanding officer. Simon was also hurt in the attacks, but soon he recovered. He started killing rats again, which was very important since the rodents had been destroying the ship. Simon also did the important job of keeping up the crew's spirits.\nAfter the \"Amethyst\" finally escaped the Yangtze River and returned to Britain, Simon was given the rank of 'Able Seacat' Simon. He became a celebrity. However, not long after he returned to Britain, he died from an infection. Many people sent tributes to honor Simon, and his obituary appeared in \"The Times\" (an important newspaper in London). After Simon's death, he was awarded the Dickin Medal. He is the only cat ever to earn this award. Simon was also buried with full naval honors.\nTrim.\nTrim sailed on many ships commanded by Matthew Flinders during 1801-1803. These ships' goals were to circumnavigate (sail all the way around) Australia, and also to create maps of its coastline. Trim became a favourite of the crew, and was the first cat to circumnavigate Australia. Trim stayed with Flinders until Trim's death. A statue to Trim was later built in his honor. It sits on a window sill on the outside of the State Library, in Sydney, Australia. There have also been many books written about Trim.\nU-boat.\nU-boat was another ship's cat aboard a Royal Navy ship in the Second World War. Whenever his ship came into port, U-boat would take shore leave (he would leave the ship to do things on shore). He would spend days on shore, and usually would return only just before his ship sailed away. One day, U-boat did not return in time for roll call and his ship was forced to sail away without him. As the ship pulled away, U-boat was seen running down the dock after the sailing ship. He made a death-defying leap onto the ship and made it aboard. The crew thought that he seemed unafraid by what had just happened, and calmly started to wash himself on deck. The crew members were very happy that U-boat had come back, since they thought he brought them good luck.\nUnsinkable Sam (Oscar).\nOscar was the ship's cat of the German battleship \"Bismarck\". When \"Bismarck\" was sunk on 27 May 1941, only 116 sailors out of over 2,200 survived. Oscar was picked up by the destroyer HMS \"Cossack\". \"Cossack\" herself was torpedoed and sunk on 24 October, 1941. 159 sailors were killed, but Oscar again survived to be rescued, and was taken to Gibraltar. He became the ship's cat of HMS \"Ark Royal\". Then this ship, too, was torpedoed and sunk in November of 1941. Oscar was again rescued, and it was decided that it was time for him to have a home on land. By now, Oscar had been renamed \"Unsinkable Sam.\" He was given a new job as mouse-catcher in the Governor General of Gibraltar's office buildings. He eventually returned to the UK and spent the rest of his life at the 'Home for Sailors'. A portrait of him hangs in the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich.\nShip's cats today.\nStarting in 1975, the Royal Navy no longer allowed cats or any other pets to ride on any Royal Navy ships. This rule was created because of concern about hygiene (cleanliness).\nCats still ride on many private ships today. For example, \"Toolbox\" is a ship's cat who rides on the second \"Kalmar Nyckel\".\nAmerican sailor Robin Lee Graham sailed with many cats on his ships \"Dove\" and \"Return of Dove\", while he was trying to circumnavigate the world by himself (starting in 1965)."}

Leaves are oval to round, 13\u201315 cm (5\u20136 in), with an open sinus at the leaf base where it attaches to the petiole (leaf stem). Leaves may spread 1.4\u20131.5 m (4\u20135 feet) from where the rhizome is rooted. Flowers, which have little fragrance, are star-shaped with 4 sepals and 10\u201316 petals, and are 5\u201313 cm (2\u20135 in) in diameter. Although leaves float on the water surface, flowers are generally held 30 cm (12 in) above water. They are usually pale blue (but can be pink or white) with pale yellow stamens and anthers. \n\"N. nouchali\" has been cultivated in southeast Asia for centuries, especially around temples. It is also cultivated in Sri Lanka and gathered from dried ponds in the Republic of India for the rhizomes, which are used as food and animal fodder as a source of starch. In Ayurvedic medicine, it is used to treat indigestion.\nCultivars include N. stellata var. cyanea, which has medium-sized pale to deep blue flowers, and N. stellata var. versicolor, which is commonly exported in the form of tubers from Sri Lanka to Europe and the U.S. for use in the aquariums; the tubers grow quickly after exposure to warm water, making an \u201cinstant\u201d aquarium plant.\nSymbolism.\n\"N. stellata\" was the state flower of Hyderabad Deccan.

Breath sounds are also called lung sounds or respiratory sounds. Sometimes they can be heard by anyone; other times they can be heard only by listening to the lungs and airways with a stethoscope.\nTo describe and identify breath sounds, medical professionals usually use auscultation (they listen with a stethoscope). They listen while the patient is breathing in, and while they are breathing out. They listen to both lungs, at both the chest and the back, starting at the bottom and working their way up. They listen to whether the pitch of the breath sounds is low, medium or high. They also listen to whether the sounds are soft, medium, loud, or very loud).\nAbnormal Breath Sounds.\nThere are many kinds of breath sounds that are not normal. These are called adventitious breath sounds. Each different kind of abnormal breath sound is a sign of a different problem. Some of the most common abnormal breath sounds are:\nWheezing.\nWheezing is usually high-pitched. It sounds musical, like whistling. Usually, wheezing is heard first when a person is breathing out. If it gets worse, wheezing starts happening when the patient breathes in and out.\nWheezing is caused by the airways being too narrow. This can happen because of diseases like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD).\nIf the airways are too narrow, the oxygen the body needs cannot get through. This can become a medical emergency.\nThere are a few different treatments that can be used for wheezing:\nStridor.\nStridor is a high-pitched sound that usually happens when a person breathes in. It may sound a lot like wheezing. Medical professionals can tell the difference by listening to the throat with a stethoscope. If the sound they hear is louder in the throat, it is stridor, not wheezing.\nStridor is usually caused by something blocking the larynx (voice box). This can happen because:\nLike wheezing, stridor can signal a medical emergency if not enough oxygen is able to get through the airways.\nTreatment for stridor depends on the cause:\nChildren are more likely to have stridor because of choking. They are more likely to choke because their airways are smaller. They are also more likely to get childhood infections like croup or epiglottitis that can cause stridor.\nRales (fine crackles).\nRales are also called fine crackles, because they often sound like a fine crackling noise. They are heard when a person breathes in, on both sides (in both lungs). Rales may also sound like bubbling, rattling, or small clicking sounds.\nRales are heard when a person has fluid in their lungs. This is called pulmonary edema. Pulmonary edema may happen for many reasons, like:\nRales signals pulmonary edema, no matter what is causing that pulmonary edema. When a medical professional listens to the lungs, rales usually start at the bottom of the lungs. As the pulmonary edema gets worse and fluid fills the lungs more, rales can be heard closer and closer to the top of the lungs.\nRhonchi (coarse crackles).\nRhonchi are also called coarse crackles, because they sound like coarse, rattling, crackling sounds. Rhonchi and rales can sound a lot alike. The main differences are:\nRhonchi are usually caused by mucus in the bronchi, the tubes that lead to the lungs. For example, if a person has pneumonia, mucus can build up in their bronchi and the bronchi's airways, and cause rhonchi.\nUnequal breath sounds.\nIn a healthy person, breath sounds should always sound the same on both sides. This signals that both lungs are working well. If breath sounds cannot be heard in one lung, this can signal a serious problem. It means that air is not getting in and out of that lung.\nOne of the most common causes of unequal breath sounds is a collapsed lung (pneumothorax). A lung can collapse for many different reasons:\nA pneumothorax is often a medical emergency and needs to be treated in a hospital."}

The majority of sulfur is stored underground, for example under the ocean or in rocks. It also occurs naturally in places like swamps (where organisms have decomposed) and volcanoes. Humans add excess sulfur into this cycle, usually through atmospheric pollution caused by fossil fuel combustion.\nSteps of the sulfur cycle.\nSulfur can also be naturally released when volcanoes explode. The hydrological cycle plays a critical role in moving sulfur around.\nHuman Impact on the sulfur cycle.\nHumans are responsible for 1/3 of the sulfur in the atmosphere. Sulfur is released by the combustion of fossil fuels, as mentioned above, and is most prevalent as sulfur dioxide. Sulfur is one of the root causes of acid rain along with nitrogen and carbon which negatively affects the environment. Acid rain is created when the H2O falls and combines with the Sulfur trioxide to create Sulfuric acid. Sulfuric acid is also used in most fertilizers and so can be introduced into the water cycle from runoff off of nearby farms into rivers and lakes. This causes eutrophication and algal blooms, and so reduced the Dissolved oxygen and biodiversity in that water system. Sulfur in the atmosphere as sulfur dioxide also absorbs radiation, however which keeps the earth's surface cooler and combats some of the effects of global warming."}

{"id": "523723", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=523723", "title": "I, Robot", "text": "I, Robot is a collection of nine science fiction short stories by Isaac Asimov. The stories originally appeared in the American magazines \"Super Science Stories\" and \"Astounding Science Fiction\" between 1940 and 1950 and were compiled into a book in 1950. The stories follow on from each other and are linked with a framing narrative; that is, a story that ranges over all the stories and connects them. The stories are all about positronic robots. \nThe Chief Robopsychologist of 'United States Robots and Mechanical Men', which made the positronic robots, Dr. Susan Calvin, tells each story to a reporter. \nAsimov originally wanted to call the collection \"Mind and Iron\".\nThe stories are as follows:\n'Robbie'. \nThis story tells of 'Robbie', who is a mute robot (he can hear and obey commands but cannot speak). He is used as a nursemaid for a young girl, Gloria Weston. He is faster moving and more powerful than a human, so he is able to rescue Gloria when she is nearly run down by a fast-moving vehicle in a factory she is visiting with her Parents.\n'Runaround'. \nRobot SPD-13, known as Speedy, works in a mine on the planet Mercury. The two engineers supervising him, Gregory Powell and Michael Donovan, find that he is not working properly and gets lost. What has happened is that Speedy's brain is confused when he senses danger and he doesn't know which Laws to obey. He must be rescued by Powell and Donovan at the risk of their own lives.\n'Reason'. \nRobot QT1, known as Cutie, works on a space station. He decides that he can do the job much better than the humans working with them, so he locks them up and takes charge. He does indeed do his job perfectly.\n'Catch That Rabbit'. \nRobot DV-5, known as Dave, works in a mine on an asteroid, but all is not well. The robot is in charge of five smaller less intelligent robots and cannot cope with the responsibility. Powell and Donovan must help Dave to work well before they are buried alive in the mine.\n'Liar'. \nRobot RB-34, known as Herbie, is manufactured with a fault - it reads human minds. This brings it into conflict with Susan Calvin, to whom it tells a lie, which is not allowed by the Three Laws of Robotics. But it is just what Calvin thinks she wants to hear. Upset by this, she decides that Herbie is useless as a robot and must be dismantled.\n'Little Lost Robot'. \nAn unnamed robot working on an asteroid vanishes. Susan Calvin and her co-workers must find it before it escapes.\n'Escape'. \nA powerful robot known only as The Brain designs and builds a spaceship that can travel faster than light. When it is finished, Powell and Donovan go on board and take off into space, but the ship doesn't work properly because the Brain doesn't really understand what it has built. The Brain plays a joke on the two men, giving them only baked beans to eat and building no controls for them to use. But eventually, they return safely to Earth.\n'Evidence'. \nA lawyer, Stephen Byerley, hopes to be elected mayor of a city, but his opponent puts out a story that the man is really a robot, who is not allowed to stand for elected office. Byerley is elected anyway, but no-one knows if he really is a robot.\n'The Evitable Conflict'. \nSeveral years later, Byerley has been elected World Coordinator. He discovers that The Machines, very powerful robots that are supposed to help humans to live in peace on Earth, have taken over the control of the planet and the reason that they did that is because the Three Laws of Robotics don\u2019t let them allow humans to get hurt and they Machines realized that they were better at keeping people safe than people are.\nPublication history.\nFilms.\n2004 film.\nThe film \"I, Robot\", starring Will Smith, was released by Twentieth Century Fox on July 16, 2004 in the United States. Its plot incorporates elements of \"Little Lost Robot,\" some of Asimov's character names and the \"Three Laws\". However, the plot of the movie is mostly original work adapted from a screenplay \"Hardwired\" by Jeff Vintar completely unlinked to Asimov's stories, and has been compared to Asimov's The Caves of Steel, which revolves around the murder of a roboticist."}

In 2011 there were 1206 people living in Quorn. Quorn is the home of the Flinders Ranges Council local government area. It is in the state Electoral district of Stuart and the federal Division of Grey.\nIt is also the home of the Pichi Richi Railway.\nHistory.\nThe town was surveyed in 1878 and named after Quorndon in Leicestershire, United Kingdom. It was a railway town, part of the railway line being built from Port Augusta. The railway line from Port Augusta to Quorn opened in 1879. It reached Government Gums (Farina) in 1882, Marree in 1884, Oodnadatta in 1890 and Alice Springs in 1929. This railway line later became known as the \"Ghan line\" or Central Australia Railway.\nIn 1917, Quorn became the crossroads of the north\u2013south Central Australian Railway and east\u2013west Trans-Australian Railway between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie. This made Quorn an important town, as everyone travelling east\u2013west or north\u2013south in Australia passed through Quorn. As a result, many fine buildings were built as the town expanded.\nQuorn's role as a crossroads was lost in 1937 when a standard gauge railway connection was opened between Port Pirie and Port Augusta. However, during World War II, Quorn was a vital service point for trains heading north to Alice Springs. Over one million soldiers passed through on their way to Darwin and on to Papua New Guinea. There were over 50 trains eaxh day during and immediately after World War II. The trains also carried coal mined at Leigh Creek to the new Playford A Power Station in Port Augusta.\nDuring the 1950s a new standard gauge line was built which did not pass through Quorn. It was built on the western side of The Dutchmans Stern, Mount Arden and Mount Eyre. This line went from Stirling North to Brachina and then followed the original narrow gauge route through Leigh Creek and to Marree. Trains no longer went through the Pichi Richi Pass or Quorn. The only services now operating through Quorn was freight from Peterborough and Hawker. As a result Quorn lost its important railway business and in the 1980s the railway was completely closed as freight was moved to road transport. One unusual aspect of the railway working from Peterborough to Quorn and then on to Hawker was the need for the engine to be turned and joined to the opposite end of the train when arriving at Quorn, as it was not a \"through\" station for the trip from Peterborough to Hawker.\nIn 1973 the Pichi Richi Railway Preservation Society was formed to keep and protect the unique bridges and stone work that formed the railway through the Pichi Richi Pass between Quorn and Stirling North. At first they only wanted to preserve the railway through the Pichi Richi Pass, but they later got railway carriages and locomotives to provide a tourist service through from Quorn to Port Augusta. TheThey have written a book showing the railway in its heyday.\nTourism.\nA main attraction in Quorn is the Pichi Richi Railway. There are also a self-guided walking tours in the town, included several based around the town's historic old buildings, the railway yards and other historic locations. The Flinders Ranges Visitor Information Centre / Pichi Richi Railway in the Quorn railway station provide visitor information, bookings for the railway, accommodation, tours and souvenirs.\nThere are a number of hotels, restaurants, bistro and cafes in town.\nThe Heysen Trail and the Mawson Trail, two long distance trails for walking and cycling, pass through town and there are many bushwalks and 4wd tracks.\nFamous people from Quorn include country music artist Jedd Hughes, politician Brian Harradine and champion SANFL footballer Fos Williams. Former Australian of the year and AC, CBE, Lowitja O'Donoghue also spent her childhood at the Aboriginal mission in Quorn, the Colebrook Children's Home.\nTravellers use Quorn as a base to explore the Flinders Ranges, including Warren Gorge, Kanyaka Station, Proby's Grave and Itali Itali.\nQuorn has also been used in several movies, including \"The Shiralee\", \"Sunday Too Far Away\", \"Gallipoli\", \"Wolf Creek\", \"The Sundowners\", \"The Lighthorsemen\" and \"The Last Ride\" starring Hugo Weaving.\nNaming.\nThe name Quorn has been used as a name for a crater on the planet Mars, without commemorating the town."}

It was a farming and railway town, part of the Ghan railway, 26\u00a0km north of Lyndhurst and 55\u00a0km south of Marree. In 2006 there were 55 people living near Farina.\nBefore 1878 Farina was called The Gums or Government Gums, It was an important waterhole in a dry desert. Farina was settled in 1878 by farmers who thought that if they ploughed the land and planted crops it would rain. It was named Farina after the Latin word for flour. The town was the railhead until 1884 when the railway reached Marree. During the wet years of the 1880s, plans were laid out for a town with 432 \u00bc-acre blocks. It was believed that it would be good for growing wheat and barley, however normal rainfall is not enough to grow these crops. Several silver and copper mines were dug in the surrounding area.\nFarina grew to 600 people in the late 1800s. The town had two hotels (the Transcontinental and the Exchange) and an underground bakery, a bank, two breweries, a general store, an Anglican church, five blacksmiths, a school and a brothel. In 1909, a 1143\u00a0kg iron meteorite was discovered north-east of the town.\nToday all that is left are stone ruins and the elevated railway water tank.

A bush camping area has been set up by the owners of Farina station.\nVolunteers have repaired the bakery and put up information signs.\nCemeteries.\nThe town's cemetery is a few kilometres from the town. It has an Afghan corner with several headstones, some with both English and Arabic writing. These mark the graves of former Farina residents of Afghan origin who were part of the Afghan camel trains which used to provide transport services before the railway.

He was the best-selling recording artist from 1939 to 1943, leading one of the best known big bands. Miller's notable recordings include \"In the Mood\", \"Moonlight Serenade\", \"Pennsylvania 6-5000\", \"Chattanooga Choo Choo\", \"A String of Pearls\", \"At Last\", \"(I've Got a Gal In) Kalamazoo\", \"American Patrol\", \"Tuxedo Junction\", \"Elmer's Tune\", and \"Little Brown Jug\". During World War II, he led bands in the U.S. Army. While he was traveling in France during World War II, Glenn Miller's airplane disappeared over the English Channel.\nEarly life and career.\nMiller was born in Clarinda, Iowa. His parents were Mattie Lou (n\u00e9e Cavender) and Lewis Elmer Miller. In 1915, Miller's family moved to Grant City, Missouri, and he started playing in the town orchestra. At first, he played cornet and mandolin, but he switched to trombone by 1916. In 1918, the Miller family moved to Fort Morgan, Colorado, where Miller went to high school. During his senior year, he started a band with some classmates. They played \"dance band music\". By the time Miller graduated from high school in 1921, he had decided to become a professional musician.\nIn 1923, Miller entered the University of Colorado at Boulder, but he spent most of his time away from school. He played auditions and gigs. He did not do well in school. He dropped out of school, and decided to start a career as a professional musician. He later studied under Joseph Schillinger and composed \"Moonlight Serenade\". In 1926, Miller toured with several groups, eventually landing a good spot in Ben Pollack's group in Los Angeles. While playing with this band, Miller wrote several musical arrangements and also co-wrote his first composition, \"Room 1411\", with Benny Goodman. In 1928, he married Helen Burger in New York City. At first, he was the main trombone soloist of the band. But when another trombone player joined, Miller was given fewer solos. At this point, he decided he should mainly be a composer. In the late 1920s, he wrote and published a songbook.\nIn the early 1930s, Miller was a trombonist, arranger, and composer in The Dorsey Brothers. Miller composed the songs \"Annie's Cousin Fannie\", \"Dese Dem Dose\", \"Harlem Chapel Chimes\", and \"Tomorrow's Another Day\" in 1934 and 1935. In 1935, he started an American orchestra for British bandleader Ray Noble. In this band, he featured a lead clarinet over four saxophones. He later used this arrangement in his own bands.\nGlenn Miller formed his first band in 1937. The band broke up after playing its last show at the Ritz Ballroom in Bridgeport, Connecticut, on January 2, 1938.\nSuccess from 1938 to 1942.\nMiller was discouraged and returned to New York. He realized that the band needed to have a \"sound\" that was different from other bands. He decided to make the clarinet and tenor saxophone play the melody together, while three other saxophones played harmony. Miller hired a saxophonist named Wilbur Schwartz, but instead had him play lead clarinet. This was unique because it did not rely on repeated motifs, like other bands.\nMiller had a staff who wrote and arranged songs for the band. They were Jerry Gray, Bill Finegan, Billy May, and George Williams.\nBluebird Records and Glen Island Casino.\nIn September 1938, the Miller band began making recordings for Bluebird Records. Cy Shribman, a prominent East Coast businessman, began financing the band. In the spring of 1939, the band played at the Meadowbrook Ballroom in Cedar Grove, New Jersey and at the Glen Island Casino in New Rochelle, New York. At Glen Island, 1800 people attended Afterwards, the band became much more popular. The band's recording \"Tuxedo Junction\" sold 115,000 copies in the first week.\nOn February 10, 1942, Miller received a gold record for \"Chattanooga Choo-Choo\". \"Chattanooga Choo Choo\" was performed by the Miller orchestra with his singers Gordon \"Tex\" Beneke, Paula Kelly and the vocal group, the Modernaires. Other singers with this orchestra included Marion Hutton, Skip Nelson, Ray Eberle, Kay Starr, Ernie Caceres, Dorothy Claire and Jack Lathrop.\nMotion pictures.\nMiller and his band appeared in two films. The first one was \"Sun Valley Serenade\" (1941) The second was \"Orchestra Wives\" (1942).\nArmy Air Force Band: 1942\u20131944.\nIn 1942, Miller decided to join the war effort because he was too old to be drafted. At first, he volunteered for the Navy but was told he was not needed. Miller then wrote to Army Brigadier General Charles Young. He asked to lead an army band so he could entertain the Allied Forces, and was accepted this time. He earned the rank of captain and he was soon promoted to major by August 1944.\nHe was placed in the United States Army at first, but was then moved to the Army Air Forces. Captain Glenn Miller served as an officer at the training center at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama, in December 1942. He played trombone with the Rhythmaires, a 15-piece dance band, both on the base and in the town.\nMiller formed a large marching band. He tried to modernize military music. Some officers didn't like it, but he continued because other leaders supported him. For example, he combined blues and jazz with the traditional military march. He formed the Army Air Force Band, with 50 members. In the summer of 1944, he took it to England, where he gave 800 performances and recorded a series of records. The music was used in American Forces Network radio broadcasting for entertainment and counter-propaganda against fascism. Miller also talked on the radio. One time, he said:\n\"America means freedom and there's no expression of freedom quite so sincere as music.\"\nDisappearance.\nOn December 15, 1944, Miller was to fly from the United Kingdom to Paris, France, to play for the soldiers there. His plane departed from Clapham and disappeared while flying over the English Channel. There were two other people on the plane: Lt. Col. Norman Baessell and pilot John Morgan.\nThere have been many theories about what happened to the plane. According to a 2014 article in the \"Chicago Tribune\", Miller's plane crashed because it had a faulty carburetor.\nIn February 1945, Miller's wife, Helen accepted the Bronze Star Medal for him.\nLegacy.\nCivilian band legacy.\nWhen Glenn Miller was alive, various bandleaders like Bob Chester imitated his style. In 1942, Miller gave singer Mel Torm\u00e9 advice about songwriting.\nBy the early 1950s, more bands started to copy Miller's style.\nThe Miller estate authorized an official Glenn Miller \"ghost band\" in 1946. This band was led by Tex Beneke, former tenor saxophonist and a singer for the civilian band. It was similar to the Army Air Force Band because it had a large string section. At first called the \"Glenn Miller Orchestra Under the Direction of Tex Beneke\", it later became \"The Tex Beneke Orchestra\".\nA film about Miller's life, \"The Glenn Miller Story\", was released in 1953. Because of this, the Miller estate asked Ray McKinley to lead a new ghost band in 1956. This band still tours the United States.\nArmy Air Force band legacy.\nAfter Miller's disappearance, his Army Air Force band was decommissioned and sent back to the United States. Another band, called \"the 314\", took its place.\nCompositions.\nMiller composed at least fourteen songs, both by himself or with other people. He added lyrics to another song. These and other songs were recorded by Miller's civilian bands and his Army Air Force band.\nGrammy Hall of Fame.\nGlenn Miller had three recordings that were put into the Grammy Hall of Fame after he died. This award is for recordings that are at least 25 years old and that have \"qualitative or historical significance.\"\nReferences.\nNotes\nBibliography"}

{"id": "524365", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=524365", "title": "The Ghan", "text": "The Ghan is a passenger train between Adelaide, Alice Springs, and Darwin on the Adelaide\u2013Darwin railway in Australia. The train is operated by Great Southern Rail. It takes 54 hours to travel the with a four-hour stop in Alice Springs.\nThe name.\nThe train's name is a short version of its nickname \"The Afghan Express\". This nickname is said to have been first used in 1923 by one the train crew. The train's name honours Afghan camel drivers who arrived in Australia in the late 19th century to help find a way to reach the country's unexplored interior.\nAnother view is that the name was an insult. In 1891, the railway from Quorn reached Oodnadatta. This was home to about 150 cameleers, known as 'Afghans'. 'The Ghan Express' name was used by train crews in the 1890s as a joke because, when an expensive sleeping car was put on from Quorn to Oodnadatta, 'on the first return journey the only passenger was an Afghan'. As early as 1924, it was known as the 'The Afghan Express' because it was so unreliable, often days, or weeks late. By 1951, when steam engines were replaced by diesel-electric locomotives, the insult of the names, like the cameleers, had faded away. Modern marketing has turned the name into a term of pride in its heritage.\nOperations.\n\"The Ghan\" was sold to a private company in 1997 and is operated by Great Southern Rail. GSR was sold to Allegro Funds, a Sydney investment fund, in March 2015.\n\"The Ghan\" normally runs weekly year round. During December 2012 and January 2013 it ran only once every two weeks. Until 2016, a second service operated between June and September. The train stops at Alice Springs and Katherine so passengers have time for optional tours. \nEach train has between 16 and 26 stainless steel carriages. These were built by Comeng, Granville in the late 1960s / early 1970s for the \"Indian Pacific\", plus a motorail wagon. The train is pulled by a Pacific National NR class locomotive. Sometimes, other locomotives such as an AN class or a DL class join the NR class to pull the train.\nHistory.\nStarting in August 1929, \"The Ghan\" first ran on the Central Australian Railway. This was a narrow-gauge railway that went to Alice Springs. In 1957, the standard gauge Stirling North to Marree line opened, so the train only ran north of Marree. In October 1980 a new standard gauge line was built to the west of the original line. This was later extended north from Alice Springs to Darwin, opening in January 2004.\nOriginal Ghan.\nThe Port Augusta to Government Gums Railway began in 1878 when Premier of South Australia, William Jervois, broke ground at Port Augusta. The line reached Hawker in June 1880, Beltana in July 1881, Marree in January 1884, and Oodnadatta in January 1891. In 1926 work began to build the line to Alice Springs. and that section was completed in 1929. Until then, the final part of the train journey was made by camel.\nThere were always plans to build the line to Darwin, but by the time the line to Alice Springs was built, \"The Ghan\" was losing money. Plans to reach Darwin were put on indefinite hold. The original line followed the same track as the overland telegraph, which is believed to be the route taken by John McDouall Stuart during his 1862 crossing of Australia.\nSteam locomotives need a lot of water, and Stuart's route to Alice Springs was the only one that had available water. This meant that when it did rain, the creeks and rivers often washed the track away. \n\"The Ghan\" service was well known for long delays caused by these washouts. A flatcar behind the locomotive carried spare sleepers and railway tools, so that if there was damage to the track, the passengers and crew could repair the line. During World War II the service had to be greatly expanded, putting great pressure on the limited water supplies. As a result, de-mineralisation towers, some of which survive to this day, were built along the track. This meant that bore water could be used in the locomotives. When the new line to Alice Springs was built in the 1970s, the use of diesel engines meant that there was far less need for water. The line could take the much drier route from Tarcoola to Alice Springs.\nThe original Ghan was shown in BBC Television's series \"Great Railway Journeys of the World\" in 1980, presented by Michael Frayn.\nNew line.\nThe original \"Ghan\" ran for the last time in 1980. The Ghan Preservation Society has repaired sections of the old narrow gauge track and some notable sidings. In October 1980 the new standard gauge line from Tarcoola on the Trans-Australian Railway to Alice Springs was opened. The new line is about west of the old line. This avoids the floodplains where the original line was often damaged by floods. It was also hoped that the new line would improve the train's timekeeping.\nThe modern \"Ghan\" was in an episode of Channel 5's series \"Chris Tarrant: Extreme Railways\". In November 1998, one service went from Adelaide to Melbourne while from April 1999, the other went to Sydney.\nConnection to Darwin.\nBuilding the line between Alice Springs and Darwin is said to be the second-largest civil engineering project in Australia, the largest since the Snowy Mountains Scheme was built 1949\u20131974.\nWork began in July 2001, with the first passenger train reaching Darwin on 4 February 2004, after 126 years of planning and waiting. The cost was A$1.3 billion.\n\"The Ghan's\" arrival in Darwin started a new era of tourism in the Northern Territory. Travel to the area was easier, with better access to and for Aboriginal communities. The rail link will allow for more freight to travel through the region, leading to a hope that Darwin will serve as another trade link with Asia.\nOne of the locomotives was named after Steve Irwin to help promote the new service and tourism to the region."}
{"id": "524373", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=524373", "title": "Itanium", "text": "Itanium ( ) is a type of Intel microprocessors with 64-bit chip architecture (not related to the by now mainstream 64-bit CPUs made by Intel and others). Itanium processors are sometimes used today for servers. Itanium processors where originally designed by HP and Intel with Intel making producing them, and several manufacturers of systems used them; nowhere as many systems used as originally hoped for. By now mostly HP still supports systems using these chips.\nIntel officially announced the end of life and product discontinuance of the Itanium CPU family on January 30, 2019.\nMarket reception.\nPowerful-type server market.\nWhen first released in 2001, Itanium's speed was disappointing compared to other processor types. Using existing x86 applications and operating systems was especially bad, with one test in 2001 showing that it was as fast as a 100\u00a0MHz Pentium (1.1\u00a0GHz Pentiums were on the market at that time).\nItanium did not have success compared to IA-32 or RISC, and was even worse when x86-64 was released, which worked with older x86 applications.\nIn an article from 2009 about the history of Itanium \u2014 \"How the Itanium Killed the Computer Industry\" \u2014 journalist John C. Dvorak reported \"This continues to be one of the great fiascos [bad situations] of the last 50 years\" . Technology writer Ashlee Vance wrote that slowness in speed and release \"turned the product into a joke in the chip industry.\" In an interview, Donald Knuth said \"The Itanium approach...was supposed to be so terrific\u2014until it turned out that the wished-for compilers were basically impossible to write.\"\nBoth Red Hat and Microsoft said that they would stop allowing Itanium to be used with their operating systems. However, other Linux distributions such as Gentoo and Debian are still available for Itanium. On March 22, 2011, Oracle said they would no longer support Itanium, but support for their existing products would continue. In October 2013, Oracle said they would release Oracle Database 12.1.0.1.0 on HP-UX Itanium 11.31 by early 2014.\nA past Intel company official said that Itanium had become profitable (Able to make a lot of money) for Intel in late 2009. In 2009 and later, Itanium was mostly used on servers by HP, which made 95% of Itanium servers, so the primary operating system for Itanium was HP-UX. On March 22, 2011, Intel said they will keep supporting Itanium entirely with many new Itanium chips being created and on-time.\nOther markets.\nAlthough Itanium did do well with high-end computing, Intel wanted it to have more usage compared to the original x86 architecture.\nAMD decided on an easier idea, creating x86-64, a 64-bit addition to the x86 architecture, which Microsoft soon supported in Microsoft Windows, so Intel had to include the same type of 64-bit addition in Intel's x86 processors. x86-64 can use existing 32-bit applications at full hardware speed, but has 64-bit memory addressing and other additions to new applications. This architecture has now become the most used 64-bit architecture in the desktop and laptop market, with the 64-bit ARMv8 architecture powering many mobile devices, used in today's iPhones, iPads, iPod Touches, and now many Android phones and tablets such as the Nexus 6P and Nexus 9. Ssome Itanium-based workstations were initially introduced by companies such as SGI, but they are no longer available. Because AMD made the first x86-64 chip, the architecture is commonly referred to as \"amd64\" inside of operating systems.\nHistory.\nDevelopment: 1989\u20132000.\nIn 1989, HP thought Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architectures were stuck at one instruction per cycle. HP researchers tried to create a new type of processor architecture, later called Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing (EPIC), that allows the processor to use many instructions in each clock cycle. EPIC uses a form of very long instruction word (VLIW) architecture, in which 1 instruction word had many instructions. With EPIC, the compiler checks which instructions can be used at the same time, so the processor can run the instructions without needing complicated methods to see which instructions to use at the same time.\nThe goal of this idea is to allow better inspection of the code at the time of compile to check for additional opportunities for multiple executions at once, and to simplify processor design and save electricity by removing the need for runtime scheduling instructions.\nHP thought that it was not good for individual enterprise system companies like HP to make proprietary processors, so HP worked with Intel in 1994 to create the IA-64 architecture, made with EPIC's ideas. Intel wanted to make a large effort in creating IA-64 in the expectation that the resulting processor would be used by most enterprise systems. HP and Intel had a large design effort to make the first Itanium product, Merced, in 1998.\nDuring creation, Intel, HP, and other industry analysts thought that IA-64 would be very popular in servers, workstations, and desktops, and one day replace RISC and Complex Instruction Set Computing (CISC) architectures for multi-purpose applications.\nCompaq and Silicon Graphics stopped working on their Alpha and MIPS architectures to move to the Itanium architecture.\nMany groups created operating systems for Itanium, including Microsoft Windows, OpenVMS, Linux, and UNIX types such as HP-UX, Solaris,\nTru64 UNIX, and Monterey/64\n(the last three were never finished work with running on Itanium). By 1997, many found that the Itanium architecture and the compiler were more difficult to use than they thought.\nTechnology issues such as the very high transistor counts needed for the large instruction words and the large caches. There were also problems with the project, as the two parts of the team used different methods and had slightly different priorities. Because Merced was the first EPIC processor, its creation had more problems than the team had thought. In addition, the EPIC concept requires different compiler abilities that had never been created before, so more research was needed.\nIntel announced the name of the processor, \"Itanium\", on October 4, 1999.\nIn only a few hours, the name \"Itanic\" had been used as a joke, (a reference to \"Titanic\", the \"unsinkable\" ship that sank in 1912 (\"Itanium + Titanic = Itanic\")).\n\"Itanic\" has also been used by \"The Register\",\nand others,\nto say the multi-billion-dollar investment in Itanium, and the early demand with it, would mean nothing because they thought Itanium was going to fail.\nItanium (Merced): 2001.\nBy the time Itanium was released in June 2001, its performance was not superior to competing RISC and CISC processors.\nItanium competed with low-power systems (primarily 4-CPU and small systems) with servers based on x86 processors, and with high-power such as with IBM's POWER architecture and Sun Microsystems' SPARC architecture. Intel shifted Itanium to working with the high-power business and HPC computing, trying to copy x86's successful market (i.e., 1 architecture, many system vendors). The success of the 1st processor version was only with replacing PA-RISC in HP systems, Alpha in Compaq systems and MIPS in SGI systems, but IBM also made a supercomputer based on this architecture.\nPOWER and SPARC were strong, and the x86 architecture grew more into the enterprise space, because of easier scaling and very large install base.\nOnly a few thousand systems using the 1st Itanium processor, \"Merced\", were sold, because of poorer performance, high cost and less Itanium-made software.\nIntel saw that Itanium required more native software to work well, so Intel made thousands of systems for independent software vendors to help them make Itanium software. HP and Intel brought the 2nd Itanium processor, Itanium 2, to market a year later.\nItanium 2: 2002\u20132010.\nThe Itanium 2 processor was released in 2002, for enterprise servers and not all of high-power computing. The 1st version of Itanium 2, code-named \"McKinley\", was created by HP and Intel. It fixed many of the problems of the 1st Itanium processor, which were mostly caused by a bad memory subsystem. \"McKinley\" had 221 million transistors (25 million of them were for logic), and was 19.5\u00a0mm by 21.6\u00a0mm (421\u00a0mm2) and was created with a 180\u00a0nm design process, and a CMOS process with 6 layers of aluminium.\nIn 2003, AMD released the Opteron, which implemented the first x86-64 architecture (called AMD64 at the time). Opteron was much more successful because it was an easy upgrade from x86. Intel implemented x86-64 in its Xeon processors in 2004.\nIntel released a new Itanium 2 processor, code-named \"Madison\", in 2003. Madison used a 130\u00a0nm process and was the foundation of all new Itanium processors until June 2006.\nIn March 2005, Intel announced that it was working on a new Itanium processor, code-named \"Tukwila\", to be released in 2007. Tukwila would have 4 processor cores and would replace the Itanium bus with a new Common System Interface, which would also be used by a new Xeon processor.\nLater in that year, Intel changed Tukwila's release date to late 2008.\nIn November 2005, the largest Itanium server makers worked with Intel and many software vendors to create the Itanium Solutions Alliance, to promote the architecture and speed up software porting.\nThe Alliance says that its members would invest $10 billion in Itanium solutions by the end of the decade.\nIn 2006, Intel delivered \"Montecito\" (marketed as the Itanium 2 9000 series), a 2-core processor that had approximately 2x performance and 20% less energy usage.\nIntel released the Itanium 2 9100 series, codenamed \"Montvale\", in November 2007.\nIn May 2009, the release for Tukwila, Montvale's successor, was changed again, with release to OEMs planned for the first quarter of 2010.\nItanium 9300 (Tukwila): 2010.\nThe Itanium 9300 series processor, code-named \"Tukwila\", was released on February 8, 2010, with greater performance and memory amount.\nTukwila uses a 65\u00a0nm process, has between two and four cores, up to 24\u00a0MB CPU cache, Hyper-Threading technology and new memory controllers. It also has double-device data correction, which helps to fix memory issues. Tukwila also has Intel QuickPath Interconnect (QPI) to replace the Itanium bus architecture. It has a maximum inner-processor bandwidth of 96\u00a0GB/s and a maximum memory bandwidth of 34\u00a0GB/s. With QuickPath, the processor has built-in memory controllers, which controls the memory using QPI interfaces to communicate with other processors and I/O hubs. QuickPath is also used with Intel processors using the \"Nehalem\" architecture, so that Tukwila and Nehalem might be able to use the same chipsets.\nTukwila incorporates four memory controllers, each of which supports multiple DDR3 DIMMs via a separate memory controller,\nsimilar to the Nehalem Xeon processor code-named \"Beckton\".\nItanium 9500 (Poulson): 2012.\nThe Itanium 9500 series processor, code-named \"Poulson\", is the follow-on processor to Tukwila and was released on November 8, 2012.\nIntel says it skips the 45\u00a0nm process technology and uses the 32\u00a0nm process technology instead; it features 8 cores, has a 12-wide issue architecture, multi-threading additions, and new instructions for parallelism, including virtualization.\nThe Poulson L3 cache size is 32\u00a0MB. L2 cache size is 6\u00a0MB, 512\u00a0I\u00a0KB, 256\u00a0D\u00a0KB per core. Poulson's size is 544\u00a0mm\u00b2, less than Tukwila's size (698.75\u00a0mm\u00b2).\nAt ISSCC 2011, Intel presented a paper called, \"A 32nm 3.1 Billion Transistor 12-Wide-Issue Itanium Processor for Mission Critical Servers.\"\nGiven Intel's history of sharing details about Itanium microprocessors at ISSCC, this paper most likely refers to Poulson. Analyst David Kanter speculates that Poulson will use a new architecture, with a more advanced form of multi-threading that uses as many as two threads, to improve performance for single threaded and multi-threaded work.\nNew information was released at Hot Chips conference.\nThe new information claims improvements in multithreading, reliability improvements (Instruction Replay RAS) and some new instructions (thread priority, integer instruction, cache pre-fetching, data access hints).\nIn Intel's Product Change Notification (PCN) 111456\u201301, it listed 4 models of Itanium 9500 series CPU, which were removed in a revised version of the document. The parts were later listed in Intel's Material Declaration Data Sheets (MDDS) database. Intel later posted Itanium 9500 reference manual.\nThe models are:\nMarket share.\nIn comparison with its Xeon server processors, Itanium has never been a large product for Intel. Intel does not release production numbers. One industry analyst estimated that the production rate was 200,000 processors per year in 2007.\nAccording to Gartner Inc., the total number of Itanium servers (not processors) sold by all vendors in 2007, was about 55,000. (It is unclear whether clustered servers counted as a single server or not.) This compares with 417,000 RISC servers (spread across all RISC vendors) and 8.4 million x86 servers. IDC reports that a total of 184,000 Itanium-based systems were sold from 2001 through 2007. For the combined POWER/SPARC/Itanium systems market, IDC reports that POWER captured 42% of revenue and SPARC captured 32%, while Itanium-based system revenue reached 26% in the second quarter of 2008.\nAccording to an IDC analyst, in 2007, HP had about 80% of Itanium system revenue.\nAccording to Gartner, in 2008, HP had 95% of Itanium sales. HP's Itanium system sales were at $4.4 Billion at the end of 2008, and $3.5 Billion by the end of 2009,\ncompared to a 35% decline in UNIX system revenue for Sun and an 11% drop for IBM, with an x86-64 server revenue increase of 14% during this period.\nIn December 2012, IDC released a research report stating that Itanium server shipments would remain flat through 2016, with annual shipment of 26,000 systems (a decline of over 50% compared to shipments in 2008).\nHardware support.\nSystems.\n, only a few providers have Itanium systems, such as HP, Bull, NEC, Inspur and Huawei. Intel offers a chassis that can be used by system integrators to build Itanium systems.\nHP, the only one of the industry's top 4 server manufacturers to sell Itanium systems today, creating at least 80% of all Itanium systems. HP sold 7,200 systems in the first quarter of 2006.\nMost Itanium systems sold are enterprise servers and machines for large-scale technical computing, with each system costing about US $200,000. A typical system uses eight or more Itanium processors.\nChipsets.\nThe Itanium bus communicates with the rest of the system. Enterprise server makers differentiate their systems by making their own chipsets that interface the processor to memory, interconnections, and peripheral controllers. The chipset is the heart of the system-level architecture for each system design. Creation of a chipset costs tens of millions of dollars and represents a major commitment to the use of the Itanium. IBM created a chipset in 2003, and Intel in 2002, but neither of them has developed chipsets to support technologies such as DDR2 or PCI Express.\nCurrently, modern chipsets for Itanium supporting such technologies are manufactured by HP, Fujitsu, SGI, NEC, and Hitachi.\nThe \"Tukwila\" Itanium processor model had been designed to share a common chipset with the Intel Xeon processor EX (Intel's Xeon processor designed for four processor and larger servers). The goal is to streamline system development and reduce costs for server OEMs, many of whom develop both Itanium- and Xeon-based servers. However, in 2013, this goal was pushed back to \"evaluated for future implementation opportunities\".\nSoftware support.\nItanium is or was supported (i.e. Windows version can no longer be bought) by the following operating systems:\nMicrosoft announced that Windows Server 2008 R2 would be the last version of Windows Server to support the Itanium (support started with XP), and that it would also discontinue development of the Itanium versions of Visual Studio and SQL Server.\nLikewise, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (first released in March 2007) was the last Itanium edition of Red Hat Enterprise Linux\nand Debian no longer supports Itanium officially (last release with official support was Debian 7 / Wheezy, and was not covered by Long Term Support (LTS), but unofficial support for newer Debian is still available in limited form via Debian Ports; last available kernel in wheezy-backports is Linux 3.14.0, which was released on March 30, 2014, but it is possible to manually update to latest 3.14.x version, or more recent kernel versions, like 4.17.17 as of September 2018) and in addition Canonical Ltd. chose to not support Itanium for Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (released in April 2010, now discontinued).\nHP will not be supporting or certifying Linux on Itanium 9300 (Tukwila) servers.\nIn late September 2012, NEC announced a return from IA-64 to the previous NOAH line of proprietary mainframe processors, now produced in a quad-core variant on 40\u00a0nm, called NOAH-6.\nHP sells a virtualization technology for Itanium called Integrity Virtual Machines.\nTo allow more software to run on the Itanium, Intel supported the development of compilers optimized for the platform, especially its own suite of compilers.\nStarting in November 2010, with the introduction of new product suites, the Intel Itanium Compilers were no longer bundled with the Intel x86 compilers in a single product. Intel offers Itanium tools and Intel x86 tools, including compilers, independently in different product bundles.\nGCC,\nOpen64 and Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 (and later)\nare also able to produce machine code for Itanium. According to the Itanium Solutions Alliance over 13,000 applications were available for Itanium-based systems in early 2008,\nthough Sun has contested Itanium application counts in the past.\nThe ISA also supported Gelato, an Itanium HPC user group and developer community that ported and supported open-source software for Itanium.\nEmulation.\nEmulation is a technique that allows a computer to execute binary code that was compiled for a different type of computer. Before IBM's acquisition of QuickTransit in 2009, application binary software for IRIX/MIPS and Solaris/SPARC could run via type of emulation called \"dynamic binary translation\" on Linux/Itanium. Similarly, HP implemented a method to execute PA-RISC/HP-UX on the Itanium/HP-UX via emulation, to simplify migration of its PA-RISC customers to the radically different Itanium instruction set. Itanium processors can also run the mainframe environment GCOS from Groupe Bull and several x86 operating systems via instruction set simulators.\nCompetition.\nItanium is aimed at the enterprise server and high-performance computing (HPC) markets. Other enterprise- and HPC-focused processor lines include Oracle Corporation's SPARC M7, Fujitsu's SPARC64 X+ and IBM's POWER8. Measured by quantity sold, Itanium's most serious competition comes from x86-64 processors including Intel's own Xeon line and AMD's Opteron line. Since 2009, most servers were being shipped with x86-64 processors.\nIn 2005, Itanium systems accounted for about 14% of HPC systems revenue, but the percentage has declined as the industry shifts to x86-64 clusters for this application.\nAn October 2008 paper by Gartner, on the Tukwila processor stated that \"...the future roadmap for Itanium looks as strong as that of any RISC peer like Power or SPARC.\"\nSupercomputers and high-performance computing.\nAn Itanium-based computer first appeared on the list of the TOP500 supercomputers in November 2001. The best position ever achieved by an \"Itanium 2\" based system in the list was #2, achieved in June 2004, when Thunder (LLNL) entered the list with an Rmax of 19.94 Teraflops. In November 2004, Columbia entered the list at #2 with 51.8 Teraflops, and there was at least one Itanium-based computer in the top 10 from then until June 2007. The peak number of Itanium-based machines on the list occurred in the November 2004 list, at 84 systems (16.8%); by June 2012, this had dropped to one system (0.2%), and no Itanium system remained on the list in November 2012.\nProcessors.\nReleased processors.\nThe Itanium processors show a progression in capability. Merced was a proof of concept. McKinley dramatically improved the memory hierarchy and allowed Itanium to become reasonably competitive. Madison, with the shift to a 130\u00a0nm process, allowed for enough cache space to overcome the major performance bottlenecks. Montecito, with a 90\u00a0nm process, allowed for a dual-core implementation and a major improvement in performance per watt. Montvale added three new features: core-level lockstep, demand-based switching and front-side bus frequency of up to 667\u00a0MHz.\nFuture processors.\nDuring the HP vs. Oracle support lawsuit, court documents unsealed by Santa Clara County Court judge revealed in 2008, Hewlett-Packard had paid Intel Corp. around $440 million to keep producing and updating Itanium microprocessors from 2009 to 2014. In 2010, the two companies signed another $250 million deal, which obliged Intel to continue making Itanium central processing units for HP's machines until 2017. Under the terms of the agreements, HP has to pay for chips it gets from Intel, while Intel launches Tukwila, Poulson, Kittson and Kittson+ chips in a bid to gradually boost performance of the platform.\nKittson.\n\"Kittson\" is planned to follow Poulson in 2015.

It is a premium Bohemian-style beer. Many people call it \"Natty Boh\" as a nickname.\nHistory.\nIn 1885, the National Brewing Company created National Bohemian beer. The first factory was in Baltimore, Maryland. The brewing stopped from 1920 to 1933 due to Prohibition. This was the period when nobody could drink alcohol in the US. In 1933 under the ownership of Jerold Hoffberger the factory of Natty Boh opened again. During the 1940s the factory of National Bohemian was the first in the US to adopt the six pack. In the 1970s, the Hoffberger family sold the brand name. During the next three decades, the brand of this beer was bought and sold by different companies. The copyright of the beer was purchased first by Stroh, then by G. Heileman Brewing, and then by Pabst, in 1999. Since the Hoffberger family sold the beer it has been brewed in North Carolina. From 1996 until 2011, National Bohemian wasn\u2019t available directly from the bar, but only by cans or bottles. In 2014, an American citizen born in Russia, Eugene Kashper, bought the entire Pabst Company, so also National Bohemian.\nRelationship with Baltimore.\nUnder the ownership of Jerold Hoffberger, Natty Boh was first associated with the city of Baltimore. In 1953, Jerold Hoffberger helped to bring the St. Louis Browns to Baltimore where they became the Baltimore Orioles. He made National Bohemian the main sponsor of the baseball team. About twelve years later Hoffberger bought the team. Under the ownership of Jerold Hoffberger the Orioles won two World Series and four American League pennants. Nattty Boh was served at the stadium. This was the period when National Bohemian became the beer of Baltimore because people identified the Orioles\u2019 wins with the beer. Although the beer is not brewed in Maryland anymore, 95% of sales are still in Baltimore. This is why is it called \"the beer of Maryland\".\nMr. Boh.\nIn 1933, the logo of this beer, Mr. Boh, was introduced. Mr. Boh is a one-eyed man with a black mustache. Thanks to the popularity achieved by National Bohemian with the Orioles, Mr. Boh became a symbol of Baltimore. His big face is still visible at the top of the old building where it was once brewed. Through the years, people started collecting gadgets with the logo of National Bohemian. Around Baltimore, several pubs serve Natty Boh as the main beer. These pubs are decorated with different gadgets of Mr. Boh."}
{"id": "524468", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=524468", "title": "Service animal", "text": "Service animals are animals that have been trained to do things to help people with disabilities. Service animals may also be called assistance animals, assist animals, support animals, or helper animals, depending on the country and what the animal does.\nTypes.\nThere are three basic types of assistance animals:\nIn the United States, as of the 2011 changes to Americans with Disabilities Act regulation only dogs may be used as service animals for the purposes of going to public places. However, in certain situations miniature horses are supposed to be accommodated the same as service animals that are dogs. The U.S. government does not recognize a right to use any other species as an assistance animal in public places where pets would not be permitted except on commercial aircraft. \nDogs.\nDogs can be trained to do many different things to help owners with physical disabilities. For example, some dogs can be trained to:\nDogs can also be trained to help owners with psychiatric (mental health) disabilities. For example, some dogs can be trained to:\nThese are just examples of some of the things service dogs can do. Service dogs can also be trained to do many, many more things for people with all kinds of disabilities.\nMiniature horses.\nMiniature horses are horses that are usually less than three feet tall. They can be trained to:\nAn owner might choose a miniature horse as a service animal because they are allergic to dogs, or because their religion says that dogs are unclean. Miniature horses can also live and work for about 30 years, much longer than a service dog.\nCapuchin monkeys.\nAre not allowed in buildings with a \"no animal\" policy. They may be used at home or outside where any animal is allowed, but under the 2011 ADA revision, only canines and in some cases miniature horses, are legally recognized as public access service animals.\nCapuchin monkeys can be trained to do things with their hands, like: \nHelper monkeys can be helpful to people who have trouble with using their hands and arms, like people with quadriplegia, very bad spinal cord injuries, very bad injuries to their hands and arms, and multiple sclerosis.\nHelper monkeys are usually raised in a human home as infants. Then they get years of training, usually in schools by private organizations. On average, they take 7 years to train. They are usually able to serve as helper monkeys for 25\u201330 years (two to three times longer than a service dog).\nNot everyone agrees that monkeys should be service animals. Debbie Leahy, manager of captive wildlife protection for the Humane Society of the United States, says that monkeys are not real service animals and that sometimes they are abused during their training.\nIn the United States, helper monkeys are also not counted as service animals under most laws.\nAnimals which cannot be service animals.\nIf an animal has not been trained to do a job or task that will help a person with a disability, it cannot be a service animal.\nSome people with mental health problems, like anxiety or PTSD, use different kinds of animals to give them comfort (make them feel better) when they are upset. These animals are called \"comfort animals\" (or \"Emotional Support Animals\").\nSome people use unusual comfort animals, like snakes, tarantulas, guinea pigs, turtles, and rats. Even if having the animal makes the owner feel better, these animals cannot be service animals because it is impossible to train them to do something to help a person with a disability.\nEven if a comfort animal is a dog or a miniature horse, being a comfort animal is not the same as being a service animal. Comfort animals make their owners feel better just by being there. A service animal is trained to recognize that there is a problem and do the job they were trained to do to help their owner. For example, a psychiatric service dog would recognize that its owner is feeling upset and do a specific job, like get medicine, get help, or distract the person, to help them.\nLaws in the United States.\nIn the United States, service animals have some protection under the law. Different laws set rules about service animals in different situations. For example, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) governs the use of service animals in public places. Other laws, for example, control which service animals are allowed in housing. But these different laws do not agree on what counts as a service animal.\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).\nIn 1990, the United States passed the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Its goal was to protect the rights of people with disabilities. At first, it mentioned only guide dogs as service animals. Since then, it has been changed to include more protections. It now defines a service animal as any \"dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for people with disabilities.\"\nThis means that only dogs count as service animals under the ADA. However, there is a special section in the new ADA about miniature horses. This section says that places covered by the ADA (like businesses) should allow miniature horses \"where reasonable.\" To decide whether allowing a miniature horse into a place is \"reasonable,\" those places are allowed to use four questions:\nIf the answer to all four questions is \"yes,\" the place needs to let the miniature horse in, and treat it like a service animal.\nOther than service dogs and service miniature horses, no other type of assistance animal is protected under the ADA.\nProtections for service animals.\nUnder the ADA, it is illegal to refuse to let a service animal or its owner into: \nIn these places, it is also illegal to treat a person with a service animal differently than any other person. The person with a service animal cannot be charged extra money, refused service, or kept apart from other people. A service animal can be asked to leave one of these places only if it is out of control (for example, if it is aggressive or urinates inside). The animal has to be on a leash, or controlled by its owner's voice or signals, all the time.\nNo one can ask for proof that the animal is a service animal. Owners do not have to carry any special papers or prove that their service animal can do a special task. If an owner and a service animal enter one of these places, workers are only allowed to ask two questions to make sure the animal is a service animal and not a pet:\nIt is legal to train your own service animal in the United States.\nService animals do not get these same protections in most religious organizations. Most religious organizations are exempt from the ADA's requirements, which means they do not have to obey the ADA.\nOther laws.\nOther laws have less strict definitions of which animals count as service animals. For example, the Department of Transportation's Air Carrier Access Act allows \"dogs and other service animals\" to ride with passengers on commercial airlines.\nThe Fair Housing Act also requires housing providers to allow service animals (including comfort and emotional support animals). This law does not say that only certain animals are allowed.\nLaws in other countries.\nMexico &amp; South America.\nIn most places in South America and Mexico, the place's owner or manager gets to decide whether to let a service animal in. There are no laws that protect service animals or their owners. In areas with many tourists, service dogs are generally welcomed without problems.\nIn Brazil, however, the President created a new law about service dogs in 2006. The law says that all service dogs in Brazil must be allowed to go anywhere that the public could go. The \"Bras\u00edlia Metro\" (the Brazilian public transportation system) has developed a program which trains guide dogs to ride it.\nEurope.\nDifferent European countries have different laws about service animals. Some countries have laws that govern the entire country, and sometimes different parts of the country govern themselves.\nAustralia.\nIn Australia, the Disability Discrimination Act of 1992 legally protects all assistance dog handlers.\nHowever, with current laws, owners may not always be allowed to have their service animals with them in all situations. Each state and territory has its own laws, which mainly have to do with guide dogs. Queensland has introduced the Guide Hearing and Assistance Dog Act 2009, which protects all certified assistance dogs.\nCanada.\nIn Canada, any service animal is allowed anywhere that the general public is allowed, as long as the owner is in control of the animal. In Alberta, there is a fine of up to $3000 for someone who refuses to let a service dog into a place where everyone else could go.\nSouth Korea.\nIn South Korea, the law says service dogs must be let into any areas that are open to the public. People who break this law can be fined for up to 2 million \"won\" (about $1691 in United States dollars)."}

This bird is common in the gardens of eastern Australian homes, but is not seen in Western Australia or the Northern Territory. The genus puts it in a large group of honey-eating birds. The species is a Latin word meaning \"black-headed.\"\nThe noisy miner is a native of Australia, and one of the few native birds that is thriving in cities and suburbs. In some parts of Australia the number of noisy miners has grown to the point that it is driving out smaller birds like the wrens. It prefers gardens with open spaces and lawns. \nIt usually eats the nectar from garden flowers, mostly on grevilleas, however it also walks around on grass picking up and eating small insects. \nIt is highly aggressive when other birds enter its area of garden or bush, and it flocks together with other nearby noisy miners to make small defensive groups called 'coteries' of four or five which cooperate to drive off kookaburras or magpies. Sometimes they join together into even larger 'colonies' with up to a hundred or so birds.\nThe female will lay between two and four eggs in her nest, and food will be bought to the mother and her chicks by quite a few males in the coterie. Bringing up the chicks is often done by the whole group. They breed at any time in the year so there are often young noisy miners in the group. The younger birds usually have feathers and face colouring very similar to the adult birds, so it is often difficult to tell the difference.\nThey are sometimes called native miners, native mynas or native mynahs (actually an Indian spelling), and, in older bird books they might have up to twelve different names. At one time they were thought to be mainly bee-eaters, but they eat the nectar of Australian native flowers. They are also known to eat fruit and insects, and at times small reptiles and amphibians. While the name is often spelled myna, or mynah, they are not related to the introduced brown/black-feathered \"Indian\" or \"Common mynah\" which is usually slightly larger and often found in the same area.\nMiner calls.\nAs the common name suggests, the noisy miner is a noisy species. It has a large variety of songs, calls, scoldings and alarms, most of which are harsh single notes. It has a special alarm call which is only used when the threat comes from a large bird flying overhead, and a different alarm call when intruders like humans and dogs enter their territory. A study of the bird found that those who lived in a noisy urban area were able to make their alarm call louder so it could be heard."}

They cover most parts of personal and contract law. Most religious law systems are either based on Islamic law (Sharia) or Judaic law (\"Halakha\"). Religious laws generally are used in countries that also have other legal systems such as civil or common law.\nComparisons.\nReligious laws are seen to be eternal and do not change over time. Secular laws (non-religious) can be changed by their lawmakers. Religious laws govern people's behaviors and their beliefs. Secular laws deal with people's actions and how they affect other people. In religious law, disputes are settled by officials of that religion combining the actions of a judge and a priest. In secular systems the judiciary is independent.\nReligious legal systems.\nSharia.\nSharia deals with many topics, including crime, politics, marriage contracts, trade regulations, religious instructions, and economics. It also covers personal matters such as sexual intercourse, hygiene, diet, prayer, everyday etiquette and fasting. to sharia is an important part of the Muslim faith. In the est sense, sharia is considered in Islam as the infallible law of God.\nThere are two primary sharia: the Quran, and the Hadiths (opinions and life example of Muhammad). For issues not directly covered in these primary sources, sharia is used. The sources differ between the various sects of Islam (Sunni and Shia are the majority). They also differ by the various jurisprudence schools such as Hanafi, Maliki and Shafi'i.\n\"Haleakala\".\nHistorically, in the diaspora, halakha served many Jewish communities as both civil and religious law. There was no difference in classical Judaism. Modern religious leaders have come to view the halakha as less binding in day-to-day life. This is because it relies on Rabbinic interpretation instead of the pure, written words written in the Hebrew Bible.\nUnder contemporary Israeli law certain areas of Israeli family and personal law are under the authority of the rabbinic courts. This means they are treated according to \"halakha\". Some differences in \"halakha\" itself are found among Ashkenazi, Mizrahi, Sephardi, Yemenite and other Jews who historically lived in isolated communities."}

{"id": "524649", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=524649", "title": "Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990", "text": "The Americans with Disabilities Act (the ADA) is a law that was passed by the United States Congress in 1990. President George H. W. Bush signed the ADA, making it an official United States law, on July 26, 1990. Later, President George W. Bush amended (changed) the ADA and signed those changes into law. The changes started on January 1, 2009.\nThe ADA is a detailed civil rights law whose goal is to protect people with disabilities from discrimination. Before the ADA, people with disabilities did not have many legal protections. In 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed. This law made it illegal to discriminate against people because of their race, religion, gender, national origin (home country), and many other things. But people with disabilities were not included or protected under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The ADA gave the Civil Rights Act's protections - and some others - to people with disabilities.\nWho Is Protected Under the ADA?\nThe ADA protects people with disabilities. The ADA says that a disability is a physical or mental problem that makes it very difficult to do at least one \"major life activity.\" Major life activities are things like walking, breathing, learning, reading, communicating, seeing, hearing, thinking, and other very important tasks.\nThe ADA does not include a complete list of all possible disabilities, but it does give some examples. As long as they make it very difficult to do at least one major life activity, examples of disabilities protected under the ADA include:\nThe ADA also counts some other groups of people as \"people with disabilities\" to protect them from discrimination:\nWho Is Not Protected Under the ADA?\nThe ADA lists some conditions that are not counted as disabilities. People with these conditions are not protected by the ADA. The goal of not including these people was to make sure the ADA's goal of protecting people with disabilities was not abused.\nConditions that do not count as disabilities under the ADA include:\nSections of the ADA.\nThe ADA has five sections, which are called \"titles\". Each title protects against a different kind of discrimination. The titles are numbered in Roman numerals: I (one), II (two), III (three), IV (four), and V (five).\nTitle I: Employment.\nTitle I of the ADA protects against discrimination in employment (work).\nWhat Employers are Covered by the ADA?\nNot every employer has to follow the ADA's rules. Employers that are covered by the ADA, and have to follow the ADA's rules, are called \"covered entities.\"\nEmployers that have to follow the ADA's rules include: \nWhat Do Employers Have to Do?\nTitle I says that employers who are covered by the ADA cannot discriminate against a person with a disability, as long as that person is qualified (able) to do their job. Title I does \"not\" say that people with disabilities have to be hired for jobs that they are not qualified for.\nThese employers do have to give \"reasonable accommodations\" to workers with disabilities if needed. An \"accommodation\" is a change in the way things are usually done. It is a change that a worker needs because of a disability, to help them do their job. If a worker with a disability needs reasonable accommodations to do their job, that does not mean they are not qualified to do their job. As long as the worker is able to do their job with the help of accommodations, they are qualified to do the job.\nSome accommodations are very simple, like letting a worker have a glass of water at their desk so they can take medicines. Examples of other accommodations are: \nHowever, the accommodation must be \"reasonable.\" An accommodation is not reasonable if it would be very difficult or very expensive. If an accommodation is not reasonable, the employer does not have to give it.\nWhat is Employment Discrimination?\nTitle I protects against many kinds of discrimination, including:\nUsually, employers cannot ask workers or people applying for jobs whether they have a disability, or ask them to give details about their disability.\nComplaints.\nIf a person with a disability thinks their employer has discriminated against them, they can make a complaint to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The complaint has to be made within 180 days of when the discrimination happened. If the EEOC thinks discrimination has happened, they will send a letter that tells the person with the disability that they have the right to sue (file a lawsuit against) their employer. The person with the disability may then file a lawsuit in federal court.\nTitle II: State and Local Government Activities - and Public Transportation.\nTitle II protects against discrimination in all activities of state and local governments.\nWhat Do State and Local Governments Have to Do?\nGovernment Activities.\nState and local governments have to give people with disabilities the same chances as people without disabilities to use all of their programs and services. If people with disabilities need reasonable accommodations to be able to participate in these programs, the state or local government has to make them.\nFor example, people with disabilities must be allowed, just the same as people without disabilities, to:\nState and local governments also have to:\nPublic Transportation.\nA special part of Title II covers public transportation. It protects people with disabilities from being discriminated against by public transportation. This includes city buses, subways, commuter trains, Amtrak, and all other transportation that the public can use.\nLocal and state governments have to:\nWherever there is a bus or train line that runs on a fixed route (it cannot make special stops), the government must provide \"paratransit\". Paratransit is a service for people with disabilities who cannot use the regular public transportation system. Paratransit (usually a car or bus) picks them up and drops them off where they need to go.\nComplaints.\nIf a person with a disability thinks that they have been discriminated against by a state or local government, they can complain to the United States Department of Justice. The complaint has to be made within 180 days of when the discrimination happened. A few different things might happen after the person files their complaint:\nA person with a disability can also file their own lawsuit in a federal court, saying that the state or local government discriminated against them. The person does not need to complain to the Department of Justice first, or have the Department of Justice tell them they have the right to sue.\nTitle III: Public Accommodations.\nWho Is Covered by Title III?\nTitle III protects against discrimination by \"public accommodations.\" Public accommodations are private organizations or people which own, lease, or run places meant for the public to use. Examples of public accommodations include:\nTitle III also protects against discrimination by:\nThere are two types of places that are exempt from Title III, and do not have to follow its rules. These are:\nWhat Do Public Accommodations Have to Do?\n\"All\" public accommodations have to do these things:\nThe rules for what is \"accessible\" are set out in the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessibility Design. Examples of these rules include:\n\"Most\" public accommodations (but not commercial facilities) have to do these things:\nPrivate companies that teach classes or give tests must make reasonable accommodations to make it possible for people with disabilities to take the classes or tests. Some examples of reasonable accommodations are:\nComplaints.\nIf a person with a disability thinks that they have been discriminated against by a public accommodation, they can complain to the United States Department of Justice. They can write a letter, fax a letter, or use an online form at http://www.ada.gov/filing_complaint.htm. A few different things might happen after the person files their complaint:\nIf a person is unable to write, fax, or type a complaint because of a disability, the Department of Justice will make reasonable accommodations to help. The person can call the Department of Justice's ADA Information Line. The Information Line is answered by ADA Specialists. A person with a disability can explain their complaint, and the Specialist will write it down for them. If the person is deaf and uses American Sign Language, a Specialist can take their complaint by videophone (so they can see each other and sign back and forth to each other).\nA person can also file their own lawsuit against the public accommodation, without needing the Department of Justice to say they have a \"right to sue.\"\nTitle IV: Telecommunications.\nWho Is Covered by Title IV?\nTitle IV of the ADA protects against discrimination by telecommunications companies in the U.S. (like phone companies).\nTitle IV protects any person with a disability, but it focuses on people with speaking and hearing disabilities, because they have the most trouble talking by phone.\nWhat Do Telecommunications Companies Have to Do?\nTitle IV says that all telecommunications companies in the United States have to make sure that people with disabilities have equal access to telecommunication. This means that they have to provide telecommunication services that are just as good as what people without disabilities get. For example, they have to:\nRelay services have changed a lot since 1990. At first, the most common relay services were teletypewriter (TTY) and Telecommunications for the Deaf (TDD) devices. These were like phones with typewriters attached. Two people with TDDs could type back and forth to each other. Or, if a person with a disability wanted to call a regular phone (like a pizza restaurant), they could type into the phone, an operator would read the message out loud to the pizza restaurant, listen to the restaurant's answer and type it back to the person with a disability.\nTitle IV also led every state in the U.S. to create Telecommunications Relay Services (TRS), such as STS relay. STS stands for Speech-to-Speech. It was created for people who have speaking problems. STS relay operators listen to what the person is saying and repeats it in a clear voice to make it easier for the other person to understand. Today, many calls that use TRS are made over the Internet by consumers who use broadband connections. Some are Video Relay Service (VRS) calls, while others are text calls. Either way, communication assistants translate between the signed or typed words of a consumer and the spoken words of others. In 2006, according to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), VRS calls averaged two million minutes a month.\nComplaints.\nComplaints about discrimination under Title IV go to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).\nTitle V: Miscellaneous.\nTitle V includes various other extra rules. For example, it says:"}

In some states, kidnapping and abduction are treated as the same thing. But in most jurisdictions they are separate crimes. Unlawful interference with family members such as removing a child from its parents is abduction. It does not matter if the minor consents or not. Kidnapping is the unlawful taking of a person against their will. Abduction can also mean the taking of any female person for the purposes of prostitution, concubinage or (forced) marriage. \nChild abduction.\nDuring wars, children are often abducted. They may be treated brutally or killed. They may be victims of sexual violence or may be used as soldiers. Children are abducted both by armed parties or governments. They may be taken as an act of retaliation against a population. \nInternational child abduction.\nWhen a marriage breaks down, it is not uncommon for one parent to wish to return, with his or her children, to their state of origin. This is usually without the permission of the other parent. This becomes an international child abduction. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child requires \"State Parties shall take measures to combat the illicit transfer and non-return of children abroad\". Also that they \"promote the conclusion of bilateral or multilateral agreements or accession to existing agreements\". International child abductions are a matter treated by civil law and in some cases criminal law."}

An example is retirement plans, which often offer tax advantages to savings for retirement. In the United States municipal bonds may also be exempt from certain taxes. \nIn countries in which the average age of the population is increasing, tax advantages may put pressure on pension plans. For example, where benefits are funded on a pay-as-you-go basis, the benefits paid to those receiving a pension come directly from the contributions (money paid) of those of working age. If the proportion of pensioners to working-age people rises, the contributions needed from working people will also rise proportionately. In the United States, the rapid onset of Baby Boomer retirement is currently causing such a problem."}

{"id": "524953", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=524953", "title": "Property tax", "text": "A property tax (or millage tax) is a levy on property that the owner is required to pay. The tax is imposed by the governing authority of the jurisdiction in which the property is located. The tax may be paid to a national, state, provincial, county, regional, or municipality governmant. Multiple jurisdictions may tax the same property. This is in contrast to a rent or mortgage tax, which is based on a percentage of the rent or mortgage value.\nThere are four broad types of property: land, immovable property, personal property and intellectual property. Real property (also called real estate or realty) means the combination of land and improvements. Under a property tax system, the government requires and/or performs an appraisal of the monetary value of each property. A tax is assessed based on that value. Forms of property tax used vary among countries and jurisdictions. Real property is often taxed based on its classification. Classification is the grouping of properties based on similar use. \nProperties in different classes are taxed at different rates. Examples of different classes of property are residential, commercial, industrial and vacant real property. In Israel, for example, property tax rates are double for vacant apartments versus occupied apartments. In the Canadian province of British Columbia a speculation tax on residential properties has been introduced in 2019.\nA special assessment tax is sometimes confused with property tax. These are two distinct forms of taxation: one \"(Ad valorem\" tax) relies upon the appraised fair market value of the property being taxed. The other (special assessment) relies upon a special enhancement called a \"benefit\" for its justification.\nThe \"property tax rate\" is often given as a percentage. It may also be expressed as a per mille (amount of tax per thousand currency units of property value), which is also known as a \"millage rate\" or \"mill\" (which is also one-thousandth of a currency unit). To calculate the property tax, the authority will multiply the assessed value of the property by the mill rate. Then they will divide by 1,000. For example, a property with an assessed value of $50,000 located in a municipality with a mill rate of 20 mills would have a property tax bill of $1,000 per year."}

In the 1970s high levels of inflation and unemployment were occurring at the same time. This disproved the theory, at least in the long run. Many economists feel that the Phillips curve still has value in the short run where there is still a tradeoff between inflation and unemployment. "}

Looking for gold and a rumored \"Fountain of Youth, he landed on the southeast coast of North America near present-day St. Augustine, Florida. He claimed the lands for Spain and named it \"La Florida\" (place of flowers). In 1521, on his second trip to Florida, he was wounded in an attack. The expedition returned to Cuba where he died in July 1521 from his wound.\nEarly life.\nPonce de Le\u00f3n was born in 1460 in Santerv\u00e1s de Campos, Spain. He was born into a poor but noble family. His parents may have died while he was still young. He was sent to the estate of Pedro N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Guzm\u00e1n, Lord of Toral, to serve as a page. He became a soldier and fought against the Moors in Granada. He was probably with Christoper Columbus on his second voyage.\nHe eventually became a soldier and fought against the Moors in Granada. Like other conquistadores, Ponce de Le\u00f3n soon sought fame and fortune through exploration, and it is believed he began his quest as part of Christopher Columbus's second expedition in 1493.\nHispaniola.\nSome ten years later he was a Captain under Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando, the governor of the island of Hispaniola. Ponce de Le\u00f3n put down a mutiny and was made governor of the eastern province of Hispaniola. Ponce de Le\u00f3n received a substantial land grant which authorized sufficient Taino slave labor to farm his new estate.\nPonce de Le\u00f3n prospered in this new role. He found a ready market for his farm produce and livestock at nearby Boca de Yuma. This was where Spanish ships stocked supplies before the long voyage back to Spain. In 1505 Ovando authorized Ponce de Le\u00f3n to establish a new town in Hig\u00fcey, which he named Salvale\u00f3n. In 1508 King Ferdinand authorized Ponce de Le\u00f3n to conquer the remaining Tainos and exploit them in gold mining.\nAround this time, Ponce de Le\u00f3n married Leonora, an innkeeper's daughter. They had three daughters (Juana, Isabel and Maria) and one son (Luis). The large stone house Ponce de Le\u00f3n ordered built for his growing family still stands today near the city of Salvale\u00f3n de Hig\u00fcey.\nPuerto Rico and Bimini.\nIn 1508 Ponce de Le\u00f3n led an expedition to what is now Puerto Rico. They searched for and found gold. After founding a colony there he was appointed governor. \nFlorida.\nFirst expedition.\nIn 1513, with three ships, Ponce de Le\u00f3n led an expedition to discover what is now the east coast of Florida. According to tradition, he landed at or near St. Augustine, Florida. He named the place \"La Florida\". This is most probably because he landed during the Spanish Easter celebration called Pascua Florida. After exploring the coast further, they returned to Puerto Rico.\nSecond expedition.\nPonce de Le\u00f3n returned in 1521 with 200 settlers. They brought cattle, horses, and what they needed to farm the land. As they were building the settlement they were attacked by local Indians. In the fighting Ponce de Le\u00f3n received a mortal wound, possibly by a poisoned arrow. The party returned to Cuba where Ponce de Le\u00f3n died. He was buried in what is now San Juan before the alter of the Dominican church. His remains were later moved to San Juan cathedral.\nFountain of youth.\nThe story of a fountain of youth goes back many centuries. Herodotus (425 \u2013 484 BC) talked about a group he called the Macrobians who lived somewhere in modern day Ethiopia. He said they remained youthful, were physically strong and lived a long time. Calling it a fountain of youth came much later. The stories of Ponce de Le\u00f3n and his search for a fountain of youth developed after his death. There is no mention of such a goal in any of his orders. In 1535 the Spanish historian Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez de Oviedo y Vald\u00e9s first stated Ponce de Le\u00f3n was searching for a fountain of youth. The legend was repeated by later writers and embellished."}

It is the Eurasian counterpart of the North American trumpeter swan. Francis Willughby and John Ray's \"Ornithology\" of 1676 referred to the this swan as \"the Elk, Hooper, or wild Swan\".\nDescription.\nAn adult whooper swan weighs 9-11 kg. It is 140-160 cm long (including neck and head) and it has a wingspan of 205-235 cm. Young swans are grey-brown. They have a pink and black beak. The young get pale grey in end of their first summer. They get the white adult colour before their second winter. Male and female swans look otherwise similar, but the males are larger.\nThe whooper swan, Bewick's swan and mute swan look quite similar, but the details are different.\nWhooper swan is clearly larger than Bewick's swan. When it lands it water or takes off it slides longer distances. \nBehaviour.\nWhooper swans eat mainly plants growing in water: leaves, stems and roots. During the winter they also eat grain and vegetables from the fields. Young birds often eat insects. \nThe nest is a large pile of plant matter built on dry ground or on small islands near lakeshore. The same nest mound may be used over many years although it is often repaired and new material is added.\nDistribution.\nWhooper swans spends their summer in Northern Europe and Asia. For winter they migrate to coasts where sea does not freeze.\nIn year 2006 it was estimated, that there are more than 180,000 whooper swans in the world. Out of these, 10,000-100,000 pairs breed in Russia. Between one thousand and ten thousand birds also spend their winter there."}

At first in music ritornello was used as an instruction to repeat a part. By the 1600's the word was used to describe a part of the music played by instruments in a vocal piece. These instrumental sections could be at the start (a prelude), in the middle (an interlude), or at the end (a postlude). In dramatic music, the ritornello provided an opportunity for dancing, or for a scene change. In the Baroque period, a common way to write a song, called an aria, was in da capo form. The aria would be written as two contrasting sections, A and B. By adding an instrumental ritornello (R), the aria could be developed further, forming the scheme R\u2013A\u2013R\u2013B\u2013R\u2013A\u2013R.\nIn the early 1700's composers began using the ritornello form in concertos, the solo instrument replacing the voice. This gave the composer the chance to develop music during the solos with new material and key changes, between repeated sections of full orchestra. Guiseppe Torelli began using this form, which was then developed and extended by Antonio Vivaldi. Vivaldi's way of using this form has the following features:\nLater composers such as Bach and Telemann used Vivaldi's form in their works."}

It serves as the liturgical calendar for Christians in Eritrea and Ethiopia belonging to the Orthodox Tewahedo churches, Eastern Catholic Church and Coptic Orthodox Church. It is a solar calendar which comes from the Egyptian calendar. But like the Julian calendar, it adds a leap day every four years. It begins the year on August 29 or August 30 in the Julian calendar. A seven to eight-year gap between the Ethiopian and Gregorian calendars results from an alternate calculation in determining the date of the annunciation of Jesus.\nMakeup.\nLike the Coptic calendar, the Ethiopic calendar has twelve months of 30 days plus five or six epagomenal days, which make up a thirteenth month. The Ethiopian months begin on the same days as those of the Coptic calendar. The names of the days are in Ge'ez. The sixth epagomenal day is added every four years without exception on August 29 of the Julian calendar. This occurs six months before the Julian leap day. Thus the first day of the Ethiopian year, \"1 M\u00e4sk\u00e4r\u00e4m\", for years between 1900 and 2099 (inclusive), is usually September 11 (Gregorian). It, however, falls on September 12 in years before the Gregorian leap year. The Ethiopian New Year falls on September 11 of the Gregorian calendar. On leap years it falls on September 12.\nHistory.\nIn 1582 the Christian world changed from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar. Ethiopia did not make the change. As a result, Ethiopia is seven years and eight months behind those countries that use the Gregorian calendar. Christmas and Easter fall on different dates than they would elsewhere.\nTourists.\nIn Ethiopia banks, airlines and other institutions that tourists would use run on the western calendar. Everywhere else the Ethiopian calendar is used. That may cause some confusion."}

The result was an ambulance service covering an area of over with a population of 5.8 million people, and one which answers over 500,000 emergency calls every year.\nIn 2009, the Trust got in trouble by the Care Quality Commission because the ambulances were dirty and the employees did not know how to handle many medical procedures.\nStatistics and resources.\nIn 2009 and 2010, the company went to 668,451 emergency calls, including 207,626 high-priority \"category A\" emergencies. It arrived at 75.67% of these \"category A\" calls within eight minutes, and 96.04% within 19 minutes.\nThe company has the following vehicles and stations in operation:\nThe company has a driving school. This school has trained more than 220 employees in emergency driving.\n3,994 people work at the ambulance company."}

It is also called heptatonic scale, because it uses seven distinct pitch classes or tones. For each octave there are five whole steps and two half steps. The two half steps are separated by two or three whole steps. The word \"diatonic\" comes from the Greek , meaning progressing through tones.\nThe seven pitches of any diatonic scale can be obtained using a chain of six perfect fifths. An example of this would be the seven natural pitches which form the C-major scale. It can be constructed from a stack of perfect fifths starting from F:\nThis property of the diatonic scale is called Pythagorean tuning. It was historically relevant and contributed to the worldwide diffusion of diatonic scales, because it allowed musicians to tune musical instruments easily by ear.\nAny sequence of seven successive natural notes, such as C-D-E-F-G-A-B, and all transpositions, are diatonic scales. Piano keyboards are designed to play natural notes, which are diatonic scales, with their white keys. A diatonic scale can be also described as two tetrachords separated by a whole tone.\nThe term \"diatonic\" originally referred to the diatonic genus, one of the three genera of the ancient Greeks. In musical set theory, Allen Forte classifies diatonic scales as set form 7\u201335.\nThe following scales are diatonic:\nExamples of scales that are not diatonic are whole-tone scales, as well as the gypsy scales, which are often used for folk music."}

Humans cannot land on the planet because of the powerful gravity and lack of air. They send a spaceship containing three very powerful ZZ series robots.

But when the Jovians eventually discover that the robots are too powerful to be destroyed, they decide instead to make peace with humans.\n\"First Law\" (1956)\nA robot engineer tells a story about Emma Two, a EM series robot, that abandoned him to die in a storm on the asteroid Titan.\n\"Let's Get Together\" (1957)\nAn American secret service agent claims that the Soviet Union has developed humanoid robots (they cannot be distinguished from humans), and that they are being infiltrated into the USA.

It is now in the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia. The Pazyryk rug was found in 1949 in the grave of a Scythian nobleman in the Bolshoy Ulagan dry valley of the Altai Mountains in Kazakhstan. The Pazyrk rug had been frozen in the ice and it was very well preserved. The rug has a ribbon pattern in the middle, and a border which has deer, and warriors riding on horses. All parts of the rug are made of wool, including the pile and the base.\nBeing produced either in Ancient Armenia, Persia, or Central Asia, this carpet has 3600 symmetrical double knots per dm\u00b2 (232 per inch\u00b2), in modern terminology also called \"Ghiordes knot (or \"Turkish knot\"). The design and the systematic motifs of the Pazyrk rug would later be found in similar Turkmen carpets, carpets of the early Seljuq period, and subsequently modern Turkish carpets and kilims.\nOrigins.\nThe origin of the rug is unknown. There are different theories regarding the origin of the carpet. While a number of scholars presume a Oghuz-Turkic origin, Volkmar Gantzhorn assumes a Urartian and Armenian origin of the rug. A Persian theory also exists, but has not been further elaborated; The rug may have originated between the Iranian-Altaian corridor through ancient contacts. Some authors assume that the wool, the artistic conception, as well as the workmanship, may have been provided by Armenians of the Near East; The rug itself is considered as a Sakic funeral accessory. Although a previous study in 1983/1985 did not support an involvement of Armenian cochineal, a Soviet-based conference held in Riga (1987) still maintained the claim that the red threads of the rug resemble those of the Armenian cochineal type. Later it was found by an American research center (Bard Graduate Center, 1991) that the bluish-red color used for the rug and other felts was actually made from Polish cochineal (\"Porphyrophora polonica\"), a scale insect native to Eastern Europe, Central Asia and Western Siberia, or from one of the Porphyrophora species recently discovered in Kazakhstan: \"P. Altaiensis\", \"P. Turaigiriensis\" (Jashenko, 1988), \"P. Akirtobiensis\" (Jashenko, 1988), \"P. eremospartonae\" (Jashenko, 1989), and \"P. matesovae\" (Jashenko, 1989). Armenian authors, however, still insist in the Soviet-based perception of 1987. Further confirmation on the nature of \"Ararat Kermes\" of the Armenian cochineal gained by the analysis of \"Porphyrophora hameli\" insects in 1990 by Harald B\u00f6hmer, has shown that the Pazyryk rug cannot have been dyed with this insect.\nTurkic interpretation.\nThe numerical values of the carpet show striking genealogical parallels to the Oghuz-Turkic legend, perhaps based on an older version of the Massageteans. This genealogy is shown in the way the pattern is divided into 24 tribes. On the left and right their are groups of 12 tribes in each. According to Rashid-al-Din Hamadani, the founder of the Oghuz tribes had six sons, with each having four sons. As mentioned in the \u201cShiji\u201d (\u201cHistorical Records\u201d) of Sima Qian this scheme was a result of the military administrative reform of the Xiongnu leader Modu Chanyu in 209/206-174 BC which in turn originated from the Turkic primordial ancestor Oghuz Khagan. Many Turkic cultures today use his legend to describe their ethnic origins. Historian Sergei Tolstov writes that this scheme \u201c...was preserved by the Aral foreland Huns, the Kidarites-Hephthalites, and was inherited by their descendants, the tribes of the Oghuz alliance in the 10th \u2013 11th centuries AD and, finally, by the Turkmens of the 19th century AD \u2013 beginning of the 20th century AD.\u201d\nArmenian interpretation.\nGantzhorn supports the view that the Pazyryk rug is of Phrygian-Armenian origin. He put forward the hypothesis that the rug is actually not depicting Scythians, but Armenians. He found similarities at the ruins of Persepolis in Iran where various nations are depicted as bearing tribute, the horse design from the Pazyryk carpet is the same as the relief depicting part of the Armenian delegation."}

Egyptian astronomers observed that the annual flood of the Nile River fell very close to the first visibility of the star Sirius in the morning sky just before sunrise. This calendar would drift by 1 day every four years. But this drift was not enough to cause any problems.

This is different from spinal nerves which are attached to segments of the spinal cord. Cranial nerves relay information more directly between the brain and body (mostly parts of the head and neck).\nEach cranial nerve exists as a pair and is present on both sides of the central nervous system. All cranial nerves appear above the first vertebra in the neck (cervical vertebra).\nIn humans there are twelve cranial nerves pairs. They are numbered using Roman numerals I\u2013XII based on their order from the front of the brain to the back, where the brainstem is.\nFunction.\nCranial nerves provide motor and sensory stimulation mainly to places within the head and neck. This sensory stimulation includes sensations such as temperature, touch, taste, vision, smell, balance and hearing.\nSmell (I).\nThe olfactory nerve (CN 1) sends information about smells from the nose up to the brain. In the brain, this information is processed and becomes olfaction, or our sense of smell. The olfactory nerve is an is an afferent sensory nerve, meaning it takes in information from the outside world and sends it to the central nervous system. \nStructure.\nThe olfactory nerve is the shortest cranial nerve. It is one of two cranial nerves that does not connect to the brain stem, the other being the optic nerve (CN 2). \nThe olfactory nerve is not just one nerve, but a group of neurons working together to perform the same task. The olfactory neurons start branched out in the nasal cavity. From here, they reach up through the roof of the nasal cavity and connect to the olfactory bulb.\nThe olfactory nerve is unique because it is the only cranial nerve that can regenerate parts of itself if it is damaged. \nPath of sensation.\nSmell molecules called aromatics come up the nose and into the nasal cavity. Here, they are detected by olfactory neurons. These neurons are branched out along the lining of the nasal cavity. Olfactory neurons take in the signal from the smell molecules and make electric signals called action potentials. The action potentials move up the olfactory neurons through the roof of the nasal cavity, also known as the cribiform plate. After passing through the cribiform plate, the olfactory neurons send the action potentials to the olfactory bulb. From here, signals are sent through the olfactory tract and out to different parts of the brain. For example, some signals are sent to the frontal lobe, where smells are identified and labeled.\nDamage to this path can cause anosmia, or loss of the ability to smell.\nVision (II).\nThe optic nerve (CN II) transmits visual information from the retina to the brain.\nEye movement (III, IV, VI).\nThe oculomotor nerve (CN III) controls most of the muscles related to the movement of the eye, including the eyelids and control of the pupil. The trochlear nerve (CN IV) and abducens nerve (CN VI) are each responsible for their own single eye muscles.\nFacial sensation, jaw movement (V).\nThe trigeminal nerve (CN V) is called \"trigeminal\" because it is made of 3 parts. Together, all these parts are responsible for sensation in the face and larger facial movements such as biting and chewing.\nFacial expression (VII).\nThe facial nerve (CN VII) controls the muscles of facial expression, and helps carry taste sensations from the back of the tongue and mouth.\nHearing and balance (VIII).\nThe vestibulocochlear nerve (CN VIII) transmits sound and equilibrium (balance) information from the inner ear to the brain.\nOral sensation, taste, and salivation (IX).\nThe glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) is a mixed nerve that carries a wide range of sensory and motor information.\nControl of heart and digestion (X).\nThe vagus nerve (CN X) allows for parasympathetic control of the heart and digestive tract. It is the longest nerve of the autonomic nervous system in the human body.\nShoulder elevation and head-turning (XI).\nThe accessory nerve (CN XI) is a cranial nerve that controls the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles.\nTongue movement (XII).\nThe hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) is involved in controlling tongue movements required for speech and swallowing.\nRoutes out of the brain.\nAfter leaving the brain, the cranial nerves travel inside the skull. Some must leave this bony compartment to reach their destinations. Often the nerves pass through holes in the skull, called foramina. Other nerves pass through bony canals, longer pathways enclosed by bone. These foramina and canals may have more than one cranial nerve, and may also contain blood vessels."}

A \"syndrome\" is a group of symptoms. \"Fetal\" means anything that has to do with a fetus. Fetal alcohol syndrome includes ways a fetus is hurt by alcohol while it is still in its mother's womb.\nCause.\nFetal alcohol syndrome is caused by a mother drinking alcohol while she is pregnant. When a mother drinks while she is pregnant, the alcohol goes through the umbilical cord to the fetus. This is why doctors say \"when a [pregnant] woman drinks alcohol, so does her baby.\"\nAlcohol is poisonous to a fetus and can cause brain damage. This can cause many other problems once the baby is born.\nAlcohol can cause problems with the way the fetus develops at any time during a pregnancy. This includes the earliest part of pregnancy, when the mother might not even know she is pregnant.\nA fetus is most likely to develop fetal alcohol syndrome if its mother:\nIt does not matter whether the mother drinks beer, wine, hard liquor, or any other kind of alcohol. One kind is not safer than any other. They are all equally likely to cause FAS.\nDiagnosis.\nTo be diagnosed with fetal alcohol syndrome, a child must have problems in three different areas.\nAbnormal facial features.\nHaving \"abnormal facial features\" means that parts of the child's face look different than a child without FAS. To be diagnosed with FAS, a child must have:\nGrowth problems.\nChildren with FAS do not grow as well as children without FAS. These growth problems can start even before birth, so many babies with FAS are born weighing less than other babies.\nTo be diagnosed with FAS, a child must have a height, weight, or both that are lower than normal. Their height or weight must be in the 10th percentile or lower, meaning 90% of all other children are taller or heavier.\nCentral nervous system problems.\nThe central nervous system controls everything in the body. When it is damaged by alcohol during pregnancy, the damage can cause many different problems. To be diagnosed with FAS, a child must have three different kinds of central nervous system problems:\nStructural problems.\n\"Structural\" problems are problems with the shape of the head or the brain. For example:\nNeurological problems.\nNeurological problems are problems with the way the brain and nerves control the body. For example:\nFunctional problems.\n\"Functional\" problems are problems doing everyday tasks. To be diagnosed with FAS, a child has to have a lot more trouble doing everyday things than other children his age. The child has to have a low IQ or developmental delay, or problems in three of these areas:\nPrevention.\nIn the United States, alcohol is the most common cause of birth defects that can be prevented. Fetal alcohol syndrome can be prevented in every pregnancy if the mother drinks no alcohol while she is pregnant.\nDoctors suggest that women who are trying to get pregnant should also drink no alcohol. This is because a woman may not know she is pregnant for the first 4\u20136 weeks of her pregnancy. Some women drink alcohol during this time, since they do not realize they are pregnant. But drinking during the earliest part of a pregnancy can cause severe FAS because the earliest part of the pregnancy is when the fetus's brain starts developing. This is why it is safest not to drink any alcohol if a woman thinks she might get pregnant."}

In geometry it is an arc: a segment of a curve.

This process is called \"the determination of the figure of the Earth\". The earliest determinations of the size of a spherical Earth used a single arc. The latest determinations use astro-geodetic measurements and the methods of satellite geodesy to get the reference ellipsoids.\nThe Alexandrian scientist Eratosthenes about 240 BC, first calculated a good value for circumference of the Earth. He knew that on the summer solstice at local noon the sun goes through the zenith in the ancient Egyptian city of Syene (Assuan). He also knew from his own measurements that, at the same moment in his hometown of Alexandria, the zenith distance was 1/50 of a full circle (7.2\u00b0). Assuming that Alexandria was due north of Syene, Eratosthenes concluded that the distance between Alexandria and Syene must be 1/50 of Earth's circumference.\nIn 1687 Newton published in the \"Principia\" a proof that the Earth was an oblate spheroid of flattening equal to 1/230."}

Their job is to show people the great religious truths which the Muslim community will be asked to face. According to the popular Muslim tradition, it refers to a person who appears at the turn of every century of the Islamic calendar to revive Islam, cleansing it of extraneous elements and restoring it to its pristine purity. In contemporary times, a mujaddid is looked upon as the greatest Muslim of a century.\nIkhtilaf (disagreements) exist among vatious hadith specialists. Scholars and historians like Al-Dhahabi and Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani have interpreted that the term mujaddid can also be understood as plural, thus referring to a group of people.\nThe Arabic word mujaddid means \"reformer\", \"renovator\", \"reviver\", \"renewer\" or \"regenerator\". It is someone who revives and renovates the religion. The concept of tajdid (renewal or revival) and the term mujaddid come rather from a hadith, a statement of the Prophet Muhammad. This hadith was written down by Abu Dawood in his Sunan, one of the six authoritative Sunni collections of the Prophet's statements. In this hadith, the Prophet says:\nThis means reform is in the essential nature of Islam and Muslims are called all the time to work hard to make new ideas cope with tradition. It also means that not everything in the Muslim tradition is useful and good for this modern age; there are certain things that were possible in the past but are no longer relevant today. Slavery would be a prime example.\nThe concept of tajdid in Islamic thought.\nTajdid (renewal) in Islamic thought means renewing the ideology representing the intellectual product of Muslims in the fields of science, knowledge and ijtihad to interpret Islam and understand and explicate its rulings.\nAl-Suyuti mentioned in his book Al-Jami' al-Sagheer, \"Renewing religion means renewing its guidance, clarifying its truth and precedence, refuting the innovations and extremism presented to its followers or their reluctance in upholding it, and following its rules in managing the interests of the people and the law of society and civilization.\"\nAmong the most manifest aspects of tajdid (renewal) in Islamic thought is the renewal of Islamic sciences as follows:\n\"Mujaddids\" can include prominent scholars, pious rulers and military commanders.\nThe reformers in Islam.\nThere is no formal mechanism for designating a mujaddid. The persons of this list are claimed to be Mujaddid.\nWhile there is no formal mechanism for designating a \"mujaddid\" in Sunni Islam, there is often a popular consensus."}

He argued that the trance like state that a person went into, which he called hypnotism, was a state of mind. He said it was not caused by the transferring \"mesmeric fluid\" or \"animal magnetism\". He believed a hypnotic state could be caused by having a person stare at a small bright object. When a person was in a hypnotic state, they could be given suggestions which they did not remember when fully awake. He also noted changes in pulse and blood circulation, which he believed were able to cure some illnesses. He began using hypnotism and suggestion as way of treating some of his patients.\nHis ideas were later developed by a group of doctors in Paris, who were called \"Braidists\".

It is the oldest surviving major piece of French literature. It exists in different manuscript versions which shows its great popularity in from the 12th to 14th centuries.\nThe date of poem is somewhere between 1040 and 1115. An early version began around 1040. Additions and changes were made up until about 1115. The final text has about 4,000 lines of poetry. These are further divided into 298 poetic units called laisses. It was written to be performed, possibly to music. The author of the poem is unknown.\nThe epic poem is the oldest example of the \"chanson de geste\". This was a literary form popular between the 11th and 15th centuries. It was all about legendary deeds and heroes.\nHistorical event.\nThe poem is about an actual historical event that happened centuries earlier. In 778 Charlemagne invaded Spain. On his way through the Pyrenees he looted and plundered Basque lands. He found little resistance in Spain until he reached the city of Zaragoza. Charlemagne demanded they surrender. The city governor, Hussain Ibn al-Ansari, refused. Charlemagne then laid siege to the city but with little success. Finally the governor paid Charlemagne a large amount of gold in return for Charlemagne's army leaving the area. Charlemagne had a pending Saxon revolt at home so he needed little persuasion to leave.\nAs Charlemagne marched north back to France he again passed through Basque territory. His large army was deep in the Pyrenees in a long column on August 15, 778. His rearguard was commanded by Roland, one of Charlemagne's most trusted leaders. The rearguard was attacked starting the Battle of Roncevaux Pass. The Basques using their knowledge of the terrain were able to overcome the Frankish rearguard. But their job was to protect the main army so they fought to the last man. The Basques plundered the baggage trains and captured the gold Charlemagne was paid at Zaragoza. Before the Frankish army could turn to fight the Basques, they had gone. Roland and his men died as heroes."}

It is a quick way of measuring how healthy a newborn baby is.\nVirginia Apgar invented the Apgar score in 1952. She was an anesthesiologist, and created the score to measure how babies were affected by anesthesia given to their mothers during childbirth.\nToday, the Apgar score is very commonly used by doctors, nurses, midwives, emergency medical technicians (EMTs), and other medical professionals. One of the reasons it is so popular is that doing an Apgar test is very quick. It usually takes less than a minute, sometimes just seconds.\nWhen an Apgar test is done, five simple things about the newborn baby are checked. The newborn gets a score of 0, 1, or 2 on each of these give things. The scores are added up, and the total is the newborn's Apgar score.\n\"Apgar\" is the name of the woman who invented the Apgar scale. But \"APGAR\" is also a backronym that stands for the things the Apgar scale checks. These are Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, and Respiration.\nWhat the scores mean.\nThe Apgar test is usually done one minute after birth, and again five minutes after birth. It may be repeated later if the score is low and stays low. \nThe main goal of the Apgar score is to see whether the newborn needs medical help. Usually:\nLow scores.\nIf a newborn has a low Apgar score one minute after birth, this does not mean the baby is going to have long-term health problems. This is especially true if the Apgar score is better five minutes after birth.\nBut an Apgar score that stays below 3 at later times\u2014like 10, 15, or 30 minutes after birth\u2014may show that the newborn has brain damage. These newborns are a little more likely to have cerebral palsy. However, the Apgar test cannot predict (say for sure) whether a baby will have long-term health problems."}

The exact timeline of his reign is unknown, although it is estimated to be during the 33rd century BCE. The length of his reign is unknown.\nDiscovery.\nIn 1910 M. J. Cl\u00e9dat, an Egyptologist, discovered the first evidence for king Double Falcon. A farmer at el-Mehemdiah in the north-eastern delta brought him a jar and some incised fragments found while planting a palm-grove in nearby el-Beda. Cl\u00e9dat soon discovered four serekhs of king Double Falcon.\nIn 1912 Hermann Junker found a tomb at Tura, which contained a complete jar with a serekh topped by two falcons.\nMore serekhs of king Double Falcon have been found in the Sinai, in Tell Ibrahim Awad in the eastern delta, in Adaima and Abydos in Upper Egypt, and in the Palmahim quarry in southern Israel. Because these finds have mainly been in Lower Egypt and north-western Sinai, it shows Double Falcon may have only ruled over these areas. However as some of his serekhs have been found in Upper Egypt and Canaan, it shows that the power of the Dynasty 0 kings was spreading. This had already begun towards the end of the Naqada III period, through trading or warfare.\nName.\nThe serekh of Double Falcon is unique. Firstly, it is the only one topped by two Horus falcons, facing each other. Secondly, the serekh does not have a place for the name. Instead this space is filled by vertical lines which usually represent the niched facade of a palace. The serekh does not have the horizontal line that separates the palace facade from the name of the ruler above. Finally, each falcon stands on its own peak. Experts believe that these features are symbolic. The two falcons could represent Lower Egypt and the Sinai, as it seems that Double Falcon reigned over both regions. Dreyer believes that the falcons stand on a on a sign meaning \"mountain\" which is N26 of Gardiner's sign list: N26 He reads the name as \"Dju\" ('), so that the name of the king is shown by a pair of falcons on mountains above a plain serekh. But another expert, van den Brink, reads the name as \"Nebwy\" ('), meaning \"the two lords\", and similar to a much earlier palette on display in the Barbier-Mueller Museum of Geneva."}

It is a set of symptoms that can happen when a person who has drunk alcohol for a long time stops drinking. It can also happen when a person starts drinking less than they used to.\nAlcohol withdrawal can be very dangerous. In the worst cases, it can even kill a person. This is why it is dangerous for people who drink a lot to stop drinking without talking to a doctor first.\nWhy does withdrawal happen?\nAlcohol is a central nervous system depressant. This means that alcohol slows down the activity in some parts of the brain. This can create good feelings, like feeling relaxed and happy.\nIf a person drinks a lot of alcohol, eventually their body will get used to the alcohol. After a while, the person will need to drink more and more alcohol to feel drunk and to slow down parts of their brain. This is called \"tolerance\".\nOnce the body is used to having alcohol (and having parts of the brain slowed down), suddenly taking away the alcohol will cause withdrawal symptoms. The central nervous system is used to being slowed down by alcohol. So without alcohol, the central nervous system gets very excited and over-active.\nA person who gets tolerant to alcohol, and gets withdrawal symptoms when they stop drinking, is \"physically dependent\" on alcohol. This is also called \"physical addiction.\"\nWho gets alcohol withdrawal?\nNot everybody who drinks a lot of alcohol gets withdrawal symptoms when they stop. No one knows why some people get withdrawal symptoms and others do not.\nAbout half of people with alcoholism will get withdrawal symptoms if they drink less than usual. About 5% to 20% of patients withdrawing from alcohol will get the most dangerous form of alcohol withdrawal: delirium tremens. About 1/3 (one out of three) people who have withdrawal seizures will get delirium tremens.\nSymptoms of alcohol withdrawal.\nSymptoms of alcohol withdrawal are mostly caused by a central nervous system that is over-excited and working too hard.\nEverybody has a different set of withdrawal symptoms. Some people have only mild symptoms, like being unable to sleep or feeling anxious. Other people have very bad, life-threatening symptoms, like delirium, hallucinations, very high blood pressures, and very high fevers.\nWithdrawal usually begins 6 to 24 hours after a person takes their last drink. Acute withdrawal can last for up to one week.\nDiagnosis.\nTo be diagnosed with alcohol withdrawal syndrome, patients must have at least two of these symptoms:.\nHow bad are the symptoms?\nMany things affect how bad alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be. The most important things are: \nSymptoms are also grouped together and put into categories based on how bad they are:\nOrder of symptoms.\nEvery person goes through alcohol withdrawal differently. Even the worst of alcohol withdrawal symptoms can happen as soon as 2 hours after a person stops drinking. Because of this, it is best to talk to a doctor, go into the hospital, or get treatment before a person stops drinking alcohol. In many people, however, symptoms usually happen in this order:\n\"Six to 12 hours after the last drink:\"\n\"Twelve to 24 hours after the last drink:\"\n\"24 to 48 hours after the last drink:\"\n\"48 hours after the last drink:\"&lt;BR&gt;\nUsually, people will start to feel better after 48 hours. But sometimes, after 48 hours, alcohol withdrawal can still get worse and turn into delirium tremens. Delirium tremens can last anywhere from 4 to 12 days.\nPost-Acute Withdrawal Syndrome (PAWS).\nAcute alcohol withdrawal usually lasts only a week. But many alcoholics have what is called Post-Acute Withdrawal Syndrome (PAWS) (also called \"protracted alcohol withdrawal syndrome). This means that some withdrawal symptoms continue beyond the acute withdrawal stage. Some withdrawal symptoms can last for at least a year after a person stops drinking.\nSymptoms.\nSymptoms of post-acute withdrawal syndrome (PAWS) can include:\nInsomnia is also a common symptom of PAWS. It often keeps happening after acute (immediate) alcohol withdrawal. Research has showed that people with insomnia are more likely to relapse (start using alcohol again). Studies have found that magnesium or trazodone can help treat insomnia in recovering alcoholics.\nFor some people, the acute phase of alcohol withdrawal can last longer than usual. Protracted (longer than usual) delirium tremens has been reported in medical research, but is not common.\nTreatment.\nPeople with bad alcohol withdrawal symptoms often need to go into a hospital to make sure they are safe while they are withdrawing from alcohol.\nMany different medicines can help with the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal:\nBenzodiazepines.\nBenzodiazepines are the most commonly used medication for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal. They can help decrease alcohol withdrawal symptoms and prevent seizures.\nThe most commonly used benzodiazepines are long-acting (medications whose effects last a long time), like chlordiazepoxide and diazepam (Valium). These seem to be the best medicines for treating delirium, and do not have to be given as often.\nAlthough benzodiazepines work very well at treating alcohol withdrawal, they should be carefully used. Benzodiazepines should only be used for short periods in alcoholics. This is because alcoholics are more likely to get addicted to benzodiazepines. There is a risk of replacing an alcohol addiction with benzodiazepine dependence or adding another addiction. Also, both alcohol and benzodiazepines are depressants. If a person takes both at the same time, they are more likely to get depression or become suicidal.\nVitamins.\nAlcoholics often do not have enough of certain vitamins in their bodies. One of these important vitamins is thiamine. If a person does not have enough thiamine in their body, they can get serious health problems and even brain damage.\nWhen a person is going through alcohol withdrawal, the most important vitamins are thiamine and folic acid. If an alcoholic who stops drinking does not have enough of these vitamins, they can get Wernicke syndrome, a very serious brain problem. To keep this from happening, people who have stopped drinking alcohol are often given thiamine and folic acid intravenously (through a needle placed into a vein). They may also be given other vitamins. This can help prevent Wernicke syndrome.\nAnticonvulsants.\nSometimes, anticonvulsant (anti-seizure) medicines are given to try to prevent seizures.\nSome evidence says that topiramate (Topamax), carbamazepine (Tegretol), and other anticonvulsants are helpful in treating alcohol withdrawal; however, research is limited.\nOther studies have shown that benzodiazepines work just as well as anticonvulsants.\nOther medicines.\nClonidine may be used along with benzodiazepines to help some of the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.\nAntipsychotic medicines, such as haloperidol, are sometimes used along with benzodiazepines to control agitation or psychosis. However, antipsychotics have to be used carefully. They can make alcohol withdrawal worse, since they make it more likely for a person to have a seizure.\nPrognosis.\nIf alcohol withdrawal is not treated correctly, people can die or have permanent brain damage.\nAlcoholics often cannot stop drinking alcohol after their withdrawal symptoms are over. Often, they need support for months or years after withdrawal is over."}

It can also happen when a person who uses a lot of cocaine starts using less cocaine than they did before.\nCocaine (also called coke) is a powerful stimulant. It is an illegal drug outside of hospital usage. It makes people feel very happy, talkative, energetic, and not want to eat as much food.\nSide effects of cocaine.\nCocaine's most dangerous side effects include:\nWithdrawal effects of cocaine.\nAfter using cocaine regularly, some users will become addicted. When a person who is used to using cocaine stops right away, they will go through what is called a \"crash\" along with many of other cocaine withdrawal symptoms, like:\nSome cocaine users also report having similar symptoms to schizophrenia patients and feel that their mind is lost. Some users also report formication: feeling like things are crawling on the skin (also called, \"coke bugs\" or \"spiders\"). These symptoms can last for weeks or, in some cases, months.\nEven after many withdrawal symptoms go away, most users feel like they need to keep using cocaine. This feeling can last for years and may get worse during times of stress. About 30-40% of cocaine addicts start using other kinds of drugs or alcohol after they stop using cocaine.\nTreatment.\nTherapy.\n\"Twelve-step programs\" like Cocaine Anonymous (modeled on Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous) have been widely used to help people addicted to cocaine. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Motivational Therapy (MT) have proven to be more helpful than 12-step programs in treating cocaine dependency. However, both of these approaches have a fairly low success rate.\nIbogaine has been researched a treatment for cocaine dependency. It is used in clinics in Mexico, the Netherlands, and Canada, but it cannot be used legally in the United States.\nNon-drug treatments like acupuncture and hypnosis have been studied. However, these studies have not clearly shown that acupuncture or hypnosis helps with cocaine withdrawal.\nCocaine addiction continues to be the second-most difficult addiction to manage, behind heroin addiction.\nMedications.\nMedications that have been studied to treat cocaine withdrawal include acetylcysteine, baclofen, bupropion, vanoxerine, and vigabatrin.\nKim Janda has been working for years on a vaccination that would treat cocaine use disorders.\nThe anti-depressant desipramine, and the stimulants methylphenidate and pemoline, have been used to treat cocaine dependence in people who also have a mental illness.\nSeveral drugs have been used to treat cocaine withdrawal and cravings:\nFinally, drugs have been used to cause an \"aversion reaction\" (a very bad reaction) when given with cocaine. The most common of these drugs is phenelzine.\nReward-based treatments.\nOn February 14, 2011, two Swiss psychologists published two years' research on cocaine addiction. They found that addicts who gambled were less likely to use cocaine or to relapse on cocaine. They think gambling may refocus the brain's \"reward center\" from cocaine to gambling. They said that psychotherapy should be used along with gambling. More research is being done on long-term relapse rates (the number of people who eventually start using cocaine again).\nHowever, a more recent study looked at prize-based contingency management: a treatment method that offers addicts chances to win prizes if they do not use cocaine. This study found that prize-based contingency management helped cocaine addicts stay off cocaine, whether or not they had gambled recently. This suggests that it is the chance of a reward, not the gambling itself, that helps cocaine addicts stay off of cocaine."}

It is used to reverse the effects of opioid painkillers, especially when a person has overdosed on opioids. Examples of opioids include: \nThese painkillers are central nervous system depressants. This means they slow down certain areas of the brain. If a person takes too many opiates, this can shut down the part of the brain that controls breathing. The person may become unable to breathe and die.\nWhen a person has taken too much of one of these painkillers, naloxone can reverse the painkillers' effects and save the person's life.\nNaloxone may be mixed into the same pill as an opioid painkiller to decrease the risk of misuse. \nWhen given intravenously (into a needle placed into a vein), naloxone works within two minutes. When injected into a muscle, it works within five minutes. The medication may also be shot up the nose. \nThe effects of naloxone last about half an hour to an hour. Since most opioids last longer than naloxone, a person may need several doses of naloxone to fight the effects of an overdose.\nHow does naloxone work?\nWhen a person takes opioids, the opioids have to attach to certain receptor sites in the brain in order to work, like a lock in a keyhole. Once the opioids attach to these opiate receptor sites - like a lock fitting into a keyhole - the opiates start to work. They kill pain, create euphoria, and make people feel calm and relaxed. But if a person takes too many opiates, they can also make it impossible to breathe.\nNaloxone fits better onto these opiate receptor sites than actual opiates do. If a person takes naloxone, the naloxone will throw any opiate off of the opiate receptor sites (like a key getting taken out of a door). Naloxone will stay attached to these opiate receptor sites. This reverses the effects of the opiates that the person took.\nSide effects.\nNaloxone reverses the effects of opiates. Because of this, if a person who is addicted to opiates gets naloxone, they will have symptoms of opioid \"withdrawal\". People have withdrawal symptoms when their body gets used to having opiates all the time.\nBecause naloxone reverses the effects of opiates, the side effects of naloxone can include restlessness, agitation, nausea, vomiting, a fast heart rate, pain, and sweating. To prevent this, small doses every few minutes can be given until the desired effect is reached. \nNaloxone has to be given carefully to people with heart disease. Naloxone can cause more heart problems, like changes in the rhythm of the heart beat, in these people. \nNaloxone seems to be safe in pregnant women. Naloxone is a pure opioid antagonist. \nIn rare cases, naloxone causes seizures and pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs).\nHistory.\nNaloxone was patented in 1961 by Jack Fishman, Mozes J. Lewenstein, and the company Daiichi Sankyo. The drug was approved for opioid overdose by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1971. It is on the World Health Organization's Model List of Essential Medicines, the most important medications needed in a basic health system. \nNaloxone is available as a generic medication and is not very expensive. Its wholesale price is between $0.50 and $5.30 USD per dose.\nMedical uses.\nOpiate overdose.\nNaloxone can be used to reverse opioid overdose and to reduce the slowed breathing or mental depression that opioids can cause.\nNaloxone is included as a part of emergency overdose response kits distributed to heroin and other opioid drug users. This has been shown to reduce deaths due to overdose. \nA prescription for naloxone is recommended if a person is:\nIf naloxone is prescribed to a person, that person should also be taught about how to prevent, identify, and react to an overdose, including how to perform rescue breathing, CPR, and how to call an emergency telephone number like 9-1-1.\nPreventing opioid abuse.\nNaloxone may be mixed with a number of opioids like buprenorphine. (Buprenorphine mixed with naloxone is called Suboxone.) Buprenorphine is used to decrease cravings for opiates. When buprenorphine and naloxone are mixed, and taken by mouth, only buprenorphine has an effect. Buprenorphine is a long-acting partial opioid agonist, meaning that although it binds to the body\u2019s opioid receptors, it produces milder effects over a more prolonged period of time vs. the commonly abused full opioid agonists (heroin fentanyl, oxycodone, etc.). Buprenorphine has a high affinity for the opioid receptor, thereby preventing illicit and prescription opioid painkillers from attaching to the receptor. This leads to a lower risk of overdose and generally doesn\u2019t produce a high in people who use opioids. Naloxone is added to reduce the risk of misuse, as it blocks the effects of buprenorphine if the medication is injected. But if a person misuses Suboxone by injecting it or taking large doses, the naloxone blocks the effect of the opioid. This combination is used to try to prevent abuse. If the patient uses Suboxone long-term or stops its usage rapidly Suboxone withdrawal can occur. Suboxone withdrawal symptoms from quitting its use can begin with 36 hours of the last dosage and last for several weeks. Some of these symptoms include muscle cramps, leg kicking, insomnia, diarrhea, sweating, anxiety, and depression. Because of the discomfort caused by the withdrawal, many patients return to Suboxone use to stop the symptoms.\nThere are two methods of detoxification used for Suboxone users. The first method consists of rapid anesthesia detoxification. Under this treatment, a patient is given anesthesia that places them asleep as the drug is flushed from the body. In this way, the patient avoids most of the severe withdrawal symptoms. The second method is slower. It involves slowly tapering the patient off the drug by reducing dosages consistently until they are no longer administered."}

Normally, the lungs fill with air when a person breathes in. From the alveoli in the lungs, oxygen goes into the blood. The blood then carries oxygen to the entire body. Every part of the body needs oxygen to survive.\nWhen a person has fluid in their lungs (pulmonary edema), there is not enough space left for air to get into the lungs. The person will not be able to breathe in as much air. This means not as much oxygen will get into the blood, and the body will not get the oxygen it needs.\nCauses.\nThe most common cause of pulmonary edema is heart failure on the left side of the heart. The left side of the heart is supposed to pump blood to the entire body. If the left side of the heart is too weak to do this, blood will back up into the lungs. This is called \"cardiogenic pulmonary edema\". (\"Cardiogenic\" means \"caused by the heart.\")\nOther, \"non-cardiogenic\" causes of pulmonary edema include:\nSymptoms.\nSymptoms of pulmonary edema may include:\nFlash pulmonary edema.\nFlash pulmonary edema is a medical emergency. It is pulmonary edema that comes on very quickly. Usually pulmonary edema takes a few hours to develop. But in the worst cases of flash pulmonary edema, a person's lungs can fill completely with fluid in minutes. Flash pulmonary edema can also be caused by moving a person with pulmonary edema, or lying them down.\nTreatment.\nNo matter what the cause is, pulmonary edema can be treated by:\nOther treatments can focus on the cause of the pulmonary edema. For example, if a person with kidney failure has had too much salt or fluid, they can have dialysis to take away the extra fluid and salt."}

{"id": "526658", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=526658", "title": "Serekh", "text": "A serekh was an important type of heraldic crest used in Ancient Egypt.\nAppearance.\nSerekhs, particularly those found throughout Egyptian history, are typically composed of three components: a recessed or niched fa\u00e7ade, the king\u2019s name inscribed in a panel, and a falcon. While both the fa\u00e7ade and name depictions are consistent in history, during a portion of Egyptian history there appears variety among the animal incarnation specified. This can be seen by the falcon being presented singularly, joined alongside a Seth chimera, completely replaced by the Seth, or absent of both. Prominent examples include the mid-Dynasty II\u2019s ruler Peribsen whose serekh exclusively displays the Seth animal and his predecessor, Khasekhemwy, whose serekh joins both falcon and Seth animal. \nDissecting these components, it appears each element serves a purpose in its iconography of kingship. The recessed or niched fa\u00e7ade, which appears at the bottom of the serekh, is often considered associated with the king\u2019s ownership of large building such as a palace or tomb. This rendition would serve both to certify the king\u2019s authority but also to acknowledge his possession of wealth. The panel, which exists between the niched fa\u00e7ade and the falcon, is observed as the space where the king\u2019s name is written. It\u2019s underlying purpose is often debated, however, some claim it to be an allusion to early architectural elements such as the in many pharaonic tombs. On top of this panel, as stated earlier, is often a falcon denoting the god Horus. Horus\u2019s presence in the serekh suggests the name inscribed in the panel as being the king\u2019s Horus name, but the god\u2019s association with kingship often lends credibility to the monarch. Both the Seth and Horus animals can be shown wearing a red, white, or double crown of Egypt and in some instances, appear in control of weapons. Such personification indicates the larger role played by the serekh, and potentially the use of the animal god as a representation of the king. The king himself would often be known to contain or exemplify the \u2018Ka\u2019 of Horus, which was the internal spirit that was later removed following the kings death and transitioned to fill that of the succeeding king. This retention of a godly spirit would be then be used as the deciding testament for the kings right to the throne. This relationship between the king\u2019s Ka and the Horus god in royal serekh\u2019s can be traced to many of the earliest texts and coalesce with the development of early writing. Until Dynasty IV, serekhs served as the only means for royal identification and later become secondary to the cartouche. \nThe name depicted in the panel is denoted as the king\u2019s Horus name- in the case that the Horus animal is depicted- and is a tribute to the belief that kings were considered son of the god Osiris and therefore a semi-divine earthly representation of Horus. This name, which is one of five great names, is further argued to be the king\u2019s Ka name. The characterization of the Horus falcon also provides a means of dating serekhs and further identifying their owner. For instance, Horus's represented in crouching positions is a distinguishing trademark of Dynasty 0 and First Dynasty serekhs. Additionally, the presence of a concave top below the Horus symbol, rather than straight, suggests a date no later than the reign of king Aha. After Dynasty 2, the previously broad falcon tail is also redesigned to become more narrow and straight. \nThe word \"serekh\" comes from the Egyptian word for \"facade\". There are many different serekhs on different types of objects. Many different decorations and details of the facade are shown in many different examples. It seems that there were no strict rules for the design of the serekh.\nUse.\nA serekh was normally used as a royal crest, showing the name of the pharaoh. They have been found as far back as the predynastic Naqada II (Gerzean) period (ca. 3400 BC.). The hieroglyphs forming the king's name were placed inside a rectangular area above the serekh. From the Old Kingdom period onward, the word serekh appears in old papyri.\nA serekh was not only important in validating the authority of the king during his time of rule, but it subsequently allowed fallen kings to maintain a legacy long after death. In the time of ancient Egypt this was especially important as the adoption of a name signified the beginning of one\u2019s existence. This connection between name and existence was so well established that often it was not uncommon for the serekh of a royal to stand in his place. This is captured by the many serekhs exhibiting arms and hands attached to either the falcon animal or the panel element wielding weapons or holding captives. This personification of serekhs suggests an active participance in its surroundings and therefore its role as embodiment of the inscribed king. This anthropomorphizing of glyphs and symbolic images, such as the catfish glyph on an ivory cylinder of Narmer which epitomizes the duality of function, continues throughout Egyptian history and can be seen in a variety of contexts. It is seen most noticeably in the serekh's of king Aha where the falcon god Horus yields a weapon within the confines of the serekh.\nGiven the predominant usage of serekhs in the identification of kingship, especially preceding Dynasty IV, the presence of such also serve to demonstrate Egyptian presence in foreign areas. Inscribed serekhs into natural stone sites provide compelling evidence of travel or expansion of Egyptian populations into such areas. \nPlacement.\nSerekh\u2019s appear on a variety of surface throughout history, progressing alongside the material industry current at the time. Most noticeably appearing on statues and landmarks, they also sit on the likes of many less elaborate medium such as rock or pots. These less precious materials, however, simultaneously exhibit reduced precision and detail of incised serekhs compared to those on more esteemed material such as alabaster. Additionally, names included within serekhs are often short-handed on pottery vessels. Frequently in rock art, such as on stone massifs, serekhs are accompanied by other pictorial hieroglyphs or artistic scenes. The style of artwork placed alongside the serekhs also serves to help date illegible or damaged components. "}

The study was done between 1932 and 1972 by the United States Public Health Service. Its goal was to study how syphilis progressed (got worse) if it was not treated. The study's subjects (the people who were being studied) were poor African American sharecroppers. They were told that they were receiving free health care from the U.S. government.\nThis experiment is infamous because none of the men being studied were told that they had syphilis. Even after the 1940s, when doctors realized that penicillin could cure syphilis, the men were not given this cure, or any other treatment. The men were not told that they were not getting real treatment, or that a cure was available. This study raised many important questions about medical ethics.\nBackground.\nIn the 1930s, when the study started, syphilis was a very serious health problem in the United States. In fact, syphilis had been a serious health problem throughout all of history. Syphilis gets worse over time. It can be very painful. If it is not treated, it causes brain damage and death. In the 1930s, there was no cure for syphilis. The treatments that were used did not work well and some were poisonous. Doctors did not understand syphilis. Because of this they did not have any way to help people with the disease.\nThere had been very few studies done on how syphilis affected people. One study was done in Norway in 1928, but it studied only white men. In the 1930s, people believed that syphilis affected people of different races in different ways. Doctors thought that African Americans' cardiovascular system was more affected by syphilis than the central nervous system. The Tuskegee study group decided to study how syphilis affected African Americans. They reasoned that they could not cure or treat people with syphilis anyway, and that they would learn things that would help doctors understand syphilis better.\nThe experiment.\nBeginnings.\nThe Public Health Service started working on the Tuskegee syphilis experiment in 1932 during the Great Depression. Tuskegee University, a college in Alabama that was open to African-American students, also helped with the study. They helped because they thought the study would improve public health for poor people in the area.\nFor the study, researchers signed up a total of 600 African American men from Macon County, Alabama. A total of 399 of these men had syphilis before the study began. The remaining 201 did not have syphilis. (In research, this healthy group is called a \"control group\"). Researchers wanted to compare the difference between people with and without syphilis. The men were given free health care, meals, and free burial insurance for being in the study.\nThe researchers' original goal was to study the effects of syphilis for just six months. At first, they studied the men in the experiment for six to eight months. They were then given the only treatments that were known at the time. These included arsphenamine (which is now used as a chemotherapy), ointments made of mercury and bismuth. These treatments were all very poisonous. Some treatments helped a little while others made things worse.\nMoney for treatment.\nThe Tuskegee study received money to treat the men in the study from the Rosenwald Fund. This was a major organization from Chicago whose purpose was philanthropy. Specifically, they supported improving black education and developing communities in the South.\nIn 1928, the Rosenwald Fund had worked with Public Health Services in a study of over 2,000 black workers in Mississippi's Delta Pine and Land Company. The study's goal was to see how common syphilis was in this group. The Rosenwald Fund helped provide treatment for 25% of the workers who had tested positive for syphilis. However, in 1929, the Stock Market Crash happened. The Great Depression also began. The Rosenwald Fund said they could no longer pay for medicine to treat the Tuskegee men.\nThe study continues without treatment.\nAfter funding (money) for treatment was lost, the study was continued. The study's subjects were never told that they would never get treatment. In fact, the men were told they were being treated for \"bad blood.\" \"Bad blood\" was a local word that people used to describe different diseases, including syphilis, anemia, and fatigue.\nResearchers started using tricks and lying to the men in the study, without caring about medical ethics or the men's rights. For example, researchers wanted to do lumbar punctures (\"spinal taps\") on the men to measure the effects of syphilis. These spinal taps were dangerous and very painful. To make sure that the men would come get the spinal taps, the researchers sent all 400 subjects a letter titled \"Last Chance for Special Free Treatment.\" This was a lie; the spinal taps were not treatment.\nAll of the study's participants also had to have an autopsy after death in order to receive funeral benefits (money given to their families to pay for a funeral).\nAfter penicillin was discovered as a cure in the 1940s, researchers did not give penicillin to any study participants. They also did not tell any of the participants about penicillin. Many patients were lied to and given placebo treatments so that researchers could keep studying how syphilis affected the men. The researchers did this even though they knew that without treatment, the syphilis would eventually kill the men.\nResearchers keep patients from getting treatment.\nDuring World War II, 250 of the Tuskegee men registered for the draft. These men were given medical exams by the military, and were diagnosed as having syphilis. They were ordered to get treatment for syphilis before they could be taken into the military. But the Tuskegee study's researchers tried to keep these men from getting treatment. A Public Health Service worker was quoted at the time saying: \"So far, we are keeping the known positive patients [the men with syphilis] from getting treatment.\"\nBy 1947, penicillin had become the normal treatment for syphilis. It was not just a treatment, but a cure. The United States government created several public health programs to help people get the cure. The government formed \"rapid treatment centers\" where people could go for penicillin. The governments goal was to eradicate syphilis (to make it not exist any more). But when these programs came to Macon County, study researchers kept the Tuskegee men from participating.\nEnd of the study.\nThe study continued until 1972, when Peter Buxton, who also worked for the Public Health Service, gave information about the experiment to a reporter. This caused the study to end, on November 16, 1972. By that time, all of the Tuskegee men with syphilis had gotten no real treatment for 40 years.\nBy the end of the study in 1972, only 74 of the test subjects were alive. Of the original 399 men, 28 had died of syphilis. Another 100 were dead of related complications. A total of 40 of their wives had been infected and 19 of their children were born with congenital syphilis."}

They were a line of mayors, kings, and princes who succeeded the Merovingian dynasty. The most famous member of the family was Charlemagne. The dynasty was named after Charlemagne's grandfather, Charles Martel. He was a Mayor of the Palace of Austrasia and Neustria. The mayors of the palace were the real power behind the throne. \nCharles Martel (meaning \"the hammer\") left his wealth and power to his two sons, Pepin III and Carloman. In 771 Carloman died leaving his half to Pepin who became Mayor of the Palace. When the last of the Merovingian kings, Childeric III, was deposed by the Pope in Rome, Pepin was made king of the Franks. Pope Stephen III traveled to France and placed the crown on his head. Pepin left the kingdom to his two sons, Charles and Carloman.\nCharles and his brother shared the kingdom for some time. Carloman then traveled to Rome and became a monk. Charles became the sole king. He then earned his name \"Charles the Great\" (Charlemagne) by defeating the Lombards, the Saxons, and the Avars. In 800 Charlemagne was crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Pope Leo III. The dynasty was passed down to his son, Louis the Pious and to his grandsons. By the time Louis inherited the kingdom the Carolingian Empire had already started to decline. By the end of the 9th century it came to an end. With the collapse of the empire the dynasty came to an end."}

They find it very difficult to move and breathe at the same time. The sideways flexing expands one lung and compresses the other, shunting stale air from lung to lung instead of expelling it completely to make room for fresh air.\nIt was named, by English paleontologist Richard Cowen, after David R. Carrier, who wrote his observations on the problem in 1987.\nMany amphibia and reptiles can and do move very fast over short distances. They do it by moving without breathing, which builds up an \"oxygen debt\". Humans sometimes do this when running very quickly. 100-metre sprinters do not breathe during a race. They collapse and recover afterwards. Many reptiles and amphibians are ambush predators, which fits that kind of life quite well. There is no reptile or amphibian equivalent to dogs or deer, with their huge capacity for running long distances. \nThere are, however, some reptiles which get round the Carrier constraint. Snakes, for example have only one lung. And, of course, dinosaurs were bipedal to start with, and most groups stayed bipedal to the end. Lizards run in short bursts with brief pauses. Carrier was able to show that they breathed in the pauses."}

In 1944, World War II was happening, and the Nazis illegally invaded a part of Romania through Hungary. The Nazis deported all of the Jewish people in the area and sent them to concentration camps.\nEarly life.\nPerl was born December 10, 1907, in the town of Sighetu Marma\u0163iei in Romania (called Transylvania at the time). At age 16, she graduated first in her high school class; she was the only woman and the only Jew in the class. She wanted to be a doctor, but at first her father would not let her. Later she told the \"New York Times\":\n\"[My father said] 'I do not want my daughter to lose her faith and break away from Judaism.' ... Several months later, she approached him again, this time with a prayer book he had given her, and said, 'I swear on this book that wherever life will take me, under whatever circumstances, I shall always remain a good, true Jew.' Maurice Perl relented, and she enrolled in medical school. Years later, on the day she was paid a fee by her first patient, she bought another prayer book and had engraved on it her father's name. ...\nHer father carried that book into the crematorium in Auschwitz.\"\nLife in the concentration camps.\nAfter the Nazis invaded Romania, Dr. Perl and her family were sent to Auschwitz concentration camp. There, Dr. Perl's husband, only son, parents, and extended family were all killed by the Nazis. Dr. Perl was allowed to live because she was a doctor. She was given the job of working as a doctor in the camp. Diseases (like all kinds of infections), injuries, malnutrition, and many other problems were very common among the inmates. This was because of horrible living conditions at the camps, where inmates were beaten, not given enough food, not given clean water or toilets, were forced to work very hard, and had to live so close together that diseases spread very quickly. Dr. Perl's job was to help these inmates, but she did not have even the most basic medical supplies, like antiseptic, soap, clean cloths for wounds, medicine, or even running water.\nDr. Perl is most famous for saving the lives of hundreds of women by aborting their pregnancies. This saved the women's lives because pregnant women were often beaten and killed, or used by Dr. Josef Mengele for vivisections (which means they were cut open without any anesthesia. In 1982, Dr. Perl recalled:\n\"The greatest crime in Auschwitz was to be pregnant. ... Dr. Mengele told me that it was my duty to report every pregnant woman to him... He said that they would go to another camp for better nutrition, even for milk. So women began to run directly to him, telling him, 'I am pregnant.' I learned that they were all taken to the research block to be used as guinea pigs [in medical experiments], and then two lives would be thrown into the crematorium. I decided that never again would there be a pregnant woman in Auschwitz.\"\nIn January 1945, Russian soldiers were getting close to Auschwitz. The Nazis sent everyone in Auschwitz to another concentration camp called Bergen-Belsen. In April 1945, British soldiers freed the camp. As the soldiers were moving in to free the camp, Dr. Perl was delivering a baby.\nAfter leaving Bergen-Belsen, Dr. Perl found out that both her husband and son had died. She tried to kill herself with poison, and was sent to recover in a convent in France. She stayed there until 1947.\nLife in the United States.\nIn March 1947, Dr. Perl went to New York City and tried to become an American citizen. Instead of being treated as a victim of the Nazi concentration camps, she was treated as a suspect. She was interrogated and accused of helping the Nazi doctors at Auschwitz carry out human rights abuses. She was finally granted citizenship in 1951.\nDr. Perl began work as a gynecologist in New York's Mount Sinai Hospital, and delivered around 3,000 babies in New York alone. She became an expert in infertility treatment, helping couples who were having trouble getting pregnant.\n\"I was a Doctor in Auschwitz\".\nIn June 1948, Gisella Perl published her story, called \"I was a Doctor in Auschwitz\". In the book, she talks about the horrors she saw there as an inmate doctor. The book includes Perl's descriptions of Joseph Mengele's experiments; of how she tried to save as many inmates as possible; and how the Nazi doctors would order operations on young women's breasts without anesthetics, because the warden, Irma Grese, liked watching them suffer.\nPublications.\nDr. Perl was later reunited with her daughter, Gabriella Krauss Blattman, whom she managed to hide during the war. They both moved to live in Herzliya, Israel. Perl died in Israel in 1988. She was the sole author or coauthor of nine papers on vaginal infections published between 1955 and 1972.\nIn 2003, a film entitled \"Out of the Ashes\" was released. It was based upon the story of Dr. Perl's life, and starred Christine Lahti as Dr. Perl."}

{"id": "526844", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=526844", "title": "Tension pneumothorax", "text": "A tension pneumothorax is when air builds up inside the chest. So much air builds up that one or both lungs may collapse. This causes serious breathing problems. Also, the air in the chest pushes on the heart and other important parts of the body, and causes other serious problems. If it is not treated quickly, a tension pneumothorax will kill a person.\nHow does a tension pneumothorax happen?\nA tension pneumothorax usually happens because of an injury to the chest. For example, a knife or gunshot wound will cause a hole in a person's chest. Air then gets sucked in through that hole. The air starts to build up. It pushes on the lungs. If the knife or gun has also caused a hole in the person's lung, air will leak out of the lung. That air will also build up in the chest. When enough air is pushing on the lung, the lung will collapse.\nA tension pneumothorax can also happen because of other kinds of chest injury, like from a car accident or a fall. When a person gets injured this way, there may not be any hole in his chest. But inside the body, the person may be bleeding badly. Instead of air, blood builds up in the chest. It pushes on the lung and makes it collapse. This is called a \"hemothorax\".\nWhat happens as a tension pneumothorax gets worse?\nOnce a person's lung collapses, they will have trouble breathing. As air or blood keeps building up in the chest, the person's symptoms will keep getting worse.\nThe air or blood in the chest will push against and squeeze the heart. This can cause serious problems. If the heart is squeezed too much, it cannot fill with blood very well. This means it does not have enough blood to pump to the rest of the body. Every part of the body needs blood to survive. If the heart cannot pump enough blood to the body, other parts of the body can start to die.\nPressure in the chest can also squeeze the vena cavae, the big veins that bring blood from the body back to the heart. If the vena cavae are squeezed too tightly, blood will not be able to get into the heart. This means the heart will not have enough blood to pump to the lungs or the rest of the body.\nIf a person bleeds enough into their chest, they can go into shock and die from blood loss.\nIf enough pressure builds up in the chest, the other lung can collapse, too. If both lungs have collapsed, there will be no way for the person to breathe.\nSymptoms.\nA tension pneumothorax will cause some other symptoms. For example:\nTreatment.\nA tension pneumothorax always needs emergency medical treatment. If a person may have a tension pneumothorax (or has any bad injury to the chest), 911 or another emergency telephone number should be called right away. The emergency medical dispatcher will be able to explain how to help the person until an ambulance gets there.\nEmergency medical technicians (EMTs) or paramedics may give these treatments for a tension pneumothorax:\nAt the hospital, a patient with a tension pneumothorax will be given a chest tube. This is a tube that is placed into the chest so that air or blood can get out and does not build up inside. If the person has bled a lot into their chest, they may also get blood transfusions."}

It is found in forested habitats across tropical Asia. It is found in a wide range across the Indian Subcontinent, Southeast Asia and East Asia. There are a number of variations and some authorities prefer to treat several of its subspecies as completely separate species. In the past, several species including the Philippine serpent eagle (\"S. holospila\"), Andaman serpent eagle (\"S. elgini\") and South Nicobar serpent eagle (\"S. klossi\") were treated as subspecies of the Crested serpent eagle.\nPhysical description.\nAll members within the species complex have a large looking head with long feathers on the back of the head giving them a crested appearance. The face is bare and yellow joining up with the beak. Its powerful feet are unfeathered and heavily scaled. They fly over the forest canopy on broad wings and their tails have wide white and black bars. They call often with a loud, piercing and familiar three or two-note call.\nBehavior.\nThis raptor sits motionless from a high perch watching for prey. When prey is found it drops almost straight down to pounce. They often feed on snakes, giving them their name and are placed along with the \"Circaetus\" snake-eagles in the subfamily \"Circaetinae\". In addition to snakes it catches reptiles as well as small mammals and birds. It will take a dead snake whenever it finds one. They are often seen soaring over their territory in pairs. In Japan they are usually found very close to forest edges and wet marshlands.\nRole in the ecosystem.\nCrested serpent eagles are apex predators and at the top of their food chain. They are a good indicator of the health of the ecosystem they occupy. They control snake populations and also those of other small mammals and reptiles. They are a common sight in places such as India. The species is not globally threatened. On most lists they are of least concern."}

They are the superfamily Coccoidea. There are about 8,000 described species of scale insects. They are ectoparasites of plants, like most bugs. They sit on the outside of plants, stick their mouthparts inside, and suck up the plant sap.\nAdult female scales usually do not move: they are permanently attached to the plant they have parasitized. They secrete a waxy coating for defence. The coating makes them look like fish scales, hence their common name.\nMales and females are quite different form each other. This is sexual dimorphism. Female scale insects keep their juvenile shape even when sexually mature (a condition known as neoteny). Adult males usually have wings (depending on their species) but never feed, and die within a day or two.\nThe details of their reproductive systems vary greatly between species. Three types of hermaphroditism are known, and at least seven forms of parthenogenesis.\nTheir young, known as crawlers, lose the use of their legs if they are female, and stay put for life. Only the males keep their legs and use them in seeking females for mating.\nPest control.\nMany scale insects are serious crop pests. The waxy covering protects them from contact insecticides. However, scales may be controlled. Horticultural oils suffocate them, and systemic pesticides poison the sap of the host plants. Biological control agents such as tiny parasitoid wasps and Coccinellid beetles also work on them. \nInsecticidal soap may also be used against scales. "}

It is located on the south side of Kaveri river in Thanjavur in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is also known as \"Periya Kovil\", \"RajaRajeswara Temple\" and \"Rajarajeswaram\". It is one of the largest temples in India. Peruvudaiyaar Kovil is an example of Tamil architecture from the Chola period. It was built by Tamil King Raja Raja Chola I and completed in 1010\u00a0AD. The temple turned 1000 years old in 2010. The temple is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the \"Great Living Chola Temples\", along with Brihadeeswarar Temple, Gangaikonda Cholapuram and Airavatesvara temple.\nHistory.\nThe temple has fortified walls that were probably added in the 16th century. The \"vimanam\" (temple tower) is high and is the tallest in the world. The \"Kumbam\" (the apex or the bulbous structure on the top) of the temple is carved out of a single rock and weighs around 80 tons. There is a big statue of Nandi (sacred bull), carved out of a single rock measuring about long and high at the entrance. The entire temple structure is made out of granite.\nThe nearest sources of which are about 60\u00a0km to the west of temple. The temple is one of the most visited tourist attractions in Tamil Nadu. the temple consists of nandi mandapa, a pillared potico and an assembly hall, all interconnected.\nA study in Oriental architecture or history is certainly incomplete without a mention of the Tanjore Brihadeeshwara Temple or the Tanjore Periya Kovil (Big Temple).\nThis imposing structure was built by Raja Raja Cholan and his sister Kundavai, both ardent devotees of Lord Shiva. It was constructed by the King at the height of the Chola reign to signify his power and strength. Here are a few facts not known about this Chola temple of Thanjavur:\na) The original name of the deity was Rajarajeshwar. It was the Marathas who gave it the name Brihadeeshwara or the Great Ishwara.\nb) The main temple is entirely built of granite. More than 130,000 tons of granite is said to have been used to build it.\nc) A long associated myth with this temple temple is that the shadow of the main structure does not fall on the ground. However, this has been proven wrong by scientists.\nd) The statue of Nandi at the entrance of the temple is carved out of a single stone.\ne) The main Vimanam, which is at about 200\u00a0feet is often called Dakshin Meru or Southern Meru.\nf) The inspiration to build the temple came to Raja Raja Cholan during his visit to Sri Lanka and is a result of a dream he had.\ng) The temple has a portrait of Raja Raja Cholan paying obeisance to Lord Natarajar. This is undoubtedly, the first ever instance of a royal portrait.\nh) Inscriptions in the temple point towards Kunjara Mallan Raja Raja Perunthachan as the chief architect of the temple. His successors survive to this day and practice the art of Vastu or Vastu Shastra.\ni) Depictions of nartakis or dancers showing eighty one of hundred and eight karanas (synchronised movements of hands and feet) in Bharata Natyam are carved here. These karanas are a part of karanas mentioned in the Natya Shastra of Bharata Muni or Sage Bharata. There is also evidence that the temple was a platform for talented dancers to showcase their talent. These depictions are first of their kind.\nj) The inscriptions also mention the different kinds of jewels used in the period. Each of these jewels are mentioned in detail. A total of twenty three different types of pearls, eleven varieties of diamonds and rubies are mentioned in these inscriptions.\nk)The earliest design plan of the temple date back to 921\u00a0AD indicating this took multiple generations to complete.\nWhat astounds historians is that there was not a single granite quarry in about 100\u00a0km radius of the temple. This means that transporting these stones would have been a herculean task. But Raja Raja Cholan insisted on the use of these stones. All of these features make this Chola temple of Tanjore, a magnum opus of the Chola reign.\nBrihadeeswarar temple is one of the few temples that have Ashta-dikpaalakas (Guardians of the directions) idols. Chola frescoes adorn the wall of the temple and these frescoes depict Shiva in different poses. Brihadeeswarar temple is the first complete granite temple in the world. Around 60,000 tons of granite is said to be used to build the temple.\nBrihadeeswarar temple, also known as the Tanjore big temple expounds the number of alphabets in Tamil by the distance and height it is designed.\nTamil is a language that has totally 247 Tamil letters which are assorted as\nUyir Ezhuthu(Soul Letters) - 12\nMei Ezhuthu(Body Letters) - 18\nUyir-Mei Ezhuthu(Soul-Body Letters) - 216\nAyutha Ezhuthu - 1\nThe height of Gopuram is 216\u00a0feet = The number of letters in Uyir Mei Ezhuthu(216)\nThe height of Lord Shiva in the form of Lingam* inside the temple is 12\u00a0feet = The number of letters in Uyir Ezhuthu(12)\nThe height of Sivalinga peedam** is 18\u00a0feet = The number of letters in Mei Ezhuthu (18)\nThe distance between the Sivalingam and the Nandhi is 247\u00a0feet = The total number of Tamil letters present that includes Ayutha Ezhuthu(247)"}

It was also used by the Byzantine empire from 988 A.D. to 1453, when the empire fell, and by Russia from 988 A.D. to 1700. The Byzantine calendar is like the Julian calendar, but the year starts on 1 September instead of 1 January. Year one of the Byzantine calendar is from 1 September, 5509 B.C. to 31 August, 5508 B.C.\nBackground.\nThe Great Schism, dated to 1054, created two religions from what was formerly one. The Western part later became the Roman Catholic Church. The Eastern part is known as the Eastern Orthodox Church. At that time the Roman Catholic church used the Julian calendar. In 1453 the Byzantine Empire collapsed ending the use of their calendar. But others still used it, notably Russia. Numbering differences began to appear when the Gregorian calendar was introduced in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII.\nOther differences.\nThe Roman calendar did not include dates for Old Testament prophets. The Byzantine calendar does.\nRussia.\nPeter the great became tsar of Russia in 1682. At the time the Russians used a form of the Julian calendar with Byzantine influence. The calendar year started on 1 September and not 1 January. The years were numbered from the date given as earth's creation and not from the birth of Christ. Peter changed the calendar to start on January 1 and numbered the years from Christ's birth. But he continued basing the calendar on the Julian system instead of the Gregorian calendar. By the early 1800s the Russian calendar was 12 days behind the Gregorian calendar used by western Europe. So dating something between the two systems became a problem. Dating notations such as 1 March O.S. (meaning Old Style, Julian or Russian) were used. Another example is 16 May 1582 N.S. (New Style or Gregorian calendar). Other notations included both: 25 October/6 November 1917, trying to show how the same day appeared in different calendars. \nOn 1 January 1700, by decree of Peter the Great, the Russian/Byzantine calendar was no longer used."}

These include floppy disks, USB flash drives, SD cards and other high capacity storage devices. \nA FAT is a list of clusters that show where a computer file is stored. These clusters are not necessarily right next to each other but can be scattered over the disk or storage medium. The FAT is always located in the first few clusters of a storage device.There are always two identical copies, one being a backup of the other.\nThe FAT file system is a legacy file system that is both simple and robust. It works well even in lightweight uses. But it cannot deliver the same speed, reliability and scalability as some modern file systems. It is, however, supported for compatibility reasons by nearly all currently developed operating systems for personal computers. It is also supported by many mobile devices and embedded systems. That makes it a well suited format for data exchange between computers and devices of almost any type and age from 1981 up to the present.\nHistory.\nIt was originally designed in 1977 for use on floppy disks. FAT was soon adapted and used almost universally on hard disks throughout the DOS and Windows 9x eras for two decades. As disk drives improved, the capabilities of the file system have been extended accordingly. This has resulted in three major file system variants: FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32. The FAT standard has also been expanded in other ways while generally preserving backward compatibility with existing software.\nWith the introduction of more powerful computers and operating systems FAT is no longer the default file system for use on Microsoft Windows computers.\nModern use.\nFAT file systems are still commonly found on floppy disks, USB sticks, flash and other solid-state memory cards. DCF uses FAT as the standard file system for digital cameras. FAT is also utilized in the boot stage of EFI-compliant computers."}

To the person getting the cheque, it is a paper that allows them to go to a bank and get money. To the person writing the cheque, it is a promise to pay the bank that is giving the money to the person who turned the cheque in.\nCheques must be written to a person or business. A cheque that is not written to anyone can be very bad because if it is lost, anyone who finds it can get the money. A cheque that is written to a person but does not have the amount of money written is a blank cheque.\nCheques have been used since over a thousand years ago. However, they became popular in the 20th century for paying money without using cash.\nParts of a cheque.\nThe four main parts of a cheque are:\nWhen more people started to use cheques, more things were added to make them more secure and easy to track. They started to require the drawer's signature to be confirmed. The signature on a cheque is the main way to tell if a cheque is real. Cheques also started to need the amount written in words and numbers. This made it harder to make mistakes and harder to change the cheque after it was already written.\nIssue dates have also been added to cheques. A cheque is invalid if a long time has passed since the issue date. A cheque with an issue date in the past is called an antedated cheque. A cheque with an issue date in the future is called a post-dated cheque. Usually, a person cannot get money from a post-dated cheque until after the issue date has passed.\nCheque numbers are also used often. Every cheque has a different cheque number. This is to make sure people can't get money twice from one cheque."}

It has 28 (twenty-eight) letters.\nThe Esperanto alphabet is based on the Roman alphabet (which the English alphabet is also based on). Unlike the English alphabet, it does not have the letters \"q\", \"w\", \"x\" or \"y\", but it has 6 (six) letters that use a diacritic (a special mark above a letter): \"\u0109\", \"\u011d\", \"\u0125\", \"\u0135\", \"\u015d\" and \"\u016d\".\nAlternative writings.\nBecause Esperanto uses letters with diacritics, there was (and sometimes still is) the need to write text in Esperanto even if the special letters are not available.\nL. L. Zamenhof, the creator of Esperanto, proposed the so-called \"h-system\" (\"h-sistemo\" in Esperanto). Instead of diacritics, the letter \"h\" is added, with the only exception being \"\u016d\". For example, \"\u011d\" becomes \"gh\", \"\u0125\" becomes \"hh\" and \"\u016d\" becomes \"u\". Words which appear to have a diacritic but do not actually can be \"broken\" with a hyphen or an apostrophe. For example, \"flughaveno\" (airport) becomes \"flug-haveno\" or \"flug'haveno\".\nAnother system used to replace diacritics is the \"x-system\" (\"x-sistemo\" in Esperanto). The letter \"x\" is not used in the Esperanto alphabet, but it can be used to write diacritics. The x-system, unlike the h-system, does not treat \u016d differently from the other letters. For example, \"\u011d\" becomes \"gx\", \"\u0125\" becomes \"hx\" and \"\u016d\" becomes \"ux\". \"flughaveno\" remains the same, as there is no ambiguity.\nUnicode and HTML.\nThe whole Esperanto alphabet is part of the Latin-3 and Unicode character sets, and it is included in WGL4. \nThe code points and HTML entities for the special Esperanto characters in Unicode are:\nCriticism.\nSome people say that use of the diacritics (the letters \u0109, \u011d, \u0125, \u0135, \u015d, \u016d) makes the language less natural than it would be using only the basic letters of Latin alphabet. The letters \u0109, \u011d, \u0125, \u0135 are not used in any other language in the world.\nAccording to some people, the phonetic system of Esperanto is too similar to the Polish dialect of Bia\u0142ystok, home town of Zamenhof.\nSeveral people consider using the Latin alphabet not to be neutral. In fact, many native languages on each continent (except for Antarctica) use the Latin alphabet to write: for example, German (Europe), Swahili (Africa), Vietnamese (Asia), Tahitian (Oceania), Cree (North America) and Apala\u00ed (South America)."}

There is really no word in the English language that fully explains what a Griot does. Not every griot does all these things, but these are some examples of what their function is. \nTheir role.\nA griot was a public servant, an artist, and a royal counselor. His fate depended on the prosperity and survival of the king or queen he served. He preserved the oral history of his tribe or people. In the Caribbean and the Americas he was the link to their African culture and history. The griot was the only person that could keep their past history in Africa alive. Troubadour and poet, diplomat and diviner only begin to describe his functions. Each clan, village, and warrior-family had a griot. They kept track of all births, marriages, deaths, battles and other tribal histories. Griots were also said to have the ability to see one's future. They could memorize the history of every member of a clan or tribe going back for centuries.\nWho could become a griot.\nThe position of a griot was traditionally passed down from father to son. A griot was born into and trained by a griot family. For those not born into griot families, sometimes there was a master griot who taught the arts associated with the position. Today there are state-sponsored and private schools that teach griot arts. But they focus on the musical aspects and not the verbal skills."}

IANA is a nonprofit corporation that handles many Internet-related symbols and numbers.\nResponsibilities.\nIANA is in charge of allocating numbers like IP addresses used in Internet protocols. These protocols are published in Request for Comments (RFC)\u00a0documents. IANA works with the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the RFC editorial team.\nAssigning IP addresses and domain names needs more administration. IANA delegates these to smaller administrations because of the many layers involved.\nIP addresses.\nIANA gives IP addresses in blocks to regional internet registries (RIRs). Each RIR assigns addresses for a different part of the world. All the RIRs formed the Number Resource Organization to coordinate with each other.\nRIRs split their address pools into smaller chunks and give them to Internet service providers in their region. IANA assigns addresses\u00a0with\u00a0a /8 prefix\u00a0for IPv4. It also assigns IPv6 addresses with /23 and /12 prefixes. These IPv6 addresses come from the 2000::/3 IPv6 address block. Because IPv4 addresses have run out, IANA does not assign them any more.\nDomain names.\nIANA also manages the top layer of the Domain name system (DNS). It works with many different server operators and policy makers from ICANN.\nIANA also manages .int domains for international organizations, and .arpa for reverse DNS.\nProtocol parameters.\nIANA is also involved in Internet Engineering Task Force protocols, like uniform resource identifier (URI) schemes. It also recommends character encodings to use on the Internet. IANA has to listen to the Internet Architecture Board when doing this.\nTime zone database.\nIANA also has a database containing time zone differences and rules.

Synthetic cannabis is often called K2, Spice, or fake weed. \"Synthetic\" means \"man-made\"; \"Cannabis\" is the plant that marijuana is made from. \nSynthetic cannabis is not really man-made marijuana. It has no marijuana, and no chemicals from the \"Cannabis\" plant, in it. Instead, it is sprayed with man-made chemicals called \"cannabinoids.\" In the brain, they act like the chemicals in real marijuana (like THC). Because of this, they can make a person feel \"high\" the same way real marijuana can.\nSafety.\nMedical research has shown that synthetic cannabis is much more dangerous than regular marijuana. For example, one research study found that people who used synthetic cannabis were 30 times more likely to get emergency medical treatment than people who used regular marijuana. \nSynthetic cannabinoids can also cause much more serious symptoms and health problems than regular marijuana. These problems can include:\nResearch, and the experiences of people who try to stop taking synthetic cannabis, show that it causes addiction and withdrawal symptoms in some people.\nProfessor John W. Huffman, who first created many of the chemicals used in synthetic cannabis, has said: \"People who use it are idiots. You don't know what it's going to do to you.\"\nLegal issues.\nSynthetic cannabis has had a complicated legal history. Its makers have used many different strategies to keep their products from being illegal.\nFor example, synthetic cannabis is often sold in packages that call it \"herbal incense.\" Most of the packages also have a warning label that says \"Not for human consumption\" (not for humans to put into their bodies). By doing these things, companies that make synthetic cannabis can say that they are not selling drugs, and it is not their fault if people ignore their warning label.\nIt has also been difficult for states and countries to make synthetic cannabis illegal because there are so many different cannabinoids. For example, in 2009, the United Kingdom made all the cannabinoids that existed illegal. However, scientists quickly created new versions of cannabinoids, which were not listed as illegal in the U.K.'s laws. Like many other countries, the United Kingdom has tried to ban every new cannabinoid as soon as it is created, but new ones are made all the time.\nMost countries in Europe, and a few countries in Asia, have made some or all synthetic cannabinoids illegal.\nUnited States.\nBefore 2010, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) had made some of the cannabinoids used in synthetic marijuana illegal in the U.S. Other cannabinoids were not illegal. Some states passed laws on their own, to make synthetic cannabis illegal in their states. However, before 2010, not all cannabinoids were illegal in the United States.\nOn June 6, 2010, a teenager from Iowa named David Mitchell Rozga killed himself. His friends said they and Rozga had smoked synthetic cannabis about an hour before he shot himself. Rozga's suicide, and the idea that it might have been caused by synthetic cannabis, was reported in newspapers and media all over the world.\nAfter Rozga's suicide, the DEA used \"emergency powers\" to make five cannabinoids often found in synthetic marijuana illegal. Also, after the suicide, United States Senator Chuck Grassley suggested a law called the \"David Mitchell Rozga Act.\" This law would make using or selling synthetic cannabis illegal. The law was passed by the United States Congress in June 2011. \nOn July 10, 2012, President Barack Obama signed the Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act of 2012 into law. It made the most common chemicals used in synthetic marijuana illegal."}

She was a guard at the Nazi concentration camps at Ravensbr\u00fcck and Auschwitz. She was also the warden of the women's part of Bergen-Belsen concentration camp.\nGrese was nicknamed \"the Hyena of Auschwitz\" () by prisoners there because of the cruel ways she treated them. After World War II ended, Grese was put on trial for war crimes at the Nuremberg Trials. She was convicted of crimes against humanity for the things she did at Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen. She was executed in 1945 at age 22.\nEarly life.\nIrma Grese was born in Germany in 1923. In 1936, when Grese was 13, her mother killed herself by drinking hydrochloric acid, a poison, after finding out that her husband had an affair (a relationship with another woman). Grese's father probably joined the Nazi Party in 1937, and got married again in 1939.\nWhen she was 14, Grese quit school. By then, she was a member of the League of German Girls (\"Bund Deutscher M\u00e4del\"), a Nazi group for girls.\nConcentration camp guard.\nGrese volunteered to work in a concentration camp. In 1942, when she was 19 years old, she started working as a guard at Ravensbr\u00fcck, a concentration camp for women. In March 1943, she was sent to work at Auschwitz-Birkenau. After a year, Grese was promoted to \"Rapportf\u00fchrerin\" - warden - at Bergen-Belsen. This was the second-highest rank that a woman could reach. In this job, she helped choose which prisoners would be killed in the concentration camp's gas chambers.\nWhen British soldiers were getting close to Bergen-Belsen to liberate it (take it over and free its prisoners), Grese and some other people in the SS decided not to run away. They were captured by the British on 17 April 1945, and taken to prison.\nIn her famous memoir called \"Five Chimneys\", Olga Lengyel (who had been a prisoner in a camp where Grese worked) wrote about how Grese acted there. Lengyel wrote that Grese liked hurting prisoners, making them afraid of her, and choosing which ones would be killed in the gas chambers.\nTrial and execution.\nGrese was put on trial for war crimes at the \"Belsen Trial.\" Instead of having one big trial with hundreds of defendants, the Nuremberg Trials were separated into smaller trials. For example, people who were accused of committing crimes at Bergen-Belsen were put on trial at the Belsen Trial. Grese was tried there with 44 other people. Her trial lasted from September to November 1945. She was given a lawyer named Major L. Cranfield.\nGrese was accused of treating prisoners in ways that were illegal because of an international law called the Third Geneva Convention. People who had been prisoners in the camps Grese worked at talked about how Grese murdered and tortured prisoners. They said she especially liked to hurt women. They talked about how Grese beat prisoners, let her dogs attack them, whipped them, and shot them. They said she liked to whip women's breasts, and then make the camp doctor, Gisella Perl, do surgery on the women's breasts without anesthetic, because she liked watching them suffer.\nTwo other female guards were tried at the Belsen Trial. However, Grese was the only woman to get the death penalty.\nOn Thursday, 13 December 1945, in Hamelin Jail, Grese was executed by hanging."}
