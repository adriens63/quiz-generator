The title of 'Peer of France' was an extraordinary honour granted only to a small number of princes, dukes, counts of the Roman Catholic Church.\nFrench peerage thus differed from British peerage (to whom the term \"baronage\", also employed as the title of the lowest noble rank, was applied in its generic sense), for the vast majority of French nobles, from baron to duke, were not peers. It was analogous to the rank of Grandee of Spain in this respect.\nIt was abolished in 1789 during the French Revolution."}

Ununennium is the element with the smallest atomic number that has not been created yet. Qualities of Ununennium are unknown, but many are predicted. It is predicted all isotopes will be radioactive. It is thought to be an alkali metal.\nMany attempts have been made by American, German, and Russian teams to make ununennium but all have failed. Japanese and Russian teams plan to work on it in 2019 and 2020.\nPredicted chemistry.\nUnunennium's spot on the periodic table is a sign that it may be similar to lighter elements such as lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, and francium; however, some of its properties may be different from what is expected. For example, ununennium might be less reactive than caesium and francium and will behave more like potassium or rubidium.\nUses.\nAs of 2021, it has yet to be created and therefore has no use."}

She is known for inventing a computerized telephone switching method which \"revolutionized modern communication\" according to several reports.This architecture used \"stored program control\" to achieve an unprecedented level of flexibility.\nHoover was awarded one of the first patents issued for software. It gave priority to processes concerned with the input and output of the switch over processes that were less important such as record keeping and billing. This provided more robust service to callers during peak calling times. Some of her work was done while she was recuperating from the birth of her second daughter in the hospital and at home.\nHoover received a B.A. from Wellesley College in classical and medieval philosophy and history in 1948. After graduating with honors in 1948, she was inducted into Phi Beta Kappa, an honor society of liberal arts and sciences, and was honored as a Durant Scholar. She obtained a Ph.D. from Yale University in philosophy and foundations of mathematics in 1951. She was a professor in Swarthmore College from 1951 to 1954. Upon marrying her husband, Hoover found it difficult to secure a tenure track position, so she joined Bell Labs. Later, she worked on the development of the Safeguard Anti-Ballistic Missile System and subsequently became the first woman to head a technical department in 1978. She spent the next decade working on software applications with a particular focus on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and IMS-IBM/Unix based system communications. In 1987, after three decades of dedication to improving telecommunications as we know it, Dr. Hoover retired.\nDr. Hoover was keen on publicizing the importance of K-12 education, focusing on the lack of female representation in STEM. She created one of the first conferences for the Expanding Your Horizons program in association with the American Association of the University of Women and Girl Scouts of America. She continued with a fervent focus on education as she joined the New Jersey Board of Higher Education in 1983 and has served as a chairperson of the Trenton State College Board of Trustees since 1980.\nHoover was described as an important pioneer for women in the field of computer technology."}

The Orthodox Byzantine Empire was under threat by the Turks, who were invading Anatolia and established the mighty Sultanate of Rum, whose name expressed succeeding to the '[Eastern] Roman' empire.\nRoger de Flor's offer was accepted by both Byzantium and by the Crown of Aragon, rulers in Sicily and southern Italy, who were quite eager to rid themselves of unemployed and unruly soldiers. Roger de Flor departed with 39 galleys and transports carrying around 1,500 knights and 4,000 Almogavars, special foot soldiers employed mainly serving the kingdom's interests in the Mediterranean Sea, especially from Catalonia, Valencia and Aragon.\nRoger de Flor arrived in Constantinople with the help of king Frederick III of Sicily in 1303, and married the niece of Andronicus, daughter of the Tsar of Bulgaria, and was named Megas Doux ('Great Dux', i.e. head of the fleet). Roger de Flor campaigned with his Company in Anatolia, defeating the Turks but also engaging in widespread violence and looting of the Byzantine inhabitants. By this point, the Catalans, were considered by the Byzantines to be little better than brigands and freebooters. \nEnd of Roger de Flor.\nThis put him at odds with the Byzantine Emperor, and the indiscipline of the Almogavars marked the end of Roger de Flor. On 30 April 1305, he was slain along with 300 cavalry and 1,000 infantry by the Alans, another group of foreign mercenaries at the service of the Emperor. \nThe Company proceeded to devastate the Balkanic regions of Thrace and Macedonia for the next two years, including an attack on Thessalonica by land and sea, and raids against the monasteries on Mount Athos. Until recently no Catalans were allowed on the Athos peninsula by the Athonite monks.The struggle ended with the departure of both the Infante and Ferran, and with Bernat de Rocafort becoming leader of the Company. \nBernat de Rocafort offered the Company's services to Charles of Valois to strengthen his claim to the Byzantine Empire and whom the Count of Barcelona had expelled from Sicily before founding the Company in a dynastic war for the Crown of Aragon. In 1309, Charles of Valois' deputy Thibault de Chepoy ended the leadership of Rocafort, arresting him and sending him to Naples where he died of hunger the same year. \nIn 1318 the Company expanded its power into Thessaly, taking control of the Duchy of Neopatria.\nEnd of the Company.\nThe Catalan rule was to last until 1388\u20131390, when they were defeated by the Navarrese Company under Pedro de San Superano, Juan de Urtubia, and allied with the Florentines under Nerio I Acciaioli of Corinth. His descendants controlled them until 1456 when they were conquered by the Ottoman Empire. By that time, like many military enterprises, the Great Company had faded out of history.\nChronicle of muntaner.\nThe early history of the Catalan Company was chronicled by Ramon Muntaner, a former member of the company, in his \"Cr\u00f2nica\"."}

This is the height of the north peak after the landslide of December 1991 which took 30 meters off the top and also turned the summit into a knife-edge ridge. \nHistory.\nThe mountain was named by Captain John Lort Stokes in honour of Captain James Cook who travelled around the islands of New Zealand in 1770 however the first Europeans to see Mount Cook were probably members of Abel Tasman's crew. \nClimbing.\nIt was first climbed by Tom Fyre, George Graham and Jack Clarke.

Some of them are \"Scarface\" (1932), \"Bringing Up Baby\" (1938), \"Only Angels Have Wings\" (1939), \"His Girl Friday\" (1940), \"To Have and Have Not\" (1944), \"The Big Sleep\" (1946), \"Red River\" (1948), \"The Thing from Another World\" (1951), and \"Rio Bravo\" (1959). Hawks often included strong women who talked a lot in his films. This kind of woman was in so many of Hawks's films that people now call that type of woman a \"Hawksian woman.\"\nIn 1942, other movie people in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nominated Hawks for the Academy Award for Best Director for his work making \"Sergeant York.\" In 1975 the Academy gave Hawks an Honorary Academy Award Hawks's work has influenced some of the most popular movie directors such as Martin Scorsese, Robert Altman, John Carpenter, and Quentin Tarantino.\nEarly life and education.\nFamily.\nHoward Winchester Hawks was born in Goshen, Indiana, the first child of Frank W. Hawks (1865\u20131950), who made his money making paper, and his wife, Helen (n\u00e9e Howard; 1872\u20131952), the daughter of a businessman with money. Hawks's family on his father's side were American pioneers and his old family member John Hawks had come from England to Massachusetts in 1630. The family lived in Goshen and by the 1890s was one of the richest families in the Midwest, because the Goshen Milling Company made a lot of money.\nThe dad of Hawks's mom, C. W. Howard (1845\u20131916), lived in Neenah, Wisconsin in 1862 at age 17. In 15 years he had made his money in the town's paper mill and other business moves. Frank Hawks and Helen Howard met in the early 1890s and married in 1895. Howard Hawks was the oldest of five kids and his birth was followed by Kenneth Neil Hawks (August 12, 1899 \u2013 January 2, 1930), William Bellinger Hawks (January 29, 1901 \u2013 January 10, 1969), Grace Louise Hawks (October 17, 1903 \u2013 December 23, 1927) and Helen Bernice Hawks (1906 \u2013 May 4, 1911). In 1898, the family moved to Neenah, Wisconsin where Frank Hawks started working for his father-in-law's Howard Paper Company.\nEducation.\nBetween 1906 and 1909, the Hawks family started to live in Pasadena, California because of the cold Wisconsin winters. This helped Helen Hawks's ill health. Little by little they started to live in Wisconsin only in the summers. They then moved to Pasadena for good in 1910. The family lived in a house down the street from Throop Polytechnic Institute (later known as the California Institute of Technology). The Hawks children started going to the school's Polytechnic Elementary School in 1907.\nHawks did okay in school. He did not do well in sports, but by 1910 he made up coaster racing, an early kind of soapbox racing. In 1911, Hawks's younger sister Helen died suddenly of food poisoning. From 1910 to 1912, Hawks went to Pasadena High School. But in 1912, the Hawks family moved to Glendora, California. Frank Hawks had orange trees there. Hawks ended his junior year of high school at Citrus Union High School in Glendora. When there he flew planes for performers.\nHe was then sent to Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire from 1913 to 1914. His family's money may have been a part his being let into the high-end private school. He was only seventeen, but he was let in as a student the same level of a sophomore. While in New England, Hawks went to the movie houses in Boston. In 1914, Hawks went back to Glendora and graduated from Pasadena High School that year.\nThat same year, Hawks was let into Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. He studied mechanical engineering and was a part of Delta Kappa Epsilon. School friend Ray S. Ashbury remembered Hawks spending more of his time playing craps and drinking alcohol than studying. Hawks also loved reading popular American and English books in school.\nWhile working in the movie industry in his 1916 summer vacation, Hawks made an attempt to change schools to Stanford University. He was not let in. He went to Cornell that September. He left in April 1917 to join the Army when the United States joined World War I. Like a lot of students who joined the armed services in the war, he got a degree in absentia in 1918. Before Hawks went to war, he went back to Hollywood and by the end of April 1917 was working on a Cecil B. DeMille movie.\nEarly film career.\nIn 1916, Hawks met Victor Fleming, a Hollywood filmmaker who had fixed cars and flown planes. Fleming started in the movie industry when a friend, Marshall Neilan, told movie director Allan Dwan that Fleming could fix his car. (Fleming left an impression on Dwan by quickly fixing his car and a broken camera.) By 1916, Fleming was a cinematographer.\nHawks met Fleming when he started racing and working on a Mercer race car\u2014bought for him by his grandfather, C.W. Howard\u2014during his 1916 summer vacation in California. They say he met Fleming when the two men raced on a dirt track and caused an accident. \nFleming gave Hawks's his first job in the movie industry, as a prop boy on the Douglas Fairbanks movie \"In Again, Out Again\" (on which Fleming worked as the cinematographer) for Famous Players-Lasky. Hawks said, a new place to be filmed needed to be made quickly when the studio's set designer could not be there, so Hawks offered to do the job. He did a good job. Fairbanks was happy. He then worked making things used in the movie and general helper on an unknown movie put together by Cecil B. DeMille. (Hawks never said what film in interviews and DeMille made five movies about in that time)."}

But one day, famine caused them to flee to Egypt, where they eventually became slaves. After all that happened, God talked to another spiritual leader in Judaism to help Abraham and his followers get back to Canaan, which he eventually did. The religion spread widely after that. The spread is called the Jewish Diaspora. The Jews spread to other countries and took their religion with them. \nThe Jews have to follow specific rules from their bible.

Under a single-payer system, most medical care would be paid for by the Government of the United States, ending the need for private health insurance and premiums, and probably recasting private insurance companies as providing purely supplemental coverage, to be used when non-essential care is sought.\nThe bill was first introduced in 2003, when it had 25 cosponsors, and has been reintroduced in each Congress since.

The first capital was the town of Karunguzhi, with an interruption between 1825 and 1835, administrative headquarters were transferred to Kanchipuram. In 1859 the region of Saidapet, now a neighbourhood in the city of Chennai, was made the administrative headquarters of the district.\nHistory.\nExcavations made by Robert Bruce Foote indicate that the region was inhabited in the Stone age. During the end of first millennium B. C, it was under the Thondaiman kings. The Pallavas with their capital at Kanchi came to power in about 500 A. D. When the Pallava kingdom began to decline, the region was conquered by the Western Gangas in about 760 A. D. Chingleput was ruled by the Rashtrakutas, Cholas and the Kakatiyas of Warangal until the 13th century AD when it fell to the Delhi Sultanate. Chingleput area was conquered by the Vijayanagar Empire which ruled the region from 1393 till 1565 and from 1565 till 1640 as the kingdom of Chandragiri.\nThe area was annexed by the Mughals in 1687 and was later conquered by the Nawab of the Carnatic. In 1763, Chingleput was ceded to the British East India Company by Mohammad Ali, the then Nawab of the Carnatic. It was the site of the Carnatic Wars and was frequently taken by Tipu Sultan during the last years of the 18th century.After the independence of India, the district became part in 1950 of the newly named Madras State. As a result of the 1956 States Reorganisation Act, the state's boundaries were re-organised following linguistic lines.\nPopulation.\nAs of 1901, Chingleput had a total population of 1,312,222. 96 percent of the population were Hindus while the rest where Christians and Muslims. About three-fourths of the people spoke Tamil as their mother tongue the remainder spoke Telugu. Due to its proximity to Madras city, there were also large numbers of Europeans in the district."}

J.\" Kennedy (January 14, 1858 \u2013 May 18, 1929) was an American businessman and politician. Kennedy was a major figure in the Democratic Party in Boston. He was the father of Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. (1888-1969) and the grandfather of President John F. Kennedy (1917-1963).\nThe son of Irish immigrants, he was the only surviving male in the family after two outbreaks of Cholera. He started work at fourteen as a stevedore in the docks. Kennedy owned three saloons and a whisky import house, and eventually had major interests in coal and banking. He moved successfully into politics, as a sociable man able to mix comfortably with both the Irish and the Protestant elite, and he sat in the Massachusetts House of Representatives and in the Massachusetts Senate. His particular talent was for the behind-the-scenes machinations for which Boston politics became so notorious.\nEarly life.\nP. J. was the youngest of five children born to Irish Catholic immigrants Patrick Kennedy (1823\u20131858) and Bridget Murphy (1821\u20131888), who were both from New Ross, County Wexford, and married in Boston on September 26, 1849. The couple's elder son, John, had died of cholera in infancy two years before P. J. was born. Ten months after P. J.'s birth, his father Patrick also succumbed to the infectious cholera epidemic that infested the family's East Boston neighborhood. As the only surviving male, P. J. was the first Kennedy to receive a formal education. His mother Bridget had purchased an East Boston stationery and notions store where she had worked. The business took off and expanded into a grocery and liquor store.\nAt the age of fourteen, P. J. left school to work with his mother and three older sisters, Mary, Joanna, and Margaret, as a stevedore on the Boston Docks. In the 1880s, with money he had saved from his modest earnings, he launched a business career by buying a saloon in Haymarket Square downtown. In time, he bought a second establishment by the East Boston docks. Next, to capitalize on the social drinking of upperclass Boston, Kennedy purchased a third bar in an upscale East Boston hotel, the Maverick House. Before he was thirty, his growing prosperity allowed him to buy a whiskey-importing business. By the time he died in 1929, Kennedy held an interest in a coal company and a substantial amount ofstock in a bank, the Columbia Trust Company. His wealth afforded his family of one son and two daughters an attractive home on Jeffries Point in East Boston.\nPolitical career.\nKennedy was \"always ready to help less fortunate fellow Irishmen with a little cash and some sensible advice.\" He enjoyed the approval and respect of most folks in East Boston, living on the hill of a mixed Boston neighborhood of upscale Irish and Protestant elite. Beginning in 1884, he converted his popularity into five consecutive one-year terms in the Massachusetts House of Representatives, followed by three two-year terms in the Massachusetts Senate. Establishing himself as one of Boston's principal Democratic leaders, he was invited to give one of the seconding speeches for Grover Cleveland at the party's 1888 national convention in St. Louis. However, he found campaigning, speech making, and legislative maneuvering, to be less appealing than the behind-the-scenes machinations that characterized so much of Boston politics in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. After leaving the Senate in 1895, Kennedy spent his political career as an appointed elections commissioner, an appointed fire commissioner, as the backroom boss of Boston's Ward Two, and as a member of his party's unofficial Board of Strategy.\nMarriage and children.\nOn November 23, 1887, he married Mary Augusta Hickey (1857-1923), daughter of James Hickey and Margaret Martha Field. P. J. and Mary had four children:\nDeath.\nP. J. Kennedy died on May 18, 1929 from natural causes at age 71."}

It was established in 1917 by T. M. Nair and P. Theagaraya Chetty as a result of a series of non-Brahmin conferences and meetings in the presidency. Communal division between Brahmins and non-Brahmins began in the presidency during the late-19th and early-20th century, mainly due to caste prejudices and disproportionate Brahminical representation in government jobs.\nElections Conducted and aftermath.\nIn 1920, it won the first direct elections in the presidency and formed the government. For the next seventeen years, it formed four out of the five ministries and was in power for thirteen years. It was the main political alternative to the nationalist Indian National Congress in Madras. After it lost to the Congress in the 1937 election, it never recovered. It came under the leadership of Periyar E. V. Ramaswamy and his Self-Respect Movement. In 1944, Periyar transformed the Justice Party into the social organisation Dravidar Kazhagam and withdrew it from electoral politics. A rebel faction that called itself the original Justice Party, survived to contest one final election, in 1952.\nIdeology.\nThe Justice Party was isolated in contemporary Indian politics by its many controversial activities. It opposed Brahmins in civil service and politics, and this anti-Brahmin attitude shaped many of its ideas and policies. It opposed Annie Besant and her Home rule movement, because it believed home rule would benefit the Brahmins. The party also campaigned against the non-cooperation movement in the presidency. It was at odds with M. K. Gandhi, primarily due to his praise for Brahminism. Its mistrust of the Brahmin\u2013dominated Congress led it to adopt a hostile stance toward the Indian independence movement. Although it professed to represent all non-Brahmins, the Justice Party eventually lost the support of Muslims and Untouchables, who accused it of serving the interests of only a few castes like Vellalars (Mudaliars, Pillais), Balija Naidus, Beri Chettis, Kapus and Kammas.\nThe Justice Party's power period is remembered for the introduction of caste-based reservations, and educational and religious reform. In opposition it is remembered for participating in the anti-Hindi agitations of 1937\u201340. The party was responsible for creating Andhra and Annamalai universities and for developing the area around present-day Theagaroya Nagar in Madras city."}

He was born during the Italian Renaissance period. His family was well off, and in the early 1470s Manutius was sent to Rome to be taught as a scholar of human society and culture. He studied Latin under Gaspare da Verona and was also taught by Domizio Calderini. In 1475\u20131478 he studied Greek in Ferrara, under Guarino da Verona.\nManutius became a citizen of the town Carpi in March 1480. In 1482 he went to live in Mirandola with his old friend and fellow student, Giovanni Pico, while staying away from the Venetian army. He lived there for two years, learning about Greek literature. Before Pico moved to Florence, he made Manutius the teacher to his sister's sons, Alberto and Leonello Pio, who were young royal sons of the town of Carpi. In Carpi, Manutius grew close with his student, Alberto Pio. At the end of the 1480s Manutius created two works addressed to his two students and their mother, Caterina Pico. Both works were printed by Baptista de Tortis in Venice \u2014 \"Musarum panagyris\" with its \"Epistola Catherinae Piae\", March/May 1487 \u2013 March 1491 and the \"Paraenesis\", 1490. This would serve as Manutius's start in publishing.\nAldine Press.\nIn 1494 Manutius made the Aldine Press in Venice. The Aldine Press printed its first material in February 1495. Pier Francesco Barbarigo owned half of the Aldine Press. Andrea Torresani owned the other half. Manutius shared part of what Torresani owned with him. Aldus Manutius wanted to save ancient Greek literature. He wanted to make it so that everybody could read what the Greeks had written a very long time ago. He did this by printing copies of things they had written. He wanted to make the letters he used in printing to look like the handwriting of Latin and Greek humanists. People in Venice usually wrote in curly connected letters. Printing presses only used square looking letters back then. By making letters that were all connected and curly, Manutius could make the things he printed more personal. Manutius paid Francesco Griffo of Bologna to make the new letters used in the printing press. The letters that Griffo made were used to print Cardinal Pietro Bembo's \"De Aetna\" in 1495. These letters were also the first model of italic type. The letters were used until 1501."}

Brannan sold the newspaper to a friend, and then it was called \"The Daily Alta California\".\nIn June 1847, Brannan went to Green River, Wyoming, to meet with Brigham Young, who was the head of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Young was leading a group of Mormons to the Great Basin area. Brannan wanted Young to bring the Mormons to California, but Young wanted to stay in Utah. Brannan wasn't happy about that, and went back to California. Brannan was the only church leader in California, so the Mormons paid him their tithes (a small part of their money). But there is no record of Brannan sending the money to his church leaders in Utah, so it's possible that he kept it for himself. Many members stopped paying him and moved to the Salt Lake valley, where most of the other Mormons were."}

Cenker", "text": "Robert Joseph \"Bob\" Cenker (born November 5, 1948) is an American engineer, and former astronaut. In January 1986, Cenker was a crew member on the seventh flight of Space Shuttle \"Columbia\". Cenker was a type of astronaut called a Payload Specialist.\nThis mission was the final flight before the Challenger explosion, which ended the Space Shuttle program until 1988. As a result, Cenker's mission was called \"The End of Innocence\" for the Shuttle.\nFollowing the end of his space mission, Cenker returned to work as an engineer, and also makes appearances for NASA.\nEarly life and education.\nCenker was born on November 5, 1948, and raised near Uniontown, Pennsylvania. He started his education at St. Fidelis College Seminary in Herman, Pennsylvania, leaving in 1962. He later attended Uniontown Joint Senior High School and graduated in 1966.\nCenker enrolled at Penn State University in 1970 where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in aerospace engineering. He continued his studies at Penn State and earned a Master of Science degree in 1973, also in aerospace engineering. Cenker earned a second Master of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from Rutgers University in 1977.\nPre-spaceflight career.\nCenker worked for 18 years at RCA Astro-Electronics and its successor company GE Astro Space. Cenker worked on hardware design and systems design concerning satellite attitude control. He also worked on in-orbit operations, as well as spacecraft assembly, test, and pre-launch operations. He spent two years on the Navy navigation satellite program, but spent most of his career working on commercial communications satellites.\nCenker's positions included integration and test manager for the Satcom D and E spacecraft, where he was responsible for all launch site activities. He also served as spacecraft bus manager on the Spacenet/GStar programs. He was responsible for ensuring the spacecraft bus could interface with multiple rockets, including the Delta, Space Shuttle, and Ariane launch vehicles.\nSpaceflight experience.\nAs an incentive for a spacecraft owner to contract with NASA to use a Shuttle launch instead of an unmanned, commercial launch system, NASA permitted contracting companies to apply for a Payload Specialist seat on the same mission. When RCA contracted with NASA to launch Satcom Ku-1, RCA Astro-Electronics' manager of systems engineering for the Satcom-K program Bob Cenker, and his co-worker Gerard Magilton, were selected to train as Payload Specialists.\nCenker and Magilton trained with career astronauts as well as other Payload and Mission Specialists, including those scheduled for the next scheduled flight, that of the \"Challenger\" mission, STS-51-L.\nThis flight of \"Columbia\" was originally scheduled to occur in August 1985, but the timeline slipped. In July 1985 the payload was finalized to include the RCA satellite, and Cenker was assigned to the mission, now designated as STS-61-C. Magilton was assigned as the back-up.Prior to its successful launch, \"Columbia\" had several aborted launch attempts, including one on January 6 which was \"one of the most hazardous in the shuttle\u2019s operational history\" to that point, as well as a near-catastrophic abort three days later. Referring to the January 9 abort, pilot Charlie Bolden later stated that it \u201c...would have been catastrophic, because the engine would have exploded had we launched.\u201d \n\"Columbia\" ultimately launched and achieved orbit on January 12, 1986, with a full crew of seven. Along with Cenker, the crew included Robert L. \"Hoot\" Gibson, future NASA Administrator Charles F. Bolden, George D. Nelson, Steven A. Hawley, Franklin R. Chang-Diaz, and US Representative Bill Nelson.\n Cenker and his crewmates traveled over 2.1 million miles in 96 orbits aboard Columbia and logged over 146 hours in space.\nDuring the six-day mission, January 12\u201318, Cenker performed a variety of physiological tests, operated a primary experiment \u2013 an infrared imaging camera \u2013 and assisted with the deployment of RCA Americom's Satcom Ku-1 satellite, the primary mission objective. Satcom K-1 was deployed nearly 10 hours into the mission, and Satcom later reached its geostationary \u201cslot\u201d at 85 degrees West longitude where it remained operational until April 1997, the last major commercial satellite deployed by the space shuttle program.\nIn a 2014 video of the \"Tell Me a Story\" series titled \"Close My Eyes &amp; Drift Away\", posted to the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex YouTube channel, Cenker tells a humorous story regarding a zero-g sleeping problem that he faced on his mission.\nThe next Shuttle launch, ten days after the return of \"Columbia,\" resulted in the destruction of \"Challenger\" with the loss of all aboard, including Cenker's counterpart from Hughes Aircraft, civilian crew member and Payload Specialist Greg Jarvis. Accordingly, commander Gibson later called the STS-61-C mission \"The End of Innocence\" for the Shuttle Program.\nFollowing the Challenger disaster, the shuttle fleet was grounded until 1988. Even after Shuttle missions resumed, civilian Payload Specialists like Cenker were excluded until the Payload Specialist program was reinstated on December 2, 1990 when Samuel T. Durrance, an Applied Physics Laboratory astrophysicist and Ronald A. Parise, a Computer Sciences Corporation astronomer, flew aboard STS-35. By that time, RCA had been purchased by General Electric, and RCA Astro-Electronics became part of GE. Following two additional ownership transitions, the facility was closed in 1998. As a result, Cenker was the only RCA Astro-Electronics employee, and only employee in the history of the facility under all of its subsequent names, to ever fly in space.\nNASA's Payload Specialist program has been criticized for giving limited Shuttle flight positions to civilian aerospace engineers such as Cenker and Greg Jarvis (killed aboard \"Challenger\"), politicians such as Bill Nelson, and others civilians such as Teacher in Space Christa McAuliffe (also killed aboard \"Challenger\"). Even the flight of former Mercury astronaut and US Senator John Glenn was questioned. The concern was that these people had replaced career astronauts in very limited flight opportunities, and some may have flown without fully understanding the level of danger involved in a Shuttle mission.\nPost-spaceflight.\nFollowing the completion of his shuttle mission, Cenker returned to work in the civilian aerospace field. Cenker's last two years with RCA Astro-Electronics and it's successor GE Astro Space were spent as Manager of Payload Accommodations on an EOS spacecraft program. After leaving GE, Cenker served as a consultant for various aerospace companies regarding micro-gravity research, and spacecraft design, assembly and flight operations. Cenker supported systems engineering and systems architecture studies for various spacecraft projects, including smallsats, military communications satellites, and large, assembled-in-orbit platforms. His contributions included launch vehicle evaluation and systems engineering support for Motorola on Iridium, and launch readiness for the Globalstar constellation. Other efforts include systems engineering and operations support for INTELSAT on Intelsat K and Intelsat VIII, for AT&amp;T on Telstar 401 and 402, for Fairchild-Matra on SPAS III, for Martin Marietta on Astra 1B, BS-3N, ACTS, and for the Lockheed Martin Series 7000 communications satellites.\nCenker continues to make periodic public appearances representing NASA and the shuttle astronaut program, including one at the Kennedy Space Center in March 2017.\nIn 2017, Cenker's STS-61C crewmate former US Senator Bill Nelson spoke at a session of the US House of Representatives. In an address, titled \"Mission to Mars and Space Shuttle Flight 30th Anniversary\", he read into the Congressional Record the details of the mission of STS-61C, as well as the names and function of each crew member including Cenker.\nPersonal life.\nBob Cenker is married to Barbara Ann Cenker; they have two sons and a daughter."}

In 1909, Baden-Powell held a big event for Boy Scouts. Many girls said they wanted to join, too. Baden-Powell wanted to have boys and girls in different groups, so he started Girl Guides that year. In 1910, his younger sister Agnes became the leader. The girls learned how to camp, and they also learned how to take care of children. By 1912, there were Girl Guides in many other countries such as Australia, Denmark, and the United States. All Girl Guides learn a lot about life and things that are not taught at school. They have special rules about the way to live. They have to try and do something nice for someone else every day. When something bad happens, they must be strong. They must be ready for anything, so their slogan is \"Be Prepared.\" In 1926, leaders of the Girl Guides from around the world met in a town in New York. At the meeting, they decided to make a special day for Girl Guides in all countries. They chose February 22 because it was the birthday of Robert Baden-Powell. It is called World Thinking Day. Now, on this day every year, Girl Guides around the world celebrate with special events and study about other countries and cultures."}

Founded in 2008, the team played its home matches at the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai. On 14 July 2015, the Supreme Court appointed RM Lodha committee suspended the Super Kings from the IPL for a period of two years for the alleged involvement of their owners in the 2013 Indian Premier League betting case.Prior to the suspension, the team was captained by Mahendra Singh Dhoni and coached by Stephen Fleming.It has most fans in instagram around 8.5 million follwers.\nThe Super Kings had won the title Four in succession (2010, 2011and 2018,2021).In 2010, they won the Champions League Twenty20 for the first time and repeated the feat in 2014. The leading run-scorer of the team is Suresh Raina, while the leading wicket-taker is Ravichandran Ashwin.CSK has most records of appearance in playoffs (11) and finals(9) The team has one of the strongest fan base in india. They are current defending champions\nFranchise History.\nIn September 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) announced the establishment of the Indian Premier League, a Twenty20 competition to be started in 2008.In January 2008, the BCCI unveiled the owners of eight city-based franchises. The Chennai franchise was sold to the India Cements for $91 million, making it the fourth most expensive team in the league behind Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad.India Cements acquired the rights to the franchise for 10 years.\nTeam history.\n2008\u20132009: First seasons.\nDuring the first player auctions for the inaugural IPL season conducted in January 2008, the Chennai franchise bought a number of contemporary star cricketers such as Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Matthew Hayden, Stephen Fleming, Muttiah Muralitharan and Michael Hussey. Dhoni became the costliest player of the auction, as the Chennai franchise bought him for $1.5 million.The franchise named Dhoni as the captain of the team and appointed Kepler Wessels as the head coach.They played their first game on 19 April 2008 against Kings XI Punjab at Mohali. The Super Kings won the game by 33 runs after posting 240/5 in 20 overs, which was the highest total of the tournament, a record surpassed by themselves in 2010.The Super Kings ended the league stage with eight wins from 14 games and finished third on the points table.They beat the Kings XI Punjab by 9 wickets in the semifinal.The Super Kings faced the Rajasthan Royals in the final of the IPL at Mumbai. Batting first, the Super Kings scored 163/5 in 20 overs and lost the game by 3 wickets off the final delivery of the match.\nIn 2009 season, The Super Kings finished with 17 points from 14 matches and earned a second place at the league table.However, at the semi-finals, their hopes of entering the final for a second time were crushed by the Royal Challengers who beat them by 6 wickets.The Super Kings opener Matthew Hayden, who scored 572 runs in 12 innings with 5 half-centuries at an average of 52 and strike-rate of 145, won the Orange Cap for the leading run-scorer of the season and was also adjudged Player of the Tournament.\n2010: IPL and CLT20 double wins.\nIn 2010, the Super Kings struggled in the first half of the regular season, winning only two matches out of seven. They won four of their next five games in the season mainly due to the efforts of Murali Vijay and Suresh Raina. After a defeat at home to the Delhi Daredevils, the Super Kings were left with a must-win match against Kings XI Punjab at Dharamsala. The Super Kings won the match by six wickets as they chased down the target of 193 with two balls to spare with skipper Dhoni scoring an unbeaten 54 from 29 balls.Chennai got the third place as they had the better net run rate of the four teams which finished on 14 points.In the semifinal, the Super Kings scored a modest 142/7 in 20 overs against the defending champions Deccan Chargers. But an inspired bowling spell from Doug Bollinger (4/13 in four overs) did the most damage as the Chargers were bowled out for 104. This gave the Super Kings a 38-run victory that took them to the final. The Super Kings faced the tournament favorites Mumbai Indians at their home ground in the final.Suresh Raina's 57 (35) helped the Super Kings recover from 68/3 after 12 overs to put up 168/5 at the end of their 20 overs. Then, their spin duo of Ravichandran Ashwin and Muralitharan conceded only 41 runs in the 8 overs bowled between them to help the Super Kings won the game by 22 runs and secure their first ever IPL title.With this, the Super Kings also qualified for the 2010 Champions League Twenty20 that was held in South Africa.\nAt the Champions League, the Super Kings were placed in Group A along with champions of Twenty20 competitions from Australia, South Africa, New Zealand and Sri Lanka. The Super Kings topped the Group table with three wins and a Super Over defeat to the Victorian Bushrangers.In the semi-final at Durban, the Super Kings comprehensively defeated IPL rivals Royal Challengers Bangalore by 52 runs. Raina won the Man of the match for his unbeaten 94 off 48 balls.The Super Kings played their first CLT20 final at Johannesburg where they beat the Chevrolet Warriors by 8 wickets, becoming the first IPL team to win the CLT20. Murali Vijay won not only the Man of the Match in the final for his 58 but also the Golden Bat for scoring the most runs in the tournament and Ashwin, who was the leading wicket-taker, was adjudged the Player of the Series. At the end of the season, Matthew Hayden decided to retire from the IPL.\n2011-2015 seasons.\nIn 2011, as two new teams were added to the IPL, the IPL Governing Council declared that each franchise could retain a maximum of four players of their squad, only three of whom can be Indian players, and the rest of the international players would be put in the mega-auction. The Chennai franchise, keen to have the same set of core players, retained captain MS Dhoni, vice-captain Suresh Raina, Murali Vijay and all-rounder Albie Morkel for a total of $4.5 million. At the auction, they bought back some of their star players of previous seasons such as Hussey, Ashwin, Bollinger and Subramaniam Badrinath. In the 2011 IPL, they lost three of their first five games which placed them at the bottom of the ten-team points table.But then, they went on to win seven of their next eight games to finish second and register a spot in the knockout stages. They faced the top-ranked team Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Qualifying final which they won by 6 wickets thanks to an unbeaten 73 from Suresh Raina.\nIn the final, they faced the same opponents again, which was held at their home ground Chepauk. Vijay and Hussey put on a 133-run first-wicket partnership that helped the Super Kings to post a total of 205/5. Their bowlers, then, restricted Bangalore to only 147 to take the Super Kings to second consecutive title in the IPL. Vijay was awarded Man of the Match for his match-winning innings of 95.CSK also won all their home games that season becoming the first team in IPL to achieve the feat. However at the Champions League later that year, they won only one out of their four group matches and finished at the bottom.\nIn 2012, the franchise signed up Indian all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja for $2 million at the players' auction.They got off to a rather slow start in the regular season, winning only five of their first 12 games which put them in doubt of qualifying for the Playoffs. Then they won three of their last four matches and qualified for the Playoffs with a better net run rate than the Royal Challengers who also finished with the same number of points.In the Eliminator, they beat the Mumbai Indians by 38 runs before comprehensively beating the table-toppers Delhi Daredevils in the Qualifying final by 86 runs. Murali Vijay, who struck his second IPL hundred (113 off 58 balls), won the Man of the Match.At the final, the Super Kings were defeated by 5 wickets by the Kolkata Knight Riders who chased down the target of 191 with two balls to spare, thus denying the Super Kings a hat-trick of titles in the IPL. At the Champions League, once again they could not progress past the group stage with two wins and two defeats.\nIn 2013, the Super Kings strengthened their bowling attack by signing up five overseas and five Indian bowlers. In the IPL season, they finished first in the points table with 11 wins from 16 matches and qualified for the Playoffs and 2013 CLT20. This was the first time in six seasons that the Super Kings had topped the league table of the IPL. During the season, they also equaled Royal Challengers Bangalore's 2011 record for most wins in succession in the IPL (7 wins on trot). In the first Qualifier at Delhi against Mumbai Indians, the Super Kings posted 192/1 in 20 overs riding on unbeaten half-centuries from Hussey (86* off 58 balls) and Raina (82* off 42 balls) before bowling out their opponents for 144. Thus they entered the final of the IPL for the fourth time in succession where they would play the same opponents, Mumbai Indians, at Kolkata. At the final, batting first, the Mumbai Indians made 148/9 in their 20 overs. In reply, the Super Kings were reduced to 39/6 at one stage before an unbeaten half-century from skipper Dhoni took them close to the target. However, Mumbai Indians won the match by 23 runs to win their first ever IPL title. Super Kings opening batsman Michael Hussey, who scored 733 runs that season at an average of 52, won the Orange Cap for the most runs in the season while all-rounder Dwayne Bravo won the Purple Cap for bagging the most wickets (32). The Super Kings gained direct qualification for the 2013 CLT20 which was held in India in September\u2013October. They were placed in Group B alongside Brisbane Heat, Sunrisers Hyderabad, Titans and Trinidad &amp; Tobago. They won their first three games before losing the final group match against Trinidad &amp; Tobago. With 12 points from four matches, the Super Kings progressed to the semifinals where they suffered a 14-run defeat at the hands of the Rajasthan Royals at Jaipur.\nIn 2014,The Super Kings started the season with a defeat in the opening match, after which they went on to win eight of their next nine matches to take the first spot in the points table. However, they suffered a loss of form towards the end of the regular season which resulted in three consecutive defeats. They won their last league fixture and finished third in the points table and qualified for the Eliminator against the fourth-placed Mumbai Indians. They won the Eliminator at Mumbai by 7 wickets and qualified for the Qualifier. At the Qualifier against Kings XI Punjab, the Super Kings won the toss and elected to field. Punjab went on to score 226/6 in their 20 overs. The Super Kings, in reply, could manage only 202/7 despite a 25-ball 87 from Raina. They crashed out of the IPL, but, on account of finishing third, qualified for the main event of the 2014 CLT20. In the group stage of the CLT20, the Super Kings won two matches, lost one while another match was a no result. Thus with 10 points they finished second in the group table and qualified for the semifinal where they met the unbeaten team of the other group, Kings XI Punjab. After being put in to bat, the Super Kings posted 182/7 in 20 overs thanks to Bravo who scored a 39-ball 67. Then their bowlers reduced Punjab to 34/6 in the eighth over, and Punjab were eventually bowled out for 117. At the final in Bangalore, the Super Kings faced the IPL champions Kolkata Knight Riders who set them a target of 181 in 20 overs. Raina guided the run-chase with an unbeaten 109 off 62 balls, helping the team to an eight-wicket win and their second CLT20 title. Super Kings spinner Pawan Negi who took 5/22 during Kolkata's innings won the Man of the Match, and Raina, who finished as the highest run-getter of the tournament, was awarded Man of the Tournament.\nIn 2015, before the players' auction, Chennai Super Kings gave away Ben Hilfenhaus, John Hastings, Vijay Shankar and David Hussey. At the auction they bought back Michael Hussey for a price of Rs.1.5 crores. They also bought Kyle Abbott, Irfan Pathan, Andrew Tye, Eklavya Dwivedi, Ankush Bains, Pratyush Singh and Rahul Sharma. In the final, they lost against Mumbai.\nControversies.\nIn May 2013, Gurunath Meiyappan, son-in-law of Srinivasan, was arrested by Mumbai Police on charges of placing bets on IPL matches Meiyappan, who was the Team Principal of the Super Kings, was issued a summons by the Mumbai Police and on interrogation it was found that Meiyappan was in contact with bookies through actor Vindu Dara Singh. Following this, Srinivasan, on 2 June 2013, decided to step aside as BCCI President temporarily until the inquiry into the betting case completed. In February 2014, the three member panel appointed by the Supreme Court of India enquired into the betting case indicted Meiyappan for illegal betting during the 2013 IPL.\nOn 25 March 2014, the Supreme Court of India issued an ultimatum to the BCCI demanding that Srinivasan either step down as President or be removed from his position. On 14 July 2015, the Supreme Court appointed RM Lodha committee suspended the owners of Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings from the Indian Premier League for a period of two years. On 24 February 2016, the Supreme Court of India agreed to hear a plea for lifting the ban on the Chennai Super Kings.\nAwards and Achievements.\n2008 Indian Premier League\n2009 Indian Premier League\n2010 Indian Premier League\n2010 Champions League\n2011 Indian Premier League\n2012 Indian Premier League\n2013 Indian Premier League\n2014 Indian Premier League\n2014 Champions League\n2015 Indian Premier league"}

Fluid pressure can be caused by gravity, acceleration, or forces in a closed container. Since a fluid has no definite shape, its pressure applies in all directions. Fluid pressure can also be amplified through hydraulic mechanisms and changes with the velocity of the fluid.\nIn a fluid column, as the depth increases, the\u00a0pressure increases as well. Pressure (P) increases because as you go deeper, fluid at a lower depth has to support fluid above it as well.\u00a0Therefore to define fluid pressure, we can say that it is the pressure at a point within a fluid arising due to the weight of the fluid.\nPressure in liquids is equally divided in all directions, therefore if a force is applied to one point of the liquid, it will be transmitted to all other points within the liquid.\nThe pressure in fluids can be calculated using the following relation:\nP = \"h\u03c1g (Pressure = Height/Depth of the liquid X Density of the liquid X Gravitational pull (9.81m/s))\".\nPressure is a scalar quantity. The SI Unit (International System of Unit) of pressure is the Pascal, or Newton per meter squared (N/m^2). \nPoints along the same depth will have the same pressure, while points at different depths will have different pressure. \nAn object that is partly, or completely submerged in a fluid experiences a greater pressure on its bottom surface than on its top surface. This causes a resultant force upwards. This force is called upthrust, and is also known as buoyancy\nFor moving containers, the pressure changes,(Acceleration is the acceleration of the container)-.\nFor a vertical acceleration in the upward direction, the pressure in fluids= P = \u03c1h (g+a)\nFor a vertical acceleration in the downward, the pressure in fluids= P = \u03c1h (g-a)\nFor a horizontal acceleration, the pressure in fluids= tan \u03b8\nFor any random angle of acceleration, the pressure in fluids= \u03c1h (g + a sin\u03b8)"}

She also wants to make changes in the political and social system of Saudi Arabia to promote better health.\nEducation.\nAltwaijri studied Community Health at King Saud University in Riyadh, receiving her B.Sc. in 1992. After marrying, she and her husband moved to the United States to attend graduate school. Altwaijri studied with Johanna Dwyer, director of the Frances Stern Nutrition Center at Tufts University's Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy. She received her M.Sc. from Tufts University in 1996 and her Ph.D in 2002. Her parents strongly encouraged her to have a professional career that would enable her to be financially independent.\nCareer.\nAltwaijri moved from Boston to Saudi Arabia in 2002. She joined King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences and started to work for King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre in Riyadh where she leads the epidemiology research center. She is considered one of the top senior scientists in the country.\nAltwaijri is concerned with epidemiological studies of the Saudi population, with particular attention to women, children and adolescents. \nOne area she is working on is to develop pubertal growth standards for Saudi children. The only standards available to Saudi pediatricians have been based on pubertal characteristics of children in the United States. The problem is that Saudi children are different from American ones. Altwaijri is developing studies of Saudi children that will be sensitive to factors in Saudi life such as socioeconomic standards, diet, and geography. \nShe also researches risk factors such as obesity, smoking, hypertension, high blood cholesterol and lack of exercise, which affect chronic diseases. She emphasizes the importance of social determinants of health and strongly advocates for social and political changes that would promote more healthy lifestyles. She is particularly concerned about women, who are at a higher risk of developing obesity than Saudi men, in part because socio-cultural factors restrict opportunities for women to exercise and discourage women's participation in sports. Altwaijri advocates for the inclusion of a physical curriculum for girls as well as boys in schools; creation of safe neighborhood play spaces for both male and female children; safe areas where adult men and women can be physically active; and affordable health clubs for both women and men. She also supports regulation of food prices to promote the choice of healthy over unhealthy foods. To keep her children active, she enrolled them in competitive team swimming, where they became eligible to attend the AAU Junior Olympic Games.\nAltwaijri is a Principal Investigator for the Saudi National Mental Health Survey, a broad-based investigation assessing the impact of mental illness in Saudi communities. No research into this area had been done previously in Saudi Arabia, even though the \nWorld Health Organization (WHO) reports that five of the ten most burdensome diseases in the world involve mental health. In addition to Saudi government and educational institutions, this research involves international collaboration with Harvard University, the University of Michigan, and the World Health Organization. The study, which was initiated in 2009, had the goal of visiting the homes of 5,000 men and women to interview people from across the country. 86% of interviewees were willing to participate.\nWomen in science.\nAltwaijri chairs the Saudi Women in Science Committee, a national network of female scientists from Saudi Arabia. She encourages Saudi women to enter scientific and technological fields, arguing that women scientists can use electronic forms of communication to collaborate and do significant work without \"cross[ing] the boundaries of our societal norms and customs.\" She indicates that restrictions such as the ban on women drivers make it difficult for women to go to work or to visit a fitness center. \nAltwaijri is one of thirty-five women featured in the book \"Arab Women Rising\", which includes women from Tunisia to Saudi Arabia. She was included in the BBC's 2014 list featuring 100 Women internationally."}

His boxing schema proved to be too much for Deji to handle, and Jake stopped Deji in the sixth round. Many boxing experts and pundits such as Tony Bellew, Matthew Macklin, Tim Storer, Carl Froch, and more credited Jake, as he performed excellent for a novice boxer. His boxing record currently stands at 1-0-0.\nEarly life.\nPaul was born in Cleveland, and grew up in Westlake, Ohio. He is the son of Pamela Ann Stepnick (\"n\u00e9e\" Meredith) and realtor Gregory Allan Paul. His older brother, YouTuber Logan Paul, claims that Jake is of Austrian-Jewish, English, German-Jewish, Hungarian-Jewish, Irish, Scottish, and Welsh ancestry.\nCareer.\nPaul began his career in September 2013 posting videos on Vine. By the time Vine shut down, Jake Paul had 5.3 million followers and 2 billion plays on the app.\nIn 2015, it was announced that Paul would be starring as Dirk in Disney Channel's new comedy series \"Bizaardvark\".\nOn January 5, 2017, Paul was among the invited guests at an event at the White House centering on social media. As a stunt for his YouTube vlog channel, he hid in a bathroom there before sneaking out of the White House at 3:30am without being confronted by security.\nOn January 17, 2017, it was reported Paul had launched Team 10 with $1 million in financing to create influencer marketing management and creative agency around teen entertainment.

On behalf of the production company, the cast and crew, we thank Jake for his good work on the TV series for the past 18 months and extend our best wishes to him.\" The announcement followed a KTLA 5 news report about public complaints from Paul's neighbors regarding the noise generated by Paul's pranks, parties, fire hazards and the large crowds of Paul's fans congregating in their neighborhood. Paul later confirmed the news on his Twitter page, saying he would now focus more on his personal brand, his YouTube channel, his business ventures, and more adult acting roles. Paul later revealed in an interview with \"The Hollywood Reporter\" that he was actually fired from \"Bizaardvark\" by Disney who wanted to expedite the process of weaning him off the show due to the KTLA segment.\nExplicit YouTube video.\nOn January 3, 2018, Paul uploaded a video to his YouTube channel titled \"I lost my virginity\" which caused controversy for being too sexually explicit and inappropriate for his younger audience.

The thumbnail was later changed with both Paul and Costell fully clothed and not touching each other.

He was also a leader in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and a businessman.\nAs a senator he is known for the 1930 Smoot\u2013Hawley Tariff Act.\nSmoot was an important leader of the LDS Church. He was chosen to serve as an apostle in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in 1900. Smoot's role in the LDS Church led to a controversy in the United States Senate. There were also rumors of polygamy and a secret oath against the United States A Senate committee questioned Smoot's authority in the Reed Smoot hearings. The committee suggested Smoot's removal, but the full Senate voted to keep Smoot. He lost the vote for office in 1932. Smoot returned to Utah in 1933. Smoot stopped working in politics and business and spent his time working in the church. At the time of his death, he was third in line to lead the LDS Church.\nEarly life, family, and religious activity.\nSmoot was born in 1862 in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory. He was the son of a Mormon pioneer from Kentucky and Iowa, Abraham O. Smoot, who was a mayor of the city from 1856 to 1862. His mother was Anne Kristina Morrison Smoot, also known as Anne Kirstine Mauritzen before her marriage. Anne Kristina Morrison Smoot was Smoot's father's fifth wife of six plural marriages and 27 children, three of whom Abraham O. Smoot adopted. The family moved to Provo, Utah, when his father was called by Brigham Young to head the stake there. Smoot went to school at the University of Utah (then a religious school) and graduated from Brigham Young Academy (now Brigham Young University) in Provo in 1879. After school, Smoot worked as a Mormon missionary in England. After returning to Utah, Smoot married Alpha M. Eldredge of Salt Lake City on September 17, 1884. They had six children together. Thereafter, Smoot became a successful businessman in the Salt Lake City area. In 1895, he became very involved in the government of the LDS Church and achieved more authority. On April 8, 1900, Smoot was chosen as an LDS Church apostle and member of the church's Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.\nUnited States Senate.\nAfter becoming an apostle in 1900, Smoot got permission from the LDS Church president Joseph F. Smith to run for office in 1902. He had joined the Republican Party. \nSmoot was voted by the Utah legislature to the United States Senate on January 20, 1903, as a Republican Senator representing the state. Smoot was introduced to the United States Senate by Utah's senior U.S. Senator, Republican Thomas Kearns, a Catholic who was elected in 1901. Kearns, an important mining leader, newspaper owner, banker, and railroad owner, had competed with Smoot for election to the Senate in 1900. Kearns was elected. Two years later Smoot ran again and won.\nPolitical career.\nSmoot was elected again in 1908 and continued to be elected over and over again until 1932. He worked in the Senate until March 1933. A Constitutional amendment required the popular election of US Senators after 1913. Smoot lost 1932 election, the year in which Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt won the presidency.\nIn 1916, William Kent was the lead supporter in the House of Representatives of a law to establish the National Park Service. Smoot sponsored the law in the Senate. The law passed the House of Representatives on July 1, 1916. The law passed the Senate on August 5. The law was signed by U.S. President Woodrow Wilson on August 25, 1916. The National Park Service was placed within the cabinet Department of Interior.\nSmoot was Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee from 1923 to 1933, and worked on the Senate Appropriations Committee. He worked on the national Republican Party and served as a delegate to the Republican National Convention every four years between 1908 and 1924. He was Chairman of the 1928 Resolutions Committee at the 1928 Republican National Convention and Chairman of the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee.\nSmoot was a co-sponsor of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in 1930. This act raised U.S. import tariffs on over 20,000 items to higher than they had ever been. Many historians believe that it made the Great Depression worse. U.S. President Herbert Hoover signed the act and it became a law on June 17, 1930."}

Missionaries will tell stories as a part of initiation, or to try and tell others to do the right thing. People will tell stories about early people in the Church, people in the scriptures, and help from God. These stories are supposed to help people's belief. In the early days of the Church, songs would say both good things and bad things about leaders such as Brigham Young.\nCommon practices for Mormons include sharing testimonies during fast and testimony meeting. Members testify of the things they know to be true and occasionally share personal stories how they gained their testimony. In Mormon culture, marriage and family are very important. Pioneer Day is a state holiday in Utah, where members honor the early pioneer saints.\nEarly settlers in the Church were influenced by many cultures that came together in Utah. Handicrafts were part of this influence. They had many different projects, and the Relief Society said they were good for the mind. Lots of these can still be seen around Utah.\nMormon fundamentalists have different folklore than Latter-day saints do. Their experience in government raids makes them feel more together, and they like folk dancing.\nResearch into Mormon folklore.\nAustin E. and Alta S.

Although people had looked at the issue a little before, the Fifes made the field better, through the Fife Folklore Archive, now at the library at Utah State University. Their book on Mormon folklore, called \"Saints of Sage and Saddle\", came out in 1956. This book, says someone who studies folklore named Jill Terry Rudy, \"remains the most complete book-length treatment of Mormon folklore\" - which means that it is the best book on Mormon folklore that there is.\nReferences.\nMissionary lore.\nMissionaries have their own set of folklore. Missionaries tell stories or sing church hymns, to connect with people they meet, to build friendship with those they teach, to inspire each other in missionary efforts, and to strengthen their own faith. In many missions around the world missionaries use church art, music and missionary stories as finding tools in proselytizing. Most young people in the church plays at least one musical instrument, the most common one is the piano.\nPioneer lore.\nMormons often retell stories about early church members who went through extremely difficult challenges, and made many sacrifices in order to build God\u2019s church. The purpose of those stories is to educate people about the historical events that took place at the beginning of the church history and the historical figures who were part of it. So, those who are currently members of the church can better understand the LDS heritage and the changes that occurred over the past years. Thus, they develop a deeper appreciation and gratitude for the early pioneers\u2019 efforts to establish God's church and the legacy they left behind."}

BYU magazine put her in a list of the 10 best BYU professors of the 20th century. She was the second woman in Utah to be a full professor.\nChildhood and education.\nAlice was born in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory, United States. Her father was George Reynolds and her mother was Mary Ann Tuddenham. Her father was a general authority of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), and worked as secretary to the First Presidency of the church for many years. When Alice was six years old, her father went to jail because he had more than one wife (plural marriage).\nHer father's sister, her aunt Julia Reynolds, helped raise Alice. Alice liked reading and being around grownups. When she was 12, her mother died while giving birth to one of her siblings. Alice's father sent her and her younger sister Florence to the Brigham Young Academy (BYA) for their high school education. Alice was inspired by one of her teachers, Academy Principal Karl G. Maeser. She graduated from BYA in 1890.\nAlice had taught for two years when the president of BYA, Benjamin Cluff, asked her to start a literature department at BYA. Reynolds went to the University of Michigan to study literature from 1892 to 1894. When she came back she became a full-time teacher at BYA.\nLater in her life Reynolds received more education in Chicago, Cornell, Berkeley and Columbia. She also traveled to Europe four different times.\nCareer.\nTeaching.\nReynolds was a Professor of English for 44 years. She became the first female to be a full professor at BYU. She taught approximately 5,000 students in 20 different English courses. Reynolds's absent-mindedness was famous at BYU. According to her students, she once walked through a herd of cows while reading a book and brought a teakettle to work instead of her purse.\nReynolds was an editor for the \"Relief Society Magazine\" from 1923 to 1930 and a writer for other LDS magazines. She also served in the General Board of the Relief Society of LDS Church for seven years.\nContributions to library.\nWhile working at BYA, Reynolds became the chairperson of the committee to establish the library. She was the chairperson of the committee for 19 years. She held a large fundraiser to obtain 1,200 books to add to the school's library. Over the course of her life, she organized several other campaigns to help the library grow to 100,000 volumes. Through the efforts of the club, over 10,000 volumes were donated to the BYU library."}

Bush ballads usually have a simple rhyme structure. They can be funny or sad. The words used are colourful, colloquial and Australian. They tell stories of action and adventure about bushranging, droving, droughts, floods, life on the frontier, and relations between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.\nThe first ballads were created by British and Irish settlers and convicts who brought with them the folk music of their homelands. They were usually not written down, but passed around verbally. The ballads grew into a unique style over the years, becoming very popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Australians thought they were \"an authentic expression of the national spirit\". Through bush poetry, newspapers and magazines, like \"The Bulletin\", promoted mateship, egalitarianism, anti-authoritarianism and a concern for the \"battler\" as being ideal Australian values.\nBush ballads are not as popular in modern times, but the poems written up to Federation are still some of the best-known and loved poems in Australia. The \"bush bards\" such as Henry Lawson and Banjo Paterson are regarded as giants of Australian literature. Clubs and festivals devoted to bush poetry can be found throughout the country, and the tradition lives on in Australian country music.\nCharacteristics.\nThe songs tell personal stories of life in Australia. The stories can include mining, raising and droving cattle, sheep shearing, wanderings, war stories, the 1891 Australian shearers' strike, conflict between the working poor and the rich farmers (squatters), bushrangers such as Ned Kelly, as well as love, and more modern themes such as trucking.\nAlthough not technically bush ballads, there are also numerous sea shanties. These were sung by whalers and sailors, as well as songs about the voyage made by convicts and other immigrants from England to Australia.\nModern musical styles for the ballads are different, even though the content is similar. Good examples of the older, traditional ballad style include Slim Dusty's When the Rain Tumbles Down in July or Leave Him in the Long yard. These have strong story lines in the verses, with choruses set to a Pick n' Strum beat. Modern bush ballads may use finger picking and strumming rock styles.\nHistory.\nAustralia's musical traditions include the English, Scottish, and Irish folk songs of the convicts, as well as the work of pastoral poets of the 1880s.\nThere was also a hymn singing tradition brought by missionaries in the 19th century. The beginnings of Australia's bush music come from the songs sung by the convicts who were sent to Australia from 1788. They tell of the harsh life of the time, and of people and events including bushrangers, swagmen, drovers, stockmen and shearers. Convict and bushranger verses often complained about the governments misuse of power. Examples include ballads like: The Wild Colonial Boy, Click Go The Shears, The Eumeralla Shore, The Drover's Dream, The Queensland Drover, The Dying Stockman and Moreton Bay.\nLater bush ballads told stories of war, droughts, floods, Aboriginality, railways and roads. Isolation and loneliness of life in the Australian bush has been another theme. They often tell of the difficulties and struggles for the working poor people. The bush ballads are often ironic and humorous, for example \"Beautiful Land of Australia.\" They were an oral and folkloric tradition, and only later published in print, such as Banjo Paterson's \"Old Bush Songs\", in the 1890s.\nThe lyrics for \"Waltzing Matilda\", often regarded as Australia's unofficial national anthem, were written by Banjo Paterson in 1895. This type of Australian country music, with lyrics focusing on strictly Australian subjects, is generally known as \"bush music\" or \"bush band music\".\nThe ballads continued in Australia long after popular music took hold in Great Britain. The ballad style in rural England began dying out when land clearances, industrialisation and urbanization saw people moving from the farms into the cities. English popular music began in the working-class music halls during the 1830s and 1840s. Australia, which still had a large rural population, popular music was started a lot later.\nAs early as the 1920s, the different ethnic groups in Asutralia influenced the ballads. Poncie Cubillo introduced the rondalla with their Filipino string band in Darwin. The ballad tradition has grown to include some of these influences including Chinese and Filipino. There were also the Italians growing tobacco, the de Bortoli family, in \"Texas in Queensland\", adding to the mix of folk tunes and Tex Morton's hillbilly tunes. Morton, a country music singer from New Zealand, made a number of Australian-themed recordings between 1936 and 1943. These included the \"Dying Duffer's Prayer,\" \"Murrumbridgee Jack,\" \"Billy Brink The Shearer,\" \"Stockman's Last Bed,\" \"Wrap Me Up in My Stockwhip and Blanket,\" \"Rocky Ned (The Outlaw),\" and \"Ned Kelly Song\". While these are a part of the bush ballad tradition, Morton sang without an Australian accent and used yodeling like the American singer Jimmie Rodgers. American cowboy and country songs and 1950s rock 'n' roll influenced Australian bush ballads. With increased modern communications, bush ballads share the modern Australian music scene with rockabilly, country music, blues, Texas swing, bluegrass, trail songs, and country pop.\nCountry and folk musicians including Slim Dusty, Stan Coster, Rolf Harris, The Bushwackers, John Williamson, Graeme Connors and John Schumann of the band Redgum, still record the old bush ballads. Contemporary artists including Sara Storer and Lee Kernaghan draw heavily on this heritage. Ashley Cook, a contemporary balladeer, sings about topics relevant to life in agriculture and mining work in Australia's outback: \"Cattle, Dust and Leather\" and \"Blue Queensland Dogs\". His song \"Road to Kakadu\" is about killing water buffalo in Northern Territory in the 1990s to control the Brucellosis disease. \"Beneath the Queensland Moon\" covers the life and death as a drover.\nPublic opinions.\nThe bush ballad style is sometimes seen as unsophisticated and simple. This is because it uses cliched images and stereotypes.\nThe bush ballads have influenced Australian theatre and movies. Since the mid-20th century, bush songs have often been performed by bush bands, such as The Bandicoots or Franklyn B Paverty. There have been female bush balladeers, including Shirley Thoms (1925-1999) known as Australia's yodeling sweetheart, and Indigenous singer-songwriter Yvonne Bradley.\nAwards.\nA number of awards have been set up to recognize bush balladeers. Jeff Brown was nominated for a Golden Guitar Award in the Bush Ballad of the Year category for a song he recorded \"In the wings of the yard\" in 2008. He said it was \"...important to keep the old yarns alive through country music ballads. It's our heritage really and it needs to be kept alive somehow and the old bush ballads are the way to do it.\" Past winners of the Country Music Awards Australia Bush Ballad of the Year include Anne Kirkpatrick and Joy McKean. The Stan Coster Memorial Bush Ballad Award has several categories. In 2007 Reg Poole was male vocalist of the year for \u2018A Tribute To Slim\u2019, Graham Rodger was Songwriter of the Year for \u2018The Battle Of Long Tan\u2019, and Dean Perrett for Album of the Year for \u2018New Tradition\u2019 The magazine, the \"Balladeers Bulletin\" magazine also hold a \"Bush Balladeer Starquest\" competition. At the 2008 36th Country Music Awards of Australia held in Tamworth, Amos Morris became the youngest artist ever to win the Golden Guitar trophy for the Bush Ballad of the Year category with \"Sign of the Times\".\nExamples.\nExamples of popular bush ballads and songs include:\nTraditional:\nThe Bush Bards:\nModern writers and singers:"}

In between them, the river Ganga flows eastwards and its main distributary, the Hooghly River, flows south to reach the Bay of Bengal. The Siliguri Corridor, which connects North-East India with rest of the India, lies in the North Bengal region of the state. Geographically, West Bengal is divided into a variety of regions\u2014Darjeeling Himalayan hill region, Terai and Dooars region, North Bengal plains, Rarh region, Western plateau and high lands, coastal plains, Sunderbans and the Ganga Delta.\nIn 1947, when India gained independence, the state of West Bengal was formed with 14 districts, as per partition plan of the then Bengal province of British India. The former princely state Koch Bihar joined as a district in 1950, and the former French enclave Chandannagore joined as part of the Hooghly district in 1954. The States Reorganisation Act of 1956 led to addition of Purulia district to the state and to enlargement of West Dinajpur district. Later, larger districts such as West Dinajpur, 24 Parganas and Midnapore were bifurcated. Till 24 June 2014 West Bengal was divided into 19 districts.\nWest Bengal is now divided into 23 districts which includes the newly formed Jhargram district, Alipurduar district and the Kalimpong district, Paschim Bardhaman district under five divisions and divisions are administered by Divisional Commissioners. Kolkata, the capital of the state, constitutes the Kolkata district. Other districts are further divided into administrative units such as subdivisions and blocks, administered by SDO and BDO, respectively. The Panchayati Raj has a three-tier structure in the state. The atomic unit is called a Gram Panchayat, which is the \"Panchayat\" organisation for a collection of villages. The block-level organisations are called \"Panchayat Samiti\", and the district-level organisations are named \"Zilla Parishad\".\nAdministrative structure.\nA district is governed by a District Collector, who is better known as a District Magistrate (DM) in the state of West Bengal. A DM is an officer from either Indian Administrative Service (IAS) or West Bengal Civil Service (WBCS), and is appointed by the State Government of West Bengal. Each district is divided into subdivisions, except the Kolkata district, which contains urban area only, administered by Kolkata Municipal Corporation. A subdivision is governed by a sub-divisional magistrate (SDM), better known as a Sub-Divisional Officer (SDO). Other than urban units such as town municipalities, a subdivision contains 'community development blocks' (also known as \"CD blocks\" or \"blocks\"). A block consists of urban units such as census towns and rural units called gram panchayats. A block is administered by a Block Development Officer (BDO), who is appointed by the Government of West Bengal.\nA gram panchayat, which consists of a group of villages, is administered by a village council headed by a \"Pradhan\". As per the West Bengal Panchayat Act, 1973, each Block has a \"Panchayat Samiti\", whose members include the \"Pradhan\"s of the constituent gram panchayats, and the MLAs from the block. A \"Panchayat Samiti\" is headed by a \"Sabhadhipati\". The third tier of the Panchayati Raj is \"Zilla Parishad\", a district level organisation with the \"Sabhapati\"s of the constituent \"Panchayat Samiti\"s and the MLAs from the district as its members. A \"Zilla Parishad\" is headed by a \"Sabhadhipati\". For the Darjeeling district, the \"Zilla Parishad\" has ceased to exist, but a similar organisation for the Siliguri subdivision exists, which is designated as a \"Mahakuma Parishad\".\nThe Gorkha Hill Council, formed in 1988, administers three (out of four) subdivisions of the Darjeeling district: Darjeeling Sadar, Kalimpong and Kurseong. Gorkha Hill Council manages the departments of Public Health, Education, Public Works, Transport, Tourism, Market, Small scale industries, Agriculture, Agricultural waterways, Forest (except reserved forests), Water, Livestock, Vocational Training and Sports and Youth services. District administration of Darjeeling, which is still responsible for election, \"panchayat\", law and order, revenue \"etc.\", also acts as an interface between the Council and the State Government.\nA District Superintendent of Police, better known as a Superintendent of Police, heads the District Police organisation of West Bengal Police. This is as per the Police Act of 1861, which is applicable to the whole of India. The Superintendents of Police are officers of the Indian Police Service. For every subdivision, there is a Subdivision Police, headed by a Police officer of the rank of Assistant Superintendent of Police or Deputy Superintendent of Police. Under subdivisions, there are Police Circles, each headed by an Inspector of Police. A Police Circle consists of Police Stations, each headed by an Inspector of Police, or in case of rural areas, by a Sub-Inspector of Police.\nThe Calcutta High Court has the jurisdiction of the state of West Bengal. Though most of the districts have more courts other than a District Court, not every subdivision of the state has a Court.\nA group of districts forms a division, which is administered by a 'Divisional Commissioner'. West Bengal is now divided in twenty three districts, grouped under five divisions:\nDemographics.\nThe following is a list of the basic demographic data for the districts of West Bengal by their population rank in India"}

It is celebrated in the memory Lord Bikshantar who will be provided food by Karaikal Ammaiyar, that is Amuthu Padayal in Tamil.\nReason of the celebration.\nThis festival's history relies on Karaikkal Ammaiyar's life.One day Ammaiyar's husband, Paramathathan, had sent two mangoes to be kept for him. That day a hungry Shaiva devotee (Lord Bikshantar) came to her residence. Ammaiyar gave the devotee, curd rice and one of the two mangoes which her husband gave earlier. Later, when Ammaiyar's husband came home, Ammaiyar served him the other mango. The mango was very delicious, and her husband requested that the other mango be served. Ammaiyar went inside kitchen, she didn't know what to do since the Mango is already served to the shaiva devotee(Lord Bikshantar). With Lord Siva's grace a Divine Mango appeared in her palm. Ammaiyaar was very happy and served the Mango to her husband.\nAs this fruit was divinely sweet and was infinitely delicious compared to the previous one, her husband inquired as to how Ammaiyar obtained this mango. Subsequently,Karaikkal Ammaiyar worshiped Lord's feet and revealed the truth to her husband, who didn't believe it. He asked her to show another mango with divine help. Ammaiyar prayed to Lord Shiva for another mango. Immediately Lord Shiva gave her a similar mango,which she gave it to her husband. The mango then disappeared, and Paramathathan realised the divine nature of his wife. He understood that Ammaiyar was worthy of worship and she cannot be treated as his wife. He then deserted Ammaiyar, becoming a trader and married the daughter of a merchant who then gave birth to their child. Paramathathan named the child with the real name of Ammaiyar, Punithavathi. When the word reached Ammaiyar's family, they decided that they must take her to him. When he saw his former wife, Paramathathan addressed her reverentially, saying that he realised Ammaiyar was no ordinary human being. He worshipped her with his wife and child. Ammaiyar prayed to Lord Shiva asking for a boon that she may worship Lord Shiva as a disembodied wraith. She received the boon, and leaving all her beauty and her body behind.This was the reason of formation of this grand festival of Mangani.\nCelebration.\nThe celebration is celebrated in the Tamil month of Aani (June\u2013July)lasting a month. Each day the Panchamurthi or the Five divine Gods idol are taken through each streets of Karaikal. On the main day of the festival the huge idol of Lord Bikshatanar is taken through the streets. On the same day, people of Karaikal throw Mangani or Mangoes from their roof towards the crowd.\nGoodness of eating the Mango caught in the festival are:\nIn the 30 days each day is celebrated with orchestras, debates, bharathanatyam dance etc. The official song of Mangani festival is composed by S.Natarajan, son of Kalaikavalar Karai Subbaiya, one of the most famous musician in Karaikal, owning an orchestra named Newtone Orchestra."}

James Madison Sr. (March 27, 1723 \u2013 February 27, 1801) was a prominent Virginia planter and politician. He was a colonel in the militia during the American Revolutionary War. He inherited Mount Pleasant, later known as Montpelier, a large tobacco plantation in Orange County, Virginia and, with the acquisition of more property, had 5,000 acres and became the largest landowner in the county. He was the father of James Madison, 4th President of the United States, who inherited what he called Montpelier, and Lieutenant General William Taylor Madison, and grandfather of Confederate Brigadier General James Edwin Slaughter.\nBiography.\nCol. James Madison Sr. was the son of planter and politician Ambrose Madison and his wife Frances Taylor, and was born in 1723 in Orange County, Virginia. When he was nine, his family moved to their new plantation of Mount Pleasant in 1732. His father had hired slaves and an overseer to clear it, work that had been going on for five years to establish cultivation. That summer (1732) his father died at age 36 in August after a short illness.\nThe family or the sheriff believed he was poisoned by slaves, and three were charged in the case and convicted by justices of the Commission of Peace. Unusually, only one slave was executed; Dido and Turk, owned by the widow Frances Taylor Madison, were returned to her to serve as laborers after being punished by whipping.\nJames was tutored and trained to be a planter and slaveholder, and member of the landed gentry. His widowed mother never remarried, which was unusual at that time for a woman her age; she had extensive Taylor family in the county. As the eldest son, James Madison Sr. inherited Mount Pleasant when he came of age in 1744. He called the plantation Home House. Acquiring more land, he eventually owned 5,000 acres, making him the largest landowner in Orange County. By the time of his death, he owned 108 slaves.\nMarriage and family.\nMadison married Nelly Conway (Port Conway, Caroline County, Virginia, January 9, 1731 \u2013 Montpelier, Orange County, Virginia, February 11, 1829), also of the planter class (her birthplace was named after her family). They had twelve children:\nAmerican Revolutionary War.\nDuring the American Revolution, Madison was chairman of the Orange County Committee of Safety. He was commissioned as a colonel in the Virginia militia."}

Most exotic atoms are hard to discover, because they decay very quickly. Positronium on average has a half-life (how long until half of the object is gone via decay) of 0.125 nanoseconds. There are a few types of exotic atom.\nMuonic atom.\nA muonic atom is an exotic atom that has a muon, instead of an electron, orbiting the nucleus. Because a muon is much more massive than an electron, the muon orbits much closer to the nucleus.\nHadronic atom.\nA hadronic atom is an exotic atom that has an electron replaced by a negatively charged hadron. The hadron could be a meson (such as a pion or a kaon, creating a pionic atom or a kaonic atom, respectively). Another hadronic atom is an antiproton (antiparticle of the proton) atom, that has an antiproton replacing an electron. This is known as an antiprotonic atom.\nOnium.\nAn onium is an exotic atom that has a particle bound to its antiparticle. A good example is Positronium, which is an electron bound to a positron.\nHypernuclear atom.\nA hypernuclear atom is an exotic atom that contains strange particles (a particle that is made of a strange quark) called hyperons."}

It was later found to be wrong. It was proposed by J.J. Thomson in 1904, after the electron had been discovered, but before the atomic nucleus was discovered. During that time, scientists knew that there was a positive charge in the atom that balanced out the negative charges of the electrons, making the atom neutral, but they didn't know where the positive charge was coming from. Thomson's model showed an atom that had a positively charged medium, or space, with negatively charged electrons inside the medium. Soon after its proposal, the model was called a \"plum pudding\" model because the positive medium was like a pudding, with electrons, or plums, inside. \nDevelopment into modern atomic model.\nRutherford's model.\nIn 1909, not long after Thomson's model was proposed, Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden made an experiment with thin sheets of gold, to test Thomson's model. Their professor, Ernest Rutherford, expected the results to prove Thomson correct, but their results were extremely different to what they were expecting. In 1911, Rutherford discovered that the positive charges come from tiny particles called protons, and that the protons were in a tiny center called the nucleus, and that the electrons were orbiting around the nucleus.\nNiels Bohr's Model.\nRutherford's model was quite simple, but it was later disproved because electrons have charge, and they should be attracted to the positively charged nucleus. In 1913, Niels Bohr added 'energy levels' to the atomic model. Electrons don't fall into the nucleus because they are contained in energy levels, and to change to higher energy levels extra energy is needed, and to change to lower energy levels a release of energy is needed. It is not possible to change energy states without changing the energy of the electron. If an electron gets hit by a photon (a particle that carries electromagnetic radiation) it will gain extra energy and go into a higher energy level (it changes states), then it will jump back down to a lower energy level, releasing its contained energy. This new model was called the Bohr model or the Rutherford-Bohr model. This added a whole new branch of science: Quantum physics.\nQuantum model.\nIn 1926 Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger used the idea that electrons acted as a wave, as well as a particle, this is known as a wave-particle duality. This added a whole new layer to the atomic model and quantum physics. With a particle, you can know where it is in space if you observe (look) at it. But with a wave, it is all over the place, so you can't define where exactly it is. This is known as quantum uncertainty. With an electron, you can only know the probability of it being in a place, because it is a wave as well as a particle. (See diagram above)"}

It may be for sitting or squatting. The urine may get mixed with the feces or be kept separate.\nThere are different types of dry toilets: composting toilet, urine-diverting dry toilet, Arborloo, container-based toilet, bucket toilet, pit latrine, incinerating toilet, or freezing toilet.\nTypes.\nAll of these types of dry toilets work without flush water and without connections to sewers or septic tanks:\nOther dry toilets are being developped, some with funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\nUses.\nThere are four main reasons for using dry toilets:\nDry toilets can be very presentable and are used in developed countries (for example, Sweden, Finland, and Norway), where they are often found at summer houses and national parks. They are more common in developing countries in places where flush toilets are not possible or not desired. Remember that sewers often cost too much where the land is rocky or irregular and where houses are far from one another.\nChallenges.\nSome people strongly believe that dry toilets are the best way deal with excrement, others argue that they cannot be done everywhere, and others simply do not want to change their habits. Dry toilets reduce water consumption and pollution, recover valuable nutrients for agriculture, and (when managed properly) eliminate diseases and chemicals efficiently. \nIt has been difficult to install and manage many dry toilets in cities (for example, in the Erdos Eco-City of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China). Designs need to be fine-tuned and we need to be very careful during construction and management.

It seems that these were often emptied directly onto gardens, where the excreta was used as fertiliser.[6] Sewer systems did not come to some rural areas in Britain until the 1950s or later.\nAustralia.\nBrisbane, Australia, was largely unsewered until the early 1970s, with many suburbs having dry toilets (called \"dunnies\") behind each house."}

After the Napoleonic Wars, Eisleben became part of the Kingdom of Prussia. The Prussian Province of Saxony became part of the Free State of Prussia in the German Reich after World War I.

It became known for its powerful and mystical abbesses, including Gertrude of Hackeborn, Gertrude the Great and Mechtild. However, Duke Albrecht of Brunswick destroyed the convent in 1342.

It celebrates the beginning of its new government on October1, 1949. It is one of two Golden Weeks in the country, along with the Chinese New Year.\nName.\nThe Mandarin Chinese name of the holiday is \"Gu\u00f3q\u00ecng Ji\u00e9\", which means \"Nation-Celebrating Holiday\" or \"Holiday of National Celebration\". It is written in traditional characters and in simplified characters. The holiday has also become a common given name in China, with around 420,000 people named \"Guoqing\" in 2010.\nHistory.\nFrom at least the time of the Western Jin dynasty in the late 3rd century, the birthday of the emperor was celebrated as a national holiday. After the Xinhai Revolution, the Republic of China celebrated its national day on October10.\nNear the end of the Chinese Civil War, Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party began the People's Republic of China on September21, 1949. This is sometimes known as \"Chinese Independence Day\". The PRC leaders and 300,000 Chinese celebrated the creation of the new government on October1 in Tian'anmen Square. At the first meeting of the first CPPCC on Oct.9, Xu Guangping introduced Ma Xulun's suggestion that China have a yearly national day celebrated apart from the birthday of the Communist Party. They recommended it be October1, the day of Mao's public message. The Central People's Government passed their suggestion on December2, making Oct.1 a yearly holiday. \nNational Day was celebrated with military parades in Beijing every year from 1949 to 1959. By 1960, the problems during the Great Leap Forward caused the government to suggest saving money on celebrations. From 1960 to 1970, there were no military parades but the day was still celebrated with large gatherings in Tian'anmen Square. After the Ninth Congress, the big meetings in Beijing were discouraged in favor of smaller events at parks and other locations from 1971 to 1983. 1984 saw the first military parade in many years, celebrating the PRC's 35th anniversary. There was another large military parade at the 50th anniversary in 1999, and a third at the 60th anniversary in the year after the Beijing Olympics.\nSince the year 2000, National Day has been one of the country's Golden Weeks: there are three days of paid time away from work from Oct.1 to Oct.3 and two weekends around it are moved to make a 7 day long holiday. These Golden Weeks copied a similar Japanese idea. The 2017 National Day was 8 days long, because it also included the Mid-Autumn Festival. In 2014, the day before National Day became Martyrs' Day, celebrating the soldiers and other Chinese who died creating the PRC.\nEvents.\nNational Day begins with the raising of the national flag at Tian'anmen Square in Beijing.\nThe holiday is associated with large military parades in Beijing. The leaders of the Chinese Communist Party give speeches and watch from Tian'anmen, the southern gate of the Forbidden City, and millions of Chinese people watch from Tian'anmen Square and on television. China no longer has these parades every year, but the idea now is to have a smaller parade every 5th anniversary and a larger parade every 10th anniversary. When these parades occur, the city tries very hard to keep everyone safe and to make the event look good. For the 2009 parade, the city police added 1,120,000 volunteers to patrol the streets. 50,000 policemen and women worked more than 25 hours without stopping for rest or sleep.\nEvery year, many large groups of flowers are put along Beijing's Chang'an Avenue. The 2017 centerpiece measured across its base and stood high. Lan Hailang and dozens of other designers and officials made it from April to September, with at least 70 big design changes. The finished designs should show how China is getting better and what it plans to do next. Parts of the 2017 flower designs show the Belt-and-Road Initiative to make China's connections with Central Asia better; other parts show ways Beijing and Tianjin are going to be better over the next few years.\nThere are state dinners in Beijing and at Chinese embassies around the world throughout the week.\nIn the evening, fireworks are set off in Beijing, Hong Kong, and other large cities. There are also some singing, dancing, painting, and calligraphy celebrations. In Shanghai, the Tourism Festival's Music Fireworks Festival happens during the weeklong holiday. It is one of Asia's largest fireworks shows.\nThe long holiday also helps Chinese tourism, with millions of people traveling around the country visiting family members or sightseeing. This leads to higher prices and crowds, though, so foreign visitors are usually encouraged to come at other times of the year instead. The 1st day of the 2017 National Day vacation set records for the national rail system: more than 15 million trips were taken over 24 hours.\nUnlike traditional Chinese holidays, National Day is not associated with any special food."}

They can also be used to build furniture and theatrical riggings. The fittings slip on the pipe and are usually locked down with a set screw. The set screw can then be tightened with a simple hex wench. Because of the modular design of standard fittings, assembly is easy, only simple hand tools are required, and risks from welding a structure are eliminated.\nOther advantages of using structural pipe fittings are easy installation and reconfigurable design. Since there are no permanent welds in the structure, the set screws of the fittings can simply be loosened, allowing them to be repositioned. The project can be disassembled and stored if needed, or even taken apart with fittings and pipe recycled into a new project.\nFittings used for strong structures are galvanised malleable iron castings, and come in many styles such as elbows, tees, crosses, reducers and flanges. The fittings are not threaded; they simply lock onto the pipe with the supplied hex set screws."}

It celebrates Qu Yuan, a writer and a government leader who lived a long time ago and died because he loved his country very much. The Dragon Boat Festival is always on the 5th day of the 5th month of China's old calendar, but\u2014because that calendar is based on changes in the moon and not the sun\u2014it is not always on the same day of the new calendar. The old calendar adds a 13th month when it is very different from the seasons, though, so the Dragon Boat Festival is always in late spring.\nName.\nIn Chinese, the Dragon Boat Festival is usually called \"Du\u0101nw\u01d4 Ji\u00e9\", which means the \"Holiday of Welcoming the Seventh\". This name is based on the old calendar, which used a group of 12 names as a kind of week. Chinese people write it in traditional characters and in simplified characters.\nHistory.\nA long time ago in China, this holiday may have celebrated the harvest of \"winter wheat\" or dragon gods with power over rivers and seas. By the time of Sima Qian, an important writer of history who lived around 100, different people used the festival to remember Qu Yuan, Wu Zixu, or Cao E. Today, most Chinese people are taught that the holiday remembers Qu Yuan.\nQu Yuan was an important writer of poems who lived around 300. He lived at a time when the government of China was very weak and all its different parts began to say they were different countries. Qu Yuan's part was called Chu, and its king Xiong Huai was so powerful that he controlled Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and most of the places around them. King Huai listened to other leaders who said bad things about Qu Yuan and made him move to the countryside twice. King Huai also made other mistakes that also hurt Chu. The second time that Qu Yuan was sent away, he wrote a long poem about his sadness and then killed himself by walking into the Miluo River with a heavy stone. People don't agree about exactly why he did this but most think it was because of sadness for his country or a last try to make his king pay attention to his many mistakes.\nThe Republic of China celebrated the Dragon Boat Festival as to celebrate Qu Yuan and other Chinese writers.\nFor a long time, the People's Republic of China did not pay attention to the Dragon Boat Festival but, in 2005, it was one of three traditional Chinese holidays approved for celebration. Since 2008, it has been a national holiday.\nEvents.\nAll over China, people make and eat little pyramids of sticky rice called zongzis to celebrate the Dragon Boat Festival. In southern China, some people also race dragon boats in rivers or in the sea. Both traditions are said to have started when local people ran to the Miluo River to throw zongzis around Qu Yuan's body to protect it from fish and dragons.\nThere are also some older traditions to get ready for the Chinese summer, like drinking rice wine with pesticides to avoid snakes and mosquitos. These are less common today."}

{"id": "600425", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=600425", "title": "Scriptio continua", "text": "Scriptio continua (Latin for \"continuous script\") is a style of writing that does not use spaces, different letter cases, or punctuation to tell apart words, phrases, or sentences. It was a common way of writing for texts in Ancient Greek and Classical Latin. Even though Greek and Latin speakers already created punctuation to tell words apart, \"scriptio continua\" was often used to save space. This was because writing materials were expensive and the boundaries between words, clauses, and sentences are not so clear in spoken language. \nUse of \"scriptio continua\" became less common after the fall of the Roman Empire, and spaces began to appear between words. The first known documents that used spacing were Irish and Anglo-Saxon Bibles and Gospels. However, \"scriptio continua\" is still used for the writing systems for several modern languages, including Southeast Asian abugidas like Thai, Lao, Khmer, Burmese, Javanese, Balinese, and Tibetan. Languages that use the Chinese character system like Chinese and Japanese sometimes use \"scriptio continua\", even though modern Chinese and Japanese stopped using it when they adopted punctuation during the 19th and 20th centuries.\nExamples.\nLatin.\nThe first sentence below is the first sentence of Ovid's Metamorphoses written in Latin using \"scriptio continua\" writing, the second is the same sentence written in Latin using spaces, punctuation and cases, and the third is an English translation. In all the Latin sentences, all the letter U's have been replaced with letter V's.\nEnglish.\nThe first sentence is the biblical verse John 3:16 in the King James Version written in English using \"scriptio continua\" writing, and the second is the same sentence written in English using spaces, punctuation and cases.\nDue to the internet, modern English developed a form of \"scriptio continua\" through email and URL web addresses. Since spaces are invalid characters, the URL for the website \"Example Fake Website\" would be examplefakewebsite.com.\nChinese.\nChinese had no sort of punctuation until the 20th century, and only added punctuation because of their interactions with Western countries. Chinese is still fairly readable even without punctuation and spacing because each Chinese character represents an entire word or morpheme (the smallest meaningful units of language) instead of single sounds like an alphabet.\nThe first sentence below is a sentence written in modern Chinese, the second is the same sentence using \"scriptio continua\" writing, the third is the sentence written with spaces in between the words, the fifth is the sentence written in Hanyu Pinyin, and the fifth is the sentence translated into English.\nJapanese.\nLike Chinese, Japanese also does not use spacing in its writing. Even though Japanese also uses many Chinese characters (called kanji in Japanese) in its writing, the two languages are actually very different from each other. When Japanese was first written, it was written entirely in kanji and man'yogana (kanji used only for writing the sounds of Japanese). Chinese characters could be used to either tell a words' pronunciation or its meaning, so it made Japanese very hard to read. Even native Japanese speakers had a hard time reading ancient Japanese writings.\nLater during the 10th century, the Japanese created different sound-based systems to write more quickly and to tell apart phonetic-loan characters and semantic-based characters more easily. These writing systems are called kana.\nToday Japanese uses three different writing systems, kanji for showing the meanings of words, and hiragana and katakana for showing the sounds of words. While Japanese does not use spacing, native Japanese speakers can still tell apart words quickly because the three different types of writing look quite different from each other, and each writing system is usually used for a certain kind of word. Kanji is usually used to write native Japanese words, Chinese loanwords, and the roots of content words (nouns, adjective, adjectives, adverbs). Hiragana is usually used for common phrases, particles, and the inflections of content words. Katakana is usually used for loanwords from languages other than Chinese, onomatopoeia, and for extra emphasis.\nAlso like Chinese, it used no punctuation until after it had major interactions with Western countries, and it did not have any punctuation until the Meiji Period, when Japan quickly modernized.\nThe first sentence below is sentence written in Japanese using hiragana, katakana and kanji without spaces between words. The second is written in hiragana, katakana and kanji with spaces in between words (including particles). The third is written only in hiragana and katakana. The fourth is written entirely in romaji (Japanese written in the Latin alphabet). The fifth is the sentence translated translated in English. The sixth is written using \"scriptio continua\" entirely in kanji and man'y\u014dgana."}

{"id": "600466", "revid": "10441", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=600466", "title": "Yamato kotoba", "text": "Yamato kotoba (kanji: \u5927\u548c\u8a00\u8449, hiragana: \u3084\u307e\u3068\u3053\u3068\u3070) are words that are native to the Japanese language. The word itself is also a native Japanese word, interestingly enough. Yamato kotoba can also be called by its Chinese based name, wago (kanji: \u548c\u8a9e, hiragana: \u308f\u3054). It is one of the three main sources of Japanese words, along with \"kango\" (kanji: \u6f22\u8a9e, hiragana: \u304b\u3093\u3054), or Chinese loanwords, and \"gairaigo\" (kanji: \u5916\u6765\u8a9e, hiragana: \u304c\u3044\u3089\u3044\u3054), or loanwords borrowed from languages other than Chinese (especially English since the post-WWII era).\nYamato kotoba in Japanese has much in common with native English words in that most of the everyday vocabulary comes from yamato kotoba, while Chinese loanwords words (much like Latin and French loanwords in English) are used for more formal situations (usually writing) and for specialized terms.\nHow to write \"yamato kotoba\".\nUsually, words with only one kanji are yamato kotoba, such as \"katana\" (kanji: \u5200, hiragana: \u304b\u305f\u306a, meaning: sword), \"sakana\" (kanji: \u9b5a, hiragana: \u3055\u304b\u306a, meaning: fish), \"kami\" (kanji: \u7d19, hiragana: \u304b\u307f, meaning: paper), \"yama\" (kanji: \u5c71, hiragana: \u3084\u307e, meaning: mountain) \"te\" (kanji: \u624b, hiragana: \u3066, meaning: hand), and \"oyogu\" (kanji and hiragana: \u6cf3\u3050, hiragana only: \u304a\u3088\u3050, meaning: to swim). Most kanji (the Japanese version of Chinese characters) have two different kinds of pronunciation, on'yomi (the pronunciation of the kanji borrowed from Chinese) and kun'yomi (the native pronunciation of Japanese words that use the kanji). Yamato kotoba words use the kanji's kun'yomi.\nSince on'yomi came from Chinese monosyllables (words with only one syllable), they themselves are also only one syllable, and like Chinese, they can have a CV or CVC structure. For example, the on'yomi for the following kanji \u5200, \u9b5a, \u7d19, \u5c71, \u624b, and \u6cf3 are \"t\u014d, shi, san, shu, and ei.\" However, kun'yomi can have one or multiple syllables, and those syllables are usually a CV structure, like the examples given above.\nSince Japanese uses three different writing systems interchangeably, even yamato kotoba can be written in several different ways. For example, the word \"sushi\" can be written entirely in hiragana as \u3059\u3057, entirely in katakana as \u30b9\u30b7, in kanji as \u9ba8 or \u9b93, or in ateji (kanji used only to show a word's pronunciation and not its meaning) as \u5bff\u53f8 or \u58fd\u53f8.\nKanji usually show the root meaning of the word. While nouns are usually written only with kanji, they can also be written in kana if they are very common words, like \"sushi\", or if their kanji is not well known, not part of the \"j\u014dy\u014d kanji\" (a standard list of 1,945 kanji all Japanese adults are expected to know) or too difficult to remember how to write, like \"bara,\" whose kanji is \u8594\u8587, but is usually only written as \u3070\u3089 in hiragana or as \u30d0\u30e9 in katakana. \nJapanese also invented many of its own kanji to name things that could be found in Japan, but not China (usually plants and animals). These are called \"kokuji\" (kanji: \u56fd\u5b57, hiragana: \u3053\u304f\u3058) meaning \"national characters\", or \"wasei-kanji\" (kanji: \u548c\u88fd\u6f22\u5b57, hiragana: \u308f\u305b\u3044\u304b\u3093\u3058) meaning \"Japanese-made Chinese characters\". \"Kokuji\" include the names of fish like \"iwashi\" (kanji: \u9c2f, hiragana: \u3044\u308f\u3057, meaning: sardine), \"tara\" (kanji: \u9c48, hiragana: \u305f\u3089, meaning: codfish), and \"kisu\" (kanji: \u9c5a, hiragana: \u304d\u3059, meaning: sillago), and trees like \"kashi\" (kanji: \u6a2b, hiragana: \u304b\u3057, meaning: evergreen oak), \"sugi\" (kanji: \u6919, hiragana: \u3059\u304e, meaning: Japanese cedar), and \"kaba\" or \"momiji\" (kanji: \u691b, hiragana: \u304b\u3070/\u3082\u307f\u3058, meaning: birch/maple). Most \"kokuji\" only have kun'yomi because they are \"yamato kotoba\", but some kanji also have on'yomi, like \u50cd (on'yomi: d\u014d \u3069\u3046, kun'yomi: hatara(ku) \u306f\u305f\u3089(\u304f), meaning: work), and some have only on'yomi, like \u817a (on'yomi: sen \u305b\u3093, meaning: gland). \n\"Yamato kotoba\" parts of speech.\nOther content words like verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are usually written in a combination of kanji and hiragana, where the root of the word is written in kanji and the inflectional morphemes (the parts of the word that don't change the central meaning of the word's root) are written in hiragana. For example, the native Japanes verb meaning \"to swim\" is \"oyogu\" in its plain form, where it is written as \u6cf3\u3050 in kanji and hiragana. The kanji \u6cf3 shows the verb's meaning, while \u3050 (gu) as in \"oyo-gu\" shows that the word is in its plain form. The polite form of \"to swim\" is \"oyogimasu\", which is written as \u6cf3\u304e\u307e\u3059 in kanji and hiragana. Once again, it has the same kanji, but it ends with different syllables \u304e\u307e\u3059 (gi-ma-su) as in \"oyo-gimasu\" to show that the word is in the polite form. Native Japanese adjectives usually end in with the syllable \u3044 (\"-i),\" like the word \"hayai\" (kanji and hiragana: \u901f\u3044, hiragana only: \u306f\u3084\u3044, meaning: fast), \"takai\" (kanji and hiragana: \u9ad8\u3044, hiragana only: \u305f\u304b\u3044, meaning: tall, high), and \"ookii\" (kanji and hiragana: \u5927\u304d\u3044, hiragana only: \u304a\u304a\u304d\u3044, meaning: big or large), while native Japanese adverbs are simply adjectives that end in \u304f (\"-ku\") rather than \u3044, like \"hayaku\u3000\"(kanji and hiragana: \u901f\u304f, hiragana only: \u306f\u3084\u304f, meaning: quickly).\nNouns based on adjectives end with the syllable \u3055 (\"-sa\"), as in \"hayasa\" (kanji and hiragana: \u901f\u3055, hiragana only: \u306f\u3084\u3055, meaning: speed), \"takasa\" (kanji and hiragana: \u9ad8\u3055, hiragana only: \u305f\u304b\u3055, meaning: height), and \"ookisa\" (kanji and hiragana: \u5927\u304d\u3055, hiragana only: \u304a\u304a\u304d\u3055, meaning: size/largeness).\nSometimes, native Japanese nouns can be written with multiple kanji. These are usually proper nouns like family names or place names. Japanese family names are usually \"yamato kotoba\", like Tanaka (kanji: \u7530\u4e2d, hiragana: \u305f\u306a\u304b), Yamamoto (kanji: \u5c71\u672c, hiragana: \u3084\u307e\u3082\u3068), and Kobayashi (kanji: \u5c0f\u6797, hiragana: \u3053\u3070\u3084\u3057). Most Japanese place names are also \"yamoto kotoba\", like \u014csaka (kanji: \u5927\u962a, hiragana: \u304a\u304a\u3055\u304b), Ehime (kanji: \u611b\u5a9b, hiragana: \u3048\u3072\u3081), and Hiroshima (kanji: \u5e83\u5cf6, hiragana: \u3072\u308d\u3057\u307e), although there are also plenty of Japanese places with Chinese-based names, like T\u014dky\u014d (kanji: \u6771\u4eac, hiragana: \u3068\u3046\u304d\u3087\u3046), Mt. Fuji or \"Fuji-san\" (kanji: \u5bcc\u58eb\u5c71, hiragana:\u3075\u3058\u3055\u3093), and Honsh\u016b (kanji: \u672c\u5dde, hiragana: \u307b\u3093\u3057\u3085\u3046).\nWhile usually cardinal numbers (numbers for measuring things) in Japanese are based off of Chinese words, most ordinal numbers (numbers for ordering things) and even certain measure words use native Japanese words. The following table has Sino-Japanese numerals (Japanese numbers based on Chinese) on the left and native Japanese numerals on the right."}

{"id": "600717", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=600717", "title": "Liberland", "text": "Liberland, officially called the Free Republic of Liberland, is a micronation that started on an unclaimed piece of land on the western part of the Danube River between Croatia and Serbia. Liberland was founded on 13 April 2015 by Czech libertarian activist V\u00edt Jedli\u010dka.\nThe official Liberland website says the nation was created on no-man's land ((terra nullius) that emerged because Croatia and Serbia have not agreed on common borders for over 25 years. This border dispute includes some areas to the east of the Danube which are claimed by both Serbia and Croatia. Croatia considers some areas on the west side of the river, including Liberland, to be part of Serbia, although Serbia no longer claims that land.\nThe land is under de facto administration by Croatia since the Croatian War of Independence but Croatia has blocked people's access to Liberland since shortly after its founding. Croatia has also prevented Croatian citizens and other EU citizens from visiting the area. Before that, just about anyone could visit the area.\nNo country that is a member of the United Nations has given full diplomatic recognition to Liberland, although Liberland has opened official relations with Somaliland and Haiti as well as other partially recognized and unrecognized states and micronations.\nPlace.\nThe border disagreement along the Danube River valley started in 1947 but was left unresolved during the existence of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. After the country of Yugoslavia broke apart, the disagreement became more prominent. Serbia claims the thalweg of the Danube valley and the center line of the river is the international border between the two countries. The Croatian government disagrees and claims that the international border lies along the old lines of the cadastral municipalities along the river \u2014 as the Danube was in the 19th century before meandering and hydraulic engineering works changed its course. As a result, Croatia claims a large part of the area controlled by Serbia, while Serbia does not claim the smaller parts on the other side.\nPresident Jedli\u010dka says that the land claimed for Liberland, known as \"Gornja\u00a0Siga\" (meaning \"upper tufa\"), remains unclaimed by Croatia or Serbia.\nThe area is about , and most of it is covered with forests. A journalist from the Czech newspaper \"Parlamentn\u00ed listy\" who visited the area in April 2015 found a house that had been abandoned for about thirty years, according to people living in the vicinity. The access road was reported to be in a bad condition.\nThe Danube River, an international waterway with free access to the Black Sea for several landlocked nations, runs along the self-proclaimed territory. Liberland visitors and citizens come to the area by boat from Apatin, Serbia and other ports and docks along the Danube River. Liberland keeps its ships the Bitcoin Freedom and the SS Liberty at the local marina, has bought land and buildings in the Apatin Free Trade Zone and recently opened \"Ark EcoVillage\" on a piece of land formerly known as Zelena Glava (\"Golden Head\").\nHistory.\nAnnouncement of the new country.\nThe flag ceremony in Gornja Siga was performed by V\u00edt Jedli\u010dka and others on the same day the statehood of Liberland was proclaimed.\nThe flag is a yellow background (symbolizing libertarianism) with a black horizontal stripe through the centre (symbolizing anarchy or rebellion) and the coat of arms in the centre. Jedli\u010dka is a member of the Czech Party of Free Citizens, which bases its values on the classical liberal ideology.\nJedli\u010dka stated that neither Serbia, Croatia nor any other nation claims the land (no-man's land or \"terra nullius\"). The border, he argued, was defined according to both Croatian and Serbian border claims and did not interfere with any other state's sovereignty. Jedli\u010dka said in April 2015 that an official diplomatic note would be sent to both Croatia and Serbia, and later to all other states, with a formal request for international recognition.\nOn 18 December 2015, President Jedli\u010dka presented the first provisional government of Liberland and its Ministers of Finance, Foreign Affairs, Interior and Justice as well as two vice presidents.\nEntering Liberland.\nCroatian authorities have blocked entry to Liberland since early May 2015.\nIn May 2015, V\u00edt Jedli\u010dka and his translator Sven Sambunjak were shortly detained by Croatian police after making an attempt to cross the border. Jedli\u010dka spent one night in jail and then was convicted and ordered to pay a penalty for illegal crossing of the Croatian border but appealed the verdict. He claimed that there were at least three Liberland citizens inside the area, who came from Switzerland. \nLater that month, V\u00edt Jedli\u010dka was detained again. Initially, reporters were able to enter the area with Jedli\u010dka but subsequently they were also denied entry, including journalists from the Serbian public broadcast service Radio Television of Vojvodina, and from the Bosnian newspaper \"Dnevni Avaz\".\nThe people arrested were from many countries, including Ireland, Germany, Denmark, and the U.S. Croatian police continued to arrest people, including those who entered the area by boat via the international waterway. One of them, a Danish activist Ulrik Gr\u00f8ssel Haagensen, was placed in house arrest for 5 days before being sentenced to 15 days of prison, triggering some protests in Denmark.\nIn May 2016, several appeals court decisions from Croatia were published. The court upheld the rulings that crossing into Liberland from Croatia is illegal, but found the convictions for entering Liberland from Serbia were not correct. The court said that the lower court committed \"a fundamental breach of misdemeanor proceedings\" and \"essential procedural violations\". It further ruled that \"the facts were incorrectly and incompletely established [by the prosecutor] which could lead to misapplication of substantive law.\" A retrial was ordered in 6 of the 7 appeals. The lower court is therefore required to determine the location of the border and the border crossing, but has not done this yet. Since that time, visitors have come the area in boats, but have not permanently settled the area, and conflicts with Croatian police have been avoided.\nLegality.\nCroatia and Serbia dismissed Jedli\u010dka's claims as not important, although the two countries reacted in different ways. On 24 April 2015, the Serbian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that while they consider the affair a trivial matter, the \"new state\" does not infringe upon the Serbian border, which they say is the Danube River. Croatia, which blocks people from accessing Liberland, has stated that after international arbitration, it should be awarded to Croatia or Serbia, not to a third party.\nAn article in the Chicago Journal of International Law, the law review of the University of Chicago Law School, examined Liberland's claim to statehood in light of the criteria laid out by the Montevideo Convention. According to the author, \"Croatia\u2019s insistence that Liberland is part of Serbia could constitute a renunciation of Croatia\u2019s legal rights to Liberland. Conversely, if the territory that Liberland claims as its own is Serbian, the Serbian government\u2019s renunciation of its title to that land could also be a quitclaim that would transform the legal status of the land to \"terra nullius\". In both instances, the territory would belong to the first entity \u2014in this case Liberland\u2014 to claim it.\u201d\nReactions.\nLegal experts in Serbia and Croatia have asked if, under international law, Jedli\u010dka has the right to claim the area, which is currently the subject of a dispute between the two nations but claimed by neither one. Journalists have been uncertain as to how serious Jedli\u010dka is about his claims, with some calling it a publicity stunt.\nOn 20 May 2015 Petr Mach, the leader of the Party of Free Citizens, expressed support for the creation of a state based on ideas of freedom, adding that the Party of Free Citizens wants the Czech Republic to become a similarly free country.\nGoran Vojkovi\u0107, professor of law and columnist from the Croatian news portal \"Index.hr\", described Liberland as a \"circus which threatens Croatian territory\", and argued that there was a risk that Croatia's claim to control land on the other side of the Danube may be weakened by the attention that the Liberland project has drawn to the border dispute.\nIn 2016, an article in Stratfor summarized the initiative as follows: \"Liberland is a curious case because, in principle, none of the actors that could claim control over it seems interested in doing so. But this will probably remain a curiosity with negligible consequences at the international level. For the rest of the world's disputed territories, violence and diplomacy will remain the main tools to claim ownership.\nCitizenship.\nAccording to its web page, Liberland is currently looking for those who have respect for other people and respect the opinions of others, regardless of their race, ethnicity, orientation, or religion, have respect for private ownership which is untouchable, and have not been punished for serious criminal offences. Liberland received 200,000 applications in a week. In the beginning of May 2015, Liberland accepted around thirty citizens. An event was supposed to take place in the claimed territory, but Croatian border police stopped the group from entering it from the Croatian side. As of October 2017, Liberland has awarded citizenship to between 300 and 400 people, to persons who have \"helped move the country forward\" or earned at least 5000 Merits. On February 16, 2018, former Congressman Ron Paul was presented with a Liberland passport and citizenship certificate by Jedli\u010dka and his cabinet.\nLiberland also presents an Order of Merit award called the \"First Class Order of Merit\" to persons who have contributed to the development of Liberland or to the ideas of freedom. Recipients have included publisher Steve Forbes, economist Mark Skousen, Croatian Member of Parliament Ivan Pernar, and others.\nThe Liberland constitution has been drafted and revised several times. The draft consists of four chapters. It includes a Bill of Rights and regulates the public administration, the political institutions, the legislative power, and the judicial power.\nRecognition.\nThere has been no diplomatic recognition of Liberland by any member of the United Nations. However, Liberland has established relations with Somaliland, a self-declared state that proclaimed its independence from Somalia in 1991. Liberland and Somaliland signed a Memorandum of Understanding in September 2017 promising to establish closer relations and cooperate in the areas of technology, energy and banking. \n Liberland also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the government of Haiti in 2020.\nLiberland President Jedli\u010dka and members of Liberland's provisional government make regular goodwill visits around the world to make the case for Liberland and to promote diplomatic and commercial ties to the project. In 2017, Jedli\u010dka met with U.S. Senators Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Ben Sasse and the Democratic Shadow Senator from Washington, D.C. Paul Strauss as well as several other elected representatives in the United States. In February 2018, Jedli\u010dka and his U.S. team went to Washington, D.C. to meet with Senator Bob Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee as well as Senator Lamar Alexander.\nLiberland has also established relations with the region of Savoie (Savoy), an independent and self-governed territory from the 11th century until 1860, when it was annexed to France. Today, Savosian people are a minority in their own territory and their claims are not taken into account by the government of France. Liberland has also begun dialogue with the region of Brittany (Bretagne), among others.\nOn 5th December 2018, UK Libertarian MEP Bill Etheridge and Paul Brothwood hosted an event for Liberland in the European Parliament to discuss its future.\nSupport from political parties.\nSince 2015, several minor freedom parties expressed support for the creation of Liberland. They are the Capitalist Party in Norway, the Libertarian Party (Spain), The Swiss Independence Party up! (Unabh\u00e4ngigkeitspartei), the Liberal Democratic Party (Turkey) (LDP) the Libertarian Party of Canada, the Libertarian Party (United States) and the UK Libertarian Party.\nStatements from other micronation projects.\nA few micronations have expressed support for the idea of Liberland."}

{"id": "600779", "revid": "6603787", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=600779", "title": "Gairaigo", "text": "Gairaigo (kanji: \u5916\u6765\u8a9e, hiragana: \u304c\u3044\u3089\u3044\u3054) are loanwords in the Japanese language from languages other than Old or Middle Chinese. The word itself literally means \"loan word\". Most \"gairaigo\" come from European languages, and especially English since the post-WWII era, though Modern Chinese and Modern Korean are also popular sources for loanwords. Most gairaigo nowadays are written in katakana, with some older ones being written in ateji (kanji used only to show a word's pronunciation and not its meaning) or even in hiragana. For example, while America, or \"Amerika\" in Japanese, can be written as \u4e9c\u7c73\u5229\u52a0 in ateji, it is rare to do so these days, and instead it is almost always written in katakana as \u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab.\n\"Gairaigo\" is one of the three main sources of Japanese words, along with \"kango\" (kanji: \u6f22\u8a9e, hiragana: \u304b\u3093\u3054), or Chinese loanwords, and \"yamato kotoba\" (kanji: \u5927\u548c\u8a00\u8449, hiragana: \u3084\u307e\u3068\u3053\u3068\u3070), or native Japanese words.\n\"Gairaigo\" history.\nJapanese has a long history of borrowing words from other languages. Since the Chinese character system gave Japanese a writing system (as Japanese had no known systems of writing beforehand), the Japanese naturally borrowed many Chinese words into their language. However, the Japanese only borrowed words from other Asian languages until the Portuguese and the Dutch came to Japan during the 16th century. Since the Portuguese and the Dutch traded many different goods with the Japanese at this time, the Japanese naturally included many Portuguese and Dutch words into their own language, including \"karuta\" (ateji: \u52a0\u7559\u591a or \u6b4c\u7559\u591a, hiragana: \u304b\u308b\u305f, katakana: \u30ab\u30eb\u30bf) from the Portuguese \"carta\" meaning \"letter\", \"tempura\" (ateji: \u5929\u9ea9\u7f85 or \u5929\u5a66\u7f85, ateji and hiragana [most common form]: \u5929\u3077\u3089, hiragana: \u3066\u3093\u3077\u3089, katakana: \u30c6\u30f3\u30d7\u30e9), from the Portuguese \"tempora\" meaning \"temperance\", as Catholics would not eat red meat during Lent, and \"tabako\" (kanji: \u7159\u8349, hiragana: \u305f\u3070\u3053, katakana: \u30bf\u30d0\u30b3) from the Portuguese \"tabaco\" meaning \"tobacco\". While these terms used to be written mostly in ateji (and they still can be), they are now mostly written only in hiragana or katakana.\nDuring the Meiji Period, after Matthew Perry forced Japan to open trade with other countries, Japan sent many scholars to Western countries to study different field of knowledge, such as Western medicine in Germany, an art in France. However, since the end of the 19th century, and especially after WWII, most \"gairaigo\" came from English. Today, about 90% of all \"gairaigo\" come from English.\nJapanese-invented English words.\nWhile many \"gairaigo\" came from English, Japanese has also invented many new words based off of English, but wouldn't be understood by native English speakers. These are called \"wasei eigo\", or \"Japanese-made English words\". Many of them are shortenings of English words such as \"amefuto\" (katakana:\u30a2\u30e1\u30d5\u30c8) which is a shortening of \"American football\", \"pasokon\" (katakana:\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3) which is a shortening of \"personal computer\", \"konbini\" (katakana:\u30b3\u30f3\u30d3\u30cb) which is a shortening of \"convenience store\", and \"anime\" (katakana: \u30a2\u30cb\u30e1) which is a shortening of \"animation\". While each of these words have a longer gairaigo word that go along with them which would be \"amerikanfutob\u014dru\" (katakana:\u30a2\u30e1\u30ea\u30ab\u30f3\u30d5\u30c3\u30c8\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb), \"p\u0101sonarukonpy\u016bt\u0101\" (katakana:\u30d1\u30fc\u30bd\u30ca\u30eb\u30b3\u30f3\u30d4\u30e5\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc), \"konbiniensusutoa\" (katakana:\u30b3\u30f3\u30d3\u30cb\u30a8\u30f3\u30b9\u30b9\u30c8\u30a2), and \"anim\u0113shon\" (katakana:\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3) in that order, they would be too long for a Japanese person to say in conversation. Also, some words got a new meaning when they come into Japanese. For example, \"consent\", or \"konsento\" (katakana:\u30b3\u30f3\u30bb\u30f3\u30c8) in Japanese, means \"electrical outlet\" rather than its original meaning, and \"range\", or (katakana:\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8) in Japanese, means \"stove\" rather than its original meaning."}

The early village was composed of two parts, Tupper Lake proper and Faust. The town for a time held the distinction as the top lumber producer in the state.\nThe great fire of 1899 burned more than 169 structures in the village, two-thirds of them being homes. The modern village grew out of this destruction and added all the amenities of a modern community earlier than many other villages in the state.

{"id": "600912", "revid": "935126", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=600912", "title": "Sino-Japanese vocabulary", "text": "Sino-Japanese vocabulary, Chinese-based Japanese words, or kango (kanji: \u6f22\u8a9e, hiragana: \u304b\u3093\u3054), are Chinese loanwords in the Japanese language. The two languages are unrelated to each other, since Chinese is a Sino-Tibetan language while Japanese is a language isolate (meaning that no known languages are related to it). However, Chinese has had a major influence on Japanese and has effected many parts of it, including its phonology (how it organizes sounds) and its vocabulary. Including Chinese words into Japanese lead to allowing words to have closed syllables (syllables ending in a consonant), like the words \"san\" (kanji: \u4e09, hiragana: \u3055\u3093, meaning: three) and \"udon\" (kanji:\u9942\u98e9, hiragana: \u3046\u3069\u3093) and for words to have long vowels and long consonants, like \"n\u014d\" (kanji:\u80fd, hiragana: \u306e\u3046) and \"gakk\u014d\" (kanji: \u5b66\u6821, hiragana: \u304c\u3063\u3053\u3046). Before Chinese words came into the Japanese language syllables in Japanese words only had open syllables (words that end in a vowel) like \"katana\" (kanji:\u5200, hiragana: \u304b\u305f\u306a) and \"shinobi\" (kanji and hiragana: \u5fcd\u3073, hiragana only: \u3057\u306e\u3073).\nIt is one of the three main sources of Japanese words, along with \"yamato kotoba\" (kanji: \u5927\u548c\u8a00\u8449, hiragana: \u3084\u307e\u3068\u3053\u3068\u3070), also known as \"wago\" (kanji: \u548c\u8a9e, hiragana: \u308f\u3054), or native Japanese words, and \"gairaigo\" (kanji: \u5916\u6765\u8a9e, hiragana: \u304c\u3044\u3089\u3044\u3054), or loanwords borrowed from languages other than Chinese (especially English since the post-WWII era).\nChinese loanwords in Japanese vs. French and Latin loanwords in English.\nIt is said that about 60-70% of Japanese words come from Chinese. Like how French and Latin are to English, Chinese loanwords are used to create formal vocabulary and technical terms in Japanese. For example, while the native English words are \"moon\" and \"horse\", the Latin terms \"luna\" and \"equus\" is used to create technical terms like \"lunar calendar\", a calendar that is based on the moon, and \"equine science\", the study of horses. Likewise, the native Japanese word for horse is uma (kanji: \u99ac, hiragana: \u3046\u307e) while the Chinese term is ba (kanji:\u99ac, hiragana: \u3070), which is used in terms like basha (kanji:\u99ac\u8eca, hiragana: \u3070\u3057\u3083, meaning: horse carriage), j\u014dba (kanji:\u4e57\u99ac, hiragana: \u3058\u3087\u3046\u3070, meaning: horse riding), and gunba (kanji:\u8ecd\u99ac, hiragana: \u3050\u3093\u3070, meaning: warhorse).\nMost Chinese loanwords are nouns, and they are often made up of more than one kanji (Chinese characters used in Japanese). Most kanji have two different kinds of pronunciation, on'yomi (the pronunciation of the kanji borrowed from Chinese) and kun'yomi (the native pronunciation of Japanese words that use the kanji). \"Yamato kotoba\" words use the kanji's kun'yomi. While Japanese usually use the kun'yomi for words of just one kanji, like \u706b (on'yomi: ka, meaning: fire) which is pronounced \"hi\", and \u5c71 (on'yomi: san, -zan, meaning: mountain) which is pronounced \"yama\", when you put together the two kanji, \u706b\u5c71, the word will not be pronounced by their kun'yomi as \"hiyama\", but rather they will be pronounced by their on'yomi as \"kazan\", which the compound word fire+mountain means \"volcano\".\nSino-Japanese parts of speech.\nWhile most Chinese loanwords in Japanese are nouns, they can also be used to make verbs, adjectives, and adverbs as well. While most Japanese verbs are native Japanese words, Chinese loanwords can be made into verbs using the \"-suru\" form. For example, the Chinese loanword \"kinshi\" (kanji: \u7981\u6b62, hiragana:\u304d\u3093\u3057) is a noun that means \"prohibition\" or \"ban\", but if you add \"-suru\" afterwards, as in \"kinshi-suru\" (kanji and hiragana: \u7981\u6b62\u3059\u308b, hiragana only: \u304d\u3093\u3057\u3059\u308b), it becomes a verb that means \"to prohibit\" or \"to ban\". Also, adjectives can be formed from nouns by adding the suffix \"-teki\" (\u7684) to it. For example, while the word \"shikaku\" (kanji: \u8996\u899a, hiragana: \u3057\u304b\u304f) is a noun that means \"vision\" or \"sense of sight\", adding \"-teki\" afterwards makes it into the word \"shikaku-teki\" (kanji:\u8996\u899a\u7684, hiragana: \u3057\u304b\u304f\u3066\u304d) which is an adjective that means \"visual\".\nSino-Japanese vocabulary invented in Japan.\nEven though kanji a Chinese invention, Japanese has also created many Chinese-based words itself that were adopted into Chinese. These words are called \"wasei-kango\" (kanji:\u548c\u88fd\u6f22\u8a9e, hiragana: \u308f\u305b\u3044\u304b\u3093\u3054) which means \"Japanese-made Chinese words\". Many of these words describe things that are uniquely Japanese, such as \"Shint\u014d\" (kanji:\u795e\u9053, hiragana: \u3057\u3093\u3068\u3046), \"d\u014dj\u014d\" (kanji:\u9053\u5834, hiragana:\u3069\u3046\u3058\u3087\u3046), \"Bushid\u014d\" (kanji:\u6b66\u58eb\u9053, hiragana:\u3076\u3057\u3069\u3046), \"matcha\" (kanji:\u62b9\u8336, hiragana:\u307e\u3063\u3061\u3083), and \"seppuku\" (kanji:\u5207\u8179, hiragana:\u305b\u3063\u3077\u304f).\nSince Japan was the first East Asian country to modernize, the Japanese were the first people in East Asia to be exposed to new technologies and fields of study, and therefore the first to develop Chinese-based names for such things, such as telephone (denwa, kanji:\u96fb\u8a71, hiragana: \u3067\u3093\u308f), science (kagaku, kanji:\u79d1\u5b66, hiragana:\u304b\u304c\u304f), and philosophy (tetsugaku, kanji:\u54f2\u5b66, hiragana: \u3066\u3064\u304c\u304f), and each of these terms have been adopted into Chinese as \"di\u00e0nhu\u00e0\", \"k\u0113xu\u00e9\", and \"zh\u00e9xu\u00e9\" in the same order. This phenomenon is called reborrowing."}

Some ventilators can also be used in order give patients anesthesia and can be part of an anesthetic machine.\nHow do they work.\nThere are different types of ventilators which can work differently, but they all help pump air into and out of the lungs using pressure.\nManual resuscitators.\nSome types of ventilators require someone else to make them work by hand and help the patient breathe for a short period of time: they are called manual resuscitators.\nBag-valve masks (BMVs) have an oxygen mask which covers the nose and mouth of the patient, a one-way valve attached between the mask and the bag which filters the moving air and prevents the air to be breathed back into the bag, and an inflatable bag which holds the air in and is squeezed by hand. An operator squeezes the bag which forces air into the patient's lungs, and as the hand releases the bag is the patient breathes out into the outer environment and the bag refills itself with outside air. The bag is squeezed and released by hand repeatedly in order to keep the patient breathing.\nAmnesia bags is another type of manual resuscitator in which the bag does not refill itself with air as the patient is breathing. Instead, the bag is filled with air or gas beforehand and the bag is either squeezed by hand or the patient can inhale the air or gas inside of bath if they can breathe on their own.\nMechanical ventilators.\nMechanical ventilators work by themselves without manual operation and are usually controlled by computers, and can be powered by either electricity connected to a wall outlet or battery, or pneumatics without the use of electricity. The air can be moved in and out of the patient by attaching an oxygen mask on the patient or by connecting the ventilator to a breathing tube inserted into the nostrils, the larynx or the trachea. They are used to help the patient breathe for a long period of time.\nPositive pressure ventilators work by blowing air from the outside or from an oxygen tank or air tank through a pneumatic reservoir which holds and compressing the air, or through a turbine which turns around and forces the air through a mask or breathing tube and into the patient. As the air is forced into the lungs, the patient would later breathe out through a \"patient circuit\" with a one-way valve.\nOn the other hand, a negative pressure ventilator, also known as an \"iron lung\" or a tank respirator, is a chamber which is enclosed around the patient's chest and lowers the pressure inside the chamber around the chest area to a point in which the pressure inside the chamber is less than the pressure outside allowing the patient to breathe in, and then the pressure inside heightens to a point in which the pressure inside the chamber is greater than the pressure outside allowing the patient to breathe out. This process occurs periodically. Negative pressure ventilators are now considered obsolete and instead positive pressure ventilators are used in its place."}

A defibrillator is used to treat certain kinds of heart problems using controlled electric shocks. Almost all heart problems are medical emergencies. For each minute, that such a heart problem is left untreated, the chance of survival drops by about ten percent. Even if they are alerted immediately, emergency teams take some time to arrive. For this reason automated external defibrillator have been placed in locations where they are easily accessible, such as airports, and railway stations.\nIn many cases, using such a defibrillator will alert emergency services. Very often, the defibrillator will guide the person helping through its use. In some countries such as the United Kingdom, regional public ambulance services provide lists for people to show where all the publicly accessible defibrillators are located in their region (East of England Ambulance Services Trust for example). In some open public locations, defibrillators are secured in special cases which need a code to open them (see the example on the right). When you call for an ambulance, you tell the operator the location code on the case, and they give you the code to unlock it to get the defibrillator out.\nStudies where conducted to see the survival rates of cardiac arrest. They showed that when public access defibrillators were used, the patient had a median chance of survival of forty percent. When operated by non-dispatched lay first responders they have the highest likelihood of leading to survival."}

In the first two seasons, there were only three teams, but now, there are thirty-one. Over the time that it has been around the NHL has added and lost teams many times. This is the complete history of organizational changes in the NHL. \nEarly Years.\nThe first four NHL teams were the Montreal Canadiens, Montreal Wanderers, the original Ottawa Senators and the Toronto Arenas, but after only playing four games, the Wanderers arena was burned down. This made them leave the league. \nIn the 1919-20 NHL season, the NHL added its first new team - the Quebec Bulldogs. Also, the Toronto Arenas changed their name to the St. Patricks. In the 1920-21 NHL season, the Quebec Bulldogs moved to Hamilton and became the Tigers. \nTwo new teams joined the league in the 1924-25 NHL season - the Boston Bruins and the Montreal Maroons.\nThe next season, the NHL added another new team - the Pittsburgh Pirates. Also, the Hamilton Tigers moved to New York City and became the New York Americans.\nThe NHL continued to add teams the next season, adding the Chicago Black Hawks, the Detroit Cougars and the New York Rangers. This means the league finished its first season with three teams in 1917, but ended up with more than three times more by the end of their first decade. Also, during this season, the Toronto St. Patricks changed their name to the Maple Leafs. In the 1930-31 NHL season, the Pirates moved to Philadelphia and became the Quakers, while the Detroit Cougars changed their name to the Falcons. \nThe NHL finally lost a team four the first time in fourteen seasons. The Philadelphia Quakers and Ottawa Senators did not play in the 1931-32 NHL season. \nIn the 1932-33 NHL season, the Ottawa Senators rejoined the league and the Detroit Falcons were renamed the Red Wings. In the 1934-35 NHL season, the Ottawa Senators moved to St. Louis and became the Eagles.\nThe NHL lost the Eagles after playing just one season in St. Louis and the league was again an eight-team league for three seasons.\nThe league lost the Montreal Maroons in the 1938-39 NHL season, bringing the number of teams to seven, the same number of teams there were 12 years before. There were seven teams for four seasons. The last season there was this many teams was 1941-42. That year, the New York Americans moved to Brooklyn and left the league the next season.\nOriginal Six.\nWhen the league lost the Brooklyn Americans in 1943, a new era began called the Original Six era. For the next 25 years, there were no organization changes.\nExpansion Years.\nThe 1966-67 NHL season was the last year of the Orginal Six era because in the 1967-68 NHL season, there were 12 teams, or twice as many as there were the year before. The new six teams were the California Seals, the Los Angeles Kings, the Minnesota North Stars, the Philadelphia Flyers, the Pittsburgh Penguins and the St. Louis Blues. During this season, California was renamed the Oakland Seals. \nThe Oakland Seals were then renamed the California Golden Seals for the 1970-71 NHL season. The same year, the league added two new teams - the Buffalo Sabres and the Vancouver Canucks. \nTwo more teams joined the NHL two years later - the New York Islanders and the Atlanta Flames. \nAgain, after two years, two more teams joined the NHL - the Washington Capitals and the Kansas City Scouts. Two years later, the California Golden Seals moved to Cleveland and became the Barons. The Kansas City Scouts moved also to Denver and became the Colorado Rockies. \nIn the 1978-79 NHL season, the members of the Cleveland Barons franchise became part of the Minnesota North Stars. This was the forced time since 1942 that the league lost a team. \nIn 1979, the World Hockey Association (WHA) ended and four teams from the league joined the NHL. They were the Edmonton Oilers, the New England Whalers (who became the Hartford Whalers after joining the league), the Quebec Nordiques and the Winnipeg Jets. At this point, the NHL had three Canadian teams, but with three of the teams coming from the WHA being Canadian, there were then twice as many Canadian teams as before.\nTwenty-one teams.\nIn the 1980-81 NHL season, the Atlanta Flames moved to Calgary Flames. Then, in the 1982-83 NHL season, the Colorado Rockies moved to Newark and became the New Jersey Devils. In the 1986-87 NHL season, the Chicago Black Hawks changed the spelling of their name to Black Hawks.\nFurther Expansion.\nIn 1991, lots of teams were beginning to be added to the NHL. That year, it started with the San Jose Sharks.\nTwo new teams joined the league the next season - the Ottawa Senators and the Tampa Bay Lightning.\nThe next season, another two teams joined the league - the Florida Panthers and the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim. Also, the Minnesota North Stars moved to Dallas Stars and dropped the word \"north\" from their name. In the 1995-96 NHL season, the Quebec Nordiques moved to Denver and became the Colorado Avalanche. The next season, the Winnipeg Jets moved also to Phoenix and became the Coyotes. The season after that, the Hartford Whalers moved to Raleigh and became the Carolina Hurricanes. \nThe Nashville Predators joined the league for the 1998-99 NHL season.\nFor next season, another team joined the league - the Atlanta Thrashers.\nThirty Teams.\nThe NHL added the Columbus Blue Jackets and the Minnesota Wild for the 2000-01 NHL season, bringing the number of teams to thirty. This was the number of teams there were for 17 seasons. The Mighty Ducks of Anaheim changed their name to the Anaheim Ducks in the 2006-07 NHL season. Then, the Atlanta Thrashers moved to Winnipeg to become the Jets in the 2011-12 NHL season. Finally, the Phoenix Coyotes changed their name to the Arizona Coyotes in the 2014-15 NHL season.\nModern Expansion.\nIn the 2017-18 NHL season, the Vegas Golden Knights joined the league. The Seattle Kraken will join the league in the 2021\u201322 season."}
{"id": "601374", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=601374", "title": "Kingdom of France", "text": "The Kingdom of France (; ; ) is the name given to various political entities of France in the Middle Ages and modern times. According to historians, three major events started the Kingdom of France: the advent of Clovis I in 481, the Treaty of Verdun and the election of Hugues Capet in 987. The kingdom lasted until 1792 and was briefly restored in 1814 to 1815 and then from 1815 to 1848.\nThe King of the Franks, Clovis I, sealed the alliance of Frankish Kingdoms with the Catholic Church at his baptism. That alliance was perpetuated in the Kingdom of France by the crowning of kings at Reims, which made them monarchs by divine right. The first Capetians were anxious to crown their eldest son in their lifetime because their authority was limited in reality to the Ile de France. It was not until Philippe Auguste that their official acts called it the Kingdom of France and that they are able to make a real act of authority throughout the kingdom. Their territory was the feudal fiefs of which king of Western France had been the suzerain since the 843 division of the Carolingian Empire.\nThe gradual integration of the feudal fiefs into the royal domain required the establishment of a royal administration. Louis IX attached the main importance to its role as justiciary. The \"parlement\", the high court of justice, was put in place. The Hundred Years' War allowed Charles VII to establish an army and permanent taxes. Richelieu and Louis XIV strengthened the royal authority in the provinces by bringing the local governors of the nobility under their stewardship and by delegating to them stewards appointed by the king.\nThe tendency of royalty to exercise more and more absolute power could be challenged in times of turmoil, civil wars and the reigns of minor kings. The dispute took a more pronounced character on the occasion of the diffusion of the philosophy of enlightenment and of the values that it carried: government of reason, separation of powers, individual liberties. The French Revolution led to the establishment of a French constitutional monarchy. However, the different formulas experienced failure in 1792, 1830 and 1848, which ended the French monarchy."}

Anecdotally CBD is being used with claimed positive results by patients for almost every illness.\nLegal.\nCBD, unlike \u03949-THC (Tetrahydrocannabinol), is a non psycho-active compound of cannabis. Its use and popularity as an alternative to pharmaceutical drugs is growing worldwide despite difficulties, ambiguities and, in some cases, contradictory legal status in some states and countries.\nIn the USA the consumption of CBD hemp oil is federally legal, since CBD hemp oil falls under the same importation and commerce laws as other hemp products. Some US states have not enacted legislation specifically relating to CBD hemp oil and continue to use high THC cannabis laws to govern the status of CBD. At the same time many states have legislated to legalize or decriminalize cannabis.\nMost states have detailed information relating to the legal status of recreational cannabis, CBD, and what is increasingly referred to as 'medicinal cannabis'. up-to-date state specific info can be seen at Legal history of cannabis in the United States (in Notes).\nIn 1939 Irishman William Brooke O'Shaughnessy introduced cannabis extract to American pharmacies and thus began it's popularity as a remedy. A wide range of cannabis extracts became freely available and could be gotten from travelling doctors, 'snake oil salesmen', and apothecaries across America and Europe.\nThe general lack of controls and regulation at the time lead to some deaths and injuries linked back to supposed cannabis extracts. Unscrupulous makers produced formulations that were of questionable quality for quick profits and some cases the ingredients were toxic or poisonous. This unfortunate practice was widespread across the profitable field of medicine and remedies.\nAs result, in 1906, The Pure Food and Drug Act was passed by the United States Congress. It required that certain special drugs, including cannabis extracts, be properly and correctly labeled with contents. Prior to this many drugs were marketed as 'patented' medicines with 'secret ingredients'. The new regulations, however, did nothing to stem criticism about the availability of narcotics in particular and around 1910 there was a new round of legislation aimed to strengthen requirements for their sale and remove 'loopholes' in poison laws.\nThe 1910 revisions were designed to restrict all narcotics, including cannabis, as poisons therefore requiring a doctors prescription and limiting sales to pharmacies only. The first instance of the 1906 Act was enacted by the District of Columbia in the same year as 'An act to regulate the practice of pharmacy and the sale of poisons in the District of Columbia, and for other purposes'. The act was again updated in 1938 to the Federal Pure Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act of 1938 which is still current as of the early 21st century. To date, marijuana remains under this law defined as a \"dangerous drug\".\nCBD as a separate substance or as an ingredient of other products is legal across the USA since it is a hemp extract however when purchasing people should check their specific local and national laws.\nHistory.\nEvidence suggests that hemp and cannabis may have been farmed for up to 12,000 years and had many uses including the making of cloth, rope, paper, food, and medicine. However in the modern context, it was not until its introduction to American pharmacies by William Brooke O'Shaughnessy in 1839 that Cannabis extracts came into mainstream awareness as a medicine. A wide range of cannabis extracts became easily available and could be gotten from travelling doctors and salesmen, doctors, and drugstores throughout America. This ended the introduction of the Pure Food and Drug Act.\u00a0Similar products were also available across Europe.\nUses of CBD.\nIn the early decades of the 21st century, CBD is again becoming well-known for its qualities as a remedy for health problems. Its world-wide popularity is ahead of the slow process of making it legal to produce, supply, buy, and use cannabis for enjoyment in non-medical settings, and especially when it comes to CBD, which doesn't have a psycho-active component.\nThere is some experience that CBD has a positive effect in managing and treating chronic pain, PTSD, anxiety, anxiety disorder, depression, diabetes type 1, diabetes type 2, seizures, and also combined with allopathic approaches to diseases including chemotherapy and radiation therapy for treating cancer. No toxic dose for CBD is known, and there is no record from any source of a death or serious injury from CBD as of this writing.\nCBD may be useful either as as treatment for a specific illness or in a smaller dose for maintenance of good health. Usually, CBD is taken by mouth as oil drops or a powder that dissolves in water, or made into a food to be eaten. Another form of CBD is used on the skin as the oil or a cream to rub in. CBD is popularly taken in the 'vape' method (from the word \"vapor\"), with the CBD is heated so it can be inhaled. This method is favoured because the effect is felt sooner than by other means. Patients who need long-lasting relief from pain or other symptoms such as nausea, may combine two methods: for example, first vape and then eat a food made with CBD."}

He was the emperor of China from 1402 to 1424. He is important because he moved China's capital to Beijing, built its Forbidden City, and sent Zheng He on trips to Indonesia, India, Arabia, and eastern Africa.\nNames.\nThe Yongle Emperor's real name was . It is written in Chinese writing. His given name was Di and his family were the Zhus, but Chinese people write their family names first. His name means \"Japanese cherry\", but in Chinese that bush or tree isn't thought of as Japanese.\nIn old China, the Chinese emperors did not number their years from one place. Instead, they gave names to eras (groups of years) any time they wanted. Some emperors made 10 or more eras while they led China. Zhu Di started his era the year after he took Yingtian (now Nanjing) from his nephew the Jianwen Emperor in 1402. He said this was the 1st year of the \"Era of Eternal Happiness\", which sounds like \"Y\u01d2ngl\u00e8\" and is written in traditional Chinese writing and in the easier writing now used by the PRC. He only had this one era when he was emperor, so people also called him the \"Emperor of the Yongle Era\" or \"Y\u01d2ngl\u00e8d\u00ec\" ( or ).\nWhen he was the emperor of China, Chinese people just called him the \"Emperor\". If they met him, they used very polite terms like \"B\u00ecxi\u00e0\" (, \"Your Highness\") to speak to him. After he died, the next emperors gave him a new, long, and very polite name and called him \"M\u00edng Ch\u00e9ngz\u01d4\" (), the \"Most Successful Dead Family Member\" of the Ming. After the Xinhai and Communist changes in government of China, people are less polite when they talk about the old emperors. They usually just call him by his everyday name Zhu Di like a common person. In English, it's more common to talk about him as the Yongle Emperor.\nLife.\nZhu Di was born on May 2, 1360, during the Yuan part of China's history. His father Zhu Yuanzhang was a successful leader of the Red Turbans fighting the Yuan army to change China. People don't agree about who his mother was. In the histories written by the later Chinese governments, his mother was the Empress Ma, his father's most important wife. Other people\u2014especially people who did not like Zhu Di\u2014said that his mother was one of Zhu Yuanzhang's live-in girlfriends and wasn't even Chinese. They said that he changed all the papers about his real mother after he got more power.\nZhu Yuanzhang won his fight with the Yuan and became the Hongwu Emperor of China in 1368. He called his new government the Ming. The Ming had rules about who should be the new emperor when the old emperor died. Zhu Biao () was Zhu Yuanzhang's oldest son and people thought he would be the next emperor. Zhu Di was only the 4th son, so people did not think he would become the next emperor. He was still very important, though. The Hongwu Emperor made him the leader of Beiping (today's Beijing and the area around it).\nZhu Biao died before the Hongwu Emperor. When the emperor died, the Ming's rules said that Zhu Biao's son Zhu Yunwen () should be the new leader. He became the Jianwen Emperor in 1398 at the age of 22.\nThe Jianwen Emperor's many uncles were very powerful, almost like kings. He started to take away their power right away. One was sent away to Yunnan, one killed himself, three were made into common people. Zhu Di was afraid and pretended to be crazy. The Jianwen Emperor was less afraid of him and even let Zhu Di's three sons\u2014whom he held in Yingtian (now Nanjing) to be sure of Zhu Di's good behavior\u2014go to Beiping (now Beijing) to visit their \"sick\" father before his death. \nWith his sons free, Zhu Di began to fight the Jianwen Emperor. At first, he said that he really wanted to protect his nephew from the \"bad helpers\" who were telling the emperor to fight his own family. After he took the capital, though, he rewrote all the government papers to pretend the Jianwen Emperor had never been the emperor. The four years of his nephew's control were dated to the end of the Hongwu Emperor's era. Zhu Di began his new era at the next Chinese New Year and became the Yongle Emperor.\nMany people in the government of China said they did not like the Yongle Emperor and that he should not be the country's leader. A body was shown and said to be the Jianwen Emperor's, but it was badly burnt and no one could be sure it was really him. Some people said that the Jianwen Emperor was still alive and that he was hiding as a Buddhist monk. All of this made the Yongle Emperor very worried and angry. He did not stay in Yingtian or make it his capital. He left some of the government there but moved most of it to his home in Beiping. Because China now had a more important northern capital and a secondary southern capital, these two cities came to be known as Beijing and Nanjing. The Yongle Emperor's new, larger home in Beijing grew into the Forbidden City. The Yongle Emperor killed many of the angry government leaders in Nanjing. Sometimes he killed their families. Sometimes he killed their families, friends, and students. \nMany of these troublemakers were the people who took power because of their high scores on the imperial examination. The Yongle Emperor gave more power in his government to his eunuchs, men who had been hurt as children to stop them from being able to have children of their own. One of these men was Zheng He, an Islamic leader who led great treasure ships south from Suzhou and Nanjing in 7 big trips between 1405 and 1433. The first trips may have been looking for the Jianwen Emperor, but they also became trips that taught China about the South China Sea and Indian Ocean and opened up more buying and selling between their countries and China.\nThe Yongle Emperor died on August 12, 1424, and was followed as emperor by his oldest son Zhu Gaochi, who became the Hongxi Emperor."}

This weasel rests in rock crevices, tree trunks, and abandoned burrows of other animals or the animals it previously hunted. The home range size of this animal is currently unknown.\nGeographical distribution for this species lies in parts of Asia from Kazakhstan, Tibet, and the Himalayas to Mongolia, northeastern China, southern Siberia, Korea, and also some parts of Russia. The most common area for this species, however, is Ladakh, India.\nReproduction.\nOverall, these animals are thought to be live by themselves except when mating. The mountain weasel breeds once a year. Males fight for the females. The mountain weasel usually mate in February to March, and the young are usually born in May. The gestation period is 30\u201349 days. The mountain weasel gives birth to one to eight young ones. The young ones are blind, and their fur is not well developed. Lactation lasts about two months. After weaning, the young become independent but they still live with their brothers and sisters until fall. Young are able to breed in the next season when they are just under a year old.\nBehavior.\nThe mountain weasel is able to climb, run, and swim. Their long bodies and short legs allow them to be very agile. Mountain weasels are generally nocturnal, but may hunt during the day. Even though they live by themselves, they communicate with each other visually and sound. This animal has very good eye sight. They also communicate by sound to warn off predators, to protect their territories, and when mating. When scared, they make a loud chirring sound and excrete a very smelly odor.\nFeeding.\nMountain weasels are carnivores. They mainly feed on pikas and voles. They have an important ecological role in controlling the population of the voles. Muskrats, rabbits, ground squirrels, small birds, lizards, frogs, fish, and insects are also eaten.\nThreats.\nSome of the threats that makes the weasel to be near-threatened include habitat change, mainly caused by human development. Other dangers, such as traffic on roads, can reduce their population. Overgrazing by cattle, goats, and sheep causes the prey of the weasel to decrease because their hiding spots and food are reduced.\nConservation status.\nThe conservation status, according to the IUCN, is \"near threatened\" because it is considered to be in a significant decline. It requires monitoring mainly because of habitat and resource loss."}

Some countries, such as the United States, have a legal definition of \"next of kin\". In other countries, such as the United Kingdom, \"next of kin\" may have no legal definition and may not necessarily refer to blood relatives at all.\nIn some legal systems, rights regarding\u00a0inheritance\u00a0(which imply a decision-making capacity such as in a medical emergency in which no clear will or instructions have been given, and the person has no spouse) flow to the closest relative (regardless of the age, with a representative appointed if a minor), usually a child, a parent or a sibling. However, there are people without any close adult relatives and, in such a case, decision-making power often flows to a niece or nephew, first cousin, aunt or uncle, or grandparent.\nFor example, if a person dies\u00a0intestate, the laws of some jurisdictions require distribution of the estate to the deceased's spouse or children. However, if there are none of them, the estate can often be distributed to the next closest group of living relatives, whether they are parents, grandparents, first cousins, aunts and uncles, or second cousins in extreme cases. If a person dies intestate with no identifiable next of kin, the person's estate generally\u00a0escheats\u00a0(i.e., legally reverts) to the government.\nIn cases of medical emergency, if a person is incapable (because of age or mental infirmity, or they are unconscious) of making decisions for themselves and they have no spouse or children, the next of kin may participate in medical decisions made by medical personnel, subject to the specific laws of the jurisdiction.\nThe inability of persons who are not in a legal marriage to make decisions with respect to the care of a live-in partner has resulted in many jurisdictions giving live-in partners rights equivalent to a spouse in such situations, even though most jurisdictions still do not require non-spouses to be made beneficiaries of estates (it is improper in most jurisdictions to\u00a0disinherit\u00a0a spouse). The inability of same-sex partners to have rights with respect to a partner's medical care or\u00a0funeral\u00a0arrangements over and above those of the next-of-kin is one of the main reasons behind litigation to require\u00a0same-sex marriage\u00a0or its equivalent.\nFor the purposes of next of kin, adopted children are treated as blood relatives.

The party nominated James B. Weaver as their presidential candidate for the 1892 election, and he would later receive 8.5% of the popular vote and win 5 states. In the 1896 presidential election, the party nominated Democratic nominee William Jennings Bryan, who supported many of the Populist ideas. To separate themselves from the Democrats, they nominated Thomas E. Watson as their vice-presidential candidate, instead of Democrat pick Arthur Sewall. During this election, the populist party slowly began to merge into the Democratic party. Bryan would later lose the presidency to Republican William McKinley. Although the Populist party nominated candidates in the next three presidential elections, their support heavily dropped as many began to support the Democrats or Republicans, or follow Eugene V. Debs to his new Socialist Party.\nThe party also had success in the House of Representatives elections. In 1890 they won 8 seats, in 1892 they won 11 seats, in 1894 they won 9 seats, in 1896 they won 22 seats, in 1898 they won 6 seats and finally, in 1900 they won 5 seats.\nThe party disbanded in 1908. The last known activity of the official Populist party was in 1913."}
