Ball was later killed after King Richard II after the Peasants Revolt was put to an end by the king.\nEarly life.\nJohn Ball was the child of Joan and William Ball, in Peledon near Colchester. He was born in 1331. Ball was trained in York, and moved a lot over the country, living in Norwich, Colchester, and Kent. \nBall was later imprisoned in Maidstone, Kent for his contradictory views on Christianity. He was then released, but continued to preach his radical ideas. This caused Ball to be released and imprisoned many a time. This cycle came to an end however, in 1381 when John was released from prison by former ex-soldier and leader of the Peasants revolt, Wat Tyler. This was a real turnaround for Ball, Tyler needed Ball to preach to the local Peasants, asking them to discontinue performing Work Service.\nLinks with the Peasants revolt.\nNow in Tyler's Peasant army, Ball began to march to London. There, London's gates were mysteriously opened and Tyler's army flooded in to the capital city. King Richard II, not wanting any trouble, decided to meet the Peasants at Mile End. There, the two forces began talks, surprisingly the King agreed to abolish Work Service, and accepted the other demands the army asked for. meanwhile, a rogue group of Peasants began to lay siege to the Tower of London, killing the Archbishop of Canterbury and many others. \nKnowing another talk would have to be held,John and Tyler decided to meet the king outside the city walls, there the Kings army murdered Tyler and forced the Peasants to flee. None of the Peasants demands were met and Ball, (along with many other rebels) was executed."}

{"id": "754809", "revid": "1099091", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=754809", "title": "Province of New Jersey", "text": "The first people to live on the land now known as New Jersey were the Delaware Indians. They lived here starting at least 10,000 years ago. Anywhere from 8,000 to 20,000 Delaware Indians lived in the area when the first Europeans arrived. Their name means \"original people\" or \"genuine people.\" They spoke an Algonquian dialect.\nThough they were considered one tribe, the Delaware Indians didn't act as one unified group. Instead, they lived in small communities made up mostly of extended family members. The men would hunt or fish during the day. Depending on the season they might search for clams off the Jersey shore or hunt in the woods. The women worked in the gardens. They grew squash, beans, sweet potatoes, and corn.\nWhen the first explorers came, the Delaware Indians lived in parts of Delaware, New Jersey, and eastern Pennsylvania. Europeans called them the Delaware Indians.\nColonial Times.\nAround 1524, Giovanni de Verrazano became the first European to explore New Jersey. He sailed along the coast and anchored off Sandy Hook. The colonial history of New Jersey started after Henry Hudson sailed through Newark Bay in 1609. Although Hudson was British, he worked for the Netherlands, so he claimed the land for the Dutch. It was called New Netherlands.\nSmall trading colonies sprang up where the present towns of Hoboken and Jersey City are located. The Dutch, Swedes, and Finns were the first European settlers in New Jersey. Bergen, founded in 1660, was New Jersey's first permanent European settlement.\nIn 1664 the Dutch lost New Netherlands when the British took control of the land and added it to their colonies. They divided the land in half and gave control to two proprietors: Sir George Carteret (who was in charge of the east side) and Lord John Berkley (who was in charge of the west side). The land was officially named New Jersey after the Isle of Jersey in the English Channel. Carteret had been governor of the Isle of Jersey.\nBerkeley and Carteret sold the land at low prices and allowed the settlers to have political and religious freedom. As a result, New Jersey was more ethnically diverse than many other colonies. Primarily a rural society, the colony grew to have about 100,000 people.\nEventually, governing power was transferred back to England. For many years, New Jersey shared a royal governor with New York. The governorship was finally split in 1738 when New Jersey got its own governor, Lewis Morris.\nRevolution.\nIn the years before the Revolution, anti-British feelings spread throughout the state. About one-third of the people living here supported the rebels, one-third supported England, and one-third remained neutral. In 1776 New Jersey declared itself an independent state and joined the colonial side in the Revolutionary War.\nNew Jersey was an important state during the Revolutionary War because of its location near the center of the thirteen colonies and between New York City and Philadelphia. Because of this, more battles were fought in New Jersey than in any other state. The Americans and British fought 100 battles, both large and small, here.\nMany people consider the Battle of Trenton to be the turning point of the Revolution. Immediately after winning Trenton, General George Washington won the battle of Princeton. Having lost two battles in a matter of hours, the British fled New Jersey for New York. Washington and his troops spent the rest of the winter in Morristown, and the United States was well on its way to victory.\nBattle of Trenton.\nIn November of 1776 the British gained control of New Jersey and forced Washington to flee into Pennsylvania. They thought no one would fight during winter, so the British and Hessian soldiers in New Jersey divided into camps to stay until spring. Trenton was considered the most desirable post, and it went to the Hessian soldiers as a reward for their good service. The Hessians used the Old Barracks in Trenton as a headquarters.\nThe British didn't chase Washington across the Delaware River because it was full of blocks of ice that made it dangerous to cross. The Hessians didn't patrol along the river because they thought Washington could not cross back. But in December, Washington and his men decided to cross. Washington's men had to push away blocks of ice from the boat's path while paddling hard to fight the strong current.\nOnce across, Washington decided to separate and surprise the Hessians in Trenton from two sides. The plan worked, and the patriots captured 900 prisoners while only four American soldiers were wounded.\nEarly Statehood.\nIn 1787, New Jersey became the third state to ratify the U.S. Constitution and the first state to sign the Bill of Rights. In 1790, Trenton officially became the state capital of New Jersey. William Livingston became New Jersey's first state governor.\nNew Jersey grew and prospered during the early 1800s. New factories sprung up throughout the state. Paterson became a textile center and later became known for producing trains and silk. Trenton produced clay products, iron, and steel. Camden, Elizabeth, Jersey City, Newark, and Passaic all became major manufacturing centers in the 1800s.\nNew canals and railroads helped industry grow. Europeans came by the thousands to New Jersey to work in the factories.\nSouth Jersey remained rural for the most part, growing the crops to feed the urban areas nearby. Railroads were important in helping the South Jersey seashore areas expand. In 1850, New Jersey's population of nearly half a million and the industries in which most of those people worked were concentrated in the north.\nDuring the Civil War, New Jersey provided 31 regiments (groups of soldiers), including cavalry (soldiers on horseback) and infantry (soldiers on foot). Over 25,000 New Jersey men fought for the Union, and New Jersey soldiers participated in almost every major Eastern battle.\nIndustry, Immigrants and Innovation.\nAfter the Civil War, the industrial revolution was under way, and New Jersey continued to grow. More factories opened, and cities like Trenton, Newark, Paterson, and Camden got bigger as immigrants from Europe came to work in them. Railroads were laid to connect the cities and to transport materials.\nAt first, most immigrants came from Ireland and Germany. Later, people came from Italy and from countries throughout Eastern Europe. In 1910 half the state's population was born or had parents who were born outside the United States. As city populations grew, farm populations shrank.\nWith so many people working in factories, issues like child labor and protection for workers became important. The popularity of these reforms brought Woodrow Wilson to power as governor in 1910. He left office in 1913 to become President of the United States and is the only New Jersey governor to become president. As both governor and president Wilson supported welfare reforms to protect workers and to keep companies from becoming too big.\nThe state's economic expansion had a lot to do with the genius of its inventors. Thomas Edison is probably most famous. Among his thousands of inventions, including the light bulb, Edison helped develop the motion picture while working in New Jersey. Fort Lee became the motion picture capital of the world in the early 1900s. There, Fatty Arbuckle, Mary Pickford, Pearl White, and other stars revolutionized entertainment with their movies.\nThe 1900s.\nBetween 1900 and 1930, New Jersey's population more than doubled, and manufacturing became a $4 billion industry. Unfortunately, the Great Depression of the 1930s hit New Jersey hard, bringing massive unemployment. The state rebounded during World War II in the 1940s as New Jersey's electronics and chemical industries began large-scale operations.\nIn the mid-1900s, people began moving back into the rural areas from the overcrowded cities. A number of transportation projects helped better connect New Jersey. The New Jersey Turnpike and the Garden State Parkway opened in the 1950s.\nThe history of air travel has close ties to New Jersey. On May 3, 1919, the first passenger flight in American history was flown from New York to Atlantic City. Today, New Jersey is home to two international airports, Newark and Atlantic City. Newark Airport expanded its passenger and cargo services in 1963. In the 1980s, it became one of the world's busiest airports.\nToday New Jersey is recognized for its present as well as its past. While remembering its proud history, New Jersey will continue to be the setting for many of the great events of the future."}

However, it is different from the Thai script because it has fewer consonants and the characters are much curvier than Thai, which are more angular.

The script is an abugida. It was the writing system that Thai and Lao are based on. However, Thai and Lao added tone markers to better suit their own languages, since Thai and Lao are tonal, while Khmer is not. \nOne key feature that Khmer has, while Thai and Lao do not, is that consonant letters have subscript forms. Subscript forms are forms of consonant letters that are written underneath other letters. Similar to how different letters in the Latin alphabet have capital or lowercase forms that look different from each other, consonants in Khmer have standard and subscript forms. These are used to write consonant strings. For example, in the word Khmer (\u1781\u17d2\u1798\u17c2\u179a), the \"kh + m\" consonant string is written as \u1781\u17d2\u1798. By themselves, the consonants that make up the \"kh + m\" cluster would be written as \u1781 and \u1798, but since the \"m\" consonant is the second part of a consonant string, it is written differently under the first consonant in the cluster \u1781. So \u17d2\u1798 is the subscript form of \u1798."}

Debussy composed it in 1901. Three movements are part of the suite, a pr\u00e9lude, a sarabande and a toccata. Ricardo Vi\u00f1es first played it at the Salle \u00c9rard on 11 January 1902. Maurice Ravel created a version for orchestra of the middle movement.\nThe suite is regarded as Debussy's first mature piano composition. There are many recordings.\nHistory.\nClaude Debussy composed the three pieces in the suite at different times. The second movement, a sarabande, was composed in the winter of 1894. At that time it was part of the series of \"Images oubli\u00e9es\" (forgotten images). It is dedicated to Yvonne Lerolle, the daughter of Henry Lerolle. Debussy composed did not compose much piano music during the 1890s and focused on opera and orchestral music. He finished the suite in 1901, revising Sarabande. He also dedicated the revised version of Sarabande, as well as the third movement, Toccata, to Yvonne Lerolle, now Mme E. Rouart. The suite was published in 1901 by Eug\u00e8ne Fromont. It was premiered on 11 January 1902 at the Salle \u00c9rard in Paris for the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale de Musique. Ricardo Vi\u00f1es was the pianist, who knew about the suite from his friend Maurice Ravel.\n\"Pour le piano\" was a very important change in Debussy's creative development, who now switched to making piano music.\nOn the 100th anniversary of Debussy's death, B\u00e4renreiter published a critical edition of some of his piano music in 2018, including \"Pour le piano\". The publisher said that the \"improvisational and fugitive\" parts of Debussy's compositions were \"governed by a precisely calibrated formal design\" that left \"little room for chance\".\nStructure and music.\n\"Pour le piano\" has been regarded as Debussy's first mature piano work. The suite consists of three movements:\nThe first movement, called Pr\u00e9lude, is marked \"Assez anim\u00e9 et tr\u00e8s rythm\u00e9\" (With spirit and very rhythmically). It was dedicated to Debussy's student Mlle Worms de Romilly, who notes that the movement \"tellingly evokes the gongs and music of Java\". The pianist Angela Hewitt notes that Pr\u00e9lude begins with a theme in the bass, followed by a long pedal point passage. The theme is repeated in chords marked fortissimo, together with glissando runs that Debussy connected to \"d\u2019Artagnan drawing his sword\". In a middle section, the left hand holds a pedal point in A-flat major, to which the right hand adds colours. The conclusion is marked \"Tempo di cadenza\", again with glissando-figures.\nSarabande is marked \"Avec une \u00e9l\u00e9gance grave et lente\" (With a slow and solemn elegance). Debussy said it should be \"rather like an old portrait in the Louvre\". \u00c9mile Vuillermoz described Debussy's playing of the movement as \"with the easy simplicity of a good dancer from the sixteenth century\". Hewitt calls it \"antique and modern at the same time\". The movement has been regarded as \"among the most intimate music for the keyboard\", showing an affinity to Erik Satie such as his 1887 three dances called \"Sarabandes\".\nThe last movement is a toccata, marked \"Vif\" (Lively). It has been described as \"poised and energetic, extroverted and graceful\" and shows influences from Scarlatti's sonatas. Hewitt notes about the virtuoso writing that speed alone wasn't Debussy's goal, but rather clarity.\nA reviewer described the suite as \"possibly foreshadowing the neo-classical Debussy that emerged in his last years\"."}

Like all vaccines, mRNA vaccines increase the body's immunity so the patient is less likely to catch an infectious disease.\nHow mRNA vaccines work.\nAlmost all cells make and use their own mRNA. They use it to make proteins. Each mRNA is like a blueprint or recipe for one kind of protein.\nMost vaccines work by taking something from a harmful germ and putting it inside the patient's body without any parts of the germ that cause harm. Then the patient's own cells learn to identify the germ using its other parts. Then, if a living germ ever attacks the body, the patient's cells fight it off without having to learn what it is first. Some vaccines do this by putting a dead, weak germ inside the patient's body. Other vaccines do this by putting lots of proteins that the germ makes inside the body but not any germs themselves. mRNA vaccines work by putting mRNA inside the body instead of protein. Then the body uses the mRNA to make protein itself.\nmRNA vaccines can be injected into the skin or muscle with a needle. Some mRNA vaccines can be inhaled into the patient's nose. Anti-cancer mRNA vaccines can be injected into the tumor.\nSafety.\nScientists think mRNA vaccines are safer than other vaccines because it is easy to make only the mRNA that makes the germ's proteins and easy to leave out the part of the mRNA that makes the harmful parts of the germ. This way, the mRNA does not make whole germs inside the body. Some proteins can be harmful to the body, but mRNA itself is not.\nInvention.\nThe first mRNA vaccine was used in mice around 1990 but it was a long time before large numbers of scientists started to work making mRNA vaccines.\nThe first mRNA vaccines used on people were made to work against cancer in the late 1990s. Doctors found out which proteins only tumor cells make and used mRNA for those proteins as a vaccine so the patient's own immune systems would kill some of the tumor cells."}

Astarte, goddess of war and sexual love, shared so many qualities with her sister, Anath, that they may originally have been seen as a single deity. Their names together are the basis for the Aramaic goddess Atargatis.\nAstarte was a great goddess of the ancient Middle East and chief deity of Tyre, Sidon, and Elat, important Mediterranean seaports. Hebrew scholars now feel that the goddess Ashtoreth mentioned so often in the Bible is a deliberate conflation of the Greek name Astarte and the Hebrew word \"boshet\", \u201cshame,\u201d indicating the Hebrews\u2019 contempt for her cult. Ashtaroth, the plural form of the goddess\u2019s name in Hebrew, became a general term denoting goddesses and paganism.\nAstarte was worshiped in Egypt and Ugarit and among the Hittites, as well as in Canaan. Her Akkadian counterpart was Ishtar. Later she became assimilated with the Egyptian deities Isis and Hathor (a goddess of the sky and of women), and in the Greco-Roman world with Aphrodite, Artemis, and Juno.\nAstarte is a Semitic queen, and sister of Isis."}

This happened after His resurrection. Jesus told his Twelve Apostles to go all over the world and tell everyone about Him. The most well known version of the Great Commission is in Matthew 28:16 to 20. Jesus meets his followers on a mountain in Galilee. He tells them to make disciples of and baptize everyone in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.\nEarlier Jesus had sent out 70 of his followers to preach and heal, but only to the Jews. However, Jesus himself had healed some non-Jewish people before. At the beginning of his public work, Jesus spoke to His own people. After rising from the dead, he made it clear that His message was for everyone. This \"commission\" is very important to missionaries who believe that God wants them to go to every country in the world and preach about Jesus."}

Followers of those religions say, that Jesus did those things by the power of God.\nThe Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke record many of these stories. The most common ones are healing people who are sick, blind, lame or deaf. In many cases, the sicknesses or other problems are said to be caused by demons. Jesus said, that he had power over the demons, and so He could stop their evil work. The enemies of Jesus told him to do miracles to show, that He had supernatural power, but He refused. However, for his followers, he did several miracles that showed His power. These included stopping a storm in the sea, walking on water and making a tree die.\nIn Islam, Jesus is said to have spoken from his cradle, made a clay bird come alive, and brought down from heaven a table full of food. Both the Qur'an and the Christian New Testament say, that Jesus brought some dead people back to life.\nIn the Gospel of John, only seven miracles are mentioned. John calls them \"signs\". Their purpose was to teach something about the power of Jesus, not just to help people. Two of the greatest miracles recorded are the Virgin birth of Jesus and the resurrection. The Qur'an also mentions the Virgin birth, but not the resurrection.\nThroughout history, many Christians have said that they have been healed by Jesus. Roman Catholic believers have many such stories. Some places, such as Lourdes, are places where sick people go to be healed by Jesus. Other Christians say that Jesus has healed them or done other miracles at large Christian meetings. Other Christians think that Jesus only did such things when he was on Earth. They do not believe that such miracles happen today."}

The structure that is pushed by the wind is usually called tumbleweed. This structure will detatch from its root or stem and will roll on the ground. In most such species, the tumbleweed consists of the whole plant apart from the root system. Sometimes, only a hollow fruit or inflorescence detaches. Tumbleweed species occur most commonly in steppe and arid ecosystems, where frequent wind and the open environment permit rolling easly.\nMost tissues of the tumbleweed structure are dead. This needs to be the case, because the structure needs to degrade and fall apart so that its seeds or spores can escape during the tumbling. Sometimes they germinate after the tumbleweed has come to rest in a wet location. In this case, many species of tumbleweed open mechanically, releasing their seeds as they swell when they absorb water.\nThe tumbleweed diaspore disperses seeds. This stategy is not limited to the seed plants; some species of spore-bearing cryptogams\u2014such as \"Selaginella\"\u2014form tumbleweeds, and some fungi that resemble puffballs dry out, break free of their attachments and are similarly tumbled by the wind, dispersing spores as they go."}

His trial is told with many details. Jesus was with his disciples in a garden where He was praying. After dark, some soldiers came. With them was Judas Iscariot. Judas kissed Jesus to show the soldiers who He was. The soldiers took Jesus prisoner. All of the other followers of Jesus ran away.\nJesus was taken to the high priest where he was questioned. He was accused of many things by false witnesses. Finally, the high priest asked Jesus if he was the Son of God. Jesus said it was true and that in the future he would come in the clouds. The high priest then said that Jesus was guilty of blasphemy.\nSince the Romans did not allow the Jewish authorities to kill anyone, Jesus was then brought to Pontius Pilate. Pilate was the Roman governor. He also asked Jesus many questions. Jesus didn't answer some of the questions, but he told Pilate that he was a king. But he said that his kingdom was \"not of this world\". Pilate wanted to release Jesus, but the crowd demanded instead that Jesus be crucified. To prevent a riot, Pilate agreed to their demand.\nOther.\nScholars note that the reader receives an almost hour-by-hour account of what is happening."}

Uenuku simply means 'rainbow'.\nUenuku is special to the Ng\u0101puhi, Ng\u0101ti Kahungunu, Ng\u0101ti Porou, Ng\u0101i Tahu, and Ng\u0101i T\u016bhoe M\u0101ori tribes. He is also known to two groups of tribes called Kurahaup\u014d and Tainui. The Te Arawa group of tribes also know of him. Some of these tribes may also say he is a god of war.\nGeoff Murphy made his first movie in 1974, which was based on Uenuku's story. It was the first TV drama to be entirely spoken in the M\u0101ori language.\nChief of Hawaiki.\nThe tribes of Ng\u0101ti Porou, Ng\u0101i Tahu, and probably Ng\u0101ti Kahungunu say Chief Uenuku of Hawaiki was their ancestor. He was the father of about 70 sons. His eldest son Ruatapu killed Hawaiki's nobility when he was shamed for trying to use a sacred comb.\nIn Te Arawa stories, Tamatekapua and his brother Whakaturia stole fruit from Chief Uenuku of Hawaiki.\nIn the Cook Islands, Uanuku Rakeiora is said to be an important chiefly ancestor from Raiatea Island in French Polynesia over 27 generations ago, who was descended from Iro-nui-ma-Oata.\nUenuku's wife.\nIn the stories mostly known to Ng\u0101i T\u016bhoe, but which also belong to Ng\u0101puhi and Ng\u0101ti Kahungunu of Wairoa, Uenuku was once human. One early morning he went out hunting. In a clearing he found two women. One was named Hine-p\u016bkohu-rangi (sometimes called Tairi-a-kohu). The other was her sister, named Hine-wai. He asked Hine-p\u016bkohu-rangi to stay and talk with him, and to return the next night. Since she lived in the sky, she had to leave him at dawn when her sister Hine-wai called her. She kept coming back night after night, and they fell in love. Eventually, she agreed to marry him so long as he promised that he tell no one about her.\nThey were happy for many months, though she still only came to him at night and left at dawn. In time she became pregnant. No one else could see her, though, and therefore he was mocked by the people around him. They grew suspicious of this wife they had never seen, and the daughter who in some tellings was already born. He tried to tell them that his wife left him each morning at first light, so they suggested that he should block up the doors and windows so she could not see the sun. Finally after more mockery, he was convinced to block the the sunlight after she came to him, so that she could not see the sun in the morning, then he could prove she existed. That night, Uenuku blocked all the places in his house that would shine the daylight. In the morning, she felt betrayed when she realised he had tricked her. She went back to the sky and left him for as long as he lived.\nUenuku wandered the world searching for his wife. He searched until he was old and frail. Rangi the sky father noticed this and took pity on Uenuku, and changed him into a rainbow so that he could join his family in the sky, where they still live to this day and watch over their descendants.\nThe tribes of the \"Kurahaup\u014d\" in Marlborough canoe know the mountain Tapuae-o-Uenuku (which means 'footprint of the rainbow') on the Kaik\u014dura Ranges as being the place where Chief Tapuae-nuku climbed the rainbow steps of his war-god ancestor Uenuku. They both climbed and died on top of mountains in search of their supernatural wives. Uenuku became a set of mountains with his wife and daughter, and Chief Tapuae-nuku joined his own wife and daughter in the afterlife. When a rainbow appears over Tapuae-o-Uenuku, it is said to be a sign of Chief Tapuae-nuku's journey.\nArtifacts.\nAccording to legend, the spirit of Uenuku was brought from Hawaiki to New Zealand in a stone by the people on the Tainui canoe. When they landed, they made the large carving called \"Te Uenuku\" out of a t\u014dtara tree with a round opening at the top, in which the stone was placed so that the god could live in the carving. It is unique among other M\u0101ori carvings, and looks similar to Hawaiian carving styles."}

For example, a decrease in water potential is detected by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus, which stimulates ADH release from the pituitary gland to increase the permeability of the walls of the collecting ducts in the kidneys. Therefore, a large proportion of water is reabsorbed from fluid in the kidneys to prevent too much water from being excreted."}

In later times ships built and manned on the Catalan coasts, under the authority of non-Catalan kings, for example the kings of Naples, carried out some important events.\nSimilarly, the navies of the kingdoms of Mallorca and Valencia had their own entity and could be studied separately\nFame of the Catalan army.\nThe modern generic designation \"Armada del rey de Arag\u00f3n\" is inexact and not very descriptive of medieval reality. Until Fernando el Cat\u00f3lico, the galleys of the Crown of Aragon were Catalan, Valencian or Majorcan. They were often owned by local institutions ( Generalitat, municipalities, etc. . . ). Sometimes they were privately owned. They put themselves at the service of the king, but he was not the owner. \u21b5For quite a long time, the fame of the Catalan army was recognized by many.\nGalea vogia III hommini per bancho ogi, et have XXVIII et XXVIIII banchi. Le fuste vogano dui remi per bancho, et queste sonno de pi\u00f9 qualitate de longe\u00e7e, ad beneplacitum XII, XVI, XX, XXIIII etc... Et realmente quisto modo de galee ando aptissimamente la nation Catallana et sondo aptissimi allo governo de quelle, perch\u00e9 le altre nationi armano solamente alli bisogni, et li Catalani al continuo fando lo misterio, et ciascheduno ne sa in parte et li Catallani in totum.\nDe navigatione. Benedetto Cotrugli.\nY ass\u00ed hallamos que, en galeras, los catalanes han hecho m\u00e1s cosas buenas que ningunas otras nasciones, por donde resulta el refr\u00e1n: \u201cQue si en galera se haze cosa buena, el capit\u00e1n \u00e1 de ser catal\u00e1n\u201d.\nMart\u00ed de Viciana: Libro tercero de la Cr\u00f3nica de la \u00ednclita y coronada ciudad de Valencia.\nBook of the Consulate of the Sea.\nThe \"Book of the Consulate of the Sea\" has an appendix of 34 chapters entitled \"Ordinations of all Ships who will arm themselves to go to choirs, and of all navies that are faciper sea\". I meet again before old Catalan, but I would venture \"Ordinances of any ship that is armed by corsair and of all armada that takes place in the sea\". The summary note indicates the positions and functions appropriate to the service, as can be seen from its list by subject:\n\"From the admiral, captain and ship owners, as it must be clear expense and benefit; from the comitre, from conveniences; from the parts that have to be done in an armed ship, from pilots and other trades, and from the partition; the Admiral, from senior pilot; of proeles; of crossbowmen; of men-at-arms, of Gabieros (those who went to the cages); of weight and measure of over-guards; of helmsmen, of barbers; of liquidators, of the Admiral's Guard, of spies and of registrars; of servants; of master of azuela (carpenter of riverside), of crossbowman; of calafate, of corporal of servants; of consuls; of which the Captain has to do; Notary public, of the treasurers; of the senior pilot, and of how are the fifths raised (distributed, distributed?) \"\nAnother appendix is the Penal Ordinances for the service of the Navy, made up of 39 articles bearing this heading: \"King Peter chapters on maritime facts and acts\" (King Peter chapters on the maritime facts and actions) promulgated in Barcelona by royal order in 1430 and which were issued by three notable Barcelona sailors: Bernat de Cabrera, Jaume Bosc\u00e0 and Joan Llompart.\nCatalan galleys fleet.\nThe \"Catalan galley\" (formerly galea), has its own entity with respect to the galleries of the other maritime nations (referenced from the s. XIII), since Corominas provides a reference to a \"Catalan galley\" from the year 1120 (100 years earlier than the other countries). It was a type of warship and trade ship, powered entirely by the power of oars and sometimes by the wind, thanks to the presence of masts with their sails (usually Latin).\nAt least as of the 12th century, the Catalans built the \"Catalan galleys\", making extensive use of them for wars with the different maritime republics (as enemies or as allies) or for trade with most Mediterranean ports, guaranteeing trade routes with Catalan consulates. Its use began to decline from the seventeenth century, when they were progressively replaced by sailboats, finally becoming extinct in the late eighteenth century .\nDead-reckoning in the Catalan Navy.\nWith the Atlantic navigations of the time of the discoveries - apart from the compass - the tables, the astrolabe and the rod of Jacob or the quadrant were necessary, but it must be said that during these navigations - like the Mediterranean navigations - the distance navigated calculated by estimate, and, \"navigation by appreciation\" is not possible without an instrument to measure time.\nMarine sandglass.\nFor more than 500 years (from 1300 to 1800) the instrument for measuring time at sea was \"the Ampoule of hours\". In Catalonia there are references of its manufacture since the middle of the 14th century made of Catalan transparent glass according to the formulas of the alchemist Guillem Sedacer, using as a fundent the soda obtained by burning the barrella (its ashes dissolved in water and cast with a sieve have been the basis from the \"laundry\" to wash clothes from the Neolithic). The barrella grows on the Catalan coast from Orihuela to Montpellier and the Italian manuals for making Italian glass (La Sedacina and Arte Vetraria) say: \"bisogna comprare la soda di Spagna\".\nIn an extensive inventory of the things owned by Charles V of France that were in his possession at the time of his death on September 16, 1380. There is an article cited as \"heures de naviguer\" from the king's study to his castle at Saint Germain in Laye, which is described as follows:\nThis \"orloge de mer\" or \"heures de naviguer\" was sent to him, as a gift, when he was still only a prince (being, therefore, before 1356 when he took the place of his father in prison), by John the hunter, through his aunt Yolanda de Arag\u00f3n, when Juan asked him for a manuscript by Joan de Mandeville, \"to translate it into the Aragonese language\". This point is essential to know the language of the original, since it does not tell you \" \"to translate it into the Catalan language\" \", which was the most important because it was yours - implying that you did not need any translation - on the other hand, if you had in Catalonia a copy in the Catalan language would not have been requested by her aunt, ergo the Yolanda de Arag\u00f3n manuscript was in Catalan.\nThe most interesting of this reference from Charles V of France, is that an Ampoule of hours is defined as \"ung grant orloge de mero\" (\"a great sea watch\"), this together with the fact that the first explanation of its use at sea it appears in \" the twelfth of the Cresti\u00e0 \" (work by M.Llaurad\u00f3 on Francesc Eiximenis ) and that it was given to him by his aunt Yolanda de Arag\u00f3n, suggests that, in this period, the importance of an hourglass was commonly Related to its use at sea and its manufacturing demand, it could have originated from the navigation needs of the Crown of Aragon, a maritime power of the moment in the Mediterranean. \nThe Pisano-Catalan Crusade to the Balearic Islands, which at the time was a Muslim taifa, consisted of an expedition in retaliation for the acts of piracy committed by the Muslims who inhabited it, carried out by Ram\u00f3n Berenguer III and his allies, in 1114. Founded in a treaty of 1113 between the Republic of Pisa and the Count of Barcelona, it had the objective of taking the island from the Muslims and preventing the attack and obstruction of the convoys and ships of the Christian merchants who at that time were sailing in the Mediterranean Sea. Although Mallorca was once again in Muslim power, it served to lay the foundations for the future Catalan naval power and to strengthen business contacts in the Mediterranean."}

{"id": "757029", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=757029", "title": "Socio-economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic", "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a larger effect more than the disease itself. As the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread around the globe, many people have begun to think about the economic effects such as the decreased business and unemployment. The pandemic caused the largest global recession in history, with more than a third of the global population at the time being placed on lockdown.\nShortages.\nSupply shortages were expected to affect a number of sectors due to panic buying, increased usage of goods to during the pandemic, and people raising up prices on needed products such as masks, toilet paper, plastic gloves and hand sanitizer. Reports of lack of food or groceries were said. The pandemic also caused many social events to be pushed back such as concert delays and movie release dates. Many movie theaters are being put out of business.\nThere was an increase in gleaning, meaning people going to farms to pick up food plants left over on the ground after a harvest. Because restaurants and other food businesses canceled their orders, farmers had more extra crops than usual. People formed new organizations to find farmers with extra food, organize people to collect it, and transport it to food banks and other places where people could get to it.\nStock markets.\nGlobal stock markets fell on 24 February 2020 due to a significant rise in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China. By 28 February 2020, stock markets worldwide saw their largest single-week declines since the 2008 financial crisis. Global stock markets crashed in March 2020.\nBusinesses.\nIt is likely that business money losses are to be in the billions and increasing. By 16 March, news reports emerged indicating that the effect on the United States economy would be worse than previously thought.\nAccording to the World Data Lab, Africa's middle class is at risk because of the coronavirus pandemic. According to one economist from the Africa and the Middle East at Standard Chartered Bank, a middle-class person is someone who is not rich but does have a steady income. In Africa, about 170 million people are middle class and about 8 million of them could lose their businesses or become poor because of COVID-19. This is because one of the industries that has helped Africa's middle class rise over the past 30 years is tourism, and many countries closed borders and encouraged people not to travel. Experts say this is especially bad because a strong middle class lifts the whole country.\nNigeria and other African countries are also affected by low oil prices. Because people all over the world are driving and flying and traveling less, oil costs less. That means oil companies make less money. Many of them have fired some of their employees in Africa. Then those employees do not have money to spend on local businesses.\nCurrency.\nThe coronavirus pandemic increased the amount of money spent through cashless payments, like credit cards and aps, over cash, meaning coins and paper bills. The United Nations and many specific countries, such as Kenya and Sweden, encouraged people to pay for things without using cash. Physical coins and bills can carry germs. Credit cards and aps make it easier for people to pay for things without touching other people. This means that the store or other seller must pay a fee to the credit card company or app company.\nExperts say this may cause problems for immigrants, people with disabilities and other people who cannot easily sign up for credit cards or aps.\nEducation.\nThe pandemic has affected educational systems worldwide causing many schools and universities to close down. According to data released by UNESCO on 25 March, school and university closures due to COVID-19 were caused in 165 countries. Including localized closures, this affects over 1.5\u00a0billion students worldwide. Many classes were suspended for the rest of the school year with many tacking online classes.\nIn the United Kingdom, some schools stayed open and taught the children of essential workers, at-risk children, and children with special education needs. According to the Independent Provider of Special Education Advice organization, British educators unfairly sent special education students home either for no reason or by claiming that they could not wash their hands or keep a safe social distance.\nRace and racism.\nCOVID-19 did not affect everyone in each country the same way. As of May 2020, APM Research Lab said the death rate among black Americans was 2.4 times as high as for whites and 2.2 times as high as for Latino and Asian Americans. In July 2020, \"The New York Times\" printed data from the Centers for Disease Control showing that black and Latino Americans were three times as likely to become sick and twice as likely to die as white Americans. This showed some difference from place to place, but it was mostly true in both cities and the country, regardless of how old people were. Native Americans were also more likely than whites to become sick and die. Asian Americans were 1.3 times as likely to become sick as whites were. Camara Jones, an epidemiologist who once worked for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said this was socioeconomic and not because of any natural difference in black and white people's bodies. In the United States, black citizens are more likely to work jobs where they serve the public and to ride on buses and trains rather than take their own cars to work, which makes them more likely to be infected than people who work in private offices or from home. Sharrelle Barber, an epidemiologist and biostatistician from Drexel University, also said black Americans can live in crowded neighborhoods where social distancing is harder to do and healthy food harder to find. Both Barber and Jones blamed the long history of racism in the United States for these things. Three senators, Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren, said the federal government should start recording the race of COVID-19 patients so scientists could study this problem.\nIn the United Kingdom, twice as many black COVID-19 patients died as white COVID-19 patients. Other non-white people, like people from India and Bangledesh, were also more likely to die of COVID-19 than whites. Britain's Office of National Statistics said that the differences in money and education explained some of this difference but not all of it. They also said they did not know whether non-white patients caught COVID-19 more often or whether they caught more severe cases. Only female Chinese Britons were less likely to die of COVID-19 than white Britons.\nIndigenous peoples.\nNative Americans in the United States have shown more deaths from COVID-19 than the rest of the U.S. As of May, the Navajo Nation had 88 deaths and 2,757 cases, and the money they had been promised by the government arrived weeks late. Only 30% of the people in the Navajo Nation have pipes with running water, which made it difficult for people to wash their hands.\nScientists from Chapman University made a plan to protect the Tsimane people in Bolivia from COVID-19 and said this plan would also work for other indigenous peoples living on their own land. The scientists said that many indigenous peoples have problems that make COVID-19 more dangerous for them, like poverty, less clean water, and other lung diseases. Hospitals may be a long distance away, and racism can affect the way doctors and nurses react. But they also sometimes have things that help, like traditions of making decisions together and the ability to grow food nearby. The scientists found people who spoke the Tsimane language as a first language and made teams to go to Tsimane towns to warn them about COVID-19. They also used radio stations. They said the best strategy was for whole communities to decide to isolate. They found this worked well because the Tsimane already usually made their big decisions together as a community in special meetings and already had a tradition of quarantining new mothers. The Chapman scientists said their plan would also work for other indigenous peoples who also make decisions together, like the Tsimane.\n The Waswanipi Cree in Canada, the Mapoon people in Australia, and many groups in South America already tried plans like these on their own.\nGeorge Floyd protests.\nIn April 2020, police officers in Minneapolis, Minnesota in the United States killed an unarmed black man called George Floyd while they were arresting him. There were months of protests all over the world against police racism. Many people said that the reason the protests were so big was not only because of racism but also because COVID-19 hurt more non-white people than other people, both by making them sick and by costing them their jobs.\nScholar Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith of the Yale School of Medicine said, \"They are protesting against police brutality and excessive force, no question, but they're also protesting for the ability to live their lives fully and completely, and to not have their lives cut short, either by force or preventable diseases.\"\nJob losses also meant people had more time to protest. On \"The Daily Show\", athlete Anquan Boldin said he thought all the cancelled sports events were also making the protests bigger and more focused: \"The one thing I'm happy that is not happening right now is that sports isn't being played.\" He then named many tournaments and other events that had been cancelled. \"...and everybody \"could\" be distracted by those things that are going on, but because you don't have sports, everybody's attention is focused on this one thing. And I think, for us, this is the opportunity to really create change.\"\nTransportation.\nThe pandemic has had a large impact on aviation business due to Travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as a decrease in demand among travelers. Many reductions in passenger numbers has caused in planes flying empty between airports and the cancellation of flights.\nThe cruise ship business has also been affected by a decrease, with the share prices of the major cruise lines down 70-80%.\nSocial.\nOn 18 March 2020, the World Health Organization issued a report about mental health and psychosocial issues during the COVID-19 outbreak.\nDue to doubts if pets or other livestock can pass on coronavirus to humans, many people did not want to keep their pets as they were scared of getting the disease. In the Arab World, celebrities were telling people to keep and protect their pets. Meanwhile, people in the U.K. bought more pets during the coronavirus lockdown to not be lonely.\nMany countries have reported an increase in domestic violence and intimate partner violence because of lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has been followed by a concern for a possible increase in suicides due to quarantine and social-distancing guidelines, fear, and unemployment and financial reasons.\nCOVID-19 and sleep.\nMost of the time, people who work during the week sleep and wake earlier on weekdays than they do on weekends. This is called social jetlag and it leads to poor sleep. Scientists from the University of Basel said the lockdowns made people sleep longer and at healthier times, so there was less social jetlag. They said this was because even people who still worked did so from home, so they did not have to get up early to travel to work. They also found that people did not sleep as well because they were worried.\nFamilies.\nThe pandemic affected families. In a study from Vanderbilt University, 27% of American parents said their mental health had gotten worse and 14% of parents reported their children's mental health had gotten worse. Many families lost child care and health insurance. Many families found it more difficult to get enough food. Families with younger children were more affected because they were more likely to miss child care."}

The most recent case are people being forced by law to stay at home as schools and jobs are closed due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. This is different than quarantine as this is for people who have not been infected.\nWhat is it?\nAccording to the CDC, isolation is the act of separating a sick individual with a contagious disease from healthy individuals without that contagious disease in order to protect the public from getting the contagious disease.\nWhy is it important?\nContagious diseases can spread to others through many forms. Four types of infectious disease transmission can happen: (1) contact transmission, which can be through direct physical contact (2) vehicular transmission, which involves contaminated objects, (3) airborne transmission, which involves spread of infectious particles through air, and (4) vector transmission, which is spread through insects or animals. Since diseases can spread through many forms of transmission it is important for people who are not infected to stay at home so that they won't get sick. For those who are sick then it is important for them to quarantine to make sure they don't spread the disease."}

On 14 April 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reported that all of the G7 nations had already entered or were entering into what was called a \"deep recession\". The IMF has stated that the economic decline is \"far worse\" than that of the Great Recession in 2009.\nThe numbers.\nThe pandemic has led to more than a third of the world's population being placed on lockdown to stop the spread of COVID-19. This has caused severe economic downfalls for economies across the world, following soon after a global economic slowdown during 2019 that saw a lowering numbers in stock markets worldwide.\nThe United Nations (UN) predicted in April 2020 that global unemployment will wipe out 6.7 per cent of working hours globally in the second quarter of 2020\u2014equivalent to 195 million full-time workers.\nOther effects.\nThe recession saw the fall of the price of oil caused by the 2020 Russia\u2013Saudi Arabia oil price war, the collapse of the tourism industry, hospitality industry, energy industry, and a large decrease in consumer activity. \nGlobal stock markets crashed around 20 to 30% during late February and March 2020. During the crash, global stock markets had many swings, mainly due to uncertainty in the markets."}

When doctors or government officials went on television to say these conspiracy theories were wrong, that only made people think the conspiracy theories were important enough for doctors and officials to talk about. One group of scientists said governments could use conspiracy theories to distract people from real problems.\nFake information has been spread through social media, text messages, and mass media, including the state media of countries such as China, Russia, Iran, and Turkmenistan.\nIt has been spread by celebrities, politicians (including leaders in countries such as the United States, Iran, and Brazil), and other important public figures. Commercial scams have claimed to offer at-home tests and \"miracle\" cures. \nOther claims include that the virus is a bio-weapon with a patented vaccine, a population control scheme, or the result of a spy operation. Many theories say that there is a link between the virus and Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV). They believe that the virus escaped from the WIV by accident.\nOrigins of the virus.\nOne survey by Pew Research showed 29% of Americans who answered thought SARS-CoV-2 could have been made in a lab on purpose and 23% thought it could have been made in a lab by accident.\nIn early May 2020, United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said there was \"enormous evidence\" that the virus was from a laboratory in Wuhan. but he said it could have been an accident. Intelligence officials and virus scientists said it was more likely that the virus had not come from a lab.\nA survey of people in the United Kingdom showed many of them thought COVID-19 was caused by 5G wireless networks.\nWhen the leader of Iran, Ayatollah Khamenei, said that he did not want the United States to help his country against coronavirus, he named the idea that Americans had made the virus on purpose to harm Iranians as one of his reasons: \"I do not know how real this accusation is but when it exists, who in their right mind would trust you to bring them medication?\"\nScientific studies on the origins of the virus.\nOn March 17, 2020, scientists from Columbia University and other places published a paper in \"Nature Medicine\" showing that SARS-CoV-2 was almost surely not made by humans in a laboratory. They did this by comparing the genomes of different viruses to each other. The scientists saw that SARS-CoV-2 did not match any of the viral backbones that already exist for virologists to use. Within a few weeks, this became one of the most cited scientific papers in history, meaning other scientists were reading it and using its information."}

{"id": "757131", "revid": "7852610", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=757131", "title": "History of Ireland", "text": "The history of Ireland is the story of its past. Ireland is now divided into the Republic of Ireland, and Northern Ireland which is part of the United Kingdom. People began farming on Ireland thousands of years ago. The Celts moved there about 2,500 years ago. Ireland was divided into many small kingdoms. When Christians arrived, most Irish people became Christian. The Vikings and later the Normans invaded in the Middle Ages. Eventually, Ireland became part of the United Kingdom, with Great Britain. In the 1920s, most of Ireland became a separate country, but Northern Ireland stayed in the United Kingdom. \nPrehistory.\nNobody knows exactly when the first people came to Ireland. Using radiometric dating, scientists found that a bear bone with knife marks was 12,500 years old. It is likely that people lived in Ireland then. By 7900 BCE, hunter-gatherers (people who ate wild plants and animals) lived in Ireland. This time was called the Stone Age. Around 4000 BCE, they started making farms with animals and plants. They made pottery, stone tools, wood houses, and large tombs. The Bronze Age started around 2500 BCE. People learned to make things out of metals like bronze, gold, and copper, but it was mostly only rich people who had them. People also started weaving and working with leather. Large rooms were built to store metal weapons. The Iron Age started around 600 BCE or earlier, when people started making iron tools. During the Iron Age, Celts came to Ireland, so they started speaking Celtic languages. The Celts brought their style of art with them. Between 1 and 400 CE, Roman soldiers may have invaded Ireland, but Ireland did not join the Roman Empire. About five kings each ruled a large part of Ireland.\nEarly medieval era.\nIn the 300s CE, Christianity and writing were both brought to Ireland. Saint Patrick was famous for spreading Christianity in Ireland in the 400s, but he was not the first Christian in Ireland. For the next 300-400 years, more Irish people became Christian. Christian monks from other countries came to Irish monasteries. Some monasteries grew into towns. The main buildings from 400-800 CE were round forts (raths or ringforts) made of dirt, with houses inside. Most of the forests were cut down to make farms. There were some new kingdoms in this time. The kingdom of U\u00ed N\u00e9ill in north Ireland took over the area called Tara, then ruled over all the other kingdoms. They were called the high kings.\nBy 800 almost everyone was Christian. They were called Gaels and they spoke the Gaelic language. In 795, the Vikings, sailors from Scandinavia, invaded and stole from many towns. The Vikings ruled over Irish kings. They built Dublin and other cities and towns on the coast. In 902 the Christian Irish armies pushed out the Vikings, but in 917 the Vikings came back to start a new kingdom of Dublin. Over time, Vikings started new kingdoms. In the 1000s and 1100s, the Vikings either left or became part of Irish culture.\nBrian Boru, a King of Munster, fought against Leinster and became the high king in the early 1000s. After that, high kings came from the four provinces: Munster, Leinster, Ulster, and Connacht. Each province also had its own king.\nNorman era.\nIn the 1100s, Ruaidr\u00ed Ua Conchobair was the high king. He forced Diarmaid Mac Murchada, the king of Leinster, to leave his kingdom. Diarmaid asked Henry II, a Norman king of England, to help him get his land back. Henry agreed, so an army of Norman (and Welsh) knights invaded Ireland in 1167. Richard de Clare, called Strongbow, led the knights. Henry thought the Norman knights and Strongbow were too powerful, so he decided to take over Ireland. He traveled to Ireland with his own fleet in 1171. Henry conquered Ireland and gave it to his youngest son John. Henry thought John would never be king of England, so he made John Lord of Ireland. But John became king of England in 1199 after all his brothers died. After that, Ireland was ruled by the English king. Norman lords from England started taking over more of Ireland. They mostly lived near the east and south coasts, and some land was still ruled by Irish kings.\nThe Norman lords built new castles and towns in their land. Many people came from England to Ireland for more land. The English, Norman, or Anglo-Norman lords broke up land into areas called manors. They put fences around farms so everyone would know who owned the farm. Farms were made better so they could grow more in a smaller area. The Anglo-Normans planted more wheat and raised more sheep. The population grew quickly. In 1297, Anglo-Normans started the Irish Parliament, a gathering to make laws.\nThe Gaelic Irish often tried to take control from the Anglo-Normans. In 1315, Edward Bruce, a lord from Scotland, allied with the Irish to fight the Anglo-Normans. In 1318 the Anglo-Normans won the war. But the Anglo-Norman rulers became weaker. By 1500, England only controlled a small part of eastern Ireland, called the Pale. In the rest of Ireland, people spoke Irish and had Irish culture.\nModern Ireland.\nIreland had a governor (ruler) who was supposed to be loyal to the King of England. In the 1530s, Thomas Fitzgerald, the governor, rebelled against England. Because of this, King Henry VIII of England wanted more power. In 1541, he declared himself King of Ireland instead of Lord of Ireland. The English built military forts in Ireland. English settlers moved to areas in Ireland called plantations. They used English laws and took over a lot of Ireland. During the Nine Years War in the 1590s, Irish soldiers from Ulster fought the English.\nMost of the Irish people were Catholic. The settlers were mostly Protestant. In Ulster, the largest plantation, settlers were mostly Presbyterians from Scotland. In the other provinces, the settlers were mostly Anglicans from England. English kings and the English Parliament wanted the Irish people to be Anglican. They made the Church of Ireland, a branch of the Anglican Church. The Penal Laws of the 1600s punished Irish people who did not follow the Church of Ireland. The Anglicans grew more powerful. This time was called the Protestant Ascendancy. That was the end of Gaelic Ireland. \nIn the 1700s, the Catholic people of Ireland were poor peasants. They were not allowed to own land, and much of the food they produced was exported overseas by England. Forcing them to mostly eat potatoes. There were rebellions against landlords and English rule, but they mostly failed. In 1801, the Acts of Union joined Ireland with Great Britain, forming the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (UK). The Irish parliament became part of the United Kingdom parliament in London. \nIn 1831, the government forced primary schools to teach in English, not Irish. Children were punished if they spoke Irish in school. People had to speak English if they wanted a good job. From 1845-1849, a disease killed potato plants, which caused the Great Famine, or the Irish Potato Famine. About a million people starved to death, and a million more moved to other countries. The famine hurt Irish speakers the most, because they were poor. More people switched from speaking Irish to English. Some say people starved because crops in Ireland were sold to other countries. These crops could have fed people in Ireland. Many Irish people were forced to leave their land because they could not pay rent to the landlords. Some had to work in factories set up by the government, because of the Irish Poor Laws. From the 1870s to the 1890s, there was violence between the Land League and the government. The Land League wanted lower rent and they wanted to buy land. \nEfforts for freedom.\nIn the late 1800s and early 1900s, the British government made it easier for Irish people to buy land. In 1886 the Liberal Party tried to make a new parliament for Ireland. This idea was called Home Rule. However, Parliament did not allow Ireland to have Home Rule. Around 1900, Irish people were split into Nationalists, who wanted Home Rule or independence, and Unionists, who wanted to be ruled by Britain. Nationalists were mostly Catholics who lived in rural areas. Unionists were mostly Protestants who lived in cities. The Unionists worried they would lose their rights if Ireland had its own government. In some parts of Ireland, Unionists were mostly rich. But in Ulster, many Unionists were workers who wanted the upper class to have less power.\nIn 1912 some people in Parliament tried again to get Home Rule. About 500,000 Unionists in Ulster signed a petition against Home Rule called the Ulster Convenant. They also formed an army called the Ulster Volunteers. Irish Nationalists formed an army called the Irish Volunteers. By 1914, the government was too worried about World War I to think about Home Rule. Both Nationalists and Unionists fought in British military units in World War I.\nIn 1916, there was a rebellion by Irish people who wanted to be independent. Britain stopped it quickly but many Irish were angry. They elected Sinn F\u00e9in, an independence party, to most Irish seats in Parliament. Sinn F\u00e9in members refused to go to London to join Parliament. Instead they started a new assembly in Dublin called the D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (or D\u00e1il). Sinn F\u00e9in said that Ireland was now independent. In 1918 they organized the Irish Volunteers into the Irish Republican Army (IRA). From 1919-1921, the IRA fought a war against the British (Irish War of Independence) to be a separate country. In 1920 the British government decided to divide Ireland into Southern Ireland (The Provisional Government), which was about 5/6 of the island, and Northern Ireland. The D\u00e1il and Britain signed a treaty in 1922 to make Southern Ireland into the Irish Free State. It was still connected to the UK, but it had more freedom. However, the IRA wanted to fully leave the UK. They fought a war (Irish Civil War) against the Irish Free State government. The IRA stopped fighting in 1923.\nAfter division.\nNorthern Ireland was governed by the Ulster Unionist Party from 1922-1972. James Craig, its first prime minister, said it was a Protestant country. The Irish Free State got a new constitution in 1937, which created its government. In 1949, Ireland left the British Commonwealth and became the Republic of Ireland (sometimes just called Ireland). In 1969, violence was growing in Northern Ireland between the Nationalist Catholics and Unionist Protestants. The Provisional IRA formed to defend Catholics and unite Ireland. From 1969 until 1998, there was constant fighting (The Troubles) between the Provisional IRA and the UK Army.\nIn 1998, Irish voters approved the Belfast Agreement, or Good Friday Agreement, which meant they agreed that Northern Ireland would stay in the United Kingdom. Northern Ireland could join the Republic of Ireland if more than half of voters wanted to. The agreement also created councils where ministers from both parts of Ireland worked together. Northern Ireland got a new government in 1998.\nDuring most of the 20th century (1900-1999), the Republic of Ireland was over 90% Catholic. The people and the government were socially conservative. Divorce, contraceptives, and abortions were not allowed until the late 20th century. In 1927 the Republic of Ireland government created the Electricity Supply Board to manage electricity. By the 1960s, 80% of rural families had electricity. The Single Electricity Market was created in 2007 to supply all of Ireland.\nThe Republic of Ireland and the UK joined the European Economic Community, which became the European Union (EU), in 1973. In the 1990s, the Republic of Ireland became part of the European Single Market. People are allowed to travel and sell things between countries in the European Single Market. In the late 20th century the economy grew quickly, and changed from mostly farming to mostly services and industry. The UK, including Northern Ireland, left the European Union in 2020, but the UK and the Republic of Ireland agreed not to control border crossings."}

Jackson himself hailed from Tennessee, and thus Tennessee may be said to have been the founding region of the Democratic Party. In 1828, Jackson was elected president, becoming both the first Democrat and the first Tennessean to do so. He won over 95% of the vote in Tennessee. In 1844, Tennessee Democrat James K Polk, a Jackson protege, was elected president. By the late 1850s, Tennessee, a slave-state, was dominated by Democrats. In 1856, in fact, the antislavery Republican party was not even on the ballot in Tennessee.\nCivil War &amp; Andrew Johnson.\nSecession &amp; Restoration.\nTennessee seceded from the Union along with 10 other southern states, in 1861. It was one of the last states to do so. It was quickly recaptured by the Union.\nGov. Andrew Johnson.\nCong. Andrew Johnson, D-TN, was named governor of Tennessee by President Lincoln. In 1864, Lincoln chose Johnson (a Tennessean) as his running mate for President. Following Lincoln\u00b4s reelection, Johnson was sworn in as vice-president. After Lincoln\u00b4s assassination in 1865, Johnson became the 17th US president. Johnson was very unpopular, however. In 1868 he became the first US President to be impeached, and his removal from office failed by just ONE vote.\nPost-Civil War.\nFollowing the Civil War, the thousands of slaves in Tennessee were liberated, and due to the 15th Amendment given the right to vote. However, around that same period, the Klu Klux Klan was founded in Tennessee. It, along with other such groups, suppressed many African-Americans from voting. Although Democrats initally controlled Tennessean politics, their grasp was not as strong as it was throughout the rest of the south, and by the 20th Century Tennessee was more of a swing state.\nDwindling numbers and more recent elections.\nDemocrats have lost the majority the once had in Tennessee.\n2000 &amp; 2016 presidential elections in Tennessee.\n2000.\nIn 2000, the Democrats nominated for president, Al Gore. If elected Gore would have been the fourth Tennessean Democrat to be president. But Gore lost the Electoral College very narrowly. He would have won it had he won his home state of Tennessee: Tennessee supported the Republican candidate, George W Bush. The election was a surefire sign Tennessee was growing more and more conservative.\n2016.\nIn 2016 Tennessee again showed how conservative it had grown when it voted for Republican Donald Trump by 26%.\nIn Congress.\nTennessee Legislature.\nTennessee House.\nDemocrats hold just 28 of the 99 seats in the Tennessee House. Their leader there is Karen Camper.\nTennessee Senate.\nDemocrats control just 7 of the 33 seats in the Tennesse Senate. One of these seven members, and the leader of Democrats there, is Jeff Yarbro.\nUS Congress.\nUS House.\nTennessee has 9 seats in the United States House of Representatives. Of these, just 2 are held by Democrats. These Democrats are: Steve Cohen, and Jim Cooper.\nHistorically.\nDemocrats last held a majority of the Tennessee seats in the US House in 2009. In 2010 Republicans won a majority, and have kept it to date.\nUS Senate.\nNeither of the 2 US Senate seats from Tennessee is held by Democrats."}

It has been succeeded by X3D.\nVRML files.\nVRML uses text files. The vertices, edges, surface colors, UV-mapped textures, shininess, transparency and more of a 3D polygon can be specified. Graphical components can be made to fetch web pages or other VRML files from the Internet from URLs when the user clicks on the graphical component. Animations, sounds, lighting, and other things about the virtual world can interact with the user or can happen when external events say so, such as timers. A special Script Node allows program code (such as program code in Java or ECMAScript) to be added to a VRML file.\nVRML files are commonly called \"worlds\" and have the .wrl extension (for example, a VRML file can be called island.wrl). VRML files are in plain text and usually compress well using gzip, which is useful to transfer them over the Internet faster (some files compressed using gzip use the .wrz extension). Many 3D modeling programs can save objects and scenes in VRML format.\nStandardization.\nThe Web3D Consortium was started to develop the format further. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) have made VRML and its successor, X3D, international standards.\nThe first version of VRML was specified in November 1994. It was specified from, and looked a lot like, the API and file format of the Open Inventor software component, originally developed by SGI. The development of version 2.0 was guided by the ad-hoc VRML Architecture Group (VAG). A working draft was published in August 1996. Formal collaboration between the VAG and SC24 of ISO began in 1996, and VRML 2.0 was submitted to ISO to be used as an international standard. The current and functionally complete version is VRML97 (ISO/IEC 14772-1:1997). X3D (ISO/IEC 19775-1) has succeeded VRML.\nEmergence, popularity, and rival technical upgrade.\nDave Raggett created the term VRML in a paper he wrote called \u201cExtending WWW to support Platform Independent Virtual Reality\u201d, which was submitted to the First World Wide Web Conference in 1994, and first discussed at the WWW94 VRML BOF, which Tim Berners-Lee started. There, Mark Pesce showed the Labyrinth demo he developed with Tony Parisi and Peter Kennard. VRML was introduced to a wider audience in the SIGGRAPH Course, VRML: Using 3D to Surf the Web in August 1995. In October 1995, at Internet World, Template Graphics Software (TGS) demonstrated a 3D/VRML plug-in for the beta release of Netscape 2.0 by Netscape Communications.\nIn 1997, a new version of VRML, VRML97 (also known as VRML2 or VRML 2.0), was finalized, and became an ISO standard. VRML97 was used on the Internet on some personal homepages and sites, such as \"CyberTown\", which used Blaxxun Software to allow 3D chat to be possible. SGI's Cosmo Software supported the format. When SGI restructured in 1998, the division was sold to the VREAM Division of Platinum Technology, which was then taken over by Computer Associates, which did not develop or distribute the software. Because of that, various proprietary Web 3D formats came out over the next few years, including Microsoft Chrome and Adobe Atmosphere, neither of which is supported today. VRML's capabilities were mostly the same while realtime 3D graphics kept improving. The VRML Consortium changed its name to the Web3D Consortium, and began work on the successor to VRML, which is X3D.\nSGI ran a web site at vrml.sgi.com that hosted a string of regular short performances of a character called \"Floops\", who was a VRML character in a VRML world. A company called \"Protozoa\" created Floops.\nH-Anim is a standard for animated Humanoids, which is based around VRML, and later X3D. The first version of the H-Anim standard, 1.0, was supposed to be submitted at the end of March 1998.\nVRML never saw much serious widespread use, possibly because most users, such as business users and personal users, had low bandwidth and slow dial-up Internet access.\nVRML was mostly experimented with in education and research, where an open specification is most valued. It has now been developed into X3D. The MPEG-4 Interactive Profile (ISO/IEC 14496) was based on VRML (now on X3D), and X3D is largely backwards-compatible with it. VRML is also widely used as a file format to distribute 3D models, mostly from CAD systems.\nA free version of VRML for multiple platforms called OpenVRML is available. Its libraries can be used to add both VRML and X3D support to applications, and a GTK+ plugin that allows VRML/X3D worlds to be rendered in web browsers is available.\nIn the 2000s, many companies, such as Bitmanagement, improved the quality level of virtual effects in VRML to the quality level of DirectX 9.0c using proprietary solutions. All main features like game modeling are already complete. They include multi-pass render with low level setting for Z-buffer, BlendOp, AlphaOp, Stencil, Multi-texture, Shader with HLSL and GLSL support, realtime Render To Texture, Multi Render Target (MRT) and PostProcessing. Many demos show VRML supports lightmap, normalmap, SSAO, CSM and Realtime Environment Reflection and other virtual effects."}

It was designed to study virology. It is run by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). The institute is in Jiangxia District, Wuhan, Hubei. It opened China's first biosafety level 4 (BSL\u20134) laboratory in 2015.\nIn January 2020, conspiracy theories spread which said that the COVID-19 pandemic came from a virus made by the WIV. But scientific evidence says that the virus is natural. One story in the \"Washington Post\" said that US State Department had raised safety concerns about WIV's research on bat coronaviruses in 2018. In April 2020, U.S. intelligence officials looked into reports the virus may have started by an accident by WIV scientists studying bats.\nExperts do not believe the virus escaped from the institute. One expert said that up to seven million people in Southeast Asia are infected each year with bat coronaviruses. He said there are probably only about six people who work with the viruses at the institute. It does not make sense that virus came from one of these of people compared with the millions of other people affected by bats. The staff at the Wuhan Institute of Virology were trained at US labs and follow high safety standards. The evidence shows that this is not a laboratory accident.\nHistory.\nThe WIV started in 1956 as the Wuhan Microbiology Laboratory under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). In 1961, it became the South China Institute of Microbiology, and in 1962 was renamed Wuhan Microbiology Institute. In June 1978 it was named Wuhan Institute of Virology.\nIn 2015, the WIV's National Bio-safety Laboratory was completed at a cost of 300 million yuan ($44 million). It was built with help from the French government's CIRI lab. Some of the money to build the laboratory was given by the U.S. government. \nCoronavirus research.\nIn 2005, a group including researchers from the Wuhan Institute of Virology published research into the origin of the SARS coronavirus. They found China's horseshoe bats have a lot of SARS-like coronaviruses. Scientists took samples from thousands of horseshoe bats in locations across China, and found over 300 bat coronaviruses.\nIn 2015, an international team including two scientists from the Institute made a hybrid virus, combining a bat coronavirus with a SARS virus. The SARS virus had been changed to grow in mice and copy human disease. The hybrid virus was able to infect human cells.\nIn 2017, a team from the Institute found that coronaviruses from horseshoe bats at a cave in Yunnan had all the genetic pieces of the SARS virus. They said this could be the source, and that the human SARS virus probably came from this cave. The team studied the bats for five years. They said there was a village only a kilometer away, and because of this there was the risk of another bat virus like SARS affecting people.\n2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic.\nIn December 2019, cases of pneumonia linked with an unknown coronavirus were reported to health authorities in Wuhan. The Institute checked its coronavirus collection and found the new virus was 96 percent identical to a sample its researchers had taken from horseshoe bats in southwest China.\nA team at the Institute were the first to identify, analyze and name the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). They made it available for scientists around the world to study. "}

There is also an extinct genus of bats, \"Palaeonycteris.\" Horseshoe bats are closely related to the Hipposideridae. Horseshoe bats are divided into six subgenera and many species groups. The common ancestor of all horseshoe bats lived 34\u201340\u00a0million years ago. Horseshoe bats are found mostly in tropical or subtropical areas, including Africa, Asia, Europe, and Oceania.\nHorseshoe bats are a source of disease. Several species are the source of SARS coronavirus. Some evidence suggests that some species could be the source of SARS-CoV-2, which causes coronavirus disease 2019. The bats are hunted for food in several regions, particularly Sub-Saharan Africa, but also Southeast Asia. Some species or their guano are used in traditional medicine in Nepal, India, Vietnam, and Senegal.\nDescription.\nHorseshoe bats are a small to medium-sized microbat. They weigh , with their forearms being in length. Their combined head and body lengths is . Their fur can be reddish-brown, blackish, or bright orange-red, with a majority of species having long, smooth fur. \nThey have large wings compared to their size, and the shape of the wings means they are able to make quick, tight turns at slow speeds.(p361) \nThey get their common name from their large noses (nose-leafs), which are shaped like horseshoes. The nose-leafs help with echolocation; the bats use their nose to make a constant frequency, high-duty call to find their prey. They hunt insects and spiders. Little is known about their mating systems, but at least one species is monogamous, while another is polygynous. Gestation is about seven weeks and one baby is produced at a time. Bats live for six or seven years, but one greater horseshoe bat lived more than 30 years.\nSome species of bats are solitary, and roost alone, while others live in groups of several thousand.(p xi) "}

In monarchies, the monarch was often considered the \"father/mother of the nation\" or as a patriarch to guide his family.

The title \"Father of the Nation\" however is politically contested, e.g. in 1972 the Constitution of Bangladesh declared Sheikh Mujibur Rahman to be \"father of the nation\".

{"id": "757742", "revid": "1029354", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=757742", "title": "Murder of Ahmaud Arbery", "text": "Ahmaud Arbery was a 25-year-old African American who was shot and killed while running in Satilla Shores near the town of Brunswick in Georgia on February 23, 2020. His death became famous because a video of the shooting showed up on the internet, because of an #IRunWithMaud Twitter campaign, because there was a long delay before the men who shot him were arrested, and because his death and their arrests happened around the same time as the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor and the Black Lives Matter protests. Floyd and Taylor are African Americans who were killed by police.\nThe three men who chased Arbery were charged with nine crimes, including murder. Their hearings and trials were delayed many times because of the COVID-19 pandemic. On November 24, 2021, all three men were found guilty of murder.\nShooting.\nOn February 23, Gregory McMichael, 64 years old, and his son Travis, 34 years old, saw Arbery running through the neighborhood. They said they thought he looked like the same man who had been breaking into houses nearby. They got their guns and got into their truck to chase Arbery. Another man, William Bryan, came with them in his own car. There was some kind of fight, during which Arbery was shot and killed. According to the Georgia Board of Investigation, Travis, not Gregory, shot Arbery. Gregory McMichael said that Arbery had attacked Travis. According to Arbery's family and friends, he was running for exercise and was in Santilla Shores because he lived nearby.\nArrests and hearings.\nOn May 5, a video showing the shooting was released to the public. Gregory and Travis McMichael were arrested on May 7. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) both said it was bad that it had taken so long. The McMichaels are both white.\nThe McMichaels and William Bryan had their first hearing at Glynn County Magistrate Court on June 4, 2020. They appeared by video instead of in person because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Judge Wallace E. Harrell said there was enough evidence for all three men to go to trial. \nOn June 24, 2020, District Attorney Holmes told the public that a grand jury had indicted all three men on nine crimes: one count each of malice murder (intentional murder), false imprisonment, criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment, two counts of aggravated assault and four counts of felony murder. The highest possible punishment for these crimes is life in prison without parole.\nOn July 17, all three men pleaded not guilty. Chatham County Superior Court Judge Timothy Walmsley decided not to release William Bryan on bail because he was worried Bryan would run away. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is also investigating Bryan for sex crimes.\nOn November 13, a judge denied bail for Gregory and Travis McMichaels. This means they must stay in jail until their trial. They may not return home or prepare for their trial outside of jail.\nDelay.\nOn February 23, Prosecutor George E. Barnhill wrote a letter to the Glynn County police saying he thought the police should not arrest the McMichaels. He said they had been in \"hot pursuit\" of Arbery, that they had a good reason to believe Arbery had committed a crime, and had told him out loud to stop running. In Georgia, it is legal for ordinary people to stop and hold a suspected criminal until the police arrive.\nAs of mid-May, four district attorneys had worked on this case one after the other. Because Gregory McMichael had worked as a police officer and worked for the Brunswick district attorney's office, it was difficult to find a district attorney who could charge McMichael with a crime. In the United States, prosecutors are not allowed to prosecute people they know, only strangers. The first one, Jackie Johnson, recused herself, meaning she willingly left the case, because she had worked with Gregory McMichael. The second district attorney who tried to work on the case, George E. Barnhill recused himself after Arbery's mother found out Barnhill's son had worked with Gregory McMichael.\nThe third prosecutor to work on the case, Tom Durden, came from Georgia's Atlantic Judicial Circuit. On May 5, he asked the Georgia Board of Investigation to find the facts. Durden decided to begin criminal processes against the McMichaels later that week.\nOn May 7, 2020, Gregory and Travis McMichael were arrested and brought to a Georgia jail. They were charged with felony murder and aggravated assault.\nBecause of the COVID-19 pandemic, the state of Georgia decided not to have any more grand juries until June 2020. In the United States, a grand jury decides whether a suspected criminal should have a trial based on how much evidence there is. If they say yes, the suspects are given a trial. If they say no, the suspects are set free.\nOn May 11, Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr put district attorney Joyette M. Holmes on the case. She is the fourth district attorney to work on the Ahmaud Arbery shooting case.\nTravis McMichael hired the lawyers Bob Rubin and Jason Sheffield and Gregory McMichael hired Laura Hogue and Frank Hogue. Both sets of lawyers asked the public not to make decisions yet.\nLaw.\nBefore recusing himself, Barnhill said it is legal in Georgia for the McMichaels to take their guns and chase someone if they believe that person is a criminal trying to escape being caught, but the crime must be a felony, or large crime. It is also legal for them to defend themselves if that person attacks them.\nThe law reads: \"A private person may arrest an offender if the offense is committed in his presence or within his immediate knowledge. If the offense is a felony and the offender is escaping or attempting to escape, a private person may arrest him upon reasonable and probable grounds of suspicion.\" This is called a citizen's arrest law.\nGregory McMichael said that he and his son chased Arbery because he looked like a thief from a string of break-ins that had happened nearby, but the local police said that there had not been a string of break-ins.\nIf Arbery entered a house but left without stealing anything or harming anyone, then he might be guilty of trespassing, which is a misdemeanor crime, or small crime, but not of any felony crime.\nVideo.\nThe video that appeared May 5 was filmed from a moving car or truck that was following the McMichaels' white truck. The video shows a black man running on the right side of the truck. Then he crosses in front of the truck and cannot be seen. Then there is some kind of fight, and three gunshots. Then the black man falls to the ground.\nA man named William Roddy Bryan recorded the video. He gave a copy to the police and then gave a copy to a lawyer named Alan Tucker. Tucker later gave the video to the radio station WGIG. The people at WGIG said it was from an anonymous source.\nOn May 8, Alan Tucker said he was the one who gave the video to the radio station. The McMichaels had talked to Tucker about Tucker working as their lawyer, which he later decided not to do because he knew Gregory McMichael from his work. Tucker said he gave the video to WGIG so people could see exactly what happened. \"It wasn't two men with a Confederate flag in the back of a truck going down the road and shooting a jogger in the back. It got the truth out there as to what you could see,\" said Tucker. \"My purpose was not to exonerate them or convict them.\"\nThe Georgia Bureau of Investigation began to investigate William Bryan. A lawyer for Arbery's family said that Bryan must have been helping the McMichaels chase Arbery. In a police report made the day of the shooting, Gregory McMichael told a Glynn County police officer that Bryan had tried to stop Arbery from running away from them. In late May, Bryan was arrested and charged with criminal attempt to commit false imprisonment and felony murder. Under U.S. law, that means that if Bryan was helping the McMichaels commit a serious crime, then deaths that happened during that crime are Bryan's fault as well, even if he did not shoot anyone himself.\nIn May, another video taken on February 23 was released to the public. It showed Arbery entering a house under construction, looking around, and leaving. The man who owned the house, Larry English, told CNN that nothing had been stolen.\nProtests.\nOn May 8, thousands of people ran 2.23\u00a0miles (2 for the month of February and .23 for the 23rd day of February, the date Arbery died). May 8 is Arbery's birthday, and he would have turned 26 years old if he had not died. Many of the runners posted the hashtag #IRunWithMaud on social media. Jason Vaughn and Akeem Baker invented the hashtag. Vaughn was the running coach at Arbery's high school and Baker was Arbery's friend. They both said Arbery was an excellent runner and racer.\nIn June, at the same time as the George Floyd protests, the Georgia NAACP planned a March on Georgia. Thousands of people marched to the Georgia state capitol building to stop police brutality. The marchers also said they were marching because Georgia had made it harder for black people to vote by closing so many voting places that the ones that were left had very long lines, because they think Georgia's citizens arrest laws are unfair, because of the killings of Rayshard Brooks, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd. The Georgia citizens arrest law is what the McMichaels claim made it legal for them to chase and try to stop Arbery.\nAutopsy.\nThe state of Georgia performed an autopsy on Ahmaud Arbery's body. They found he had been shot twice in the chest and once on his wrist and had not taken any drugs or alcohol. The autopsy report said Arbery had died in a homicide, meaning a killing of one human by other humans.\nAftermath.\nOn June 24, after the shooting but before any trials, the Georgia State Senate passed a law against hate crimes. Many American states already had hate crime laws, but Georgia did not. Hate crime laws make it a separate, additional crime to harm someone because of what group they belong to or look like they belong to.\nTrials.\nAt first, no date was set for the trials of Arbery's killers. This was because of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic. McMichael, McMichael and Bryan waited for their trials in jail. On October 18, 2021, jury selection for the trial began. The jury would have eleven white people and one black person. The trial lasted about two weeks. Lawyers for the three men said that they were only protecting their neighborhood. They said the accused men thought Arbery was dangerous. Travis McMichael got on the stand and spoke to the jury, saying he shot Arbery in self-defense. On November 24, the jury found all three men guilty on most of the counts, including felony murder."}

He focused on fields such as forensic anthropology, genetics, and also organized existing information in databases. He has written over 100 published articles, and his research has led the fields of physical and forensic anthropology. Jantz is currently a professor for the Department of Anthropology at the University of Tennessee. \nBackground.\nRichard Jantz grew up in central Kansas, and went to Kansas University. At school, he found that his strengths lay in statistical analysis. \nResearch.\nJantz's recent research involves measuring the differences in bone size and shape between different Native American tribes. In this research, he challenged work done by Franz Boas, a founder of modern anthropology. The original study, done by Boas in the early 1900s, showed that children born in America had bones closer to other American adults, and children born in Europe had bones closer to those of other Europeans. In 2002, Jantz did his own study to test Boas' findings. He writes that he found no significant difference between the bones of American and European children, but his study receives criticism from many other anthropologists. \nA well-respected anthropologist, Jonathan Marks, said that Jantz's new research \"has the ring of desperation to it (if not obfuscation), and has been quickly rebutted by more mainstream biological anthropology.\" Later, other anthropologists also looked back over Boas' study and found that he was actually correct. \nRichard Jantz has also worked to advance scientific methods of determining sex based on bone shape. He has worked with many Native American remains to organize data in large computer databases. \nJantz played a large role in the discovery and legal battle over a prehistoric skeleton called the Kennewick Man, suing the government to get more access to it for research. He argued that since the skeleton was radiocarbon dated to about 9,000 years old, no modern-day Native American tribes could really claim the skeletons as their own under the NAGPRA law. \nHe worked to identify the crew of a confederate shipwreck found near South Carolina, and was part of a reexamination of the Nikumaroro bones to determine if they could have belonged to Amelia Earhart."}

{"id": "757835", "revid": "54777", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=757835", "title": "Condorcet method", "text": "A Condorcet method (; ) is one of many election methods that elects the candidate that is preferred by more voters than their opponent in every head-to-head election against each of the other candidates, whenever there is such a candidate. This candidate, known as the \"pairwise champion\" or \"beats-all winner\", is formally called the \"Condorcet winner\".\nA Condorcet winner might not always exist in a particular election because the preference of a group of voters selecting from more than two options can possibly be cyclic \u2014 that is, it is possible (but very rare) that every candidate has an opponent that defeats them in a two-candidate contest. (This is similar to the game rock paper scissors, where each hand shape wins against only one opponent and loses to another). The possibility of such cyclic preferences in a group of voters is known as the Condorcet paradox. However, there always exists a smallest group of candidates that beats all candidates not in the group, known as the Smith set, which is guaranteed to only have the Condorcet winner in it when one exists; many Condorcet methods always elect a candidate who is in the Smith set when there is no Condorcet winner, and are thus said to be \"Smith-efficient\". The Condorcet winner is also usually but not necessarily the utilitarian winner (the one which maximizes social welfare).\nCondorcet voting methods are named for the 18th-century French mathematician and philosopher Marie Jean Antoine Nicolas Caritat, the Marquis de Condorcet, who championed such voting systems. However, Ramon Llull devised the earliest known Condorcet method in 1299. It always elects the same candidate as Copeland's method in cases with no pairwise ties.\nCondorcet methods usually use preferential (ranked) voting, though they can be done with separate rounds of runoff elections.\nMost Condorcet methods have a single round of preferential voting, in which each voter ranks the candidates from most preferred (marked as number 1) to least preferred (marked with a higher number). A voter's ranking is often called their \"order of preference.\" The votes can be tallied in many ways to find a winner. Some - the Condorcet methods - will elect the Condorcet winner if there is one. They can also elect a winner when there is no Condorcet winner, and different Condorcet-compliant methods may elect different winners in the case of a cycle.\nThe procedure given in Robert's Rules of Order for voting on motions and amendments is also a Condorcet method, even though the voters do not vote by ranking the candidates. There are multiple rounds of voting, and in each round the vote is between two of the alternatives. The loser (by majority rule) of a pairing is eliminated, and the winner of a pairing is paired in a later round against another alternative. Eventually only one alternative remains, and it is the winner. This is similar to a single-winner or round-robin tournament; the total number of pairings is one less than the number of alternatives. Since a Condorcet winner will win by majority rule in each of its pairings, it will never be eliminated by Robert's Rules. But this method cannot reveal a voting paradox in which there is no Condorcet winner and a majority prefer an early loser over the eventual winner (though it will always elect someone in the Smith set). A lot of the literature on social choice theory is about this method since it is widely used and is used by important organizations (legislatures, councils, committees, etc.). It is not practical for use in public elections, however, since its multiple rounds of voting would be very expensive for voters, for candidates, and for governments.\nSummary.\nIn a competition between candidates A and B where voters have ranked the candidates, if more voters mark their ballots that they prefer candidate A over candidate B than the number of voters who mark their ballots to the contrary, then Candidate B is not (supposed to be) elected.\nHowever, because of the possibility of the Condorcet paradox, it is possible, but unlikely, that this can't be done. This is sometimes called a \"Condorcet cycle\" or just \"cycle\" and can be thought of as Candidate Rock beating Candidate Scissors, Candidate Scissors beating Candidate Paper, and Candidate Paper beating Candidate Rock. If there is no cycle (and no ties), all Condorcet methods elect the same candidate.\nFor most Condorcet methods, the pairwise counts are all that is necessary to figure out who won, who came in 2nd place, etc. and can be used to figure out if there is a Condorcet winner, and who it is.\nDefinition.\nA Condorcet method is a voting system that will always elect the Condorcet winner (if there is one); this is the candidate whom more voters prefer to each other candidate, when compared to them one at a time. This candidate can be found by checking if there is a candidate who beats all other candidates; this can be done by using Copeland's method and then checking if the Copeland winner has the highest possible Copeland score.\nNote that there are \u00bd\"N\"(\"N\"\u22121) pairwise comparisons for \"N\" candidates. For 10 candidates, this means there are 0.5*10*9=45 comparisons, which can make elections with many candidates hard to count the votes for.\nIn some situations, an election has no Condorcet winner. This occurs as a result of a kind of tie known as a \"majority rule cycle\", described by Condorcet's paradox. Different Condorcet methods pick different winners in these situations. Some Condorcet methods involve the basic procedure described below, coupled with a Condorcet completion method, which is used to find a winner when there is no Condorcet winner. Other Condorcet methods involve an entirely different system of counting, but are classified as Condorcet methods because they will still elect the Condorcet winner if there is one.\nIt is important to note that not all single winner, ranked voting systems are Condorcet methods. For example, instant-runoff voting and the Borda count are not Condorcet methods.\nBasic procedure.\nFinding the winner.\nIn any Condorcet method that passes Independence of Smith-dominated alternatives, it can sometimes help to identify the Smith set from the head-to-head matchups, and eliminate all candidates not in the set before doing the procedure for that Condorcet method.\nCondorcet methods use pairwise counting. For each possible pair of candidates, one pairwise count indicates how many voters prefer one of the paired candidates over the other candidate, and another pairwise count indicates how many voters have the opposite preference. The counts for all possible pairs of candidates show all the pairwise preferences of all the voters.\nPairwise counts are often displayed in a \"pairwise comparison matrix\" or \"outranking matrix\" such as those below. In these matrices, each row represents each candidate as a 'runner', while each column represents each candidate as an 'opponent'. The cells at the intersection of rows and columns each show the result of a particular pairwise comparison. Cells comparing a candidate to themselves are left blank.\nImagine there is an election between four candidates: A, B, C and D. The first matrix below records the preferences expressed on a single ballot paper, in which the voter's preferences are (B, C, A, D); that is, the voter ranked B first, C second, A third, and D fourth. In the matrix a '1' indicates that the runner is preferred on this voter's ballot over the 'opponent', while a '0' indicates that the runner is defeated. For example, in the following matrix, A beats D:\nUsing a matrix like the one above, one can find the overall results of an election. Each ballot can be transformed into this style of matrix, and then added to all other ballot matrices using matrix addition. The sum of all ballots in an election is called the sum matrix.\nSuppose that in the imaginary election there are two other voters. Their preferences are (D, A, C, B) and (A, C, B, D). Added to the first voter, these ballots would give the following sum matrix:\nWhen the sum matrix is found, the contest between each pair of candidates is considered. The number of votes for runner over opponent (runner,opponent) is compared with the number of votes for opponent over runner (opponent,runner) to find the Condorcet winner. In the sum matrix above, A is the Condorcet winner because A beats every other candidate. When there is no Condorcet winner, many Condorcet completion methods, such as Ranked Pairs and the Schulze method, use the information contained in the sum matrix to choose a winner.\nCells marked '\u2014' in the matrices above have a numerical value of '0', but a dash is used since candidates are never preferred to themselves. The first matrix, that represents a single ballot, is inversely symmetric: (runner,opponent) is \u00ac(opponent,runner). Or (runner,opponent) + (opponent,runner) = 1. The sum matrix has this property: (runner,opponent) + (opponent,runner) = N for N voters, if all runners were fully ranked by each voter.\nExample: Voting on the location of Tennessee's capital.\nImagine that Tennessee is having an election on the location of its capital. The population of Tennessee is concentrated around its four major cities, which are spread throughout the state. For this example, suppose that the entire electorate lives in these four cities and that everyone wants to live as near to the capital as possible.\nThe candidates for the capital are:\nThe preferences of the voters would be divided like this:\nTo find the Condorcet winner every candidate must be matched against every other candidate in a series of one-on-one contests. In each pairing the winner is the candidate preferred by a majority of voters. The results for every possible pairing are as follows:\nThe results can also be shown in the form of a matrix:\nAs can be seen from both of the tables above, Nashville beats every other candidate. This means that Nashville is the Condorcet winner. So Nashville would win an election held under any Condorcet method.\nWhile any Condorcet method will elect Nashville as the winner, first-past-the-post and instant-runoff voting would select Memphis and Knoxville respectively, using the same ballots. This would occur despite the fact that most people would have preferred Nashville to either of those options. Condorcet methods make these preferences obvious rather than ignoring or discarding them.\nOn the other hand, note that in this example Chattanooga also defeats Knoxville and Memphis when paired against those cities. If Memphis voters had preferred Chattanooga as a second choice rather than as a third choice, then Chattanooga would be the Condorcet winner even though finishing in last place in a first-past-the-post election.\nAn alternative way of thinking about this example if a Smith-efficient Condorcet method that passes ISDA is used to determine the winner is that 58% of the voters, a mutual majority, ranked Memphis last (making Memphis the majority loser and Nashville, Chattanooga, and Knoxville above Memphis, ruling Memphis out. At that point, the voters who preferred Memphis as their 1st choice could only help to choose a winner among Nashville, Chattanooga, and Knoxville, and because they all preferred Nashville as their 1st choice among those three, Nashville would've had a 68% majority of 1st choices among the remaining candidates and won as the majority's 1st choice.\nTwo-method systems.\nSome Condorcet methods first do a series of pairwise comparisons and then, if there is no Condorcet winner, use an entirely different, non-Condorcet method to determine a winner. The simplest such fall-back methods completely ignore the results of the pairwise comparisons. For example, the Black method chooses the Condorcet winner if it exists, but uses the Borda count instead if there is a cycle (the method is named for Duncan Black).\nA more complex two-stage process is, when there is a cycle, to first eliminate all candidates not in some group which is found by looking at the pairwise comparisons, and then use a separate voting system to find the winner. Sets used for this purpose are defined so that they will always contain only the Condorcet winner if there is one, and will always, in any case, contain at least one candidate. Such sets include the\nSingle-method systems.\nSome Condorcet methods use a single procedure that meets the Condorcet criteria and, without any extra procedure, also pick winners when there are cycles. In other words, these methods do not involve separate procedures for different situations. Typically these methods base their calculations on pairwise counts. These methods include:\nCondorcet ranking methods.\nSome Condorcet methods produce not just a single winner, but a ranking of all candidates from first to last place. A Condorcet ranking is a list of candidates with the property that the Condorcet winner (if one exists) comes first and the Condorcet loser (if one exists) comes last, and the same holds for the candidates ranked between them.\nMethods that satisfy this property include:\nThough there won't always be a Condorcet winner or Condorcet loser, there is always a Smith set and \"Smith loser set\" (smallest group of candidates who lose to all candidates not in the set in head-to-head elections). Some voting methods produce rankings that sort all candidates in the Smith set above all others, and all candidates in the Smith loser set below all others, with this also applying to all candidates ranked between them. Because the Smith set and Smith loser set are equivalent to the Condorcet winner and Condorcet loser when they exist, methods that always produce Smith set rankings also always produce Condorcet rankings.\nComparison with instant runoff and first-past-the-post (plurality).\nMany proponents of instant-runoff voting (IRV) are attracted by the belief that if their first choice does not win, their vote will be given to their second choice; if their second choice does not win, their vote will be given to their third choice, etc. This sounds perfect, but it is not true for every voter with IRV. If someone voted for a strong candidate, and their 2nd and 3rd choices are eliminated before their first choice is eliminated, IRV gives their vote to their 4th choice candidate, not their 2nd choice. Condorcet voting takes all rankings into account simultaneously, but this makes it fail the later-no-harm criterion and the later-no-help criterion. With IRV, indicating a second choice will never hurt your first choice. With Condorcet voting, it is possible that indicating a second choice will cause your first choice to lose.\nPlurality voting is simple, and theoretically provides incentives for voters to compromise for centrist candidates rather than throw away their votes on candidates who can't win. Opponents to plurality voting point out that voters often vote for the lesser of evils because they heard on the news that those two are the only two with a chance of winning, not necessarily because those two are the two good compromise candidates. This gives the media significant election powers. Condorcet runs each candidate against the other head to head, so that voters elect the candidate who would win the most sincere runoffs, instead of the one they thought they had to vote for.\nThere are circumstances, as in the examples above, when both instant-runoff voting and the 'first-past-the-post' plurality system wouldn't elect the Condorcet winner. (In fact, FPTP can elect the Condorcet loser and IRV can elect the second-worst candidate, who would lose to every candidate except the Condorcet loser.) When there is a Condorcet winner that IRV doesn't elect, a majority would by definition prefer the Condorcet Winner to the IRV winner. Supporters of the Condorcet criterion see it as an important criterion when choosing a voting method. They see the Condorcet criterion as a natural extension of majority rule. Condorcet methods tend to encourage the selection of broadly supported candidates who appeal to the median voter. Here is an example that is designed to support IRV while making Condorcet look bad:\n499 A&gt;B&gt;C\n3 B&gt;C&gt;A\n498 C&gt;B&gt;A\nB is preferred by a 501\u2013499 majority to A, and by a 502\u2013498 majority to C. So, according to the Condorcet criterion, B should win, despite the fact that very few voters rank B in first place. By contrast, IRV elects C and plurality elects A. The goal of a ranked voting system is for voters to be able to vote sincerely and trust the system to protect their intent.\nThe importance of this scenario, of two parties with strong support, and the one with weak support being the Condorcet winner, may be less than one would expect, though, as it is common in plurality voting systems (see Duverger's law), but much less likely to occur in Condorcet or IRV elections, which unlike Plurality voting, punish candidates who are opposed by a significant block of voters.\nHere is an example that is designed to support Condorcet while making IRV look bad:\n33 A&gt;B&gt;C\n16 B&gt;A&gt;C\n16 B&gt;C&gt;A\n35 C&gt;B&gt;A\nB would win against either A or C by more than a 65\u201335 margin in a one-on-one election, but IRV eliminates B first, leaving a contest between the more \"polar\" candidates, A and C. Proponents of plurality voting state that their system is simpler than any other and more easily understood.\nAll three systems are susceptible to tactical voting, but the types of strategy used and how often there is value in voting strategically differ in each method.\nPotential for tactical voting.\nLike all voting methods, Condorcet methods are vulnerable to compromising. That is, voters can help avoid the election of a less-preferred candidate by insincerely (strategically) raising the position of a more-preferred candidate on their ballot. However, Condorcet methods are only vulnerable to compromising when there is a majority rule cycle, or when one can be created.\nAll Condorcet methods are at least somewhat vulnerable to burying. That is, voters can sometimes help a more-preferred candidate by strategically lowering the ranking of a less-preferred candidate on their ballot.\nEvaluation by criteria.\nScholars of electoral systems often compare them using mathematically defined voting system criteria. The criteria which Condorcet methods satisfy vary from one Condorcet method to another. However, the Condorcet criterion implies the majority criterion, and thus is incompatible with independence of irrelevant alternatives (though it implies a weaker analagous form of the criterion: when there is a Condorcet winner, losing candidates can drop out of the election without changing the result), later-no-harm, the participation criterion, and the consistency criterion.\nUse of Condorcet voting.\nCondorcet methods are not known to be currently in use in government elections anywhere in the world, but a Condorcet method known as Nanson's method was used in city elections in the U.S. town of Marquette, Michigan in the 1920s, and today Condorcet methods are used by a number of private organizations. Organizations which currently use some variant of the Condorcet method are:"}

The method of pairwise comparison is used in the scientific study of preferences, attitudes, voting systems, social choice, public choice, requirements engineering and multiagent AI systems. In psychology literature, it is often referred to as paired comparison.\nOverview.\nIf someone shows what they like more between two options, this preference can be expressed as a pairwise comparison. If the two alternatives are \"x\" and \"y\", these three pairwise comparisons are possible:\nThe person prefers \"x\" over \"y\": \"\"x\"\u00a0&gt;\u00a0\"y\" or \"xPy\"\nThe person prefers \"y\" over \"x\": \"y\"\u00a0&gt;\u00a0\"x\" or \"yPx\"\nThe person has no preference between both alternatives: \"x\"\u00a0=\u00a0\"y\" or \"xIy\"\"\nTransitivity.\nIt is generally assumed that pairwise comparisons are transitive. Most agree on what transitivity is, though there is debate about the transitivity of indifference. The rules of transitivity are as follows.\nThis is linked to (xPy or xIy) being a total preorder, P being the related strict weak order, and I being the related equivalence relation.\nArgument for intransitivity of indifference.\nSome believe that indifference (lack of preference) is not transitive. Consider the following example. Suppose you like apples and you prefer apples that are larger. Now suppose there exists an apple A, an apple B, and an apple C that are the same except for the following. Suppose B is larger than A, but it is not possible to see this without an extremely sensitive measuring device. Also suppose C is larger than B, but this also can't be seen without a sensitive measuring device. However, the difference in sizes between apples A and C is large enough that you can see it. In psychophysical terms, the size difference between A and C is above the just noticeable difference ('jnd') while the size differences between A and B and B and C are below the jnd.\nYou are confronted with the three apples in pairs without a sensitive measuring device. Because of this, when shown only A and B, you have no preference between apple A and apple B; and you are indifferent between apple B and apple C when shown only B and C. However, when the pair A and C are shown, you prefer C over A.\nPreference orders.\nIf pairwise comparisons are transitive by the four rules shown above, then pairwise comparisons for a list of alternatives (\"A\"1,\u00a0\"A\"2,\u00a0\"A\"3,\u00a0...,\u00a0\"A\"\"n\"\u22121, and \"A\"\"n\") can take the form:\nFor example, if there are three alternatives \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\", then the 13 possible preference orders are:\nIf the number of alternatives is n, and indifference is not allowed, then the number of possible preference orders for any given \"n\"-value is\u00a0\"n\"!. If indifference is allowed, then the number of possible preference orders is the number of total preorders. It can be expressed as a function of n:\nwhere \"S\"2(\"n\",\u00a0\"k\") is the Stirling number of the second kind."}

Until 1920, Ireland was ruled directly by the British government. British members of parliament tried to pass bills for Home Rule in 1896, 1893, and 1912, but they never got enough votes to pass. Irish Nationalists supported Home Rule, and Irish Unionists opposed it.\nThe 1886 bill was supported by the Liberal Party, but did not get enough votes in the House of Commons. The 1893 bill got enough votes to pass in the House of Commons, but not the House of Lords. William Gladstone was an important supporter of both. The 1912 bill also passed in the House of Commons, but not the House of Lords. In 1912, Unionists in Ulster signed a document called the Ulster Covenant, and made an army called the Ulster Volunteers, to fight against Home Rule.\nAlthough many Nationalists wanted Home Rule, some thought it was not good enough. Most members of the party Sinn F\u00e9in wanted Ireland to be completely separate from Great Britain. Sinn F\u00e9in became the most powerful party in 1916 and made their own government in Dublin, the D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann. Irish Nationalists fought in the Irish War of Independence against the British government from 1919-1921. In 1920, Britain passed a law that said there would be two parliaments, one for Northern Ireland, and one for Southern Ireland. This was a form of Home Rule. However, the Southern Ireland parliament never met. The war did not end until the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty, which created the Irish Free State. The Irish Free State still had the same king as Britain, but had a separate government."}

The episode was watched by 1.84 million people when it was first shown on television.\nPlot.\nThe Simpson family are eating at a vegan restaurant, wanting Lisa to pick them for a project at school. She chooses Professor Frink because he wants to help the world with science. At Springfield University, Lisa interviews Professor Frink. Frink says he is making a new cryptocurrency called Frinkcoin.\nFrinkcoin becomes well known, making Frink the richest man in Springfield. Mr. Burns is angry because he is no longer the richest man in Springfield. Frink feels lonely, so Marge says that he should go to Moe's Tavern. Frink gets every question correct in Moe's trivia questions, so they become friends with Frink. Frink shows his friends Springfield's best places. Smithers gets a team of people to create a cryptocurrency for Mr. Burns. The team creates an equation to make Frinkcoin worth nothing, but it will take thousands of years to calculate. Instead, Mr. Burns tells Frink that his friends only like him because he is rich.\nBurns brings the equation to Springfield for a crowdsourcing solution. Frink finds out that his friends only like him because he is rich. Frink solves the equation himself, but only Lisa knows. Frink loses all of his money, but he is happy to be friends with Lisa and to go back to his university. \nReception.\nDennis Perkins of \"The A.V.

The criterion says that \"if one candidate is liked more by a majority (more than 50%) of voters than all other candidates, then that candidate must win\".\nSome voting methods that pass this criterion include any Condorcet method, instant-runoff voting, Bucklin voting, and plurality voting.\nSupporters of other voting systems say that the majority criterion is actually bad, since it can lead to a tyranny of the majority where a candidate is elected who is loved by a little over half of the population and hated by everyone else. Other systems may be better at electing consensus candidates who have broader support, which is argued to make them better representatives of the population as a whole. These are described as \"utilitarian\" or \"consensus-seeking\" rather than \"majoritarian\". Peter Emerson supports Borda count variants, and believes that majority rule is fundamentally flawed and leads to problems such as bitterness, division, and violence, citing Northern Ireland and Bosnia as examples. Note however that in a utilitarian system, when no broadly supported candidate exists, that a minority can beat a majority because their candidate had slightly more support; because of this, utilitarian methods may not always increase consensus.\nThe mutual majority criterion is a more broad form of the majority criterion which allows a majority to prefer multiple candidates over all of the other candidates, rather than only one; voting methods which pass the majority criterion but fail mutual majority can encourage all but one of the majority's preferred candidates to exit the election so that one of the majority-preferred candidates wins, creating a spoiler effect. The common choose-one First-past-the-post voting method is notable for this, because major political parties often attempt to prevent more than one of their candidates from running and splitting the vote, by using primary elections.\nComparison with the Condorcet criterion.\nThe majority criterion says that a candidate X should win if a majority of voters say \"Yes\" to the question 'Do you like X more than every other candidate?'.\nThe Condorcet criterion is stronger. It says that a candidate X should win if for every other candidate Y, more voters agree that they prefer X over Y than the number of voters who prefer Y to X.\nSatisfaction of the Condorcet criterion implies that of the majority criterion, but not vice versa. With the Condorcet criterion there may be different majorities depending on who X and Y are, but the majority criterion only applies when there is a single majority which has X as their first choice, preferred over every other candidate."}

It is important for giving proportional representation for voters in multiple-winner ranked voting systems.\nSolid coalitions.\nA group of voters formula_1 is a \"solid coalition\" for a group of candidates formula_2, if every voter in formula_1 ranks every candidate in formula_2 ahead of every candidate that is not in formula_2.\nLet formula_6 be the number of voters, formula_7 be the number of seats to be filled and formula_8 be some positive number.\nformula_7\u2013PSC.\nformula_7\u2013PSC is based on the Hare quota formula_11. If formula_1 is a solid coalition for formula_2 and the number of voters in formula_1 is at least formula_8 Hare quotas, then at least formula_8 candidates from formula_2 must be elected (if formula_2 has less than formula_8 candidates at all, then all of them have to be elected). This criterion was created by Michael Dummett.\nformula_20\u2013PSC.\nformula_20\u2013PSC is defined like formula_7\u2013PSC, but is based on the Hagenbach-Bischoff quota formula_23 instead of the Hare quota, and the number of voters in formula_1 must exceed formula_8 Hagenbach-Bischoff quotas. It is a more general form of the majority criterion because it allows for groups of supported candidates (solid coalitions) instead of just one candidate, and there may be more than one candidate that will be elected. Because some authors call the fraction formula_23 a Droop quota, formula_20\u2013PSC is also known as the Droop proportionality criterion.\nDroop proportionality means that a majority-size solid coalition will always be able to elect at least half of the seats. This is because a majority is always over n/2 voters, and that will contain half of the Hagenbach-Bischoff quotas (There are (k+1) Hagenbach-Bischoff quotas in an election, since (n/(k+1)) * (k+1) = n, so (k+1)/2, which is half of the quotas * n/(k+1), which is the quota, = n/2)."}

It is in upper northeastern Thailand, also called Isan. Neighboring provinces are (from east clockwise) Nong Khai, Udon Thani, Nongbua Lamphu, Khon Kaen, Phetchabun, Phitsanulok. In the north it borders Xaignabouli and Vientiane Province of Laos.\n, the provincial governor is Chaiwat Chuenkosum. The province was given 225.6 million baht in the FY2019 Thailand budget.\nHistory.\nTradition says that Loei was created by people from Chiang Saen, the capital of Lan Na. Khun Pha Muang created the village of Dan-kwa, and Bang Klang Hao created Dan Sai. Drought and disease later made to the people move to the site of present-day Loei. In 1907 King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) created the Loei Province. The Loei Cultural Centre (\u0e28\u0e39\u0e19\u0e22\u0e4c\u0e27\u0e31\u0e12\u0e19\u0e18\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21\u0e08\u0e31\u0e07\u0e2b\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\u0e40\u0e25\u0e22) shows Loei's history, religions, and traditions.\nGeography.\nThe land has many mountains. The seat of provincial government, Loei, is in a fertile basin where mountains are all around it. The most famous mountains in the province are Phu Kradueng, Phu Luang, and Phu Ruea. The Loei River, which flows through the province, is a tributary of the Mekong, which creates part of the northern border of the province with neighboring Laos. Phu Thap Buek, the tallest mountain of the Phetchabun Range, is in the province.\nThe mountain Phu Kradueng is in Phu Kradueng National Park (\u0e2d\u0e38\u0e17\u0e22\u0e32\u0e19\u0e41\u0e2b\u0e48\u0e07\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e15\u0e34\u0e20\u0e39\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e14\u0e36\u0e07).\nThe western part of the province reaches the southern end of the Luang Prabang Range mountain area of the Thai highlands.\nEconomy.\nAgriculture is an important part of Loei's economy. Macadamia nuts, passion fruit, and Arabica coffee are grown in the highlands; bananas, sesame, and rubber are grown on the plains. Loei is a popular place for tourists who want to look at the environment. This is because of Loei's natural environment and amalgam of northern and northeastern cultures.\nWang Saphung District has a big open pit gold mine that employs many people. The area has been the place of a long-standing disagreement as well as fights between the people of Ban Na Nong Bong and its environs and Tungkum Limited, a subsidiary of Tongkah Harbour PCL. Tungkum's gold mining work has been accused of environmental destruction in the courts.\nGovernment.\nProvincial government.\nThe province is divided into 14 districts (\"amphoe\"). The districts are further divided into 89 subdistricts (\"tambons\") and 839 villages (\"mubans\").\nLocal government.\nAs of 26 November 2019 there are: one Loei Provincial Administration Organisation (\"ongkan borihan suan changwat\") and 29 municipal (\"thesaban\") areas in the province. Loei with Wang Saphung have town (\"thesaban mueang\") status. Further 27 subdistrict municipalities (\"thesaban tambon\"). The non-municipal areas are governed by 71 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations - SAO (\"ongkan borihan suan tambon\").\nTransportation.\nRoute 201 comes from Chiang Khan in the north on the border with Laos. It goes through Loei, to Non Sa-at near Chum Phae. Route 203 leads west to the area of Phu Ruea, and then turns south to Lom Sak.\nLoei Airport is the local airport.\nSymbols.\nThe seal of the province shows the stupa at Phra That Si Song Rak, which was built in 1560 by King Maha Chakrapat of the Ayutthaya Kingdom and King Chai Chetha of Lan Xang. It was built as a symbol of friendship between the two kingdoms. The provincial tree is the Khasi pine (\"Pinus kesiya\").\nThe slogan of the province is \"city of the sea of mountains, coldest place in Siam, with beautiful flowers of three seasons.\"\nHuman achievement index 2017.\nSince 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has watched progress on human development for the provinces using the Human achievement index (HAI). The HAI is a list including all the eight key areas of human development. National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this job since 2017.\nNotes.\nReports (data) from Thai government are \"not copyrightable\" (Public Domain), Copyright Act 2537 (1994), section 7."}

Members of the NKVD killed about 22,000 Polish prisoners of war in a forest near Katyn, about from Smolensk. Most of the prisoners killed were officers. The Katyn massacre happened in April and May 1940. Stalin ordered it on Beria's advice. In 1990, the Soviet Union/Russia admitted it was responsible. In 1990, Mikhail Gorbachev officially apologised. The Katyn massacre is one in a series of similar massacres where up to 100,000 people were killed. Between 400 and 450 prisoners survived. People used their stories to change Soviet history books after the apology. \nIn the 1980s, Michail Gorbachev said that Beria and Vsevolod Merkulov were responsible. He said that the Katyn massacre was one of Stalin's atrocities. \nBeria was accused of treason. He was executed in 1953. Merkulov was also executed in 1953 for being close to Beria. Beria and Merkulov were never tried for what they did at Katyn."}

He defeated some neighboring tribes and then, in the spring of 568, Alboin led the Lombard migration into Italy. According to the \"History of the Lombards,\" \"Then the Langobards, having left Pannonia, hastened to take possession of Italy with their wives and children and all their goods.\"\nWhen they came to Italy, most of the Lombards still followed their old religion, but some were Arian Christians. Most of them later adopted Orthodox Christian views. In later years they fought with the Franks and later the Muslims. The Normans also fought with them between 1017 and 1078 A.D.

A Condorcet loser is a candidate who would lose a head-to-head competition against each other candidate. (Not all elections will have a Condorcet loser since it is possible for every candidate to lose against at least one other candidate head-to-head.)\nAny voting method that passes the Smith criterion will also pass the Condorcet loser criterion, because the Condorcet loser doesn't pairwise beat anyone, and so could not be in the Smith set.\nVoting methods that pass include: two-round system, instant-runoff voting (AV), contingent vote, borda count, Schulze method, ranked pairs, and Kemeny-Young method. Any voting method that ends in a runoff passes the criterion, because the Condorcet loser will lose in any head-to-head competition.\nVoting methods that don't pass include: plurality voting, supplementary voting, Sri Lankan contingent voting, approval voting, range voting, Bucklin voting and minimax Condorcet."}

It is also known as the majority criterion for solid coalitions and the generalized majority criterion. The criterion says that if a majority of voters like a group of candidates more than all of the other candidates, then one of the candidates in the group must win. This is similar to but but more broad than the majority criterion, where the group of candidates can only have one candidate in it. The Droop proportionality criterion is a more broad form of the mutual majority criterion, which also applies to multi-winner elections.\nThe Schulze method, ranked pairs, instant-runoff voting, Nanson's method, and Bucklin voting pass this criterion. All Smith-efficient Condorcet methods pass the mutual majority criterion.\nThe plurality vote, approval voting, range voting, the Borda count, and minimax fail this criterion.\nVoting methods which pass the majority criterion but fail mutual majority can have a spoiler effect, since if a minority-preferred candidate wins, and all of the candidates preferred by the majority, except for one, leave the election, then the remaining majority-preferred candidate will win instead."}

St Michael's school is an independent Catholic school. \nBurghclere is home to Sandham Memorial Chapel, which is a National Trust property that houses some of a 20th century artist Stanley Spencer's paintings.\nBurghclere has some beautiful rural scenery, so you can walk along the old railway, through many fields, or go for a hike. In the winter time, if it snows, Beacon Hill, or Jacob's Ladder, are where many young people and older people gather for snowballing or sledging.\nChurch of the Ascension is the church in Burghclere. Burghclere Primary School uses it for their Easter, Harvest and Christmas services. The Burghclere Primary School Brass Band occasionally plays at the church services. The church was consecrated in 1838. The church had a spire added and it was restored during 1874 / 1875 and reopened on 13th May 1875 (Ascension Day). There are six bells at the church, three were originally at All Saints church in the village of Newtown, another was acquired in 1838 and to commemorate the jubilees of Queen Victoria, two treble bells were added, one in 1887 and 1897.\nReferences.\nOpposite Burghclere Primary School, there is Burghclere Sports Club and an amazing children's playground. The Sports Club has a large field where people can take different games or sports equipment to play with. This is also where the children at Burghclere Primary School do their Cross Country Running. A new miniature railway is also being installed here."}

Usually, party leaders run in by-elections to get into the House of Commons, and represent the electoral area for a short time. Robichaud resigned as an MP so that Chr\u00e9tien could win a by-election. When there was an election in 1993, Chr\u00e9tien moved back to representing an area in Quebec and let Robichaud run for election in Beaus\u00e9jour again.\nChr\u00e9tien later recommended that Robichaud should become a member of the Senate. He officially joined the Senate on September 22, 1997. He stopped being a member of the Senate when he became 75 years old, on December 2, 2014.

By the time of Judith Quiney's death, she had outlived her children by many years.\nDied: 9 February 1662\nSpouse: Thomas Quiney\nSibling: Susanna Hall, Hamnet Shakespeare\nBorn: 2 February 1585\nChildren: Richard Quiney, Thomas Quiney, Shakespeare Quiney\nParents:William Shakespeare,Anne Hathaway\nLIFE\nOn the 10th February 1616 Shakespeare\u2019s younger daughter Judith married a local man, Thomas Quiney. At the start of 1616 her impending marriage must have been the cause of celebration in the family. Shakespeare first saw his lawyer to draft his will in January 1616. This is often taken to mean he was already ill, but with his daughters married or betrothed it was also a good time to ensure they would be provided for.Things started to go wrong soon after that first session with the lawyer. In the first drafting of the will, he is mentioned specifically with a bequest \u201cvnto my sonne in L[aw]\u201d. The marriage occurred outside the usual period for marriages (as Shakespeare\u2019s own had been). Anne Hathaway was already pregnant. This wasn\u2019t the case with Judith.Shakespeare\u2019s marriage had been arranged by license from Worcester, but in Judith\u2019s case no license was granted. Marrying without going through the proper procedures was frowned on, and both Judith and Thomas were excommunicated. None of this sounds like respectable behaviour, but worse was to come. Thomas might well have been in a hurry to marry Judith, because after the marriage it soon came out that he had previously had a mistress, Margaret Wheeler, who was pregnant with his child. To make matters worse, both Margaret and her baby died. Thomas was tried by the church court and sentenced to stand in front of the congregation of Holy Trinity church clad in a white sheet, for three Sundays.\nShakespeare saw his lawyer again on 25 March. One of the significant changes is that the reference to Thomas Quiney was struck out and Judith\u2019s name was inserted instead. Judith was to inherit \u00a3100, a cottage, and if she or her children were alive after three years a further \u00a3150 of which she should receive the interest, giving her and any children she might have an independent income. She also received Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cbroad silver gilt bole\u201d.Very little is known about Judith, but her life seems to have been full of disappointments. As far as we know she received no education, and lived in Stratford all her life. She and her twin brother Hamnet were born in 1585, but Hamnet died in August 1596. His death must have affected the whole family profoundly, not least Judith herself. This was the first of many sad events in her life, the next of which was the humiliation surrounding her marriage. She can not have been unaware of the comparison with her older sister Susanna who had already made a successful marriage to a highly-respected doctor and had a daughter. In Shakespeare\u2019s will, it\u2019s Susanna who inherits most of Shakespeare\u2019s wealth including his house New Place.\nShakespeare himself died in April 1616, only a few weeks after Judith\u2019s marriage and humiliation. In November Judith herself had a baby son, who was christened \u201cShakespeare\u201d, after her father. The baby lived for only six months, dying in May 1617. Infant mortality was high, and several of Shakespeare\u2019s own siblings had died as babies. Later, in 1618 and 1620, Judith had two more sons, Richard and Thomas. These two boys survived childhood but died within weeks of each other in 1639, aged 19 and 21, probably of plague. So Judith outlived all of her children, being buried on 9 February 1662 aged 77, while her husband died in 1662 or 1663. Thomas Quiney was by profession a vintner and tobacconist, and later became a leading member of the town\u2019s governing council, holding its highest office, Chamberlain, in 1621 and 1622. But unlike her sister and brother-in-law who had graves in the chancel of the church, Judith and Thomas were buried in the churchyard, the site is now unknown.The house in which Judith and Thomas Quiney lived still stands, but unlike Susannah\u2019s house Hall\u2019s Croft Shakespeare\u2019s Birthplace or the site of his grand house New Place it isn\u2019t a museum. It used to be known as \u201cThe Cage\u201d, and stands in the very centre of town at the junction of High Street and Bridge Street. In its time this building has been a prison, the \u201cShakespeare View Store\u201d, the town\u2019s Tourist Information Centre and now, a shop selling Crabtree and Evelyn toiletries."}

A Wuhan hospital told the local center for disease control and prevention (CDC) and health commissions on 27 December 2019.\nThe beginning.\nOn 31 December, the Wuhan CDC told the media that there was a large number of unknown pneumonia cases related to Huanan Seafood Market.\nThe possible disease outbreak soon became known nationwide including that of the National Health Commission (NHC) in Beijing who sent experts to Wuhan on the following day. Chinese authorities notified the World Health Organisation on this same day. On 8 January, a new coronavirus was identified as the cause of the pneumonia. \nGovernment response.\nPublic and media criticized Chinese officials for a slow response to fight the outbreak when it first started. By 29 January, the virus spread to all provinces of mainland China. All provinces of mainland China began a large public health emergency. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak a \"Public Health Emergency of International Concern\" on 31 January, saying that there are reasons that it could spread to other countries, such as those without robust healthcare systems. By 8 February, over 724 died from the coronavirus and 34,878 were confirmed to have been infected. In Hubei alone, there were 24,953 cases of infections and 699 related deaths.\nThe Chinese government may have censored talks about the outbreak since the beginning of its spread. On 25 January, Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping warned about a \"grave situation\" in China. \nThe Chinese New Year celebrations were cancelled.

Other countries donated medical supplies to help China deal with the epidemic.\nLowering numbers.\nOn 25 February, the number of newly confirmed cases outside mainland China passed those from within for the first time. By 6 March the reported number of new cases had dropped to well fewer than 100 nationally per day, down from thousands per day.\nOrigin.\n\"Many human coronaviruses have their origin in bats\". The human coronavirus NL63 shared a common ancestor with a bat coronavirus (ARCoV.2) between 1190 and 1449 AD. The human coronavirus 229E shared a common ancestor with a bat coronavirus (GhanaGrp1 Bt CoV) between 1686 and 1800 AD. More recently, alpaca coronavirus and human coronavirus 229E diverged sometime before 1960. \nMERS-CoV emerged in humans from bats through the intermediate host of camels. MERS-CoV, although related to several bat coronavirus species, appears to have diverged from these several centuries ago. \nThe most closely related bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV diverged in 1986. The ancestors of SARS-CoV first infected leaf-nose bats; later, they spread to horseshoe bats, then to Asian palm civets, and finally to humans.\nRacism.\nRacism among Asians such as Chinese people grew during the pandemic such as criticisms of their markets, lifestyles and food choices. Some rumors say that China made the virus in a lab."}

Vongfong made landfall on Samar Island at around 12 PM Philippines Time. It began to weaken because of many landfalls over the Philippines, and emerged into the South China Sea on May 17. It turned north and dissipated due to high wind shear the next day, just south of Taiwan.\nTropical Depression.\nThe JMA classified a tropical low east of the Philippines as a tropical depression on June 10."}

Temperature and symptom screening for coronavirus testing was added at international airports, as well as at hospitals for patients with travel or contact history. \nAds were introduced focused on self-monitoring for at-risk groups, practicing hygiene (especially hand washing), and avoiding crowds (or wearing masks if not possible).\nWhile residents returning from high-risk countries were encouraged to self-quarantine, travel restrictions were not announced until 5 March, when four countries were designated as \"disease-infected zones\".\nCriticism.\nThe government has been criticized for its slow response to the crisis. In early February, in response to concerns over hoarding and price increase of face masks, the government issued price controls. The move failed to prevent shortages among hospitals, and became a scandal. Criticism was also for the slow response to end foreign travel. \nBackground.\nOn 12 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, who had initially come to the attention of the WHO on 31 December 2019.\nUnlike SARS of 2003, the case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll."}
