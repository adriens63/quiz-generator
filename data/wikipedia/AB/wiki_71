She is famous for her relationship with Thomas Jefferson. People say she was his mistress or his concubine or the girl he was raping, but we do not know for sure. We do know that they had seven children together over many years. Most of what we know about Sally Hemings comes from things her son, Madison, said about her many years later.\nEarly life and family.\nAccording to Madison Hemings, Sally Hemings' grandmother was a fully African woman and might have been born in Africa. She was enslaved to the Eppes family in Virginia. Historians do not know for sure what her name was. Papers with the names of enslaved women in the Eppes family include \"Dinah,\" \"Judy,\" \"Abbie,\" \"Sarah,\" \"Parthenia,\" and others. Historian Annette Gordon-Reed said that there were many girls named \"Thenia\" in the Hemings family, and they might have been named after Parthenia. But she also says that \"Sally\" is a nickname for \"Sarah,\" and there were many girls named \"Sarah\" and \"Sally\" in the Hemings family too.\nSally Hemings' mother was called Elizabeth \"Betty\" Hemings. Madison Hemings told the story: Elizabeth Hemings' mother was an African woman and her father was an English sea captain named Hemings. The sea captain tried to buy Elizabeth Hemings from her owner, but the owner said no. He said he wanted to see what a half-white, half-African child would look like. Then Captain Hemings tried to take the child away from the owner without paying, but someone told the owner about his plan. Captain Hemings left Virginia and did not come back.\nCaptain Hemings tried to take his daughter from one of the men in the Eppes family, but historians do not know which one because they do not know when Elizabeth Hemings was born. One paper says \"about 1735.\" \nElizabeth Hemings lived at the Eppes family's house, which was called Bermuda Hundred until 1746. That year, Martha Eppes married John Wayles. Elizabeth and other enslaved people went with Martha to Wayle's house as part of her marriage settlement. A marriage settlement was any property that a married woman could control and her husband couldn't. Technically, the Eppes family owned Elizabeth Hemings.\nElizabeth Hemings had many children. The father of most of those children, including Sally, was John Wayles. John Wayles also had children with his wife, Martha Eppes. This made Sally Hemings the half-sister of Martha Wayles Skelton, who married Thomas Jefferson.\nWhen Martha Wayles Skelton married Jefferson, Hemings and many people in her family went with Martha Skelton to Jefferson's house at Monticello. Sally Hemings would have been about ten years old when Martha Wayles Skelton-Jefferson died. Historians think Sally Hemings and her mother Elizabeth may have helped take care of Martha Wayles Skelton-Jefferson was sick. Martha Wayles Skelton-Jefferson left Sally a present in her will: a small silver bell.\nYouth and trip to France.\nWhen Thomas Jefferson went to France to be ambassador, he only took his oldest daughter with him. He also took Sally Hemings's older brother, James Hemings. Jefferson left his younger two daughters behind with his wife's relatives in Virginia. Then the youngest of the three girls died. Jefferson then wrote to his wife's relatives and asked them to send the middle girl, Maria, nicknamed \"Polly,\" to him in France. It took two years for them to agree.\nJefferson told the relatives to choose one of the enslaved women to go with his daughter to France. He said the woman should be older, already inoculated for smallpox and of a steady personality. He asked for an enslaved woman named Isabel, then twenty-nine years old. But Isabel had just had a baby, so she could not come. Jefferson's wife's relatives sent Sally Hemings instead. Sally Hemings was not any of the three things Jefferson had asked for. She was only fourteen, not inoculated for smallpox, and had a lively personality.\nAbigail Adams met Hemings when the ship stopped in London. Abigail Adams wrote to Jefferson and said he should send Hemings back to Virginia on a ship, but he did not. She said Hemings would probably be as much work to take care of as Polly was. She wrote that Hemings was running around, laughing and playing with Polly. At the time, Adams thought Hemings was sixteen years old, but she was really fourteen years old. We do not know for sure why Abigail Adams wanted Jefferson to send Hemings back to Virginia.\nIn France, Hemings worked as a servant for Jefferson and as a lady's maid to Jefferson's oldest daughter, Martha. Jefferson paid her. Jefferson's writings show him buying clothes that Hemings could wear to outings with Martha. We do not know when Jefferson began having sex with Hemings. She was pregnant when Jefferson wanted to go back to Virginia.\nHistorian Annette Gordon-Reed wonders why Hemings agreed to go back to Virginia with Jefferson. There were about 1000 black people living in Paris at the time, and more of them were men than women. Gordon-Reed notes that if Sally Hemings had stayed in Paris, she probably could have gotten married or started her own business if she'd wanted to. Gordon-Reed says that Jefferson had planned to come back to France after after staying in Virginia only a short time. But the French Revolution's Reign of Terror happened, and he changed his plans.\nThe laws of France in the 1770s and 1780s did not allow people to keep slaves in France (they could keep slaves in France's colonies). People who brought slaves to France had to either send them away or free them within a certain time. Enslaved people who knew about the law sometimes went to the admiralty court and ask the French government to say they were free. Sally Hemings and her brother could have done this. Gordon-Reed notes that this would have made Jefferson and the United States look bad to the French. She also notes that if Jefferson had freed James and Sally Hemings, it would have made Jefferson and the United States look good to the French.\nHowever, neither of these two things happened. According to Hemings and Jefferson's son Madison, Sally Hemings negotiated with Jefferson. Jefferson, James Hemings and Sally Hemings made a deal in private: Jefferson promised to free all of Sally Hemings's children, whether he was their father or not. Jefferson promised to free James Hemings after he had taught more people at Monticello how to cook in the French way.\nChildren.\nFour of Hemings' children lived to be adults.\nLater life.\nVisitors to Monticello remembered Sally Hemings taking care of Jefferson's clothes and sewing. In Jefferson's writings, he called her \"Maria's maid.\"\nLegally, Sally Hemings was never freed. But historians believe that Jefferson's daughter Martha \"gave Sally her time.\" This was a thing that slave owners would do in the early 1800s: They would let an older slave live as if they were free.\nThe 1830 Virginia census lists Sally, Madison, and Eston as free white people. The 1831 census lists Sally Hemings as a \"free mulatto,\" meaning a free person who is half white and half black. In that census, Hemings said she had been living in Charlottesville, Virginia since 1826.\nScandal.\nPeople who did not like Jefferson wrote about him and Hemings. They said the fact that Jefferson had children with a black woman was a reason not to vote for him.\nIn 1802, Jefferson was President of the United States. That year, writer James Callendar wrote about Jefferson and Hemings in his newspaper. He called Sally Hemings a \"concubine\" and said that she and Jefferson had children.\nCover up.\nVirginia became more racist as the Civil War got closer. Jefferson's grandchildren did not want people to know their grandfather had sex with a black woman. They told people that perhaps Jefferson's nephew had been the father of Hemings's children. A man named Edmund Bacon wrote about working as an overseer at Monticello and said Jefferson was not the father of Harriet Hemings. But Bacon was not at Monticello until after Harriet was five years old.\nDuring the 20th century, not all historians believed that Jefferson was the father of Hemings's children. Even Eston Hemings Jefferson's descendants changed their story: They said one of Jefferson's other relatives must have been Eston's father.\nDNA test.\nIn 1998, DNA testing showed that someone from Jefferson's male line must have been the father of Hemings's son Eston. Scientists tested the Y chromosome of Jefferson's uncle and the Y chromosome of Jefferson's nephews' grandfather on their own father's side. They compared these chromosomes to the Y chromosomes of Eston's make descendants. They found that Eston's family had Y chromosomes like Jefferson's and not like his nephews'. Before the tests, about a third of historians believed Thomas Jefferson had been the father of Hemings' children, about a third did not, and about a third were undecided. After the test, about two thirds believed Thomas Jefferson was the father of Hemings' children.\nBecause Jefferson's nephews were not of his same male line, none of them could have been Eston's father. Historian Gordon-Reed matched this against letters and other records showing when Jefferson and Hemings were in the same place, and said that Jefferson could have been the father of all Hemings' children. For example, he was always at Monticello the right number of months before one of Hemings's children was born.\nIn 2000, the Thomas Jefferson Foundation said it was likely that Jefferson was the father of all Hemings's children.\nIn 2001, the Thomas Jefferson Heritage Society said Jefferson's younger brother must have been the father of Hemings's children.\nAppearance.\nWe do not know what Sally Hemings looked like. Newspapers making fun of Jefferson drew pictures of her as very dark-skinned, but most of those artists had never seen her. People who saw Hemings and wrote about her said she was light-skinned with long, straight hair.\nOne visitor to Monticello said she was very beautiful. She was 37 when he saw her and had already had many children.\nIn popular culture.\nIn 1995, the movie \"Jefferson in Paris\" showed Hemings as an older teenager who willingly seeks a relationship with Jefferson. In this movie, she returns with Jefferson to Virginia because she wants to go home."}

Women and girls, however, are more likely victims of sexual objectification than men and boys. The concept of sexual objectification toward females is very important for certain feminist theories. The sexual objectification toward women and girls contributes to poor treatment against them and to gender inequality. A number of psychologists link sexual objectification under certain physical and mental health risks for women and girls.\nSexual objectification of women.\nThe sexual objectification of women/girls has them being viewed like an object under male sexual desires, not as a whole person. Opinions differ, however, on which situations are objectionable. Many see the sexual objectifying of women/girls taking place with sexual portrayals involving them under art, media, advertising, pornography, prostitution and beauty contests.\nThere is also evidence showing that females are sometimes sexually objectified by other females.\nSexual objectification of Hispanic/Latina women.\nHispanic or Latina females are more often sexually objectified under stereotypes (unfair generalisations) toward them. The American media often portray these women as more likely to perform casual sex with multiple partners. The same media portray these females as having curved shapes, large breasts, large buttocks, having a melodramatic (over-the-top) attitude or being feisty.\nSexual objectification of men.\nWomen also sometimes see men as sex objects. This often happens in movies and in advertising. It also happens in certain television programs. Finally, erotic shows (such as a striptease), or pornography may reduce men to sex objects."}

She was a member of the Russian Parliament between 1995 and 2003. Beginning in 2007, Mizulina became a member again. She later became the chairperson of the Duma Committee on Family, Women and Children Affairs.\nDue to the Crimean crisis, Mizulina was punished by Canada, the United States and Western Europe.\nLegislative work.\nMizulina was involved with a number of controversial legislative projects. Those included:\nViews toward marriage, sexual relations and family.\nMizulina believes in limiting women's rights to abortion. She pledged to let abortions remain free of charge only under medical reasons or cases involving rape. In all other cases, she believed abortions should be billed to the women seeking such treatments.\nMizulina led an effort to decriminalize domestic violence in Russia. In 2016, she told reporters: \"A man beating his wife is less offensive than when a man is humiliated.\"\nMizulina had strong opinions and views toward United States citizens adopting Russian children. She voted for the Anti-Magnitsky bill. The bill forbids when people in and from the United States adopt Russian children.\nMizulina is against homosexuality and LGBT rights. She is the author for some legislative projects that are directed against \"the propaganda of homosexuality.\" They include the Russian gay propaganda law. She believes the phrase \"gays are people too\" should be marked as extremist by the Federal Service for Supervision of Consumer Rights Protection and Human Welfare. Mizulina was also in favor of taking children from gay parents, even bioligical parents.\nIn June 2012, Mizulina and the Duma Committee put into public a project called \"The State Concept of Family Policy Until 2025\". This policy proposed several controversial elements. They include: \nAfter the publication of \"Concept\", it was pointed out that several positions described in it were plagiarized word-for-word from a school report published in free access on the Internet. That in turn was plagiarized from a curriculum of family studies in Tomsk Polytechnic University. \nIn that same context, Mizulina called for the animated sitcom \"South Park\" to be removed from Russian airwaves.\nThe criticism toward Mizulina.\nRussian political scientist Mark Urnov described laws set in motion by Mizulina as \"diverse, but having a single common quality \u2013 their capacity to spread intolerance. They are simply a legal expression of the intolerance and the suppression of everything that corresponds to one's personal views in regard to what is right and wrong\".\nThe writer Dmitri Bykov believed Mizulina was \"constantly providing a legislative form for things that should remain a question of personal choice, which is far more dangerous than any gay pride parade\".\nIn April 2019, Mizulina was widely quoted for her statements in defense of the Russian Internet censorship laws. Her statements were condemned as Orwellian by several journalists."}

Interpretation of inkblots was used in the game Gobolink from the late 19th century. In Europe such games were known as kleksography. \nThen Alfred Binet appeared. He first used it for psychological research. It determined the work of the imagination and consciousness. \nIn 1921, Rorschach wrote his the main book \"Psychodiagnostik\" where he was described the test. \nAlso Austrian psychologist SIgmund Freud showed how psychic expressions of the individual (in speech, dreams, and so on) could be read as signs pointing to unconscious processes. These processes were significant for a fuller and deeper understanding of his personality. Finally, Freud stressed the very earliest experiences of the child in the family as of primary significance in the moulding of personality. \nSimilar tests have been devised by American psychologist Wayne H. Holtzman. \nLater the test began to be used in all sorts of speculative ways. Researchers gave the test to Nazi criminals during Nuremberg Trials hoping to find out the psychological roots of mass murder. \nMethod.\nRorschach showed inkblots to many people with the same question: \"What might this be?\". It showed how people approached the task. It showed also a different perception of people. Some people saw the movement on the pictures, some not. \nUsually inkblots pictures are shown secretly to make the patients' responses spontaneous. \nIn mass culture.\nRorschach test is used in many films, TV series, books, comics."}

{"id": "856649", "revid": "396686", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=856649", "title": "Free Mason Hall", "text": "Free Mason Hall Karachi before the partition, also known as Hope Lodge. All the programs of the society were held in it. Where there was a lot of hustle and bustle in the evening, there were rows of white Victorian cars in front of the building. At that time they had 500 members. Some of these notable names were Jam Mir Ayub Alamani, a big name in Karachi politically, socially, literary and culturally.\nThe building is viewed with suspicion after the partition. Freemasonry is a well-thought-out Jewish organization. Which is financially supported by the Jews. And the symbol of the Jews is the Star of David, the eight-pointed star.\nWell-known researcher Akhtar Baloch says that the reality before partition was somewhat different and it is also a fact that Muslims were included in these organizations before and after the formation of Pakistan. The fact that Jews now have the Star of David and the Freemason's logo is part of the same propaganda. There is a difference between the two signs. The Freemason Hall logo and the Star of David are separate symbols.\nHow many buildings and graves of Jews can be seen in Star of David Karachi.\nThe first such thing came to light in 1972\nFreemasonry activities were restricted under Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. Later, on July 18, 1973, the Bhutto government took control of the \"Free Mason Hall\"\nHe took possession of the entire record. On July 19, Dawn reported that the Sindh government, led by the area magistrate, had sealed off the local hall near the YMC and seized the record. Hall took over at the behest of a rebel group. The general impression is that Freemasonry is a Jewish organization. And that is against Islamic ideology.\nThey have 1750 members all over Pakistan. Of these, 700 are members of the Karachi headquarters. According to reports, there are Free Mason Lodge Halls in Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur, Lahore, Multan, Rawalpindi, Tarbela, Quetta and Peshawar.\nAfter capturing the Freemason Hall record, no one knows where it is now\nThe Free Mason Hall in Lahore was founded in 1860. This hall is known as \"Lahore Temple\". The building is now in the hands of the Punjab government. Where offices of various government departments have been set up. Dr. Muhammad Ibrahim Sheikh was the last Past Master of Freemason Lodge Hall Karachi. He was taken over by Dr. RB Kabhata in May 1973.\nIt may be recalled that when Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto restricted the activities of Free Mason Hall in 1972, his activities continued in spite of him. Earlier, in 1961, the Pakistani government and members of the Pakistani forces banned him from being a member of the Free Mason Rotary Club and the Lions Club. The same ban was imposed on other government employees in 1969.\nWhen Zia-ul-Haq banned the activities of the Freemasons on June 17, 1983, under the Marshall Law, Regulation 56, his activities continued. Because the order did not specify legal or illegal activities. Therefore, according to the members, they were carrying out legal activities. With this in mind, the Government declared the Martial Law Regulation of 17 June 1983 by the Martial Law Administrator on 29 December 1985. Under the order, the Freemasons were banned. Under section (5), this decision cannot be challenged in any court. And the person who obstructs the order under section (7) shall be punished severely with imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years and with fine.\nThe Freemasons were banned in Iran after the 1979 revolution. Thus, in only two countries in the world, Pakistan and Iran, the Free Mason organization has the Hope Lodge in the early 1990s and the Wildlife Accounts and Head Office at the Sindh Wildlife Time Freemason Lodge Hall. Where the Sindh government building was made a national heritage, renovation and decoration under the 1994 Act.\nThe building and hall are still in good condition. Where there are commemorative plaques. A plaque commemorates the Freemason Roberts Shepherd of Karachi. Apart from these ten boards, only these boards are left for the students of Free Mason Hall.\nCurrent look.\nJudaism is one of the oldest religions in the world. Before Islam, there were three tribes of Jews living in Madinah, of which the Banu Nadir, Banu Qainqa and Banu Qurayzah are the most important. Prior to the formation of Pakistan, there were a large number of Jews (Israelites) living in United India, especially in Bombay, Karachi, Gujarat (India), and also in the Pakistani cities of Multan, Rawalpindi and Peshawar. Families were settled. Who later emigrated to Israel and other countries.\nResearch.\nAitken's Sindh Gazetteer, published in 1907, writes about the Jewish population of Karachi that according to the 1901 census, their number is only 1300. Most of them live in Karachi. Most belong to the Israelite community. And it is believed that they settled in Karachi from Maharashtra. Not much can be said about the history of the Jews in United India, but you can guess from the fact that the general election was held in India in 1936 in which \"Abraham Rubin\" won the election for councilor in Karachi. Yes, it could mean that the number of Jews at that time was such that they had a councilor or that they would have very good relations with other religions. Abraham Rubin was also an official of the Jewish organization, the Israelite Association, which was added to Pakistan after the partition of India. The organization is thought to have been founded in 1893. In the 19th century, many organizations were formed to protect the Jewish community, with the aim of protecting the rights of Jews and promoting Judaism. They also provided affordable housing to their community and provided financial support. These organizations were funded by Jews around the world. Young Jews were prominent in these organizations. The Young Man Jewish Association and the Karachi Bani Israel Relief Fund are more important among these organizations. By 1911, 0.3% of Karachi's population was Jewish. After the creation of Israel, where Jews migrated from all over the world, many Jews from Pakistan also migrated to Israel, some to England, but the Arab-Israeli war made up for the shortfall. It has become difficult to live in Pakistan, as we all know how much hatred there is for Israel in Pakistan. There were also many Jews who hid their identities and did not reveal their identities by calling themselves Christians or Parsis. The inscription in Karachi's Frere Hall names the Jews who founded an organization called \"Free Mason\" in Pakistan, which was later banned after the establishment of Pakistan.\nBani Israel Mosque in Karachi.\nA Jewish religious shrine called the \"Star of the Church of Peace\" was located on Col. Jamil Street, Nishat Road, Karachi. The church was founded by Solomon David in 1893. Then in 1912 further expansion was made by Solomon's daughters, Gershon Solomon and Raheem Solomon. A Hebrew school was also established within the church by the Jewish community in 1916-1918. Nathan Ibrahim Hall was also established here in 1918. There is also a signboard with the words \"Pakistan Bani Israel Association\" written on it. There is also a mosque here called Bani Israel Mosque. Its entrance reads, \"Only Jews are allowed to enter here.\" There was an Israeli mosque building in the main square of the Ranchhor Lines area of \u200b\u200bKarachi, which has now been converted into a multi-storey residential building called \"Madiha Square\". Even today, the old people of Karachi know it as an Israeli or Jewish mosque. An old resident of the area, Qazi Khidr Habib, says the last trustee of the Israel Trust was a woman named Rachel Joseph, who named the building after a man named Ahmed Elahi, son of Mehr Elahi, a power of attorney. They agreed to build a commercial building on the site of the shrine. Shops will be built on the ground floor of the building while a shrine will be built on the first floor. There were shops on the ground floor and a place of worship on the first floor. But now there are residential flats instead of places of worship. There was also a lawsuit between \"Rachel Joseph\" and various individuals over the ownership of the trust, in which \"Rachel\" and his attorney won. Rachel's presence in Karachi is said to have moved her to London a long time ago. On May 6, 2007, Reema Abbasi, a columnist for Rozna Mehdan, wrote that the last custodian of the place, Rachel Joseph, was in Karachi until 2007, when she moved to London.\nJews of Hyderabad.\nThe general impression about the Jews is that they were confined to Karachi, but an inscription in the Jewish cemetery proves that they served in other cities of Sindh besides Karachi. There is also a tomb of Dr. Elizabeth Jacob Bhurapkar, who served in the Civil Hospital, Hyderabad, who was born in 1850 and died in 1922. Similarly, a grave has been made by Abraham Reuben Kumar, the vice president of the Jewish community in Karachi.\nJews of Multan.\nAccording to Altaf Ahmed, Director Media Relations of the Election Commission of Pakistan, the number of Jewish voters in Pakistan was 809 in the last national elections held in 2013. And there were 12 Jews in Multan who identified themselves as Parsis. According to these figures, the disappearance of hundreds of Jewish voters in five years is a rare occurrence. Where did the Jewish voters go?\nJews of Peshawar.\nPeshawar also had a Jewish community in the 1960s and had two places of worship. As of 2017, there were 900 Jewish voters registered, according to the Election Commission of Pakistan. At present, as many Jews as there are in Pakistan are hiding their identities. Jews call themselves Parsis or Christians, so it is not possible to know their true numbers.\nJews of Rawalpindi.\nDeutsche Welle, a reporter for the English broadcaster DW, wrote in a report on Jews in Rawalpindi that it was difficult to identify Jews in Rawalpindi. Only one of the Pakistani Jews contacted by Deutsche Welle was a senior citizen. He agreed to be interviewed on condition of anonymity. This elderly Jewish citizen of Pakistan is a good year old and lives in an old and densely populated area of \u200b\u200bRawalpindi. \"There was a time when even about thirty years ago, there were about forty-five Jewish families living in Rawalpindi, Islamabad and Gujranwala,\" he said. Many Jewish families, including my own, have migrated to Europe, the United States or South Africa. At least six Jewish families have relocated to Karachi, \u201dhe said.\u201c Until the 1970s, there were two synagogues in Rawalpindi. But despite the fact that a few Jewish families lived in the city, these places of worship were closed because our religious leaders, the rabbis, were not available. Jews stopped registering as voters because it is now a viable option for a Jew to run for office in a particular seat and to go and vote for such a candidate as a voter in an age of sectarianism and extremism. No, \u201dsaid the Pakistani minority, who has spent most of his life in a neighborhood in Rawalpindi, explaining to DW why local Jews have little interest in politics. Similarly, he has never been politically active. But due to the instability of the democracy that was restored after the dictatorship of Zia-ul-Haq and the lack of interest of almost all political parties in the local Jews, our own interest in politics has almost disappeared. The last time I cast my vote was in the 1990 general election. After that, the desire to participate in the election as a voter disappeared.\nKarachi Jewish Israel Cemetery.\nThere are graves of Jews (Israelis) in Mewa Shah Cemetery in Karachi. And an estimated 5,000 Jews are buried here. About five hundred graves have been identified. The Hebrew language written on the books is now the only sign that the Jews are buried here. The last burial in the Israelite cemetery was in the 1980s, after which no Jew is reported to have been buried here. Solomon David was a surveyor in the Karachi Municipality in the British era. Solomon died in 1902 and his wife died the following year. Both spouses were buried in the same cemetery. In 1912, Solomon David's two sons redesigned his books. The cemetery is overgrown with bushes and plants, and criminals often hide from law enforcement due to a lack of government attention. The cemetery is being looked after by a Baloch family, who have been its watchmen for six generations. According to him, some Jews used to come here and pay for their maintenance, but now for years no one has come here, only newspaper correspondents and researchers come and take pictures and leave. This monument to Judaism in Karachi has fallen into disrepair due to lack of proper maintenance. Most Jewish graves have been demolished and the resettlement of Muslim dead is in full swing.\nIsraeli Jew from Karachi.\nRegarding the presence of Jews in Karachi, Mahmooda Rizvia writes on page 146 of her book Queen of the East that Jews live in the Lawrence Quarter. Employees are called Israelites by profession and common usage. The victims separate themselves. There is a temple and a cemetery. Their population is very small. Educated and very happy. Well known writer and journalist Muhammad Hanif who fortunately visited Israel. At the moment, the international broadcaster affiliated with the BBC writes about an event during his visit to Israel that at last one of the moderators realized that I had not given a speech. I was taken by the hand and made to stand on the stage. I said that I am not from India but from Karachi. That's how I came home from work. But I was very happy to meet you guys and so on and so forth. A forty-five-year-old man of fair complexion and fat body, sitting in the front row, sobbed loudly. When I got off the stage, he came and grabbed my hand, took me to a corner and hugged me. This was Daniel of Soldier Bazaar Karachi.\n\"I haven't seen anyone from Karachi since 68\"\nHe told me between sobs:\n\"I went to an English medium school there. We had our own mosque. During the war of 1967, Ayub Khan sent police to protect it.\"\nThen he put his hand on his heart and said, \"We were not in trouble there. We were never abused. We just saw that all the Jews were going to Israel, so we came too.\"\nPakistan was formed in 1947 and Israel in 1948 and this is where the bad days of these Jews began. Then whenever the Arabs fought Israel, the land became narrow for the Jews of Sindh. In the Arab-Israeli wars of 1956 and 1967, Pakistani extremist Muslims kept Pakistani Jews alive. Even in 1968, there were only 250 Jews left in Sindh, which used to be three or four thousand. Jews were forced to leave Pakistan and seek refuge in England or Israel.\nThe remaining surviving Jews, disguised as Parsis, somehow managed to populate Karachi's Megan Shalom Snigag and the Jewish cemetery. The misfortune of Pakistan that then came the era of Zia-ul-Haq, it was the double misfortune of Pakistani Jews, people fell on each other while chanting slogans of jihad, when Deobandi, Barelvi, Ahle Hadith and Shia killed each other by declaring each other as infidels. How can Jews survive in such a situation? Some extremist Muslims, together with the Occupy Mafia, attacked the synagogue, the Jews escaped, and valuables were stolen. Twelve years ago today, there were about ten Jewish families in Karachi. But that number has dwindled, with Jewish property grabbing mafias and locals building residential buildings and commercial complexes."}

His parents were Emmanuel and Charlotte Howe. He had three brothers, George, William, and Thomas. Howe's mother Charlotte was related to the royal family. Her mother, Sophia von Kielmannsegg, was a king's daughter by a mistress. So Charlotte was King George I's niece through his half-sister. Sir Nathanial Wrahall said that Richard Howe looked like King George I.\nEmmaneul Howe died when Richard Howe was about eight years old. He died while he was governor of Barbados.

It was adapted off the television series of the same name.\nPrincipal photography started on February 22, 2016 across Florida and Savannah, Georgia. \"Baywatch\" was released in May 2017. The movie got substandard reviews from the critics, mostly for its crude humor and character developments. However, it had a box office intake of just over $58 million in the United States. It made another $119.8 million in several other territories. The total box office intake was around $177.8 million. The movie's budget was $69 million. \"Baywatch\" was given five nominations in the 38th Golden Raspberry Awards. The categories were the Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel, the Worst Screenplay, the Razzie Nominee So Rotten You Loved It and the Worst Picture. \nThe reviews.\n\"Baywatch\" received an approval rating of only 17% under Rotten Tomatoes. Critics from the movie judging site said: \"\"Baywatch\" takes its source material's jiggle factor to R-rated levels, but lacks the original's campy charm \u2013 and leaves its charming stars flailing in the shallows.\" It received a rating of 37 out of 100 under Metacritic. That meant \"generally unfavorable reviews.\".\nWriting for the \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, Peter Travers was happy with the \"easy rapport\" from Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron. Travers stated, though, \"what [the film] needs more is a functional script\". Travers rated the movie two out of four stars. He then said: \"Think of yourself sitting down for a big two-hour wallow in instant stupid with a vat of popcorn, slathered in fake butter and possibly a mound of melted M&amp;Ms on top. It feels great chugging it down, then your stomach hurts, your head aches and you puke the whole thing up so you can forget about it in the morning. That's \"Baywatch\" in a nutshell.\" Owen Gleiberman from the \"Variety\" magazine called it \"stupidly entertaining... for a while\". He was, however, not impressed with the movie's plot."}

The game takes place a year after the events of the \"Macross 7\" television series and follows the VF-X Ravens unit. The game was followed by a sequel, \"Macross VF-X2\" in September 2, 1999.\nOverview.\nThis is a shooting game based on the Macross series, and is a wholly original setting not based on any previous works or series. It is set one year after the \"Macross 7\", which had been the most recent of the franchise at the time. The game was initially planned as a fully polygonal 3D shooter, and the Sony PlayStation perfectly suited the game's ambition in terms of graphics.\nDevelopment began in 1995 and has long been shown on several game magazine's release schedule as software with a release date pending. The development involves the main creators of the Macross series, such as Sh\u014dji Kawamori (Valkyrie Design, Supervisor), Kazutaka Miyatake (Ship / Mecha Design), Haruhiko Mikimoto (Main Character Design). The game was noted for including the transformable modes of the VF-4 Lightning III, which had only been previously seen as a fighter on \"The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Flash Back 2012\".\nUntil the game's development, Macross-related games were released on family computers, PC engines and arcades without the involvement of Sh\u014dji Kawamori. Kawamori was uninterested in video game development at that point because he could only do 2D, but he had become interested when he learned the game was being made in 3D for the Sony Playstation.\nPlot.\nIn A.D. 2047, the five member idol group \"Milky Dolls\", who had been scheduled to participate in the next \"ZENTRADI sound project\", are abducted by unknown hostile force during a U.N. Spacy commemorative ceremony. Escaping in a camouflaged spaceship, the abductors folded to the planet Elysion.\nThe U.N. Spacy high command then orders the VF-X Ravens and the crew of the Valhalla III to rescue the Milky Dolls and uncover the identity of the mysterious armed force. They turn out to be a rogue Zentradi militia.\nMissions.\nA series of missions takes place in the game under \"Operation Orpheus\". The enemies of the VF-X Ravens are primarily rogue Zentradi forces, consisting of Battle Pods\nReception.\nThe game received fairly negative reviews at the time. Gamespot is quoted saying \"Macross VF-X looks elegant at times, but ultimately fails to capture the emotion, the excitement, and the sheer visual splendor of its source material.\", citing how the game featured lengthy, boring missions and poor control flight mechanics, controls and physics. Many others have criticized the game's horrible audio / sound effects and poor music, which utilized MIDI arrangement. These criticisms would later be rectified in its sequel, \"Macross VF-X2\"."}

Within 2 months, the founders of Texas (Davie Rocket, John Menger III, Chris Alamo, and Antonio Sanders) adopted the dance as a staple of Texas heritage. Historians still argue about if the dance originated after the successful Battle of the Bulge or the war of 1899 with Houston.\nThe dance is performed by putting your lead foot behind your support foot while simultaneously twisting your pelvis in a counter-clockwise motion, being sure to point your toes toward your partner. Keep in mind, the entirety of the dance is completed by two Texas sized steps (around 4.2x as large as a standard U.S. step). What follows these two steps is a series of freestyle movements that vary between performers. For example, Davie Rocket adopted the \"Hemisfair\" movement, where you proceed to grab your partner by the pinky and swing her around your head similar to the motion of a lasso.\nImportance.\nThe Texas Two-Step and other forms of step related lone star dances have become a cultural staple of the state down under. Bordering states have attempted to plagiarize this dance in ways of their own, but to no avail. For example, Louisiana created the Boot Stompin' Bop, until it faded into obscurity in 1923 after the housing market crash. Arkansas native Dick Rutherford created the Whiskey Slammer Toe Spinner, but 2 minutes into the debut of the dance, Dick was shot in the Golden Monkey Saloon. The only dance to remain a southern tradition as much as the Texas Two-Step, is the Texas Two-Step.\nNotable Sightings.\nMany notable individuals have been seen in public performing the famous dance. Tom Alamodome, John \"Hand-Standin'\" Johnson, and Brett were all sighted at Shiner Park performing the moves of the golden days. They were all sighted by Eva Longoria, former Spurs trophy wife."}

They are 0.5 to 0.6 m high and .85 to 1 m long. They weigh 10 to 15 kg. They have long ears and short tails, and the male deer have very long canine teeth that look like tusks.\nMale musk deer have musk pods that can weigh 30 to 45 g.\nMusk deer can live 12 to 15 years.\nBehavior.\nAlpine musk deer all leave their feces in the same place. Scientists call this a latrine site. They do this to mark their territory, meaning to show other deer that a place belongs to them.\nThreats.\nAlpine musk deer are in danger of dying out because human beings trap them. Like other musk male deer, male Alpine musk deer have musk pods that people use musk pods to make perfumes and in traditional medicines. When people set traps for male musk deer, they trap and kill female musk deer and fawns too.\n In the 21st century, one kilogram of musk pod can pay USD45,000.\nThe government of China keeps some Alpine musk deer in captivity."}

The flooding devastated the downstream villages of Bento Rodrigues and Paracatu de Baixo, from Bento Rodrigues, killing 19 people. The damage caused by the tailings dam collapse is the largest ever recorded with pollutants spread along of watercourses.\nThe failure of the dam released 43.7 million cubic metres of mine tailings into the Doce River. A toxic brown mudflow polluted the river and beaches near the mouth when it reached the Atlantic Ocean 17 days later. The disaster created a humanitarian crisis as hundreds were displaced and cities along the Doce River suffered water shortages when their water supplies were polluted.\nThe total impact of the disaster, including the reason for failure and the environmental consequences, are officially under investigation and remain unclear. The owner of the Bento Rodrigues dam, Samarco, was subject to extensive litigation and government sanctions. In 2016, charges of manslaughter and environmental damage were filed against 21 executives, including Samarco's former CEO and representatives from Samarco's owners, Vale and BHP Billiton, on its board of directors.

Members with the movement are working for American Britney Spears to be freed from her years-long and court-ordered conservatorship (the appointment of court-ordered guardians or protectors by court judges). The Free Britney movement was begun in 2008. The movement became popular in 2019.\nThe background.\nIn 2008, Spears was placed into a three-day psychiatric hold two separate times. At the time, she was experiencing serious conflicts which affected her personal life. Those conflicts include divorcing her then-husband Kevin Federline in late 2007, attacking paparazzi, shaving her head and losing the custody of her two sons with Federline. Just after the second hospital visit, Spears' father Jamie filed to put a temporary conservatorship on her. The conservatorship was made permanent later in 2008. Jamie was the conservator for Britney's personal affair and co-conservator for her finances with Andrew Wallet. Wallet was in charge starting in 2009. He resigned his position in March 2019. Due to stress from her father Jamie's afflictions, Britney went into a mental health facility the same month. She was released the following month from the mental health facility.\nThe inception and outcomes.\nIn April 2019, a podcast that involved Britney, titled \"Britney's Gram\", put out voicemails from an anonymous party saying they were the former members of her legal team. The anonymous party also said her planned second residency was canceled by her father Jamie due to Britney not always wanting to take her medication. They then said Britney was involuntarily held in the facility beginning in January after she violated rules that banned her from driving. Finally, they said the conservatorship was originally scheduled to end in 2009. Shortly after the podcast episode, a movement to end the conservatorship, called #FreeBritney, became widely known. In May, the Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Brenda Penny, the judge over the case, ordered an \"expert evaluation\" of the arrangement during a hearing. In September 2019, her former husband Federline was then granted a restraining order against Britney's father Jamie just after what might have been a physical dispute between Jamie and one of Federline's and Britney's sons. The order was sought when Federline said Jamie broke down a door to get his grandson. When the grandson was in his room, Federline said, Jamie grabbed him.\nThe Los Angeles divorce attorney Mark Vincent Kaplan stated there was a disagreement that took place when Britney and her sons were visiting Jamie at his home. According to Kaplan, the disagreement led to a serious act of physical violence that was observed by Britney's and Federline's older son Jayden. Kaplan credited Britney for removing the children from the area.\nBritney Spears gave notice to the court on June 23, 2021 and talked about having trauma. She described the conservatorship as \"abusive\". She then expressed her wishes for choosing her own legal representation and to marry and have another child. She asked Penny to dissolve the conservatorship without further evaluation. The request to end the conservatorship, however, was later denied by Penny. During a court hearing in July 2021, Britney Spears was given the right to choose her own lawyer. Judge Penny then approved the replacement of Spears' previous lawyer Samuel Ingham with Matthew Rosengart. The new lawyer said he would be working to dissolve the conservatorship. \nA public response.\nFrom 2019 to 2021, the #FreeBritney movement gained support from many celebrities. They included singers Miley Cyrus and Cher and media personality Paris Hilton. The singers Justin Timberlake and Christina Aguilera, the earlier of whom was Spears' past boyfriend, also voiced their support. The latter also said Spears' conservatorship was \"unacceptable\".\nU.S. Burgess Owens, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Andy Biggs and Matt Gaetz invited Spears to testify on her conservatorship to United States Congress. In relation to Spears' case, U.S. Senators Bob Casey Jr. and Elizabeth Warren called on the United States Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice to give them data on conservatorships so they could make policy-related recommending on the system. Casey Jr. and Warren called for more federal oversight on the guardianship system in the United States after Spears' testimony. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), a nonprofit organization, decided they would help Spears in dissolving the conservatorship if she requested to do so. They filed an \"amicus curiae\" to support Spears' plea to choose her own legal representation."}

This is usually because that person is old or has physical or mental health problems. People in a conservatorship are called \"conservatees\". Conservatees are usually adults. A person in guardianship is called a \"ward\". The term \"ward\" is usually used in reference to minors (people under age 18). Conservatorship may also be used for corporations or organizations.\nAppointment of conservatorships.\n\"Conservatorship\" refers to the legal responsibility over a person who has a certain mental disorder or a physical health problem. This includes people affected with psychosis, suicidal ideation, certain levels of autism or in some other way are not able to make medical, financial or legal decisions for themselves. \nIn relation to the government control of businesses and corporations, like Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, conservatorship means more temporary control than does nationalization.\nConservatorship controversy.\nA recent example of conservatorship controversy is that involving the American pop singer-songwriter Britney Spears. She was put into conservatorship by her father in 2008. The year before, Britney had a mental breakdown. Spears also shaved her head and hit paparazzi with an umbrella. In late 2008, the conservatorship was made permanent. It triggered the Free Britney movement.\nIn California there are two forms of conservatorship.

This expanded the company's refining and marketing base across the midwestern United States. It also gave Texaco rights to Indian's Havoline motor oil (which became a Texaco product). \nIn 1994, the System3 gasolines by Texaco were replaced with new CleanSystem3 gasoline for improved engine performance.\nTexaco gasoline contains Techron, an additive developed by Chevron in 2005. It replaces the previous CleanSystem3. This Texaco brand is strong in Latin America, the United States and West Africa. It is also in Europe. In the United Kingdom, there are about 850 Texaco-branded gas stations.\nIn 2010, Texaco ended business operations across the Mid-Atlantic States. Texaco removed its brand from 450 stations in Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Ohio, Indiana, West Virginia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Kentucky and Washington, D.C..\nTexaco once did business in and around the Quad Cities of southeastern Iowa and northwestern Illinois. In the 2000s decade, however, the stores were closed. They were then replaced with Kwik Shop stores in Iowa and with Gas Land stores in Illinois."}

Examples of political corruption are lobbying, bribery, extortion (which refers when to someone commits blackmail or bribery against or threatens other people through putting a feeling of fear by telling certain people something \"will\" happen if the victim does not comply), nepotism (the unfair use of power for receiving job employments or benefits by family or friends), patronage (improperly using state money/goods to reward families, certain groups or races in exchange for voting for certain political party members) and embezzlement. Corruption is often linked to human trafficking, money laundering and drug trafficking. But political corruptions are not limited to these illegal acts. Misuse of government power for certain other purposes, an example of which is police brutality is also classified as political corruption.\nPolitical corruption hurts democracy by going against the formal process. Corruption in elections and in legislature reduces responsibility and falsely represents the related creations of policies.\nEconomies having a high level of political corruption tend to not be as financially successful as one that has low level corruption. Political corruption not only threatens justice and ethical values. Recalls of loans by international banks, along with massive selling of emerging market stocks from international mutual funds, is associated with (and can actually cause) crises in economics and currency problems in certain countries. Examples of these problems are in Asia, Africa and Central America."}

{"id": "857194", "revid": "22027", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=857194", "title": "Shipwrecking", "text": "Shipwrecking is an event that causes a shipwreck, such as a ship striking something that causes the ship to sink; the stranding of a ship on rocks, land or shoal; poor maintenance; or the destruction of a ship either intentionally or by violent weather.\nCauses.\nFactors for the loss of a ship may include:\nDesign and equipment failure.\nThe hallmark of a shipwreck due to poor design is the capsize of Swedish warship \"Wasa\" in Stockholm harbour 1628. She was too narrow, had too little ballast and her lower cannon deck had too low free-board for good seaworthiness. Poor design allowed the ferry MS \"Herald of Free Enterprise\" to put to sea with open roll-on/roll-off bow doors, with tragic consequences.\nFailure or leaking of the hull is a serious problem that can lead to the loss of buoyancy or the free surface effect and the subsequent sinking of the vessel. Even the hulls of large modern ships have cracked in heavy storms. Leaks between the hull planks of wooden vessels are a particular problem.\nEquipment failure caused the shipwreck of cruiseferry \"Estonia\" in 1994. The stress of stormy seas on hull and bow especially caused the bow visor to break off, in turn tearing the watertight bow door open and letting seawater flow onto the car deck. She capsized with tragic consequences. Failure of pumps can lead to the loss of a potentially salvageable ship with only a minor leak or fire.\nFailure of the means of propulsion, such as engines, sails or rigging, can lead to the loss of a ship. When the ship's movement is determined only by currents or the wind and particularly by storms, a common result is that the ship is unable to avoid natural hazards like rocks, shallow water or tidal races. Loss of propulsion or steering can inhibit a ship's ability to safely position itself in a storm, even far from land. Waves attacking a ship's side can overwhelm and sink it.\nInstability and foundering.\nInstability is caused by the centre of mass of the ship rising above the metacenter resulting in the ship tipping on its side or capsizing. To remain buoyant, the hull of a vessel must prevent water entering the large air spaces of the vessel (known as downflooding). Clearly for the ship to float, the normally-submerged parts of the hull will be watertight, but the upper parts of the hull must have openings to allow ventilation to compartments, including the engine room, for crew access, and to load and unload cargo. In a capsize, water can enter these openings if not watertight. If a ship sinks after capsizing, or as a consequence of a leak in the hull or other water ingress, it is often described as having \"foundered\" or \"foundering\". Large ships are designed with compartments to help preserve the necessary buoyancy.\nBad weather.\nOn 25 October 2012, the tall ship \"Bounty\" (a replica of the original HMS \"Bounty\") sank in a hurricane. The vessel left New London, Connecticut, heading for St. Petersburg, Florida, initially going on an easterly course to avoid Hurricane Sandy. On 29 October 2012 at 03:54 EDT, the ship's owner called the United States Coast Guard for help during the hurricane after losing contact with the ship's master. He reported she was taking on water off the coast of North Carolina, about from the storm, and the crew were preparing to abandon ship. There were sixteen people aboard, two of whom did not survive the sinking. An inquiry into the sinking was held by the United States Coast Guard in Portsmouth, Virginia from 12 to 21 February 2013; at which it was concluded that Captain Walbridge's decision to sail the ship into the path of Hurricane Sandy was the cause, and the inquiry found this to have been a \"reckless decision\".\nPoor weather can cause several problems:\nWind causes waves which result in other difficulties. Waves make navigation difficult and dangerous near shallow water. Also, waves create buoyancy stresses on the structure of a hull. The weight of breaking waves on the fabric of the ship force the crew to reduce speed or even travel in the same direction as the waves to prevent damage. Also, wind stresses the rigging of sailing ships.\nThe force of the wind pushes ships in the direction of the wind. Vessels with large windage suffer most. Although powered ships are able to resist the force of the wind, sailing vessels have few defences against strong wind. When strong winds are imminent, sailing vessels typically have several choices:\nMany losses of sailing ships were caused by sailing, with a following wind, so far into a bay that the ship became trapped upwind of a lee shore, being unable to sail into the wind to leave the bay. Low visibility caused by fog, mist and heavy rain increase the navigator's problems. Cold can cause metal to become brittle and fail more easily. A build-up of ice can cause instability by accumulating high on the ship, or in severe cases, crush the hull if the ship becomes trapped in a freezing sea.\nRogue waves.\nAccording to one scientist who studies rogue waves, \"two large ships sink every week on average, but the cause is never studied to the same detail as an air crash. It simply gets put down to 'bad weather'.\" Once considered mythical and lacking hard evidence for their existence, rogue waves are now proven to exist and known to be a natural ocean phenomenon. Eyewitness accounts from mariners and damages inflicted on ships have long suggested they occurred; however, their scientific measurement was only positively confirmed following measurements of the \"Draupner wave\", a rogue wave at the Draupner platform in the North Sea on January 1, 1995, with a maximum wave height of (peak elevation of ). During that event, minor damage was also inflicted on the platform, far above sea level, confirming that the reading was valid. Their existence has also since been confirmed by satellite imagery of the ocean surface.\nFire.\nFire can cause the loss of ships in many ways. The most obvious way would be the loss of a wooden ship which is burned until watertight integrity is compromised (e.g. \"Cospatrick\"). The detonation of cargo or ammunition can cause the breach of a steel hull. An extreme temperature may compromise the durability properties of steel, causing the hull to break on its own weight. Often a large fire causes a ship to be abandoned and left to drift (e.g. MS \"Achille Lauro\"). Should it run aground beyond economic salvage, it becomes a wreck.\nIn extreme cases, where the ship's cargo is either highly combustible (such as oil, natural gas or gasoline) or explosive (nitrates, fertilizers, ammunition) a fire onboard may result in a catastrophic conflagration or explosion. Such disasters may have catastrophic results, especially if the disaster occurs in a harbour, such as the Halifax Explosion.\nNavigation errors.\nMany shipwrecks have occurred when the crew of the ship allowed the ship to collide with rocks, reefs, icebergs, or other ships. Collision has been one of the major causes of shipwreck. Accurate navigation is made more difficult by poor visibility in bad weather. Also, many losses happened before modern navigation aids such as GPS, radar and sonar were available. Until the 20th century, the most sophisticated navigational tools and techniques available - dead reckoning using the magnetic compass, marine chronometer (to calculate longitude) and ships logbook (which recorded the vessel's heading and the speed measured by log) or celestial navigation using marine chronometer and sextant - were sufficiently accurate for journeys across oceans, but these techniques (and in many cases also the charts) lacked the precision to avoid reefs close to shore.\nThe Scilly naval disaster of 1707, which claimed nearly 2,000 lives and was one of the greatest maritime disasters in the history of the British Isles, is attributed to the mariner's inability to find their longitude. This led to the Longitude Act to improve the aids available for navigation. Marine chronometers were as revolutionary in the 19th century as GPS is today. However the cost of these instruments could be prohibitive, sometimes resulting in tragic consequences for ships that were still unable to determine their longitude, as in the case of the \"Arniston\".\nEven today, when highly accurate navigational equipment is readily available and universally used, there is still scope for error. Using the incorrect horizontal datum for the chart of an area may mislead the navigator, especially as many charts have not been updated to use modern data. It is also important for the navigator to appreciate that charts may be significantly in error, especially on less frequented coasts. For example, a recent revision of the map of South Georgia in the South Atlantic showed that previous maps were in some places in error by several kilometres.\nOver the centuries, many technological and organizational developments have been used to reduce accidents at sea including:"}

She was the teenage girlfriend of Charles Starkweather, a serial killer. Fugate was age fourteen when Starkweather's happened. She was convicted as his accomplice and given life imprisonment. She was paroled in 1976.\nBackground to the crime spree.\nFugate lived in Lincoln, Nebraska with her mother Velma Bartlett and her stepfather Marion Bartlett. In 1956, at age 13, Fugate got romantically involved to Charles Raymond Starkweather. The man had dropped out of high school. He was born almost five years before Fugate was. They bet by way of Caril's sister Barbara. The latter was dating Starkweather's friend Bob von Busch. Starkweather was a truck unloader for the Western Union newspaper warehouse. \nOn Sunday, December 1, 1957, Starkweather committed his first murder when attendant Robert \"Bobby\" Calvert, working for a gas station near Lincoln, Nebraska, refused to let Starkweather buy a present for Fugate on credit. Starkweather then killed Calvert and robbed the gas station.\nOn January 21, 1958, Starkweather shot and killed Velda and Marion Bartlett. The killer then hit Fugate's baby half-sister, Betty Jean. That caused blunt-force trauma. Starkweather then stabbed her in the neck.\nThe cross-state crime spree.\nStarkweather and Fugate left Nebraska. They drove into Wyoming. They were involved in six more murders. Starkweather and Fugate were later arrested near Douglas, Wyoming. \nThe sentencing.\nStarkweather was sentenced to death and executed in Nebraska's electric chair on Thursday, June 25, 1959. He insisted although he killed most of the victims, Fugate also killed several. Fugate maintained her innocence. However, she was tried and convicted for her role in the murder spree. While being tried, Fugate testified she was Starkweather's hostage. The jury, however, found Fugate's testimony as not credible.\nRelease from prison.\nWhile in prison, Fugate was called a model prisoner. After release, she lived in the Lansing, Michigan area for a long time.\nThe Nebraska Parole Board did not grant a pardon for Fugate. The decision was made in February 2020. The reason for the decision was because the role of a pardon is to restore rights to felons, not to set people free of their crimes.\nThe media portrayal.\nMovies/television.\nThe Starkweather\u2013Fugate case was the inspiration for several movies. Those include \"Kalifornia\" (1993), \"Natural Born Killers\" (1994) and \"Starkweather\" (2004). The television movie, \"Murder in the Heartland\" (1993) was a biographical depiction of Fugate and Starkweather. The earlier is played by Fairuza Balk. The latter is played by Tim Roth"}

Reasons students drop out include because they must work, for social reasons, because of harassment, because of illness or because they no longer trust the school system that they are leaving. Unlike failing or expulsion, dropping out is the student's decision and not the school's.\nCanada.\nIn Canada, most people graduate from grade 12 by age 18. It was found by the Labour Force Survey (LFS) that by 2009, one in twelve 20-to-24 year old adults in Canada did not have a diploma from high school (Gilmore, 2010). The study also showed that males had higher dropout rates than females. Other people with stronger risks for dropping out were those outside urban/suburban areas or in the northern territories. Beginning from 1990 the Canadian dropout rates went down from 20% (1990) to around 9% (2010). From 2010 and after, however, the rate did not drop across Canada. When females drop out of high school, they get less money, the economic costs are greater and they have higher rates of unemployment than male dropouts. Female high school dropouts are more likely to rely on public support programs than male dropouts.\nUnited Kingdom.\nDropping out of school is not allowed in the United Kingdom. Dropping out of college or universities, however, \"is\" allowed. Students under age 16 must attend a school with the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE).\nUnited States.\nIn the United States, dropping out means students entirely quit school before they graduate. About 1.2 million students drop out of high school every year in the United States. They do this for different reasons: bullying, family emergency, poor grades, depression, mental illness, bad environment or not enough freedom. Students who drop out of high school in the United States are more likely to be unemployed, homeless or receiving welfare. Members of certain racial or ethnic groups drop out at higher rates than white students. Students raised in single-parent families and low poor students are more likely to drop out.\nMany states say students must stay in school until they are 16, like in the United Kingdom. However, in 1972, the United States Supreme Court said that Amish students do not have to go to high school."}

They live in northwestern North America.\nThere are about 115,000 thinhorn sheep alive. There are two subspecies of thinhorn sheep, the Dall sheep (\"Ovis dalli dalli\") and stone sheep (\"Ovis dalli stonei\"). Most thinhorn sheep are Dall sheep.\nMost of the stone sheep live in British Columbia.\nAppearance.\nThese sheep are about 1.5 m high and can weigh up to 110 kg. The female sheep have small horns but the male sheep have larger horns that twist more as they get older. The horns are tan in color. The wool of Dall's sheep is almost pure white. The wool of the stone sheep is almost all black. Stone sheep horns do not flare out as much and are lighter in color.\nBehavior.\nThese sheep live in mountains. In the summer, they come to grassy places to eat twigs, sage, buds, leaves and grass. These places are 1200 to 1500 meters above sea level. In the winter, they stay on the south sides of the mountains, where it is warmer. These places are about 1500 to 2200 meters above sea level. Although they do well in the cold, thinhorn sheep do not move easily through deep snow. They have short legs and small feet, so they cannot walk through snow or on top of it. Instead, they try to live in forests where the snow is not deep or near cliffs. They can climb the cliffs to get away from animals that want to eat them. They follow the same routes from summer places to winter places for generations.\nThinhorn sheep live in herds. Most of the time, the rams live together in a bachelor herd, and the ewes and young sheep live together in other herds. Male sheep leave the female herds when they are about two years old.\nThe sheep mate in November. Although younger rams can mate, it is mostly the older rams who actually do. Rams only fight each other if their horns are almost the same size. Otherwise, rams with smaller horns give way to rams with larger horns. Thinhorn rams do not fight each other as much as bighorn rams do.\nThe ewes give birth when the spring plants are growing. The ewe climbs up into a rock place and gives birth. She and her lamb stay there for a few days before coming back down. This makes it harder for predators to find and eat the new lamb.\nPredators.\nGolden eagles, wolves, bears, and wolverines eat thinhorn sheep. It is easiest for predators to catch sheep in bad winters, when the snow is deep and the spring comes later. The sheep are hungry and cannot run away quickly.\nHistory.\nThinhorn sheep and snow sheep became two separate species around the time the last ice age ended, 10,000 to 18,000 years ago."}

People may become single parents if they are breaking up with the other parent. This may happen because of domestic violence, sexual assault/rape, because the woman gives birth alone, because of abandonment, or by choice. Single-parent families are those having children that are in the control of one parent.\nDemographics.\nIn homes in OECD countries in 2011, single-parent homes made up about 3-11%. The average was 7.5%. The percentage was highest in Australia (10%), Canada (10%), Mexico (10%), the United States (10%), Lithuania (10%), Costa Rica (11%), Latvia(11%) and New Zealand (11%). It was the lowest in Japan (3%), Greece (4%), Switzerland (4%), Bulgaria (5%), Croatia (5%), Germany (5%), Italy (5%) and Cyprus (5%).\nIn homes having children in 2005\u201309, the percentage of single-parent homes was 10% in Japan, 16% in the Netherlands, 19% in Sweden, 20% in France, 22% in Denmark, 22% in Germany, 23% in Ireland, 25% in Canada, 25% in the United Kingdom and 30% in the United States. The U.S. majority increased from 20% in 1980 to 30% in 2008.\nIn all OECD countries, most single-parent homes included a mother. Between 9% and 25% included a father. The lowest numbers were for Estonia (9%), Costa Rica (10%), Japan (10%), Ireland (10%) and the United Kingdom. The highest were in Norway (22%), Spain (23%), Sweden (24%), Romania (25%) and the United States (25%).\nChildren.\nIn most single-parent families, the parent is the mother. In 2016, the number of 6\u201312 year olds living mostly with their fathers was between 5% and 36% in the many OECD countries. It was highest in Belgium (17%), Iceland (19%), Slovenia (20%), France (22%), Norway (23%) and Sweden (36%). It was the lowest in Lithuania (4%), Ireland (5%), Poland (5%), Estonia (7%), Austria (7%) and the United Kingdom (8%). In the United States it was 15%.\nImpact on parents.\nOver 9.5 million American families are each run by one woman. Single mothers are likely to have mental health problems, trouble with money, be at risk of poverty and receive low levels of social support. The mental health problems that affect single mothers include anxiety and depression.\nOften, low-income women cannot get good mental health care services. These women are less likely to receive mental health treatment.\nImpact on children.\nChildren raised by a single parent are more likely than two-parent children to have these problems: failing grades at school, committing crimes, substance abuse, poverty and being dependent on welfare. One study showed that many American children from single-parent families are less good at mathematics and reading tests than other American children.\nIn Sweden, research has shown that children living with one parent have far worse well-being, family relationships, mental health, peer friendships, physical health, bullying and cultural activities than families with both parents.\nCultural norms and attitudes.\nExperts disagree about what the most important part of a family is, especially experts in the United States. Some people say that a single parent family is not really a family."}

They usually eat grass and other plants. They live in northwestern North America, in Canada and Alaska.\nAppearance.\nThese sheep are about 1.5 m high and can weigh up to 110 kg. The female sheep have small horns but the male sheep have larger horns that twist more as they get older. The horns are tan in color. The wool of Dall's sheep is almost pure white.\nThe sheep's horns grow fastest in warm weather and slowest in cold weather. This puts rings in the horns called annuli. The number of rings shows how old the sheep is.\nThe other kind of thinhorn sheep, the stone sheep, can breed with Dall sheep. These thinhorn sheep are sometimes called Fannin's sheep.\nMost Dall sheep live to be about 12 years old, but some ewes live to be 16 or even 19.\nHome.\nThere are about 100,000 Dall sheep in the world. They live in Alaska in the Kenai Peninsula and Brooks Range. They live in Canada's Yukon and Northwest Territories in the Mackenzie Mountains, Kluane and Saint Elia ranges.\nBehavior.\nLike other thinhorn sheep, Dall sheep live in mountains. Because they do not have long legs or large feet, they cannot move easily in snow. Instead, they live in places where the wind blows the snow away before it gets too deep. They climb onto rocks to escape animals that want to eat them. They follow the same paths from summer places to winter places for generations.\nDall sheep live in herds. Most of the time, the rams live together in a bachelor herd, and the ewes and young sheep live together in other herds. Male sheep leave the female herds when they are two or three years old.\nThe sheep mate in November. Although younger rams can mate, it is mostly the older rams who actually do.\nBefore an ewe gives birth, she climbs into a rocky place that humans call a \"lambing cliff.\" She gives birth there. She and her lamb stay there for a few days before coming back down. This makes it harder for predators to find and eat the new lamb. The lamb can eat grass by October.\nPredators.\nGolden eagles, wolves, grizzly bears, and wolverines eat thinhorn sheep.\nHistory.\nThinhorn sheep and snow sheep became two separate species around the time the last ice age ended, 10,000 to 18,000 years ago. After that, the thinhorn sheep moved east and spread out. The Dall sheep and stone sheep became separate subspecies some time after that."}

He was mostly active in the areas of the philosophy of history, and cultural history. He also had antidemocratic ideas. He was part of a group of people called Konservative Revolution. His main work, The Decline of the West (original: Der Untergang des Abendlandes), he is against telling the story of humanity as a linear story of advances and successes. Instead, he says that history is cyclic: new cultures arise, they are successful, and they vanish again. He also says that the different cultures are well-defined, and clearly distinguishable. One such culture usually has a \"lifetime\" of about 1.000 years. Even in the title of his work, he says that the culture of the West (he used the term Abendland, occident, in English), is in decline. \nAccording to his contemporaries, Spengler correctly predicted some historical developments. He also influenced a few historians, such as Franz Borkenau and Arnold J. Toynbee. \nSpengler also published a number of minor works. As he saw that the Weimar Republic didn't work, he hoped that there would be a dictator thar would be strong enough to master the political challenges, in internal and foreign policy. Spengler talked about an era of wars of annihilation (such as the First World War). Spengler was also against National Socialism. He thought that antisemitism (as propagated by the Nazis) was too simple to be a solution for the problems of the time. He also thought that Benito Mussolini was better at what he did than Adolf Hitler.\nSpengler died of a heart attack in his apartment in Munich, on May 8, 1936. \nThe Nazis were ambivalent as to Spengler: Some saw him as one of the philosophical forefathers, others though that his ideas were too antiquated to be useful. As a philosopher, Alfred Baeumler was much closer to Nazi ideologies. "}

Her parents were from Grenada. Her father was of African background and her mother was of Indian background. She left her job in 2001 for unknown reasons. Shortly after, she moved to a shelter for victims of domestic violence. Around the same time, she cut off nearly all contact with her close family and friends. An investigator of Vincent's case said that she had been in a relationship that had a \"history of domestic violence\". It has been said that she may have been ashamed of being a domestic violence victim or did not want to be found by her abuser. In February 2003, Vincent moved into a bedsit flat above a shopping centre in Wood Green, north London. It was owned by the Metropolitan Housing Trust and was used for abuse victims.\nDeath.\nVincent had asthma. For two days during November 2003, she was treated for a peptic ulcer at North Middlesex University Hospital. She died in her flat sometime in December 2003 at the age of 38. Her cause of death is unknown. It is thought she died from either an asthma attack or problems caused by her recent peptic ulcer.\nVincent's death went unnoticed for over two years. Neighbours believed the flat to be empty. The strong smell of Vincent's decomposing body were thought to be caused by bins close by. On 25 January 2006, bailiffs forced entry into the flat and found her body. A pathologist said that Vincent was \"mostly skeletal\" when she was found. Her body was found with a shopping bag and wrapped Christmas presents around her. The television and heating were still running due to debt forgiveness. Her bills were being paid through automatic debit.\nIn popular culture.\nA movie about her, \"Dreams of a Life\" (2011), was directed by Carol Morley. Actress Zawe Ashton played Vincent in the movie.\nSteven Wilson's fourth solo studio album, \"Hand. Cannot. Erase.\" (2015), is inspired by Vincent.\nPunk rock musician Alex Marshall was inspired to write a song about Vincent's life. His band later decided to change the song's title to \"No One Knew\" and used the song's original title, Miss Vincent, to name the band instead. The single was released in 2012."}

The adult female sheep are smaller. Unlike Dall sheep, stone sheep do not have bright white fur. Instead, they are gray, brown, or black. Lighter stone sheep are sometimes called Fannin sheep. Some scientists think Fannin sheep are a separate subspecies of thinhorn sheep and other scientists do not.\nStone sheep have horns with different shapes, but female stone sheep have thinner horns than male stone sheep. The horns are darker in color than the horns of Dall sheep.\nThe face, backs of the legs and the rear end usually have white fur on them. The tail is usually black with some black fur on the back.\nHome.\nThere are about 12,000 to 15,000 stone sheep in the world. Most of them live in British Columbia in Canada. They like to live on steep mountains. They move around. They go to low meadows to eat plants and then go back to high, rocky places where it is difficult for other animals to catch them.\nHistory.\nThinhorn sheep and snow sheep became two separate species around the time the last ice age ended, 10,000 to 18,000 years ago. After that, the thinhorn sheep moved east and spread out. The Dall sheep and stone sheep became separate subspecies some time after that."}

Frank Howes noted, \"\"La plus que lente\" is, in Debussy's wryly humorous way, the \"valse lente\" [slow waltz] to outdo all others.\"\nThe work is marked \"Molto rubato con morbidezza,\" indicating Debussy's encouragement of a flexible tempo.\nHistory.\nA small statue may have inspired Debussy to write this piece. He kept this statue on his furniture, and called it \"La Valse\". Other people have pointed out other sources of inspiration: A piece that he had written shortly before, called Ballade, is very similar.\nDuring the same year of its composition, an orchestration of the work was conceived, but Debussy opposed the score's heavy use of percussion and proposed a new one, writing to his publisher:"}

It is the sole species in the monotypic genus Watasenia. These tiny squid are found on the shores of Japan in springtime during spawning season, but spend most of their life in deeper waters between 200 and 400 metres (700 and 1,300 feet; 100 and 200 fathoms). They are bioluminescent organisms and emit blue light from photophores, which some scientists have thought could be used for communication, camouflage, or attracting food, but it is still unclear in the scientific community exactly how this species uses their bioluminescence. The firefly squid is a predator and actively hunts its food, which includes copepods, small fish, and other squids. The lifespan of a firefly squid is about one year. At the end of their lives females return close to shore to release their eggs, and then die shortly thereafter. This mass migration of firefly squid to the shore is amazing business for Japanese fishermen, and during spawning season many go out to the bays to collect the dying squid. Many more also visit Japan during spawning season to see the bright blue light created from the firefly squid's bioluminescence light up the bay, making their spawning season not only a fishing opportunity but also a tourist attraction."}

(The ASC later changed its name to Natural Science Collections Alliance.) The ASC's Stephen R. Edwards wrote \"Mammal Species of the World\" first and started \"Amphibian Species of the World\" second. Edwards decided to write about living amphibians because Richard G. Zweifel had just written a large list of amphibian names and because experts from the University of Kansas were there to help. Darrel Frost came to help Edwards. Frost planned to write \"Turtle and Crocodilian Species of the World\" next, but he decided to finish his Ph.D. instead.\nIn 1985, the ASC gave the copyright for \"Amphibian Species of the World\" to the Herpetologists' League, and they added more amphibians to it. The League and American Museum of Natural History put D.R. Frost in charge of the project. At the time, Frost was a curator at the American Museum of Natural History. Frost added more information for professional amphibian scientists to use. He corrected bad information. He added more species that had been discovered after 1985.\nResponse.\nAccording to Amphibians.org, \"For three decades ASW has been the primary reference for amphibian taxonomy.\" In 2013, Frost won the Sabin Award for his work on \"Amphibian Species of the World\"."}

The impetus came from a charity match between FC Schmiere and Augsburg's celebrity team on July 17, 1965, which 30,000 people came to watch at Rosenaustadion.\nThe Datschiburger Kickers are still active today. More than 300 games have been played since 1965 and over 1.5 million Euros have been raised for social causes. Since the club was founded in 1965, the Kickers remained undefeated for almost 45 years. On July 23, 2010, the Datschiburg Kickers' winning streak ended in a match against the Sport Press team, which they lost 4\u20133. The team's name is derived from a nickname for Augsburg citizens, the Datschiburgers. This in turn is based on the Zwetschgendatschi, a yeast cake invented in Augsburg.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, the Datschiburger Kickers played in Augsburg's Rosenaustadion in front of up to 20,000 spectators.

It consisted of the old Republic of Genoa which Napoleon abolished and which covered most of the Ligurian region of northwest Italy, and the small Imperial fiefs owned by the House of Savoy inside its territory. Its first constitution was passed on 22 December 1797, establishing a Directorial republic. \nHistory.\nThe directory was overthrown on 7 December 1799 and the executive was temporarily replaced by a commission. In 1800 a Doge was nominated for 5 years. In 1802 he was nominated for life. The Doge had no real powers, because he and the state were controlled by Napoleon and his army. Despite the appearance as a constitutional republic with a constitution and a legislature, almost everything was decided by Napoleon, like in all the other French client states.\nThe state was briefly occupied by the Austrian army in 1800, but Napoleon soon returned with his army. A new constitution was published in 1801, establishing institutions more similar to those of the previous Genoan Republic, with a Doge who was president of a senate. The Ligurian Republic used the traditional Genoese flag, a red cross on a white background.\nIn June 1805, the Ligurian Republic was annexed by the French to the French Empire.\nAfter the fall of Napoleon in 1814, the republic was briefly restored between 28 April and 28 July. Following the Congress of Vienna it was awarded to the Kingdom of Sardinia and annexed on 3 January 1815."}

He laid the foundation stone of the Kangla, the \"Namthak Sarongpung\", which is the holiest place to the Manipuri ethnicity.\nDuring his reign, the coronation hall in the Kangla was inaugurated and a hog was sacrificed.\nAccording to the Loyumba Shinyen, he took command from Mangang Luwang Khuman for the administration of justice in the kingdom. According to the Chakparol, the ten villages of the Chakpas separated during his reign. It was right from his reign that the newcomers (immigrants) were assigned and admitted to the yek salai (clans) and the yumnaks (families) of the Meitei ethnicity. According to the Thengkourol, copper and brass were imported from Burma () and China () during his reign. \nThe first seven kings preceding his reign were sometimes considered divine, but it was right from his era that the rulers were usually regarded as human beings. He is remembered for his emphasis on ethics. Though many Manipuri Muslims claim that their earliest ancestors settled in Manipur right from the reign of Naophangba (5th century AD), the claim is clearly contradicted by the fact that Islam and Muslims first set feet in the Indian subcontinent in Gujarat, extreme Western India in 623 AD (7th century AD)."}

They saw service during World War 2 at the Battles of Coral Sea, Midway, Santa Cruz, Philippine Sea, and Leyte Gulf, among others. 2, USS Yorktown and Hornet, were sunk. \nDesign.\nThe Yorktown class were designed from the Lexington class aircraft carriers, which were built before the Yorktown class. Under the , naval size was greatly limited. This led to the scrapping of many ships. Some ships that were not completed yet were changed into aircraft carriers, and these included the Lexington class. The Yorktown class was built from the start as a carrier, which had some good sides. Early designs called for no island. However, the drawbacks from having no island were known, and the designs were switched. \nIn 1937, the Washington Naval Treaty was put out of use, and the US began building more carriers. A third member of the class, USS Hornet, was built. This also allowed the Essex class carriers to be built.\nCombat History.\nDuring the Pearl Harbor attack, Enterprise was at sea. It later helped in the first battles of the war. Yorktown arrived in the Pacific ocean on December 16th, and later joined Enterprise. Yorktown later fought in the Battle of Coral Sea, and with USS Lexington, sank the japanese carrier Shoho. \nBattle of Midway.\nOn July 4th, one of the most important battles of the Pacific campaign of WW2 began. In the Battle of Midway, Yorktown, Enterprise, and Hornet fought against 4 IJN carriers: the Akagi, the Kaga, the Soryu, and the Hiryu. Over the next 3 days, the US sank all of them. At the end of the battle, Yorktown was sunk by a Japanese submarine. \n1943-1945.\nThe next year, Hornet was sunk in an air attack at the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, leaving Enterprise the only allied carrier in the entire Pacific theater. After being upgraded and repaired, she joined the new Essex class carriers in the Pacific Campaign. She fought at the battles of the Philippine Sea and Leyte Gulf. Finally, a Kamikaze attack in May 1945 damaged it, requiring repairs until the end of the war. It helped in bringing soldiers back to the US. Not needed after the war, Enterprise was put into the reserve fleet. After efforts to make it into a museum ship failed, she was scrapped. In total, the class won 27 ."}

This is especially true for Rhaeto-Romanic, which was displaced in most areas over the centuries. This is especially noticeable in romanized terms such as Balla for Ballen (Tyrolean Oberland). In the Pustertal and in East Tyrol, as well as in Carinthia, a Slavic influence is added, which is reflected above all in a much softer pronunciation. In South Tyrol, due to the affiliation with Italy, some Italian loan words have developed.\nRegional expressions.\nIn Tyrol, dialect boundaries run west to the Alemannic of Vorarlberg, which forms a sharp border, and roughly east of Schwaz (excluding the Zillertal) to the Central Bavarian transitional area.\nNorth Tyrol.\nOberland.\nWhile in the south and east as well as in the central area of North Tyrol it is \"\u00e5lm\"/\"\u00e5jm\" (German: Alpe, Bergweide) or \"w\u012bsn\" (German: Wiese), in the west with \"\u00e5lwe\" and \"w\u012bse\" a transitional area to Alemannic (about Vorarlberg) shows up, where further west the -e also fades (\"alp\", \"w\u012bs\"). Other features of Tyrolean Oberland there are \"gsejt\" instead of \"gs\u00e5gt\" (German: gesagt) and \"it\" instead of \"nit\" (German: nicht). There is also a typical Alemannic idiom used. For example, in the rest of Tyrol it is \"I gea iatz schwimmen\" (German: Ich gehe jetzt schwimmen), but in parts of the Oberland it is \"I gea iatz ga schwimma\". This is very similar to the Alemannic \"Etzt gang i ga schwimma\".\nIn the Upper Inn Valley, diminutive forms are -le, -ele and -eli, while in the rest of the Inn Valley an -l is added. The sound groups of the short \"el\" become \"al\" in the Oberland (German: Welt - \"Walt\" or Geld - Gald)."}

The incident results in nine passengers dying.\nAircraft.\nThe incident aircraft, N4713U, was a Boeing 747 which flew for United Airlines. The aircraft was given to United Airlines in November 1970. \nFlight.\nBefore the incident, the aircraft flew the first part of the flight. It flew from Los Angeles, United States to Honolulu, United States.\nFlight 811 took off from Honolulu at 01:52 local time, with 337 passengers on board.\nSeventeen minutes after departure, as the aircraft was flying through , the flight crew heard a loud thump. About a second and a half after the thump, a cargo door opened and opened the fuselage. The resulting pressures caused 10 seats to fly off the aircraft. All eight passengers in those seats were killed, and another in a seat close to incident area.\nThe pilots first thought a bomb had exploded inside the aircraft. The incident happened two months after Pan Am Flight 103 was blown up over Scotland. They began to fly down in an emergency descent. The aircraft also turned towards Honolulu.\nDebris from the aircraft during the explosive decompression damaged engines number 3 and 4. Engine number 3 was vibrating fast, so the pilots turned the engine off. Engine number 4 failed and was producing flames, so the pilots also turned that engine off.\nAs the aircraft was beginning to land, the pilots moved the flaps and landing gear out. However, the flaps could only be moved out a certain distance because of damaged caused by debris. The aircraft landed and stopped on the runway. All passengers and crew exited the aircraft in less than 45 seconds. \nNo victims of the incident were found. Pieces of clothing and body parts were found in the number 3 engine, which means that at least one victim went into the engine."}

Because of these features, the variety can be exported easily. German Templers first grew these oranges in the late 19th century, they also introduced the name. The variety is also known by its Arabic name, Shamouti orange. Today the variety is practically extinct.\nPalestinian farmers developed these oranges, in the mid 19th century. The oranges take their name from the city of Jaffa where it was first produced for export. The orange was the main citrus export for the city. Together the navel and bitter orange, it is one of three main varieties of the fruit grown in the Mediterranean, Southern Europe, and the Middle East. The \"Jaffa\" is also cultivated in Cyprus, Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Turkey.\nJaffa oranges produce very little juice.\nThese oranges are very cold-tolerant, allowing them to grow outside of the subtropical regions normally associated with growing oranges. 'Jaffa' oranges are affected by certain types of fungus, and are prone to alternate bearing.\nHistory.\nLocated between Africa, western Asia, and Europe, Palestine produced a number of commodities for export throughout the late Turkish period (1200\u20131900 CE). Among these were Nabulsi soap, sugar, barley, oranges, and cotton. Though cotton left its mark throughout the region, the only commodity that remains a symbol of production in Palestine is the 'Jaffa' orange.\nThe 'Jaffa' orange was a new variety. Arab farmers developed it, after it emerged as a mutation on a tree of the 'Baladi' variety near the city of Jaffa, in the 19th century. While the sour orange (\"C. aurantium\") was brought westward from China and India by local traders, who may have introduced it to Sicily and Spain, the 'Jaffa' orange was developed from the sweet orange (\"C. sinensis\") which was brought from China to the Mediterranean region by Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama in 1498.\nAfter the Crimean War (1853\u201356), the most important innovation in local agriculture was the rapid expansion of citrus cultivation. One of the varieties often cultivated was the Jaffa (Shamouti) orange. A mention of an export of these oranges to Europe first appears in British consular reports in the 1850s. One factor cited in the growth of the export market was the development of steamships in the first half of the 19th century. These made it possible to export oranges to the European markets in days rather than weeks. Another reason for the growth of the industry was that the Europeans had less control over the cultivation of oranges compared to cotton, which used to be grown in Palestine, but was often replacedby the Jaffa orange.\nExports grew from 200,000 oranges in 1845 to 38 million oranges by 1870. Most of the citrus plantations of this time were owned by wealthy Palestinian merchants and notables. A citrus plantation requitred large amounts of capital, and at the start there is no yield for several years. This made it very difficult for small farmers to grow citrus fruits, on a large scale. Fruits with the \"Jaffa orange\" label were first marketed in Sarona, a German Templer colony established in 1871. An 1872 account of Jaffa by a European traveller notes that, \"Surrounding Jaffa are the orange gardens for which it is justly extolled, and which are a considerable source of wealth to the owners. The annual value of fruits grown in Jaffa was said to be 10,000\u00a0pounds.\" In the 1880s, an American grower, H.S. Sanford, tried to cultivate the 'Jaffa' orange in Florida.\nThe prosperity of the orange industry brought increased European interest and involvement in the development of 'Jaffa'. In 1902, a study of the growth of the orange industry by Zionist officials outlined the different Palestinian owners and their primary export markets as England, Turkey, Egypt and Austria-Hungary. While the traditional Arabic cultivation methods were considered \"primitive,\" an in-depth study of the financial expenditure involved reveals that they were ultimately more cost-efficient than the Zionist-European enterprises that followed them some two decades later.\nThe Zionists who immigrated to Palestine introduced the advanced cultivation methods that spurred the 'Jaffa' orange industry. According to the Hope Simpson Enquiry of 1930,\"The cultivation of the orange, introduced by the Arabs before the [beginning] of Jewish settlement, has developed [a lot] [as a] consequence of that settlement. There is no doubt that the pitch of perfection to which the technique of plantation and cultivation of the orange and grapefruit have been brought in Palestine is due to the scientific methods of the Jewish agriculturist.\"\nPartnerships in growing and exporting these oranges was an example of Arab-Jewish cooperation despite rising political tensions.\nAt the end of 1928, Jews owned 30,000 dunams of the country's 60,000 dunams of orange orchards. Whereas before World War I, the price of a dunam of land in a fruitful orange grove was 50-75\u00a0pounds sterling, by 1929, the same groves were selling for 150-200\u00a0pounds sterling.\nBy 1939, Jewish-owned and Arab-owned orange orchards in Palestine covered , employed over 100,000 workers, and their produce was a primary export. During World War II (1939\u20131945) citrus-growing declined, but recovered after the war with the vigorous assistance of the British Mandate authorities.\nLegacy.\nJaffa oranges are harvested in the Israeli territories and the Palestinian territories between November and March, with the marketing season beginning in September and extending through April. More than half the annual crop is exported, and Israel is a main provider of other citrus fruits to the European Union. In the 1950s and 1960s, Jaffa oranges became emblems of the Israeli state. A general decline in the importance of agriculture to the Israeli economy, extreme limits on available water resources, and the reliance on migrant workers have reduced productivity. Even though, manufacturing industries, such as diamonds and precision instruments, are more imprtant today, Israel still exports a large number of citrus fruits to Europe.\nThe 'Jaffa' orange is also known for lending the city of Tel Aviv-Yafo the nickname \"Big Orange\"."}

These kinds of problems are known as post-traumatic stress disorder (or PTSD) today. The term post-traumatic stress disorder is relatively new. At the time, people such as Charles Samuel Myers called this condition shell shock. Shell shock is a reaction to bombardment and fighting. Soldiers who were affected often felt helpless. Very often they panicked, were scared, and tried to flee. They were also unable to reason, sleep, walk or talk.\nDuring the War, people did not agree on what exactly shell shock was. Some people interpreted it as a physical or psychological injury, others said it was a lack of morale. In 2021, the Department of Veterans Affairs still used the term \"shell shock\" to describe certain parts of PTSD. In most cases, the term is no longer used, except for very specific injuries which occurred during the war.\nFrom World War II onwards, people were no longer diagnosed with \"shell shock\": The new term used was combat stress reaction: this is a similar but not identical response to the trauma of warfare and bombardment.\nModern cases of shell shock.\nAs outlined, the term shell shocked is used in the context of World War I, to describe early cases of what is called PTSD today. As it is a reaction to the detonation of high-impact explosives, it also has modern uses. \nWhen they were in Iraq and Afghanistan, approximately 380,000 U.S. troops, about 19% of those deployed, were estimated to have sustained brain injuries from explosive weapons and devices. This prompted the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to open up a $10 million study of the blast effects on the human brain. The study revealed that, while the brain remains initially intact immediately after low level blast effects, the chronic inflammation afterwards is what ultimately leads to many cases of shell shock and PTSD."}

These are generally crafted out of bronze. Two \"semkhai\"s equals to one \"sen\".\nAncient period.\nThe earliest known coinage was issued by during the reign of Emperor Ura Konthouba in the 7th century CE in Ancient Manipur (Antique Kangleipak). Some historians strongly opined that the oldest known coins were circulated from the 1st century CE during the reign of Emperor Nongda Lairen Pakhangba in Ancient Manipur. It is evident that bronze coins dating back to 568 AD to 658 AD were found inscribed with letters of archaic Meitei script.\nMedieval period.\nEarly medieval.\nIt is evident from the coins discovered that there was a good deal of literary activity taken place during the reign of King Kyamba. The Cheitharol Kumbaba recorded that King Khagemba issued coins along with which there was all round progress in the kingdom. In the Sana Keithel (Royal Market), there was a custom in which the king threw bell metal coins amidst the public as familiar gestures of goodwill and responsibility for public welfare. In the beginning, kings had to abandon the plan to issue copper coins when the women traders refused to accept them.\nLate medieval.\nThe coins issued before the reign of King Pamheiba () depicted legends in the archaic Meetei script. For the first time in the history of Manipur's numismatics, Garibaniwaja introduced the Nagari script in depicting the legends. The tradition of depicting Bengali script and Nagari script in the coins was followed by the succeeding rulers of later times.\nMany of the coins, issued in between seventeenth and nineteenth century AD, bear Sanskrit legends in Devanagari script. On special occasions, coins were distributed among the crowds with a grand possession of the royalty.\nModern period.\nOn special occasions, coins were distributed among the crowds with a grand possession of the royalty.\nIn the Northeast India, only Manipur struck low denomination coins that were useful for market trading. When Manipur came under the Indian Union, the Indian currency came into use. \nMinting.\nThe Senjam and the Aheibam families were engaged for making coins under the supervision of the institution of the maibas. The populace often learned about of a new ruler when coins appeared with the new ruler's name. For example, Ura Konthouba (Wura Konthouba) issued coins bearing the Meetei letter \"\uabcb\" (\"wa\") denoting his name.\nCoins in religious activities.\nThe senior most/chief male family members (pibas) used coins in the names of God Sanamahi and Goddess Leimarel and regularly perform rites and rituals in the Sanamahi Kachin (Lainingthou Kachin).\nDuring the Laiching Jagoi, an ancient dance performance in the Lai Haraoba festival, the senior most maiba has to throw a \"konyai\" (gold or silver coin) and rice into the water to invoke a deity. The art of fortune telling consists of throwing the coins on the floor and reading its results by the maibas and the maibis."}

Peter later believes that his son Chris will be smart if he becomes a Jew.\nThe episode was made during \"Family Guy\"s 2nd season. The Fox network did not broadcast it then because they thought it would be offensive to Jewish people. The episode was first broadcast on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim on November 2003. The Fox network later broadcast the episode on December 10, 2004. Before the episode was broadcast, it was put on DVD. Seth MacFarlane on the DVD's audio commentary said that 70% of \"Family Guy\"s writers are Jewish. He said he gave the episode's script to two rabbis. One of them said it was fine because \"Peter learns the right lesson at the end.\"\nA song from the episode called \"I Need a Jew\" is a parody of \"When You Wish Upon a Star\". The Bourne Company (owner of \"When You Wish Upon a Star\") started a lawsuit against the Fox network and Cartoon Network on October 2007.

{"id": "859956", "revid": "22027", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=859956", "title": "The Street Enters the House (Boccioni)", "text": "The Street Enters the House (\"La Strada Entra Nella Casa\") is an oil on canvas painting by Italian artist Umberto Boccioni. Painted in the Futurist style, the work centres on a woman on a balcony in front of a busy street, with the sounds of the activity below portrayed as a riot of shapes and colours.\nThe first public display of the painting was in Paris, in 1912, as part of the first Futurist exhibition. It is now housed in the Sprengel Museum in Hanover, Germany.\nBackground.\nBoccioni was one of the founding members of the Futurist movement. Until 1910, the group concentrated primarily on capturing \"emotion and multiple states of mind\" using techniques derived from Neoimpressionism style (for example, Severini's \"The Black Cat\" or \"The Obsessive Dancer\"). After hearing second-hand reports of the innovations of Picasso and Braque, Boccioni and his compatriots adapted their technique to match, incorporating angular lines and intersecting planes as a way of capturing multiple viewpoints in a two-dimensional image. While this was going on, there was a corresponding shift in \"what\" the group was attempting to capture as well. They began to focus more heavily on the physical and the external rather than the emotional and internal.\nIn 1910, Boccioni began a series of works based on modern urbanism. The first, \"The City Rises\", described the construction of a new city and the sights and sounds of men and horses at work. He described it as a \"great synthesis of labour, light, and movement.\" His later works, such as \"The Forces of the Street\", \"The Street Enters the House\", \"Simultaneity of Vision\", and \"Street-pavers\" and \"A Study of a Woman Among Buildings \"were elaborations on the same theme.\nComposition and interpretation.\nThe central figure of \"The Street Enters the House \"is a woman dressed in blue and white, viewed from behind and above. She looks over her balcony at a busy street scene, a riot of colours, lines, and angles. On the road in front of her, workers lift poles to form the walls of a new building, surrounded by a pile of bricks. On every side of this construction, white and blue houses lean into the street. Two of the balconies are occupied by other figures peering down into the road. A line of horses flies past the foreground.\nThe identity of the woman in \"The Street Enters the House\" is the subject of some debate. While several scholars postulate that she was an entirely imagined character, Boccioni had a history of employing the women of his family as models. This has led some to the conclusion that the figure is Boccioni's mother, and use the depiction in \"The Street Enters the House\" as evidence of Boccioni's changing view of women in general and mothers in particular.\nThe painting in general showcases Boccioni's evolution from a Neoimpressionist style to one more aligned with the ideals of Cubism, and the catalog description for the piece demonstrates his increasing fascination with scientific terminology. It includes lines such as \"The principles of Roentgen rays is applied to the work, allowing the personages to be studied from all sides, objects both at the front and the back are in the painter's memory.\" Boccioni experiments with Cubist techniques as a way of keeping elements in both the foreground and background \"rushing into the window at the same time\" He also weaves in references to his earlier works. See for example, the visual pun of the horse's appearance on the woman's buttock when compared with a line from his earlier Manifesto: \"How often have we seen upon the cheek of the person with whom we are talking the horse which passes at the end of the street.\"\nProvenance.\n\"The Street Enters The House\" was completed after Boccioni's return from Paris in November 1911. Its first public display was at the Bernheim-Jeune gallery in Paris as part of the first Futurist exhibition. The exhibition featured works by Boccioni, Carr\u00e0, and Severini, among others. It remained at Bernheim-Jeune from 5 to 24 February 1912, before moving on to Herwarth Walden's Sturm Gallery in Berlin, and finally to the Sackville Gallery in London. The painting, along with several others, was purchased by Albert Borchardt in 1913, who later donated it to the Sprengel Museum in Hanover, Germany, where it remains."}

It was his first major Futurist work.\nBackground.\nThe original title of the painting was Il lavoro (\"Work\"), as it appeared at the \"Mostra d'arte libera\" (Exhibition of free art) in Milan in 1911. Though realistic elements are present, such as the building, and the space is still rendered through perspective, this painting is considered the first true futurist work by Umberto Boccioni, even though it is not markedly different from his several previous works centered on suburbs. In this painting the naturalistic vision of the previous works is partly abandoned, replaced by a more dynamic vision.\nSubject.\nBuildings in construction in a suburb can be seen with chimneys in the upper part, but most of the space is occupied by men and horses, melted together in a dynamic effort. Boccioni thus emphasizes some of the most typical elements of futurism, the exaltation of human work and the importance of the modern town, built around modern necessities.\nThe painting portrays the construction of a new city with developments and technology. Suburbs, and the urban environment in general, formed the basis of many of Boccioni's paintings, from the capture of the staccato sounds of construction in \"The Street-Pavers\" to the riot of sound and colour offered to the observer of street scenes, as typified by \"The Street Enters the House\".\nProvenance.\nIn 1912, the picture was bought by the musician Ferruccio Busoni during the travelling futurist art exposition in Europe. It has been exhibited in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City as part of their permanent collection."}

{"id": "860167", "revid": "1068258", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=860167", "title": "Bavarian Alps", "text": "The Bavarian Alps () are a section of the Northern Eastern Alps (\"N\u00f6rdlichen Ostalpen\") in the international unified orographic classification of the Alps (SOIUSA) according to Sergio Marazzi. The same name is used in the Partizione delle Alpi for a mountain group of the Central Alps, but there it covers a larger area. The term \"Bavarian Alps\" is not used in the mountain classification of the Eastern Alps developed by the German-speaking Alpine Clubs. In contrast, the large natural region of the Swabian-Bavarian Pre-Alps largely coincides with the Bavarian Alps, but does not include some parts of the landscape (see below).\nIn a broader sense, \"Bavarian Alps\" also stands for the part of the Alps located on Bavarian or German territory. Bavaria is the only German state that has a share of the Alps. Mostly, however, the Bavarian Alps are understood to mean only the mountain parts located between the rivers Lech and Saalach in Germany. With this interpretation, therefore, the Allg\u00e4u Alps, to which the Bavarian territory has only recently extended, and the Berchtesgaden Alps do not belong to the Bavarian Alps.\nThe Bavarian Alps are to be distinguished from the Bavarian Prealps. The latter comprise only the Bavarian part of the Pre-Alps between the Loisach in the west and the Inn in the east.\nClassification.\nMost of the subsections of the Bavarian Alps according to SOIUSA each correspond to a group of the Alpine Club Division of the Eastern Alps (AVE). Only the Wallgau Alps and Mangfall Mountains subsections are combined in the AVE to form the Bavarian Pre-Alps group.\nThe Partizione delle Alpi uses the term Bavarian Alps for the entire area of the SOIUSA sections of the North Tyrolean Limestone Alps and Bavarian Alps west of the Inn.\nParts of the Alps lying in Bavaria.\nThe following table contains all mountain groups of the Alps that are at least partly located in Bavaria and thus in Germany - in the initial overview sorted roughly from west to east and indicated with maximum altitude in meters (m) above sea level (NHN). The highest mountains and heights listed refer to the part of the mountain groups that lies in Bavaria and not to the entire mountain group. For example, the highest mountain in the Allg\u00e4u Alps, the 2656-meter-high Gro\u00dfer Krottenkopf, is located in Tyrol and is consequently not included in the table.\nThe highest elevation of the Alps in Germany is the Zugspitze. It is located in the western part of the Wetterstein Mountains - which, however, do not belong to the Bavarian Alps - and has a high alpine character with a height of 2,962 m above sea level as well as two small glaciers (see high mountains). Also the partly high alpine Berchtesgaden Alps do not belong to the group of the Bavarian Alps.\nLandscape.\nLike the Alps as a whole, the Bavarian Alps as part of the Northern Alps were strongly shaped by the last ice age. Kare, lakes and the typical U-shaped valleys were formed by glaciers. Deposits of the ice-age rivers as well as especially the glaciers created a hilly landscape with lakes and bogs, especially in the foothills of the Alps."}

The movie's title is a reference for a racially and ethnically-combined middle class Lake View Terrace neighborhood of Los Angeles.\nPlot.\nAs a mixed race married couple, Chris and Lisa move themselves into a Los Angeles home. Shortly after that, however, the next-door neighbor, Abel Turner, who works with the Los Angeles Police Department, begins starting violent racial fights and arguments with Chris. Abel later starts making inappropriate comments on Chris' smoking and listening to hip hop music. As part of Abel's racist pattern of behavior, he also makes serious remarks about the ethnicity in his mixed race relationship to Lisa.\nThe following evening, Chris and Lisa have sex in the swimming pool near the house. Without the couple knowing, Abel's children, Marcus and Celia, look at the couple while they have sex. Abel then arrives to his home. He sees Chris and Lisa engaging in sex. Abel then becomes furious and angry. He then sets his home's security floodlights to shine into Chris' and Lisa's window, keeping them awake. Abel begins suggesting toward Chris that he doesn't like his (Chris') mixed-race marriage. He (Abel) wants the couple to move from their new neighborhood.\nOne evening, Chris and Lisa hear noises from the downstairs of the home. They discover the tires on Chris' car slashed. The couple suspect Abel and contact Los Angeles police. The cops, however, cannot do anything because of Abel's status within the Los Angeles Police Department. Chris fights back by shining his own security floodlights into Abel's bedroom.\nLisa begins showing she is pregnant. This causes arguments between Lisa and her husband Chris. That's because Chris is not prepared for having children. Meanwhile, Abel is suspended without pay following his abuse against a suspect. That causes Abel to become even \"more\" furious. Abel continues harassing the couple with his hosting of a loud bachelor party. In the party, Abel subjects Chris to sexual harassment by a nightclub stripper. Chris later plants trees along the fence between the couple's and Abel's properties. That causes a near-violent altercation between Chris and Abel. The latter is against having trees hanging over his property. When Chris goes to a Los Angeles bar, Abel then enters. The latter begins informing Chris that his (Abel's) own wife was killed during a traffic accident while having an affair with a white male employer. Abel then says that's the reason he does not trust white men. That is also his reason for him being against mixed-race relationships.\nAbel sends his informant, Clarence Darlington, to trash the couple's home in yet another effort of forcing them out. Lisa arrives home early and surprises the informant. They fight. Lisa is knocked out, though not before she triggers the alarm. Chris rushes home. He is followed by a frustrated Abel. When the latter comes upon his hired informant, he (Abel) shoots the informant dead to keep him quite. Lisa is rushed to the hospital. She is okay.\nWildfires are taking place in the surrounding hills. Local people are warned to leave their homes. Abel, who remains behind, enters Chris' and Lisa's house. He (Abel) hopes to retrieve Clarence's cell phone, fearing the phone will make him appear guilty. Chris and Lisa suddenly return home from the hospital before Abel finds the phone. While the couple pack up before leaving the residence, Chris discovers the cell phone. He calls the last number diales. Chris then learns Abel was responsible for the break-in. Abel learns that Chris has found the cell phone.\nAbel goes over with his gun drawn. He and Chris fight between each other. Before Lisa can leave the area, Abel shoots her car. The gun hit causes Lisa to crash into a parked car. After pistol whipping Abel and knocking him out, Chris tries to free Lisa from the vehicle. But then, Abel fires his gun towards Chris. He (Abel) misses. Chris holds Abel's other gun at him and tells him to stay back. Los Angeles County sheriff officers reach the area. The police demand Chris drop his gun. They order Abel to not move any further. Chris' wife Lisa begs for him to comply with orders. Abel tells Chris to listen to her. Chris then says Abel should have listened to his wife and asks if he saw the wife's betrayal coming. Chris then states that Abel's aggression drove her into cheating on him. Abel then becomes furious, takes out his hidden gun and shoots Chris in his shoulder.\nReception.\nCritical response.\n\"Lakeview Terrace\" was rated 44% on the Rotten Tomatoes website. The critical consensus from the site read: \"This thriller about a menacing cop wreaking havoc on his neighbors is tense enough but threatens absurdity when it enters into excessive potboiler territory.\" On the Metacritic, the movie had an average score near 47 out of 100. That meant \"mixed or average reviews.\"\nRoger Ebert from the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the movie a strong and positive review. He awarded it his highest rating of four stars. Ebert then said: \"Some will find it exciting. Some will find it an opportunity for an examination of conscience. Some will leave feeling vaguely uneasy. Some won't like it and will be absolutely sure why they don't, but their reasons will not agree. Some will hate elements that others can't even see. Some will only see a thriller. I find movies like this alive and provoking, and I'm exhilarated to have my thinking challenged at every step of the way.\" \nMick LaSalle from the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" also liked \"Lakeview Terrace\". LaSalle said: \"In its overall shape and message, \"Lakeview Terrace\" is a conventional suspense thriller, but the details kick it up a notch. ... The fun of \"Lakeview Terrace\" is not in what happens but in \"how\" it happens.\" J.R. Jones of the \"Chicago Reader\" said \"Lakeview Terrace\" was: \"one of the toughest racial dramas to come out of Hollywood since the fires died down \u2013 much tougher, for instance, than Paul Haggis's hand-wringing Oscar winner \"Crash\".\"\nThe box office.\nThe movie had a $20 million budget. It made about $44.7 million, around $39.2 million within the United States alone."}

This is done as a way to document things, or to do a portrait, for example. Abstract photography focuses on details, or on the way light is used. As a result, the object that is photographed can no longer be recognised easily. An abstract photograph often only shows a part of a natural scene. The viewer no longer has information about the context. That way, it may create a view that looks unreal. Very often color, light, shadow, texture, shape or form are used to give a feeling, sensation or impression.\nThe image may be produced using traditional photographic equipment like a camera, darkroom or computer, or it may be created without using a camera by directly manipulating film, paper or other photographic media, including digital presentations.\nDefining abstract photography.\nThere is no common definition of the term \"abstract photography\": different people use it for different concepts. On the one hand, there are people such as Aaron Siskind who photographed peeling paint, on the other, people such as Marco Breuer made prints and books without using a camera or film. The term includes many different kinds of representations; it is used to categorize a type of photography that often ambiguous. \nAlvin Langdon Coburn was the first to speak about \"abstract photography\": In 1916 proposed that an exhibition should be organized with the title \"Abstract Photography\". The entry form for the exhibition would clearly say that \"no work will be admitted in which the interest of the subject matter is greater than the appreciation of the extraordinary.\" This exhibition did not happen; Coburn later created some distinctly abstract photograph, though.\nPhotographer and Professor of Psychology John Suler wrote an essay \"Photographic Psychology: Image and Psyche. In this essay, he\" said that an abstract photograph tookaway that which is realistic or literal, such as natural appearances and recognizable subjects in the actual world. He said there was a test: If you look at a photo and there\u2019s a voice inside you that says 'What is it?'\u2026.Well, there you go. It\u2019s an abstract photograph.\"\nAccording to Barbara Kasten, who is also a photographer an professor: \"Abstract photography challenges our popular view of photography as an objective image of reality by reasserting its constructed nature...Freed from its duty to represent, abstract photography continues to be a catchall genre for the [mixing] of mediums and disciplines. It is an arena to test photography.\"\nGerman photographer and photographic theorist Gottfried J\u00e4ger used the term \"concrete photography\" to describe a particular kind of abstract photography. He said:With this, he made a reference to Concrete art, an art movement of the 1930s that strongly focused on geometric forms. \nMore recently conceptual artist Mel Bochner hand wrote a quote from the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica that said \"Photography cannot record abstract ideas.\" on a note card. He then photographed the card and printed it using six different photographic processes. He turned the words, the concept and the visualization of the concept into art itself, and in doing so created a work that presented yet another type of abstract photography, again without ever defining the term itself."}

For instance, protections for transgender sex workers and private escorts have come into place to ensure that trans women and men can work more safely.\nThe head of the religious organisation appealed to the nation in a press conference accompanied by other religious leaders at Lahore Press Club. They asked central leaders of protesting religio-political parties to keep \u201cextremist elements\u201d away from their sit-ins and called for a resolution of all issues through dialogue. Whereby Muhammad Zia Ul Haq Naqshbandi, a senior scholar of the Lahore-based head of the \"Tanzeem Ittehad-I-Ummat\" appealed to Chief Justice of Pakistan which issued a fatwa, said parents who deprived their transgender sons or daughters of inheritances were \u201cinviting the wrath of God\u201d.\nThe fatwa declared that: - \nThe controversial fatwa also stated that any act intended to \u201chumiliate, insult or tease\u201d the community was forbidden, and that transgender persons should not be deprived of family inheritances, nor the right to be buried in Muslim ceremonies.\nWhilst the fatwa has been welcomed by Pakistan\u2019s LGBT community, it was received with widespread cross-sect opposition from the country\u2019s many Islamic groups who perceived the ruling as a passive acceptance and encouragement of LGBT activity.\nThis group wields influence due to its tens of thousands of followers across Pakistan respectively.\nBackground.\nLife as a transgender person in Pakistan is difficult to say the least, but it may get a little easier with the help of a group of Islamic clerics.\nTransgender persons in Pakistan have never enjoyed equal rights to other citizens in a society where discussion of gender or sexuality was taboo. They often act as the entertainment at weddings, singing and dancing to make money, but they cannot themselves get married due to Pakistani law.\nIt was only in 2012 that Pakistan\u2019s Supreme Court ruled in favour of transgender people receiving identity cards, allowing them the right to vote after 65 years of disenfranchisement, but while this legal ruling was handed down, it has not been enforced completely.\nDespite the legal ruling, many are still not issued with a national identity card, without which they are cut off from daily tasks such as buying airline tickets or opening bank accounts. Some are forced to roam the streets as beggars by day and by night as prostitutes to survive.\nA debate on the status of transgender people in Pakistan has been building since May, following the controversial death of a transgender patient in Peshawar who was not treated by doctors after being shot multiple times.\nBut an important change in status, one that does come with limiting conditions, has been affirmed by the unlikeliest of allies.\nFifty clerics from the Tanzeem-Ittehad-I-Ummat Pakistan (TIUP, or the The Pakistan Organization for the Unity of the Muslim Brotherhood) passed a fatwa - a religious ruling that is binding upon their followers - that has changed the status of transgender people - or \"hijras\", as they are called in Southern Asia.\nAccording to the ruling, a copy of which was obtained by NBC News, transgender people who \"have the signs of masculinity\" can be legally and religiously married to other transgender people who \"have the signs of femininity\". Also, \"regular\" men and women can marry transgender partners from the opposite sex.\nBut the ruling, while granting the trans community the same funeral ceremony rights as non-transgender Muslims, also warned them that they have to live by the same code of Islam as regular Muslim men and women: \"praying, fasting, charity, performing the Hajj and other Shariat [Islamic law] duties.\"\nThe ruling goes a step further and promises transgender people rights of inheritance, saying those parents who disown their transgender children will be subjected to \"Allah's damnation.\" Also, \"taunting, teasing, attacking or even thinking of them as inferior\" is \"haram\" - strictly forbidden - according to the ruling, and \"can become a reason for Allah's displeasure.\" The fatwa, passed by Chairman TIUP Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq Naqshbandi and more than 50 other clerics, was celebrated by Trans Action Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a transgender activist group based in Peshawar."}

Hence monuments came to feature uniquely Indian architectural elements, such as corbelled arches and jali. The main buildings produced were mosques, forts, and tombs. These still stand today and are well-represented in the architecture of cities such as Lahore, Delhi, and Hyderabad, to name a few. \nIndo-Persian architecture was not exclusive to Islamic power, as the members and rulers of other religions incorporated it in their monuments.

It means the amount of elements that are heavier than hydrogen and helium. \nMost of the normal physical matter in the Universe is either hydrogen or helium. Astronomers use the word \"metals\" as a convenient short term for \"all elements except hydrogen and helium\". This is different from the usual chemical or physical definition of a metal as an electrically conducting solid. \nStars and nebulae with plenty of heavier elements are called \"metal-rich\", even though many of those elements are non-metals in chemistry.\nThe heavier elements come from stellar nucleosynthesis. Most elements heavier than hydrogen and helium in the Universe (\"metals\") are formed in the cores of stars. Over time, stellar winds and supernovae put the metals into the surrounding environment, enriching the interstellar medium. There it is material for the birth of new stars. Older generations of stars, which formed in the metal-poor early Universe, generally have lower metallicities than those of younger generations, which formed in a more metal-rich Universe."}

Marks (February 14, 1931 \u2013 June 1, 2001), also called Jamake Highwater, was an American writer, news writer and television show host. He was white but he pretended to be Native American. For many years, whites and Native Americans thought he was an expert on Native American culture. He wrote books about Native American culture. He helped make television series that were about Native Americans or had Native Americans in them.\nEarly life and parents.\nMarks was born on February 14, 1931. Alexander Hill Marks and Marcia Marks were his parents. Alexander Hill Marks had been born in New York City and Marcia Marks in Russia. Both had ancestors from Eastern Europe. Alexander Hill Marks was Jewish.\nEarly career.\nMarks worked for the San Francisco Contemporary Dancers from 1954 to 1967. He was a director and dance arranger. He got in trouble for giving students \"American college degrees\" even though his school was not accredited, meaning that no accrediting agency had said it was a good enough school to give degrees.\nClaims.\nMarks did not pretend to be a Native American all at once. He started slowly.\nIn 1969, he said his mother was Cherokee. In 1970, Columbia Records wrote that Marks' mother was Cherokee and called \"Marcia Highwater.\" In Marks' book, \"Mick Jagger\", the author page says that \"J Marks\" was only a pen name and the author's real name was \"Jamake Mamake Highwater.\"\nIn 1974, Marks wrote in a legal document that Marcia and Alexander Marks were his adoptive parents, and Marks' birth parents had been a half-Blackfoot woman and Cherokee man. Marks later said his father had also been John Wayne's stunt double.\nResponse.\nIn the 1980s, Native American activist Hank Adams found out that Marks was not really Native American and printed what he knew in newspapers. For a while, he thought Marks was really Gregory J. Markopoulos, a moviemaker. Markopoulos spoke to Adams and showed he wasn't Marks. In 1986, Adams sued Marks. Adams said in the lawsuit that Marks had lied about being Native American so the federal government would give him money for his work. The court dismissed the charges. However, Marks stopped asking for government money for projects about being Native American at about this time.\nPresident of the National Council of American Indians Joe DeLaCruz removed Marks from the NCAI in 1984. He said this:\n\"This person is not an Indian, has no personal or professional experience or academic expertise regarding Indians, has falsely held himself forth as an Indian and an Indian expert, has claimed academic credentials he does not possess and has published under his own name extremely derivative materials from the works of others. Importantly, this person has invented and repeated stereotypic and biased information about Indians.\"\nHowever, not everyone believed that Marks wasn't really a Native American. Some people believed but did not care. Marks worked as a Native American Advisor on a television show in the 1990s. When Marks died in 2001, the \"LA Times\", \"Washington Post\", and \"New York Times\" all printed articles about his life and death that said he was Native American.\nDeath.\nMarks died in 2001 of a heart attack. He had been diagnosed with AIDS ten years before. His body was burned to ashes and the ashes were put in the Pacific Ocean.\nWork.\nMarks wrote nonfiction, for example \"The Primal Mind: Vision and Reality in Indian America\". PBS made this book into a television show, \"The Primal Mind\", in 1984. Marks was the host of the show. The National Educational Film Festival said this was their program of the year. The National Cable Television Association gave it an ACE Award.\nMarks wrote fiction, for example \"Anpao: An American Indian Odyssey\" and \"The Sun, He Dies: A Novel About the End of the Aztec World\". He also wrote poetry and travel books. In 1978, \"Anpao\" won the Newberry Honor Award. It also won many awards from the American Library Association and School Library Journal.\nIn the 1990s, Marks was the Native American advisor on \"\", which had a Native American character called Chakotay."}

He did this after citing the precipitous decline in the confidence Americans have in one another.\nIn an article for ABC News, \u201cWhere philosophy intersects with war training: stoic soldiers,\u201d he and Donald Robertson advocated for using stoicism as a philosophy in the military due to its focus on wisdom, justice, temperance, and courage. He advocated for the U.S. military to incorporate stoicism into its basic training at a conference hosted by the U.S. Army National Guard in January 2021 and in a conference hosted by Modern Stoicism as one of the keynote speakers, along with retired National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster and Georgetown University Professor Nancy Sherman."}

He played Native American characters even though he was white. In real life, he told people that he was Native American. He was in more than 100 movies, many television shows, and the famous \"Crying Indian\" advertisement.\nEarly life.\nCody was born April 3, 1904 in Kaplan, Louisiana. His parents, Antonio de Corti and Francesca Selpietra, were both from Sicily in Italy. Cody and his two of his brothers, Joseph William Corti and Frank Henry Corti, went with their father to Texas and then California. Joseph William and Frank worked as actors for a while and then stopped acting. Cody's mother remarried a man called Alton Abshire and had five more children.\nCareer and claims.\nHe changed his name to Cody early. Sometimes he told people he had been born in the Oklahoma territory. Other times he said he was born in other places. He said his father was Cherokee and called \"Francis Long Plume.\" He said his mother was Cree and called \"Frances Salpet.\" He said his name had been \"Little Eagle.\"\nHe began acting in movies in the 1930s. He was in more than 100 movies, for example \"A Man Called Horse\", \"Sitting Bull\", and \"Paleface\". He was on television on \"Bonanza\", \"Gunsmoke\", and \"Rawhide\". He sometimes acted with Colleen Moore, John Wayne, Richard Harris, and Steve McQueen. So many people believed he really was Native American that they paid him to be a consultant when they made movies or television shows.\nIn the 1950s, Cody and his wife had a television show where they talked about Native American history and other parts of the culture.\nIn 1996, a news writer from the \"New Orleans Times Picayune\" went to Louisiana and found out he was really an Italian American. He talked to Cody's half sister, May Abshire. Abshire showed the papers showing Cody had been baptized, which is a Christian blessing ceremony. He printed the story, but not everyone believed it. Cody said he was Native American all his life.\nCrying Indian ad.\nIn the Crying Indian ad, Cody, dressed as a Native American, paddles a canoe through a stream. At first, the stream is clean and pretty but it becomes dirtier and full of garbage. He gets out of the stream and walks to a highway, where people throw garbage out of their cars. Then he slowly cries one tear. A voice says, \"Some people have a deep, abiding respect for the natural beauty that was once this country. And some people don't. ... People start pollution. People can stop it.\" The ad was on television starting in 1971. The group Keep America Beautiful paid for and made the ad. It was about littering. The ad won many awards, for example two Clio Awards. Television stations played it so much that their copies of the film wore out and they had to get new ones.\nKeep America Beautiful was run by packaging and drink companies. They tried to stop the government from passing laws that would be good for the environment. For example, they wanted to stop laws that would make them sell drinks in reusable bottles. Throwaway bottles were cheaper. So a law would be good for the environment but bad for the company. Keep American Beautiful wanted people to look at the ad and think individual people made pollution and not that big companies made pollution.\nTrent University history professor Finis Dunaway says that the man in the Crying Indian ad \"appears completely powerless. In the commercial, all he can do is lament the land his people lost,\" when, at the same time, real-life American Indians were working to solve their problems.\nAnother Crying Indian ad was on television in 1975. In 1998, the first one was on television again.\nMarriage and children.\nCody married a Native American archaeologist called Bertha \"Birdie\" Parker. They adopted two Native American sons named Robert and Arthur. Cody lived his private life and raised his children as if they were all Native American. He wore moccassins and other Native American clothes in public.\nBeliefs.\nAccording to his friends and family, Cody did believe that protecting the environment was very important. He worked to show Native Americans well in television and movies. He worked for Native American causes.\nLegacy.\nNot all Native Americans agree about whether Cody was good or bad or how far. The Hollywood Native community honored Cody because he represented them in movies and on television and fought bad ideas about American Indians. They said at the time that he was not Native American himself.\nDeath.\nCody died January 4, 1999 in his house in Los Angeles."}

Along with the precious floor, belonging to a noble villa of Ancient Rome, Roman columns, capitals, and a Roman wall at a depth of over 7.5 meters have been found, as well as numerous coins, objects, ceramics and jewelry.\nThe floor is now preserved in the Archaeological Museum of Lecco.\nDescription.\nThe decoration presents a composition of hexagons arranged in a honeycomb, outlined with a row of small dark tiles on a light background, internally filled with a dark hexagon with a light flower with six petals tangent to the vertices of the hexagon or a star with six points composed of a dark hexagon with, in the center, another dark hexagon delimited by six white triangles with lower vertices tangent to each other. The hexagons with the same internal decoration follow one another in alternating bands; in the preserved fragment, only the hexagons fielded by flowers are halved at the edge which, starting from the inside, is composed of a row of dark tiles, a band of three light tiles arranged perpendicularly to each other and a dark band, initially composed of a band of three tesserae with a similar arrangement and then of weaves with an oblique warp.

Bart gets the book \"The Art of War\". He uses the book to get Homer to take him to a convention for video games. The episode was written by Jeff Westbrook and Mark Kirkland is the director of the episode. About 2.15 million people watched the episode when it was first broadcast.\nThe episode makes an allusion to the documentary \"The Problem with Apu\". The documentary talks about how the character Apu Nahasapeemapetilon is a stereotype to Indian Americans. In the episode, Marge makes changes to the book she used to like (\"The Princess in the Garden\") and reads it to Lisa. The new changes make the book shorter and not as emotional. Lisa looks at a picture of Apu and says that something that was liked in the past \"is now politically incorrect\". Hari Kondabolu (the writer of \"The Problem with Apu\") wrote on Twitter that the episode did not get the meaning of the documentary. Many fans of \"The Simpsons\" thought that the show was not looking at the controversy of Apu seriously.

It is also known as pathological jealousy, morbid jelousy or delusional jealousy. The person will also behave in ways that are socially unacceptable or abnormal, but which are related to these thoughts. The most common form is characterized by delusions and obsessions. It is considered a subtype of delusional disorder.\nAs people are obsessed by the idea that their partner is unfaithful, they want to investigate and maintain their parner's fidelity, even if this causes big problems for themselves, and their partner.\nDefinition.\nThis disorder occurs when a person accuses their partner of being unfaithfuil, even if there is little or no evidence for this. Very often people will use seemingly normal or everyday events or material to show this.\nUnlike with other forms of delusion, people suffering from Othello syndrome, often stalk their partners, or they become violent. The condition can be found together with schizophrenia and a delusional disorder, such as bipolar disorder. It is associated with alcoholism and sexual dysfunction and has been reported after neurological illness (i.e. Parkinson's).\nThe name \"Othello Syndrome\" comes from the character in Shakespeare's play \"Othello\", who murders his wife as a result of a false belief that she has been unfaithful. Recently, some psychologists and psychiatrists have asserted that Othello was deceived rather than deluded about Desdemona's alleged infidelity and thus did not have \u2018the Othello Syndrome\u2019.\nTriggers.\nFor men the strongest trigger is sexual infidelity and with women the strongest trigger is emotional infidelity. If partner-related violence does not stop infidelity from happening, the male mate will sometimes commit suicide instead. The last thing to do to stop infidelity inside of morbid jealousy is to kill their partner. Women are much less likely to do this, unless they act in self-defense. Morbid jealousy can occur together with other conditions such as chronic alcoholism, addiction to other drugs (i.e. cocaine, amphetamines, marijuana.), organic brain disorders (i.e. Parkinson's, Huntington's), schizophrenia, neurosis, affective disturbances or personality disorders.\nRisks associated.\nHarm to self.\nPeople with this condition often think about killing themselves. This is also because Othello syndrome is often associated with depression and drug addiction."}

There was no verification of the events, and they are therefore seen as they are seen as the symptoms of a mental illness.\nExamples of such situations are:\nQuoting psychotherapist Joseph Berke, the authors report that, \"even paranoids have enemies\". Delusions are \"abnormal beliefs\" and may be bizarre (considered impossible to be true), or non-bizarre (possible, but considered by the clinician as highly improbable). Beliefs about being poisoned, followed, having an infidel parner or a conspiracy in the workplace are examples of non-bizarre beliefs that may be considered delusions. Any patient can be misdiagnosed by clinicians, especially patients with a history of paranoid delusions.\nOrigin.\nPsychologist Brendan Maher named the effect after Martha Mitchell. Mitchell was the wife of John Mitchell, United States Attorney General in the Nixon administration. When she said that White House officials were engaged in illegal activities, her claims were attributed to mental illness. In the end, the facts of the Watergate scandal proved her statements to be true. She was also called \"The Cassandra of Watergate\".\nEven though many of her allegations remain unproved, such as her claim that she had been drugged and put under guard during a visit to California after her husband was summoned back to Washington, D.C., in order to prevent her from leaving the hotel or making phone calls to the news media, James McCord admitted in 1975 that her story was true, as reported in \"The New York Times\". More evidence supporting that Martha was telling the truth was published in a 2017 news article in \"Newsweek\" about the appointment of a U.S. ambassador."}

The crisis was caused by bad relations between the European Union and Belarus, following the 2020 Belarusian presidential election, the 2020\u20132021 Belarusian protests, the Ryanair Flight 4978 incident, and the attempted repatriation of Krystsina Tsimanouskaya.\nLithuanian officials said the crisis was a hybrid warfare by human trafficking of migrants to Lithuania and the rest of the European Union.\nIn Poland.\nOn 12 July 2021, Polish President Andrzej Duda stated that Poland will provide assistance to Lithuania. In July 2021, Poland sent a humanitarian aid to Lithuania. Following the granting of shelter to an Olympic athlete Krystsina Tsimanouskaya and her husband, Poland also accused Belarus of organizing a hybrid warfare as the number of migrants crossing the Belarus\u2013Poland border sharply increased multiple times when compared to the 2020 statistics.\nAs Belarus-Poland relations got worse further, migrants from Belarus began to enter Poland. On 6 August 2021, Poland reported 133 illegal crossings from Belarus over two days, which is more than the total number in the previous year, with the total number of illegal crossings to date being 552. On 9 August, Poland reported an additional 349 migrant arrivals over the weekend.\nIn early August 2021, a group of 32 Afghans and 41 Iraqi Kurds appeared on the border in the aftermath of the fall of Kabul (2021) and were denied entry to either country, resulting in lines of military personnel on each side isolating the encamped migrants. Their appearance follows an influx of thousands of mostly Middle Eastern migrants that had crossed the border from Belarus into Poland and other eastern EU members Latvia and Lithuania in the months leading up to the fall of Kabul, with the EU claiming that Belarus purposefully engineered the migration in response to union sanctions. While the Belarusian government denied this accusation, Poland called it a \"hybrid attack\" on the bloc and said the migrants should not be allowed entry because they are technically still in Belarus. After the migrants sought asylum assistance, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) summoned Poland and Latvia to provide them \"food, water, clothing, adequate medical care and, if possible, temporary shelter\" for three weeks, according to a statement from the court on 25 August, although neither country was ordered to allow the migrants past the border.\nPoland, Lithuania, and Latvia released a joint statement, condemning the hybrid warfare of sending migrants over the borders. Since 18 August, 2021, Polish Armed Forces were sent to secure border with Belarus. As a response to the migrant crisis, Poland is building a wall in its border with Belarus."}

According to researchers and popular media, these people were born during and after 2010. This generation were named after the first letter in the Greek alphabet. Most members of Generation Alpha are children from Millennials or late Generation X. \nCreation of the name.\nThe name \"Generation Alpha\" was created after a 2008 survey done by the Australian consulting agency McCrindle Research. Agency founder Mark McCrindle is generally credited with the term. McCrindle describes how his team arrived at the name in a 2015 interview:\nWhen I was researching my book The ABC of XYZ: Understanding the Global Generations (published in 2009) it became apparent that a new generation was about to commence and there was no name for them. So I conducted a survey (we're researchers after all) to find out what people think the generation after Z should be called and while many names emerged, and Generation A was the most mentioned, Generation Alpha got some mentions too and so I settled on that for the title of the chapter Beyond Z: Meet Generation Alpha. It just made sense as it is in keeping with scientific nomenclature of using the Greek alphabet in lieu of the Latin and it didn't make sense to go back to A, after all they are the first generation wholly born in the 21st Century and so they are the start of something new not a return to the old.\nMcCrindle Research was also inspired by the naming of hurricanes, especially the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. In that year, six Atlantic storms were given Greek letters. \nSome expect the Generation Alpha period will be mostly defined with the COVID-19 pandemic. Many people have suggested the name \"Gen C\", short for \"Generation Covid\", for people born during and growing up while the pandemic was happening.\nDemographics.\nGlobal trends.\nGeneration Alpha was expected to come to just over two billion people by 2025. Almost three-quarters of all people lived in Asia or Africa. Nations across Europe, North and South America don't have enough children to replace themselves.\nWhen 2018 officially ended, the population of age sixty-five and older exceeded that of between ages zero through four. As of then, there were almost 705 million people age 65 and older. At that same time, those between ages zero and four were at almost 680 million.\nSome reports also stated there were too many middle aged and elderly people without enough babies with whom the adults can be replaced. When people in several places do have children, however, they tend having fewer of them and at far older ages. These areas include Australia, South Korea and the United States. These said countries often have lower fertility rates.\nIn 2019, it was reported that in almost three decades from then the number of people in Russia would go down from the 143 million to just below 132 million. That would equal just over 11 million less than that of 2018 and 2019.\nAs of then (2019), quality of life for Japan was above average. In the country many people lived to or past age eighty-four. Its under age five population was just over 3.85% then. \nUse of media technology.\nMost members of Generation Alpha are growing up using smartphones and tablet computers for their childhood entertainment. Many are exposed to such devices as soothing distractions or educational aids. Screen time with babies, toddlers and preschoolers became far more popular in the 2010s. \nBeing born in environments where the use of electronic devices is everywhere, however, has its own challenges. These problems include although are not limited to cyberbullying and inappropriate materials.\nParental Internet usage.\nGeneration Alpha are also being surrounded with adult Internet use starting shortly after their lived begin. The parents of Generation Alpha, mostly Millennials or late Generation Xers, are very heavy social media users. "}

A group called Keep America Beautiful made the ad. It showed a Native American person crying when he saw people throw garbage out of their cars.\nKeep America Beautiful.\nIn 1951, the American Can Company and Owens-Illinois Glass Company and other companies started Keep America Beautiful. Later, Owens-Illinois would own Dixie Cup Company. Television stations played it so much that their copies of the film wore out and they had to get new ones.\nThe Advertising Council helped make ads for Keep America Beautiful. The Advertising Council had already made Smoky the Bear for the U.S. Forest Service. Smokey the Bear tells people \"Only You Can Prevent Forest Fires.\" The Council decided their ad for Keep America Beautiful should be like the Smokey the Bear ads: It should tell people that their own choices solve problems.\nEarlier ideas.\nBefore the Crying Indian ad, Keep America Beautiful used a character called \"Susan Spotless.\" This was a young white girl in a white dress who shook her finger at adults who littered and told them to stop: \"Daddy, you forgot . . . every litter bit hurts!\" (In American English, some children say \"litter\" with an R sound when they mean \"little.\") The idea was that parents should be ashamed to teach their children to litter.\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, the idea that the environment must be protected became strong in America. Many of the protesters just before the first Earth Day talked about throwaway containers. For example, students from the University of Michigan put a big pile of empty drink containers on the ground outside the offices of the National Soft Drink Association.\nThe hippies of the 1960s liked the idea of Native Americans. In 1967, \"Life\" wrote that hippies saw \"the dispossessed Indian as America\u2019s original dropout, and convinced that he has deeper spiritual values than the rest of society, hippies have taken to wearing his costume and horning in on his customs,\" meaning that hippies wanted to copy American Indians.\nGoals.\nThe companies behind Keep America Beautiful did not want the government to pass laws that would cost them money. For example, they wanted to stop laws that would make them sell drinks in reusable bottles. Throwaway bottles were cheaper. Keep American Beautiful wanted voters to look at the ad and think people made pollution one by one and not that big companies made pollution.\nThe Ad Council started by thinking of litter as something ugly and poor citizenship. They said that people who littered were thoughtless and careless and made the world ugly for other people. The Keep America Beautiful media fact sheet read that littering ruined \"pleasure and recreation from their beautiful outdoors. . . . Yet their enjoyment of the natural and man- made attractions of our grand landscape is everywhere marred by the litter which careless people leave in their wake. ... The mountain of refuse keeps growing.\" They also said that litter cost money to clean up and could be bad for health.\nCrying Indian ad.\nIn the Crying Indian ad, an actor called Iron Eyes Cody, dressed as a Native American, paddles a canoe through a stream. At first, the stream is clean and pretty but it becomes dirtier and full of garbage. He gets out of the stream and walks to a highway, where people throw garbage out of their cars. Then he slowly cries one tear. The tear is made of a drop of glycerin on the actor's face. A voice says, \"Some people have a deep, abiding respect for the natural beauty that was once this country. And some people don't. ... People start pollution. People can stop it.\" The ad was on television starting in 1971. The group Keep America Beautiful paid for and made the ad. It was about littering. The ad won many awards, for example two Clio Awards. Television stations played it so much that their copies of the film wore out and they had to get new ones.\nKeep America Beautiful was run by packaging and drink companies. They tried to stop the government from passing laws that would be good for the environment. For example, they wanted to stop laws that would make them sell drinks in reusable bottles. Throwaway bottles were cheaper. Keep American Beautiful wanted people to look at the ad and think individual people made pollution and not that big companies made pollution.\nAnother Crying Indian ad was on television in 1975. In 1998, the first one was on television again.\nImage of Native Americans.\nTrent University history professor Finis Dunaway says that the man in the Crying Indian ad \"appears completely powerless. In the commercial, all he can do is lament the land his people lost,\" when, at the same time, real-life American Indians were working to solve their problems. At the same time the ad went on TV, groups of Native Americans had taken over Alcatraz.\nActor.\nIron Eyes Cody was an actor who played Native Americans on television and in movies. He had already been in many movies and TV shows before the Crying Indian ad. Iron Eyes Cody said he was a Native American with a Cherokee father and Cree mother, but he was really Italian-American."}
