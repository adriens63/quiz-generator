It was the 19th tropical storm and 12th typhoon of the 1979 Pacific typhoon season. The typhoon formed out of a disturbance in a monsoon trough on October\u00a04 near Pohnpei. At first, a tropical storm to the northwest prevented Tip from strengthening, but after it moved further north, the storm was able to gain more strength. After passing near Guam, it strengthened quickly and reached its highest winds of 305\u00a0km/h (190\u00a0mph) and a worldwide record low barometric pressure of 870\u00a0mbar (hPa, 25.69 inHg) on October\u00a012. At its peak strength, it was also the biggest tropical cyclone on record, with a diameter of 2,220\u00a0km (1,380\u00a0mi). Tip slowly weakened as it kept moving towards the west-northwest, and later turned to the northeast. Tip made landfall on southern Japan on October\u00a019, and became an extratropical cyclone shortly thereafter.\nU.S. Air Force Reconnaissance flew into the typhoon on 60\u00a0different times, making Tip one of the most closely watched tropical cyclones. Rainfall from the storm breached a wall that was used to stop flooding at a United States Marine Corps training camp in the Kanagawa Prefecture of Japan. This eventually led to a fire which killed 13\u00a0Marines and hurt 68. Elsewhere in the country, the typhoon caused lots of damage and 42\u00a0deaths and shipwrecks left another 44\u00a0killed or missing.\nMeteorological history.\nThree low pressure areas formed the monsoon trough that extended from the Philippines to the Marshall Islands. An area of disturbed weather to the southwest of Guam eventually strengthened into Tropical Storm Roger on October\u00a03. Later on the same day, the tropical system which would later become Typhoon Tip formed to the south of Pohnpei. Because Roger was so close, the storm that would become Tip was not able to strengthen much. However, it gradually organized as it moved towards the west. The tropical disturbance moved slowly and and slowly made a loop to the southeast of Chuuk. A Reconnaissance Aircraft flight into the system late on October\u00a04 confirmed the existence of a circulation center. A bit later, on October\u00a05, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) called the system Tropical Depression Twenty-Three.\nThe tropical depression into Tropical Storm Tip, but it did not organize significantly due to Tropical Storm Roger being so close. After moving slowly for many days, Tip began a steady northwest path on October\u00a08. By that time, Tropical Storm Roger had become an extratropical cyclone. At first, the storm was expected to continue moving northwestward and hit Guam. However, early on October\u00a09, it turned to the west, passing about 45\u00a0km (28\u00a0mi) south of the island. Later that day, Tip reached typhoon strength.\nAs a result of certain weather conditions, Typhoon Tip quickly strengthened in the open waters of the western Pacific Ocean. Late on October\u00a010, the typhoon reached Category\u00a04 strength on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, and the next day it became a \"super typhoon\". The central pressure dropped 92\u00a0mbar (hPa, 2.71 inHg) from October 9 to 11. During this time, the typhoon became extremely large, reaching a record diameter of 2,220\u00a0km (1,380\u00a0mi). The typhoon continued to gain strength, and early on October\u00a012, Reconnaissance Aircraft recorded a worldwide record-low pressure of 870\u00a0mbar (hPa, 25.69 inHg). The typhoon had winds of 305\u00a0km/h (190\u00a0mph) while located about 840\u00a0km (520\u00a0mi) west-northwest of Guam. At the time, the typhoon's eye was only 15\u00a0km (9.3\u00a0mi) wide.\nAfter hitting its peak strength, Tip weakened to a 230\u00a0km/h (145\u00a0mph) typhoon and stayed at that intensity for several days as it moved west-northwest. For five days, 55\u00a0km/h (35\u00a0mph) winds extended over 1,100\u00a0km (685\u00a0mi) from the center. On October\u00a017, Tip began to weaken and get much smaller. The next day, it curved towards the northeast because of a nearby trough. After passing about 65\u00a0km (45\u00a0mi) east of Okinawa, it sped up and was then moving at 75\u00a0km/h (46\u00a0mph). On October\u00a019, Tip made landfall on the Japanese island of Honsh\u016b with winds of about 130\u00a0km/h (80\u00a0mph). The typhoon continued moving rapidly northeastward through the country, and became an extratropical cyclone over northern Honsh\u016b. What was left of the cyclone kept moving northeastward and slowly lost strength. It was last observed near Alaska.\nImpact.\nThe typhoon produced heavy rain while passing near Guam, including a total of 23.1\u00a0cm (9.09\u00a0in) an Air Force base. The outer rainbands of Tip dropped moderate rain in the mountains of the Philippines.\nHeavy rainfall from the typhoon breached a wall used to stop flooding at Camp Fuji, a training camp for the United States Marine Corps near Yokosuka. Marines inside the camp during the storm stayed inside of huts near the bottom of a hill. On top of the hill was a fuel farm. The breach caused hoses to be torn from two rubber storage tanks, letting large amounts of fuel flow down the hill. The fuel was ignited by a heater used for warming a hut. This started a large fire which killed 13 Marines, hurt 68 others, and caused damage to the camp. The facility's barracks were destroyed, along with 15 huts and several other buildings. Firemen from nearby areas arrived within two hours. The barracks were rebuilt, and a memorial was created for those who lost their lives to the fire.\nWhile passing offshore, Typhoon Tip came within 65\u00a0km (40\u00a0mi) of Okinawa. Sustained winds reached 72\u00a0km/h (44\u00a0mph), with gusts to 112\u00a0km/h (69\u00a0mph). Winds in mainland Japan are not fully known. The typhoon did many millions of dollars in damage to farming and fishing industries of the country. Eight ships were grounded or sunk by Tip, leaving 44\u00a0fishermen dead or missing. A Chinese freighter broke in half as a result of the typhoon. Its crew of 46 people was rescued. The rainfall led to over 600\u00a0mudslides across the mountains of the country flooded more than 22,000\u00a0homes. It is estimated that 42\u00a0people died, with another 71\u00a0missing and 283\u00a0hurt. Around 27 bridges were destroyed by the storm, as well as about 105 dikes. Following the storm, at least 11,000 people were left without a place to live. Transportation in the country was also affected; 200 trains and 160 domestic airline flights were canceled. Tip was called the most severe storm to strike Japan in 13 years.\nRecords and meteorological statistics.\nTyphoon Tip was the largest tropical cyclone on record, with a diameter of 1,380\u00a0mi (2,220\u00a0km). This is almost double the previous record of 700\u00a0miles (1,130\u00a0km) set by Typhoon Marge in August of 1951. At its largest size, Tip was nearly as big as half of the United States. When Tip was at its peak strength, the temperature inside the eye of was 30\u00b0\u00a0C (86\u00b0\u00a0F), which is high for a tropical cyclone. Also, with 10-minute sustained winds of 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h), Typhoon Tip is the strongest cyclone in the list of tropical cyclones by the Japan Meteorological Agency.\nThe typhoon was also the most intense tropical cyclone in the world. It had a minimum a pressure of 870\u00a0mbar (hPa, 25.69 inHg), which is 6\u00a0mbar (hPa, 0.17 inHg) lower than previous record set by Typhoon June in 1975. The records set by Tip still exists, although because Reconnaissance Aircraft missions in the western Pacific Ocean stopped in August 1987, some people think there might be slightly stronger cyclones. Three researchers found that two typhoons, Angela in 1995 and Gay in 1992, had higher Dvorak numbers than Tip. They believe that one or both of the two may have been stronger than Typhoon Tip. Also, Cyclone Monica of 2006 was rated at 869 mb by Dvorak classifications, but this is not considered accurate data. Because of this, it is unknown if Tip still has the world record. Despite its record intensity and severe damage, the name Tip was not retired. It was then reused in 1983, 1986, and 1989."}

{"id": "210191", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=210191", "title": "Common scold", "text": "In the criminal common law of England and Wales, a common scold was a type of public nuisance. The term was applied to a woman who caused trouble and who disturbed the peace by arguing and fighting with her neighbours all the time. The Latin language name for this type of woman was \"communis rixatrix\". This name's grammar only applies to females. This makes it clear that only women could commit this type of crime. \nWhen British people first went to the North America, they took this crime with them. \nThe crime was often punished by \"ducking\". Ducking meant that the offender was placed in a chair over a river or pond. They were then lowered into the water, until they were all in the water. This was done several times. Few people were actually convicted of being a common scold, but it remained a crime listed on the law books of England and Wales until 1967. Because it applied only to women, it was eventually banned in the United States. This was because the U.S. Constitution (the highest law in the U.S.) does not allow people to be treated differently from each other. This comes from a section of the Constitution called the Equal Protection Clause.\nCrime and punishment.\nIn the \"Commentaries on the Laws of England\", William Blackstone says of this crime:\nLastly, a common scold, \"communis rixatrix\", (for our law-latin confines it to the feminine gender) is a public nuisance to her neighbourhood. For which offence she may be indicted; and, if convicted, shall be sentenced to be placed in a certain engine of correction called the trebucket, castigatory, or cucking stool, which in the Saxon language signifies the scolding stool; though now it is frequently corrupted into ducking stool, because the residue of the judgement is, that, when she is so placed therein, she shall be plunged in the water for her punishment.\u2014\u2014Commentaries on the Laws of England, IV:13.5.8, p. *169 \nThe common punishment for being a common scold was forcing the woman found guilty under water over and over. This was done using a piece of furniture called a \"cucking stool\". The cucking stool, according to Blackstone, later was called a \"ducking stool\".\nOther writers disagree with Blackstone. They say that the cucking stool and the ducking stool are really two different types of punishment devices. The \"Domesday Book\" mentions the use of a cucking stool in the town of Chester. The stool was also known as \"cathedra stercoris\". This Latin word translates to \"dung chair\". It is thought that the punishment involved letting everyone see the punished woman's buttocks. This type of chair was used to punish not only common scolds, but also people who make beer (brewers) and bakers who sold bad beer or bread. Francois Maximilian Misson, a French traveler and writer, wrote down the way the ducking chair was used in England in the early 1700s:\n\"The way of punishing scolding women is pleasant enough. They fasten an armchair to the end of two beams twelve or fifteen feet long, and parallel to each other, so that these two pieces of wood with their two ends embrace the chair, which hangs between them by a sort of axle, by which means it plays freely, and always remains in the natural horizontal position in which a chair should be, that a person may sit conveniently in it, whether you raise it or let it down. They set up a post on the bank of a pond or river, and over this post they lay, almost in equilibrio, the two pieces of wood, at one end of which the chair hangs just over the water. They place the woman in this chair and so plunge her into the water as often as the sentence directs, in order to cool her immoderate heat.\"\u2014\u2014Francois Maximilian Misson\nThe ducking stool was not always tied down to one spot next to a river or pond. Sometimes it had wheels on it. The woman found guilty would be taken through the streets before punishment was done. Another way of ducking was to use a device called a \"tumbrel\". The tubmrel was a chair on two wheels. It had two long shafts on its axles. The tumbrel would be pushed into the ducking pond and the shafts would be released. This would tip the chair up backwards, ducking the victim.\nA scold's bridle was another punishment device. It was known in Scotland as a brank. A scold's bridle was a metal mask that locked around a person's head. For that reason it was sometimes called a \"head cage\". The scold's bridle had a tab that went into the victims mouth to make it difficult to talk. Some people say that common scolds had to wear a scold's bridle to stop them from scolding. Some say they were used only to punish. No legal source known mentions the use of scold's bridals to punish a common scold. However, some less formal sources do tell of scolds being punished with scold's bridles. In the United States, scolds, or people found guilty of similar crimes, were sometimes punished using a cleft stick. A cleft stick was similar to a scold's bride, but they were easier to make. The ducking stool was taken to the U.S. when British people went to live there during colonial times.\nHistorical prosecutions.\nA piece of writing mounted on the Fye Bridge in Norwich, England says it marks the place where a \"cucking\" stool had been in place from 1562\u20131597. It also says that \"strumpets\" (prostitutes) and common scolds were ducked there. In the \"Percy Anecdotes\", published in 1820, the authors state that \"How long the ducking-stool has been in disuse in England does not appear.\" The \"Anecdotes\" also suggest that the ducking stool stopped being used because it did not work well. The text talks about a Mrs. Finch. It says of her that in about 1681, she had been found guilty of being a common scold for a third time. Each time she was found guilty she was ducked. When she was found guilty \"a fourth time\", the King's Bench (a court) did not order her punished by ducking. Instead, they ordered her to pay a money fine and that she be imprisoned until she paid the fine. \nThe Percy miscellany also quotes a poem by John Gay (1685\u20131732), who wrote that:\nand also a 1780 poem by Benjamin West, who wrote that:\nThese poems do not prove that the punishment took place at the time they were written. However, they do show that ducking had not been forgotten. \nIn a 1704 legal case called \"The Queen v. Foxby\", 6 Mod. 11, the lawyer for the person accused of being a scold said that he did not know of any law allowing the ducking of scolds. Lord Chief Justice John Holt (the person trying to have the judge find Foxby guilty) said this was not correct. He said that it was \"better ducking in aTrinity, than a Michaelmas term\", meaning it was better that a person be ducked in summer than in winter. The way he said it, however, suggests that he thought the punishment was an old custom and something of a joke. The last written record of stools being used for ducking involved a Mrs. Ganble at Plymouth in 1808, and one Jenny Pipes from Leominster (a town in Herefordshire) in 1809. In 1817, Sarah Leeke, also from Leominster, was sentenced to be ducked. However, the water in the pond was too low. The authorities instead wheeled her around the town in the ducking chair. \nThe common law of England\u2014law made by court precedent, rather than through legislation\u2014was adopted by the United States in its early days. The common law included the offence of being a common scold. In 1829, a Philadelphia, Pennsylvania court found American writer and journalist Anne Royall guilty of being a common scold. Royall had objected to a firehouse, built with federal money, being used by a small church for their services. She thought this violated the U.S. Constitution's separation between church and state. The local clergymen campaigned to have her punished as a common scold. Hoping the court would sentence Royall to ducking, sailors at the Navy Yard built a ducking stool. However, the Pennsylvania court ruled that the punishment was not to be used any longer. They instead fined Royall ten dollars. In 1972, in the case of State v. Palendrano, 293 A.2d 747, New Jersey State prosecutors charged a woman with being a common scold for a disturbance she had caused. The New Jersey Superior Court ruled that the law was improper because of it was too vague.\nCurrent status of the law.\nIn England and Wales, the only parts of the United Kingdom where the law was in use, no prosecutions of common scolds have occurred for a long time. The lawyers in Sykes v. Director of Public Prosecutions [1962] AC 528, described the offence as \"obsolete\". Section 13(1)(a) of the Criminal Law Act 1967 did away with it. \nThe offence of being a common scold has also become obsolete in the United States because only women could commit it. This was found to violate the U.S. Constitution's Equal Protection Clause. Many states have laws restricting public profanity, loud noise in public, and disorderly conduct. None of these laws have any punishment similar to those traditionally used for the common scold."}

It formed from an extratropical storm, and at first, it was a subtropical cyclone. However, as it moved over warmer waters, it began to gain strength. On December 9, 2003, it became a tropical cyclone. An eye formed within the cyclone, and Peter almost became a hurricane. It reached its peak winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h), but wind shear and cooler waters quickly caused Peter to lose strength. \nStorm history.\nAn extratropical cyclone developed on December 2 in the eastern Atlantic Ocean about 1430\u00a0miles (2300\u00a0km) southwest of the Azores islands. It moved northwestward, then turned to the north, and developed gale force winds on December 4 after turning to the northeast. Later that day, it turned into a frontal low pressure system. As high pressure existed across the northeast Atlantic Ocean, the storm turned to the southeast. The system turned to the south-southwest on December 7. Later that day, thunderstorms formed around the center, and it is said that the system organized into a subtropical storm late on December 7 while located 835\u00a0miles (1340\u00a0km) south-southwest of the Azores. The storm moved to the southwest over warmer waters, and the thunderstorms, or convection, around the storm continued to get stronger. The convection became near the center as rainbands developed around the center. Since the storm was gaining more strength, the National Hurricane Center declared the system Tropical Storm Peter on December 9 while located 980\u00a0miles (1580\u00a0km) northwest of Praia in the Cape Verde islands.\nSeveral days before Peter formed, forecasts anticipated the development of the storm. As it became a tropical storm, Peter was moving slowly, so initial forecasts said the storm would quickly die out. However, an eye feature quickly developed, and Peter strengthened to reach winds of 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) late on December 9. Although the presence of an eye, along with Dvorak classifications of 75\u00a0mph (120\u00a0km/h), would usually mean the storm is of hurricane strength, Peter stayed as a strong tropical storm and quickly began to weaken. It moved northward due to a cold front. The combination of wind shear and cooler water temperatures quickly weakened the storm. By December 10, Peter became a tropical depression. As the system turned to the northeast, Peter turned into an extratropical storm on December 11. Shortly afterward, it was absorbed by the cold front.\nImpact and records.\nPeter stayed over the open Atlantic Ocean for its entire lifetime. It did not affect land. Because of this, there were no deaths or damages. The storm formed in the month of December, which is rare, since most storms in the Atlantic exist between June and November. Another storm, Odette, also formed in December. This made the 2003 season the first year since 1887 that two storms developed in the month of December. Peter made 2003 the sixth most active Atlantic hurricane season (at the time, it was the fifth). The 235\u00a0days between the development of the first storm, Tropical Storm Ana, and the of the last storm, Peter, made the 2003 season the longest since 1952. Peter is one of only four Atlantic tropical cyclones to reach the \"P\" name since the official naming of hurricanes began in 1950."}

At first, the Mexican government was happy to fill the land, but most Texans soon were Americans. Mexico began to worry about losing Texas to the United States and so decided to stop all immigration from there. \nTo make things worse, Mexico had a new president, Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna, who got rid of the Mexican Constitution and made himself president for life. People in several places, especially in northeastern Mexico, joined together to fight him and the Mexican Army and to secede from Mexico.\nMost Texans wanted independence; one reason was that they refused to accept an 1829 Mexican law that banned slavery. Many from the Southern United States saw slavery as a way of life. They brought enslaved African Americans to work as field hands in the production of cotton, corn, and sugar.\nThe war in Texas lasted from October 2, 1835 to April 21, 1836. A famous battle in the war was the Battle of the Alamo in which about 200 Texans were killed. After the war, Texas was declared an independent country and called itself the Republic of Texas.\nIt remained an independent country for ten years. In 1845, the United States Congress voted to admit Texas as a slave state, which made it the country's 28th state. Mexico was angry and so the Mexican\u2013American War began."}

This includes the American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, American Bully and Staffordshire Bull Terrier, and dogs with a mix of these breeds. In some locations, the modern American Bulldog and Bull Terrier are described as a \"pit bull-type dog\". Pit bull can also mean dogs that were known as \"bull terriers\" before the development of the modern Bull Terrier in the early 20th century.\nThese dogs were bred by crossing bulldog breeds and terriers. Pit bulls are very strong and can pull many times their weight. They were also bred for dog fighting. The place where such dogs fought was called a \"pit\". As such dogs can be dangerous, very often a special permit is needed to breed or to own them. Some places or countries may have forbiddden their use."}

There are also volunteers in regions around the world. Physical exercise helps people improve their health both physically and mentally. A person with a disability gets these benefits as well as increased social activity by taking up an activity like scuba diving. The risks in training a disabled person in diving are no higher than for able bodied people.\nInstructors may have to alter some of the techniques and some equipment may also need changing to meet the individual's need. In some cases extra pool and / or open water training may be needed. In some extreme cases even individual lessons may be needed. IAHD believes that people with a disability should be in a regular class at some point in their training. Being involved with activities like scuba diving may even result in giving a person with a disability a renewed interest in life and provide positive and lasting benefits. "}

Streamlining to reduce drag in vehicles is a major field in aerodynamics. Aircraft design is another.\nThe study of gases that are not in motion is called aerostatics.\nAerodynamics comes from Aero (Air), and Dynamics (Moving).\nFor aircraft, lift (force) is the force pushing up. Gravity is the force pushing down. If lift is stronger than gravity the plane goes up. If gravity is stronger than lift, the plane goes down. In planes, lift is caused by airflow. Airplane wings are designed in such a way that, the air molecules prefer moving under the wing rather than above it, so as a result there is more air flowing underneath the wing compared to above it. This motion of the air gives upward lift to the aircraft. \"See Bernoulli's principle.\" \nThrust and drag govern forward motion. Thrust is the force pushing forward, and drag is the force pushing backward. Thrust is usually made by either propellers or jets. Drag is the force pushing backward. Most drag is caused by air friction."}

Most of the time the females are romantically interested in the main character. The term \"harem\" is generally not used by itself, but as an adjective to the genre\u2014such as \"harem anime\" or \"harem manga\". The term orginates from the Arabic word \"hareem\" which literally means women and was also used to refer to one man many women like a sultan hareem. \nDaryl Surat, a contributor to Otaku USA, suggests that many harem anime are built around one core fetish (e.g. meido (\"Hanaukyo Maid Team\"), meganekko (\"G-On Riders\"), lolicon (\"Rozen Maiden\"), nuns (\"Amaenaideyo\"), large breasts (\"Eiken\")). There are also reverse harem anime in which a female protagonist is surrounded by gorgeous boys: \"Ouran Host Club\" and \"The Wallflower\" being the best known.\nSome recent harem titles have experienced a backlash from some anime fans in the United States, particularly from females, due to recurring usage of female fan service in series with the genre designation, prompting calls of sexism from some viewers. However, this is in spite of portrayals of male sexuality in anime being a fast-growing trend in the U.S."}

The family includes kangaroos, wallabies and their relatives, and the genus \"Dendrolagus\", with eleven species. The species live in the rainforests of New Guinea, and the border of central Irian Jaya in Indonesia. In the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, Goodfellow's tree-kangaroos are listed as endangered. This is a result of too much hunting of them, and humans living too close to their habitat. \nDescription.\nLike most tree-kangaroos, Goodfellow's tree-kangaroos are very different looking from terrestrial (land) Kangaroo species. Unlike land living kangaroos, their legs are not very large compared to their forelimbs (arms), which are strong and end in hooked claws for grasping tree branches. Goodfellow's tree-kangaroos have long tails for balance. These physical traits help them with a mostly tree-living life. They have short, woolly fur, usually reddish-brown in color, a gray-brown face, yellow-colored cheeks and feet; pale stomachs, long, golden-brown tails, and two golden stripes on their backsides. They weigh about 7 kilograms (about 15 pounds).\nBehaviour.\nGoodfellow's tree-kangaroos are slow and on the ground. They move at about the speed a human walks and do not hop well (hopping is something that, by contrast, terrestrial kangaroos are famed for). However, in trees, Goodfellow's tree-kangaroos are fearless and agile. They climb by wrapping their arms around the trunk of a tree and hopping with their strong back legs. This allows their arms to slide. They have very good jumping ability and can jump from trees to the ground from thirty feet up without hurting themselves.\nDiet.\nGoodfellow's tree-kangaroos feed mostly on the leaves of the silkwood tree (\"Flindersia pimenteliana\"). Other foods are part of their diet when available, including different kinds of fruit, cereals, flowers and grasses. They have large stomachs that they use similar to fermentation vats, much the way the stomachs of cows and related herbivores digest food. First the food is softened in one part of their stomach, and then by passing the material back up and chewing it again, they can return it to a second part of their stomach. This is where bacteria in the stomach's various chambers, breaks down the tough fibers of leaves and grasses."}

The fore wing (the top wing) sometimes has white spots along the edge. The veins are lightly marked with black. The male has a black patch on his hind wing (the bottom wing). This spot releases scents to help the female find and mate with the male. This spot is called an androconium (plural, androconia). The underside of the wings is also a dark brown color. There is a band made up of square shaped spots in the center of the hind wing. The Soldier has a wingspan of 2\u00bd to 3\u00bd inches.\nSimilar species.\nSimilar species in the Soldier's range include the Monarch (\"Danaus plexippus\") and the Queen (\"Danaus gilippus\").\nThe Monarch is more orange. It has heavier black-lined veins. The underside of the wings is a pale yellowish color.\nThe Queen has nearly no black-lined veins. On the fore wing it has white spots on both surfaces of the wings.\nHabitat.\nThe Soldier may be found in a variety of open, subtropical habitats such as citrus groves, weedy water edges, and dry fields.\nFlight period.\nThis butterfly my be seen from February to December in southern Florida (it is most common in October to December). In southern Texas, it is seen from August to January.\nLife cycle.\nThe eggs are bright orange. The black caterpillar is banded with white and yellow stripes. It has a row of yellowish-tan spots near the top of the body. There are six black, fleshy filaments. The first pair is near the head. The second pair is on the thorax. The third pair is at the end of the abdomen. The chrysalis is very similar to the Monarch's chrysalis. It is very hard to tell the difference between them. It has 3 or more broods per year.\nHost plants.\nHere is a list of host plants that the Soldier caterpillar feeds on:"}

Wii is a 2009 platform game for the Wii, and is the follow-up to the 2006 game \"New Super Mario Bros.\" for the Nintendo DS. The game was first revealed at Nintendo's E3 2009 and was released on November 12, 2009 in Australia, November 15, 2009 in North America, November 20, 2009 in Europe, December 3, 2009 in Japan, and August 7, 2010 in South Korea. A follow-up to this game, which is also a sequel to the 2006 game, titled \"New Super Mario Bros. 2\", was released on the Nintendo 3DS in August 2012. A sequel to \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" and a follow-up to \"New Super Mario Bros. 2\", titled \"New Super Mario Bros. U\", was released on the Wii U in November 18, 2012, which had an extension pack titled \"New Super Luigi U\" which was also released on the Wii U June 2013.\nGameplay.\nAlthough \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" is a 2D platform video game, some of the characters and objects are 3D polygonal renderings on 2D backgrounds, resulting in a 2.5D effect (also seen in \"New Super Mario Bros.\") that visually simulates 3D computer graphics. Players can play as either Mario, his brother Luigi, or two Toad characters: one blue navy and one yellow (with the first player always as Mario). Controls are similar to those of \"New Super Mario Bros.\", with the added abilities of spinning in mid-air by shaking the Wii Remote; and picking up, carrying, and throwing other players. In multiplayer mode, players can play up to four players simultaneously. If a player character loses a life and has at least one life in reserve, they will re-emerge encased inside a bubble, and can resume play once another player frees them by touching the bubble or a fire/ice ball (the player can shake the Wii Remote to move his bubble closer to an active player, but cannot free themself). If a player loses a life and does not have any more lives, a Continue must be used to start over with five lives. Players can also encase themselves inside the bubble by pressing the A button while a more skilled player traverses a difficult segment. If every character in a co-op session enters bubbles at the same time (whether through death or pressing the A button), the level is lost, and they must restart.\nIn multiplayer mode, if one or more players do not keep up with the one in the lead, on some levels, the view will pan out a bit so that the player[s] in the rear will still be in view. If the players still do not catch up, they are then dragged by the edge of the screen, until they move forward faster or lose a life by a fall or other object. If one player enters a pipe, climbs a vine, grabs the flagpole at the end of the stage, etc. without the others, the other players will warp to the same place after a short time, or have a limited amount of time to grab the pole before the course ends. On vertically scrolling courses, being left below the screen results in losing a life. On the world map, Mario (Player 1) controls navigation.\nPlayers return to the map screen if they all run out of lives, or if all players lose their lives at the same time, leaving no one to free them. For most levels, there is a midway flag that if touched will return the player to that point after dying and being sent back to the map screen. The stage is completed by getting at least one player to touch the goal at the end, though a bonus is awarded if all players manage to grab hold of the flag within three seconds of the first player grabbing it. In a few levels, in addition to the normal goal and flag pole, there is an alternative exit leading to a red flag pole. Reaching this goal will open up a new path on the map, leading to new stages on the overworld map and on occasion a warp cannon (which will blast the player off to a later world). The game does not feature online multiplayer. During single player mode, losing a life sends the player back to the map screen.\nAlong with the usual \"Mario\" series items, as well as the Mini Mushroom from \"New Super Mario Bros.\", new items have been added, including: the Propeller Mushroom, which allows players to fly; the Ice Flower, which allow players to freeze enemies with snowballs; and the Penguin Suit which, on top of the Ice Flower's ability, allows players to slide along the ground and across water as well as have better control on ice and in water. Players are also able to ride on Yoshis, who appear in certain levels and can swallow enemies and flutter in the air.\nAll the levels can be accessed via a map screen, and enemies are often roaming it. If the player bumps into one while traveling the map, a \"mini-boss\" fight will be initiated; if successful in the fight, players can earn three extra Super Mushrooms. There are also Toad Houses where players can earn additional lives and items that can be equipped on the map screen. At some points, a Toad will appear trapped in one of the previously completed levels, and the player can choose to rescue him from a block and carry him safely to the end of the stage to earn bonus lives (this can only be done with one player). There are three Star Coins hidden in each course which can be spent on hint movies that show certain secrets, such as the location of a secret goal or how to gain infinite 1-ups. Collecting all the Star Coins within a world unlocks one course from the secret World 9 that can only be played after the main game has been completed.\nGame modes.\nThe game includes simultaneous multiplayer capability of up to four players. In addition to the main story mode, which can be played in either single-player or multiplayer modes, there are two dedicated multiplayer modes. \"Free-for-All Mode\" ranks players at the end of each course by score, coins, and enemy kills; while the other mode, \"Coin Battle,\" ranks players on the amount of coins collected.\nControl schemes.\nThe game is played either in classic style, with the Wii Remote held horizontally, or in Nunchuk style. The Nunchuk is used for movement. Some actions, such as jumping and attacks, are performed with the buttons, where others, like spinning in midair and picking up other players, are performed by shaking the Wii Remote. Certain areas of levels, such as specific platforms, can also be manipulated by tilting the Wii Remote.\nSuper Guide.\nThe game is the first on the Wii to feature \"Super Guide,\" a new system devised by Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto. During single player mode, if a player dies eight times in a row in any level, a green \"!\" Block appears, allowing a computer-controlled Luigi to show the player a safe path through the level. The player may interrupt the guide at anytime and take control. After Luigi completes it, the player has the option to try the level again, or skip it completely. However, Luigi will not reveal any Star Coin locations or secret exits. A variation of this is used in \"Super Mario Galaxy 2\", where it is called \"Cosmic Guide.\" Another variation is found in \"Donkey Kong Country Returns\", where it is also known as \"Super Guide.\" play\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nOn May 30, 2009 it was announced that two new sequels would be released for the Wii: \"Wii Fit Plus\" (a sequel to \"Wii Fit\") and a new Mario game tentatively called \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" (which it was unknown what the name of the game would be at the time), a sequel to \"New Super Mario Bros\". \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" was later officially announced at the 2009 E3 convention and GamesCom in Cologne, Germany. To highlight the uniqueness of the game, Nintendo chose the color of the case to be red instead of the traditional white.\nThe game was created in response to Nintendo's head game developer Shigeru Miyamoto's desire to recreate the \"Mario\" series's single-player gameplay experience for multiple players, as he was unable to bring these ideas in the previous installments. The Wii's hardware allowed him to display enough enemies and items on the screen at once, and allowed a camera that could dynamically adapt to the players' movements, ensuring they constantly know what is the situation of their character. Miyamoto said Princess Peach was not a playable character because of her dress, since it would require \"special processing and programming to handle how her skirt is handled within the gameplay.\" \nAudio.\nThe music for \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" was created by Shiho Fujii and Ryo Nagamatsu. There were additional compositions provided by sound director Kenta Nagata. Koji Kondo was the sound advisor and did not write any new compositions, though some of his creations were rearranged for the game. Charles Martinet returned to voice Mario and Luigi, along with Samantha Kelly as the Toads and Princess Peach, Kenny James as Bowser, and Caety Sagoian as Bowser Jr. New voice actors include Lani Minella as Larry Koopa, Morton Koopa Jr., Wendy O. Koopa, and Lemmy Koopa, Dan Falcone as Roy Koopa, and Mike Vaughn as Iggy Koopa and Ludwig von Koopa."}

A shorthand definition of niche in biology is how an organism makes a living in a place.\nHowever, the term has been used in different ways. It is not only a place but a way of life. For example, grazers, insectivores, scavengers and predators can all live their different lifestyles in the same forest. A niche can be occupied by different species in different places even though they 'earn their living' in roughly the same way. Thus the 'bird of prey eating small mammals' niche would in grasslands include the kestrel, but in an oak wood it would be filled by the tawny owl.\nThe idea of a niche in natural history is ancient: many writers noticed that animals and plants live in places where they are well adapted to live. The word \"niche\" was first used in biology by naturalist Roswell Johnson, but in 1917 Joseph Grinnell was the first to use it in a research program. Later, he described the niches of a variety of species. Grinnell was the first to offer the \"exclusion principle\" in which only one species could occupy a particular niche at any one time.\nScientists who study the interactions between living things, such as animals and their environment are called ecologists, and their branch of science is called ecology. A niche is a term which describes a position or opportunity into which some organism fits well. Thus, an ecological niche is a place in nature that is filled by an animal or plant because it is well suited to do so.\nInvasions.\nWhen a niche is left open, for example by extinction, other organisms may fill that position.\nAlso, invasive species of plants and animals in a new land often take over all or part of the niches of native organisms. Sometimes the loss results in the extinction of the natives."}

The show traveled to several other cities in Germany and Austria.\nWhile modern styles of art were not allowed, the Nazis liked paintings and sculptures that were very traditional and old fashioned.

The main thing to know is that the islands were part of Gondwana, from which they separated 84 million years (mya) ago. New Zealand has some animals and plants which survive from that time, and birds which flew there much later. The islands are well known for their terrestrial birds, some of which were large species (the moas). For millions of years the islands did not have any native mammalian carnivores, and the moas' only predators were other birds, such as the giant Haast's eagle.\nHistory.\nHumans arrived in New Zealand less than 1,300 years ago. At that time the country's only mammals were bats (which flew there), and pinnipeds and sea lions (which swam there). This meant that all the ecological niches occupied by mammals in other lands were occupied in New Zealand by either insects or birds. Because of this, the country has an unusually large number of flightless birds, of which only the kiwi, and the kakapo survive. \nBecause of the lack of predators, even the bats spend most of their time on the ground. There are also about 60 species of lizard (30 of gecko and 30 of skink), and four species of frog (all rare and endangered). There are two species of tuatara, \"Sphenodon\", the only surviving reptile in its order. These living fossils are reptiles of a type which flourished as long ago as 200 million years. While mapping its genome, it has been discovered that the species has between five and six billion base pairs of DNA sequence. The reptile now lives only on the islands in the Cook Strait and the Bay of Plenty.\nHumans brought with them the Polynesian Rat (\"Kiore\") and the dog. Europeans later brought their domesticated animals. Of these, the rats, ferrets, cats, stoats and dogs have all had serious effect on the original New Zealand animals. They have driven many species to extinction. Possums were later introduced from Australia for a fur industry, and deer from Europe as animals to be hunted. Both seriously damaged the forest habitat of many birds.\nIn recent years people made efforts to remove mammals from off shores either the animals are big or small. In some parts of the mainland, mammals are being completely eliminated inside fenced areas to create \"ecological islands\". Examples are the Karori Wildlife Sanctuary in Wellington City, from which about a ton of dead possums was removed after the installation of a mammal-proof fence, and the Maungatautari Restoration Project."}

It lasted only four days. It became part of another cyclone known as the Perfect Storm.\nGrace formed on October 26. At first, it was a subtropical cyclone. This means it was partially tropical and partially extratropical. It became a full tropical cyclone on October 27. It later reached winds of . The storm had a little effect on the island of Bermuda when it passed to the south. Another storm to the north made Grace turn east. The hurricane combined with the large circulation of the other low pressure system.\nMeteorological history.\nGrace began as a low pressure area in the middle of the atmosphere. It formed on October 23 south of Bermuda. Reports from a ship said that it was in the lower atmosphere by October 25. At first, the storm was like a subtropical cyclone. There were not many thunderstorms around its center. (For a storm to gain strength, strong thunderstorms need to build around it.) The system started being called a subtropical storm on October 26. A separate area of clouds near Bermuda slowly became involved with this storm. There started to be thunderstorms near the center of the storm. Because of this, on October 27, the storm became a tropical storm and was named \"Grace\".\nGrace continued to get larger. Information from satellites gave measures of the storm's strength. Based on that and reconnaissance reports, Grace was changed to a Category 1 hurricane. That is the lowest level on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The hurricane moved towards the northwest until an extratropical cyclone formed along a cold front on October 28. This storm quickly became stronger and very large. It eventually caused Grace to turn quickly to the east. Around the same time, Grace began to have an eye. Grace moved faster as it moved east. On October 29, it reached its highest strength. Its winds were at . Its minimum central barometric pressure was 980 mbar (hPa; 28.94 inHg). That made it a Category 2. The center of the hurricane passed south of Bermuda. Bermuda was not affected much.\nHurricane Grace turned northeast later that day. The cold front quickly came and overtook it. After that, it was no longer a tropical system. Grace moved north along the front. It combined with the large storm to the north. By the next day, Grace could not be seen any more.\nPreparations and impact.\nOn October 27, a tropical storm warning was sent for Bermuda . The next day, the tropical storm warning was made into a hurricane warning. On October 29, the hurricane warning was lowered to a tropical storm warning. This was changed to a gale warning shortly after. Bermuda had some rain and wind from the storm. The rain reached . However, no deaths or bad damage were reported. A yacht, a type of boat, that was traveling from Bermuda to New York ran into strong winds and seas high off the Virginia coast. The nine people on the boat had to be rescued by Coast Guard helicopters.\nBecause of its large size, Grace caused large waves along the East Coast of the United States. These waves reached at least high. No bad property damage occurred. There was minor beach erosion.

The image of Britannia was first used in classical antiquity. The word \"Britannia\" in Latin could mean the British Isles, the island of Great Britain, or the Roman province of Britain in the time of the Roman Empire.\nImages of Britannia show her sitting or lying down with a spear and shield. This image was first used on Roman coins in the 2nd century AD. After the Romans, the image of Britannia was first used again for coins of the pound sterling made for Charles II of England, Scotland, and Ireland. These were the first to show Britannia with a Union Flag on her shield. After many victories of Britain's Royal Navy, coins with Britannia show Neptune's trident from 1797. Her image wears a helmet on coins after 1825.\nBritannia was the common Latin name for Great Britain starting in the 1st century BC. Britannia replaced the name Albion as the common name for the island used by the Romans. After the Romans overcame the ancient Britons in war in 43 AD, Britannia could mean just the southern two thirds of the island which was under Roman control. (Caledonia, north of the River Forth in modern Scotland, was only sometimes overcome by the Roman army.) Britannia was also a goddess. Latin text on a gritstone base for a statue from Eboracum (York) gives the goddess the name \"Holy Britannia\" (). This stone was in existence in 1740, but it is now lost. A soldier in the Roman army dedicated another altar to the goddess Britannia near Castlehill Fort on the Antonine Wall. The altar is now in Glasgow. "}

The communist Socialist Unity Party of Germany (\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\", shortly \"SED\") lost their power and a democratic government was established. The policy of this new government lead finally to German reunification in October 1990.\nThe \"Wende\" was known to be very peaceful. The people who were against the SED and communism did not want to use violence, and so these events are also known as the Peaceful Revolution (in German: \"Friedliche Revolution\").\nBeginnings.\nThe \"Wende\" events were part of the fall of Communism all over Eastern Europe, for example in Poland, Hungary or Czechoslovakia. Soon there were reforms in that countries. In August 1989, Hungary opened its borders to Austria, and many tourists from East Germany crossed the border and fled to Western countries. \nIn September, East Germans were not allowed to go to Hungary any more. Soon, more and more East Germans went to the embassies of West Germany in Warsaw and especially in Prague. Soon there were more than 4,000 people in the Prague embassy. West Germany could reach that East Germany allowed its people to go. On 30 September 1989, the West German Foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, came to Prague and told the East Germans in the embassy's garden that they could go. The traveled to west Germany by trains which went through the GDR. In the first days of October, even more East Germans went to West Germany from Prague.\nMonday Demonstrations.\nIn the GDR itself, some oppositional groups were founded, for example the \"Neues Forum\" (\"New Forum\"), the \"Demokratischer Aufbruch\" (\"Democratic Awakening\") or \"Demokratie Jetzt\" (\"Democracy Now\").\nSince October 1989, there were lots of demonstrations against the SED and for democracy and human rights. In the city of Leipzig, people met every Monday in a church which is called \"Nikolaikirche\". They prayed for peace and freedom, and after that, they went out and demonstrate. These demonstrations are called \"Montagsdemonstrationen\" (\"Monday Demonstrations\"). \nOn 7 October 1989, there was the 40th \"birthday\" of the GDR. The SED held big celebrations and festivals in East Berlin and other cities. At the same time, lots of people protested in the streets, and more than 1,000 of them were arrested. In Plauen, in the south of East Germany, many people met for a demonstration. Two days later, on 9 October, there was the next Monday Demonstration in Leipzig. About 70,000 people went peacefully through the city centre, and the police or the State Security (Stasi) did not do anything to stop them. \nOn 18 October, the main leaders of the SED decided that their chairman, Erich Honecker had to resign. Egon Krenz became the new leader of the SED (\"Generalsekret\u00e4r des Zentralkomitees der SED\", \"General Secretary of the Central Comitee of the SED\") and head of state (\"Staatsratsvorsitzender\", \"Chairman of the State Council\"). He said that he wanted to start a \"Wende\", but the demonstrants still wanted the SED to give up all power.\nThe Fall of the Wall.\nOn 4 November, there was a very big demonstration on the \"Alexanderplatz\" in East Berlin. More than 400,000 people took part, and the demonstration was shown live on East German television.\nThe government of the GDR discussed a new law about travels to West Germany and other countries. In the evening of 9 November 1989, there was a press conference with the press secretary of the Central Committee of the SED, G\u00fcnter Schabowski. Just before that press conference, Egon Krenz had given Schabowski a sheet of paper about the new travel law. Before the press conference ended, a journalist from Italy asked Schabowski a question about freedom of travel. Schabowski read out his sheet of paper, which said that everyone should be allowed to leave the country and come back whenever he or she wanted. When he was asked when this rule should come into force, Schabowski answered \"at once\" and \"immediately\".\nMany people watched this press conference on TV, and the West German mass media reported that the GDR wanted to open the borders \"immediately\". So more and more East Germans went to the Wall to see if this was true. When they saw that the Wall was still closed, they became angrier and angrier. After 23:00, the border was opened at one border checkpoint, at \"Bornholmer Stra\u00dfe\", and soon the other checkpoints followed. In that night lots of people went to West Berlin and back. In the next days and weeks, thousands of people visited West Germany.\n\"Round Tables\" and the end of the Stasi.\nOn 13 November 1989, Hans Modrow became the new Minister-President of East Germany. He established a Round Table for political decisions. On the Round Table were members of the SED and its mass organisations, from oppositional groups and from the churches. In cities, towns and villages, there were many other Round Tables established, too.\nMany people in the GDR still feared the Ministry of State Security, which was known as the \"Stasi\". Modrow renamed the Ministry into \"Amt f\u00fcr Nationale Sicherheit\" (\"Office of National Security\"; AfN). The AfN started to destroy the documents which they had collected over the years. The oppositional forces wanted the documents to be kept, and so they occupied all the Stasi offices in the country in December 1989 and January 1990. The last was the Stasi headquarters in East Berlin on 15 January 1990.\nFree election.\nOn 18 March 1990, there were free elections to the parliament of East Germany, the \"Volkskammer\" (\"People's Chamber\"). These election was won by the \"Allianz f\u00fcr Deutschland\" (\"Alliance for Germany\"), a group of parties which wanted the GDR to be annexed by West Germany. The most importand party of the Alliance was the CDU, and their chairman, Lothar de Maizi\u00e8re, became the new Minister-President of the GDR. The new government started the process of reunification, which finally came to an end on 3 October 1990."}

It is in the family Papilionidae. Some authors place the species under the genera \"Iphiclides\", \"Graphium\", and \"Papilio\". Its obvious black and white-striped pattern is like the pattern of a zebra. The Zebra Swallowtail is the official state butterfly of Tennessee.\nDescription.\nThe Zebra Swallowtail has triangle-shaped wings. It has long tails on the hind wings (the bottom wings). It has some black and white markings on its wings. There are some small red and blue markings on the hind wings. There are two seasonal forms. Spring forms are more white. They have small black tails with white tips. Summer forms are more black. They have longer tails with more white in them. The wingspan is 2 2/5 to 3 1/2\u00a0inches.\nDistribution.\nThis species is found in the eastern and southeastern regions of North America.\nHabitat.\nThis butterfly can be found in a variety of habitats near pawpaw trees. Such habitats include open woodlands, grassy fields, savannas, and southern pine woods.\nFlight period.\nThe Zebra Swallowtail can be seen from late March to August in the northern part of its range. In the southern part of its range, it can be seen from February to December.\nLife cycle.\nFemales lay their eggs singly on pawpaw leaves. They are sometimes laid on the tree trunks. The egg is pale green. After three days it turns an orange-brown color. It turns dark gray just before hatching. The caterpillars are cannibalistic (this means that two individuals of the same species will eat each other). Young caterpillars are black. Older caterpillars have two different color forms. The more common form is green. It has yellow and white stripes. There is a tricolor (meaning it has three colors) band that is bluish-white, black, and yellow. The more rare form is black with white and orange stripes. The caterpillar has a bad smelling, forked gland called an osmeterium. It is found just behind the head. It will use the osmeterium to scare predators. The osmeterium can pull back inside the head when the caterpillar is not using it. The chrysalis is either green or brown. The chrysalis hibernates. It has 1-2 broods per year in the northern part of its range. It has 3-4 broods per year in the southern part of its range.\nHost plants.\nHere is a list of host plants that the Zebra Swallowtail caterpillar feeds on:"}

The Kagyu school was founded in Tibet by Naropas follower Marpa Lowatsawa. Gampopa was the first monk of the Kagyu school. Gampopa's own followers founded many monasteries which resulted in several sub-schools or branches being established. At one time there were more than twelve different branches. Today there are four separate Kagyu sub-schools:\nThe teachings of each of these schools have come down through different successions of masters since the time of Gampopa. However the teachings of all these Kagyu schools is essentially the same.\nTeachings.\nThe Kagyu school generally emphasises faith in the spiritual teacher or Lama and meditation practice over study. They teach that without this faith it is impossible to achieve the benefits and realization of meditation. However some basic study is also important. One of the most important books of this tradition is \"The Jewel Ornament of Liberation\" which was written by Gampopa. This book covers all the main teachings of Mahayana Buddhism in a step-by-step manner. In particular it teaches \nThe biographies and spiritual poems or songs of Kagyu saints, in particular the \"Life of Milarepa\" and the \"100,000 Songs of Milarepa\", are also widely read books of this tradition.\nAdvanced Meditation Practice.\nThe special advanced meditation practices of the Kagyu tradition consist of two main teachings:\nThe six yogas of Naropa involve complicated visualisation combined with yoga and breathing exercises. These practices are generally only done by monks and nuns who remain in strict seclusion for at least three years. They are called the \"six yogas\" or \"six doctrines\" of Naropa as they were originally taught by Naropa and consist of six main practices. \nThe Mahamudra meditation teachings are meditations of concentration and awareness which allow the practitioner to realise the nature of his or her mind. A student must receive instructions on Mahamudra meditation directly by a master of this tradition."}

Christopher Columbus saw on 4 January 1493 that mountain and gave it the name of \"Monte Cristo\" or \"Monte Christi\" (in English, Mountain of Christ).\nThe highest mountains in this range are to the north of the Valverde and Santiago provinces, in the central part of the range. These mountains are:\nOther important mountains are \"El Mogote\" (970 m), north of Moca, and \"Quita Espuela\" (985 m), northeast of San Francisco de Macor\u00eds. Quita Espuela is the highest mountain in the eastern part, where the range was called \"Sierra de Macor\u00eds\".\nThe \"Isabel de Torres\" mountain (799 m) is part of the Cordillera Central even if it is not completely on the range; it is 5 km to the southeast of the city Puerto Plata.\nRivers.\nThose rivers with their sources in the Cordillera Septentrional are short. On the southern side or the range, the longest river is Licey, a tributary of the River Cam\u00fa.\nOn the northern side, rivers are longer than those of the southern side and they flow into the Atlantic Ocean. Some of them are Bajabonico, Cam\u00fa del Norte, Y\u00e1sica, Boba.\nVegetation.\nIn the western part of Cordillera Septentrional, there are only small hills and the region is very dry; because of that, only plants of dry regions like cacti grow here.\nIn the central and eastern sections of the range, it rains more and there are rainforests in some places, mainly in the eastern part.\nIn the natural vegetation of the Cordillera Septentrional, pines do not grow even if they grow in the other main mountain ranges of the island.\nPopulation and economic activity.\nThere are only a few small towns in the Cordillera Septentrional; three of them are Altamira, Imbert and Jamao al Norte.\nThe western part of the range is too dry to allow any economic activity but in the central and eastern parts, farming is important. The main crops are coffee and cacao. Cattle raising is also very important where the mountains are not too high.\nAmber is found in the Cordillera Central, on the mountains north of Tamboril. This amber is used to make jewels."}

This is often, though not always, because of a medical condition. People with this condition are called dwarves or little people. A similar term for short people is midget; however, dwarves and midgets are not the same. Midgets are perfectly proportioned humans, while dwarves have a large head and misshapen limbs and torsos.\nDwarfism is often caused by the person inheriting an allele (a mutant gene), which produces a defect in development. Defects caused by genetics are the main kind of congenital defects, and usually cannot be cured. The most common cause of dwarfism is a defect in bone development called \"achondroplasia\", in which the limbs are short in proportion to the body. This accounts for 70% of cases. Extreme shortness, but with body parts of normal proportions, may be caused by growth hormone deficiency, once known as \"pituitary dwarfism\". There are more than 200 other conditions which may cause dwarfism.\nIn the 19th century in the United States, people with dwarfism were a major attraction of many circus sideshows. The most famous little people in the history of the American circus are General Tom Thumb and Michu."}

The edges of the wings are dark brown. The underside of the male's wings is mainly yellow-orange. The edges of the wings are dark brown. On the hind wing (the bottom wing) there is a brown basal (basal means near where the wings connect to the body) patch with a yellow spot in it. The upper side of the female's wings is dark brown. There are large, glassy spots near the edge of the fore wing (the top wing). The underside of the female's wings is a brownish-purplish color. The hind wing has a white streak on the top edge. The wingspan is 1\u215c to 1\u215d inches.\nSimilar species.\nThe only similar species in the Zabulon Skipper's range is the Hobomok Skipper (\"Poanes hobomok\").\nThe Hobomok Skipper has a more northern range. It has a different flight period. They also have more rounded wings. The upper side of the male Hobomok Skipper's wings has thicker dark brown edges. The underside of the male's hind wing does not have the yellow spot in the brown basal patch. While the female Zabulon Skipper has one form, the female Hobomok Skipper has two forms. There is the normal form and the \"pocahontas\" form. The upper side of the \"pocahontas\" form has smaller glassy spots.\nDistribution.\nIt ranges from Wisconsin east to the East Coast, south to Georgia, Texas, and Panama.\nHabitat.\nThe Zabulon Skipper can be found in a variety of habitats such as woodland edges, woodland openings, near roads, and near streams. It can adapt to other habitats including suburban areas, parks, and gardens.\nFlight period.\nThis butterfly can be seen from March to April and again in August to October in the southern part of its range. In the northern part of its range, it is seen from May to July and again in August to September.\nLife cycle.\nCourtship takes place in the afternoon. However, it will sometimes happen as early as 8:20 A.M. Females lay their eggs singly on the underside of host plant leaves. The caterpillar is either brown or green. It sometimes has a pinkish hue. It is often impossible to tell the difference between closely related caterpillars. The chrysalis is often formed inside a leaf shelter. It is brown. The abdomen is a lighter brown with small black dots. The hibernating stage is unknown. The Zabulon Skipper has 2 broods per year.\nHost plants.\nHere is a list of host plants that the Zabulon Skipper caterpillar feed on:"}

He was a colleague of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and believed in the underlying unity of organismal design, and the possibility of the change of species in time. He collected evidence for his claims in comparative anatomy, paleontology, and embryology.\nGeoffroy's theory.\nGeoffroy was a deist, which is to say that he believed in a God, but also in a law-like universe, with no supernatural interference in the details of existence. This kind of opinion was common in the Enlightenment, and goes with a rejection of revelation and miracles, and does not interpret the Bible as the literal word of God. \nGeoffroy's theory was not a theory of common descent, but a working-out of existing potential in a given type. For him, the environment causes a direct induction of organic change. This opinion Ernst Mayr labels as 'Geoffroyism'. It is definitely not what Lamarck believed (for Lamarck, a change in \"habits\" is what changes the animal). The \"direct\" effect of environment is not believed today by any main-stream evolutionist; even Sir William Lawrence knew by 1816 that climate does not directly cause the differences between human races."}

In 2006 there were 12,733 people living in Williamstown. It is located on Hobson's Bay, part of Port Phillip Bay, at the mouth of the Yarra River.\nWilliamstown is about 15 minutes by car from Melbourne using the West Gate Freeway or a 30-minute train journey from Flinders Street Station. Ferries on the Yarra River from Melbourne's Southbank take about 1 hour. There is also a ferry across the bay from St.Kilda on weekends and holidays.\nHistory of Williamstown.\nIndigenous history.\nThe first people to live in the Williamstown area were the Yaluki-willam clan of the Kulin people, an Indigenous Australian people. They lived and hunted along the coast from Werribee to Williamstown. The Yalukit-willam were part of the Bunurong, a language group of six clans along the coast from the Werribee River, to the Mornington Peninsula, Western Port Bay and Wilsons Promontory. They ate shell fish, birds, fish, eels, eggs, snakes, kangaroos and possums which were found across their lands. They called Williamstown, \"koort-boork-boork\", (\"She-oak, She-oak, many\") meaning \"many she-oaks\", a native tree. The head of the Yalikut-willam tribe at the time of the arrival of the first white settlers was Benbow. He became a guide to John Batman, the first European to settle in Melbourne.\nThe numbers of indigenous people went down quickly after 1835 because of diseases like typhoid. With racism and loss of hunting lands, it was impossible for them to keep up their traditional life style.\nExploration and settlement.\nThe first European to arrive at Williamstown was Acting-Lieutenant Robbins, who explored Point Gellibrand in 1803. The mouth of the Yarra River was later explored in May and June 1835 by John Batman. He thought that the area now called Melbourne would be a good settlement site. The site of Williamstown he named Port Harwood, after the captain of one of his ships.\nIn November 1835, Captain Robson Coltish, of the barque \"Norval\" sailed from Launceston, with a cargo of 500 sheep and 50 Hereford cattle. Captain Coltish chose the area now known as Port Gellibrand, as a goood place to unload his cargo. Within weeks, many ships began making their way across Bass Strait. Because of the sheltered harbour, many people decided to settle in the immediate area.\nGovernor Richard Bourke and Captain William Lonsdale visited the new settlement at Port Phillip Bay in 1837. They both thought the main settlement would be at the river mouth. They renamed it William's Town after the king, William IV. It was Melbourne's first harbour and port for the Port Phillip district until the late 19th century.\nWilliam\u2019s Town was named after the king and Melbourne was named after the British prime minister Lord Melbourne. This made people believe that William's Town was to be the capital of the new Colony. The first streets of old William\u2019s town were laid out in 1837 with that in mind. But a lack of fresh water at William\u2019s Town meant that it became necessary to change the city centre to the inland site of Melbourne.\nThe first land sales took place in 1837. Convicts built a 30 metre stone jetty in 1838. This is where Gem Pier now stands. That same year a ferry service between Melbourne and Williamstown was started. The steamer 'Fire Fly' carried passengers, sheep and cattle from Tasmania. By 1839, Williamstown had a pier and government stores built by convicts. The main part of the town was centred on Nelson Place. About 100 buildings were built, including two hotels, the Ship Inn and the Woolpack. The first cemetery in Victoria was started at Point Gellibrand.\nThe first lighthouse, made of wood with an oil-burning light at the top, was built at Point Gellibrand in 1840. In that same year a water police superintendent was appointed to Williamstown (and Williamstown is the present-day home of the Victorian Water Police).\nIn 1841 the census said there were about 259 people living in Williamstown. It is believed that there were many more. There were three hotels in Williamstown by 1841 and most of the men worked at the port. Being a busy port, there were numerous lodging houses and a constantly changing population. The years 1842 and 1843 there was an economic recession and Williamstown's population went down.\nIn 1842 the arrival of the ship \"Manilus\" threw the small colony into a frenzy. Forty-five of the ship's 243 passengers had died from yellow fever during the journey from Scotland's shores. The sick were taken to a quickly built quarantine camp. Those that died were buried in a makeshift graveyard.\nAlso in 1842, St Mary's School (the oldest continuously operating Catholic school in Victoria) was started in a small timber chapel with a wood shingle roof. Mr. John Wilson was the first teacher/principal. The earliest records show there were six boys and eight girls in July 1844.\nIn 1847 Steamboat Pier was built and a permanent customs house was set up. The water police and customs officers remained here until the Melbourne Harbour Trust developed river channels closer to the Melbourne CBD in the 1890s.\nA bluestone lighthouse was built in 1849-50 to replace the wooden one. It only operated as a lighthouse until 1860, when a Pile Light was built and anchored off Shelly Beach. It was then used as a time ball tower."}

He was originally from Troup County, Georgia, and lived for much of his life in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He is best known for his skill in the game of straight pool (14.1 continuous).\nMoore was an excellent athlete at other sports. He has set many records in billiards. He won the Michigan State Billiard Championship four times. He came in second at the World Championship five times while playing the best in the world such as Willie Mosconi, Irving Crane and Luther Lassiter. He won the United States National Pocket Billiards Championship in 1958, the National Invitation Pocket Billiards Championship in 1965, and the Legends of Pocket Billiards competition in 1984.\nMoore was known for playing in straight pool . He was a feared road player (a player who hustled while traveling across the United States). He was also known for his unusual pool style, which included wearing cowboy clothing, and an unusual way of using his pool cue when he was hitting ball\u2014a technique known as a \"slip stroke\". Moore also worked as a technical adviser for scenes in television and film that showed pool. He did so for the movie \"My Living Doll\", and the Jerry Lewis movie \"The Family Jewels\". He was honored by election to the Billiard Congress of America's Hall of Fame, the International Pocket Billiards Hall of Fame, and the Albuquerque Sports Hall of Fame.\nEarly years.\nJames William Moore was born on September 14, 1910 on a farm in Troup County, Georgia, just outside the City of Hogansville. He was the son of a Georgia blacksmith, sheriff and streetcar conductor. He began working at a young age to supplement his family's income. He worked at many jobs including as a cotton picker earning 35 cents per 100\u00a0pound, managing a fruit stand, and delivering newspapers. His family moved to Detroit when he was 13. There, he found other ways of making money. Moore ran card games and pursued other games of chance. He even pitched pennies. He was very good at gambling games and was a naturally gifted athlete. He was a Triple-A level baseball player in the minor leagues. He once bowled a perfect game, and was a good golfer.\nIn 1928 at 18 years of age, Moore took a job as a pinsetter at Car Barns, a local bowling alley, earning six cents a line. Moore learned fast. For a time he achieved a 233 bowling average. Moore first picked up a cue stick at Car Barns, playing on the single 4\u00a0x\u00a08\u00a0foot pool table the bowling alley had. According to Moore, he immediately fell in love with the game. Specifically, the game he loved was straight pool (14.1 continuous). This was the main game he competed at during his career. He did, however, play other billiard games. In fact, in later years Moore become U.S. national snooker champion, and came in second at the 1961 First Annual World's One-Pocket Billiards Tournament in Johnston City, Illinois.\nStraight pool was the game of championship pocket billiards competition until approximately the 1980s. Then, it was overtaken by \"faster\" games such as nine-ball. In the game, a shooter may attempt to pocket any ball on the table (but the cue ball). The object is to reach a set number of points which is agreed before the game. Professional competition is often played to 150 points. One point is scored for each ball sunk in a pocket that must be called by the player. According to Moore, his high run in the game was 236 ball in a row.\nSix months after he first started playing, Moore entered and won the 1929 Michigan State billiard championship. He successfully defended that title in the following three years. During the middle of the Great Depression, however, playing pool for trophies was not a luxury Moore could afford. Instead, he took his game on the road to attempt to make a living gambling.\nOn the road.\nMoore first partnered with a hustler and exhibition player names Ray St. Laurent. Laurent was a colorful character who sometimes played exhibitions wearing a red cape and mask. He was called \"The Red Devil\" for exhibition events. Laurent helped Moore, but they were not equals on the pool table. One winter evening in Canton, Ohio, St. Laurent was losing badly in a gambling session to Ohioan gambling legend, Don Willis. Willis was known as the \"Cincinnati Kid\". He was considered by many of his peers of the time \"the deadliest player alive\". The wager was 25 cents a ball. This was not a small sum at the time. Moore was providing money for the match. Moore became disgusted by how unevenly matched Laurent was with Willis. Moore told St. Laurent that he could not win and asked him to step aside and let him play. Willis later recalled:\nMoore and Willis became traveling partners after that match. They often traveled on the road with future six-time world champion Luther \"Wimpy\" Lassiter. Because of his skill and well known road partners, Moore's name began to be known in the billiard world. In 1940, the World Pocket Billiards (straight pool) titleholder of that year, Andrew Ponzi, sought out Moore looking for a challenge. At the match arranged, Moore first beat Ponzi out of $80 playing nine-ball. He then beat him at his own game, straight pool. Moore scored 125 points to Ponzi's 82.\nAfter Moore's match with Ponzi, he was hired by Ponzi's employer, Sylvester Livingston. Livingston was a man who hosted exhibitions with a lot of top pool talent, including Irving Crane. Crane, like Lassiter, would become a six-time world champion. During 1941, Moore performed 250 exhibitions across the U.S. He earned $5 for matinees, and $7 for evening performances. He lost only one match over the year. During that same time he had straight pool runs of 100 or more points in 24 out of the 250 exhibitions.\nBy that time Moore was recognizable for his cowboy characteristics. He customarily wore cowboy boots, a white Stetson hat and a string tie. He kept his hair in a crew-cut, and was rarely seen without a cigar. He was also known for his unusual form of stroke. Moore employed a slip stroke. This is a way of shooting in which a player releases his gripping hand briefly and re-grasps the cue farther back on the butt just before hitting the cue ball. Using the slip stroke, Moore was deadly accurate, but could also shoot with great power.\nIn 1945, Moore's purchased a home in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He would live there for the rest of his life with his wife, Julie Chavez, whom he married in 1949. They had seven children together: sons Jamie, Raymond and Tommy, and daughters Pamela Nathan, Kolma Moore, Emily DiLorenzo and Linda Bates. Soon after moving to Albuquerque, he became co-owner and operator of the U Cue Billiards Hall in the City. It was said that hustlers avoided going through Albuquerque just to avoid getting into a money game with Moore.\nExhibition and competition.\nThough Moore continued playing on the road\u2014as he would for over 40 years\u2014he began competing and placing in top-tier tournaments. His tournament career was to be overshadowed by an enduring series of runner-up finishes that would earn him the nickname \"pool's underpaid prince\" in such publications as Esquire Magazine. The name that stuck with him for life, however, was Cowboy. According to Moore, he became 'Cowboy' Jimmy Moore when he appeared at the Commodore Hotel championships in New York City in the 1950s wearing the required tuxedo, but nevertheless sporting cowboy boots and his signature white Stetson hat.\nThe second-place-saga started in 1951 at the two week long, double-elimination, round robin format, World Championship tournament, held that year in Boston. At the competition, Moore was defeated in his last match by Willie Mosconi. His record was seven wins in nine matches, including triumphs over future Billiard Congress of America (BCA) Hall-of-Famers, Irving Crane and Arthur \"Babe\" Cranfield.\nIn 1952 he made a strong showing in the same competition, held once more in Boston, running 93 balls against Lassiter, beating him 150\u00a0to\u00a025, but again finishing behind Willie Mosconi, this time sharing second place with Jimmy Caras and Joe Procita. Moore's match with Mosconi had an ending score of 150\u00a0to\u00a058 in 19 innings. Moore competed in the 1953 World Championship in San Francisco, but did not place, losing in his last match to Crane, 150-56 in 7 innings.\nThe following year Moore took second place yet again in the World Championship, held that year in Philadelphia. The 1954 tournament was not sponsored and was unsanctioned by the BCA; in its absence being organized by Irving Crane. It was denominated by newspapers, such as \"The New York Times\", as the \"Unofficial World Pocket Billiard Championship.\" In a career highlight in the penultimate match there, Moore was losing 148\u00a0to\u00a08 to Irving Crane. When Crane let him back to the table, Moore ran 142 balls and out. Despite this feat, Moore was dispatched to second place by Lassiter, with a final score of 150\u00a0to\u00a095, sharing second place with Crane. The defending champion, Mosconi, did not participate.\nMoore's runner-up streak continued in the 1956 World Championship held at Judice's Academy in Brooklyn, New York. He clinched second place, to Willie Mosconi's now almost ubiquitous first, with a 150\u00a0to\u00a050 score over Al Coslosky of Philadelphia in 15 innings, a win over Richard Riggie of Baltimore, 150\u00a0to\u00a0121, with an inspired run of 107 balls, but a loss to Lassiter, 150\u00a0to\u00a070 in 7 innings. That same year Moore played Mosconi at a challenge match in Kinston, North Carolina. It was not Moore's day as Mosconi posted a career highlight; a perfect match\u2014150 balls in a row in one inning.\nIn all, Moore came in second at the World Championship five times but never took the crown. He did however win the National Pocket Billiards Championship held in Chicago at Bensinger's Billiards in 1958. The tournament was a challenge match, marathon straight pool race to 3,000 points between Moore and Luther Lassiter. It was a tight competition, with Lassiter leading at one point 1,800\u00a0to\u00a01,512. Moore battled back and eventually won with a final score of 3,000\u00a0to\u00a02,634.\nMoore would eventually have ten second-place finishes in world-title competition. Nevertheless, he frequently competed with and beat all of the players whom he so often played second fiddle to in sanctioned tournament play. In fact, later in 1958, the same year he won the National Pocket Billiards Championship against Lassiter, he roundly defeated Mosconi in a two-day exhibition match in his home town of Albuquerque, with a final score of 500\u00a0to\u00a0397. Moore and Mosconi would battle it out many times in unsanctioned but publicized play. In addition to matches previously mentioned, they vied at Albuquerque's old Chaplin Alley on 1956; at the Highland Bowl in 1958; and later, in matches in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Philadelphia, Chicago and Johnston City at the Jansco Brother's Stardust Open, where Moore would win the prize for \"all-around honors\".\nIt was not until 1965 at the National Invitation Pocket Billiards Championship, seven years after his last first-place finish, that he would repeat as champion in a sanctioned tournament. At that contest held at the Riviera Terrace in New York City, along the way to first place and the prize of $4,000, Moore defeated: Onofrio Lauri 150\u00a0to\u00a0117; Joe Balsis 150\u00a0to\u00a0-3; Cisero Murphy 150\u00a0to\u00a096; \"Champagne\" Edwin Kelly 150\u00a0to\u00a083 in 3 innings; and the ever-present Luther Lassiter, 150\u00a0to\u00a041 in 4 innings. The runner up in the tourney was Joe Balsis.\nIn addition to competition, Moore served as a technical adviser for billiard-related scenes in television and film, including \"My Living Doll\" starring Julie Newmar and Robert Cummings in 1964, and the Jerry Lewis movie \"The Family Jewels\" in 1965.\nLater life.\nMoore was inducted into the International Pocket Billiards Hall of Fame in 1982, the Billiard Congress of America's Hall of Fame in 1994, and the Albuquerque Sports Hall of Fame in 1998. He remained competitive in tournament and match play well into his 70s. In 1984, at age 74, Moore won the Legends of Pocket Billiards competition on ESPN. Even in later years he was still deadly on a pool table, running 111 balls three days after his 80th birthday. \"Until the traffic accident I had about a year ago, I was still playing my usual speed\" Moore said in July 1999 at the age of 89. However, Moore's health declined rapidly that same year. He died on November 17, 1999 of natural causes."}

So it's important to make sure that you go in the order of formula_1.\nVariations.\nThere is another rule called the right-hand grip rule (or corkscrew rule) that is used for magnetic fields and things that rotate. \nYou can do this in reverse by starting your thumb in the direction of the vector and see how your fingers curl to see the direction of rotation. If you point your thumb in the direction of current in a wire, the magnetic field that comes up around it is in the direction of your curling fingers."}

Permeability is measured in henries per metre (H/m) and its symbol is formula_1. \nSince empty space has a constant permeability (called the permeability of free space or formula_2) of exactly formula_3, most materials are listed with a \"relative permeability\" (symbol formula_4). Relative permeability is the permeability of the material divided by the permeability of free space (formula_5). The permeability of most materials is very close to 1. That means that the permeability of most materials is close enough that we can typically ignore it and use the permeability of free space instead. The biggest exceptions are materials called ferromagnetic materials. Some examples are iron (5000) and nickel (600). Some materials have been specially designed to have a permeability one million times larger than empty space."}

A minaret is a tower-like structure belonging to a mosque. Its main use is to call the worshippers to prayer, much like a belltower of a Christian church. On 1st May 2007, the Swiss People's Party and the Federal Democratic Union launched a popular referendum. They want to ban the construction of minarets in Switzerland. The Swiss people voted in favor of the issue on November 29, 2009. \nBackground.\nThere are two disputes that form the basis of the controversy:\nBuilding minarets.\nThe Swiss Minaret controversy started in the Eastern part of Switerland, in 2005. A Turkish cultural association applied for the permit to build a six metre high tower (a minaret) on the roof of the center where they met. The residents around it did not like the idea. They therefore formed an association to oppose it. The people in this association were biased, they had strong (Christian) religious views. Some of the members of the association were also in the committee that had to assess the building plans. As a matter of course, the plans were rejected. The matter was taken to Court, and the Islamic community lost the case. In 2009, the tower was built despite the previous loss.\nThere are other communes where similar scenes happened.\nPolitical discussion.\nThe two parties (UDC,FDU) tried several motions at the cantonal level to ban minaret-building. This never came to the vote, though, because all cantonal parliaments found the motions unconstitutional.\nIn 2007, the parties launched a motion at the federal level. Unlike at the cantonal level, intitiatives at the federal level cannot be reviewed, and found unconstitutional. The motion wants to ban the building of minarets in Switzerland. The committee\u2019s proposition reads: \"The building of minarets is prohibited\". If it became law, it would be written into Article 72 (Section 3) of the Swiss Federal Constitution."}

The person doing the shooting will often either commit suicide at the end, or they'll arrange the situation in such a way that they are killed by police, or other security forces.

The club was part of the Jewish sports club Hakoah (Hebrew-the strength)which is still existing.\nHistory.\nThe club was founded in 1909. In its first year, the club's athletes competed in fencing, football, field hockey, track &amp; field, wrestling and swimming. It was one of the first team which travelled around the world to play matches. Therefore Hakoah Vienna had supporters under Jews in many countries of Europe. One of them was the author Franz Kafka.\nHakoah was one of the best football clubs in Austria before the Second World War. The club was the first from the continent which was able to defeat an English club on the island (Westham United-Hakoah Vienna 0 : 5) and on Juli 15th, 1917 goalkeeper Willy Halpern was the first Hakoahplayer in the nationalteam. 1919 Hakoah reached the first class. \nIn the 1924/25 season Hakoah Vienna became Austrian Champion. In 1926 the club made a tour to the United States and played in New York where they had 46 000 spectators. This was a record for this time. Impressed by the relatively lack of antisemitism and good payment half of the team stayed in the USA. In New York some players formed the New York Hakoah. Others went to Palestine and founded Hakoah Tel Aviv. This led to the relegation into the second class. In the 1937/38 season they were leaders but the occupation of Austria by Germany led to the cancellation of all matches. Like all other Jewish sportsclubs Hakoah Vienna was dissolved during the time of Nazioccupation and lost all their properties. From the football players of Hakoah Oskar Grasgr\u00fcn, Ernst Horowitz, Josef Kolisch, Erwin, Oskar Pollak, Max Scheuer and Ali Sch\u00f6nfeld were murderd by the Nazis. Fritz Weinberger und Julius Zwickler were murderd in concentration camps. Many of the players who were able to left Austria went to Palestine and played for Hakoah Tel Aviv.\n1945 the club was renewed.The football team, which played in the second division of the Austrian championship after World War II, was dissolved in 1949. Under the name SC Maccabi Wien the club is now playing in a minor league.\nOne of the notable players of Hakoah Vienna was B\u00e9la Guttmann, who played for Hakoah from 1922 to 1926 and after the end of his career he became manager in Italy, South America and Europe."}

On May 11, 1899, there was a disastrous fire which destroyed most of the town, more than 400 houses and businesses were lost in the blaze. It was a World War I battlefield between Austrian and Imperial Russian troops until the Russians were driven out in 1917.\nBetween 1960 and 1963 the fossils of prehistoric fish, about 1.90 metres long were discovered in rocks near the town. The fish was an unknown Palaeorhynchus, a kind of mackerel, which lived about 30 million years ago. It was named Palegrhynchus humorensis, after the city. The area was made a special reserve in 1973.\nOn October 10, 1941, during World War II, 2945 Jewish men, women and children were sent from Gura Humorului to Transnistria.

The first name of the movement was \"Hanoar HaOved\" (\"The Working Youth\") and it was connected to the Histadrut (Israeli workers union). In 1959, it was connected with \"HaTnua HaMeu'he'det\" (, \"The United Movement\") and the name was changed to \"HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed.\" It is a sister movement of Habonim Dror which is active abroad, outside of Israel.\nOrganization and activities.\nThe movement is organized by junior and senior counselors who plan and hold programs for younger members. These are after-school activities and also during school holidays. Usually members join in elementary school in fourth grade. The chance to become a junior counselor starts in ninth grade, with a training program during the summer before starting tenth grade. Each branch is assigned a leader doing the national service year after high school, guiding the local junior and senior counselors. Much of the programs are about Israeli and Jewish history and culture. (See Values, below) \nValues.\nHaNoar HaOved Ve HaLomed is a Zionist educational and social organization. It believes that the State of Israel is the homeland of the Jewish people. Its members are dedicated to living in Israel and taking part in defending it and building it. That means that most or all members do a year of national service in the community after high school, then are drafted into the Israeli army after high school, and afterwards plan to live in Israel as adults. They believe in the values of democracy and socialist principles like social welfare to take care of the weaker members of the population. They may want to join a kibbutz or other cooperative way of living. They often join the youth wings of Israeli political parties and take part in rallies and work in support of their beliefs.\nNot all members follow the Jewish religion. Those from Jewish families usually come from a secular or traditional home, as do the majority of Israelis. They see Jewish tradition and Jewish history as a source of inspiration and influence. They respect all the cultures that make up Israel's pluralistic society and uphold freedom of speech and worship. There are branches in Israel for Arab and Druze youngsters. The movement website has pages in Hebrew, Arabic, Russian, and English.\nUniforms.\nA cotton long-sleeved collared shirt is typical of several Israeli youth movements. The shirt of the HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed is a blue shirt, the color symbolising the working class. The red lacing at the neck opening is the color which symbolises Socialism. The shirt is printed front and back with white lettering describing the movement with its symbols, and sometimes giving locations of the wearer's local \"ken\" or for a movement event.\nDirections as adults.\nIn the 1990s, following the decline of the kibbutz movement, HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed began to re-examine the ideal life path of its members, which had always begun with settling kibbutzim in \"gar'inim\" after finishing their mandatory period of army service. Instead, a model started to be put forward in which \"bogrim\" (\"graduates\") of the movement formed small urban communes working in society, particularly in education. In the early 21st century there are about 1,000 members of HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed's \"Tnuat Bogrim\" (\"Movement of Graduates\"). They live in small communes in cities or on kibbutzim. Many have jobs in education and the youth movement. Together, the youth movement and the \"Tnuat Bogrim\" are called the \"Dror-Israel\" movement, which is named after the historical \"Dror\" movement in Europe."}

Genetic testing identifies differences in chromosomes, genes, or proteins. It allows the genetic diagnosis of vulnerabilities to inherited diseases. It can also be used to find out a child's parentage (genetic mother and father)..\nGenetic screening in a broader sense includes biochemical tests for the possible presence of genetic diseases, or mutant forms of genes associated with increased risk of developing genetic disorders.\nMost of the time, testing is used to find changes that are associated with inherited disorders. The results of a genetic test can confirm or rule out a suspected genetic condition or help determine a person's chance of developing or passing on a genetic disorder. Several hundred genetic tests are currently in use, and more are being developed.\nSince genetic testing may open up ethical or psychological problems, genetic testing is often accompanied by genetic counselling."}

A normal eukaryote organism is composed of diploid cells, one set of chromosomes from each parent. However, after meiosis, the number of chromosomes in gametes is halved. That is the haploid condition.\nIn humans, the diploid number of chromosomes is 46 (2x23). The number in haploid cells (sperm and eggs) is 23. Some types of animals are haploid, such as male Hymenoptera (ants, bees and wasps). This is a special genetic system called haplodiploidy.\nSome plants and animals are polyploid, with more than two sets of chromosomes. For example, one species of wheat is hexaploid, with six sets of chromosomes, although other species of wheat have only two sets. Because so many organisms are diploid, it can become confusing whether haploid refers to one set of chromosomes or more than one. The special term monoploid can be used; it means one set of chromosomes."}

It was built for The London County Council to join two tramway systems called the \"North Side\" and \"South Side\". Used by single-deck tramcars only, but an upgrade between 1928 and 1931 meant that double deck trams could use it. The subway was closed in 1952. Part of the subway is now the Strand underpass, but the rest has not been changed very much and still has tram tracks inside it. It is now a Grade II Listed structure.\nPlanning.\nThe London County Council had two tramway systems called the \"North Side\" and \"South Side\". For a long time, they had considered joining the two together. This would allow them to send trams from the \"North Side\" to the Central Repair Depot in Charlton in South East London for overhauls. In 1898 it was decided to demolish the slum districts in the Holborn area and rebuild them. This gave a chance to use the new streets for a tramway. In 1902, the Council decided to build a tramway that was under the ground (subway). The subway went from Theobalds Road in the north to the Embankment underneath Waterloo Bridge to the south. From there a line that was not underground would continue over Waterloo Bridge.\nHowever, there were legal problems and these delayed the permission that was needed to build the subway and tram route. Permission to build the subway was not given until 1906, and they were still not allowed to build the tram line over the bridge. The tunnel would also only be able to have single-deck trams in it. This was because of a sewer at the northern end of the tunnel and the District Railway at the southern end. When the trams left the subway at the southern end, they could turn right along the Embankment to Westminster Bridge, or left on a service from Bloomsbury to the Hop Exchange. This latter service was short-lived and the tracks were removed in 1930.\nAt the north end, the approach near Southampton Row was a open cutting with a 1 in 10 (10%) slope. The tracks passed through cast iron tubes underneath the Fleet sewer. They then rose very slightly to enter Holborn tramway station. From here up to Aldwych tramway station the subway was built with a steel roof. Because it was not planned to run a public service south of here at first, the tracks leading towards the Strand were used as a depot with appropriate equipment and inspection pits.\nOpening.\nThe first public tram through the subway ran on 24 February 1906. It ran from The Angel, Islington to Aldwych. The chairman of the Highways Committee held an opening ceremony. The first journey took 10 minutes to go to Aldwych and 12 minutes to get back. This was also allowing for the horse-drawn vehicles that were using the roads on the overground part of the route. On the 16 November of the same year, the routes were extended north from The Angel to Highbury station. The route used special trams built from materials that could not catch fire. Wooden trams, like those used on other routes, were not allowed to go through the subway.\nIn the parliamentary session of 1905, plans were submitted for another station at the south end of the tunnel. The station would be underneath Wellington Street. The opening of the new tramway along the Embankment meant it was decided to link up with this route instead and the station was never built. A new sharp curve was built under Lancaster Place to allow an exit through the western side wall of Waterloo Bridge. A triangular junction with the through line was constructed. The eastern side of this junction, leading to Blackfriars, was removed as part of the 1930s upgrade.\nThrough services.\nThrough services started on 10 April 1908. They ran from Highbury station to Tower Bridge and to Kennington Gate. There was a procession of six cars that went south from the Holborn through to Kennington. They then diverted to Elephant and Castle in order to return through the subway to Angel. The Kennington service was not commercially viable and services were diverted to operate to Queens Road in Battersea. Due to a low bridge, this service could only be operated with single-deck vehicles. Drivers of the trams recorded difficulty in climbing the ramp north from Holborn tramway station and would sometimes roll all the way back to the station. Drivers on routes through the tunnel had to have at least two years experience on other services to be considered for these routes.\nThe services continued to change for many years, especially when the tram lines over Blackfriars Bridge opened on 14 September 1909. During the 1920s the LCC also realised that for the subway to remain profitable it would need to be able to take double-deck trams. In 1929, it was then decided that the headroom of the tunnel would be increased to . This would be done by raising the roof or deepening the tunnel as appropriate. Work started on 11 September 1929. The work resulted in the replacement of the cast iron tubes with a new steel girder-supported roof. The sewer was also diverted. In some places, the trackbed was lowered by . This meant that the walls had to be underpinned with concrete. After the last service ran on 2 February 1930 the tunnel was closed. It did not re-open until 14 February 1930 which was the formal re-opening. Tram number 1931 was used on the new route 31. Public services started on the next day. As well as the whole tunnel being rebuilt, the two tramway stations were as well. Services now ran from Hackney to Wandsworth or Tooting, Leyton to Westminster, Highbury to Waterloo or Norbury and Archway to Kennington.\nA weekend service was introduced between Highgate (Archway) and Downham via Brockley. This route closed in 1932. It was long. This made it the longest tram route operated entirely within the County of London.\nWaterloo Bridge re-building.\nIn 1937, Waterloo Bridge was re-built. This meant that the side entrance to the tramway had to be moved. A new entrance was built in a position centrally underneath the bridge. This opened on 21 November of that year.\nTram abandonment programme.\nIn 1933, the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) was formed. They took over the London County Council trams. Soon after this takeover, the LPTB decided to replace all of the trams in London with \"more modern vehicles\". The abandonment programme began in 1935. The trams in the South-West, West, North-West, North and East London were mostly replaced with trolleybuses. This programme carried on quickly until 1940. In 1940, the last tram conversion took place before the Second World War. This left only the South London trams and subway routes 31, 33 and 35 running. The subway routes were the only trams to run into North London during the war.\nPrototype Kingsway trolleybus number 1379 was built to test the use of trolleybuses through the subway. The trolleybus had exits on both sides to allow this. However, the tests were unsuccessful. This was because the trolleybuses would have had to run on battery power through the subway. They would have had to have used battery power because headroom restrictions made it impossible to use overhead current collection.\nIn 1946, it was decided to replace all of London's remaining trams \"as soon as possible\". This time though the replacement would be by diesel buses instead of trolleybuses. The first subway route to be closed was route 31. It closed on 1 October 1950. Routes 33 and 35 were closed at the end of service on Saturday 5 April 1952. The last public services through the subway were 'specials' which ran on the Sunday, shortly after midnight. During the early hours of the next morning, all of the remaining trams north of the subway were driven through the subway to the depots south of the Thames.\nClosure and a new use.\nThe trams in London stopped running on 5 July 1952. After this, the tracks on the street were lifted. However, those in the subway mostly remained in place. In 1953 London Transport used the tramway to store 120 unused buses and coaches. This was in case they were needed for the Coronation. However, proposals to convert the tramway subway to a car park or a movie studio failed and it was leased out as a storage facility from October 1957.\nIn June 1958, the London County Council proposed to use the tunnel for light traffic coming from Waterloo Bridge. This would reduce traffic congestion at its junction with Strand. In April 1962, the go-ahead was given for part of the southern end of the subway to be used in this way. Construction began in September of the same year. The subway opened to road traffic as the \"Strand Underpass\" on 21 January 1964.\nThe southern section of the abandoned tunnel between the Embankment and the Strand Underpass has been converted into a branch of the Buddha Bar chain of bars and restaurants. This involved the demolition of the pedestrian subways under Waterloo Bridge and extensive construction in the bridge's undercroft."}

The MacBook Air was the first laptop to implement Apple's precision aluminum unibody enclosure.\nThe MacBook Air has been updated over four times since the original release. The first revision introduced better performance, a bigger hard drive, and a Mini DisplayPort for peripheral monitors. The second update, introduced with the MacBook Pro series, featured a lower price, better performance, and a longer-lasting battery. It was revised a third time in October 2010 when the outside container was redesigned. At this time Apple began selling another model with a smaller, 11.6-inch (29\u00a0cm) screen until 2019. The fourth update was released in July 2011. There have been other revisions in between, but in October 2018, there was a fifth revision to the MacBook Air, with a fingerprint scanner, a larger Retina screen, and a backlit keyboard.\nDesign.\nThe MacBook Air, made for thinness, weighs , was the first MacBook produced using a single piece of aluminum with Apple's unibody technique. The computer has a glossy LED backlit screen and a backlit keyboard, as well as a large trackpad that responds to iPhone-like Multi-Touch gestures such as pinching, swiping, and rotating. With the release of Mac OS X Snow Leopard, the Air's multi-touch trackpad also supports handwriting recognition of Chinese characters.\nA hatch that flips down on the right side shows the ports on MacBook Air: a USB port, a Mini DisplayPort, and a stereo earphone jack. The left side of the computer has a MagSafe adapter for power, and there is an iSight webcam and microphone above the screen.\nThe MacBook Air was the first compact laptop sold by Apple since the full-featured 12\" PowerBook G4 was stopped in 2006. It was also Apple's first computer with an optional solid-state storage drive. ArsTechnica found \"moderate\" performance improvements of the 64 GB solid-state drive of the first generation Air over the standard 80\u00a0GB hard drive in tests. On October 14, 2008, new models were announced boasting improved capacities of 128\u00a0GB (solid-state) and 120\u00a0GB (hard drive). The Air comes standard with 2\u00a0GB non-upgradable RAM. The CPU on the original Air was an Intel Core 2 Duo chip especially designed to be 40 percent the size of the standard Core 2 Duo chip. The current model has a low voltage, small form factor Core 2 Duo \"Penryn\" with 6\u00a0MB of cache, running on a 1066\u00a0MHz bus. MacBook Air has no user-replaceable parts. The hard drive, memory, and battery are enclosed within the casing, with memory soldered directly to the logicboard. MacBook Air's battery is enclosed within the case but can be replaced using normal screwdrivers, though it is unclear whether this process would void the notebook's warranty. As part of the out-of-warranty service, Apple offers to replace the battery for a fee.\nApple incorporated several features in the design of the MacBook Air, such as the reduction of toxic chemicals like lead, to make it more environmentally friendly. MacBook Air contains no BFRs and PVC wiring, meets Energy Star Version 5.0 requirements, has a recyclable enclosure, and is rated EPEAT Gold; its screen is made from arsenic-free glass and does not contain mercury. To reduce the computer's size and weight, several features were sacrificed. It is Apple's first notebook since the PowerBook 2400c without a built-in removable media drive. It also omits a FireWire port, Ethernet port, line-in, media card slots, and a Kensington Security Slot.\nTo regain the features of an optical drive, users can either use a separately-available external USB SuperDrive, or the bundled Remote Disc software to access the optical drive of another computer. However, this method only allows for disk browsing or software installation; DVD movies or CDs cannot be watched or listened to. The Remote Disc capability is achieved by the computer wirelessly accessing the optical drive of another Mac or Windows PC that has the Remote Disc program installed. It can also be used to reinstall the system software from the included installation DVD. Remote Disc supports netbooting, so MacBook Air can boot from its installation DVD in another computer's drive. This feature requires Remote Install Mac OS X to be running on the remote computer. The software does not allow the playback or information of DVDs or CDs, nor does it allow the installation of Microsoft Windows. For these features, an external USB drive is required. A single speaker located under the keyboard is included for mono sound.\nThe MacBook Air includes Mac OS X Snow Leopard pre-installed, along with Apple's iLife multimedia suite. Apple's iWork work suite, similar to Microsoft Office, is also available with the purchase of the computer, with an extra charge.\nWith the 2008 changes to the notebook, wired Ethernet connectivity required a separately available USB-to-Ethernet adapter. However, for the 2009 revision, the adapter is included in-the-box. Additionally, in the 2008 revision, the hard drive, graphics, front side bus, processor, memory, battery, and port connections were upgraded.\nLaunch and reception.\nThe MacBook Air was greeted with mixed reception when it was introduced. The portability of the MacBook Air was praised in reviews, however, the compromise in features was criticized. The full-sized keyboard, weight of three pounds, thinness, and Multi-Touch trackpad were appreciated in reviews, while the limited configuration options, slow speed (in the non-SSD models), non-user replaceable battery, small hard drive, and price were criticized.\nDan Ackerman of CNET commented on the original models, \"the design and engineering that went into MacBook Air is extraordinary, but it's certainly a much more specialized product than the standard 13-inch MacBook.\" Ackerman disliked the limited internet connectivity, slow speed, small hard drive, battery, and the price of SSD hard-drive option, however, appreciated the thinness, sturdiness, and the MultiTouch gestures. Macworld's Jason Snell praised the portability, however commented that \"the decision about whether the MacBook Air is a product worth having can be answered by 1 question: How much are you willing to compromise?\"\nMacBook Air's launch was accompanied by a television commercial emphasizing its slender design. In the commercial, a hand unthreads a manila envelope and slides out a MacBook Air, then opens it to wake it from sleep. The music playing is \"New Soul\" by Yael Na\u00efm.\n\"Thinnest\" disputes.\nThe Mitsubishi Pedion, released in 1998, was the thinnest \"rectangular\" laptop at 0.72\u00a0inches (1.84\u00a0cm) until the release of the Dell Adamo in March 2009, which is a rectangular laptop 0.65\u00a0inches (1.65\u00a0cm) thick. Although both these laptops are thinner than MacBook Air's thickest point (0.76\u00a0inches/1.94\u00a0cm), MacBook Air \"tapers\" from 0.16\u20130.76\u00a0inches (0.4\u20131.94\u00a0cm), leading to some controversy over the \"thinnest\" laptop.\nThe Sharp Actius MM10 Muramasas, a thin, tapered notebook, had a minimum height (thickness) of and a maximum height of . It was the thinnest tapered laptop until the release of MacBook Air in 2008. In March 2009, Dell challenged that claim with the release of the Dell Adamo XPS.\nIssues.\nThe flip-down hatch on the side of Mac Book Air is a tight fit for some headphone plugs and USB devices, requiring users to purchase an extension cable. Apple has removed the flip-down hatch on the Late 2010 model in favor of open connection ports as on other Mac books. Since the release of the first-generation product, some MacBook Air users have complained of overheating that caused CPU lockup. The effect can be seen at CPU temperatures as low as and worsens with higher temperatures. Apple released a software update in early March 2008 to fix the problem with mixed results: the deactivation of 1 CPU core appears to have been corrected; however, the runaway kernel problem remains for at least some users. The problem is aggravated by system-intensive tasks such as video playback or video chatting."}

It governed itself (it had autonomy), but was under the overall suzerainty of the British monarch. Amb was ruled by a hereditary prince with the title of Nawab. The Nawab of Amb was the chieftain of the Tanoli tribe of Pashtun from Ghilji confederation in the Hazara. In the Partition of India in 1947, the Nawab of Tanolis/TanoKhel gave up the independence the state had previously enjoyed by joining the new country of Pakistan. Amb continued as a distinct state within Pakistan until 1969, when it was merged into the former North-West Frontier Province. The royal status of the Nawab was abolished by the Government of Pakistan in 1972.\nThe area in which Amb was located is historically known as Tanawal. This is in the Hazara region in what is now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The part covered by Amb is called \"Upper Tanawal\", and is now part of Mansehra District. \"Lower Tanawal\" is in the Abbottabad District. The name \"Tanawal\" comes from the name of the tribe that lives there, the Tanoli (or Tanawali). The Tanoli are Muslims. They speak Hindko.\nHistory.\nAmb and the area around it have a long history, which goes back to the time of the invasion of the region by Alexander the Great. A settlement called Embolina, located on the Indus River, is mentioned in writings by Arrian and Ptolemy. This is the place from which the Nawabs of Amb took their title.\nAmb was once formally known as Mulk e Tanawal (meaning the country of Tanawal). The early history of the region goes back to the centuries before the Mughal Empire. In the early 14th century, the Tanoli or Tanawali tribe arrived here from Central Asia, after coming through Afghanistan. They conquered it and settled here on the banks of the river Indus and a wide area around it, which thus came to be known as Tanawal.\nFrom early on, the Tanawal area stayed mostly free from the influence of the Mughals and Sikhs and later had only limited contact with British. The people of Tanawal thus had little or no contact with other places for a long period and remained ignorant and backward. At most times, they would resist outside authority, preferring to be ruled by their own chiefs at a local level. Until the late-18th or early-19th centuries, Tanawal was not one state. It was rather an area where several important Tanoli chiefs had authority over an area of influence. The Hindwal section chiefs remained stronger than the other. In 1772, Mir Haibat Khan, the eldest son of Mir Gul Muhammad Khan, was declared to be the chief of Upper Tanawal. Later, his descendants were made as the Nawabs of Amb under the British Raj, and continued ruling over this territory until 1972.\nRulers.\nThe rulers of Amb belonged to the Hindwal branch of the Tanoli. The Tanoli are of Mughal ancestry. The rulers are descendants of a Barlas Turk probably named Ameer Khan Turk but authentic records of the tribe no longer exist beyond the 18th century.\nList.\nThe Nawabs, or rulers of Amb were:\nThe concept of hereditary rulerships was abolished in Pakistan on 1 January 1972. It was done by a change to the constitution. This meant that the Nawab of Amb would no longer be recognised as a ruler. They could also no longer use their old styles and titles.\nThe current head of the old/former royal family is Salahuddin Saeed Khan, since 1973. He is the son of the last Nawab and is allowed to use the courtesy title of 'Nawabzada' (son of a Nawab)."}

It is the capital city of the Nord \"D\u00e9partement\".\nThe city is on the coast of the \"Cap-Ha\u00eftien\" Bay, on the Atlantic Ocean, about 260\u00a0km north of the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince. The central part of the city is between the bay to the east, and mountains to the west.\nCap-Ha\u00eftien is also the chief town of an \"arrondissement\" (a part of a department) with the same name. The \"arrondissement\" has three \"communes\" (a \"commune\" is like a municipality): Cap-Ha\u00eftien, Limonade and Quartier-Morin.\nHistory.\nOn the left side of the river Haut du Cap, Christopher Columbus built a small fort with the rest of the ship \"Santa Mar\u00eda\" when it was destroyed on Christmas Day on 1492; he named the fort as \"La Navidad\" (in English, \"Christmas\").\nThe region around the city had the Ta\u00edno name of \"Guarico\", the name used by the Spanish colonists for the region and the new city. When French people came from the Tortuga Island to live here, they founded the city in 1670 and the French King Louis XIV named the place as \"Cap-Fran\u00e7ais\" in 1711; it was then the capital city of the \"Saint-Domingue\" colony until 1770 when Port-au-Prince became the new capital city.\nThe town was destroyed by Spanish people in January 1691, after the Battle of La Limonade; La Limonade is a savanna just to the east of Cap-Ha\u00eftien. Later, in 1695, the town was again destroyed by Spanish and English soldiers.\nHaiti, known as \"Saint-Domingue\" during colonial times, was the richest colony of France, and Cap-Fran\u00e7ais was the richest city in the colony. The city was known then as the \"Paris of the west\".\nDuring the Haitian Revolution, there was a battle on 18 November 1803 in Verti\u00e8res, near Cap-Ha\u00eftien. In this battle, the army of Jean-Jacques Dessalines defeated a French colonial army led by the Comte de Rochambeau, leading to the independence of Haiti on 1 January 1804.\nAfter the Haitian independence, the country was divided in two parts and the northern part was made a kingdom by Henri Christophe and the name of the city was changed to \"Cap-Henry\". Christophe made Milot, a town 15\u00a0km to the south of the city, the capital of his kingdom.\nThe city was named \"Cap-Ha\u00eftien\" after the death of Christophe and when Haiti became again one country.\nEconomy.\nCap-Ha\u00eftien is a very important port of northern Haiti; there is also an airport."}

They are also found on the island of Tasmania. There are four species of long-nosed bandicoots, but \"Perameles nasuta\" is found in forests and rainforests. It has the shortest gestation and highest reproduction rate of all mammals.\nThey live in small hidden nests, in among shrubs, hollow logs, or old rabbit burrows. Bandicoots are protected by law, but the areas they like to live in have been cleared for farming or housing. They are also hunted by dogs, cats and foxes. Rabbits have eaten many of the plants and made it unsuitable for bandicoots. Around Sydney, they listed as an endangered species.\nDescription.\nThe long-nosed bandicoot is a small animal, from 20\u201442.5 cm long with a thin rat like tail, from 7.5\u201417 cm in length. They weigh between 0.5\u20141.9kg. They are covered in coarse grey to brown fur, sometimes with a hint of yellow or orange. Their underbelly is a cream color. Being a marsupial the females have a rear opening pouch to carry their young. They have five clawed toes fingers on their front legs.\nBreeding.\nThe long-nosed bandicoot lives by itself, often chasing away other bandicoots. Their breeding season depends on the region in which they live. The female gives birth to two or three young after a short gestation period of 12 days. The tiny babies, blind and hairless, about 13mm in length, then move to the pouch where they are able to drink milk from the females eight nipples. They leave the pouch at about 54 days. The female is then ready to breed again. they live for between three and five years.\nDiet.\nThe long-nosed bandicoot is a nocturnal animal, coming out at night to find and eat insects, beetles, snails, worms, mice, lizards and tree roots. They are able to smell their food to find it. They use their front claws to dig a hole big enough to get their long nose in to find the food. They can be very unpopular in urban areas for digging up gardens. While looking for food they make a shrill high pitched squeak."}

It is close to the Strathbogie Ranges. In 2006 there were 2,776 people living in the town. The name \"Euroa\" comes from an Aboriginal word meaning \"joyful\". \nHistory.\nMajor Mitchell camped on the banks of the Seven Creeks at Euroa during his 1836 expedition from Sydney.\nThe Post Office opened on 1 January 1854 as the township was settled. Euroa became famous when the bank was robbed by Ned Kelly on December 10, 1878. The Kelly Gang got away with about \u00a32000. There are a number of historic buildings still standing in Euroa. These include the Farmers Arms Hotel which was built in 1876, and is now used as a museum. Other buildings are the post office (1890), the old National Bank buildings (1885), the Euroa Hotel (1884) and Blairgowrie House (1890). The first church built in Euroa was the Catholic Church (1867).\nThe Euroa court house was built in 1892 at a cost of \u00a31354. It was designed by architect J.T.Kelleher, but many now believe it was the work of A.J.McDonald. The court house was closed in 1989.\nSheep farming was a major business, with fine wool Saxon merino sheep being introduced in 1851. Farmers are now making more money from horses.\nFacilities.\nEuroa is roughly midway between Melbourne and Albury. The area is very flat, although the Strathbogie Ranges about 20\u00a0km south east of the town. \nEuroa has several retirement villages, one high school, and two primary schools. The Shire of Strabogie is based in Euroa.\nThe main road from Melbourne northward is the Hume Highway. A by-pass was built around the town and since then Euroa has been a quiet town with little growth or business. \nThe town is located on the main North East railway, and is served by V/Line passenger services.\nSport.\nThe town has an Australian Rules Football team, the \"Euroa Magpies\", competing in the Goulburn Valley Football League. \nGolfers play at the course of the Euroa Golf Club on Walters Road.\nFamous people.\nThree winners of the Victoria Cross for Australia came from the Euroa area:"}

Hertha Berlin was one of the founding clubs of the DFB (Deutscher Fu\u00dfball Bund or German Football Association) in Leipzig in 1900.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\n\"BFC Hertha 92\" (Berlin Foortbal Club Hertha 92) was formed in 1892. Its name and team colours were taken from a steamship with a blue and white funnel. One of the men who founded the club had taken a day trip on this ship with his father. Hertha is a variation on the name Nerthus, a Germanic fertility goddess.\nHertha always played well, but were not financially successful. They won the first Berlin championship final in 1905. Because of money troubles in 1920 Hertha merged with the richer \"Berliner Sport-Club\" to form \"Hertha Berliner Sport Club\". The new team was still successful, but never the best. Hertha BSC was in the German championship final every year from 1926 to 1930, but were only able to win in 1930. Hertha and BSC split in 1930, and Hertha won the championship again in 1931.\n\"Hertha\" was Germany's second most successful team during the inter-war years.\nPlay under the Third Reich.\nGerman football was re-organized under the Third Reich in 1933 into sixteen top-flight divisions, which saw \"Hertha\" playing in the Gauliga Berlin-Brandenburg. The club continued to be successful in their division, regularly finishing in the upper half of the table and capturing the divisional title in 1935, 1937, and 1944. However, they did not do well nationally, and never got past the early rounds of the national championshipships.\nPostwar play in divided Berlin.\nAfter World War II, occupying Allied authorities banned most organisations in Germany, including sports and football clubs. \"Hertha\" restarted at the end of 1945 as \"SG Gesundbrunnen\" (named after a district of northern Berlin) and resumed play in the Oberliga Berlin - Gruppe C. The thirty-six teams of the first season of the postwar Oberliga Berlin were reduced to just 12 the next year and the club found itself out of first division football and playing in the Amateurliga Berlin. By the end of 1949, they had become \"Hertha BSC Berlin\" again.\nIn the 1949/50 season the Soviets would not allow \"Hertha\" to play against East German teams, because they had signed some players and a coach who had left the Dresden club \"SG Friedrichstadt\" for West Berlin. A number of sides from the eastern half of the city were forced from the Oberliga Berlin to the newly established DDR-Liga beginning with the 1950-51 season.\nThroughout the 1950's there was a rivalry with \"Tennis Borussia Berlin\", but the idea of the two merger between the two clubs in 1958 was rejected.\nBundesliga.\nHertha was a founder of the Bundesliga in 1963 and was Berlin's reigning champion. But Hertha was demoted after the 1964-65 season because the club had tried to bribe players to play in the city after the Berlin Wall had been built, and players did not want to move to the city. To keep a Berlin team in the Bundesliga, \"Tasmania 1900 Berlin\", were promoted instead. Tasmania were the worst side ever in the Bundesliga history. \"Hertha\" returned to the Bundesliga in 1968-69 and became Berlin's favourite side.\n\"Hertha\" had to sell the team's former home ground in 1974 when investigations about the match fixing scandal of 1971 showed that the club was 6 million DM (\u20ac3 million) in debt.\nThe team continued to enjoy a fair measure of success during the 70s but gradually slipped down into the third tier Amateur Oberliga Berlin where they spent two seasons (1986-87 and 1987-88).\nAfter two turns in the Bundesliga (1982-83 and 1990-91) Hertha was immediately relegated after poor performances. \"Hertha\"'s amateur side was more successful, getting to the final of the German Cup in 1993 where they lost 0:1 to Bundesliga side \"Bayer Leverkusen\".\nBy 1994 Hertha BSC was 10 million DM (\u20ac5 million) in debt. More land had to be sold and a new sponsor and management team were found. By 1997 \"Hertha\" got back into the Bundesliga. The y were the first Berlin club in 10 years to be in the top division. Since then they have generally finished in the top third of the Bundesliga.\nMost recently, bright spots for the side have been a continuous string of appearances in international play in the UEFA Cup and the UEFA Champions League beginning in the 1999 season, and the signing of players such as Sebastian Deisler and Brazilian international Marcelinho, named the Bundesliga's player of the year in May of 2005. Hertha has also invested heavily in its own youth football academy, which has produced several players with Bundesliga potential.\nThe team was close to relegation in the 2003-04 season, but managed to finished 4th the following season. Hertha only missed out on the Champions League after they were held to a draw on the final day by Hannover 96, which saw Werder Bremen over take them for the spot on the final day. As a thank-you gesture, Werder sent the Hannover squad ninety-six bottles of champagne. In 2005-06 the \"Herthaner\" finished 6th, and qualified for the UEFA Cup by defeating FK Moskva in the Intertoto Cup.\nStadia.\n\"Hertha BSC\" plays its matches in Berlin's Olympiastadion. It is biggest stadium in Germany except for \"Borussia Dortmund\"'s Westfalenstadion.\nThe Olympiastadion hosts the annual German Cup final and was the site for six matches of the 2006 FIFA World Cup as well as the tournament final.\nFrom 1904 to 1963, \"Hertha\"'s home ground was the Plumpe in Wedding's Gesundbrunnen district. A new stadium was built there in 1923. \"BSC\" left that site when it joined the Bundesliga in 1963. It was the sale of the Plumpe site in 1974 helped the club avoid bankruptcy\nPlayers.\nSquad Changes 2009/10.\nIn:\nOut:"}

It is named after Beno\u00eet Mandelbrot, a Polish-French-American mathematician. The Mandelbrot set is important for chaos theory. The edging of the set shows a self-similarity, which is not perfect because it has deformations. \nThe Mandelbrot set can be explained with the equation \"z\"\"n\"+1 = \"z\"\"n\"2 + \"c\". In that equation, \"c\" and \"z\" are complex numbers and \"n\" is zero or a positive integer (natural number). Starting with \"z\"0=0, c is in the Mandelbrot set if the absolute value of \"z\"\"n\" never becomes larger than a certain number (that number depends on c), no matter how large \"n\" gets. \nMandelbrot was one of the first to use computer graphics to create and display fractal geometric images, leading to his discovering the Mandelbrot set in 1979. That was because he had access to IBM's computers. He was able to show how visual complexity can be created from simple rules. He said that things typically considered to be \"rough\", a \"mess\" or \"chaotic\", like clouds or shorelines, actually had a \"degree of order\". The equation \"z\"\"n\"+1 = \"z\"\"n\"2 + \"c\" was known long before Benoit Mandelbrot used a computer to visualize it.\nImages are created by applying the equation to each pixel in an iterative process, using the pixel's position in the image for the number 'c'. 'c' is obtained by mapping the position of the pixel in the image relative to the position of the point on the complex plane.\nThe shape of the Mandelbrot Set is represented in black in the image on this page.\nFor example, if \"c\" = 1 then the sequence is 0, 1, 2, 5, 26,\u2026, which goes to infinity. Therefore, 1 is not an element of the Mandelbrot set, and thus is not coloured black.\nOn the other hand, if \"c\" is equal to the square root of -1, also known as i, then the sequence is 0, i, (\u22121 + i), \u2212i, (\u22121 + i), \u2212i\u2026, which does not go to infinity and so it belongs to the Mandelbrot set.\nWhen graphed to show the entire Set, the resultant image is striking, pretty, and quite recognizable.\nThere are many variations of the Mandelbrot set, such as Multibrot, Buddhabrot, and Nebulabrot.\nMultibrot is a generalization that allows any exponent: \"z\"\"n\"+1 = \"z\"\"n\"\"d\" + \"c\". These sets are called Multibrot sets. The Multibrot set for \"d\" = 2 is the Mandelbrot set."}

Even after the series ended in 1957, it continued for three more seasons with 13 one-hour specials. This show ran from 1957 to 1960. It was known first as \"The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show\" and later in reruns as \"The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour\".\nThe series is about two married couples living in New York City: Ricky and Lucy Ricardo, and oldsters Fred and Ethel Mertz. They all live in the same apartment building. Ricky is a nightclub band leader. Lucy is a housewife. Many episodes revolve around Lucy's attempts to get into Ricky's show. She often pulls Fred and Ethel into her schemes. In one episode, Lucy and Ethel are assembly line workers in a candy factory. They cannot keep up with packaging the candy so they eat it. In another episode, Lucy gets drunk on a health tonic while shooting a television commercial. Four or five episodes follow the couples on trips to Italy and to Hollywood. Ball and Arnaz were real-life husband and wife. They became the parents of a boy during the run of the series. This event was woven into the series. A child actor played their son \"Little Ricky\". Eventually they would all move to a rural area in Connecticut.\n\"I Love Lucy\" was the most watched series in the United States in four of its six seasons. It was the first to end its run at the top of the Nielsen ratings. \"I Love Lucy\" is still syndicated in dozens of languages around the world. The series was the first scripted television program to be shot on 35 mm film in front of a studio audience. The show won five Emmy Awards, and received numerous nominations. In 2002, it ranked second on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time. In 2007, it was listed as one of \"Time\" magazine's \"100 Best TV Shows of All-\"TIME\".\" \"I Love Lucy\" remains very popular today. It is still seen by 40 million Americans each year."}

These feelings are much stronger and more intense than what a human would normally feel. However, some natural human behaviors can cause brief states of euphoria. For example, people may feel euphoric for a short time after orgasm, when in love, or after a very important athletic achievement. Sometimes, people can also feel euphoria during certain religious or spiritual rituals, or while meditating. More often, euphoria is caused by certain psychoactive drugs, mental illnesses, or medical problems. Euphoria is the opposite of dysphoria.\nCauses.\nDrugs.\nEuphoria can be caused by psychoactive drugs like cocaine and alcohol methamphetamines.\nSome of the drugs that can cause euphoria are:\nMental Illness.\nEuphoria can be a symptom of some mental illnesses. For example, euphoria is a common symptom of mania, an extreme, high-energy mood state which can happen with bipolar disorder and other mental health conditions.\nMedical Illness.\nEuphoria can also be a symptom of some medical problems. It is a common symptom of hypoxia. It is a dangerous symptom, because it can make a hypoxic person feel so good and carefree that they do not realise that they are not getting enough oxygen.\nEuphoria can be a symptom of hyperthyroidism. It can also be caused by head injuries or conditions which affect the central nervous system, like syphilis and multiple sclerosis.\nExercise.\nSometimes, people feel euphoria when exercising. A well-known example is \"runner's high,\" a state of euphoria and high energy that runners sometimes experience, especially during intense workouts. According to recent studies, intense exercise can cause the brain to release endorphins. These endorphins attach to the same brain receptors as opioid drugs, so they can cause the same euphoric effects as those drugs do. Unfortunately, this means that a person could get chemically addicted to consistent exercise, just as he or she might get addicted to opiates."}

Mendel's second law is thus broken. \nGenes are linked when they are on the same chromosome. They then tend to stay together during meiosis. Alleles for genes on different chromosomes are usually not linked, due to independent assortment of chromosomes during meiosis. \nThere is some crossing over of DNA during meiosis when the chromosomes segregate. So, alleles on the same chromosome can be separated and go to different daughter cells. There is a greater probability of this happening if the alleles are far apart on the chromosome, as it is more likely that a cross-over will occur between them. The relative distance between two genes can be calculated using the offspring of an organism showing two linked genetic traits. The percentage of offspring where the two traits do not run together is noted. The higher the percentage of offspring showing both traits, the closer on the chromosome the two genes are. \nThis was the first technique used for mapping genes on chromosomes. By working out the number of recombinants it is possible to obtain a measure for the distance between the genes. This distance is called a \"genetic map unit\" (m.u.), or a \"centimorgan\" and is defined as the distance between genes for which one product of meiosis in 100 is recombinant. A recombinant frequency (RF) of 1 % is equivalent to 1 m.u. A linkage map is created by finding the map distances between a number of traits that are present on the same chromosome, ideally avoiding significant gaps between traits to avoid the possibility of multiple crossovers."}

He was professor at Innsbruck, Austria from 1889\u201395, then accepted a professorial chair at the Anatomical Institute of the University of Halle, a post he retained until 1921.\nEmbryology.\nRoux's research was based upon the notion of \"Entwicklungsmechanik\" or developmental mechanics. His methodology was to interfere with developing embryos and observe the outcome. Roux's investigations were performed mainly on frogs' eggs to research the earliest structures in amphibian development. His goal was to show Darwinian processes at work on the cellular level.\nIn 1888, Roux published the results of a series of defect experiments in which he took 2 and 4 cell frog embryos and killed half of the cells of each embryo with a hot needle. He reported that they grew into half-embryos and surmised that the separate function of the two cells had already been determined. This led him to propose his \"mosaic\" theory: after a few cell divisions the embryo would be like a mosaic, each cell playing its own unique part in the entire design. \nAfter a few years Roux's theory was refuted by the studies of his colleague Hans Driesch and later, with more precision, Hans Spemann showed that, as a rule, Driesch's conclusions were correct, but that results like Roux's may be obtained after intervention in certain planes. Despite this early lapse Roux's pioneering mechanical methodology was to prove most fruitful in 20th century biology.\nCell biology.\nIn a remarkable paper, Roux realised the significance of the linear structure of chromosomes. Their splitting into two equal longitudinal halves assured each daughter cell got the same chromosome complement. Therefore, chromosomes were the bearers of heredity. This was a significant event in cytogenetics."}

They are commonly known as nymphalids, brushfoots, or brush-footed butterflies.\nCharacteristics.\nBrushfoots get their name from their front pair of legs. This pair of legs is reduced. They do not have claws at the end. Only the middle and last pair of legs are used for walking. This is why they are called brush-footed butterflies or four-footed butterflies.\nMany species are brightly colored and include popular species such as the emperors, admirals, tortoiseshells, and fritillaries. Most hold their colourful wings flat when they are at rest. However, the underwings are often dull; in some species they look just like dead leaves, or are much paler. So when they raise their wings in the normal butterfly position, this cryptic effect helps the butterfly disappear into its surroundings."}

The Dutch Reformed Church held the meeting in order to discuss a very important issue in the Dutch churches that begin with the teachings of Jacobus Arminius and the rise of Arminianism. The first meeting was on November 13, 1618, and the last meeting, which was the 154th, took place on May 9, 1619. \nMembers from the Reformed churches in eight different countries were also invited to this meeting. The name \"Dort\" is the English name for the Dutch town of \"Dordrecht\" and is still used as the pronunciation of the name today. This synod, or meeting, is usually called the Synod of Dordt or the Synod of Dordrecht.\nPurpose.\nThe reason that this meeting was called was to settle an issue that had just been brought up in the Dutch churches after the spread of Arminianism. After Jacob Arminius died, people that believed the same way that he did objected to the Belgic Confession and the teachings of John Calvin and Theodore Beza. Arminius's followers published their problems with the Confession in a paper called The Remonstrance of 1610. The followers of the things listed in this document were called Remonstrants. Calvinists, who followed the teachings of John Calvin, became known as \"Contra-Remonstrants\".\nIn \"The Remonstrance\" and some later writing, the Arminians wrote about an alternative to the Calvinist Belgic Confession and mentioned several things that they disagreed with. They taught election on the basis of God knowing who would have faith, a universal atonement, resistible grace and the possibility of walking away from grace. Simon Episopius was the speaker for the 13 members of the Remonstrants who were called to the Synod in 1618.\nThe end of the meetings and the Canon of Dort.\nThe meetings concluded with the views of the Remonstrants being rejected and set out the Reformed doctrine on each of the points. These are sometimes called the Five points of Calvinism and are remembered by the five letters \"TULIP\".\n\"The Decision of the Synod of Dort on the Five Main Points of Doctrine in Dispute in the Netherlands\", known as the Canons of Dort, is the reasoning behind the decisions made by the Synod. \nThe \"Canons\" are not supposed to be an absolute explanation of the Reformed doctrine, but only explain the five points of doctrine that were being argued over."}

He wrote many books and papers on theology, which is the study of God, and his views became the basis for the Dutch Remonstrants.\nAfter he died, his views on theology were most widely known for being the opposite of the five points of Calvinism, though Arminius only objected to three: unconditional election, limited atonement, and irresistible grace; and he doubted the perseverance of the saints. His view on total depravity agreed with John Calvin, only changing the view held by Calvinists a small amount.\nLife.\nArminius was born at Oudewater, Utrecht. His father Herman died when Arminius was a baby, leaving his wife (and Jacob's mother) as a single mother with small children.\nTheodorus Aemilius, a priest, adopted Jacobus and sent him to school at Utrecht. His mother was killed by the Spanish in Oudewater in 1575. About that same year the kindness of his friends allowed him to go study theology at the University of Leiden."}

His father died when Turgenev was sixteen. He and his brother Nicholas were brought up by their mother. She did not treat them well.\nTurgenev went to the University of Moscow for one year and then moved to the University of Saint Petersburg, where he studied Classics and Russian Literature. In 1838 he went to the University of Berlin to study philosophy and history. Turgenev liked Germany and thought Russia should change their social system to be more like Germany\u2019s.\nThe 1840s and 1850s were hard times for writers and artists in Russia. The political system did not allow them to express themselves as they wanted to. Many intelligent Russians left the country and went to England, France and Germany. In 1852 Turgenev himself was put in prison for a month for praising Nikolai Gogol \u2013 a famous Russian writer who had been criticised by the ruling powers in the country. In 1854, Turgenev moved to Western Europe and started writing his novel \"Rudin\", which complained about the Russia of the 1840s and 1850s. \nThe political system in Russia changed in 1855 when Alexander II took over power from his father Nicholas I. Writers and artists had more freedom from this time. In 1860 one of Turgenev\u2019s most famous novels, \"First Love\", was published.\nIn 1862, \"Fathers and Sons\", Turgenev\u2019s most famous novel, appeared. Many people did not like the novel which upset Turgenev and he began to write less.\n\"Smoke\" was published in 1867, but again was not popular in Russia. \nIn 1879, he received an honorary degree from the University of Oxford in England.\nIn later life, Turgenev did not live in Russia much. He lived either at Baden-Baden or Paris, often near the singer Pauline Viardot, who he was having an affair with. He never married, but he did have a daughter with one of his family\u2019s servants.\nTurgenev died near Paris on 3 September 1883. On his deathbed he told Leo Tolstoy to start writing again.\nTurgenev had an awkward relationship with two other famous Russian writers \u2013 Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoevsky. Tolstoy and Dostoevsky criticised Turgenev for liking Western Europe and its literature more than Russian literature. Turgenev was also close to the French writer Gustave Flaubert."}

Ernst Mayr thought he was \"one of the great biologists of all time\", and ranked him \"the second most notable evolutionary theorist of the 19th century\", after Charles Darwin.\nWeismann's barrier.\nWeismann advocated the \"germ plasm\" theory. According to this, inheritance only takes place by means of the germ cells the gametes, such as egg cells and sperm cells. Other cells of the body (somatic cells or \"soma\") are not agents of heredity. The effect is one-way: germ cells produce somatic cells, and more germ cells. The germ cells are not affected by anything the somatic cells learn or any ability the body acquires during its life. Genetic information cannot pass from soma to germ plasm and on to the next generation. This is referred to as the \"Weismann barrier\". This idea, if true, rules out the inheritance of acquired characteristics as proposed by Lamarck.\nThe idea of the Weismann barrier is central to the modern evolutionary synthesis, though it is not expressed today in the same terms. In Weismann's opinion the random process of mutation in the gametes (or stem cells which make them) is the only source of change for natural selection to work on. Weismann was one of the first biologists to deny the inheritance of acquired characters entirely. Weismann's ideas came before the rediscovery of Gregor Mendel's work. Though Weismann was cagey about accepting Mendelism, younger workers soon made the connection. \nGerman work on cells.\nWeismann's demarkation between germ-line and soma rested on the work of (mostly) German biologists during the second half of the 19th century. This was the time that the mechanisms of cell division began to be understood. Eduard Strasburger, Walther Flemming, and the Belgian Edouard Van Beneden laid the basis for the cytology and cytogenetics of the 20th century. Strasburger, the outstanding botanical physiologist of that century, coined the terms nucleus and cytoplasm. He said \"new cell nuclei can only arise from the division of other cell nuclei\". Van Beneden discovered how chromosomes combined at meiosis, during the production of gametes. Walther Flemming, the founder of cytogenetics, named mitosis, and pronounced \"omne nucleus e nuclei\" (which means the same as Strasburger's dictum). The discovery of mitosis, meiosis and chromosomes is regarded as one of the 100 most important scientific discoveries of all times, and one of the 10 most important discoveries in cell biology.\nMeiosis was discovered and described for the first time in sea urchin eggs in 1876, by Oscar Hertwig. It was described again in 1883, at the level of chromosomes, by Van Beneden in \"Ascaris\" eggs. The \"significance of meiosis for reproduction and inheritance\", however, was first described in 1890 by Weismann, who noted that two cell divisions were necessary to transform one diploid cell into four haploid cells if the number of chromosomes had to be maintained.

He wrote one of the most famous textbooks in the history of modern biology, \"The Cell\".\nCareer.\nWilson graduated from Yale in 1878. He earned his doctorate at Johns Hopkins in 1881. He was a lecturer at Williams College in 1883\u201384 and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1884\u201385. He served as professor of biology at Bryn Mawr College from 1885 to 1891. \nHe spent the balance of his career at Columbia University where he was successively adjunct professor of biology (1891\u201394), professor of invertebrate zoology (1894\u20131897), and professor of zoology (from 1897). \nWilson is credited as America's first cell biologist. In 1898 he used the similarity in embryos to describe evolutionary relationships. By observing spiral cleavage in molluscs, flatworms and annelids he concluded that the same organs came from the same group of cells and concluded that all these organisms must have a common ancestor. \nHe also discovered the chromosomal XY sex-determination system in 1905\u2014that males have XY and females XX sex chromosomes. Nettie Stevens independently made the same discovery the same year.\nIn 1907, he described, for the first time, the additional or supernumerary chromosomes, now called B-chromosomes.\nProfessor Wilson published many papers on embryology, and served as President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1913. \nThe American Society for Cell Biology annually awards the E.B.

He became Professor of Biology and then Professor of Genetics at the University of Cambridge.\nHe co-founded, with William Bateson, the \"Journal of Genetics\" in 1910. Punnett is probably best remembered today as the creator of the Punnett square, a tool still used by biologists to predict the probability of possible genotypes of offspring. His \"Mendelism\" (1905) is sometimes said to have been the first textbook on genetics; it was probably the first popular science book to introduce genetics to the public.\nLife and work.\nReginald Punnett was born in 1875 in the town of Tonbridge in Kent, England. While recovering from a childhood bout of appendicitis, Punnett became acquainted with Jardine's Naturalist's Library and developed an interest in natural history. \nAttending the University of Cambridge, Punnett earned a degree in zoology in 1898, and a masters in 1902. Between these degrees he worked as a demonstrator and part-time lecturer at the University of St Andrews Natural History Department. However, by 1902 Punnett was back at Cambridge working in zoology, primarily the study of nematode worms. It was during this time that he and William Bateson began a research collaboration, which lasted several years.\nWhen Punnett was an undergraduate, Gregor Mendel's work on inheritance was largely unknown and unappreciated by scientists. However, in 1900, Mendel's work was rediscovered. William Bateson became a proponent of Mendelian genetics, and had Mendel's work translated into English. It was with Bateson that Reginald Punnett helped establish the new science of genetics at Cambridge. He and Bateson co-discovered genetic linkage through experiments with chickens and pea plants.\nIn 1908, unable to explain how a dominant gene would not become fixed and ubiquitous in a population, Punnett introduced his problem to the mathematician G. H. Hardy, with whom he played cricket. Hardy went on to formulate what became known as the Hardy\u2013Weinberg law.\nIn 1910 Punnett became professor of biology at Cambridge, and then the first Arthur Balfour Professor of Genetics when Bateson left in 1912. In the same year, Punnett was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He received the society's Darwin Medal in 1922.\nDuring World War I, Punnett successfully applied his expertise to the problem of the early determination of gender in chickens. Since only females were used for egg-production, early identification of male chicks, which were destroyed or separated for fattening, meant that limited animal-feed and other resources could be used more efficiently. Punnett's work in this area was summarized in \"Heredity in Poultry\" (1923).\nPunnett squares.\nPunnett squares are used by biologists to determine the probability of offspring having a particular genotype.\nIf B represents the allele for having black hair and b represents the allele for having white hair, the offspring of two Bb parents would have a 25% probability of having two white hair alleles (bb), 50% of having one of each (Bb), and 25% of having only black hair alleles (BB). The phenotype (in this case the appearance) of the offspring would depend on whether and to what extent one of the alleles was dominant."}

Under Franco Foda this way was successful, and now Sturm is one of the top four teams in the league. In 2010 they reached the third title and played in the qualification for the Champions League but lost in the play off round against BATE Borisov. "}

Born in Hamburg, Germany, he studied zoology at the University of Berlin, receiving his PhD in 1923 at the age of 21. He was selected for a fellowship to study at Columbia University, then the site of Thomas Hunt Morgan's famous drosophila fly room.\nEarly career.\nStern accepted an appointment at the University of Berlin after his fellowship ended. In 1931, he was the first to demonstrate crossover of homologous chromosomes in \"Drosophila melanogaster\", only weeks after Barbara McClintock and Harriet Creighton had done so with maize.\nStern eventually returned to the United States in 1932. He became an American citizen in 1939. From 1933 to 1947, he taught at the University of Rochester. From 1947 until his retirement in 1970, he was a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, where he had numerous doctoral students. \nIn 1936, he demonstrated that recombination can also take place in mitosis resulting in somatic mosaics, organisms that contain two or more genetically distinct types of tissues. He later demonstrated that there were multiple genes on the \"Drosophila\" Y chromosome, and described the mechanism of dosage compensation. \nDuring World War II, he led research for the American government on low dose radiation safety. His laboratory group concluded that there is no \"safe\" threshold below which radiation is not harmful. \nHuman genetics.\nAfter the war his research focused on human genetics, pioneering in what is now known as gene regulation. Although not a physician, he engaged in clinical work in human genetics. In 1943 he began teaching a course in human genetics to medical students at the University of Rochester. The first edition of Stern's pioneering textbook \"The Principles of human genetics\" was published in 1949. Both his teaching and his textbook were instrumental in re-founding human genetics on a non-racist basis, in contrast with pre-war German and American traditions in the subject. Stern was a signatory of the 1950 UNESCO statement \"The Race Question\", a statement by leading scientists in many fields that questioned the validity and scientific foundations of racism.\nThe Curt Stern Award, established by the American Society of Human Genetics in 2001, recognizes a scientist who has made major scientific achievements in human genetics during the previous 10 years."}

Morgan took his PhD at Johns Hopkins University in 1890, and researched embryology while at Bryn Mawr College.\nAfter the rediscovery of Mendelian inheritance in 1900, Morgan switched his research to the fruit fly \"Drosophila melanogaster\". In 1904, E.B. Wilson invited Morgan to join him at Columbia University. This move freed Morgan to focus fully on experimental work.\nIn his famous Fly Room at Columbia, Morgan was able to show that genes are carried on chromosomes and are the mechanical basis of heredity. These discoveries formed the basis of the modern science of genetics.\nMorgan moved to California in 1928 to head the Division of Biology at the California Institute of Technology (CalTech). Research was focused on genetics and evolution; experimental embryology; physiology; biophysics and biochemistry.\nHe was given the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1933. It was the first one given for genetics, for his \"discoveries concerning the role played by the chromosome in heredity\". The prize was not shared with the lab's main researcher, Alfred Sturtevant, a decision of the Nobel Committee which was certainly controversial.\nMorgan's early work with \"Drosophila\" was on the associations known as 'coupling' and 'repulsion', discovered by English workers in 1909 and 1910 using the Sweet Pea. These were, in reality, the same phenomenon, which was later called linkage. Morgan's first papers dealt with the demonstration of sex linkage of the gene for white eyes in the fly, the male fly being heterogametic (XY).\nDuring his distinguished career, Morgan wrote 22 books and 370 scientific papers, and, as a result of his work, \"Drosophila\" became the main 'model organism' in genetics. The Division of Biology he started at the California Institute of Technology produced \"seven\" Nobel Prize winners."}

Born in New York City, he got his PhD at CalTech in Morgan's \"Drosophila\" fly lab. He next worked at Rice University, and then spent twelve years at the University of Texas. Then he moved to Berlin in 1932, then to Leningrad (St Petersburg), and then to Moscow. In all these places he organised a genetics lab, and sometimes taught as well. Then arose the scientific charlatan Lysenko, who saw to it that genuine genetics scientists came under the disapproval of Stalin. Once again Muller moved, this time to Edinburgh, with 250 strains of \"Drosophila\", then finally back to the United States in 1940, where he became an advisor to the Manhattan Project. He became Professor of Zoology at Indiana University.\nMuller's Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1946 was \"for the discovery that mutations can be induced by X-rays\". By then the real interest lay in the same effects caused by gamma rays from nuclear testing. Muller was a wholehearted enthusiast for eugenics, socialism, atheism and other relatively unpopular ideas, but his real contribution was to genetics. One reputable source writes of him:"}

Haiti has of coast-line and a border with the Dominican Republic.\nThe limits of the country are the Dominican Republic to the east, the Atlantic Ocean to the north, and the Caribbean Sea to the south and west. The capital, Port-au-Prince, is a seaport located on the west coast.\nCuba is to the northwest and Jamaica to the southwest of Haiti; the Winward Passage separates Cuba from Haiti (and Hispaniola), and the Jamaica Channel separates Haiti from Jamaica.\nThere are two large peninsulas: the Northwestern on the Atlantic Ocean, and the Southern peninsulas on the Caribbean Sea. The Northwestern, or just Northern, Peninsula () is also known as the Saint-Nicolas Peninsula; it was the first part of the Hispaniola visited by Christopher Columbus on 1492. The historical name of the Southern Peninsula () was Tibur\u00f3n Peninsula.\nBetween those two large peninsulas there is a gulf (a very large bay): the Gulf of Gon\u00e2ve. It is named so after the Gon\u00e2ve Island that is in the middle of the gulf. It was called also Gulf of L\u00e9ogane after the city of L\u00e9ogane, one of the oldest in Haiti.\nClimate.\nHaiti has a tropical climate but modified by elevation and the \"Trade winds\" (winds that come from the northeast, from the Atlantic Ocean, full of water vapour), which blow from the Atlantic all year long. In low lands with mountains to the northeast, the climate is arid (dry) because the trade winds leave their water in those mountains rather than the valleys and plains.\nThere are two rainy seasons, in spring and fall to the south, and in spring and winter to the north. From June to November (mainly from August to October), tropical storms and hurricanes are frequent and can do much damage in the country.\nIslands.\nThere are several smaller islands and cays that are part of Haiti. The largest islands are:\nMountains and valleys.\nThe chains of mountains show a direction northwest-southeast, except in the Southern Peninsula, where they have a direction west-east. The mountains are separated by valleys with the same general direction.\nFrom north to south, the main mountain ranges and valleys are:\nRivers and lakes.\nThe river \"Artibonite\" is the longest river of the island and of Haiti. It is 321\u00a0km long (68\u00a0km in the Dominican Republic, 253\u00a0km in Haiti). Its sources are in the Cordillera Central (Dominican Republic) and flows into the Gulf of Gon\u00e2ve. Its watershed has an area of 6,399\u00a0km\u00b2 in Haiti and 2,614\u00a0km\u00b2 in the Dominican Republic.\nAnother important Haitian river is the \"Trois Rivi\u00e8res\" (Three Rivers).

Her family moved from Devon, England, where she was born, to Virginia, United States, where she went to school and was raised. As an adult, Ivers moved to Leadville, Colorado where she met her husband Frank Duffield. Duffield was responsible for getting Ivers interested in poker, but he was killed a few years after they got married. Ivers made a name for herself by winning money from poker games in places like Silver City, New Mexico, and even working at a saloon that was owned by Bob Ford, the man who killed Jesse James \nEarly life.\n\u201cPoker\u201d Alice Ivers was born on February 17, 1851 in Devon, England to Irish Immigrants. Her family moved to Virginia when Alice was 12. As a young woman, she went to boarding school in Virginia to become a refined lady. While in her late teens, her family moved to Leadville, a city in the Colorado Territory.\nPersonal life.\nIt was in Leadville that Alice met Frank Duffield, whom she married at a young age. Frank Duffield was a mining engineer who played poker in his spare time. After just a few years of marriage, Duffield was killed in an accident while resetting a dynamite charge in a Leadville mine.\nIvers was known for splurging her winnings, as when she won a lot of money in Silver City and spent it all in New York. After all of her big wins, she would travel to New York and spend her money on clothes. She was very keen on keeping up with the latest fashions and would buy dresses to wear to play poker.\nAlice met her next husband around 1890 when she was a dealer in Bedrock Tom\u2019s saloon in Deadwood, South Dakota. When a drunken miner tried to attack her fellow dealer Warren G. Tubbs with a knife, Alice threatened him with her .38. After this incident, Tubbs and Ivers started a romance and were married soon after.\nAlice Ivers and Warren Tubbs had 4 sons and 3 daughters together. Tubbs and Ivers did not want their children to be influenced by the world of poker, so they moved to a house just northeast of Sturgis on the Moreau River in South Dakota. Tubbs was not only a dealer, but a housepainter as well. It was most likely this house painting that caused him to fall sick with tuberculosis. Warren Tubbs died in 1910 in of pneumonia during a blizzard. To pay for his funeral, Alice had to pawn her wedding ring, which led her back to the poker world.\nAlice\u2019s third husband was George Huckert, who worked on her homestead taking care of the sheep. Huckert was constantly proposing to Ivers, yet for a while she did not agree. Eventually, however, Ivers owed Huckert $1,008, so she married him figuring that it would be cheaper than paying his back wages. Huckert died in 1913.\nPoker career.\nFirst husband Frank Duffield introduced Alice to poker when she accompanied him to his poker games in Leadville. For a while she just attended, watching and observing, but eventually she started to play and gamble along with the men. However, it wasn\u2019t until after her first husband died that she started to play poker seriously.\nAlice was in a tough financial position, and after failing in a few different jobs including teaching; she turned to poker to support herself financially. Alice would make money by gambling and working as a dealer. Ivers made a name for herself by winning money from poker games in places like Silver City, New Mexico, even working at a saloon that was owned by Bob Ford, the man who killed Jesse James.\nBy the time Ivers was given the name \u201cPoker Alice,\u201d she was drawing in large crowd to watch her play and men were constantly challenging her to play. Saloon owners liked that Ivers was a respectable woman who kept to her values. These values included her refusal to play poker on Sundays.\nAs her reputation grew, so did the amount of money she was making. Some nights she would even make $6,000, an incredibly large sum of money at the time. Alice claimed that she won $250,000, which would now be worth over three million dollars.\nIvers used her good looks to distract men at the poker table. She always had the newest dresses, and even in her 50s was considered a very attractive woman. She was also very good at counting cards and figuring odds, which helped her at the table.\nAlice was known to always be carrying a gun with her, preferably her .38. She was also known to smoke a lot.\nPoker's Palace and jailtime.\nIn 1910, Ivers opened \u201cPoker\u2019s Palace,\u201d a saloon in Fort Meade, South Dakota, which offered gambling and liquor downstairs, and prostitution upstairs. The saloon was always closed on Sundays, due to Iver\u2019s religious beliefs. However, in 1913, some drunken soldiers disobeyed Iver\u2019s \u201cno work on Sunday\u201d rule and started to get unruly, chaotic, and destructive of the house. It was then that Ivers shot her gun, supposedly to quiet the soldiers down. The shot ended up killing one of the soldiers and injuring another, resulting in Iver\u2019s arrest, along with the arrest of six of her \u2018girls\u2019.\nIver\u2019s time spent in jail was short, but she got through it with the help of reading the bible and smoking cigars. At the trial, she claimed self-defense and was acquitted. After the trial, her saloon was shut down.\nWhile in her 60s, Alice Ivers was arrested several times after the \u201cPoker Palace\u201d incident for being a madam, a gambler, and a bootlegger, as well as her drunkenness.

In one poll in the United States, 66% of conservatives called themselves pro-life. It is also associated with the Catholic Church.

They experimented with recording uses at around the age of 10, using tape machines to layer cut-up samples of found sounds over compositions of their own. In their teens they went in a number of amateur bands; however, it was not until 1986 when Marcus was invited to Mike's band that Boards of Canada was born. By 1989, the band had gone down just to Sandison and Eoin. In the early 1990s, a number of collaborations took place and the band put on small shows among the \"Hexagon Sun\" collective.\nIn early 2000, the website for the band, Music70.com, removed the early discography of Boards of Canada, although some information has been preserved by fans. Early tape releases by Boards of Canada include \"Play By Numbers\", \"Acid Memories\", \"Hooper Bay\", and the earliest known release by the band is titled \"Catalog 3\".

He was the first person to use the term genetics to describe the study of heredity, and the chief populariser of the ideas of Gregor Mendel, after their rediscovery in 1900 by Hugo de Vries and Carl Correns.\nCareer.\nBateson became famous as a mutationist who believed evolution took place by jumps. Later, Ronald Fisher and J.B.S. Haldane showed that discrete mutations were compatible with gradual evolution: see the modern evolutionary synthesis.\nBateson was the first to suggest the word \"genetics\" to describe the study of inheritance, in a letter to Adam Sedgwick, dated April 18, 1905. Bateson first used the term \"genetics\" publicly at the Third International Conference on Plant Hybridization in London in 1906. Although this was three years before Wilhelm Johannsen used the word \"gene\" to describe the units of hereditary information, De Vries had introduced the word \"pangene\" for the same concept already in 1889 and etymologically the word genetics finds its origin in Darwin's concept of pangenesis.\nBateson co-discovered genetic linkage with Reginald Punnett, and he and Punnett founded the \"Journal of Genetics\" in 1910. Bateson also coined the term \"epistasis\" to describe the genetic interaction of two independent traits. So important from 1900 to 1910, he was almost a bystander for the next ten years because he refused to accept the role chromosomes played in genetics. At last, in 1921, a visit to T.H. Morgan's fly lab convinced him, but by then he could no longer recover his influence."}

The public has to vote on which celebrity has to do it apart from in the first two or three days. Sometimes, near the end of the series the celebrities decide who participates in the trail. To make the trials more challenging, they put some creepy crawlies with them. All trials have stars, and they earn stars for meals back at the camp.\nCut scenes.\nLike \"Big Brother\", the show has a lot of cut scenes. One of them has a spider which catches a bug and spins it around and makes an amusing sound."}

It occurs during meiosis.\nCrossing over is the exchange of chromosome segments between non-sister chromatids during the production of gametes. The effect is to assort (shuffle) the alleles on parental chromosomes, so that the gametes carry \"combinations\" of genes different from either parent. This has the overall effect of increasing the variety of phenotypes present in a population.\nThe process can be seen directly in stained cells, and indirectly if there are genetic markers or not on the chromosomes. The visible crossovers are called chiasma (plural: chiasmata), which is Greek for a cross. F. A. Janssens was the first to suggest what chiasmata meant.\nThe large-scale effect of crossing over is to spread variation through a population. This is the main result of sexual reproduction compared to non-sexual modes of reproduction.\nThe main advantage to the parents is the greater variety in their offspring. This, it is thought, increases the chance that some of the offspring will survive and reproduce. This has been the subject of much investigation and discussion."}

This has profound consequences: it produces genetic recombination, and increases the variability of gametes."}

The RFC was followed by the Royal Air Force (RAF), which was founded in March 1918.\nTrenchard, who learnt to fly in 1912, eventually became Chief of the Air Staff in 1919. In that position he reorganised the Air Ministry, and laid the foundations of the Royal Air Force.\nTrenchard was Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police from 1931 to 1935. The Commissioner is the highest ranking police officer in the United Kingdom, despite the fact that his authority is generally confined to Greater London.\nCareer.\nAs a boy Trenchard found learning difficult. He failed many tests and only just got into the British Army as an officer. Trenchard first went to India with the Army and he then asked to go to South Africa because he wanted to fight in the Boer War. During the fighting, Trenchard was shot in the chest and became unable to walk properly because of damage to his back. He returned to England where a doctor told him to go to Switzerland because the air was better than in England. Trenchard became bored and started to bobsleigh. After crashing on a fast bend, Trenchard was able to walk properly - because his back was fixed. After his health got better still, Trenchard returned to the war in South Africa.\nIn 1912, Trenchard learned to fly and joined the Royal Flying Corps. He became the second most important man at the Central Flying School in England and had several important jobs in the Royal Flying Corps during World War I. Trenchard was the man in charge of the Royal Flying Corps in France from 1915 to 1917. In 1918, he was the first man in charge of the Royal Air Force for a short time. He then went back to France to take over the Royal Air Force bombing attacks on Germany. Winston Churchill put him back in charge of the Royal Air Force in 1919. Over the next 10 years, Trenchard started Air Force training bases and made sure that it was used to enforce the law in parts of the British Empire. In the 1930s Trenchard was in charge of the London's police force (the Metropolitan Police) and as an older man he argued for keeping a big RAF. In modern times, some people say that Trenchard was one of the first people to argue for strategic bombing."}

He lived in the period known as the Baroque period. His most famous music is his \"Te Deum\". This work begins with a prelude which today is extremely popular. It was the signature tune for the European Broadcasting Union where it was used to introduce programmes such as the Vienna New Year's Concert and the Eurovision Song Contest. It is often used as a voluntary for weddings.\nLife.\nWe do not know much for certain about his early life. He went to Italy where he learned a lot by studying the music of Italian composers. He studied with the composer Giacomo Carissimi for several years.\nWhen he returned to France he got a job as musician to the Duchess of Guise who was a rich lady who employed several musicians. He worked for her for many years, both as a singer (he had a high tenor voice known in French as an \u201chaute-contre\u201d), and as a composer. When the great playwright Moli\u00e8re stopped working with Lully he asked Charpentier to work with him. He wrote music for several plays by Moli\u00e8re including \"Le malade imaginaire\". After Moli\u00e8re's died in 1673, Charpentier continued to write for other playwrights such as Thomas Corneille and Jean Donneau de Vis\u00e9. He often used more musicians than he was allowed (only Lully, the king\u2019s composer, was allowed to use lots of musicians for his performances). In the end Charpentier stopped writing music for plays.\nIn 1679, Charpentier was invited to compose for the king\u2019s son, the Dauphin. The Dauphin had a private chapel and Charpentier wrote religious music for him. In 1683 he was given a royal pension. In April of that year he became very ill and could not work for a time.\nFrom late 1687 to early 1698, Charpentier was \"ma\u00eetre de musique\" to the Jesuits, Soon he stopped composing big works such as oratorios and concentrated on smaller works for church worship which were sometimes played by a large number of players. He also was music teacher to the Duke of Chartres.\nIn 1698 he was made ma\u00eetre de musique at the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris. This was one of the top musical jobs in France (the only better job in sacred music in France was director of the royal chapel at Versailles). He kept this job until his death in 1704. After his death nearly all the works he wrote for the Chapel were destroyed. This was the usual procedure when a ma\u00eetre de musique died. His famous Mass \"Assumpta Est Maria\" has survived. Perhaps that is because it was not composed for the Chapel.\nHis music.\nCharpentier\u2019s compositions include oratorios, masses, operas, and many smaller works. He also wrote a lot of music for plays. Many of his smaller works for one or two voices and instruments he called \"air s\u00e9rieux\" or \"air \u00e0 boire\" if they are in French, but \"cantata\" if they are in Italian.\nBibliography.\nThe New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, ed.

He became famous for his amazing story of survival and is likely to have inspired Daniel Defoe to write the book \"Robinson Crusoe\".\nHe was on an expedition when the captain of the ship, Captain Stradling, left him on an island off the coast of Chile. Selkirk's job on board was the navigator. He controlled where the ship needed to go and where it was at that point in time. He had an important job. He tried to warn the captain about certain repairs that were needed but the captain ignored Selkirk and carried on sailing. Selkirk knew the ship was to drown at any given moment and tried to demand the repairs were taken care of but nobody listened. They had stopped at an island to restock fresh water and supplies. Selkirk said he would rather stay on the island than continue to ride on a dangerous, leaky ship. So there he was left. He had last minute second thoughts and tried to get back onto the ship but Stradling refused. Selkirk was marooned on that island for about four years and had to rely on himself and his skills for survival.\nAt the time of his rescue, he had been gone for about four years. He was very familiar with crafting things himself out of resources on the islands and having to use his survival skills. He heard noises and when he went to find out what it was, he saw ships on the horizon. He didn't know if they were on his side or enemies but he knew he had to try. He got their attention and so they sailed over to his island. Once they had beached on the shore, Selkirk came out from the bushes with his hands up. It turned out they were English and on his side. They let him aboard their ship and they were at sea for another year, stopping off at a few places, before returning to England.\nWhen he returned, his story was written down by a person in his town and has been made into a slightly different version by Daniel Defoe who named it Robinson Crusoe. 'Robinson Crusoe' has been rewritten many times by lots of different people. There were some differences like how Crusoe was stranded for over twenty years and Selkirk, four. Even though this story was based off Selkirk, the exact island he was deserted on was renamed Robinson Crusoe Island after previously being called Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Island.\nThe book is a major piece of literature which is important in the history of English and the beginning of the popularity of novels."}

The south-eastern states of Styria, Carinthia as well as Burgenland in the east have fewer Muslims than the average.\nAustria is unique among Western European countries. It is until now the only country that has granted Muslims the status of a recognized religious community. They were first recognised after Austria-Hungary's annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878. Austria has regulated the religious freedoms of the Muslim community with the so called \"Anerkennungsgesetz\" (\"Act of Recognition\"). This law was reactivated in 1979 when the Community of Muslim Believers in Austria (\"Islamische Glaubensgemeinschaft in \u00d6sterreich\") was founded. This organization has the right to give lessons of religious education in state schools. It could also collect \"church tax\", but so far it has not exercised this privilege. It does not build, finance or administer mosques in Austria.\nParallel structures exist within the Islamic religious group. The religious life takes place in mosques belonging to organisations. These organisations represent one of the currents of Turkish, Bosnian and Arab Muslims. Among the Turkish organisations, the \"Federation of Turkish-Islamic Associations\" is controlled by the Directorate for Religious Affairs, whereas the other groups, such as the \"S\u00fcleymanc\u0131\"s and \"Milli G\u00f6r\u00fc\u015f\" can be seen as branches of the pan-European organisation centered in Germany."}

Later, it was discovered that the horse was giving the right answers by watching the reactions of the people who were watching him.\nHow Hans seemed to be clever.\nHans was a horse that lived in Germany in the early 20th century. He belonged to a man called Wilhelm von Osten. Von Osten was a teacher who taught mathematics at a local school. He was an amateur horse trainer.\nThis was a time when people were becoming interested in how intelligent animals were. This was largely because of what Charles Darwin had been writing about.\nVon Osten taught Hans to add, subtract, multiply, divide, work with fractions, tell the time and date, read and spell and to understand German. If he asked the horse a question such as: \"What is 12 plus 12\", the horse would tap its hoof 24 times. Von Osten traveled round the country with Hans, showing off his clever horse to the public.\nScientists became interested in Clever Hans. The psychologist Carl Stumpf got a group of people together to study what was happening. His assistant Oskar Pfungst was the main investigator. The horse almost always gave the right answer when he could see his owner. He also gave the right answer if someone else asked him a question. This showed that Von Osten was not deliberately giving him secret signs.\nPfungst provided the horse with blinders, which meant the horse could see only straight ahead. If he could see the person asking him the question, he got the answers right 89% of the time. If the person asking the questions was standing to the side, where the horse could not see, the answers were right only 6% of the time. Also, the horse did not get the answer right if the person asking the question did not know the answer himself.\nWhen the horse could answer the question, it started to tap more slowly when it got near to the right answer. Then it stopped when it got to the right answer. This showed that the horse was watching the person asking the question, and could sense when the person was expecting him to stop. Von Osten probably did not realize that he was giving the horse signals just by looking at him. The horse was, indeed, clever to guess what was wanted of him, but of course it did not understand the mathematics. The final proof was that Pfungst discovered how to signal to the horse, by slightly raising his eyebrows. Then he could get the horse to give any response he wanted.\nThe Clever Hans effect.\nThis effect is often called the \"Clever Hans effect\". It is used in psychology to describe when an animal or a person senses what someone wants them to do, even though they are not deliberately being given signals. It is important to take this effect into account when testing animals' intelligence or human intelligence. An animal may need to be separated from its trainer if their true intelligence is to be observed. On the other hand, an animal may be upset when it cannot see its trainer, so it might not give the right answer. This problem can often be solved by creating a situation in which the trainer does not know the right answer.\nThe Clever Hans effect is famous, and has been used in popular culture. For example, there is an episode of \"The Simpsons\" (\"Smart and Smarter\"), in which Lisa Simpson becomes jealous of her baby sister Maggie because Maggie seems to be even more intelligent than Lisa. Then it is discovered that Maggie has been watching Lisa so carefully that she could sense what the answers were. Lisa is relieved to discover this."}

It is the study of gene expression, the way genes bring about their phenotypic effects.\nThese changes in gene activity may stay for the rest of the cell's life. They may last for many generations of cells, through cell divisions. However, \"there is no change in the underlying DNA sequence of the organism\". Instead, non-hereditary factors cause the organism's genes to behave (express themselves) differently. Epigenetics works by mechanisms such as DNA methylation.\nEpigenetic factors may last into adulthood.\nDefinitions.\nA general definition is \"the study of... gene activity during the development of complex organisms\". Thus \"epigenetic\" can be used to describe anything other than DNA sequence which influences the development of an organism.\nA stricter or narrower definition is \"the study of mitotically and/or meiotically heritable changes in gene function which cannot be explained by changes in DNA sequence\". \nThe term \"epigenetics\" has been used to describe processes which are not heritable. An example is histone modification. So some definitions do not require heritability. Adrian Bird defined epigenetics as \"the structural adaptation of chromosomal regions so as to register, signal or perpetuate altered activity states\". This definition includes DNA repair or cell division phases, and stable changes across cell generations. It excludes others such as prions unless they affect chromosome function. \nThe NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Project uses the definition: \"...For purposes of this program, epigenetics refers to both heritable changes in gene activity and expression (in the progeny of cells or individuals) and also stable, long-term alterations in the transcriptional potential of a cell\".\nIn 2008, a consensus definition of the epigenetic trait, \"stably heritable phenotype resulting from changes in a chromosome \"without alterations in the DNA sequence\"\", was made at a Cold Spring Harbor meeting.\nA somewhat out of date but otherwise reliable and readable account is from \"The Guardian\" newspaper.\nImprinting.\nGenetic imprinting in this context means \"tagging a gene for the lifetime of the individual\". Tagging is the basic operation where cytosine amino acids have a methyl group added by the enzyme DNA methyltransferase. This changes the operation of that gene to be (usually) more favourable to the individual. Usually, it switches the gene off. In general, the advantage of this is to keep the gene output in the most favourable condition for the lifetime of the particular individual. \nImprinting is giving rise to much medical research at present.\nMammals.\nImprinting seems to have evolved only about 150 million years ago in animals. It seems largely confined to mammals. However, it may have originated separately (and earlier) in plants.\nExamples.\nThe best example of epigenetic changes in eukaryotes is the process of cell differentiation. During morphogenesis, generalised stem cells become the cell lines of the embryo which in turn become fully differentiated cells. In other words, a single fertilized egg cell \u2013 the zygote \u2013 divides and changes into all the many cell types: neurons, muscle cells, epithelium, blood vessels etc.\nAs the embryo develops, some genes get switched on, while others are switched off or moderated. This process is called gene regulation. There are many molecules inside the cell nucleus which do the job of adjusting the genes' output.\nDNA and histones make up what is called chromatin. Epigenetic modifications to the chromatin are copied during cell division. This produces a line of cells, all of which are alike. This is called a tissue.\nMeiosis cancels epigenetic changes, and resets the genome to its baseline state, so the process unfolds in each new generation. There are some exceptions to this rule, but none of these exceptions involve changes to DNA base pair sequences.\nThis process is different from mutations of the DNA. Genetic mutations change the primary DNA sequence, and mutations can happen in any cell. However, only mutations in cells involved in reproduction can affect the offspring.\nForms of genetic imprinting have been found in plants and filamentous fungi."}

It is part of developmental biology. Different tissues have different kinds of organelles inside the cells. \nDifferentiation occurs many times during the development of a multicellular organism. The organism changes from a single zygote to a complex system of tissues and cell types. Differentiation is also a common process in adults: adult stem cells divide to make fully-differentiated daughter cells during tissue repair and during normal cell turnover.\nDifferentiation dramatically changes a cell's size, shape, metabolic activity, and responsiveness to signals. These changes are largely due to changes in gene expression. With a few exceptions, cellular differentiation almost never involves a change in the DNA sequence itself. It does involve switching off many genes not needed in a particular tissue. Thus, cells in different tissues may have very different physical characteristics despite having the same genome.\n\"Cell potency\" is a cell's ability to differentiate into other cell types. A cell that is able to differentiate into many cell types is known as \"pluripotent\". Such cells are called stem cells in animals and meristematic cells in higher plants. A cell that is able to differentiate into all cell types is known as \"totipotent\". In mammals, only the zygote and early embryonic cells are totipotent, while in plants many differentiated cells can become totipotent with simple laboratory techniques."}

{"id": "214796", "revid": "838831", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=214796", "title": "Fitness", "text": "Fitness in biology is the relative ability of an organism to survive and pass on its genes to the next generation.p160 It is a central idea in evolutionary theory. Fitness is usually equal to the proportion of the individual's genes in all the genes of the next generation.\nLike all terms in evolutionary biology, fitness is defined in terms of an interbreeding population, which might or might not be a whole species. If differences in individual genotypes affect fitness, then the frequencies of the genotypes will change over generations; the genotypes with higher fitness become more common. This is the process called natural selection.\nAn individual's fitness is caused by its phenotype, and passed on by its genotype. The fitnesses of different individuals with the same genotype are not necessarily equal. It depends on the environment in which the individuals live, and on accidental events. However, since the fitness of the genotype is an averaged quantity, it reflects the reproductive outcomes of \"all\" individuals with that genotype.\nRelatedness.\nFitness measures the number of the \"copies\" of the genes of an individual in the next generation. It doesn't really matter how the genes arrive in the next generation. For an individual, it is equally \"beneficial\" to reproduce itself, or to help relatives with similar genes to reproduce, \"as long as similar number of copies of individual's genes get passed on to the next generation\". Selection which promotes this kind of helper behaviour is called kin selection.\nOur closest relatives (parents, siblings, and our own children) share on average 50% (half) of our genes. One step further removed are grandparents. With each of them we share on average 25% (a quarter) of our genes. That is a measure of our relatedness to them. Next come first cousins (children of our parents' siblings). We share 12.5% (1/8) of their genes.p100\nHamilton's rule.\nWilliam Hamilton added various ideas to the notion of fitness. His rule suggests that a costly action should be performed if:\nFitness costs and benefits are measured in fecundity.\nInclusive fitness.\nInclusive fitness is a term which is essentially the same as fitness, but emphasises the group of genes rather than individuals.\nBiological fitness says how well an organism can reproduce, and spread its genes to its offspring. The theory of inclusive fitness says that the fitness of an organism is also increased to the extent that its close relatives also reproduce. This is because relatives share genes in proportion to their relationship.\nAnother way of saying it: \"the inclusive fitness of an organism is not a property of itself, but a property of its set of genes\". It is calculated from the reproductive success of the individual, plus the reproductive success of its relatives, each one weighed by an appropriate coefficient of relatedness.\nHistory.\nThe British social philosopher Herbert Spencer coined the phrase \"survival of the fittest\" in his 1864 work \"Principles of biology\" to mean what Charles Darwin called natural selection. The original phrase was \"survival of the best fitted\"."}

Her birth name was Priscilla Maria Veronica White and she was born in Liverpool. She became known for her songs \"Anyone Who Had A Heart\" and \"You're My World\" as well as her long-running TV shows \"Blind Date\" (1985-2003) and \"Surprise Surprise\" (1984-2001).\nIn the early 1960s, young Cilla worked at the Cavern Club in Liverpool, where the Beatles often performed, as a hat check girl. She also sang onstage at the Cavern sometimes, backed by the band that was playing at the time. \"Swinging Cilla\" was well-liked by the Cavern's members and guests.\nOne day Brian Epstein visited the Cavern to meet the Beatles, and ask about a record they made, so he could sell copies at his family's music store. Stories rose later that Cilla was working, and she first met Epstein when he gave her his hat and coat. Neither one remembered this later, though, and each believed the story was not true.\nEpstein's getting to know the Beatles led to his becoming their manager, and with his help, they won a recording contract. The Beatles' talent and work with music producer George Martin led to hit records. Epstein decided to manage other Liverpool musicians. Along with the bands and male singers he signed up, Epstein chose Cilla as his only female performer. He suggested her stage name (changing White to Black), so she and her family could keep their privacy. Martin also agreed to record her, helping choose songs that would showcase her voice.\nCilla became popular first in England and Europe, then in America as the Beatles' music started the \"British Invasion\" there in 1964. One of her first hits, \"Anyone Who Had A Heart\", was recorded earlier by American singer Dionne Warwick. The two records sounded similar, even though Cilla had not heard Warwick's version, and a few people believed she had copied it. Both women later also recorded the theme song for the movie \"Alfie\", but they sounded different.\nCilla had other hit records, including \"You're My World\" and a television theme song, \"Step Inside, Love\". Epstein enjoyed working with her, even helping her choose wardrobe for performances and looking after her backstage, but personal problems later took away his attention. He died in 1967, after a drug overdose.\nIn time, Cilla Black stopped having hits. She remained popular in England, though, and was a welcome hostess and guest on television. She also made appearances from time to time, to sing the songs from the time she was most popular.\nIn later years, her health became poor. Arthritis made walking painful, and she was nearly deaf. She admitted that she did not want to live past 75 years old, because she enjoyed her life less and less as she aged.\nCilla Black died of a stroke after a fall at her holiday home near Marbella, Spain, on 1 August 2015, aged 72. Her funeral took place in Liverpool on 20 August 2015."}

Two of his grandparents were priests and his father was an assistant professor. At school Bulgakov developed an interest in Russian writing, European writing, the theatre and the opera.\nIn 1913 Bulgakov married Tatiana Lappa. When the First World War started he volunteered with the Red Cross as a doctor. Bulgakov was sent to an area where fighting was heavy, and he was badly injured at least twice. In 1916, he graduated from the Medical School of Kiev University. Bulgakov then joined the White Army with his brothers. They fought against the communists who were taking control of Russia. Bulgakov also fought in the Ukrainian People's Army.\nAfter the Russian Civil War, Mikhail and his brothers went to the Caucasus in Western Russia. Mikhail worked as a journalist. Many members of Bulgakov's family left Russia for Western Europe. Bulgakov was not allowed into other countries, however, as he had a disease: typhus.\nThe injuries Bulgakov received in the First World War continued to cause him a lot of pain. To ease the pain, he started injecting himself with morphine. He eventually became addicted. He wrote a book about this period called \"Morphine\", which was finally released in 1926.\nBulgakov left medicine behind as he was now sure he wanted to be a writer. He moved to Moscow with his wife Tatiana in 1921. Bulgakov eventually divorced Tatiana, and married Lyubov' Belozerskaya in 1924. He published a number of works in the early 1920s. By 1927, however, he was criticised by people who said he was writing against the Soviet government. By 1929, Bulgakov's writing career was in ruins. Government censorship stopped his work and plays being released in the USSR.\nIn 1931, Bulgakov got married again, to Yelena Shilovskaya. Yelena inspired one of the main characters in Bulgakov's most famous novel, \"The Master and Margarita\". In the last ten years of his life, Bulgakov continued to write novels, plays and translate works in other languages. Many could still not be published in the USSR of the 1930s. Those that were published were often heavily criticised.\nBulgakov did not like the way Soviet system prevented his works being published. He wrote a letter to the Soviet government asking permission to leave the country. He even spoke directly to Stalin on the telephone, asking to be allowed to leave the USSR. Stalin's reply implied that if Bulgakov attempted to leave, he would be killed.\nStalin did allow Bulgakov to work at a small theatre in Moscow, however. Bulgakov eventually worked at the Moscow Art Theatre, but the Soviet system still did not allow him to write as he really wanted. This, and the fact that he was not allowed to go abroad to see his family, made Bulgakov very unhappy.\nBulgakov died from problems with his kidneys on March 10, 1940. He was buried in the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow.\n\"The Master and Margarita\".\nThe novel is a satire on the Soviet society. It is covered by a plot in which two apparently unrelated stories alternate chapter by chapter. The first plot theme is the Devil in modern Moscow; the second is the story of Pontius Pilate. Connecting these two themes are Satan himself, and the Master with his devoted lover Margarita. The Master is an embittered author, whose historical novel about Pontius Pilate had been rejected by the Soviet literary committee .\nBy means of the plot, Bulgakov deals with some of the deepest issues in life: the interplay of good and evil, innocence and guilt, courage and cowardice.\nBulgakov started writing the novel in 1928. He burnt the first manuscript of the novel in 1930, seeing no future as a writer in the Soviet Union. The work was restarted in 1931. The second draft was completed in 1936 by which point all the major plot lines of the final version were in place. The third draft was finished in 1937. Bulgakov continued to revise the work, helped by his wife, but was forced to stop work on the fourth version four weeks before his death in 1940.\nA censored version (12% of the text removed and still more changed) of the book was first published in \"Moscow\" magazine (#11, 1966 and #1, 1967). The text of all the omitted and changed parts, with indications of the places of modification, was published on a samizdat basis. In 1967 the publisher \"Posev\" (Frankfurt) printed a version produced with the aid of these inserts.\nIn the Soviet Union, the first complete version, prepared by Anna Saakyants, was published in 1973, based on the version of the beginning of 1940 proofread by the publisher. In 1989 the last version was prepared by literature expert Lidiya Yanovskaya based on all available manuscripts.\nThe novel is autobiographical. Bulgakov is the Master, and his trials and difficulties are very similar to those the Master faces. Margarita is Yelena Shilovskaya, his long-term girlfriend who became his third wife. The burning of the Master's manuscript is just what Bulgakov did, and for the same reasons of despair and frustration. Of course a state literary committee prevented its publication, just as did in the novel. And Bulgakov was fascinated with the confrontation between Christ and Pontius Pilate.\nBulgakov never lived to see the manuscript published, nor to enjoy his post-war fame. He died from nephrosclerosis (an inherited kidney disorder) on 10 March 1940. His father died of the same disease, and Bulgakov had long expected his fate.\nIn other media.\nThe novel has been the basis of films, stage productions, opera, ballet, and television versions."}

He was one of the founders (along with Ronald Fisher and Sewall Wright) of population genetics.\nJack Haldane was a communist, atheist and a writer of popular science books, and articles for the \"Daily Worker\". His major professional work was his contribution of mathematical papers on the theory of evolution, which assisted the modern evolutionary synthesis.\nCareer.\nBetween 1919 and 1922 he was a Fellow of New College, Oxford University, then moved to Cambridge University, where he accepted a Readership in Biochemistry at Trinity College and taught there until 1932. During his nine years at Cambridge, Haldane worked on enzymes and genetics, particularly the mathematical side of genetics. Haldane wrote many popular essays on science that were eventually collected and published in 1927 in a volume entitled \"Possible Worlds\".\nHe then accepted a position as Professor of Genetics and moved to University College London where he spent most of his academic career. Four years later he became the first Weldon Professor of Biometry at University College London.\nHaldane's move to India, initially to the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) was influenced by a number of factors. Officially he stated that his chief political reason was in response to the Suez Crisis. He wrote: \"Finally, I am going to India because I consider that recent acts of the British Government have been violations of international law.\" \nHis interest in India was also because of his interest in biological research, belief that the warm climate would do him good and that India offered him freedom and shared socialist dreams. At the ISI, he headed the biometry unit and spent time researching a range of topics and guiding other researchers around him."}

Ernest Hemingway then used the term in the introduction to his novel \"The Sun Also Rises\".\nThe term is generally used for the period from the end of the First World War to the beginning of the Great Depression.\nMeaning.\nAfter the First World War, members of the \"Lost Generation\" decided that they did not want to live a normal life in America. They went to Europe, often Paris. Away from America, the \"Lost Generation\" often drank heavily, had affairs and tried to find meaning in life. The \"Lost Generation\" produced some of the finest writing of all time, and arguably created a new style of writing."}

Caves can also be formed during natural catastrophes, such as earthquakes, or by ice and glaciers.\nCaves can have formations in them such as stalagmites and stalactites. These are made over thousands of years by water dripping and leaving mineral deposits.\nMany creatures live in the entrance areas of caves, for example snakes, mice, spiders &amp; porcupines. Only a few animals are found deep in caves. Bats often live in caves. Another common creature found in caves is cave crickets. \nIn the past, people lived in caves.

{"id": "214943", "revid": "448279", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=214943", "title": "Automobile", "text": "An automobile (or car) is a land vehicle used to carry passengers. Automobiles usually have four wheels, and an engine or motor to make them move.\nName.\nThe word \"automobile\" comes from the Greek prefix \"\u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc\" (self) and the Latin word \"mobilis\" (moving). This name means \"self-moving\", as cars run on their own power and do not need horses or other power from outside to move.\nTypes of automobiles.\nAutomobiles are made in different shapes and sizes, for people with different needs. Here are some common types.\nEnergy.\nTo make an automobile move, it must have energy to turn the wheels. This energy might be chemical energy in gasoline or electrical energy in a battery. How quickly the engine or motor can send the energy to the wheels, and how much energy is sent, is called the power of the motor. The power of an automobile is usually measured in kilowatts or horsepower.\nGasoline.\nAs of 2019, most automobile burn a fuel to make an internal combustion engine (sometimes called a \"motor\") run. The power from the engine then goes to the wheels through a transmission, which has a set of gears that can make the automobile go faster or slower. The most common fuel is petrol, which is called \"\"gasoline\" or \"gas\"\" in American English.\nGasoline is called a fossil fuel because it comes from tiny fossils that were made millions of years ago. Over millions of years, they turned into oil, which was then drilled up from deep inside the Earth, and then turned into fuel by chemical changes. Old gasoline-powered automobiles are noisy and their exhaust makes city air dirty, which can make people ill. But automobiles made after the mid-2010s are cleaner.\nBurning gasoline, like any kind of fossil fuel, makes carbon dioxide, which makes global warming. Since 2017, less gasoline powered automobiles are being made, and some places will not allow gasoline-powered automobiles in future, like Amsterdam in 2030.\nBatteries.\nThe cleanest automobiles are electric vehicles. They are usually plugged into a power outlet or a charging station and store electricity in a battery at the bottom of the automobile. The electricity then drives an electric motor, which turns the wheels. Some electric automobiles have 2 motors: one at the front, and one at the back. A few have 4 motors (one for each wheel).\nOther sources of energy.\nSome automobiles burn diesel fuel, which is used in big trucks and buses, and a few use wood gas. In some countries, such as Brazil and Sweden, a mixture of ethanol and gasoline, called \"gasohol\" in Brazil and \"E85\" in Sweden, is used as automobile fuel. Other fuels include propane, natural gas, compressed air, and ethanol (which comes from plants). There are automobiles designed to run on more than one type of fuel \u2014 these are called \"flex-fuel\" and are rare.\nA few automobiles generate electricity from hydrogen fuel cells (like the Honda Clarity). As of 2019, most of the hydrogen that people use comes from burning fossil fuels, but scientists and engineers are trying to make hydrogen from renewable energy a lot cheaper and easier to use.Some automobiles even use solar cells for their electricity, but they are not very practical. There is a competition every year where people try to design a automobile that can last the longest and go the farthest on solar energy alone. \nThere is also a type of automobile that uses both an engine and an electric motor. This is called a hybrid electric vehicle; an example is the Toyota Prius.\nRegenerative Brakes.\nAll automobiles have brakes which work by friction to stop the automobile quickly in an emergency or stop it rolling when parked. Electric automobiles also have \"regenerative\" brakes, which slow the automobile by turning the energy in its movement back into electricity, like an electric motor working the opposite way. So \"regenerative\" means the electricity is generated again.\nHistory.\nThe earliest recorded automobiles were actually steam engines attached to wagons in the late 18th century. The steam engines were heavy, making these wagons slow and hard to control. Better and faster steam automobiles became common late in the 19th century.\nSome automobiles in the early 20th century were powered by electricity. They were slow and heavy and went out of use until the idea came back later in the century.\nThe internal combustion engine changed the way many automobiles were powered. The engine used either gasoline, diesel, or kerosene to work. When the fuel is exploded in a cylinder it pushes the piston down and turns the wheels.\nAlthough many people tried to make a good automobile that would work and sell well, people say that Karl Benz invented the modern automobile. He used a four-stroke type of internal combustion engine to power his \"Benz Patent-Motorwagen\" in 1886. He began to make many automobiles in a factory and sell them in Germany in 1888.\nIn North America, the first modern automobile was made by brothers Charles and J. Frank Duryea in Springfield, Massachusetts. The Duryea brothers' automobile also won the first-ever car race in 1895, competing against automobiles made by Benz. The race was in Chicago, Illinois, and 53 miles long. The Duryeas then began making the first automobiles for everyday use in 1896. That year, they made 13 automobiles by hand in Springfield, Massachusetts.\nBenz may have invented the first modern automobile, and the Duryeas the first automobile to be sold, but Henry Ford sold the most automobiles to the most people. In 1910 he began making and selling his Model T, which was a huge success. Many people could afford this automobile, not just the rich, because Ford used mass production. This meant he made many Model Ts in a short time in a factory. People say that the Model T is the automobile that \"put America on wheels\". The Model T was the most popular automobile of the time because it was cheap but it was still a good quality automobile that ordinary people could own.\nSince then, many different kinds of automobiles have been designed and built, from minivans to sports cars. In the 1950s, the United States made and used more automobiles than all the rest of the world. Fifty years later, China became the largest maker and user of automobiles.\nAdvantages.\nAutomobiles are faster than walking or riding a bike if you are going a long way. They can carry more than one person and a large amount of luggage. Depending on local public transport quality, they can also be faster and far more convenient than using buses, bicycles or trains, and can often go where public transport cannot. 4-wheel drive \"off road\" vehicles are particularly good at reaching places difficult for other wheeled transport due to bad roads or harsh terrain. However, they cost more and burn more fuel, and there are many places even they cannot go.\nMost automobiles enclose people and cargo in a closed compartment with a roof, doors and windows, thus giving protection from weather. Modern automobiles give further protection in case of collisions, as they have added safety features such as seat belts, airbags, crumple zones and side-impact protection that would be expensive or impossible on two-wheeled or light 3-wheeled vehicles, or most buses.\nWith regular check ups and service, automobiles can last a very long time. In some countries like Australia, people have to get their automobile checked by authorised mechanics regularly by law to confirm that their automobile is safe to drive. They can go to an automobile mechanic to get their automobile checked or have a mobile mechanic come to them to repair their automobile.\nDisadvantages.\nBuying and running a automobile needs a lot of money, especially for newer good-quality automobiles. There are things to pay for \u2014 the automobile itself, fuel, parts (for example, tyres), maintenance, repairs, insurance to cover the cost of crashes or theft, parking charges, and toll roads and any taxes or licensing fees charged by the government.\nWhen automobiles crash, they can become damaged and hurt people, and the life of a person is more important than keeping a automobile from damage. When too many automobiles try to go the same way, traffic congestion slows them all. Automobiles can cause air pollution if too many are used in a small area like a city, and the combined pollution of the world's automobiles is partly to blame for climate change. Many places where people live close together have public transportation such as buses, trains, trams and subways. These can help people go more quickly and cheaply than by automobile when traffic jams are a problem. Some of these problems can be made smaller, for example by carpooling, which is putting many people together in one automobile.\nTraffic congestion and accidents can be dangerous to other road users, for example people riding bicycles or walking, especially in an old town built when automobiles were few. Some 20th century towns are designed for automobiles as the main transport. This can cause other problems, such as even more pollution and traffic, as few, if any, people walk. Communities are divided and separated by big roads. Pedestrians are in danger where there are too few foot bridges, small road bridges or other special crossings."}

In the last six years, Slovakia has won three medals at the World Championships, including a gold medal in 2002. Slovakia has a total of 12,375 hockey players (0.23% of the population).\nHistory.\nThe Slovak national team was created after Czechoslovakia was split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia. For years, the Czechs kept control over how the Czechoslovakian national team was run, and limited how many Slovak players were on the team. When the country became two, the Czech Republic team was allowed to compete at the highest pool (A), and the IIHF ruled that because fewer players of the former Czechoslovak team were Slovaks, Slovakia have to start international play in pool C, the lowest group. However, Slovakia's play in the lower pools won it promotion to pool A by 1996.\n2002 Gold Medallists.\nGoalies:\nJ\u00e1n La\u0161\u00e1k,\nRastislav Sta\u0148a,\nMiroslav \u0160imonovi\u010d.\nDefensemen: \nJergu\u0161 Ba\u010da,\nLadislav \u010cierny,\nRadoslav Hecl,\nRichard Lintner,\nDu\u0161an Milo,\nPeter Smrek,\nMartin \u0160trb\u00e1k,\n\u013dubom\u00edr Vi\u0161\u0148ovsk\u00fd.\nForwards:\n\u013dubo\u0161 Barte\u010dko,\nPeter Bondra,\nMichal Handzu\u0161,\nMiroslav Hlinka,\nLadislav Nagy,\nVladim\u00edr Orsz\u00e1gh,\n\u017digmund P\u00e1lffy,\nRastislav Pavlikovsk\u00fd,\nR\u00f3bert Petrovick\u00fd,\nPeter Pucher,\nRadovan Som\u00edk,\nJozef St\u00fcmpel,\nMiroslav \u0160atan,\nR\u00f3bert Tom\u00edk,\nMarek Uram."}

Its Ta\u00edno name was \"Baynei\".\nDuring the 17th century, the island was an important centre for Caribbean piracy where pirates traded their stolen goods from ships and towns and stayed for days before going out to try to capture other ships.\nGeography.\nIn geology, it is considered as the western end of the region of the Cordillera Septentrional (\"Northern mountain range\") of the Hispaniola island, even if Tortuga Island is separated from the main island.\nTortuga Island is separated of the north coast of Haiti by an 8.9 to 15 km strait called the \"Canal de la Tortue\" (\"La Tortue Channel\"). The island is 37.5\u00a0km long and about 7\u00a0km wide, with an area of 193 km\u00b2. There are not high mountains but most of the land is between 240 and 300 metres high; the highest point is \"Morne La Visite\" (340 m).\nThe island is a \"commune\" (like municipality), in the Nord Department. It is part of the Port-de-Paix \"arrondissement\", part of a department like a district.\nPopulation.\nIn 2004, there were 30,000 people living in the Tortuga Island. There are only small towns; Aux Palmistes, in the southeast, is the biggest town in the island.\nHistory.\nChristopher Columbus saw this island on 6 December 1492 and visited it on 14 December. He called the island \"La Tortuga\", Spanish for \"The Turtle\", because it has the shape, when seen from the sea, of a turtle.\nSpanish people were not interested in Tortuga Island because they were trying to form a colony in the big Hispaniola island. And so this island was without people for most of the 16th century.\nPeople from different European countries, mainly from England, came to live in this island. In 1625, French people came to this island from the Saint Kitts island. They lived on the southern part of the island where there are flat lands and tried to grow some crops like tobacco. They also went to Hispaniola, which they called \"la Grande Terre\" (\"the Big Land\") to hunt wild cows and pigs and, because they used a Ta\u00edno cooking technique with smoke known as \"boucan\", they were known as \"boucaniers\" (\"buccaneers\"). They sold the smoked meat and leather (dry skin used to make footwear and clothing) to those ships that came to the island.\nThe Spanish tried to get those people out of the island and they invaded the island several times but each time they went back to the Hispaniola and the Tortuga Island was taken again.\nIn 1640 a French engineer named Jean La Vasseur was sent to govern Tortuga. He built Fort de Rocher [1640]. La Vasseur opened the port to outlaws of all nations.\nFrom Tortuga Island, people began to move to the northern part of the Hispaniola, mainly in the areas around the big plains, founding towns such as Port-de-Paix (1665), Cap-Fran\u00e7ais (1670) and Fort-Dauphin (1731). Then Tortuga Island lost its importance and very few people have lived here after those years, including today.\nTourism.\nThere is several good beaches in Tortuga Island; Point Saline, at the western tip, is considered by many to be the best beach of the island.\nAt Basse-Terre, on the southeastern coast, there are still some rests of the \"Fort de la Roche\" built in 1630 by the French.\nThere are several interesting caves such as \"La Grotte au Bassin\", \"La Grotte de la Galerie\" and others."}

Chord voicings, that is the choice of individual notes in the chord, can be changed for many different purposes and playing styles. \nThe guitar is very capable and useful for playing chords; but it does have some differences with other instruments. Most guitars only have six strings. This means that for the very largest of chord-voicings it is often necessary to not use one or more tones from the chord. The layout of notes on the fretboard sometimes means that the notes in a chord are not played in tonal order, or make possible a chord that is composed of more than one note of the same pitch. Many chords can be played with the same notes in more than one place on the fretboard.\nGuitars can vary both in the number of strings they have. They can also be tuned differently. Most guitars used in popular music have six-strings and are tuned : E-A-D-G-B-E. Usually the string with the highest pitch (the thinnest) is called the first string, and the string having the lowest pitch (the thickest) is called the sixth."}

It brings together genetics, evolution, natural selection, breeding, statistics and mathematics. Mathematical and computer models are produced, and field research is done to test the models.\nA brief history.\nStarting, perhaps, with G. Udny Yule's paper in 1902, population theorists tackled key issues in genetics and evolution. G.H. Hardy and Wilhelm Weinberg showed that if a population had random mating, no selection, migration or mutation, then the proportion of alleles would remain the same generation after generation. This was the Hardy\u2013Weinberg law, the first great result of this new field of research.\nPopulation genetics made great progress from 1918 to 1937. During this period, Ronald Fisher, J.B.S. Haldane and Sewall Wright worked on the connection between evolution and genetics, using new mathematical techniques, such as statistical probability. E.B. Ford and Theodosius Dobzhansky did field research on the genetics of natural populations of lepidoptera and \"Drosophila\", respectively. Broadly speaking, this work proved that the newly rediscovered Mendelian genetics could be reconciled with Darwinian evolution. This laid the groundwork for the modern evolutionary synthesis, which took place in the following years, from about 1937 to 1953.\nIn the second half of the 20th century, population geneticists tackled a range of complex evolutionary problems, such as the evolution of sex, sexual selection, kin selection (altruism), mimicry and molecular evolution. The key figures included John Maynard Smith, Motoo Kimura and William Hamilton. Techniques developed for population genetics help to decide what contribution heredity and environment make in developmental biology.\nGenetic hitch-hiking and selective sweep.\nThese concepts apply when a mutation is strongly favoured and \"pulls along\" nearby genes on its chromosome. The genes pulled along are genes which are previously under little selection. In a selective sweep, positive selection causes the new mutation to reach \"fixation\" (be the only allele present at that locus in all members of the population) so quickly that linked alleles can \"hitchhike\" and also become fixed. Evidence is growing that this effect does happen."}

Sometimes Weinberg's name is placed first. \nThe law is a foundation of population genetics, and it is still taught to students today. It states that the proportions of alleles of all genes in any population will remain the same unless perturbed (disturbed). That applies to all loci on all chromosomes in the population. Possible perturbations are:\nIt follows that any systematic change in the frequency of alleles in a population \"must\" be due to the effect of one or more of these causes. Of course, like all aspects of Mendelian inheritance, the expected proportions of alleles are probabilities. It was for that reason that statistical tests of significance, such as standard errors, were developed.\nAlthough all changes must be due to perturbations, not all perturbations lead to changes. The classic case is balancing selection, such as heterozygote advantage: \"Heterosis: the heterozygote at a locus is fitter than either homozygote\". Balancing selection leads to an equilibrium population with Hardy\u2013Weinberg proportions\nGeneralisation.\nThe law permits the prediction of genotype frequencies from a knowledge of gene frequencies. \nThus, equations can be written in terms of allele frequencies, and hypotheses about how phenotypes are inherited can be tested from population data.

He was a obstetrician and gynecologist, practising in Stuttgart. In 1908, he expressed the principle which would later come to be known as the Hardy\u2013Weinberg law. Weinberg is also credited as the first to explain the effect of ascertainment bias on observations in genetics.\nLife.\nWeinberg was born in Stuttgart and studied medicine at T\u00fcbingen and Munich, receiving an M.D. in 1886. He returned to Stuttgart in 1889, where he remained running a large practice as a gynecologist and obstetrician until he retired to T\u00fcbingen a few years before his death in 1937. Much of his academic life was spent studying genetics, especially on applying the laws of inheritance in populations.\nHardy\u2013Weinberg law.\nWeinberg developed the principle of genetic equilibrium independently of British mathematician G.H. Hardy. He delivered an exposition of his ideas in a lecture on 13 January 1908, about six months before Hardy's paper was published in English. His lecture was printed later that year in the society's yearbook. \nWeinberg's contributions were unrecognized in the English speaking world for more than 35 years. Curt Stern, a German geneticist who emigrated to the United States before World War II, pointed out in a brief paper in \"Science\" that Weinberg's exposition was both earlier and more comprehensive than Hardy's.\nAscertainment bias.\nWeinberg pioneered studies of twins, and developed techniques to analyse phenotypic variation. His aim was to partition this variance into genetic and environmental components. In the process, he recognized that ascertainment bias was affecting many of his calculations, and he produced methods to correct for it. \nWeinberg observed that proportions of homozygotes in familial studies of classic recessive genetic diseases generally exceed the expected Mendelian ratio of 1:4, and he explained how this is the result of ascertainment bias. In his work with albino children, he recognized that in some families where both parents carry a recessive mutation, by chance no albino child occurs. He reasoned that many carrier couples were not being counted, and he demonstrated methods for correcting results to produce the expected Mendelian ratios. \nHe discovered the answer to several seeming paradoxes caused by ascertainment bias. For example, he explained that the reason that parents as a whole are more fertile than their children is because children must necessarily come from fertile parents. \nBy the same token, he recognized that ascertainment was responsible for a phenomenon known as \"genetic anticipation\", the tendency for a genetic disease to manifest earlier in life and with increased severity in later generations. Weinberg recognized that this was because those later generations were the offspring of that selected group of earlier carriers that had successfully reproduced.\nAdditional contributions by Weinberg to statistical genetics included the first estimate of the rate of twinning. Realizing that identical twins would have to be the same sex, while non-identical twins could be either same or opposite sex, Weinberg derived the formula for estimating the frequency of MZ and DZ twins from the ratio of same and opposite sex twins to the total of maternities. Weinberg also estimated that the heritability of twinning itself was close to zero."}

Each team can select a captain, who has the \"sole privilege of discussing with the Referee any questions relating to interpretation of rules which may arise during the progress of a game\". Each team is also allowed to pick alternate captains, who work when the captain is not on the ice. Captains have to wear the letter \"C\" on their uniform to show who they are; alternate captains wear the letter \"A\". Both letters are in height.\nSome teams in the NHL do not have a captain. Rule 6.2 of the 2008\u201309 Official NHL Rulebook says that \"[only] when the Captain is not in uniform, the Coach shall have the right to designate three Alternate Captains. This must be done prior to the start of the game.\" Many NHL teams with a captain select more than two alternate captains and change who wears the \"A\" for different games during the season.\nGoaltenders are not allowed to be captains during games. This rule was made in 1948 after teams did not like that it took Montreal Canadiens goaltender Bill Durnan too long to skate to talk with the officials and back to his crease. However, Vancouver Canucks goaltender Roberto Luongo was the team's captain, but because of the NHL rule against goaltender captains, the league did not allow Luongo to act as captain on-ice. Because of this, the Canucks were allowed to have three alternate captains in games, instead of two that most teams have. Two (of the three) alternate captains took care of Luongo's on-ice work: Willie Mitchell (then alternate captain) talked to the officials. Luongo was not allowed to wear the \"C\" on his jersey, but it was part of the artwork on the front of his mask. Other than Durnan and Luongo, five other goaltenders have been captain o their team: John Ross Roach of the Toronto St. Patricks, George Hainsworth of the Montreal Canadiens, Roy Worters of the New York Americans, Alex Connell of the Ottawa Senators, and Charlie Gardiner of the Chicago Black Hawks.\nWhen Connor McDavid was named captain of the Edmonton Oilers, he became the youngest permanent captain in NHL history. Gabriel Landeskog of the Colorado Avalanche and Sidney Crosby of the Pittsburgh Penguins, are the second- and third-youngest players to be named captain in NHL history, respectively. In 1984, Brian Bellows was named interim captain of the Minnesota North Stars when Craig Hartsburg was injured, and is the youngest player to captain a team in NHL history. However, because Bellows served only on an interim basis, McDavid retains the distinction of being the youngest permanent captain in the League's history. Mark Messier is the only player to captain two separate teams to Stanley Cup championships, those being the 1990Edmonton Oilers and the 1994 New York Rangers. Sidney Crosby also became the youngest captain to win the Stanley Cup with the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2009. The oldest permanent captain in league history was Mark Messier of the New York Rangers, who turned 43 years old, during his last NHL season, 2003\u201304. The longest tenure in league history was Steve Yzerman of the Detroit Red Wings, who served as captain of the Red Wings for (nineteen seasons) twenty years.\nKey.\n Spent entire NHL career with team\nCaptains.\nTwenty-six of the thirty-one NHL teams currently have a captain. The five teams without a captain are the Detroit Red Wings, New Jersey Devils, New York Rangers, Ottawa Senators, and the Vegas Golden Knights. Of the twenty-six captains, twenty of them have been with their team for their entire career. The current longest-tenured captain in the League is Sidney Crosby of the Pittsburgh Penguins, who has served in the role since May 31, 2007.\nAlternate captains.\nThirty of the thirty-one NHL teams have named at least the regulation two alternate captains. The one team having less than the regulation two named alternate captains is the Buffalo Sabres. Of the eighty alternate captains, forty-nine of them have been with their team for entire career. Teams that have named more than the regulation two alternate captains, excluding those without a captain, are required to rotate the two \"A\"s between those players by methods of their choosing. The current longest-tenured alternate captain in the League is Evgeni Malkin of the Pittsburgh Penguins, who has served in the role since October 3, 2008."}

They are small monkeys, well suited to living in trees. In fact, they rarely come down to the ground. These monkeys move quickly through trees by swinging and jumping from branch to branch.\nSpider monkeys are found in rainforests in southern Mexico to the northern part of South America. Spider monkeys live in groups or bands of 10 to 40 monkeys. Every band lives in its own territory and one band of monkeys will not enter the territory of another band. Spider monkeys have one offspring per year. They live between 20 to 27 years, or more.\nDiet.\nSpider monkeys eat fruit, nuts, leaves, and small eggs.\nUsually the leader female of the whole group is responsible for finding and gathering all the food for the rest of the group. When there is not enough food, they sometimes eat bark, or honey, or insects.\nPhysical description.\nSpider monkeys are extremely quick, and they have long, thin fingers with almost no hair at all. Unlike other monkeys, they use their tail much more than their fingers, and their tails are longer than their bodies. These tails can grasp and pick things up.\nThey have long, spindly limbs, which explains the spider monkey's common name. Their tails are fully prehensile, meaning they can pick things up with it, and they can swing from it. The tail, which may be up to long, is very flexible, with hairless tips and skin grooves similar to fingerprints. This adaptation to their strictly arboreal lifestyle serves as a fifth hand. They are clumsy on the ground."}

It is used in biology to contrast with research done in the laboratory.\nField research is defined as a qualitative method of data collection that aims to observe, interact and understand people while they are in a natural environment. For example, nature conservationists observe behavior of animals in their natural surroundings and the way they react to certain scenarios. In the same way, social scientists conducting field research may conduct interviews or observe people from a distance to understand how they behave in a social environment and how they react to situations around them.\nField research encompasses a diverse range of social research methods including direct observation, limited participation, analysis of documents and other information, informal interviews, surveys etc. Although field research is generally characterized as qualitative research, it often involves multiple aspects of quantitative research in it.\nField research typically begins in a specific setting although the end objective of the study is to observe and analyze the specific behavior of a subject in that setting. The cause and effect of a certain behavior, though, is tough to analyze due to presence of multiple variables in a natural environment. Most of the data collection is based not entirely on cause and effect but mostly on correlation. While field research looks for correlation, the small sample size makes it difficult to establish a causal relationship between two or more variables.\nMethods of Field research.\nField research is typically conducted in 5 distinctive methods. They are:\nIn this method, the data is collected via an observational method or subjects in a natural environment. In this method, the behavior or outcome of situation is not interfered in any way by the researcher. The advantage of direct observation is that it offers contextual data on people, situations, interactions and the surroundings. This method of field research is widely used in a public setting or environment but not in a private environment as it raises an ethical dilemma.\nIn this method of field research, the researcher is deeply involved in the research process, not just purely as an observer, but also as a participant. This method too is conducted in a natural environment but the only difference is the researcher gets involved in the discussions and can mould the direction of the discussions. In this method, researchers live in a comfortable environment with the participants of the research, to make them comfortable and open up to in-depth discussions.\nEthnography is an expanded observation of social research and social perspective and the cultural values of an \u00a0entire social setting. In ethnography, entire communities are observed objectively. For example, \u00a0if a researcher would like to understand how an Amazon tribe lives their life and operates, he/she may chose to observe them or live amongst them and silently observe their day-to-day behavior.\nQualitative interviews are close-ended questions that are asked directly to the research subjects. The qualitative interviews could be either informal and conversational, semi-structured, standardized and open-ended or a mix of all the above three. This provides a wealth of data to the researcher that they can sort through. This also helps collect relational data. This method of field research can use a mix of one-on-one interviews, focus groups and text analysis.\nA case study research is an in-depth analysis of a person, situation or event. This method may look difficult to operate, however, it is one of the simplest ways of conducting research as it involves a deep dive and thorough understanding the data collection methods and inferring the data."}

Ford", "text": "Edmund Brisco Ford FRS (23 April 1901 \u2013 2 January 1988) was a British ecological geneticist. He was a leader among those British biologists who investigated the role of natural selection in nature. As a schoolboy Ford became interested in lepidoptera, the group of insects which includes butterflies and moths. He went on to study the genetics of natural populations, and invented the field of \"ecological genetics\". Ford was awarded the Royal Society's Darwin Medal in 1954. Later, in 1968, he was awarded UNESCO's Kalinga Prize for the popularisation of science.\nCareer.\nSpecialising in genetics, he was appointed Oxford University Reader in Genetics in 1939 and was the Director of the Genetics Laboratory, 1952\u20131969, and Professor of Ecological Genetics 1963\u20131969. Ford was one of the first scientists to be elected a Fellow of All Souls College since the seventeenth century. \nFord had a long working relationship with R.A. Fisher. By the time Ford had developed his formal definition of genetic polymorphism, Fisher had got accustomed to high selection values in nature. He was most impressed by the fact that polymorphism concealed powerful selective forces (Ford gave human blood types as an example). Like Fisher, he continued the natural selection versus genetic drift debate with Sewall Wright, whom Ford believed put too much emphasis on genetic drift. It was as a result of Ford's work, as well as his own, that Dobzhansky changed the emphasis in the third edition of his famous text from drift to selection.\nFord predicted that human blood group polymorphisms might be maintained in the population by providing some protection against disease. Six years after this prediction it was found to be so, and furthermore, heterozygous advantage was decisively established by a study of AB x AB crosses. His magnum opus was \"Ecological genetics\", which ran to four editions and was widely influential. He laid much of the groundwork for subsequent studies in this field, and was invited as a consultant to help set up similar research groups in several other countries.\nAmongst Ford's many publications, perhaps the most popularly successful was the first book in the \"New Naturalist\" series, \"Butterflies\". Ford also went on in 1955 to write \"Moths\" in the same series, one of only a few to have authored more than one book in the series.\nEcological genetics.\nE.B. Ford worked for many years on genetic polymorphism. Polymorphism in natural populations is frequent; the key feature is the occurrence together of two or more discontinuous forms of a species in some kind of balance. So long as the proportions of each form is above mutation rate, then selection must be the cause. As early as 1930 Fisher had discussed a situation where, with alleles at a single locus, the heterozygote is more viable than either homozygote. That is a typical genetic mechanism for causing this type of polymorphism. The work involves a synthesis of field research, taxonomy, and laboratory genetics."}

Official terms in successor states of the Soviet Union differ, the majority (except Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and the Baltics) still use a cognate of the Russian term, e.g. voblast (voblasts, voblasts' , ) is used for provinces of Belarus, and oblys (plural: oblystar) for provinces of Kazakhstan.\nOblasts of Bulgaria.\nSince 1997, Bulgaria has been divided into 28 \"oblasti\", usually translated as \"provinces\". Before, the country was divided into nine bigger units, also called \"oblast\".\nOblasts of Ukraine.\nUkraine is divided into 24 oblasts.\nOblasts of Byelorussia.\nByelorussia is divided into 6 oblasts.\nOblasts of the Russian Empire.\nIn the Russian Empire, oblasts were considered to be administrative units and were included as parts of Governorates General or krais.

As any administrative units of this level, oblasts were composed of districts (\"raions\") and cities/towns directly under oblasts' jurisdiction. \nThe names of oblasts did not usually correspond to the names of the historical regions, as they were created as purely administrative units. With a few exceptions, Soviet oblasts were named after their administrative centers.\nTerms used to describe oblasts in post-Soviet countries.\nThe oblasts in other post-Soviet countries are officially called:\n\"Viloyat\" and \"welayat\" come from the Arabic language term \"wil\u0101ya\" (\u0648\u0644\u0627\u064a\u0629)\nOblasts of Russia.\nAccording to the Constitution of Russia, oblasts are considered to be subjects of the Federation, which is a higher status than that of administrative units they had within the Soviet Union. The federal subject status gives the oblasts some degree of autonomy and gives them representation in the Federation Council.\nOblasts of Yugoslavia.\nOblasts were administrative units of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes between 1922 and 1929. During that period, the country was divided into 33\u00a0oblasts. In 1929, oblasts were replaced with larger administrative units known as \"banovinas\".\nDuring the Wars] that split Yugoslavia several Serbian Autonomous Oblasts were formed in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.

{"id": "215467", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=215467", "title": "Swahili people", "text": "The Swahili are a people and culture found on the East coast of Africa, mainly the coastal regions and the islands of Kenya and Tanzania, and north Mozambique. The Swahili number is at around 1,328,000. The number of Swahili speakers, on the other hand, numbers at around 90 million people. The name \"Swahili\" comes from the Arabic word \"Sawahil\" and means \"coastal dwellers\". Swahili is official language only in Tanzania. Swahili speakers who live elsewhere in East Africa also have to use the official languages of their respective countries: English in Kenya, Portuguese in Mozambique, and French in Comoros. Only a small part of those who use Swahili are first language speakers and even fewer are ethnic Swahilis. This point is often obscured by the Swahili linguistic tradition in which those who speak the language are often called Swahili (Waswahili) regardless of their actual ethnic origins. In other words, the term 'Swahili' can mean 'those who speak Swahili' or it can mean 'ethnic Swahili people'.\nDefinition.\nThe Swahili are unique Bantu inhabitants of the East African Coast mainly from Kenya, Tanzania, and Mozambique. They are mainly united by culture and under the mother tongue of Kiswahili, a Bantu language. There are Arab, Persian, and other migrants who reached the coast some believe as early as the 7th-8th c. CE, and mixed with the local people there, that are regarded as Swahili now. Because of this influence the Swahili language contains many loan words from Arabic and Persian. Archaeologist, Felix Chami thinks that Bantu settlements at the East African coast existed already at the beginning of the 1st millennium. From the 6th century onward they became more important as there was an increase in trade (mainly with Arab merchants), population growth, and further centralized urbanization. So the Swahili City-States developed.\nReligion.\nIslam came to the East African coast around 1012 AD, when the traders from the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Peninsula continued to journey to these parts during monsoon seasons and to have contact with the local people through trade, marriage, and an exchange of ideas. Because of this interaction, most of the Swahili today are Muslim. The Swahili follow a very strict and orthodox form of Islam.\nEconomy.\nFor centuries the Swahili depended greatly on trade from the Indian Ocean. The Swahili have played a vital role as middle man between east, central and South Africa, and the outside world. Trade contacts have been noted as early as 100 A.D. by early Roman writers who visited the East African coast in the first century. Trade routes extended across Tanzania into modern day Zaire. Along these goods were brought to the coasts and were sold to Arab, Indian, and Portuguese traders and even reached as far as China and India. Materials of this trade were also found at Great Zimbabwe. During the Middle Ages, ivory and slaves became a substantial source of income. Many slaves who were sold in Zanzibar ended up in Brazil, which was then a Portuguese colony. Swahili fishermen of today still rely on the ocean to supply their primary source of income. Fish is sold to their inland neighbors in exchange for products of the interior."}

{"id": "215472", "revid": "7411627", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=215472", "title": "Tudor period", "text": "The Tudor period usually refers to the period between 1485 and 1603, specifically in relation to the history of England. This was the period when the Tudor dynasty ruled in England. Its first monarch was Henry VII (1457\u2013 1509). The term is often used more broadly to include Elizabeth I's reign (1558\u2013 1603), although this is often treated separately as the Elizabethan era.\nFollowing the Black Death and the agricultural depression of the late 14th century, population grew bigger again. The export of woollen products to mainland Europe helped the economy rather much. Henry VII got favourable trading conditions in 1496.\nThe high wages and abundance of available land seen in the late 14th century and early 15th century were replaced with low wages and a land shortage. Various inflationary pressures, perhaps due to influx of New World gold and rising population, meant that the gap between the rich and poor widened. This was a period of significant change for the majority of the rural population, because enclosure started.\nFinancial Development of Tudor Government, 1536-53.\nImpact of Dissolution\nThe Tudor Government raised a huge amount of revenue from the dissolution of the monasteries. The clerical income from First Fruits and Tenths, which previously went to the Pope, now went to the King.\nPartly because of the new revenue raised from the dissolution of monasteries, Cromwell created revenue courts to allot the royal income properly to various departments. These were the six courts or departments of state, each fully organised with its own specialised officials, with seals and habitat, and responsible for a particular kind of revenue.\nThe Role of Winchester\nThe growing number of departments meant that the number of officials involved increased, which made the management of revenue troublesome and expensive. There were further financial and administrative difficulties of the years 1540-58.\nImpact of War\nHenry\u2019s war with France and Somerset\u2019s war with France and Scotland cost England huge sums of money. The royal Mint was used to generate revenue by producing coins with less quality.\nSignificant events of the period.\nBattle of Stoke (1487).\nIn 1487 Henry VII's enemies from the House of York had crowned a pretender and landed a small army off the coast of Cumbria with the intention of stealing the crown. Henry VII defeated them at East Stoke. This was perhaps the last battle in the Wars of the Roses.\nEnglish Reformation.\nThis was perhaps the most significant series of events which took place during the Tudor period. It began as a result of Henry VIII's quarrel with Pope Clement VII regarding his refusal to grant a divorce.\nNorfolk Rebellion (1549).\nBeginning in 1549, this was to be the largest popular uprising during the Tudor period. It was at first intended as a demonstration against enclosures of common land. The leader, Robert Kett, was hanged for treason.\nLife.\nPoverty.\nAbout a third of the population lived in poverty with the wealthy expected to give alms to assist the impotent poor. Tudor law was harsh on those unable to find work. Those who left their parishes in order to find work were called vagabonds and could be punished by whipping.\nThe idea of the workhouse was first suggested in 1576.\nHealth.\nAverage life span was 35. This was because of the poor amount of medicines and doctors at the time. High rates of childhood mortality saw only 33-50% of the population reaching the age of 16.\nAlthough home to only a small part of the population the Tudor municipalities were overcrowded and unhygenic. Most municipalities were unpaved although this differed in larger towns and cities.\nThere were no sewers or drains and rubbish was simply abandoned in the street. Animals such as rats thrived in these conditions. In larger towns and cities, such as London, common diseases arising from lack of sanitation included smallpox, measles, malaria, typhus, diphtheria, Scarlet fever, and chickenpox.\nOutbreaks of the Black Death pandemic occurred in 1498, 1535, 1543, 1563, 1589 and 1603. The reason for the speedy spread of the disease was the increase of rats infected by fleas carrying the disease.\nFood and diet.\nThe food consumed by the dinvery rich in this period consisted largely of venison, and often of blackbirds and larks. Fruits and vegetables were only eaten by Tudors when it was in season. However, potatoes had not reached the table to any great extent, because farmers had only just begun growing them, although explorers such as Sir Walter Raleigh had brought them to Britain.\nHomes and dwellings.\nThe majority of the population lived in small villages. Their homes comprised, as in earlier centuries, of thatched huts with one or two rooms. Furniture was basic with stools being commonplace rather than chairs.\nMansions had many chimneys for the many fireplaces required to keep the vast rooms warm. These fires were also the only way of cooking food. The very large houses were often, designed in symmetrical shapes such as 'E' and 'H'.\nEducation.\nPoorer children never went to school. Children from better-off families had tutors to teach them reading and French. However, boys were often sent to schools which belonged to the monasteries and there they would learn mainly Latin in classes of up to 60 boys. Schools were harsh and caning was not unheard of.\nPastimes.\nThe rich used to go hunting to kill deer and wild boar for their feasts. They also enjoyed fencing and jousting contests. Most rich people watched bear fighting.\nFashion.\nIn the Tudor times fashion was a display of how wealthy you were. Wealthy people \u2014 such as royalty \u2014 could afford to have clothes made out of fine linen or silk. These outfits cost hundreds and hundreds of pounds. They would also have them embroidered with gold thread and very sparkly and expensive jewels.Ladies had to wear corsets which were made out of bone and they were ever so tight and made your stomach and waist smaller so you looked skinnier. Poorer people would wear simple clothes made from wool, tunic and trousers for men, and a long dress worn with an apron on top for poor women.\nMonarchs.\nThe House of Tudor produced five English monarchs who ruled during this period.\nReferences.\nHarrington, Peter.

In pleiotropism, a single gene affects a number of phenotypic traits in the same organism. \nThese pleiotropic effects often seem to be unrelated to each other. The usual underlying mechanism is that the same gene is activated in several different tissues, producing apparently different effects. It follows that the phenomenon must be extremely common, since most genes will have effects in more than one tissue. \nThe term may be contrasted with pleiomorphism, in which a genetically uniform group of organisms shows variable phenotypes.\nEvolutionary implications.\nPleiotropy has significance for the theory of evolution. It has often been claimed that some heritable features of animals are not the product of adaptation by natural selection. Much of this may be explained by pleiotropism. Strong selection for one or two aspects of gene function will automatically bring along some other pleiotropic traits. These other traits, though inherited, may be neutral or even slightly deleterious in terms of selection.\n\"Antagonistic pleiotropy\" refers to the expression of a gene resulting in multiple competing effects, some beneficial but others detrimental to the organism. Three circumstances are possible:\n1. Simultaneously, a gene may cause deleterious traits which are outbalanced by the survival value of positive traits.\n2. A gene may increase fitness in the younger, fertile organism, yet contribute to decreased fitness later in life. The reproductive contribution at the younger stages of life will ensure the spread of such a gene.\n3. A gene may increase fitness in some habitats, but not others. Its survival in the population is then balanced. An example is a bacterial gene which enhances glucose use at the expense of the ability to use other energy sources (such as lactose). This has positive effects when there is plenty of glucose, but can be lethal if lactose is the only available food source."}

{"id": "215676", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=215676", "title": "Altruism", "text": "Altruism (or selflessness) is concern for the well-being of others. A truly altruistic act is something done completely for the benefit of another, without concern for the self. It usually involves sacrificing something (time, effort or possessions), with no expectation of receiving anything in return (including recognition for the act of giving). It is considered a virtue in many cultures and a basic aspect of most religions. It is the opposite of selfishness.\nAltruism is different from acts done out of responsibility, loyalty or moral obligation towards a specific individual (such as a god, a king or a government). Whether \"pure\" altruism is possible has been debated by scholars for thousands of years. One theory says that no act of giving, helping or sacrificing can be described as truly selfless, because the person will receive personal gratification from it (that is, a feeling of satisfaction that they have done something good for another). Whether this theory is correct depends on whether such feelings qualify as a 'reward' or 'benefit'.\nThe word \"altruism\" was given by the French philosopher Auguste Comte in French, as \"altruisme\", for an antonym of egoism. He derived it from the Italian \"altrui\", which in turn was derived from Latin \"alteri\", meaning \"other people\" or \"somebody else\".\nAltruism in biological observations in field populations of the day organisms is an individual performing an action which is at a cost to themselves (e.g., pleasure and quality of life, time, probability of survival or reproduction), but benefits, either directly or indirectly, another individual, without the expectation of reciprocity or compensation for that action. Steinberg suggests a definition for altruism in the clinical setting, that is \"intentional and voluntary actions that aim to enhance the welfare of another person in the absence of any quid pro quo external rewards\". In one sense, the opposite of altruism is spite; a spiteful action harms another with no self-benefit.\nThe concept of altruism has long been studied in philosophy and ethics. The term was originally used in the 19th century by sociologist and philosopher of science, Auguste Comte. It has become an important topic for psychologists (especially those that study evolutionary psychology), evolutionary biologists and ethologists. The scholars of each field have developed different ideas about altruism. All agree that altruism is caring about the welfare of other people and acting to help them.\nEvolutionary psychology.\nIn the study of animal behaviour, altruism is seen in social animals when an individual willingly sacrifices itself for the better survival of the group. There are several theories about how this behaviour has come about under evolution by natural selection.\nThese theories try to explain how evolution has shaped psychological mechanisms, such as emotions, that encourage altruistic behaviour. \nIn religion.\nMost, if not all, of the world's religions promote selflessness as a very important moral value. It forms part of the central philosophies of Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Jainism, Judaism and Sikhism, as well as many other religions.\nBuddhism teaches love and compassion for all forms of life (ahimsa). Love is the wish that all beings be happy, and compassion is the wish that all beings be free from suffering. It considers all living things to be equal. Unlike most other religions, Buddhists believe that the consequences of our actions come not from punishments based on moral judgment, but from the law of karma (\"kamma\"). Karma is the natural law of cause and effect. In this law, we experience the effects of what we cause: if you cause suffering, then as a natural consequence you will experience suffering; if you cause happiness, then as a natural consequence you will experience happiness. Most types of karmas, with good or bad results, will keep one in the wheel of sams\u0101ra; others will liberate one to nirv\u0101na.\nIn Sufism, the idea of \"\u012bth\u0101r\" (selflessness) is defined as preferring others over yourself. For Sufis, this means devotion to others and completely forgetting concern for oneself. It teaches sacrifice for the sake of the greater good. Islam considers those practicing \"\u012bth\u0101r\" as abiding by the highest degree of virtue. In \"\u012bth\u0101r\", attention is focused on everything that exists except for the self."}

The term may also be used for an estimate (good guess) of that standard deviation taken from a sample of the whole group.\nThe average of some part of a group (called a sample) is the usual way to estimate the average for the whole group. It is often too hard or too costly to measure the whole group. But if a different sample is measured, it will have an average that is a little bit different from the first sample. The standard error of the mean is a way to know how close the average of the sample is to the average of the whole group. It is a way of knowing how sure one can be about the average from the sample.\nIn real measurements, the true value of the standard deviation of the mean for the whole group is usually not known. So the term \"standard error\" is often used to mean a close guess to the true number for the whole group. The more measurements there are in a sample, the closer the guess will be to the true number for the whole group.\nHow to find standard error of the mean.\nOne way to find the standard error of the mean is to have lots of samples. First, the average for each sample is found. Then the average and standard deviation of those sample averages is found. The standard deviation for all the sample averages is the standard error of the mean. This can be a lot of work. Sometimes it is too difficult or costly to have lots of samples.\nAnother way to find the standard error of the mean is to use an equation that needs only one sample. Standard error of the mean is usually estimated by the standard deviation for a sample from the whole group (sample standard deviation), divided by the square root of the sample size:\nwhere\nIn general, the larger the sample, the closer the estimated standard error of the mean is to the actual standard error of the mean. As a rule of thumb, there should be at least six measurements in a sample. Then the standard error of the mean for the sample will be within 5% of the actual standard error of the mean (that is, if the whole group were measured).\nCorrections for some cases.\nThere is another equation to use if the number of measurements is for 5% or more of the whole group:\nThere are special equations to use if a sample has less than 20 measurements.\nSometimes, a sample may come from one place even though the whole group may be spread out, while other times, a sample may be made in a short time period when the whole group covers a longer time. In which case, the numbers in the sample are not independent, and special equations are used to try to correct for this.\nUsefulness.\n\"A practical result:\" One can become more sure of an average value by having more measurements in a sample. Then the standard error of the mean will be smaller because the standard deviation is divided by a bigger number. However, to make the uncertainty (standard error of the mean) in an average value half as big, the sample size (n) needs to be four times bigger. This is because the standard deviation is divided by the square root of the sample size. To make the uncertainty one-tenth as big, the sample size (n) needs to be one hundred times bigger.\nStandard errors are easy to calculate and commonly used because:\nRelative standard error.\nThe relative standard error (RSE) is the standard error divided by the average. This number is smaller than one. Multiplying it by 100% gives it as a percentage of the average. This helps to show whether the uncertainty is important or not. \nFor example, consider two surveys of household income that both result in a sample average of $50,000. If one survey has a standard error of $10,000 and the other has a standard error of $5,000, then the relative standard errors are 20% and 10%, respectively. The survey with the lower relative standard error is better, because it has a more precise measurement (the uncertainty is smaller).\nIn fact, people who need to know average values often decide how small the uncertainty should be\u2014before they decide to use the information. For example, the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics does not report an average if the relative standard error exceeds 30%. NCHS also requires at least 30 observations for an estimate to be reported.\nExample.\nFor example, there are many redfish in the water of the Gulf of Mexico. To find out how much a 42\u00a0cm long redfish weighs on average, it is not possible to measure all of the redfish that are 42\u00a0cm long. Instead, it is possible to measure some of them. The fish that are actually measured are called a sample. The table shows weights for two samples of redfish, all 42\u00a0cm long. The average (mean) weight of the first sample is 0.741\u00a0kg. The average (mean) weight of the second sample is 0.735\u00a0kg\u2014a little bit different from the first sample. Each of these averages is a little bit different from the average that would come from measuring every 42\u00a0cm long redfish (which is not possible anyway).\nThe uncertainty in the mean can be used to know how close the average of the samples are to the average that would come from measuring the whole group. The uncertainty in the mean is estimated as the standard deviation for the sample, divided by the square root of the number of samples minus one. The table shows that the uncertainties in the means for the two samples are very close to each other. Also, the relative uncertainty is the uncertainty in the mean divided by the mean, times 100%. The relative uncertainty in this example is 2.38% and 2.50% for the two samples.\nKnowing the uncertainty in the mean, one can know how close the sample average is to the average that would come from measuring the whole group. The average for the whole group is between a) the average for the sample plus the uncertainty in the mean, and b) the average for the sample minus the uncertainty in the mean. In this example, the average weight for all of the 42\u00a0cm long redfish in the Gulf of Mexico is expected to be 0.723\u20130.759\u00a0kg based on the first sample, and 0.717\u20130.753 based on the second sample."}

It is an increase in the number and diversity of species in each lineage. It produces more new species, and those species live in a wider range of habitats.\nSome definitions phrase it in terms of a single clade: \"Adaptive radiation is the rapid proliferation of new taxa from a single ancestral group\". However, in the most striking cases, such as occurred in the Triassic after the greatest extinction event in Earth history, many lines underwent rapid radiation simultaneously. This must have something to do with the availability of ecological niches and relative little competition.\nThe Ediacaran biota were the result of an early metazoan radiation. The greatest radiation of all took place early in the Cambrian period, when most of our animal phyla evolved: see List of animal phyla.\nWith less competition, groups diversify to fill available habitats and niches. This is an evolutionary process driven by natural selection.\nThe term was introduced and discussed by George Gaylord Simpson, the palaeontologist who contributed to the modern evolutionary synthesis. Others prefer not to use the term. Robert L Carroll prefers to use the term \"major evolutionary transitions\", though it turns out that all or most of these could also be described as adaptive radiations. Others use terms like macroevolution, or even megaevolution, as if the processes are different from those which occur below species level. It is part of evolutionary theory that all processes take place at the level of populations. All agree, though, that the speed of evolution does change, however it is measured.\nMeasurement of rates of change.\nRecords of timing are bedevilled by gaps in the fossil record, often at those crucial early stages when numbers are low and geographical distribution is severely restricted. \"In reality, there are long periods within nearly every lineage for which the fossil record remains unknown\".p297 These gaps affect our knowledge of timing, and of changes in body shape and function.\nNevertheless, when several distinctly new lines appear within a short period, it seems reasonable to say that the rate of change has been surprisingly fast. An example would be the appearance of new reptilian groups in the Upper Triassic. Using the term 'reptile' broadly, the groups include dinosaurs, pterosaurs, Chelonia (turtles), crocodylomorphs (early Crocodilia), phytosaurs, and ichthyosaurs a bit earlier (Middle Triassic).\nThese radiations occurred after the great Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event that ended the Palaeozoic era. The Triassic itself had several lesser (but still significant) extinctions. Unfortunately, the Triassic has the poorest fossil record of the whole of the Mesozoic era.\nCauses.\nInnovation.\nThe evolution of a new feature may let a group diversify because it makes possible new ways of living. A most striking example is the cleidoic egg, which developed in early amniotes, and permitted vertebrates to invade the land. The cleidoic egg must have been developed in the latest Devonian or early Carboniferous. Amphibians, who branched off before this event, still lay their eggs in water, and so are limited in the extent to which they can exploit land environments.\nAn example of a more modest innovation is the evolution of a fourth cusp in the mammalian tooth. This trait permits a vast increase in the range of foodstuffs which can be fed on. Evolution of this character has thus increased the number of ecological niches available to mammals. The trait arose a number of times in different groups during the Cenozoic, and in each instance was immediately followed by an adaptive radiation. With birds, the evolution of flight opened new possibilities, and at least two huge adaptive radiations occurred (one before and one after the K/T extinction event). Even more striking was the evolution of insect flight, which led to huge radiation in the Mesozoic era. Then, these insect groups developed ways of feeding on flowering plants. They now outnumber all other forms of animal life by quite a margin.\nOpportunity.\nAdaptive radiations often happen when organisms enter environments with unoccupied niches, such as a newly formed lake or an isolated island chain. The colonizing population(s) may diversify rapidly and take advantage of all possible niches. Opportunities occur when land bridges form between areas which were previously separate, and whenever species get to new place in the world.\nIn Lake Victoria, an isolated lake which formed recently in the African rift valley, over 300 species of cichlid fish radiated from one parent species in just 15,000 years.\nVacant islands.\nIn about , the Hawaiian Islands have the most diverse collection of drosophilid flies in the world, living from rainforests to mountain meadows. About 800 Hawaiian drosophilid species are known.\nStudies show a clear \"flow\" of species from older to newer islands. There are also cases of colonization back to older islands, and skipping of islands, but these are much less frequent. By potassium/argon radioactive dating, the present islands date from 0.4 million years ago (mya) (Mauna Kea) to 10mya (Necker). The oldest member of the Hawaiian archipelago still above the sea is Kure Atoll, which can be dated to 30 mya. The archipelago itself, produced by the Pacific plate moving over a hot spot, has existed for far longer, at least into the Cretaceous. The Hawaiian islands plus former islands which are now beneath the sea make up the Hawaiian\u2013Emperor seamount chain; and many of the underwater mountains are guyots.\nAll of the native drosophilid species in Hawaii have apparently descended from \"a single ancestral species\" that colonized the islands, about 20 million years ago. The subsequent adaptive radiation was spurred by a lack of competition and a wide variety of vacant niches. Although it would be possible for a single pregnant female to colonise an island, it is more likely to have been a group from the same species.\nThere are other animals and plants on the Hawaiian archipelago which have undergone similar, if less spectacular, adaptive radiations.\nMass extinctions.\nAdaptive radiations commonly follow mass extinctions. After an extinction event, many niches are left vacant. A classic example of this is the replacement of the non-avian dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous with mammals in the Palaeocene."}

Like type 1 diabetes, LADA is an autoimmune disease of the pancreas. This means the body's immune system attacks the cells in the pancreas that are supposed to make insulin. But LADA is also like type 2 diabetes, because it causes insulin resistance. This means that insulin does not work as well as it should in a person's body.\nMost people with latent autoimmune diabetes are thin or skinny or have a normal BMI, although some are overweight to slightly obese. \nLADA and diabetes.\nDifferences between LADA and type 1 diabetes.\nThe biggest difference between LADA and type 1 diabetes is that LADA has a gradual onset (it comes on slowly).\nAlso, people with type 1 diabetes cannot make insulin. But if they are given a shot of insulin, the insulin works and does its job in their bodies. But in people with LADA, even if they are given insulin, the insulin may not work as well as it should.\nDifferences between LADA and type 2 diabetes.\nMost people with LADA become insulin-dependent (have to inject insulin) within 3-15 years. This is very different from type 2 diabetes. Only 20%-30% of type 2 diabetics end up being insulin-dependent.\nAnother difference is that type 2 diabetes can happen to anyone at any age. But LADA does not affect children or teenagers. It usually affects people age 35 and older, but can affect anyone between 20-29 years of age.\nWith LADA, the pancreas cannot make insulin because the immune system is attacking its insulin-making cells. This does not happen in type 2 diabetes.\nContrary to popular belief, some people with LADA do have family members with type 2 diabetes.\nDiagnosis and treatment.\nPeople with LADA are sometimes misdiagnosed (diagnosed incorrectly) as having type 1 or type 2 diabetes. A special blood test can prove what kind of diabetes a person has. The test looks for an antibody that only diabetics with LADA have. It is called a GAD antibody test.\nPeople with LADA usually control their diabetes using very similar methods and changes of lifestyle to type 2 diabetes: eating right, exercising and oral medications; weight loss is optional. Unlike Type 2 diabetics who might never need to inject insulin, however, the LADA patients become insulin dependent within several years.\nComplications.\nThe complications of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults are highly similar to those for types 1 and 2 diabetes, like stroke, heart disease, gangrene, kidney trouble, and heart attacks.\nGenes and antibodies.\nThere are glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies connected with LADA. There are also TCF7L2 genes associated with Type 2 diabetes which are also connected with LADA."}

He is often called the \"Father of Modern Chemistry\". His work is an important part of the histories of chemistry and biology. It also contributed to the beginnings of atomic theory. He was the first scientist to recognise and name the elements hydrogen and oxygen. He was executed, as were hundreds of other nobles, during the French Revolution.\nEarly life.\nAntoine de Lavoisier began studying at the Coll\u00e8ge Mazarin in Paris in 1754, when he was 11 years old. Coll\u00e8ge Mazarin was one of the best secondary schools in France then. He studied to be a lawyer like his father and his grandfather. He got his degree in 1763 and practised law at the parliament; however, he really preferred scientific research to law, so he also studied chemistry, botany, astronomy, and mathematics. He got his law degree in 1763, but never practised as a lawyer. He started a career as a scientist instead.\nScience career.\nDuring his career, Lavoisier brought major changes to the study of chemistry. Much of his research was done on combustion. He is the person who explained combustion by oxidation. To prove this, Lavoisier studied the air. In order to do this, in 1776, he burned mercury in an enclosed vase. His conclusion: the air is a combination of oxygen and is not a chemical element.\nHe also discovered the law of conservation of mass that is \"nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed\". It says that the mass of the final products of a chemical reaction is the same as the reactants\u2019 ones. Today, this principle is the basis of modern chemistry.\nLavoisier, together with L. B. Guyton de Morveau, Claude-Louis Berthollet and Antoine Fran\u00e7ois de Fourcroy, created the first system of chemical nomenclature in the 1780s.\nPOLITICAL CAREER :\nWhile he was doing research for chemistry, Lavoisier was also working at the house. During this time, the French Revolution began in 1789. Antoine kept his position in the government. But, two years later, a new government arrived in power. This new government was suspicious of Lavoisier's great success as a scientific researcher and as a public administrator. He was accused of selling modified tobacco. He was arrested for conspiracy against the people. Even though there was no proof that showed that Antoine de Lavoisier broke the law, he was sentenced to death on 8 May 1794. He was executed using the guillotine."}

Simpson was perhaps the most influential paleontologist of the twentieth century, and a major participant in the modern evolutionary synthesis. \nHe was an expert on extinct mammals and their migrations, especially the Great American Interchange between the Americas. Simpson opposed Alfred Wegener's theory of continental drift, so his work on animal migration lacked this idea.\nSimpson dispelled the myth that the evolution of the horse was a linear process culminating in the modern \"Equus caballus\". He coined the word \"hypodigm\" in 1940, and published extensively on the taxonomy of fossil and living mammals.\nBiography.\nBorn in Chicago, Illinois, Simpson was raised mostly in Denver, Colorado. He got his degrees from Yale University in 1923 and 1926. His dissertation, \"American Mesozoic Mammalia\" (1929), was the first step in his lifelong interest in the evolution of mammals. After a post-doctoral year at the British Natural History Museum, Simpson returned in 1927 to take up a post in the American Museum of Natural History.\nIn 1942, Simpson enlisted in the U.S. Army. He served as a Captain, then Major, in Army intelligence, Simpson served with American forces in North Africa and western Europe until 1944. Then he resigned, suffering from a severe bout of hepatitis. He returned home, with two Bronze Stars. He was promoted to Curator (head) of the Department of Geology and Paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History. He also held a post as Professor of Zoology at Columbia University (19451959). He took up his work on early mammals, and worked on the Palaeocene and Eocene faunas of the San Juan Basin, New Mexico. \nHe was Curator of the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University from 1959 to 1970, and a Professor of Geosciences at the University of Arizona until his retirement in 1982.\nMajor works and awards.\nIn the 1940s Simpson produced three major works. \"Tempo and mode in evolution\" (1944), \"Principles of classification and a classification of mammals\" (1945) and \"The meaning of evolution\" (1949). Simpson provided a popular account of modern evolutionary theory with emphasis on evidence from the fossil record.\nSimpson was awarded the Linnean Society's Darwin-Wallace Medal in 1958. He also received the Royal Society's Darwin Medal \"In recognition of his distinguished contributions to general evolutionary theory, based on a profound study of palaeontology, particularly of vertebrates\" in 1962. He was awarded the U.S. National Medal of Science in 1965.\nQuotes.\nThese quotations from Simpson give a good idea of the man:"}

The letter consists of two parts: first a teaching section, then a second section about how to live. Some believe that the letter was needed to warn about growing heresy in the church. In both parts of the letter are warnings about false teachers who have been teaching wrong things to the people.

The \"cosmic powers\" honored by the false teachers had been defeated at Christ's death. Christ is the master of all angels and the head of the church.

They are told to think about things that are above, to kill the bad desires of their old nature, and to put on the new (Christian) person. Many special duties of the Christian life are also taught.

It includes a circle-shaped rotating platform. A carousel found in an amusement park has seats made to look like objects such as automobiles, trains and animals. Animals that can be seen on a carousel might be horses, elephants, and swans. Carousels are often brightly decorated with lights, paintings, and animals around the outside. A carousel found in an amusement park often moves by machine power. A carousel is also a common toy on a child's playgrounds. Playground carousels are not powered by a machine. The children make the carousel spin by holding on to the handle bars that are attached to the rotating platform. The child will then run in a circle while holding on to the handle bars making the merry-go-round spin. The merry-go-round found on a playground will move faster or slower depending on how fast the child runs. In this Wikipedia article, you will be able to find other words for carousel that are commonly used, a brief history about carousels, animals that may found on carousels, and the scientific principles of how machine powered carousels work.\nOther words for carousel.\nThere are many words that have been invented to talk about carousels. They originate from all over the world. Both of the terms \u201cMerry-go-round\u201d and \u201cround about\u201d came from the United Kingdom. The word \u201ccarousel,\u201d can also be spelled \"carrousel\". It is a word that came from the 17th century. The word \"carousel\" is a French word which means \"a tilting match\". This refers to the jousting game played by knights. Both \u201cmerry-go-round\u201d and \u201ccarousel\u201d are now used interchangeably in North America and The United Kingdom. There are many words which have the same meaning as carousel. Since it was a popular ride in the United Kingdom, America, and France, each region had its own term. Some people call carousels by different names. In England, a carousel can be called a roundabout, galloper, or tilt. In France, a carousel can be called a riding ring of wooden horses. In America, some people may call carousels flying horses, whirlgig, flying Dutchmen, flying jinny, Kelly\u2019s goats, spinning jinny, hobby horses, steam circus, steam riding galleries, galloping-horse steam carousels, carry-us-alls, and the most popular merry-go-rounds. Most of the words used in the 1700s were to attract customers. Merry-go-round which means a ride rotating happily and Menagerie which means beasts. The reason a carousel is generally used today is due to its tie to the origin of the ride.\nHistory.\nThe earliest types of carousels were most likely created by Arabians. The first carousels were made for adults to ride. Today carousels are made for children to ride. However, the carousel was first recognized as being a carousel in Europe. People most likely made the first carousels in the seventeenth century. However carousels were used in France, to practice a game they enjoyed playing. For this game, horsemen practiced playing a game on which they would ride wooden horses, horses that were carved out of wood. The wooden horses would be rotated by servants pulling at the rotating platform. This would be similar to the playground carousels. Or the horsemen would use real horses to rotate the platform. The carousel emerged as a ride when a toy dealer in France showed wooden horses on a rotating platform moved by human power or horsepower in the beginning of 18th century. Carousels became popular in America between 1880 and 1930. During this time, there were around 5000 carousels built. Michael Dentzel, an American who immigrated from German and lived in Philadelphia, moved the rotary platform of his carousel using steam power or horsepower in 1814. Later, the carousels found in amusement parks had platforms moved by a machine. This concept is still being used today. It was invented in 1898 in America. Railroads were the first companies in America to purchase carousels for their customers' enjoyment.\nAbout carousel animals.\nThe most popular of the carousel animals always has been and still is the horse. Eighty percent of animals carved for carousels in America are horses. Other animals that have been used on carousels include \"Mother Goose\" and \"Disney\" characters. The \"romance\" side of the carousel animals is the side that faces the audience. On the romance side the animal had extra carvings and decorations. Most of the carousels in Europe and America turn counterclockwise. In Great Britain, carousels turn clockwise.\nThe scientific principles.\nA carousel is set up a little above the ground. The platform rotates under motor power in the middle and can move up and down. The number of seats resembling horses or other animals varies depending on the carousel but there are usually between 16 and 60. The horses on the platform are connected to a pole attached to both the floor and the ceiling of the ride. The velocity of a carousel\u2019s rotation is about 5 rounds a minute. An average ride length is 2 to 3 minutes.\nThe speed of the ride is low in order to keep centrifugal force low because the faster it turns the more centrifugal force the ride will have. The axis in the middle has centripetal force, which is the opposite force of centrifugal force."}

He was elected to the Federal Parliament for the Division of Warringah in a by-election in 1994 after Michael McKellar resigned.\nPolitics.\nin 1998, Prime Minister John Howard made Abbott the Minister for Employment Services and in 2001 was promoted to Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. In 2003 Abbott was the Minister for Health and Ageing, and Leader of the House of Representatives in the Federal Parliament. After the defeat of the Howard Government in 2007 he was Shadow Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. He resigned on the 26 November 2009 in protest against Liberal Party policy on climate change. He then defeated the leader Malcolm Turnbull by only one vote in a Liberal Party leadership election on 1 December, 2009.\nOpposition leader.\nAbbott led the party to the 2010 Federal Election. Following the narrow victory of the Australian Labor Party, Abbott was re-elected leader of the Liberal Party and remained Leader of the Opposition.\nPrime Minister.\nAt the 2013 federal election on 7 September, Abbott led the Coalition to victory and became Prime Minister on 18 September 2013. Abbott is no longer prime minister of Australia and has been succeeded by Malcolm Turnbull. In September 2017 Abbott declared that government should end all the subsidies for renewable energy, coal.\nBeliefs.\nAbbott has always held strong conservative and religious views and has not been afraid to speak out on controversial issues. Combined with his earlier training as a priest this has led to his being given the nickname of the \"Mad Monk\". Abbott for example does not support the right of women to have an abortion. As Minister for Health he created a huge protest in 2006 when he tried to ban a drug used for abortions. In 2012 he was criticised by Australian lawyer Julian Burnside for saying that refugees trying to reach Australia were acting in an un-Christian way. Abbott's policies for the 2013 Australian election includes a plan to stop refugee boats coming to Australia. He does not support marriage equality which would let same sex couples get married.\nPersonal life.\nAbbott is a very keen sportsman, and regularly takes part in competitions. He is currently in training for the 2014 Port Macquarie Ironman contest. This is a race with a 3.9\u00a0km swim, 180\u00a0km bicycle ride, and finishing with a 42.2\u00a0km run. Abbott is married with three daughters."}

His five-volume \"Historiae animalium\" (1551\u20131558) is a forerunner of modern zoology. The flowering plant genus \"Gesneria\" is named after him. \nCareer.\nHe studied at Strasbourg, Bourges (1532\u20131533) and Paris. In 1535, religious unrest drove him back to Z\u00fcrich, where he made an unwise marriage. His friends came to his aid, enabled him to study at Basel (1536), and in 1537 obtained for him the professorship of Greek at the newly founded academy of Lausanne (then belonging to Berne). Here he had leisure to devote himself to scientific studies, especially botany. \nIn 1540\u20131541 he visited the famous medical university of Montpellier, took his degree of doctor of medicine (1541) at Basel, and then settled down to practise at Z\u00fcrich, where he obtained the post of lecturer in physics at the Carolinum, the precursor of the University of Z\u00fcrich. There, apart from a few journeys to foreign countries, and annual summer botanical journeys in his native land, he passed the remainder of his life. He devoted himself to preparing works on many subjects of different sorts. He died of the plague, the year after his ennoblement.\nWorks.\nTo his contemporaries he was best known as a botanist, though his botanical manuscripts were not published till long after his death (at Nuremberg, 1751\u20131771, 2 vols. folio), he himself issuing only the \"Enchiridion historiae plantarum\" (1541) and the \"Catalogus plantarum\" (1542) in four languages. \nIn 1545 he published his remarkable \"Bibliotheca universalis\" (ed. J. Simler 1574), supposedly a catalogue (in Latin, Greek and Hebrew) of all writers who had ever lived, with the titles of their works, etc. A second part, \"Pandectarium sive partitionum universalium Conradi Gesneri Ligurini libri xxi\", appeared in 1548; only nineteen books being then concluded. The last, a theological encyclopaedia, was published in 1549, but the last but one, intended to include his medical work, was never finished.\nHis great zoological work, \"Historiae animalium\", appeared in 4 vols. (quadrupeds, birds, fish) folio, 1551\u20131558, at Z\u00fcrich, a fifth (snakes) being issued in 1587. This work is the starting-point of modern zoology. Not content with such vast works, Gessner put forth in 1555 his book entitled \"Mithridates de differentis linguis\", an account of about 130 known languages, with the \"Lord's Prayer\" in twenty-two languages, while in 1556 appeared his edition of the works of Claudius Aelianus.\nGessner's work \"On fossil objects\" contains, among much else, a recognition of the true organic nature of some fossils.\nTo non-scientific readers, Gessner is best known for his love of mountains (below the snow-line) and for his many excursions among them, undertaken partly as a botanist, but also for the sake of exercise and enjoyment of the beauties of nature. In 1541 he prefixed to his \"Libellus de lacte et operibus lactariis\" a letter addressed to his friend, J. Vogel, of Glarus, as to the wonders to be found among the mountains, declaring his love for them, and his firm resolve to climb at least one mountain every year, not only to collect flowers, but in order to exercise his body. In 1555 Gessner issued his narrative (\"Descriptio Montis Fracti sive Montis Pilati\") of his excursion to the Gnepfstein (1920 m), the lowest point in the Pilatus chain.\nAlso note:"}

Ledyard Stebbins", "text": "George Ledyard Stebbins, Jr (6 January 1906 \u2013 19 January 2000) was an American botanist and geneticist. He was one of the leading evolutionary biologists of the 20th century. Stebbins received his PhD in botany from Harvard University in 1931. He went on to the University of California, Berkeley, where his work led to a synthesis of plant evolution and genetics.\nHis most important publication was \"Variation and evolution in plants\", which combined genetics and Darwin's theory of natural selection to describe plant speciation. It helped form the modern evolutionary synthesis, and still provides the framework for research in plant evolutionary biology. According to Ernst Mayr, \"Few later works dealing with the evolutionary systematics of plants have not been very deeply affected by Stebbins' work\". \nHe also researched and wrote widely on the role of hybridization and polyploidy in speciation and plant evolution; his work in this area has had a lasting influence on research in the field.\nStebbins was elected to the National Academy of Science, was awarded the National Medal of Science. He was involved in the development of evolution-based science programs for California high schools, as well as the conservation of rare plants in that state.\nUC Berkeley.\nIn 1935, Stebbins was offered a genetics research position at the University of California, Berkeley working with geneticist E.B. Babcock. Babcock needed assistance with a large Rockefeller-funded project on the genetics and evolution of plants from the genus \"Crepis\". \"Crepis\" commonly hybridized, displayed polyploidy, and could make seed without fertilization (a process known as apomixis). The collaboration between Babcock and Stebbins produced numerous papers and two monographs.\nStebbins's review, \"The significance of polyploidy in plant evolution\", showed how polyploidy was important in developing large, complex, and widespread genera. By looking at the history of polyploidy in plant families, he argued that polyploidy was only common in herbaceous perennials, but infrequent in woody plants and annuals. As such, polyploids played a conservative role in evolution since problems with fertility prevented the replication of new genetic material that might lead to a new line of evolution. This work continued with the 1947 paper \"Types of polyploids: their classification and significance\", which described Stebbins' ideas about the role of paleopolyploidy in angiosperm evolution. He argued that chromosome number may be a useful tool for the construction of phylogenies. These reviews were highly influential and helped others study the role of polyploidy in evolution.\nIn 1939, with Babcock's support, Stebbins was made a full professor in the Department of Genetics at UC Berkeley, after the Department of Botany failed to promote him. Stebbins taught a course on evolution. During his preparation he became excited by research combining genetics and evolution. Stebbins directed his research towards evolution. He became involved with the Society for the Study of Evolution in 1946, and was one of the few botanists in the new organization.\nHe worked on the genetics of grass grown for grazing, looking at polyploidy and the evolution of the Poaceae (grass family). He produced an artificial autotetraploid grass from the diploid species \"Ehrharta erecta\" by treatment with the chromosome doubling agent colchicine. He was able to establish the plant in the field, and after 39 years of field trials found that the tetraploid was not as successful as its diploid parent in an unchanging environment."}

Mallory and his climbing partner Andrew Irvine both disappeared somewhere high on the North - East Ridge in an attempt to get to the top. The pair's last known sighting was a few hundred feet from the summit. Mallory's fate was unknown for 75 years until his body was discovered in 1999. Whether they made it to the summit or not still remains a mystery.\nGeorge Mallory was famous for replying to the question \"Why do you want to climb Mount Everest?\" with the reply: \"Because it's there\", which has been described as \"the most famous three words in the history of mountaineering\". Some questions have been raised inquiring whether Mallory had actually said it, or if it was a newspaper reporter making it up.\nEarly life, education, and teaching career.\nMallory was born in Mobberly, Cheshire, the son of Herbert Leigh Mallory (1846 - 1943), a clergyman who changed his name to Leigh-Mallory in 1914. George had two sisters - one older, one younger - and a younger brother called Trafford-Leigh Mallory, the World War II Royal Air Force commander.\nIn 1896, Mallory went to Glengorse, a boarding school in Eastbourne on the south coast of England, having already transferred from a school in West Kirby. At the age of 13, he won a scholarship to Winchester College. In his second - to - last year at Winchester, he was introduced to rock climbing and mountaineering by a master, R.L.G Irving, who took a small number of pupils climbing in the Alps every year. In October 1905, Mallory entered Magdalane College, Cambridge to study history. There, he became good friends with several members of the Bloomsbury Group including James Strachey, Lytton Strachey, Rupert Brooke, John Maynard Keynes, and Duncan Grant, who painted many portraits of Mallory. Mallory was a keen oarsman and rowed in his college \"eight\", but he did not (as has been written elsewhere) row for Cambridge in the annual Oxford &amp; Cambridge Boat Race. \nAfter getting his degree Mallory stayed in Cambridge for a year writing an essay he later published as Boswell the Biographer (1912). He lived briefly in France, where Simon Bussy painted his portrait, now in London's National Portrait Gallery. On his return he decided to become a teacher. In 1910 he began teaching at Charterhouse School, Godalming, Surrey, where he met the poet Robert Graves, then a pupil; in his autobiography, \"Goodbye to All That\", Graves remembered Mallory, who acted as best man at Robert Graves' wedding in 1918, fondly both for his encouragement of Grave's interest in literature in poetry and his instruction in climbing. Graves recalled: \"He (Mallory) was wasted (as a teacher) at Charterhouse. He tried to treat his class in a friendly way, which puzzled and offended them.\"\nWhile at Charterhouse he met his wife, Ruth Turner, a taxi driver who lived in Goldalming, and they were married in 1914, just six days before Britain and Germany went to war. George and Ruth had two daughters and a son: Clare, born 1915; Beridge, known as 'Berry' (1917); and John (1920). In December 1915 Mallory joined the Royal Garrison Artillery as 2nd lieutenant and in 1916 participated in the shelling of the Somme, under the command of Major Gwilym Lloyd George, who was son of then Prime Minister David Lloyd George. \nAfter the war he returned to Charterhouse, resigning in 1921 to take part in the first Everest expedition."}

Typography was born when print was born. Early types were based on the letterforms of scribes, and the letters cut into Trajan's Column (\"monumental inscriptions\"). Later, gradually, type designs were based on the special needs of books, pamphlets, newspapers and advertisements.\nTypography includes not only letters, but all the set of symbols in a font, and it includes the overall design of a page or document. It applies to any medium which may be read; therefore it includes text on computer screens. A typographer may design type, select fonts, and design the layout of pages and books. The term does not cover the act of printing itself, though many of the early printers were themselves typographers.\nTypography in the 20th century was greatly influenced by three things:\nA traditional aim of the typographer would be to produce a page which is, above all, \"legible\" and \"attractive\" to read, without its being obtrusive. For display typography, such as advertising, the display must be \"noticed\" before it is read. This had led to the development of many display typefaces which are highly visible, and which are available in large sizes."}

One is the family name and the other is the given name.\n\"Park Chan-Ho\" is a name of a Korean person. Park is the family name, and Chan-Ho is the given name. In the Korean language, the family name comes first, and the given name comes second. (It is like writing Smith John, instead of John Smith.) Most Koreans feel uneasy when they are called in the reverse way or by only family name.\nMarriage and children.\nMarried men and women usually keep their full personal names, and children take the father's family name. So, a son of Ha Hi-Ra (female) and Choi Su-Jong (male) will be Choi something.\nNicknames.\nAlthough Koreans have nicknames, these usually come from their personal characteristics like appearance, a physical defect, or a word with a similar pronunciation to their names. They are different from the nicknames in the Western sense such as Bob, Bill, Liz and Kate. Unfavorable nicknames are more common than favorable ones. It is very rare for an adult to be called by a nickname.\nThe way of addressing someone.\nFor the very first time or in a formal situation.\nKoreans call someone with Si (\u6c0f means Mr., Mrs. or Miss, the most universal), Yang (\u5b43 means Miss, used when the person is younger than the speaker), Goon (it means Mr., used when the person is younger than the speaker) after the family name, the given name or the full name. \nIn close relationships.\nSpeaking to a younger person.\nKoreans call someone by only the given name itself or with the vocative postpositional word (Ya - In case the last syllable is open, or A - In case the last syllable is closed)\nSpeaking to an older person.\nMale Koreans often call older males \ud615 (Hyeong) and older females \ub204\ub098 (Nu-na). Female Koreans call older males \uc624\ube60 (O-ppa) and older females \uc5b8\ub2c8 (Eon-ni) after the given name.\nIn the family.\nSpeaking to a younger person.\nKoreans call someone by only the given name itself or with the vocative postpositional word (Ya - In case the last syllable is open, or A - In case the last syllable is closed).\nSpeaking to an older person.\nKoreans call someone using the word that indicates their blood relation instead of their name.\nExamples: \uc544\ubc84\uc9c0 (A-beo-ji, means father), \uc544\ube60 (A-ppa, means dad in a casual way), \uc5b4\uba38\ub2c8 (Eo-meo-ni, means mother), \uc5c4\ub9c8 (eom-ma, means mom), \ud615 (hyeong, means male's elder brother), \ub204\ub098 (Nu-na, male's elder sister), \uc624\ube60 (O-ppa, means female's elder brother), \uc5b8\ub2c8 (Eon-ni, female's elder sister), \ub0a8\ub3d9\uc0dd (Nam-Dong-Saeng, means the younger brother of a person regardless of the person's gender), \uc5ec\ub3d9\uc0dd (Yeo-Dong-Saeng, means the younger sister of a person regardless of the person's gender)\nAt work.\nKoreans may speak to someone using the job title instead of their name. \nFor example, \uc0ac\uc7a5 (Sa-Jang, means the president of a company) and \uacfc\uc7a5 (Gua-Jang, the head of a department).\nSpeaking to a person in a lower rank.\nKoreans call someone with the job title after his family name, for example \ubc15\uacfc\uc7a5 (Park Gua-Jang). \nSpeaking to a higher-ranking person.\nKoreans add \ub2d8 (Nim, the suffix showing respect) after the job title or by the combination like the family name + the job title + Nim.\nFor example, \uc0ac\uc7a5\ub2d8 (Sa-Jang Nim), \uacfc\uc7a5\ub2d8 (Gua-Jang Nim) or \ubc15\uacfc\uc7a5\ub2d8 (Park Gua-Jang Nim)\nLengths, pronunciations, etc..\nThe family name is typically a single syllable, and the given name two syllables. There is no middle name in the Western sense. Each syllable in Korean name (including family names) usually has its Chinese character. But its pronunciation is considerably different from the one in China. In case of the given name, Koreans place great importance on the meaning of each Chinese character. Often naming centers take charge of naming a new baby. "}

People like the book, not so much for its plot, but for the careful and detailed picture of Lucy (the main character)'s feelings and emotions. Charlotte Bront\u00eb used Gothic buildings and other things to show Lucy's feelings inside.\nPlot summary.\nThe story starts with Lucy Snowe at age 14 observing a visitor at her godmother, Lousia Bretton's, house, a little girl called \"Polly\" or \"Missy.\" (Her real name is Paulina Mary Home). Polly loves her papa very, very much, and when he leaves, is extremely unhappy. However, she soon starts to like Mrs. Bretton's young son, Graham, and they become great friends. Later, when Lucy tells her she has to leave and see her father again, Polly is very surprised and sad. Lucy comforts her, and they part.\nLater, a family trouble (the book does not say what) forces Lucy into action--she goes onto a ship heading for France.

When she arrives at France, a gentleman helps her find her trunk, and she finally finds work as a teacher in Madame Beck's boarding school. Madame Beck is a cool, clever, careful woman, who often spies and searches the teachers, firing and hiring easily. However, Lucy is quite satisfied, if not happy, there. Ginevra Fanshawe is a student there, and she and Lucy become friends again. They usually fight with each other because of Ginevra's silliness, but they never get separated completely. Later, young English Dr. John (the gentleman who helped her when she first came to France) keeps on visiting the school because he loves Ginevra, who says she doesn't like him much. Later, Dr. John is discovered to actually be Graham Bretton, and Lucy and Graham become friends again. Lucy begins to love him secretly, but tries her best to keep her feelings hidden. Eventually, though, she buries her love for him by symbolically burying all the letters he sent to her.\nDr. John meets little Polly again, now a young and beautiful countess, and they quickly become friends again - and something more. They marry and have a happy life.\nMeanwhile, Lucy begins to be good friends with Professor Emanuel, and they fall in love. However, lots of people, including Madame Beck, try hard to break the two up, and at last force him to travel away. Professor Emanuel and Lucy declare their love for each other before Professor Emanuel leaves, making Lucy the principal (headmistress) of a school in the meantime.

One of those rivers, the longest, goes to the north of the island, to the Atlantic Ocean, and is called the Yaque del Norte (\"Northern Yaque\"); and the second goes to the south, to the Caribbean Sea, and is called Yaque del Sur (\"Southern Yaque\").\nDuring his first visit to America in 1492, Christopher Columbus saw for the first time this river, at its mouth, and he called it \"R\u00edo de Oro\" (\"Gold River\") because he found many small pieces of gold. But later, during his second visit, he saw the river in other place and called it \"R\u00edo de las Ca\u00f1as\" (\"River of Canes\") because many tall grasses (as sugar cane) were growing on the borders of the river. But none of those names were ever used; it has always been called Yaque, or Yaque del Norte.\nColumbus built three forts near the river: Esperanza, Magdalena and Santiago; the first two were abandoned and Santiago was moved to another place with the name of Santiago de los Caballeros. Later Santiago de los Caballeros was moved again near the river but not in the original place.\nCourse.\nThe source of the Yaque del Norte is at an elevation of 2,580 m, on the \"Pico del Yaque\" mountain, in the central part of the Cordillera Central mountain range.\nBut in this place, the river is called \"Los Guanos\" or \"R\u00edo de la Derecha\" (\"River to the Right\"). The name Yaque del Norte is used only when this small river joins another small river, \"Los Tablones\" or \"R\u00edo de la Izquierda\" (\"River to the Left\") in Manabao, to the west of Jarabacoa, at an elevation of 900 m.\nFrom Manabao, the river flows to the east, through the northwestern part of La Vega province. When it gets to Jarabacoa, it turns to the north, to the Santiago. The River Jimenoa, the only important right tributary of Yaque del Norte, joins it at Jarabacoa.\nIn Santiago de los Caballeros, the river turns to the northwest and flows by the \"Yaque del Norte Valley\", the western part of the Cibao Valley.\nIts mouth is on the Montecristi Bay, just to the south of the city of San Fernando de Monte Cristi, on the Atlantic Ocean.\nIts most important left tributaries are the rivers Bao, \u00c1mina, Mao and Guayub\u00edn.\nCities.\nThe city of Santiago de los Caballeros is the most important Dominican city close to the river.It goes also near the cities of Jarabacoa, Mao, Guayub\u00edn, Casta\u00f1uela and Monte Cristi.\nWatershed and uses.\nWith an area of 7,044 km\u00b2, its watershed is the largest of the Dominican Republic, and the second largest of the island. Its discharge (volume of water which passes through a section of the river per unit of time) is 97.0 cubic metres per second at Palo Verde, to the southeast of San Fernando de Monte Cristi.\nThe water of the river is used for irrigation, mainly in the valley that goes from Santiago to Monte Cristi, the Yaque del Norte Valley. It is a very dry valley and without water it would be very difficult to grow any crop. The most important crops here with irrigation are rice, bananas and \nvegetables as tomato.\nAround Jarabacoa, the river is used for some water sports with canoes and small boats.\nThere are several dams along the river to generate electricity, store the water for irrigation, and prevent flooding."}

Examples of a whip in classical music can be heard near the beginning of Ravel's \"Piano Concerto\" (3rd movement), and in Britten's \"Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra\".\nThere is another type of whip, in which one plank is longer than the other. It can be played with one hand. The player shakes the instrument quickly and the small plank moves away from the large one, then slaps back onto it. It makes a different kind of sound from the whip, and is properly called a slapstick. It has been used by several composers including Mahler, Richard Strauss, Ravel, Mussorgsky and Hindemith.

It is likely the first of Paul's letters, probably written by the end of AD 52 (however, some scholars believe the Epistle to Galatians may have been written at an earlier date: AD 48).\nComposition.\nMost New Testament scholars believe Paul wrote this letter from Corinth, most of the letter has personal information, with only the last two chapters teaching things about what Christians are to believe. Paul's main goal is to encourage and reassure the Christians there. Paul tells them to go on working quietly while waiting in hope for the return of Christ. Paul also teaches that the dead will be resurrected prior to those still living, and both groups will greet the Lord (Jesus) in the air. These verses are often read at funerals of Christians to comfort their families.\nUnlike later Pauline epistles, 1 Thessalonians does not focus on faith or questions of Jewish\u2013Gentile relations, things that are covered in all his other letters. Many scholars see this as an indication that this letter was written before the Epistle to the Galatians, where Paul's teaching on these matters were given."}

Thessalonica was the second city in Europe where Paul taught and left a Christian church. After the first letter was sent, probably soon, some of the Thessalonians were not sure that those who had died would share in the Second Coming of Jesus. This letter was written to answer this concern.\nWhen it was written.\nMany believe it was written around 51\u201352 AD, shortly after the First Epistle. Others think a date of around 80\u2013115 AD is more likely. These are scholars who say that the second letter is quite different from the First Epistle to the Thessalonians and may have been written by someone else. Those who believe Paul wrote \"Second Thessalonians\" also note how Paul signed it himself: \"I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand, which is how I write in every letter.\".\nWhat was written in the letter.\nThe first part of the letter praises this church for keeping their faith even though others were against them.\nThe letter has a whole chapter mainly about the Second Coming of Christ. Someone had told the Thessalonians that Christ had already returned. Paul says this is not true. (chapter 2, verses 1 to 12), He tells the Thessalonians that a great tribulation (time of trouble) must occur before Christ's return. Since this has not yet happened, Christ cannot have returned yet. He then gives thanks that his readers were chosen by God for salvation and saved by His grace through faith, and so would not be deceived by false teachings. (Chapter 2, verses 13 and14)\nThe letter then tells the Thessalonian church to stand firm in their faith, and to \"keep away from every brother who leads an unruly(evil) life and not according to the tradition which you received from us... do not associate (stay) with him, so that he will be put to shame. Yet do not regard him as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother\" (Chapter 3, verses 6,7, 14 and 15).\nHow people have used the teachings of this letter.\nA passage from this book reading \"For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat\", (Chapter 3, verse 10), was later adapted by Vladimir Lenin as an rule of the Soviet Union, \"He who does not work, neither shall he eat\" .\nChristian groups who work with poor people sometimes also use the verse to help people to help themselves instead of just taking help from others. They try to help them find a job instead of just giving them food."}

It is one of three letters in the New Testament of the Bible that are called the Pastoral Epistles, along with Second Timothy and Titus. These letters are called \"pastoral\", because the are sent to persons who are pastors of Christian churches.Timothy was a pastor in Ephesus (Chapter 1, verse 3). The letter gives advice on the organization of the Church and how the leaders in it should act. They are also told to be faithful to the truth even though all around them were false ideas.\nBackground.\nFor many years Paul was a mentor to Timothy. Timothy is first mentioned in chapter 16 of the Book of Acts. His mother Eunice, and his grandmother, Lois, are mentioned in 2 Timothy Chapter 1, verse 5. All that we know of his father is that he was a Greek, not a Jew.\nPaul's second visit to Lystra, a city in Asia Minor is when Timothy first met Paul; (). Paul not only brought Timothy into the faith but he was Timothy\u2019s main mentor in Christian leadership (). They preached and started churches together. Timothy would have received his authority to preach in churches directly from Paul who of course was the greater known and accepted of the two and an apostle.\nContent of the letter.\nThe most important things in the letter are the use of The Law (), warnings against false teachings, instructions for prayer (), roles of women in the church, qualifications for leaders of the church (), and the treatment of widows, elders, masters, youth, and church members in general. The verse about women teaching, Chapter 2,verse 12 is much talked about in churches that do or do not allow women to be pastors. There are many different ideas about what this verse means. "}

It is thought to be the last letter Paul wrote before his death although some think is was written by one of Paul's followers some time after his death. \nContent.\nIn the letter, Paul tells Timothy not to have a \"spirit of fear\" and not to \"be ashamed to talk openly about our Lord (Jesus)\" (Chapter 1, verses 7 and 8). He also tells Timothy to come to visit him before winter, and to bring Mark with him (cf. \"Philippians\" Chapter 2, verse 22). He thought that \"the time of his death was at hand\" (Chapter 4 ,verse 6), and he tells his \"son Timothy\" to work hard and be strong in the face of false teachings, and to be faithful in all the duties of his office of pastor (Chapter 4, verses 1 to 5), knowing that he would someday stand before the Judge of the living and the dead (God).\nPaul thinks he will soon be killed and talks about that. In Chapter 4, verses 6 to 8 he writes \"For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course(race), I have kept the faith: in the future there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.\" "}

This book is believed to a letter from the Apostle Paul to Titus. Titus was a pastor and church leader. The letter tells what church leaders should be like and lists their duties. These leaders are called elders and bishops. This letter is one of three \"Pastoral epistles\" since it was sent to a pastor and is mainly about pastors.\nWho was Titus?\nTitus was mentioned in Galatians (Chapter 2, verses 1 and 3) where Paul wrote of going to Jerusalem with Barnabas, along with Titus. He was then sent to Corinth, Greece, where he helped the Christians there to follow Paul's teachings. Titus was later left on the island of Crete to help organize the Church, and later met back with the Apostle Paul in Nicopolis. He soon went to Dalmatia (now Croatia). Then he served as the first bishop of Crete.\nContent of the letter.\nFalse teachers.\nIn Chapter 1, verse 9, Paul says that some among the Jewish Christians are false teachers. Paul says the false teachers are rebellious, empty talkers who claim to teach the law \"without understanding\" They cause the Christians to believe false things. Calvin wrote that vain (empty) talking (Greek: mataiologia) is not the same as useful doctrine. The false teachings don't help people to show piety and fear of God.\nHow different groups should act.\nIn Chapter 2, Paul tells how the people in the church should act. He talks about older men, older women, younger women, young men, and slaves. Each group is given their proper way to live. All are told to live for God while they wait for the return of Jesus who died to buy us back from evil living and make us into good people.\nMore about right living.\nChapter 3 tells the Christians to obey the government leaders and to live a good life and be gentle. The adds that Jesus has saved us not because of the good things we had done, but through his grace and mercy and now wants to make us into people always who do good things. The letter ends with a final warning against those who stir up fights and some personal greetings.\nEpimenides paradox.\nIn the Epistle to Titus it says in chapter 1 verse 12 and 13 \"One of the Cretans, a prophet of their own, said, 'Cretans are always liars'\". This is called a logical paradox since if a member of a group says that all members of the group are liars we can't know if what he says is true since he must also be a liar. Students of logic think about this and try to find an answer. The one who said this was Epimenides, so it is named for him."}

Almost everyone agrees that letter was written by the Saint Paul to Philemon. It is the shortest of Paul's letters, consisting of only 335 words in the Greek text.\nWhy Paul wrote the letter.\nPaul wrote this letter on behalf of Onesimus, who may have been a runaway slave who had wronged his owner Philemon. We don't know what Onesimus had done, but perhaps he ran away after stealing money. Paul says in verse 18 that if Onesimus owes anything, Philemon should charge it to Paul's account. It is thought that Philemon lived in Colossae; in the letter to the Colossians, Onesimus (the slave who fled from Philemon) and Archippus (whom Paul greets in the letter to Philemon) are said to be members of the church there.\nPaul says that Onesimus has been very helpful to him while he was in prison in Rome. He would like for Philemon to free him and send him back to Rome. Paul says that Philemon should receive him not as a slave but as a brother. Paul did not seem to think that Onesimus should be punished, even though Roman law allowed the owner of a runaway slave to punish or even kill them.\nImportance.\nSome see this letter as a step towards thinking of slaves as fully human. Before Paul, Ruden argues, a slave was considered subhuman, and entitled to no more consideration than an animal. Others think that Paul and the early Christians should have done more to combat the evil of slavery. In history, some Christians used the book to justify slavery. Pope Benedict XVI refers to this letter in the Encyclic, \"Spe salvi\", to tell of the power of Christianity to improve society. He says that Christianity was very important to the large decrease of slavery during the Middle Ages and after."}
{"id": "216119", "revid": "22027", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=216119", "title": "Epistle of James", "text": "The Epistle of James is a book inclused in the Christian Bible, the twentieth in the New Testament. \nAuthor and aim.\nAccording to its opening verse, this epistle was written by James (often identified with the \u201cbrother of the Lord\u201d who leaded the Jerusalem Church about 20 years and was killed around 62 AD). \nThe title \u201cservant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ\u201d (which suggest a Church official), the courage to address \u201cthe twelve tribes in the Dispersion\u201d (i.e. Jewish Christian communities outside Palestine, or all faithful living in a non-Christian environment), and the tone of authority throughout the letter, all indicate someone well known and respected. \nThe writer appears concerned in clarifying Paul\u2019s teaching on faith/action, against Christians who deform it. This indicates that the letter was written after those of Paul had begun to circulate diffusely, in the last decades of the 1st century.\nThis late dating, together with the quite elegant Greek style and the lack of any real emphasis on the Jewish legalism which was part of James\u2019 approach to religion, have persuaded a growing majority of contemporary scholars that a Christian versed in both Hellenism and Judaism wrote using James\u2019 name. \nMay be early tradition stemming from James was updated and published by an unknown Christian teacher of a later generation: possibly this is why the letter was not universally accepted by the Churches until near the end of the 4th century.\nSources and contents.\nThe author\u2019s two chief sources are OT Wisdom books and the teaching found in the Gospels, though he hardly ever uses direct quotations. \nReflecting Jewish Christian assemblies, he rethinks OT sayings in the light of Jesus\u2019 teachings and re-presents them in an original way. \nThe epistle consists of a long series of exhortations, mostly brief and loosely connected, some developed at length. \nThe one common trait, which gives the letter its distinctive quality, is a concern that the faith be implemented in every aspect of life; otherwise it is useless. \nThe author takes for granted Jesus' saving work, but is especially interested in Christians' moral life. So, there is no real contradiction between Paul's and James' teachings, for Paul was speaking of the impossibility of earning salvation by one's own efforts, not of the works of charity and justice to which the Christians are called. \nJames used a friendly way of addressing his readers on the day-to-day problems we also meet and in which we must follow faith and love for others: community life, prejudice or discrimination, care for poor, widows and orphans, jealousy and selfish ambition, controlling the tongue, community concern for the sick, matters of justice, speaking evil against each other. He said in effect: \u201cLove first and it will prove your faith\u201d. \nThe central theme is the true wisdom that comes from God as opposed to false wisdom. The moral teaching revealed from on high, is not human but divine wisdom. Humans can only analyse it, enter into it more deeply and put it into practice. It is an objective ethics needed to see life in its proper perspective and to be guided in action. Earthly wisdom, on the contrary, is a permanent temptation in people who want to decide for themselves what is right and what is wrong, only to end in justifying wicked behaviour.\nThe other main theme is God\u2019s preference for the lowly: so in this manifesto for social justice the author praises the poor and threatens the rich. Respect for the dignity of every person is fundamental especially that of the poor, exposed to contempt by the powerful. This evidently takes up the task undertaken by the prophets, but it also refers to Christ, whose glory guarantees the dignity of everyone redeemed by his blood, and excludes every kind of favouritism. \nJames insists much on bridling the tongue: in this respect, teachers have a special responsibility within the Church since their instructions (and their writings) can create dissent and division in her. Those with a strong influence on public also have a similar responsibility.\nMore in detail, we read:\nOpening formula and exhortations.\nJas 1:1-18: A series of short exhortations, linked together more by word connections than by concept, introduces topics to be developed in the letter.\nBe doers of the Word and avoid partiality.\nJas 1:19-27: The Word in which we were given birth by God must be heard: any obstacles must be removed so to put it into practice.\nJas 2:1-13: This explanation of the previous exhortations is a warning against partiality and leads to a fuller consideration of the poor in community.\nFaith without deeds is dead.\nJas 2:14-26: This part is unique for its unified and relatively long development of a single theme: that faith without works is dead i.e. cannot save anyone for eternal life. This is the heart of the letter, giving the theoretical basis for the practical exhortations. Yet, the appearance of a contradiction of Paul\u2019s teaching on justification by faith has given excessive prominence to this section. It was largely because of it that M. Luther wished to exclude this letter from the Bible.\nGuard of the tongue and qualities of Wisdom.\nJas 3:1-4:12: These are two clearly defined, closely developed sections. Since faults of tongue and false wisdom lead to strife in the community, James considers the root causes and remedies thereof, concluding with a consideration of law and judgment.\nArrogance and reaches.\nJas 4:13-5:6: These two passages are parallel in that each is introduced identically and employs direct address. The first is against mercantile arrogance, the second is a severe denunciation of unjust rich similar to those of OT prophets. It is a useful warning to the faithful of the terrible fate of those who abuse riches.\nConclusion.\nJas 5:7-20: After an exhortation to patiently waiting for the Lord\u2019s coming, the letter ends with three topics: oaths, prayer and converting the sinners. In the midst, James proclaims the anointing of the sick by Church leaders which is one of the seven sacraments."}

It was written to show that Jesus really came \"in the flesh\", and not only as a spirit, as some false teachers were saying. John says they are \"anti-Christ\", meaning against Christ. This false teaching is known as docetism. It says that Jesus only seemed to be a human person with a real body. John's letter says that Christians can tell if teachers are true. True teachers will say that say that Jesus came in the flesh. True teachers are also known by their ethics, and by their love.\nJohn wrote the letter so that the joy of his readers would \"be full\" (Chapter 1, verse 4).\nAlso he says that as true Christians they would \"not practice sin\" (keep sinning) (Chapter 2, verse 1); that \"we should love one another\" (Chapter 3, verse 11); and that \"you who believe in the name of the Son of God... may know that you have eternal life.\" (Chapter 5, verse 13). So we see that the aim of the letter was to make the Christians more full of joy, and also to help readers to know if they are really saved."}

In number of verses, it is the shortest book in the bible.\nThere is some disagreement over whether the John who wrote the letters of John, the John who wrote The Gospel of John, and the John who wrote the Book of Revelation are the same person.\nTo whom it is written.\nThe letter is sent to \"the elect lady and her children\" (some bibles translate this phrase as \"elder lady and her children\"), and closes with the words, \"The children of your chosen sister greet you.\"\nThe lady has often been seen as a picture of the church, the church being the body of Christians as a whole and as local congregations. It is also possible the letter was sent to a real lady who John knew, and the children are real children, not members of the church.\nWhat is written.\nWhat this letter says is similar to the Third Epistle of John. The traditional view is that all the letters are by the hand of John the Apostle, and the language and words used and arguments made all seem to support this idea.\nThe letter also warns against people who say that Jesus was not a flesh-and-blood figure: \"For many deceivers are entered into the world, who say that Jesus Christ has not come in the flesh.\" This shows that, from the time the epistle was first written, there were those who had docetic ideas about Jesus, believing that the human person of Jesus was really a pure spirit or did not come at all. John says that these people are deceivers and even calls them Antichrist that is against Christ. He says Christians should not receive such people."}

It is one of the shortest books in the Bible, at only 25 verses long.\nWho wrote it.\nThe writer calls himself Jude. This may not be the same person as Jude the Apostle. This Jude calls himself a brother of James, who was a leader in the church at Jerusalem. Both Jude and James were probably half brothers of Jesus. They did not believe that he was the Christ, until after the Resurrection. (John chapter 7, verse 5) The book may have been written between 60 and 80 A.D. and was sent to many places. This is called a \"General\" epistle. \nThe content of the letter.\nThe writer of this book seems to have a good knowledge of the Old Testament books and also of some of the other books that were known as Jewish writings, but which are not in the bible. \nHe warns of \"people who change the message about the grace of God in order to excuse their immoral ways\" (verse 4). He says this is not the faith \"once delivered to the saints\". He warns that we have stories in the bible of people who turned from trusting God to evil. He lists the fallen angels, those saved from slavery in Eqypt and the people of Sodom and Gomorrah. He also mentions individuals such as Cain who killed his brother, Balaam, and Korah. \nHe tells everyone to keep their faith, keep praying, love others, and wait for the second coming of Jesus. The letter closes with a blessing that is sometimes used to end church meetings. \"Now to the one who is able to keep you from falling, and to cause you to stand, rejoicing, without blemish before his glorious presence, to the only God our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, power, and authority, before all time, and now, and for all eternity.

The 1976 and 1986 eruptions started with a series of vent-clearing explosions. There were clouds of volcanic ash that went straight up into the sky. These were followed by eruptions of rocks and mud slides down the side of the volcano. In 1812, 1935, 1964-65, 1976, and 1986, unlike some prehistoric eruptions, the top of the mountain did not collapse. However, in the 1883 eruption, a part of the top of the volcano broke loose starting an avalanche that flowed down to the sea. The avalanche started a small tsunami that reached the Kenai Peninsula at English Bay, east of the volcano.\nClouds of volcanic ash are a major problem to jet aircraft using Anchorage International and other local airports. Ashfall from future eruptions could disrupt oil and gas operations and shipping activities in Cook Inlet. Eruptions like the historical and prehistoric eruptions are likely in Augustine's future."}

It is based on the novel by Robert Ludlum, \"The Bourne Identity\", which was published in 1980. The movie is directed by Doug Liman. It stars Matt Damon as the main character, Jason Bourne.\nIn the movie, as Jason Bourne recovers from his gunshot wound, he find that he lost his memory. As he recovered his memory, he learns he was involved with an international spy agency. The movie is set in Europe, in places such as Prague, Paris, and Italy. It shows thrilling gunfights, car chases, and action scenes. After release, the box-office profit was successful. Two sequels, \"The Bourne Supremacy\" and \"The Bourne Ultimatum\" were released in 2004 and 2007.\nPlot.\nAn unidentified man is rescued from the sea by fishermen. But because of amnesia, he cannot remember who he is. He cannot remember why he was drowning in the sea, how the gunshot wound on his back was made, how he can speak many languages or how he has martial arts skills. He only knows the number to his Swiss bank safe which was hidden in his skin.\nIn the safe, he finds a huge amount of cash, and passports for each country. He saw the name \"Jason Bourne\" on his U.S. passport and he believes that is his name. After he has some trouble at the U.S. embassy in Zurich, he moves to Paris with the help of a woman named Marie Kreutz. Wherever he moves, the police and assassins chase him and Marie. In continuous chasing between Bourne and the killers, he notices that some unknown big power threatens his existence. To find his identity and the reason why they are trying to kill him, Bourne gradually gains access to the unknown agency.\nCritics.\nAfter the movie was released in the U.S., the movie got generally good reviews from several critics, especially for the acting of Matt Damon and the direction of Doug Liman. Peter Howell of the \"Toronto Star\" said, \"An entertaining thriller that eschews most of the usual spy gimmicks in favour of old-fashioned sleuthing.\" Eric Harrison of the \"Houston Chronicle\" praised the direction of Liman: \"The Bourne Identity shouldn\u2019t be half as entertaining as it is, but director Doug Liman and his colleagues have managed to pack it with enough action to satisfy the boom-bam crowd without a huge sacrifice of character and mood.\" Matt Damon also got praise from Stephen Hunter of the \"Washington Post\": \"Great fights. You wouldn\u2019t think of Damon as a tough guy, but he\u2019s worked really hard on the physical stuff here and it shows.\""}

It was not glaciated because snowfall was extremely light as the winds from the Pacific Ocean lost their moisture over the fully glaciated nearby mountains. \nThe grassland steppe, including the land bridge, that stretched for several hundred miles into the continents on either side has been called Beringia. It is believed that a small human population of at most a few thousand survived the ice age in Beringia. It was isolated from populations in Asia for at least 5,000 years. Sometime after 16,500 years ago, it started to populate the Americas when the American glaciers that blocked the way southward melted.\nGeography.\nThe Bering Strait, the Chukchi Sea to the north and the Bering Sea to the south, are all shallow seas (\"maps, right\"). During cycles of global cooling, such as the most recent ice age, much water became concentrated in the ice caps of the Arctic and Antarctica. The drop in sea levels exposed shallow sea floors that have subsequently re-flooded. Other land bridges around the world have been created and re-flooded in the same way: about 14,000 years ago, mainland Australia was linked to both New Guinea and Tasmania. The British Isles were an extension of continental Europe via the dry bed of the English Channel; and the dry basin of the South China Sea linked Sumatra, Java and Borneo to the Asian mainland.\nThe rise and fall of global sea levels exposed and submerged the bridging land mass called \"Beringia\" several times in the Pleistocene. The Beringian land bridge is believed to have existed in the glaciation that occurred before 35,000 BP. During the more recent period 22,000-7,000 years BP it was also above water. The strait reopened about 15,500 BP and by c. 6000 BP the coastlines had their present form.\nHuman habitation.\nThe Beringa land bridge is significant for several reasons, not least because it is believed to have enabled human migration to the Americas from Asia about 25,000 years ago. A study by Hey has indicated that of the people migrating across this land bridge during that time period, only 70 left their genetic print in modern descendants. "}

The season was split into two halves, December 19 to February 4, and February 6 to March 6. The Montreal Canadiens won the first half, and Toronto the second half. The Montreal Wanderers withdrew early in January 1918 after their rink, the Westmount Arena, burned down. Toronto won the NHL playoff and then won the Stanley Cup by defeating the PCHA's Vancouver Millionaires three games to two in a best-of-five series\nLeague business.\nThe November 10, 1917 annual meeting of the NHA was presided over by Frank Calder, who was the NHA secretary. The NHA voted to stop operating.\nOn November 17, 1917, it was announced that the Quebec Bulldogs team would not play the next season, but that the NHA season would continue.\nOn November 26, 1917, representatives of the NHA clubs met at the Windsor Hotel in Montreal. The decision to start a new league was made, which was named the National Hockey League.\nThey also decied on several things for the NHL:\nA Toronto team was to be controlld for a wihle by the Arena Gardens while the problem of who owned the Toronto team was fixed. The franchise had players from the Toronto Blueshirts, including those who had been sent to other NHA teams for the second half of the 1916\u201317 NHA season. While Eddie Livingstone, who owned Toronto teams, agreed to do this, the NHL owners did not want to share any money with him. Livingstone would sue for the Toronto team's revenues in 1918. George Kennedy, owner of the Canadiens, would later say:\n\"The Toronto players belong as a body to the National Hockey League, for they were only loaned to the Toronto Arena Company, though Livingstone tried to make the Arena Company believe that he controlled those players\"\nThe Toronto team played without a nickname for the season. They would later be called the \"Toronto Arenas.\"\nThe NHL was not supposed to be a permanent league. It was only supposed to exist until the NHA could fix the problem of teams in the NHA. The NHA was involved in a lawsuit against the 228th Battalion, who had a team in the NHA the year before, and could or would not fold until that was finished.\nMajor rule changes between the NHA and NHL.\nThe O'Brien Cup was given to the new NHL from the NHA, and became the league's championship trophy. It was awarded to the winner of the NHL playoffs and that winner then went on to play for the Stanley Cup in a series against other leagues.\nOn January 9, 1918, the league decided to allow goaltenders to drop to the ice surface in order to make saves. This was the first implemented and amended rule change in the National Hockey League. It was done in response to Ottawa's Clint Benedict, who would fall to the ice to stop the puck, even though it was against the rules.\nRegular season.\nThe new league had trouble getting players because there were other leagues at the time, including the Pacific Coast Hockey Association. Also making it difficult was many people were involved in World War I, so they could not play hockey.\nThe Wanderers were in trouble from the start of the season. They won their first home game, but only had 700 people watch. The Wanderers then lost the next three games and owner Lichtenhein threatened to withdraw from the league unless he could get some other players. Although they could have acquired Joe Malone, who led the NHL in scoring, in the draft, they turned to the PCHA and signed goaltender Hap Holmes. They were also allowed to sign players like Frank Foyston, Jack Walker and others if they could get the players to agree. The Wanderers loaned Holmes to the Seattle Metropolitans of the PCHA, but he eventually came back to the NHL when Seattle loaned him to Toronto.\nA league meeting was planned to deal with the Wanderers, but on January 2, 1918, the it was fixed when the Montreal Arena burned down, leaving the Canadiens and Wanderers without a place to play. The Canadiens moved into the 3,250 seat Jubilee Rink. The Hamilton arena said the Wanderers could play there, but instead Lichtenhein shut down the team on January 4, after the other clubs refused to give him any more players. The remaining three teams would complete the season.\nThe last player from the this season who played was Reg Noble, who retired following the 1933 Stanley Cup playoffs.\nImportant events.\nThe first game of the season featured Toronto versus the Wanderers. Montreal's Dave Ritchie scored the first goal in NHL history and Harry Hyland had four goals in the Wanderers 10\u20139 victory, which would be their only one in the NHL. The opening game was played in front of 700 people.\nOn January 28, when Canadiens visited Toronto, players Alf Skinner and Joe Hall started swinging their sticks at each other. Both players received match penalties, $15 fines and were arrested by the Toronto Police for disorderly conduct, for which they received suspended sentences.\nFinal standings.\nWanderers defaulted scheduled games against the Canadiens (Jan. 2, 1918) and Toronto (Jan. 5, 1918), when their arena burned down. These were counted as losses in the standings, though the games were not played.\n\"The league did not accept the Wanderers' resignation immediately, electing to wait and see whether the team showed up for its scheduled match in Toronto on Saturday January 5. ... The deadline did expire, and the once-powerful team that had been known as the Little Men of Iron was thrown onto the scrap heap of hockey history.

They said there would be 11 to 16 named storms, 6 to 8 hurricanes and 3 to 5 major hurricanes. A major hurricane is a Category 3 storm or higher on the Saffir\u2013Simpson Hurricane Scale. On April 7, 2010, they made another forecast: 15 named storms, 8 hurricanes and 4 very strong hurricanes.

North Carolina State University said that 2010 would have 15 to 18 named storms, and 8\u201311 would become hurricanes. On May 27, 2010, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) put out their forecast for the season.

On June 17, the Met Office said there would be 20 tropical storms. However, they do not issue forecasts on the number of hurricanes and very strong hurricanes. A normal season has about 10 named storms, so if these predictions are correct, the 2010 season will have a high number of storms.\nStorms.\nHurricane Alex.\nTropical Depression One started just offshore of Honduras on June 25. Strengthening fast, it became a tropical storm the next morning, given the name Alex. Tropical Storm Alex continued to strengthen fast, striking central Belize on that same day with winds of 65\u00a0mph (105\u00a0km). For about twelve hours, Alex had weakened back to a tropical depression after moving further inland over the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. Alex would re-strengthen into a tropical storm on June 27 while entering the Gulf of Mexico. Tropical Storm Alex moved generally westward across the Gulf of Mexico, strengthening further as it did so. By June 29, winds from Alex were strong enough for it to become a hurricane. While reaching its highest winds, 105\u00a0mph (169\u00a0km/h), Hurricane Alex struck land again in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas late on June 30. Alex died out over Mexico a few days after striking land.\nHurricane Alex caused 51 deaths and about $1.885 billion (2010 USD) in damage. \nTropical Depression Two.\nTropical Depression Two had started in the western Gulf of Mexico on July 8. It stayed weak and did not become a tropical storm. Two made landfall in southern Texas with winds of 35\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h). Tropical Depression Two rapidly died over Mexico. \nTropical Storm Bonnie.\nTropical Depression Three started to the southeast of the Bahamas on July 22. It quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Bonnie, but did not strengthen any further. Tropical Storm Bonnie moved quickly westward, making landfall in Cutler Bay, Florida only the next day. Bonnie quickly went back to tropical depression status while crossing Florida. Instead of re-strengthening, Tropical Depression Bonnie died in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico.\nOne person drowned in Puerto Rico from what would become Tropical Storm Bonnie. \nTropical Storm Colin.\nOn August 2, a Tropical wave that came from Africa had started to organize Tropical Depression Four. On the next morning, Tropical Depression Four had strengthened and became Tropical Storm Colin. Bad conditions for tropical cyclones were in the atmosphere, and Colin quickly died out. By August 5, the storm reformed, and was again Tropical Storm Colin, heading northward. Cooling water temperatures later began to destroy the storm, and Tropical Storm Colin died again just west of Bermuda. \nTropical Depression Five.\nTropical Depression Five started in the southeast Gulf of Mexico, near Florida. It headed northwestward, toward Louisiana. There was no further strengthening, so Tropical Depression Five did not become a tropical storm. Nearing the coast of Louisiana, Tropical Depression Five died just before making a landfall in the state on August 11, but the remains did reach land. \nHurricane Danielle.\nOn August 19, Tropical Depression Six formed close to Africa. On August 22, Tropical Depression Six strengthened to become Tropical Storm Danielle. The next day the storm strengthened further and became Hurricane Danielle, a Category 2 hurricane. Suddenly bad conditions in the atmosphere meant that Danielle weakened back to a tropical storm. A few hours later Danielle strengthened to a hurricane for a second time, reaching Category 4 strength. As Danielle went over the colder waters of the north Atlantic it weakened, and was no longer a hurricane east of Newfoundland. Danielle was never a threat to land.\nHurricane Earl.\nOn August 23, a Tropical Wave moved off the East coast of Africa. Two days later Tropical Depression Seven formed East of Hurricane Danielle, and later strengthened and became Tropical Storm Earl on the same day. On August 29th, Earl strengthened into a hurricane. On August 30, Earl impacted the northern Leeward Islands including Antigua and Barbuda and the British Virgin Islands, while at the same time strengthening into a Category 4 hurricane. After moving away from the Leeward Islands, Earl was downgraded to a Category 3 hurricane due to changes in the eyewall of the storm. However, the hurricane quickly intensified back to a Category 4. Earl passed Cape Hatteras in the U.S. state of North Carolina on September 2nd, bringing heavy rainfall and strong winds to the area. Buildings in the area were not damaged much, as houses along the coast were built to stand against hurricanes. Earl travelled north along the U.S. coast, weakening down to a tropical storm when it reached Nova Scotia in Canada.\nDamage from Earl was minimal in the U.S., but Earl caused $150 million of damage in the Caribbean.\nTropical Storm Fiona.\nOn August 30, an area of Disturbed weather that moved off from Africa gained enough strength to be named as Tropical Storm Fiona, skipping the status of being a tropical depression. Fiona struggled to strengthen further, as it was close to the much more powerful Hurricane Earl. Fiona died just south of Bermuda, but dropped an inch of rain on the island.\nTropical Storm Gaston.\nAnother tropical wave emerged off Africa near the end of August. Good conditions meant that the tropical wave developed into a tropical depression on September 1st. Later that day it strengthened to become Tropical Storm Gaston. However bad conditions meant that Gaston weakened and died soon after. There was a possibility that the leftovers of Gaston could re-strengthen and affect the Caribbean, however this did not happen.\nTropical Storm Hermine.\nThe leftovers of Tropical Depression Eleven-E from the Pacific Ocean re-strengthened over the Bay of Campeche. By August 5, the storm had enough power to be called a tropical depression. Later in the day it strengthened further to become Tropical Storm Hermine. The storm reached land in north-eastern Mexico on September 7 as a tropical storm. \nHermine blew over trees and power lines in the Rio Grande valley, and one person drowned due to a strong sea current in Texas. Hermine also created at least two tornadoes.\nHurricane Igor.\nA tropical wave from Africa strengthened quickly on September 8 to become a tropical depression. Later it strengthened further to become Tropical Storm Igor to the south of the Cape Verde islands. Igor weakened to a tropical depression due to mixing with another area of bad weather, but then strengthened to a tropical storm, and then a hurricane on September 11. Shortly after becoming a hurricane, Igor strengthened faster, reaching strong category 4 hurricane status the following day. By September 17, it looked like Igor would hit Bermuda in some way, which it did the following day. Bermuda only got minor effects from Igor, unlike Hurricane Fabian in 2003 which almost destroyed parts of the island. From there, Igor started moving north and then northeast toward Canada, weakening to a tropical storm early on September 21, and dying later that day.\nHurricane Julia.\nAnother tropical depression started from a tropical wave off of Africa, forming on September 12. After remaining a tropical depression for the rest of the day, the system strengthened into Tropical Storm Julia early on September 13. Early on September 14, Julia strengthened into the season's fifth hurricane. The hurricane strengthened very quickly on September 15, and became a major Category 3 hurricane. Julia holds the record for the strongest storm to form farthest east. However, just a day after Julia strengthened to a Category 4, it weakened to a Category 2 hurricane.\nHurricane Karl.\nAn area of low pressure stopped around the Northern Venezuela coast on September 11. It moved northward and then eastward, bringing bad weather to Hispaniola and Jamaica. On September 14 the storm strengthened and was named Tropical Storm Karl. Karl made landfall on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula on September 15, and once in the Bay of Campeche, it strengthened into a hurricane. On September 17 Karl became a Category 3 hurricane, the first major hurricane to exist in the Bay of Campeche. It reached land near Veracruz, Mexico the next day and died just a few hours later.\nHurricane Lisa.\nA tropical depression formed on September 20 from a tropical wave off the coast of west Africa. Six hours later it strengthened to form Tropical Storm Lisa. The storm moved very slowly around the area of ocean next to the Cape Verde islands. On September 24 Lisa became a Category 1 hurricane, however weakened quickly back to a tropical depression the next day before dying. Lisa was not a threat to land. \nTropical Storm Matthew.\nTropical Depression Fifteen formed on September 23 in the Caribbean Sea and strengthened to Tropical Storm Matthew.On September 24 Matthew reached land at the Honduras and Nicaragua border while a tropical storm, and then Belize as a tropical depression. Matthew produced a lot of rain that flooded portions of southern Mexico.\nTropical Storm Nicole.\nOn September 28, Tropical Depression Sixteen formed from an tropical wave in the northern Caribbean Sea. The next day, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Nicole and reached land on Cuba close after formation. After crossing Cuba, the National Hurricane Center could not find the storm centre and decided that Nicole was no longer a tropical storm.\nHurricane Otto.\nOn October 6, bad weather near the Leeward Islands formed into a subtropical depression, a storm that is not a proper tropical storm. It then strengthened into Subtropical Storm Otto, and a few hours later the National Hurricane Center believed that it was a fully tropical storm, and it became Tropical Storm Otto. On October 8 Otto strengthened and became a Category 1 hurricane out in the Atlantic. Soon after, Otto began to weaken and was no longer a hurricane when it passed west of the Azores. \nHurricane Paula.\nOn October 11, an area of Disturbed weather in the Caribbean Sea strengthened into Tropical Storm Paula. A day later, Paula became a hurricane and soon into a Category 2 storm. Paula then weakened as it approached Cuba, and hit the island as a tropical storm. Paula then quickly died after hitting Cuba.\nHurricane Richard.\nOn October 20, an area of Disturbed weather strengthened into Tropical Depression Nineteen, and the next day it became Tropical Storm Richard. Richard is one of nine Atlantic storms to have a name beginning with the letter 'R'. On October 24, Richard strengthened into a hurricane and reached land at Belize. Richard dissipated in the Bay of Campeche on October 26.\nHurricane Shary.\nOn October 28, an area of Disturbed weather south of Bermuda became Tropical Storm Shary. On October 30, while west of Bermuda, Shary became a Category 1 hurricane. The same day, Shary became non-tropical and was not known as a hurricane.\nHurricane Tomas.\nOn October 29, an area of bad weather north of Guyana became Tropical Storm Tomas. The storm went west and became a hurricane while over the Windward Islands on October 30 before going into the Caribbean Sea. Hurricane Tomas weakened into Tropical Storm Tomas on October 31. On November 3, it weakened into Tropical Depression Tomas. Tomas turned into a tropical storm later on November 3 and a hurricane again on November 5. The hurricane went north between Cuba and Haiti and then hit the Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands before going into the Atlantic Ocean. Tomas died in the Atlantic Ocean on November 7.\nStorm names.\nThese are the names that may be used in the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season. This is the same list used in the 2004 season, except for Colin, Fiona, Igor, and Julia. In 2004, the names that started with those same letters were Charley, Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne, respectively. They were removed because of the damage they caused.\nRetirement.\nOn March 16, 2011, World Meteorological Organization retired the names Igor and Tomas from its rotating name lists. The names were replaced with Ian and Tobias"}

These games are played on a pool table with six holes cut into them called pockets, into which balls are deposited as one of the main goals of play.\nHistory.\nOutside the billiards industry, the various games played on these tables are very often called \"pool\". This is due to an association with the \"poolrooms\" where gamblers \"pooled\" together their money to bet on horse races. Because these places often provided billiard tables, the term \"pool\" became linked to billiards. Though the original \"pool\" games were played on pocketless carom billiards tables, the name stuck to pocket billiards as it gained in popularity. The traditional view of billiards as a refined and noble pastime did not blend well with the low-class connotations of gambling. Because of this, the billiards industry's attempts to distance itself from the term \"pool\" beginning in the late 19th century. They were largely unsuccessful.\nThere are hundreds of pool games. Some of the more well known include eight-ball, nine-ball, straight pool, and one-pocket. The game of snooker is played on a table with pockets but is considered separate from pool. It is governed internationally by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (professional) and the International Billiards and Snooker Federation (amateur). There are also hybrid games combining traits of both pool and carom billiards, such as English billiards, American four-ball billiards, cowboy pool and bottle pool.\nAs a competitive sport, pool is governed internationally by the World Pool-Billiard Association (WPA), which has national affiliates such as the US Billiard Congress of America (BCA), and which represents pool in the World Confederation of Billiard Sports, which in turn represents all forms of cue sports in the International Olympic Committee.\nEquipment.\nPool uses different equipment from carom billiards. In addition pool tables having pockets, the balls for pool are generally smaller and range from in diameter to in diameter. By comparison, carom billiard balls are generally , or . While UMB, the International Olympic Committee-recognized world carom billiards authority, permits balls as small as , no major manufacturer produces such balls any longer. For that reason the normal standard is . Modern pool tables range in size from by , to by . Modern cue sticks are generally long for pool while cues prior to 1980 were designed for \"straight pool\" and had an average length of , while carom billiards cues are generally long."}

{"id": "216302", "revid": "16695", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=216302", "title": "Hanbok", "text": "Hanbok (Hangul:\ud55c\ubcf5) refers to traditional Korean clothing. In North Korea, hanbok is referred to as Choson-ot (\uc870\uc120\uc637). One of the most famous characteristics of hanbok is its vivid colors and straight and curved lines. Although its literal meaning is Korean clothing, it today indicates specifically traditional garment, especially that of Joseon dynasty.\nHanbok has been a great part of Korean culture thoughout history. Traces of Hanbok have been found even before Three Kingdom period of Korea. The oldest form of hanbok can be seen in tomb mural paintings from the Goguryeo Kingdom (37 B.C.-668 A.D.). Korea had two kinds of clothing tradition. The rulers and noblemen usually wore clothing of different kinds of foreign styles, but subjects continued to use a distinct style of indigenous clothing that today is known as hanbok.\nThere are several kinds of hanbok. People wore different sorts according to their social statuses, sexes, jobs; from time to time, they chose special hanbok for ceremonies. People could figure out the wearer\u2019s job, educational background and even whether he or she was married or not. There are hanbok for men, women, royal court, government officials and children. Because hanbok could reveal the wearer\u2019s social status, there were some government regulations on designs, materials and shapes. For example, only royal families could use golden stripes on their hanbok.\nHistory of Hanbok.\nHanbok had a long history. But the most ancient one that is similar with today\u2019s hanbok would be that of the Three Kingdom period. During this time, noblewomen started wearing full-length skirts and jackets, and noblemen began to wear roomy trousers bound in at the ankles and belted at the waist. Thus, aristocrats began to wear what is similar with hanbok in these days.\nAfter Silla unified the Korean peninsula in the 7th century, a new clothing style was introduced, which combined original Korean dress with foreign elements imported from China. This Chinese style of the Tang Dynasty (618 A.D.-907 A.D.) was regarded as an international clothing style, and was used for the uniforms of government servants and for ceremonial dress. The most conspicuous difference is that while the original Korean cloth had a straight neckline, the imported Chinese style had a rounded one. In the ensuing Goryeo (918-1392) and Joseon (1392-1910) periods, hanbok underwent various changes in terms of fashion, and the form that has been known since the time of Joseon. Koreans carefully consider their national identity in the Sirhak or \u201cPractical Learning\u201d movement of the 17th and 18th centuries, and in fashion, as in other fields, whatever was imported or influenced by foreign factors was subsequently Koreanized.\nIn the Joseon period, most attire was unified, and most Koreans dressed in a similar way. Even so, differences in social status appeared in slight differences of design, material, and decoration, so that Koreans in those days could indirectly recognize the class, rank, educational level, and character of the owner of it by fashion style. Although the basic shape was somewhat similar, we can also tell the season that appeared in paintings from this period by the material that is used in clothing and the use of seasonal attire.\nComponents of Hanbok.\nHanbok consists of various components. The most famous ones are Jeogori, Chima, and Baji. Jeogori is a shirts or a jacket for both of female and male. Chima is a skirt which is usually worn full. Men usually wore Jeogori and baggy pants called Baji. Women wore the ensemble of Jeogori and Chima.\nJeogori and Chima are the basic form of hanbok for females, and Baji and Jeogori were for men. But there are other garments of hanbok. There are Jokki, Magoja and Po. Jokki is a vest, Magoja is an outer jacket and Po is an overall outher robe or overcoat.\nThere are accessories and headdresses that go together with hanbok. Women wore a wig, called Gache. As in the West, the bigger and heavier the wigs were, the more elegant they were. But this heavy wig (Gache) was popular until the 19th century, after which time simple the Gache was preferred to heavier ones due to Confucian values. Women also had a long pin, called Binyeo. It was thrust though the knotted hair of a woman. Various patterns were carved on binyeo, and it was often made of Jade.\nKinds of Hanbok.\nTraditionally, Korean people have various kinds of hanbok for different purposes. There were hanboks for men, women, royal court, government officials, children and special ceremonies, like wedding and funeral. Men\u2019s and women\u2019s everyday hanboks were the basic forms.\nThe men's jacket is designed to be long because sleeves were added, and not to make the front part open, the two sides of front jacket overlap. The neck is gathered up into a collar with a white collar strip folded around the neckline. Breast-ties hold the two sides of the jacket together so that one side is overlapping the other. Until the mid Joseon period, the breast-ties were short and thin and merely perform its practical purposes to fasten the two sides of the jacket, but in the late Joseon era, they became longer and thicker, showing decorative aspect quite far from their practical usage. The male costume could include a gown similar to a topcoat which the wearer puts over the jacket and pants, with different sorts of hats and coronets for a noble effect. People chose different gowns from time to time depending on the occasion. Although the generous cut of the men's clothes emphasized the individuality of the wearer, the belt framed the upper body for a tidy shape or fit. The typical male costume in those days is the gentleman's outfit of white or light green gown and black hat. The harmony of black and white indicates a well-rounded and rational intelligence and a dignified character. A different girdle in terms of color on the chest adds variety to the contrast of black and white, which could otherwise look serious and solemn.\nThe women's hanbok includes a jacket and skirt; the men's has a jacket and pants. The clothes for females and males have an optional gown for added formality. The jackets of men and women are similar in shape, their length and the color is different. The women's costume consists of a jacket and skirt with a sleeveless waistcoat and a gown worn when needed to look formal. Ceremonial attire can be decorated with various ornaments including coronets, bridal headpieces, hairpins, and pendants. The upper garment fits neatly while the lower garment is more voluminous and wide, and women usually wear various kinds of underwear under the chima (lower garment, the skirt). The women of that time valued chastity, and when they went out, they covered their faces with a shawl or cloak which would prevent them from being exposed to the outside world. They used a variety of colors and designs when they chose ornaments, often standing for the cherished hopes of the age: long life and happiness, prosperity and posterity.\nRecent Hanbok.\nMore than three decades ago, hanbok, a traditional form of Korean clothing, was popular. Like all clothing, hanbok also changed as time has gone by with fluctuating fashion trends. Hanbok designs have changed a lot as they have passed throughout Korea's turbulent history. The hanbok we freely wear and see these days is reminiscent of the late Joseon Dynasty (early 20th century).\nCurved features are important in traditional hanbok design. As they are not designed to be tight fitting, the inherent beauty of hanbok is apparent in its elegance and style generated by the abundance of material. The curves, lines and vivid colors of hanbok have affected the Korean fashion industry. By mixing traditional dress with modern fashion, a series of fusion hanbok designs appeared. Designs, patterns and styles of hanbok have even been used to architecture.\nAlthough these days the hanbok has become the ritual dress of choice worn only on traditional holidays, Koreans' love for hanbok is still great. Famous Korean classic dramas are making many foreigners take more interest in traditional Korean clothing as well.\nRecently, some high schools have adopted Hanbok as their school uniforms. One of the most prestigious high schools in Korea, Korean Minjok Leadership Academy, is famous for its school uniform, which is a modified hanbok. Moreover, Korean people nowadays modify their traditional clothing, hanbok, to make it more wearable. The vivid colors, shapes, curved lines, materials of hanbok are used for designing fashionable clothing in Korea, these days.\nReferences.\nhttp://kin.naver.com/knowhow/detail.nhn?d1id=10&amp;dirId=10&amp;docId=534155&amp;qb=TW9yZSB0aGFuIHRocmVlIGRlY2FkZXMgYWdvLCBoYW5ib2ssIGEgdHJhZGl0aW9uYWwgZm9ybSBvZiBLb3JlYW4gY2xvdGhpbmc=&amp;enc=utf8&amp;section=kin&amp;rank=1&amp;sort=0&amp;spq=0\nhttp://www.mcst.go.kr/main.jsp"}

He was the younger son of Vologases V who died in 209. Artabanus rebelled against his brother Vologases VI, and soon gained the upper hand, although Vologases VI maintained himself in a part of Babylonia until about 228. \nThe Roman emperor Caracalla, wanted to make use of this civil war for a conquest of the East and attacked the Parthians in 216. He crossed the Tigris and destroyed the towns, but when Artabanus advanced at the head of an army, he retired to Carrhae. There he was murdered by Martialis on April 8, 217. Caracalla's successor, the Praetorian Prefect of the Guard Macrinus, was defeated at Nisibis and in a peace with Artabanus he gave up all the Roman conquests and paid a heavy contribution to the Parthians. \nAt about this time, the Persian Great King Ardashir had already begun his conquests in Persia. When Artabanus tried to subdue him his troops were defeated. The war lasted several years; at last Artabanus himself was killed in 226. Thus the 400-year rule of the Arsacid Dynasty came to an end."}

Made from rice, it is a milky brew with an alcohol content of 6 to 7 percent. Rice, the main ingredient of it, is not sweet in itself, so Nuruk is also used to make it. Once boiled rice and Nuruk are mixed, the enzymes in Nuruk break down carbohydrates in rice into sugar. Then the sugar meets yeasts in Nuruk and there begins fermentation. Because the fermentation keeps on going, Makgeolli should be drunk as soon as possible once it is opened.\nIt has a long history. Ancient people made liquor with grains such as wheat and rice after they found the way to grow them. That is the beginning of it. There are some records about it. For example, a book written in Three Kingdoms of Korea, it says many people drank \u2018grain liquor.\u2019 Moreover, in a document about the brewing of Joesun Dynasty, there says Makgeolli had had long history and been considered as liquor of the folk. Made from newly harvested rice, it was regarded as sacred gift from God. In addition, it played an important role in religious event like praying ceremony for a year of abundance.\nCompared to other liquor, it is good for health. Abundant in protein and fiber, it affects to liver much less than any other alcohol. Rather it helps prevent cancer and heart disease. Similar to milk and yogurt, it has good effect on the health with its organic acids.\nThese days, demand on it is growing from USA and Japan, so exports are rising in Korea. Actually in Korea, most of the men who drank it were farmers or manual workers in 1970s. That\u2019s because it was replaced not only by soju but also by Western drinks such as beer or whisky. Recently, however, even young generations are more likely to drink it than before.\nReferences.\n- Yonhap News https://fitcrv.com/benefits-of-brown-rice/ "}

During the Weimar Republic he became known for his book and poster designs. Kurt Fiedler was an active member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany.\nLife.\nKurt Fiedler was born in the little village Eichbusch near Dresden as a son of a carpenter. Together with the later known painter Hermann Gl\u00f6ckner he attended around 1910 the evening classes of the Kunstgewerbeschule Dresden. The students were educated in an aesthetic style, which was propagated by Deutscher Werkbund. From 1911 to 1915 Fiedler got a grant to study as master scholar of Richard Guhr and Josef Goller. During World War I Fiedler served as front-line soldier in France. After the war, Ferdinand Avenarius introduced him to the D\u00fcrerbund. Fiedler lived in the house of this leading cultural organization in Blasewitz for about 20 years. For the social democratic newspaper \"Dresdner Volkszeitung\" he designed the masthead.\nThe Nazis hindered Kurt Fiedler because he was known as an active social democrat. During World War II Kurt Fiedler served as translator for French prisoners of war. He left army in 1942 because of poor health. Until the end of Nazi Germany he earned his money with technical drawings at the Dresden University of Technology. The home of Kurt Fiedler was completely destroyed during Bombing of Dresden in World War II on 13 February 1945. After the war, Kurt Fiedler belonged to the directorate of the association of fine arts in Dresden. He was artistic fellow worker of the Saxon regional board of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. As nearly all social democrats Fiedler became sidelined in following years.\nArtwork.\nFiedler worked for the leading publishing houses of Dresden. \"B.G. Teubner\", \"Theodor Steinkopff-Verlag\", \"Wilhelm-Limpert-Verlag\", \"Buchdruckerei der Dr. G\u00fcntz'schen Stiftung\" and \"Rudolph'sche Verlagsbuchhandlung\" were known nationwide. Fiedler designed books on astronomy for the D\u00fcrerbund and the local planetarium. Especially known were his cover illustrations for adventure stories of the famous circus Sarrasani. Some of the books for \"Talisman-B\u00fccherei\" of Rudolph were banned by the Nazis. They were bound to the New Thought movement.\nOn occasion of the World Advertising Congress 1929 in Berlin, Fiedler was awarded for his poster design. Some important posters were \"Hiertstein - Katzenstein Gebiet\", \"Riesen-Auftakt 43. Bundesfest Bund Deutscher Radfahrer\" for the German Cycling Federation, and \"200 Jahre Dresdner Anzeiger\" on occasion of the jubilee of the first newspaper of Dresden. After 1930 Fiedler became known for some of his drawings, especially of children.\nFiedler counts today as one of the leading poster artists of post-war East Germany. Many of his works can be found in Deutsches Historisches Museum, Akademie der K\u00fcnste and the German Federal Archive. Among his best known pieces of that period is \"Junkerland in Bauernhand\", a movie poster designed for the DEFA. The \"German national picture archive of arts\" at the University of Marburg documents 34 of his posters from that time."}

He was Secretary of State for Defence from 1964 to 1970 and Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1974 to 1979.\nEarly life.\nHealey was born in Mottingham, Kent, and moved with his family to Keighley in the West Riding of Yorkshire when he was five years old. He was given the middle name \"Winston\" after Winston Churchill, who was an important politician at the time Denis was born.\nHealey was one of three children. Their father was an engineer who had worked his way up by taking extra lessons at night school. \nHealey went to Bradford Grammar School, and in 1936 he won a type of scholarship known as an \"exhibition\", which gave him enough money to take a degree at Balliol College, Oxford. At Oxford University he got involved in politics, and he joined the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1937. In 1939, not liking the party's policies, he changed his mind. From that time on, he supported the Labour Party, even though one of his best friends at university, Edward Heath, supported the Conservative Party. \nPolitical career.\nAfter getting his degree, Healey joined the Royal Engineers, and served in the British forces in several countries during World War II. He took an important part in the Battle of Anzio, towards the end of the war. After the war, he joined the Labour Party, and made an important speech to the Labour Party conference in 1945, shortly before the United Kingdom general election, 1945. \nIn February 1952, Healey became the Member of Parliament for Leeds South East. He supported Hugh Gaitskell, the leader of the Labour Party. When Gaitskell died in 1963, Healey became a supporter of Harold Wilson.

Board of Education\" partially overturned the \"Plessy v.

He challenged the Louisiana law, saying it was against the United States Constitution. Plessy argued that the state law which required East Louisiana Railroad to segregate trains had denied him his rights under the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\nThe Decision.\nThe Supreme Court, in a 7-1 decision, ruled that the Louisiana law was valid. They said that requiring whites and blacks to ride in separate trains did not harm blacks in any way. Justice John Marshall Harlan was the only justice who thought the law was against the Constitution. He thought segregation made black Americans feel inferior. He said that the Constitution is \"color blind\" and that the law should not treat any group better than any other group.\n\"Brown\" and \"Plessy\".\nIn 1954, the United States Supreme Court made it illegal to segregate schools by race.

Segregation in other places was still legal. This means that Brown overturned \"part\" of \"Plessy v. Ferguson\" by making school segregation illegal, but it did not overturn the entire law."}

The school first started in 1901 when American Presbyterian missionaries came to the Philippines after the war between America and Spain ended. Because of this, Silliman became the first Protestant and American private school in the country. It is also the oldest university founded by Americans in Asia. At first, they started it as an elementary school for boys. But later on, it became a college, and then into a university. The man who was first sent by the Presbyterians to start the school was David Sutherland Hibbard, a pastor from Lyndon, Kansas. On the other hand, the one who gave the money to start it was Horace Brinsmade Silliman, a businessman from Cohoes, New York. Thankful for what Silliman did, the Presbyterians named the school after him.\nToday, Silliman has ten colleges, four schools, and two institutes. Its students come from different parts of the Philippines, as well as from other parts of the world (more than 20 different countries). Silliman offers early childhood, elementary, high school, and college education. In college, Silliman teaches many things such as Accountancy, Business Administration, Engineering, Information Technology, Law, Medicine, Nursing, Biology, Chemistry, Education, Marine Sciences, Physics, Theology, Philosophy, Psychology, and Public Administration among others. Those who want to take up masters and doctorate courses can also find these in Silliman. Aside from teaching, Silliman is also involved in activities called \"extension projects\" that help people and different communities.\nCampus.\nSilliman is in Dumaguete City, beside the sea. It has 116,392 people. Silliman has two campuses. One is along Hibbard Avenue, called the main campus, and the other is beside the Silliman Beach, two kilometers from the main campus, known as the College of Agriculture and Marine Lab campus. The main campus has a land area of 33hectares (330,000 m\u00b2) and contains most of Silliman's colleges, schools and institutes. The College of Agriculture and Marine Lab Campus on the other hand has a land area of 29hectares (290,000 m\u00b2). It has a farm, a place for students to live in called dormitories, and other buildings of the College of Agriculture. Located beside the College is the Marine Laboratory and the Silliman Beach.\nSilliman also has facilities in other places. One of these is in Valencia, Negros Oriental (East Negros) and is presently called the Camp Lookout Facility. It is on top of a hill. Silliman \"Writers' Village\" is there. The village has a main building called a function hall and five small apartments called cottages which are all designed to host the annual Silliman National Writers Workshop.\nThe other facility not on campus is the Ticao Island facility. This facility has a land area of 465hectares and is on another island (Ticao Island) in a province called Masbate. This facility is basically a ranch and a farm, with some areas being covered by forests. Silliman has many plans for this facility, and because it wants to let the people around the area know what these plans are, the university has shown it to them to see if they like it or not.\nAdministration.\nThe people who run the University are called the Board of Trustees. Sometimes, they are simply called the Board. They represent different sectors of the university. These sectors are the alumni, the Silliman University Foundation Incorporated (SUFI), and the United Church of Christ in the Philippines (UCCP). Each of these sectors are represented by five members. All in all, the Board has fifteen members. The Board can't work alone, and so they are assisted by many persons. These persons are the University President, the Vice-President for Academic Affairs, Vice-President for Finance, the University Registrar, Treasurer and Auditor as well as the Manager for Human Resource (HRD). Since these persons also have a lot of things to do and think about, they are also assisted by other people called Deans, Directors, Department Chairpersons, Coordinators and Unit Heads of the different colleges, schools, institutes, units, research centers, programs and extension projects of the University.\nAcademic Units.\nSilliman is divided or organized into academic units called colleges, schools and institutes. These units teach different things. These units are:"}
{"id": "216456", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=216456", "title": "Yut", "text": "Yut is a traditional Korean board game played mainly during the period from Korean New Year to the first full moon. \"Cheok-sa\" and \"sa-hee\" are the other names of the game. Its origin is not clear, but it seems that the game was started from the age of ancient Korea called Three-Kingdoms. The game is played by throwing four sticks, and moving marks on the board according to shapes of the sticks that fell down. During Korean New Year, many people play the game because it can be enjoyed anywhere by players of any age.\nTools.\nThe equipment of the game consists of a board, four yut sticks, and four marks, called \"mal\", per each team. The board, which is normally rectangular shaped, is made of various materials like stitched cloth, paper, or leather. It includes a circle with a cross in the center, and 28 circles around this cross. The sticks determine how far a \"mal\" can advance. The stick has two sides; one is round, and the other flat. It is usually made of wood from chestnut trees. Players can move their \"mal\" from one circle to another, based on the results that their sticks indicate. Any item can be used for a \"mal\", if it can be distinguished from the \"mal\" of opposite teams. \nRules.\nThe facing of the sticks after being thrown indicate the movements of each team\u2019s \"mal\". There are five possibilities: \"do, gae, geol, yut\", and \"mo\", meaning five livestock, pigs, dogs, cow, sheep, and horses. \"Do\", when the flat side of only one stick faces upward, means a one-step advance. When two flat sides are up, it means \"gae\", which is a two-step advance. \"Geol\" is three flat sides up, which is a three-step advance, and \"yut\", where all four sticks are lying flat side up, means a four-step advance. When all four sticks face round side up, it is \"mo\" which means a five-step advance. Each team normally throw the sticks in turn, but players get one more chance to throw the sticks when they throw a \"yut\" or \"mo\".\nPlayers can move only one \"mal\" per each movement, unless \"mals\" are grouped in one. When a \"mal\" reaches the big circles in the center, or reaches the others in each corner, players can move their \"mal\" in a shortcut. There are four possible routes to move \"mal\" when considering shortcuts. When a \"mal\" reaches a circle that is already occupied by a \"mal\" of an opposing team, the \"mal\" of the opposing team is captured by the new mal, and must restart from the starting point. If a mal lands on a circle with another mal of same team, the two mals can make a group, and move together. The first team causing all of their mals to reach the starting point again becomes the winner of game."}

It is a Korean-style pasta soup consisting of hand-torn dough flakes with various vegetables and has been eaten from the early Goryeo period. In ancient times, when the Korea people were poor, they didn't have much foodstuffs and so made \"sujebi\" with small quantity of dough and leftover vegetables. In addition, rice was rare after the Korean War, so many people ate sujebi instead of rice because wheat flour was cheaper at that time. However, \"sujebi\" with various kinds of ingredients was considered a special food, so it was eaten on special days like a celebration day or feast. Nowadays, there are many kinds of sujebi and many people enjoy it as a health food. It is similar to another Korean traditional food \"Kalguksu\", but \"Kalsuksu\" is made with noodles while \"sujebi\" is made with wheat flakes. Both of them are considered as proper food for a rainy day due to its hot and rich flavored broth. It is usually eaten with kimchi.\nOrigin.\nIt was during the mid Joseon period that \"sujebi\" was named. Its name was originally came from Chinese letter \u624b(su, \uc218) meaning \u2018hand\u2019 and \u647a(jeop, \uc811) meaning \u2018folding\u2019. The pronunciation has been changed as time passes for the ease of articulation. It is called differently depending on the regions, but sujebi is the standard word and most commonly used.\nClassification.\nGenerally, there are two kinds of \"sujebi\" depending on the type of broth. One is with Korean clear soup, and the other is with seaweed soup. In the former one, dough flakes are roughly torn by hand, whereas in the latter one, dough flakes are round shaped. This round-shaped dough is called \"Saeal\"(\uc0c8\uc54c in Korean). When people order or make \"sujebi\", it usually refers to the former one in Korea. Then, it is again classified as various types depending on other ingredients. Typically, there are \"potato sujebi\" which includes potatoes and \"seafood sujebi\" with seafood. However, many restaurants are making new sujebi variations to attract customers these days."}

It is normally served cut into squares or rectangles. It can be eaten as a snack, or with ice cream or whipped cream as a dessert.\nOrigin.\nThere is no clear record of how brownies were first made. They were first made in the late 1880s. The first known recipe for brownies was in the 1897 Sears, Roebuck Catalogue. The most popular story about the origin of the brownie is about a housewife in Bangor, Maine. It says that the house wife forgot to add baking powder to a chocolate cake she was making. The cake did not rise but it was still delicious. Chocolate brownies are also very popular dessert in the United Kingdom.\nTypes of brownies.\nThere are different types of brownie. They are either chewy or cake-like depending on the recipe. Sometimes nuts or chocolate chips are added, or icing or caramel is put on top. A brownie with brown sugar and no chocolate are sometimes called a blondie. Sometimes, brownies are crackled on top, which means the inside is extra soft. "}

A popular writer in her time, her work has received even more attention from literary critics in recent years. She has influenced such writers as Neil Gaiman, Stephen King, Nigel Kneale and Richard Matheson.\nLife.\nBorn Shirley Hardie Jackson in San Francisco in 1916 to Leslie and Geraldine Jackson, Shirley and her family lived in Burlingame, California, an wealthy middle-class suburb. Shirley spent most of her early life in California. The Jackson family then moved to Rochester, New York, where Shirley attended Brighton High School and graduated in 1934. For college, she first attended the University of Rochester before graduating from Syracuse University in 1940. \nShe got married in 1940 to Stanley Edgar Hyman who met in campus literary magazine, literary critic, and have four children who are Laurence (Laurie), Joanne (Jannie), Sarah (Sally), and Barry. The Hyman family lived in Vermont, in a quiet rural community and far away from city life. In 1965, Shirley Jackson died of heart failure in her sleep at the age of 48. Shirley suffered all through her life from various neuroses and psychosomatic illness. These illnesses, along with the various prescription drugs used to treat them, overweight and heavy smoking, may have led to her declining health and early death.\nLiterary works.\nShe is best known for \"The Lottery\" (1948), which suggests a deeply unsettling dark underside in human nature who lives in suburban small-town in America. This is easily the best adaptation of the famed Shirley Jackson short story, first published in The New Yorker (June 28, 1948). Jackson may even have taken pleasure in the destructive impact of her work, as evidenced by Hyman's statement that she \"was always proud that the Union of South Africa banned \"The Lottery\", and she felt that they at least understood the story. Larry Yust made this story into a short film which was banned in Boston.\nWith information for Jackson's first novel, \"The Road Through the Wall\" (1948), her husband who also is a literary critic, described Shirley Jackson as someone who practiced witchcraft. Shirley later wrote about witchcraft accusations in her book for young readers, \"The Witchcraft of Salem Village\" (1956).\nHer other novels include \"Hangsaman\" (1951), \"The Bird's Nest\" (1954), \"The Sundial\" (1958) and The \"Haunting of Hill House\" (1959), regarded by many as one of the important horror novels of the 20th Century. \nWhen the Hymans eventually settled in Vermont, Shirley continued to publish novels and short stories while caring for their children Laurence, Joanne, Sarah and Barry. Eventually her four children would come to their own brand of literary characters as fictionalized versions of themselves in their mother's short stories; In a series of the short stories, later collected in the books \"Life Among the Savages\" and \"Raising Demons\", she presented a fictionalized version of her marriage and the experience of raising four children. \nIn addition to her adult literary novels, Shirley also wrote a children's novel, \"Nine Magic Wishes\" as well as a children's play based on \"Hansel and Gretel\" and entitled The \"Bad Children\".\nShirley Jackson Awards.\nThe first annual Shirley Jackson Awards for \"outstanding achievement in the literature of psychological suspense, horror and the dark fantastic\" were presented July 20, 2008. The jurors were John Langan, Sarah Langan, Paul G. Tremblay and F. Brett Cox. \nThe winners were:"}

Apple could now control app quality and add extra pricing to the already set cost of an app. A day later, the iPhone 3G was launched and it came with iOS 2.0.1.

The new feature allowed publishers to sell content directly through their apps, allowing users to receive new content over specified periods of time.\nDuring Apple's 2012 Worldwide Developer's Conference, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that the App Store has 400 million accounts with registered credit cards, 650,000 available apps to download and \"an astounding 30 billion apps\" downloaded from the app store.\nWhen the iPhone 5 was launched, Apple changed the look of the App Store, as well as the iTunes Store and iBookstore, as part of iOS 6.\nOn January 7, 2013, Apple announced that there have been over 40 billion apps downloaded from their iOS App Store, with about half of those coming in 2012.\nOn February 1, 2013, Apple told developers that they could begin using appstore.com for links to their apps.\nIn September 2013, Apple announced at its Worldwide Developers Conference the addition of a Kids category to the App Store with the launch of iOS 7. The category is split by age range and apps made for children under 13 must follow the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).\nAs of the end of 2013, App Store users spent over US$10 billion in 2013, and users downloaded almost three billion apps in December 2013. This was the most successful month in App Store history, and developers have earned over $15 billion since the making of the App Store.\nNumber of launched applications.\nOn July 10, 2008, Apple CEO Steve Jobs told \"USA Today\" that the App Store contained 500 non-Apple applications for the iPhone and the iPod Touch, and of these 25\u00a0percent were free. These applications range from business to game applications, entertainment to educational applications, and many more. On July 11, 2008, the store opened, allowing users to buy applications and put them on an iPhone or iPod Touch with iOS 2.0. Ten million applications were downloaded the first weekend.\nOn January 16, 2009, Apple said on its website that 500\u00a0million applications had been downloaded. The billionth application was downloaded on April 23, 2009. In March 2012, the number of apps downloaded reached 25\u00a0billion.\nUnlike the apps that come standard on the iPhone, apps downloaded from the App Store can be removed by the user at any time.\niPad applications.\nThe iPad was launched in April 2010 with over 3000 applications made for it. About eight months after the release of the iPad, over 50,000 apps were available for it.\nAs of July 2011, 16 months after the iPad launched, there were over 100,000 apps available at the App Store made for the device.\nBy the end of November 2011, Apple advertised in a holiday newsletter of the online Apple Store there are more than 140,000 iPad apps available.\nAs of January 7, 2013, there were more than 300,000 native iPad apps available for users.\nAs of October 22, 2013, there were more than 475,000 native iPad apps available for users.\nMost popular apps.\nAs of July 2021, these are the most installed App Store apps of all time\nApplication ratings.\nApple rates apps worldwide based on their content, and gives the app an age group for which is appropriate. The following are the ratings that Apple has detailed:\nApp approval process.\nApple must review all applications before they can enter the App Store for users to download.\n, Apple used a method of reviewing apps which had flaws, and this meant that some bad apps could get past the review process.\nAccording to Apple statistics 62% of common app rejections occur due to the regular non-compliance with the main Apple guidelines.\nControversial apps.\nMany times, Apple has removed apps because they did not follow the Apple policies for apps.\nIn November 2012, Boyfriend Maker, a dating sim game, was removed due to \"reports of references to violent sexual acts and paedophilia\" which were not appropriate to Boyfriend Maker's age rating of 4+. A modified version named Boyfriend Maker Plus was approved by Apple in April 2013.\nOn March 11, 2013, HiddenApps was approved and appeared in the App Store. This app allowed access to special developer-only menus, could allow built-in apps to be hidden, and an option to turn off iAds, Apple's ad system.\nNational limitations.\nWhile Apple wants the App Store to be available worldwide, their market is restricted to country borders. Different countries have slightly different app stores. Some apps may only be available on the app stores of a few countries, while others can be available in many countries. Trying to use an app store of one country while in another may be a problem: Apple warns that \"one of the risks of creating a German account while you are in Greece is, our system may able to detect it and it may put restrictions on your account (German) that will prevent you from using the iTunes Store\".\nSimilar services for other devices.\nOther mobile devices have other app stores available for them. Some of these are made by the company that made the device, but not all are that way. Amazon.com has the Amazon Appstore for all Android users. The Google Play store (was known as Android Market) is the official store for Google's Android devices. In 2010, Microsoft created the Windows Phone Store, an online market for their Windows Phone devices. In October 2012, the Windows Store was made for Windows 8 and Windows RT computers.\nNokia also has the Ovi Store, for Nokia devices. BlackBerry has an app store named BlackBerry World. BlackBerry 10 users do not have to use BlackBerry World, they are allowed to use other app stores as well.\nGame consoles, such as the Nintendo DSi, also have their own online stores. The DSi has the \"DSi Shop\", while the Sony PSP (PlayStation Portable) and the PlayStation Vita have the PlayStation Store."}

{"id": "216638", "revid": "7878685", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=216638", "title": "Trans woman", "text": "A trans woman (sometimes spelled as trans-woman or transwoman) is a male-to-female (MTF) transsexual or transgender person. Many people in this group like the name \"trans woman\" over the many medical terms that are out there. Other non-medical names are t-girl, tg-girl, and ts-girl. Transgender woman, though, is the more common name.\nSome people who are assigned male at birth later identify as women. They feel that the gender they were assigned and the gender they actually are do not match. Some trans women want to simply be called \"women\" rather than being called a \"trans\" woman, but this does not apply to all trans women.\nOutline.\n\"Transitioning\" refers to the act of changing a person's social and personal gender identity to the gender identity that they feel is their real self, and may or may not include having medical treatments done, or surgery, and the changing of their legal papers to show their new identity (such as their birth certificate) and changing the way that they dress.\nChanging.\nLike trans men, trans women have many choices that they can make, depending on what culture they are in and what gender roles they, and the people who support them feel like they should have. No case is the same, and the options that are there for trans women depend very much on if they have easy access to medical care and money. Some trans women choose to have hair removed on their face, armpits and other parts of their body as well as train their voice so that it sounds more like a woman. There are surgeries that can make trans women's faces look more female, but may not always be necessary, as some trans women have faces that do not look very male. They are mainly to provide emotional benefits to patients so that they can see themselves changing or as a step in sexual reassignment surgery.\nSome trans women who feel that their gender change is done, meaning that they have all the same physical characteristics of women who were assigned female at birth, want to just be called \"women\". They think that the names \"transwoman\" or \"male-to-female\" should only be used for people who have not finished their change. Some others do not feel that their gender ever changed and that they were always girls who were forced to live as boys. Because of this many see it as important to include a space in the name, as in \"trans woman\", using \"trans\" as a word to talk about a particular type of woman, not a \"third gender\" as \"transwoman\" might imply.\nSexual interests.\nThe story of the young boy who is very much like a young girl and grows up to live life as a woman has a very long history. It is commonly, but wrongly, thought that all transgender and transsexual women are straight (attracted to males). Many studies on this issue have been thought to be hurt by bias, since many transsexuals feel they must give the \"right\" answers to such questions to help their chances of being able to get hormone therapy. 35% of trans women are lesbians.\nSome do not pay attention to trans women identifying as women and continue to view them as men, calling trans women who feel attracted to men \"homosexual\" and trans women that are attracted to women as \"nonhomosexual\". This is sometimes seen as rude to the trans women that they are studying.\nSex drive.\nStudies have shown that trans women are likely to have less sex drive (34%) than those who are born female (23%), but the difference was small.\nDisputes over sports eligibility.\nSome governing bodies for sports allow trans women to compete in female-only sports and some do not.Opponents believe that growing up with a male body (usually larger and stronger) gives trans women unfair advantages.Trans women have set women's records for sports that some biological women believe should not count.High school athletes who have routinely lost to trans athletes have sued to have trans competitors excluded as unfair competition for scholarships designated for women. The American Civil Liberties Union sides with the trans athletes.\nDisputes over prisons.\nTrans women convicted of crimes often believe they are not safe in men's prisons.Some women believe they are not safe in women's prisons if trans women are allowed there.\nTransition has been used as grounds for releasing prisoners for crimes committed as men."}

{"id": "216658", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=216658", "title": "Magnum Crimen", "text": "\"Magnum crimen: pola vijeka klerikalizma u Hrvatskoj\" (i.e. \"Major accusation: Half a century of clericalism in Croatia\") is a book first published in Zagreb in 1948. The book was written by a Croatian Roman Catholic priest, Dr. Viktor Novak (1889 - 1977), who was also a professor at Belgrade and Zagreb Universities, and the member of the Yugoslav Academy Science and Arts. In this book, Novak wrote about (Roman Catholic) clericalism in Croatia from the beginning of the 20th century to the end of World War II.\nThe Vatican Curia placed the book on their list of banned books, the \"Index librorum prohibitorum\", and said that Novak was an enemy of the Catholic Church.\nThe book.\nForeword.\nNovak wrote that he spent more than 40 years collecting documents and books to write his book. He started collecting this material during his secondary school days, continued it as a university student, and as a member of the Austrian Institute of History in Vienna, Austria, then as a university professor in Zagreb and Belgrade. He worked on three books, of which \"Magnum crimen\" is the last, the first two parts of are the \"Magnum tempus\" and the \"Magnum sacerdos\". In 1941, after the destruction and occupation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, Novak was forced to destroy all material he had collected. He was in danger of being arrested and killed by the German occupying forces and their collaborators in Belgrade. He was among the first ten people arrested in Belgrade by Germans, but managed to survive and continue work on this book after liberation of Belgrade in October 1944.\nNovak dedicates this book to the victims (known and unknown as well) of the clero-fascism.\nObserving the Roman Catholic Church activities in Yugoslavia for more than fifty years, the author concludes that this Church replaced the idea of service to God by service to the Roman Curia, i.e. service to the government of the Roman Pontificate in the role of the world leader. As a result of this idea, in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the Roman Catholic Church identified the Roman Catholicism to the Croatian nationhood, which turned most of its priesthood into ardent Ustashe supporters.\nChapters I - XVIII.\nThe book describes activities of the Roman Catholic clergy in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, including their intention and attempts to become above the state, to control the state and eventually everyday lives of the common people. It has two distinct parts. The first part consists of fifteen chapters, covering the Roman Catholic clericalism from the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century in Austria-Hungary, then in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The second part, the last four chapters, covers the rise and fall of the Independent State of Croatia, and the active support of the Roman Catholic Church clergy.\nThe main doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was that&lt;br&gt;(a) the clergy shall be paid by the state as the state officials; &lt;br&gt;(b) the state cannot have any control over the Church; &lt;br&gt;(c) the Church has right to be fully involved in the political life of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia; &lt;br&gt;(d) the Church doctrine/religious education shall be a part of primary and secondary school curricula; and that &lt;br&gt;(e) the Roman Catholic Church curricula in the schools shall be obligatory to all pupils whose at least one parent is a Roman Catholic.\nTo achieve these goals, the Church supported clerical political parties, confronting them to other confessions, primarily to the Serbian Orthodox Church, by publicly preaching hatred against the Orthodox population and advocating Croatian and Slovene separatism and intolerance against others.\nJosip Juraj Strossmayer's ideas, of which the most important one was - serving God equals to serving people, created close relations between Croats and Serbs by introducing the Old Slavonic language as the liturgy language of the Roman Catholic Church in the Balkans - were aggressively suppressed by the Roman Catholic clergy in Croatia and Slovenia. The clergy put the Roman Curia in between the God and the people, demanding from the Roman Catholics ultimate obedience to the Roman Curia and unconditional love of the Roman Pope. The clergy remaining faithful to the Strossmayer was marginalized, with the most ardent supporters excommunicated by the Zagreb archbishop.\nNevertheless, Strossmayer was embraced as a great Roman Catholic bishop by the same clergy - but his teaching was distorted or not mentioned ever. The same destiny faced Franjo Ra\u010dki, Ante Trumbi\u0107, and Stjepan Radi\u0107 - three Croatian politicians advocating actively and fighting for the Yugoslavism - as a common denominator of togetherness and life among the Slavic people of the kingdom of Yugoslavia. The Trumbi\u0107 and Radi\u0107's struggle against centralism was interpreted as the Croatian and Slovene separatism support.\nNovak demonstrated that even the anti-Croatian activities in the Italian Croatian and Slovene lands (as compensation for their aid in World War I) were not counteracted by the Croatian and Slovene Roman Catholic clergy in Yugoslavia. Expulsion of the Croatian and Slovene clergy from these lands and their replacement by the Italians was received with silence and accepted without resistance or protest among their Catholic brethren in Yugoslavia.\nAnte Paveli\u0107's political activities in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the Ustashe terrorism, and the embracement of fascism were all supported by the Roman Catholic clergy. Paveli\u0107's nationalism identified Roman Catholicism to the Croatdom, which was actively supported and interpreted by the clergy.\nThe second part of this book is about the beginning of the Independent State of Croatia, the active support of the Roman Catholic clergy to this state, and their involvement and support in the extermination and/or forceful conversion of the Serbs and extermination of the Jews and the Roma people. The book is full of testimonies and documents showing the active involvements of the Catholic clergy in supporting, organizing, and executing extermination of Serbs, Jews, and Roma people of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. One of the most bizarre events described was that Roman Catholic priests in the Jasenovac concentration camp working every day on the most gruesome ways to kill the camp inmates, while they went to chapel regularly each day to pray to God.\nAt the end of World War II, the Catholic clergy defended themselves, claiming their opposition to forceful conversion and extermination in some letters and instructions directed to the priesthood. The book notes that these letters and directions were not public and not respected or followed. In fact, an article from \"Novi list\"' argued that a Jew could not be save by converting to the Roman Catholicism.\nArchbishop Aloysius Stepinac is portrayed in this book as an ardent Roman Catholic crusader who publicly endorsed the establishment of the Independent State of Croatia, acknowledged the Ustashe as Croatian patriots, defended her before the Roman Pope and was responsible for the racist attitude and behavior of his clergy.\nEnglish language edition [2011].\nThis edition, except from being an English language translation of the 1948 edition, contains two new chapters - \"XIV. Ecclesia militants at war with the ideology of Tyr\u0161\", and \"XV. Libellus accusations\", both omitted in the original version under the pressure of Josip Broz Tito's OZNA chief Maks Ba\u0107e.\nChapter XIV is about the Sokol (\"Falcon\") Society, founded in Prague in 1862 by Jind\u0159ich F\u00fcgner and Miroslav Tyr\u0161. The goal of the Sokol Society was to revive and enhance the national awareness and promote mental and physical health of the Czech people through sports and moral education. The idea soon gained a pan-Slavic character, and Sokol organizations were later established in Croatia, Slovenia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Poland, and Russia. The Sokol movement had full support from Strossmayer, then Bishop of \u0110akovo. After the dissolution of Austria-Hungary and the establishment of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes in 1918, and under the leadership of Lazar Car, Croatian Sokol societies were united with Serbian and Slovenian Sokol clubs into a large Sokol Alliance on 15 June 1919.\nThe separatism-prone Croatian clergy forced Croatian Sokols to leave the \"Yugoslav Sokol Alliance\" in 1919\u201320, fueling internal conflicts within the Alliance on political grounds. At the same time, high Catholic clergy established the Orlovi (\"Eagles\") clerical organization with the aim of taking youths away from the Alliance. The Croatian Catholic Church rejected the pan-Slavic idea of bringing together Catholic, Orthodox, and Muslim believers under the motto that \"a brother is dear regardless of his faith\". The two Catholic organizations, Orlovi (\"Eagles\") and Katoli\u010dka Akcija (\"Catholic Action\") were a main base of this resistance to the idea of Yugoslavism, brotherhood and religious tolerance. The Catholic Church's resistance to this idea of pan-Slavism led the Polish Sokols to abstain from the international \"All Sokol Rally\" held in Prague in 1926.\nChapter XV, titled \"Libellus Accusations\", is about a few Croatian clergymen who were followers of Strossmayer's idea (namely, that to serve people means to serve God). The most prominent among them was Frano Ivani\u0161evi\u0107, a national fighter and promoter of Old Slavonic Church language as the language of liturgy in the Croatian Catholic Church. He demonstrated that a Catholic priest serving his people would not be against his Church and faith.\nThe book as an academic reference.\nAmong scholars-historians this book is accepted as a serious academic reference and as such - cited and referenced a great number of times . That way the book became a reference book in the libraries of many universities around the globe .\nThe earliest surveys of this book are the ones of Russian S. Troicky (as of the 1949 year - see the link) and of Swede O. Neumann. Neumann stressed three things particular to this book: the role of V. Novak in spreading and defending the idea of Yugoslavism, abundance of the documentation used to support the book content, and that \"Some passages have been written by a scholar in a dignified academic gown, in other parts of the book the author assumes the role of public prosecutor.\" The abridged edition of this book published in 1960 is reviewed in the Istorijski glasnik and the same review echoed in the Historical abstracts.\nA number of short notes about this book can be found - scattered in the works related to this period of history. Some are neutral and some rejective and disapproving.\nThe most recent, 2011 English language edition, was published in two volumes, and includes two chapters which had been excluded from all earlier editions of this book, which, according to Serbian historian Vasilije Kresti\u0107, were censored upon the request of two Croatian communist leaders, Vladimir Bakari\u0107 and Maks Ba\u0107e.

The city is famous for being the capital of the Mughal emperors from 1526 to 1658. It is a major tourist destination for its many Mughal-era buildings such as T\u0101j Mahal, Agra Fort and Fatehp\u016br Sikr\u012b, all three of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\nClimate.\nAgra is on the Indo-Gangetic plain and has a continental climate, with long, hot summers from April to September. During summers dry winds blow in this region. The monsoon months from July to September see about 69 cm of rainfall annually. Winters are from November to February. Agra is best visited in the months of October, November, February and March, when the average temperature are between 16 and 25 Celsius.\nDemographic.\nIn the 2001 Indian census, Agra had a population of 1,326,000. Males consist of 53% of the population and females consist of 47% of the population. 11% of the population is under 6 years of age. The main language used by the people in Agra is Hindi followed by English and Urdu.\nHistory.\nAgra has a rich history, seen in the monuments around the city. Though the heritage of Agra city is linked with the Mughal dynasty, many other rulers also contributed to the rich past of this city. Modern Agra was founded by Sikandar Lodhi in the 16th century. Babar (founder of the Mughal dynasty) also stayed for sometime in Agra and introduced the concept of square Persian-styled gardens here. Emperor Akbar built the Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri near Agra. Fatehpur Sikri remained its capital for around fifteen years after which the city was left isolated in mysterious circumstances. Jahangir beautified Agra with palaces and gardens despite spending most of his time in Kashmir.\nAgra\u2018s greatest time came when Shahjahan ascended to the throne of Mughal Empire. He marked the greatest point of Mughal architecture. He built the Taj Mahal in memory of his favourite wife Mumtaz Mahal. In his later years, Shahjahan shifted his capital to the new city of Shahjahanabad(Delhi) and ruled from there. Shahjahan was removed in 1658 by his son, Aurangzeb who kept him as prisoner in the Agra Fort. Aurangzeb shifted the capital back to Agra before his death. After the death of Aurangzeb, Mughal Empire could not reach its peak and many regional kingdoms emerged. The post-Mughal era of Agra saw the rule of the Jats, Marathas and finally the British taking over the city. After British Raj ended, Agra became part of independent India.\nLocal transportation.\nAuto Rickshaw and Cycle Rickshaw are the main transportations in Agra and are available all around the city.\nThere are City buses but they are infrequent.\nPolluting vehicles are not allowed near Taj Mahal, so one needs to take electric Autos or Tanga(Tonga) from a few kilometers outside the Taj Mahal.\nPlaces of interest.\nTaj Mahal\nAgra's Taj Mahal is one of the most famous buildings in the world. It is well known for its reason to be built for Shah Jahan's favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. It is one of the Seven Wonders of the world, and one of three World Heritage Sites in Agra.\nCompleted in 1653, the T\u0101j Mahal was built by the Mughal king Sh\u0101h Jah\u0101n as the grave for his beloved wife, Mumt\u0101z Mahal. It was built in white marble. It is perhaps India's most fascinating and beautiful monument. This perfectly symmetrical monument took 22 years (1630-1652) of hard labour and 20,000 workers, masons and jewellers to build. Along with the building there is landscaped gardens. The architect who built the monument is named Persian architect, Ust\u0101d '\u012as\u0101. The T\u0101j Mahal is located on the bank of the Yamuna River which can be observed from Agra Fort.\nAgra Fort and Fatehpur sikri are some other noteworthy places of interest."}

It was made by Sonic Team and published by Sega for the Sega Mega Drive in 1994. You can play as Sonic the Hedgehog or Miles \"Tails\" Prower, or both (Tails follows Sonic and does what Sonic does if you play this way). Dr. Eggman is called Dr. Robotnik in the North American and European version of the game.\nStory.\nThe game begins after what happened in the previous game, Sonic the Hedgehog 2. In Sonic 2, Sonic and Tails defeated Dr. Eggman on his giant spaceship called the Death Egg. It then exploded and landed on Angel Island, an island that floats in the air. Knuckles lives on Angel Island. He guards the Master Emerald, which is a big green gem that makes the island float. Dr. Eggman knows that the Master Emerald is very powerful. He wants to steal it, because he could fix the Death Egg with that power. He tricks Knuckles and tells him that Sonic and Tails are thieves and they want to steal the Master Emerald. Soon, Sonic and Tails arrive on Angel Island because they have seen that the Death Egg has fallen there. However, Knuckles surprises them, and takes away the Chaos Emeralds Sonic and Tails have collected.\nHow to play the game.\nThe point of the game is to collect Rings, defeat robots and get to the end of a Zone.\nIn Sonic 3, there are six Zones. Every Zone has got two levels, which are named \"acts\" in the game. At the end of every act 1, you've got to fight one of Dr. Eggman's robots, and at the end of every act 2, you've got to fight Dr. Eggman himself. There are small robots called \"Badniks\" in the acts. Most of them can be destroyed if you jump on them. If the badnik is destroyed, a little animal jumps out of it. \nRings are floating in the air and they are gold. If you collect 100 and 200 Rings, you get a life. If you have no Rings and something hits you (for example, a badnik, spike, or Dr. Eggman), you lose a life. \nThere are also Starposts in the acts. If you hit a Starpost, it will spin for a bit, and if you lose a life, you restart at the last Starpost you touched. Starposts can be used to go to the Bonus Stage, if you touch them if you have 50 or more Rings. Then, a ring made of stars will spin above the Starpost, and if you jump into it, you go to the Bonus Stage."}

On October 3, 2011, she was cleared of murder after an appeal trial. The sentence was declared invalid in March 2013. She was sentenced to 28 years and six months in jail in late January 2014. Her murder conviction was overturned for a final appeal in March 2015. Knox wrote about her treatment by Italian authorities and her prison problems in her 2013 memoir, \"Waiting to Be Heard\".\nKnox was, at the time of the murder, a 20-year-old University of Washington language student who shared a flat with Kercher. She was in Perugia attending the University for Foreigners for one year, studying Italian, German and creative writing. Knox met her boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito at a classical music concert held on October 25, 2007, which she attended with Kercher at the University for Foreigners. When Kercher left at the intermission, Sollecito met Knox.\nKnox and her boyfriend Sollecito were put on trial. At the time of the murder on November 1, 2007, Kercher's house keys, rent money of 300 euros (~$450), and 2 mobile phones had been missing, but the phones were found in the bushes by a neighbor, several blocks away, when Knox called Kercher's numbers the next morning after finding the front door ajar. The prosecution claimed a knife fight with Sollecito had begun after Knox and Kercher had argued about the stolen rent money, as stated by convicted suspect Rudy Guede (whose DNA was found on the body and purse). However, Amanda Knox had over $4,000 in her bank account at the time, and said she had no motive. Sollecito's DNA was found in the kitchen ashtray and outside Kercher's door frame, where he tried to push the door, but not inside the room nor on the body. Sollecito was sent to prison for 25 years, and Knox for 26 years.\nThey both appealed their sentences.\nAt the first appeal trial in 2011, a man claimed to have seen Knox and Sollecito by a town square near the house that night, when other people were wearing costume masks, but Halloween had been 2 nights earlier, not the night of the murder. The first appeal verdict was given on October 3, 2011, and Knox and Sollecito were freed from prison on that date.\nIn January 2014, Amanda Knox and her prior lover Rafael Sollecito were again found guilty by the Italian higher court, which overturned the first appeal. Sollecito was stopped by Italian Police when he tried to cross the border with Austria, after the verdict.\nIn March 2015, at their fourth trial, Knox and Sollecito were acquitted of Kercher's murder by Italy's top appeal court. Despite being cleared of the murder charge, the guilty verdict against Knox for the slander of Patrick Lumumba - a bar owner she falsely accused of the crime - has been upheld."}

Jim Carrey, famous for his acting in several comedy movies such as \"The Mask\" and \"Bruce Almighty\", and Kate Winslet, a heroine of \"Titanic\", starred in this movie as main characters both of whom are struggling to erase their memories of love.\nThe story of this movie is about memory erasure of a couple who once loved each other but now, suffer from the memories of their love. Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) decides to erase his memory about his girlfriend, Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet), after he discovered that she had removed all of her memories about him. He goes to see Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) of Lacuna Inc., a firm that helps people erase their painful, heartbreaking memories with a special brain map processing, and asks the doctor to erase his memory. However, while the memory erasure is ongoing, he faces with their earlier memories that are so passionate, sweet and precious that they should never be deleted. Although Joel tries to wake up and stop getting rid of her from his mind, Dr. Mierswiak and his employees keep going on the process. Joel eventually gets to the last memory, disappearing with the last words of Clementine saying, \u201cMeet me in Montauk.\u201d Other than the story of main characters, the staff members of Lacuna Inc. such as Mary (Kirsten Dunst), and Patrick (Elijah Wood) also have some related stories which will be a key for the ending of this movie.\nThe director tells people two quotes by Mary\u2019s words in the movie. The first one is from Friedrich Nietzsche\u2019s saying, \u201cBlessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders.\u201d The second one is from Alexander Pope\u2019s poem, \u201cHow happy is the blameless vestal's lot! The world forgetting, by the world forgot. Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! Each prayer accepted, and each wish resigned.\u201d The title of this movie, \u201cEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\u201d is from this quote."}
