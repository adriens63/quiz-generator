They sold the corpses of their 17 victims to Dr Robert Knox. Knox was a Fellow of the Royal Society, and the Conservator of the Museum of Comparative Anatomy in Edinburgh. He was a teacher of human anatomy to Edinburgh medical students, so needed bodies for his students to dissect.\nThe murderer's accomplices included Burke's mistress, Helen McDougal, and Hare's wife, Margaret Laird. From their method of killing their victims has come the word \"burking\", meaning to purposefully smother and, more generally, to quietly suppress.\nThe Resurrectionists.\nFrom 1826 to 1840 Knox ran Barclay's anatomy school in Surgeon's Square, Edinburgh. He was the most popular lecturer on anatomy in Scotland, but his class were always short of bodies to dissect.\nBefore the Anatomy Act of 1832 widened the supply, the only legal supply of corpses for anatomical purposes in the UK were those condemned to death and dissection by the courts. This led to a shortage of legitimate subjects for dissection. The shortage became more serious as the need to train medical students grew, and the number of executions fell.\nIn his school Knox ran up against the problem from the start, since \u2013 after 1815 \u2013 the Royal Colleges had increased the study of anatomy in the medical curriculum. If he taught according to what was known as \u2018French method\u2019 the ratio would have had to approach one corpse per pupil. As a consequence, body-snatching became so common that it was not unusual for relatives and friends of someone who had just died to watch over the body before and after burial, to stop it being taken.\nIn November 1827 William Hare began a new career when an indebted lodger died on him by chance. He was paid \u00a37.10/- (seven pounds &amp; ten shillings) for delivering the body to Knox. Now Burke and his accomplice Hare set about murdering tramps and drunks on a regular basis. After 16 more transactions, in what became known as the West Port Murders, on 2 November 1828 Burke and Hare were caught. The whole city were convulsed with horror, fed by ballads, broadsides and newspapers, at the terrible deeds of Burke &amp; Hare. Hare turned King's evidence, and Burke was hanged, dissected and displayed.\nKnox was not prosecuted, which outraged many in Edinburgh. His house was attacked by a mob, and windows were broken. A committee of the Royal Society of Edinburgh cleared him of blame, but there was no forgetting his part in the case, and many were wary of him.\nDiscovery and trial.\nThe last victim was Marjory Campbell Docherty. Burke lured her into the lodging house by claiming that his mother was also a Docherty. He had to wait to kill her because the lodgers James and Ann Gray were present. The Grays left for the night and neighbours heard the sounds of a struggle.\nThe next day Ann Gray, who had returned, became suspicious when Burke would not let her approach a bed where she had left her stockings. When the Grays were left alone in the house, they checked the bed and found Docherty's body under it. On their way to alert the police, they ran into McDougal who tried to bribe them with an offer of \u00a310 a week. They refused.\nBurke and Hare had removed the body from the house before the police arrived. However, under questioning, Burke claimed that Docherty had left at 7:00\u00a0a.m., while McDougal claimed that she had left in the evening. The police arrested them. An anonymous tip-off led them to Knox's classroom where they found Docherty's body, which James Gray identified. William and Margaret Hare were arrested soon there after. The murder spree had lasted twelve months."}

{"id": "326670", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=326670", "title": "Australian Aboriginal mythology", "text": "Australian Aboriginal myths, also known as Dreamtime stories and Songlines, are the stories traditionally performed and told by the indigenous people of Australia. Each of the language groups across Australia has its own stories.\nAll the myths explain important features and meanings within each Aboriginal group's local landscape. They give cultural meaning to the Australian physical landscape. People who know these stories have access to the wisdom and knowledge of Australian Aboriginal ancestors back beyond the reach of memory.\nDavid Horton wrote in the \"Encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia\" that:\n\"A mythic map of Australia would show thousands of characters, varying in their importance, but all in some way connected with the land. Some emerged at their specific sites and stayed spiritually in that vicinity. Others came from somewhere else and went somewhere else.\"\n\"Many were shape changing, transformed from or into human beings or natural species, or into natural features such as rocks but all left something of their spiritual essence at the places noted in their stories.\"\nAustralian Aboriginal myths have been described as parts of a catechism, a liturgical manual, a history of civilization, a geography textbook, and to a much smaller extent a manual of the world and the universe.\nAntiquity.\nAn Australian linguist, R. M. W. Dixon, collected many Aboriginal myths in their original languages. He discovered some landscape details in myths were the same as scientific discoveries being made about the same landscapes. For example, on the Atherton Tableland, myths tell of the origins of Lake Eacham, Lake Barrine, and Lake Euramo. Geologists have dated the volcanic explosions which formed the lakes, and were described by Aboriginal myth tellers, as having happened more than 10,000 years ago. Pollen fossil sampling from the bottom of the craters agrees with the Aboriginal myth-tellers' story. When the craters were formed, the area was eucalyptus forest, not the current wet tropical rain forests.\nDixon said that Aboriginal myths about the origin of the Crater Lakes might be accurate back to 10\u00a0000 years ago. Further investigation by the Australian Heritage Commission led to the Crater Lakes myth being listed on the Register of the National Estate, and included within Australia's World Heritage nomination of the wet tropical forests. It is an \"unparalleled human record of events dating back to the Pleistocene era.\"\nSince then, Dixon has found many similar examples of Australian Aboriginal myths that accurately describe landscapes of an ancient past. He particularly noted many myths telling of previous sea levels, including:\nAboriginal mythology: Whole of Australia.\nThere are at least 400 Aboriginal groups across Australia. Each group has its own name, its own language and often their own dialects. Each group had its own myths, and the words and names of individual myths come these language groups.\nWith so many different Aboriginal groups, languages, beliefs and practices, it is not possible to describe under a single heading, the full range and diversity of all myths across the entire continent.\n\"The Encyclopaedia of Aboriginal Australia\" does however note that \"One intriguing feature [of Aboriginal Australian mythology] is the mixture of diversity and similarity in myths across the entire continent.\"\nThe similarity in Aboriginal myths and mythology includes:\n\"..they generally describe the journeys of ancestral beings, often giant animals or people, over what began as a featureless domain. Mountains, rivers, waterholes, animal and plant species, and other natural and cultural resources came into being as a result of events which took place during these Dreamtime journeys. Their existence in present-day landscapes is seen by many indigenous peoples as confirmation of their creation beliefs..\"\n\"..The routes taken by the Creator Beings in their Dreamtime journeys across land and sea.. link many sacred sites together in a web of Dreamtime tracks criss-crossing the country. Dreaming tracks can run for hundreds, even thousands of kilometres, from desert to the coast [and] may be shared by peoples in countries through which the tracks pass..\"\nAustralian anthropologists describe Aboriginal myths still being performed across Australia by Aboriginal peoples as having an important social function. The myths explain the order of their daily lives; helping shape peoples' ideas; and assisting to influence others' behaviour. Also the performance often adds and \"mythologises\" historical events in the service of these social purposes in a rapidly changing modern world. As R.M. W. Dixon writes:\n\"It is always integral and common.. that the Law (Aboriginal law) is something derived from ancestral peoples or Dreamings and is passed down the generations in a continuous line. While...entitlements of particular human beings may come and go, the underlying relationships between foundational Dreamings and certain landscapes are theoretically eternal...the entitlements of people to places are usually regarded strongest when those people enjoy a relationship of identity with one or more Dreamings of that place.\nThis is a central strong feature of Aboriginal identity. It is more than just a matter of believing. The Dreaming existed, and continues to exist, while humans are only temporary.\nAboriginal myths across Australia are a kind of unwritten (oral) library. From this library, Aboriginal people learn about the world and see an Aboriginal 'reality' with concepts and values vastly different from those of western societies:\n\"Aboriginal people learned from their stories that a society must not be human-centred but rather land centred, otherwise they forget their source and purpose...they are interconnected with the rest of creation, that they as individuals are only temporal in time, and past and future generations must be included in their perception of their purpose in life.\"\n\"People come and go but the Land, and stories about the Land, stay. This is a wisdom that takes lifetimes of listening, observing and experiencing...There is a deep understanding of human nature and the environment...sites hold 'feelings' which cannot be described in physical terms...subtle feelings that resonate through the bodies of these people.. It is only when talking and being with these people that these 'feelings' can truly be appreciated. This is.. the reality of these people..\"\nAustralia wide myths.\nRainbow Serpent.\nIn 1926 a British anthropologist, Professor Alfred Radcliffe-Brown, noted many Aboriginal groups across Australia shared versions of a single myth. The myth told of a powerful, creative, dangerous snake or serpent, usually of enormous size. This serpent was linked with rainbows, rain, rivers, and deep waterholes.\nRadcliffe-Brown used the words \"Rainbow Serpent\" to describe this common, recurring myth. He listed the different names used across Australia for this \"Rainbow Serpent\":\nThis 'Rainbow Serpent', a snake of enormous size, lives in the deepest waterholes. It came from a larger being which can be seen as a dark streak in the Milky Way. It shows itself to people in this world as a rainbow as it moves through water and rain, shaping landscapes, naming and singing of places, swallowing and sometimes drowning people; strengthening the knowledgeable with rainmaking and healing powers; blighting others with sores, weakness, illness, and death.\nEven Australia's 'Bunyip' was identified as a 'Rainbow Serpent' myth of the above kind. The words used by Radcliffe-Brown are now commonly used by government agencies, museums, art galleries, Aboriginal organisations and the media to refer to Australian Aboriginal myth specifically, and as a shorthand term for Australian Aboriginal mythology generally.\nCaptain Cook myths.\nAnother myth found across Australia is about a person who arrives from the sea. This person, usually from England, either offers gifts or brings great harm. The person is most often called 'Captain Cook', and portrayed as a villain.\nThe Aboriginal myths about 'Captain Cook' are not oral history. They are not part of James Cook's exploration of the east coast of Australia in 1770. Aboriginal people did meet with Cook, especially during his seven-week stay on the Endeavour River. The Guugu Yimidhirr people may remember these meetings.\nThe Australia wide Captain Cook myth, however, tells of a symbolic British character who arrives from across the oceans sometime after the Aboriginal world was formed and the original social order founded. This Captain Cook signals dramatic changes in the social order, into which present-day Aborigines have been born.\nIn 1988 Australian anthropologist Kenneth Maddock examined several versions of this 'Captain Cook' myth as recorded from a number of Aboriginal groups around Australia: \n\"set up the people [cattle industry] to go down the countryside and shoot people down, just like animal, they left them lying there for the hawks and crows...So a lot of old people and young people were struck by the head with the end of a gun and left there. They wanted to get the people wiped out because Europeans in Queensland had to run their stock: horses and cattle.\"\nExamples of myths.\nMurrinh-Patha people.\nThe Murrinh-Patha people live in the saltwater country inland from the town of Wadeye. They describe a Dreamtime in their myths which anthropologists believe is a religious belief but different from most of the world's other religious beliefs.\nThe Murrinh-patha have a oneness of thought, belief, and expression without equal in Christianity. They see all parts of their lives, thoughts and culture as being influenced by their Dreaming. They do not see a difference between spiritual or material things. There is no difference between things that are sacred and things that are not. All life is 'sacred', all conduct has 'moral' results. All life's meaning comes out of this eternal, everpresent Dreaming.\n\"The sacred is everywhere within the physical landscape. Myths and mythic tracks cross over.. thousands of miles, and every particular form and feature of the terrain has a well-developed 'story' behind it.\"\nThis Murrinh-patha mythology is based on a view of life that believes life is \"...a joyous thing with maggots at its centre.\". Life is good and caring, but during life's journey, there are many painful sufferings that each person must come to understand and live through as he grows. This is the message being told within the Murrinh-patha myths. It is this philosophy that gives Murrinh-patha people reason and meaning in life.\nThe following Murrinh-patha myth, for example, is performed in Murrinh-patha ceremonies to initiate young men into adulthood. \n\"A woman, \"Mutjinga\" (the 'Old Woman'), was in charge of young children, but instead of watching out for them during their parents' absence, she swallowed them and tried to escape as a giant snake. The people followed her, spearing her and removing the undigested children from the body.\"\nWithin the myth and in its performance, young children must first be swallowed by an ancestral being who changes into a giant snake. The children are then vomited up before being accepted as young adults with all the rights and benefits of young adults.\nPintupi people.\nThe Pintupi peoples from Australia's Gibson Desert region have a mostly 'mythic' form of understanding their identity, All events happen and are explained by the social structures and rules told of, sung about, and performed within their superhuman mythology. That is, the structures of society come from the myths, not from their own political actions, decisions or influences of local individuals. \n\"The Dreaming.. provides a moral authority lying outside the individual will and outside human creation.. although the Dreaming as an ordering of the cosmos is presumably a product of historical events, such an origin is denied.\"\n\"Current action is not understood as the result of human alliances, creations, and choices, but is seen as imposed by an embracing, cosmic order.\"\nWithin this Pintupi view of the world, three long geographical tracks of named places control and guide society. They are interrelated strings of important places named and created by mythic characters on their way through the Pintupi desert region during the Dreaming. It is a complex mythology of stories, songs and ceremonies known to the Pintupi as \"Tingarri\". It is most completely told and performed by Pintupi peoples at larger gatherings within Pintupi country."}

It was a Second World War Allied attack on the German-occupied port of Dieppe. The attack took place on the northern coast of France on 19 August 1942.\nThe attack began at 5:00\u00a0a.m. and by 10:50\u00a0a.m. the Allied commanders had to call a retreat. Over 6,000 infantrymen, mostly Canadian, were supported by a Canadian Armoured regiment. They were also helped by a strong force of Royal Navy and smaller Royal Air Force group.\nThe goal was to capture a major port for a short period and to gather information. Upon retreat, the Allies also wanted to destroy coastal defences, port structures and important buildings. The raid was also intended to improve morale and demonstrate the commitment of the United Kingdom to attack a Western front in Europe.\nNone of these goals were achieved. There was not enough Allied artillery support. The troops were trapped on the beach by obstacles and German gunfire. After less than 10 hours since the first landings, the last Allied troops had all been either killed, evacuated, or captured by the Germans.\nInstead of showing the British commitment, the terrible number of Allied deaths showed that the Allies were not ready to invade France for a long time. The attack did help the Allies to gather some information.\nA total of 3,623 of the 6,086 men (almost 60%) who went ashore were either killed, wounded, or captured. The Royal Air Force did not get the \"Luftwaffe\" to start a battle. The RAF lost 96 aircraft (at least 32 to being shot down or accidents), compared to 48 lost by the \"Luftwaffe\".\nThe Royal Navy lost 33 landing craft and one destroyer. The events at Dieppe affected the plans for the North African (Operation \"Torch\") and Normandy landings (Operation \"Overlord\").\nBackground.\nThe British decided the Dieppe attack could be planned within a month. They were very careful to keep the attack secret. No records were kept of the plans.\nAfter the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Forces from Dunkirk in May 1940, the British started to plan an attack force. It would use new ways of doing sea landings on beaches (amphibious warfare).\nThe British started planning was to see if they could capture a port. This would allow them to test out how to use ships in the attack. It would also allow them to test new equipment.\nDieppe, a coastal town in France, is built along a long cliff by the English Channel. In 1942, the Germans set up two large artillery batteries at Berneval-le-Grand and Varengeville. One important consideration for the British planners was that Dieppe was within range of the Royal Air Force's fighter aircraft.\nThere was also pressure from the Soviet government to attack the Germans in Western Europe. By early 1942, The Wehrmacht's Operation \"Barbarossa\" attacks did not destroy the Soviet Union.\nHowever, the Germans moved into southern Soviet territory, pushing toward Stalingrad. Joseph Stalin demanded that the Allies attack in France to force the Germans to move 40 divisions away from the Eastern Front. This would make the fighting less hard for the Red Army.\nPlan.\nThe Dieppe raid was a major attack planned by Vice-Admiral Lord Mountbatten.\nThe attacking force would consist of 5,000 Canadians, 1,000 British troops, and 50 United States Rangers.\nIt was originally planned in April 1942 and code named Operation \"Rutter\". The Allies planned to do a major attack on a German-held port on the French coast and to hold it for two tides. They would destroy enemy buildings and defences before withdrawing.\nThis plan was approved in May 1942. It included British parachute units attacking German artillery batteries. The Canadians would land on the beaches and attack. The parachute operation was cancelled and instead No. 3 Commando and No. 4 Commando would land by sea and attack the artillery batteries.\nLand component.\nThe Canadian government wanted that Canadian troops to do some fighting. The 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, commanded by Major General John Hamilton Roberts, was selected for the main force. \nThe plan called for an attack, without any heavy air bombing.\nThe lack of enough bombing was one of the main reasons for the attack's failure. Some people think that air and naval bombing was not done to limit casualties of French civilians in the port.\nThe Dieppe landings were planned on six beaches. Four were in front of the town, and two to the eastern and western sides. \nArmoured support was provided by the 14th Army Tank Regiment (The Calgary Regiment (Tank)). 58 of the new Churchill tanks would be sent ashore using the new landing craft tank (LCT). In addition, three of the Churchills had flame-throwers and all could operate in the shallow water near the beach.\nNaval and air support.\nThe Royal Navy would supply 237 ships and landing craft. However, pre-landing naval gunfire support was limited, consisting of six Hunt-class destroyers with 4-inch guns. The Royal Air Force would supply 74 squadrons of aircraft, of which 66 were fighter squadrons.\nIntelligence.\nThere was not much information about the beaches. There were German gun positions on the cliffs, but these had not been spotted. The planners thought that Dieppe is not heavily defended and that the beaches in are suitable for landing infantry, and armored fighting vehicles.\nGerman forces.\nThe German forces at Dieppe were ready for the attack. They were warned by French double agents that the British were planning some action in the area. They had also detected increased radio talk and landing craft being gathered together in the southern British coastal ports.\nDieppe and the cliffs were well defended. The 1,500 troops were\nplaced along the beaches of Dieppe and the nearby towns, covering all the likely landing places.\nThe Germans had machine guns, mortars and artillery. The city and port was protected.\nThe \"Luftwaffe\" forces were \"Jagdgeschwader 2\" (JG2) and \"Jagdgeschwader 26\" (JG26), with 200 fighters, mostly the Fw 190. There were about 100 bombers from \"Kampfgeschwader 2\" (KG2), \"Kampfgeschwader 45\" (KG45), and \"Kampfgeschwader 77\" (KG77), mostly Dornier 217s.\nInitial landings.\nThe Allied fleet left the south coast of England on the night of 18 August 1942. The Canadians left from the Port of Newhaven. The fleet of eight destroyers and motor gun boats to protect the landing craft and motor launches were preceded by minesweepers that cleared paths through the English Channel for them.\nThe initial landings began at 04:50 on 19 August. There were attacks on the two artillery batteries on the sides of the main landing area.\nOn their way in, the landing craft and escorts heading towards Puys and Berneval ran into a small German group of ships and exchanged fire at 03:48.\nYellow Beach.\nThe goal for Lieutenant Colonel John Durnford-Slater and No.\u00a03 Commando was to do two landings east of Dieppe to destroy the coastal artillery battery near Berneval. The battery could fire upon the landing at Dieppe to the west.\nThe craft carrying No.\u00a03 Commando approached the coast to the east. They were not warned of the approach of a German convoy that had been found by British \"Chain Home\" radar stations at 21:30.\nGerman S-boats escorting a German tanker torpedoed some of the landing craft and damaged the escorting Steam Gun Boat 5.\nMotor Launch 346 and Landing Craft Flak 1 fired on the German boats. The group got spread out, with some losses, and the enemy's coastal defences were alerted.\nOnly 18 commandos got near the German artillery battery. They fired guns at the Germans. Although unable to destroy the artillery, it caused problems for the German artillery troops.\nThe commandos had to pull back because there were many enemy troops.\nOrange Beach.\nThe goal for Lieutenant Colonel Lord Lovat and No.\u00a04 Commando (including 50 United States Army Rangers) was to do two landings west of Dieppe. They had to destroy the coastal artillery battery \"Hess\" at Blancmesnil-Sainte-Marguerite. Landing on the right side, they climbed the hill and attacked. They destroyed the artillery battery of six 150\u00a0mm guns. This was the only success of Operation \"Jubilee\". The commando then withdrew at 07:30 as planned.\nMost of No.\u00a04 returned to England. This part of the raid was seen as a good example of how the Royal Marine Commando should attack during landings. Lord Lovat was awarded the Distinguished Service Order, and Captain Patrick Porteous No.\u00a04 Commando, was awarded the Victoria Cross.\nBlue beach.\nThe naval battle between the small German convoy and the craft carrying No.\u00a03 Commando had made the German defenders at Blue beach aware of the attack. The landing near Puys by the Royal Regiment of Canada plus three platoons from the Black Watch of Canada and an artillery group was ordered to destroy machine gun and artillery batteries protecting the Dieppe beach.\nThey were delayed by 20 minutes and the smoke that should have hidden their attack had lifted. The Germans were ready in their defensive positions for the landings. The well-fortified German forces fired guns at the Canadian forces that did land on the beach.\nAs soon as they reached the shore, the Canadians found themselves unable to move forward. The Royal Regiment of Canada had many deaths. Of the 556 men in the regiment, 200 were killed and 264 captured.\nGreen beach.\nOn Green beach at the same time that No.\u00a04 Commando had landed, the South Saskatchewan Regiment went towards Pourville. They landed at 04:52 without being detected. The regiment managed to leave their landing craft before the Germans could start firing their guns.\nThe regiment had to enter Pourville to cross the river by the only bridge. Before they managed to reach the bridge, the Germans had put machine guns and anti-tank guns there which stopped them. With dead and wounded Canadians lying on the bridge, Lieutenant Colonel Charles Cecil Ingersoll Merritt, the commanding officer, crossed the bridge several times. He wanted to show his soldiers that the bridge could be crossed. Lieutenant Colonel Merritt was awarded the Victoria Cross.\nPourville radar station.\nOne of the goals of the Dieppe Raid was to discover the technology of a German radar station.\nRAF Flight Sergeant Jack Nissenthall, a radar specialist, was to attempt to enter the radar station and learn its secrets. If he were about to be captured, the soldiers with him had to kill him. He knew a lot of secrets about Allied radar. He also carried a cyanide pill to take if he was captured.\nNissenthall and his men could not enter the radar station due to strong German defences. Nissenthall did cut all telephone wires."}

{"id": "326817", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=326817", "title": "Urinary tract infection", "text": "A urinary tract infection (UTI) is an infection caused by bacteria in part of the urinary tract. In the lower urinary tract, it is simple cystitis (a bladder infection). In the upper urinary tract, it is a kidney infection. Symptoms from a lower urinary tract infection include painful peeing and frequent peeing or wanting to pee (or both). Symptoms of a kidney infection include fever and side and back pain. In old people and young children, the symptoms are not always so clear. The main cause for both types is the bacteria \"Escherichia coli.\" Other bacteria, viruses, or fungus may be the cause in rare cases.\nWomen get urinary tract infections more often than men. Half of women have an infection at some point in their lives. It is common to have repeated infections. Risk factors include sexual intercourse as well as family history. Sometimes a person who had a bladder infection will get a kidney infection. Kidney infection may also, but rarely, be caused by bacteria in the blood. Diagnosis in young healthy women can be based on symptoms alone. Sometimes, the urine needs to be tested. A person with frequent infections can take low-dose antibiotics to prevent future infections.\nAntibiotics are used to treat simple cases of urinary tract infections. Resistance to antibiotics is increasing. People who have complicated urinary tract infections sometimes have to take antibiotics for a longer time, or might take antibiotics intravenously (through a vein). If symptoms have not improved in two or three days, the person will need further tests. In women, urinary tract infections are the most common form of bacterial infection. Ten percent of women develop urinary tract infections each year.\nSigns and symptoms.\nLower urinary tract infection is also known as a bladder infection. The most common symptoms are burning with peeing and having to pee frequently (or wanting to pee) without vaginal discharge or significant pain. These symptoms can vary from mild to severe. In healthy women, the symptoms last an average of six\u00a0days. Some people will have pain above the pubic bone (lower abdomen) or in the lower back. People who have an upper urinary tract infection, or pyelonephritis (a kidney infection), can have flank pain, fever (a high temperature), or nausea and vomiting. Those symptoms are in addition to the normal symptoms of a lower urinary tract infection. In rare cases the urine looks bloody or contains visible pyuria (pus in the urine).\nIn children.\nIn young children, fever can be the only symptom of a urinary tract infection (UTI). Many medical associations recommend a urine culture for females younger than two year old or uncircumcised males who are younger than a year and have a fever. Infants with UTI sometimes eat poorly, vomit, sleep more, or show signs of jaundice ( a yellow coloring of the skin). Older children can have new urinary incontinence (loss of bladder control).\nIn the elderly.\nUrinary tract symptoms are frequently not seen in those who are old. Sometimes, the only symptoms are incontinence (loss of bladder control), a change in mental status (ability to think), or feeling tired. The first symptom for some old people is sepsis, an infection of the blood. Diagnosis can be difficult because many old people are incontinent (cannot hold their pee) or have dementia (poor thinking abilities).\nCause.\n\"E. coli\" is the cause of 80\u201385% of urinary tract infections. \"Staphylococcus saprophyticus\" is the cause in 5\u201310% of cases. In rare cases, viral or fungal infections cause urinary tract infections Other bacterial causes of UTI include:\nThese bacterial causes are not common and usually happen when the person has an abnormal urinary system or the person has a urinary catheterization (tube inserted into the bladder. Urinary tract infections due to\"Staphylococcus aureus\" usually happens after the person has had a blood infection.\nGender.\nSexual intercourse is the cause of 75\u201390% of bladder infections in young, sexually active women. The risk of infection is related to how often they have sex. With UTIs so frequent when women first get married, the term \"honeymoon cystitis\" is often used. In post-menopausal women (women who have stopped menstruating), sexual activity does not affect the risk of developing a UTI. Using spermicide (a gel or cream to kill sperm) increases the risk of UTIs.\nWomen get more UTIs than men because women have a urethra that is much shorter and closer to the anus. As a woman's estrogen (a hormone) levels decrease with menopause, the risk of urinary tract infections increases due to the loss of protective vaginal flora (good bacterial that live in the vagina).\nUrinary catheters.\nA urinary catheter is a tube that is put into the bladder to drain the urine. Using a catheter increases the risk for urinary tract infections. The risk of bacteriuria (bacteria in the urine) is 3% - 6% every day the catheter is used. Antibiotics do not stop these infections. The risk of an infection can be decreased by:\nOthers.\nBladder infections are more common in some families. Other risk factors include diabetes, being circumcised, and having a large prostate (a gland around the urethra in males). Complicating factors are not completely clear. These factors may include some anatomic problems (relating to physical narrowing), functional, or metabolic problems. A complicated UTI is more difficult to treat and usually needs more aggressive evaluation, treatment, and follow-up. In children, UTIs are linked to vesicoureteral reflux (an abnormal movement of urine from the bladder into ureters or kidneys) and constipation.\nMechanism.\nThe bacteria that cause urinary tract infections usually go into the bladder from the uretha. It is believed these bacteria come from the bowel. Females are at greater risk because they have a short urethra that is close to their anus). After entering the bladder, \"E. Coli\" are able to stick to the bladder wall. They form a biofilm, which is a coating of microorganisms, that resists the body's immune response. However, infections can also come through the blood or lymph.\nPrevention.\nThe following activities do not cause a UTI or make them happen less frequently: \nPeople who often get UTIs and who use spermicide or a diaphragm for birth control should use a different type of birth control. Cranberry (juice or capsules) may decrease the number of infections, but some people cannot use cranberries for long periods of time. Gastrointestinal (stomach) upset occurs in more than 30% of people who regularly drink cranberry juice or take capsules. As of 2011, probiotics used intravaginally (in the vagina) require further study to determine if they are helpful.\nMedications.\nFor people who keep getting infections, taking antibiotics for a long time is helpful. Drugs frequently used include nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. If infections are related to sexual intercourse, some women find it useful to taking antibiotics after sex. In post-menopausal women, using topical vaginal estrogen (a hormone applied to the skin of the vaginal) has been found to reduce getting a UTI. Unlike topical creams, the use of vaginal estrogen from pessaries (medical devices put in the vagina is not as useful as low-dose antibiotics. A number of vaccines are being developed (as of 2011).\nIn children.\nThere is little evidence that using preventative antibiotics decreases urinary tract infections in children. It is rare for people who have no problems with their kidneys to develop kidney problems from frequent UTIs. Having frequent urinary tract infections as a child causes less than a third of a percent (0.33%) of chronic kidney disease in adults.\nDiagnosis.\nIn most cases, UTIs can be diagnosed just from the symptoms and there is no need for laboratory testing. Urinalysis (testing the urine) can be used to confirm the diagnosis in complicated cases. The urine is tested for urinary nitrites, white blood cells (leukocytes), or leukocyte esterase. Another test, urine microscopy, looks for red blood cells, white blood cells, or bacteria. Urine culture is considered positive if it shows a bacterial colony count of greater than or equal to 103 colony-forming units per mL of a typical bacteria that causes infections of the urinary tract. Cultures can also be used to test which antibiotic will work. However, women with negative cultures can still improve with antibiotic treatment. UTI symptoms in old people can be vague, and diagnosis can be difficult as there is no really reliable test.\nClassification.\nA urinary tract infection in the lower urinary tract is known as a bladder infection. A UTI in the upper urinary tract is known as pyelonephritis or kidney infection. If the urine has significant bacteria, but there are no symptoms, the condition is known as asymptomatic bacteriuria.\nA urinary tract infection is said to be complicated if:\nOtherwise if a women is a healthy and before menopause, the infection is said to be uncomplicated. When children also have a fever, the urinary tract infection is considered to be an upper urinary tract infection.\nIn children.\nTo diagnose a urinary tract infection in children, a positive urinary culture is required. Contamination poses a frequent challenge so a cutoff of 105\u00a0CFU/mL is used for a \"clean-catch\" mid-stream sample, 104\u00a0CFU/mL is used for catheter-obtained specimens, and 102\u00a0CFU/mL is used for suprapubic aspirations (a sample drawn directly from the bladder through the stomach wall with a needle). The World Health Organization does not like the use of \u201curine bags\u201d to collect samples because there is a high rate of contamination when that urine is cultured. Catheterization is preferred if an individual is unable to use a toilet. Some medical groups, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, recommend renal ultrasound and voiding cystourethrogram (watching a person's urethra and urinary bladder with real time X-rays while they urinate) in all children who are younger than 2 years old and have had a urinary tract infection.Other medical groups such as the National Institute for Clinical Excellence recommend routine imaging only in babies younger than 6 months old or who have unusual findings.\nDifferential diagnosis.\nIn women with cervicitis (inflammation of the cervix) or vaginitis (inflammation of the vagina) and in young men with UTI symptoms, a \"Chlamydia trachomatis\" or \"Neisseria gonorrheae\" infection may be the cause. Vaginitis may also be due to a yeast infection. Interstitial cystitis (chronic pain in the bladder) can be the cause for people who have UTI symptoms many times, but whose urine cultures remain negative and do not improved with antibiotics. Prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) may also be considered in the differential diagnosis.\nTreatment.\nPhenazopyridine can be used in addition to antibiotics to help ease the burning pain of a bladder infection. However, phenazopyridine is no longer commonly recommended due to safety concerns. It can cause methemoglobinemia, which means there is higher than normal level of methemoglobin in the blood. Acetaminophen can be used for fevers.\nWomen who keep getting simple UTIs can benefit from self-treatment; these women should get medical treatment medical only if the initial treatment fails. Health care providers may also prescribe the antibiotics by phone.\nUncomplicated.\nSimple infections can be diagnosed and treated based on symptoms alone. Oral antibiotics such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), cephalosporins, nitrofurantoin, or a fluoroquinolone will shorten the time to recovery. All these drugs are equally effective. A three-day treatment with trimethoprim, TMP/SMX, or a fluoroquinolone is usually enough. Nitrofurantoin needs 5\u20137\u00a0days. With treatment, symptoms should improve within 36\u00a0hours. About 50% of people will get better without treatment within a few days or weeks. The Infectious Diseases Society of America does not recommend fluoroquinolones as first treatment because of concerns that overuse will lead to resistance to this class of drugs, making these drugs less effective for more serious infections. Despite this precaution, some resistance has developed to all of these drugs because to their widespread use. In some countries, trimethoprim alone is deemed to be equivalent to TMP/SMX. Children with simple UTIs are often helped by a three-day course of antibiotics.\nPyelonephritis.\nPyelonephritis (kidney infection) is treated more aggressively than a simple bladder infection using either a longer course of oral antibiotics or intravenous antibiotics. Seven days of the oral fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin is typically used in geographic areas where the resistance rate is less than 10%. If the local resistance rates are greater than 10%, a dose of intravenous ceftriaxone often is prescribed. People with more severe symptoms are sometimes admitted a hospital for ongoing antibiotics. If symptoms do not improve following two or three days of treatment, it can mean that the urinary tract is blocked by a kidney stone.\nLikelihood.\nUrinary tract infections are the most frequent bacterial infection in women. They occur most frequently between the ages of 16 and 35\u00a0years. Ten percent of women get an infection yearly; 60% have an infection at some point in their lives. Nearly half of people get a second infection within a year. Urinary tract infections occur four times more frequently in females than males. Pyelonephritis (a kidney infection) occurs between 20\u201330 times less frequently than bladder infections. Pyelonephritis is the most common cause of hospital acquired infections, accounting for approximately 40% of hospital-acquired infections. Rates of asymptomatic bacteria in the urine increase with age from 2% to 7% in women of childbearing age to as high as 50% in elderly women in care homes. Rates of aysmtomatic bacteria in the urine among men over 75 are 7-10%.\nUrinary tract infections can affect 10% of people during childhood. Urinary tract infections in children are the most common in uncircumcised males younger than 3 months of age, followed by females younger than one year. Estimates of frequency among children, however, vary widely. In a group of children with a fever, ranging in age between birth and 2 years, 2- 20% were diagnosed with a UTI.\nSociety and culture.\nIn the United States, urinary tract infections lead to nearly seven million office visits, a million emergency department visits, and 100,000 hospitalizations every year. The cost of these infections is high due to both lost time at work and costs of medical care. The direct cost of treatment is estimated at 1.6\u00a0billion\u00a0USD yearly in the United States.\nHistory.\nUrinary tract infections have been described since ancient times. The first written description, found in the Ebers Papyrus, dates to around 1550 BC. The Egyptians described a urinary tract infection as \"sending forth heat from the bladder.\" Herbs, bloodletting, and rest were the common treatments until the 1930s, when antibiotics became available. Sulphonamides became available around 1935.\nIn pregnancy.\nPregnant women with UTIs have a higher risk of kidney infections.During pregnancy, high progesterone (a hormone) levels decreased muscle tone of the ureters and bladder. Decreased muscle tone leads to a greater likelihood of reflux, where urine flows back up the ureters and toward the kidneys. If bacteria are present, pregnant women have a 25-40% risk of a kidney infection. Thus treatment is recommended if urine testing shows signs of an infection\u2014even in the absence of symptoms. Cephalexin or nitrofurantoin are typically used because those medications are generally considered safe in pregnancy. A kidney infection during pregnancy may result in premature birth or pre-eclampsia (a state of high blood pressure, kidney dysfunction, or seizures)."}

A. Reitzel on 16\u00a0December 1835 in Copenhagen, Denmark. \"Thumbelina\" is about a tiny girl. She has several adventures with a toad, a mole, a field mouse, and other creatures of field and forest. At the end, she meets and falls in love with a flower-fairy prince just her size. \n\"Thumbelina\" was one of nine fairy tales Andersen printed between 1835 and 1837 in a series of three booklets. These booklets were called \"Fairy Tales Told for Children\". \"Thumbelina\" appeared in the second booklet with \"The Naughty Boy\" and \"The Traveling Companion\". The first booklet included \"The Tinderbox\", \"Great Claus and Little Claus\", \"The Princess and the Pea\", and \"Little Ida's Flowers\". The third booklet was printed in 1837. Only two tales, \"The Little Mermaid\" and \"The Emperor's New Clothes\", appeared in the third and final booklet. \n\"Thumbelina\" is completely Andersen's invention. He did however know tales about tiny people such as \"Tom Thumb\" and the six-inch tall Lilliputians in \"Gulliver's Travels\". He may have taken some inspiration from these tales. Andersen's tales were not liked by the Danish critics. They did not like their casual style and their lack of morals. One critic liked \"Thumbelina\". He called it \"delightful\". The tale has been adapted to an animated movie and a live-action television programme.\nPlot.\nA woman wants a baby. She asks a witch to help her. The witch gives the woman a barleycorn. She tells the woman to plant it, and wait for what will happen. The barleycorn is planted, and a flower grows. When the woman kisses the flower, it pops open to reveal tiny Thumbelina. \nOne night, Thumbelina is asleep in her walnut-shell cradle. She is carried off by a toad who hops through an open window. The toad wants the tiny girl as a bride for her son. She puts Thumbelina on a lily pad for safekeeping. Thumbelina escapes the toad with the help of friendly fish and a white butterfly. She floats away on the lily pad.\nShe is suddenly snatched and carried away by a cockchafer (beetle). The beetle's friends are proud and arrogant. Thumbelina is not of their social class. They take a dislike to her at once. The beetle drops her without a second thought, and flies away. \nThumbelina lives alone as best she can in the fields. When winter comes, she needs to find a place to live. She is finally given a home by an old field mouse. Thumbelina thanks the mouse by taking care of her little house. \nThe mouse thinks Thumbelina should marry her neighbor, a smart and well-to-do mole. Thumbelina finds the idea of being married to such a creature hateful. After all, he spends all of his days underground and never sees the sun or sky. \nThe field mouse does not listen to Thumbelina's protests. She continues to urge the marriage. At the last minute, Thumbelina flies away with a swallow to a far, sunny land. Thumbelina brought the swallow back to health during the winter. They have been friends ever since. \nThe swallow carries Thumbelina to a sunny land. In a field of flowers, Thumbelina meets a tiny flower-fairy prince just her size and to her liking. They wed. Her husband gives her a pair of wings so she can fly with him on his travels from flower to flower. She is given a new name, Maia. \nIn the last page of the story, the swallow has flown to a poet's window, and tells him the complete story of Thumbelina.\n\"Note:\" Mary Howitt was the first to translate the story into English. She disliked the encounter with the witch. In her translation, she starts the tale with a beggar woman giving a peasant's wife a barleycorn in exchange for food. Once the barleycorn is planted, tiny Thumbelina (Tommelise) emerges from its flower.\nBackground.\nHans Christian Andersen was born in Odense, Denmark on 2\u00a0April 1805. His father was Hans Andersen, a shoemaker. His mother was Anne Marie Andersdatter, a laundress. Andersen was an only and a spoiled child. He shared a love of books with his father. His father read him \"The Arabian Nights\" and the fables of Jean de la Fontaine. Together, they built panoramas, pop-up pictures, and toy theatres. Father and son took long walks into the countryside.\nAndersen's father died in 1816. From then on, Andersen was on his own. Andersen was a tall, thin boy who was bullied by other boys. He wanted to escape them, and his poor, illiterate mother. He advertised his artistic talents to the middle class of Odense. He sang and danced in their homes. On 4\u00a0September 1819, the fourteen-year-old Andersen left Odense for Copenhagen with gifts of money he had received from his neighbors. He carried a letter of reference to the ballerina Madame Schall, and had dreams of becoming a poet, a ballet dancer, or an actor.\nAfter three years in Copenhagen without someone to support him, Andersen finally found an interested gentleman in Jonas Collin, the director of the Royal Theatre. Collin believed in the boy's talents. He managed to have the king send Andersen to a grammar school in Slagelse, a country town in west Zealand. He thought Andersen would continue his education at Copenhagen University at the right time.\nAt Slagelse, Andersen was taught by the short, fat, balding thirty-five-year-old Simon Meisling. This man was interested in Ancient Greece and Rome, and had translated Virgil's \"Aeneid\". Andersen was not the brightest student in his class, and Meisling gave Andersen his sharp disapproval. \"You're a stupid boy who will never make it,\" Meisling told him. Meisling is believed to be the model for the learned mole in \"Thumbelina\".\nFairy tale and folklore researchers Iona and Peter Opie believe that \"Thumbelina\" is a \"distant tribute\" to Andersen's friend, Henriette Wulff, the small, delicate, handicapped daughter of the Danish translator of Shakespeare. She loved Andersen as Thumbelina loves the swallow; however, there is no written evidence to support the \"distant tribute\" theory.\nSources.\n\u201cThumbelina\u201d is completely Andersen\u2019s invention. He knew other tales of little people such as the old English fairy tale of \"Tom Thumb\" and Jonathan Swift\u2019s \"Gulliver's Travels\" with its tiny, six-inch Lilliputians. He may have found inspiration in these tales for \"Thumbelina\". He knew Voltaire\u2018s short story, \u201cMicrom\u00e9gas\u201c (with its cast of huge and tiny peoples), and E. T. A. Hoffmann\u2019s hallucinatory, erotic tale \"Meister Floh\". In Hoffmann's tale, a tiny lady torments the hero. A tiny girl also appears in Andersen\u2018s prose fantasy, \"A Journey on Foot from Holmen's Canal to the East Point of Amager\" (1828). Another image from literature similar to Andersen\u2019s tiny being inside a flower is found in E. T. A. Hoffmann\u2019s \"Princess Brambilla\u201d (1821).\nFirst printing and critical reception.\nAndersen printed two booklets of \"Fairy Tales Told for Children\" in 1835. The first booklet was printed in May, and the second in December. \"Thumbelina\" was first printed in the December booklet by C. A. Reitzel on 16 December 1835 in Copenhagen. \"Thumbelina\" was the first tale in the booklet. The booklet included two other tales: \"The Naughty Boy\" and \"The Traveling Companion\". \"Thumbelina\" was printed again in collections of Andersen's works in 1850 and 1862. \nThe second booklet of \"Fairy Tales Told for Children\" featured \"The Tinderbox\", \"Great Claus and Little Claus\", \"The Princess and the Pea\", and \"Little Ida's Flowers\". The third booklet, printed in 1837, included \"The Little Mermaid\" and \"The Emperor's New Clothes\".\nThe first reviews of the seven tales of 1835 did not appear until 1836. The Danish critics did not like them. They thought the informal, chatty style of the tales and their lack of morals were not appropriate for children\u2019s stories. One critic however thought that \"Thumbelina\" was \u201cthe most delightful fairy tale you could wish for.\u201d\nThe critics did not believe Andersen should write other fairy tales. One journal never mentioned the first seven tales at all. Another advised Andersen not to waste his time writing fairy tales. One critic stated that Andersen \"lacked the usual form of that kind of poetry [...] and would not study models\". Andersen felt he was working against their ideas of what a fairy tale should be. He returned to writing novels, believing that this was his true calling. The critical reaction to the 1835 tales was so rough that Andersen waited a year before printing \"The Little Mermaid\" and \"The Emperor's New Clothes\". These two tales appeared in the third and final booklet of \"Fairy Tales Told for Children\" in 1837.\nEnglish translations.\nMary Howitt was the first to translate \"Tommelise\" into English. She printed it in 1846 as \"Thumbelina\" in \"Wonderful Stories for Children\". However, she did not approve of the opening scene with the witch. Instead, she had the childless woman provide bread and milk to a hungry beggar woman. The childless woman was then rewarded with a barleycorn.\nCharles Boner also translated the tale in 1846 as \"Little Ellie\". Madame de Chatelain called the tiny child 'Little Totty' in her 1852 translation. The editor of \"The Child's Own Book\" (1853) called the child throughout, 'Little Maja'. H. W. Dulcken's widely printed volumes of Andersen's tales appeared in 1864 and 1866. Mrs. H. B. Paulli translated the name as 'Little Tiny' in the late-nineteenth century.\nIn the twentieth century, Erik Christian Haugaard translated the name as 'Inchelina' in 1974. Jeffrey and Diane Crone Frank translated the name as 'Thumbelisa' in 2005. Modern English translations of \"Thumbelina\" are found in the six-volume complete edition of Andersen's tales from the 1940s by Jean Hersholt. Erik Christian Haugaard\u2019s translation of the complete tales was published in 1974.\nCommentaries.\nFairy tale and folklore researchers Iona and Peter Opie have written that \"Thumbelina\" is an adventure story from the female point of view. They believe the story teaches the reader that people are happiest with their own kind. Thumbelina is a passive character and the victim of circumstances, they point out. Her male counterpart Tom Thumb (one of the tale\u2019s inspirations) is an active character. He makes himself felt, and exerts himself.\nFolklorist Maria Tatar sees \u201cThumbelina\u201d as a runaway bride story. She notes that it has been viewed as an allegory about arranged marriages. She points out that \"Thumbelina\" is a fable about being true to one\u2019s heart. \"Thumbelina\" upholds the notion that the love of a prince is to be valued above all else. \nTatar points out that in Hindu belief, a thumb-sized being known as the innermost self or soul dwells in the heart of all beings, human or animal. This concept may have absorbed by European folklore, then taken form as Tom Thumb and Thumbelina. Both characters seek transfiguration and redemption. She sees parallels between Andersen\u2019s tale and the Greek myth of Demeter and her daughter, Persephone. Despite the pagan references in the tale, she notes that \"Thumbelina\" refers to Christ\u2018s suffering and resurrection, and the Christian concept of salvation.\nAndersen biographer Jackie Wullschlager writes that \u201cThumbelina\u201d was the first of Andersen's tales to dramatize the sufferings and hardships of one who is different. As a result of being different, Thumbelina becomes the object of mockery. It was also the first of Andersen's tales to use the swallow as the symbol of the poetic soul. Andersen identified with the swallow as a migratory bird whose pattern of life his own traveling days were beginning to resemble.\nRoger Sale believes Andersen's feelings of social and sexual inferiority were expressed in the tale by creating characters that are inferior to their beloveds. The Little Mermaid, for example, has no soul while her human beloved has a soul as his birthright. In \u201cThumbelina\u201d, Andersen suggests the toad, the beetle, and the mole are Thumbelina\u2019s inferiors. They should remain in their places rather than wanting their superior. Sale indicates they are not inferior to Thumbelina but simply \"different\". He suggests that Andersen may have done some damage to the animal world when he colored his animal characters with his own feelings of inferiority.\nJacqueline Banerjee views the tale as a story about failure. \u201cNot surprisingly,\u201c she writes, \u201c\u201dThumbelina\u201c is now often read as a story of specifically female empowerment.\u201c Susie Stephens believes Thumbelina herself is a grotesque. She observes that \u201cthe grotesque in children\u2019s literature is [...] a necessary and beneficial component that enhances the psychological welfare of the young reader\u201c. Children are attracted to the cathartic qualities of the grotesque, she suggests. \nSidney Rosenblatt in his essay, \"Thumbelina and the Development of Female Sexuality\" believes the tale may be analyzed from the perspective of Freudian psychosexual development. He believes the story is one of female masturbation. Thumbelina herself, he posits, could symbolize the clitoris, her rose petal coverlet the labia, the white butterfly \"the budding genitals\", and the mole and the prince the anal and vaginal openings respectively.\nAdaptations.\n\"Thumbelina\" has been adapted to different media. The earliest animated version of the tale is a silent, black-and-white release by director Herbert M. Dawley in 1924. Lotte Reiniger released a 10-minute movie adaptation in 1954 featuring her \"silhouette\" puppets.\nDon Bluth's full-length animated movie, \"Thumblina\" may be one of the best known versions. The story was also adapted to the live-action television program, \"Faerie Tale Theatre\". This production starred Carrie Fisher. The direct-to-DVD animated movie, \"Barbie Presents Thumbelina\" was released in 2009. Russia and Japan have also released animated productions."}

It first appeared in a handwritten and illustrated manuscript in 1695 titled \"Contes de ma m\u00e8re l'oye\" (). The deluxe volume was intended for Mademoiselle, the 19-year-old niece of Louis XIV. It included four other tales by Perrault. \"Bluebeard\" was first published anonymously in January 1697 in Paris by Claude Barbin in \"Histoires ou contes du temps pass\u00e9\" (), a collection of eight fairy tales by Perrault. The tale is about a cruel man who murders his wives so that he will inherit their wealth. He puts their corpses in a secret room opened only by a magic key.\nJacque Barchilon believes the tale is original with Perrault because there are no close antecedants. The taboo of the forbidden room is found in eastern literature, and Barchilon writes that the tale has an \"Oriental character\". He points out that the French associated beards with Turkish fashions, and early illustrations depict Bluebeard wearing a turban-like headdress.\nMedieval murderer of children Gilles de Rais may have been the inspiration for the character of Bluebeard. De Rais was a Marshal of France and Joan of Arc's military companion. His victims (mostly young boys) were said to number 140. The Breton king Comorre the Cursed (c.500 AD) is another candidate. Tales similar to \"Bluebeard\" include \"The Fitcher's Bird\" by the Brothers Grimm and the English tale \"Mr. Fox\".\nStory.\nA rich man has a blue beard which frightens young women. He has been married several times but no one knows what has happened to his wives. He woos two young sisters in the neighborhood but neither are inclined to consider marriage. He treats them to a lavish time in his country house. The younger sister decides to marry him. Shortly after the wedding (and before he travels to a far land on business), Bluebeard gives his wife the keys to his house. One key opens a door to a distant room. He forbids her to enter this room. He leaves and his wife opens the door to the forbidden room. Here she finds Bluebeard's former wives, all dead and lying on a floor covered with blood. She drops the key. It is magic and becomes stained with blood that cannot be washed away. Bluebeard returns. He discovers the blood-stained key and knows his wife has disobeyed his order. He tells her she will take her place among the dead. He grants her a few minutes to pray. She calls her sister Anne and asks her to go to the top of the tower to see if her brothers are on the road. After several tense moments, Anne reports seeing the men approaching. Bluebeard raises a cutlass to decapitate his wife. Her brothers burst into the room. They kill Bluebeard. Their sister is safe."}

That helps the energy balance in the body. \nLeptin is opposed by the actions of the hormone ghrelin, the \"hunger hormone\". Both hormones act on receptors in the hypothalamus. They adjust appetite to get energy homeostasis. \nIn obesity, a decreased sensitivity to leptin comes up. This leads to a feeling of hunger, despite high energy stores.\nAlthough regulation of fat stores is the primary function of leptin, it also plays a role in other physiological processes. These additional functions are still being studied.\nLeptin was recently discovered in 1994 by Jeffrey M. Friedman and colleagues at Rockefeller University. Its discovery is important in the study of obesity which has become a problem in western society. The importance of leptin was discovered through experiments done on mice in a laboratory. Scientists found that mice who had more leptin in their bodies were thinner and didn't need to eat as much. Leptin levels can be increased by reducing stress and having quality or restful sleep."}

Marius Petipa and Ivan Vsevolojsky wrote the story of the ballet. It was based on Charles Perrault's 1697 fairy tale \"The Sleeping Beauty in the Wood\". Tchaikovsky wrote the music. Marius Petipa designed the dances. \"The Sleeping Beauty\" was first presented at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia, on 15 January 1890. Carlotta Brianza danced the Princess and Pavel Gerdt the Prince, with Marie Petipa as the Lilac Fairy and Enrico Cecchetti as Carabosse. It was first presented in Europe in a shortened version by the Ballets Russes in London on 2 November 1921. Catherine Littlefield designed the first complete \"Sleeping Beauty\" in the United States, and presented the production on 12 February 1937 at the Academy of Music, Philadelphia, with the Philadelphia Ballet.\nBackground.\nAbout ten years after Tchaikovsky's \"Swan Lake\" was presented for the first time, Tchaikovsky was asked to write a ballet for the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg. The ballet would be based on Charles Perrault's fairy tale \"The Sleeping Beauty in the Wood\". Tchaikovsky was very happy this story had been chosen. It was set in the age of Louis XIV. He would have the chance to write music in the Baroque style.\nPetipa gave Tchaikovsky very special directions about tempi, meter, and other musical matters. He even specified the length of particular pieces in exact numbers of bars. He asked for a Waltz in Act 1, a Mazurka in Act 2, and a Polonaise in Act 3. The ballet is tied together (and its drama and suspense heightened) through the repeated use of the two musical themes representing good and evil, personified by the Lilac Fairy and Carabosse respectively. Petipa's specifications stimulated Tchaikovsky's imagination, rather than hindered it as one might expect.\nTchaikovsky's interest in setting the tale reaches back to 1867. It was then that he wrote a little ballet on the story for the children of his sister Alexandra Davydova. He had done the same for \"Swan Lake\". In November 1888, he had a conference with theater officials and Petipa. A draft of the scenario was drawn up. Petipa provided Tchaikovsky with a detailed analysis of the musical requirements. The composer set to work, and finished the score on 1 September 1889.\nStory.\nPrologue.\nA brief overture contrasts the themes of the malicious Carabosse and the benevolent Lilac Fairy. When the curtain rises, the court assembles for Princess Aurora's christening. Six fairies present their gifts. Carabosse, a fairy overlooked by the master of ceremonies, enters. She curses Aurora. The Princess shall die on her 16th birthday, she says, after pricking her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel. The remaining seventh fairy the Lilac Fairy comes forward. She cannot put the curse to rest, but she can soften it. The Princess shall not die, she commands, but sleep one hundred years. At the end of that term, a Prince will awaken her with true love's kiss.\nAct 1.\nSixteen years after the christening of Princess Aurora, the court assembles in the palace gardens to celebrate Aurora's birthday. Villagers dance a waltz. Aurora dances an adagio with four noble suitors. Carabosse enters unnoticed and slips Aurora a spindle. The Princess pricks her finger on the spindle. She falls to the ground, sound asleep. The Princess is carried into the palace by the noble suitors. The Lilac Fairy puts the entire court to sleep, then causes a dense forest of trees and thorns to surround the castle.\nAct 2.\n\"Scene 1.\" \"The Prince's hunt. A woodland glade with a river in the background.\" The stage is empty. Hunting horns are heard. Prince Desire, his tutor Galifron, and his friends enter. They have paused in the hunt to take refreshments. Several dances are performed by various ladies of the court. The hunt is resumed. The Prince is tired so chooses to remain alone in the forest. Here, he meets the Lilac Fairy who emerges from a boat of mother of pearl on the river. She has chosen him as the prince to awaken princess Aurora, and presents various visions of the princess to him. He quickly falls in love with her from the visions and begs the Lilac Fairy to lead him to her. The Lilac Fairy guides him through the forest until they reach the enchanted castle where Aurora rests.\n\"Scene 2.\" \"Sleeping Beauty's castle.\" The Sleeping Beauty lies on a canopied bed. The King and Queen sleep in armchairs nearby. The courtiers and pages sleep standing up and leaning upon one another. Dust and cobwebs cover everything. The Lilac Fairy and the Prince enter. He tries to rouse the Princess and the court, but without success. The Lilac Fairy stands aside without interfering. The Prince kisses the Princess. She awakens. The dust and cobwebs disappear. The court awakens. The King grants the marriage of the Prince and Princess.\nAct 3.\n\"The Wedding of Prince D\u00e9sir\u00e9 and Princess Aurora on the esplanade of King Florestan's palace.\"\nThe court assembles to celebrate the marriage of Prince D\u00e9sir\u00e9 and Princess Aurora. The King and Queen make their entrances with the newlyweds. The festivities begin with a series of \"divertissements\". The Diamond, Gold, Silver, and Sapphire Fairies dance. Several fairy tale characters dance: Puss in Boots and the White Cat; the Bluebird and Princess Florine; Little Red Riding Hood and the Wolf; Cinderella and Prince Fortun\u00e9; and finally Hop o' My Thumb with his brothers and the ogre. The Prince and Princess dance a \"pas de deux\". Roman, Persian, Indian, American, and Turkish characters dance a Sarabande. The act ends with a \"tableau vivant\" representing the Glory of the Fairies. This \"tableau\" was changed to represent the Glory of Apollo."}

It was first published in Paris in 1697 by Claude Barbin in \"Histoires ou contes du temps pass\u00e9\" (), a collection of eight prose fairy tales by Perrault. \"Le Doie Pizzelle\" () is a similar tale in Giambattista Basile's \"Pentamerone\" (1550-53).

Iona and Peter Opie write, \"The theme of this tale is one of the most popular in the world, that of the proud and the privileged being brought low, and the meek and down-trodden being raised above them.\" Christopher Betts believes the tale was intended for a young audience, \"old enough to appreciate that the unkind sister is 'rude' ... but not enough to object to the scarcely disguised nannyish advice.\"\nStory.\nA widow has two daughters. The elder is ugly, selfish and rude. The younger is beautiful, kind and polite. The younger is sent to fetch water from a spring. An old woman dressed in rags (a fairy in disguise) asks for a drink of water. The girl politely gives her one. In thanks, the fairy causes diamonds and roses to drop from the girl's mouth whenever she speaks. At home, her mother is amazed. She sends her elder daughter to the spring. The girl meets a grandly-dressed lady (the fairy) who asks for a drink of water. The girl responds rudely. The fairy causes snakes and toads to drop from her mouth. At home, her mother is furious. She blames the younger sister. The girl runs into the woods. She meets a prince who falls in love and marries her. The elder sister dies after running away from home.

Charles Eames of \"The New World\" wrote, \"The force and boldness of the conception and the high artistic skill, with which the writer's purpose is wrought out, are equally admirable.\" Thomas Dunn English wrote in October 1845 that \"Ligeia\" was \"the most extraordinary, of its kind, of his productions\".\nIn 1964, director Roger Corman adapted the story to a movie, \"The Tomb of Ligeia\", starring Vincent Price."}

Valdemar\" is a short story by Edgar Allan Poe. It was first published in 1845. The tale tells of a dying, mesmerized man whose body disintegrates once the trance is lifted. Poe was inspired to write the tale after reading a description of an operation performed upon a mesmerized patient. The tale has a great deal of gore, leading to the speculation that Poe had studied medical texts. \"Valdemar\" has been adapted to the movies and to radio drama.\nPlot.\nThe narrator mesmerizes an ill friend, M. Valdemar. Valdemar reports first that he is dying and then that he is dead. The narrator leaves him in a mesmeric state for seven months. During this time Valdemar is without pulse, heartbeat, or breath. His skin is cold and pale. Finally, the narrator tries to wake him. Valdemar's swollen black tongue begs to be returned to sleep or to be fully wakened. He shouts \"dead! dead!\" repeatedly. The narrator takes Valdemar out of the trance and his body immediately disintegrates into a \"nearly liquid mass of loathsome\u2014of detestable putrescence.\"\nPublication history.\nPoe was inspired to write \"Valdemar\" after reading a letter about an operation on a mesmerized patient. The tale was published in December 1845 in two different New York journals. One used the title \"The Facts in M. Valdemar's Case\". In England, the tale was published first as \"Mesmerism in Articulo Mortis\" and later as \"The Last Days of M. Valdemar\".\nStyle.\nPoe employs detailed descriptions and high levels of gore in \"Valdemar\". He may have studied medical texts. Valdemar's eyes at one point leak a \"profuse outflowing of a yellowish ichor\", for example. The tale's imagery is summed up in the final lines: \"...his whole frame at once \u2014 within the space of a single minute, or even less, shrunk\u2014crumbled\u2014absolutely rotted away beneath my hands. Upon the bed, before that whole company, there lay a nearly liquid mass of loathsome\u2014of detestable putrescence.\" The disgusting imagery probably inspired later fiction including that of H. P. Lovecraft. Those final lines make up one of the most powerfully effective moments in Poe's work, incorporating shock, disgust, and uneasiness into one moment. This ending shows that attempts to appropriate power over death will have hideous results and, therefore, ultimately will be unsuccessful.\nAdaptations.\nMovie adaptations include a segment in Roger Corman's \"Tales of Terror\" (1962) and George A. Romero's \"Two Evil Eyes\" (1990). \"Edgar Allan Poe's Valdemar\" (2000) was a dramatic adaptation for National Public Radio."}

It is one of the most prevalent venomous snakes in Taiwan, which has caused snakebite incidents to humans.\nEtymology and names.\n\"Naja atra\" was first described by Danish physician, zoologist, and botanist Theodore Edward Cantor in 1842. The generic name \"naja\" is a Latinisation of the Sanskrit word () meaning \"cobra\". The specific epithet \"atra\" comes from the Latin term ater, which means \"dark\", \"black\", or \"gloomy\".\nIn Mandarin Chinese, the snake is known as \"Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 y\u01cenj\u00ecngsh\u00e9\" (\u4e2d\u83ef\u773c\u93e1\u86c7, lit. \"Chinese spectacled snake\", i.e. Chinese cobra), \"Zh\u014dush\u0101n y\u01cenj\u00ecngsh\u00e9\" (\u821f\u5c71\u773c\u93e1\u86c7, lit. \"Zhoushan spectacled snake\", i.e. Zhoushan cobra) or, in Guangdong and Hong Kong, \"f\u00e0nch\u01cent\u00f3u\" (\u98ef\u93df\u982d, lit. \"rice paddle head\"). \"Spectacled snake\" refers to the markings which the snake may at times have on the back of the hood that resemble eyeglasses. In Taiwanese, the snake is known as \"pn\u0304g-s\u00ee-chh\u00e8ng\" (\u98ef\u5319\u5029/\u9283, lit. \"rice paddle ?\"), \"ba\u030dk-ki\u00e0\u207f-ch\u00f4a\" (\u76ee\u93e1\u86c7, lit. \"spectacled snake\", i.e. cobra), or \"tn\u0302g-\u0101m-ch\u00f4a\" (\u9577\u9837\u86c7, lit. \"long-chinned snake\").\nDescription.\n\"Naja atra\" is iridescent black with a number of distant transversal double lines of a yellow colour. The abdominal surface is pearl or slaty coloured.\nThis medium-sized snake is usually long, but they can grow to a maximum length of though this is rare. The dorsal color of the Chinese cobra is usually brown, grey or black, with or without narrow, light transverse lines at irregular intervals which are especially prominent in juveniles. The head on this species is broad, slightly triangular in shape and is slightly distinct from the neck. The dorsal scales are smooth and glossy, while the dorsolateral scales are strongly oblique. This is a heavy bodied snake, the body is slightly flattened, and may be significantly flattened when threatened, and it has a short tail. The nostrils of this species are large and prominent. The eyes are medium-sized and the iris is a dark dirty yellow dappled with gray-black or blue-black and the pupil is round and jet black. Like other elapids, this is a proteroglyphous snake with fangs that are permanently erect and are located at the anterior of the upper jaw. The upper head is usually the same color as the tail and dorsal part of the body, while the sides of the head are lighter in colour. Specimens with other colors on their dorsal surface, such as white, yellow or brown do occur. There may be irregular or scattered crosslines of white to light gray along the upper body and a spectacle marking on the hood, however, the hood markings may vary from partial figures to asymmetrical patterns. The ventral head and neck are white to light gray or light orange in colour. The ventral face of the hood may have a pair of small dark spots followed by a dark transverse band.\nThere is some variation in the colour of the ventral body and tail: it may be white to gray, dark gray mottled with white, or blackish. The populations in different geographic regions of Taiwan reveal a unique composition of ventral colouration: the eastern population is exclusively blackish (100%), the central and southern populations are mainly white to gray (both 80%), and the proportions of blackish and white-gray morphs in the northern population are 60% and 30%, respectively.\nWhere it lives.\nThis species is found in southeastern China (including the provinces of Sichuan, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang, and the Island province of Hainan), Hong Kong, northern Laos, northern Vietnam, and Taiwan, where it is much more common in the south. \nHabitat.\nIts typical habitat is woodlands, shrublands, grasslands, and mangroves. This species is adaptable to a wide range of terrain including grassland plains, jungle, open fields and even heavily populated regions. As an adaptable species, it occurs in a wide variety of habitats across its range. It can be found in rice paddy fields in maritime lowlands to various types of montaine forests, though it avoids dark forest with closed canopy. In primary monsoon season and rain forests, \"Naja atra\" inhabits clearings and riverbanks. Higher population density is observed in the vicinity of human settlements, in secondary forests, and in rice paddy fields which are adjacent to forests. The species can be found anywhere from sea level all the way up to elevations of more than above sea level. It usually hides under leaves, sticks, and rocks.\nHow it acts.\nThe Chinese cobra is a very alert, seldom cornered, but if confronted will raise its forebody and spread its hood and strike readily if necessary. Adults can be very aggressive, but the younger tend to be more aggressive. The Chinese cobra usually escapes to avoid confrontation with humans, but strikes readily if provoked. The snake is terrestrial, diurnal and crepuscular which means it is active by day and twilight. This species has been observed hunting during all daylight periods and as late as 2\u20133 hours after sunset from March to October, with ambient temperatures of 20\u201332\u00b0C (68\u201390\u00b0F).\nWhat it eats.\nThe Chinese Cobra has a widely varied diet and it mainly preys on rodents such as mice and rats, frogs, toads and even other snakes. It is active during both the day and night. The diet of this snake is highly variable. It preys on any vertebrates from fish to mammals. Juveniles eat mosly amphibians, whereas adults usually prefer reptiles and mammals - during amphibian breeding periods, however, adult cobras eat mostly frogs or toads: the Cricket frog (\"Fejervarya limnocharis\"), the Common tree frog (\"Polypedates leucomystax\"), and the Asian common toad (\"Duttaphrynus melanostictus\").\nReproduction.\nIt is oviparous. Mating and egg-laying periods are very extended. The species has been observed mating in the mountains of the western Tonkin region, at elevations of in the months of March through May. As recorded, gravid females will lay between 6 and 23 eggs sometime between May through to the end of July. \nVenom.\nThe Chinese cobra is a highly venomous member of the true cobras (genus \"Naja\"). Its venom consists mainly of postsynaptic neurotoxins and cardiotoxins. Four cardiotoxin-analogues I, II, III, and IV, account for about 54% of the dry weight of the crude venom and have cytotoxic properties. The LD50 values of its venom in mice are 0.29\u00a0mg/kg IV, and a range of 0.53\u00a0mg/kg - 0.67\u00a0mg/kg SC. The average venom yield from a snake of this species kept at a snake farm was about 250.8\u00a0mg (80\u00a0mg dry weight). Although this is not a spitting cobra, some rare individuals (mostly specimens from Guizhou Province) are capable of ejecting venom towards a threat within a distance of .\nLocal symptoms in victims caused by Chinese cobra are wound darkening, localized redness and swelling, pain, insensibility, and invariably blisters and necrosis. Necrosis is a serious problem in cases of cobra bite as it may persist for many years after the general recovery of the victim. The following systemic symptoms may also occur: chest discomfort, fever, sore throat, difficulty in swallowing, loss of voice, weak feeling in limbs, walking haltingly, general ache, lockjaw, and difficulty in breathing. Fatality occasionally occurs. The antivenom is widely available and deaths are much rarer than they used to be."}

It is about human mortality and the fact that death cannot be stopped. It was first published in \"Graham's Magazine\" in 1843. It was incorporated into Poe's short story \"Ligeia\" in 1845. In the revised story, the poem is composed by Ligeia. She teaches it to the narrator during her death throes.\nStory.\nWeeping angels watch a play performed by \"mimes, in the form of God on high\", and controlled by vast formless shapes looming behind the scenes. The mimes chase a \"Phantom\" which they can never capture. Finally, a monstrous \"crawling shape\" emerges, and eats the mimes. The final curtain comes down, \"a funeral pall,\" signaling an end to the \"tragedy, 'Man'\" whose only hero is \"The Conqueror Worm\".\nInterpretation.\nThough Poe was referring to an ancient connection between worms and death, he may have been inspired by \"The Proud Ladye\", a poem by Spencer Wallis Cone which was reviewed in an 1840 issue of \"Burton's Gentleman's Magazine\". That poem contained the lines \"Let him meet the conqueror worm / With his good sword by his side\".\nRole in \"Ligeia\".\nThe poem plays an important symbolic role as part \"Ligeia.\" The poem is written by Ligeia as she is dying, though it is actually recited by the narrator, her husband.\nBecause it emphasizes the finality of death, it calls to question Ligeia's resurrection in the story. Also, the inclusion of the bitter poem may have been meant to be ironic or a parody of the convention at the time, both in literature and in life. In the mid-19th century it was common to emphasize the sacredness of death and the beauty of dying (consider Charles Dickens's Little Johnny character in \"Our Mutual Friend\" and the death of Helen Burns in Charlotte Bront\u00eb's \"Jane Eyre\"). Instead, Ligeia speaks of fear personified in the \"blood-red thing.\"\n\"The Conqueror Worm\" also uses the word \"evermore\", which would later evolve into \"nevermore\" in Poe's famous poem \"The Raven\" in 1845.\nPublication history.\n\"The Conqueror Worm\" was first published as a stand-alone poem in the January 1843 issue of \"Graham's Magazine\". Shortly after, it was included among several other poems by Poe in the February 25 issue of the \"Saturday Museum\" in a feature called \"The Poets &amp; Poetry of Philadelphia: Edgar Allan Poe\". It was later included in Poe's poetry collection \"The Raven and Other Poems\" in 1845. That same year, it was incorporated into \"Ligeia\" for the first time when the story was reprinted in the February 15, 1845, issue of the \"New York World\". \"Ligeia\" was again republished with \"The Conqueror Worm\" in the September 27, 1845, issue of \"The Broadway Journal\" while Poe was its editor.

Players slide \"curling stones\" on the ice towards a target, called the \"house\". There are two teams with four players on each team. Each team slides eight stones, this is called an \"end\". After an end the team with the stone closest to the centre of the house (target) scores points. The game is over after eight or ten ends. The team with the most points is the winner.\nThe player sliding the stone can make it turn or \"curl\" slowly. Two other players on the team sweep the ice in front of the stone with brooms. This is to make the stone stop in the right place.\nCurling is played at the Winter Olympics.\nHistory.\nCurling was invented in Scotland in medieval times. It was played outside in the winter because there was lots of ice. Today curling is played all over Europe and in many other countries such as Canada, the United States, Japan and South Korea.\nCurling was played at the Winter Olympics for the first time in 1998.\nEquipment.\nThe ice is called a \"curling sheet\". It is a rectangular sheet of flat ice, between 146 and 150 feet (45-46 metres) long and 14.5 to 15.5 feet (4.4-5.0 metres) wide. The house, or target, is marked at the end of the sheet by coloured rings. The rings help players to aim for the centre of the house. They are also useful to decide which stone is closest to the centre when scoring. There is also a \"hack\" at the end of the sheet which players push against when sliding a stone.\nCurling stones are made of granite. They are heavy, weighing 38-40 pounds (17-20kg). There is a handle on the top of each stone to help slide and turn the stone. The handles are different colours for each team. The stones are usually red for one team and yellow for the other team. \nCurling brooms or brushes are used to sweep the ice in front of the stone when it is sliding. \nPlayers wear special shoes for curling. One shoe has a smooth surface for sliding on the ice and the other rough.\nGameplay.\nThe purpose of the game is to score points by getting stones close to the centre of the house. Players from each team take turns to slide a stone towards the house. This is called \"delivering\" or \"throwing\" a stone. An end is completed when all stones have been delivered. There are eight stones for each team. The winner is the team with the most points after all ends have been played. There are usually eight or ten ends.\nDelivery and sweeping.\nThe captain of the team is called the \"skip\". The skip chooses how hard the stone should be delivered, the direction of delivery, and the amount of turn (curl) that the stone should be given. The skip can choose to aim the stone for the house, hit one of the other team's stones out of play, or make a stone stop before the house as a guard if their team has a stone in a good position.\nThe player delivering the stone starts at the hack. The skip stands at the other end of the curling sheet behind the house. The skip shows where to aim the stone. The other two players sweep the ice in front of the stone as it slides. The players take turns to deliver stones. When the skip is delivering a stone another player stands behind the house instead.\nTo deliver a stone the player puts one foot on the hack. The player lines up towards the skip. The stone is on the ice in front of the foot in the hack. The player then slides the stone back before sliding forwards on their other foot. The player lets go of the stone, gently turning the handle just before letting go to give the stone curl.\nThen the other players can sweep the stone. Sweeping helps the stone to travel faster, and makes it curl less. The aim of sweeping is to help the stone stop in the right place.\nScoring.\nPoints are scored at when an end has finished. The team with the stone closest to the centre of the house wins the end. The team scores one point for every stone that is closer to the centre than the other team's closest stone. \nOnly stones that are in the house count for scoring. If it is difficult to see which stone is closest to the centre of the house there are special measuring devices to help.\nSometimes neither team scores any points, this is called a \"blank end\"."}

It is based on the story of Samson and Delilah in the Old Testament of the Bible. The words and story of the opera (the \"libretto\") were written by Ferdinand Lemaire. The music was written by Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns. The opera was first performed in Weimar, Germany on 2 December 1877. It was sung in German instead of French.\nSaint-Sa\u00ebns thought the Samson story would make a good oratorio. He was persuaded by Lemaire to write an opera on the subject instead. When the opera was completed, Saint-Sa\u00ebns met some stiff opposition about staging it in France. It was considered sacrilegious to stage a work based on a Bible story. Additionally, Saint-Sa\u00ebns was considered a \"symphonist\" rather than an opera composer. People were not interested in \"Samson\". Liszt staged the work in Germany. It was a hit. It was soon staged in America and in England. \nRoles in the opera include Samson (tenor), Delilah (mezzo-soprano), and the High Priest of Dagon (baritone). The story tells of the enslavement of the Hebrews by the Philistines. Samson urges them to resist their masters. The High Priest of Dagon uses Delilah to destroy Samson. Musical highlights include \" and \" The opera finally played the Paris Op\u00e9ra. It ranked second in popularity to Charles Gounod's \"Faust\".\nComposition of the opera.\nSaint-Sa\u00ebns thought the Samson and Delilah story would make a good oratorio. Oratorios were popular in the late 1860s. The city of Paris was offering a prize for a new one. Saint-Sa\u00ebns asked a relative, Ferdinand Lemaire, to write the libretto. Lemaire thought the story of Samson and Delilah was better suited to an opera. He persuaded Saint-Sa\u00ebns to write an opera instead of an oratorio. \nSaint-Sa\u00ebns was drawn to the story because it gave him the opportunity to compose a grand duet against a rising storm. He knew Rameau's take on the story from Voltaire's libretto for an opera on the subject (now lost), but Rameau's storm was a metaphor for the wrath of God. Rossini's \"Otello\" was nearer to what Saint-Sa\u00ebns had in mind. He wrote, \"I imagined a storm that would no longer be an hors-d'\u0153uvre (a tidbit eaten before a meal) but adhere to the action and become one with it.\"\nSaint-Sa\u00ebns set to work in 1868. He wrote an aria for Delilah, a duet for Samson and Delilah, and the Prelude. He tried them out at home. Friends were not very interested. The composer put the work aside for a time. He met Liszt in Weimar, Germany about 1870. Liszt encouraged him to take up the project again. He promised Saint-Sa\u00ebns he would stage the opera.\nEarly performances.\nIn 1873 Saint-Sa\u00ebns finished the score. Pauline Viardot staged Act 2 in a garden at Croissy. The director of the Paris Opera was present. He found the opera too Wagnerian. He also thought it neglected French opera tradition. Biblical stories were not staged in France. It was considered sacrilegious. Act 1 was performed \"concert style\" in 1875. This means it was performed without costumes, scenery, or \"acting\". It was a failure.\nSaint-Sa\u00ebns kept working. He published the score. He wrote a dedication to Viardot. In 1877 Liszt staged the work at the Weimar Court Theatre in Germany. It was sung in German instead of French. The opera was well received. People liked it. Paris wasn't very interested, though. In 1890 the opera was staged in Rouen at composer Gabriel Faure's urging. It was staged the same year in Paris. Two years later it was finally staged at the Paris Op\u00e9ra. The opera ranked second in popularity to Gounod's \"Faust\".\nOther early performances.\nOnce the opera gained favor with audiences it quickly spread outside France. The first production in America was at New Orleans in 1893. In 1894 it was staged at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City. In these early days, productions were mounted in Milan, St Petersburg, and Moscow. French singers walked out on a concert performance in London in 1893. They were expected to sing in English instead of French. Biblical stories were banned from the stage in Britain. The first full production of \"Samson\" took place in 1909. King Edward VII of England was said to have helped get the opera staged.\nAssessment.\nGoodwin writes that Saint-Sa\u00ebns's pupil and friend Gabriel Faure always said that the reason \"Samson and Delilah\" met with disinterest in France was the fact that the composer was viewed as a symphonistnot because the opera was based on a Biblical text. \"Symphonist\" was a pejorative term at the time. It was tossed about by opera and ballet fans. \"Samson and Delilah\" was also a departure from 19th century opera traditions. This was another reason for some to ignore it. It was a three-act opera rather than a standard five-act opera as laid down by Meyerbeer. The opera featured only three principal charactersSamson, Delilah, and the High Priestthus creating another departure from the norm. \nSaint-Sa\u00ebns was almost an atheist. He did not point out a moral in this opera but let the work speak for itself. He admired the operas of Verdi. He liked the oratorios of Handel and Mendelssohntwo composers whose influence is felt in the choruses of \"Samson\". He framed the central seduction scene with the two outer acts. In contrast with Samson (strength) and the High Priest (power), Delilah is a character of \"seductive\" strength and power. She wants Samson on her sidenot for lovebut for her own vanity and sexual gratification. She puts everything she has into successfully seducing him because, if she fails, her head will be on the chopping block.\nStory of the opera.\nAct 1.\nIn a square in Gaza, the Hebrews pray for release from slavery to the Philistines. Samson tries to lift their spirits. Abimelech taunts the Hebrews. He says his god Dagon is greater than the Hebrew god. Samson defies him. Abimelech attacks Samson with a sword. Samson disarms and kills him. The Hebrews flee. The High Priest of Dagon makes plans to use Delilah to trap Samson. \nDelilah enters with the priestesses of Dagon. She flirts with Samson. She invites him to her home in Sorek. An old Hebrew warns Samson about loving Delilah. Samson prays for God's protection. Delilah and the priestesses begin to dance. Samson fights his desire for Delilah. The old Hebrew repeats his warning. As the curtain closes, Samson meets Delilah's gaze. It is clear he will join her in Sorek.\nAct 2.\nIn Sorek Delilah sings about her power over Samson. The High Priest arrives. He reports that Samson and the Hebrews have destroyed the harvest. He offers gold to Delilah to trap Samson. She refuses to take the money. She wants only revenge. Delilah vows to find the secret of Samson's strength. The High Priest leaves.\nDelilah considers her chances of success. Samson arrives to say farewell. He plans to lead the Hebrew revolt. Delilah tells Samson that she loves him. He admits that he loves her. They sing rapturously. Delilah wants to know the secret of his strength. Samson will not tell her. She weeps and runs into her house. Samson follows. She learns the secret of his strength. She calls to Philistine soldiers hiding nearby. They capture Samson and blind him.\nAct 3.\nSamson is chained to a mill-wheel in a dungeon. He prays for his people. They will suffer for his sin. Samson offers his life as a sacrifice. The Hebrews are heard in the distance singing sorrowfully. \nThe Philistines are preparing a victory celebration in the temple of Dagon. The priests and priestesses sing softly. The priests dance a wild Bacchanale. Samson enters led by a boy. He is mocked by the High Priest. Delilah taunts him. The priests try to force him to kneel before a statue of Dagon. The boy leads him to the two main pillars in the temple. Samson prays for strength. He pulls down the pillars. The temple collapses. Samson is crushed with his enemies beneath the stones.\nMusical highlights.\n\"from Encyclopedia Americana, 2002; volume 24, pages 185-86\""}

When Madame Flora, or \"Baba\" as they call her, arrives home drunk, she violently chastises them for not preparing for that night's seance. Soon the guests arrive, Mr. and Mrs. Gobineau, regulars, and the widow Mrs. Nolan who is attending for the first time. With Madame Flora in a trance in her chair, a fake seance is held where Mrs. Nolan speaks with what she thinks is her deceased sixteen-year-old daughter but is really Monica behind a screen. As Monica disappears, Mrs. Nolan rushes toward the figure and is restrained by the Gobineaus. When order is restored, Mr. and Mrs. Gobineau \"communicate\" with their deceased two-year-old son Mickey who does nothing but laugh. After they say goodbye to him, Madame Flora \"suddenly, with a loud gasp... clutches at her throat with both hands.\" She feels a phantom hand clutching her throat and is \"terror-stricken.\" After demanding that the guests leave, she calls for Monica and tells her what she felt, eventually blaming Toby who was in the other room the whole time. In an effort to calm Baba's drunken rage toward Toby, Monica sings her the dark lullaby \"The Black Swan\" which is interrupted by a voice that Baba hears causing her to fly into a terrified rage at Toby for not telling her where the voice is coming from. The act ends with Monica again singing the lullaby while Baba recites her Hail Marys.\nAct 2.\n\"A few days later\"\nToby is giving a puppet show for Monica, their mutual love becomes more obvious. When Baba comes home, she resumes her accusations on Toby, sure that he knows what went on that night.

But the guests are not convinced and leave claiming that while she might have thought she was cheating them, she in fact was not. Once the guests are gone, she drives Toby out despite Monica's pleas on his behalf. With everyone gone, and Monica in her room, Baba pours herself another drink and questions her own sanity, becoming wild with drink and eventually passing out. Once she has fallen asleep, Toby sneaks back in and tries to get into Monica's room, but finds it locked and eventually goes to the trunk to find his tambourine. While searching, he knocks the lid of the trunk down waking Baba. Toby quickly hides in the puppet theater.

It has been used for people of African ancestry as well as people from other places. \"Negro\" means 'black' in Spanish and Portuguese. It comes from the Latin word \"niger\" which means 'black'. \nIt is usually considered an offensive term nowadays. Words such as 'black' or 'African American' are preferred.\nHistory.\n\"Negro\" replaced the term \"colored\" as the more polite term. This was done when the term \"black\" was more offensive. This use of the word was accepted as normal during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s. It was accepted even by the people it was used to describe. One example of this is Martin Luther King, Jr. using the term \"negro\" when talking about his own race in his 1963 speech \"I Have a Dream\".\nDuring the Civil Rights Movement, some African American leaders in the United States did not like this word. People like Malcolm X wanted the word \"Black\" to be used. This was because they saw a connection between the term \"Negro\" and slavery, segregation, and discrimination.\nThe word is now usually considered offensive and outdated. Since the late 1960s, many other terms have been more commonly used. These include \"Black\", \"Black African\", \"Afro-American\" and \"African American\". The words \"African American\" have been used in the United States to refer to Black Americans.\nModern day.\nThe term \"Negro\" is still used in some ways. It is used by the United Negro College Fund and the Negro league in sports.\nThe United States Census Bureau said that \"Negro\" would be used on the 2010 United States Census, with \"Black\" and \"African-American\". This was because some older black Americans still feel this is the word that describes them.\nIn English.\nAround 1442 the Portuguese first went to sub-Saharan Africa. They were trying to find a way to get to India by boat. The term \"negro\" was used by the Spanish and Portuguese as a simple description of people. It means \"black\". From the 18th century to the late 1960s, \"negro\" was the proper English-language term for most people of sub-Saharan African origin.\nMost people stopped using the word \"Negro\" by the early 1970s in the United States. Many older African Americans grew up when \"Negro\" was \"widely\" said to be the correct term. They thought the term \"Black\" was more offensive than \"Negro.\" This can be seen by the use the word by historical African-American organizations and institutions. Currently, \"Negro\" is \"generally\" thought to be not offensive when used in a historical way. For example, baseball's Negro Leagues of the early and mid-20th century. It is also used in the name of older organizations. These include Negro spirituals, the United Negro College Fund or the Journal of Negro Education. The U.S. Census now uses \"Black, African-American or Negro.\" The term \"Negro\" is used to try to include older African Americans who think it is a better term."}

It premiered in 1880. The serenade consists of four movements:\nTchaikovsky intended the first movement to be an imitation of Mozart's style. It was based on the form of the classical sonatina, with a slow introduction. The 36-bar \"Andante\" introduction is marked \"sempre marcatissimo\". It is littered with double-stopping in the violins and violas. This introduction returns at the end of the movement. It reappears, transformed, in the coda of the fourth movement. Tchaikovsky intended the work for a large string orchestra. On the second page of the score, he wrote, \"The larger the string orchestra, the better will the composer's desires be fulfilled.\" George Balanchine used the work for his ballet \"Serenade\" in 1934Excerpts from the score were used in the 2005 ballet \"Anna Karenina\", choreographed by Boris Eifman. The waltz was arranged for soprano and full orchestra for the 1945 MGM movie \"Anchors Aweigh\". It was performed by Kathryn Grayson with Jos\u00e9 Iturbi conducting the MGM studio orchestra."}

These metals are characterized by being silvery, very soft, not very dense and having low melting points. These metals react extremely vigorously with water and even oxygen to produce energy and flammable hydrogen gas. They are kept in mineral oil to reduce the chance of an unwanted reaction or worse, an explosion.\nThe elements in group 2, known as the\u00a0alkaline earth metals\u00a0(except helium), always lose their two valence electrons to make a +2 ion. Like the alkali metals, the alkaline earth metals are silvery, shiny and relatively soft. Some of the elements in this column also react vigorously with water and must be stored carefully.\nS- elements are famous for being ingredients in fireworks. The ionic forms of potassium, strontium and barium make appearances in firework displays as the brilliant purples, reds and greens.\nFrancium is considered to be the most rare naturally occurring element on earth. It is estimated that there is only ever one natural atom of Francium present on earth at a time. Francium has a very unstable nucleus and undergoes nuclear decay rapidly. \nChemical properties of alkali metals \n1.Alkali metals react with dry hydrogen to form hydrides. \na.These hydrides are ionic in nature \nb.These hydrides of alkali metals react with water to form corresponding hydroxides and hydrogen gas. \nLiH+ H2O-&gt;LiOH+H2 \nc.These hydrides are strong reducing agents and their reducing nature increases down the group. \nd.Alkali metals also form complex hydrides such as LiAlH4 which is a good reducing agent.Alkali metal hydrides do not exist in water and this reaction with any other agent is carried out in protic solvent. \ne.Fused alkali metal hydrides on electrolysis produce H2 gas at anode. \n2.Formation of oxides and hydroxides. \na.These are most reactive metals and have strong affinity towards O2 ,they form oxides on surface.They are kept under kerosene or paraffin oil to protect them from air. \nb.When burnt in air (O2) ,li forms Li20 , Na forms Na 2O2 and other alkali metals form superoxides.\n3. They are purely metallic , as they lose the electrons from the outermost shell readily , they are highly reactive metals and they have low ionization energy .\n4. Beryllium is amphoteric in nature .\nDiagonal relationship.\nThe first element in group one, Lithium, and the first in group two, Beryllium, behave differently to other members of their groups. Their behaviour is like the second element of the next group. So lithium is similar to magnesium, and beryllium is similar to aluminum.\nIn the periodic table this is known as a 'diagonal relationship'. The diagonal relationship is because of similarities in ionic sizes and charge/radius ratio of the element. The similarity between lithium and magnesium is because of their similar sizes:\nLithium.\nLithium has many different behaviours to other elements in group one. This difference caused by:\nSome of the ways in which lithium behaves differently from other members of are:"}

Vought could not keep up with demand for the aircraft, so Goodyear and Brewster made them. It was deployed in large numbers starting in 1944, and has longest production run of any piston-engined fighter in U.S. history (1942\u20131953).\nThe Corsair was used by the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marines, Fleet Air Arm and the Royal New Zealand Air Force, as well as the French Navy \"A\u00e9ronavale\" and other, smaller, air forces. Some Japanese pilots said it was the best American fighter of World War II, and the U.S. Navy reported an 11:1 kill ratio. Besides serving as a fighter, it became the most capable carrier-based fighter-bomber of World War II.\nThe Corsair also saw action in the Korean War and in the 1969 Soccer War. The Grumman F6F Hellcat was easier to fly The Corsair had early problems landing on an aircraft carrier, so its first combat flights were from land bases.There were three different types of the Corsair. \nThe Corsair had high agility. With its Pratt and Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp 18-cylinder engine producing over 2000 horsepower, the Corsair was the first US single engine fighter to fly faster than 400 miles per hour. \nDuring the war, the Corsair flew over 64,000 sorties, shot down over 2,000 enemy aircraft, and only lost 189 planes in action to the enemy. The aircraft designer, Rex Beisel, developed a new inverted gull wing design. This allowed the landing gear to be short and sturdy while still providing ground clearance for the propeller. "}

He is best known for his lush romantic movies of the 1950s such as \"All That Heaven Allows\". His movies were thought banal and unimportant by contemporary critics. Today however they are regarded as masterpieces and ironic commentaries on American life and society. \nSirk's life and work.\nSirk was born Hans Detlef Sierck in Hamburg, Germany. His parent were Danish. He grew up in Denmark, but moved to Germany as a teenager. His theater career began in 1922 and his movie career in 1934. He left Germany in 1937. By 1942 he was directing movies in Hollywood. He is famous for lush romantic movies made between 1952 and 1958. At the height of his career, he quit making movies. He left the United States. Sirk died in Lugano, Switzerland about thirty years later. In 1985, he was awarded the Bavarian Film Award, Honorary Award.\nWhat the critics thought.\nSirk's movies were very successful at the box office, but the critics did not like them. They thought his movies unimportant and banal because they were about women and exaggerated emotions. His conspicuous style was considered unrealistic. Critical opinion changed in the 1970s. Analysis revealed Sirk's movies actually criticized American society beneath a banal surface plot. His movies are now regarded as masterpieces of irony. Sirk's reputation was also helped by a widespread nostalgia for old-fashioned Hollywood films. His movies have influenced other directors. Todd Haynes's \"Far From Heaven\", for example, is a conscious attempt to replicate a typical Sirk movie. Roger Ebert has remarked that \"To appreciate a film like \"Written on the Wind\" probably takes more sophistication than to understand one of Ingmar Bergman's masterpieces, because Bergman's themes are visible and underlined, while with Sirk the style conceals the message.\""}

It stars Rock Hudson, Lauren Bacall, Robert Stack, and Dorothy Malone. Douglas Sirk directed. The movie is based on Robert Wilder's 1945 novel of the same name. The book is a thinly disguised account of the real-life scandal involving torch singer Libby Holman and her husband, tobacco heir Zachary Smith Reynolds. Dorothy Malone won the Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for her performance.\nStory.\nMarylee is a self-destructive, alcoholic nymphomaniac. Her brother Kyle is an insecure, alcoholic playboy. They are the spoiled children of Texas oil baron Jasper Hadley. The two are crippled by their personal demons. Neither is able to sustain a personal relationship.\nProblems begin when Kyle marries Lucy Moore. He resumes drinking after failing to father a child. He turns against his childhood friend, Mitch Wayne. Kyle's anger and depression deepen after the death of his father. Jasper had admired Mitch, but was disgusted with his own two children.\nMitch is secretly in love with Lucy. He keeps these feelings private. Kyle is diagnosed with a low sperm count. Lucy announces she is pregnant. Kyle assaults her. He thinks the baby belongs to Mitch. The assault results in a miscarriage. Mitch vows to leave town with Lucy as soon as she's well enough to travel. A drunken Kyle grabs a pistol. He intends to shoot Mitch. Marylee struggles with her brother. The pistol accidentally fires. Kyle is killed.\nMarylee has long been infatuated with Mitch. He has repeatedly spurned her. She spitefully threatens to name Mitch as Kyle's killer. At the inquest, she first testifies that he killed Kyle. At the last moment she admits the truth. Mitch and Lucy leave. Marylee is left alone to mourn her brother's death.\nWhat the critics thought.\nBosley Crowther wrote in the \"New York Times\", \"The trouble with this romantic picture ... is that nothing really happens, the complications within the characters are never clear and the sloppy, self-pitying fellow at the center of the whole thing is a bore.\" \"TV Guide\" describes the film as \"the ultimate in lush melodrama ... Douglas Sirk's finest directorial effort ... one of the most notable critiques of the American family ever made.\"\nRoger Ebert writes, \"a perverse and wickedly funny melodrama in which you can find the seeds of \"Dallas\", \"Dynasty\", and all the other prime-time soaps. Sirk is the one who established their tone, in which shocking behavior is treated with passionate solemnity, while parody burbles beneath ... To appreciate a film like \"Written on the Wind\" probably takes more sophistication than to understand one of Ingmar Bergman's masterpieces, because Bergman's themes are visible and underlined, while with Sirk the style conceals the message. His interiors are wildly over the top, and his exteriors are phony - he wants you to notice the artifice, to see that he's not using realism but an exaggerated Hollywood studio style ... Films like this are both above and below middle-brow taste. If you only see the surface, it's trashy soap opera. If you can see the style, the absurdity, the exaggeration and the satirical humor, it's subversive of all the 1950s dramas that handled such material solemnly. William Inge and Tennessee Williams were taken with great seriousness during the decade, but Sirk kids their Freudian hysteria.\""}

Idioms are a common stumbling block for learners of a language.\nIn other words, after an attempt has been made to score a goal, the goalposts are moved to exclude the attempt. The problem with changing the rules of the game is that the meaning of the result is changed too. It counts for less.\nBullying.\nThe tactics of bullying behaviour include moving the goalposts.

There are several versions of it, including \"The Sleeping Beauty in the Wood\" by Charles Perrault and \"Briar Rose\" or \"Little Briar Rose\" () by the Brothers Grimm. The story is about a princess who falls into a deep sleep for one hundred years, and is awoken by a heroic prince.\nPerrault's version first appeared in 1695 in a hand-written and illustrated manuscript called \"Tales of Mother Goose\" () along with \"Little Red Riding Hood\", \"Bluebeard\", \"Puss in Boots\", and \"Diamonds and Toads\". It was next published in the newspaper \"Mercure galant\" in 1696. It was revised, and published in Paris in 1697 by Claude Barbin in \"Histoires ou contes du temps pass\u00e9\" (), a collection of eight fairy tales by Perrault. It has been adapted to various media including a pantomime by James Robinson Planch\u00e9, a ballet, and a Disney animated movie.\nThe Grimms published their version in \"Children's and Household Tales\" () in 1812.\nVersions.\nTales similar to Perrault's include \"Troylus and Zelladine\" from the 14th-century French work \"Perceforest\", the Catalan collection \"Frayre de Joy e Sor de Placer\", the story of Brynhild from the \"Saga of the Volsungs\", and \"Sun, Moon, and Talia\" from Giambattista Basile's \"Pentamerone\" (1636). Tchaikovsky's Ballet \"Sleeping Beauty\" is roughly based on Perrault's version; and Disney published 1959 their animatic Sleeping Beauty Version - a Mixture out of the former versions and mostly Tchaikovsky's Ballet.\nThere are slight differences between the Grimms's version of the sleeping princess tale and that of Perrault. The Grimms's Briar Rose is released from her sleep by a kiss from the prince while Perrault's princess wakes when the prince simply kneels beside her.\nMaria Tatar writes, \"The Grimms' \"Sleeping Beauty\" has a narrative integrity that has made it more appealing than [Basile and Perrault], at least in the United States.\" She explains that the version of the Grimms discards the post-marital conflicts of Basile and Perrault that were probably separate narratives at one time. Tatar believes Briar Rose is the stereotypical passive fairy tale heroine who simply waits for a man to come along to free her from a near catatonic state.\nStory.\nA king and queen long for a child. A frog in the queen's bath foretells the future birth of a baby. The queen gives birth to a daughter. The king and queen host a celebration (a christening in the Perrault version). In the Perrault version, they invite seven good fairies; in the Grimms' version, they invite twelve \"wise women\". Another, evil woman (or fairy) appears who puts a curse on the infant princess. She says that the princess will one day prick her finger on a spindle and die. One of the good women softens the curse. Instead of dying, the princess will sleep for one hundred years.\nThe king orders all spindles to be burnt to protect his daughter. When she is about fifteen or sixteen, however, the princess finds an old woman spinning in a tower room. The princess handles the spindle and pricks her finger. She falls into a deep sleep. The good fairy puts everyone in the castle to sleep. A thorny forest or a hedge of roses springs up and surrounds the castle to protect the sleeping princess.\nOne hundred years pass. A prince has heard fabulous tales of the place and wants to find the princess. He arrives at the castle and finds the sleeping princess in the tower room. In the Grimms' version, he wakes her with a kiss; Perrault's princess wakes when the prince simply kneels beside her. The prince and the princess get married.\nThe Perrault version continues further. The prince and princess have two children. The prince goes off to war. His wife and children stay with his mother. She is an ogress. She wants to eat her guests. A servant saves them. The ogress is furious. She decides to put the princess and her children into a cauldron filled with toads and snakes. The prince arrives. His wife and children are saved. The ogress jumps head first into the cauldron and dies."}

It contained 86 stories. The second volume of 70 stories was published in 1814. For the second edition, two volumes were issued in 1819 and a third in 1822, totalling 170 tales. The third edition appeared in 1837; fourth edition, 1840; fifth edition, 1843; sixth edition, 1850; seventh edition, 1857. Stories were added, and also deleted, from one edition to the next, until the seventh held 211 tales. All editions were extensively illustrated, first by Philipp Grot Johann and, after his death in 1892, by Robert Leinweber.\nThe first volumes were much criticized because they were considered unsuitable for children, both for the scholarly information included and the subject matter. Many changes through the editions\u00a0\u2013 such as turning the wicked mother of the first edition in \"Snow White\" and \"Hansel and Gretel\" to a stepmother, were probably made with an eye to such criticism. They removed sexual references\u2014such as Rapunzel's innocently asking why her dress was getting tight around her belly, and thus na\u00efvely revealing her pregnancy and the prince's visits to her stepmother\u2014but, in many respects, violence, particularly when punishing villains, was increased. In 1825, the Grimms published their \"Kleine Ausgabe\" or \"small edition,\" a selection of 50 tales designed for child readers. This children's version went through ten editions between 1825 and 1858.\nThe work of the Brothers Grimm influenced other collectors, both inspiring them to collect tales and leading them to similarly believe, in a spirit of romantic nationalism, that the fairy tales of a country were particularly representative of it, to the neglect of cross-cultural influence. Among those influenced were the Russian Alexander Afanasyev, the Norwegians Peter Christen Asbj\u00f8rnsen and J\u00f8rgen Moe, the English Joseph Jacobs, and Jeremiah Curtin, an American who collected Irish tales."}

Its rulers were descended from Chaudhary Phul (1627-1689), a Sidhu Jat from Mehraj village in the Bathinda District of Punjab. The other Sikh states, such as Jind and Nabha, were also the descendants of Phul. Its capital was in the Malva region of Punjab, but its territory expanded from Bathinda to present-day Mohali. They were known as the Phulkian (Patiala) Dynasty.\nThe House of Phul, was a Jatt of Sidhu Clan, belonging to the Malva Region of Punjab. Their ancestors had converted to Sikhism in the early 1600s. They claim to be the descendants from the sidhu jats, who ruled in the 11th century. The migrated to the Malva region of Punjab, establishing themselves at present day Bathinda District of Punjab. \nThe Sidhu Jatts and the Bhullar Jatts of the Bathinda district, never got along with each other, They were at war. But later Nanu Bhullar, got his daughter married in the house of these Sidhu Jatts, the ancestors of the Patiala State. \nThey were known as the Phulkian (Patiala) Dynasty. Ahmed Shah Abdali, Afghan Ruler and Maharaja Ala Singh became friends, the Sikh Chieftains of Punjab did not Like this so the Dal Khalsa met at Akal Takhat in Amritsar in 1765, in which it was decided that Patiala should be kicked out of the Dal Khalsa. And it will not be part of the 12 Sikh Confederacies, it was also the year when Ala Singh died and his son Amar Singh had become the next ruler. Ahmed Shah Abdali, bestowed upon Maharajah Amar Singh, the title of Raja-i-Rajgan, and he also was allowed to strike his own coins. But the Sikh Nation was not to happy about this, and in years to come they the Phulkians would be traitors to the Khalsa Panth, and helping the British to attack the Sikh interior of Punjab. \nEven when Sardar Hari Singh Dhillon (r.1746-1764), the Sikh Bhangi Misl Maharaja of Amritsar, Tarn Taran Sahib and Lahore, found out about Ahmed Shah Abdali being in the Patiala Kingdom, he marched with a big army of dashing looking Sikh soldiers from the Majha, where the holy city of Amritsar is located, on Patiala Kingdom to chase the Ahmed Shah away, but on the way he was killed, by someone. Years later his younger son Sardar Ganda Singh Dhillon (d. 1776), the Maharajah of Lahore and Amritsar, married of his daughter Bibi Rattan Kaur, to Maharajah Sahib Singh of Patiala in 1787, the marriage took place at Amritsar. Five years later he remarried Bibi As kaur, the daughter of Sardar Gurdas Singh Chatha. It is As kaur, who's Sons and Grandsons ruled on. \nFrom 1809-1947, the Phulkian State, had good relations with the British Government, the Patiala State, royal family, were not Orthodox Sikhs, but very secular/mixed rulers. Very mixed with the East India Company. A time when the Sikh Kingdoms did not like British, visiting their Land, Patiala, was the first to call the British, In his territory. The later royal family became Congress, an Indian party, after the break up of Dynasty. \nRajasthani Paintings within Patiala.\nPatiala State, was different from other Sikh States, as it did not support Sikh religion, and not following the Sikh rules. But still the State religion was Sikhism. The Later Patiala Maharajahs (Karam Singh) introduced Hindu Paintings of Hindu Gods within their Qila Mubarak palace in Patiala, it can still be seen, on the Palace Walls. Showing great respect to all religions. Rajput Hindu Paintings were very famous in Patiala from 1800s, The Maharajahs got them selves painted in Rajput Styles.

As Maharajah Narinder Singh, in 1859, married of his third daughter Maharani Bishan Kaur, to Rajah Jaswant Singh, (1851-1893), Jat ruler of Bharatpur State. Intermarriage between the Phulkian Jatts, and Rajasthani Royal Hindu Jatts, was very common, During the 19th Century.\nSigning their Union with India.\nMaharajah Yadavindra Singh, signed his union with India in 1948, transferring his Kingdom, to the Government of India, Patiala State was united with the Punjab State of India, in 1948.

It is made by Thales Air Defence (first called Shorts Missile Systems), in Belfast. It is also known as Starstreak High Velocity Missile, or Starstreak HVM. After it is launched, the missile travels at about Mach 3 (3 times the speed of sound). Starstreak has been in service with the British Army since 1997.\nStarstreak can be fired from a soldier's shoulder or from the Stormer armoured vehicle.\nStarstreak can travel 1,500 metres minimum and 5,5000 metres maximum.\nDevelopment.\nStarstreak began being developed in the early 1980s. This was after a study into a weapon that could add to the Rapier missile system. A General Staff Requirement (GSR 3979) was made. This GSR showed what the missile system needed to have. One of the things it needed to have was three ways to launch the missile. These were:\nIn 1984, the British Ministry of Defence gave contracts to British Aerospace (BAe) and Shorts Missile Systems to develop the missile. The BAe missile was called the Thunderbolt. Shorts won the competition. They were awarded \u00a3356 million. The weapon was developed more in November 1986. More contracts were also given out to make the missile. Starstreak was put into service officially in September 1997. Starstreak is supposed to replace the Javelin surface-to-air missile in British service.\nThe light weight launcher and the launcher which can be moved around by people have been in use since 2000.\nIn the middle of 2007, Thales UK in Northern Ireland said that it had developed Starstreak II. Starstreak II is an improved version of Starstreak. Some of these improvements were: a bigger range (7 km), a better system to find targets and the ability to find aircraft that are higher up in the air.\nIn 2011, when Thales won a contract for the Lightweight Multirole Missile, Thales said it agreed with the MOD to \"re-role previously contracted budgets to facilitate the full-scale development, series production and introduction of the LMM.\" This means that Thales were going to focus all their money on the Lightweight Multirole Missile. The contract affected by this is said to have been Starstreak.\nDescription.\nA soldier carries the Starstreak missile in a tube. This tube is sealed closed. The tube is attached to the main part of Starstreak to be fired. The gunner follows the target using Starstreak's special aiming system. When the gunner has locked on to the target, they press a button and the missile launches.\nThe missile then fires its first motor. This launches the missile from the tube. However, it stops burning before the missile leaves the tube. This is to protect the gunner. When the missile is away from the gunner, another motor fires. It makes the missile go to Mach 3.5. It stops burning when it is about four hundred meters away from the gunner. The back of the missile has the systems that guide the missile by laser beams from the launcher. The Starstreak launches many small darts at its target. Each dart has around of explosive in it.\nWhen the darts hit the target, a fuze is triggered. This fuze delays the explosion. This gives time for the darts to get inside the target before the explosives go off. The explosive is inside a shell of tungsten. This tungsten is designed to split up and make as much damage as possible inside the target.\nIn September 1999, the missile was shown attacking an armoured personnel carrier. This showed that Starstreak could also be useful in attacking targets on the ground as well as in the air. \nIn 2012, the Ministry of Defence said that it was going to put a group of Starstreaks on top of an apartment complex in London. This was because of the 2012 London Olympics. The Ministry said that the area was the only place to put an anti-aircraft battery. Some people living there were not happy. They wondered why the battery was needed."}

The other members of the Tour are Bill Engvall, Ron White, and Jeff Foxworthy. \nWhitney has made seven comedy albums. Three of these have been listed as gold albums by the RIAA. He has been in three Blue Collar Comedy Tour movies. Whitney has also been in the movies \"\", \"Delta Farce\", and \"Witless Protection\". He is well known as the voice of Mater in the \"Cars\" movies. Whitney's catchphrase \"Git-R-Done!\" is also the name of his book.\nOn January 26, 2010, the television channel History said that it wanted to make a series with Whitney. It is called \"Only in America with Larry the Cable Guy\". In this series, Whitney would explore the United States. He would learn about different ways people lived. He would also learn about their jobs and hobbies. The first episode of the series aired on February 8, 2011.\nEarly life.\nA CMT bio says that Whitney grew up on a pig farm in Pawnee City, Nebraska. He went to college at the Baptist University of America. He says his roommates from Texas and Georgia helped him create his imitation Southern accent. He left college after his third year to be a comedian.\nCareer.\nRadio career.\nWhitney started his career in radio. He was a disc jockey in Blue Springs, Missouri. He became known in the early 1990s when he made regular radio appearances by telephone on many radio programs.

The term was first used to describe smaller guns that could be taken with an army while marching. In battle the field gun could be quickly moved about the battlefield as needed. Guns installed in a fort, siege cannon and mortars were too large to be moved quickly, and would be used only in a long siege.\nNapoleon used field guns with very large wheels that allowed them to be moved quickly even during a battle. By moving the guns from place to place during the battle, formations of enemy soldiers could be broken up to be handled by the infantry wherever they were massing, dramatically increasing the overall effectiveness of the infantry.\nWorld War I.\nAs artillery developed technically, almost all guns of any size could be moved at some speed. Even the largest siege weapons could be moved by road or rail by the start of World War I. Development then turned towards smaller weapons with increased mobility. Even the World War II German super-heavy guns could be moved by rail or by caterpillar-track vehicles.\nIn British use, a \"field gun\" was anything up to 4.5\u00a0inches in calibre. Larger guns were called \"medium\" and the largest of all \"heavy\". Their largest gun (as opposed to howitzer) was the 5.5 inch (140 mm) Medium, which could fire a shell about 15,000\\16,000 yards.\nWorld War II.\nSince the start of World War II, the term field gun has been used for long-range artillery pieces that fire at a relatively low angle, as opposed to howitzers which can fire at higher angles. By the end of World War II most artillery in use were howitzers of 105\u00a0mm to 155\u00a0mm. The only common field guns still used were the British 5.5\u00a0inch and the US 155 mm Long Tom. The Long Tom had been developed from a French World War I weapon.\nThe 1960s.\nThe US Army used long-range guns again in the 1960s with the M107 175 mm gun. The M107 was used in the Vietnam War and proved effective in artillery battles with the North Vietnamese forces. This gun needed a lot of repairs, and after the barrels began to crack it was removed from service. Production of the M107 continued through the 1980s, and the gun is still used by the Israeli military forces.\nModern times.\nToday there is no longer a use for the field gun. The role for small and highly mobile artillery has been taken over by the mortar which can be carried by a soldier. These have replaced almost every artillery piece smaller than 105\u00a0mm. Gun-howitzers fill the middle ground, mostly the 155\u00a0mm NATO or 152\u00a0mm former USSR models. The need for a long-range weapon is filled by rocket artillery, or aircraft. Modern gun-artillery such as the L118 105mm light gun is used to provide fire support for infantry and armour at ranges where mortars are impractical. Soldier carried mortars lack the range or hitting power of gun-artillery. In between is the rifled towed mortar. This weapon (usually in 120mm calibre) is light enough to be towed by a Land Rover, has a range of over 6,000m and fires a bomb with the power of an artillery shell."}

It was first made for the British Army in the 1970s. It has been moved around the globe a lot since then. The United States use a changed version of the L118 called the M119A1. The proper name for it is \"Gun, 105mm, Field, L118\" but it is usually just called \"the Light Gun\".\nThe L118 can be towed by a medium-weight vehicle. It can also be moved around by a Chinook helicopter.\nHistory.\nDevelopment.\nFrom 1961 until the 1970s, the British Army used the 105\u00a0mm Pack Howitzer L5 as its light howitzer. This howitzer was used a lot. It was first designed in Italy for the Alpini. It was light enough to be lifted by Westland Wessex helicopters or towed by Land Rovers. However, it could not fire very far (had a short range), had bad sights and was not very popular.\nIn 1965 the British Army asked for a new 105\u00a0mm howitzer because the pack howitzer \"lacked range and lethality\" (had a short range and was not very lethal). \nThe new gun was soon called the 'Light Gun'. It was designed by the government Royal Armament Research and Development Establishment (RARDE). Prototypes were tested in 1968. However, it was noticed that more weight was needed for a gun to be as sturdy and strong as was needed. Several guns were redesigned because of this.\nThe first guns were made by Royal Ordnance Factory, ROF Nottingham. This has now been merged into BAE Systems Land and Armaments.\nIn British service.\nThe L118 was first used by the British Army in 1976. The new weapon was heavier than the Pack Howitzer. However, new, better helicopters like the Puma and Westland Sea King, which could carry the L118, were also beginning to be used at the same time.\nSince the end of the 1990s, the British Army has used Pinzgauer ATVs as the vehicles that move the guns around. In Arctic service (and some other places) the L118 is moved around by the H\u00e4gglunds Bv 206. It has skis put on it if it is moving on snow.\nIn 1982, the L118 was used a lot during the Falklands War. 30 guns were moved to the Falkland Islands. Since then, British forces have used the L118 in the Balkans, Sierra Leone, Iraq and Afghanistan.\nOn 30 November 2001, an L118 Light Gun became the One O'Clock Gun in Edinburgh Castle. This fires every day at one o'clock except on Sundays, Good Friday and Christmas Day.\nDesign.\nThe Light Gun took many features from the QF 25 pounder. However, the L118 is light compared to the QD 25 pounder.\nThe L118 has a special system called the Automatic Pointing System. This allows the gun to be unpacked and in action in 30 seconds. \nAmmunition.\nThe L118 fires 105\u00a0mm Fd Mk 2 ammunition. It has two proper cartridges for combat and a blank one for ceremonies etc. \nSome ammunition types in British service are:\nWP (white phosphorus) smoke shell has never been used by the UK for the L118.\nNew ammunition for the L118 is being developed. It will be even more damaging and have more range.\nDesign changes.\nDuring the early 1990s, all UK L118s had a radar and its supply of power.\nA program that started making improvements to UK guns in 2007 tried to make the gun lighter and some features better. To make the gun weigh less, some steel parts were replaced with titanium.\nDifferent types of L118.\nL119.\nThe L119 has a different barrel. It is a bit shorter. It fires different ammunition, giving the gun a range of . In British service, the L119 was only used for training. The last British L119s were retired in 2005.\nM119A1.\nThe L119 was changed more and made under a license for the United States Army."}

Racers compete, two at a time, to be the first to cross a finish line. Races are run from a standing start, in a straight line, over a measured distance, usually a \u00bc-mile straight track.\nThe race track, known as a dragstrip, usually uses an electronic timing system to decide the winner.\nBasics of drag racing.\nBefore each race, each driver is allowed to perform a burnout by spinning the driving tires. Burnouts heat the driving tires and lay rubber down at the beginning of the track to improve traction. The drivers then line up at the starting line.\nRaces are started electronically by a system known as a Christmas tree. \nBelow the staging lights are three large amber lights, a green light, and a red light. When both drivers are staged, the tree is set to start the race causing the three large amber lights to illuminate, followed by the green light. If the front tires leave the starting line before the green light illuminates, the red light for that driver's lane illuminates instead. This indicates disqualification (unless a more serious violation occurs). Once a driver commits a red-light foul (also known as \"redlighting\"), the other driver can also commit a foul start by leaving the line too early but still win, having left later. Should both drivers leave after the green light illuminates, the one leaving first is said to have a \"holeshot advantage\".\nThe first vehicle to cross the finish line wins the race. The elapsed time is a measure of performance only; it does not determine the winner. Because elapsed time does not include reaction time and each lane is timed separately, a car with a slower elapsed time can actually win if that driver's holeshot advantage exceeds the elapsed time difference. This is known as a \"holeshot win\".\nSeveral measurements are taken for each race: reaction time, elapsed time, and speed. Reaction time is the period from the lighting of the green light to the vehicle leaving the starting line. Elapsed time is the time from the vehicle leaving the starting line to crossing the finish line. Speed is measured through a speed trap covering the final to the finish line, indicating the approximate maximum speed of the vehicle during the run. \nIn the standard racing format, the losing car and driver are removed from the contest and the winner goes on to race other winners. This continues until only one is left.\nRacing organization.\nNorth America.\nThe National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) oversees most of drag racing events in North America. The next largest organization, Feld Entertainment's International Hot Rod Association (IHRA), is about one-third the size of NHRA. Nearly all drag strips are associated with one sanctioning body or the other. The NHRA is more popular with large, 1/4-mile, nationally recognized, tracks., The IHRA is a favorite of smaller 1/8-mile local tracks (and offers selected races on their national tour under the 1/8-mile format). One reason for this is the IHRA is less restrictive in its rules, such as rules on nitrous oxide (legal in Pro Modified) and oversized engines."}

Although a quarter mile (402 m) is the best known measure for a drag track, many tracks are eighth mile (201 m) tracks. The race is begun from a standing start. Three factors decide the outcome of the race: reaction time, torque, and traction.\nFeatures.\nA dragstrip is a straight racetrack, usually an eighth or a quarter of a mile long (660/1320 feet, 201/402 metres), followed by a \"shutdown area\" to allow automobiles room to stop after crossing the finish line. Common features also include a 'water box' where cars and motorcycles start their burn-outs to clean and heat up their tires to improve traction. There is a set of lights known as a 'Christmas Tree' that counts down to the start. There are also return lanes for the vehicles to return from the end of the track to the pit area."}

When it was first exhibited in 1865, the subject of the painting was controversial. \nHistory.\nManet reworked Giorgione's \"The Sleeping Venus\" (c. 1510) and Titian's \"Venus of Urbino\" (c. 1538) in creating \"Olympia\". \"Olympia\" may also take inspiration from Francisco Goya's \"La maja desnuda\" (c. 1800). This is uncertain however. Victorine Meurent was Manet's model for \"Olympia\". She posed as a bullfighter for him and also for the \"Dejeuner sur l'Herbe\" of 1862-63. Manet painted \"Olympia\" in the autumn of 1863. The work was first seen by the public at the 1865 Salon in Paris. Manet delayed showing the painting because he feared it might produce some negative reactions.\nReaction.\n\"Olympia\" did produce negative reactions: people hated it. Some people thought the painting was immoral and vulgar. Critic Paul de Saint-Victor wrote in \"La Presse\", \"People throng in front of Manet's putrid \"Olympia\" as they would in front of a body in the Morgue. This is art fallen so low that it is not even worthy of censure\". Nathaniel Harris writes, \"In reviewing \"Olympia\" Gautier wrote that the model was puny, the bed covered with cat's footprints, the general effect ugly: but then he made the point that \"we would forgive the ugliness, were it only truthful ... The least beautiful woman has bones, muscles, skin, and some sort of colour\", whereas on this woman the flesh colour was dirty and the modeling non-existent.\" Some liked the painting. \u00c9mile Zola said it was Manet's \"masterpiece\". He added, \"When other artists correct nature by painting Venus they lie. Manet asked himself why he should lie. Why not tell the truth?\" In 1866 Zola wrote with tongue-in-cheek, \"If only Manet had borrowed a powder puff ... and had lightly powdered Olympia's cheeks and her breasts she would have been a bit more presentable\".\nCommentary.\nModern art historian Nathaniel Harris writes, \"...\"Olympia\" was an erotic shock ... Manet presented a young woman with erotic modern trappings ... that served to emphasize her nakedness ... To add to the puzzlement of the ordinary man, Olympia's gaze was not in the least inviting, or provocative, or even enigmatic ... it was simply neutral ... [N]eutrality ... was one more affront to the 19th-century male, whose picture-women were supposed to yield, to comply ... Here the girl is cool and confident, and it is the setting and properties that suggest sexualityperhaps a commercialized sexuality that is none too reassuring to the male ego.\""}

It received mixed reviews. Most critics were shocked by the piece. They thought it was ugly. Degas exhibited it inside a glass case. Some thought it was a medical specimen. The head and face were thought grotesque and primitive.\nThe dancer is dressed in a cotton skirt and is wearing a hair ribbon. For a finishing touch Degas used a wig made of real hair.

Another huge gun, 42-cm Gamma-Device howitzer, was the forerunner of the Bertha.\nName.\nBertha's official name was the L/12 (the barrel was 12 calibre in length), or the M-Device.\nMany sources say that \"Bertha\" is a reference to Bertha Krupp, heiress and owner of the Krupp industrial empire. However, not all accept this. During the war, the Germans gave numerous other nicknames to the M-Device. 'Dicke', meaning fat or big in German, is apparently not a reference to the physical aspect of Ms Krupp.\nThe name \"Big Bertha\" subsequently came to be applied generally by the Allies to any very large German gun. This included the railway guns which used mounted battleship guns known as \"Langer Max\" and the ultra-long range \"Paris Gun\". Strictly speaking, however, Dicke Bertha, or Big Bertha, is \"only\" applicable to the 42-cm M-Device howitzer.\nOrigin.\nBertha was the result of lessons learned by the Germans (and Austrians) from the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05. During the war, the Japanese had dismounted a number of their coastal defence 28-cm howitzers and used them to help break their siege of the fortified Russian naval base at Port Arthur.\nThis was a complete novelty as, until that time, it had been assumed by military experts that the largest transportable siege guns were around 20-cm in calibre. Other Europeans completely failed to draw the lessons the Japanese had taught, and went forward without any huge siege guns.\nIn use.\nBig Bertha gained a strong reputation on both sides of the lines due to its early impressive successes in smashing the forts at Liege, Belgium. The German press went wild with enthusiasm and declared the Bertha a 'wonder weapon'. When used later during the German assault upon Verdun in February 1916, however, it proved less effective, as the fort, made of concrete reinforced with steel, could mostly withstand the large semi-armour-piercing shells of the Berthas. Only Fort Vaux was severely damaged during this event, destroying the water storage and leading to the surrender of the fort.\nA total of 12 complete M-Devices were built; besides the two available when the war started, ten more were built during the war. This figure does not include additional barrels.\nAs the war ground on several Berthas were destroyed when their barrels burst due to faulty ammunition. Later in the Great War, an L/30 30.5-cm barrel was developed and fitted to a number of Bertha carriages in order to provide longer-range, though not quite as heavy fire."}

Years later, Talia sees an old woman spinning flax on a spindle. She asks if she may try it. As soon as she begins to spin, a splinter of flax goes under her fingernail.

The shells are known as (mortar) bombs. They are fired at targets which are close, as mortars do not have long range. It has a short barrel which fires the mortar bomb at a low speed high into the air to reach its target. They have been used since medieval times. Mortars are made in different sizes, from large and heavy mortars to infantry mortars which can be carried by just one soldier. They are called an indirect fire weapon because the bomb drops onto the target from above, rather than being aimed straight at it. Soldiers firing a mortar do not need to be able to see their target.\nUse.\nA mortar is quite simple and easy to use. Most are muzzleloaders made up of a tube that a gunner drops a bomb into. The tube is usually set at between 45 and 90 degrees angle to the ground. The higher the angle, the shorter the range. When the bomb reaches the bottom of the tube it hits a firing pin. The mortar bomb's weight is enough to set off the firing pin which ignites the round and fires it. Some larger mortars have a firing pin that is set off by using a string instead of automatically.\nFrom the 18th to the early 20th century, very heavy siege mortars were used. These were very difficult to move around. These had up to one metre calibre. They were often made of cast iron. Smaller designs that were easier to move around were brought in during the First World War. Mortars are still used today.\nLight and medium mortars are easy to move around. They are usually used by infantry units. Mortars can fire from a trench or .\nHeavy mortars are usually between 120- and 300-mm calibre. These weapons are usually towed or put on to vehicles. They are sometimes loaded from the back (breech-loaded). They are usually used by infantry in battalions or divisions. Even mortars this large are simpler and cheaper than howitzers and field guns.\nA mortar can be moved around by one or more people (bigger mortars can usually be broken down into parts) or moved around in a vehicle. An infantry mortar can usually be set up and fired from a mortar-carrier. A mortar-carrier is a modified armoured vehicle or one built especially to be a mortar-carrier. They have a big hatch on the roof. Mortars with two barrels\u2014like the AMOS PT1\u2014are the latest kinds of heavy mortar. They are put on carriers such as armoured personnel carriers, tank chassis and patrol boats.\nLight versions of mortar are usually used by at least two men. Heavier mortars are fired by three to five men. Lighter mortars can be fired from anywhere that gives a good firing position. However, medium mortars are usually fired from prepared, well fortified positions.\nDesign.\nMost mortars used today are made up of a barrel, a plate for the barrel to stand on, and a bipod.\nMortars are mainly medium calibre weapons. However, mortars both bigger and smaller than this have been made. An example of a smaller mortar is the British 51 mm Light Mortar. The 51\u00a0mm is carried by just one soldier. It is made up of only a tube and a base plate. A bigger example is the Soviet 2S4 M1975 \"Tyulpan\" (tulip flower) 240\u00a0mm self-propelled mortar.\nMortars are not very stable if they are used on snow or soft ground. This is because the recoil pushes them into the ground. The Raschen Bag can be used to avoid this problem.\nAmmunition.\nThe ammunition fired by mortars are properly called \"bombs\". One possible reason for this is that the fins that stabilise the round when it is flying, and the shape of the round makes it look like a bomb dropped from aircraft.\nMortars can fire many different bombs. Some of these are:\nSpecial features of mortars.\nMortars are usually smaller and lighter than howitzers and field guns. When the mortar bomb is launched, it descends at a very steep angle (almost straight down).\nMortars can be very helpful if they are used in hidden places. It can be even more helpful if there are people around the battlefield that help tell the mortar where to fire (forward observers).\nHistory.\nMortars have existed for hundreds of years. They were first used in sieges. A European description of the Siege of Belgrade (1456) by Giovanni da Tagliacozzo says that the Ottoman Turks used seven mortars that fired \"stone shots one Italian mile high\". The speed of these was said to be very slow. It was also said that men could be prevented from being injured by putting observers out who warned the troops of what angle the mortars were firing at.\nEarly mortars like the Pumhart von Steyr were big and heavy. They were also difficult to move around. An early mortar that could be moved easily was invented by Baron (Siege of Grave, 1673). At the Siege of Vicksburg, General Ulysses S. Grant reported making mortars \"by taking logs of the toughest wood that could be found, boring them out for six or twelve-pound shells and binding them with strong iron bands. These answered as coehorns, and shells were successfully thrown from them into the trenches of the enemy.\"\nMortars were very useful in the muddy trenches of the Western Front. A mortar round could be aimed to fall straight into a trench because of the deep angle that the bombs fell at.\nDuring the Battle of Iwo Jima, the Imperial Japanese Army used twelve 320 mm mortars against the American forces.\nBiggest mortars.\nThe biggest mortars ever made were the French \"Monster Mortar\" (36 French inches; 975\u00a0mm; developed by Henri-Joseph Paixhans in 1832), Mallet's Mortar (36\u00a0inches; 910\u00a0mm; designed by Robert Mallet and tested by the Woolwich Arsenal, London, in 1857) and the \"Little David\" (36\u00a0inches; 914.4\u00a0mm; developed in the United States for use in World War II). All three mortars had a caliber of 36\u00a0\"inches\". However, only the \"Monster Mortar\" was used (at the Battle of Antwerp in 1832).\n\"Home-made\" mortars.\n\"Home-made\" mortars have been used by insurgent groups. They are usually used to attack well defended military bases or to scare civilians. An early example was the Davidka. This was used during the Israeli War of Independence in 1948. The Provisional Irish Republican Army used some of the best-known examples during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. The biggest types came to be known as \"barracks busters\". They were usually made of heavy steel piping put onto a steel frame.\nWell-known events using \"home-made\" mortars include the 1985 Newry mortar attack. This was when nine members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary were killed. Another well-known event is the Downing Street mortar attack in 1991. In this, the IRA mortared 10 Downing Street during a meeting. Three bombs were launched but only one exploded. It landed in the back garden of the British Prime Minister's house. It only broke the windows at the back of the house. Prime Minister John Major had to move to Admiralty House while the windows were being fixed."}

The modern term \"bombardment\" comes from this.\nBombards were usually used during sieges to hurl various things into enemy forts. Items such as stone or metal balls, burning materials and weighted cloth soaked in quicklime or Greek fire are have been written about.\nThe name comes from medieval Latin and French words from an earlier Greek word meaning the making of a humming noise.\nFamous examples.\nA famous example of a bombard is Mons Meg, a large weapon built around 1449 and used by King James II of Scotland. It was very powerful and used for bringing down castle walls. Mons Meg could fire shots and was one of the largest bombards in its time. It is now on public display at Edinburgh Castle.

The purpose is to destroy the courage of your enemies. Civilians in a besieged town would put pressure on their military leaders to surrender before the place was destroyed.

It was developed for the British Army and Royal Air Force. It began being used in 1971 and eventually replaced all other anti-aircraft weapons in the British Army. It replaced both guns for targets that were flying low down, and the English Electric Thunderbird which was used against targets that were higher up and further away. \nRapier defends against fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, unmanned aircraft and cruise missiles. It is also able to fire two missiles at once.\nRapier can be moved around by ground and air.\nHistory.\nRapier started being developed in 1961. It was done privately at the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC). Then, the missile was known as \"Sightline\". The project was to fight supersonic, low-flying aircrat. \nAt the time the British Army was going to buy the American MIM-46 Mauler for air-defense. Mauler ran into problems in 1963, so the Ministry of Defence started giving money to Sightline. Sightline was supposed to be a backup in case Mauler failed. This eventually happened, and Sightline was eventually developed as \"Rapier\". The missile was 1966 for testing. Full versions of Rapier were tested in 1968. A contract was given in 1969 for the missile to begin being made. Rapier began being used in 1971 with the British Army, and 1974 with the Royal Air Force Regiment.\nUse.\nThe first Rapier was a launcher on wheels. It had four missiles. The launcher is a large cylinder. It has two missiles on each side. \nBlindfire Radar.\nThe first Rapier was accurate and simple to use. However, it could not be used in all types of weather. To fix this, BAC started working on a different radar unit. This led to the Marconi DN 181 \"Blindfire\" radar in 1970. The first Blindfires were sold to the Iranian Army in 1973. The British Army did not buy the Blindfire system until 1979.\nTracked Rapier.\nIt soon became noticed that a version of Rapier that could be moved around was needed. BAC decided to change Rapier to fit onto the M548, a version of the M113 armored personnel carrier. In 1974, this weapon was developed as \"Tracked Rapier\". The vehicles were bought by the British Army. The first Tracked Rapiers were used with \"11 (Sphinx) Air Defence Battery\", of 22 Air Defence Regiment, Royal Artillery in 1982-83.\nMoving to firing takes only 30 seconds. This was a very big improvement to Towed Rapier. The biggest difference between towed and tracked Rapier was that the tracked Rapier launcher has eight missiles. The towed Rapier only has four.\nThere was no room for Blindfire on a single M548. Because of this, it is towed or put onto a different M548. \nAfter Tracked Rapier entered service, it was upgraded many times to follow the upgrades being made to all Rapiers. \nTracked Rapier has been replaced by Starstreak missile launchers. These are put onto the Alvis Stormer.\nFSB.\nThe \"Field Standard B\" (FSB) added some basic upgrades to Rapier. Also, the radar which searches for enemy aircrat was upgraded so that it could be easily shut down.\nLaserfire.\nBecause of all the new upgrades, the first, cheap Rapier was gone. To make Rapier cheaper, BAC began developing the \"Rapier Laserfire\" in 1982. \nTracking and firing is similar to the first Rapier. However, the Laserfire lights up the target and automatically tracks it with a powerful YAG:Nd laser. \nMissile upgrades.\nIn 1988, a better missile started being tested. This missile exploded before it hit the target. This allowed Rapier to hit smaller, faster targets.\nIn 1992 the Army decided to upgrade Rapier to higher-quality versions.\nThe missile has two versions, the Mk. 2A to shoot down aircraft, and the Mk. 2B, which can be used against light tanks and other armoured vehicles.\nHistory in combat.\nIn April 1982, the first Rapier was used during the Falklands War. Early reports about Rapier were good. They said Rapier got 14 kills and probably killed another 6 more. However, later reports said that around four enemy aircraft were shot down by Rapier. Only one Argentine aircraft, a Dagger A, was definitely a Rapier kill. The pilot was killed. \n\"Within the total only five Argentine aircraft might have been shot down by Rapier, and, as originally noted by Ethell and Price, only one of these was certain, with two probables and two possibles. Similar discrepancies arose over other weapons systems, notably Blowpipe (one confirmed kill as against nine confirmed and two probables in the White Paper) and Sea Cat (zero to one against eight confirmed and two probables in the White Paper). [\u2026] This confirmation that MoD had exaggerated, however unwittingly, the capabilities of Rapier was deemed to be political dynamite. It was observed that if this assessment became publicly known it 'could have a serious adverse effects on sales' prospects for Rapier, which is the staple revenue-earner for BAe's Dynamic Group.\"\nThe main problems were that Rapier could not fire very far, and that there was no proximity fuse. This meant that the gunner had to hit the aircrat with the missile directly. There were also problems with Rapier's IFF system.\nPossible replacement.\nIt has been announced the UK Ministry of Defence was giving money to a company to find a replacement for Rapier. The Common Anti-Air Modular Missile (CAMM) would have some components the same as the ASRAAM missile which is in service with the RAF.\nMuseums.\nAn example of Rapier can be seen in a hangar in IWM Duxford."}

Many countries have built railway guns, but the best known were made by Krupp and used by Germany in World War I and World War II. Smaller guns were often part of an armoured train.\nRailway guns are no longer used. Their large size and limited movement made them easy targets. They have been replaced by aircraft, rockets, and missiles.\nHistory.\nThe idea of railway guns was first suggested in the 1860s by a Mr Anderson. He published a pamphlet in the United Kingdom titled \"National Defence\" in which he proposed a plan of ironclad railway carriages. A Russian, Lebedew, claimed to have first invented the idea in 1860 when he is reported to have mounted a mortar on a railway car.\nThe first railway gun used in battle was a banded 32-pounder Brooke naval rifle. In the American Civil War it was mounted on a flat rail car and protected with sheets of iron. On 29 June 1862, Robert E. Lee had the gun pushed by a locomotive over the Richmond and York River line (later part of the Southern Railway) and used at the Battle of Savage's Station. There is also a photo of a Union 13-inch siege mortar mounted on a rail car during the Siege of Petersburg, Virginia. It was nicknamed the \"Dictator\" or the \"Petersburg Express\".\nRailway guns were used by France during the Siege of Paris in 1870, and by the British during the Siege of Ladysmith during the Second Boer War.\nWorld War I.\nGermany already had a few Big Bertha guns at the start of the First World War but the French had a shortage of heavy field artillery. Large coastal defense guns and naval guns were moved to the front. These were usually unsuitable for field use and needed some kind of mounting. The railway gun was an obvious solution. By 1916, both sides were using railway guns.\nBaldwin Locomotive Works made five 14\"/50 caliber railway guns on trains for the United States Navy during April and May 1918. Each train carried a Mk 4 14\"/50 caliber gun. These were a naval rifle used on New Mexico and Tennessee class battleships, mounted on a rail carriage with four 6-wheel bogies. One of these guns is on display outside the museum at the Washington Navy Yard.\nWorld War II.\nThe Second World War saw the final use of railway guns. The Germans used the massive Schwerer Gustav gun, the largest artillery piece to be used in battle. The rise of the aeroplane effectively ended the use of the railway guns. Like battleships, they were big, expensive, and easily destroyed from the air."}

It is now at Edinburgh Castle, Scotland. In contrast to modern shells, which are explosive, these older cannons fired solid balls. Mons Meg fired balls of iron.\nIt seems, from the accounts of Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, that it was made to his order around 1449 and sent as a gift eight years later to King James II of Scotland, with other artillery supplies. Mons Meg weighs , is in length, and has a calibre of . The final cost of the gun was \u00a31,536. 2s.\nHistory.\nManufacture.\nThe bombard was made from long bars of iron, hooped with rings and fused into one mass. The Duke's artillery maker constructed it, and it was tested at Mons, Wallonia, in June 1449. The Duke did not take delivery until 1453. The Duke decided to help the Scots against the English, and sent it to James II. James imported a lot of artillery from continental Europe during his reign. He used it against his enemies in Scotland, such as the Earl of Douglas. James died as a result of an exploding cannon used in the siege of Roxburgh Castle in 1460.\nAnother story suggests Mons Meg was made in order to help James II in the 1452 siege of Threave Castle in Kirkcudbright, when the Clan MacLellan used it to batter the castle. This version has little support.\nIn action.\nThe calibre cannon accepted balls that weighed about . It could only be fired 8-10 times a day due to the tremendous heat generated by the huge powder charge. In early years the gun, like the other royal cannon, was painted with red-lead to keep it from rusting. This cost 30 shillings in June 1539. \nFrom the 1540s Meg was retired from active service and was fired only on ceremonial occasions from Edinburgh Castle, from where shot could be found up to two miles away. When Mons was fired on 3 July 1558, workmen were paid to find and retrieve the shot from Wardie Mure, near the River Forth. The salute marked the marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots to the French Dauphin.\nThe gun was fired in 1680 to celebrate the arrival of James, Duke of Albany and York, later King James II of England and VII of Scotland. The barrel burst. An English cannoneer had loaded the charge and many Scots believed that the damage was done on purpose, since the English had no cannon as big as this. The incident was also seen as a bad omen for the future King.\nThe cannon was left outside Foog's Gate at Edinburgh Castle. It was next taken, with other disused ordnance, to the Tower of London in 1754, but was returned to the Castle in 1829, after a campaign by the author Sir Walter Scott. It was restored, and now sits outside St. Margaret's Chapel."}

Their purpose was to destroy heavy fortifications, especially in the French Maginot Line. The guns weighed nearly 1,350 tonnes, and could fire shells weighing seven tonnes to a range of .\nAlthough they were intended for World War II, they were not ready for action when the Wehrmacht outflanked the Maginot line by sweeping through the low country (Belgium) to start the Battle of France. However, they were ready in Autumn 1941, after the Wehrmacht invaded the Soviet Union (Operation Barbarossa). Gustav was used at the siege of Sevastopol in the summer of 1942. By the end of the siege on 4 July the city of Sevastopol lay in ruins, and 30,000 tons of artillery ammunition had been fired. Gustav had fired 48 rounds and worn out its original barrel, which had already fired around 250 rounds during testing and development. The gun was fitted with the spare barrel and the original was sent back to Krupp's factory in Essen for relining.\nBoth Gustav and Dora were moved to Leningrad, and may have been intended for Warsaw. Gustav was eventually captured by US troops and cut up, whilst Dora was destroyed near the end of the war to avoid capture by the Red Army.\nThe Schwerer Gustav was the largest calibre rifled weapon in the history of artillery to see actual combat. It fired the heaviest shells of any artillery piece. A few other huge guns were never fired in anger: the French \"Monster Mortar\" (36 French inches; 975mm), the British Mallet's Mortar (36 inch; 914 mm) and the American Little David mortar (36 inch; 910 mm)."}

Negroid people are perceived as Shemetic as opposed to the Hamitic Ethiopian, Sudanese, and some other West African ethnic groups as attested by the genealogy of ancient ethnic lineages. For example, a person who has ancestry from Rome would be considered closer to a Hamite than a person whose ancestry is in Africa. Ironically, the Hamites include some of the darkest sub-Saharan African groups like the Nilotes that were considered closest to Europeans as opposed to the Chadic sub saharan Africans who share a common RB1 lineage. \nThis theory also included giving classes to those members of the negroid races of Africa upon colonization.

The designs usually have short barrels which fire a low speed shell. They are lightly built so they are easy to moved around on the battlefield. Very few infantry guns are still used by infantry units. They have been replaced by grenade launchers, light anti-tank weapons and heavier wire-guided missiles. Pack guns are similar to an infantry gun, but mean those guns that are meant to be taken apart for movement. Mountain guns are infantry guns designed for use during mountain combat. Airborne guns are those designed for use by paratroopers. They are easy to move and lighter weight when compared to field guns.\nHistory.\nInfantry guns were the first type of artillery used by armed forces, first in China, and later brought to Europe by the Mongol invasion. At first they were simple cast barrels called \"pots de fer\" in French, or \"vasi\" in Italian. These weapons were small, immobile, and fired large bolts or quarrels. As the barrels became longer, a way had to be found to move the guns. This led to two different solutions. One was the very light hand-gun, which became the arquebus. The other was to place the gun on wheeled carriages, such as the 2-pounder Culvern moyane, the 1-pounder Falcon, and the 3/4-pounder Falconet. These lighter Renaissance pieces led to the development of the 3-pounder and 4-pounder regimental guns of the 17th century, notably in the army of Gustavus Adolphus. The light field guns of the 17th century, known as a \"drake\" in England, came in almost 100 different calibres. Each had its own name, some of which were:\nThe saker and falcon had ranges of 360 and 320 yards if fired straight at the target, and 2,170 and 1,920 yards if fired in an upward arc.\nAlthough oxen were used to pull the heavier field and siege guns, some on wagons rather than limbers, they were too slow to keep up with the infantr. Horses were used to pull the lighter pieces, leading to the development of the artillery carriage and horse team that survived until the late 19th century."}

The music was written by Gaetano Donizetti. Felice Romani wrote the libretto, after Eug\u00e8ne Scribe's libretto for Daniel Auber's \"Le philtre\" (1831).\nThe opera was first performed at the Teatro della Canobbiana, Milan, Italy on May 12, 1832. \"L'elisir d'amore\" is number 12 on the Operabase list of the most performed operas in the world. The aria \"Una furtiva lagrima\" () is very famous. In 1840, Richard Wagner arranged the opera for piano. W. S. Gilbert wrote a parody of the opera called \"Dulcamara, or the Little Duck and the Great Quack\" in 1866.\nPlot.\nAct 1.\nNemorino, a poor peasant, is in love with Adina, a beautiful landowner. She torments him with her seeming indifference. When Nemorino hears Adina reading to her workers the story of Tristan and Isolde, he considers using a magic potion to gain Adina's love. He is afraid she loves Sergeant Belcore. The Sergeant appears with his regiment. He proposes marriage to Adina. The traveling quack salesman, Dulcamara arrives, selling his bottled cure-all to the townspeople. Nemorino asks Dulcamara if he has anything like Isolde's love potion. Dulcamara says he does. He sells it to Nemorino at a price matching the contents of Nemorino's pockets. The bottle contains only wine. In order to make a timely escape, Dulcamara tells Nemorino the potion will not take effect until the next day. Nemorino drinks it, feeling its effects immediately.\nEmboldened by the 'elixir' Nemorino encounters Adina. She teases him mercilessly, the audience senses that the attraction might be mutual, were it not for the marriage proposal of the Sergeant Belcore. In fact, their wedding date has been set for six days hence. Nemorino's confidence that tomorrow he will win Adina by virtue of the elixir, causes him to act indifferently toward her. This upsets Adina, but she attempts to hide her feelings. Instead, she ups the ante as well by agreeing to Sergeant Belcore's alternate suggestion: that they marry immediately as he has just received orders that the regiment must ship off the next morning. Both Adina and the Sergeant gauge Nemorino's reaction to this news, the Sergeant with resentment, Adina with despair. Nemorino panics, and cries out for Doctor Dulcamara to come to his aid.\nAct 2.\nAdina's outdoor wedding party is in full swing. Dr. Dulcamara is there, and performs a song with Adina to entertain the guests. The notary arrives to make the marriage official. Adina is sad to see that Nemorino has not appeared. Everyone goes inside to sign the wedding contract. But Dulcamara stays outside, helping himself to food and drink. Nemorino appears, having seen the notary, realizes that he has lost Adina. He sees the Doctor and frantically begs him for more elixir, of the type that will work immediately. But because Nemorino has no money, the Doctor refuses, disappearing inside. The Sergeant emerges, alone, wondering aloud why Adina has suddenly put off the wedding and the signing of the contract. Nemorino spots his rival, but is powerless to do anything. The Sergeant asks about Nemorino's dejection. When Nemorino says he has no money Belcore immediately suggests that if he joins the army he'll be paid immediately. He produces a contract, which Nemorino signs (with an X) in return for the cash Belcore gives him on the spot. Nemorino privately vows to fly to Dulcamara for more potion, while Belcore muses that he has easily dispatched of his rival by sending him off to war.\nLater that evening the women of the village are gossiping that Nemorino is unaware that he has just inherited a large fortune from his deceased uncle. They spot Nemorino, who has clearly spent his military signing bonus, and has bought and consumed a large amount of 'elixir' (wine again) from Dr. Dulcamara. The women approach Nemorino with overly friendly greetings, the likes of which he has never seen. This is proof to Nemorino that this dose of the elixir has worked. Adina sees Nemorino in a jolly mood and, encountering Dr. Dulcamara, wonders what has gotten into him. Dulcamara, unaware that Adina is the object of Nemorino's affection, tells her the story of the smitten bumpkin who spent his last penny on the elixir, and even signed his life away, joining the army for money to get more, so desperate was he to win the love of some unnamed cruel beauty. Adina immediately realizes Nemorino's sincerity, and regrets teasing him. She falls for Nemorino, basking in the sincerity of his love. Dulcamara interprets this behavior as some sort of condition requiring a cure by one of his potions.\nThey depart. Nemorino appears alone, pensive, reflecting on a tear he saw in Adina's eye when he was ignoring her earlier. Based on that tear alone, he is sincerely convinced that Adina loves him. She enters, asking him why he has chosen to join the army and leave the town. When Nemorino says he's seeking a better life, Adina responds by telling him he is loved, and that she has purchased his military contract from Sergeant Belcore. She offers the cancelled contract to Nemorino, asking him to take it. He is free now. She says, however, that if he stays, he will no longer be sad. As he takes the contract Adina turns to leave. Nemorino believes she is abandoning him and flies in to a desperate fit, vowing that if he is not loved, if the elixir has not worked, and the Doctor has fooled him, then he might as well go off and die a soldier. Adina stops him and confesses that she loves him. Nemorino is ecstatic. Adina begs him to forgive her for teasing him. He does so with a kiss. The sergeant returns, seeing the two in an embrace. Adina explains that she loves Nemorino. The Sergeant takes the news in stride, noting that there are plenty of other women in the world. Dulcamara, his bags packed, pops out of a doorway, adding that he will happily provide elixir for the Sergeant's next conquest. A crowd has gathered by now, all agreeing that the elixir has done its job as they bid a fond farewell to the doctor."}

The nebula is south of Orion's Belt in the constellation of Orion.\nM42 is 1,344 \u00b1 20 light years away from us. It is the closest region of massive star formation to Earth. Big as it is, the Orion nebula is just part of an even larger star-forming area known as the Orion complex.\nStellar nursery.\nThe nebula is a huge stellar nursery. 700 stars are in the process of forming there. At its heart is a very young open cluster, known as the Trapezium because of the pattern formed by its main stars. \nRecent observations with the Hubble Space Telescope have shown protoplanetary disks inside the Orion Nebula. This is a major discovery. They are called \"proplyds\" for short. There are more than 150 of these in the nebula. They are thought to be to be systems in the earliest stages of planetary system formation. The sheer numbers have been used as evidence that the formation of star systems is fairly common in the universe.\nStars form when clumps of hydrogen and other gases in an H II region contract under their own gravity. As the gas collapses, the central clump grows stronger and the gas heats to extreme temperatures by converting gravitational potential energy to thermal energy. If the temperature gets high enough, nuclear fusion will start, and form a protostar. The protostar is 'born' when it begins to emit enough energy to balance out its gravity and halt gravitational collapse."}

The French libretto was written by Jules-Henri Vernoy de Saint-Georges and Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Bayard. The music was composed by Gaetano Donizetti. The opera is famous for the tenor aria \"Ah! mes amis, quel jour de f\u00eate!\" It features nine high Cs. The opera was first performed on 11 February 1840 by the Paris Op\u00e9ra-Comique at the Salle de la Bourse. It was performed at the Metropolitan Opera in 1902/03. The role of Marie was a favorite with Jenny Lind.\nStory.\nAct 1.\nThe Marquise of Berkenfeld and her butler, Hortensius, are on their way to Austria. They pause in their journey because a skirmish has broken out. The Marquise learns that the French troops have retreated. She comments on the rude manners of the French people (\"Pour une femme de mon nom\"). The sergeant of the 21st regiment, Sulpice, assures everyone that his men will restore peace and order. He is joined by Marie, the \"daughter\" of the regiment. She is an orphan and was adopted by the soldiers. Sulpice questions her about a young man she has been seen with. She explains that he is Tonio, a Tyrolean who once saved her life. Troops of the 21st arrive with a prisoner. It is Tonio. He has been looking for Marie. She steps in to save him. He toasts his new friends, and Marie sings the regimental song (\"\"Chacun le sait\"). Tonio is ordered to follow the soldiers. He escapes and returns to declare his love to Marie. Sulpice surprises them. Marie must admit to Tonio that she can marry only a soldier of the 21st.\nThe Marquise asks Sulpice for an escort to her castle. When Sulpice hears the name Berkenfeld, he remembers a letter he found near the young Marie on the battlefield. The Marquise soon admits that she knew the girl's father. She says that Marie is the long-lost daughter of her sister. The child had been left in the care of the Marquise, but was lost. She is shocked by the girl's rough manners. She decides to take her niece to her castle and give her a proper education. Tonio has enlisted so that he can marry Marie (\"Ah, mes amis\"). But Marie has to leave both her regiment and the man she loves (\"Il faut partir\").\nAct 2.\nThe Marquise has arranged a marriage between Marie and the Duke of Krakenthorp. At the Marquise's castle, Sulpice is recovering from an injury. He is supposed to be helping the Marquise with her plans. The Marquise gives Marie a singing lesson. Marie slips in phrases of the regimental song with Sulpice's encouragemment. The Marquise loses her temper (Trio: \"Le jour naissait dans la bocage\").\nMarie is left alone. She thinks money and position are meaningless (\"Par le rang et l'opulence\"). She hears soldiers marching in the distance. She is delighted when the whole regiment files into the room. She leads them in singing a patriotic tribute (\"Salut \u00e0 la France\"). Marie is reunited with Tonio. Tonio asks for Marie's hand in marriage. The Marquise is unmoved by the young man's declaration that Marie is his whole life (\"Pour me rapprocher de Marie\"\"). She says her niece is engaged to another man. She dismisses Tonio. The Marquise and Sulpice are left alon. She confesses the truth: Marie is her illegitimate daughter. She abandoned Marie long ago, fearing social disgrace.\nHortensius announces the arrival of the wedding party. It is led by the groom's mother, the Duchess of Krakenthorp. Marie refuses to leave her room. Sulpice tells her that the Marquise is her mother. The surprised girl says she cannot go against her mother's wishes. She agrees to marry a man that she does not love. She is about to sign the marriage contract when the soldiers of the 21st, led by Tonio, storm in to rescue their \"daughter\". The guests are horrified to learn that Marie was a canteen girl. They change their opinion when she tells them that she can never repay the debt she owes the soldiers. The Marquise is so moved by her daughter's goodness of heart that she gives her permission to marry Tonio. Everyone joins in a final \"Salut \u00e0 la France\"."}

No laws protect LGBT people from discrimination (not being treated equally because they are LGBT) or harassment. However, the Basic Law of the Palestinian Constitution does give all Palestinians certain freedoms. For example, it covers freedom of belief, freedom of expression, and freedom of bodily integrity. It also gives Palestinians freedom from discrimination \"because of race, sex, color, religion, political views, or disability\". The Basic Law also protects people's human rights. In other countries, people have used these types of laws and freedoms to argue that LGBT rights should exist. However, hundreds of gay Palestinians have left and moved to Israel because they did not feel welcome or safe in Palestinian-ruled areas.\nHomosexuality is still illegal in parts of Palestine. In 1951, same-sex acts were decriminalized in the West Bank, which was ruled by Jordan. Same-sex acts are still decriminalized there today. On the other hand, in the Gaza Strip, same-sex acts between men were made illegal in 1936, by the British Mandate Criminal Code Ordinance, No. 74. This law is still in place, so same-sex acts between men are still illegal there. Lesbian women are not covered by this law. \nIn both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian Authority has not made laws either for or against homosexuality. Instead, the President of the Palestinian Authority decided to keep the laws that were already in place in the Gaza Strip and West Bank. On May 20, 1994, he ruled that laws that took effect before June 5, 1967 in these areas would not be changed. The laws are also more complicated because the Palestinian territories have been ruled by many different foreign powers, like the Ottoman Empire, the British Empire, Jordan, Egypt, and Israel. Each of these foreign powers created their own laws for the Palestinian territories. Because of the many different laws that have been in place there, the legal situation in the territories is confusing. Sometimes, the criminal law about homosexuality is applied (or used) in the territories. At other times, the laws are not applied. It can be different in the different territories. "}

These wars involved huge numbers of soldiers because the French used modern mass conscription. \nFrance was at war with Great Britain constantly from 1793 until 1802, and other countries joined Britain in the wars of First Coalition (1792 to 1797) and Second (1798 to 1801). Hostilities ceased with the Treaty of Amiens 1802, though conflicts soon flared up again with the Napoleonic War."}

He helped save about 100,000 Hungarian Jews from being killed by the Nazis in 1944, during the Holocaust in World War II. He often risked his life, and later won worldwide admiration for his heroic eforts.\nBackground.\nWallenberg was born in Kapptsta, near Stockholm. He was a member of a prominent family of bankers and industrialists. He visited Hungary on business in the early 1940s, during World War II. Wallenberg became increasingly disturbed by the plans of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler to kill all the Jews of Europe. In 1944, the World Jewish Congress and the American War Refugee Board asked Wallennberg to help and he agreed to go to Hungary to save the remaining Jews there.\nRescue of Jews.\nThe Swedish government sent Wallenberg to serve as a diplomat in Budapest, Hungary's capital. He gave Swedish passports to about 20,000 Jews, allowing them to ask for the protection of the neutral Swedish government. He also protected Jews in houses he bought or rented with his own money or money from the groups that had sent him. Wallenberg, a Lutheran, was assisted by Roman Catholic and other non-Jewish leaders.\nAdolf Eichmann, a Nazi official who directed the sending of Jews to concentration camps, ordered Wallenberg to stop interfering with German plans for the Jews. Wallenberg said no. Eichmann tried to have Wallenberg killed, but he was not killed. In the final days before the liberation of Budapest by Soviet soldiers, Wallenberg persuaded the Nazis to stop a plan to kill 70,000 Jews who were forced to live in a ghetto (separated part) of the city.\nArrest and death.\nIn January 1945, Soviet forces arrested Wallenberg. They apparently believed he was an American spy. In 1957, the Soviet government reported that Wallenberg had died of a heart attack in prison in 1947. But several people said that they saw him alive in Soviet prisons and hospitals after 1947.\nIn 1981, the United States Congress made Wallenberg an honorary U.S. citizen."}

He had a short life and did not write down very much about his discoveries, but the things he discovered were all extremely important and had a revolutionary effect on mathematics. He contributed to many fields of mathematics, such as analysis, geometry, mathematical physics and number theory. Today, many people see him as a great mathematician. He was among the first mathematicians that worked on complex analysis. The kind of geometry he started (which is called Riemannian geometry today) is one of the bases of the theory of relativity, developed by Albert Einstein.\nLife.\nChildhood.\nBernhard Riemann was the second child in a family of six children. His father was a Lutheran pastor. The family was very poor and did not have much to eat. Several of the children died, and Bernhard always had poor health. His parents were loving, but he was a very shy boy. Later in life he had to try very hard to be brave enough to speak in public. His father was one of his first teachers. The young boy was very keen to learn about everything. When he was ten he had a specialist maths teacher, but he was often better at maths than his teacher. When he was 14, he went to Hanover where he lived with his grandmother so that he could go to a Gymnasium school. His father wanted him to be a priest, but Bernhard was much too shy to preach to people. In the end he let him study maths.\nThere is a well-known story from Riemann\u2019s school days. The school director excused him from maths lessons because the lessons were much too easy for him. Bernhard asked the director whether he could borrow a difficult maths book to read, so the director lent him \"Th\u00e9orie des Nombres\" (Theory of Numbers) by . This was a huge book with maths that was so difficult that only a few people in the world would have understood it all. The director was disappointed when the boy brought the book back after only six days. He asked him how far he had got. The boy said he had read the whole book. This was true, and he had understood and remembered it all. Later in life, when Riemann was 33, he developed the famous Riemann hypothesis. This was an article that was only 8 pages long, but he developed his idea from what Legendre had written. Mathematicians ever since have struggled to try to prove what Riemann wrote.\nUniversity life.\nRiemann studied at the universities of G\u00f6ttingen and Berlin. During his student days he was developing ideas that were to become very important to modern mathematical physics. In 1851 he got his doctorate for a dissertation called \"Foundations for a General Theory of Functions of a Complex Variable\". This was to become very useful in topology which deals with position and place. When he became lecturer at G\u00f6ttingen he had to offer three lectures from which the professors would choose one. One of the professors was Carl Friedrich Gauss who was one of the greatest mathematicians who ever lived. Gauss asked him to talk about \"On the Hypotheses that form the foundations of Geometry\". Gauss himself had worked on this subject. Riemann was terribly nervous about lecturing on this subject in front of the famous Gauss. When he gave the lecture, it became one of the most famous events in the history of mathematics. Gauss did not often give praise to younger mathematicians, but he was very enthusiastic. Riemann\u2019s ideas made it possible for Einstein to develop his theory of relativity more than half a century later.\nAt first Riemann had no salary. He depended on fees from the students. After four years he was given a small salary. In 1857 he became associate professor and in 1859 full professor, succeeding Dirichlet who had succeeded Gauss four years earlier. Riemann suffered from bad health. Overwork often resulted in periods of depression. There were many deaths in his family, but he worked very hard and made several discoveries that are now named after him. He was becoming very famous. On a visit to Berlin Borchardt, Kummer, Kronecker and Weierstra\u00df - all very famous mathematicians - showered him with praise. He went to Paris where he met who greatly admired him. He was honoured by the Royal Society of London and the French Academy of Sciences.\nHe married and for a short time he was happy. Then he became ill. He suffered from pleurisy and made several visits to Italy for his health. He died in Selasca on Lago Maggiore aged 39."}

Pinafore, or The Lass That Loved a Sailor is a two-act operetta by Gilbert and Sullivan. It is the fourth of their fourteen operettas. It premiered on 25 May 1878 at the Opera Comique in London, England. It had 571 performances. The operetta became an international success, and had great influence on the development of musical theatre in Britain and America.\nStory.\nAct I.\nThe H.M.S. \"Pinafore\" lies at anchor off Portsmouth. Little Buttercup comes on board to sell things to the sailors. She says that she has a secret. Ralph Rackstraw says he loves Josephine. The Captain worries that his daughter will decline Sir Joseph's marriage proposal. She tells her father that she loves a sailor in his crew, but assures him that she will never reveal her love to him.\nSir Joseph comes on board with his sisters, cousins, and aunts. He says he rose from humble beginnings to be \"the ruler of the Queen's Navee\", although he has no qualifications. He then delivers a lesson in etiquette, telling the Captain that he must always say \"if you please\" after giving an order for \"A British sailor is any man's equal\". He has composed a song to illustrate that point. \nRalph is delighted with Sir Joseph's views on equality. He decides to declare his love to Josephine. Dick Deadeye points out that \"when people have to obey other people's orders, equality's out of the question\". Ralph is left alone on deck. Josephine enters, and Ralph confesses his love. She rejects his love and leaves. Ralph decides on suicide. He puts a pistol to his head. Josephine returns to say she loves him. They make plans to leave that night to marry. Dick Deadeye warns them against such a scheme. The joyous ship's company ignores him.\nAct 2.\nLater that night, Captain Corcoran tells Buttercup that he would have returned her love long ago if they were not so far apart in social class. She warns him that a change is in store for him. Sir Joseph complains that Josephine has not yet agreed to marry him. The Captain thinks she is probably dazzled by his \"exalted rank\". He suggests that Sir Joseph persuade her that \"love levels all ranks\". If he does so, Josephine will surely accept his proposal. Sir Joseph makes his argument to Josephine, but it only serves to strengthen her determination to marry Ralph. \nDick Deadeye tells the Captain of the lovers' plans to elope. The Captain confronts Ralph and Josephine as they try to leave the ship. The pair declare their love. The furious Captain swears. Sir Joseph has heard this oath and is shocked. He orders the Captain confined to his cabin. Sir Joseph asks what provoked the Captain's outburst. Ralph replies that it was his declaration of love for Josephine. Sir Joseph is furious. He has Ralph taken to the ship's dungeon. \nLittle Buttercup now reveals her secret. Many years ago, she had cared for two babies. One baby was of low birth, but the other was a wellborn babe. She \"mixed those children up\"\u00a0 the wellborn babe is Ralph and the Captain is the babe of low condition. Sir Joseph realises that Ralph should have been the Captain, and the Captain should have been Ralph. He calls for both, and they enter wearing one another's uniforms. Sir Joseph's marriage with Josephine is now out of the question. He hands her to Ralph. Corcoran will marry Buttercup. Sir Joseph will marry Hebe. There is general rejoicing.\nImpact.\n\"Pinafore\" had great influence on the development of musical theatre. According to theatre historian John Kenrick, \"Pinafore\" was an international sensation and reshaped the commercial theater in both England and the United States. Historian John Bush Jones writes that \"Pinafore\" and the other [Gilbert and Sullivan] operas show that musical theatre can provide amusement yet address current issues and events. He writes that \"Pinafore\" was the first musical to bring together story, song words, and music into a balanced whole. He adds that the show's popularity produced an American audience for musical theatre, and that the show has served as a model of the musical ever since."}

{"id": "328374", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=328374", "title": "Tauriel", "text": "Tauriel is a fictional character from Peter Jackson's three-part feature movie adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's \"The Hobbit\". The character does not appear in the original book by writer J.R.R. Tolkien, but was created by Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh for two of the movies. Tauriel is a Woodland Elf, and is the leader of the Elven guard. Her name means \"forest daughter\" in the Elvish language. She is played by actress Evangeline Lilly, who appeared as Kate Austen on the TV show \"Lost\".\nAppearances.\nTauriel first appears in the second part of the trilogy, \"The Desolation of Smaug\", which was released December 13, 2013. Before it was decided to have three films instead of two, Tauriel was described as having a more important role in what was then the final film, \" Battle of the Five Armies\", which was originally going to be released in 2013. However, when the filmmakers decided to make the series into a trilogy, that part of the story became the third part of the trilogy, which would be released in December 2014.\nIn \"The Desolation of Smaug\", the hobbit Bilbo Baggins, and thirteen dwarves, are traveling to Lonely Mountain, and pass through the black forest of Mirkwood, where they are captured by giant spiders. The spiders are then attacked by the Wood Elves, led by Legolas and Tauriel. Tauriel saves K\u00edli by killing a spider that was attacking him, but the Elves take the dwarves as prisoners for trespassing on their land. During the dwarves' imprisonment, Tauriel forms a bond with K\u00edli. It is later mentioned that Tauriel is a talented warrior and for this reason, was made leader of the Mirkwood border guards. Legolas, the son of Mirkwood's Elven king Thranduil, is shown to be attracted to her, and she used to be attracted to him too, but because she is a lowly Silvan Elf, she does not believe herself worthy of him, and similarly, Thranduil does not consider her to be a proper match for his son.\nAs the dwarves escape with Bilbo's help, the Elves' home is attacked by orcs. Tauriel again uses her skills to save K\u00edli, but K\u00edli is struck in the leg with an orc's arrow. This arrow is poisoned, and the wound it created will slowly kill K\u00edli. Thranduil learns that an evil entity has returned and is amassing great power in the south, and seals off his kingdom, but before he does this, Tauriel goes after the dwarves by herself. Legolas follows, and tries to convince her to return, but when she refuses, saying that the Elves are part of Middle Earth and that they must fight in the upcoming war, Legolas joins her pursuit.\nAfter getting weapons and supplies at Laketown, the dwarves leave for the Lonely Mountain, but leave K\u00edli behind because of his injury, and Fili, Bofur and Oin stay behind to be with him. By the time Tauriel and Legolas reach Laketown, the dwarves are being attacked by orcs. They defeat the invaders, and Tauriel uses her knowledge of herbs to heal K\u00edli's wound, saving his life once again, after which they admit that they have developed a bond with one another.\nCreation and casting.\nIn 1937 J. R. R. Tolkien published the fantasy novel \"The Hobbit\", which is about a group of 15 people: a Hobbit named Bilbo Baggins, a wizard named Gandalf and thirteen dwarves. This group goes searching for a treasure guarded by the dragon, Smaug. During the story, the group are captured by the Silvan Elves. During the Battle of Five Armies at the end of the story, the group of 15 travelers join with the Elves to fight an army of goblins and wargs.\nAlthough Tauriel does not appear in this story, she was created by Peter Jackson and his wife and producing partner Fran Walsh for the movie. They did this in order to expand the world of the elves of Mirkwood Forest, and to bring another female to the cast, since it is mostly males. The character is a Silvan Elf, which means she is of a much lower place in Elf society than the elves that had been seen in \"The Lord of the Rings\" film series, like Arwen, Galadriel, Elrond, and Legolas. A Woodland Elf, her name has been translated as \"Daughter of Mirkwood\".\nIn June 2011 Peter Jackson announced that actress Evangeline Lilly, who played Kate Austen in the ABC drama \"Lost\", was cast in the role. Lilly, had been a fan of Tolkien's books since she was 13, but was nervous about how Tolkien fans would react to a character that did not appear in Tolkien's books. She stated that creating the character for the adaptation was the right thing to do, saying, \"I believe she is authentic, because Tolkien refers to The Woodland Elves, he just doesn't talk about who they are specifically\u2026 [Peter and Fran] know that world so well. They\u2019re not going to create a character that is not true to Tolkien's world.\" Despite this, some fans were unhappy with the creation of her character after the first trailer for the film was released on June 12, 2013. \nAs head of the Elven guard, Lilly says that Tauriel is \"slightly reckless and totally ruthless and doesn't hesitate to kill.\" Lilly also says Tauriel is a nonconformist (someone who refuses to follow established customs), and that because of her relative youth among Elves, she can be reckless in the decisions she makes, tending to rebel against the established social order of the Elves. Lilly explains, \"She's only 600 years old, she's just a baby. So she's a bit more impulsive, and she's a bit more immature. I think she's more easily romanticized by a lot of things.\" However, she also has a \"softer side\", and her character's story has her falling in love with another character. Although she and Legolas are close, childhood friends, the romance is not with him. According to Lilly, Legolas' father, the Elven king Thranduil, is fond of Tauriel, and \"sees something very special in her\". Lilly told the filmmakers that she would only play the character if they promised that her character would not be part of a love triangle. However, when she was called back into production to shoot new scenes after it was decided to split the story into three films instead of two, she was told that a love triangle would indeed be added to the story.\nTo look like Tauriel in the films, she wore a red wig with knee-length hair, fake ears that are three times larger than the ones Orlando Bloom wore as Legolas (though Lilly felt that the long hair would take attention away from the ears). Instead of wearing the complex formal gowns that female Elf noblewomen were seen wearing in previous films, Tauriel wears Elven military garb, which is better-suited to her job as a border guard and soldier. The is an expert in a variety of weapons, but she usually uses a bow and two daggers, the same weapons Legolas uses. Lilly had a stunt coach help her film the action scenes. Although Lilly asked to do the character's wirework herself, because she had experience doing her own stunts on \"Lost\", that work was performed by a stunt double. Lilly also had a language coach teacher her how to speak the Elvish language. \nFilming of Tauriel's scenes began in September 2011 in New Zealand, and was expected to last a year. Lilly said that she enjoyed the calm atmosphere of the set, and the familiar experience of filming with a cast of mostly men, which reminded her of working on \"Lost\" and \"The Hurt Locker\". However, she said that the experience of having had her first baby in May 2011 made some parts of filming the fighting scenes harder than she expected, saying, \"Recovering from labor is like recovering from a full-body injury, and I didn't realize to what extent that was true until I started training for elf fighting. My hips don't move like they used to move, my back doesn't move like it used to move, my shoulders are sore every day. But it's fun.\"\nOther Tauriel products.\nTauriel is part of the toy Lego set No. 79001, which is called \"Escape from Mirkwood Spiders\". Her minifigures comes with those of Legolas and the Dwarves F\u00edli and K\u00edli.\nCultural effects.\nFor her performance as Tauriel, Evangeline Lilly was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress, the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress in an Action Movie, the Empire Award for Best Supporting Actress, and the 2014 Kids' Choice Awards.\nThe band The Esgaroth Three poked fun at fans' reaction to Tauriel's appearance in the films, and to other changes made by Peter Jackson to the story, with the song and video \"Who the 'ell is Tauriel?\"."}

It was a decisive victory for the Greeks as it ended that war. The battle was in 479 BC near the city of Plataea in Boeotia. It was fought between the Greek allies (the city-states, of Sparta, Athens, Corinth and Megara), and the Persian Empire of Xerxes I.\nThe previous year, the Persian invasion force, led by the Xerxes in person, won the Battles of Thermopylae and Artemisium, and conquered Thessaly, Boeotia and Attica. However, at the last-ditch naval Battle of Salamis, the Allied Greek navy had won a surprise victory, and that stopped the conquest of the whole Peloponnesus. Xerxes then returned home with some of his army, leaving his general Mardonius to finish off the Greeks the next year.\nIn the summer of 479\u00a0BC, the Greeks got together a huge army by the standards of the day, and marched out of the Peloponnesus. The Persians retreated to Boeotia, and built a fortified camp near Plataea. The Greeks refused to be drawn into the open cavalry ground near the Persian camp, and this led to a stalemate which lasted eleven days. When their supply lines were disrupted, the Greeks retreated a distance, and their battle-line fragmented. Mardonius thought the Greeks were in full retreat, and ordered his men to pursue them. The Greeks (particularly the Spartans, Tegeans and Athenians) turned and gave battle, routing the lightly armed Persian infantry and killing Mardonius.\nMuch of the Persian army were caught in their camp, and slaughtered. The destruction of this army, and the remnants of the Persian navy, allegedly on the same day at the Battle of Mycale, ended the invasion. After Plataea and Mycale, the Greek allies would take the offensive against the Persians, marking a new phase of the Greco-Persian Wars. Although Plataea was in every sense a decisive victory, it does not seem (even at the time) to have been as famous as the Athenian victory at the Battle of Marathon or even the Allied defeat at Thermopylae.\nLegacy.\nMonuments to the battle.\nA bronze column in the shape of intertwined snakes (the Serpent column) was created from melted-down Persian weapons, and was erected at Delphi. It commemorated all the Greek city-states that had participated in the battle, listing them on the column, and thus confirming some of Herodotus's claims. Most of it still survives in the Hippodrome of Constantinople (present-day Istanbul), where it was carried by Constantine the Great during the founding of his city on the Greek colony of Byzantium."}

They are the chromosomes which pair during meiosis.\nWith the exception of the sex chromosomes, each pair has the gene loci in the same positions on each chromosome, and the centromere in the same position. They are not genetically identical because they will usually have different alleles (versions of a gene) at some of the loci.\nThe most important fact is that homologous chromosomes physically pair for meiosis, the cell division which produces the gametes. During this pairing, crossing over takes place between chromatids of each pair. This exchange of alleles means the offspring are not identical to each other, or to either parent. In other words, the process increases the genetic variation in the population.\nSex chromosomes only pair along those parts where there is similar genetic material (loci) on both members of the pair."}

It is difficult to make a clear distinction between Chinese folk religion and other beliefs, because Chinese folk religion has elements of veneration of the dead, local spirits, clan spirits and traditional Eastern religions, such as Taoism, Confucianism, Buddhism, but also superstition, geomancy and Feng shui. There is no standarized mythology or clergy: rites are often performed by the father of a family. Since the 1950s, Chinese folk-religion is also sometimes refered to as Shenism or Sh\u00e9nism (Chinese: \"Sh\u00e9n-ji\u00e0o\", \u795e\u6559). In this context, shen refers to a spirit or a deity. The term Shenism was first used by A. J. A Elliot in 1955. The term Chinese folk religion is not used inside China.\nSometimes, it is classified with Taoism: Over the centuries, Taoism became institutionalised. During that time, it tried to use local customs, and to become similar to local religions and beliefs. It would however be more accurate to say that Taoism developed from Shenism, since Shenism was there before. Taoism also developed from Chinese philosophy. With around 454 million adherents, or about 6.6% of the world population, Chinese folk religion is one of the major religious traditions in the world. In China more than 30% of the population adheres to Shenism or Taoism.\nDuring the last 200 years, religion has been heavily suppressed in China, with rebellions such as the Taiping Movement or Cultural Revolution. Today, Chinese folk religion is experiencing a major revival in both Mainland China and Taiwan.\nThe government of Mainland China has officially supported different forms of Shenism, such as Mazuism in Southern China (officially about 160 million Chinese are Mazuists), Huangdi worship, Black Dragon worship in Shaanxi, and Caishen worship."}

It is a comedy. \nThe play was written in 1599 or early 1600. Shakespeare rarely invented his own plays. He based his plays on stories by other writers.

The play was first published in 1623 in the First Folio, a collection of all of Shakespeare's plays. \n\"As You Like It\" tells the story of a young woman named Rosalind. She has been banished from her uncle's court. Her uncle does not like her because she is gentle, beautiful, witty, and smart. Rosalind decides to live in the Forest of Arden with her cousin Celia and the court jester Touchstone. She dresses like a boy for self-protection. Several scenes involve Rosalind and the people who live in the forest. She is finally united with her sweetheart Orlando. \nSome people think the play is not as good as Shakespeare's other plays. Other people think it is a very good play. One of the great speeches in the play begins \"All the world's a stage\". \nThe play is a favourite with theatre-goers. Rosalind, Touchstone, and a sour old man named Jacques are three of Shakespeare's greatest characters. The play has been adapted to a radio play, to a television show, and to musical theatre. A movie version of the play made in 1936 stars Laurence Olivier."}

It shows a richness of form, a fluidity of brush stroke, and a flickering light. The French painter Gustave Caillebotte owned the painting for about 20 years.

The movie was based on a short story that told of the damage done to a small California town in 1947 by thousands of rowdy outlaw bikers. The movie was directed by L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Benedek. It stars Marlon Brando and Lee Marvin (in his movie debut) as rival biker gang leaders. It is the first outlaw biker movie. Critics and teenagers liked the movie. It inspired fads such as sideburns.\nBackground.\nThe movie was based on the short story \"The Cyclists' Raid\" by Frank Rooney. Rooney wrote the story after seeing photos in a \"Life\" magazine showing the damage done by 4,000 bikers to a small town in California after a weekend spree of violence in 1947.\nThe story was published in \"Harper's Magazine\" in 1951. Kramer bought the sceen rights. Brando was leery about taking on the role of a lowlife bully after playing Stanley Kowalski in \"A Streetcar Named Desire\". He accepted though because he liked the director and the movie's social commentary.\nStory.\nJohnny leads his biker gang into a small town. The club members are rowdy. They hang out at the cafe drinking beer. Kathie works in the cafe. Johnny takes a liking to her. He asks her out. She declines. Johnny learns that she is a policeman's daughter. He changes his mind about dating her.\nAnother biker gang rides into town. Their leader is Chino. He does not like Johnny. The two fight. Johnny wins. Chino's bikers vandalize the town and harass the townspeople. They tease Kathie. Johnny rescues her. The two ride into a park. Kathie is attracted to Johnny. He mauls her. She cries and runs off. Johnny rides after her.\nThe townspeople have had enough of the bikers. Some think Johnny assaulted Kathie. Johnny is caught by angry townsmen. They beat him, but he gets away on his motorcycle. The townspeople chase him. A tire iron is thrown. It hits Johnny and he falls from his bike. His motorcycle takes off without its rider. It hits and kills an old man.\nThe sheriff arrives with his deputies. Order is restored. Johnny is arrested for killing the old man. Two witnesses say that Johnny was not responsible for the old man's death. The bikers are ordered to leave town. Johnny goes back to the cafe to say goodbye to Kathie. He then leaves.\nCritical response.\nDave Kehr of \"The Chicago Reader\" has written: \"Legions of Brando impersonators have turned his performance in this seminal 1954 motorcycle movie into self-parody, but it's still a sleazy good time.\" \"Variety\" noted that the film \"is long on suspense, brutality and sadism ... All performances are highly competent.\"\nThe Catholic Legion of Decency objected to the \"excessive brutality, lack of moral compensation and suggestiveness\" in \"The Wild One\". One French journalist described the movie as \"the most unpleasant American movie ever seen.\" The magazine \"Positif\" described the movie as a masterpiece and \"the [movie] of the year\".\nBrando has written: \"The public's reaction to \"The Wild One\" was, I believe, a product of its time and circumstances. It was only seventy-nine minutes long, short by modern standards, and it looks dated and corny now; I don't think it has aged well.\"\nPopular reaction.\nBrando's sideburns inspired a fad. James Dean and Elvis Presley wore them. Brando's character was parodied by Harvey Lembeck in the \"beach party\" movies of the early 1960s.\nPresley used Johnny's image as a model for his role in \"Jailhouse Rock\". James Dean bought a Triumph TR5 Trophy motorcycle like Brando's Triumph Thunderbird 6T motorcycle. For 2010, Triumph motorcycles introduced a range of clothing and promotional items inspired by Brando's image from \"The Wild One\"."}

Grace , (William Gilbert Grace, 18 July 1848 \u2013 23 October 1915) was an English physician and cricketer.\nGrace, always known as 'W.G.', was one of the greatest players, and was important in the development of the sport. He played first-class cricket for a record-equalling 44 seasons, from 1865 to 1908, during which he captained England, Gloucestershire County Cricket Club, the Gentlemen, MCC, the United South of England Eleven and several other teams. He came from a cricketing family. In 1880 W.G. with E.M. Grace, one of his elder brothers, and Fred Grace, his younger brother, was the first time three brothers played together in Test cricket. His father and a cousin were also good players.\nRight-handed as both batsman and bowler, Grace dominated the sport during his career. His technical innovations and enormous influence had a lasting effect. An outstanding all-rounder, he excelled at batting, bowling and fielding. It is for his batting that he is most renowned. Usually opening the innings, he was admired for his mastery of all strokes: his level of expertise was said by contemporary reviewers to be unique. He generally captained the teams he played for at all levels because of his skill and tactical know-how, and his dominant personality.\nGrace qualified as a medical practitioner in 1879. Because of his medical profession, he was nominally an amateur cricketer but he is said to have made more money from cricket than any professional. He was a very competitive player. Although he was one of the most famous men in England, he was also one of the most controversial on account of his gamesmanship and his financial skill.\nHe took part in other sports: as a young man he was a champion 440 yard hurdler, and also played football for the Wanderers. In later life, he developed enthusiasm for golf, lawn bowls and curling.\nTest cricket began in 1877, when Grace was already 28. He made his debut in 1880, scoring England's first-ever Test century against Australia. He played for England in 22 Tests through the 1880s and 1890s, all of them against Australia. He was an automatic selection for England at home, but his only Test-playing tour of Australia was that of 1891\u201392.\nGrace's most significant Test was England v Australia in 1882 at The Oval. Thanks to Spofforth, the 'demon bowler', who took 14 wickets in the match, Australia won by 7 runs and the legend of The Ashes was born. Grace scored only 4 and 32, and he was held responsible for \"firing up\" Spofforth. This came about through a piece of gamesmanship by Grace when he made an unsporting, but legal, run out of one of the Australian batsmen.p137 Grace died of a heart attack."}

She was the star of the sitcoms \"I Love Lucy\", \"The Lucy\u2013Desi Comedy Hour\", \"The Lucy Show\", \"Here's Lucy\" and \"Life With Lucy\". Ball was one of the most popular and powerful actors in the United States during her lifetime. She also had one of Hollywood's longest careers.\nBall began acting in the 1930s. She became both a radio actress and B-movie star in the 1940s. Her television career began in the 1950s. She was still making movies in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1962, Ball became the first woman to run a major television studio, Desilu. This studio made many successful and popular television series.\nEarly life.\nBall was born to Henry Durrell Ball (September 16, 1887 \u2013 February 19, 1915) and Desiree \"DeDe\" Evelyn Hunt (September 21, 1892 \u2013 July 20, 1977) in Jamestown, New York. Her family was Baptist. She was of French, Scottish, English, and Irish ancestry. She had a brother Fred Henry Ball (July 17, 1915 \u2013 February 5, 2007).\nEarly work.\nIn 1929, Ball got work as a model. She later began her performing career on Broadway using the stage name Diane Belmont. She was in many small movie roles in the 1930s. She worked for RKO Radio Pictures at the time. Ball was named the \"Queen of the Bs\".\nI Love Lucy.\nIn 1951, Ball was important in the creation of the television series \"I Love Lucy\". The show ended in 1957 after 180 episodes. Then, some small changes were made to the series format. The time-length of the series was changed from 30\u00a0minutes to 60\u00a0minutes. The first program lasted 75 mins. Some new characters were added. The story was changed. After these changes, the program was renamed \"The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour\". It was shown from 1957 until 1960.\nBall went on to star in two more successful television series. The first was \"The Lucy Show\". It was shown on CBS from 1962 to 1968 (156 episodes). The other was \"Here's Lucy\". It was shown from 1968 to 1974 (144 episodes). Her last television series was in 1986. It was called \"Life with Lucy\". This program did not do very well. Only 8 of the 13 episodes that were made were shown on television.\nMarriage and family.\nBall met and married Cuban band leader Desi Arnaz in 1940. On July 17, 1951, she gave birth to their first child, Lucie D\u00e9sir\u00e9e Arnaz. A year and a half later, Ball gave birth to their second child, Desiderio Alberto Arnaz IV, known as Desi Arnaz, Jr. Ball and Arnaz divorced on 4 May 1960.\nDeath.\nOn April 18, 1989, Ball said she had chest pains at her home in Beverly Hills and was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where she had dissecting aortic aneurysm and had an eight-hour aortic transplant. The surgery worked, and Ball was soon able to walk around her room with very little help. She got a lot of get-well wishes.\nOn the morning of April 26, Ball awoke with bad back pains then lost consciousness. After, she died at 5:47 a.m. PDT at the age of 77. Doctors thought that Ball had succumbed to a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm not that related to her ascending aortic aneurysm and surgery. Ball had been a smoker most of her life, making her risk of abdominal aortic aneurysm higher.\nAwards.\nBall was nominated for an Emmy Award thirteen times. She won four times. In 1977 Ball was one of the first people to be given the Women in Film Crystal Award. She was given the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award in 1979, the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Kennedy Center Honors in 1986, and the Governors Award from the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences in 1989."}

Jules-Henri Vernoy de Saint-Georges and Th\u00e9ophile Gautier wrote the story of the ballet. They based it on a short prose passage in Heinrich Heine's \"De l'Allemagne\". They also used Victor Hugo's poem \"Fant\u00f4mes\". Adolphe Adam wrote the music. Jean Coralli and Jules Perrot designed the dances. Carlotta Grisi danced the role of Giselle in the first production. The scenery was created by Pierre Cisceri. \nThe story is set in Germany during the Renaissance. Giselle is a peasant girl. She falls in love with Albrecht. He is a nobleman pretending to be a peasant boy. Giselle is shocked to discover Albrecht is going to marry the princess Bathilde. Her heart breaks. She goes mad (insane, crazy) and dies. One night, she rises from her grave. She wants to protect Albrecht from the Wilis. The Wilis are the ghostly spirits of dead girls. They force men to dance to their deaths. \nThe ballet was first performed in Paris on Monday 28 June 1841 at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Musique. It was a great success. It was staged almost at once by other ballet companies in Europe, Russia, and the United States. Grisi was declared another Taglioni. Taglioni was the age's greatest ballerina. Ballet historian Grace Robert writes \"\"Giselle\" ... is the archetype of the ballets of the romantic age\".\nStory.\nAct 1.\nThe ballet opens on an autumn morning in Germany. Giselle and Albrecht are in love. Hilarion is in love with Giselle, too. She does not love him though. He grows jealous. He promises to take revenge. Albrecht's gentle manners arouse Hilarion's suspicions. Albrecht is really a Duke. He is pretending to be a peasant. The peasant boys and girls start a waltz. Giselle asks Albrecht to dance with her. Giselle's mother says her daughter has a weak heart. She will die if she does not give up dancing. She is afraid that Giselle will become one of the Wilis. The Wilis are ghostly female spirits. They dance men to death.\nA hunting horn is heard in the distance. Albrecht becomes nervous. He hurries away with the peasants. The Prince of Courland, his daughter Bathilde, and their courtiers enter. They are looking for a place to rest after the hunt. Giselle and her mother bring them food and drink. Bathilde takes an interest in Giselle. They each say that they are in love, and soon to be married. Albrecht returns with the peasants. Bathilde says he is her future husband. Giselle is shocked. She goes mad and dies in her mother's arms. Albrecht is chased away by the peasants.\nAct 2.\nIt is midnight in a dark wood. A pool of water is in the distance. Gamekeepers enter. Hilarion warns them that the spot is haunted by the Wilis. The gamekeepers run away. The Queen of the Wilis rises from the weeds to call the Wilis together. Giselle is about to become one of them. She rises from her grave. She dances. Albrecht enters to pray at Giselle's grave. He sees Giselle. They dance. The Wilis trap Hilarion. They force him to dance. They throw him into the pool to his death. The Queen of the Wilis wants Albrecht to die too. Giselle does not want this. She wants to save his life. Day breaks. The Wilis disappear. Giselle returns to her grave. Bathilde and the courtiers enter. They are looking for Albrecht. He falls into their arms exhausted.\nBackground.\nThe French Revolution (17891799) created a French middle class. These people did not like tastes and values of the aristocracy. These tastes and values had influenced French art and literature since the reign of Louis XIV. The power of the aristocracy had ended with the Revolution. Thousands of aristocrats had died on the guillotine, or in massacres. Many died in prisons, or had fled France for safety in other lands. \nAfter the Revolution, French ballet directors and designers turned their attention to stories based on the Greek and Roman mythologies. The aristocracy liked these stories. The directors and designers however turned instead to the stories the middle class liked. These stories were based on real life, real places, past times, everyday people, and the supernatural.\nTwo ballets with such stories caused great excitement in Paris in the 1830s. In November 1831, Meyerbeer's opera \"Robert le diable\" had its first performance. It included a short ballet called \"The Ballet of the Nuns\". In this little ballet, dead nuns rise from their graves. They dance in the moonlight. The public loved this ballet. In March 1832, the ballet \"La Sylphide\" was performed. This ballet is about a beautiful sylph (fairy). She loves James, a young Scotsman. Tragedy occurs. James accidentally kills the sylph. \nThis ballet brought Marie Taglioni before the French public. She was the first to dance \"en pointe\". She did this for artistic reasons rather than spectacle. She was also the first to wear the white, bell-shaped, calf-length ballet skirt. This skirt is now considered an essential feature of the romantic ballet. Poet and critic Th\u00e9ophile Gautier attended the first performance of \"La Sylphide\". His ideas for \"Giselle\" would show touches of \"La Sylphide\" ten years later. It would be set in a real place and in the past, for example, and would be about everyday people and supernatural women.\nStory development.\nIn an 1841 news article announcing the first performance of \"Giselle\", Th\u00e9ophile Gautier recorded his part in the creation of the ballet. He had read Heinrich Heine's description of the Wilis in \"De l'Allemagne\", and thought these evil spirits would make a \"pretty ballet\". He planned their story for Act 2, and settled upon a verse by Victor Hugo called \"Fant\u00f4mes\" to provide the inspiration for Act 1. This verse is about a beautiful 15 year old Spanish girl who loves to dance. She becomes too warm at a ball, and dies of a chill in the cool morning. \nHeine's prose passage in \"De l'Allemagne\" tells of supernatural young women called the Wilis. They have died before their wedding day and rise from their graves in the middle of the night to dance. Any young man who crosses their path is forced to dance to his death. In another book, the Wilis are said to be jilted young women who have died and become vampires. This is assumed to be the reason that they hate men.\nGautier thought Heine's Wilis and Hugo's fifteen year old Spanish girl would make a good ballet story. His first idea was to present an empty ballroom glittering with crystal and candlelight. The Wilis would cast a spell over the floor. Giselle and other dancers would enter and whirl through the room, unable to resist the spell to keep them dancing. Giselle would try to keep her lover from partnering other girls. The Queen of the Wilis would enter, lay her cold hand on Giselle's heart, and the girl would drop dead. \nGautier was not satisfied with this story. It was basically a succession of dances with one moment of drama at its end. He had no experience writing ballet stories so he called upon Vernoy de St. Georges, a man who had written many stories for the ballet. St. Georges liked Gautier's basic idea of the frail young girl and the Wilis. He wrote the story of Giselle as it is known today in three days, and sent it to L\u00e9on Pillet, the director of the Paris Op\u00e9ra. \nPillet wanted to present a beautiful young Italian dancer named Carlotta Grisi to the public. He considered \"La Sylphide\", but Ad\u00e8le Dumil\u00e2tre reminded him that the role had been promised to her. A ballet in preparation, \"La Rosi\u00e8re de Gand\", was suggested, but Grisi objected. The role was too long and the story was not suitable for dance. Pillet needed a good story, and he found it in \"Giselle\". Grisi liked the story as much as Pillet did, so \"Giselle\" was put into development at once.\nMusic.\nAdolphe Adam was a popular writer of ballet and opera music in early 19th-century France. He wrote with great speed. He completed \"Giselle\" in about two months. The music was written in the smooth, song-like style of the day called \"cantilena\". This style is well known to music lovers from Bellini's opera \"Norma\" and Donizetti's \"Lucia di Lammermoor\". \nAdam used several \"leitmotifs\" in the ballet. A \"leitmotif\" is a short musical phrase that is associated with a certain character, event, or idea. Adam's leitmotifs are heard several times throughout the ballet. A leitmotif is associated with Giselle, and another with Albrecht. Hilarion's motif marks his every entrance. It suggests the Fate theme in Beethoven's \"Fifth Symphony\". Another leitmotif is associated with the \"he loves me, he loves me not\" flower test in Act 1. This leitmotif is heard again in the mad scene, and in Act 2 when Giselle offers flowers to Albrecht. The Wilis have their own motif. It is heard in the overture, in Act 1 when Berthe tells the story of the Wilis, and in the mad scene. It is heard again in Act 2 when the Wilis make their first entrance. The hunting horn motif marks sudden surprises. This motif is heard when Albrecht is exposed as a nobleman.\nThe music was completely original with Adam. A critic noted however that Adam had borrowed eight bars from a romance by a Miss Puget and three bars from the huntsman's chorus in Carl Maria von Weber's opera \"Euryanth\u00e9\". In addition, two pieces by Friedrich Burgm\u00fcller were put into the ballet. One was a waltz called \"Souvenir de Ratisbonne\". The other music was a group of dances performed by Giselle's friends. It is unknown who put these pieces into the ballet.\nOne dance historian writes:\nDance and pantomime.\nJean Coralli and Jules Perrot designed the dances for \"Giselle\". Perrot and Carlotta Grisi were lovers, and Perrot designed all of Grisi's dances and all of her pantomime. Everyone in the Paris dance world knew that Perrot had designed Grisi's dances, and Coralli said so, but Perrot was given no official credit in the printed materials such as posters and programs. This was most likely done to prevent Perrot from collecting royalties (money, profits) on the ballet. Perrot liked bold touches and planned several rapid aerial swoops on wires in Act 2 for Giselle. Grisi was afraid of these swoops. A stage hand was brought in to test the swoops. He crashed face-first into the scenery. The swoops were abandoned. \nCyril Beaumont writes that \"Giselle\" is made up of two elementsdance and mime. Act 1 features short mimed scenes, he points out, and episodes of dancing which are fused with mime. In Act 2, mime has become fused entirely with dance. He writes that the choreographic vocabulary is composed of a small number of simple steps: \nBeaumont speculates that the simple steps were deliberately planned to allow the \"utmost expressiveness.\" \nParts of \"Giselle\" have been cut or changed since the ballet's first night. Giselle's Act 1 pantomime scene in which she tells Albrecht of her strange dream is cut. The peasant \"pas de deux\" in Act 1 is cut back a bit. The Prince of Courland and his daughter Bathilde used to make their entrance on horseback, but today they walk on. In the original production, the Prince and Bathilde were present at Giselle's death, but now they leave the scene before she dies. The machines used to make Giselle fly and to make her disappear are no longer used. A trapdoor is sometimes employed to make Giselle rise from her grave and then to make her sink into it at the end of Act 2. \nAt the end of Act 2, Bathilde formerly entered with the courtiers to search for Albrecht. He took a few unsteady steps toward them and collapsed into their arms. This moment was an artistic parallel to the Act 1 finale when the peasants gathered about the dead Giselle. Now, Bathilde and the courtiers are cut, and Albrecht slowly leaves the stage alone.\nEthnic music, dance, and costume.\nEthnic music, dance, and costume were a large part of romantic ballet. At the time \"Giselle\" was written, people thought of Germany when they heard a waltz because the waltz was of German origin. Giselle makes her first entrance to the music of a waltz, and the audience would have known at once that the ballet was set in Germany. Adam wrote three waltzes for \"Giselle\": two for Giselle and one for the Wilis. Adam wrote that the \"Giselle Waltz\" in Act 1 has \"all the German color indicated by the locality.\" People agreed. One critic wrote: \"A lovely waltz ... in the Germanic spirit of the subject\". \nAt first, Gautier thought that some of the dancers in the Act 2 waltz for the Wilis should dress in ethnic costume and dance ethnic steps. Adam put bits of French, Spanish, German, and Indian -sounding music in the waltz for this purpose. Gautier's \"ethnic\" idea was dropped as the ballet developed however, and it has not been picked up by modern producers. Today, Act 2 is a \"ballet blanc\"a \"white\" ballet in which all the ballerinas and the \"corps de ballet\" are dressed in full, white, bell-shaped skirts and the dances have a geometric design.\nOriginal designs.\nCostumes.\nThe historical period for \"Giselle\" is not indicated in the story. Paul Lormier, the chief costume designer at the Paris Op\u00e9ra, probably consulted Gautier on this matter. It is also possible that Pillet had the ballet's budget in mind and decided to use the many Renaissance-style costumes in the Op\u00e9ra's wardrobe for \"Giselle\". These costumes were said to have been those from Rossini's \"William Tell\" (1829) and Berlioz's \"Benvenuto Cellini\" (1838). Lormier certainly designed the costumes for the principal characters. His costumes were in use at the Op\u00e9ra until the ballet was dropped from the repertory in 1853. \n\"Giselle\" was revived in 1863 with new costumes by Lormier's assistant, Alfred Albert. Albert's costumes are closer to those of modern productions than those of Lormier, and were in use at the opera until 1868. The ballet was revived again in 1924 with scenery and costumes by Alexandre Benois. He wanted to revive the costumes of the original production but dropped the idea, believing the critics would charge him with a lack of imaginative creativity.\nSets.\nPierre Luc Charles Ciceri was the chief set designer at the Paris Op\u00e9ra from 1815 to 1847. He designed the sets for the first production of \"Giselle\". Gautier was not specific about the ballet's locale, but placed it in \"some mysterious corner of Germany ... on the other side of the Rhine\". This would have been the eastern side. \n\"Giselle\" was two months in rehearsal. This was a very long rehearsal time for the period. Even so, Ciceri did not have enough time to design sets for both acts and focused on the second act. The sets for the first act were actually those designed for the 1838 ballet, \"La Fille du Danube\" by Adam. An illustration from \"Les Beaut\u00e9s de l'Opera\" of 1845 shows Giselle's cottage with a roof of straw on the left, and Albrecht's cottage on the right. The two cottages are framed by the branches of two large trees on either sides of the stage. Between the two cottages, in the distance, appears a castle and slopes covered with vineyards. Although this scene was not designed for \"Giselle\", it has remained the model for most modern productions. Ciceri's set was in use until the ballet was dropped from the repertoire in 1853. At that time, Gautier noticed that the sets were falling apart: \"Giselle's cottage has barely three or four straws on its roof.\" \nThe Act 2 illustration from \"Les Beaut\u00e9s\" shows a dark wood with a pool of water in the distance. The branches of aged trees create an arch overhead. Beneath these branches on the left is a marble cross with 'Giselle' written on it. From one of its arms hangs the crown of grape leaves Giselle wore as Queen of the Vintage. On the stage, thick weeds and wildflowers (200 bulrushes and 120 branches of flowers) were the undergrowth. The gas jets of the footlights and those overhead suspended in the flies were turned low to create a mood of mystery and terror. \nA circular hole was cut into the backdrop and covered with a transparent material. A strong light behind this hole represented the moon. The light was occasionally manipulated to suggest the passage of clouds. Gautier and St. Georges wanted the pool to be made of large mirrors. Pillet rejected this idea because of its cost. In the 1868 revival however, the mirrors were acquired for this scene.\nAdam thought Ciceri's backdrop for Act 1 was \"not so good ... it is all weak and pale\" but he liked the set for Act 2: \"[Ciceri's] second act is a delight, a dark humid forest filled with bulrushes and wild flowers, and ending with a sunrise, seen at first through the trees at the end of the piece, and very magical in its effect.\" The sunrise also delighted the critics.\nFirst performance.\nThe balletomanes of Paris became very excited as the opening night of \"Giselle\" approached. News reports kept their interest alive. Some reports said that Grisi had had an accident. Some reports said that the conductor was ill with a tumour. Still others said that the stage hands feared for their safety.\nHopes that the ballet would be ready in May were dashed. Opening night was postponed several times. Grisi was absent for a few days and her return was delayed to protect her health. Lighting, trapdoors, and scene changes needed further rehearsals. Cuts were made in Grisi's role to spare the dancer's health. Instead of returning to her tomb at the end of the ballet, it was decided Giselle would be placed on a bed of flowers and sink slowly into the earth. This touch preserved the romantic mood of the Act 2 finale.\n \nAt last, on Monday 28 June 1841, the curtain rose on \"Giselle\" in the Salle Le Peletier. Grisi played Giselle with Lucien Petipa as her lover Albrecht, M. Simon as the gamekeeper Hilarion, and Ad\u00e8le Dumil\u00e2tre as Myrtha, the Queen of the Wilis. Typical of the theatrical practices of the time, \"Giselle\" was preceded by an excerpt from another productionin this case, the third act of Rossini's opera, \"Moise\". \nIn spite of the chief machinist shouting orders to his crew that could be heard by the audience, \"Giselle\" was a great success. Grisi was a sensation. Ballet-goers regarded her as another Taglioni, the greatest ballerina of the period.\nContemporary reviews and comments.\n\"Giselle\" was a great artistic and commercial success. \"Le Constitutionnel\" praised Act 2 for its \"poetic effects\". \"Moniteur des th\u00e9\u00e2tres\" wrote that Grisi \"runs [and] flies across the stage like a gazelle in love\". One critic made a detailed analysis of the music in \"La France Musicale\". He thought the Act 1 waltz \"ravishing\", and noted that the scene of Berthe's narrative was filled with \"quite new\" harmonic modulations. He praised other moments in Act 1 (especially the mad scene), and was in raptures with the music of Act 2, singling out the entrance of the Wilis and the viola solo played through Giselle's last moments. He thought the flute and harp music accompanying Giselle as she disappeared into her grave at ballet's end \"full of tragic beauty.\"\nCoralli was praised for the Act 1 peasant \"pas de deux\" and for the \"elegance\" of Act 2. Coralli followed a suggestion made by Gautier and picked the most beautiful girls in the company to play the peasants and the Wilis. One observer thought the selection process cruel: the almost-beautiful girls were turned away without a second thought.\nGrisi and Petipa were great successes as the tragic lovers. Gautier praised their performance in Act 2, writing that the two dancers made the act \"a real poem, a choreographic elegy full of charm and tenderness ... More than one eye that thought it was seeing only [dance] was surprised to find its vision obscured by a tearsomething that does not often happen in a ballet ... Grisi danced with a perfection ... that places her in the ranks between Elssler and Taglioni ... Her miming surpassed every expectation ... She is nature and artlessness personified.\"\nAdam thought Petipa \"charming\" as both dancer and actor, and that he had \"rehabilitated\" male dancing with his performance. Of Dumil\u00e2tre he wrote, \"... in spite of her coldness, [Dumil\u00e2tre] deserved the success she achieved by the correctness and the 'mythological' quality of her poses: perhaps this word may seem a little pretentious, but I can think of no other to express such cold and noble dancing as would suit Minerva in a merry mood, and in this respect [Dumil\u00e2tre] seems to bear a strong resemblamce to that goddess.\"\n\"Giselle\" made 6500 francs between June and September 1841. This was twice the amount for the same time period in 1839. Grisi's salary was increased to make her the top earner among the dancers at the Op\u00e9ra. Souvenirs were sold. Pictures of Grisi as Giselle were printed, and sheet music arrangements were made for social dancing. The sculptor Emile Thomas made a statuette of Giselle in her Act 2 costume. A silk cloth was manufactured called \"fa\u00e7onn\u00e9 Giselle\", and Madame Lainn\u00e9, a milliner, sold an artificial flower called 'Giselle'. The ballet was parodied at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Palais-Royal in October 1841.\nEarly productions.\n\"Giselle\" was performed in Paris from its debut in 1841 to 1849. It was then dropped from the repertory. Grisi always danced the title role. The ballet was revived in 1852 and 1853, but without Grisi. The work was dropped from the repertory after 1853. It was revived in 1863 for a Russian ballerina then dropped in 1868. It was revived almost 50 years later in 1924 for the debut of Olga Spessivtzeva. This production was revived in 1932 and 1938.\n\"Giselle\" was produced by other ballet companies in Europe and America almost immediately after its first night. The British had their first taste of \"Giselle\"not with the ballet but with a drama based on the ballet called \"Giselle, or The Phantom Night Dancers\" by William Moncrieff. He had seen the ballet in Paris the same year. The play was performed on 23 August 1841 at the Theatre Royal, Sadler's Wells. \nThe actual ballet was first staged in London at Her Majesty's Theatre on 12 March 1842 with Grisi as Giselle and Perrot as Albrecht. The dances were credited to Perrot and one Deshayes. It was revived many times, once in 1884 with a Mlle. Sismondi in the role of Albrecht. This production was received with little enthusiasm. It was preceded by the operetta \"Pocahontas\".\nThe ballet was staged by Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in 1911 at the Royal Opera, Covent Garden with Tamara Karsavina and Nijinsky as Giselle and Albrecht. Anna Pavlova danced Giselle with her own company in 1913. Alicia Markova danced the role with the Vic-Wells Ballet in 1934, and Margot Fonteyn took the role in 1937 when Markova left the company. The English loved \"Giselle\". In 1942, for example, three different companies were dancing the ballet in London.\n\"Giselle\" was first performed in Russia at the Bolshoi Theatre, St. Petersburg, on 18 December 1842. Gedeonov, the Director of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres, sent his Ballet Master Titus to Paris to find a new ballet for ballerina Elena Andreyanova. Titus picked \"Giselle\". The Ballet Master then staged the work completely from memory in St. Petersburg. Perrot produced \"Giselle\" in St. Petersburg in 1851. He made many changes to the ballet in his years of service to the Imperial Ballet. In the 1880s, Ballet Master Marius Petipa made many changes to the Perrot production.\n\"Giselle\" was first staged in Italy at Teatro alla Scala in Milan on 17 January 1843. The music however was not Adam's, but that of one N. Bajetti. The dances were not the original either, but those of one A. Cortesi. It is possible, but unknown if, the ballet was first staged in the provincial theatres.\nIn 1844, American ballerina Mary Ann Lee arrived in Paris to study with Coralli for a year. She returned to the United States in 1841 with the directions for \"Giselle\" and other ballets. Lee was the first to present \"Giselle\" in the United States. She did this on 1 January 1846 in Boston at the Howard Athen\u00e6um. George Washington Smith played Albrecht. Lee danced \"Giselle\" (again with Smith) on 13 April 1846 at the Park Theatre in New York City.\nModern productions.\nNijinsky was going to dance Albrecht for the first time in St. Petersburg in January 1911. The Czar and his family would be present. Diaghilev wanted Nijinsky to wear the Renaissance-style costume he had worn in Paris the same month. It was easier to dance in than the thick pants of traditional Russian Albrechts, but his genitals (though covered) could be detected. He was ordered not to wear it. Nijinsky said that he only wanted to dance well. According to Stravinsky, Nijinsky wore not much more than the tightest tights and a padded athletic supporter (jockstrap). The next day, the angry director of the Imperial Theatres ordered Nijinsky to apologize. Complaints about the dancer were collected here and there. Nijinsky knew Diaghilev would give him work, so he resigned. On 24 January 1911 he was officially dismissed from the Imperial Theatres.\nStructure.\nAct I\nAct II"}

It was written in 1847. It is a piece of music for the piano. It is sometimes called \"The Waltz of the Little Dog\" (). This is because Chopin was watching a little dog chase its tail when he wrote it. The little dog was \"Marquis\". He belonged to Chopin's friend George Sand. Marquis had befriended Chopin. The composer mentioned Marquis in several of his letters. In one letter dated 25 November 1846, Chopin wrote: \"Please thank Marquis for missing me and for sniffing at my door.\" \nThe waltz was published by Breitkopf &amp; H\u00e4rtel. It was the first of three waltzes in a collection of waltzes called \"Trois Valses, Op. 64\". The publisher gave the waltz its popular nickname \"Minute\". The word here means small or little. The tempo marking is Molto vivace (), but Chopin did not intend the waltz to be played in one minute as some believe. A typical performance will last between one and a half to two and a half minutes. \nThe time signature is 3/4. The waltz is 138 measures long with one fifteen-measure repeat. The waltz is written in ternary, or ABA form. The A section is characterized by a whirling line of eighth notes and triplets over the \"om-pah-pah\" rhythm of the waltz. The whirling line of the A section is abandoned in the B section. This section consists of a consistent half note and quarter note pattern from bar to bar. The B section breaks off and a long trill heralds the return of the A section, which is repeated in full. The waltz ends with a descending scale. \nIn popular culture, Minute Waltz was used on Pretty Little Liars, The Girlfriend Experience, One Tree Hill, and Sex and the City. "}

If he did, that pupil is not known. In the end, the story behind the sonata is a mystery.\nOn 2 August 1788 Mozart wrote a letter to his sister Nannerl. She was living in Salzburg. He had sent her some pieces for the piano. He wrote, \"Indeed you have every reason to be vexed with me! But will you really be so, when you receive by this mail coach my very latest compositions for the keyboard? Surely not! This, I hope, will make everything all right again.\" This passage might refer to the Sonata in C. But it may refer to other keyboard compositions Mozart wrote the same year. \nThe manuscript is lost. The piece was not published during Mozart's lifetime. It was first published in February 1805 by the Bureau des arts et d'Industrie in Vienna. It was titled \"Sonate facile pour le pianoforte\" (). At least three more editions were published within a short time. Breitkopf &amp; H\u00e4rtel did not include it in their Oeuvres complettes. A typical performance lasts about 14 minutes.\nMusic.\nThe first movement is written in sonata form. It is in the key of C major. The tempo marking is Allegro (Fast). The opening theme is accompanied by an Alberti bass played in the left hand. A bridge passage composed of scales follows, arriving at a cadence in G major, the key in which the second theme is then played. A codetta follows to conclude the exposition. The exposition is repeated. The development starts in G minor and modulates through several keys. The recapitulation begins in the subdominant key of F major. According to Charles Rosen, the practice of beginning a recapitulation in the subdominant was \"rare at the time [the sonata] was written\"..\nThe second movement is in the key of G major, the dominant key of C major. The music modulates to the dominant key of D major, and then back to G major in which the exposition is heard again. For the development, the music modulates to G minor, then B\u266d major, then C minor, then G minor and finally back to G major, at which point the recapitulation occurs followed by a short coda.\nThe third movement is in rondo form. It is in the tonic key of C major. The first theme is lively. It sets the mood of the piece. The second theme is in G major. It has an Alberti bass in the left hand. The first theme appears again. A third theme is in a minor key. It modulates through different keys before returning to C major. The first theme appears again. It is followed by a coda, and the rondo ends in C major. \nThe finale was transcribed to F major. It was put together with a solo piano arrangement of the second movement of the violin sonata in F major. It became the Piano Sonata in F major, K. 547a."}

The tune is characterized by a repetitious but elegant dotted eighth note and sixteenth note legato pattern. The first 8 bars are played and repeated. This passage begins in the tonic key of G major, and modulates to the dominant key of D major. The second 8 bars are played and repeated. This passage begins in the dominant key of D major, and modulates to the tonic key of G major. The first phrase of this passage begins with 4 bars of principally quarter notes. The phrase returns to the dotted eighth note pattern at its close. Thus, the entire A section begins and ends in the tonic key with brushes on the dominant here and there. The right hand is occupied with playing mostly thirds and sixths through the A section. The left hand plays only quarter notes. \nLike the A section, the B section (or the Trio) is composed of two 8 bar passages for a total of 16 bars. Like the A section, it begins in the tonic key of G major, and modulates to the dominant key of D major at the end of the first 8 bars. This passage is repeated. The second 8 bars begin in the dominant key and end in the tonic key. These 8 bars are repeated. The entire B section is characterized by flowing, uninterrupted eighth notes in the right hand. The left hand plays quarter notes but briefly joins the right hand in playing eighth notes at the beginning of the second 8 bar passage. The left hand returns to playing quarter notes as the passage closes. When the B section is completed and all the repeats have been taken, the piece returns the A section. This return is usually played without performing the repeats. "}

In a standing start, cars are completely still when a green signal is given to start the race. This often follows a set of lights that count down to the start of the race. Standing starts are common in many motorsports, including drag racing, most single-seat (Formula One and GP2 Series), Touring Cars (most notably British and World Touring Cars), V8 Supercars, and many types of short-course off-road races. The standing start often occurs following a parade lap.\nThe opposite of a standing start is a rolling start. Standing starts are often deemed safer in Formula sports because of high acceleration speeds, which could cause problems if a rolling start were used. A standing start can cause problems like stalled cars being hit by the driver who starts behind them on the grid. Motorsports using standing starts usually penalize drivers who \"jump the start\", or redlight, by moving before the green light is lit."}

La Varenne wrote for professional chefs, and codified French cuisine for the age of Louis XIV. \nThe seventeenth century saw French cooking come into the modern era. The heavily spiced flavours of the Middle Ages were abandoned in favour of the natural flavours of French foods. Exotic spices (saffron, cinnamon, cumin, ginger, nutmeg, cardamom, nigella, seeds of paradise) were, with the exception of pepper, replaced by local herbs (parsley, thyme, bayleaf, chervil, sage, tarragon). New vegetables like cauliflower, asparagus, peas, cucumber and artichoke were introduced. Special care was given to the cooking of meat in order to conserve maximum flavour. Vegetables had to be fresh and tender. Fish, with the improvement of transportation, had to be impeccably fresh. Preparation had to respect the taste and visual look of the ingredients instead of masking them as had been done before.\nLa Varenne introduced the first bisque and B\u00e9chamel sauce. He replaced crumbled bread with roux as the base for sauces, and lard with butter. Here one finds the first use of the terms bouquet garni, \"fonds de cuisine\" (stocks) and reductions, and the use of egg-whites for clarification. It also has the earliest recipe in print for mille-feuille. The cooking of vegetables is discussed, a novelty. In a fragrant sauce for asparagus there is evidence of an early form of hollandaise sauce:\nLa Varenne had earlier (1650) written a book on \"confitures\"\u2014jams, jellies and preserves. That included recipes for syrups, compotes and a great variety of fruit drinks, as well as a section on salads.\nLa Varenne wrote a third book, \"Le P\u00e2tissier fran\u00e7ois\" (Paris 1653), which was the first comprehensive French work on pastry-making. In 1662 was the first of the combined editions that presented all three works together. All the early editions of La Varenne's works\u2014\"Le Cuisinier fran\u00e7ois\" ran through some thirty editions in seventy-five years\u2014are extremely rare; like children's books, they too were worn to pieces, in the kitchen, and simply used up.\nPirated editions of \"Le Cuisinier fran\u00e7ois\" were printed in Amsterdam (1653) and The Hague (1654-56). Soon there were imitators: \"Le cuisinier fran\u00e7ois m\u00e9thodique\" was published anonymously in Paris, 1660. The English translation, \"The French Cook\" (London 1653) was the first French cookbook translated into English. It introduced professional terms like \"\u00e0 la mode\", \"au bleu\" (very rare), and \"au naturel\" which are now standard culinary expressions. Its success can be gauged from the fact that over 250,000 copies were printed in about 250 editions and it remained in print until 1815. \nLa Varenne had ten years' experience as \"chef de cuisine\" to the Marquis d'Uxelles, to whom he dedicated his publications and whom he immortalized in \"duxelles\", finely-minced mushrooms seasoned with herbs and shallots, which is still a favourite flavouring for fish and vegetables. \n\"Le Cuisinier fran\u00e7ois\" was reprinted in 1983, published by Editions Montalba with a comprehensive introductory essay."}

The King had known Handel for a long time. For some reason though, he was angry with Handel. The \"Water Music\" was Handel's way of appeasing the King. Fifty musicians floated alongside the King's barge playing the suites. The King was so pleased he ordered \"Water Music\" played three times.\nAnother Legend has it that He played it for a party King George I was having. It says he hired Handel to write a piece of music for him and his royal friends to listen to while sailing in the water; thus the name Water Music \nAll the instruments in the Baroque orchestra were included in the composition, except the harpsichord and timpani. It would have been difficult to bring these instruments aboard a barge.

In the context of exception handling, a program is said to be exception-safe, if exceptions that occur will not produce side-effects (such as memory leaks), will not change stored data so that it becomes unreadable, or generate output that is invalid. There are different levels of exception safety:\nUsually, a programmer will try to \"catch\" the exception early so that problems don't get worse over time.\nExample.\nSuppose a program tries to add something to an \"array\", or group of \"objects\" that doesn't exist. This is called a \"null reference\". Look at the following code from the Java programming language:\nThis code throws what programmers call a \"null-pointer exception\".

It is based on a novel of the same name by Gaston Leroux. The movie was directed by Rupert Julian. It stars Lon Chaney as the Phantom and Mary Philbin as his love, Christine. The movie is famous for Chaney's horrific, self-applied make-up.\nPlot.\nThe story is about a disfigured man named Erik who haunts the Paris Opera. He wants the managers to make the woman he loves, named Christine, a star. In order to do this, he terrorizes everyone by doing things such as dropping a chandelier and wearing a scary disguise in the middle of a large party. When he learns that Christine is in love with a man named Raoul, he kidnaps her. Raoul eventually rescues her, and a group of angry people chase the Phantom until he falls into the Seine river.\nCritical reception and legacy.\nThe movie was a great success. The critics liked it. Executives at Universal Pictures were pleased. They put a string of horror movies into production. These movies included Bela Lugosi's \"Dracula\" and Boris Karloff's \"Frankenstein\". \"Phantom\" was chosen for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.\nTwo major versions of the film survive today. The original film (today) comes from bad quality \"show at home\" film prints which are entirely black and white. The more common version is a 1929 silent version using different takes and camera angles. The 1929 silent version exists because of a lost 1929 sound version in which new scenes were shot in sound."}

Behind the moon, beyond the rain.\" She begins to sing the song.\nMGM executives thought the song \"slowed down the picture\". They said it did not sound like a song a little girl would sing in a barnyard. They wanted to cut it from the movie. Other people wanted the song to be kept in the movie. The executives changed their minds and the song was kept.\n\"Over the Rainbow\" was going to be sung again by Garland in the scene where she is locked in the witch's room and watches the hourglass.

Japan has many traditional sports such as sumo, judo, karate, and kendo. Also, there are sports which were imported from the West such as baseball, soccer, golf and skiing. Sports are popular with both participants and onlookers.\nHistory.\nSome traditional sports like \"yabusame\" have ancient histories.\nIn the Meiji period, sports which were imported from the West became popular.\nAnother popular spectator sport is professional wrestling, locally known as \"puroresu\" (\u30d7\u30ed\u30ec\u30b9). While the sport was known in Japan before World War II, it did not become widely popular until the rise of Rikid\u014dzan, considered the \"father\" of puroresu, in the 1950s. While similar to professional wrestling in the rest of the world in that winners are decided before the match, puroresu has become a unique style. Most match storylines play up the wrestlers' \"fighting spirit\". Also, because many Japanese wrestlers have martial arts backgrounds, most strikes during matches make full contact. Puroresu also enjoys close ties to mixed martial arts, with some companies often holding wrestling matches and MMA fights in the same event; because of this, both wrestlers and fans treat puroresu as a combat sport.\nAt first, Western sports were valued as a form of mental discipline, but they have become recreational activities.\nNotable athletes, sports clubs, sports schools and training clinics played an important part in spreading sports in Japan.\nIn Japan, sports groups are an important part of school life. The time spent in these groups allows students to adjust to Japan's vertical society. For example, in sports, players learn to use \"keigo\" (formal, polite speech), respect and traditions.\nOlympic games.\nThe 1940 Summer Olympics and the 1940 Winter Olympics were planned for Japan, but the organizers withdrew in 1938 because of the Second Sino-Japanese War. These games were later cancelled because of World War II.\nJapan did host the Olympic games three times, and has been confirmed as host for a fourth Olympics:\nOther websites.\nThe Japanese translation of this book is available at: https://la84.org/wp-content/uploads/LA84WaterPolo_J-1.pdf"}

It is a well-known cat, especially for its blue eyes and brown face, ears, tail and paws, although not all of them look like this. In Thailand, it is a native breed, and they are called \"Wichian Mat\" (), which means \"moon diamond\". There are two different types of Siamese Cat, the Traditional or Thai Siamese, and the Modern Siamese.\nAppearance.\nThe fur on all Siamese cats has the same sort of pattern, known as point coloration. This is when an animal has a pale body and a dark face, ears, feet and tail.\nTraditional Siamese.\nThe Traditional Siamese has a few features that are the same as the Modern Siamese, like the colour pattern and the short fur, but it is different because of its head and body shape. It has long legs, and is thin and is graceful. It has a wedge shaped head and muzzle, and round cheeks. The ears are large and high. The eyes are between medium and large, and have the shape of an almond.\nModern Siamese.\nThe body of a Modern Siamese is flexible and well-muscled. Its head is in the shape of a triangle, with a thin snout-like muzzle. Their eyes are also almond shaped, and their ears are tall and sit more on the side of the head than the Traditional Siamese. It's neck and tail are long and thin.\nBehaviour.\nSiamese cats, both Traditional and Modern, are usually very friendly and loving cats, and will enjoy spending time with you, although this depends on the cat. They are known to bond to one person. They are also very smart, more so than some other cats. Some Siamese cat's enjoy 'talking', which has been said to sound like a human baby, and are always want attention. Siamese cat's love to play and run around as if they were kittens all their life.\nUnlike most cats, they are less active at night, and prefer to sleep through it. This might be because their eyes lack something called tapetum lucidum, which allows cats to see better in the dark. Also, unlike many other blue-eyed cats, Siamese cats can still hear well. Cats that are white with blue eyes are often deaf."}

Some critics liked the movie. Some did not. Women loved it. Most men did not like it. They either walked out or stayed away.\nStory.\nLady Diana Mayo is headstrong and independent. Against her brother's advice, she plans a trip into the desert with only native guides. That night Diana sneaks into an 'Arabs Only' casino wearing a dancer's costume. The Sheik is there. He discovers she is white. He is amused, but sends her away. He learns that she is taking a trip into the desert the next day. He sneaks into her room and tampers with the bullets in her revolver. Later, the Sheik and his men find Diana riding alone. She tries to flee while shooting at the Sheik. He easily captures her. He takes her to his camp. He orders her about. He tells her she will learn to love him. He wants to raping her, but decides against it.\nThe Sheik receives a visit from his friend, Raoul St. Hubert. Raoul befriends Diana. He chides the Sheik for treating her roughly. Diana gradually warms to the Sheik. She is allowed to go into the desert with his servant. She escapes. She sees a caravan. It belongs to the bandit Omair. The Sheik and his men reach her just in time. The Sheik is in love with Diana. He allows her to ride out again with his servant. She writes \"I love you\" in the sand.

When the old man died, the Sheik returned to rule the tribe. The Sheik recovers from his injury. Diana confesses her love.\nReception.\nReviews were mixed. Many critics felt the toned-down rape scene ruined the original message. It was a great success with audiences however. Attendance records were broken. One newspaper estimated that 125,000 people had seen the movie in its first weeks. Producer Lasky declared the last week of November 1921 'The Sheik Week'. He had the movie open in 250 theatres across the United States on 20 November. The movie ran for six months in Sydney, Australia. It ran for 42 weeks in one theatre in France. It was the first Valentino movie to show in his native Italy. Within the first year, \"The Sheik\" made more than $1 million. The film cost $200,000 to make.\nFemale moviegoers loved Valentino. Male moviegoers loathed him. Men refused to see the movie. If they did, they laughed at the love scenes. Men walked out during the movie. They felt threatened by Valentino's style of lovemaking. Many called him effeminate for the long robes he wore in the movie. Dick Dorgan harshly criticized Valetino in the magazine \"Photoplay\". He thought Valentino was too pretty for a male.

She is abducted by Arab slave traders. She is rescued by an African American military battalion. She is taken to a mission school. She becomes acquainted with Western-style civilization. She never completely loses touch with the tribal customs and influences that shaped her early years.\n\"A Daughter of the Congo\" was Micheaux's last silent movie. Silent movies were considered to have little money-making value in 1930. Micheaux released the movie as a \u201ctalking, singing, dancing picture\u201d. It only contained a single short sound sequence that included a performance of the song \u201cThat Gets It\u201d.\nTheophilus Lewis of the \"Amsterdam News\" wrote a harsh review: \"The scene is laid in a not so mythical republic in Africa. Half of the characters wear European clothes and are supposed to be civilized, while the other half wear their birthday suits and some feathers and are supposed to be savages.

He is regarded as the first major African-American moviemaker, and the most successful African-American moviemaker of the first half of the twentieth century. Micheaux was the most prominent producer of race movies. He produced both silent movies and \"talkies\".\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nMicheaux was born to former slaves on January 2, 1884, in Metropolis, Illinois. He passed most of his early years in Great Bend, Kansas. He moved to Chicago when he was 17. He worked as a Pullman porter (railroad baggage handler). In 1906, he bought land in South Dakota. He homesteaded among white neighbors for eight years.\nHe began to write stories. In 1913, he self-published his first novel, \"The Conquest: The Story of a Negro Pioneer\". In 1915, he had money troubles and lost his land. He moved to Sioux City, Iowa where he ran his own publishing company. In 1917, he rewrote \"The Conquest\" and published it as \"The Homesteader\". He sold the book door-to-door in small towns.\nMoviemaking.\nAn African American movie company wanted to make a movie of \"The Homesteader\". The company however did not want Micheaux to direct it. They would not agree to a budget that met his expectations. The deal was dropped.\nMicheaux then turned his publishing company into the Micheaux Film and Book Company. He sold stock in the company to raise money for his own movie of \"The Homesteader\", and shooting began. It was the first feature-length movie made by an African American. It was released in Chicago in 1919, and was a great success.\nMicheaux's second movie was \"Within Our Gates\". This was his response to D. W. Griffith's \"Birth of a Nation\". Griffith's movie was about the Ku Klux Klan. It was one of the most popular movies of the day. The movie challenged Griffith's message by showing that whites were more likely to harm blacks than the other way around.\nMicheaux would make more than 40 movies over the next 30 years. In 1931, his movie \"The Exile\" became the first full-length sound feature by an African American. His last movie \"The Betrayal\" (1948) was the first movie produced by an African American\u00ad to open in white theaters.\nDeath.\nMicheaux died on 25 March 1951 in Charlotte, North Carolina. He is buried in the Great Bend Cemetery in Great Bend, Kansas. His gravestone reads, \"A Man Ahead of His Time.\"\nIn 1986, the Directors Guild of America posthumously granted Micheaux the Golden Jubilee Special Directorial Award. In 1987, he received a star on Hollywood Boulevard's Walk of Fame."}

The palace was the home of the Doge of Venice, the ruler of the Republic of Venice In 1923 the palace became a museum, one of 11 museums run by the Fondazione Musei Civici di Venezia. In 2010 it was visited by 1,358,186 people.\nHistory.\nIn 810, Doge Angelo Partecipazio moved the government from the island of Malamocco to the Rialto. The first palace was destroyed by a fire in the 10th century, which is in the 900s. A second palace was started by Doge Sebastiano Ziani (1172\u20131178). There are still parts of this building which can be seen on the ground floor, including stone wall bases and some brick paving. As Venice grew, the palace needed to be rebuilt to meet new demands. For example, changes in the political structure meant there were many more members of the Great Council. \nThis third palace, in Gothic style, was started about 1340. The first section was on the side facing the lagoon. In 1424 Doge Francesco Foscari built the wing overlooking the Piazzetta. This new building was for the law-courts, with a ground floor arcade on the outside. The first floor had open loggias running along the facade. When the Porta della Carta was built in 1442, it made an internal courtyard. \nIn 1483, a fire destroyed the Doge's residence which was in the part of the palace overlooking the canal. Architect Antonio Rizzo used the new Renaissance style for the building's architecture. A new building was built alongside the canal, stretching from the ponte della Canonica to the Ponte della Paglia. The official rooms of the government had art works specially made by Vittore Carpaccio, Giorgione, Alvise Vivarini and Giovanni Bellini. A fire in 1547 destroyed some rooms on the second floor. A big fire in 1577 destroyed the Scrutinio Room and the Great Council Chamber. Art work by Gentile da Fabriano, Pisanello, Alvise Vivarini, Vittore Carpaccio, Giovanni Bellini, Pordenone, and Titian were also lost in the fire. The palace was rebuilt in the original gothic style. Some classical features were added, such as the Bridge of Sighs joining the prison to the palace.\nThe palace was the home of the government of the Republic of Venice until the Napoleonic occupation of the city in 1797. Venice was ruled by the French, then Austria, and in 1866 it became part of Italy. During this time, the palace was used for various government offices, the Biblioteca Marciana and other important cultural institutions within the city.\nBy the end of the 19th century, the building was showing clear signs of decay. The Italian government spent a lot of money to repair the building. All public offices were moved elsewhere, except the State Office for the protection of historical Monuments, which is still housed at the palace's loggia floor. In 1923, the municipality of Venice set up the palace as a museum. In 1996, the Doge\u2019s Palace has been part of the Venetian museums network, which is run by the Fondazione Musei Civici di Venezia since 2008.\nThe building.\nOutside.\nThe oldest part of the palace is the facade overlooking the lagoon. The corners of the building have 14th century sculptures by Filippo Calendario, Raverti and Antonio Bregno. The ground floor arcade and the loggia has 14th and 15th century capitals. Some of these are copies made during the 19th century.\nThe Porta della Carta, was the grand entrance to the building. The gateway was built and decorated by Giovanni and Bartolomeo Bon from 1438\u20131442. The name Porta della Carta could be because this was the area where public scribes set up their desks, or from the \"cartabum\", where all the important government documents were kept. On either side of the gateway are two gothic towers, with sculptures of the \"Cardinal Virtues\". On the top is a bust of Saint Mark, and over him is a statue of \"Justice\" with her symbols of sword and scales. In the space above the cornice, there is a sculpture of the Doge Francesco Foscari kneeling before the St. Mark's Lion. This was made in the 19th century by Luigi Ferrrari, to replace the original destroyed in 1797.\nThe public entrance to the Doge's Palace is now through the Porta del Frumento, in the waterfront side of the building.\nThe courtyard.\nThe north side of the courtyard is made by the palace and St. Mark\u2019s Basilica, which used to be the Doge\u2019s chapel. At the center of the courtyard are two well-heads built in the mid-16th century.\nIn 1485 a grand staircase was built within the courtyard. Linked to the Porta della Carta, it created a monumental approach from the Piazza into the heart of the building. Since 1567, the Giants\u2019 Staircase has been guarded by Sansovino\u2019s two huge statues of \"Mars\" and \"Neptune\". These show Venice\u2019s power by land and by sea, and therefore the reason for its name. Members of the Senate gathered before government meetings in the Senator\u2019s Courtyard, to the right of the Giants\u2019 Staircase."}

It was written for four-part choir with orchestra or piano. The words were written by Josef Weyl. It was first performed on 15 February 1867 by the Vienna Men's Singing Society and the orchestra of the Forty-Second Infantry Regiment directed by Rudolph Weinwurm. It was performed without voices on March 4 and again on March 10 in the same format at a benefit for Strauss's brothers. It was a sensation when performed at the Paris Exposition the same year. This performance marked the beginning of Strauss's international reputation. The waltz was published in 1867 by Carl Anton Spina.\nThe piece begins with a slow introduction in the dominant key of A major. This introduction is followed by five small waltzes of two sections each. Melodies with large leaps are contrasted with linear melodies composed within a narrow range. The coda touches on the various melodies and concludes with a lively finish. The waltz was first played in the United States in its instrumental version on 1 July 1867 in New York. It was first played in Great Britain on 21 September 1867 in London at the promenade concerts in Covent Garden. The instrumental version is usually performed today. On New Year's Eve in Vienna, the waltz is broadcast on television and radio stations at midnight. It is an encore piece at the Vienna New Year's Day Concert."}

It is common in some of the most successful groups of animals, such as arthropods, vertebrates and annelid worms. \nSegmentation of the body allows different regions of the body to develop for different uses.\nGenes regulating development.\nWe now know a good deal about how the development of segmented animals is controlled. In a series of experiments with the fruit-fly \"Drosophila\", E.B. Lewis was able to identify a complex of genes whose proteins bind to the regulatory regions of target genes. The latter then activate or repress cell processes which direct the final development of the organism. \nFurthermore, the sequence of these control genes show \"co-linearity\": the order of the loci in the chromosome parallels the order in which the loci are expressed along the anterior-posterior axis of the body. Not only that, but this cluster of master control genes programs the development of all higher organisms. \nEach of the genes contains a homeobox, a remarkably conserved DNA sequence. This suggests the complex itself arose by gene duplication. \nIn his Nobel lecture, Lewis said \"Ultimately, comparisons of the [control complexes] throughout the animal kingdom should provide a picture of how the organisms, as well as the [control genes] have evolved\"."}

It is famous for Fingal's Cave and other examples of basalt columns. No-one lives there.\nThe islands became part of the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles, the \"Su\u00f0reyjar\" kingdom of the Norse. The Norsemen ruled for over 400 years until sovereignty was transferred to Scotland by the Treaty of Perth in 1266. The islands were then held by the Clans MacLeod and MacDonald, but Staffa was not regularly inhabited.\nGeology.\nThis small island is entirely of volcanic origin. It consists of a basement of tuff, underneath colonnades of a black fine-grained Tertiary basalt, overlying which is a third layer of basalt lava. Slow cooling of the second layer of basalt resulted in an extraordinary pattern of hexagonal columns which form the faces and walls of the principal caves. The lava contracted as it cooled and solidified into columns, a process known as columnar jointing.\nThe columns have three to eight sides, six being most common. The columns are also divided horizontally by cross joints. Similar formations are found at the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland, on the island of Ulva and Ardmeanach on the Isle of Mull. The 'Staffa Group' is the name given to the series of olivine basalts found in and around Mull. The volcanic eruptions took place 55\u201358\u00a0million years ago."}

Superfluids are also Bose-Einstein condensates.\nThe only difference is that Bose-Einstein condensates are made up of bosons, and are social with each other (in groups, or clumps). Fermi condensates are anti-social (they don't attract each other at all). This has to be done artificially.\nThis state of matter was made in December 2003 by Deborah Jin and her group. Jin worked for the National Institute of Standards and Technology at the University of Colorado. Her team created this state of matter by cooling a cloud of potassium-40 atoms to less than a millionth\u00b0C over absolute zero (-273.15\u00a0\u00b0C, this is the hypothetical lowest limit of physical temperatures). This is the same temperature required to cool matter to a Bose\u2013Einstein condensate. The process of cooling a gas into a condensate is called condensation.\nDifference between fermions and bosons.\nBosons and fermions are subatomic particles (bits of matter smaller than an atom). The difference between a boson and a fermion is the number of the atom's electrons, neutrons and/or protons. An atom is composed of bosons if it has an even number of electrons. An atom is composed of fermions if it has an odd number of electrons, neutrons and protons. An example of a boson would be a gluon. An example of a fermion would be potassium-40, which is what Deborah Jin used as the gas cloud. Bosons can form clumps and are attracted to each other, whereas fermions do not form clumps. Fermions are usually found in straight strings because they repel each other. This is because fermions obey the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that they cannot gather together in the same quantum state.\nSimilarity to Bose\u2013Einstein condensate.\nLike the Bose\u2013Einstein condensates, fermi condensates will coalesce (grow together into one entity) with the particles that make them up. Bose\u2013Einstein condensates and fermi condensates are also both man-made states of matter. The particles that make these states of matter have to be artificially super-cooled, to have the properties that they do. However, fermi condensates have reached even lower temperatures than Bose\u2013Einstein condensates. Also, both states of matter have no viscosity, which means that they can flow without stopping.\nHelium-3 and fermions.\nCreating a fermi condensate is very difficult. Fermions obey the exclusion principle, and they are not attracted to each other. They repel each other. Jin and her research team found a way to merge them together. They adjusted and applied a magnetic field on the anti-social fermions, so they began losing their properties. The fermions still kept some of their character, but behaved a bit like bosons. Using this, they were able to make separate pairs of fermions merge with each other over and over again. Mrs. Jin suspects that this pairing process is the same in Helium-3, also a superfluid. Based on this information, they can hypothesize (make an educated guess) that fermionic condensates will flow without any viscosity as well.\nSuperconductivity and fermionic condensates.\nAnother related phenomenon is superconductivity. In superconductivity, paired electrons can flow with 0 viscosity. There is quite some interest in superconductivity, as it may be a cheaper and cleaner source of electricity. It could also be used to power levitating trains and hover-cars.\nBut this can only happen if scientists can create or discover materials that are superconductors at room temperature. In fact, a Nobel Prize will be awarded to one who succeeds in making a room temperature superconductor. Right now, the problem is that scientists have to work with superconductors at around -135\u00a0\u00b0C. This involves the use of liquid nitrogen and other methods to make extremely cold temperatures. This is of course a tedious job, which is why scientists prefer to use superconductors at room temperature. Mrs. Jin's team thinks that replacing the paired electrons with the paired fermions would result in a room-temperature superconductor."}

It was built in 1723. Its design was inspired by the works of Christopher Wren. The church is a parish of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts. It is the oldest standing church building in Boston. Inside the church is a bust of George Washington that the Marquis de Lafayette thought the best likeness of Washington he had ever seen.\nThe church is known to most Americans because it was here that a lantern signal was sent by sexton Robert Newman from the church steeple on the evening of April 18, 1775 to warn American patriots that British soldiers were approaching Lexington and Concord by sea and not by land. \"Paul Revere's Ride\", a poem by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, remembers this event. \nThe church steeple was damaged by storms in 1804 and 1954. It was rebuilt. It is now 175 feet (53 m) tall. The original weathervane is on top. There are 1100 bodies buried in the basement. Many of these are patriots who were killed at the Battle of Bunker Hill. Old North Church is a National Historic Landmark. Queen Elizabeth II visited the church in 1976 and was given a silver chalice (a cup) modelled on one made by Paul Revere."}

British code breakers used Colossus for cryptanalysis during World War II.\nThese messages were sent between the German High Command, and army field commanders. Reading these messages helped the Allies to win the war.\nCodebreaker Max Newman worked at the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS) at Bletchley Park. His problem was how to get a machine that would help turn German coded radio teleprinter messages into ordinary language. A group of Post Office telephone engineers led by Tommy Flowers worked out how to do this. Their design, which was called \"Colossus\" used many vacuum tubes (valves). The first machine, Mark 1, worked in December 1943 and solved its first problem in February 1944. Colossus Mark 2 was even better. It first worked on 1 June 1944, just before the Normandy Landings on D-Day. Ten Colossus computers were in use at the end of the war.\nBritish codebreakers called the teleprinter messages \"Fish\". The messages had been coded by an unknown German machine. They called the machine and its coded messages \"Tunny\". Colossus imitated the machine and read the coded message from a punched tape. It tried various possibilities of how two of the wheels had been set up. When Colossus found likely settings for two wheels, the codebreaker designed further programs for Colossus until likely settings of other wheels were found. Colossus did not perform all of the decoding process. It just found likely settings of the machine. The output from Colossus was then worked on by people who had a very good knowledge of the German language.\nAfter the war the British codebreakers found out that the code machine was the Lorenz SZ42. All the secret Colossus computers were taken to pieces, so that no one would find out about them. The designs were destroyed. For thirty years no one knew who made them. Between the early 1990s and 2007, a working copy of a Colossus computer was built. This can be seen at The National Museum of Computing at Bletchley Park in England.\nPurpose and origins.\nRegular radio transmissions of \"Tunny\" messages started in June 1941. The British codebreakers saw that it used a five-unit code like a teleprinter system. Their research also showed that the coding was being done by a rotor cipher machine with 12 wheels (rotors). For each new message sent, the wheels had first to be turned to new positions. The start position for the message was chosen by the operator who was sending the message. He told the operator who was receiving the message what the start positions were with 12 letters that were not coded. The total number of possible start positions of the 12 wheels was very large indeed.\nThe coding machine added together the \"plaintext\" (the un-coded version of the message) and a stream of characters (letters, numbers, punctuation) called the \"keystream\" (a stream of seemingly random characters) that it generated to make the \"ciphertext\" (the coded version of the message). The ciphertext, which made no sense, was transmitted by radio. At the receiving end an identical machine removed the keystream to produce the plaintext of the message.\nIf the German operators always worked correctly, no two messages would have the same start position of the wheels. However, mistakes were made. They helped the British codebreakers. On 30 August 1941 two versions of the same message, which was nearly 4,000 characters long, were sent with the same wheel start positions. This mistake was very useful to the research codebreakers. A codebreaker called John Tiltman was able to get the keystream from these messages.\nThe codebreakers tried to work out the details of the machine from this information, but at first they failed. They were then joined by a young codebreaker called Bill Tutte who was given the job. After a lot of work he succeeded, and produced a logical description of the unseen machine. This work has been described as \"the greatest intellectual achievement of world war II\". Tutte worked out that the machine made each keystream character by combining the effects of two sets of five wheels. He used Greek letters to name the wheels. He called one set of five the \u03c7 (\"chi\") wheels, and the other set of five the \u03c8 (\"psi\") wheels. He worked out that the \u03c7 wheels moved on one position for each new character coded. The \u03c8 wheels, however, did not move regularly. They only moved on some of the time. Whether or not the \u03c8 wheels moved on was controlled by two wheels that he called two the \u03bc (\"mu\") or \"motor wheels\".\nMax Newman was a mathematician and codebreaker at Bletchley Park. He was given the job of working out how a machine could break \"Tunny\" messages. The machine would do a calculation for many possible start positions of the \u03c7 wheels. The start position that gave the largest count from this calculation was likely to be the right one. The first machine was called \"Heath Robinson\". This did not work very well. It had two punched paper tapes that had to work exactly together. One tape contained the ciphertext in a continuous loop. The second looped tape contained patterns made by the wheels of the coding machine. The tapes would often stretch or break when going at 2000 characters each second. Sometimes the tapes would not line up; then the counts were wrong.\nBuilding Colossus.\nTommy Flowers worked at the Post Office Research Station at Dollis Hill in north-west London. He was asked to look at the Heath Robinson machine. He thought it was a weak machine. He designed an electronic machine to do the same job. It would make the patterns of the coding machine by electronics so that only one paper tape was needed. In February 1943 he showed Max Newman this design. The design needed 1,500 thermionic valves (vacuum tubes). Few people thought that so many valves could work without a lot failing. More Heath Robinson machines were ordered. Flowers, however, kept with the idea of an electronic machine. He got support from Gordon Radley, his boss at the Post Office Research Station. Tommy Flowers and his team started work on Colossus in February 1943.\nThe tape with the message on it had to be read rapidly. Tommy Flowers tested the tape reader up to 9,700 letters/second () before the tape broke. He selected 5,000 characters per second as a good speed for regular work. This meant that the paper tape moved at or . The electronic circuits were driven by a signal made from reading the sprocket holes of the punched tape.\nThe first Colossus worked at Dollis Hill in December 1943. Then they took Colossus apart and moved it to Bletchley Park. It got there on 18 January 1944. Harry Fensom and Don Horwood put it back together. Colossus read its first message on the 5th of February. After the first Colossus (Mark 1) there were nine Mark 2 machines. These each had 2,400 valves. They were easier to use. They could be programmed to work at five times the speed of the Mark 1. A Mark 2 Colossus first worked on 1 June 1944.\nAt first Colossus was only used to find the starting wheel places used for a message (called \"wheel setting\"). Codebreakers worked out how to use the Mark 2 to help find the patterns of the cams on the wheels (\"wheel breaking\"). At the end of the war there were ten Colossus computers working at Bletchley Park. This meant that very many messages were decoded.\nDesign and use.\nColossus used parts that were new back then. It used vacuum tubes, thyratrons and photomultipliers. It read from paper with light. It then did a special thing for every letter; the special thing could be changed. It counted how often this special thing was \"true\". Machines with many vacuum tubes were known to break a lot. They break most when turning on, so the Colossus machines were only turned off when a part broke.\nColossus was the first of the electronic digital machines that could have a program. It could not change as much as later machines: \nIt was not a Turing-complete computer, even though Alan Turing was at Bletchley Park. This idea had not yet been thought of, and most of the other early modern computing machines were not Turing-complete (like: the Atanasoff\u2013Berry Computer, the Harvard Mark I electro-mechanical relay machine, the Bell Labs relay machines by George Stibitz and others, or the first plans of Konrad Zuse). It took a long time for computers be used for many uses, instead of just a calculator only for working out one hard problem.\nInfluence and fate.\nWhat the Colossus computers were used for was very secret. The Colossus itself was highly secret even for many years after the War. This is why Colossus could not be included in the history of computing hardware for a long time. Nobody knew how important that Flowers and the other people who helped make it were.\nNot many people knew about this secret computer, so it had little direct effect on the new design of later computers; EDVAC was the early design which had the most effect on later computer design.\nOnce Colossus was made, some people now knew that high-speed electronic (no moving parts like electrical relays) digital computing devices could be made and they did not break too much. Just this knowledge was enough to have a big effect on the designs of early computers in Britain and probably in the US. People that knew about Colossus were important in the early computer field in Britain. In 1972, Herman Goldstine wrote that:\n \nIn writing that, Goldstine did not know of Colossus. He did not know what it left to projects of people who knew about it. People such as Alan Turing (with the Pilot ACE and ACE), and Max Newman and I. J. Good (with the Manchester Mark 1 and other early Manchester computers). Brian Randell later wrote that:\nColossus plans and machinery were secret from the when they were made. They stayed so after the War, when Winston Churchill ordered the destruction of most of the Colossus machines into \"parts no bigger than a man's hand\"; Tommy Flowers himself burned the designs in a fireplace at Dollis Hill. Some parts, changed to look innocent, were taken to Newman's Royal Society Computing Machine Laboratory at Manchester University. The Colossus Mark 1 was taken apart and the parts were sent back to the Post Office. Two Colossus computers, along with two copied Tunny machines, were kept. They were moved to GCHQ's new head office at Eastcote in April 1946. They moved again with GCHQ to Cheltenham between 1952 and 1954. One of the computers, known as \"Colossus Blue\", was taken apart in 1959; the other in 1960. In their later years, the computers were used for training. Before that, there had been attempts to change them (sometimes well) for other purposes. Jack Good was the first to use it after the war, getting NSA to use Colossus to do something for which they were planning to build a special purpose machine. Colossus was also used to perform letter counts on one-time pad tape to test for non-randomness.\nAt this time the Colossus was still secret, long after any of its technical details were of any importance. This was due to the UK's intelligence agencies use of Enigma-like machines which they got other governments to buy. The agencies then broke the codes using different ways. Had the knowledge of the codebreaking machines been widely known, no one would have accepted these machines; rather, they would have developed their own methods for encryption, methods that the UK services might not have been able to break. The need for such secrets slowly went away as communications moved to digital transmission and all-digital encryption systems became common in the 1960s.\nColonel Winterbotham's book \"The Ultra Secret\" came out in 1975. This broke the secrecy around the Colossus. After that, details about the computer began to become public in the late 1970s.\nA 500-page technical report on the Tunny cipher and its code breaking \u2013 entitled \"General Report on Tunny\" \u2013 was given by GCHQ to the national Public Record Office in October 2000; the complete technical report is online.\nMaking it again.\nA team led by Tony Sale built a working copy of a Colossus Mark 2. The plans and machines had been destroyed, but a surprising amount of other material was not destroyed. It was mostly in engineers' notebooks, much of it in the U.S. The optical tape reader might have been the biggest problem, but Dr. Arnold Lynch, its designer, was able to redesign it from his own first writings. The rebuilt Colossus is on show at The National Museum of Computing, in H Block Bletchley Park in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire. This is where the Colossus No. 9 was used in the war.\nIn November 2007, to mark both the end of the work and the start of fundraising (asking for money) they ran a competition. The money would help The National Museum of Computing with a Cipher Competition where the rebuilt Colossus competed with radio amateurs all around the world. The first to hear and decode three messages enciphered would win. They would be enciphered using the Lorenz SZ42 and transmitted from the radio station in the \"Heinz Nixdorf MuseumsForum\" computer museum in Germany. The competition was easily won by radio amateur Joachim Sch\u00fcth. Sch\u00fcth had gotten ready for the event. He made his own signal processing and code-breaking program using Ada. The Colossus team lost because they wanted to use World War II radios. They were a day late because of bad radio conditions. The winner's 1.4\u00a0GHz laptop, running his own program, took less than a minute to find the settings for all 12 wheels. The German codebreaker said: \"My laptop worked on ciphertext at a speed of 1.2\u00a0million letters per second\u2014240x faster than Colossus. If you compare the two computers, you could say Colossus had a speed of 5.8\u00a0MHz. That is very fast for a computer built in 1944.\""}

Special skills are often needed to fully perceive or understand the sublime. \nAs a category in aesthetics, the main property is that its beauty is bigger that something that is merely beautiful. Sometimes, the sublime may be sacred and causes awe.\nIt is only western philosophy that makes a distinction between the beautiful and the sublime; there is no such distinction in eastern philosophy.The first known work in philiosphy treating the sublime is called \"On the Sublime\", and was written by an otherwise unknown writer who lived in the first or third century. This writer is often called Longinus. Longinus was a teacher of rhetoric, and used the sublime to describe great language in this context. According to Longinus, the sublime inspires awe and veneration, with greater persuasive powers. Nicolas Boileau-Despr\u00e9aux translated this work into French, in the 16th century; in the 18th century the text was translated into English as well.\nPhilosophers who wrote about the sublime include Edmund Burke, Immanuel Kant, Arthur Schopenhauer, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Theodor W.

It was first published in 1855. The poem was loosely based on the legends of Native American peoples. In 1857, Longfellow estimated that the work had sold 50,000 copies. \n\"The Song\" is about Hiawatha and his beloved Minnehaha. It is set along the south shore of Lake Superior. The poem was very popular, but critics did not like it. \nComposers and painters were inspired to create works based on the poem. A 2005 television movie was based on the poem.\nStory.\nHiawatha's birth is foretold by a \"mighty\" peace-bringing leader named Gitche Manito. A woman named Nokomis falls from the moon. Nokomis gives birth to Wenonah. She grows to be a beautiful young woman. Nokomis warns her not to be seduced by the West Wind. She does not listen to her mother, and Hiawatha is born. \nHiawatha has childhood adventures, falls in love with Minnehaha, slays the evil magician Pearl-Feather, invents written language, discovers corn, and other episodes. The poem closes with the approach of a canoe to Hiawatha's village. It contains \"the Priest of Prayer, the Pale-face.\" Hiawatha welcomes him with joy. \nThe \"Black-Robe chief\" brings word of Jesus Christ. Hiawatha and the chiefs accept the Christian message. Hiawatha says good-bye to Nokomis, the warriors, and the young men. He says, \"But my guests I leave behind me / Listen to their words of wisdom, / Listen to the truth they tell you.\" He endorses the Christian missionaries. He launches his canoe for the last time westward toward the sunset. Then he departs forever."}

This theory is the opposite of the theory called the blank slate, or \"tabula rasa\". Blank slate theories said that humans have almost no skills or abilities at birth: they learn these skills over the course of their life. People who believe in nativism (within certain limits) include Jerry Fodor, Noam Chomsky and Steven Pinker. These psychologists believe that humans are born with a set of abilities that help them learn other skills, such as speech.\nSome mammals do seem to inherit emotional reactions. Monkeys fearing snakes is an example. Most of the behaviour of insects, reptiles and birds is inherited in some detail. Mammals, however, show a greater ability for learning than other kinds of animals.\nCharles Darwin, in \"The expression of emotions in man and animals\" (1872), showed that the way most emotions were shown was common between human cultures. He said this was inherited and had been the result of evolution. Behaviorism says that man's behaviour is affected by its results (operant conditioning). Behaviourists denied the importance of inherited behaviours, instincts, or an inherited tendency to behave. People who believe in evolutionary psychology think this is wrong. They think human behaviour has deep roots in our evolutionary past."}

Used in the right way, the word refers to a tube in an upside-down U shape. The tube makes liquid flow up hill. It flows higher than the source of the liquid, to come out at a level lower than the surface of the source. The movement is done without pumps. It is powered by the fall of the liquid as it flows down the tube under the pull of gravity.\nThe syphon must touch the liquid in the (upper) reservoir (the source, where the liquid comes from) in order for it to work. This allows atmospheric pressure to push the liquid up the tube. The top of the tube is where the lowest pressure is, so the liquid will move towards that area in the same way as a barometer. The top of a syphon is the same as the height of a barometer, because they work in the same way. The lower pressure is caused by the liquid falling on the downhill side. A syphon can raise water to a height of 25 feet above the source elevation. New discoveries in Syphon Pump Metering allows for dispensing liquid above the source. United States Patent #5,358,000 was the first to teach this method.\nA siphon can be used for irrigation purposes. \nWhen both ends of a syphon are at atmospheric pressure (equal pressure), liquid flows from high to low. However, if the lower end is pressurised, liquid can flow from low to high. Most syphons have water as a fluid. Other fluids, such as mercury, or organic liquids or even gasses like carbon dioxide can also be syphoned."}

The DSM is a manual written by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). They are numbered using Roman numerals: DSM-I, DSM-II, DSM-III, DSM-IV, but the latest edition adopted Arabic numerals allowing subsequent editions to be numbered, 5.1, 5.2 and so on. After the DSM-IV was published, some changes (or revisions) were made to the descriptions in the manual. Because of this, the most recent version of the DSM-IV is officially called the DSM-IV-TR (the TR stands for \"Text Revision\").\nThe DSM lists every condition that is officially called a mental illness by the APA. The DSM organizes these conditions into different categories. Each condition is given a code, made up of numbers or a combination of numbers and letters. Along with the condition's name and code, the DSM also gives other information, like:\nThe conditions that are listed in the DSM have changed over time. In each new version of the DSM, the APA adds conditions that it has accepted as mental illnesses since the last version was published. It may also take out conditions that are no longer thought of as mental illnesses. (For example, homosexuality was listed as a mental illness in the earlier DSMs, but was then taken out.) The APA may also change the way it describes certain conditions.\nMulti-axial system.\nWhen a person gets a DSM diagnosis, there are five different \"axes\", or categories of information that need to be included.\nAxis I: This is where most mental health conditions are listed. Both the name of the condition and its assigned code need to be listed. For example, types of ADHD, depression, anxiety disorders would be listed here. A person can have just one Axis I diagnosis, or more than one.\nAxis II: If the person has mental retardation (intellectual disability, autism) or a personality disorder, it is listed here.\nAxis III: If the person has medical conditions, they are listed here.\nAxis IV: This axis records whether the person has certain kinds of \"psychosocial stressors.\" There are few set categories of psychosocial stressors: Primary support problems (for example, family conflict); social environment problems (for example, the person has poor social skills and few friends); economic problems (like poverty or job loss); housing problems (like poor housing or homelessness); educational problems (like school failure); problems with access to healthcare services; and \"other\" stressors.\nAxis V: For this axis, a mental health professional will pick a number that sums up how much the person is affected by his mental health problems, and how well he is functioning in his life. The professional uses a scale called the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF), which explains what different numbers mean. A person's score is called his \"GAF score.\"\nThere are a few benefits to the DSM's multi-axial system. The five axes sum up all of the information that is most important to mental health professionals when they are treating a person. They give a snapshot of the most important things that affect a person's mental health. A full DSM diagnosis is also like a common language to mental health professionals. Even if there are different professionals, who come from different specialties or even speak different languages, they will all understand the DSM diagnosis.\nOrganization.\nThe conditions in the DSM are organized into categories. These categories are:\n(1) \"Disorders Usually Diagnosed in Infancy, Childhood, and Adolescence\". For example: types of ADHD; mental retardation; autism spectrum disorders; and Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD).\n(2) \"Delirium, Dementia, Amnestic, and Other Cognitive Disorders.\" These disorders cause problems with thinking and memory.\n(3) \"Mental Disorders Due to a General Medical Condition Not Otherwise Classified.\" These are disorders which are caused by a medical problem.\n(4) \"Substance-Related Disorders.\" These are conditions which have to do with use, abuse, or addiction to illegal drugs, alcohol, or other substances (like caffeine and nicotine). This category also includes conditions caused by withdrawal from these substances.\n(5) \"Schizophrenia and Other Psychotic Disorders.\" These include all of the different types of schizophrenia, and other disorders that cause psychosis (being out of touch with reality).\n(6) \"Mood Disorders\". These include the different kinds of bipolar disorder and depression.\n(7) \"Anxiety Disorders.\" For example: Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD); Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD); Generalized Anxiety Disorder.\n(8) \"Somatiform Disorders.\" People with these disorders have a lot of physical symptoms, like pain or stomach problems. However, these symptoms are not thought to be caused by an actual medical disorder. They are thought to be caused by mental health problems instead. One example is hypochondriasis, where a person is always worried that they have serious medical problems when they do not. Another condition in this category is Body Dysmorphic Disorder, where a person hates his body, or a part of his body.\n(9) \"Factitious Disorders.\" People with these disorders exaggerate or make up medical problems. They may do this because it gets them things they want (for example, attention and sympathy).\n(10) \"Dissociative Disorders.\" These disorders cause a person to have problems with memory, awareness, and perceiving (seeing and understanding) things correctly. The person may also feel disconnected from his identity (his view of himself and who he is). The best-known condition in this category is Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) (which used to be called \"Multiple Personality Disorder).\n(11) \"Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders.\" Sexual disorders include paraphilias, where a person is sexually attracted to objects or to kinds of sexual activity that are not normal. For example, pedophilia (being sexually attracted to children) is a type of paraphilia. Another type of sexual disorder is sexual dysfunction (problems with performing sexually). This category also includes Gender Identity Disorder, where a person feels like one gender, but has the body of another gender.\n(12) \"Eating Disorders.\" The two major types of eating disorders are anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.\n(13) \"Sleep Disorders.\" For example: insomnia.\n(14) \"Impulse Control Disorders Not Otherwise Specified.\" These are disorders where people have trouble controlling their urges to do things. For example: trichotillomania (where a person pulls hair out of his body) and Intermittent Explosive Disorder (where a person has sudden explosions of anger).\n(15) \"Adjustment Disorders.\" With these disorders, a person is having trouble adjusting to, or getting used to, something stressful in his life.\n(16) \"Personality Disorders\". These diagnoses can only be given to adults. For example: Antisocial Personality Disorder; Borderline Personality Disorder."}

They call their mother Marmee. The story is set during the American Civil War. Their father is serving as a chaplain in the Union Army. Each sister has a flaw. Amy is selfish, Beth is shy, Meg is vain, and Jo is outspoken and tomboy-ish.

The Greek Revival main house was built in 1833 by James Innes Thornton. Thornhill was a cotton plantation in the early 1830s. It extended over 2,600 acres. By 1860, there were 156 slaves working on the plantation. About a third of the slaves lived in quarters behind the main house. William Nichols is believed to be the architect. The house measures 55 feet wide. Inside is a 14 ft wide by 40 ft long central hall. There is a spiral staircase at the back. There are two rooms to either side. The left front room was the parlor. The dining room was behind it. On the front right was the master bedroom. The plantation office was behind it. Upstairs is a matching hall and four bedrooms. All eight rooms are 19.5 feet square. The downstairs rooms have 12-foot ceilings. The upstairs ceilings are 11 feet. There was once a brick kitchen behind the house. It later burned. Additions were made to the original house from 1890 to 1949. They were razed in 1994 and rebuilt to better match the original intent. The two-story portico with six Ionic columns was added about 1850. The plantation schoolhouse was constructed about 1845. The Thornton children and neighboring plantation children were taught there. Surrounding the schoolhouse are 230-year-old post oaks. The house was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 10, 1984."}

She was born at Germantown, Pennsylvania to Amos Bronson Alcott, a controversial educator.\nIn 1834, the Alcott family moved to Massachusetts, finally settling at Concord. Family friends in the area included Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, and Nathaniel Hawthorne. \nEarly Years.\nLouisa May Alcott was born on November 29, 1832,\u00a0in part of\u00a0Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She was the daughter of a\u00a0teacher. He and his wife helped children. Louisa was the\u00a0second of four daughters. The family moved to Boston in 1834,\u00a0where Alcott's father started a school and was friends\u00a0with\u00a0Ralph Waldo Emerson\u00a0and\u00a0Henry David Thoreau. Louisa's father's opinions on education and hard views on teaching children shaped young Alcott's mind with a desire to do well in life. In 1840, after the school ended, the Alcott family moved to a small house on land next to a river in\u00a0Concord, Massachusetts. They were happy there.[4]\u00a0By 1843, the Alcott family moved with some friends\u00a0to the\u00a0an area where everyone believed in the same thing from 1843\u20131844. Louisa's mom had a lot of money and with some help from Ralph Waldo Emerson, they bought land in\u00a0Concord, Massachusetts. They moved to a house on April 1, 1845. Louisa went to work at an early age. She taught, sewed, and did chores in houses. In 1848, her first book, \"Flower Fables\", was published.\nLouisa was taught by Henry David Thoreau and her father. Her father was really hard and taught her to not think about herself. She was also taught by important people like Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne. They were friends of her family. She wrote for a paper that tells everyone what is going on.\nIn 1847, she and her family helped on the\u00a0Underground Railroad, when they allowed a runaway \u00a0slave to stay in their house for one week.\u00a0Alcott believed that women should be treated better and became the first woman allowed to vote in\u00a0Concord, Massachusetts.\u00a0The 1850s were hard times for the Alcotts. At one point in 1857, Alcott was so sad that she thought about killing herself. Later that year, she learned about Charlotte Bront\u00eb\u00a0and felt better. She was not longer close to her sisters because they died or got married.\nWriting.\nShe wrote many sensational stories and passionate novels such as \"A Long Fatal Love Chase\". She also wrote stories for children. The critics liked these children's stories. She began writing only for children. In 1868, \"Little Women\" was published. It was a great success. After \"Little Women\", Alcott wrote \"Little Men\" in 1871 and \"Jo's Boys\" in 1886. These books were about four fictional sisters: Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy March. The books were based on Alcott's childhood experiences with her own three sisters. The character of Jo was based on Alcott herself. Other children's books by Alcott include \"Eight Cousins\", \"Rose in Bloom\", \"Under the Lilacs\", and \"\".\nAlcott supported the rights of women and slaves in America. In 1860, Alcott wrote for a newspaper. When the American Civil War began, she worked as a nurse in a hospital at Georgetown, D.C., for six weeks in 1862\u20131863. She wanted to serve three months as a nurse, but she got typhoid and got ill, but she did get better. Her letters to her home were put in popular newspapers and books (1863, republished with additions in 1869). These letters gave her fame, and people liked her observations and humor. She wrote about the bad care of hospitals by some doctors. Many people liked her stories and became fans of her writing.\nAfter the American Civil War, Alcott wrote fun and smart books under the name A. M. Barnard. One of her books was \"A Long Fatal Love Chase\". Her protagonists for these books were strong and smart. She also wrote books for children, and when they became popular, she did not go back to writing for adults. Other books she wrote are the novelette A Modern Mephistopheles (1875), which people thought someone else wrote; and the \"Work\" (1873). \nAlcott became very famous with her book \"Little Women: or Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy\" (1868), a story of her childhood with her sisters in Massachusetts. Part two, or \"Part Second\", also known as \"Good Wives\" (1869), followed the characters into adulthood and marriage. \"Little Men\" (1871) talked about Jo's life at the Plumfield School that she started with her husband Professor Bhaer at the end of Part Two of \"Little Women\". \"Jo's Boys\" (1886) completed the \"March Family Saga\". In \"Little Women\", Alcott based her character \"Jo\" on herself. But Jo marries at the end of the story, and Alcott never got married. She said, \"I am more than half-persuaded that I am a man's soul put by some freak of nature into a woman's body ... because I have fallen in love with so many pretty girls and never once the least bit with any man.\" Every character in \"Little Women\" is like a person in Alcott's own life. \n\"Little Women\" was liked by a lot of people of different ages. A reviewer of \"Eclectic Magazine\" called it \"the very best of books to reach the hearts of the young of any age from six to sixty\". People also liked the book because it was like their own lives. \nPersonal life.\nAfter three years after the Civil War started, Alcott got a job in a hospital in District of Columbia. She worked for six weeks between 1861 and 1862. When Alcott stayed in hospital, she got typhoid. She had to spend a long time in bed, which affected her health..\nAlcott died of a stroke at age 55 in Boston, Massachusetts on March 6, 1888. She and her earliest biographers"}

He is one of the most important Knights of the Round Table. His parents are Arthur's sister Anna and King Lot. He is the main character of \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\", a medieval fantasy poem. He is said to be Arthur's nephew. He appears very early on in the legend and has been mentioned in very early Welsh sord in wales.\nHe is one of a select number of Round Table members to be referred to as one of the greatest knights, most notably in \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\", well know also like with the nickname \"First knight\". He is almost always portrayed as the son of Arthur's sister Morgause (or Anna) and King Lot of Orkney and Lothian, and his brothers are Agravain, Gaheris, Gareth, and Mordred. He was well known to be the most trustworthy friend of Sir Lancelot. In some works, Sir Gawain has sisters as well.\nGawain is often portrayed as a formidable, courteous, and also a compassionate warrior, fiercely loyal to his king and family. He is a friend to young knights, a defender of the poor, and as \"the Maidens' Knight\", a defender of women as well. In some works, his strength waxes and wanes with the sun; in the most common form of this motif, his might triples by noon, but fades as the sun sets. His knowledge of herbs makes him a great healer, and he is credited with at least three children: Florence, Lovell, and Gingalain, the last of which is also called Libeaus Desconus or Le Bel Inconnu, the Fair Unknown. Gawain appears in English, French and Celtic literature as well as in Italy where he appears in the architecture of the north portal in the cathedral of Modena, constructed in 1184.\nName Gawain (Gauvain).\nGawain is also called \"Gauvain\",\"Gualguanus\", \"Gwalchmei\", \"Walwein\", etc. is King Arthur's nephew and a Knight of the Round Table in the Arthurian legend. Under the name \"Gwalchmei\", he appears very early in the legend's development: he is mentioned in some of the earliest Welsh Arthurian sources.\nGawain is known by different names and variants in different languages. The character corresponds to the Welsh \"Gwalchmei ap Gwyar\", and is known in Latin as \"Walwen\", \"Gualguanus\", \"Waluanus\", etc.; in French as \"Gauvain\"; and in English as Gawain. The later forms are generally assumed to derive from the Welsh \"Gwalchmei\". The element \"Gwalch\" means hawk, and is a typical epithet in medieval Welsh poetry. The meaning of \"mei\" is uncertain. It has been suggested that it refers to the month of May (\"Mai\" in Modern Welsh), rendering \"Hawk of May\", though scholar Rachel Bromwich considers this unlikely. Kenneth Jackson suggests the name evolved from an early Common Brittonic name *\"Ualcos Magesos\", meaning \"Hawk of the Plain\".\nNot all scholars accept the \"gwalch\" derivation. Celticist John Koch suggests the name could be derived from a Brythonic original \"*Wolcos Magesos\", \"Wolf/Errant Warrior of the Plain.\" Others argue that the continental forms do not ultimately derive from \"Gwalchmei\". Medievalist Roger Sherman Loomis suggests a derivation from the epithet \"Gwallt Avwyn\", found in the list of heroes in \"Culhwch and Olwen\", which he translates as \"hair like reins\" or \"bright hair\". Dutch scholar Lauran Toorians proposes that the Dutch name Walewein (attested in Flanders and Northern France c. 1100) was earliest, suggesting it entered Britain during the large settlement of Flemings in Wales in the early 12th century. However, most scholarship supports a derivation from Gwalchmei, variants of which are well attested in Wales and Britain. Scholars such as Bromwich, Joseph Loth, and Heinrich Zimmer trace the etymology of the continental versions to a corruption of the Breton form of the name, \"Walcmoei\"."}

He created the character of Natty Bumpo, the archetypal American frontiersman.\nEarly life.\nCooper was born on September 15, 1789 in Burlington, New Jersey. His father was a United States Congressman. James Fenimore was one year old when his family moved to Cooperstown, New York. The community was started by his father. \nCooper was 13 when he began attending Yale University. He was kicked out for playing pranks. He blew up another student's door. He also taught a donkey to sit in a professor's chair.\nNaval career and marriage.\nCooper got a job as a seaman on a merchant ship. He joined the United States Navy at age 18. He became a midshipman, but left the Navy in 1811. \nCooper married Susan DeLancey when he was 21. They had seven children. Five lived to be adults. The first-born survivor, Susan Fenimore Cooper, became a writer and naturalist.\nWriting career.\n\"Precaution\" was Cooper's first book. It was published anonymously in 1820. In 1823, he published \"The Pioneers\". This book was the first of the Leatherstocking novels. These stories became famous for the fictional character of an American woodsman called Natty Bumppo. Cooper's most famous novel \"Last of the Mohicans\" was published in 1826. It became one of the most widely read American novels of the 19th century.\nIn 1826, Cooper moved his family to Europe. He wanted to make more money as an author. He also wanted to give his children a better education. He continued to write. His books published in Paris include \"The Red Rover\" and \"The Water Witch\". These were novels about the sea. His books began taking a political angle. These books are forgotten today. He returned to the United States in 1833. \nLast years.\nCooper moved back to his ancestral home Otsego Hall in Cooperstown. His writing continued in a political vein. His readers did not like this. He returned to fiction books with \"The Pathfinder\" and \"The Deerslayer\". These books continued the story of Natty Bumppo. Cooper spent his last years in Cooperstown. He died on September 14, 1851. "}

It was the largest private home in central New York for a long time.\nIn June 1834 James Fenimore Cooper decided to reopen the Hall. He had lived in other places for almost sixteen years. The Hall had been closed for a long time. It was falling into decay. Repairs were begun at once, and the Hall was quickly restored. At first, James spent his winters in New York City and his summers in Cooperstown. Eventually he made Otsego Hall his forever home. The Hall burned down a few years after he died.

The force may be a weak physical force, or weak chemical bonds, but strong enough to keep the layer of molecules stuck on. Supplying more heat usually breaks the bonds and causes the adsorbed molecules to evaporate. Only \"free water\" (that is not trapped inside solid particles) can evaporate."}

{"id": "330381", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=330381", "title": "Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania", "text": "The Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania is the main legal body used around the world by Jehovah's Witnesses to organize the religion and also to decide on its official list of beliefs. Members of Jehovah's Witnesses usually call it just as \"the Society\". Its headquarters are in Brooklyn, New York in the United States and its rules allow only between 300 and 500 members. All of them must be \"mature, active and faithful\" male Jehovah's Witnesses.\nA preacher, Charles Taze Russell, started the organization in 1881 as \"Zion's Watch Tower Tract Society\", so he could share religious pamphlets with people. In 1896, its name was changed to \"Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society\". When Russell died in 1916, a fight started between some of the society's directors and the man who took his place, Joseph Franklin Rutherford. The fight became very bitter and many of the people who had followed Russell, who were called International Bible Students, left and started other religious groups. But Rutherford stayed as president of the society and in 1931 the Bible Student groups around the world changed their name to Jehovah's witnesses. In 1955, the corporation changed its name again to \"Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania\". From 1976, the Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses began to control all the decisions and the work of the Watch Tower Society.\nHistory.\nZion's Watch Tower Tract Society was started in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on February 16, 1881 to organize the printing and sharing of pamphlets written about God and the Bible. William Henry Conley, a Pittsburgh businessman, was its first president and Russell was its secretary-treasurer. Its main publication was \"Zion's Watch Tower and Herald of Christ's Presence\", a Bible-based magazine first published in 1879 by Russell. On December 15, 1884, the society became officially registered and Russell was listed as its president. Russell wrote its charter, or statement of its purpose, and explained that it was for \"the mental, moral and religious improvement of men and women, by teaching the Bible by means of the publication and distribution of Bibles, books, papers, pamphlets and other Bible literature, and by providing oral lectures free for the people\". \nAnyone who gave $10 or more to the society was told they were a member of the society and could vote at its meetings, but Russell explained that all the decisions about what the society did would still be made by only two people\u2014him and his wife Maria, who owned most of the shares. In his magazine, Russell explained that the Watch Tower Society was not a \"religious society\", but just a business organization with no set of official beliefs.\nIn 1900 the society opened its first overseas branch office in Britain. Another one opened in Germany in 1903 and then in Australia in 1904. In 1909 the society bought some property in Brooklyn and then moved its headquarters and staff there.\nAfter Russell died in 1916, the Watch Tower Society's lawyer, Joseph Franklin Rutherford, was elected as its next president. But within a few months most of the seven board of directors complained that he was behaving like a dictator and not sharing information. A major fight broke out, and Rutherford told the four directors who criticised him that they were no longer on the board. In June\u00a01917, the society published a book called \"The Finished Mystery\" and said it was the last of a series of Bible study books by Russell. The book made some very strong statements about the leaders of Catholic and Protestant churches and said they were wrong for taking part in the Great War. As a result, the Watch Tower Society's president and directors were jailed as traitors under the \"1917 Espionage Act\", although they were later allowed to leave jail and the government dropped the charges.\nUntil that time each congregation of Bible Students in the world made its own decisions, although they all studied Russell's books and followed his teachings. But Rutherford decided they should all have exactly the same set of beliefs and run their congregations the same way. He told them they had to obey what the Watch Tower Society's New York headquarters told them. A director was put into each congregation, and a year later all members were told to write out a report each week of what public preaching they had done. At an international meeting held at Cedar Point, Ohio, in September\u00a01922, Rutherford began teaching that the Bible Students' most important job was to teach people about the Bible by visiting them at their homes. Watch Tower Society books began using the name \"Jehovah\" much more often when writing about God, and in 1931 Rutherford decided the religion would be called Jehovah's witnesses.\nWhen Rutherford died in 1942, Nathan H. Knorr became the new president. Two years later he changed the words in the charter, or society's rules, to say that its main purposes were to preach about God's kingdom to people in all countries, and print and share Bibles and other books and magazines that would help them learn about that. The rules about who could be a member of the society were also changed, making it open only to a maximum of 500 men who would be chosen by the leaders of the society. Knorr died in 1977 and since then the presidents have been Frederick W. Franz, Milton G. Henschel and Don A. Adams.\nWhat it does.\nThe Watch Tower Society is a major publisher of religious books, magazines and Bibles. By 1979, it had 39 printing branches worldwide. In 1990 it was reported that in one year the society printed 696 million copies of its magazines, \"The Watchtower\" and \"Awake!\" as well as another 35,811,000 pieces of literature worldwide, which are offered door-to-door by Jehovah's Witnesses. In 2012, the Society said it prints more than 41 million copies of each magazine each month.\nThe society has about 20,000 workers at its New York headquarters and branch offices around the world, and says its staff are volunteers rather than employees. Workers receive a small monthly wage with meals and accommodation provided by the society. The \"Bethel family\" in the Brooklyn headquarters includes hairdressers, dentists, doctors, housekeepers and carpenters, as well as shops for repairing personal appliances, watches, shoes and clothing without charge for labor.\nThe society does not give any financial figures to the public, but it said in 2011 that it had spent more than $173 million that year to care for full-time preachers and traveling overseers. Most of its money comes from donations given by people when they take magazines, and most of that is used on its preaching work."}

Main St., New Iberia, Louisiana. It was built in 1833-34. Original owners David and Mary Weeks were rich growers of sugarcane. They owned four plantations. The house is Greek Revival in style. A portico of eight columns supports a second floor verandah. The house is made of bricks. The interior was originally furnished with Federal-style and Empire-style furniture imported from the East Coast. The house was built on the edge of one of Weeks's sugarcane plantations. It was designed for social life and entertaining. The house was said to be the third brick house built on Bayou Teche.\nA series of tragedies struck the Weeks family following the completion of the house. David Weeks died in August 1834. His wife married John Moore. The household was dependent on slavery. Mary and John supported secession. During the American Civil War, Federal troops occupied the property. Union officers lived in the house. Mary Weeks died in December 1863. The house was still being used by Union troops. He son restored some of the family fortune during the Reconstruction years. Succeeding generations however were forced to sell much of the property to meet living expenses.\nDavid and Mary Weeks's great-grandson, William Weeks Hall, lived in the house from 1922 until his death in 1958. He tried to preserve what remained of the property. He made a large garden of live oak, bamboo, camellias, azaleas, and other plants. He donated the house and garden to the National Trust for Historic Preservation at his death. The Trust has owned and operated Shadows until the present. Shadows-on-the-Teche was named a National Historic Landmark on 30 May 1974. "}

As with other commodities, scarcity caused the price of slaves to rise, so more slaves meant more money for their owners. Pregnancy was encouraged. Many slave masters mated with their own slaves to make more slave children. It produced mulatto children.\nHistory.\nFor some states such as Virginia and North Carolina it was an export industry; they sold slaves to places where the price was higher, such as Alabama and Arkansas. Slave breeders favored woman slaves who could have large numbers of children. As with other livestock, breeders tried to improve the health and productivity of slaves. Breeders were approved in slave states because slaves were considered to be less than human, thus had no human rights. They were livestock, like horses or dogs. "}

It was recorded by the Historic American Buildings Survey in March 1936.\nHistory.\nGreensboro became prosperous as part of the cotton boom of the mid-19th century. In 1850 William Murphy, a lawyer and legislator, sold a prime lot to David F. McCrary, a prominent cotton broker and planter. McCrary had originally come from North Carolina. He married Elizabeth Cowan Lowry, daughter of a prominent Alabama family. McCrary had Murphy\u2019s house removed. He hired the architect B. F. Parsons to design a new mansion. The house was completed in about 1855. The \"Alabama Beacon\" reported that the house cost $10,000. It was a very large sum at the time.\nMcCrary\u2019s finances survived the American Civil War. He opened the Greensboro Bank and Exchange in 1871. His only living child and her husband inherited the property when MCCrary died in 1888. Their son and his wife bought the house from siblings in the 1920s. It stayed in the family until 1970. It was sold to Mr. and Mrs. M. D. Baines. The house was sold again in 2011.\nArchitecture.\nA detailed, twelve-page building contract for Magnolia Hall still exists. It calls for porticos, north and south, each with six fluted columns, of the \"Grecian Ionic Order ... the Entablature and Mouldings all to harmonize with it ... and proportioned after the order.\" There are double balconies of delicate iron grill work. There are colored glass transoms around the doors. Inside are large four over four rooms, 14 foot ceilings, chandelier medallions, and a grand mahogany-railed staircase in the hallway. W. E. Yerby in his \"History of Greensboro\" wrote that Magnolia Hall \"is indisputably one of the finest antebellum mansions in Alabama ... [and] a perfect example of late Greek Revival architecture.\""}

It is in the Northern Territory, south-west of Alice Springs. The park surrounds the two huge rock formations after which it is named: Ulu\u1e5fu (Ayers Rock) and Kata Tju\u1e6fa (The Olgas).\nHistory.\nCreation myths.\nArchaeological work near Ulu\u1e5fu has shown that people have been in the area for at least 22,000 years. They probably moved in and out of the area depending on how much food and water there was. People started to live in the area year-round about 10,000 years ago. The native A\u1e49angu people were hunter-gatherers. They lived in small nomadic groups. Groupings were based on water and food supply in their area (\"ngura\").\nThe A\u1e49angu believe that Ulu\u1e5fu and Kata Tju\u1e6fa were created by ancestral spirits (\"tjukuritja\" or \"waparitja\"). This is part of their creation story, known as \"tjukurpa\" (the \"Dreamtime\"). According to the legend, the world was once blank and featureless, until there came creator beings. They travelled across the land and created rocks, rivers, trees\u2013all living things and the landscape as it is seen today.\nThe A\u1e49angu believe that these spirits still live within the land. Each set of rocks represents a different ancestral spirit. The A\u1e49angu communicate (listen and feel) with the spirits by touching the rock. They do this for blessings or guidance with something. It is said that many spirits, like \"ka\u1e3baya\" (emu), \"liru\" (poisonous snake), \"lungka\u1e6fa\" (lizard) and \"luu\u1e49pa\" (kingfisher), travel around the park. Other spirits only stay in one area, like \"kuniya\", a python who lives in the rocks at Ulu\u1e5fu. The great snake king called \"wanambi\" is said to live at the top of Kata Tju\u1e6fa.\nThere are different stories about the origin of Ulu\u1e5fu. One says that it came after a great battle between ancestral spirits. The story tells that after many spirits were killed, the earth rose up in sadness, becoming Ulu\u1e5fu. Another legend tells that the two serpent spirits \"kuniya\" and \"liru\" fought many wars there, putting the cracks and scars in the rock. Kata Tju\u1e6fa is said to give knowledge that is considered very powerful and dangerous. It is only allowed to be known by men who have gone through initiation. So stories about the creation of this rock are a secret. The common idea behind all these creation stories is that places like Ulu\u1e5fu are physical evidence of the activities of ancestral beings.\nA\u1e49angu believe they are directly descended from these ancestral beings. They believe that their ancestors live within the land. Many places around the park are sacred because of this. They are bonded to the land in a kind of kinship, because the main principle of \"tjukurpa\" is that people and the land are connected. \"Tjukurpa\" is an oral tradition (not written down). It makes up the A\u1e49angu belief system, moral code and legal code. It is passed on through story, song, dance and art.\nArrival of the English people.\nEuropeans came to the Western Desert of Australia in the 1870s. They came in expeditions while the Overland Telegraph Line was being made. The first European explorer to the area was Ernest Giles. In 1872, Giles spotted Kata Tju\u1e6fa from Kings Canyon and called it \"Mount Olga\", in honour of Queen Olga of W\u00fcrttemberg. He was not able to reach it, though, because his path was blocked by Lake Amadeus. The next year, another explorer named William Gosse reached Ulu\u1e5fu and named it \"Ayers Rock\" after Sir Henry Ayers. More people explored the area over the next few years, to look for land they could use for raising livestock. They eventually left because the land was too dry. The native A\u1e49angu people had not had much contact with these explorers, and very few white people visited the area after this.\nIn March 1920, the area was made an aboriginal reserve, called the Petermann Reserve. It was meant to be a temporary refuge (safe place) for the A\u1e49angu. The government said they could continue their nomadic lifestyle there until they could be assimilated into white society. During the 1930s, there became more and more encounters between the natives and white people. Trading with dingo hunters (called \"doggers\") brought the natives food, tools and clothes they had not seen before. Many became curious about white people and their world.\nDuring this time, more and more land around the reserve was being used for livestock. Long droughts during this time caused conflicts between the A\u1e49angu and farmers over things like food and water. Encounters with stockmen on nearby cattle stations were often violent. In 1934, a man was shot dead at Ulu\u1e5fu by police. A\u1e49angu people became frightened of police and many left the area for safety. Later, some groups started to work on the stations in exchange for food. Others moved to towns because they wanted the things white people had. As a result, many people in the government believed that the reserve had failed to protect the A\u1e49angu lifestyle.\nCreation of the park.\nIn the late 1930s, prospectors thought there might be gold in the area. There was a famous story of a lost gold deposit called Lasseter's Reef. The man who said he had found it had died near the Petermann Ranges in 1931, and it was said to be located somewhere in the area. In 1940, the Petermann Reserve was made smaller, so that people could look for the gold. At the same time, an interest in tourism at Ulu\u1e5fu began to grow. A track for vehicles to reach Ulu\u1e5fu was built from Curtin Springs in 1948. Tour groups from Alice Springs began arriving a few years later. At first, the government only allowed a few tour companies to go to the rock, because it was still part of the reserve. But demand for tourist income was growing fast. In 1951, Connellan Airways asked for an airstrip to be built next to Ulu\u1e5fu, even though planes were already landing there.\nIn 1958, the government cut the area around Ulu\u1e5fu and Kata Tju\u1e6fa from the A\u1e49angu reserve, creating the Ayers Rock\u2013Mt Olga National Park. It claimed that the rocks were no longer important to the natives. The new park was managed by the Territory government, which leased the land out to tour companies. Connellan built their airstrip close to the northern side of Ulu\u1e5fu in 1959. Campsites and motels were built in 1967.\nThe A\u1e49angu were told not to come into the park, but they did anyway. Ulu\u1e5fu was an important stopping point on travels because of the water usually located there. At first they were tolerated by the park rangers. But as the number of tourists at Ulu\u1e5fu rose, there were conflicts between tourists and A\u1e49angu. The government then tried to move them away from the area by building the Docker River village, to the west, in 1968. Because their homeland and lifestyle had changed, the A\u1e49angu had to find new ways to make a living. They began selling handicrafts and artworks to tourists. Those still living at Ulu\u1e5fu even opened a store, called the Ininti Store, which they leased from the government in 1972.\nIn 1971, A\u1e49angu groups met with the Office of Aboriginal Affairs, a part of the government that were in charge of looking after aboriginal people. A\u1e49angu people told the Office that they were worried about the effects mining and tourism were having on their land. They also said that their sacred sites were being desecrated (not being looked after properly). They asked for the government's help in protecting them.\nIn 1973, people from the government visited to make a report on the park. This report said that A\u1e49angu should be involved in the park's management. It said they could be hired as rangers, and that their sacred sites should be protected. It also advised that all the tourist facilities be moved out of the park. This was because they were having a bad effect on the environment. In 1975, the area called Yulara, to the north, was set aside for this. The airstrip was removed and rebuilt in Yulara in 1982. The resort at Yulara opened in 1983. After that, the campground and motels inside the park were closed, and everything was removed from the park by the end of 1984.\nRecent history.\nIn 1976, the Aboriginal Land Rights Act was passed for the Northern Territory. It allowed native people to claim rights to own land if they lived on it before Europeans arrived, but only if the land is not already owned. The A\u1e49angu asked for ownership of the park's land under this law in 1979. But because it had already been made a national park, the claim was not allowed. Even so, the court decided that the A\u1e49angu were the \"traditional\" owners (\"ngura\u1e5fitja\") of the land.\nThere was then a long legal case over the freehold title (actual ownership) of the lands. The case continued until November 1983, when Prime Minister Bob Hawke acknowledged that the A\u1e49angu had the rights to Ulu\u1e5fu. On 26 October 1985, they were given the title deeds for the park as the traditional and legal owners of the land. The Territory government protested this decision. It had made a big and expensive campaign to get support and stop it happening. In exchange for ownership, the A\u1e49angu had to lease the land back to the federal government so that it could stay as a national park. They started managing the park together in April 1986.\nUluru National Park was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987, as a natural property. It had already been made a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO in 1977. This means it was an important natural environment. The name of the park changed to Ulu\u1e5fu\u2013Kata Tju\u1e6fa National Park in 1993. The next year, it was added to the list again, this time as a cultural landscape. This means that it is one of the few sites in the world that is chosen for both its natural and cultural importance. The listing recognised \"tjukurpa\" as being the best tool for looking after the park. In 1995, Ulu\u1e5fu\u2013Kata Tju\u1e6fa National Park won the highest UNESCO award for setting new standards for the management of a World Heritage site.\nGeography.\nUlu\u1e5fu\u2013Kata Tju\u1e6fa National Park is in the southwestern corner of the Northern Territory, in the centre of Australia. It is southwest of Alice Springs. The park covers of flat, red-sand plains. The huge rock formations of Ulu\u1e5fu and Kata Tju\u1e6fa are the only major landmarks.\nUlu\u1e5fu is an sandstone inselberg, rising above the plains around it. Most of its bulk is below the ground. Kata Tju\u1e6fa, west of Ulu\u1e5fu, is a group of 36 rock domes (or bornhardts), divided by steep-sided valleys. It covers an area of . The tallest dome, Mount Olga, is above the surrounding plain. It is the highest point in the park, at above sea level.\nThe only permanent settlement in the park is the A\u1e49angu village of Mu\u1e6fitjulu. It is on the eastern side of Ulu\u1e5fu, and about 350 people live there.\nGeology.\nMakeup.\nUlu\u1e5fu and Kata Tju\u1e6fa are made of different types of sedimentary rock. Ulu\u1e5fu is mostly made of arkose, a hard type of sandstone that contains a lot of the mineral feldspar. The sediment originally comes mostly from granite. Kata Tju\u1e6fa is made of conglomerate, which consists of bits of rock that has been cemented together by sand and mud. The sediment in this rock is a mixture of granite, gneiss and basic rocks.\nAge and origin.\nEven though the rock types are different, Ulu\u1e5fu and Kata Tju\u1e6fa are thought to be about the same age. They have both been exposed because of folding, faulting and the erosion of surrounding rock.\nThe park is in a geological area called the Amadeus sedimentary basin. The basin was formed about 900 million years ago. Over hundreds of millions of years, it was covered by layer after layer of sediment, until about 300 million years ago. About 550 million years ago, the mountain ranges to the south and west were pushed up out of the ground in a mountain-building event. These mountains quickly crumbled and huge chunks of sediment were pushed northward by rivers. The rivers flattened out into at least two alluvial fans. It is the remains of these alluvial fans that are seen today as Ulu\u1e5fu and Kata Tju\u1e6fa.\nBy about 500 million years ago, a shallow inland sea formed in the basin. Over many hundreds of years, sand and mud fell to the bottom of the sea, covering the alluvial deposit. This layer cemented everything together, forming the arkose over Ulu\u1e5fu and the conglomerate over Kata Tju\u1e6fa. The sea dried up between 400 and 300 million years ago. A long period of folding tilted the horizontal rock layers. The layers of Ulu\u1e5fu arkose were folded to the near vertical position they are in today. The conglomerate of Kata Tju\u1e6fa was tilted about 15 to 20 degrees from the horizontal. This means that Ulu\u1e5fu and Kata Tju\u1e6fa are the exposed tips of huge rock slabs that run far below the ground.\nA valley was formed between the two rocks about 65 million years ago. Newer layers of sediment were added to the old ones. These were covered by the red sand that can be seen today, which was brought in by wind.\nShaping.\nThe big canyons of Kata Tju\u1e6fa are thought to be evidence of faults that formed while the rock was being folded millions of years ago. Many years of weathering has made the faults bigger and water has eroded the rock into the valleys and domes seen today. Ulu\u1e5fu has deep parallel fractures that run down its sides. These are caused by erosion, mostly from rainwater running off the domed top. The caves around the base of Ulu\u1e5fu were formed by water weathering, though the exact process is still not known. Erosion of the rock is very slow, because the surface is very hard, and because there is no major jointing or parting at its base.\nColour changes.\nThe bright orange-red colour of the rock surfaces comes from the oxidation (or rusting) of the iron in the arkose. When fresh (not exposed to the air), the arkose has a grey colour. Ulu\u1e5fu appears to change colour at different times of the day and year. It glows a deep red colour during sunrise and sunset. The red light that comes across the sky at these times reflects off the rock, sand and clouds to make a bright glowing effect.\nHydrology.\nUlu\u1e5fu\u2013Kata Tju\u1e6fa is normally arid (dry). Most of the water in the park is under the ground. It can stay under the park for thousands of years. In the end, it all drains through the ground to Lake Amadeus in the north. Knowing where to find this underground water has always been important for human survival in the area. It is the only supply of water in the area that people can rely on. Both Mu\u1e6fitjulu and Yulara get their water from ancient aquifers under the park. The water contains salt, which is removed before it is used. The aquifers being refilled depends on rare major rains, normally happening every ten years or so.\nThere are no proper watercourses in the park. Creek beds and gullies are mostly found in the valleys around Kata Tju\u1e6fa. These are usually dry, except after heavy rains, but water can stay under the sand for months. The soils in the park contain high levels of clay, which stops water from soaking into the ground too quickly. The only lasting surface water in the park is Mu\u1e6fitjulu Waterhole (\"\"), at the base of Ulu\u1e5fu. It has many waterholes (pockets of water) that have formed by rain running off the rock down its fracture lines. They are the only lasting spots of water above the ground for hundreds of kilometres in any direction. They normally have some water in them for the whole year.\nClimate and seasons.\nUlu\u1e5fu\u2013Kata Tju\u1e6fa has a mostly dry climate. Rainfall is usually low, very hard to predict. The park gets an average of of rain per year, but each year can be very different. Rain is most common between November and March. Droughts are common and can be very long. The most rain recorded in one year was in 1974. The least amount was in 1965. The year 1965 was also the end of the longest drought that has been recorded here, which lasted six and a half years. Major rainfalls (periods with lots of rain) are rare, happening about every ten years. They are very important for refilling the groundwater supply and can put a lot of life into the ecosystems. The last major rainfall was in 2009, which got of rain.\nThe average relative humidity is a lot lower than in coastal areas. It normally lowers as the temperature rises. The average rate of evaporation per year is high at about . The levels of UV on most summer days reach between 11 and 15.\nAs in most arid inland areas, the days are very hot and the nights are very cold. The months between October and March have an average of 43 days where the temperature is above 40\u00b0C. The highest temperature recorded in the park was 47\u00b0C in December 1993. In winter, the temperature overnight often falls below freezing (0\u00b0C). The average temperature range for winter months is 14\u201330\u00b0C. The lowest temperature recorded in the park was \u20135\u00b0C in July 1976.\nThe A\u1e49angu say the park has five seasons:\nEcology.\nThe park is ranked as one of the most important arid land ecosystems in the world. It is one of 15 biosphere reserves in Australia under UNESCO's Man and the Biosphere system. The landscape looks quite barren, but is actually a complex ecosystem with many forms of life. Plants and animals have adapted to the area's extreme conditions. As a result, it supports some of the most unusual flora and fauna on the planet.\nMuch of the park land is made up of flat plains dotted with many kinds of spinifex grasses. There are also large areas of sand dunes, rocky scrubland and open woodland. The gullies and creek lines that fan out from the rock formations form their own unique habitats, because of the concentration of water in the ground there.\nManagement.\nThe park is managed jointly (together) by the A\u1e49angu and Parks Australia. Parks Australia is the government body that looks after national parks in Australia. It is a part of the Department of the Environment. The A\u1e49angu own the land, and lease it to the government. The lease began in 1985 and lasts for 99 years. Decisions are made by the Board of Management, a group of people. Under the lease terms, the A\u1e49angu always hold a majority on the management board. There are 12 people on the board.\nThe Director of National Parks is the only permanent seat. All the others sit for five years, and then new people are chosen. All choices have to be approved by the A\u1e49angu. The staff that work in the park every day are from Parks Australia. This team is overseen by a general park manager, who reports to the Director.\n\"Tjukurpa\", the A\u1e49angu legal code, makes up the basis for the park's management. It says how to deal with problems, and sets penalties for people who break the rules. The A\u1e49angu have used the Australian legal system to enforce \"tjukurpa\" and protect their sacred values. Sacred sites are registered under Territory law; it is against the law for visitors to enter them. Laws also protect traditional designs from being copied. A\u1e49angu have the right to forage and hunt in the park."}

It is near Virginia Beach, Virginia. For a long time, it has been important for the large amount of shipping entering the Chesapeake Bay from the Atlantic Ocean. The first building was the first lighthouse authorized by the U.S. government. It was built in 1792. The lighthouse was also the first federal construction project under the Constitution. It was expected to cost $15,200 to build. Another $2,500 was needed to finish the lighthouse. A second lighthouse was built in 1881 a short distance away. It was built because people were worried the first building was not stable.\nHistory.\nThe Cape Henry Lighthouse was the first work of the new U.S. Federal government. It was built of stone by John McComb, Jr.. The building was finished in October, 1792. McComb was one of the architects that helped build New York City Hall. He also designed other lighthouses. The lighthouse's design was based on the 1767 Cape Henlopen Light. The lighthouse was damaged by Confederate forces during the American Civil War. It was repaired by Union forces in 1863. Union forces needed the light for navigation. In the 1870s, people worried about the condition and safety of the old lighthouse at Cape Henry. Because of this, the New Cape Henry Lighthouse was built in 1881. The new lighthouse is southeast of the old lighthouse. The old tower was not destroyed. It is still standing. The old lighthouse is still a daymark used for triangulation. The lighthouse was fully automated in 1983.\nDescription.\nIn 1798, Benjamin Latrobe visited Cape Henry Lighthouse and described it as \"an octangular truncated pyramid of eight sides, rising 90 feet to the light...\" The Old Cape Henry Lighthouse is 26 feet in diameter at its base and 16 feet at its top. It was built with Aquia Creek sandstone. The sandstone came from the same source as the White House.\nThe new lighthouse is tall. It was built of cast iron and wrought iron. It also has a more powerful light.\nPreservation.\nPreservation Virginia took control of the older lighthouse in 1930. Preservation Virginia was known as the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities at the time. A brick lining and an iron stairway have been added to the lighthouse. The lighthouse is open to the public. It was made a National Historic Landmark on January 29, 1964. In 2002 the American Society of Civil Engineers listed the lighthouse a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark.\nThe lighthouses are located in the city of Virginia Beach within the boundaries of Joint Expeditionary Base East, a Navy base. The Cape Henry Memorial is next to the lighthouses."}

It was once the home of American writer Washington Irving. He wrote many books, but he is best known for the short stories \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" and \"Rip Van Winkle\". Irving bought the property on June 7, 1835 for $1,800. He described it to his brother as \"a beautiful spot, capable of being made a little paradise ... I have had an architect up there, and shall build upon the old mansion this summer. My idea is to make a little nookery somewhat in the Dutch style, quaint, but unpretending. It will be of stone.\" In its day, Dr. Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. said that Sunnyside stood \"next to Mount Vernon, the best known and most cherished of all the dwellings in our land.\" The public interest in the home drew several gawkers hoping to catch a glimpse of Irving working. Irving died of a heart attack in his bedroom at Sunnyside on November 28, 1859. Irving's descendants lived in the house until 1945. In that year, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. bought it. He opened the house to tourists in 1947. Sunnyside is now a museum. An admission fee is charged. The house contains furniture that once belonged to Irving. Sunnyside became a National Historic Landmark in 1962."}

The story was published in 1820 in a collection of Irving's literary pieces called \"The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.\" The story was one of the first fictional works by an American author to become popular outside the United States. Adaptations include Walt Disney's animated movie \"The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad\" of 1949 and, more recently, Tim Burton's \"Sleepy Hollow\" of 1999 starring Johnny Depp.\nStory.\nA lanky school teacher named Ichabod Crane arrives in the village of Tarry Town. He is very superstitious. He falls in love with pretty Katrina Van Tassel (and her father's large farm).\nKatrina has a suitor though. His name is Brom Bones. Brom is a rowdy and boisterous young man. He does not like Ichabod. He does not like Ichabod hovering about Katrina.\nOne autumn night after a party at the Van Tassel's, Ichabod sets off for home alone. He thinks he sees the Headless Horseman, a dead soldier of the Revolution whose head was blown off by a cannon ball. His ghost haunts the countryside in search of his head.\nHe chases Ichabod. Ichabod is terrified and runs away. He is never seen again. Villagers find only a smashed Jack-o'-lantern. Whenever the story is told, Brom gives a knowing wink. It is implied that he frightened away his rival by posing as the Headless Horseman."}
