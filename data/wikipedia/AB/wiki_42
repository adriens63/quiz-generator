They occurred in July and August, with epicentres north of Rinjani volcano, that caused significant damage and deaths:\nOn August 5, 2018, Lombok Island, an island off the eastern part of Bali Island, Indonesia experienced a 6.9 magnitude earthquake. The epicenter of the earthquake was 18 km Northwest of East Lombok. The earthquake had the potential to cause a tsunami, and a Tsunami alert was sounded but later the warming was removed as the risk was reduced. The Indonesian government made efforts to broadcast information about the impact of the earthquake. However, thorough geospatial data about how the earthquake affects larger areas was limited and mostly inaccessible for the public. Available information, for example, was that according to the Head of the Regional Disaster Management Agency (BPBD) of West Nusa Tenggara Province, the loss due to the earthquake reached 1 trillion IDR. Then, according to the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), the number of victims of the earthquake was &gt;100 people, with 238 people injured, thousands of homes damaged, and tens of thousands becoming refugees.\nA tsunami struck Java and Sumatra starting at 9:30 p.m. and resulting in more than 300 deaths. The tsunami was likely caused by undersea landslides due to the ongoing eruption of Anak Krakatau volcano located in the Sunda Strait. Anak Krakatau\u2019s most recent series of eruptions started in June 2018.\nEarthquakes in Indonesia.\nIndonesia is an archipelago that includes thousands of volcanic islands, which were created over time as plates shift and molten rock, or magma, exerts pressure. The Southeast Asian country is located on the Pacific ring of fire, where slabs of the earth\u2019s crust \u2014 tectonic plates \u2014 clash, creating earthquakes when the plates shove against one another. About 90% of earthquakes occur along the Ring of Fire.\nAmong the most deadly earthquakes in history was the magnitude 9.1 quake that struck off the west coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra on 26 December 2004, triggering a massive tsunami. This disaster killed nearly 230,000 people across several countries."}

The cost of housing can refer either to rental housing or to homes which are owned by the occupants.

In the United States, prices fell by 34%, and foreclosures went up.\nAccording to \"USA Today\", homes in 2019 in the United States were least affordable to purchase compared to any other year in the last ten last years.

It was produced by Walt Disney Productions. It is loosely based on the 1967 book with the same name by Daniel P. Mannix. It is the 24th Disney animated movie. The movie tells the story of the unlikely friendship between a red fox named Tod and a hound dog named Copper. The two friends have trouble keeping their friendship despite their emerging instincts, as well as the people around them saying that they have to be enemies. The movie was directed by Ted Berman, Richard Rich, and Art Stevens. It was produced by Ron Miller, Wolfgang Reitherman, and Art Stevens. The movie has the voices of Mickey Rooney, Kurt Russell, Pearl Bailey, Jack Albertson, Sandy Duncan, Jeanette Nolan, Pat Buttram, John Fiedler, John McIntire, Dick Bakalyan, Paul Winchell, Keith Mitchell, and Corey Feldman.\nWalt Disney Productions first bought the rights to make a movie based on the novel by Daniel P. Mannix in 1967. However, the making of the movie did not actually happen until spring 1977. \"The Fox and the Hound\" was the last movie to involve the remaining members of Disney's Nine Old Men. Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston were two of them. In the end, the movie was handed over to a new generation of animators after the retirement of the old animators. However, the old animators had involvement in the early making of the movie. Also, \"The Fox and the Hound\" was the first movie for future directors including Tim Burton, Brad Bird, and John Lasseter. During the making of the movie, the movie's release was delayed by over six months. This was because of the sudden and unexpected retirement of Don Bluth and his team of animators. In the part of the movie where the character Chief is hit by a train, the movie makers were originally going to have him die like in the book. This was changed so that Chief survives with a broken leg. This decision was controversial with the movie makers.\n\"The Fox and the Hound\" was released to movie theaters on July 10, 1981 by Buena Vista Distribution. The movie was a success at the box office. It was the 14th highest-grossing movie of the year and made $39.9 million in the United States. At the time of release, it was the most expensive animated movie produced to date. It cost $12 million to make the movie. It was re-released to theaters on March 25, 1988.

This release was the last entry in the Walt Disney Classics collection. It was placed into moratorium on April 30, 1995. On May 2, 2000, the movie was released on Region 1 DVD for the first time. This was part of the Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection line. A 25th anniversary special edition DVD was released on October 10, 2006.\n\"The Fox and the Hound\" was released on Blu-ray on August 9, 2011. This was to honor the movie's 30th anniversary. The movie was released in a 3-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo pack alongside its direct-to video follow-up \"The Fox and the Hound 2\" in a 2-movie Collection Edition. The Blu-ray has a new digital restoration. It presents the movie for the first time in 1.66:1 widescreen.

In the same year, it was also nominated for a Young Artist Award and the Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film.\nFollow-up.\nA follow-up, \"The Fox and the Hound 2\", was released directly-to-DVD on December 12, 2006. The follow-up takes place during the childhood of Tod and Copper. This is before the events of the later half of the first movie.

Theodora Kroeber wrote the book. It was published in 1961. It was translated into nine languages. \nIshi had been found alone and starving outside Oroville, California in 1911. The anthropologists Alfred Louis Kroeber and Thomas Waterman took him to the Museum of Anthropology in San Francisco. There, he was studied by the anthropologists, before his death in 1916. Theodora Kroeber married Alfred Kroeber in 1926. Though she had never met Ishi, she decided to write a biography of him. \nSummary.\nThe book has two parts. The first part is called \"Ishi the Yahi\". It tells about the history and the culture of the Yahi people. The second part is called \"Mister Ishi\". It tells about his life at the museum. \nThe first part begins with the history of California before European colonization. Kroeber writes that though there were few Yahi, they once occupied a large part of the Sacramento Valley. Other, more numerous, Native American peoples probably pushed the Yahi into the mountains. The first part also describes the Yahi language and the landscape where they lived near Mount Lassen. \nSeveral chapters in the first section are about the destruction of the Yahi by white settlers. The second part of the book begins with a history of the museum in San Francisco where Ishi was taken. It also tells how he got the name Ishi. At the museum, Alfred Kroeber and others arranged for weekly public demonstrations. Ishi would usually demonstrate stringing a bow, or making fire with a fire drill. Finally Ishi's friends had to arrange for Ishi to work as a janitor, so the University would pay to support him. In addition to Kroeber, Waterman and Pope, Ishi became friends with other Native American friends of the anthropologists, such as Juan Dolores, a Tohono O'odham Indian. Ishi spent much of his time at the museum making tools and weapons. He also went hunting with his friends. The last chapter of the book tells of Ishi becoming sick with tuberculosis in late 1914, and his death from the disease soon afterwards."}

Archaeologists are people who study people through objects. Often by digging for remains and artifacts. Processual archaeologists use specific methods to come up with general rules that explain human culture around the world and through time. This means they are trying to find reasons that explain why people around the world do things in similar ways.\nBackground of Processual Archaeology.\nProcessual archaeology came about in the 1960s and is an approach to archaeology; this means it is a way of doing archaeology that people choose to follow. Before the processual approach, another approach was \u2018culture history\u2019 which tried to only create histories for particular places. Culture history archaeologists started with a modern culture and traced its roots back as far as they would go. Culture history archaeologists dug units (square holes that are dug very carefully) that went very deep to find the oldest objects. Anywhere you dig, the youngest materials are close to the surface at the top and the oldest materials are at the bottom. Archaeologists learn about the history of a place by knowing what objects came in what order. This helps archaeologists understand the history of a place.\nProcessual archaeology is different from culture history because archaeologists dug larger units to understand more widely what was happening at a site, or place of archaeological importance. These new archaeologists also added many scientific instruments to help them study the past. \nLewis Binford and Archaeology as Anthropology.\nLewis Binford was a famous processual archaeologist from the 1960s. He believed that archaeology should be practiced like anthropology. Anthropology is the study of past and present people and the many parts of what it means to be human. Binford argued that archaeologists are responsible to add to anthropology as a field of study; this includes how cultures and societies around the world change over time. \nBinford wanted to study different types of things to show changes over time in many different parts of human culture. He tried to do this by studying things in a systematic way (a way that follows set rules and can be repeated). Binford believed that some parts of culture were more important than others and thought that the way people act is based on forces or laws that people do not know about and cannot control. \nWhat do processual archaeologists do?\nProcessual archaeologists tried to create models to explain why and how people would act. They felt that humans behave the same and given the same conditions or choices, people will make similar ones. \nProcessual archaeologists also decided to conduct archaeologically scientifically. They used radiometric dating techniques to figure out how old an artifact is, as well as other techniques to prove how the artifact was used. They began to reproduce artifacts to better understand how they were made. This is called experimental archaeology. Another scientific approach was to conduct ethnographic fieldwork (link) to better understand past hunter gatherers. Processualists think that the way hunter gatherers are today is similar to the way they were in the past. This helps us understand them better.\nImpact.\nPost processualism challenged processual archaeology. Post processual archaeologists thought that processualists did not think beyond the artifacts and forgot about the people behind the pots. They also challenged the assumption that humans act rationally and the idea that behavior can be modelled. They also challenged how processual archaeologists know what they know, and looked at the biases behind work. \nModern Day.\nProcessual archaeology continues to be used today, however it is not the same as it was when it started. The biggest change came with computers. The models that archaeologists could be tested and seen to be accurate or not. More detailed examinations of artifacts could be made. Not all archaeologists think the same way about the past. After processual archaeology came post-processual archaeology which challenged a lot of the assumptions being made. Both processualists and post processualists exist today.\nReferences.\nBinford, Lewis R.\n1962. \"Archaeology as anthropology\". In Contemporary Archaeology, ed by M. Leone, pp. 93\u2013101.

{"id": "691195", "revid": "24306", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=691195", "title": "Feminist Anthropology", "text": "Feminist Anthropology is a theory that combines anthropology (the study of humans) and feminism (the political movement for the rights of women). Feminism began to noticeably make a mark on anthropology during the 1970's . Feminist anthropology changed how anthropologists study women. Anthropologists for the most part used to ignore women\u2019s work and not bother understanding their social roles. The influence of feminist anthropology can be seen in the inclusion of women\u2019s stories and perspectives in anthropology. \nHistory.\nBefore the 1960's most anthropologists were men, most anthropology research was about men, and because of that the contributions of women were not understood or considered important. Feminist anthropologists were recognized as a group in the 1970\u2019s. They were concerned about male bias, so they worked to get more women doing research and writing and more academics focusing on the roles of women in their research. Feminist anthropology is often political and related to activism, or making change to help people that need it. \nFeminist anthropology led to an increase in research from all over the world that focused on women. Early feminist anthropologists in the United States and Europe questioned whether women were considered unequal to men everywhere in the world, or if that was just true where they were from. They found that people think of and treat women as less important than men all over the world. Feminism was needed everywhere. Unfortunately, what a lot of feminists thought about as gender related issues that everyone faced were mostly things that educated white women from the United States and Europe knew about and saw as issues. Other perspectives about womanhood were expressed but they were not as common in academic writing or getting as much attention in anthropology. This was a big problem.\nLater feminist anthropologists questioned whether the idea of gender is the same everywhere in the world. They found out that lots of people have lots of different ideas about what gender is and what is normal for people of different genders to do. This means that even though women all over the world are treated as less important than men in a lot of situations, this looks different to different women. This includes people born in different areas of the world, with different religions, lifestyles, education levels, body types, skin colors, sexualities, incomes, jobs, and physical abilities. Not all women have the same experiences of womanhood, which is one of the reasons that it is so important that feminist anthropology comes from the perspectives of lots of women who have had different life experiences from each other. Today it does. \nFeminist anthropology doesn't only come from the voices of white educated women, but there are still more of those voices represented than the voices of all of the other women in the world. It has happened a lot (and still happens a lot) that white educated women tell the stories of women who have very different life experiences than them. Sometimes they do a good job telling the stories but sometimes they get things wrong or they don\u2019t understand the perspective of the women they are talking about. Feminist anthropologists today aim to recognize and point out this kind of bias. Sometimes feminist anthropologists talk a bit about their experiences to let people understand their perspective and their potential bias more before reading their paper. Sometimes they talk about their ideas in unusual ways like with poetry, drawings, or in multiple languages to let people see their perspective in different ways. This helps make anthropology easier to understand for people who don't read academic papers, don't speak English, or think in different ways than people are taught to think in western schools. \nImportance Today.\nFeminist anthropology today is connecting people all over the world by sharing stories of women and creating ideas to combat different types of male dominance. Both women and men read and write feminist anthropology. Sharing and trying to understand the significance of women\u2019s stories gives these stories importance when they might not have been heard, lets people understand what makes different women happy and what problems different women face, uncovers and helps explain similarities and differences in people, and might make it easier for people who don\u2019t know each other to help each other out. Sometimes these stories are written by the women they are about (autoethnographies) and sometimes those stories are written by anthropologists who do their best to record the stories of those women the way they would want their stories to be told. This can give women power. \nFeminist anthropologists have realized that even when there are female anthropologists from different perspectives doing work that helps women and tells their stories, and even though women today get more PhD's than men in anthropology, they are not published, cited, or given jobs as often as male anthropologists are. This means people still usually learn about women from the point of view of men, and women do not get credit for the work they do as often as men do [3]. \nThis is one of the reasons why feminist anthropology is an important part of anthropology. Feminist anthropologists are trying to change this by reading and citing women and pointing out when they see this happening, . If there were no feminists, there may continue to be more men than women teaching anthropology and more papers written by men being read.\u00a0 Men tend to cite each other, and they write about other men a lot of the time, so anthropology would be taught by mostly men and about mostly men.This would make it so most of our ideas about humans came just from men (less than half of the human population). Feminist anthropologists are some of the people working to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen. \nFeminist anthropology is important to all four sub-fields of anthropology. The four sub-fields are cultural anthropology, biological anthropology (also called physical anthropology), archaeology, and linguistic anthropology. Feminist anthropology is used most often in cultural anthropology. Feminist anthropology is used with many other theories in anthropology like queer anthropology, agency theory, and decolonization."}

From April 11 to 12, 1965, tornadoes touched down in Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, and Michigan. It was the second biggest outbreak at the time. 271 people were killed, and 1,500 injured and it is the deadliest tornado outbreak in Indiana's history, with 137 people killed in that state.\nOutbreak description.\nJust before 1 PM CST, a tornado touched down in Cedar County, Iowa. It was rated F4 and was spawned by a supercell thunderstorm around 12:45 PM CST by a news reporter named Martin Jensen of WMT in Cedar Rapids. After he detected the thunderstorm, Jensen called the office in Waterloo and Des Moines to alert them about the storm.\nA tornado touched down in Crystal Lake, Illinois, destroying several subdivisions and a junior high school. 5 people were killed, with 3 of the fatalities occurring when a truck was blown into a basement where people were taking shelter. The tornado then destroyed the community of Island Lake, killing one person before lifting around 3:42 PM CST. It was rated F4.\nSeveral tornadoes touched down in Indiana, many of them fatal. The first tornado touched down around 5:30 PM in Koontz Lake, Indiana. The F3 tornado left 10 people dead and 180 injured. The tornado moved northeast, damaging a high school which was under construction. It destroyed 20 homes in the Wyatt area.\nAnother tornado formed near the St. Joseph-Elkhart County line. It moved east-northeast where it killed a child in Wakarusa. It moved towards Dunlap, and a trailer park. Reporter Paul Huffman captured photographs as the twin-funneled F4 tornado leveled the trailer park. The tornado killed 14 people. An hour and a half later, a second F4 tornado struck Dunlap and devastated the Sunnyside Housing addition and the town's church. 28 people were killed, with another six killed at a truck stop. The Palm Sunday Tornado Memorial Park now exists. Most of the 36 people who died had no warning as high winds from the previous tornado knocked out telephone and power grids. Most of northern Indiana was under a tornado warning also known as a \"blanket tornado warning\". Both were rated F4.\nAt 7:30 PM, another massive tornado slammed into Russiaville, leaving several dead. The storm destroyed Alto, before striking Kokomo. As it continued east, it killed 10 more people in Greentown, most who were riding in automobiles. More destruction occurred in Marion before it lifted. In Berne, another tornado cut through the northern part of the city, damaging homes and businesses before it crossed into Ohio destroying more homes before dissipating.\nEmergency services could not warn Michigan residents that the tornadoes were headed their way. The radar in Detroit observed thunderstorms over northern Indiana and western lower Michigan moving east-northeast at 70\u00a0mph. The tornadoes hit Kent County, just north of Grand Rapids. All but three counties in southern Michigan were hit. Two F4 tornadoes struck Hillsdale County and destroyed 200 cottages along Baw Beese Lake. Many people escaped because they were at church. Lenawee County was hit by two tornadoes in 30 minutes causing numerous fatalities (including a family of six). The local dance pavilion was destroyed after being rebuilt after a fire on Labor Day 1963. One of them destroyed parts of Onsted and in the nearby village of Tipton, which suffered a direct hit. Half of the town's buildings were damaged or destroyed.\nThe F4 tornadoes also struck Milan (still a village) south of Ann Arbor, straddling the county line between York Township and Milan Township. One tornado destroyed the Wolverinne Plastics building, completely removing the roof. That or the other tornado destroyed the local junior high school and the adjacent senior high school. It became a city in 1967 and opened a middle school in 1969, which replaced the old junior high school, and eventually demolishing the 1900 building.\nTornadoes continued from Indiana to Ohio where additional fatalities occurred. A double tornado occurred in Toledo, Ohio, which devastated the northern parts of the city with F4 damage. Five people were killed when the tornado flipped over a bus.\nAt 11 PM, a tornado touched down in Lorain County and struck Pittsfield, killing seven and destroying many structures. The same tornado caused severe damage to homes in Grafton. When it neared the Cleveland area, it diverged into two separate paths. Several witnesses saw two funnels merging into one just like the Dunlap, Indiana tornado earlier in the day. Large trees were felled. The storm produced F4 damage in Strongsville, where homes were destroyed. The tornado killed 18 people.\nThe last killer tornado occurred around 12:30 AM on April 12 killing four people."}

It covers the leaves, flowers, roots and stems of plants. It divides the plant from the outside environment. The epidermis has more than one function. It protects the plant from loss of water. It controls gas exchange. It makes metabolic compounds. In the roots it takes in water and nutrients. Some parts of a plant may have a different cover called a periderm. Potatoes have that kind of covering.\nThe epidermis is the outer cell layer of a plant. It is also the main part of the dermal tissue of leaves, stems, roots, flowers, fruits, and seeds. It is usually transparent.\nThe cells of the epidermis can vary in the way they are made and how they work. Most plants have an epidermis that is a single cell layer thick. Some plants, however, have an epidermis with more than one layer. Epidermal cells are linked tightly to each other. They give strength and protection to the plant. In the parts of the plant that are above ground, the epidermal cells contain cutin and are covered with a cuticle. This cuticle reduces loss of water. It is sometimes covered with wax. The wax gives some plants a whitish or bluish surface color. It also protects the plant from sunlight and wind. \nThe epidermis has more than one cell type. It can include epidermal cells, guard cells, subsidiary cells, and epidermal hairs (Trichomes). There are more epidermal cells than the other types.\nTrichomes (or hairs) grow out from the epidermis in many plants. "}

Overhead projectors were often used in classrooms to showcase some type of presentation on paper for a group of students to view and in more recent times, overhead projectors are being used/designed to project things on technological devices. This machine has a plastic frame that would be placed on top of the projector, and a fan that cools the machine from overheating if used for long periods of time.\nRecently, overhead projectors in classrooms and conference rooms are being replaced by things like document cameras and interactive whiteboards since they let the presenter to project video directly from a computer file. \nThe device has sometimes been called a \"Belshazzar\", after Belshazzar's feast.\nHistory.\nBefore this device was built, there were machines similar to its use called magic lanterns that was made before the overhead projector.\nFrench scientist Edmund Becquerel developed the first known overhead projection machine in 1853. It was used by Jules Duboscq in 1866. During World War II, overhead projectors were introduced into U.S. military training. After that, they were used at schools.

The heated fluid, called working fluid, can be air, hot water, pressurized water or liquid sodium which is heated in a boiler. The fluid used to power the engine is cooled and reused in a closed cycle and the fluid is dumped in an open cycle. \nIdea.\nAny combustion engine follows the basic idea of converting fossil fuels into motion. Internal combustion engines do this by converting the energy created by an explosion of the fossil fuels, into motion. External combustion engines, on the other hand, use the energy from burning fossil fuels to expand a gas or liquid and use the expansion to create motion. The addition of this intermediate step is what differentiates an internal vs. external combustion engine. External combustion engines came first, and tend to be more inefficient. Famous examples of external combustion engines are steam engines\nTypes.\nThere are two types of external combustion: single phase and dual phase. In a single phase engine, the fossil fuels are burned to heat up a gas, which then expands and creates motion. In this case, there is no phase change.\nWith dual phase, you need one additional mechanism known as a phase transition. This process transforms the phase of liquid to gas. This converts temperature to usable work. Some common examples that use dual-phase engines are steam engines and engines that use Organic Rankine Cycle."}

These members get legal advice and guidance on contracts with publishers as well as insurance and help with licensing and royalties.\nConflict with Google.\nOn September 20, 2005, the Authors Guild, together with Herbert Mitgang, Betty Miles and Daniel Hoffman, sued Google for its Book Search project. The Authors Guild said Google was breaking the law by making digital copies of books that were still in copyright. (Google countered that their use was fair according to US copyright law.)\nOn October 28, 2008, the Authors Guild, the Association of American Publishers, and Google announced an agreement. Google would pay $125 million, $45 million to rightsholders whose books were scanned without permission. The Google Book Search Settlement Agreement allowed for legal protection for Google's scanning project. But both sides still said the other was wrong about copyright law. The Settlement also would have started a new regulatory organization, the Book Rights Registry, which would decide how fees from Google went to rightsholders.\nThe settlement between the Authors guild and Google was rejected in 2011 by a judge at the district court level. The judge thought the settlement was not good for the authors.\nIn October 2015, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit sided with Google. The court said that scanning and posting parts of works online was Fair Use and did not harm the authors.\nIn late December 2015, the Authors Guild filed a writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court against Google over copyright laws. which in April 2016 did not review the case, leaving the lower court's decision as correct."}

They lay their eggs into raw flesh, and the lavae feed on raw flesh (or dead animals). Sometimes the adults hunt and kill the larvae of other insects.\nMost carrion beetles only walk: they have lost the power of flight. The do walk for long distances in search of dead animals to lay their eggs on.\nMost species occur on the northern hemisphere, in temperate climates. Often, they can be found in grassland or woodland areas. In the tropical climates they occur mostly in the mountains, where it is colder. They are not present in the desert. "}

This is called the \"four-field approach\". The four types of anthropology included are archaeology, linguistics, physical anthropology (or Biological), and cultural anthropology. Together, these four types of anthropology explain how different humans have resided all over the world throughout history.\nThere are some people who think applied anthropology, which uses the information learned from studying anthropology to solve modern problems of health or education, is it's own subject, which would make it a \"five field approach\", but this is not as common of a view.\nHistory of The Four-Field Approach.\nThis approach was created by Franz Boas (1858-1942), also named \u201cthe father of anthropology.\u201d He is famous for making anthropology popular, as well as an academic discipline in the United States. Boas wanted to show people that human activities, ideas, and choices are different in different places. He believed that the people should be studied holistically or as a whole, not just looking at one part of their life, but how all the parts of their lives fit together and create their culture. This includes studying people's , the objects they make, their bodies, languages, stories, and customs.\nApplication.\nSince the 20th century, most American universities have used the four-field approach. Other countries, like England, do not divide anthropology in the same way. For example, archaeology is a part of the subject of history and not anthropology.\nThe benefits of a four-field approach allows for different perspectives to be taken into account when studying anthropological topics. This helps to alleviate any bias or general incorrect assumptions about past and present cultures. \nThe Four Fields.\nArchaeology.\nArchaeology is the study of how people lived in the past. Archaeologists, learn from things left by people who lived a long time ago. They examine very old objects like pottery, stone tools, coins, books or anything made or used by humans. Usually, these objects are buried in the ground and need to be excavated, or dug up. These objects help archaeologists understand where and how people lived a long time ago. Most importantly, archaeologists focus on histories of cultures and the past, through artifacts and remains.\nCultural Anthropology.\nCultural anthropology is the study of human culture. Culture is the way groups of people live their lives based on what is normal or accepted behavior for where they live. Culture can be fluid and change as people\u2019s ideas change. Cultural anthropologists look at how different cultures are by comparing things like people\u2019s ideas, art, and food. The focus of this field is on the differences between cultures.\nIt is also related to sociology and social psychology. \nIt is also called \"social anthropology\".\nCultural Relativism.\nOne of Franz Boas' students, Ruth Benedict, helped to bring the term \"cultural relativism\" popularity. Cultural relativism is a notion that means people's beliefs and actions must be understood from within the context of their own culture. People studying culture should avoid judging culture based on their own assumptions and cultural standards. Boas and Bosnians' celebrated the diversity of culture and did not advocate for ethnocentrism or a superior culture of them all.\nLinguistics.\nLinguistics is the study of how people speak and the words they use and how their language developed over time (evolved). Linguists, people who study linguistics, also examine how language changes what people think and how people change language. They also look at how words make sentences. This field focuses on how language is a significance to culture.\nPhysical Anthropology.\nPhysical anthropology is the study of human body science (biology), including how people adapt to where they live and how bodies changed over time (evolution). They do this by comparing bones from very old humans to the bones of humans today. \nPhysical anthropologists also study non-human primates. \nIt is also called \"biological anthropology\"."}

There have also been changes in different forms of homosexuality and bisexuality. Present-day doctrines of the world's major religions are vastly different.\nSeveral religions (particularly the Abrahamic ones) do not allow homosexuality and/or same-sex marriage. In other words, some religions will only allow sex within marriage between one man and one woman. For example, in Judaism, the rules teach that man shall not lie with another man as he would with a woman. Most forms of Christianity take a conservative approach on the issue of homosexuality, same-sex marriage and LGBT rights: including the Eastern Orthodox Church, Mormonism , Oriental Orthodoxy, the Roman Catholic Church and many strains of Protestantism (including Evangelicalism, Pentecostalism, Presbyterianism among others)-calling same-sex acts as sinful. \nHowever, there are liberal forms of Christianity accept homosexuality, LGBT rights and same-sex marriage. Namely, the United Church of Christ, the Evangelical Lutheran Church, the Metropolitan Community Church and several others are accepting of homosexuality and LGBT rights.\nSome religous fundamentalists have said that HIV/AIDS is a punishment from God against homosexual people.\nConservative denominations often oppose same-sex sexual relations based on Old and New Testament that call human sexual relations as strictly heterosexual (in other words, between one man and one woman)."}

She studied in the College of Creative Studies. There, she re-started the Society of Physics Students group and led a student study group on science in fiction. \nShe earned her Master of Science in geophysics at the University of British Columbia in 2010. Her graduate work was about measuring and managing risk of landslides. She used statistical models to map landslides physical characteristics to better predict how far landslides run and reduce the number of people hurt and the amount of damage. \nMcKinnon was looking for work after graduation during a hiring freeze by the Canadian government. She learned that women in her field were being hired because they could be paid less than men. So, she spoke out more for women and minorities in science.\nResearch career.\nMcKinnon does research in disaster management, preparedness, and communication. She works with scientific research, advocacy, and policy. She uses her knowledge of both science and communication to teach science to disaster managers. She rewrote the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) science curriculum for emergency managers. She is working on several projects with Natural Resources Canada. \nMcKinnon is a co-investigator of Project ESPRESSO. She uses her expertise in terrestrial landslides and hazard mapping to help the project reach its goal of describing extraterrestrial target surfaces (asteroids, comets, and moons) and reducing risks for robots and humans in space exploration. The project is a group of seven partner institutions. It started when NASA called for Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute groups in 2016. ESPRESSO is one of thirteen projects that were chosen after that call. \nScience communication.\nMcKinnon began doing science communication as a Master's student at UBC. The producers of the television show \"Stargate: Atlantis\" wanted a physicist who could help with accurate scientific explanations for the show's science fiction plots. McKinnon answered. After graduation, she worked in science communication including popular science writing and continued helping on the television shows Stargate: Atlantis and \"Stargate: Universe\". Recently, McKinnon has worked on \"Doomsday: 10 Ways the World Will End\", \"No Tomorrow\", \"Madam Secretary\", and . McKInnon says that her interest in communication started with the media's incorrect reporting of a major landslide in the Pacific Northwest. \nShe was an editor for Gawker Media. She wrote about popular science topics for io9 and later became a science writer for Gizmodo. She writes about topics including space exploration, dinosaur discovery, the meeting of science and art, and disaster preparedness. Her writing is in \"Wired UK\", \"Smithsonian\" magazine, \"Ars Technica\", and \"Astronomy\". \nShe volunteers for the National Academy of Sciences Science &amp; Entertainment Exchange. There, she uses her knowledge to help the entertainment industry show science more accurately in the media."}

The name Operation Valkyrie\u2014originally referring to part of the conspiracy\u2014has become related to the plot. The idea behind the assassination was to seize political control of Germany and its armed forces from the Nazi Party (including the SS) and to make peace with the Western Allies as soon as possible.\nThe plot was a plan by several groups in the German resistance to overthrow the Nazi German government. Claus von Stauffenberg planted a bomb close to Adolf Hitler since he was presented with him in the conference meeting. The bomb failed to kill Hitler since one of the participants unwittingly moved the bomb away from Hitler. The table absorbed much of the blast as a result. The failure of the assassination attempt and the intended military that was to follow led the Gestapo to arrest more than 7,000\u00a0people, of whom they executed 4,980."}

She is now a Professor Emerita in Education and in Linguistics at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan. She works in Applied linguistics. She studies in second language acquisition, English as a second or foreign language, language teaching methods, teacher education, and English grammar. Her work on the complex/dynamic systems approach to second language development is very important and well-known.\nCareer.\nLarsen-Freeman began her career as a Peace Corps volunteer. She taught English in Sabah, Malaysia from 1967 to 1969. She says this experience started her interest in language acquisition. She went on to graduate studies at the University of Michigan, earning her PhD in linguistics in 1975.\nLarsen-Freeman worked at the faculty of the University of California, Los Angeles and then the SIT Graduate Institute. In 2002, she returned to the University of Michigan to direct the English Language Institute. She was also Professor in the School of Education and the Department of Linguistics. She retired from the University of Michigan in 2012. She has emerita positions at the English Language Institute and in Education and Linguistics at the University of Michigan, and at the SIT Graduate Institute. She is still active in her field, and teaches courses on the structure of English and second language development as a visiting senior fellow at the University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Education.\nLarsen-Freeman mostly researches second language acquisition. She also studies English grammar. She thinks grammar is not only a set of structural patterns, but also important for making meaning and for changing language to meet a communicative context. She thinks that complexity theory is a new and useful way to understand language, its acquisition, and its use. She sees all three as complex changing processes that do not move neatly in a straight line. She applied this idea to teaching grammar, or \u201cgrammaring\u201d as she calls it. The dynamic approach to second language development includes the idea that students each have their own path to learning, and that teaching is fundamentally a process of managing learning.\nLarsen-Freeman was also the editor of the journal \"Language Learning\" for five years.\nIn 1997, she wrote a leading article applying complex/dynamic systems theory to study second language acquisition. A book of papers in her honor, \"Complexity Theory and Language Development\", was published in 2017.\nRelated pages.\nList of women linguists"}

The park later became a civil war port for the slave trade. \nParkville was not a Civil War battlefield, but there was still mass genocide as numerous slaves tried desperately to escape across the river into Free Kansas. These slaves were buried in three large unmarked cemeteries. After the Civil War, the port was abandoned and the area slowly changed from a bustling city to what is Parkville.\nThe park includes the historic Bridge, built 1898 which spanned Linn Branch Creek.\nFlooding.\nDuring the Great Flood of 1993, the park and most of Downtown Parkville were submerged under more than 15 feet of water.\nOn May 4, 2003, English Landing Park narrowly missed an EF1 tornado that came across the river and cut damage paralleling the railroad tracks before crossing 9 Highway.\nIn May 2007, the Missouri River flooded the entire park with less than 3 feet of water. The river receded approximately a week later. Also in 2007, the Power Plant Restaurant's neglected smokestack had to be torn down, eradicating an icon of the city's past.\nOn March 17, 2019, The river flooded up over English Landing Park all the way to the train tracks before retreating a few days later. No buildings were damaged but playground equipment and structures at the dog park were damaged and lost. Also, a bridge that goes over the Linn branch creek collapsed. "}

Her first novel was called\"White Teeth\". It immediately became a best-seller and won awards. Her most recent book is \"Feel Free\" (2018). It is a collection of essays. She has been a tenured professor in the Creative Writing faculty of New York University since September 2010.\nEarly life.\nSmith was born Sadie Smith in Willesden in the north-west London borough of Brent.

This book combines two short stories about two troubled characters. The stories had been published first in \"Granta\" and \"The New Yorker\". Penguin published \"Martha and Hanwell\" with a new introduction by the author as part of their pocket series to celebrate their 70th birthday.

They married in 2004 in the Chapel of King's College, Cambridge. Smith dedicated \"On Beauty\" to \"my dear Laird\". She also uses his name in \"White Teeth\": \"An' all the good-lookin' men, all the \"rides\" like your man Nicky Laird, they're all dead.\"\nThe couple lived in Rome, Italy, from November 2006 to 2007. They now live in New York City and Queen's Park, London. They have two children, Katherine (Kit) and Harvey (Hal).\nAwards and recognition.\nShe was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2002.

It's not all dark in Liam World. I take me shades off every now and again and have a look at the world and see some nice things.\" Noel Gallagher stated jokingly in an interview with Patrick Kielty that Liam decided to \"write a song about his bird\", and states the title \"Song . . . bird\" in a cave man like manner. The song was written as a tribute to then-fianc\u00e9e Nicole Appleton. \"Songbird\" was composed in the key of G major using common time at 132 beats per minute.\n\u201cSongbird blew my head off when I first heard it because it was that f--king simple and that direct. But when Liam plays you a song he wants you to instantly f--king drop dead on the spot and then, when you come around, stab yourself in the heart and be in awe of the f--king sonic ability of the man.\u201d\nThe song was released as the fourth single from the band's Heathen Chemistry album, on 3 February 2003 and peaked at number 3 in the UK charts. It is included on the band's compilation album Stop the Clocks. Being written by lead singer Liam Gallagher, it was the first time the band had released a single not written by his brother Noel. \"(You've Got) The Heart of the Star\" and \"Columbia\" are B-sides, the latter of which was recorded live at the Glasgow Barrowlands, in October 2001.\nThe demo of the song is a typical Oasis approach to the song, featuring overdriven guitar and a stronger beat, as well as a guitar solo. Courtney Love has said that she and Liam played a version with her whistling and Gallagher playing guitar and singing, this was noted in the book Kurt and Courtney: Talking. Gallagher played the song for UK Radio Aid in January 2005."}

Phelps (originally Salone) is an American scientist who works at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. She was a member of the team that discovered element 117, tennessine. She is the first African-American woman to be involved with the discovery of an element. At Oak Ridge, Phelps serves as the program manager responsible for isotopes with industry uses. She also studies the treatment of radioactive \"super heavy\" elements like plutonium-238 and researches medical use isotopes.\nEarly life and education.\nPhelps was part of the Tennessee Aquatic Project and Development Group (TAP), which is a nonprofit organization for youth. Phelps earned a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry from Tennessee State University in 2003.\nU.S. Navy.\nAt the U.S. Navy, she worked in areas like nuclear power, reactor theory, and thermodynamics. In the Navy, she lived and worked on board an aircraft carrier (a large military ship that carries airplanes) called the USS Ronald Reagan. She helped maintain the two nuclear reactors on the ship.\nOak Ridge National Laboratory.\nIn 2009, Phelps joined the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. They use Oak Ridge's nuclear reactors to learn about different kinds of isotopes and how they work. \nWork on tennessine.\nAt Oak Ridge, Phelps was part of the team that helped discover a new element, number 117, called tennessine. Phelps is the first African-American woman to help discover an element.\nElement 117 is called tennessine. It is the second-heaviest element that has been discovered. Several laboratories worked together to discover tennessine. They discovered tennessine by creating it in a nuclear reactor. Scientists created tennessine by shooting calcium isotopes at berkelium isotopes. The two isotopes joined together\u2013called nuclear fusion\u2013and created a new element, tennessine.\nWork on berkelium.\nBerkelium is one of the most dangerous and radioactive elements. Oak Ridge was the only place in the world where berkelium could be made for the experiment (test). After the berkelium was made, it had to be purified (cleaned) to make it ready for the experiment. Berkelium has a half-life of only 310 days. This means that after 310 days, half of the berkelium will disappear because of radioactive decay. Oak Ridge could only make a small amount of berkelium (less than 30 milligrams). They had to work fast to purify it before it was lost because of radioactive decay.\nPhelps and two of her co-workers worked for three months to purify the berkelium. They did it and only lost less than one milligram of berkelium. Phelps called the purification a tedious process that involved many steps. After they were done, they sent the very pure berkelium to another laboratory in Dubna, Russia, called the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR). There, scientists fused the berkelium with calcium to create tennessine. They named the new element \"tennessine\" after Tennessee, the US state where Oak Ridge resides.\nIn 2013, Phelps became the manager of Oak Ridge's programs that make the isotopes nickel-63 and selenium-75. She has also studied isotopes of plutonium and neptunium, which are used by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to power spaceships. Phelps also studies isotopes that are used for medical research and treatments, like actinium, lanthanum, europium, and samarium. Phelps has studied electrodeposition with californium-252 for the Californium Rare Isotope Breeder Upgrade project (CARIBU). Oak Ridge makes most of the world's californium, which is used in cancer treatments.\nAwards and recognition.\nIn 2017, Phelps won the YWCA Knoxville Tribute to Women Technology, Research, and Innovation Award. This award recognizes \"local women who lead their fields in technology and excel in community service\". Phelps is a member of the American Chemical Society. Phelps helped start a program to teach robotics, drones, circuitry, and coding to inner city high school students in Knoxville, TN. In 2019, Phelps was featured in the IUPAC Periodic Table of Younger Chemists \"for her outstanding commitment to research and public engagement, as well as being an important advocate for diversity.\"\nWikipedia controversy.\nPhelps' contribution to the discovery of Element 117 was the subject of controversy after her article was twice deleted after discussion from the English Wikipedia."}

She has won many awards.\nBackground.\nWalton was born in Aberdare, in the Cynon Valley of Wales. She went to Park School in Aberdare, then Aberdare Girls' Grammar School. She lived for a year in Cardiff and went to Howell's School Llandaff. She finished her education at Oswestry School in Shropshire, and at the University of Lancaster. She lived in London for two years. Then she lived in Lancaster until 1997. She moved to Swansea, where she lived until moving to Canada in 2002.\nWalton speaks Welsh.\nWriting career.\nWalton has been writing since she was 13. Her first novel was published in 2000. Before that, she had been published in a number of role-playing game publications, such as \"Pyramid\". She often wrote with her husband at the time, Ken Walton. Walton was also active in online science fiction fandom, especially in the Usenet groups \"rec.arts.sf.written\" and \"rec.arts.sf.fandom\". Her poem \"The Lurkers Support Me in E-Mail\" is widely quoted on it and in other online arguments, often without her name attached.\nHer first three novels, \"The King's Peace\" (2000), \"The King's Name\" (2001), and \"The Prize in the Game\" (2002) were all fantasy. They happen in a world based on Arthurian Britain and the T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge's Ireland. Her next novel, \"Tooth and Claw\" (2003) was about dragons, but in the style of Anthony Trollope.\n\"Farthing\" was her first science fiction novel. It was a mystery and an alternate history in which the United Kingdom made peace with Adolf Hitler before the United States entered World War II. It was nominated for a Nebula Award, a Quill Award, the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for best science fiction novel, and the Sidewise Award for Alternate History. A sequel, \"Ha'penny\", was published in October 2007 by Tor Books, with the final book in the trilogy, \"Half a Crown,\" published in September 2008. \"Ha'penny\" won the 2008 Prometheus Award (jointly with Harry Turtledove's novel \"The Gladiator\") and has been nominated for the Lambda Literary Award.\nIn April 2007, Howard V. Hendrix stated that professional writers should never release their writings online for free. He claimed doing this made the writer a scab. Walton responded to this by declaring 23 April as International Pixel-Stained Technopeasant Day. Writers who disagreed with Hendrix could release their stories online all at once. In 2008 Walton celebrated this day by posting several chapters of an unfinished sequel to \"Tooth and Claw\" called \"Those Who Favor Fire.\"\nIn 2008, Walton began writing a column for Tor.com, mostly reviews of older books.\nPersonal life.\nWalton moved to Montreal, Quebec, Canada, after her first novel was published. She is married to Dr. Emmet A. O'Brien. She has one child. Her son, Alexander, was born in 1990.\nAwards.\nShe won the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer in 2002 and the World Fantasy award for her novel \"Tooth and Claw\" in 2004. Her novel \"Ha'penny\" was a co-winner of the 2008 Prometheus Award. Her novel \"Lifelode\" won the 2010 Mythopoeic Award. Her novel \"Among Others\" won the 2011 Nebula Award for Best Novel, and the 2012 Hugo Award for Best Novel, and is one of only seven novels to have been nominated for the Hugo Award, Nebula Award, and World Fantasy Award."}

It is sometimes called protoplasmic streaming or cyclosis.\nStreaming is often seen in large plant and animal cells. Cytoplasm moves inside the cells. The flow is driven by forces in the cytoskeleton. The function of the flow is probably to speed up transport of molecules and organelles around the cell. Cytoplasmic streaming is usually found in large cells, larger than about 0.1\u00a0mm. In smaller cells diffusion of molecules is rapid, but it slows as the cell size increases. Larger cells need flow to move nutrients inside them rapidly enough for efficient working."}

{"id": "694108", "revid": "1011873", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=694108", "title": "Forensic anthropology", "text": "Forensic anthropology is the analysis of human remains for the purpose of solving criminal cases and identifying the cause of death. In order to understand the death of a person, forensic anthropologists collect information from their bones. Forensic anthropologists use bone analysis to learn more about the person who died.\nMethods in bone analysis.\nAge.\n\"How old was the person when they died?\"\nScientists can discover the stages of growth and development that the bones were in when a person died to guess their age. Bones such as the femur can be measured in order to determine what stage of life a person was in. A child\u2019s bones would typically be shorter than an adult\u2019s bones. Another way to determine age is to look for cartilage, a tissue that is replaced by hard bone as a person gets older. Younger children will have more cartilage in their bones while adults will have more hard bone. Using these methods can help guess the age of a person when they died. \nCause of death.\n\"How did they die?\"\nCauses of death are usually related to injury and/or disease. Forensic anthropologists study bone to see if injuries were caused by bullets, blunt objects, sharp objects, or other weapons. They may also be able to see if a person had a disease that caused their death. Some diseases can cause changes in the structure of bone. Anemia can cause bones in the skull to flatten. Diseases like scurvy and rickets can cause bones to soften and bend. \nSex.\n\"What is the sex of the person who died?\"\n Sexual dimorphism is most obvious in the pelvis of the skeleton and in the skull. Forensic anthropologists can determine a persons's sex by studying these bones. Since females give birth, their pelvic bones are usually wider and fan out more to allow room for the baby. In terms of the skull, males generally have larger skulls than females due to the larger amount of muscle that male skulls have to support.\nTime of death.\n\"When did they die?\" \n In order to find out when a person died, anthropologists use taphonomy, or the study of the natural processes that affect the condition of human remains. Wind, water, soil erosion, and sand can all affect the state of bones. Anthropologists can create a timeline of when these factors to guess when a person died. \nAncestry.\n\"What is the individual\u2019s ancestry?\"\n Anthropologists can study ancestry by studying which features of the skeleton are more common in particular populations compared to others. Forensic anthropologists collect data by measuring different features of the cranium, such as width, length, shape and thickness. Once these measurements of the cranium are collected, the next step is to find an appropriate reference sample in the Forensic Anthropology Databank. This databank can group the data from the individual into an existing reference group, giving an indication of the individual's ancestry. \nBone Markings.\n\"Occupational Markers\"\nWhen looking at bones anthropologists look for markings left on bones caused by stress. These markings are called stress markers or occupation markers. Occupational markers can be found in cases where muscles or tendons insert into the cortical tissue of bone via the , or where there is hypertrophy of muscular attachments on the bones. The cause of the markers left are from repetitive activities over a long period of time. "}

They are one of the best-selling girl groups of all time. T-ara was formed in 2009. The group mainly makes dance-pop music. This is partly due to their partnership with composer Shinsadong Tiger, who has favored that genre. T-ara uses a wide variety of visual looks in their dance and performances.\nT-ara debuted in July 2009 with the single \"Lies\". Their first studio album was called the \"Absolute First Album\". It was released in December 2009 and lead to several hit songs. These included \"TTL (Time to Love)\", \"Bo Peep Bo Peep\", and \"You Drive Me Crazy\".\nIn 2011, T-ara released the song \"Roly-Poly\". It became the best-selling single of the year on the \"Gaon\" chart in South Korea. The group also became popular in Japan. Later that year they signed a contract with agency J-Rock to manage their sales in Japan. The contract was for USD 4.7 million. This was the most any Korean girl group had made in a foreign market at the time. T-ara went on to make a Japanese studio album called \"Jewelry Box\". This album reached number one on the \"Oricon\" weekly charts in Japan. Also in 2011, T-ara released the Korean album \"Black Eyes\". It lead to three number ones songs in a row. These were \"Cry Cry\", \"We Were in Love\" and \"Lovey-Dovey\".\nIn 2012, T-ara had a drop in popularity. The group was accused of disagreements and problems with one another. Soon after, Hwayoung left T-ara. Areum did the same a year after. After these issues, T-ara's albums and songs had mixed success in South Korea. As a result, T-ara changed their focus to China. In 2014, they made a cover of the Chopstick Brothers' song \"Little Apple\". After focusing on China, T-ara became one of the most popular K-pop groups in the country.\nIn 2017, the contracts of Soyeon and Boram were set to expire. On the other hand, Qri, Eunjung, Hyomin and Jiyeon had extended their contracts. This would reduce the members of the group from six to four. T-ara had intended to make one more album as a six-member group. However, a conflict with their management lead to a delay and it did not happen. T-ara's next release was as a four-member group. This was the EP called \"What's My Name?\" which was released in June 2017.\nHistory.\n2009\u20132010: Formation and debut.\nT-ara was formed by the record label Mnet Media, which is now known as Stone Music Entertainment. The original members of T-ara were Jiae, Jiwon, Eunjung, Hyomin and Jiyeon. They trained together for three years before their debut. The group's name is based on the word \"tiara\". The idea for the name was that they would be \"queens of the music industry\". Their first song came before their official debut as a group. It was \"Joheun Saram\" for the soundtrack of the \"Cinderella Man\" television show. One month before their official debut, Mnet Media changed some of the members of the group. Jiae and Jiwon left T-ara in early June 2009, and were replaced by Boram, Soyeon, and Qri. Then in early July 2009, T-ara was moved from Mnet Media to Core Contents Media. Core Contents Media is a subsidiary of Mnet Media, and is now known as MBK Entertainment.\nT-ara made their debut in July 2009 on the \"Radio Star\" talk show. Their first performance was on the \"M Countdown\" music show a few days later. It included the songs \"Geojitmal\" (or \"Lies\") and \"Norabollae?\". The performance had negative reviews by those who watched it. Some felt was that it was lip-synced and had an \"elementary school\" appearance. In response, the group decided that future performances would be live. In September 2009, T-ara made the song TTL \"(Time to Love)\" with the boy band Supernova. It became the first number one song for both groups and topped many online charts. A month later, T-ara and Supernova made the follow up song \"TTL Listen 2\".\nT-ara made their first studio album in November 2009, with the name \"Absolute First Album\". Core Contents Media held a survey to have the public help choose which song would be the title track. The choices were \"Bo Peep Bo Peep\" and \"Cheoeum Cheoreom\" (\ucc98\uc74c\ucc98\ub7fc, \"Like the First Time\"). Of the 9,000 people who took the survey, 53% chose \"Cheoeum Cheoreom\". However, \"Bo Peep Bo Peep\" was chosen as the title track. It made it to number four on the \"Gaon\" chart. \"Cheoeum Cheoreom\" made it to number ten. T-ara performed these songs live on the \"Music Bank\" television show on 4 December 2009. At the 24th Golden Disk Awards, T-ara won Rookie of the Year along with girl group 4minute.\nThe group won their first music show award with \"Bo Peep Bo Peep\" on the first day of 2010. The song went on to win five awards in total. T-ara intended to follow up with promotions for \"Cheoeum Cheoreom\" as well. But these had to be canceled in January 2010, as Soyeon got sick with H1N1. Later that month, T-ara had a cameo appearance in two episodes of the television show \"God of Study\".\nIn February 2010, the group re-released their debut album under the title \"Breaking Heart\". The digital release was on February 23. The two lead singles were \"Neo Ttaemune Michyeo\" (\ub108 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uccd0; \"I Go Crazy Because of You\") and \"Naega Neomu Apa\" (\ub0b4\uac00 \ub108\ubb34 \uc544\ud30c, \"I'm Really Hurt\"). \"Neo Ttaemune Michyeo\" made it to number one on the \"Gaon\" chart and \"Naega Neomu Apa\" made it to thirty-one. T-ara performed on the same day on \"M Countdown\". They went on to win three awards for \"Neo Ttaemune Michyeo\". The physical release of the album was March 3. It made it to number two on the weekly \"Gaon\" chart and number thirty-five on the yearly chart. T-ara performed \"Naega Neomu Apa\" on music shows in March and early April 2010.\nIn July 2010, T-ara added Hwayoung as a seventh member. The stated reason was to give other members some relief from their heavy schedules. It would also allow each member to be away for solo activities from time to time. In November 2010, the group starred in the third season of the reality show \"Hello Baby\". Later that month, T-ara released \"Wae Ireoni\". It is the lead single for their first extended play, which is called \"Temptastic\". \"Temptastic\" was released in December 2010, along with the single, \"Yayaya\". T-ara performed on \"Music Bank\" on December 3 with their new seventh member Hwayoung.

The album made it to number three on the Gaon chart. The song made it to number forty-five on the Billboard Korea K-Pop Hot 100 chart. The group then performed the song on the \"Music Bank\" television show.\nT-ara made a Japanese version of \"Bo Peep Bo Peep\" in September 2011. It made it to number one on the \"Oricon\" weekly chart. This made T-ara the first non-Japanese girl group to make it to number one on the \"Oricon\" chart. The song also made it to number one on the Billboard Japan Hot 100 chart.\nIn November 2011, T-ara made their third EP, \"Black Eyes\", which made it to number two on the \"Gaon\" charts. The album followed the release of the song \"Cry Cry\", which made it to number one on the Billboard Korea K-Pop Hot 100. \"Cry Cry\" also won two first-place awards on \"M Countdown\". The music video for \"Cry Cry\" had a billion Korean won budget and a thirty-minute drama story line. The group made their second Japanese song, a remake of \"Yayaya\" from their \"Temptastic\" EP, in November. It made it to number seven on the \"Oricon\" charts and number six on the Billboard Japan Hot 100.\nIn December 2011, the group held a three-day concert tour in Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka. By the end of the year, T-ara had become the second most popular girl group in Korea. Also in December, T-ara made a ballad with Davichi called \"Uri Saranghaetjanha\" (\uc6b0\ub9ac \uc0ac\ub791\ud588\uc796\uc544, \"We Were in Love\"). It was later included on T-ara's \"Funky Town\" re-release album. \"Uri Saranghaetjanha\" made it to number one on the \"Gaon\" chart and number two on the Billboard Korea K-Pop Hot 100. Both groups performed the song on SBS's \"Inkigayo\" television show.\nT-ara re-released \"Black Eyes\" under the title \"Funky Town\" in January 2012.

It made it to number one on both the \"Gaon\" and \"Billboard Korea\" charts.\nIn February 2012, Forbes Korea listed T-ara as number 17 in their list of \"Top 40 Power Celebrities\". In April, Core Contents Media announced that they would add two new members to T-ara. Areum joined T-ara in June 2012, bringing the group to eight members. The second new member was to be Dani, who was 14 years old at the time.

It made it to number five on the \"Gaon\" chart. The title track, also called \"Day by Day\", was released as a single on the same day. It made it to number two on the \"Gaon\" chart. On July 7, T-ara performed \"Day by Day\" live on \"Music Core\" with a 70-person orchestra. This was the first time Areum performed with the group.\n\"Bullying\" rumors and return to activity.\nIn late July 2012, T-ara held a concert in Japan. Hwayoung only performed one song due to a leg injury. Afterwards, one member of T-ara tweeted a message about showing determination. Later four of the other members agreed with her. After this Hwayoung and her twin sister (Hyoyoung) tweeted about a \"bad person\". This lead to rumors of conflict within the group. Some assumed that Hwayoung was being bullied. Soon after, Core Contents Media ended Hwayoung's contract and she left T-ara. The stated reason was that Hwayoung's actions were harming teamwork. The record label claimed that the bullying rumors were not a factor in the decision. The group stated that the rumors were not true but did confirm a conflict between Hwayoung and the others. Due to the rumors, the group put all activity on hold for a time. Their scheduled performances were postponed without a new date planned.\nIn September, T-ara resumed their activity as a group. In that month they released \"Mirage\", which was a re-issue of their \"Day by Day\" EP with additional songs. Two of the songs from the EP were also released as singles on the same day.

Hwayoung used the opportunity to state how hard it was for her, and her only support was her sister. This brought the rumors back to public attention. Soon after, a former staff member claimed that it had really been the twins who had \"bullied\" the other members. This person released texts that appeared to show Hyoyoung threatening Areum with physical harm.

They are rarely seen by humans, although these creatures are sometimes hooked on the nets of fishermen. It is a fish with the shape of an eel. \nIt is the only known species of the genus \"Eurypharynx\" and the family Eurypharyngidae. It belongs to the order Saccopharyngiformes, which are closely related to the true eels.\nThe pelican eel's most notable feature is its huge mouth, much larger than its body. They can be opened wide enough to swallow a fish much larger than itself. The pouch-like lower jaw is similar to that of a pelican, hence its name. It is also sometimes referred to as the umbrella mouth gulper. The stomach can stretch and expand to make room for large meals. The eel uses a long, whip-like tail for movement, and the end of the tail is bright enough to attract prey.\nThe pelican eel feeds primarily on fish, shrimp and plankton. It grows to about 0.61 to 1 metre in length and is found in all tropical and subtropical seas at depths ranging from 900 to 8,000 metres (3,000 to 27,000 feet)."}

Notable exceptions include Rwanda, which was a former Belgian colony, and Eritrea, which was an Italian colony where the British Empire controlled it only in World War II and shortly after (19411952).\nEnglish is the sole official language of the Commonwealth of Nations and the Commonwealth Games.

According to the Constitution of India, \"Hindi in the Devanagari script\" is the official language of the union; and English the 'subsidiary official language'; however, English is mandated (must be used) for the authoritative texts of all federal laws and Supreme Court decisions and (with Hindi) is one of the two languages of the Indian Parliament. English is taught in schools, and the quality and effectiveness of the teaching is extremely varied. English is used almost exclusively for higher education.\nThe linguistic makeup of Pakistan is also complex. While the national language is Urdu, English is an official language and used in business, government and law.\nCountry subdivisions.\nIn these country subdivisions, English has \"de jure\" official status, but English is not official in their relevant countries at the national level."}

It is a social democratic party and is considered to be centre-left. John Horgan has been the leader of the party since 2014. The party is a part of the federal New Democratic Party.\nThe party is the one governing the province right now. This is because there was a hung parliament after the 2017 elections and the BC Liberal Party did not win a motion of no confidence in the legislature. Instead, the BC NDP began a confidence and supply deal with the BC Green Party to form a minority government. Before that, the party governed British Columbia under six different premiers. They also won a majority government three times, in 1971, 1991, and 1996.\nHistory.\n2014\u2013present: Horgan as leader.\nThe leader before 2014 was Adrian Dix. He resigned from being the leader of the BC NDP in 2013. Because of this, there was an election in the party in 2014 to decide who would be the next leader. John Horgan was elected by acclamation (when there are no other candidates). Because he became leader, he also became the Leader of the Opposition in the legislature.\nThe first election that the NDP took part in while Horgan was the leader was the 2017 general election. The NDP won 41 seats in the election. The other parties that won seats were the Liberal Party (43 seats) and the Green Party (3 seats). The Liberal Party did not win enough seats to form a majority government so the first minority government in BC in 65 years was elected. This was a very close election. The Liberals won the popular vote by only 1566 votes. Because both parties did not have enough seats to form a majority government, the Greens held the balance of power. Both the Liberals and NDP began negotiating with the Greens to see if they would support a minority government by either of the parties. On 29 May, Horgan and the Greens announced that the Greens would support the NDPs in a confidence and supply deal. The Liberals lost a vote of no confidence vote by two votes to the Greens and NDP. Because of this, the Lieutenant Governor Judith Guichon asked Horgan to form government and become the next premier. Horgan became the first NDP premier in 16 years."}

Le Guin. All four stories happen in the future. They are stories from the planets Yeowe and Werel. Both planets are members of the Ekumen. The group of Ekumen planets is the background for many novels and short stories in Le Guin's Hainish Cycle. In 2017 it was reissued as an e-book, augmented with a fifth related story by Le Guin, as Five Ways to Forgiveness.\nSetting.\nThe stories in the book are set on two planets in a distant solar system, Werel and Yeowe, inhabited by humans placed there by the ancient Hainish. (This 'Werel' is not the same as the world called Werel in Le Guin's \"Planet of Exile\" and \"City of Illusions\".) Werel has a long history of institutional enslavement of its lighter-skinned ethnic groups by its darker-skinned ethnic groups (the latter's derogatory term for the former is \"dusties\"). When the Ekumen recontacted the Werelians, the shock spurred one of the Werelian nations, Voe Deo, to develop a space program and settle the other inhabitable planet in the system, Yeowe, transporting a primarily slave population to do so. Eventually the slaves on Yeowe conducted a successful revolt and gained their independence, an event that occurred in the fairly recent past of the four stories. The nations of Werel are nervous that the \"assets\" on that planet might attempt the same thing for themselves.\nThemes.\nThe common themes of the stories are the freedom and slavery. For thousands of years, the dark-skinned \"owners\" of Werel kept the light-skinned \"assets\" as slaves. Then things began to change after the colonized the second planet, Yeowe. The Yeowans gained freedom and fought to have their own government and identity. They wanted to enter the Ekumen of worlds.\nGender relations are another important theme in the stories. At first, only male slaves were transported to Yeowe. The culture there became extremely masculine. Homosexual relationships were important and had strong effect on later gender relations on Yeowe. \nPublication history.\nHarper Paperbacks published the book first in 1995. \"Betrayals\" first appeared in 1994 in \"Blue Motel\". The others appeared in the science fiction magazine \"Asimov's\" in 1994 and 1995.\n\"Four Ways to Forgiveness\" was published in 1995 in a leather-bound, signed edition by Easton Press.\n\"Five Ways to Forgiveness\" was published in 2017 by Penguin Random House. It was an e-book only from Rakuten Kobo and Library of America eBook Classics."}

His expedition landed on D\u00e9barquement Rock in the Dumoulin Islands at the northeast end of the archipelago on January 21, 1840. The station is run by the \"French Polar Institute Paul-\u00c9mile Victor\".\nHistory.\nThe first French Antarctic research station was at Port Martin, east of D'Urville. It was destroyed by fire on January 23, 1952. In 1952, a small base called Base Marret, was built on \u00cele des P\u00e9trels to study a rookery of emperor penguins. When the Port Martin station was destroyed, Base Marret was used in the winter of 1952/1953. A new main base, Dumont D'Urville station, was built on the same island and opened on January 12, 1956. This became the centre for French scientific research during the Antarctic International Geophysical Year 1957/1958. It has remained in active use ever since.\nThe station allows between 30 and 40 people to come ashore at one time. Ice and strong katabatic winds often prevent landings, either by boat or by helicopter. The station can accommodate about 30 people in winter and 120 during the summer. The icebreaker ship \"L'Astrolabe\" carries supplies and people to the station from the port of Hobart, Tasmania. It does five trips between November and March.\nThe Academy Award-winning documentary movie \"La Marche de l'empereur\", in English \"March of the Penguins\", was filmed in the region around this base."}

Christians worship on Sunday on which they believe Jesus was resurrected. Muslims worship on Friday on which they believe Adam was created.

On 14 March 2017, Prime Minister of Belize, Dean Barrow stated that he will call for early elections in November 2019. But in March 2018, Barrow pushed back and set it for 13 February 2020. On 22 May 2019, Barrow to the Media that he will strip off his call for early elections and insisted that there will be no General election before 1 November 2020 in Belize. Therefore, the next Belizean general election will be held on Sunday, 1 November 2020.\nDate\nThe Deadline for Candidate Nominations will be on 1 October 2020, with political Campaigning lasting for four Weeks until Polling day on 1 November 2020. On the Day of the Election, Polling stations across the Country will be open from 7 am, and closed at 10 pm. The Date chosen for the election made it the third to be held in November since 1979.\nIndividuals eligible to vote have to be registered to vote by Midnight on 26 September 2020. To be eligible to vote, Individuals had to be aged 18 or over; residing as a Commonwealth citizen at an address in Belize, or a Belizean citizen overseas who registered to Vote in the last 15 years and not legally excluded (on grounds of detainment in Prison, a Mental hospital, or on the run from Law enforcement) or disqualified from Voting. Anyone who qualified as an Anonymous elector will have until midnight on 26 October to Register.\nThe previous general election was held on 4 November 2015, and the new National Assembly was opened on 13 November 2015, which was also the date that the first sitting of the National Assembly of Belize began after the 2015 Belizean general election. According to Section 84 of the Constitution of Belize, the National Assembly of Belize (House of Representatives and Senate) must be dissolved every \u201cfive years from the date when the two Houses, first met\u201d unless dissolved sooner by the Governor-General of Belize upon the advice of the Prime Minister. A general election must be called within three months of a dissolution, meaning the latest possible date for Barrow to call the next Belizean general election is on 13 February 2021. If by any chance the next Belizean general election is not held by 13 February 2021, Barrow may be forced to vacate the office of Prime Minister, however he may still remain as Leader of the United Democratic Party (UDP), but he will have to make a Snap! decision on a Caretaker Prime Minister of Belize to formally announce a date for the next general election. The Caretaker Prime Minister must be from the ruling, UDP and must also be a Cabinet minister in government.\nDespite the five-year term of the National Assembly, three of the last four general elections have been called at least a year early. Both Prime Minister, Dean Barrow and Leader of the Opposition, Johnny Brice\u00f1o of the People\u2019s United Party (PUP) are on record supporting lowering the maximum five-year term of the National Assembly of Belize to four years. This was also one of the promises that Brice\u00f1o promised the People of Belize should the PUP be elected in the next election.\nBarrow first declared on 1 March 2016 that he would be stepping down as Prime Minister on 13 February 2020 and is currently finding a suitable successor to succeed him for that position. He also told the Media that the next election is likely to be held in early 2020 and also scheduled a UDP Leadership convention and election in May 2019. His remarks came as he was being questioned about the then pending United Democratic Party First Deputy Leadership election and convention. On 1 April 2017, at the Belize Chamber of Commerce and Industry annual general meeting Barrow narrowed down his departure as Prime Minister to less than a year and stated that he will retire in March 2018. He also narrowed down the date of the Leadership convention to 13 February 2018. He also declared that \u201cSince this will be my last opportunity to address your annual gathering, I close by saying how thankful I am for what has in the main been a constructive relationship with the Chamber\u201d.\nIt's important to point out that in early 2017, Barrow was ailing with excruciating back pain; a serious condition that he was enduring for some time. He could barely sit upright without visible signs of pain on his face, It is understandable then, that in such a poor and un-stabilised state of health and having archived a historic 3-peat in government, he would welcome retirement. But on 1 September 2018, things changed, after swiftly enduring the back pain for more than a year, Barrow with uncontrollable pain vested in his back, proceeded to Cuba and requested the Doctors in a hospital there to perform a Spinal Surgery, the Cuban Doctors did as they were told by Barrow and they also did a phenomenal job. The surgery was a success and after one week of rest and recovery, Barrow returned to perfect health. So after the surgery was over, Barrow rescheduled his retirement once again this time to December 2019 and hinted he could do so earlier and also rescheduled the date for the UDP\u2019s Leadership convention back to May 2019.\nOn 18 November 2018, Barrow\u2019s cabinet by way of a strange press release urged him to remain as Prime Minister until the 2020 general election on 1 November 2020. They also urged him to remain as Leader of the UDP until February 2020. He said he will take that move and eventually for the final time, rescheduled the convention to February 2020. A significant walking back from his declaration at the 2017 Chamber meeting. On 4 December 2018, Minister of Human Development and Minister of Social Transformation, Anthony Martinez reveled to the media on why he and the Cabinet urged Barrow to remain as Prime Minister until 2020. Martinez stayed on course saying that Barrow ultimately took the decision and that the goal is for the currently leadership to take the UDP into a fourth term in government. A fourth term will be historic for the UDP as no political party in post-independence Belize has ever embarked on a fourth term. Plus this will also be a major upset for the majority of Belizeans who are expecting the PUP to cling win at the Next election.\nTimetable\nThe key dates are:\nMonday 10 February\nMinister of National Security, John Saldivar elected as Leader of the UDP he swears in the Title of UDP Leader-elect while Barrow remains Official Leader. Saldivar defeats his opponent Deputy prime minister, Patrick Faber receiving 342 votes of the 569 votes cast. Faber only received 227 votes.\nTuesday 11 February\nBarrow continues to lead the UDP despite Sunday\u2019s Leadership convention, the Party confirmed via Press release in the Evening.\nWednesday 12 February\nJohn Saldivar resigns as UDP Leader-elect and suspended indefinitely as Minister of National Security by Barrow after he was found guilty of taking Money from accused United States Fraudster and Businessman, Lev Dermen and associates. In the morning of that day, Barrow called a Meeting in which all 31 UDP Standard-Bareers and Member of Parliaments were in attendance. There, he asked Saldivar to submit to Barrow his resignation Leader-Elect of the UDP and Saldivar agreed to do so. Soon after, Barrow issued a Statement to the Nation on the recent developments in the Party.\nThursday 13 February\nJohn Saldivar formally resigns from Cabinet, in light of mounting allegations and calls for his Resignation. As a result, Saldivar is no longer Belize\u2019s Minister of National Security and is no longer on the indefinite suspension he was placed on yesterday. This afternoon Saldivar submitted his letter of resignation to Prime minister, Dean Barrow.\nFriday 14 February\nFormer UDP Leader-elect and Minister of National Security, John Saldivar issued a Statement confessing that he did receive Campaign contributions from International fraudster Lev Derman.\nSaturday 15 February\nThe People\u2019s United Party called for Press conference where it unveiled it's policies along with holding a National demonstration against Corruption and other ills. Leader Johnny Brice\u00f1o sounded the clarion in the Morning as the fallout from from the John Saldivar saga continues to unravel. The PUP also introduced it's manifesto for the 2020 Election.\nSunday 16 February\nNew Financial year starts. Barrow is expected to leave office as Prime minister and UDP Leader, unless he wishes to stay on which is quite unlikely and will affect his party\u2019s chances of winning the next Election.\nSaturday 26 September\nDeadline to register for Voting closes by Midnight.\nThursday 1 October\nNominations for Candidates closes and official start of Campaigning.\nSaturday 3 October\nCandidates lists are Published for each Constituency.\nMonday 26 October\nDeadline to register for Anonymous electors closes by Midnight.\nSunday 1 November\nPolling Day - polls open 7 am to 10 pm\nMonday 2 November\nResults announced for all the 31 Constituencies. End of Purdah.\nFriday 13 November\nFirst Meeting of the new National Assembly of Belize, for the formal Election of a Speaker of the House of Representatives (Belize) and the swearing-in of Members, ahead of the State opening of the new National Assembly\u2019s first Session.\nSunday 15 November\nState Opening of Parliament.\nBackground\nUnited Democratic Party\nThe rulling United Democratic Party, which has been in power since 7 February 2008, will attempt to win a fourth consecutive general election. However, both major parties will be contesting this election with first-time leaders. UDP Leader and Prime Minister, Dean Barrow has stated he will step down from both positions on 2 November 2020, after the new Prime Minister of Belize has been officially sworn-in by Govonor-General, Colville Young. The UDP has initially scheduled a May 2019 convention and election, but after Barrow\u2019s cabinet urged him to stay on as Prime Minister and Leader of the UDP, he pushed back that date in January 2019 to February 2020. Thus the United Democratic Party Leadership Convention and election will take place in February 2020. On 10 August 2019, The UDP\u2019s National Party Council met and set the date of the UDP\u2019s leadership convention and election on 9 February 2019. The venew will be at the Belize Civic Centre, according to the party organ, The Guardian. Deputy Prime Minister of Belize, Patrick Faber and Minister of National Security and Defence, John Saldivar will contest the position of, UDP Leader through other candidates can apply. Minister of Health, Pablo Marin will contest the position of, Deputy Leader of the UDP. Minister of Natural Resources, Hugo Patt is also expected to contest for Deputy Leader as well. Patt and Minister of Foreign Affairs, Wilfred Elrington was mentioned as possible candidates to contest the position of, UDP Leader. However, both declined the offer back in June 2018. On 5 June 2019, Belize Breaking News (BBN) published an article stating that the UDP has a high chance of capitalising and making history by wining a fourth consecutive term come 2020, given the results of the 2019 Belizean territorial dispute referendum went in the favour of the UDP. The UDP was Long campaigning for an \u201cYes\u201d vote to bring Guatemala\u2019s claim to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), while the PUP eyed the \u201cNo\u201d vote while some of its Politicians still supported \u201cYes\u201d as they thought that was the right thing to do. Nevertheless, results are results and this could determine who would win the next general election. The UDP, which has already served an unprecedented three consecutive terms has gone the extra mile in securing their mandate. A victory in the next election would be monumental as the party navigates new Leadership with the departure of several senior members. The UDP Cabinet, though marred by waves of Scandal and revelations of systemic Corruption across Government departments throughout its 11-year reign, has withered the political Storms. The UDP looks to continue its decade-Long Dominance (ethology) over Belizean Politics.\nPeople\u2019s United Party\nThe People\u2019s United Party has yet to prove it can win a general election since its last victory in 2005, 14 years ago; a virtual eon in politics. Despite gains in Belize City in 2015, most notably Kareem Musa\u2019s upset win over Belize City Mayor, Darrell Bradley in the Caribbean Shores constituency, the opposition PUP remained at 11 seats overall thanks to losses in the Cayo and Corozal Districts. However, after Former Senate President, Lee Mark Chang bested opponent Leila Peyrefitte in the UDP convention held in Carribean Shores constituency, there have been rumours that if the win indicated that Caribbean Shores would go red next year, also given that the \u201cYes\u201d vote prevailed in Caribbean Shores for the 2019 Referendum. Area Representative, Kareem Musa said that he did not ask a single voter to vote yes or no in the referendum and that he is confident of next victory at polls. The PUP will run with Johnny Brice\u00f1o as it's Leader. Francis Fonseca, who led the party during the past two general elections, resigned from leadership soon after the party\u2019s 2015 loss. Although Brice\u00f1o served a previous term as PUP leader from 2008 to 2011, he has yet to led the party during a General election and do what Fonseca could not, steer the party into a victory. On the morning of Brice\u00f1o swearing-in as Leader of the party."}

Migrants from the north who wanted to trade with the Portuguese in the south founded the kingom. \nIt was ruled by a king called a Bai or Obai. The sub-kingdoms within the state were ruled by nobles titled \"Gbana\". The Koya Kingdom kept and maintained diplomatic relations with the British and French in the 18th century. Children of Temne nobles were allowed to get western educations abroad. Koya also traded with Islamic states to its north and had Muslims within its borders.\nUnder Nembanga's reign (1775\u20131793), the Koya kingdom signed a treaty which made it possible for the establishment of a British colony on the peninsula of Sierra Leone in 1788.\nKoya participated in the trans-atlantic slave trade, though sources state that such commerce was much more privatized than in other kingdoms.

Koya lost the northern shoreline of Sierra Leone to the British and Port Loko to the Susu. However, they remained a power in the region. In 1815, the Temne fought another war with the Susu and regained the port. In 1841, the Temne defeated the Loko tribe of Kasona on the Mabaole River dispersing many of the people. In response to a British bombardment, the kingdom expelled the Church Missionary Society missionaries operating at Magbela in 1860.\nThe kingdom became a British protectorate August 31, 1896.

Its capital was located in San Fernando during most of its existence. For some years, Curic\u00f3 and Rancagua were capitals of Colchagua.\nHistory.\nThe province of Colchagua was one of the former, primitive eight provinces of Chile (Coquimbo, Aconcagua, Santiago, Colchagua, Maule, Concepci\u00f3n, Valdivia, and Chilo\u00e9) created by the federal laws of 31 January 1826. Its territory comprised former delegations of Colchagua, Curic\u00f3 and Talca. The province was sanctioned by the 1828 Constitution.\nDuring its early years, Colchagua was divided into the departments of San Fernando (cap. San Fernando), Curic\u00f3 (cap. Curic\u00f3), and Talca (cap. Talca).\nIn 1833, a new Constitution reorganized the country, creating departments, subdelegations and districts as lower entities of provinces. Later that year, by law dated August, the department of Talca was separated to create the province of Talca, and in 1834, the department of Caupolic\u00e1n was created, with Rengo as its capital.\nAlthough the title of provincial capital was disputed by San Fernando, Curic\u00f3 and Talca, depending on the desired residence of the intendant, a September 1840 decree established San Fernando as the definitive capital.\nIn 1865, the department of Curic\u00f3 was separated from Colchagua, in order to create the province of Curic\u00f3.\nOn 17 September 1925, by Law Decree N.\u00b0 529, the department of San Vicente was created, separated from Caupolic\u00e1n.\nIn 1928, the government of Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo decided to reorganize the provinces of Chile, by Decree with Law Force N.\u00b0 8.582 dated 28 January 1929. The new province of Colchagua incorporated the departments of Rancagua (cap. Rancagua) and Cachapoal (cap. Peumo), originally from the province of O'Higgins, and the department of Santa Cruz (cap. Santa Cruz), which belonged to the province of Curic\u00f3.\nBecause of public discontent, the former provinces of O'Higgins and Colchagua were re-established by Law 5.376, in January 1934. Colchagua kept the departments of San Fernando and Santa Cruz. In 1973, under the government of Salvador Allende, the department of Cardenal Caro was created (cap. Marchig\u00fce).\nIn July 1974, a new reform took place, directed by the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, who created regions. On 1 January 1976, the new VI Regi\u00f3n (Sixth Region) came into existence, with the territory of former provinces of O'Higgins and Colchagua. Former departments of San Fernando, Santa Cruz and Cardenal Caro were supressed. In 1979, the region was renamed VI Regi\u00f3n del Libertador General Bernardo O'Higgins (Sixth Region of Liberator General Bernardo O'Higgins, in short, Region of O'Higgins).

Both claim to constitute the official government of Yemen. Houthi forces currently controlling the capital Sana\u02bda, allied with forces loyal to the former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, have clashed with the forces loyal to Hadi who are based in Aden. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant have also carried out attacks, with AQAP controlling swathes of territory in the hinterlands, and along stretches of the coast. On 21 March 2015, after taking over Sana\u02bda and the Yemeni government, the Houthi-led Supreme Revolutionary Committee declared a general mobilization to overthrow Hadi and expand their control by driving into southern provinces. The Houthi offensive, allied with military forces loyal to Saleh, began fighting the next day in Lahij Governorate. By 25 March, Lahij fell to the Houthis and they reached the outskirts of Aden, the seat of power for Hadi's government. Hadi fled the country the same day. At the same time, a coalition led by Saudi Arabia launched military operations by using air strikes to restore the former Yemeni government. The United States provided intelligence and logistical support for the campaign. \nAccording to the UN and other sources, from March 2015 to December 2017, between 8,670\u201313,600 people were killed in Yemen, including more than 5,200 civilians. They estimated more than 50,000 have died as a result of an ongoing famine due to the war. With Iran suporting the Huthi and Saudi Arabia opposing them, the conflict has been widely seen as a proxy war and a means for Saudi Arabia to combat Iranian influence in the region. \nIn 2018, the United Nations warned that 13 million Yemeni civilians face starvation in what it says could become \"the worst famine in the world in 100 years.\" The international community sharply condemned the Saudi Arabian-led bombing campaign, which included widespread bombing of civilian areas. The bombing campaign has killed or injured an estimated 17,729 civilians as of March 2019 according to the Yemen Data Project. Despite this, the crisis gained less international media attention than the Syrian civil war. The US has been providing bombs to aid the Saudi forces and airstrikes in Yemen. In March 2019, this led the US senate to pass a resolution to end US support of Saudi Arabia. It was vetoed by President of the United States Donald Trump, and in May, the Senate failed to override the veto."}

It is the 40th highest mountain in the world. It is also known as Kangkar P\u00fcnzum. The name means \"White Peak of the Three Spiritual Brothers\". No one has ever made it to the top of Gangkhar Puensum. It is the highest mountain in the world that has never been climbed.\nDetails about the mountain have not always been correct. It was first measured in 1922, but not all maps showed the same height. There was also confusion on the location of the mountain. Some maps showed it in different places than others. Due to this confusion, the first team to try to climb it wasn\u2019t even able to find it at all. The present listed height and location are from China, as Bhutan has not surveyed the mountain.\nA few people have tried to climb the mountain in the past, but none succeeded. In 1994, Bhutan made a law that no one could climb above . Then in 2003, they banned all climbing. As long as the ban is in place, it is unlikely that anyone will reach the top from the Bhutan side. While it may be possible to start the climb in Tibet, China has not allowed it. Tibet is an autonomous region of the People's Republic of China (PRC). This is a political decision due to issues in the border region between China and Bhutan. There is a border dispute between the two countries."}

In other words, it is a way of integrating along the complex plane.\nMore specifically, given a complex-valued function formula_1 and a contour formula_2, the contour integral of formula_1 along formula_2 is written as formula_5 or formula_6.\nCalculating contour integrals with the residue theorem.\nFor a standard contour integral, we can evaluate it by using the residue theorem. This theorem states that \nformula_7\nwhere formula_8 is the residue of the function formula_9, formula_2 is the contour located on the complex plane. Here, formula_9 is the integrand of the function, or part of the integral to be integrated.\nThe following examples illustrate how contour integrals can be calculated using the residue theorem.\nMultivariable contour integrals.\nTo solve multivariable contour integrals (contour integrals on functions of several variables), such as surface integrals, complex volume integrals and higher order integrals, we must use the divergence theorem. For right now, let formula_14 be interchangeable with formula_15. These will both serve as the divergence of the vector field written as formula_16. This theorem states that:\nformula_17\nIn addition, we also need to evaluate formula_18, where formula_19 is an alternate notation of formula_20. The divergence of any dimension can be described as\nThe following examples illustrate the use of divergence theorem in the calculation of multivariate contour integrals.\nExample 1.\nLet the vector field formula_22 be bounded by the following conditions\nThe corresponding double contour integral would be set up as such:\nWe now evaluate formula_24 by setting up the corresponding triple integral:\nFrom this, we can now evaluate the integral as follows:\nformula_26\nExample 2.\nGiven the vector field formula_27 and formula_28 being the fourth dimension. Let this vector field be bounded by the following:\nTo evaluate this, we use the divergence theorem as stated before, and evaluate formula_24 afterwards.

She was born with Down Syndrome and became deaf as an infant. From age 7 she lived in an institution for 35 years. She did not begin her art career until her mid-40s, then worked until her death 18 years later.\nBiography.\nJudith was born into a middle-class family in Cincinnati, Ohio, along with her non-identical twin sister Joyce. Unlike Joyce, Judith was born with Down Syndrome. As a baby, Judith was sick with scarlet fever, which caused her to lose her hearing. This fact remained undiagnosed until much later in her life. She never learned to speak or use sign language. \nAt the age of seven, Judith was sent to live in a state care facility in Ohio. She stayed in that institution for thirty-five years, until her sister. In 1987 Judith was enrolled at the Creative Growth Art Center in Oakland, California which supports people with developmental disabilities. There, Judith discovered her passion and talent for abstract fiber art.\nThe story of the Scott sisters' lives, \"Entwined \u2013 Sisters and secrets in the life of artist Judith Scott\", has been written by her twin sister. It was published in 2016.\nArtistic style.\nEach day, she would spend hours wrapping found objects in colored yarn, string, paper and fabric strips. Some of the resulting sculptures were completed during a day\u2019s labor; others over weeks or months. While Scott had no style per se, each of the wrapped sculptures has its distinct personality; all convey a sense of inner life. The originating object is mostly unrecognizable, as in Franz West\u2019s more famous plaster or epoxy \u201cAdaptives,\u201d which similarly incorporate largely unidentifiable items and are likewise portable. \nExhibitions.\nAt the Brooklyn Museum, some 45 Scott sculptures are on display, resting on a low white platform. On the wall are 15 mixed-media drawings completed at the beginning of her art-making career. Scott never indicated a \u201ccorrect\u201d way to show the three-dimensional works, so they are displayed casually, as she might have worked on them."}

They all went to the Ohio Valley or Eastern Canada instead.\nMorris County was made for real in 1739, from parts of Hunterdon County.

Some Christian radio stations play Christian music. Some Christian radio stations have talk or news programs.\nHistory.\nSince the early days of broadcasting, some stations have included Church services, sermons, and Christian Music. The first AM experimental broadcast was on Christmas Eve, and included a violin playing religious music. Christian programs were common by the time radio became popular in the 1920s. \nChristian Radio Formats.\nChristian Radio can follow many different formats. In fact, for most every secular radio format there is a corresponding Christian format. The only exception may be the \"shock jock\" format. \nSome of the popular Christian formats would be \"Oldies\" (traditional music), Black Gospel, Southern Gospel, \"Rock\", Talk, Worship, sermons, etc. In addition many Christian stations use languages other than the majority language of their country. Because of these language and format possibilities, a large city may have a dozen or more Christian stations without much overlap in their programming. \nChristian Radio Viewpoints.\nWhile Evangelical groups have by far the most stations, there are also Roman Catholic radio stations. Liberal Christian groups make some programs, but few own their own stations, preferring to buy time on other, usually secular stations. \nTarget Audience.\nSome Christian stations seek to target a particular group such as youth, elderly, women or other groups. Many Christian stations produce programs that are mainly of interest to those who are already committed Christians. Others seek to do evangelism, and have music and programs that might attract those who are not already Christians.\nFunding.\nMany Christian Stations operate as non-commercial stations. They get most of their financial support from listeners or those who donate in order to influence the listeners. Other stations operate as commercial stations, that is, they carry advertisements to cover the cost of the operation. \nGrowth in numbers.\nThe number of radio stations in the U.S. with a Christian format has grown greatly in the 21st Century. This is partly because some AM stations could not compete as commercial stations and were bought by Christian groups to operate as non-commercial or semi-commercial Christian stations. Also more opportunities for FM stations came about with changes in FCC rules. Many countries which used to have only government stations began to allow other groups to have radio stations. This increased the number of Christian stations outside the U.S.\nInternational Stations.\nThere are many Christian stations that operate with a Missionary purpose. They broadcast the Christian message to countries and groups where there are large numbers of persons who are not Christians, or who are Christians with limited access to churches or Christian teaching. These stations consider themselves \"Missionary Radio\" stations, as opposed to Stations that mainly serve the needs of persons in majority Christian countries. Another distinction between Christian radio and Missionary Radio is that with Missionary Radio, the funding almost never comes from the people being served, whereas in Christian radio is often is from them. \nIn the past when many countries, for example the Communist block, limited Christian activities, the Missionary stations were very active in broadcasting in many languages and to many places.Some of these countries now allow more local Christian activity. However other countries still limit the work of missionaries and so radio is still used. In some countries only government stations can operate. Stations outside the country are the only way to provide service into those countries. To provide the longer range coverage, shortwave is often used by Missionary stations, although super power AM is also sometimes used."}

Parental infanticide researchers have found that mothers are far more likely than fathers to be the perpetrators of neonaticide and slightly more likely to commit infanticide in general. Basically, in earlier ages, women and girls were not considered equal to men. People started killing their daughters when they were born.\nIn the past, and in many societies, it was a widespread practice, permitted by different cultures around the world. Nowadays, it is considered to be an unethical crime; however, it is still performed.\nIn many societies, especially in the past, infanticide was routinely used as a way to control and regulate the population. As such, it particularly affected female children, since having fewer women meant having a lower rate of reproduction.\nSome societies still perform infanticide due to beliefs derived from biological causes. For example, in some communities in Benin (Africa) children born with a disability are killed, as negative magical effects or evil spells are attributed to their birth.\nUnwanted pregnancies are the most common cause of infanticide nowadays. This may be because women or families do not have enough resources to look after their children and because, in many parts of the world, there is no access to modern forms of birth control or medical abortion. Thus, many women experience unwanted pregnancies, or they just want a certain kind of child, with specific characteristics, which they believe can be more helpful in their circumstances."}

Together, the parks contain ,\nThe parks have old-growth temperate rainforests. The four parks include 45% of all remaining coast redwood forests. These total at least . These trees are the tallest and one of the biggest trees on Earth. In addition to the redwood forests, the parks protect much nature within the area.\nIn 1850, old-growth redwood forest covered more than of the California coast. The northern part of that area was noticed by lumbermen and others when a gold rush brought them to the region. As they did not become rich from gold, these men decided to log the gigantic trees. The timber went to San Francisco and other places on the West Coast.\nAfter many decades of logging, efforts were started in conservation. In the 1920s the Save the Redwoods League worked to save old-growth redwoods. Due to their efforts, a number of State Parks were formed. Then in 1968, Redwood National Park was created. By that time nearly 90% of the original redwood trees had been logged. The National Park Service (NPS) and the California Department of Parks and Recreation (CDPR) combined the management of Redwood National Park with the three Redwood State Parks in 1994.\nThe ecosystem of the RNSP preserves a number of threatened animal species. These include the tidewater goby, Chinook salmon, northern spotted owl, and Steller's sea lion. The United Nations made the parks a World Heritage Site on 5 September 1980.

This is often combined with the fear of being revealed as a \"fraud\" or \"imposter\" who does not deserve the things they have obtained in life.\nCharacteristics.\nPeople experiencing the imposter syndrome feel they do not belong in their environment, because they think others know more and can do things better. This often happens in relation to studying or work, but can also apply to personal relationships with other people. In the case of relationships with other people, those with imposter syndrome worry that they are not good at what they do as well. They believe they are not a good partner, colleague or friend and that they have tricked others into liking them.\nImposter syndrome is also feeling colleagues and authorities value you more than they should. Praise (when someone says you did well) often results in being shocked and not believing in what is said about you. Another trait is thinking your achievements and success are effects of luck, mistakes or bias. That is why these do not convince people that they are intelligent and still cause them to believe they do not deserve to be where they are. These people often refer to themselves as \u2018impostors\u2019.\nImpostors worry that someone else will discover their true nature. This would have negative effects, like losing a job or others\u2019 trust. To avoid this, they try to prevent anyone from finding out.\nConnections.\nThose with impostor syndrome have a high chance of also being perfectionists. This means they wish to do everything without errors. They also very often procrastinate (put off things to do for later), because when they do, whether they succeed or fail, they can think it was because of good or bad luck.\nThe clinical symptoms associated with imposter syndrome include anxiety, fear of failure, depression, decreased mental health, lower self-esteem, feelings of guilt and humiliation and frustration. \nThe imposter syndrome has also been found to be linked to some traits from the Big Five personality traits. Negativity, depression and anxiety are common in both neuroticism (one of the Big Five character traits) and imposter phenomenon. The two are then highly linked together. People with imposter syndrome have low conscientiousness (another Big Five character trait) because of low self self-esteem and low feeling of competence (being able to do things successfully).\nFactors.\nSome people are more likely to experience imposter syndrome. These include: \nGender differences.\nSome researchers say women experience feeling like an impostor more often than men, but others say they experience it equally frequently.\nThe ones that agree have found that women on average believe they are able to successfully do tasks less than men. When they do succeed they think it is because of external (not relating to them directly) causes, like luck. When they fail, women think it is because they do not have the necessary abilities. With men, it is the opposite case. When they succeed, they think it is because of internal (directly related to them) causes like being smart and their abilities. However, when they fail they blame it on bad luck or the task being too hard.\nOther researchers have found that men are less likely than women to accept and deal with imposter syndrome. They feel the need to have a typical \u2018man\u2019s job\u2019, like a mechanic or engineer, and not the ones assumed to be more of a \u2018woman\u2019s job\u2019, like a nurse or teacher. Having an imposter syndrome, they avoid feeling different and without talent or abilities in the more woman-typical job. They would rather pick a job where they will not differ as much.\nManagement.\nMany things have been suggested to be done to reduce the feelings of being an imposter. "}

It was caused by the buildup of tension between countries. The three long-term causes were the formation of empires, the accumulation of armies and weapons, and alliances. The trigger cause was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.\nOne of the causes of World War I was that countries wanted to form empires. This is called \"imperialism\". From the late 1800s, the power of an empire was judged by its size. Britain had the largest empire, with lots of territories overseas, such as India. People would say \"The sun never sets on the British Empire\" because there were British holdings all over the world, so it was always day in some part of the empire. \nIn order to conquer far-away places on different continents, imperial powers built large armies and navies and the cultures valued fighting. This is called \"militarism\". Countries spent large amounts of money in a short amount of time to build these armies. In the early 1900s, Britain's navy was the biggest. This made their traditional rival, Germany want to make a big navy too. When Britain launched a new kind of ship called the Dreadnought, Germany launched their own version of the Dreadnought to compete with Britain.\nThe third long-term cause was \"alliances\". The bigger countries of Europe formed two sides. They were called the \"Triple Entente\" and the \"Triple Alliance.\" The Triple Entente included France, Great Britain, and Russia. The Triple Alliance was Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. Great Britain, France, and Russia were worried about the growing strength of Germany, so they promised to help each other if any one of them was attacked. Germany objected to this arrangement because, with France and Great Britain on the west and Russia on the east, Germany would be surrounded. So Germany formed an alliance with Austria-Hungary and Italy.\nThe trigger cause of World War I was the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, who was next in line to be emperor of Austro-Hungary. He was killed in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914. He and his wife, Countess Sophie, both died. They were making a state visit to the capital of Bosnia. A Serbian secret society, the Black Hand, wanted Bosnia to break free from the Austro-Hungarian Empire and be a country by itself. They were supported by Russia. The Archduke and his wife arrived at 9:30 a.m. and got into an open-topped car at the train station. Members of the Black Hand had learned the route they would take to their destination. When the time came, one of them threw a hand grenade at the Archduke's car. It bounced off the back of the car, which drove on. It injured the driver and passengers in the car behind the Archduke instead. When the Archduke realized he was a target he immediately abandoned his planned trip and went to visit a hospital instead. However, the driver took a wrong turn up Franz Joseph Street and had to reverse. By chance, he slowed down in front of Gavrilo Princip, leader of the Black Hand. Seeing that this was his only chance to carry out his plan, he pulled his gun and fired, killing the Archduke, Sophie, who had been pregnant at the time. Gavrilo Princip was arrested and beaten up for this rebellious act.\nAustria-Hungary was outraged that the heir to their throne had been killed. They blamed Serbia and bombed the capital, Belgrade. The Serbians tried to surrender, but Austria-Hungary bombed them anyway. Serbia's ally, Russia, then helped to defend it from attack. Soon after, Germany, Austria-Hungary's ally, declared war on Russia as well as starting to move towards French territory, ready to invade, attacking Belgium as they progressed. The French soldiers started to get ready for a German invasion. When Germany declared war on France, then under the terms of the Triple Entente, Britain then ordered Germany to stop attacking Belgium, who was neutral during the war. When the Germans didn't retreat from Belgium, Britain declared war on Germany. Finally, Austria-Hungary declared war on Russia and WWI commenced. \nOn Franz Joseph street there is a placard with what happened on the street in June 28, 1914."}

{"id": "698777", "revid": "22653", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=698777", "title": "Battle royale game", "text": "A battle royale game is an online multiplayer video game genre that combines the survival, exploration, and scavenging (collecting useful items from what looks like waste) in a game where only one can remain, also known as a last-man-standing game. Battle royale games usually have a large number of players, ranging from tens to hundreds, that start with almost nothing who then try to defeat all other enemies/players while trying to stay inside of a play zone or \"safe area\" that gets smaller over time. The winner is the last player or team alive. The name for the genre is taken from the 2000 Japanese movie \"Battle Royale\", which has a similar theme of a last-man-standing competition in a shrinking play zone.\nThe genre's origins arose from mods for large-scale online survival games like \"Minecraft\" and \"ARMA 2\" in the early 2010s. By the end of the decade, the genre became a cultural phenomenon, with standalone games such as \"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds\", \"Fortnite Battle Royale\" and \"Apex Legends\" each having received tens of millions of players within months of their release.\nConcept.\nBattle royale games are played between a lot of single players, pairs of two players or a number of small teams (usually 3-5 players). In each match, the goal is to be the last player or team standing by defeating all other enemies. A match starts by placing the player-characters into a large map space, typically by having all players skydive from a large aircraft within a short time limit. The map may have the players randomly placed or allow players to have some control over where they start. All players start with very little equipment, giving no player an obvious advantage at the start. Equipment, usually used for fighting, survival or transport, is randomly placed around the map, often at landmarks on the map, such as within buildings in ghost towns. Players need to search the map for these items while trying to avoid being killed by other players, who cannot be visually marked or revealed either on-screen or on the map, making the player use only their own eyes and ears to find their positions. Equipment from defeated players can usually be taken as well. These games often include some mechanic to push enemies closer together as the game progresses, usually taking the form of a safe zone that slowly gets smaller, with players outside of the zone eventually being killed.\nNormally, battle royale players are only given one life to play; any players who die are not allowed to respawn. Games with team support may allow players to enter a temporary, near-death state once health is depleted, giving allies the opportunity to revive them before they give out or are finished off by an enemy. The match is over when only one player or team is left, and the game usually provides some type of reward, such as in-game currency used for cosmetic items, to all players based on how long they survived. The random nature of starting point, item placement, and safe area reduction lets the battle royale genre to challenge players to think and react quickly and improve strategies throughout the match as to be the last man/team standing. In addition to standalone games, the battle royale concept may also be used as part of one of many game modes within a larger game, or may be used as a user-created mod created for another game.\nThere are many changes that can be placed on top of the fundamentals of battle royale. For example, \"Fortnite\" introduced a temporary mode in an event which is 50-versus-50 player mode in its \"Fortnite Battle Royale\" free-to-play game; players are assigned one of the two teams, and work with their teammates to get resources and weapons towards making forts as the safe area of the game shrinks down, with the goal to defeat all the players on the other team.\nHistory.\nMainstream popularity (2018\u2013present).\nWith the success of \"Battlegrounds\" and \"Fortnite\", the battle royale genre expanded greatly. Major publishers, including Electronic Arts Activision, and Ubisoft have noticed the impact of the growing genre and impact on their future plans. Activision's \"Call of Duty\" series features a battle royale mode titled \"Blackout\" in its 2018 game, ', while EA's \"Battlefield V\" also includes a battle royale mode. Some other established games added battle royale-inspired gamemodes in updates, such as \"Grand Theft Auto Online\", \"Paladins\", \"Dota 2\", \"Battlerite\", and '. In February 2019, EA released a free-to-play battle royale game called \"Apex Legends\", which exceeded 50 million player accounts within a month of its release.\nThe battle royale approach has also been used in games from genres not normally associated with shooter games. \"Tetris 99\" is a 2019 game released by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch that has 99 players in a game of \"Tetris\" at the same time. Players can \"attacks\" on other players for each line they complete, attempting to become the last player standing. While there have been several battle royale games, the genre has seen a number of games have bursts of popularity before their player count drops. In contrast to other multiplayer-only games, the large number of players typically involved in battle royale games generally require a large enough concurrent player base for matchmaking in a reasonable amount of time. \"The Culling\", by Xaviant Studios, was released in early access in 2016, and was designed to be a streaming-friendly battle royale mode for 16 players. However, following the release of \"Battlegrounds\", \"The Culling\" lost much of its player base, and a few months after releasing the full version of the game, Xaviant announced they were ending further development on it to move onto other projects. \"Radical Heights\" by Boss Key Productions was launched in April 2018 but within two weeks had lost 80% of its player base. \"SOS\", a battle royale game released by Outpost Games in December 2017, had its player counts drop into the double-digits by May 2018, leading Outpost to announced the game's closure by November 2018.\nThe Chinese government, through its Audio and Video and Numeral Publishing Association, stated in October 2017 that it will discourage its citizens from playing battle royale games as they them too violent, which \"deviates from the of socialism and is deemed to young \", as translated by \"Bloomberg\". Gaming journals in the west thus that this would make it hard or impossible to publish battle royale within the country. In November 2017, PUBG Corporation announced its partnership with Tencent to make the game available in China, making some changes in the game to \"make sure they with socialist core values, Chinese traditional culture and moral rules\" to satisfy Chinese regulations and censors. However, during mid-2018, the Chinese government changed how it reviewed and classified games that are to be published in China, and by December 2018, after the formation of the new Online Ethics Review Committee, several battle royale titles, including \"Fortnite\" and \"PUBG\", were listed as illegal or must be withdrawn from play. Despite the concern that PUBG Corporation and Tencent were taking with Chinese release, a large number of clones of \"Battlegrounds\" have come out in China already, and created a new genre there called \"chicken-eating game\", named based on the winning line to the last player standing in \"Battlegrounds\", \"Winner winner chicken dinner!\"\nImpact.\nThe fast growth and success of the battle royale genre has been attributed to many , including the way all players start weak and removing any obvious advantage for players, and being well-suited for being a spectator eSport. Other factors including specific games' business models, such as \"Fortnite Battle Royale\" being free and available across computers, consoles, and mobile devices. A University of Utah professor also considers that battle royale games realize elements of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, a scheme to describe human motivation, more-so than video games have in the past. While the lowest tiers of Maslow's hierarchy, physiological and safety, are met by the survival elements of battle royales, the love/belonging and esteem tiers are a result of the battle royale being necessarily a social and competitive game, and the final tier of self-actualization comes from becoming skilled in the game to win more.\n\"Business Insider\" said that battle royale games will bring in over during 2018, and would grow to in 2019. SuperData Research reported that, in 2018, the three top-grossing battle royale games (\"Fortnite\", \"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds\" and \"Call of Duty: Black Ops 4\") generated nearly in combined digital revenue. Sensor Tower reported that 2018's top three most-downloaded mobile battle royale games (\"PUBG Mobile\", \"Garena Free Fire\" and \"Fortnite\") received over 500million downloads combined that year. The most-played battle royale games include \"PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds\" with over 400million players, NetEase's mobile game \"Knives Out\" with over 250million players, \"Fortnite Battle Royale\" with nearly 250million players, \"Rules of Survival\" with 230million players, and \"Garena Free Fire\" with over 180million players.\nTurtle Beach Corporation, a manufacturer of headphones and microphones for gaming, reported an increase of over 200% in total revenues for the second season of 2018 over the same season in 2017, which they attributed to the popularity of the battle royale genre."}

Its title is taken from the song of the same name, by Marvin Gaye and Kim Weston, which is played in the closing credits.\nPlot.\nTwo unrelated young girls who happen to look identical meet by chance. Amanda Lemmon is an orphan, and she is about to be adopted by the Butkises, a family known to \"collect\" kids. She actually wants her child-loving social worker, Diane Barrows, to adopt her instead. Diane would like to do so, but authorities will not let her because of her low salary and unmarried status. Alyssa Callaway is coming home from her school piano recital competition, only to find that her wealthy father, Roger, is about to marry Clarice Kensington, an overbearing self-centered gold-digger socialite who plans to send both Alyssa and Thomas off to boarding school in Tibet after marrying Roger.\nThe identical strangers long for the other's life and decide to switch places, Alyssa and Amanda tell Thomas not to tell anyone about the two switching places and he agrees. While Amanda enjoys Alyssa's wealthy lifestyle and Alyssa gets to experience being a kid at summer camp, the two get to know the other's parental figure and discover that Roger and Diane would be perfect for each other. Desperate to set them up, the girls arrange many \"chance\" meetings between Diane and Roger, hoping that they fall in love.\nUpon having spied Roger and Diane laughing and swimming together in a lake one afternoon, Clarice manipulates Roger into moving the wedding up from the next month to the next day. Soon after, Alyssa, while posing as Amanda, ends up being adopted by the Butkises without Diane's knowledge, and is taken away by child services. Alyssa discovers the only reason the Butkises had adopted so many kids was to put them to work in their salvage yard.\nRoughly two hours before the wedding, Amanda, who poses as Alyssa, proves to the family butler, Vincenzo, that she is not Alyssa. He contacts Diane and summons to have the real Alyssa picked up from the Butkises' salvage yard. In the meantime, Vincenzo, Thomas and Amanda work to stall the wedding.\nJust as Roger is about to say \"I do,\" Diane bursts into the church with the real Alyssa behind her, and Roger falters at the sight of Diane, recalling all the good times they had together. In that moment, he realises he has fallen in love with Diane and confesses this to Clarice. Furious, she slaps him and tries to do the same to \"Alyssa,\" blaming her for sabotaging their relationship, but is stopped by Vincenzo and Thomas. As Clarice storms down the aisle, the real Alyssa steps out from behind Diane, and Clarice claims it's a \"conspiracy\" that there's \"two of them.\" She tries to take this new opportunity to slap Alyssa, but Diane steps forward in time, barking at her to \"Back off, Barbie,\" and calmly informs her that she has something in her teeth. Humiliated, Clarice moves to storm out of the church again, but Alyssa embarrasses her even further by stepping on her wedding gown, causing the skirt to rip off.\nAn incredulous Roger learns that Alyssa has been with Diane all this time and it becomes apparent to them that Thomas, Amanda and Alyssa had orchestrated their meet-ups all along, about which the girls are extremely smug. After some encouragement from the girls and Thomas, Roger and Diane kiss, and the five of them board a horse-drawn carriage, driven by Vincenzo, to take a ride through Central Park."}

These songs were originally slated to be on the original album, but they were cut because of the album's length. \"The Last Few Bricks\" is an instrumental bridge between \"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 3\" and \"Goodbye Cruel World\". The song includes themes from previous songs, including \"Young Lust\", \"Empty Spaces\", \"Don't Leave Me Now\", \"What Shall We Do Now?\", and \"The Happiest Days of Our Lives\".

It bookends their 1975 studio album Wish You Were Here. \nBackground.\nShine On is a tribute song to Pink Floyd's former member, Syd Barrett. Barrett was removed from the band for his drug use and mental problems, which interfered with his ability to perform and develop as a musician. He was replaced by David Gilmour, who was a friend of Barrett's.\nBarrett incident.\nOne day during recording, Barrett decided to stop by Abbey Road Studios to see the band. At first, the band could not recognize him. He was now heavyset, and had shaved his hair and eyebrows. Once the band had realized Barrett's identity, Roger Waters was so distressed he burst into tears. Somebody asked to play the song again for Barrett, but he had said another play was unnecessary. Barrett said the song sounded \"a bit old\". \nComposition.\nParts I-V.\nPart I \"(Wright, Waters, Gilmour; from 0:00 to 3:54)\" There are no lyrics in Part I. The section begins with a fade in of chords created with synthesizers and wine glasses. Wright plays a synthesizer passage, which leads into a long guitar solo by Gilmour. The wineglass-synth chords fade into the background.\nPart II \"(Wright, Waters, Gilmour; from 3:54 to 6:27)\" Part II opens with a four-note theme, called Syd's theme by fans. This repeats for much of the part. Mason and Waters begin playing after the fourth play of the theme. \nPart III \"(Wright, Waters, Gilmour; from 6:27 to 8:42)\" Part III opens with a synthesizer solo from Wright. This part includes another guitar solo by Gilmour. \nPart IV \"(Wright, Waters, Gilmour; from 8:42 to 11:10)\" Part IV has vocals. Waters and Gilmour sing the vocals, with backup singers Venette Fields and Carlena Williams.\nPart V \"(Wright, Waters, Gilmour; from 11:10 to 13:32)\" Two guitars play an arpeggio version of the theme for a minute. Dick Parry begins playing saxophone until the part ends. The music fades into synthesizer sounds, resembling an elevator. The song fades to \"Welcome to the Machine\". \nParts VI-IX.\nPart VI \"(Wright, Waters, Gilmour; from 0:00 to 4:39)\" Howling wind fades in from \"Wish You Were Here\". As the wind fades away, Gilmour comes in with bass guitar. Waters adds to Gilmour's bass with his own creating a riff pattern. Gilmour and Wright harmonize with lap-steel guitar and synth at the two minute mark. The song's time signature changes to reintroduce the vocals.\nPart VII \"(Wright, Waters, Gilmour; from 4:39 to 5:49)\" The vocals are introduced again. Same personnel as Part IV. \nPart VIII \"(Wright, Waters, Gilmour; from 5:49 to 9:17)\" A high-noted riff plays to bridge the parts. The song switches to a funk progression. The section fades into Wright's synthesizer solo.\nPart IX \"(Wright; from 9:17 to 12:28)\" A lengthy synthesizer solo. The solo plays throughout the part, and during the fade-out, a keyboard part of \"See Emily Play\" can be heard, one of Barrett's signature Floyd tracks."}

{"id": "699190", "revid": "586", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=699190", "title": "Julia Kristeva", "text": "Julia Kristeva (; ; born 24 June 1941) is a Bulgarian-French philosopher, literary critic, semiotician, psychoanalyst, feminist, and, most recently, novelist, who has lived in France since the mid-1960s. She is now a professor emeritus at the University Paris Diderot. The author of more than 30 books, including \"Powers of Horror\", \"Tales of Love\", \"Black Sun: Depression and Melancholia\", \"Proust and the Sense of Time\", and the trilogy \"Female Genius\", she has been awarded Commander of the Legion of Honor, Commander of the Order of Merit, the Holberg International Memorial Prize, the Hannah Arendt Prize, and the Vision 97 Foundation Prize, awarded by the Havel Foundation.\nKristeva became influential in international critical analysis, cultural studies and feminism after publishing her first book, \"Semeiotik\u00e8\", in 1969. She has published a large amount of academic work including books and essays which address intertextuality, the semiotic, and abjection, in the fields of linguistics, literary theory and criticism, psychoanalysis, biography and autobiography, political and cultural analysis, art and art history. She is important in structuralist and poststructuralist thought.\nKristeva is also the founder of the Simone de Beauvoir Prize committee.\nLife.\nKristeva was born in Sliven, Bulgaria. Her parents were Christian. Her father was a church accountant. Kristeva and her sister attended a Francophone school run by Dominican nuns. Kristeva learned about the work of Mikhail Bakhtin. Kristeva went on to study at the University of Sofia. While a postgraduate there she got a research fellowship that let her move to France in December 1965, when she was 24. She continued her education at several French universities, studying under Lucien Goldmann and Roland Barthes, among other scholars. On August 2, 1967, Kristeva married the novelist Philippe Sollers, \"n\u00e9\" Philippe Joyaux.\nKristeva taught at Columbia University in the early 1970s. She is still a Visiting Professor. She has also published under the married name Julia Joyaux.\nWork.\nAfter joining the 'Tel Quel group' founded by Sollers, Kristeva mostly worked on the politics of language and became an active member of the group. She trained in psychoanalysis, and earned her degree in 1979. In some ways, her work can be seen as trying to adapt a psychoanalytic approach to poststructuralist criticism. For example, her view of the subject, and its construction has some things in common with Sigmund Freud and Lacan. However, Kristeva rejects any understanding of the subject in a structuralist sense. Instead, she describes the subject as always \"in process\" or \"on trial\". In this way, she contributes to the poststructuralist critique of essentialized structures, while preserving the teachings of psychoanalysis. She travelled to China in the 1970s and later wrote \"About Chinese Women\" (1977).\nThe \"semiotic\" and the \"symbolic\".\nOne of Kristeva's most important contributions is that signification is composed of two elements: the symbolic and the \"semiotic\". That use of semiotic is different from the discipline of semiotics founded by Ferdinand de Saussure. Augustine Perumalil explained that Kristeva's \"semiotic is closely related to the infantile pre-Oedipal referred to in the works of Freud, Otto Rank, Melanie Klein, British Object Relation psychoanalysis, and Lacan's pre-mirror stage.\" It is an emotional field that is related to the instincts in the gaps and sounds of language rather than in the denotative meanings of words. According to Birgit Schippers, the semiotic is associated with music, poetry, rhythm, and that which lacks structure and meaning. It is closely tied to the \"feminine\" and shows the state of the pre-Mirror Stage infant that has not yet developed independently.\nIn the Mirror Stage, the child learns to tell the difference between self and other. The child begins a process of sharing cultural meaning, known as the symbolic. In \"Desire in Language\" (1980), Kristeva describes the symbolic as the development of language in the child to become a \"speaking subject\" and to develop a sense of identity separate from the mother. This process of separation is known as abjection. The child must reject and move away from the mother in order to enter into the world of language, culture, meaning, and the social. This realm of language is called the symbolic and is different from the semiotic that is associated with the masculine, the law, and structure. Kristeva thinks differently from Lacan. She thinks that even after entering the symbolic, the subject continues to move back and forth between the semiotic and the symbolic. Therefore, the child does not form a fixed identity. The subject is permanently \"in process\". Because female children continue to identify to some degree with the mother figure, they are especially likely to retain a close connection to the semiotic. This continued identification with the mother may result in what Kristeva refers to in \"Black Sun\" (1989) as melancholia (depression), because female children both reject and identify with the mother figure at the same time.\nIt has also been suggested (e.g., Creed, 1993) that the degradation of women and women's bodies in popular culture (and particularly, for example, in slasher films) emerges because of the threat to identity that the mother's body poses: it is a reminder of time spent in the undifferentiated state of the semiotic, where one has no concept of self or identity. After abjecting the mother, subjects retain an unconscious fascination with the semiotic, desiring to reunite with the mother, while at the same time fearing the loss of identity that accompanies it. Slasher films thus provide a way for audience members to safely reenact the process of abjection by vicariously expelling and destroying the mother figure.\nKristeva uses Plato\u2019s idea of the \"chora\", meaning \"a nourishing maternal space\" (Schippers, 2011). Kristeva\u2019s idea of the \"chora\" may mean: a reference to the uterus, as a metaphor for the relationship between the mother and child, and as the time before the Mirror Stage.\nKristeva is also known for working on intertextuality.\nAnthropology and psychology.\nKristeva argues that anthropology and psychology, or the connection between the social and the subject, do not represent each other, but rather follow the same logic: the survival of the group and the subject. Furthermore, in her analysis of Oedipus, she claims that the speaking subject cannot exist on his/her own, but that he/she \"stands on the fragile threshold as if stranded on account of an impossible demarcation\" (\"Powers of Horror\", p.\u00a085).\nIn her comparison between the two disciplines, Kristeva claims that the way in which an individual excludes the abject mother as a means of forming an identity, is the same way in which societies are constructed. On a broader scale, cultures exclude the maternal and the feminine, and by this come into being.\nFeminist.\nKristeva has been called an important leader of French feminism together with Simone de Beauvoir, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous, and Luce Irigaray. Kristeva has had a strong influence on feminism and feminist literary studies in the US and the UK. She has also influenced thinking about contemporary art. But her relation to feminist groups and movements in France has been very controversial. Kristeva made a famous statement about three types of feminism in \"Women's Time\" in \"New Maladies of the Soul\" (1993). She rejected the first two types, including that of Beauvoir. Some people think she completely rejects feminism. Kristeva proposed an idea of multiple sexual identities against concepts of \"unified feminine language\".\nAgainst identity politics.\nKristeva says American feminist academics have misunderstood her writings. According to Kristeva, it was not enough to take language apart to find its hidden meaning. History, individual psychic and sexual experiences also tell us how to understand language. This is a post-structuralist approach. It helped some social groups to find the source of their oppression in the language that they used. However, Kristeva believes that it is harmful to think of collective identity as more important than individual identity. She thinks that politics that makes sexual, ethnic, and religious identities the most important thing is ultimately totalitarian.\nNovelist.\nKristeva wrote some novels that are like detective stories. The books have mystery and suspense, but readers also find ideas from her theoretical projects. \"Murder in Byzantium\" has themes from orthodox Christianity and politics. She called it \"a kind of anti-Da Vinci Code\".\nHonors.\nKristeva won the Holberg International Memorial Prize in 2004. She won the 2006 Hannah Arendt Prize for Political Thought. She has also received Commander of the Legion of Honor, Commander of the Order of Merit, and the Vaclav Havel Prize.\nScholarly reception.\nRoman Jakobson said that Kristeva was very good at asking questions in a way that interested people even if they disagreed with her\nRoland Barthes comments that Julia Kristeva changes the place of things. He says that she always destroys your last prejudice and that she turns authority against itself.\" \nIan Almond criticizes Kristeva's ethnocentrism. He repeats Gayatri Spivak's conclusion that Kristeva's book \"About Chinese Women\" has problems. Almond says it has the same discrimination and bias as in the eighteenth century. Also, he says that Kristeva wrote about two thousand years of history that she does not know well. Almond also thinks that Kristeva's ideas about the Muslim world, culture, and believers are too simple. He adds that Kristeva ignores Muslim women and pays too much attention to the Rushdie fatwa.\nSome writings.\nNovels.\nOther books about Julia Kristeva:"}
