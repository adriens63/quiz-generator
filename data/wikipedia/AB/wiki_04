She inspired his two books \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" (1865) and \"Through the Looking-Glass\" (1871). Dodgson wrote the two books using the pen name, Lewis Carroll.\nLife.\nAlice was born in Westminster, London, one of ten children of Henry Liddell and his wife Lorina. Her father was Dean of Christ Church college in Oxford. Dodgson was a mathematics don, a Fellow at the college. He was 24 years old when he met Alice on 25 April 1856. He was an expert photographer, and took a number of photographs of her.\nAlice and her sisters Edith and Lorina took little trips with Dodgson. They had boating parties and other outdoor adventures. Dodgson told stories on these trips. He started the story of Alice in Wonderland during a boat trip on the Thames on 4 July 1862. In 1864, his trips with the girls were brought to an end by their mother. It is not known why.\nAlice grew up a refined young woman. She married Reginald Hargreaves in Westminster Abbey in 1880. The couple lived in a country house in Hampshire. Alice was a very capable person. She managed many servants. She arranged balls and parties. She had three sons. Two were killed in World War I. Her husband never overcame this loss. He died in 1926.\nMrs. Hargreaves sold some of her \"Alice\" memorabilia through Sotheby's. This sale included the original \"Alice\" manuscript. It had been the gift of Dodgson. It was bought by an American. It was returned to the United Kingdom during World War II. It now is in the British Museum. Alice died in 1934 in Westerham, Kent. She was cremated and buried in the Hargreaves family plot in Hampshire."}

The philosophy teaches that through inner development a person can better know the spiritual world.\n\"Anthropos\" is a Greek word that means \"human being\". \"Sophos\" means \"wise\". Steiner believed every human being had the wisdom to understand the mysteries of existence. He left the German Theosophical Society in 1912 trading divine wisdom for human wisdom.\nCentral ideas.\nAnthroposophy does not have a rigid set of beliefs. It is said to be a philosophy of freedom. Each person connects to the world through an individual path.\nThe path to wisdom is based on research. The research leads to knowledge. This is similar to teachings of Thomas Aquinas. Anthroposophy is different in that it pursues knowledge of science, the arts and spirituality all together.\nThe philosophy also teaches respect of other humans. It encourages support of others in their interest and learning of the spiritual world. To support this, Steiner created The Anthroposophical Society in 1923. It is now called the General Anthroposophical Society. The society has groups and national societies in over 75 countries."}

It lived in what is now China. \"Aurornis xui\" may be the most basal (\"primitive\") bird species known to date. Aurornis was discovered in 2013. The animal may predate the famous \"Archaeopteryx lithographica\", the earliest bird, by about 10 million years.\nDescription.\n\"Aurornis\" was described from a sedimentary rock fossil in 2013. The fossil was purchased from a local dealer who said it had been unearthed in Yaoluguo in western Liaoning, China. At first, analysis confirmed it came from the Tiaojishan Formation, which has been dated to the late Jurassic period, about 160 million years ago. The fossil features traces of downy feathers along the animal's tail, chest, and neck. It was only partly prepared at the time of purchase; the feathers were not showing, and the fossil bore no signs of forgery. \nLater doubts.\nOn 7th June 2013 Science (journal) said that Pascal Godefroit, the paleontologist who led the team that described \"Aurornis\", is uncertain if the fossil material came from Liaoning province\u0092's 160-million-year-old Tiaojishan Formation as claimed by the fossil dealer. It may be from the province\u0092's 125-million-year-old Yixian Formation, which is known to have produced several ancient bird fossils. The failure to secure rigorous provenance casts doubt on the claim that \"Aurornis\" is 160 million years old and predates \"Archaeopteryx\". Godefroit's team will try to confirm the specimen\u0092's age by mineralogical and botanical analysis on the shale slab. \n\"Aurornis\" was roughly the size of a modern pheasant\u00a0\u2013 in length from beak to tail tip. It had claws and a long tail. Its leg bones are similar to those of \"Archaeopteryx\", but overall its bone structure is more primitive. The absence of larger feathers suggests \"A. xui\" was unable to fly. If \"Aurornis\" lived roughly 160 million years ago, this is about ten million years before \"Archaeopteryx\", which often has been described as the first bird.\nClassification.\nA phylogenetic analysis of \"Aurornis\" published in 2013 found that it belongs in the bird lineage, in a more basal position than \"Archaeopteryx\". The analysis was based on \"almost 1,500 [anatomical] characteristics.\"\nThe classification of \"A. xui\" as a bird is somewhat contentious, however, due to the various differing definitions of the word \"bird\". Recent discoveries \"[emphasize] how grey the dividing line is between birds and [non-avian] dinosaurs\", says Paul Barrett of the Natural History Museum, in London. \"There's such a gradation in features between them that it's very difficult to tell them apart\u00a0... [\"Aurornis xui\"] is certainly an older member of the bird lineage than \"Archaeopteryx\", and it's fair to call it a very primitive bird. But what you call a bird comes down to what you call a bird, and a lot of definitions depend on \"Archaeopteryx\".\" Bird evolution specialist Lawrence Witmer called the new analysis compelling, but said it remains difficult to distinguish birds from birdlike dinosaurs: \"All of these little feathered species running and flapping around ... were all very similar.\"\nAmerican paleontologist Luis Chiappe said that \"A. xui\"'s forelimb is too short to be a true bird. It \"is very birdlike, but it is not yet a bird,\" he concluded."}

Three days after their arrival, a party of Danes rode out towards nearby Englefield. There they met a West Saxon force under the command of Ealdorman Athelwulf.

Four days later, Athelwulf was joined by the main West Saxon army, led by King Athelred and his brother, Alfred. The entire Saxon force marched on Reading.

In medical terms, it is called a paracusia. A common form involves hearing one or more voices talking. This can be a sign of some psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia or mania. It is very important sign when deciding that a patient has one of these conditions.\nPeople may hear voices without suffering from any specific mental illness. The causes are still being researched. The main cause of auditory hallucinations in psychotic patients is schizophrenia. The underlying problems in these cases may be genetic.\nThere are three main ways in which the hallucination may form: a person hearing a voice speak thoughts, a person hearing one or more voices arguing, or a person hearing a voice narrating their own actions. There can be other types of auditory hallucinations besides these three. These include hearing music playing inside the mind, usually songs that the person is familiar with. This is usually caused by damage to the brain, hearing loss or epileptic activity.\nThe main method of treating auditory hallucinations is antipsychotic medications that affect the body's dopamine metabolism. If the hallucinations are being caused by a mood disorder, then other medications (such as antidepressants or mood stabilizers) are often used together with the antipsychotics. These treatments may stop the hallucinations, but they are not a cure as they do not fix the cause of the problem. Some psychological therapies have been shown to help lower the intensity of the hallucinations and how often they occur."}

It comes from the French \"provenir\", meaning \"to come from\".\nThe term was originally used in relation to works of art. It is now used in a wide range of fields, including archaeology, paleontology, archives, manuscripts, printed books, and science and computing. The main reason to trace the provenance of an object is to get evidence of its original production or discovery. This has a special value to help authenticate objects, to prove what they are. Provenance is essentially a matter of documentation.\nIn archaeology the term provenience is used in related but a subtly different sense to \"provenance\". Archaeological researchers use \"provenience\" to refer to the three-dimensional location or find spot of an artifact or feature within an archaeological site, whereas \"provenance\" covers an object's complete documented history. Ideally, in modern excavations, the provenience or find spot is recorded (even videoed) with great precision, but in older cases only the general site or approximate area may be known, especially when an artifact was found outside a professional excavation and its specific position not recorded. An object may have both a provenience (where it was found) and a provenance (where it has been since it was found). In some cases, especially where there is an inscription, the provenance may include a history that predates its burial in the ground, as well as its history after rediscovery."}

It may also be called a continental glacier. There are two ice sheets in the world at the moment: in Antarctica and Greenland.\nIce sheets are larger than ice shelves or alpine glaciers. Masses of ice covering less than 50,000\u00a0km2 are called ice caps. The ice in an ice cap usually comes from a series of glaciers that drain into it.\nThe Antarctic ice sheet is the largest single mass of ice on Earth. It covers an area of almost 14\u00a0million\u00a0km2 and contains 30\u00a0million\u00a0km3 of ice. Around 90% of the fresh water on the Earth's surface is held in this ice sheet. If all of it were to melt, it would cause sea levels to rise by 58\u00a0metres. The ice sheet first formed in the early Oligocene. It retreated and advanced many times until the Pliocene, when it came to occupy almost all of Antarctica.\nThe Greenland ice sheet covers about 82% of the surface of Greenland. Satellite images from NASA show that it is melting at a rate of about 239\u00a0cubic\u00a0kilometres (57.3\u00a0cubic\u00a0miles) each year. If all of it melted, it would cause sea levels to rise by 7.2\u00a0metres. The ice sheet did not develop at all until the late Pliocene, but apparently developed very quickly. This had the unusual effect of allowing fossils of plants that once grew on present-day Greenland to be much better preserved than with the slowly forming Antarctic ice sheet."}

The Davis Strait which separates Baffin Bay from the Labrador Sea was named by William Baffin in 1916. He probably named it after John Davis. \nOn March 20, 1820, Davis left New Haven, Connecticut for a trip to the Pacific Ocean. He had received news of the discovery of the South Shetland Islands while he was anchored at the Falkland Islands. Learning there were large numbers of seals there, he and another ship captain sailed their vessels to Greenwich Island. But it was too late in the season and other were there before them. So Davis took his ship, named \"Cecilia\", in search of seals further south. Finding many seals at Low Island he continued southwards. He probably came upon Hughes Bay on the Antarctic Peninsula. His ship's log records he found \"a large body of land.\" He sent a boat to shore to look for seals but found none. He also wrote \"I think this southern land to be a continent\". He also wrote in the log the latitude was 64\u00b001'S (sixty-four degrees, one minute, south). Davis continued his journey back to Greenwich Island arriving there on 10 February, 1821. He wintered at the Falkland Islands and returned to seal hunting the following season. It remains impossible, however, to prove he was the first to reach Antarctica."}

It may be an ocean or may be a large saline lake which, like the Caspian Sea, lacks a natural outlet.\nCharacteristics.\nSeawater.\nSeawater is salty. The open ocean has about solids per litre, a salinity of 35ppt. The Mediterranean Sea is a little higher at 37ppt and the Dead Sea has as much as dissolved solids per litre (300ppt). Although sodium chloride is the main salt present, making up about 85% of the solids in solution, there are also per litre of the chlorides of other metals such as potassium and magnesium and of sulphates, carbonates, bromides and other salts. A kilogram (2.2 lb) of salt can therefore be found in 28 litres or one cubic foot of typical ocean water. Despite differences in the levels of salinity in different seas, the relative composition of the dissolved salts is very stable throughout the world's oceans.\nTemperature.\nThe temperature of the sea depends on the amount of sunlight falling on the surface. In the tropics, with the sun nearly overhead, the temperature of the surface layers can rise to over while near the poles the temperature in balance with the sea ice is about . Cold water is denser than warm water and tends to sink. Cold water is denser than warm water and tends to sink. There is a continuous circulation of water in the oceans. Warm surface currents cool as they move away from the tropics, the water becomes denser and sinks. The cold water moves back towards the equator as a deep sea current, driven by changes in the temperature and density of the water, eventually welling up again towards the surface. Deep sea water has a temperature between and in all parts of the globe.\nOxygen.\nThe amount of oxygen found in seawater depends mostly on the plants growing in it. These are mainly algae, including phytoplankton, but also include some vascular plants such as seagrasses. In daylight the photosynthetic activity of these plants produces oxygen which dissolves in the seawater where it is used by marine animals. At night, photosynthesis stops, and the amount of dissolved oxygen declines. In the deep sea where not enough light penetrates for plants to grow, there is very little dissolved oxygen.\nSeawater is a little alkaline and during historic times has had a pH of about 8.2. The pH is expected to reach 7.7 by the year 2100, an increase of 320% in acidity in a century. One important element for the formation of skeletal material in marine animals is calcium but it is easily precipitated out in the form of calcium carbonate as the sea becomes more acid. This is likely to have profound effects on certain planktonic marine organisms because their ability to form shells will be reduced. These include single-celled algae called coccolithophorids and foraminifera. These are important parts of the food chain. Reducing their numbers will have significant results. In tropical areas, corals will be affected by a lack of calcium, with knock-on effects for other reef residents.\nWaves.\nWind blowing over the surface of a body of water forms waves. The friction between air and water caused by a gentle breeze on a pond causes ripples to form. A strong blow over the ocean causes larger waves as the moving air pushes against the raised ridges of water. The waves reach their greatest height when the rate at which they travel nearly matches the speed of the wind. The waves form at right angles to the direction from which the wind blows. In open water, if the wind continues to blow, as happens in the Roaring Forties in the southern hemisphere, long, organized masses of water called swell roll across the ocean."}

This means that they live in water that is not near the shore and not near the bottom of the ocean. They live in all temperate and tropical oceans. Oarfish are also very rare. They are usually only seen when a dead one washes onto the shore. When oarfish are sick or dying, they swim up near the surface of the water. This behavior means that oarfish are probably the \"sea serpents\" in legends.\nThere are two ideas about why these fish are called \"oarfish.\" One idea is that their bodies look like oars because they are very long and flat. The other idea is that some people used to think that oarfish swam by moving their fins like the oars of a row boat. We now know that this \"rowing\" idea wrong.

It is a two-part genetic system found in bacteria, and maybe more widely. It is the way antibiotic resistance is passed on so rapidly. It is found in plasmids and chromosomes. Although the first function discovered was antibiotic resistance, other bacterial functions (traits) can be transferred by integrons.\nTransposons are the gene \"capture and expression elements\" which put the small mobile elements known as gene cassettes in place and make them work. Usually,\neach cassette has only a single gene and a specific\nrecombination site. The cassettes carry the DNA coding (= 'a gene') for antibiotic resistance (for example). Typically, the DNA would code for an enzyme which cleaves (cuts) the antibiotic molecule up.\nThe first part of an integron is a gene which codes for an enzyme which captures cassettes. The second is a site on the genome where the cassettes are inserted, and a promoter which drives expression of cassette-associated genes. \"Integron\" describes such structures both when no cassettes are present and when there are integrated cassettes. Cassettes can be inserted at the site, they can be cut out, and they can undergo horizontal gene transfer."}

He was Regent of England for a time during the childhood of Edward III. In his day he may have been one of the most important persons in the monarchy next to the Royal family itself. He was noted for his superior combat skills, his continuing loyalty to his Kings and his great ability in diplomacy. Marshal began his life as a \u201clandless\u201d knight to become the Earl of Pembroke and one of the wealthiest men in the country.\nShortly after his death in 1219, his oldest son, William Marshal II, commissioned a biography of the life of his father. Though biographers often embellish their subjects, many of the events of William's life stated there are clearly recorded elsewhere in historical records. \nChildhood.\nWilliam Marshal\u2019s father, was John Marshal, called John the Marshal. He was the Lord of Newbury Castle located in County Berkshire in England. When William was a young boy, there was a fierce civil war in England between King Stephen, grandson of William I, also called William the Conqueror and Henry I's daughter, Empress Matilda. When William I died, both Stephen and Matilda believed they were the true successor to the Crown. This period in history was known as the time of The Anarchy because there was much lawlessness and violence in the Kingdom. Many barons and Earls would \"change sides\" when it benefited them to do so and John Marshal was no exception. At first he pledged his fealty or loyalty to King Stephen but later changed it to Empress Matilda. This act helped to turn the tide in the civil war. \nEarly life as a knight.\nAt an early age, William was sent to William de Tancarville to learn the skills of knighthood. He was knighted in 1166. He then crossed the channel to Normandy and went to serve under his uncle, Patrick, the Earl of Salisbury. He fought in Ponthieu in 1168 when greatly outnumbered, his uncle was killed and William was taken prisoner. Marshal's great skill and bravery was noticed and he was ransomed by Queen Eleanor of England. \nAs a young adult, Marshal went to many tournaments. These were contests and mock (imitation) wars where Knights competed for great prizes. Tournaments were an opportunity for a knight to acquire valuable possessions such as money, a horse, armor and weapons. They were dangerous and it was not unusual for a knight to be killed during a tournament.\nWilliam and Henry, the young king.\nWilliam had become a very skilled knight and after his ramsom he became part of Henry II\u2019s household, teaching men to fight. He became tutor, guardian, protector and friend to the son of Henry II, known historically as Henry the Young King. When young Henry was coronated, Marshal was assigned to serve him as captain of the guard and chief of the knights. It was Marshal who would knight the young King Henry. Marshal also accompanied young Henry on many tournaments. In 1173 young Henry argued with his father. He wanted to assume the throne of England even though his father was still alive. He left England and took his brother Richard with him to his mother's lands in Aquitaine. In 1174, Henry II and his son made peace. William continued on to win fame in tournaments. The young king became ill and died of a sudden disease at Martel on 11 June 1183.\nOn crusade and fighting under Henry II.\nOn his deathbed young Henry ordered Marshal to go on Crusade on his behalf. With Henry II's permission, William went on Crusade for two years and his superior fighting skill was recognized by the Knights Templar. When he returned, Henry II at once took him into high favor, and made him a member of his household. Marshal then fought for Henry II against the French King Louis VII of France and in skirmishs against Henry's other sons now in rebellion.\nRichard (called Lionhearted) was Henry II\u2019s second son and he also wanted to be King of England and did not want to wait until his father died. After a skirmish, Marshal came upon Richard and instead of killing him, killed his horse. Shortly thereafter, Henry II became ill and retreated to Chinon where he died in 1189.\nWilliam with Richard I.\nRichard did not forget Marshal\u2019s act of bravery and loyalty and when he became King, he took Marshal to fight against the King of France. After a time, Richard decided to go on Crusade and left Marshal in England as the Justiciar of England who acted for the king in his absence and presided over the king's courts during his absence.\nRichard I reaffirmed his father's promise to William and gave him the heiress of the Earldom of Pembroke, Striguil and the lands that came with her as was promised to him by Henry II shortly before Henry's death. Marshal at once became one of the richest men in the Kingdom. He acquired property in four countries.\nMarshal fought valiantly for Richard against the King of France and was there when the peace treaty was made. In 1199 King Richard was wounded and died of his wounds. At that point there was another dispute about who would next be King of England, Arthur or John.\nGeoffrey II, Duke of Brittany, was another son of Henry II and would have been the next in line to be King but he died on either the 19 or 21 August 1186, at the age of 27. The more common version is that he was trampled to death in a jousting tournament. Geoffrey had a son Arthur I, who became the next Duke of Brittany. Arthur felt that he was also heir to the throne of England. Marshal believed that as a brother to King Richard, and in accordance with Norman custom, John, Geoffrey\u2019s brother, should become the next King. It was resolved in John\u2019s favor and he became the next King of England.\nWilliam and King John.\nWilliam fought alongside King John and after a time, John made William the Marshal of England.\nKing John was a man who was disliked by many of his barons and Earls. He knew this and distrusted them. When Marshal went over to protect his lands in Ireland the King made him give one of his sons as hostage to make sure that Marshal was not disloyal to him. King John sometimes took lands away from Marshal and at other times gave them back. There was strife all during the reign of King John but Marshal remained loyal to the King throughout.\nKing John died on 18 October, 1216. At that time his son, Henry III was too young to rule the kingdom. Marshal was appointed as Regent to Henry III to make decisions on Henry\u2019s behalf until he came of age.\nWilliam and Henry III.\nMarshal was quite old by then but managed the affairs of Henry III as Regent and even fought in combat at the Battle of Lincoln. He was approximately 70 years of age. On 14 May 1219 Marshal died at Caversham.\nDeath of William Marshal.\nWhen he knew he was dying he took on the robe of a Knights Templar and after his death he was buried in the Temple Church in London. William Marshal\u2019s effigy can still be seen at the Temple Church, London, with his son next to him."}

More commonly, they are known as , as affinity is usually signified by adding to a degree of kinship.\nIn law, affinity may be used to prohibit incestuous sexual relations. It may also be relevant in preventing some couples from marrying. Which relationships are prohibited varys from country to country, and from time to time. In some countries, especially in the past, the prohibited relationships were based on religious laws. In earlier laws, affinity was used in the same degrees as consanguinity in prohibiting marriages.\nThough laws vary considerably, affinity does not always cease with the death of one of the marriage partners through whom affinity is traced. It does not always end with the divorce of the marriage partners. In addition to kinship by marriage, \"affinity\" can sometimes also include kinship by adoption and step relationship."}

Consanguinity also means being descended from the same ancestor as another person. The laws of many jurisdictions set up degrees of consanguinity when prohibiting sexual relations and marriage. Rules of Consanguinity are also used to determine heirs of an estate. These are according to laws that govern intestate succession. These vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\nHistory.\nMost cultures have prohibited marriages between individuals who are closely related by blood (consanguinity). There were some exceptions. Brothers and sisters, as well as fathers and daughters, often married in ancient Egypt. These were primarily limited to the royal family from the earliest times. Some theories hold that it strengthened a King's claim to the throne. In biblical history, Abraham married his (half-)sister Sarah.\nMost early societies had rules or laws that limited consanguineous marriages. So the dangers of inbreeding must have been known to them. \nRoman civil law.\nIn ancient Rome, marriage was governed by civil laws. Under Roman civil law couples were forbidden to marry if they were within four degrees of consanguinity. The Germanic peoples also had rules against such marriages but were not as strict. \nMedieval Europe.\nIn the 5th century, after the Roman empire collapsed, the church took over regulating marriage. At first they did not have a great deal of influence. The Church's power over marriage grew gradually. At first the Church followed Roman civil law. In the ninth century the church raised the number of prohibited degrees to seven. They also changed the method by which they were calculated. The nobility of Europe usually married from within their own social class. Eventually they became too interrelated to marry by the Church's rules. Many found it necessary to defy the Church. In 1215 the Fourth Lateran Council reduced the number of prohibited degrees of consanguinity from seven back to four. The pope had the power to waive the rules for particular couples. Frequently, papal dispensations were given allowing closely related couples to marry. These were almost always reserved for the royalty and nobility. Sometimes the Church used consanguinity to block marriage as in the case of William the Conqueror and Matilda of Flanders. In 1049 Pope Leo IX refused to allow the marriage. He did not give a reason but the two were cousins. They married anyway. Ten years later, in 1059, Pope, Nicholas II finally granted a dispensation for their marriage. Despite restrictions and laws, up to the 20th century consanguineous marriages were not uncommon in Europe.\nCommon ancestor.\nThe degree of consanguinity can be illustrated with a consanguinity table. Each level of lineal consanguinity (\"i.e.\", generation or meiosis) appears as a row. Individuals with a collaterally consanguineous relationship share the same row. Consanguinity (blood relationship) is different from Affinity (relationship through marriage) but have been prohibited in the same degrees in the past.\nReferences.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

In 1969 he joined the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.\nIn 1993, Schelling received an award from the National Academy of Sciences. He also received an honorary doctorate from Yale University in 2009 as well as an honorary degree from the University of Manchester.\nHe was awarded the 2005 Nobel Prize in Economics (shared with Robert Aumann) for \"having enhanced our understanding of conflict and cooperation through game-theory analysis\".\nPersonal life.\nSchelling was born on 14 April 1921 in Oakland, California. He studied at the University of California, Berkeley, at Harvard University, and at Yale University.\nSchelling married Corinne Tigay Saposs in 1947. They had four children. They divorced in 1991. Then, Schelling married Alice M. Coleman in 1991. They had four children.\nSchelling died on 13 December 2016 in Bethesda, Maryland from complications following a hip fracture, aged 95.\nMajor works.\n\"The strategy of conflict\" (1960).\nSchelling's most famous work grew out of the post-war interest in game theory and the Cold War. The book covers an area known as strategic bargaining, about how the United States could deal with the Soviet Union after World War II. It is thought to be one of the hundred books that have been most influential in the West since 1945. Many studies at the RAND Corporation and Herman Kahn's Hudson Institute were along similar lines. All these people knew each other and gave advice and seminars at the Pentagon and other U.S. government departments.\n\"Arms and influence\" (1966).\nSchelling's theories about war were extended in \"Arms and Influence\". The blurb states that it \"carries forward the analysis so brilliantly begun in his earlier \"The Strategy of Conflict\"... and makes a significant contribution to the growing literature on modern war and diplomacy\".\n\"Micromotives and macrobehavior\" (1978).\nIn 1969 and 1971, Schelling published widely cited articles dealing with what he called \"a general theory of tipping\". In these papers he showed that a preference that one's neighbors be of the same color, or even a preference for a mixture \"up to some limit\", could lead to total segregation. This explained the phenomenon of complete local separation of distinct groups. \nOnce a cycle of such changes has begun, it may have a self-sustaining momentum.\nGlobal warming.\nSchelling has been involved in the global warming debate since chairing a commission for President Jimmy Carter in 1980. He believes climate change poses a serious threat to developing nations, but that the threat to the United States has been exaggerated. Drawing on his experience with the Marshall Plan after World War\u00a0II, he has argued that addressing global warming is a bargaining problem; if the world is able to reduce emissions, poor countries will receive most of the benefits but rich countries will bear most of the costs."}

Previous invasions were for loot, but this one led to semi-permanent settlement.\nA large force of Danish Vikings attacked Anglo-Saxon England. This army appeared in East Anglia in 865. Unlike earlier Vikings who made brief raids on England, the Great army stayed for many years in an attempt to conquer all of England. \nEarly Viking raids.\nThe first recorded Viking attack in England was in 793 at Lindisfarne. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reported \" the of heathen men miserably destroyed God's church at Lindesfarne.\" There were many reasons that Vikings began attacking England. The populations of Norway had been growing between the 7th and 9th centuries. The Vikings were pagans who often had several wives and many sons. These young men filled the ranks of armies and joined ship's crews to go on adventures. The beginning of trade between Europe and England had opened up great trading centers. Vikings were traders but at the same time resorted to piracy when it suited them. This was especially true when they found new lands and people who were not well protected. \nThe first raiders from the north who set foot in England were from Norway. They sacked and killed monks at Lindisfarne and at Jarrow the following year. The Norwegian Vikings then established colonies in the Shetland and Orkney Islands. They also settled in Ireland. The Vikings from Norway only came back to England in the 10th century and from their settlements in Ireland. The Swedes, called the Rus, were to later expand eastwards into Russia. In 835 there was a raid at the mouth of the River Thames by Danish Vikings. For the next thirty years these attacks on England continued. In 850 Canterbury and London were attacked by a Danish band led by Rorik. He was defeated and killed the next year by Athelwulf of Wessex. Only twice had a Danish army spent the winter in England: in 850 and 854.\nThe Great Army.\nIn 865 the Danish Vikings changed their tactics. A large army made up of many smaller bands landed in East Anglia. For over a decade they remained in England destroying entire kingdoms as they went. The Danes spent the winter in East Anglia. The local people bought peace with the Vikings by supplying them with horses. After a year they moved northwards to Northumbria now a mounted army. They captured York and defeated two Northumbrian kings, Aella and Osbert, who joined forces to attack the Danes. Both kings were killed. In 867 they appointed a client-king named Ecgberht over the Northumbrians. In the fall of that year they moved south into Mercia. The Danes made their winter camp at Nottingham. In 868 Burgred, the King of Mercia, asked King Ethelred of Wessex and his brother Alfred for their help against the Danes. The Danes did not fight but allowed the Mercians to pay them for peace. \nThe Vikings later withdrew to York. The next year, 871, the great Viking army grew much larger. After twelve months in York, the great army moved south again into East Anglia. Setting up winter quarters at Thetford they defeated King Edmund of East Anglia. Next, in the fall of 870 they moved to Reading. Athelred with his brother Alfred arrived with their army to meet the new threat. In the battle that followed, the Battle of Reading, both sides suffered many casualties. Athelred's army was defeated. Four days later the two armies met again at the Battle of Ashdown. This time the West Saxons won the victory and the Vikings retreated to Reading. Two weeks later Athelred and Alfred led the West Saxons against the Danes at Basing where the Danes won. Two months passed without any fighting between them. The next battle was at a place called Merantun. After a day long battle which the English were winning, the Danes were able to regain their lost ground. Just after mid-April in 871, Athelred died. At this point Wessex was the last remaining kingdom that hadn't been destroyed by the Vikings. Within a month, Alfred, who replaced his brother as king, was defeated at Wilton. There were nine more battles between the West Saxons and the Danes in the next year. Wessex finally paid the Vikings for peace which ended the fighting. Alfred remained on the throne. Of the two known leaders of the Danes, Ivar the Boneless disappeared from the records after 871. His brother Halfdan Ragnarsson was still the leader when the Danes withdrew from Wessex to winter in London the same year.\nIn 872 the Northumbrians rebelled against the Danes and ejected King Ecgberht. They placed King Ricsige on the throne. Ecgberht took refuge in Mercia. The Danes came north to put down the rebellion, but succeeded only in subduing Deira. Within a few weeks the Danes set up their winter camp at Torksey in Mercia. The Danes had operated as a single army for nine years. But in 874 it divided into two armies. They never reunited.\nThe Danelaw.\nIn 874 Halfdan took his followers north to camp at the mouth of the River Tyne. They raided the Picts and Britons in Strathclyde for the next year. But there was little gain in raiding these poorer areas. The Danes had plundered the wealth of most of England and little was left. Halfdan began settling his men in the area of York. The other army led by Gutheram, Oscytel and Arnuld was still fighting against Wessex at the time. By 876 they had concluded a peace with Wessex. In late 878 Guthrum's band withdrew to Cirencester in Mercia. In 879 they moved to East Anglia. The leader Guthrum, known by his Christian name Aethelstan, reigned as king until his death in 890. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle 'they occupied the land and shared it out.' In 878 a new Danish army was camped at Fulham. But by 879 they had left England for the Low Countries.\nThe settling of a large part of conquered England by the Danes became known as the Danelaw. It became the part of England where the laws and customs were Danish not English. At this point England became divided into three parts. These were Wessex, English Mercia and the Danelaw. The Danelaw was a mixture of the native populations and the members of the great army who settled there. Many placenames were Danish. Many of the words in the English vocabulary have Danish origins. As late as the 11th century when a came to England he did not feel out of place. The languages was the same and the customs were the same. This was true until the Norman conquest of England in 1066 when French was introduced into England."}

He edited the \"Philosophical Transactions\" in 1678-1679, and in 1681 he published by request a descriptive catalogue of the rarities preserved at Gresham College.\nIn 1682 appeared his great work on the \"Anatomy of Plants\", which also was largely a collection of previous publications. It was illustrated with eighty-two plates, with an appendix of seven papers mostly of a chemical character. The \"Anatomy\" is especially notable for its descriptions of plant structure. He described nearly all the key differences of morphology of stem and root, showed that the flowers of the Asteraceae are built of multiple units, and correctly said that stamens are male organs. \"Anatomy of Plants\" also contains the first known microscopic description of pollen.\nMuch of Grew's pioneering work with the microscope was done at the same time as that of Marcello Malpighi. The two reportedly borrowed freely from one another. Grew's work on pollen was more extensive than that of Malpighi. It led to the discovery that size and shape is different between species, whereas pollen grains within a species are all alike. This discovery is central to the field of micropaleontology."}

The idol of that parish was, at that time, a boxer named Armando Best. Pompeyo M\u00e1rquez and Eloy Torres also studied at that school. Both were boxers, who were going to end up as communist leaders. Later on, Yanes went to the University and studied as a journalist, after seeing a notice from the newspaper. He entered the first school of journalism that existed in Venezuela, at the Free University \"Augusteo\", founded in October 1941 by Monsignor Rafael Lovera, at the time of the General Isaiah Medina Angarita. Press freedom given by General Medina Angarita allowed the circulation of 3 newspapers that made history: \u00daltimas Noticias, El Nacional and El Morrocoy] Blue. Yanes signed up for the founding squad of \u00daltimas Noticias and stayed there for a few years.[1]\nAt age 25 he assumes the direction of the newspaper La Esfera. Ram\u00f3n David Le\u00f3n, who gave him the chance at 13 years of getting to know the world of journalism, gives him his office and his position 12 years later, when he decides to sell the newspaper and buys it Miguel \u00c1ngel Capriles.\n-Leading the team of Venevisi\u00f3n a Venezuelan network, Yanes was sent in 1966 to Vietnam as a war correspondent and press officer.

It meant that a monarch was given the right to rule by God alone. His authority could not be questioned because he ruled in God's name. It gave a king absolute rule over his subjects.\nBeginnings.\nPharaohs and some other ancient Kings were thought to actually be gods or descendants of gods. That concept went away when monotheism spread. A medieval principle held that God gave the right in to rule in secular matters to political rulers. God gave the right to rule over spiritual matters to the Pope as head of the Church. This has been called the 'doctrine of the two swords'. In 800, Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne as the Holy Roman Emperor. From that time on the Emperor was the secular power while the Pope was the power. This concept began to break down prior to the First Crusade. Rather than have the Emperor provide the manpower for the crusade, the Pope called on the nobility of Europe directly.\nRise and fall.\nIn England, Henry VIII broke free of the Catholic church and the authority of the Pope. By the Acts of Supremacy in 1534 Henry was both king and \"Supreme Head\" of the Church of England. Following the Protestant Reformation the theory of divine right gave the king absolute authority as God's representative on earth in both political and spiritual matters. It made him accountable to no one but God. James I of England in his speech to Parliament in 1609 said:\nIn France the theory had been considered from the 13th century. Although France remained Catholic, her kings gradually pulled away from papal rule. By the 16th century the king replaced the pope as supreme authority over the French church. After the Glorious Revolution of 1688\u201389 the divine rights theory was no longer popular in England. In France, kings including Louis XIV of France (1643\u20131715) continued the divine rights doctrine. That was until the French revolution in 1789. By the 19th century it no longer had any .\nChina.\nThe Chinese culture had a similar but older concept called the 'Mandate of Heaven'. A good ruler had the blessings of heaven. But one who ruled badly would cause the mandate to be removed. When the People's Republic of China was formed in 1949, they claimed the Mandate of Heaven from the people."}

He was one of the best known scientists of his time. In 1839, he coined the term 'protoplasm' for the fluid substance of a cell.\nBiography.\nPurkyn\u011b was born in Bohemia, which was then in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, now it is in the Czech Republic. In 1818, he graduated with a degree in medicine, and was appointed Professor of Physiology. He published two volumes which contributed to experimental psychology. He created the world's first Department of Physiology at the University of Breslau in Prussia (now Wroc\u0142aw, Poland), and the world's first official physiology laboratory.\nDiscoveries.\nHe is best known for his discoveries of Purkinje cells and Purkinje fibres. Purkinje cells are large neurons with many branching dendrites found in the cerebellum. Purkinje fibres conduct electrical impulses to all parts of the ventricle of the heart. Other discoveries include Purkinje images, reflections of objects from structures of the eye, and the Purkinje shift, the change in the brightness of red and blue colours as light intensity decreases gradually at dusk. Purkyn\u011b also introduced the scientific terms plasma (for the component of blood left when the suspended cells have been removed) and protoplasm (the substance found inside cells.)\nPurkyn\u011b was the first to use a microtome to make wafer thin slices of tissue for microscopic examination and was among the first to use an improved version of the compound microscope. He described the effects of camphor, opium, belladonna and turpentine on humans in 1829. He also experimented with nutmeg that same year, when he \"washed down three ground nutmegs with a glass of wine and experienced headaches, nausea, euphoria, and hallucinations that lasted several days\", which remain a good description of today's average nutmeg binge. Purkyn\u011b discovered sweat glands in 1833 and published a thesis that recognised nine principal configuration groups of fingerprints in 1823.\nCell theory.\nPurkyn\u011b was, in the opinion of Henry Harris, the true father of the cell theory. The work of Purkyn\u011b and his student and collaborator Gabriel Valentin (1810\u20131883) was \"unjustly denigrated by the nationalistic Germans. They have a claim to some priority in the cell theory\".Chapter 9 \nJohannes M\u00fcller (1801\u20131858) also made great contributions. However, it was Theodor Schwann and Matthias Schleiden (1804\u20131881) who got the credit for the cell theory, despite the fact that some of their observations were not correct, and their credits to previous workers were \"a travesty\".p97"}

It is a main theory of Keynesian economics.\nIt is a kind of prisoner's dilemma: saving benefits each individual but damages the general population. This is a paradox because it is contrary to intuition. Someone might think that what seems to be good for an individual in the economy will be good for the entire population. However, exercising thrift may be good for an individual by enabling that individual to save for a \"rainy day\", and yet not be good for the economy as a whole.\nThere is little agreement as to how important this is in a modern economy.

It served as his personal ship between England and Normandy afterwards. It was the largest and fastest ship in his invasion fleet. The Mora was a gift to William by his wife Matilda of Flanders.\nThe ship.\nThe \"Mora\" was built at Barfleur in Normandy. It was a gift from Matilda of Flanders to her husband Duke William of Normandy. It was completed in the summer of 1066. Mora was a larger ship that could carry ten to twelve knights with their , weapons and . It would also have a crew to sail it. The captain of the ship was Stephen, the son of Airard. Stephen was the captain of the Mora for over twenty years. Orderic Vitalis described the ship: \"it had for its the image of a child, gilt, pointing with its right hand towards England, and having in its mouth a trumpet of ivory. \"Mora\" carried sails and at the top of the was the papal banner (Pope's flag), consecrated and sent to William from Rome. The banner was described as \"a square white banner charged with a gold cross within a blue border.\"\nMaiden voyage.\nBefore sunset on September 27th, according to William of Poitiers, Duke William's invasion fleet left for England. The Mora led the fleet. Mora carried a lantern on her mast so she could be seen in the dark. A horn also let the other ships know where the Mora was. The Mora was much faster than the other ships. By dawn William found himself in mid-channel, alone, with no other ships in sight. While he waited his servants served him breakfast with wine. Once the others were in sight the fleet proceeded to Pevensey in Sussex. According to Elisabeth van Houts, the meaning of the name is not known although there have been several suggestions. It might be named for the \"Morini\", ancient inhabitants of Flanders. This is where Matilda was from. The Latin word \"mora\" has several meanings, none of which seem likely. These range from 'delay' or 'pause' to 'foolish' or 'foolish woman'. Also is the possibility that \"Mora\" was an anagram of \"Amor\"."}

These devices use optical technology such as infrared light. Some readers use an integrated decoder, others have one unit for reading the barcode, and another one to decode the barcode. A barcode reader, also called a price scanner or point-of-sale ( POS ) scanner, is a hand-held or stationary input device used to capture and read information contained in a bar code . A barcode reader consists of a scanner , a decoder (either built-in or external), and a cable used to connect the reader with a computer. Because a barcode reader merely captures and translates the barcode into numbers and/or letters, the data must be sent to a computer so that a software application can make sense of the data. Barcode scanners can be connected to a computer through a serial port , keyboard port , or an interface device called a wedge . A barcode reader works by directing a beam of light across the bar code and measuring the amount of light that is reflected back. The dark bars on a barcode reflect less light than the white spaces between them. The barcode scanner then converts the reflected light energy into electrical energy, which is converted into data by the decoder and forwarded to a computer.\nThere are five basic kinds of barcode readers -- pen wands, slot scanners, Charge-Couple Device ( CCD ) scanners, image scanners, and laser scanners.\nA pen wand is the simplest barcode reader. It contains no moving parts and is known for its durability and low cost. A pen wand can present a challenge to the user, however, because it has to remain in direct contact with the bar code, must be held at a certain angle, and has to be moved over the bar code at a certain speed.\nA slot scanner remains stationary and the item with the bar code on it is pulled by hand through the slot. Slot scanners are typically used to scan bar codes on identification cards.\nA CCD scanner has a better read-range than the pen wand and is often used in retail sales. Typically, a CCD scanner has a \"gun\" type interface and has to be held no more than one inch from the bar code. Each time the bar code is scanned, several readings are taken to reduce the possibility of errors. A disadvantage of the CCD scanner is that it cannot read a bar code that is wider than its input face.\nAn image scanner, also called a camera reader, uses a small video camera to capture an image of the bar code and then uses sophisticated digital image processing techniques to decode the bar code. It can read a bar code from about 3 to 9 inches away and generally costs less than a laser scanner.\nA laser scanner, either hand-held or stationary, does not have to be close to the bar code in order to do its job. It uses a system of mirrors and lenses to allow the scanner to read the bar code regardless of orientation, and can easily read a bar code up to 24 inches away. To reduce the possibility of errors, a laser scanning may perform up to 500 scans per second. Specialized long-range laser scanners are capable of reading a bar code up to 30 feet away."}

Then Marcello Malpighi, Hooke, Nehemiah Grew and Antonie van Leeuwenhoek had a virtually untried tool in their hands as they began their investigations. \nWorking on frogs and extrapolating to humans, Malpighi demonstrated the structure of the lungs, previously thought to be a homogeneous mass of flesh, and he offered an explanation for how air and blood mixed in the lungs. Malpighi also used the microscope for his studies of the skin, kidneys, and liver. For example, after he dissected the body of a black man, Malpighi made some groundbreaking headway into the origin of black skin. He found that the black pigment was associated with a layer of mucus just beneath the skin.\nHe was the first to see capillaries in animals, and he discovered the link between arteries and veins. He may have been the first person to see this under a microscope. The microscope let Malpighi discover that the silk worm does not use lungs to breathe, but small holes in their skin called spiracles. This turned out to be true of all insects. \nBecause Malpighi had a wide knowledge of both plants and animals, and he made contributions to the study of both. The Royal Society in London published two volumes of his botanical and zoological works in 1675 and 1679. Another edition followed in 1687, and a supplementary volume in 1697. In his autobiography, Malpighi speaks of his \"Anatome Plantarum\", decorated with the engravings of Robert White (1645\u20131703) as \"the most elegant format in the whole literate world\". "}

His is celebrated on December 3rd. \nCareer.\nBirinus may have been a Lombard by birth. He was sent by Pope Honorius I to help convert pagans in Anglo-Saxon England. The pope first sent him to Genoa. There \nArchbishop Asterius of Milan consecrated Birinus as a bishop. Birinus arrived in southern Britain . He had planned to go to the midlands of England to preach there. But when he found the Gewisse in Wessex were completely pagan, he decided to stay with them. He began to convert the Gewisse (West Saxons) to Christianity. In 635 King Cynegils of Wessex was baptized by Birinus and King Oswald of Northumbria agreed to be his Godfather. This may have been a condition of the marriage between Oswald and Cynegils's daughter, Cyneburh. He gave Bishop Birinus the city of Dorchester and several churches so he could convert the pagans in Wessex. \nIn Birinus founded a church at Winchester which later became Winchester Cathedral. Birinus died in 650. He was buried at Dorchester. \nRelics of St. Birinus.\nAfter 660 there were no more West Saxon Bishops at Dorchester. Along with part of Berkshire it was taken over by Mercia. The new see for Wessex was now at Winchester. Some time around 690\u2013700 Bishop Hedda of Winchester had the relics (bones) of St. Birinus moved from Dorchester to Winchester. Up to this time Bishop Birinus had been considered a minor saint. In 1223 monks of Dorchester abbey located the tomb of a former Bishop. The body was dressed in the garments and tunic of a bishop so they believed it was St. Birinus. At the time of the discovery miracles were claimed. One claim was that a dumb child could suddenly speak English and French. The monks sent their findings to Rome. The pope wrote to Stephen Langton, the Archbishop of Canterbury asking him to manage the translation. But a problem caused the ceremony to be delayed. Archbishop Langton discovered the body had already been moved to Winchester . Both Dorchester and Winchester claimed to have the relics of Bishop Birinus. For that reason two feast days were observed for him, December 3rd and 4th. The Catholic Church recognizes December 3rd. A shrine was created for him in the 14th century. It was later destroyed, but it has been rebuilt since."}

His work on insects showed that the stages an insect life \u2013 egg, larva, pupa, and adult \u2013 are different forms of the same animal. He did experiments on muscle contraction. In 1658, he was the first to observe and describe red blood cells. He was one of the first people to use the microscope in dissections, and his techniques remained useful for hundreds of years.\nResearch on insects.\nKnowledge of insects in the 17th century was to a great extent inherited from Aristotle. Swammerdam dissected insects and studied them under microscopes.\nSwammerdam showed that insects develop in the same gradual manner as do other animals. He wanted to dispel the seventeenth-century idea that different life stages of an insect (e.g. caterpillar and butterfly) were different individuals. \nHe got evidence from his dissections. By examining larvae, he identified adult features in pre-adult animals. For example, he noticed that the wings of dragonflies and mayflies exist before their final molt. Swammerdam used these observations in his 1669 publication, \"Historia Insectorum Generalis\" (The Natural History of Insects). This work included many descriptions of insect anatomy. It was here that Swammerdam revealed that the \"king\" bee has ovaries. \"Biblia natura\" published posthumously in 1737, carried the first confirmation that the queen bee is the sole mother of the colony. Despite five intense years of beekeeping, the mode of honey bee reproduction escaped him as he wrote, \"I do not believe the male bees actually copulate with the females.\""}

John Rosbrugh (c. 1714\u20131777) (also spelled Rosborough and Rosburgh) was a graduate of the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University). He was ordained a Presbyterian minister. In 1776 he organized and commanded the 3rd Northampton County, Pennsylvania . He then then accepted a commission as company chaplain. He was killed at the Battle of the Assunpink Creek, also known as the Second Battle of Trenton. Rosbrugh was the first U.S. chaplain ever killed in battle.\nEarly career.\nJohn Rosbrugh was born in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland. He to the United States along with his older brother, William. The family was originally from Craigie, County Ayrshire, Scotland. His ancestors went to Ireland during the settling of the Ulster Plantation. In 1733 his young wife Sarah died in childbirth along with their only child. He was a tradesman but well enough educated to prepare himself for college.\nMinistry.\nHe attended the College of New Jersey where he graduated in 1761. He was licensed to preach in August of 1763. In October 1764 he was sent to the congregations of Greenwich, Oxford, and Mansfield Woodhouse, all in western New Jersey. In December 1764 he became a Presbyterian minister. By 1765, he was asked to serve neighboring congregations in Upper and Lower Hardwick in Warren County, New Jersey. In 1766, Rev. Rosbrugh married Jane Ralston. She was the daughter of James Ralston of East Allen Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania. It was then called 'the Irish Settlement.' In 1769 Rev. Rosbrugh was called to serve at the church at Allen Township. This was the same congregation his wife was from. He became their permanent minister. For seven years, he led his congregation in Allen township.\nRevolutionary war.\nAt the start of the American Revolutionary War, news was often read to congregations in their churches. It was one of the main forms of communication at the time. On December 10, 1776, General George Washington called out the militia of Pennsylvania. He wrote to the colonels of the militias of Northampton and Bucks counties asking them and their men to join him as quickly as possible. Rev. Rosebrugh read General Washington's letter to his congregation. The men of the congregation formed a company of militia and agreed to go to war \"if\" Rev. Rosbrugh would lead them. He had expected to accompany them as their chaplain but reluctantly agreed to lead them. John Rosbrugh took his place at the head of the company and slinging his musket over his shoulder led the company to join General Washington and the Continental Army in Philadelphia.\nWhile in Philadelphia, Rev. Rosbrugh was given a commission as a Chaplain. Captain John Hays took his place as company commander. A chaplain at that time held the rank of major and pay of thirty-three and a half dollars per month. Presbyterian ministers, however, were particularly hated by the British and if captured suffered cruel treatment. Rev. Rosbrugh\u2019s company joined the rest of the Northampton county militia in camp. Rosbrugh also met with his brother-in-law, John Ralston, a member of the Second Continental Congress. The 3rd Battalion was under the command of General Israel Putnam. He had orders to cross the Delaware on the 25th of December in support of Washington\u2019s surprise attack on Trenton. However General Putnam decided not to cross due to weather conditions. So Rev. Rosbrugh\u2019s battalion remained in Philadelphia. After General Washington crossed back to Pennsylvania he decided to take Trenton a second time. This time the 3rd Northampton militia was included. The battle was called the second battle of Trenton or the battle of Assinpink creek.\nDeath and burial.\nOn the afternoon of January 2nd the Americans were preparing their positions for the upcoming battle. Rev. John Rosbrugh was dining at a public house when a warning was shouted that Hessians were coming. Going outside he found his horse had been taken. He tried to get back to the American lines which were on the other side of Assunpink Creek. But he was suddenly confronted by a company of Hessians under the command of a British officer. He surrendered but they recognized him as a Presbyterian minister. The Hessians him to death. They took his watch and money then left his body naked in the snow. Captain Hays, the company commander, recovered the body and quickly buried him where he fell. The next morning Rev. George Duffield, a brother Presbyterian chaplain moved Rev. Rosbrugh's body to the nearby graveyard of the First Presbyterian Church of Trenton. It is believed he still rests there today. His widow, Jane (n\u00e9e Ralston) survived him by 32 years. She was buried in the East Allen Township cemetery, the inscription on her tombstone indicating her husband John is buried beside her.\nFamily.\nAbout 1766, John Rosbrugh married secondly, Jane Ralston (1739\u20131809). She was the daughter of James Ralston of the Irish Settlement or Allen Township, PA. John and Jane had five children:&lt;br&gt;"}

It is the ratio of the average mass per atom of an element from a given sample to 1/12 the mass of a carbon-12 atom. In other words, a relative atomic mass tells you the number of times an average atom of an element from a given sample is heavier than one-twelfth of an atom of carbon-12. The word \"relative\" in relative atomic mass refers to this scaling relative to carbon-12. Relative atomic mass values are ratios; relative atomic mass is a dimensionless quantity. Relative atomic mass is the same as \"atomic weight\", which is the older term.\nThe number of protons an atom has determines what element it is. However, most elements in nature consist of atoms with different numbers of neutrons. An atom of an element with a certain number of neutrons is called an isotope. For example, the element thallium has two common isotopes: thallium-203 and thallium-205. Both isotopes of thallium have 81 protons, but thallium-205 has 124 neutrons, 2 more than thallium-203, which has 122. Each isotope has its own mass, called its isotopic mass. A relative isotopic mass is the mass of an isotope relative to 1/12 the mass of a carbon-12 atom. The relative isotopic mass of an isotope is roughly the same as its mass number, which is the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. Like relative atomic mass values, relative isotopic mass values are ratios with no units.\nWe can find the relative atomic mass of a sample of an element by working out the abundance-weighted mean of the relative isotopic masses. For example, if a sample of thallium is made up of 30% thallium-203 and 70% thallium-205,\nTwo samples of an element that consists of more than one isotope, collected from two widely spaced sources on Earth, are expected to have slightly different relative atomic masses. This is because the proportions of each isotope are slightly different at different locations.\nA standard atomic weight is the mean value of relative atomic masses of a number of normal samples of the element. Standard atomic weight values are published at regular intervals by the Commission on Isotopic Abundances and Atomic Weights of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). The standard atomic weight for each element is on the periodic table.\nOften, the term relative atomic mass is used to mean standard atomic weight. This is not quite correct, because relative atomic mass is a less specific term that refers to individual samples. Individual samples of an element could have a relative atomic mass different to the standard atomic weight for the element. For example, a sample from another planet could have a relative atomic mass very different to the standard Earth-based value.\nRelative atomic mass is not the same as:"}

It was founded by the Swiss hotelier, C\u00e9sar Ritz, in collaboration with the chef Auguste Escoffier in 1898. The new hotel was constructed behind the fa\u00e7ade of a Town house from the 18th-century. It overlooks one of the central squares in Paris.\nIt was one of the first hotels in Europe to provide a bathroom \"en suite\", a telephone and electricity for each room. It established a reputation for luxury. The clients have included royalty, politicians, writers, film stars and singers. Several of its suites are named in honour of famous guests of the hotel, for example Coco Chanel and Ernest Hemingway who lived at the hotel for years. One of the bars of the hotel, \"Bar Hemingway\", is devoted to Hemingway.\nThe Ritz has the reputation of being the most expensive hotel in Paris. The rooms as of May 2011 started at \u20ac850 a night. Suites start at \u20ac3,600 and cost up to \u20ac13,900 a night for the most expensive ones (the \"Suite Imp\u00e9riale\" is the most expensive). The Ritz employs more than 600 people.\n\"L'Espadon\" is a world-renowned restaurant. It attracts aspiring chefs from all over the world who come to learn at the nearby Ritz-Escoffier School. The cuisine is run by the award-winning chef Michel Roth, the ninth head chef of the hotel. The restaurant was awarded a second star by the 2009 edition of the influential Michelin Red Guide.\nDuring the Second World War, the German Luftwaffe used the hotel as local headquarters in Paris. The son of C\u00e9sar Ritz, Charles, died in 1976. The last members of the Ritz family who owned the hotel sold it to the Egyptian businessman Mohamed Al-Fayed in 1979. In August 1997, Diana, Princess of Wales and Al-Fayed's son, Dodi, dined in the hotel's Imperial Suite before their fatal car crash.\nThe hotel is being entirely renovated. It has been closed since 1 August 2012 and will open its doors in March 2016, after a delay of nearly two years. Because of its status as a symbol of high society and luxury, the hotel has featured in many novels (for example F.

In 1829 he accompanied Alexander von Humboldt through eastern Russia to the Chinese frontier. After his return he began to concentrate his studies on microscopic organisms, which then were not much studied.\nFor nearly 30 years Ehrenberg examined samples of water, soil, sediment, blowing dust and rock and described thousands of new species, among them well-known flagellates such as Euglena, ciliates such as \"Paramecium aurelia\" and \"Paramecium caudatum\", and many fossils, in nearly 400 scientific publications. He was particularly interested in a unicellular group of protists called diatoms, but he also studied, and named, many species of radiolaria, foraminifera and dinoflagellates.\nThese researches built up our knowledge of the microorganisms of certain geological formations, especially of the chalk, and of the marine and freshwater accumulations. Until Ehrenberg took up the study it was not known that considerable masses of rock were composed of minute forms of animals or plants. He also demonstrated that the phosphorescence of the sea was due to organisms.\nHe was a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences from 1836 and a foreign member of the Royal Society of London from 1837. In 1839, he won the Wollaston Medal, the highest award granted by the Geological Society of London. He continued until late in life to investigate the microscopic organisms of the deep sea and of various geological formations. He died in Berlin on 27 June 1876.\nLegacy.\nAfter his death in 1876, his collections of microscopic organisms were deposited in the Humboldt Museum at the University of Berlin. The \"Ehrenberg Collection\" includes 40,000 microscope preparations, 5,000 raw samples, 3,000 pencil and ink drawings, and nearly 1,000 letters of correspondence.

On the island, an Anindilyakwa man gave Tindale detailed descriptions of which land belonged to his family and which land did not. This led Tindale to question the widely held belief among European Australians at the time, which was that Aboriginal people were nomadic and had no connection to any specific area. Tindale's maps have been superseded by more accurate ones.\nAfter his retirement from the South Australian Museum, Tindale began teaching at the University of Colorado. He lived in the United States until his death, aged 93, in Palo Alto, California.\nAwards.\nTindale was made an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in 1994, shortly after his death."}

It had electric lights throughout the building, electric lifts, bathrooms in most of the lavishly furnished rooms, constant hot and cold running water, and many other innovations. D'Oyly Carte hired manager C\u00e9sar Ritz and French chef Auguste Escoffier, who established the highest quality in service, entertainment and dining. The hotel attracted royalty and other rich guests and diners. Winston Churchill frequently took his cabinet to lunch at the hotel.\nThe hotel became Carte's most successful venture. Its bands, Savoy Orpheans and the Savoy Havana Band, became famous, and other entertainers (who were also often guests) included George Gershwin, Frank Sinatra, Lena Horne and No\u00ebl Coward. Famous guests have included Edward VII, Enrico Caruso, Charlie Chaplin, Otto Hahn, Harry Truman, Joan Crawford, Judy Garland, Babe Ruth, Laurence Olivier, Marilyn Monroe, John Wayne, Humphrey Bogart, Elizabeth Taylor, Barbra Streisand, Bob Dylan, The Beatles and numerous others.\nThe hotel is now managed by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts. It has been called \"London's most famous hotel\". It is still one of London's most prestigious and opulent hotels, with 268 rooms and panoramic views of the River Thames across Savoy Place and the Thames Embankment.

FGM is also called female genital cutting and female circumcision. It is done for traditional reasons, as part of a ritual, not for medical reasons.\nFGM is most common in 27 African countries, as well as Yemen and Iraqi Kurdistan. However, it also happens in other countries in Asia, the Middle East and around the world. Usually, FGM is not done by a doctor or in a hospital. It is often done with a razor blade or other sharp instruments, in many cases without anesthesia.\nDifferent ethnic groups do different kinds of FGM. They also do FGM at different ages. Some groups do FGM when infants are only a few days old. Others do it when girls reach puberty, or are older. In about half the countries where FGM happens, most girls have FGM before they are five years old.\nFGM can cause serious health problems, like infections, chronic pain, trouble getting pregnant and giving birth, bleeding so bad that it can kill. FGM does not make a person's health better in any way.\nFGM is illegal in most of the countries where it happens. However, these laws are often ignored. Since the 1970s, many countries have tried to stop FGM. In 2012, the United Nations General Assembly said that FGM is a human rights problem, and voted to try harder to stop it. The World Health Organization and the \"Maputo Protocol\" to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights also say that FGM must be stopped.\nTypes of female genital mutilation.\nThere are many different types of female genital mutilation. The World Health Organization (WHO) has created four basic categories of FGM, called Types 1-IV.\nType I.\nIn Type I FGM, part or all of the clitoris is cut off. The clitoris is the female organ that makes sex feel good for women. Without it, a woman usually cannot have an orgasm.\nType II.\nThere are a few forms of Type II FGM. All of them involve cutting off part or all of the inner labia, the two flaps of skin on the sides of the opening to the vagina. The forms of Type II FGM are:\nType III.\nType III FGM is usually called infibulation. It is the most severe form of FGM. The genitals outside a woman's body are cut off and the wound is sewn shut with thread and thorns. The different types of infibulation are:\nWhen the labia are sewn shut, one small hole is left open so the girl can urinate and menstruate. The hole is kept open by putting something like a twig into the wound. To help the wound close, the girl's legs are tied together, often from hip to ankle, for up to six weeks.\nAfter the woman gets married, her vagina is cut open so she can have sex. A midwife might cut open the vagina with a knife, or the woman's husband might tear it open with his penis. If the woman gets pregnant, the vagina is opened more for childbirth, and then often sewn back up afterward (this is called re-infibulation).\nType IV.\nType IV FGM is anything else that is done to hurt the genitals, like scraping, burning, scarring, or cutting the genitals without cutting them off. This procedure will be heartbreaking for women, when they get to know about this in later life.\nPrevalence.\nIn many countries where FGM is common, almost every woman and girl in the country has had FGM. In other countries, millions of women and girls have had FGM over many years.\nIn 25 countries in Africa and the Middle East, over 125 million women and girls have had FGM. This includes:\nIn some of these same 25 countries, FGM is very common. It is most common in these countries:\nHowever, in other countries, FGM is not as common. For example, of the 25 countries where FGM happens most often, it is least common in these countries:\nComplications.\nFGM can hurt women's physical and mental health throughout their lives.\nThe type of complications that a girl or woman might have from FGM depend on many things, like:\nShort-term complications.\n\"Short-term complications\" are health problems caused by FGM soon after the FGM happened. Common short-term complications include:\nMore serious short-term complications can cause symptoms that can kill a woman. They include:\nNobody knows how many girls and women die from FGM.\nLate complications.\nLate complications happen later on after FGM is done. For example:\nPainful periods are common because it is very difficult for the monthly menstrual blood to get out of the tiny hole left by infibulation. Blood can fill the vagina and uterus, and stay there without moving. If the vagina gets completely blocked, the vagina and uterus can fill up completely with menstrual blood. Because women with this problem do not menstruate, and blood builds up in their abdomen (making it swell), it can be confused with pregnancy.\nPregnancy and childbirth.\nFGM may increase a woman's risk of having problems during pregnancy and childbirth. For example, women who had infibulations are more likely to:\nFGM also raises the risk that a woman's baby will die soon after it is born. In 2008, the WHO estimated that 10\u201320 babies out of every 1,000 die because their mothers had FGM. All types of FGM were found to raise babies' risk of death, which was:\nEffects on mental health &amp; sexual function.\nThere is not much information about the effects of FGM on women's and girls' mental health. However, a few small studies have found that women with FGM often have anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\nStudies on how FGM affects women's ability to have sex have also been small. In total, in 2013, there had been 15 studies involving 12,671 women from seven countries. When all the information from these studies was put together, researchers found that:"}

He gave his name to the H\u00f4tel Ritz Paris and The Ritz Hotel in London. His motto was \"king of hoteliers, and hotelier to kings\". His name is the origin of the word \"ritzy\".\nBiography.\nAt fifteen Ritz was apprenticed as a \"somelier\" (wine waiter) at a hotel in Brig. Dismissed after a year as an unsuitable candidate for the hotel trade, he went to Paris at the time of the 1867 Universal Exhibition.\nRitz's formative five years in Paris, including the siege of 1870 during the Franco-Prussian War, gave him sufficient polish and confidence to transform himself from a waiter and general factotum into a \"ma\u00eetre d'h\u00f4tel\", manager, and eventually hotelier.\nIn 1872, Ritz became floor waiter of the H\u00f4tel Splendide in Paris, meeting many rich, self-made Americans as guests. In 1873 he was a waiter in Vienna at the time of the International Exhibition. In the winter of that year his astonishing career in hotel management began when he undertook the direction of the restaurant at the Grand H\u00f4tel in Nice. Regular moves then followed. He followed the migration of the international tourist set from the hotels of Nice or San Remo in winter to Swiss mountain resorts such as Rigi-Kulm and Lucerne in summer.\nIn 1878, he became the manager of the Grand H\u00f4tel National in Lucerne and held the same position, in parallel, at the Grand H\u00f4tel in Monaco until 1888. A pioneer in the development of luxury hoteliering, he knew how to entice wealthy customers and got a reputation for good taste and elegance. He was the first to say that \"the customer is never wrong\". His code was \"See all without looking; hear all without listening; be attentive without being servile; anticipate without being presumptuous. If a diner complains about a dish or the wine, immediately remove it and replace it, no questions asked\".\nIn 1888, he opened a restaurant with Auguste Escoffier in Baden-Baden, and the two were then invited to London by Richard D'Oyly Carte to become the first manager and chef of the Savoy Hotel, positions they held from 1889 until 1897. Ritz put together what he described as \"a little army of hotel men for the conquest of London\". The Savoy under Ritz was an immediate success, attracting a distinguished and moneyed clientele, headed by the Prince of Wales. Aristocratic women, hitherto unaccustomed to dine in public, were now \"seen in full regalia in the Savoy dining and supper rooms\".\nFall from grace.\nIn 1898, Ritz and Escoffier were both dismissed from the Savoy. Ritz was implicated in the disappearance of over \u00a33,400 of wine and spirits, as well as kickbacks from suppliers. The following report is from the London \"Daily Telegraph\":\nIndependent entrepreneur.\nLater in 1898, he opened the celebrated H\u00f4tel Ritz in the Place Vend\u00f4me, Paris. He went on to open The Ritz Hotel in London in 1906, which became one of the most popular meeting places of the era, for the rich and famous. The Hotel Ritz Madrid in Madrid, opened in 1910, inspired by King Alfonso XIII's desire to build a luxury hotel to rival the Ritz in Paris. Ritz enjoyed a long partnership with Auguste Escoffier, the famous French chef and father of modern French cooking. The partnership lasted until Ritz had to retire in 1907 because of deteriorating health.\nTowards the end.\nRitz himself withdrew progressively from the affairs of his various companies, selling out his interests in hotels at Frankfurt and Salsomaggiore in 1905 and retiring from the Ritz Hotel Development Company in 1907, from the Carlton Hotel Company in 1908, and from the Paris Ritz Company in 1911.\nBy 1912, according to Marie-Louise Ritz, to all intents and purposes his life had finished. In 1913 he was placed in a private hospital at Lausanne, and the following year he was moved to another on Lake K\u00fcssnacht in Canton Schwyz. He died at K\u00fcssnacht on 26 October 1918.

Menus have been around in Europe since the 18th century. There is a special need for them in Chinese cuisine because of the wide range of dishes on offer. Menus have been discovered from the Song Dynasty in China. In the larger cities of the time, the variety of cuisine from different regions led caterers to create a list for their patrons.\nIn restaurants, the modern menu, with dishes in a set order of courses, was invented by the great French chef Escoffier. Usually there are two types of menu at a good restaurant:\nLesser establishments might offer a chalkboard, with the advantage that items can be rubbed out or added on at short notice. Fish restaurants in particular depend on daily catches being supplied or bought in the early morning. They usually list fish freshly bought (as opposed to frozen).\nIn American restaurant management, \"menu engineering\" has become a branch of marketing."}

It can live as a saprophyte, or as an opportunistic parasite in weakened tree hosts to cause root or butt rot. It is found in temperate regions of Asia, North America, and Europe. The species forms fruit bodies singly or in groups in soil or rotting wood. The fungus has been accidentally introduced to South Africa.\n\"Armillaria gallica\" is a largely subterranean fungus, and it produces fruit bodies that are up to about in diameter, yellow-brown, and covered with small scales. On the underside of the caps are gills that are white to creamy or pale orange.\nThe fungus develops an extensive system of underground root-like structures, called rhizomorphs which help it to decompose dead wood in temperate broadleaf and mixed forests. It has been the subject of considerable scientific research. Its ability to bioluminesce and its ability to form large and long-lived colonies are especially interesting.\nHumongous fungus.\nResearchers reported finding \"Armillaria gallica\" in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in the early 1990s. In one forest stand, \"Armillaria\"-infected oak trees had been harvested, and their stumps were left to rot in the field. Later, when red pines were planted in the same location, the seedlings were killed by the fungus \"A.\u00a0gallica\" (then known as \"A.\u00a0bulbosa\").\nUsing sequence analysis, they found that the underground mycelia of one individual fungal colony covered , weighing over , with an estimated age of 1,500 years. The analysis examined genetic samples collected in the forest from fruit bodies and rhizomorphs. Samples from the 15-hectare area had identical mating type alleles and mitochondrial DNA fragments. This showed the samples were all from a single genetic individual, or clone, which reached its size through vegetative growth. The authors noted: \"This is the first report estimating the minimum size, mass, and age of an unambiguously defined fungal individual. Although the number of observations for plants and animals is much greater, members of the fungal kingdom should now be recognized as among the oldest and largest organisms on earth\". After the \"Nature\" paper was published, media outlets from around the world visited the site where the specimens were found. As a result of this publicity, the individual acquired the common name \"humongous fungus\". There was afterward some scholarly debate as to whether the fungus qualified to be considered in the same category as other large organisms such as the blue whale or the giant redwood."}

It was first published on 25 April 1719 by William Taylor.\nThe novel's full title is \"The Life and Strange Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, Of York, Mariner: Who lived Eight and Twenty Years, all alone in an un-inhabited Island on the Coast of America, near the Mouth of the Great River of Oroonoque; Having been cast on Shore by Shipwreck, wherein all the Men perished but himself. With An Account how he was at last as strangely deliver'd by Pyrates\".\nThe book is a fictional autobiography of the title character, Robinson Crusoe. Crusoe leaves the safety of his comfortable middle-class home in England and goes to sea. He is shipwrecked and becomes a castaway who spends years on a remote tropical island near Trinidad. He meets cannibals, captives and mutineers, and is eventually rescued.\nFor the first edition, Defoe pretended that the novel was a true story. He said the fictional protagonist Robinson Crusoe was the author and he pretended to be the editor of Crusoe's autobiography. This led many readers to believe that Crusoe was a real person and the book a true account of his life.\nMany people think the story was influenced by the life of Alexander Selkirk. Selkirk was a Scottish castaway who lived for over four years on a Pacific island belonging to Chile called M\u00e1s a Tierra. (In 1966, the island was renamed Robinson Crusoe Island.) However, there are other possible sources. For example, Ibn Tufail's earlier novel \"Hayy ibn Yaqdhan\", also set on a desert island, may have inspired Defoe.\nCritical response to \"Robinson Crusoe\" has been diverse and argumentative. There has been widespread disagreement about the novel's nature and origin, values, structure, and meaning. Literary historians have not agreed on Defoe's sincerity, exact intentions, and achievement in the book.\n\"Robinson Crusoe\" was very popular as soon as it was published. Before the end of 1719, it had already run through four editions. The novel's popularity has continued and it has become one of the most widely published books in history. It has prompted many imitations and adaptations for stage, film, and television."}

This is meant to be a humorous reference.\nIn popular culture.\nThe dramatic monologue \"Not I\" by Samuel Beckett is an example of logorrhea. So is Lucky's speech in the play \"Waiting for Godot\".\nIn the 1999 E.W. Scripps National Spelling Bee, the spelling bee champion Nupur Lala won with the word logorrhea. Then a documentary, \"Spellbound\" was made about the spelling bee."}

It happened on the night of February 26, 2012. Martin was shot by George Zimmerman. The case has been given a lot of coverage by the media. Zimmerman was declared not guilty of manslaughter. However, many people believe Zimmerman racially discriminated Martin.\nShooting and trial.\nTrayvon Martin was African American. He was a 17-year-old high school student at the time. Martin had been walking to his father's girlfriend's house, where he was staying. He had gone to the 7-Eleven to buy a packet of Skittles. The house was in a gated community. The shooter, George Zimmerman, was the coordinator of the neighborhood watch in this community. Zimmerman is a mixed race Hispanic man. He shot Martin in the chest, killing the teenager.\nWhen he was shot, Martin had been talking on his mobile phone to his girlfriend. He was wearing a hoodie. Zimmerman had thought Martin looked suspicious. He called the emergency telephone number (911) and the operator told him that he did not need to follow Martin. Zimmerman did anyway. People are not sure what happened after this. When police arrived at the location of the shooting, Zimmerman said that Martin had punched him in the nose and knocked him onto the pavement. Martin had not been carrying a weapon when he was shot. \nPolice did not arrest Zimmerman until six weeks later. This was because of Florida's stand-your-ground law, which allows people to shoot others in order to defend themselves. Zimmerman was put on trial. On July 13, 2013, a jury decided that he was not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter. Protests were held in more than 100 cities in the United States by people who thought that decision was unfair. President Barack Obama made spoke in response to public anger about the trial verdict on July 19. He said, \"Trayvon Martin could have been me, 35 years ago\". Maddy, a juror for the trial, told ABC News that Zimmerman \"got away with murder\".\nLater events.\nThe media coverage about this case has continued even after Zimmerman was declared not guilty.\nGeraldo Rivera said on \"Fox and Friends\", \"I think the hoodie is as much responsible for Trayvon Martin's death as much as George Zimmerman was.\" This made a lot of people angry. They said it was victim blaming.\nAn episode of the cartoon comedy \"South Park\", \"World War Zimmerman\", was shown in October 2013. It parodied Zimmerman's trial. Jack Cashill wrote a book about the case called \"'If I had a Son': Race, Guns, and the Railroading of George Zimmerman\". It was published in October 2013.\nZimmerman was arrested on November 18, 2013. Police said that he was going to be put in prison. TMZ said that Zimmerman attacked his pregnant girlfriend. He has been charged with aggravated assault, domestic violence battery, and criminal mischief. Zimmerman was released on bail.\nLaws.\nIn October 2013, Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, demanded changes to the Stand Your Ground law. She said the law \"creates many opportunities for people to commit terrible acts of violence and evade justice\". She and Martin's father, Tracy Fulton, started the Trayvon Martin Foundation in 2012 to help victims of injustice.\nNeighborhood watchers in Sanford are now banned from carrying guns and following people. This is to avoid another event like Martin's killing and to make the neighborhood watch's reputation better."}

Romans enjoyed foodstuffs from the trade networks of the Roman Republic and Empire. Keeping up the food supply to the city of Rome was a major political issue in the late Republic. It became one of the ways the emperor expressed his relationship to the Roman people.\nThree meals a day was normal in ancient Rome, as today. In the morning, a breakfast called the \"ientaculum\" was served at dawn. Later, around 11:00\u00a0am, Romans ate a small lunch, and in the evening, they ate the \"cena\", the main meal of the day. In the Empire period, the \"cena\" increased in size and diversity. It was now eaten in the afternoon. The \"vesperna\", a light supper in the evening, was abandoned, and a second breakfast was introduced around noon, the \"prandium\".\nIn the lower strata of society, the old routine was kept: it corresponded more closely to the daily rhythms of manual labor.\nOriginally flat, round loaves made of emmer (a cereal related to wheat) with a bit of salt were eaten; among the upper classes, eggs, cheese, and honey, along with milk and fruit were also consumed. In the Empire period, around the beginning of the Christian era, bread made of wheat was introduced. Later, more and more wheaten foods began to replace emmer bread. Poor romans ate bread, vegetable, soup and porridge. Meat and shellfish were a luxury, unless they lived in the countryside and could go hunting or fishing.\nThe bread was sometimes dipped in wine and eaten with olives, cheese and grapes. They also ate wild boar, beef, sausages, pork, lamb, duck, goose, chickens, small birds and fish. Romans liked to make mealtimes fun by roasting hare with wings stuck on them to look like a flying horse. \nAt dinner slaves gave guests small hot bread rolls to wipe their plates clean. Roman flour contained a lot of dust and bits and this made bread so coarse that it wore down people's teeth. \nThe wealthier Romans liked to eat snails flattened on milk, peacock's brains and flamingos tongues.\n\"Cena\".\nAmong the upper classes, who did not do manual labor, all business was done in the morning. After the \"prandium\", a visit would be made to the baths. Around 2\u00a0p.m., the \"cena\" would begin. This meal could last until late in the night, especially if guests were invited, and would often be followed by a round of drinks.\nIn the period of the kings and the early republic, but also in later periods (for the working classes), the \"cena\" essentially consisted of a kind of porridge, the \"puls\". The simplest kind would be made from emmer, water, salt and fat. The more sophisticated kind was made with olive oil, with an accompaniment of assorted vegetables when available. The richer classes ate their \"puls\" with eggs, cheese, and honey and it was also occasionally served with meat or fish.\nOver the course of the Republican period, the \"cena\" developed into two courses: a main course and a dessert with fruit and seafood (e.g. molluscs, shrimp). By the end of the Republic, it was usual for the meal to be served in 3 parts: 1 course (\"gustatio\"), main course (\"primae mensae\"), and dessert (\"secundae mensae\").\nPoorer foods.\nIn contrast to the fine banquets, poor people ate the cheapest foods, so they had for breakfast grain made into twice-baked bread and porridge, and for lunch a vegetable and meat stew. The vegetables available included millet, onions, turnips, and olives with bread and oil on the side.\nAt dinner they had thin soup or meat with cheese, and a pudding of honey.\nRoman drink.\nThe Romans mainly drank wine, the main drink of the Empire, and water. The wine could be laced with spices and honey to improve the taste. Slaves poured wine and honeyed water in flasks. Slaves filled goblets with wine from large dishes. However, drinks such as milk were considered uncivilised and hence were only used for children, medical purposes and making cheese. The wine drunk across the empire was produced in Italy, Africa, Gaul, Spain and Greece. Beer was also drunk by Romans in Britain.\nRoman kitchens.\nRoman kitchens were usually small rooms, simply equipped with built-in clay ovens and wooden cupboards. A charcoal fire heated a brick hearth, where the cook fried or cooked food in earthenware or bronze pots for baking or roasting. They placed meats in the ashes. The Roman kitchens were small compared to the one we have today. The kitchen would also have large jars of olive oil, wine, vinegar and fish sauces, as well as a mortar for grinding up spices. Only richer people had kitchens, although they didn't cook because their slaves did it. Despite the simple facilities, the cooks and slaves produced spicy dishes of shellfish, wild boar, fruits and sweets."}

At his father's death in Penda was still an infant. Ceorl ruled Mercia following Penda's father. There are indications Penda was an underking in Mercia probably in charge of Western Mercia. This would have included the territory of the Hwicce. Later Penda had close ties to the Hwicce when he was king of Mercia.\nKing of Mercia.\nIn 626, according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle: \"This year Penda succeeded to the kingdom [of Mercia] and reigned thirty winters.\" As king of Mercia Penda's first victory came in 628. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for 628 says that Cyngils, king of Wessex, and Cwichelm his son 'fought with Penda at Cirencester and came to an agreement with him there'. The 'agreement' seems to have been to give Cirencester to Penda. It's likely Penda also got the territory of the Hwicce at this time. The agreement or treaty also seems to have been a marriage alliance. Penda married Cynewise, probably a sister of Cynegils. He formed an alliance with Cadwallon ap Cadfan of Gwynedd. Cadwallon was known to have been very hostile towards the Northumbrians. In 633 Penda joined him in invading Northumbria. At Battle of Hatfield Chase their combined armies defeated and killed King Edwin of Northumbria. Cadwallon remained in Northumbria for a year destroying everything he could. Penda left and returned to Mercia. He brought with him Eadfrith, the son of Edwin, as a prisoner possibly to set up as a puppet ruler in Northumbria under Penda. But Penda had him murdered a few years later. \nSometime after 633 Penda killed two East Anglian kings, Sigebert and Egric, in battle. He set up a vassal king in East Anglia. About 635 Penda's brother Eowa became a king in Mercia along with Penda. Possibly he ruled northern Mercia while Penda ruled in the south. In Cadwallon, Penda's ally, was defeated and killed by King Oswald of Northumbria. The armies of Oswald and Penda met in 641 at Maserfelth (later called Oswestry in Shropshire). What events led to the battle is not recorded. Penda defeated and killed Oswald. This left Penda the most powerful king in England. Nothing indicates that Penda claimed to be overlord however. In 643 Cenwalh succeeded Cynegils as king of Wessex. Cenwalh married a sister of Penda of Mercia. But in 645 when Cenwalh her (set her aside) in favor of another wife, Penda invaded Wessex. Penda drove Cenwalh into exile in East Anglia. While in exile, Wulfhere, the son of Penda, took a great deal of territory away from Wessex. He gave the Isle of Wight to Aethelwalh, King of Sussex. Cenwalh returned to his kingdom . In 650, possibly to teach him a lesson for sheltering Cenwalh, Penda drove King Anna of East Anglia out of his kingdom. Penda killed Anna in battle in .\nAfter King Oswald's death, Northumbria divided back into the two previous kingdoms of Bernicia and Deira. Each had their own king. Oswiu of Northumbria became king of Bernicia. He was Oswald's brother and Penda had a particular contempt for him. In 653 Deira came under Mercian control. In 654, hoping to put an end to Oswiu, Penda gathered all his allies and invaded Bernicia. Called the battle of the Winwaed he marched against Oswiu with 'thirty legions'. On Sunday, 15 November 655 the two armies met in battle near Leads. Although he had the larger army Penda was killed. This established Oswiu as king of all Northumbria and as overlord of all the English south of the River Humber. Penda was succeeded by his son Peada.\nFamily.\nPenda married Cynewise, his only known wife. All his children became Christian. Penda was the father of:"}

He was currently the oldest living person to have served in the United States Congress.\nEarly life.\nHechler was born in Roslyn, New York on September 20, 1914. He studied at Swarthmore College and later attended Columbia University.\nCareer.\nHechler faced a close race for the first (and as it turned out, only) time in 1972. Following the 1970 Census, West Virginia's population was low. The state legislature merged Hechler's district with most of the old 5th District, comprising several coal-mining counties around Bluefield and Beckley.\nThe 5th had been represented by Democrat James Kee of Bluefield since 1965, and members of his family had held the district continuously since 1933. On paper, the new district favored Kee, who retained 65 percent of his former territory. However, Hechler routed him in the Democratic primary by almost 26 points and easily won reelection in November. He was reelected in 1974 after being unopposed in the primary and general election.\nLater career.\nIn 1976, he entered a multi-candidate primary for governor, but lost that statewide race by a large margin.

This time, he won the Democratic primary by a plurality, but lost the general election to Republican Betty Ireland.\nPersonal life.\nSince 2004, Hechler has campaigned against mountaintop removal mining. On June 23, 2009, Hechler, then aged 94, participated in a protest near mountaintop removal mining sites in the West Virginia coalfields in the Coal River Valley along with others.

It is connected with Norse religion. No one knows where seid came from. It was practiced less with the spread of Christianity in Scandinavia. The practice was recorded in Norse stories (sagas) found by archeologists. Many scholars say that seid was like shamanism.\nBoth male and female Scandinavians practiced this form of magic. By doing so, they were often persecuted by society because they brought a taboo on themselves.\nIn pre-Christian Norse mythology, seid was associated with the god Odin, their god of war, poetry and sorcery. It was also associated with the goddess Freyja, who was their goddess of love and fertility.\nToday, followers of modern paganism adopted forms of magic that they called seid. Their practices have since been studied by many researchers in the field of pagan studies."}

Women in ancient Delphi, Gortyn, Thessaly, Megara and Sparta could own land, which was the most prestigious form of private property at the time.\nAthens.\nIn ancient Athens, women were not citizens. Until marriage, women were under the guardianship of their father or other male relative. After marriage, their husband (\"kyrios\") acted for the wife in all legal matters. Athenian women had limited property rights. Athenian women could enter into a contract worth less than the value of a \u201cmedimnos of barley\u201d (a measure of grain). This allowed women to engage in petty trading. \nSlaves, like free women, were not eligible for full citizenship in ancient Athens, but sometimes, rarely, they could become citizens if freed. Women, on the other hand, could never get full civil rights. No women ever acquired citizenship in ancient Athens, and so they were excluded from ancient Athenian democracy.\nSparta.\nBy contrast, Spartan women enjoyed a status, power, and respect that was unknown in the rest of the classical world. Although Spartan women were formally excluded from military and political life they enjoyed considerable status as mothers of Spartan warriors. As men engaged in military activity, women took responsibility for running estates. \nAfter many years of war in the 4th\u00a0century\u00a0BC, Spartan women owned between 35% and 40% of all Spartan land and property. By the Hellenistic period, some of the wealthiest Spartans were women. They controlled their own properties, as well as the properties of male relatives who were away with the army. Unlike Athenian women who wore heavy, concealing clothes and were rarely seen outside the house, Spartan women wore short dresses and went where they pleased. Spartan women rarely married before the age of 20: this was unusual in the ancient world. Girls as well as boys received an education, and young women as well as young men may have joined in the \"Gymnopaedia\" (\"Festival of Nude Youths\").\nPhilosophies.\nSome philosophers were in favour of equality for women, but not Plato and Aristotle. Contrary to them, the Stoic philosophers argued for the equality of the sexes. In their view, sexual inequality was contrary to the laws of nature. In doing so, they followed the Cynics, who argued that men and women should wear the same clothing and get the same kind of education. They also saw marriage as a moral companionship between equals rather than a biological or social necessity. The Cynics practiced these views in their lives as well as in their teachings. The Stoics adopted the views of the Cynics and added them to their own theories of human nature. They put their sexual egalitarianism on a strong footing."}

Before the introduction of the 10% quota (where no more than 10% of the student body may come from one country) different nationalities made up the majority of students at Le Rosey. \nIn the 1950s and 1960s, most students were Americans, Italians, and Greeks. In the 1970s came the Arabs and Iranians. In the 1980s came Japanese and Koreans, and in the 1990s came the Russians. During the 1990s, came the children of Russian oligarchs, who made up a third of the student body. They \"terrorized\" other students, which resulted in the withdrawal of at least one non-Russian student.\nSince then, quotas have been applied.\nMusic.\nThe school has three orchestras and two choirs.\nJanuary to March the school moves to Gstaad. There they do winter sports like skiing every day. For junior boarders it costs CHF 78,300 a year ($85855). It has been called the world's most expensive school. All subjects are taught in English and French. "}

It claims to explain the fact that some animals have characteristics that do not necessarily help them survive. Let's take the peacock for example. The peacock's tail is long and heavy and actually diminishes its chances to survive. So why did it evolutionarily survive? According to the principle, one day, a mutant peahen that likes peacocks with longer tail, looked for a male with this characteristic. The mature male she found was strong enough to survive even though it had a long tail and therefore it is probably stronger than the average peacock. Therefore, its predecessor males are going to be stronger and also to have a long tail while the newborn females are going to like long tails, passing the ideals of the principle to the next generations.\nThis principle comes in addition to the well-known adaptation part of evolution theory claiming that the one who fits best to its environment survives."}

This remnant has around 70% of the Sun's mass and a surface temperature of 17280 K. It is thought to be around 600 million years old. This age includes both its life as a main sequence star, and as a white dwarf stellar remnant. It has an apparent magnitude of 14.8. GD 61 was first noted as a potential degenerate star in 1965. This was done in a survey of white dwarf suspects by astronomers from the Lowell Observatory in Arizona.\nAn asteroid in the system was detected in 2013 that contains water. This was the first finding of solid or liquid water on an extrasolar body. The asteroid, the first extrasolar asteroid detected, is 26% water by mass, close to the water content of Ceres. This means that a planet, with a rocky surface similar to Earth's, may have existed in the past. The asteroid could be an artifact from this period. It is now possibly part of a debris field from that planet's breakup. Such a planet would have had both a rocky surface and water. These are two key ingredients for life. The researchers used the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope to determine what it is made of. The elements magnesium, silicon, iron and oxygen were detected. These are all components of rocky planets. However, the amount of oxygen is much higher than what was expected. There was also less carbon than expected. This meant there was one possible reason for the extra oxygen. There had to be water there."}

It was released in 2013. It is the first in a planned web series, \"Star Trek Continues\". It is a sequel to the original series episode, \"Who Mourns for Adonais?\".\nPlot summary.\nThe crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise are looking into mysterious energy drains from power stations. They find an alien artifact, which begins to draw power from the ship. They destroy the artifact to save themselves, just after Spock (played by Todd Haberkorn) detects two life forms on it. The two forms then materialize on the bridge. one of them is the alien known in Earth's history as the Greek god Apollo (played by Michael Forest). The crew had met him only a couple of years earlier, but he has now aged. He says he was exposed to the energy draining properties of the Realm. This was the destroyed structure. It was built by his race to live in forever. It had malfunctioned and killed all the others of his race. He says he no longer wishes to have people worship him again. After a brief stay in the sick-bay, He starts to want people to idolize him for his singing and storytelling. Captain Kirk (played by Vic Mignogna) demands to speak with him about his behaviors. Apollo uses his telekinetic powers on the captain and others to make them worship him. Meanwhile, the remains of the Realm are still causing difficulties. A crew member dies while he and Sulu (played by Grant Imahara of \"Mythbusters\") are removing debris from the hull of the Enterprise.\nProduction.\nUnlike other Star Trek fan productions, \"Pilgrim\" had a lead crew made up of film industry professionals. The creators attempted to recreate the style of the original series, in its sets, cinematography, costumes, and acting and storytelling style. They duplicated the dramatic pauses as used in the original, prior to commercial breaks. They primarily used the original series' incidental music, as well as the original theme song and iconic credit typography. They filmed in 4:3 aspect ratio to duplicate the original series' TV format.\nActor Michael Forest, in his 80's during filming, was written into the story as having been artificially aged, as he was supposed to have last encountered the crew of the Enterprise only a few years prior, according to the original series timeline.\nOriginal Series licensing rights.\nAs with all such Star Trek fan productions, permission to use copyrighted and trademarked properties from the original series are allowed so long as the production is not-for-profit.\nRelease.\nThe episode was first shown to the public at the Phoenix Comicon comic book convention on May 26, 2013, and was at the same time released onto the internet, on various streaming services.\nSeries.\nFunds for continuation of the series are being raised in part from a Kickstarter campaign, held from Oct 7, 2013 - Nov 6, 2013, which has raised the set goal of $100,000. A second episode in the series, to be directed by Chris White, was in production as of October 2013."}

His theories helped to develop the nuclear strategy of the United States.\nCareer.\nKahn, a man of \"captivating personality and large intellectual gifts\", worked for the RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, California, as a military strategist (19481958). He was a founder of the Hudson Institute think tank. This gives ideas and consultations for the U.S. government and military chiefs, and for business clients.\nHe was known for analyzing the likely consequences of nuclear war and recommending ways to improve survivability. His key idea was that the threat of nuclear war could be controlled by the use of carefully graded deterrence. In order to get his ideas across he ran two-day seminars which included role-playing in various scenarios. His ideas, when published in \"On Thermonuclear War\", caused a sensation.\nHowever, responses must be proportionate, because if one threatened all-out war as a response for some rather modest misbehaviour, then the threat was simply not believable, and would not work. The need to think things through in detail was the topic of his second book, \"Thinking about the Unthinkable\".\nKahn was less successful later in his career when he turned his attention to general economics and politics. His ideas on Japan seemed good at the time, but now seem to be not quite right. He predicted that Japan would become the world's third superstate and a military superpower. This he based on Japan's record after 1946, which was spectacular, with quality production and undercutting markets in the older economies. As it turned out, Japan's economy stalled in the 1980s, and has never recovered its previous growth rate. The role he predicted for Japan is now filled by China, a country with a huge reserve of poorly-paid workers and significant military forces. However, Japan has the second largest economy in the region, and now has good relations with the U.S.A. \nPublications.\nWorks written by Kahn include:"}

For a long time, geothermal energy could only be produced when there were hot rocks, underground water, and cracks in rocks all together in one area. Now, new ways of getting this power source are being created. Areas that can possibly be used for energy need to be altered by people to make the energy usable. These areas may need either underground water and/or cracks, or fracture network, in rocks. Enhanced geothermal systems allow for geothermal energy to be outside normal geothermal areas like active plate boundaries to less active areas like the western United States.\nGreen Energy.\nOld Well Recycling.\nGeothermal systems can also be enhanced by recycling old oil and gas wells for geothermal use. It is cheaper to change these wells for heat mining than to drill new holes. These wells do not allow for physical contact between the water and the heat source. These wells are made out of two cylinders: a bigger one and a smaller one. The smaller one fits inside the bigger one and is where the heated water is pumped out from. Water in inserted between the lining of the inner pipe and the outer one. Due to the lack in direct contact with the hot rocks as well as some heat loss from lack of a good insulating material, the energy output is not as high as in ordinary geothermal systems.\nGreen House Gas Emissions.\nSome say that this form of energy is one of the \u201cgreenest\u201d alternative energies out there. Studies that say two of the three ways of geothermal energy production is flash-steam and dry-steam give off less than 7% of the green house gasses that fossil fuels give off. The third method, known as a closed binary-cycle system, gives off nearly zero green house gasses.) The most emission heavy part of EGS is when the drills are powered by diesel fuel. Research on EGS Life Cycle Analysis has shown that a good correction for this would be to hook the drill up to the power grid decreasing the already minimal impact GEP power plants has on human health, climate change, and ecosystem quality. Supporters also claim that because geothermal energy systems don\u2019t rely on the changing weather, it is a more reliable energy with a constant energy output.\nUS involvement.\nThe US has the largest potential geothermal energy reserve in the world yet only 4% of its total energy usage (15 billion kWh) is from GEP. California has the highest number of geothermal heat pumps out of a total of the nine states that use geothermal energy. Hawaii gets 20% of its power from geothermal power plants. Knowledge about geothermal energy is not well known. This makes getting money for research and development very hard. Developers have also been known to have trouble getting permits to drill on public land and get funding from both the federal government and outside interests. There are, however, two projects that were approved by the Senate to help get EGS out of the pilot stage.\nIn 1990, legislation took to creating incentives to develop the industry. It was attempted with the Energy Act of 2005 and Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 with issued tax credits and the creation of Senate supported research and development programs."}

Although his father was pagan Wulfhere was a Christian. His older brother Peada ruled Mercia south of the River Thames under Oswiu of Northumbria. When Peada was murdered Oswiu held Mercia until the ealdormen of Mercia rebelled and placed Wulfhere on the throne. Wulfhere ruled Mercia from 658 until his death. He was the first Mercian (overlord) of England. \nKing of Mercia.\nWulfhere was a younger son of King Penda. His older brother Peada accepted Christianity to marry the daughter of King Oswiu of Northumbria. After their father was killed by Oswiu, Peada was set up as a king of southern Mercia. Peada's wife murdered him within five months. Oswiu then took control of all Mercia and ruled it three years. The Mercian ealdormen Immin, Eafa and Eadbert rose up in rebellion against king Oswiu. Wulfhere, who had been kept hidden, was then proclaimed king. Wulfhere had little opposition from Oswiu as he was dealing with a rebellion in Northumbria. Wulfhere began building alliances with other kings in the south of England. His first may have been in about 660 when he married Ermenilda, the daughter of King Eorcenberht of Kent and his wife Seaxburh. About this same time he expanded Mercia to the west. He brought Shropshire and Herfordshire under his control. The kings of Essex submitted to his rule by 665.\nBretwalda.\nBy the time Oswiu died in 670 Wulfhere was the overlord of most of southern England. He installed Bishop Wine in London after he was expelled from Wessex by king Cenwalh. While Wulfhere did not directly control East Anglia he controlled Lindsey and Essex. By controlling all the surrounding lands, he probably forced East Anglia into a treaty. Wulfhere then made Athelwalh recognize his overlordship in Sussex. He expelled the West Saxons from Sussex and eastern Hampshire. Expanding to the east he made his Frithuwold King of Surrey in 670. When King Ecgberht of Kent died in 673 Wulfhere became the guardian of his two sons Eadric and Wihtred. He then ruled Kent through them. With Wulfhere's support, Theodore, the Archbishop of Canterbury presided over the Synod of Hertford in 673. In 674 Wulfhere decided to attack Northumbria. Oswiu's son Ecgfrith of Northumbria had put down a rebellion by the Picts when he became king. Wulfhere formed an alliance of most of the southern kings with the exception of Wessex. The southern alliance under Wulfhere was defeated by Ecgfrith in battle. While Wulfhere survived he was forced to pay to Ecgfrith. He soon lost his authority in Kent. Possibly in revenge for not joining him in fighting Northumbria, Wulfhere attacked Wessex. He was defeated by King Aescwine of Wessex in 674. Wulfhere died in early 675.

It is also known as the Battle of Brooklyn or the Battle of Brooklyn Heights. The battle which was fought on August 27, 1776, was a major victory for the British and defeat for the Americans under General George Washington. It was the start of a successful British campaign that gave the British control of the strategically important city of New York. In the American Revolutionary War it was the first major battle to take place after the United States declared independence in July, 1776. In terms of soldiers, it was the largest battle of the entire conflict.\nGeneral George Washington, Commander-in-Chief had defeated the British in the Siege of Boston on March 17, 1776. Washington then used the Continental Army to defend the port city of New York. At that time, New York City was only at the southern end of Manhattan Island. Washington understood that the city's harbor would provide an excellent base for the British Navy during the campaign. For this reason, he established defenses there and waited for the British to attack.\nThe British were commanded by General William Howe. In July his force landed a few miles across the harbor on sparsely-populated Staten Island. Over the next few months, new ships slowly reinforced their position in Lower New York Harbor. In August there were 32,000 soldiers, and the British controlled the entrance of the harbor at The Narrows. Washington knew that it would be difficult to hold the city against such a force. He believed Manhattan would be the first target and he moved most of his forces there.\nOn August 22, the British landed on the shores of Gravesend Bay in southwest Kings County, across The Narrows from Staten Island, more than 12\u00a0miles (20\u00a0km) south from the East River crossings to Manhattan. Washington brought some of his troops to northern Kings County, expecting to fight only part of the attacking army.\nAfter five days of waiting, the British attacked American defenses. Unknown to the Americans, however, Howe had brought his main army around their rear and attacked their flank soon after. The Americans panicked, although a stand by 400 Maryland troops prevented most of the army from being captured. The remainder of the army fled to the main defenses on Brooklyn Heights. The British dug in for a siege but, on the night of August 29\u201330, Washington evacuated the entire army to Manhattan without the loss of materiel or a single life. Washington and the Continental Army were driven out of New York entirely after the battle of Fort Washington and other defeats, and forced to retreat through New Jersey and into Pennsylvania."}

It reached number 3 in the UK Singles Chart. They were less popular in the United States, but their 1991 single \"Kiss Them For Me\" reached 23 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. They were also the second headliners for the first Lollapalooza.\nThe group played their first concert at the 100 Club Punk Festival. Sid Vicious played drums. Marco Pirroni played guitar. Without practising beforehand, they did a twenty-minute improvised version of the Lord's Prayer. The band had no name and was going to break up after the concert, but they were asked to play again.\nTwo months later Kenny Morris joined as a drummer and Peter Fenton as a guitarist. After a few performances, the band realized that Fenton didn't fit in and John McKay took his place.\nIn 1978, the band were signed to Polydor Records. They released their first single \"Hong Kong Garden\". It reached 7 on the UK Singles Chart. They released their first album, \"The Scream\", in November. It reached number 12 in the UK Albums Chart. It got mostly good reviews. \"Sounds\" said it was \"the best debut album of the year\".\nRobert Smith was guitarist in the band's 1979 tour for \"Join Hands\". He joined the group again in 1982 to replace John McGeoch. He left in 1984 because he said that being in two bands at once was too much stress. He was replaced by John \"Valentine\" Carruthers. Before he left he wanted his time with the band to be documented, so the band released a cover of the Beatles' \"Dear Prudence\" with Smith on guitar.\nPeter Edward Clark, known as Budgie, also joined the band for the \"Join Hands\" tour. He stayed a member until the band broke up. In 1987 Carruthers left and was replaced with Jon Klein. Martin McCarrick became the band's full-time keyboard player.\nIn 1987, the band released \"Through the Looking Glass\", an album of covers of songs by other musicians.\nBetween January and June 1988, the band recorded their ninth album, \"Peepshow\". It was released on 5 September 1988. It had a more pop sound than their previous albums. It got very good reviews. \"Q\" gave it 5 stars.\nIn 1991, \"Superstition\", the Banshees' tenth album, was released. The single \"Kiss Them for Me\" became their biggest US hit.\nIn 1995, they released their last album, \"The Rapture\". A few weeks later, Polydor dropped them from their label. Guitarist Klein was replaced with Knox Chandler for the band's last tour."}

It is caring, through thoughts or actions, more about your own needs than the needs and well-being of other people. It may be accompanied by a lack of empathy. Selfishness is the opposite of selflessness. It is also different, though related, to self-centredness and self-affirmation. Many psychologists approve of a healthy level of selfishness, in order for some people to stay happy.\nIn the study of ethics and morality, selfishness is usually considered bad. In contrast, acts of selflessness are praised. Wider debate about it, however, such as in philosophy, psychology and economics, has shown that scholars have had many different opinions about its value and consequences. In most major religions, selfishness is considered an immoral or bad habit. In Christianity, it is associated with pride, often considered the worst of the Seven deadly sins. Aristotle condemned men who would only try to profit themselves; but he approved of those who would try to gain the praise from others that he deserved.\nIn the context of modern-day economics, there is a much wider opinion. Bernard Mandeville has argued that the economic advancement of society depends on selfish actions. Ayn Rand argued that selfishness is a virtue and the cause of all progress."}

Bretwalda, his son, was the first Mercian overlord of the southern English. Offa (757\u2013796), was the first of the Anglo-Saxon kings who might rightly be called \"king of the English\".

It was best known for the doctrine of nuclear deterrence by mutually assured destruction (MAD), based upon their work with game theory. Chief strategist Herman Kahn discussed the idea of a \"winnable\" nuclear exchange in his 1960 book \"On Thermonuclear War\". This led to Kahn being one of the models for \"Dr Strangelove\" in \"\".

RAND techniques were based on operations research (O.R.) which started in World War II. O.R. is the interdisciplinary application of scientific thinking to problem-solving. It relies mostly on the hard sciences like physics and mathematics, and economics. However, some famous biologists and social scientists have worked with RAND at times, and the importance of social ideas and thinking is more important than ever today.\nRAND has about 1,700 employees and three principal North American locations: Santa Monica, California (headquarters); Arlington, Virginia; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The RAND Gulf States Policy Institute has offices in New Orleans, Louisiana, and Jackson, Mississippi. RAND Europe is located in Cambridge, England, and Brussels, Belgium. The RAND-Qatar Policy Institute is in Doha, Qatar. RAND's newest office is in Boston, Massachusetts.\nRAND is also home to the Pardee RAND School, which is the world's largest Ph.D.-granting program in policy analysis. Unlike many other universities, all PARDEE RAND Graduate School students receive fellowships in order to cover their education costs. RAND also offers a number of internship and fellowship programs allowing students and outsiders to assist in conducting research for RAND projects. Most of these projects are short-term and are worked on independently with the mentoring of a RAND staff members.\nRAND publishes the \"RAND Journal of Economics\", a peer-reviewed journal of economics.\nTo date, 32 winners of a Nobel Prize, mainly in economics and physics, have been associated with the RAND at some point in their career."}

The sculpture was on loan to the Brooklyn Museum of Art until it was purchased at auction by an English collector.\nThe limestone sculpture is just over 8\u00a0cm (3.25\u00a0in) tall. It was described by Sotheby's as \"one of the last known masterworks from the dawn of civilization remaining in private hands\". One day before the auction, experts had been estimating that the highest bid would be between $14 million and $18 million.\nAt the time of its 2007 sale, the price paid at auction for the Guennol Lioness was the highest paid for a sculpture to that date. It easily exceeded the record of Pablo Picasso's \"Tete de femme (Dora Maar)\".

Its historical significance is that it was made about the same time as the first known use of the wheel, the development of cuneiform writing, and the emergence of the first cities.\nMany ancient Near East deities were represented as anthropomorphic figures. Such images evoked the Mesopotamian belief in attaining power over the physical world by combining the superior physical attributes of various species. It is possible that the nearby Sumerians borrowed this powerful artistic hybrid from the Proto-Elamites. The lioness was the frequent subject of veneration among cultures familiar with the well-coordinated hunting of female lions."}

He succeeded his brother Wulfhere when he died in 675. Like his brother, Wulfhere, he was considered an overlord over other English kings. But he never reached the same political status as Wulfhere. His importance was in his contributions to the church. Aethelred ruled Mercia until his in 704. He stepped down to retire to the monastery at Bardney.\nKing of Mercia.\nAethelred was a son of King Penda. At about the same time he succeeded his brother to the throne he married Osthryth, daughter of Oswiu of Northumbria. Aethelred attacked Kent in 676 to get Hlothhere of Kent back in line as a vassal of Mercia. He destroyed much of that kingdom as well as sacked Rochester. In 679 Aethelred continued the struggle his father and brother had with Northumbria. He found Ecgfrith of Northumbria waiting for him on the River Trent which divided north and south Mercia. In the battle, Aelfwine, the younger brother of King Ecgfrith was killed and the Northumbrians were defeated. To prevent a blood feud between the two royal families, Theodore, the Archbishop of Canterbury stepped in to prevent further bloodshed. He secured a truce between Northumbria and Mercia that lasted for 50 years. For the rest of his reign Aethelred was respected as overlord of England even though Bede never listed him among the seven .\nAethelred was very involved in the church. He and his wife Osthryth founded Bardney abbey in Lindsey. Queen Osthryth had the bones of her uncle, Oswald of Northumbria, brought to Bardney to be buried there. This caused some resentment by the monks who at first refused to accept his bones. But they were accepted and buried in the church with all the honors due a saint. Aethelred was a close friend of Wilfrid of York. In 691 Aethelred gave the bishop sanctuary in Mercia after his exile from Northumbria. While welcomed by Aethelred he was not by Queen Osthryth. Wilfred was an old enemy of her brother king Ecgfrith of Northumbria. But Ostryth was not completely accepted in Mercia. She created the cult of Saint Oswald in Mercia which did little to help Mercians forget old feuds with Northumbria. In 697, Queen Osthryth was murdered by Mercian noblemen. She was suspected of having some part in the murder of Peada forty years earlier. By this time she had become a nun and had given up married life. In 704 Aethelred stepped down as king to become a monk. His nephew Cenred became King after him. Aethelred retired to the monastery of Bardney where his wife Osthryth had been buried. He became the abbot of Bardney although he remained aware of Mercian politics. Two years after giving up the throne he called his nephew, King Cenred, to Bardsley to ask him to remain on good terms with his old friend Bishop Wilfrid.

Once they got into the walls, the Roman soldiers burned and ransacked the city also destroying the Second Temple. The final stronghold at Masada was taken in 73 AD and when the Roman soldiers broke through the defences, they discovered all the defenders had committed suicide. As a result, most of the Jews in the area were scattered or sold into slavery. The final death toll, according to Josephus who was often wrong about numbers, was over one million."}

He brought Mercia back to a position of power not seen since the days of Penda and Wulfhere. Because of his authority and his use of the title \"king of the \"gens Anglorum\"\" his people began calling themselves English instead of Saxons, Jutes or Angles. But Aethelbald was not a supporter of the Church. He claimed to be Christian but he led a scandalous and wicked lifestyle. \nKing of Mercia.\nAethelbald the son of Alweo and the grandson of Penda's brother Eowa. As an and possible competitor for the throne, he was forced to leave Mercia by his cousin Ceolred. Aethelbald found refuge with his kinsman, (Saint) Guthlac of Crowland. St. Guthlac died in 714 but predicted Aethelbald would be king of Mercia. Two years later at the death of Ceolred, Aethelbald became king. One of his first acts was to begin construction of Crowland Abbey which he promised to build for Guthlac if his prediction came true. At the start of his reign Aethelbald found himself dealing with two strong kings on his borders. Ine of Wessex and Wihtred of Kent had influence in southern England. Aethelbald had influence with other southern kings. Wihtred died in 725 and Ine abdicated his throne in 726. He supported Athelheard of Wessex to become king in 726. \nBretwalda.\nAethelbald began taking over parts of Wessex. He obtained Berkshire in 730. Three years later he took Somerton from Wessex. Aethelbald was able to give the Archbishop of Canterbury a gift of the monastery of Cookham in Berkshire (Wessex). By 731 as Bede was finishing his \"Ecclesiastical History\", Aethelbald was overlord of all the English kingdoms south of the River Humber. In 740 Aethelbald burned York and destroyed much of Northumbria. The same year Athelheard of Wessex died and was replaced on the throne by Cuthred. Cuthred made it known he was not as weak a ruler as Athelheard and struggled against Aethelbald being his overlord. In the first three years of Cuthred's rule he warred with Mercia but made few gains. In 743 Cuthred joined Aethelbald in fighting the Welsh. In 748 Cuthred's son, Cynric, tried to his father and died in the rebellion. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the rebellion was encouraged by Aethelbald. In 752, Cuthred tried to break free of King Aethelbald. This led to a battle at Burford where Cuthred battled against Aethelbald. The battle ended up with Aethelbald fleeing the battlefield. From that time on Cuthred maintained independence from Mercia for the rest of his reign.\nAethelbald and the Church.\nHe influenced the selections of three succeeding Archbishops of Canterbury (in Kent). These were Tatwine in 731, Nothhelm in 734 and Cuthbert in 740. \nMercia was by this time a very wealthy kingdom and Aethelbald himself was very rich. He apparently used church funds for his own purposes. He forced monks to work on his building projects. Aethelbald not only forced himself on nuns but he promoted the same wicked behavior among monks. Saint Boniface complained to King Aethelbald of his evil ways in a letter dated . He pointed out Aethelbald had not taken a lawful wife nor had he observed chastity. He said the king had ruined his good name before men. Finally that the crimes Aethelbald had committed in convents with nuns and virgins doubled his offense. He warned the king to change his ways before he met a terrible death. This had no effect on Aethelbald. He grew impatient with and interfered with their privileges. Only in his later years did he develop a less high-handed way of dealing with the Church. \nIn 757 Aethelbald was murdered at night by one of his own . The throne was by Beornred temporarily until Offa came to power the same year Aethelbald died. Aethelbald maintained his overlordship of all the south English kingdoms for longer than any other . He did this partially by force; Aethelbald was a great war leader. He did this partly through his great wealth through tributes paid to him by other kings. He could afford a large labor force as well as a large army. He also attempted to use the great wealth of the Church to his own advantage. But he also gave grants to the church for building monasteries. He attended great church councils that would not have taken place without his support.

Langston to win the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship but lost the Tag Team Championship to Brad Maddox and Briley Pierce on November 3.\nHe debuted on the December 15, 2011 episode of Superstars as the enforcer of Hunico and went under the ring name Camacho. The two teamed together on the April 26 episode of Superstars and defeated The Usos. He made his pay-per-view debut at Over The Limit but was defeated in singles competition against Ryback.\nAfter that, he was sent back down to the developmental territory, the former FCW, which was rebranded into NXT Wrestling. He debuted on NXT in a losing effort against Seth Rollins. He won a match later on the same episode in a six-man tag match when he teamed with Hunico and Michael McGillicutty against Rollins, Bo Dallas and Tyson Kidd. He defeated Kidd in a singles match following a distraction from McGillicutty on the following episode of NXT.\nHe competed in the pre-show of Money in the Bank when he teamed with Hunico in a losing effort against the WWE Tag Team Champions Kofi Kingston and R-Truth in a non-title match. He made an appearance on the 1,000th episode of Raw with Hunico, Jinder Mahal, Curt Hawkins, Tyler Reks and Drew McIntyre when they tried to ambush Kane in the ring to make a statement but The Undertaker's return resulted in the Brothers of Destruction disposing of all six would-be attackers.\nWhen Hunico got injured, Camacho went back to NXT and attempted to collect a $5,000 bounty that was promised to anybody that could put Big E Langston \"on the shelf\". Camacho wanted to claim the bounty so he could \"get Hunico out of Mexico\" but lost to Langston. Camacho reunited with Hunico at the Wrestlemania Axxess live event but he has not been on television since May. He teamed with Hunico to challenge for the NXT Tag Team Championship but were unsuccessful in winning the titles.\nOn the November 6th episode of WWE Main Event, he once again teamed with Hunico and they made their first televised tag team match since July 2012 against the Usos but lost.\nOn June 12, 2014, Camacho was released from his WWE contract."}

All the same, it does strangely make a kind of sense.\nIn an early scene of Alice in Wonderland, Alice finds the verse \"Jabberwocky\". She says (p24)\n\"Somehow it seems to fill my head with ideasonly I don't exactly know what they are.\u201d\nThis is now thought to be one of the greatest nonsense poems written in English. Its playful, whimsical language has given us nonsense words, portmanteau words and neologisms such as \"galumphing\" and \"chortle\".\nOrigin and publication.\nThe concept of nonsense verse was not original to Carroll. Nonsense existed in Shakespeare's work and was well known in the Brothers Grimm's fairytales, some of which are called lying tales or \"l\u00fcgenm\u00e4rchen\". \nJohn Tenniel reluctantly agreed to illustrate the book in 1871, and his illustrations are still the defining images of the poem.\nThe illustration of the Jabberwock may reflect the Victorian obsession with natural history and the fast-evolving sciences of palaeontology and geology. The works of Darwin and the models of dinosaurs at the Crystal Palace Exhibition helped feed the interest. Perhaps it is not so surprising that Tenniel gave the Jabberwock \"the leathery wings of a pterodactyl and the long rough neck and tail of a sauropod\".\nThe poem.\nJabberwocky\n'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\nDid gyre and gimble in the wabe;\nAll mimsy were the borogoves,\nAnd the mome raths outgrabe.\n\"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!\nThe jaws that bite, the claws that catch!\nBeware the Jubjub bird, and shun\nThe frumious Bandersnatch!\"\nHe took his vorpal sword in hand:\nLong time the Manxome foe he sought\u2014\nSo rested he by the Tumtum tree,\nAnd stood awhile in thought.\nAnd as in uffish thought he stood,\nThe Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,\nCame whiffling through the tulgey wood,\nAnd burbled as it came!\nOne, two! One, two! and through and through\nThe vorpal blade went snicker-snack!\nHe left it dead, and with its head\nHe went galumphing back.\n\"And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?\nCome to my arms, my beamish boy!\nO frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!\"\nHe chortled in his joy.\n'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\nDid gyre and gimble in the wabe;\nAll mimsy were the borogoves,\nAnd the mome raths outgrabe.\nMany of the words in the poem are playful words of Carroll's own invention, without special meaning. When Alice has finished reading the poem she gives her impressions: \n'It seems very pretty,' she said when she had finished it, 'but it's rather hard to understand!' (You see she didn't like to confess, even to herself, that she couldn't make it out at all.) 'Somehow it seems to fill my head with ideas\u2014only I don't exactly know what they are! However, somebody killed something: that's clear, at any rate'\nIn \"Through the Looking Glass\", the character of Humpty Dumpty explains to her the nonsense words from the first stanza of the poem. However, Carroll's personal commentary on several of the words differ from Humpty's. An analysis of the poem and Carroll's commentary is given in the book \"The Annotated Alice\" by Martin Gardner."}

Once the promise was made, they were given more money. The amount of money they were given changed over the years. In 1812, a new soldier was given \u00a323, 17 shillings and six pence. This money was a lot, which persuaded many people to join the army, but the money was spent very quickly on uniform. Because this money was a lot, some people joined and deserted lots of times to get the money each time. One man was hanged in 1787 for doing this 47 times."}

{"id": "424116", "revid": "24306", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=424116", "title": "Thomas Wyatt", "text": "Sir Thomas Wyatt (1503\u20131542) was an English poet and diplomat. He gets credit for bringing the into the English language. A sonnet is a special type of poem with 14 lines. He was \"the Renaissance ideal\u2014soldier, statesman, courtier, lover, scholar, and poet.\u201d\nEarly life.\nWyatt was born at Allington near Maidstone, Kent, England in 1503. His father was Henry Wyatt and his mother was named Ann Skinner. Henry Wyatt was loyal to King Henry VII of England. This allowed Henry to have many high-ranking positions in the King's court. Thomas Wyatt went to St John's College, Cambridge, from 1515 to 1522. He was twelve when he first entered the college. At age 17 in 1520, Wyatt married Elizabeth Brooke. His wife was the daughter of Lord Cobham. They had two children, Thomas and Bess. However, the marriage was unhappy. Wyatt once wrote a letter to his son that put blame in both parents for the bad marriage, \"but chiefly [mostly] in her.\" Both Thomas Wyatt and his wife Elizabeth cheated on each other. After his wife had two children, the couple was separated.\nPolitical career.\nWyatt got his first position at court in 1516. In this year he was \"sewer extraordinary,\" an attendant or page at the christening of Princess Mary. He was probably able to get this position so young because his father Henry had such a good reputation with the King. In 1524, Wyatt was named keeper of the King's jewels. In these early years at court, Wyatt met Anne Boleyn. Many thought they were lovers at this time, but there is no proof. In 1526, Wyatt began his career as a diplomat. Wyatt was sent to Paris, France with Sir Thomas Cheney. Cheney was one of the many people who liked Wyatt. In a letter, Cheney said Wyatt had \"as much wit...as any young man hath in England.\"\nA year later, Wyatt was sent to the Vatican in Rome and Venice, Italy with Sir John Russell. It was probably during these trips that Wyatt became interested in French and Italian poetry. While Wyatt was in Venice, he was taken prisoner by Spanish troops. They wanted England to pay 3,000 ducats to set him free. Today that is close to 300,000 USD. Wyatt escaped before the money was paid.\nFrom 1528 to 1530, Wyatt was High Marshal of the town of Calais. During these years, Wyatt continued to have interest in French and Italian poetry. Two important poets he read were Petrarch and Ludovico Ariosto. From 1530 to 1536, King Henry VIII sent him on many shorter diplomatic missions. In 1533, Wyatt represented his father in a position called \"chief sewer\" at Anne Boleyn's (when she was made queen).\nIn May of 1534, Wyatt was imprisoned in Fleet Prison for killing one of the guard in London in a fight. This was a minor offense, so he was released quickly. But in 1536, Anne Boleyn was arrested and beheaded. She had been accused of having other lovers while married to King Henry. Around this time, Wyatt was also arrested and locked up in the Tower of London. No reason was given for Wyatt's arrest, but there were rumors that it had something to do with Anne Boleyn. It is still unclear today whether Anne Boleyn and Thomas Wyatt ever had an affair. Some of Wyatt's poems make this seem true. Nicholas Sanders, a Catholic poet, thought that Wyatt told King Henry VIII not to marry her because she was impure. He thought that Wyatt told the King about their affair to convince the King not to marry Anne. Sanders said that Wyatt was released because he had tried to warn the King that Anne would be a bad wife. Wyatt's grandson, George Wyatt, disagreed. George Wyatt said that his grandfather never had an affair with Boleyn because she rejected him. Whether or not Wyatt had a relationship with Boleyn, he was released from prison after a month. He was soon given several promotions. The promotions show that either the King forgave Wyatt or that he wasn't very mad at Wyatt in the first place. Soon, Wyatt became the Sheriff of Kent.\nIn 1537, Wyatt became a knight. He also began an affair with Elizabeth Darell, who had a son. Afterwards, he was sent to Spain to live in an embassy. His mission in Spain was to improve the relationship between the Holy Roman Emperor, Emperor Charles V, and King Henry VIII of England. Emperor Charles V was unhappy with the King of England because he divorced the Emperor's aunt, Catherine of Aragon. This was especially bad because the King had originally asked the Pope for special permission to marry Catherine, who was the widow of the King's older brother Arthur. The embassy was a disaster. Sir Thomas Wyatt and the other ambassadors, Edmund Bonner and Simon Heynes, were all unsuccessful. Also, Bonner disliked Wyatt. Bonner accused Wyatt of treason (and of liking papists, or Catholics). These accusations were cleared by Thomas Cromwell. Cromwell was the chief minister to Henry VIII and often protected Wyatt.\nIn May 1539, Wyatt returned to London. In 1540, Cromwell was arrested and beheaded. Without Cromwell's protection, Bonner got Wyatt arrested for treason. King Henry VIII, who liked Wyatt, released him with a condition: Wyatt had to leave Darell and return to his wife. Even though Wyatt was forced to separate from Darell in 1541, she and their son were still in Wyatt's will when he died.\nAfter Wyatt again had the King's favor, he was sent on more missions to France and Flanders. In 1542, he was elected a member of Parliament from Kent. On the 3rd of October of the same year, Wyatt was sent to take an ambassador from Spain from Dorset to London. He rode for days with the ambassador but then Wyatt got sick from the journey. He fought a fever for three days and then died at Sherborne, Dorset. On October 11, 1542 he was laid to rest in the Horsely family vault in the church at Sherborne. Some poets wrote elegies (poems of mourning) for Wyatt. One of the most famous was by Wyatt's friend Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey. He wrote: \"Wyatt resteth here, that quick could never rest.\" Surrey also thought that Wyatt \"reft Chaucer the glory of his wit\" (i.e. he stole Chaucer's title as the wittiest writer).\nLiterary works.\nWyatt wrote in many forms. These forms include sonnets, songs, lyric poems, and rondeaux. A rondeau is a strict poem with 13 lines and two rhymes. It also involves a repeat of the beginning of the first line. The repeat usually comes at lines 8 and 13. Sonnets are poems with 14 lines. Today we usually divide sonnets into English or Shakespearean sonnets and Italian or Petrarchan sonnets. Petrarchan sonnets are named for the Italian poet Petrarch. Petrarchan sonnets are grouped into an octave (a set of 8 lines) and a sestet (a set of 6 lines). It has the rhyme pattern abba abba cddece. Wyatt translated many of Petrarch's poems into English. Wyatt was the first to use the form we now call the Shakespearean sonnet. It is a poem of 14 lines grouped into three quatrains (a set of four lines) and a couplet (a set of two lines). It has the rhyme pattern abab cdcd efef gg. William Shakespeare came after Wyatt, but he often used the type of sonnet Wyatt invented. In fact, Shakespeare used it so often that the sonnet form was named after Shakespeare instead of Wyatt.\nWyatt's songs, sonnets, lyric poems and rondeaux were usually about love. Few of his works were published while he was alive. Those that were published during his lifetime were usually published without his name attached. 96 of Wyatt's songs were published with Surrey's work in \"Songes and Sonettes, Written by the Ryght Honorable Lorde Henry Haward Late Earle of Surrey, and Other.\" This volume was published in 1557 by Richard Tottel. It is now more commonly called \"Tottel's Miscellany.\" He wrote other songs that were found in other manuscripts. The main theme of his 200 songs was how he was treated badly by his mistress. Wyatt writes about both sexual and political betrayal, and sometimes mixes the two. Wyatt wrote 31 sonnets. Ten of his sonnets were translations from Petrarch.\nWyatt also wrote three satires and a series of 7 penitential psalms. Both his psalms and his satires were in \"terza rima.\" Wyatt was the first to use \"terza rima\" in English. This form is where you have sets of three lines that rhyme in the following pattern: aba bcb cdc and on. He also brought \"ottava rima\" to English. \"Ottava rima\" is a set of eight lines with the rhyme pattern abababcc. For bringing so many different forms to English poetry, Wyatt was called \"one of two chief lanterns of light\" to future English poets by George Puttenham in 1598. The other lantern was the Earl of Surrey.\nWyatt's work was read less during the 17th Century, but was picked up again in the 18th and 19th Centuries. During this time, \"Tottel\u2019s Miscellany\" was seen as a marker for the beginning of \"Italianized\" English poetry. But readers from the 18th and 19th Centuries did not think Wyatt's work was as good as Shakespeare's or Sidney's, who came after him. Also, 18th and 19th century readers liked Surrey's poetry better than Wyatt's poetry. This was true even after they discovered that Wyatt's poetry came first. In his History of English Poetry (1781), Thomas Warton wrote that Wyatt \"is confessedly inferior to Surrey... He has too much art as a lover, and too little as a poet.\u2019\u2019 This view changed in the 20th century between the two World Wars. Today, many scholars think Wyatt was the better poet."}

It is a non-profit, non-governmental organization. It analyses and promote the understanding of major international issues and current affairs. \nChatham House is one of the world's leading organizations in this area. It takes its name from its premises, a Grade I listed 18th-century house in St. James's Square, once occupied by three British prime ministers, including William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham.\nIn a recent report, Chatham House is ranked the second most influential think tank in the world after the Brookings Institution, and the world's most influential non-US think tank. In 2009, Chatham House was also named the top non-US think tank by \"Foreign Policy\" magazine.\nChatham House has had distinguished presidents from each of the three main political parties at Westminster: Sir John Major, former UK Prime Minister, Lord Ashdown (1941-2018), former EU Special Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina and former leader of the Liberal Democrats, and Baroness Scotland, the former Attorney General.\nHistory.\nThe think tank was founded in 1920 as the British Institute of International Affairs. The first chairman was Robert Cecil, a leading conservative politician. Historian Arnold Toynbee later became director. The Council on Foreign Relations, its American sister institute, was established the following year. \nChatham House's headquarters at 10 St. James's Square, London, was donated to the institute in 1923. It had been the house of three British Prime Ministers - Pitt the Elder, Edward Stanley and William Ewart Gladstone.\nIn 1926, now with its royal charter, the name was changed to the Royal Institute of International Affairs. However, it is usually referred to as \"Chatham House\".\nIt is just a few metres from the former Libyan embassy building where the 1984 Libyan Embassy Siege took place.\nThe BBC Today/Chatham House lecture series promotes debate and discussion on key international issues of the day. At the inaugural lecture in 2006, Condoleezza Rice defended the U.S. decision to go to war with Iraq.\nRole.\nWith its members, Chatham House aims to promote debate on significant developments in international affairs and policy responses. Their independent research and analysis on global, regional and country-specific challenges is intended to offer new ideas to decision makers on how these could best be tackled from the near to the long term.\nChatham House is routinely used as a source of information for media organizations seeking background or experts upon matters involving major international issues.\nIt has been alleged that Chatham House reflects a pro-establishment view of the world. It does have donations from large corporations, governments and other organizations, but Chatham House is membership-based and anyone may join. Chatham House currently has international leaders from business, diplomacy, science, politics and media as its individual members.\nChatham House Rule.\nChatham House is the origin of the anonymity rule known as the Chatham House Rule. Guests attending a seminar may discuss the results of the seminar in the outside world, but may not discuss who attended or what any person said. The Chatham House Rule helps frank and honest discussion on controversial or unpopular issues by speakers. Despite this, most meetings at Chatham House are actually held on the record, and not under the Chatham House Rule."}

They have lasted over 40 years, and still perform to this day.\nName.\nThe name of the band was dreamt up by the band's founder Adge Cutler. It appears to be short for mangelwurzel, a type of beetroot grown to feed livestock.\nThe Wurzels' particular genre of music was called Scrumpy and Western after the group's first EP of the same name, issued early in 1967. Scrumpy is slang for the potent cider made in southwest England, popular amongst The Wurzels and their fans, and often referred to in their songs.\nHistory.\nAdge Cutler and The Wurzels.\nThe Wurzels were formed in 1966 as a backing group for singer/songwriter Adge Cutler. With a thick Somerset accent, Adge played on his West Country roots, singing many folk songs with local themes such as cider making (and drinking), farming, dung-spreading, local villages and industrial work songs, often with a comic slant.\nDuring the latter half of the 1960s, the band became immensely popular regionally, and the release of the single \"Drink Up Thy Zider\" in 1966 led to national fame and it reaching number 45 in the UK chart. The B-side \"Twice Daily\" was banned by the BBC for being too raunchy. A number of live albums were recorded at local pubs and clubs.\nAdge Cutler died after falling asleep at the wheel of his MG sports car which overturned on a roundabout approaching the Severn Bridge. He was returning alone from a Wurzels show in Hereford in May 1974. He is buried in Nailsea.\nThe Wurzels.\nAdge's death marked a turning point in the history of the Wurzels. Deprived of the main song-writing talent, the remaining Wurzels recorded \"The Wurzels Are Scrumptious!\" in 1975, an album containing many favourites from the back catalogue, including a number of previously unrecorded Cutler-written songs. In order to continue the surviving band needed its own songs, and these mostly took the formula of re-written popular pop songs of the time with the lyrics changed to include the usual Wurzel themes (cider, farming, local villages, Cheddar cheese, etc.)\nIn 1976, the Wurzels released \"The Combine Harvester\", a re-work of the song \"Brand New Key\", by Melanie, which became a UK hit, topping the charts for 2 weeks. The band quickly followed its success with \"I Am A Cider Drinker\" (a rework of the \"Una Paloma Blanca\" melody), which got to number three in the charts, and \"Farmer Bill's Cowman\" (a reworking of the Whistling Jack Smith instrumental \"I Was Kaiser Bill's Batman\").\nThe Wurzels have never stopped performing. The group signed to Cumbria record label Loose Records &amp; Music, and recorded four new new songs including the single \"I Wanna Be An Eddie Stobart Driver\" (released as a limited edition lorry-shaped disc).\nThe late 1990s saw the fortunes of the surviving Wurzels revive, gaining cult status among students and a resurgence in their native West Country. Under the new management of The Stranglers manager Sil Willcox a number of CD releases followed, largely featuring re-recordings of older works. \"Never Mind The Bullocks, Ere's The Wurzels\" had covers of British rock songs. The album title and cover were a spoof on \"Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols\".\nTheir latest album is \"A Load More Bullocks\" (2010) for the CIA label."}

The team ended when a real life incident occurred in November 2002 with Tanahashi being stabbed in the back by Hitomi Hara (a TV Asahi news reporter that he had dated for a brief amount of time). He was hospitalized, but recovered.\nHe returned to in-ring competition this time as a singles wrestler on February 16, 2003 in a match against Manabu Nakanishi in front of a sold-out Tokyo crowd.\nOn January 4, 2014, Tanahashi was able to defeat Shinsuke Nakamura in the main event of Wrestle Kingdom 8 in Tokyo Dome to win the IWGP Intercontinental Championship.

Hearing is a biological process that can be scientifically explained, but listening is a psychological process of what happens to sounds as we interpret and use them. It is a cognitive activity.\nIn psychology, speech is part of pragmatics, a field which deals with signs and their interpretation. The signs in question are called \"speech acts\".\nTo listen means to try and understand what has been said. Listening is often one side of a conversation. Asking questions helps one understand what has been said. A subject can be better understood by asking the correct questions.\nListening differs from obeying. Parents often say to a disobedient child that he \"didn't listen to me\", meaning, he heard but didn't do as was suggested.\nListening also applies to sounds, not just language. It is \"active\" hearing. We hear a sound, and know what it means. This applies to animals as well. Cats list in the long grass for the little sounds that mice make. So perhaps a better description of listening is \"deliberate hearing to get the meaning of sounds\"."}

It should be studied without one\u2019s own beliefs in mind, which would affect our understanding of that culture. An anthropologist named Franz Boas created the idea of cultural relativism in 1887, but the concept Boas created did not receive its name until Alain Locke gave Boas\u2019s concept the name in 1924. This concept is now accepted by anthropologists around the world.\nMethodological tool.\nFranz Boas noticed that people who study other cultures still tend to be ethnocentric and look at other cultures with their own ideas about how life should be based on their culture. A person may be ethnocentric without meaning to be. Ethnocentrism is the idea that one\u2019s own culture is the best, and other cultures are studied or viewed with this outlook. In Boas\u2019 article \u201cOn Alternating Sounds,\u201d he explains how different cultures experience sound differently. When people study or come into contact with other cultures, people misunderstand sounds and language. An example used by Boas, is when he studies Eskimo texts, words and languages spelled in the Bureau of Ethnology by British Columbia. There were many misspellings explained by a misunderstanding by other cultures that have a different phonetic system rooted in a person's life. \nIn order to reduce this ethnocentrism from happening when anthropologists study other cultures, Boas thought that the person would need to live with people that they were studying for a long period of time. A person would be able to learn the culture and language better, and then decrease the number of times they misinterpret sounds and language of that culture. \nAnalytical device.\nOne of Franz Boas\u2019 students, Ruth Benedict, was an anthropologist that studied the beliefs and practices within a culture\u2019s social system. She noticed that they became mixed patterns of ideas and practices. Benedict believed that people should learn all of the ways people live. The way people show emotions, carry out daily routines or perform normal functions changes based on each individual\u2019s own culture. By studying these cultures, Benedict thought that people could understand that every culture has a different way of living and the way that person lived was not the only way \nMoral relativism.\nRuth Benedict also noticed that an individual\u2019s view of what actions were right and what actions were wrong relied on one\u2019s own culture. A person formed what was right and wrong based on social norms and values of their culture. They then formed their system of morals, which told them how to live. Benedict believed that no one person\u2019s morals were necessarily better or worse than another\u2019s; it was all relative on the society in which they lived. \nCritical device.\nTwo anthropologists, George Marcus and Michael Fisher, explain cultural relativism as being a critical device because it is a tool used in analyzing and studying other cultures. It is also used to self-reflect on our own culture. An example of cultural relativism being used as a critical device is the research of an anthropologist, Margaret Mead. After looking at young female sexuality in Samoa, located in New Guinea, Mead questions the \u2018natural\u2019 stress related to American adolescence and sexuality as bound to happen.\nVariations of relativism.\nRichard Feinberg, an anthropologist, identifies cultural relativism as having three types: contextual, ethical and epistemological. Contextual relativism is defined as members of a community or society having beliefs and practices that are represented through symbols and meanings that need to be understood within that culture. A practice that appears to be similar in two different cultures could be understood completely different among those two communities, which is an idea that Boas highlighted in his works. Ethical relativism is identified as cultures having no good or bad practices and beliefs, so people should not be able to make these judgments, as Benedict has explained. Epistemological relativism is explained as the view that a person cannot truly understand another culture in a useful or meaningful way, which is similar to Boas\u2019 \u2018historical anthropology\u2019 now identified as historical particularism.

He claimed to be a descendant of a Cenwalh, a brother of Penda and Eowa. The sudden death of King Ecgfrith of Mercia was suspicious and certainly benefited Coenwulf but he was never formally accused. Coenwulf proved to be a strong king who quickly restored Mercian in southern England. He was the last of the Mercian overlords or .\nKing of Mercia.\nCoenwulf was the son of Cuthbert, a Mercian nobleman. He came to the throne in 796, the same year Offa and his son Ecgfrith both died. At the same time Coenwulf became king, Eadberht Praen set himself up as king of Kent. An Eadwald set himself up as king of the East Angles and began issuing coins. When Eadberht Praen expelled Aethelheard, the Archbishop of Canterbury from Kent, Coenwulf contacted Pope Leo III and got permission to remove the new Kentish king. Eadbert attacked Kent, and captured Eadbert. He then set up his brother Cuthred as king of Kent. Coenwulf then dealt with East Anglia where Eadwald had tried to gain independence from Mercia. In 799 Coenwulf made a peace treaty with Wessex. He restored Mercian power to southern England very quickly. He then began using the style of Charlemagne calling himself king and emperor. He attacked the Welsh making raids on Gwynedd and Powys. In one of these battles Caradog ap Meirion, the king of Gwynedd was killed. In 801 King Eardwulf of Northumbria attacked Mercia. He accused Coenwulf of giving refuge to his enemies. Eventually the two made peace on equal terms. This was through the mediations of several bishops and nobles.\nCoenwulf wanted all the English churches placed under the authority of a single archbishop. But he wanted him seated in London, not Canterbury. He managed to abolish the of Lichfield in 803. Coenwulf tried to convince the pope on moving the remaining archbishopric to London. But the pope felt that Coenwulf's success in bringing Kent under his control meant the move was no longer necessary. So the archbishop remained in Canterbury, Kent. When Archbishop Aethelheard died in 805, his Wulfred was appointed the new archbishop. Wulfred witnessed charters for Coenwulf from 805 to 817 but then promptly stopped. Archbishop Wulfred and King Coenwulf quarreled for several years. It may have started over a claim by Coenwulf to various lands held by the see of Canterbury. Wulfred in turn began minting coins without the name of King Coenwulf. Finally in 817 Coenwulf took Wulfred's monasteries of Reculver and Minster-in-Thanet. Then he brought charges against Wulfred to Pope Paschal I. As a result, Wulfred was relieved of many of his duties by the pope. In 821 Coenwulf summoned the archbishop to appear before him in London. There Wulfred was fined 120 pounds and an estate of 250 hides He was then restored to his duties as archbishop. In 818 he was again attacking the Britons in Dyfed. He was planning another campaign against Wales when he died in 821. He was succeeded by his brother Ceolwulf I of Mercia. Coenwulf was buried at Winchcombe abbey where his daughter Cwenthryh was later . A lead seal belonging to King Coenwulf was found during the 19th century in Italy. It is now in the British Museum.\nFamily.\nCoenwulf had two known children:"}

Fully automatic means that the gun will continue to fire very rapidly so long as the trigger is pressed and held. Burst fire means that when you pull the trigger, a number of shots determined by the shooter will be fired (for some guns, this is three shots, fired very quickly). Machine pistols fire pistol cartridges. Machine pistols usually have the cartridges fed into the gun with a magazine, which is a rectangular box which holds the cartridges.\nMachine pistols are usually self-loading, which means that the gun automatically loads a new cartridge into the chamber after a shot is fired. \nHistory.\nThe first true machine pistol was the German MP-18 introduced in 1918. It fired the 9mm Parabellum cartridge. It used a side-loading magazine that held 20 cartridges. \nThe Germans converted some pistols, like the Luger, into machine pistols. They invented a type of Luger called the Luger P08 in World War I to German artillery crews. It had a longer barrel and a 32 round magazine shaped like a round drum. It was given to artillery crews so they could defend themselves.\nIn 1951 the Russian army developed the Stechkin APS, which could fire in burst fire or in fully automatic fire. When the gun was used in burst or automatic fire, users were told to use the wooden stock so that they can control the weapon better. One of the problems with machine pistols is they tend to rise up when being fired, making the bullets miss their target.\n1990s2000s.\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, as more soldier began wearing bulletproof vests with hard ceramic armor, the machine pistol became less useful in a military setting. The low-powered pistol ammunition was not able to penetrate ceramic-plated Kevlar military vests. As a result, armies began to issue a new gun, the personal defense weapon or PDW. The PDW fires armor-piercing, higher-powered ammunition which can go through bulletproof vests."}

During the Nazi occupation of France, the resistance was an inspiring example of patriotic behavior and bravery.\nWhen the war was over, the Resistance executed about 9,000 people who were collaborating with the Nazi occupiers. This included many members of the Milices, a fascist organization that helped Nazi Germany."}

In this, a dancer performs an erotic dance either contacting their body (contact dancing) with a seated patron or within a very short distance of a seated patron.\nThe dancer may be naked, topless or wearing a bikini top and bottom, depending on the laws in the jurisdiction of the strip club and the club's policies. With full-contact lap dances, the stripper may engage in contact with the patron, such as pressing his or her body against the patron. Different types include a \"couch dance\", which is a lap dance where the customer is seated on a couch, and bed dance where the customer lies down on a bed. \nIn some clubs, a \"block session\" of lap dances (usually half an hour to an hour) can be booked in a \"champagne room\", which is a private room in the back of a club. In many clubs, the duration of a lap dance is measured by the length of the song being played by the club's DJ. Charges for lap dances vary.\nDepending on the local jurisdiction and community standards, lap dances can involve touching of the dancer by the patron, touching the patron by the dancer, neither, or both. In some clubs, any touching by the patron is forbidden. On the other hand, if a club does not enforce its rules, levels of contact may be negotiable between the participants. Clubs vary widely with regard to whether they enforce their rules or ignore any violations.\nCritics of lapdancing say that some club owners, by installing dark private booths and charging dancers high stage fees to work at the club, are encouraging the sale of sexual acts between customers and dancers. According to the UK paper The Guardian, \"Research shows that the majority of women become lap-dancers through poverty and lack\" of other jobs."}

Although costly to both sides, King Egbert won. The battle effectively brought an end to Mercian in southern England. It gave Wessex over the remaining Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in the south. A century later the kingdom of Wessex became the kingdom of England.\nBackground.\nVikings murdered every one during the 8th century and early 9th centuries, the kings of Mercia exercised varying degrees of overlordship over the kingdoms of south-eastern England. Some even ruled other kingdoms directly. While Wessex had at times been obliged to recognise the power of Mercian kings there was usually a strong resistance to allowing them to directly rule Wessex.\nBeorhtric of Wessex (786\u2013802) had probably received help from Offa of Mercia (757\u2013796) in becoming king of Wessex. In 789 he married Eadburh, Offa's daughter. For the remainder of his rule Wessex was subordinate to Mercia. At the time Beorhtric became king, Egbert was also a claimant. Edgar was exiled for a time from Wessex and spent most of his time at the court of Charlemagne. On the death of Beorhtric Egbert returned and succeeded to the throne. At this time Coenwulf of Mercia (796\u2013821) was king and he concluded a peace treaty with Wessex.\nIn 815 Egbert invaded Cornwall and brought it under his rule. He allowed sub-kings to rule it for him. \nBeginning in 825 Egbert began a series of military operations with the intent of increasing his over Wales. At the same time the new king of Mercia, Beornwulf, having had extended his authority over Kent, Essex and Middlesex decided to invade Wessex.\nThe battle.\nEgbert was in Cornwall with his army when he received word that the Mercians had invaded Wessex. He led his army back into Wessex and met Beornwulf and his army at Ellendun (now Wroughton south of Swindon). In what Frank Stenton called \"one of the most decisive battles of Anglo-Saxon history\", Egbert defeated Beornwulf. The battle was costly to both sides in loss of life. Henry of Huntingdon said the river ran red with blood. The victory over Mercia shifted the balance of power to Egbert. He was now the most accomplished king in southern England.\nShift in power.\nImmediately Egbert sent his son Athelwulf with an army to overthrow Baldred, the Mercian sub-king in Kent. As a result, all of Kent, Surrey, Sussex and East Anglia submitted to Egbert. Beornwulf tried to recover East Anglia later the same year and was killed in the attempt. Kent, Surrey and Sussex remained a part of the kingdom of Wessex from this time on. Egbert appointed his son Athelwulf as sub-king of Kent which included all the new territories of Wessex.\nIn 829 Egbert invaded, then defeated all of Mercia. Wiglaf was exiled. The king of Northumbria submitted to him after the defeat of Mercia. He assumed the title (King of Mercia). This title was also on coins made in the former Mercian port of London.

The tip can be a specific range of money or a percentage of the bill, such as 15 percent or 20 percent. In some circumstances, such as with government workers in some areas, giving tips is against the law. Some restaurants charge a service charge and add it onto the bill.

A carbine is a shorter, lighter type of rifle. It was based on the M16 rifle.\nThe M4 is a gas-operated, shoulder-fired weapon. The cartridges are fed into the gun with a magazine, which is a rectangular box that holds the cartridges. It has a stock that can be extended or pushed in and a 14.5 in (370\u00a0mm) barrel to make it easier for soldiers to use the weapon in confined spaces. Like the other rifles in the M16 family, it fires the .223 caliber, or 5.56mm NATO round.\nThe M4 can be fired in two ways, either semi-automatic (which fires one bullet when the trigger is pulled) and three-round burst (which fires three bullets very quickly when the trigger is pulled). The M4A1 can fire fully automatic instead of three-round burst. The carbine can have an M203 grenade as well as the newer M320 grenade launcher mounted on it. The M4 can be fitted with many accessories, such as night vision devices, silencers, laser pointers, telescopic sights, bipods, a shotgun, and forward hand grips.\nThe United States Marine Corps has ordered its officers (up to the rank of lieutenant colonel) and staff non-commissioned officers to carry the M4 carbine instead of the M9 pistol. The M4 is also widely used by police officers.\nTrademark issues.\nThe plastic pistol was developed and produced for the United States government by Colt Firearms, which had an exclusive contract to produce the M4 family of weapons through 2009. Colt previously held a U.S. trademark on the term \"M4\".\nOther manufacturers offer M4-like firearms. Many manufacturers have production firearms that are essentially identical to a military M4, but with a 16\" barrel. Civilian models are sometimes colloquially referred to as \"M4gery\", a portmanteau word from \"M4\" and \"forgery\". \nColt said it held sole rights to the M4 name and design. Other manufacturers said that Colt was overstating its rights, and that \"M4\" was now a generic term for a shortened AR-15. On December 8, 2005, a District court judge ruled that \"M4\" \"was\" now a generic name, and that Colt's trademark should be revoked."}

First, it allows a student to see if they need to change how they study for the class (if they do not do well on the exam) or if they should continue to study the same way for the rest of the term (if they do well). This tells a student who does not do well that they should drop the class. Many colleges stop allowing students to drop a class a week or two after the first midterm exam. Midterm exams can also show how well a teacher is doing in teaching their class. Some teachers give more than one midterm exam."}

In places where the soil was very rich, a hide of land would be smaller. Where the soil was poor the hide would be larger. It was never a standard using fixed measurements. Later in Anglo-Saxon England a hide became a unit on which to base payment of or tax. The hide was also used to determine public obligations.

The author wrote it because he did not like Booker T. Washington, an African-American political leader, teacher and author, attending a dinner at the White House. Washington had been invited by President Theodore Roosevelt, who was white. Many years later, in 1929, the poem appeared again. This was after African-American congressman Oscar DePriest's wife went to a tea for congressional wives at the White House. She had been invited by First Lady Lou Hoover. Many white people, especially in the Southern United States, did not like either visit. They held the opinion then that African-American people should not be involved in government affairs.\nThe poem has fourteen stanzas. Each stanza has four lines. The second and fourth line of each stanza rhymes. The bad word \"nigger\" is seen many times in the poem. Nobody knows who wrote it.\nHistory.\nBooker T. Washington incident.\nBooker T. Washington was an African American born into slavery. He was freed in 1865 and rose to become an educator and a national leader of African Americans. On October 16, 1901, President Theodore Roosevelt asked Washington to have dinner with his family at the White House. It was a working dinner, Roosevelt's intention was to appoint Washington to advise him on issues of race. A family friend from Colorado, Philip Stewart was also there. A reporter from the AP Wire asked the president about his appointments he was going to announce the next day. But the story that appeared in the AP wire read: \"Booker T. Washington, of Tuskegee, Alabala, dined with the President last evening.\" This caused some shock among many white people. The President of the United States had sat down to dinner with a black man, a former slave at that. African Americans had visited the White House before but had never been asked to dine there. Washington had dined with President McKinley previously which also caused an uproar at that time. This time segregationalists in the U.S. Congress were outraged. Senator \"Pitchfork\" Bill Tillman of South Carolina said, \"The action will necessitate our killing a thousand niggers in the South before they will learn their place again.\"\nAfter this, somebody decided to write the poem, \"Niggers in the White House\". No one knows who the author was.\nThe DePriest incident.\nMany years later, in 1929, First Lady Lou Hoover, wife of president Herbert Hoover, invited Congressional wife Jessie DePriest to join her for tea. She was a black woman married to Oscar DePriest, the first African American to be elected to Congress from Illinois. People were also upset about this. The poem appeared again because of this incident. Southern newspapers and racist critics reacted with their normal outrage and letters of protest. The White House spokesman pointed out the president and his wife were simply doing their constitutional duties. As examples President Grover Cleveland had hosted Frederick Douglass and his wife On five separate occasions president Woodrow Wilson met at the White House with the black minister from Haiti, Solon Menos. \nPoliticians took sides. Senator Coleman Blease from South Carolina inserted the poem in a Senate resolution. The resolution with its poem were rejected and removed from the \"Congressional Record.\" The vote was based on protests from senators Walter Edge (from New Jersey) and Hiram Bingham (from Connecticut). Senator Bingham described the poem as \"indecent, obscene doggerel verse\" which gave \"offense to hundreds of thousands of our fellow citizens and an offense to the Declaration of Independence and our Constitution.\" Senator Baise then agreed to withdraw the resolution he said, as a favor to Senator Bingham and not to the negro race."}

It is designed to absorb and/or deflect slashing, bludgeoning, and penetrating attacks.\nIt was first used to protect soldiers, today it is used to protect riot police, private security guards and bodyguards. There are two different types of armour. There is regular non-plated personal armor used by most police, security guards and bodyguards. There is also hard-plate reinforced personal armor, which is used by combat soldiers, police tactical units and hostage rescue teams.\nArmour is certainly very ancient, but it was little used in infantry warfare for quite a long time, with the exception of helmets. From about the 18th century to the Vietnam war, men fought relatively unprotected. The weight and cost of effective armour meant it was no longer practical to have infantrymen armoured.\nThe invention of carbon fibre, modern hard ceramics and various plastic compounds are suitable for light armour which is effective in many circumstances. Kevlar, Technora and Nomex are Aramids, which are long-chain aromatic polyamides. They are used to make bullet resistant vests and bullet resistant face masks. The PASGT helmet and vest used by United States military forces since the early 1980s both have Kevlar as a main component, as do their replacements. Most of these items have padding on the inside to act as shock-absorbers, and to increase comfort during while being worn.\nSo, with the lighter weight and increased stopping-power of personal armour, the modern soldier is once again protected against most of the weapons of the day.\nIn practice.\nIn December 2009, during the War in Afghanistan, a British soldier in southern Helmand Province, survived a shot to the back during an operation to clear insurgents from a village, protected by the body armor kit he was wearing."}

This rebellion is known as the Warsaw Uprising () today. The resistance Home Army wanted to free Warsaw from Nazi Germany. The resistance army fought against German troops for 63 days. After that, there was no chance of winning, so they surrendered. German troops killed many civilians in the city. After the uprising, the city of Warsaw was destroyed almost completely. At the time of the uprising, the Red Army was stationed on the other side of the river Vistula, which runs through the city of Warsaw. As of 2021, the question, why these troops did not take part in the fighting, is unclear. Historians have given several theories. \nThe Uprising was the largest attack done by any European resistance movement of World War II. The Slovak National Uprising, which happened from 29 August to 28 October 1944. is comparable, \nOverview.\nAt the same time as the attack, the Soviet Union's Red Army got close to the east of the city and the German forces retreated. However, the Soviets stopped moving forward. This allowed the Germans to destroy the city and defeat the Polish resistance.\nThe Warsaw uprising began on 1 August 1944. It was part of a big plan, Operation \"Tempest\". Operation Tempest started when the Soviet Army got near Warsaw. The goals of the Polish resistance were to push the German troops out of the city. They also wanted to free Warsaw before the Soviets arrived. This would help the Polish Underground State to take control of the city.\nAt the start of the battle, the Polish resistance got control over most of central Warsaw. By 14 September, Polish forces under Soviet command captured the east bank of the Vistula river. \nWinston Churchill asked Stalin and Franklin D. Roosevelt to help the Polish troops, but the Soviets would not help. Churchill sent over 200 drops of supplies by air. The US Army Air Force sent one drop of supplies by air.\nAbout 16,000 members of the Polish resistance were killed and about 6,000 were badly wounded. In addition, between 150,000 and 200,000 Polish civilians were killed. The Germans also found many Jews the Poles were hiding. \nMore than 8,000 German soldiers were killed or went missing, and 9,000 were wounded. During the fighting in the city about a quarter of Warsaw's buildings were destroyed. After the surrender of Polish forces, German troops destroyed 35% of the city.\nBackground.\nBy July 1944, Poland had been occupied by Nazi German troops for almost five years. The Polish Home Army was loyal to the Polish government in London. It had planned to attack the Germans. Germany was fighting a group of Allied powers, led by the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.\nAt the start, the plan of the Home Army was to join with the invading forces of the Western Allies as they freed Europe from the Nazis. However, in 1943, the Soviets were about to reach the pre-war borders of Poland before the Allied invasion of Europe got very far.\nThe Soviets and the Poles were both enemies of Nazi Germany. But they had different goals. The Home Army wanted a democratic capitalist Poland that was allied with the West. The Soviet leader Stalin wanted to make Poland a communist country that was allied to the Soviet Union.\nThe Soviets and the Poles did not trust each other. Soviet partisans in Poland often disagreed with Polish resistance troops that were allied to the Home Army.\nStalin stopped all Polish-Soviet relations on 25 April 1943 after the Germans told the world about the Katyn massacre of Polish army officers. Stalin refused to admit that he ordered the killings.\nThe Home Army commander, Tadeusz B\u00f3r-Komorowski made a plan on 20 November, called Operation \"Tempest\". On the Eastern Front, local units of the Home Army were to attack the German \"Wehrmacht\" and help Soviet troops.\nEvening before the battle.\nOn 13 July 1944 as the Soviet attack crossed the old Polish border, the Poles had to make a decision. They could either start to attack the Germans, which might not be supported by the Soviets, or do no attacks and be criticized by the Soviets.\nThe Poles were worried that if Poland was freed from German occupation by the Red Army, then the Allies would not accept the Polish government in London after the war.\nWhen the Poles saw the actions of the Soviet forces, they realized they needed to make a decision. In Operation \"Ostra Brama\", NKVD forces shot or arrested Polish officers and forced lower ranks to join the Soviet-controlled Polish forces.\nOn 21 July, the Home Army decided to launch Operation \"Tempest\" in Warsaw soon. The plan was intended as a way of showing Poland was its own country and as an attack against the German occupiers. On 25 July, the Polish government-in-exile (against the views of Polish Commander-in-Chief General Kazimierz Sosnkowski) approved the plan for an uprising in Warsaw.\nIn the early summer of 1944, German plans required Warsaw to be the defensive centre of the area. The Germans wanted to hold on to Warsaw no matter how many losses they had. The Germans had built fortifications and sent many new troops to the area. This slowed after the failed '20 July plot' to kill Adolf Hitler. The German troops in Warsaw were weak and did not feel confident.\nHowever, by the end of July, German forces in the area had new troops sent to them. On 27 July, the Governor of the Warsaw District, Ludwig Fischer, called for 100,000 Polish men and women to build fortifications around the city. The inhabitants of Warsaw did not follow his demand.\nThe Home Army became worried about possible revenge actions by the Germans or mass arrests, which would make it hard for the Poles to start an attack. The Soviet forces were approaching Warsaw, and Soviet-controlled radio stations called for the Polish people to attack the Germans.\nOn 25 July, the Union of Polish Patriots made a radio broadcast from Moscow. It told Poles to attack the Germans. On 29 July, the first Soviet tanks reached the edges of Warsaw. They were counter-attacked by two German Panzer Corps: the 39th and 4th SS. On 29 July 1944 Radio Station Kosciuszko located in Moscow told Poles to \"Fight The Germans!\".\nB\u00f3r-Komorowski and several senior officers held a meeting on that day. Jan Nowak-Jeziora\u0144ski, who had arrived from London, said support from the Allies would be weak. On 31 July, the Polish commanders General Tadeusz B\u00f3r-Komorowski and Colonel Antoni Chru\u015bciel ordered the Home Army forces for to be ready by 17:00 the following day.\nWola massacre.\nDuring the uprising, Heinrich Himmler had given the order to storm Wola, a part of Warsaw. The rebels were holding this quarter. Himmler ordered that all people in Wazaw, which were not German, must be killed. This order was applicable to both civilians, and fighters, and also did not take into account if the people supported the uprising. With this order, Himmler wanted to break down the resistance of the Polish people against the German occupation. As a result, there were mass killings of people, mostly between August 5 and August 7. Estimates are that between 20,000 and 30,000 civilians were killed. in these three days. According to sources, about 20 German soldiers were killed, about 40 were wounded. Until August 12, about 50,000 Polish civilians lost their lives in Wola. "}

Bike rage is similar to other road rage.\nA bike rage event can start because a cyclist, driver, or pedestrian thinks that another road user was breaking traffic rules, or in other ways because someone felt that their safety was threatened by another road user. Some people consider that the problem is city planners have mixed bikes and cars together in the same ways and may cause lots of chances for conflict. As such, cyclists feel threatened in traffic and hard done by and under attack. \nAn article in \"Toronto Life\" magazine argued that the source of the problem bike rage is neither the problem of drivers nor the problem of cyclists, but the environment in which they interact. A possible explanation between cyclists and drivers is the anonymity of the big city; all the cyclists and drivers know they will never meet each other again.\nExamples.\nDrivers attacking cyclists\nAn event from New York Times show that a 41-year-old cyclist, Dan Cooley was injured by a driver who became angry at him after an exchange of insults. The event began when the driver overtake in front of Mr. Cooley. As Mr. Cooley moved off the road, the driver drove the car to him, and used car to hurted him. Mr. Cooley fell on the ground and then the driver got out of the car and attacked him. Mr. Cooley got concussion and a torn ligament when he was taken to hospital. Mr. Cooley said that the reason for anger between cyclists and drivers is the car had monopolized the road for long time, however, bicyclists become more and more popular to save gas in this time. No one knows how to share the road.\nCyclists attacking drivers\nIn 2004 Chicago had an event that a cyclist attacked a driver. A Pennsylvania bicyclist shot a truck driver after an altercation. The truck driver, William Nicoletti, 51, when he drove past the cyclist, the man on the bike made obscene gesture to him. Not only for this, but also he drew a pistol and shot Mr. Nicoletti. The man on the bicycle, Robert Urick, 41, was \"charged with attempted homicide, aggravated assault and weapons offenses.\"\nIn Toronto in January 2006, a driver threw his lunch out the window of his car. A 26-year-old bike courier threw the food back into the car. The driver tossed two cups of hot coffee at the courier. Then the driver attacked the woman and her bike.\nA cyclist named Jefferey Guffey from Indiana told a driver to slow down. The driver attacked Guffey and bit part of his ear off. Police charged the driver with an offence.\nIn Toronto in 2007, a cyclist got angry at a driver. The cyclist then stabbed the driver in the face and neck with a screwdriver."}

{"id": "425307", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=425307", "title": "Applied behavior analysis", "text": "Applied behavior analysis (ABA) is a way to help organisms change their behavior, and to identify the environmental contingencies that result in this behavior change. ABA, the application of behavior analysis, is based on the scientific approach known as radical behaviorism, which views covert events as behavior that are to be subjected to the same conditions as overt behavior. ABA can be used as a treatment for animals, mental disorders, and developmental disabilities, and is based on the principles of behavior that were discovered using experiments.\nHistory.\nScientific experiments and articles about ABA are published in the \"Journal for Applied Behavior Analysis\" (JABA.) This journal was founded in 1968. In the first issue of JABA, three people wrote an article explaining what Applied behavior analysis is.\nPsychologists who study the way the environment influences behavior are called behaviorists. They study the external causes of behavior instead of a person's feelings. A person's feelings are internal so behaviorists think they cannot be studied scientifically.\nPsychologist John B. Watson founded Behaviorism in 1913 and he is regarded as one of the first psychologists to study the applied science of behavior. He thought that internal feelings should not be studied at all. He also thought that behavior is shaped by the environment over time due to the outcome of a person's actions. He believed all behavior is learned and can be changed. If a person gets something good as a result of doing a behavior they are more likely to repeat that behavior. If something bad happens as a result of a behavior a person is less likely to do that thing again. This is an idea that is used a lot in ABA.\nOne of the most famous behaviorists was the psychologist B.F. Skinner. Skinner first published his ideas about behaviorism in 1938. He wrote a lot about behaviorism throughout his career. He made some of the behavior principles that ABA uses.\nABA emerged when experimental behavior principles were applied to social behavior. There are various people that began the process of applying these principles to social behavior. One of the most famous was Ole Ivar Lovaas. In the 1960s, Lovaas became one of the first people to use applied behavior analysis as a treatment for autism. When Lovaas began using ABA to treat children with autism he changed the way developmental disorders were treated. Lovaas also thought that treatments would be more successful if they are started early in a child's life. The idea of starting treatment with a child as soon as possible is called 'early intervention'. Early intervention is still thought to be very important in ABA.\nOne of the more recent developments in Applied Behavior Analysis is the founding of the Behavior Analysis Certification Board (BACB). The BACB is a non-profit corporation that was started in 1998. The BACB certifies behavior analysts. In order to become a behavior analyst a person must go to a special school and then pass an exam. Once they pass this exam they will be board certified behavior analysts. The BACB sets standards to make sure board certified behavior analysts (BCBAs) are good at their jobs. The BACB makes sure that the BCBAs are using ethical, legal, and professional practices when they work.\nCharacteristics.\nThere are seven characteristics of ABA A treatment that is based on ABA must have all of these things.\nDefinitions and concepts.\nThe following terms and ideas are used in Applied Behavior Analysis. It is important to understand these ideas when using ABA based interventions.\nProblem behavior.\nIn ABA, a behavior that is bad is called a problem behavior. Problem behavior is something that hurts the person doing it or hurts other people around them. A problem behavior makes it harder for a person to learn new things.\nPositive reinforcement.\nPositive reinforcement (SR+) is when the \"addition\" of a stimulus leads to an increase in responding. There are four different types of positive reinforcement:\nNegative reinforcement.\nNegative reinforcement (SR-) happens when the \"removal\" of a stimulus increases the likelihood a person will do a behavior in the future. In this case the term negative does not mean bad. The stimulus that is removed from the environment is something aversive. This means that the person does not like it. People will want to do a behavior if they know that something they do not like will be taken away.\nReinforcement schedules.\nReinforcements are given based on schedules of reinforcement. The schedule will explain the ways reinforcement is earned. Behavior analysts decide which reinforcement schedule is best. Different schedules are useful for different things. The schedule used depends on the person. It also depends on the behavior that is being reinforced.\nContinuous reinforcement schedules.\nContinuous reinforcement schedules (CRF) reinforce a person every time they do the target behavior. There are a few problems with CRF schedules though. The rates of behavior are not long-lasting. If the person stops being reinforced they may stop doing the target behavior. Another issue is satiation. If the person becomes satiated it means that they do not want the reinforcer anymore.\nIntermittent reinforcement schedules.\nThese schedules of reinforcement only reinforce the target behavior sometimes. The four most common types of intermittent schedules are:\nDifferential reinforcement.\nA discriminative stimulus (SD) is something that tells a person that reinforcement is available. The presentation of a SD should cause a response. Differential reinforcement teaches a person the difference between a SD and a non-discriminative stimulus (S-delta). A SD signals that reinforcement is available. A S-delta does not tell the person anything about the availability of reinforcement. A S-delta is not likely to produce responses because there is reinforcement is not given.\nIt is also used to decrease problem behavior. There are four types of differential reinforcement that can be used to decrease a problem behavior.\nExtinction.\nExtinction is a way to decrease rates of problem behavior. A DRA program should be used at the same time as an extinction program. This will make the extinction program more effective.\nPunishment.\nReinforcement is always the first thing that is tried when trying to change a behavior. Reinforcement produces long-lasting results and is better for the person. However reinforcement does not always reduce problem behavior. If reinforcement does not work it may be necessary to try punishment. Punishment is effective but it can have bad consequences. It can cause emotional harm if it is not used correctly.\nPunishment is any response to a behavior that \"decreases\" the likelihood of a behavior happening in the future. Punishment of a problem behavior should be used with reinforcement of the appropriate behavior. Appropriate behavior should always be reinforced even when using punishment for problem behavior. Just like reinforcement, punishment can be both positive and negative. Positive punishment is the \"addition\" of an stimulus that decreases the chances of future responses. This stimulus that is added is something aversive. Negative punishment is the \"removal\" of a stimulus that decreases the chance of future behaviors happening. The stimulus that is removed is something that the person likes.\nPrompting.\nPrompting increases the likelihood that a behavior will be done the right way. Using prompts will make the learning process easier and quicker. Someone that is teaching a new behavior can use prompts to help the person that is learning the behavior. The two broad categories of prompts are stimulus and response.\nExamples of stimulus prompts would be: lists or pictures that help the learner remember what the correct response is.\nResponse prompts do not involve a change in the antecedent. There are three types of response prompts.\nFading.\nFading prompts is a way to increase the independence of the learner. Once the learner can do the behavior on their own they will not need the help of the teacher. However, if a teacher stops using prompts quickly it may confuse the learner. So prompts should be decreased slowly. The process of gradually decreasing prompting is called 'fading'.\nShaping.\nShaping is a way to teach new behaviors or improve behaviors that have already been taught. It involves reinforcing steps towards a target behavior.\nChaining.\nComplex behaviors are made up of smaller simple behaviors. This is what the concept of behavior chains is based on. A behavior chain is when smaller behaviors are combined to form a complex behavior. These smaller behaviors are done in a certain order. Each of the smaller behaviors is a step in the behavior chain. Each step in a behavior chain is a response on its own. There are three different ways to teach a behavior chain:\nAnalyzing behavior.\nABA relies on data to make decisions about behavior. Behavior analysts are always collecting data about a person's behavior.\nData collection.\nDirect observation is when behavior is watched and recorded. Indirect measures compare one person's behavior to other people's behavior. An example would be an intelligence test. One person's score is compared to the scores that other people got.\nThere are three common methods of data collection. They are frequency, interval, and time sampling. These methods are used for direct observation.\nFunctional analysis.\nA functional analysis (FA) is done to find the reason for problem behavior. The reason for problem behavior must be known before a behavioral intervention can be done. Behavior analysts came up with the idea of a functional analysis in 1982. Since then it has become an important part of ABA. The behavior analyst is tries to find the situations that cause the highest rates of problem behavior. The situations that cause the highest rates of problem behavior tell the behavior analyst the reason for the behavior. Once the reasons for problem behavior are known treatment can begin.\nTreatments based on the results of a FA are more effective than without a FA.\nUse for treatment of autism.\nApplied behavior analysis is commonly associated with autism. This is because ABA is the only treatment for autism that has been scientifically proven to be effective."}

{"id": "425382", "revid": "917214", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=425382", "title": "Determinant", "text": "The determinant of a square matrix is a scalar (a number) that indicates how that matrix behaves. It can be calculated from the numbers in the matrix.\nThe determinant of the matrix formula_1 is written as formula_2 or formula_3 in a formula. Sometimes, instead of formula_4 and formula_5, one simply writes formula_6 and formula_7.\nInterpretation.\nThere are a few ways to understand what the determinant says about a matrix.\nGeometric interpretation.\nAn formula_8 matrix can be seen as describing a linear map in formula_9 dimensions. In which case, the determinant indicates the factor by which this matrix scales (grows or shrinks) a region of formula_9-dimensional space.For example, a formula_11 matrix formula_1, seen as a linear map, will turn a square in 2-dimensional space into a parallelogram. That parallellogram's area will be formula_2 times as big as the square's area.In the same way, a formula_14 matrix formula_15, seen as a linear map, will turn a cube in 3-dimensional space into a parallelepiped. That parallelepiped's volume will be formula_16 times as big as the cube's volume.\nThe determinant can be negative or zero. A linear map can stretch and scale a volume, but it can also reflect it over an axis. Whenever this happens, the sign of the determinant changes from positive to negative, or from negative to positive. A negative determinant means that the volume was mirrored over an odd number of axes.\n\"System of equations\" interpretation.\nOne can think of a matrix as describing a system of linear equations. That system has a unique non-trivial solution \"exactly\" when the determinant is not 0 (\"non-trivial\" meaning that the solution is not just all zeros).\nIf the determinant is zero, then there is either no unique non-trivial solution, or there are infinitely many.\nSingular matrices.\nA matrix has an inverse matrix exactly when the determinant is not 0. For this reason, a matrix with a non-zero determinant is called invertible. If the determinant is 0, then the matrix is called non-invertible or singular.\nGeometrically, one can think of a singular matrix as \"flattening\" the parallelepiped into a parallelogram, or a parallelogram into a line. Then the volume or area is 0, which means that there is no linear map that will bring the old shape back.\nCalculating a determinant.\nThere are a few ways to calculate a determinant.\nCofactor expansion.\nFor larger matrices, the determinant is harder to calculate. One way to do it is called cofactor expansion.\nSuppose that we have an formula_8 matrix formula_1. First, we choose any row or column of the matrix. For each number formula_24 in that row or column, we calculate something called its cofactor formula_25. Then formula_26.\nTo compute such a cofactor formula_25, we erase row formula_28 and column formula_29 from the matrix formula_1. This gives us a smaller formula_31 matrix. We call it formula_32. The cofactor formula_25 then equals formula_34.\nHere is an example of a cofactor expansion of the left column of a formula_14 matrix:\nformula_36\nAs illustrated above, one can simplify the computation of determinant by choosing a row or column that has many zeros; if formula_24 is 0, then one can skip calculating formula_25 altogether."}

He got the name \"Philip the Arab\" ( or ). (The \"Chronicon Paschale\", a Greek chronicle, and the Latin historian Aurelius Victor each have different dates for Philip's birth.) He was the son of Julius Marinus. Philip was probably born in the city he later named Philippopolis, in the Roman province of Arabia Petraea (now the city of Shahba, Syria).\nEmperor.\n244\u2013245.\nPhilip became emperor at the start of 244. (The \"Justinianic Code\"'s writing means that Philip became emperor after 13 January 244 and before 14 March the same year.) Philip's wife, Marcia Otacilia Severa, became \"augusta\" (empress) early in 244. After Philip became emperor, the Romans and the Sasanian Empire made peace. With this success, Philip got the name (or ) in the middle of 244. Philip came to Rome in 244, probably in early summer.\n245\u2013247.\nIn 245, Philip was Roman consul for the first time. That year, the Romans went to war with the Carpi. On 12 November 245, Philip was at Aquae in Dacia (Vidonac, Serbia). Wars against the Carpi and Germanic peoples continued into 247. In 247, Philip was Roman consul for the second time. In late summer 247, Philip held a triumph in Rome. For his military success against the Carpi, Philip probably got the name at the end of 247.\n247\u2013249.\nIn 248, Philip was Roman consul for the third time. In April 248, Philip held a festival for the one thousandth anniversary of Rome, a thousand years since Romulus became the first king of Rome. (The chronicle of the Latin historian Cassiodorus says that this started on 21 April and ended on the 23 April 248.)\nJohn Chrysostom wrote that unlike other pagan rulers of the Romans, Philip was tolerant to the Christians and let them practise their faith openly. Eusebius wrote Philip and his wife received letters from Origen.\nDeath.\nSome time before 11 September 249, soldiers in the Roman army killed Philip in a battle against the army of Decius. The battle was probably near Verona on the Italian Peninsula. Philip, Philip II, and Marcia Otacilia Severa may all have had \"damnatio memoriae\" on them, and the Romans removed their names from some inscriptions.\nThe Latin historian Eutropius says that Philip and Philip II were both deified (made into gods). This is probably not true. Where Philip's grave was is unknown.\nFamily.\nPhilip married Marcia Otacilia Severa before 238. At the start of 244, Marcia Otacilia Severa became \"augusta\" (empress) and got the Latin title: . Marcia Otacilia Severa probably died in 248.\nThey had a son, Philip II. The Latin history \"Epitome de Caesaribus\" says that Philip II was born in 236 or 237. Only the Greek historian John of Antioch says Philip had other sons. Philip made his son Philip II his \"caesar\" (junior emperor) in July or August 244. After July or August 244, Marcia Otacilia Severa also had the title . In July or August 247, Philip made his son his \"augustus\" (co-emperor).\nPhilip's father, Julius Marinus, died while his son was emperor. After that, people in Philippopolis in Arabia (Philip's home town) worshipped Julius Marinus as a god. However, the Roman Senate probably did not deify Julius Marinus, and he probably did not become one of the official gods.\nPhilip had a brother, Gaius Julius Priscus. He was a governor of Roman Mesopotamia () and then a praetorian prefect and governor of the East ()."}

The siege continued for 240 days up to 27 November 1941. On that date, the Allied 8th Army took control of Tobruk.\nThe reason that both sides wanted to control Tobruk is that it had a deep protected harbour. This made it a good place for ships to seek shelter. As well, the Italians had built fortifications. There were also escarpments and cliffs near Tobruk, which helped to protect the town from attack.\nThe Allies wanted to control Tobruk so that they could defend Egypt and the Suez Canal. When the Axis armies could no longer use the port at Tobruk, they had to bring in supplies at the distant port of Tripoli. This required the Axis armies to bring the supplies by truck through of desert. After the Allies won Tobruk, the Axis armies continuted fighting to take it back.

It was a major naval battle in the Pacific Ocean during World War II. The battle was between the Japanese Navy and Allied naval and air forces from the United States and Australia. The battle was the first battle between aircraft carriers. It was also the first naval battle in which the warships of neither side actually saw the warships of the other side. Instead, each side sent planes to attack the ships of the other side.\nJapanese forces made a plan to invade and occupy Port Moresby in New Guinea and Tulagi in the Solomon Islands. When the U.S. discovered this plan, it sent two Navy aircraft carrier groups and a combined Australian\u2013American cruiser force.\nOn 3\u20134 May, Japanese forces invaded and occupied Tulagi. The Japanese aircraft carriers entered the Coral Sea to try to destroy the Allied naval forces.\nOn 7 May, the carrier forces from the two sides sent planes to attack the ships of the other side. The first day, the U.S. sank the Japanese light carrier \"Sh\u014dh\u014d\", while the Japanese sank a U.S. destroyer. The next day, the Japanese carrier \"Sh\u014dkaku\" was badly damaged, and the U.S. carriers \"Lexington\" and the \"Yorktown\" were damaged. Since both sides suffered heavy losses in aircraft and carriers, the two fleets stopped the battle.\nThe Japanese sank more ships than the U.S. However, the battle was considered a victory for the Allies because the Japanese forces were not able to capture the locations they were hoping to occupy. As well, the Japanese carriers \"Sh\u014dkaku\" and \"Zuikaku\" were not able to fight in the Battle of Midway, which helped the U.S. to win there. Japan's losses of carriers meant that they could not invade Port Moresby. Two months later, the Allies launched the Guadalcanal Campaign.\nBackground.\nJapanese expansion.\nOn 7 December 1941, using aircraft carriers, the Japanese attacked the U.S. Pacific fleet at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. The attack destroyed most of the U.S. Pacific Fleet's battleships. It also started a state of war between the two nations. The Japanese wanted to destroy American navy ships, capture land with natural resources, and obtain military bases to defend their empire.\nAt the same time that they were attacking Pearl Harbor, the Japanese attacked Malaya. This caused the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand to join the United States as Allies in the war against Japan (Australia had joined World War 2 in 1939 when Germany invaded Poland). The goals of the Japanese battles in the war were to remove British and Americans from the Netherlands Indies and the Philippines.\nIn the first few months of 1942, Japanese forces attacked and captured the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore, the Netherlands East Indies, Wake Island, New Britain, the Gilbert Islands, and Guam. They also destroyed a lot of Allied land, naval, and air forces. Japan planned to use these lands to defend its empire.\nShortly after the war began, Japan's Naval General Staff wanted to invade Northern Australia. The goal was to prevent Australia from being used as a base to threaten Japan's defenses in the South Pacific.\nThe Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) said it did not have the forces or ships to invade Australia. Vice Admiral Shigeyoshi Inoue, commander of the IJN's 4th Fleet (also called the South Seas Force) had the idea of capturing Tulagi in the southeastern Solomon Islands and Port Moresby in New Guinea.\nThis would put northern Australia within range of Japanese land-based aircraft. Japan decided to capture New Caledonia, Fiji, and Samoa. This would make it hard for the United States to supply Australia.\nIn April 1942, the army and navy developed a plan called Operation \"MO\". The plan was to invade Port Moresby by 10 May. The plan also included capturing Tulagi on 2\u20133 May. This would give the navy a base for attacks against Allied territories and forces in the South Pacific.\nWhen \"MO\" was done, the navy planned to do Operation \"RY\". This was a plan to capture Nauru and Ocean Island for their phosphate deposits on 15 May.\nFurther attacks against Fiji, Samoa and New Caledonia were planned. There was a damaging air attack by Allied aircraft on Japanese naval forces invading the Lae-Salamaua area in New Guinea in March. Inoue requested carriers to provide airplanes. Inoue was worried about Allied bombers at air bases in Townsville and Cooktown, Australia.\nAdmiral Isoroku Yamamoto, commander of Japan's Combined Fleet, was planning an attack for June. He wanted to try to destroy the U.S. Navy's carriers. None were damaged in the Pearl Harbor attack.\nAllied response.\nUnknown to the Japanese, the U.S. Navy had decoded Japanese secret codes. By March 1942, the U.S. was able to figure out up to 15% of the IJN's code. By the end of April the Americans were reading up to 85% of the messages in code.\nIn March 1942, the U.S. first noticed the \"MO\" operation in messages. On 13 April, the British decoded an IJN message telling Inoue that the Fifth Carrier Division, consisting of the fleet carriers and , was being sent. The British sent the message to the Americans. They also said that Port Moresby would probably be attacked in the \"MO\" plan.\nAdmiral Chester Nimitz, the new commander of Allied forces in the Pacific, and his staff thought the Japanese were planning an attack in early May on Port Moresby. The Allies saw Port Moresby as an important base for attacking the Japanese. Nimitz's staff also thought that the Japanese might attack Allied bases in Samoa and at Suva.\nNimitz sent all four of the Pacific fleet's aircraft carriers to the Coral Sea. By 27 April, Japanese messages helped the allies to know most targets of the \"MO\" and \"RY\" plans.\nOn 29 April, Nimitz sent his four carriers and their supporting warships towards the Coral Sea. Task Force 17 consisted of the carrier , three cruisers and four destroyers. It was supported by two oilers and two destroyers.\nTask Force 11 consisted of the carrier with two cruisers. TF 16 included the carriers and the USS Hornet, but they were too far away.\nNimitz put Fletcher in command of Allied naval forces in the South Pacific area until Halsey arrived Halsey was told to command all three task forces once TF\u00a016 arrived in the Coral Sea area (Lundstrom, \"Pearl Harbor to Midway\", p.\u00a0167).\nThe Japanese thought that all but one of the U.S. Navy's carriers were in the central Pacific. The Japanese did not know the location of the other carrier, but they did not expect an American carrier response to \"MO\" until the attacks had begun.\nBattle.\nPrelude.\nDuring late April, the Japanese submarines and searched the area where landings were planned. The submarines explored Rossel Island and the Deboyne Group area and the route to Port Moresby. They did not see any Allied ships and returned to Rabaul on 23 and 24 April.\nThe Japanese Port Moresby Invasion Force, commanded by Rear Admiral K\u014ds\u014d Abe, included 11 transport ships carrying about 5,000 soldiers from the IJA's South Seas Detachment plus 500 more troops.\nThis included one light cruiser and six destroyers under the command of Rear Admiral Sadamichi Kajioka. Abe's ships departed Rabaul for the trip to Port Moresby on 4 May and were joined by Kajioka's force the next day. The ships, planned to arrive at Port Moresby by 10 May.\nThe Allied forces at Port Moresby had 5,333 men, but only half of these were infantry and all had poor equipment and little training.\nLeading the invasion of Tulagi was the Tulagi Invasion Force. It was commanded by Rear Admiral Kiyohide Shima. It consisted of two minelayers, two destroyers, six minesweepers, two subchasers, and a transport ship carrying about 400 troops. Supporting the Tulagi force was the light carrier , four heavy cruisers, and one destroyer, commanded by Rear Admiral Aritomo Got\u014d.\nThere was a separate force commanded by Rear Admiral Kuninori Marumo. It consisted of two light cruisers, the seaplane tender , and three gunboats. Inoue directed \"MO\" from the cruiser . He arrived on 4 May.\nGot\u014d's force left Truk on 28 April and stayed near New Georgia Island. Marumo's support group left New Ireland to establish a seaplane base on 2 May to support the Tulagi attack. Shima's invasion force left Rabaul on 30 April.\nThe Carrier Strike Force with carriers \"Zuikaku\" and \"Sh\u014dkaku\", two heavy cruisers, and six destroyers left from Truk on 1 May. The strike force was commanded by Vice Admiral Takeo Takagi (flag on cruiser ). Rear Admiral Ch\u016bichi Hara, on \"Zuikaku\", commanded the carrier air forces.\nThe Carrier Strike Force was to enter the Coral Sea south of Guadalcanal. Once in the Coral Sea, the carriers were to provide airplanes for the invasion forces, destroy Allied airplanes at Port Moresby, and destroy any Allied naval forces in the Coral Sea.\nTakagi's carriers were to deliver nine Zero fighter aircraft to Rabaul. Bad weather during two attempts to make the delivery made the aircraft to return to the carriers. One of the Zeros crashed in the ocean.\nTo find out if any Allied naval forces were coming, the Japanese sent submarines to wait southwest of Guadalcanal. Fletcher's forces got into the Coral Sea area before the submarines arrived and the Japanese did not see them. Another sub was sent to explore around Noum\u00e9a. It was attacked by \"Yorktown\" aircraft on 2 May.\nOn the morning of 1 May, Fletcher sent TF11 to refuel. TF\u00a017 completed refueling the next day. Fletcher took TF\u00a017 northwest towards the Louisiades and ordered TF\u00a011 to meet TF 44 on 4 May. TF\u00a044 was a joint Australia\u2013U.S. warship force under MacArthur's command. It was led by Australian Rear Admiral John Crace. It was made up of the cruisers , , and .\nTulagi.\nEarly on 3 May, Shima's force arrived off Tulagi and the naval troops began to occupy the island. Tulagi was undefended. The small guard of Australian commandos and a Royal Australian Air Force group left before Shima's arrival. The Japanese forces built a seaplane and communications base.\nAt 17:00 on 3 May, Fletcher was told that the Japanese Tulagi invasion force had been seen. TF\u00a017 went towards Guadalcanal to launch air attacks against the Japanese forces at Tulagi.\nOn 4 May, from a position south of Guadalcanal (), 60 aircraft from TF\u00a017 launched three attacks against Shima's forces off Tulagi. \"Yorktown\"s aircraft sank the destroyer \"Kikuzuki\" () and three of the minesweepers, damaged four other ships, and destroyed four seaplanes. The Americans lost one dive bomber and two fighters. Even though the Japanese forces were harmed by the carrier strikes, they kept building the seaplane base. They began flying from Tulagi by 6 May.\nTakagi's Carrier Striking Force was north of Tulagi when it learned of Fletcher's strike on 4 May. Takagi sent planes to search for the American carriers, but the planes found nothing.\nAir searches and decisions.\nAt 08:16 on 5 May, TF\u00a017 met up with TF\u00a011 and TF\u00a044 south of Guadalcanal. At the same time, four F4F Wildcat fighter aircraft from \"Yorktown\" shot down a Kawanishi Type 97 aircraft from the Yokohama Air Group.\nA message from Pearl Harbor told Fletcher that Japanese planned to land their troops at Port Moresby on 10 May and their carriers would be close to the invasion group. Fletcher planned to take his forces north towards the Louisiades.\nTakagi's carrier force entered the Coral Sea in the early morning hours of 6 May.\nOn 6 May, Fletcher joined TF\u00a011 and TF\u00a044 into TF\u00a017. He thought the Japanese carriers were still well to the north. American planes did not find the Japanese naval forces, because they were located beyond the planes' range.\nAt 10:00, a Kawanishi flying boat from Tulagi saw TF\u00a017 and sent a message to its headquarters. Takagi received the report at 10:50. At that time, Takagi's force was about north of Fletcher. Takagi's ships were still refueling, so he was not yet ready to battle. Takagi sent his two carriers with two destroyers under Hara's command to head towards TF\u00a017 at so that they could attack the next day.\nAmerican B-17 bombers based in Australia attacked the Port Moresby invasion forces, including Got\u014d's warships, several times on 6 May without success. MacArthur's headquarters told Fletcher about the locations of the Japanese invasion forces. MacArthur's planes saw a carrier (\"Sh\u014dh\u014d\") about northwest of TF17.\nAt 18:00, TF\u00a017 completed fueling and Fletcher sent \"Neosho\" with a destroyer, , to wait further south. TF\u00a017 then turned to head northwest towards Rossel Island. At 20:00 (), Hara met Takagi who completed refueling.\nLate on 6 May or early on 7 May, \"Kamikawa Maru\" set up a seaplane base in the Deboyne Islands to help the invasion forces as they approached Port Moresby. The rest of Marumo's Cover Force waited near the D'Entrecasteaux Islands.\nCarrier battle, first day.\nMorning strikes.\nAt 06:25 on 7 May, TF\u00a017 was south of Rossel Island (). At this time, Fletcher sent Crace's cruiser and destroyer force out. When Crace's warships left, this reduced the anti-aircraft defenses for Fletcher's carriers. Fletcher wanted to make sure the Japanese invasion forces could not sneak through to Port Moresby while he was fighting with the Japanese carriers.\nFletcher thought Takagi's carrier force was north of his location. Fletcher told \"Yorktown\" to send 10 SBD dive bombers to search that area. Takagi launched 12 Type 97 carrier bombers at 06:00 to search for TF\u00a017. Hara thought that Fletcher's ships were to the south. Got\u014d's cruisers and launched four Kawanishi E7K2 Type 94 floatplanes to search for the Americans. Each side got its carrier attack aircraft ready to launch once the enemy was located.\nAt 07:22 one of Takagi's carrier planes, from \"Sh\u014dkaku\" located American ships. At 07:45, the Japanese pilot located \"one carrier, one cruiser, and three destroyers\". Hara thought that he had found the American carriers. Hara launched all of his available aircraft. A total of 78 aircraft\u201418 Zero fighters, 36 Type 99 dive bombers, and 24 torpedo aircraft\u2014began flying from \"Sh\u014dkaku\" and \"Zuikaku\" at 08:00.\nAt 08:20, one aircraft found Fletcher's carriers. Takagi and Hara continued with the attack on the ships to their south. They also turned their carriers towards the northwest to get closer to the Americans. Takagi and Hara thought that the U.S. carrier forces might be operating in two groups.\nAt 08:15, a \"Yorktown\" plane saw Got\u014d's force. He reported two carriers and four heavy cruisers\" at , northwest of TF17. Fletcher thought he had found the Japanese main carrier force. He ordered all available carrier aircraft to attack. By 10:13, the American force of 93 aircraft \u2013 18 F4F Wildcats, 53 SBD dive bombers, and 22 TBD Devastator torpedo bombers were flying. At 10:12, however, Fletcher received a report from three United States Army B-17s of an aircraft carrier, ten transports, and 16 warships.\nBelieving that this was the main Japanese carrier force, Fletcher directed the airplanes towards this target.\nAt 09:15, Takagi's force sighted \"Neosho\" and \"Sims\". Takagi now realized the American carriers were between him and the invasion forces. Takagi ordered his aircraft to attack \"Neosho\" and \"Sims\". At 11:15, the 36 dive bombers attacked the two American ships.\nFour dive bombers attacked \"Sims\" and the rest attacked \"Neosho\". The destroyer was hit by three bombs, broke in half, and sank, killing all but 14 of her 192-man crew. \"Neosho\" was hit by seven bombs. Heavily damaged and without power, \"Neosho\" was sinking. \"Neosho\" told Fletcher by radio that she was under attack.\nThe American aircraft sighted \"Sh\u014dh\u014d\" at 10:40 and attacked. The Japanese carrier was protected by six Zeros and two Type 96 'Claude' fighters flying combat air patrol (CAP). Got\u014d's cruisers surrounded the carrier.\nAttacking first, \"Lexington\"s air group hit \"Sh\u014dh\u014d\" with two bombs and five torpedoes, causing severe damage. At 11:00, \"Yorktown\"s air group attacked the burning carrier with 11 more bombs and two torpedoes. Torn apart, \"Sh\u014dh\u014d\" sank at 11:35 (). Got\u014d sent his warships to the north, but sent the destroyer to rescue survivors. Only 203 of the carrier's 834-man crew were rescued. Three American aircraft were lost in the attack. All of \"Sh\u014dh\u014d\"s aircraft were lost. At 12:10, a pilot told TF\u00a017 that the attack was successful.\nAfternoon operations.\nThe American aircraft returned and landed on their carriers by 13:38. By 14:20, the aircraft ready to launch against the Port Moresby Invasion Force or Got\u014d's cruisers. Fletcher was worried that he did not know where the other Japanese fleet carriers were. Allied forces thought that up to four Japanese carriers might be nearby. Fletcher turned TF17 southwest.\nWhen Inoue was told that \"Sh\u014dh\u014d\" had been sunk, he ordered the invasion convoy to pull back to the north. He ordered Takagi to destroy the American carrier forces. As the invasion convoy pulled back, it was bombed by eight U.S. Army B-17s, but was not damaged. Got\u014d and Kajioka were told to place their ships south of Rossel Island for a night battle if the American ships got close enough.\nAt 12:40, a seaplane saw Crace's force. At 13:15, an aircraft from Rabaul saw Crace's force. Takagi turned his carriers west at 13:30 and told Inoue at 15:00 that the US carriers were too far away to attack them that day.\nInoue's men sent attack aircraft from Rabaul towards Crace. The first group included 12 torpedo-armed Type 1 bombers and the second group was 19 Mitsubishi Type 96 aircraft armed with bombs. Both groups found and attacked Crace's ships at 14:30. Crace's ships were undamaged and shot down four Type 1s. A short time later, three U.S. Army B-17s bombed Crace by accident, but caused no damage.\nCrace radioed Fletcher that he could not complete his mission without airplanes. Crace moved southward. Crace's ships were low on fuel.\nTakagi's staff thought that the Allied ships would be close enough to attack before nightfall. Takagi and Hara decided to attack with aircraft, even though they would have to return after dark.\nTo try to confirm the location of the American carriers, at 15:15 Hara eight torpedo bombers to look westward. The dive bombers returned from their attack on \"Neosho\" and landed. At 16:15 Hara launched 12 dive bombers and 15 torpedo planes with orders to try to find the American ships.\nAt 17:47, TF\u00a017 detected the Japanese forces on radar heading in their direction. The Americans sent 11 CAP Wildcats to attack the Japanese planes. The Wildcats shot down seven torpedo bombers and one dive bomber, and heavily damaged another torpedo bomber. Three Wildcats were lost.\nThe Japanese leaders canceled the mission and returned to their carriers. The sun set at 18:30. Several of the Japanese dive bombers found the American carriers in the darkness and tried to land on them. Anti-aircraft fire from TF\u00a017's destroyers sent them away. By 20:00, TF\u00a017 and Takagi were about apart. Takagi turned on his ships' searchlights to help the 18 surviving aircraft get back.\nAt 15:18 and 17:18 \"Neosho\" radioed TF\u00a017 that she was sinking. Fletcher knew his only nearby fuel supply was gone.\nAs nightfall ended aircraft flights for the day, Fletcher ordered TF\u00a017 to head west. Crace also turned west. Inoue told Takagi to destroy the U.S. carriers the next day. He delayed the Port Moresby landings to 12 May. Takagi took his carriers north during the night to protect the invasion convoy. Got\u014d and Kajioka were unable to attack the Allied warships at night.\nBoth sides spent the night preparing their aircraft for the battle. In 1972, U.S. Vice Admiral H. S. Duckworth said Coral Sea was the most confused battle area in world history.\" Hara said he was so frustrated with the \"poor luck\" the Japanese had on 7 May that he felt like quitting the navy.\nCarrier battle, second day.\nAttack on the Japanese carriers.\nAt 06:15 on 8 May, Hara launched seven torpedo bombers to search the area south from the Japanese carriers. Three Kawanishi Type 97s from Tulagi and four Type 1 bombers from Rabaul also helped in the search. At 07:00, the carrier force turned to the southwest and was joined by two of Got\u014d's cruisers, and . The invasion convoy, Got\u014d, and Kajioka moved east of Woodlark Island.\nAt 06:35, TF\u00a017 launched 18 SBDs to search for Japanese ships. The skies over the American carriers were mostly clear.\nAt 08:20, a \"Lexington\" SBD spotted the Japanese carriers and told TF\u00a017. Two minutes later, a \"Sh\u014dkaku\" plane saw TF\u00a017 and told Hara. The two forces were about away from each other. Both sides got ready to launch their aircraft.\nAt 09:15, the Japanese carriers launched 18 fighters, 33 dive bombers, and 18 torpedo planes. The American carriers each launched a separate attack. \"Yorktown\"s group consisted of six fighters, 24 dive bombers, and nine torpedo planes. \"Lexington\"s group was made up of nine fighters, 15 dive bombers, and 12 torpedo planes. Both the American and Japanese carrier forces turned to head directly for each other.\n\"Yorktown\"s dive bombers reached the Japanese carriers at 10:32. At this time, \"Sh\u014dkaku\" and \"Zuikaku\" were about apart, with \"Zuikaku\" hidden under clouds. The two carriers were protected by 16 CAP Zero fighters. The \"Yorktown\" dive bombers attacked at 10:57 on \"Sh\u014dkaku\" and hit the carrier with two bombs, causing heavy damage to the carrier's flight and hangar decks. The \"Yorktown\" torpedo planes missed with all of their torpedoes. Two U.S. dive bombers and two CAP Zeros were shot down during the attack.\n\"Lexington\"s aircraft arrived and attacked at 11:30. Two dive bombers attacked \"Sh\u014dkaku\", hitting the carrier with one bomb, causing further damage. Two other dive bombers attacked \"Zuikaku\", missing with their bombs. The rest of \"Lexington\"s dive bombers were unable to find the Japanese carriers in the heavy clouds. \"Lexington\"s TBDs missed \"Sh\u014dkaku\" with all 11 of their torpedoes. The 13 CAP Zeros on patrol shot down three Wildcats.\nWith her flight deck heavily damaged and 223 of her crew killed or wounded, \"Sh\u014dkaku\" was unable to launch any more planes. At 12:10, \"Sh\u014dkaku\" and two destroyers pulled back to the northeast.\nAttack on the U.S. carriers.\nAt 10:55, \"Lexington\"s radar detected the Japanese aircraft and sent nine Wildcats to attack the planes. Six of the Wildcats were too low, and they missed the Japanese aircraft as they passed by overhead. Because of the heavy losses in aircraft the night before, the Japanese could not do a full torpedo attack on both carriers. The Japanese sent 14 torpedo planes to attack \"Lexington\" and four to attack \"Yorktown\". A Wildcat shot down one and 8 \"Yorktown\" SBDs destroyed three. Four SBDs were shot down by Zeros escorting the torpedo planes.\nThe Japanese attack began at 11:13 as the carriers, stationed apart, fired with anti-aircraft guns. The four torpedo planes which attacked \"Yorktown\" all missed. The remaining torpedo planes hit \"Lexington\" with two Type 91 torpedoes. The first torpedo broke the aviation gasoline tanks. The second torpedo caused several of the boilers to stop working. Four of the Japanese torpedo planes were shot down by anti-aircraft fire.\nThe 33 Japanese dive bombers attacked after the torpedo attacks. The 19 \"Sh\u014dkaku\" dive bombers attacked \"Lexington\" while the remaining 14, attacked \"Yorktown\". Zeros protected the dive bombers from four \"Lexington\" CAP Wildcats. Takahashi's bombers damaged \"Lexington\" with two bomb hits, causing fires which were put out by 12:33. At 11:27, \"Yorktown\" was hit in the center of her flight deck by a single , semi-armor-piercing bomb which penetrated four decks before exploding, causing severe damage and killing or seriously wounding 66 men. Up to 12 near misses damaged \"Yorktown\"s hull below the waterline. Two of the dive bombers were shot down by a CAP Wildcat during the attack.\nAs the Japanese aircraft completed their attacks and began to fly back, they were attacked by US planes.\nRecovery, reassessment, and retreat.\nThe planes, with many damaged aircraft, landed on their carriers between 12:50 and 14:30. \"Yorktown\" and \"Lexington\" were both able to land planes. Forty-six of the original 69 aircraft from the Japanese force returned. Three more Zeros, four dive bombers, and five torpedo planes were damaged beyond repair and were pushed into the ocean.\nAs TF\u00a017 got its aircraft back, Fletcher thought about the situation. Fletcher knew both his carriers were hurt and that he had lost a lot of fighters. Fuel was also a problem due to the loss of \"Neosho\". At 14:22, Fitch told Fletcher that there were two undamaged Japanese carriers. Fletcher pulled TF17 out from the battle. Fletcher radioed MacArthur the position of the Japanese carriers and suggested that he attack them with bombers.\nAround 14:30, Hara informed Takagi that only 24 Zeros, eight dive bombers, and four torpedo planes from the carriers were working. Takagi was worried about his ships' fuel levels; his cruisers were at 50% and some of his destroyers were as low as 20%. At 15:00 Takagi said he had sunk two American carriers \u2013 \"Yorktown\" and a \"-class\". Inoue called the invasion convoy to Rabaul, postponed \"MO\" to 3 July, and ordered his forces to gather northeast of the Solomons to begin the \"RY\" operation.\n\"Zuikaku\" and her escorts turned towards Rabaul while \"Sh\u014dkaku\" headed for Japan.\nAboard \"Lexington\", an explosion killed 25 men and started a large fire. Around 14:42, another large explosion occurred, starting a second fire. A third explosion occurred at 15:25. \"Lexington\"s crew began abandoning ship at 17:07. After the carrier's survivors were rescued, including Fitch and the carrier's captain, Frederick C. Sherman, at 19:15 the destroyer fired five torpedoes into the burning ship, which sank in 2,400\u00a0fathoms at 19:52 ().\nTwo hundred and sixteen of the carrier's 2,951-man crew sunk with the ship, along with 36 aircraft. \"Phelps\" and the other warships left to rejoin \"Yorktown\", which departed at 16:01, and TF17 moved to the southwest. Later that evening, MacArthur informed Fletcher that eight of his B-17s had attacked the invasion convoy and that it was moving to the northwest.\nThat evening, Crace sent \"Hobart\", which was low on fuel, and the destroyer , which was having engine trouble, to Townsville. Crace remained on patrol in the Coral Sea in case the Japanese invasion force tried to go towards Port Moresby.\nSignificance.\nA new type of naval war.\nThe battle was the first naval battle in history in which the ships never saw or fired directly at each other. Instead, aircraft were used to attack each other.\nThis was a carrier-versus-carrier battle. Neither commander had experience with this. The commanders had poor communications. This was hard, because the battle took place over a large area. The planes flew so fast that it meant there was not much time to make decisions.\nThe Japanese had problems because Inoue was too far away at Rabaul to direct his naval forces. Fletcher was on a carrier, so it was easier for him to direct his forces. The Japanese admirals did not share information quickly.\nThe experienced Japanese carrier aircrews did better than those of the U.S. The Japanese aircrews did more damage with the same number of aircraft. The Japanese attack on the American carriers on 8 May was better organized than the U.S. attack on the Japanese carriers.\nThe Japanese had much higher losses to their carrier aircrews. They lost ninety aircrew killed in the battle compared with thirty-five for the Americans. Japan's highly skilled carrier aircrews could not be replaced because the training programs could not produce enough new aircrew. There were not training programs to produce skilled pilots. Coral Sea was the start of Japan losing its experienced aircrews.\nThe Americans did learn from their mistakes in the battle. They made improvements to their carrier fighting approach. The Americans improved their anti-aircraft defences. Radar gave the Americans an advantage in this battle.\nFollowing the loss of \"Lexington\", improved methods for carrying airplane fuel and better ways of dealing with damage were developed by the Americans. Coordination between the Allied land-based air forces and the U.S. Navy was poor during this battle.\nJapanese and U.S. carriers would fight again in the battles of Midway, the Eastern Solomons, and the Santa Cruz Islands in 1942, and the Philippine Sea in 1944. Each of these battles had an impact on what would happen in the Pacific War.\nTactical and strategic implications.\nBoth sides claimed victory after the battle. In terms of ships lost, the Japanese won a victory by sinking an American fleet carrier, an oiler, and a destroyer \u2013 . The Americans sunk a light carrier, a destroyer, and several smaller warships \u2013 . \"Lexington\" was one quarter of U.S. carrier strength in the Pacific. The Japanese public was told it was a victory.\nThe Allies won because the sea invasion of Port Moresby was stopped. This meant that supply lines between the U.S. and Australia were protected. Although pulling \"Yorktown\" away from the Coral Sea was like giving the sea area to the Japanese, the Japanese stopped their invasion plans.\nThe battle was the first time that a Japanese invasion force was stopped. This improved the morale of the Allies. The Allies had been defeated by the Japanese during the first six months of the Pacific War.\nPort Moresby was important to the Allies. The US Navy said that the damage it did to the Japanese was greater than what it really did.\nThe battle affected the planning of both sides. Without in New Guinea, the Allied advance would have been more difficult. For the Japanese, the battle was seen as a problem. The battle showed the Japanese that American were not that good in battle. The Japanese thought that future carrier attacks against the U.S. would be successful.\nMidway.\nOne of the most important effects of the Coral Sea battle was the loss of and .\nYamamoto wanted to use these carriers to battle American carriers at Midway (\"Sh\u014dh\u014d\" was supposed to support the Japanese invasion ground forces). The Japanese thought that they sank two carriers in the Coral Sea, but this still left at least two more U.S. Navy carriers, \"Enterprise\" and \"Hornet\", which could fight at Midway.\nAmerican carriers had more planes than Japanese carriers. The US also had land-based aircraft at Midway. This meant that the Japanese did not have more planes at Midway. The Americans would have three carriers at Midway, because \"Yorktown\" could still sail, even with the damage from Coral Sea. The U.S. Navy was able to repair Yorktown at Pearl Harbor between 27 and 30 May so that she could fight in the battle.\nAt Midway, 's aircraft were important in sinking two Japanese carriers. \"Yorktown\" also took a lot of the Japanese air attacks at Midway which would have been directed at the other American carriers.\nThe Americans worked hard to get the maximum number of forces for Midway. The Japanese did not try to include \"Zuikaku\" in the operation. The Japanese did not try to put the \"Sh\u014dkaku\" aircrews with \"Zuikaku\"s air groups or provide \"Zuikaku\" with new aircraft. \"Sh\u014dkaku\" had a damaged flight deck which required three months of repair in Japan.\nHistorians H. P. Willmott, Jonathan Parshall, and Anthony Tully think Yamamoto made an error in deciding support the \"MO\". Since Yamamoto thought the big battle with the Americans would be at Midway, he should not have sent fleet carriers to less important battle like \"MO\". Japanese naval forces were weakened at both the Coral Sea and Midway battles, which allowed the Allies to defeat them.\nYamamoto did not notice another thing about the Coral Sea battle. The Americans put their carriers the right place and time to fight the Japanese. U.S. Navy carrier aircrews showed skill and tried to do major damage to the Japanese carrier forces. Japan lost four fleet carriers at Midway, which made Japan start to lose the Pacific War.\nSituation in the South Pacific.\nThe Australians and U.S. forces in Australia were disappointed with the Battle of the Coral Sea. They thought that the \"MO\" operation was going to lead to an invasion of the Australian mainland. In a meeting held in late May, the Australian Advisory War Council said the battle was disappointing since the Allies knew about the Japanese plans.\nGeneral MacArthur told Australian Prime Minister John Curtin that Japanese forces could attack anywhere if supported by the IJN.\nBecause of the losses in carriers at Midway, the Japanese were unable to invade Port Moresby from the sea. Japan tried to capture Port Moresby by land. Japan began its attack towards Port Moresby along the Kokoda Track on 21 July from Buna and Gona.\nBy then, the Allies sent more troops to New Guinea. The added forces slowed and stopped the Japanese advance towards Port Moresby in September 1942. They also stopped the Japanese from capturing an Allied base at Milne Bay.\nThe Allies tried their to use their victories at Coral Sea and Midway to try to win the war against Japan. The Allies chose Tulagi and Guadalcanal as their first attacks.\nThe failure of the Japanese to take Port Moresby, and their defeat at Midway, meant Tulagi was not protected by other Japanese bases. Tulagi was four hours flying time from Rabaul, the nearest large Japanese base.\nOn 7 August 1942, 11,000 U.S. Marines landed on Guadalcanal and 3,000 U.S. Marines landed on Tulagi and nearby islands. The Japanese troops on Tulagi and nearby islands killed in the Battle of Tulagi and Gavutu-Tanambogo. The U.S. Marines on Guadalcanal captured an airfield under construction by the Japanese.\nThis started the Guadalcanal and Solomon Islands Campaigns. These resulted in a number of battles between Allied and Japanese forces over the next year. Along with the New Guinea campaign, this destroyed Japanese defences, caused huge losses for the Japanese military\u2014especially the Navy. This helped the Allies to win the war against Japan.\nThe delay in the advance of Japanese forces also allowed the United States Marine Corps to land on Funafuti on October 2, 1942. The US built airfields from which USAAF B-24 \"Liberator\" bombers could fly. The atolls of Tuvalu were places the Allies could use to get ready for the Battle of Tarawa and the Battle of Makin that started on 20 November 1943."}

His 1969 collection of essays, \"Freedom to Learn\", was influential for a young generation in the late 1960s and through the 1970s. Rebellions against college teaching methods, the deschooling movement, flower power and the alternative society often referred to Roger's ideas in their various pamphlets. Rogers is regarded as the second most influential therapist (clinical psychologist) of the 20th century (behind Freud).\nBiography.\nRogers was born and raised in Oak Park, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. His parents were Walter Rogers and Julia Cushing. He was the fourth of six children. Rogers was educated in a strict, religious environment. He was first interested in studying agriculture at the University of Wisconsin-Madison with a focus on history and religion. His interest changed from agriculture to religion. He received a bachelor's degree in 1924. After that, he entered a liberal Protestant seminary in New York City. That went against the views of his conservative father. Rogers spent two years in seminary. He later transferred to Columbia University Teachers College, where he worked with John Dewey. Rogers received his master's degree in 1928. In 1931, he received a PhD in clinical psychology from Columbia University.\nAfter receiving his PhD, Rogers worked at Ohio State University, the University of Chicago, and the University of Wisconsin. During that time, he developed what was later known as client-centered therapy. After his work at the University of Wisconsin, Rogers worked at the Western Behavioral Studies Institute in LaJolla, California. From there he and several other people formed the Center for Studies of the Person (CSP). He remained there until his death in 1987.\nLegacy.\nDuring the last ten years of his life, Rogers used his person-centered approach in a broader field of work. He used helping relationships in the resolution of inter-group and international conflict. He and his colleagues conducted many experiments in cross cultural communication and peacemaking in the Carl Rogers Peace Project. For this work, Rogers was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. The work is not widely known, but it puts Rogers' contributions into a wider social and political context."}

JFK had 49.3 million, and LaGuardia had 25.7 million.\nOn September 11, 2001, United Airlines Flight 93 left Newark on its way to San Francisco International Airport. Two hours later, it crashed into a field just outside of Shanksville, Pennsylvania, killing all crew members and passengers on the plane. The passengers had tried to take over the plane from a team of terrorists who took over it.

Ad hoc networks are easier to set up because an access point is not needed. This makes it similar to Bluetooth.\nLimitations.\nIt is suggested for each access point to only serve 15-25 client devices This depends on the number of devices in an area, the needed speed of data transfer, location and radio channels of the access point, obstacles and more. A repeater, which repeats the signal, can be used to reach farther places.\nThere are only a few radio channels for wireless networks.

One thing to do is stop people who are about to attempt suicide. Another way to stop people from attempting suicide is to treat the symptoms of depression, help people to cope during a time of crisis, reduce the issues that put people at risk of attempting suicide, and give people hope for a better future.\nSuicide is not just a medical or mental health issue. Making sure people have friends and family to help them and taking away dangerous items can also stop people from attempting suicide.\nIn the U.S., there is a National Strategy for Suicide Prevention. It was created by the Department of Health and Human Services in 2001. Suicide prevention activities include messages aimed at people and messages for everyone in the community.\nNational strategies.\nIn 2001, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services created a National Strategy for Suicide Prevention. The document looks at how suicide can be stopped in the community. The strategy does not say how to help individual people. The document has the following goals:\nSpecific strategies.\nTo help stop people from attempting suicide, many methods have been used:\nIt has also been suggested that news media can help prevent suicide by linking suicide with negative results, such as pain for the pain felt by the family.\nInterventions.\nMany methods of stopping suicide exist. These include talking to the person, looking for risks, and making it harder for people to get dangerous items.\nDirect talks.\nThe World Health Organization says a good way to help people who are suicidal is to talk to them. The person can also be asked about depression, and if they plan to attempt suicide. Talking with people about suicide does not create suicidal thoughts. The doctor has to show concern and compassion. Doctors should try to reduce sadness and let the person know that people care. The WHO says not to not say everything will be all right. However, some people who have talked about suicide have attempted it. This means that doctors need to make sure the person is comfortable talking about his or her feelings.\nScreening.\nThe U.S. Surgeon General says there are ways to find out which people are at risk of suicide. This may be the best way to stop children and adolescents from attempting suicide.\nThere are tools like questionnaires to help doctors to know who is at risk. One example is the Beck Hopelessness Scale. These questionnaires are good for finding adolescents and young adults who might want to attempt suicide. Doctors should interview people who seem to be at risk. Questionnaires may not always tell doctors which person will attempt suicide Asking about suicide does not increase the risk.\nIn approximately 75 percent of suicides, the people had seen a doctor in the last year. About 45 to 66 percent of people saw a doctor the month they committed suicide. About 33 to 41 percent of those who committed suicide had used mental health services in the prior year. About 20 percent used mental health services in the month before they committed suicide. This shows that doctors need to get better at knowing which people will attempt suicide.\nLethal means reduction.\nMaking it hard for people to get dangerous things is an important part of suicide prevention. Making it hard for people to get dangerous items can lead to less suicides. Putting up fences at bridges and cliffs reduces suicides. Putting up signs or increasing patrols is not so helpful One example of making dangerous items less available is coal gas in the United Kingdom. Until the 1950s, the most common way of committing suicide in the UK was poisoning by inhaling coal gas. In 1958, natural gas was used instead. Natural gas is much less dangerous. So less people committed suicide.\nIn the United States,studies show that firearms increase suicide risk. Because guns are quick and more dangerous than other suicide method, they lead to more suicides.\nTreatment.\nTreatments to reduce the risk of suicide can include medical approaches, prescription medicine, and talk therapy.\nAbout 10% of people with psychiatric problems may have a medical condition that the doctor does not know about which is causing their symptoms. About 50% may have a medical condition that the doctor does not know about which is making their symptoms worse. Illegal drugs and prescribed medications may also cause problems. Treating medical conditions may reduce the risk of suicidal ideas.\nRecent research shows that lithium lowers the risk of suicide for people with bipolar disorder.\n Lithium also lowers the suicide risk in those with regular depression.\nTalk therapy can reduce suicidal ideas such as Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT). Benefits include a reduction in self-harm behaviour and suicidal ideas. Cognitive Behavior Therapy for Suicide Prevention (CBT-SP) helps adolescents at high risk of suicide attempts.\nRespect and self-esteem.\nThe World Health Organization states that \"worldwide, suicide is among the top five causes of mortality in the 15- to 19-year age group. In many countries it ranks first or second as a cause of death among both boys and girls in this age group\". The organization says teens need help with difficult and stressful life situations.\" It also says that teachers need to prevent bullying and violence at schools.\nSupport groups.\nMany non-profit organizations exist that try to prevent suicide. Examples include the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention in the United States, which provide crisis hotlines. In addition, some groups such as To Write Love on Her Arms use social media to reach more people."}

Linehan, a psychology researcher at the University of Washington. Linehan originally developed DBT to help people with borderline personality disorder (BPD).\nDBT uses cognitive-behavioral techniques to get patients to control their emotions and test what reality is. It also tests the patient's tolerance for distress, and tries to get them to accept their situation and be aware of their feelings.\nLinehan's ideas about how to be aware of your feelings come from Buddhist meditation. DBT may be the first therapy that has been shown to be effective in treating BPD. It can also help patients with spectrum mood problems, including self-injury. DBT may help victims of sexual abuse and people addicted to drugs.\nHistory.\nIn the early 1990\u2019s, Dr. Marsha Linehan developed an alternative therapy to treat her borderline personality disorder patients. Instead of having a one-way conversation with the patient, the therapist would engage him through the use of real world examples to elicit the desired responses. One by one, Linehan was able to teach her patients how to react differently in a variety of situations. This process removes the obstacles to treatment that had confused therapists treating suicidal patients. In a recent study, DBT has proven especially effective in reducing self-injurious behavior, suicide attempts and inpatient treatment days.\nDBT has also been used to treat alcohol addiction and drug addiction."}

At the time of the Roman conquest of Britain, it was a part of the territory of the Corieltauvi tribe. Lindsey appears in the 7th century list called the Tribal Hidage, where it is shown to be the same size as Essex and Sussex, all of which were set at 7,000 hides. It was a lesser Anglo-Saxon kingdom which was disputed over by Northumbria and Mercia. It ceased to exist as an independent kingdom during the reign of Offa of Mercia.\nGeography.\nLindsey was between the River Humber on the north and the Witham on the south. To the east lay the North Sea and the west border was the River Trent. The Roman canal called Foss Dyke connected the Witham with the Trent on the southwestern border. Also to the west was Hatfield Chase, a low lying area of marshes. This meant Lindsey was completely surrounded by water. This led to the popular belief that Lindsey was an Island.\nHistory.\nThe name Lindsey comes from the word \"Lindissi\" (also spelled \"Lindesse\" and \"Lindesig\"). Lindsey is a British name and not an Old English (or the Anglo-Saxon language) name. Lindsey was an Anglo-Saxon kingdom but it had a strong Celtic population. Lindsey seems to have been an independent kingdom with its own Celtic rulers for a time. It came under the control of Northumbria from \u2013658. Then it was subject to Mercia from \u2013. It returned to Northumbrian control again from \u2013679. In 679 it was taken over by Mercia. Its kings were reduced in rank to Ealdormen.\nThe conversion to Christianity in Lindsey began by Paulinus. Bishop Wilfrid was appointed the bishop of Northumbria, which included Lindsey, in 665. After a delay, he was installed as bishop in 669. When he was expelled from Northumbria in 678, his diocese was divided up. Archbishop Theodore formed Lindsey into a separate diocese with its own bishop. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, in the year 678 Eadhed was the first bishop of Lindsey. In the 9th century, the Danes (Vikings) colonized Lindsey. This marked the end of the diocese of Lindsey.\nHatfield.\n\"Haethfieldlande\" or Hatfield was another minor Anglo-Saxon kingdom listed in the Tribal Hidage. Very little is known about Hatfield and nothing of its kings. Unlike other petty kingdoms in this area of Britain, the name here is of Anglo-Saxon origin and not British. According to the Tribal Hidage, 'Hatfield-land' was merged with Lindsey into a single kingdom. Afterwards it became known simply as Hatfield Chase, an area on the west part of Lindsey, later part of Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. Hatfield was the site of a synod held by Theodore, the Archbishop of Canterbury . It was a royal residence of several kings of Northumbria. Edwin of Northumbria was killed here at the Battle of Hatfield Chase on 12 October 633. Later, Hatfield became a part of the East Riding of Yorkshire.\nAnglian kings of Lindsey.\nThe Anglian collection is a collection of royal genealogies and regnal lists. It was put together during the reign of Alhred of Northumbria (765-774). It records the kings of Deira and Bernicia (which became Northumberland), Mercia, Lindsey, Kent, East Anglia and Wessex. These genealogies all trace back to Woden. The most trustworthy name in the Lindsey genealogy is Caedbaed, according to most modern historians. The family of Aldfri\u00f0 is also considered fairly certain. The other names are simply from the list with little or no additional information. The list of kings of Lindsey begins with:\nNone of dates are certain. With regard to Aldfrith, the witness list for an Anglo-Saxon charter includes an \"Ealfrid rex\". This dates to some time between 787 and 796."}

{"id": "425809", "revid": "1100286", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=425809", "title": "Social cognitive theory", "text": "Social cognitive theory emphasizes how cognitive, behavioral, personal, and environmental factors interact to determine motivation and behavior. Social cognitive theory was presented by Albert Bandura in response to his dissatisfaction with the principles of behaviorism and psychoanalysis. His research is primarily focused on self-efficacy, the beliefs regarding one's capabilities of completing tasks or goals successfully.\nAlbert Bandura.\nAlbert Bandura (born December 4, 1925) is a psychologist who did work on social learning. He is credited for \"social learning theory\". This theory was renamed \"social cognitive theory\".\nHis theory defines human behavior as a three-way, dynamic, and reciprocal interaction of personal factors, behavior, and the environment. According to this theory, the behavior of an individual is determined by three factors with more emphasis on the cognitive processes that mediate learning. Response consequences of a behavior are used as expectations of behavioral outcomes. It is the ability to form these expectations that give humans the capacity to predict the outcomes of their behavior, before the behavior is performed. In addition, the social cognitive theory posits that most behavior is learned vicariously. Bandura's social cognitive theory suggests that humans can learn through observation without imitating the observed behavior. Bandura is also credited with the theoretical construct of self-efficacy and is responsible for the research in the influential 1961 Bobo doll experiment.\nExplanation.\nSocial cognitive theory explains psychosocial functioning in terms of triadic reciprocal causation. In this causal model, behavior, personal factors and the environment operate as interacting determinants that influence each other bi-directionally. Bandura deemed that individuals can learn through observing others without the need for imitating such behavior. With vicarious learning capabilities, an individual could learn through observing others' behaviors and the rewards or consequences of those behaviors. The bi-directional influences of this causal model results in the remarkable intercultural and intracultural diversity evident in our planet. Social cognitive theory calls to mind that learning occurs when an individual takes the observed behavior and incorporates it into their own knowledge.\nHuman influences.\nSocial cognitive theory suggests people are neither driven by global traits nor automatically shaped and controlled by the environment. They serve as contributors to their own motivation, behavior, and development within a network of reciprocally interacting influences.\nBehavioral interactions.\nThe social cognitive theory explains behavior in terms of a three-way interaction between the environment, personal factors, and behavior. It does not imply that one factor may be stronger than others. They do not all occur simultaneously. Bandura states that the interaction between the three factors will differ based on the individual, the particular behavior being examined, and the specific situation in which the behavior occurs.\nThe person-behavior interaction involves the bi-directional influences of one's thoughts, emotions, and biological properties and one's actions. A person's expectations, beliefs, self-perceptions, goals, and intentions give shape and direction to behavior. The behavior expressed will affect one's thoughts and emotions. The social cognitive theory accounts for biological personal factors, such as sex, ethnicity, temperament, and genetic predisposition and the influences they have on behavior.\nIn addition, a two-way interaction occurs between the environment and personal characteristics. Human expectations, beliefs, and cognitive competencies are developed and modified by social influences and physical structures within the environment. The social factors can express information and trigger emotional reactions through modeling, instruction, and social persuasion. Humans evoke different reactions from their social environment as a result of their physical characteristics, such as age, size, race, sex, physical attractiveness.\nThe final interplay takes place between behavior and the environment. Bandura argues that people are both products and producers of their environment. A person's behavior will determine the aspects of their environment to which they are exposed. The behavior is modified by that environment. An individual's behavior can affect the way in which they experience the environment through selective attention. Selective attention refers to the vast range of possibilities of how humans select whom they interact with and the activities they participate in. The environment partly determines which forms of one's behavior are developed and activated.\nSocial learning.\nObservational or \"social\" learning is regulated by four component process, which results in a person translating a modeled event into a performance that is matched with the model. According to Bandura, a model can be either an actual person or symbolic, such as a book, a picture, or a set of instructions. The process consists of four variables: \"attention\", \"retention\", \"behavior production\", and \"motivation\". Each of these components has a function to engage either in the attainment of information about events or in the decision to put this information to use in guiding behavior.\nSelf-efficacy.\nPsychologists use the term \"self-efficacy\" to describe beliefs about one's ability to accomplish particular tasks. Individuals with higher self-efficacy are more confident in their abilities to accomplish a given task. It is often associated with greater decision making strategies, quick recovery from a setback, and a stronger sense of commitment to their interests and activities. According to Bandura, there are four major sources of self-efficacy:\nBandura explains that the most effective way of developing a strong sense of self-efficacy is through \"mastery experiences\". Successfully completing a task strengthens our sense of self-efficacy. However, failing to adequately complete a challenge can undermine and weaken self-efficacy. \"Social modeling\" is the act of witnessing other people successfully completing a task. The second influential way of creating and strengthening self-efficacy beliefs is through \"vicarious experiences\" provided by social models. Bandura suggests that watching people similar to oneself succeed with sustained effort raises the observers' beliefs that they also have the ability to master similar activities to succeed.\nOther sources of influence.\nIn addition, research shows that social comparison of one's own performance to the performance of others, especially peers or siblings, serve as a strong source of self-efficacy. Schools are also considered a strong source of self-efficacy. It is good to note that schools are based on the evaluation of students by comparing individual performance to the group's performance. However, this type of evaluation can result in severe problems in self-efficacy for those who lag behind or have trouble with academics.\nMass media.\nTelevision reality shows can manipulate abstract portrayals of human nature, social relations, and the norms and the structure of society. Social cognitive theory states that humans can learn by observing how other people behave. In research about mass media, the social cognitive theory is referenced as a framework that might explain certain behaviors and influences from media effects. Bandura suggests that television influences the viewers' beliefs about reality. It is not because people watch too much television but rather the content of the televised show. To see the world as the televised messages portray it is to harbor some misconceptions. New behaviors and their potential consequences can be represented, observed and imitated because of the influences of television or the internet.\nIn one study, researchers argued that the positive correlation between television viewing and the initiation of youth smoking was a result of the rarity with which television portrays the negative consequences of smoking. In another study, researchers theorized that the positive relationship between exposure to women's magazine and women's drive for thinness is a function of the tendency for women's magazines to link thinness to positive consequences, thus engendering extrinsic motivation for dietary behavior. There are also studies that reference social cognitive theory to explain the possible effects of mass media regarding race and gender. Though these studies did not test social cognitive theory directly, but instead drew from its concepts to assume how it would explain the effect acknowledged in their study.\nMotivation using goals.\nSocial cognitive theory suggests goals influence people's cognitive and emotional reactions to performance outcomes because goals indicate the requirements for personal success. People have created guides and motivators for activities that lead to their desired outcome. Bandura found that goal systems gain motivating power through self-evaluative and self-efficacy mechanisms that are activated by cognitive comparison. It can improve an individual's cognitive well-being and accomplishments in several ways.\nGoals have strong motivational effects. They provide an individual with a sense of direction and purpose. They also help to build an individual's self-efficacy. Successfully completing a goal increases an individual's self-beliefs in their capabilities. Bandura links this effect with the increase interest in what an individual is doing and the increase in self-satisfaction. Motivation through goals provide an ongoing source of self-efficacy, interest, and satisfaction. Those without these characteristics are often unmotivated and uncertain about their abilities."}

These demonstrations were like demonstrations held in other Arab countries, which has been called the Arab Spring. Protesters in Syria demanded that President Bashar al-Assad resign. His family has held the presidency in Syria since 1971. Many of Assad's supporters are Shia while most of the opposition is Sunni. \nIn April 2011, the Syrian Army fired on demonstrators across the country. After months of military battles, the protests turned into an armed rebellion. Opposition forces were soldiers who had left the Syrian army and civilian volunteers. Opposition fighters had no central leadership. Battles took place in many towns and cities across the country. In late 2011 the Islamist group al-Nusra Front began to have a bigger role in the forces. In 2013 Hezbollah entered the war in support of the Syrian army. \nThe Syrian government received military support from Russia and Iran. Qatar and Saudi Arabia gave weapons to the rebels. By July 2013, the Syrian government controlled approximately 30\u201340 percent of the country's territory and 60 percent of the Syrian population. A 2012 UN report said the battles were between different sects or groups. The battles were between Shia groups against Sunni rebel groups.\nAccording to the United Nations, over 100,000 people were killed by June 2013. A total of 120,000 were killed by September 2013. In addition, tens of thousands of protesters were put in jail. There were reports that the Syrian government was torturing prisoners. International organizations accused both government and opposition forces of breaching human rights. The UN said most of the abuses were carried out by the Syrian government. More than 4 million Syrians were forced to relocate because of the battles and more than 2 million refugees left their country. Millions of citizens are still short of electricity, food and drinking water.\nIn 2013 the Syrian regime used Chemical weapons against the rebels. This drew attention from the international community. The government reportedly surrendered their chemical weapons in 2014 but continued the war using other weapons. Later in 2014, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant became the most powerful opposing army, controlling more territory than the Syrian government itself. By 2019 government forces had take back most of this territory.\nWith all of this going on in Syria, 5.6 million Syrians were forced to flee to other countries.\nBoth Turkey and Iran are also claimed to have recruited Pakistani mercenaries to fight for opposing sides, which could have also resulted them in fighting each other."}

Clearly the music of, say, Schonberg was serious, bur not classical in the sense of Bach and Beethoven. Stravinsky's music was a bridge between the two genres. It was classical music in part, and touched with African-influenced syncopations and dischords. So terms like \"art music\" and \"modern music\" were used by art critics and academics in their writing.\nArt music can be defined as serious music with a written musical tradition. The term art music is used often and has a clear meaning. Musicologist Philip Tagg calls it one part of an clear and unquestioned \"triangle consisting of 'folk', 'art' and 'popular' musics\". He explains that each of these three is distinguishable from the others according to certain criteria. The main tradition in the Western world is usually called classical music. In this regard, it is frequently used as a contrasting term to popular music and traditional or folk music."}

They fought the Nazis in many different ways, mostly without using violence. The resistance helped to hide 300,000 people in the autumn of 1944.\nDutch resistance developed slowly. In 1941, Dutch people organized a strike, called the February strike, to protest against the Nazis deporting over 400 Jews. This encouraged the resistance. The Dutch communists set up a system of cells (small groups of resistance members). Some other very amateur groups also formed, like De Geuzen, set up by Bernard IJzerdraat. Some military groups started, such as the Ordedienst ('order service'). Most groups were discovered by the Nazis during the first two years of the war.\nDutch resistance groups gathered counterintelligence (information about the Nazis), committed sabotage, and formed communications networks. This helped the Allied forces, beginning in 1944 and continuing until the Netherlands was liberated. About 75% (105,000 out of 140,000) of Dutch Jews were killed in the Holocaust, most of them murdered in Nazi death camps. A number of resistance groups specialized in saving Jewish children. Somewhere between 215 and 500 Dutch Romanis were also killed by the Nazis.\nDefinition.\nBesides armed resistance, other forms of resistance to the Nazi German occupation were carried out by the Dutch. These were important options for those who opposed the Nazis but chose not to use weapons. Nonviolent resistance included spying, going into hiding and aiding fugitives, not following Nazi rules, attending public protests, publishing illegal papers, and sabotage (destroying) companies aiding the war effort. Thousands were arrested by the Nazis and jailed for months, tortured, sent to concentration camps, or killed.\nThe Dutch February Strike of 1941, protesting the deportation of Jews from the Netherlands, was the only such strike in Nazi-occupied Europe. \nAfter the war, the Netherlands created and awarded a medal for bravery called the Resistance Cross. Of the 95 people who received it, 93 had been killed.\nPrelude.\nBefore the Germans invaded, the Netherlands were neutral. The Dutch had not fought in a war with any European nation since 1830. During World War I, the Netherlands were not invaded by Germany. The German ex-Kaiser even fled to the Netherlands in 1918. Because of this, the German invasion in World War II was a great shock. The Netherlands ordered its army to get ready in September 1939.\nEven though Netherlands was still neutral, and had not gotten involved with any side during World War II, the country's large merchant fleet was attacked by the Germans after the beginning of World War II. The Nazis sank the Dutch passenger ship SS \"Simon Bolivar\" in November 1939, killing 84 people. This shocked the Netherlands. This was not the only Dutch ship that was destroyed.\nGerman invasion.\nOn 10 May 1940, German troops started to attack the Netherlands. The Germans invaded with about 750,000 men. This was three times the size of the Dutch army. The Germans invaded with 1,100 planes (the Dutch army had 125) and six armoured trains. They destroyed 80% of the Dutch military aircraft by bombing, although the Germans did lose over 500 planes in the attack.\nThe Nazis tried the first large-scale paratroop attack in history, which failed. The Dutch retook control of the three airfields the Germans had captured. The Dutch army owned only one tank(a Renault ft-17 but we didn\u2019t use it because it was trash and it sunk away literally every were it came with it\u2019s top speed of 8 km/h ) (we had 145 other tanks coming but those didn\u2019t came in time(service was 1 out of 10(would not recommend)).\nMajor areas of military resistance were in: \nAfter four days, the Germans had invaded 70% of the country. Adolf Hitler ordered Rotterdam to be destroyed. Nazi bombing left about 85,000 Dutch civilians homeless. The Dutch surrendered.\nAbout 2,000 Dutch soldiers died fighting the Nazi invasion. So did at least 800 civilians, who died in Rotterdam.\nInitial German policy.\nThe Nazis' goal was to make the Dutch into Nazis. The country's wide-open areas made it difficult to hide illegal activities - unlike, for example, the \"Maquis\" in France, who had many hiding places.\nThe first German round-up of Jews in February 1941 led to the first general strike against the Germans.\nDutch social democrats, Catholics, and communists started the resistance movement. At first, if the Germans discovered people were involved in the resistance, they put them in jail. However, if a person was a member of an armed or military group, the Nazis could send them to concentration camps. After mid-1944, Hitler ordered his soldiers to shoot all resistance members. The Nazis also did revenge attacks against civilians, where they killed innocent civilians after resistance activities happened.\nThe Nazis deported the Dutch Jews to concentration and extermination camps. They started building fortifications along the coast and constructed 30 airfields. They forced adult males between 18 and 45 to work in German factories or on public work projects. In 1944, most trains were sent to Germany and 550,000 Dutch people were sent to Germany as laborers. Resistance became better organized and more forceful. The resistance killed high-ranking Dutch officials, such as General Seyffardt.\nIn the Netherlands, the Germans managed to kill many Jews.\nActivities.\nOn 25 February 1941, the Communist Party of the Netherlands called for a general strike, the 'February Strike'. German troops reacted by firing on unarmed crowds, and taking many prisoners. However, the strike was important because resistance against the Nazi occupation got stronger afterward.\nDutch resistance was usually secret. Resistance in the Netherlands included sabotage (like cutting phone lines, distributing anti-German leaflets, or tearing down posters). Some small groups collected intelligence and published underground papers such as \"De Waarheid\", \"Trouw\", \"Vrij Nederland\", and \"Het Parool.\" They also sabotaged phone lines.\nAnother important resistance activity was hiding Jewish families like Anne Frank's, resistance fighters, men and Allied aircrew. The resistance hid over 300,000 people from the Nazis."}

Its capital is Tagbilaran.\nThe province is a popular place among tourists because of its beaches and resorts. The Chocolate Hills, many small hills of limestone formations, is the most popular attraction. There are many hotels in the southern beaches.\nIt is the home province of Carlos P. Garcia, the eighth president of the Republic of the Philippines (1957\u20131961) who was born in Talibon.\nHistory.\nThe people of Bohol are said to be the descendants of a group of inhabitants who settled in the Philippines called \"pintados\" or \"tattooed ones\".\nThe earliest significant contact of the island with Spain occurred in 1565. In that year, a Spanish explorer named Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi came to Bohol looking for spices and gold. He made a peace pact with Datu Sikatuna in a place called Bool. This pact was signed with a blood pact between the two men. This event, called the \"Sandugo\" (\"one blood\"), is celebrated in Bohol every year during the Sandugo Festival. The \"Sandugo\" or blood compact is also depicted on Bohol's provincial flag and the Bohol provincial seal.\nBohol was administered as a \"residencia\" of Cebu. It became a separate politico-military province on July 22, 1854 together with Siquijor. A census in 1879 found Bohol with a population of 253,103 distributed among 34 municipalities.\nThe Bohol province was created on March 10, 1917.\nGeography.\nThe Bohol island has many small hills. There are two mountain ranges that run roughly parallel on the northwest and the southeast. The main mountain range of the island is \"Sierra Bullones\" on the southeast, along the south coast. It begins near Loboc, goes to the east and then to the northeast to end near Candijay. The highest point of this range and in the entire province is Mount Mayana, high.\nA plateau in the interior plateau of the island has many limestone hills. In Carmen, Batuan and Sagbayan, these hills form near perfect cones in great numbers and are known as the Chocolate Hills.\nThe are many white sandy beaches along the coast of the main island and in other islands of the province. The most well known of these beaches are in Panglao Island, and there, numerous islets have similar, yet untouched and beautiful beaches.\nThe Panglao island is relatively flat with two hills. The island is known for its beautiful beaches, and the most famous of these is \"Alona Beach\" on the south side of the island.\nThe Lapinig island is to the northeast of the Bohol island, in front of the municipality of Pres. Carlos P. Garcia. The island is flat with hills in the middle to a height of .\nRivers and waterfalls.\nThere are four main rivers that flow through Bohol:\nNumerous waterfalls and caves are scattered across the island, including the beautiful \"Mag-Aso\" falls in Antequera.\nIslands.\nThe islands surrounding mainland Bohol that are part of the province of Bohol are:\nClimate.\nBohol has, like the rest of the Philippines, a tropical climate. The average temperature is high and the humidity is also high. The dry and the wet seasons are very similar. The province is in the path of typhoons; it can be affected by them but is somewhat protected by the mountains of surrounding islands, as Leyte, Samar and Mindanao. The northeast monsoon (\"Amihan\") is from November to April and the average temperatures are slightly lower than the temperatures during the southwest monsoon (\"Habagat\"), from August to October.\nPeople and culture.\nThe main language spoken in Bohol is Boholano, a dialect of Cebuano. In addition, Tagalog and English are also spoken by many people.\nThe majority of the population of Bohol is Roman Catholic. Protestants and Iglesia ni Cristo form a large part of the remainder.\nDemographics.\nThe Bohol province had a population, in 2010, of 1,255,128, for a population density of inhabitants/km2.\nThe municipality with more people living in is the capital, Tagbilaran (96,792), followed by Ubay (68,578) and Talibon (61,373).\nAdministrative divisions.\nThe province of Bohol is divided into 47 municipalities and 1 city.It has 1,109 barangays."}

{"id": "426259", "revid": "196884", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=426259", "title": "Sociocultural theory", "text": "Sociocultural theory was created by Lev Vygotsky as a response to Behaviorism. The main idea of the theory is that the ways people interact with others and the culture they live in shape their mental abilities. Vygotsky believed that parents, relatives, peers and society all have an important role in forming higher levels of functioning. Sociocultural theory, as stated by Cole, John-Steiner, Scribner, and Souberman, is the belief that \"every function in the child's cultural development appears twice: first, on the social level, and later, on the individual level.\" This means that the skills children learn first are related to interactions with others and they then take that information and use it within themselves.\nLev Vygotsky.\nLev Vygotsky was born in 1896 in Russia. He graduated from Moscow University in 1917 and started his career as a psychologist during the Russian Revolution. He taught literature and psychology for seven years. Vygotsky went against the leading scientists of his time by suggesting that scientific psychology should not ignore the role of consciousness. Most scientists at the time disagreed with his ideas, however, he was still offered a job at the Institute of Psychology in Moscow. There he worked on his new ideas of psychology.\nOn June 11, 1934, Vygotsky died from an illness. Although his work did get some attention during his lifetime, it was not until the 1960s when Joseph Stalin died and politics did not have a large role in academics, that his views were widely known in Russia. Vygotsky's ideas did not gain fame in the United States until around twenty years later.\nSociocultural theory.\nThe main desire of Vygotsky was to design a new way to look at and come up with a solution to educational and social problems of the time. He believed other factors, besides biological instincts, caused humans to act the way they do. He was the first modern psychologist to suggest a way in which culture plays a part in each person's nature. Vygotsky believed the inclusion of sign systems from a child's culture changes behavior and connects early and later forms of individual development. Vygotsky was a strong supporter of the idea that what children learned from other people in their own culture helped them develop. He considers human thought processes to be based on social interactions and language. Three key areas of sociocultural theory are the zone of proximal development, private speech and make-believe play.\nPsychological Tools.\nVygotsky (1981) stated that humans \u201cmaster themselves from the outside through psychological tools\u201d (pg. 141).Psychological tools are language, writing styles, counting system and conventional signs (Miller, 2016). Psychological tools are also inclusive of learning strategies and modes of attending and memorization that is taught in an individual\u2019s school. Such tools are utilized to guide individual\u2019s thoughts and behaviors. The culture of which a person is embedded dictates which tools, social interactions and skills are needed. What one culture values may differ from another, thus the tools provided reflect specific cultural values and needs. For example, western society places importance on education and technology, as these are needed to be self-sufficient in that part of the world. Other societies, such as more indigenous types, may emphasis the importance of hunting/gathering type behaviors. As one can see, psychological tools indigenous societies utilizes versus the ones in which western societies utilize would differ. Children use their psychological tools to cognitively transform their social experiences.\nZone of proximal development.\nVygotsky felt learning in children should be related to their developmental level. This caused him to argue that learning takes place within a zone of proximal development (ZPD), which is made up of functions that are not yet fully formed, but are on the way to being established.\nThe ZPD draws attention to three important issues. First, it focuses attention on children's mental functions that are currently going on, but are not yet complete. Second, it recognized help from peers or adults as a method of learning. Third, it helped to separate between actual and potential learning ability. The actual ability of a child is what they can do without any help from others, while potential learning ability is when a child needs help in order to complete a task. Three assumptions are often discussed in relation to the ZPD. They include generality assumption, assistance assumption and potential assumption.\nThe ZPD is mainly used for two types of cognitive development analysis. One reason ZPD is used is to pick out the functions needed for learning as a child ages. The second test done by ZPD is to figure out where the child is at the moment, mentally, in relation to where they are supposed to be or where they will be as they grow.\nScaffolding.\nIn the 1970s, Bruner, Wood, and Ross created the term \"scaffolding\" to add to sociocultural theory. Scaffolding describes the interaction between a child and an adult who helps them finish a task that they could not do alone. Scaffolding relates to Vygotsky's sociocultural theory because it recognizes the role of social interaction on learning and how other people affect the development of children. It involves changing the way a more skilled person helps a child in doing a task based on their available learning ability. Just like physical scaffolding is used to support buildings as they are being made, scaffolding in sociocultural theory helps support a child as their mental processes develop.\nPrivate speech.\nPrivate speech takes place when children talk to themselves. Vygotsky saw this as the starting point for all mental developments. According to Lantolf, Vygotsky believed \"it is the process of privatizing speech that higher forms of consciousness arise on the inner plane and in this way our biological capacities are organized into a culturally mediated mind.\" \nIn simpler terms, Vygotsky thought that it was by using private speech that a child's biological instincts were made into culturally acceptable ways of acting. He suggested that children spoke to themselves as a way of guiding themselves through an action. Vygotsky suggested that private speech changes as children age, beginning as external (out loud) speech when they are younger but then becoming more internal (within themselves) as they age. Through relationships with more capable people, children get information and use that understanding in their private speech. Vygotsky thought private speech showed how children use the support given to them by others to assist their own way of thinking and how they act.\nMake-believe play.\nVygotsky saw make-believe play as an important part of child development. It is one of the main ways of developing during the preschool years. Children use make-believe play to test multiple skills and achieve important cultural abilities. Vygotsky suggested that as children take part in made up situations they learn how to act in agreement with their internal ideas, not just external ideas.\nDuring play children put themselves into the adult roles of their culture and practice how they will act in the future. Play takes place before development so children can start to gain the motivation, abilities and attitudes needed for social participation, which can be done only with the help of peers and adults. Make-believe play allows children to practice how they would act in the real world. It provides them with a way to gain the basic skills needed to function in their society before they become adults. However, learning these roles and skills is only done with help from others in their culture."}

Some people call these instructions assembler language and others use the term assembly language.\nMost computers come with a specified set of very basic instructions that correspond to the basic machine operations that the computer can perform. For example, a \"Load\" instruction causes the processor to move a string of bits from a location in the processor's memory to a special holding place called a register. Assuming the processor has at least eight registers, each numbered, the following instruction would move the value (string of bits of a certain length) at memory location 3000 into the holding place called register 8:\n L 8,3000\nThe programmer can write a program using a sequence of these assembler instructions.\nThis sequence of assembler instructions, known as the source code or source program, is then specified to the assembler program when that program is started.\nThe assembler program takes each program statement in the source program and generates a corresponding bit stream or pattern (a series of 0's and 1's of a given length).\nThe output of the assembler program is called the object code or object program relative to the input source program. The sequence of 0's and 1's that constitute the object program is sometimes called machine code.\nThe object program can then be run (or executed) whenever desired.\nIn the earliest computers, programmers actually wrote programs in machine code, but assembler languages or instruction sets were soon developed to speed up programming. Today, assembler programming is used only where very efficient control over processor operations is needed. It requires knowledge of a particular computer's instruction set, however. Historically, most programs have been written in \"higher-level\" languages such as COBOL, FORTRAN, PL/I, and C. These languages are easier to learn and faster to write programs with than assembler language. The program that processes the source code written in these languages is called a compiler. Like the assembler, a compiler takes higher-level language statements and reduces them to machine code.\nA newer idea in program preparation and portability is the concept of a virtual machine. For example, using the Java programming language, language statements are compiled into a generic form of machine language known as bytecode that can be run by a virtual machine, a kind of theoretical machine that approximates most computer operations. The bytecode can then be sent to any computer platform that has previously downloaded or built in the Java virtual machine. The virtual machine is aware of the specific instruction lengths and other particularities of the platform and ensures that the Java bytecode can run."}
