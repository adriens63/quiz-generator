It indicates how much of a particular drug or other substance is needed to inhibit a given biological process (or component of a process, i.e. an enzyme, cell, cell receptor or microorganism) by half. In other words, it is the half minimal (50%) inhibitory concentration (IC) of a substance (50% IC, or IC50). It is commonly used as a measure of antagonist drug potency in pharmacological research. Sometimes, it is also converted to the pIC50 scale (-log IC50), in which higher values indicate exponentially greater potency. According to the FDA, IC50 represents the concentration of a drug that is required for 50% inhibition \"in vitro\".\nIt is comparable to an EC50 for agonist drugs. EC50 also represents the plasma concentration required for obtaining 50% of a maximum effect \"in vivo\"."}

His mother died when he was one and ten years later his father died. In 1895 he became a priest and obtained the title Vardapet (or Vartabed), meaning a \"priest\" or a \"church scholar\".\nHe established and conducted the monastery choir till 1896 when he went to Berlin, to the Kaiser Friedrich Wilhelm University. Here he studied music at the private conservatory of Prof. Richard Schmidt. In 1899 he acquired the title \"doctor of musicology\" and returned to Echmiadzin. He traveled extensively around the country, listening and recording details about Armenian folk songs and dances performed in various villages. This way he collected and published some 3000 songs, many of them adapted to choir singing.\nHis major work is Badarak (Divine Liturgy), still used today as one of the two most popular musical settings of the Armenian Church liturgy. \nHe was the first non-European to be admitted into the International Music Society of which he was a co-founder.\nOn April 24, 1915, said to be the day when Armenian Genocide officially began, he was arrested. The next day he was put on a train with 180 other Armenian notables and sent to the city of \u00c7ank\u0131r\u0131 in northern Central Anatolia, at a distance of some 300 miles. His good friend, Turkish nationalist poet Emin Yurdakul, the authoress Halide Edip, and the U.S. ambassador Henry Morgenthau intervened with the government and, by special orders from Talat Pasha, Komitas was sent back to the capital. In autumn 1916, he was taken to a Turkish military hospital and he moved to Paris in 1919 where he died in a psychiatric clinic \"Villejuif\" in 1935. Next year his ashes were transferred to Yerevan and buried in the Pantheon. \nThe Yerevan State Musical Conservatory is named after Komitas. There also a world famous string quartet named after Komitas. "}

Women and men can both stand for this movement. Women's rights leaders such as Susan B. Anthony encouraged many women to join the women's rights movements.

Usually, pickup trucks are same size as normal cars. You usually may drive a pickup truck with the same driver's license as an ordinary car, but heavy pickup trucks may require a light truck license. The smallest pickup trucks are made from scooters by replacing the rear seat and rear wheel with an axle and cargo bed, and some have only three wheels.\nA pickup truck can be turned into an improvised military vehicle by installing a machine gun or a light cannon on the cargo bed. Such cars are called \"technicals\", and they are especially popular in Africa."}

It had a gun pit (special place for the cannon to sit and fire from) and firing wall (pictured in intro) that was built out of large blocks of sandstone and carved partly from the original rock that was already there. The first part of the building process around this time was done under the watchful eye of Major George Barney, a Commanding Royal Engineer who used hired workers provided by Governor Gipps.\nIn 1871 the fort got an extra barracks. The barracks were made from large sandstone blocks and carved out of the rock on the headland. This addition was the work of James Barnet, a colonial architect. This most recent add-on had three gun pits and had connecting walkways for the people in the army that worked there. The upgrade of 1871 was complementary to some of the larger fortifications being constructed during the same period.\nThe site is now part of the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust."}

The English controlled large parts of France when they started the siege, and Orleans was the last thing stopping them from attacking the rest of France. There was not much south of the river to defend the people who served Charles VII of France, so the English came close to joining their northern lands in France with the land they controlled at Aquitaine.\nThe siege started on October 12, 1428 and its only major action until Joan of Arc arrived was the Battle of the Herrings.

King Charles of France didn't engage because he was mentally unwell. Henry V was involved in hand to hand combat and was struck by an axe but his helmet saved him. \nThe English longbow was an important weapon for killing and winning this battle. It was more powerful than the French crossbow and they had more of them. The majority of the army were bowmen. The English army used sharp wooden archer's stakes to protect the archers from French mounted knights. \nThe English took prisoners but killed all except those of high rank. Overall the French lost 8000 men and the English lost 100 but historians are unsure of the actual numbers. The French mainly lost because they wore heavy armour and got stuck in the sticky mud at Azincourt (Agincourt)."}

To prove a theorem is to show that theorem holds in all cases (where it claims to hold). To prove a statement, one can either use axioms, or theorems which have already been shown to be true. Many techniques for proving a statements exist, and these include proof by induction, proof by contraction and proof by cases.\nProof by induction.\nOne type of proof is called proof by induction. This is usually used to prove that a theorem holds for all numbers (or all numbers from some point onwards). There are 4 steps in a proof by induction.\n1. State that the proof will be by induction, and state which variable will be used in the induction step.\n2. Prove that the statement is true for some beginning case.\n3. Assume that for some value \"n\" = \"n0\", the statement is true and has all of the properties listed in the statement. This is called the induction step.\n4. Show that the statement is true for the next value, \"n0\"+1.\nOnce that is shown, it would mean that for any value of \"n\" that is picked, the next one is true. Since it is true for some beginning case (usually \"n\"=1), it's true for the next one (\"n\"=2). And since it is true for 2, it must be true for 3. And since it is true for 3, it must be true for 4, etc. Induction shows that it is always true, precisely because it is true for whatever comes after any given number.\nAn example of proof by induction is as follows:\nProve that for all natural numbers \"n\", 2(1+2+3+...+\"n\"-1+\"n\")=\"n\"(\"n\"+1).\nProof: First, the statement can be written as \"For all natural numbers \"n\", 2formula_1=n(n+1).\"\nBy induction on n,\nFirst, for n=1, 2formula_2=2(1)=1(1+1), so this is true.\nNext, assume that for some \"n\"=\"n0\" the statement is true. That is, 2formula_3 = n0(n0+1).\nThen for \"n\"=\"n0\"+1, 2formula_4 can be rewritten 2(\"n0\"+1) + 2formula_3.\nSince 2formula_3 = n0(n0+1), 2\"n0\"+1 + 2formula_3 = 2(n0+1) + 2n0(n0+1).\nSo 2(n0+1) + 2n0(n0+1)= 2(n0+1)(n0 + 2), which completes the proof.\nProof by contradiction.\nProof by contradiction is a way of proving a mathematical theorem by showing that if the statement were false, then there would be a logical contradiction involved. That is, if one of the results of the theorem is assumed to be false, then there would be some inconsistency with the logic.\nWhen proving a theorem by way of contradiction, it is important to note that in the beginning of the proof. This is usually abbreviated BWOC. When the contradiction appears in the proof, there is usually a \u2a33 symbol involved."}

It stars Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn and Steve Buscemi. It is the first movie directed by Tarantino and is about the events before and after a jewelry store robbery that went wrong. The movie was released on October 23, 1992. The title, and promo shots associated with the movie, was a take on the violent Sam Peckinpah movie, Straw Dogs. Although Reservoir Dogs failed at the theater it found new life after being released on VHS and DVD, quickly becoming a cult classic.\nPlot.\nThe movie shows the events before and after a robbery at a jewelry shop in Los Angeles, California, that went wrong. The men are given nicknames with colours so that they do not know each others names; Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker), Mr. Brown (Quentin Tarantino), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi), and Mr. White (Harvey Keitel). They work for a gangster Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney) and his son, \"Nice Guy\" Eddie (Chris Penn).\nThe robbery goes wrong and several of the men are killed, and Mr. Orange is shot and bleeding. The rest of the men return to the hideout and talk about what went wrong. Mr. Blonde has captured a police officer, Marvin Nash (Kirk Baltz) and beat him to try to get an answer. Mr. Blonde tries to torture the police officer while the rest of the men are away but is killed by Mr. Orange who is actually an undercover police officer.\nThe rest of the men argue and are in a Mexican standoff and are all shot. Mr. Pink, who hid from the shootout, steals the diamonds and runs away.\nCast.\nCritical reaction.\nAt the movie's release at the Sundance Film Festival, movie critic Jami Bernard of the \"New York Daily News\" compared the effect of \"Reservoir Dogs\" to that of the 1895 movie \"L'Arriv\u00e9e d'un Train en Gare de la Ciotat\", where audiences watched a moving train approaching the camera and ran away frightened. Bernard claimed that \"Reservoir Dogs\" had a similar effect and people were not ready for it. Vincent Canby of the \"New York Times\" enjoyed the cast and the use of non-linear storytelling. He similarly complimented Tarantino's directing and liked the fact that he did not often use close-ups in the movie. Kenneth Turan of the \"Los Angeles Times\" also enjoyed the movie and the acting, particularly that of Buscemi, Tierney and Madsen, and said \"Tarantino's palpable enthusiasm, his unapologetic passion for what he's created, reinvigorates this venerable plot and, mayhem aside, makes it involving for longer than you might suspect.\"\nRoger Ebert was less enthusiastic; he felt that the script could have been better and said that the movie \"feels like it's going to be terrific\", but Tarantino's script does not have much curiosity about the characters. He also stated that \"[Tarantino] has an idea, and trusts the idea to drive the plot.\" Ebert gave the movie two and a half stars out of four also claiming that he enjoyed it, and that it was a very good movie from a talented director, like other critics, he enjoyed the cast, but stated \"I liked what I saw, but I wanted more\".\n\"Reservoir Dogs\" has received a lot of criticism for its strong violence and language. One particular scene that viewers did not like was Michael Madsen cutting off the police officer's ear, and Madsen himself reportedly had a great deal of difficulty finishing the scene especially after Kirk Baltz ad-libbed the desperate plea \"I've got a little kid at home\". Many people have left theaters during the movie and Tarantino commented at the time: \nIt happens at every single screening. For some people the violence, or the rudeness of the language, is a mountain they can't climb. That's OK. It's not their cup of tea. But I am affecting them. I wanted that scene to be disturbing. During a screening of the movie at a Film Festival in Barcelona, fifteen people walked out, including horror movie director Wes Craven and special effects artist Rick Baker. Baker later told Tarantino to take the walk out as a \"compliment\" and explained that he found the violence unnerving because of its heightened sense of realism.\nCritic John Hartl compared the ear-cutting scene to the shower murder scene in \"Psycho\" and Tarantino to David Lynch. He furthermore explored parallels between \"Reservoir Dogs\" and \"Glengarry Glen Ross\". After this movie, Tarantino was also compared to Martin Scorsese, Sam Peckinpah, John Singleton, Gus Van Sant, and Abel Ferrara. For its nonlinear storyline, \"Reservoir Dogs\" has also often been compared to \"Rashomon\". Critic James Berardinelli was of a similar opinion; he complimented both the cast and Tarantino's dialogue writing abilities. Hal Hinson of \"The Washington Post\" was also enthusiastic about the cast, complimenting the movie on its \"deadpan sense of humor\". Todd McCarthy called the movie \"undeniably impressive\" and was of the opinion that it was influenced by \"Mean Streets\", \"Goodfellas\" and \"The Killing\"."}

Other performers hosted successful variety shows through the years.\nVariety shows were a good \"breaking ground\" for new acts, in the early years of television. They were also useful to established performers, to give them steady work and regular exposure to audiences.\nInterest in the format lessened in the United States during the 1970s. Dolly Parton tried to start a new variety show in the 1980s, but it did not last. Performance competition shows, like \"The Gong Show\", \"Star Search\", and today \"American Idol\" became the new breaking ground for performers.\nThe variety show format is still sometimes imitated by comedy programs. Television talk shows carry much of the spirit of variety shows, in offering a variety of entertainers to appear."}

By the time it was finished on 2 September 1873 Prussia had also beat Austria in the Austro-Prussian War (1866) and France in the Franco-Prussian War (1870/1871). A bronze sculpture of Victoria was added. \"Victoria\" was high and weighed 35 tonnes. Berliners like to give nicknames to famous buildings. They call the statue \"Goldelse\", meaning something like \"Golden Lizzy\". She also has the nickname of \"Chick on a Stick\".\nThe column was built in the K\u00f6nigsplatz, now the Platz der Republik, in front of the Reichstag building. It had three blocks of sandstone decorated by cannons taken from the enemies in the three wars. In 1938 the column was moved to its present location, and a fourth ring, decorated with golden garlands was added.\nAround the base are four bronze reliefs showing the three wars and the winning army marching into Berlin. They were made by four Berlin sculptors:\nThese reliefs were taken away in 1945. The French occupying army did not want to remind Germans about old victories. French president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand returned the reliefs in time for Berlin's 750th anniversary of Berlin.\nThe monument is now on the \"Gro\u00dfer Stern\" (Great Star). Many roads meet here, so there are four tunnels under the roads to the monument, and it is possible to climb the steps inside the column and look out over Berlin. If the Nazis had not moved the column it would probably have been destroyed in World War II.\nThe column is in Wim Wenders' film \"Wings of Desire\". In the film it is the place where angels meet. The golden statue on the column was in the music video to U2's \"Stay (Faraway, So Close!)\" and inspired Paul van Dyk's 1998 trance music hit, \"For an Angel\".\n\"El \u00c1ngel\" in Mexico City looks a lot like the Berlin victory column.\nThe Victory Column is open every day: April-October 9:30am-6:30pm November-March 9:30am-5:30pm."}

Church music is sacred (religious) music, but not all religious music is church music. Some music may be inspired by religion, but it may not be church music. For example, some songs are about religion, but they may not be church music. Although it uses the words of the Requiem mass, Verdi\u2019s \"Requiem\", was composed for performance in a concert hall. Britten\u2019s \"War Requiem\" was written for performance in a cathedral, but it was not meant to be part of a service of worship, so it would not usually be thought of as \u201cchurch music\u201d.\nChurch music has varied enormously during the history of Christianity as different churches kept changing their ideas about what part music should have in religious worship. Most church music is based on singing. Music written for church choirs mostly used the words of the liturgy (the words used in services). The organ is the most important musical instrument in church music, although from time to time many other instruments have been used as well.\nDuring many periods in history composers writing for the church used traditional music rather than the newest fashions. This was particularly the case in the early 17th century when composers such as Claudio Monteverdi often wrote in two different styles: the old style for church music (which, at the time, they called \u201cstilo antico\u201d) and the new style for secular (non-religious) music (which they called \u201cstilo moderno\u201d).\nMusic in the early history of the church.\nDuring the early history of Christian worship the churches were spread through many countries in the Roman Empire. The musical traditions that already existed in these countries were used, so there was great variety. Musical instruments were associated with the devil and with dancing, and so they were thought to be wicked and were not allowed in churches. The only music that was allowed in churches was singing. In the 4th century Bishop Ambrosius of Milan introduced the antiphon and encouraged newly composed hymns. Psalms were an important part of the early Christian worship. Responsorial psalms were psalms which were sung by one person (who may have been called a \u201creader\u201d), and the congregation may have responded at the end of a verse with something simple such as \u201cAlleluia\u201d. Gradually \u201cantiphonal psalmody\u201d was developed. This meant that the choir stands on opposite sides facing one another and they sing the verses of the psalm alternately (first one side has a turn, then the other). Antiphonal psalm singing can still be heard today in Anglican cathedrals.\nThe kind of music heard in the Catholic Church was known as chant or plainchant, often known as \u201cGregorian chant\u201d (after St Gregory the Great, who was Pope from 590-604). The text (the words that were sung) were the standard words of the liturgy. The words of the Mass were set to music by many composers. Music for the dead was called Requiem Mass. There was also music for Vespers and the Compline. Until the 16th century the organ was only used to accompany the singing. In the Renaissance period many great composers such as Giovanni da Palestrina and Orlande de Lassus wrote polyphonic music for the Catholic Church. They often wrote motets: short pieces based on texts which were not part of the liturgy.\nDuring the period called Reformation some Protestant groups broke away from the Catholic Church. From this time on Catholic and Protestant music developed in different ways.\nProtestant Church Music.\nMartin Luther started the Protestant movement in Germany. In the Lutheran church the chorale was the most important part of the musical worship. Luther himself composed many chorale tunes. These are like hymns. The great Johann Sebastian Bach based much of his organ music on the chorale (these pieces are called Chorale Preludes). The choir often sang a motet. Sometimes these choir pieces became very long and turned into cantatas. The words were not from the liturgy but made up by poets or taken from the Bible. Bach wrote about 200 cantatas for the church. He also wrote two great passions which tell the story of Jesus dying on the cross. Other composers who have contributed to Protestant church music in Europe include Heinrich Sch\u00fctz, Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, Dietrich Buxtehude, Johann Pachelbel, and Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy.\nCatholic Church Music.\nMusic for the Catholic Church includes instrumental music such as \u201cchurch cantatas\u201d. Arcangelo Corelli and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart wrote many examples of these. Mozart also wrote several masses. Great Italian composers of the 16th and 17th centuries who wrote church music include Giovanni Gabrieli and Claudio Monteverdi. In the 19th century Rheinberger and Max Reger wrote music in the Romantic style. French composers of this time wrote in a style which was similar to secular music.\nChurch Music in England.\nWhen King Henry VIII broke away from the Catholic Church he founded his own church, known as the Anglican church. Many great composers wrote music for the Anglican service. Their music for choirs was mostly service settings and anthems. They also wrote many hymn tunes. Important composers include William Byrd (who also wrote Catholic church music) and Thomas Tallis in the Renaissance, Orlando Gibbons and Henry Purcell in the Baroque period, and in later periods Samuel Sebastian Wesley, Charles Stanford, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Edward Bairstow, William Mathias and John Rutter.\nChurch Music in the United States.\nChurch music in American churches developed, at first, in a similar way to European music. The Book of Common Prayer was the basis of American worship. Both Puritans and Baptists thought that congregational singing was important. In the 18th century Singing Masters from Singing Schools in the north eastern states used to travel around to try to teach people in church to sing properly. The most famous of these singing masters was William Billings. Because most people could not read, a system called Lined-out Hymnody developed, in which the priest sang a line and the congregation copied him. Later in the century, during the \u201cFirst Great Awakening\u201d, the hymn tunes of English composers such as Isaac Watts and Charles Wesley became popular.\nIn the 19th century people from different churches met at Camp Meetings. These were led by Evangelists. The songs reflect the belief that sinners can be saved by repenting. The music of black people and of folk music became important influences. Songs became tuneful and often had refrains. In the middle of the century Sunday Schools for children became extremely popular and many songs were written for them. Gospel songs and negro spirituals also became very widely used and influenced the development of church music in America.\nChurch Music in the Orthodox Church.\nChurch music in the Orthodox Church in East European countries is always sung. It is based on the Byzantine musical tradition."}

There are technologies like internet, mobile phones, computers and Wi-Fi in some parts of the world, and in other parts there are not. It is the difference of people that can access the internet, and the people that cannot. \nProblems.\nA digital divide can be born for many reasons like socioeconomic problems (few people are rich and lots are poor), racial problems (there is a majority or a minority that control the other), or geographical problems (in the cities there are technologies but there are not in rural areas). \nCountries on the rich side of the divide include Canada, the United States, Japan, South Korea, Europe and Australasia. They have big internet connection developments, and most people can afford computers and other technology. On the poor side are Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia, where there are many social problems. Technology has a long way to go before getting interest in those countries, because of problems like the price of technology and the fact that sometimes there are not any resources to help.\nInner conflict.\nIn some parts of the world there is a large digital divide. Sometimes it is just in half of a country, or just a region, for example Africa. As with other things like education or transport, some people have things that others don't have. There are big cities where technologies are cheap and there are many villages and rural communities where there is no digital/electronic technology. In this case the digital divide creates other problems. Because a part of the country is rich and another part is poor, there are often problems with trading and connections.\nOpposition.\nMany rich countries (for example, Canada, the United States, Japan, Italy, France, United Kingdom) send old computers or make charity projects by non-profit associations or communities or projects for schools in poor countries, for example One Laptop Per Child, to fight the digital divide and to make a culture involving internet and other technologies."}

It expresses them as an exponential function. One bel is a power ratio of 10:1, and is divided into ten decibels. An increase of three decibels is approximately a doubling of power. Decibels are often used in measuring telecommunication signals. With electric audio signals, there are several decibel units, relative to several bases. For example, dBm is relative to one milliwatt.\nIt's been said that the smallest difference humans can hear is 0 dB and is related to the Absolute threshold of hearing, although this is very subjective at best.\nHistory.\nThe bel unit was named after Alexander Graham Bell. This unit was so rough that it is more typical to use the decibel, which is one bel divided by ten. Before bels, there was the Transmission Unit (TU).\nExamples and Protection.\nOften, decibels are used to say how loud a sound is relative to the threshold of hearing. The decibel is not an SI unit. The table here uses dBSPL as units of sound to indicate consensus on hearing protection. Some examples of sounds are:\nHearing protection can also be used to shield from ear damage.

The game was made by Nintendo, and was released in 1984 in Japan. In \"Duck Hunt\", players use the NES Zapper to shoot ducks on screen to get points. The ducks come onto the screen one or two at a time, and the player is given three shots to shoot them down. \n\"Duck Hunt\" was one of the two first Pack-in games for the NES. The game did not get many reviews, but many gamers enjoyed playing it, and many people said it was a good game. Before Nintendo made the game, it also made a \"Duck Hunt\" game about the Laser Clay Shooting System released in 1976.\nGameplay.\nIn \"Duck Hunt\", players use the Nintendo Zapper Light Gun that must be plugged into their NES consoles. Then they try to shoot down ducks or clay pigeons. \"Duck Hunt\" was also released as an arcade game in 1984, and was also in the PlayChoice-10 arcade console.\nThe game has three modes: one-duck mode, with only one duck on the screen; two-duck mode, with two on the screen; and a third mode called \"clay pigeon shooting\". The clay pigeons are much smaller than the ducks and are harder to hit. Players need faster reaction time when playing this mode than when shooting ducks. In \"Vs. Duck Hunt\", Clay Shooting mode is the second mode after two-duck mode, because the arcade \"Duck Hunt\" games never had a one-duck mode. \nDuring the game, there is a dog that laughs at the player if no duck is hit. If the player hits a duck, the dog will congratulate them. A popular urban legend is that players have found a way to shoot the dog. This cannot happen in \"Duck Hunt\", but it can happen in a bonus round of the arcade game \"Vs. Duck Hunt\". \n\"Duck Hunt\" does not have a way for more than one person to shoot ducks, but a second player may plug in a NES controller in the other controller port and control the duck that appears. This only can happen in one-duck mode, and can not be done with the clay pigeons.\nDevelopment.\nNobody knows much about the development of \"Duck Hunt\", but Nintendo Research &amp; Development 1 made the game. They also created the Light Gun used in \"Duck Hunt\". Work on the game was led by Takehiro Izushi, and was produced by Gunpei Yokoi. \nPackaging and music.\nPackaging.\n\"Duck Hunt\" has been placed in several cartridges with more than one game. In the Action Set cartridge of the NES in the 1980s, \"Duck Hunt\" came with \"Super Mario Bros.\". If a player bought the NES system with the Power Pad, then \"Duck Hunt\" came on a 3-in-1 cartridge that also had \"World Class Track Meet\" and \"Super Mario Bros\".\nAudio.\nThe music was composed, or written, by Koji Kondo and Hirokazu \"Hip\" Tanaka. Both men made music for other Nintendo games at the time, such as Metroid. Some people have called the sound effects, \"pretty much what you'd expect for a game from the early 1980s - that is, awful by today's standards...\", but the game's music was played on the Video Games Live concert tour.\nReception and legacy.\nReception.\nBecause it was made in the 1980's, \"Duck Hunt\" did not get very many reviews. Most critics have not reviewed \"Duck Hunt\". All Game Guide called the game an \"attractive but repetitive target shooter\" and \"utterly mindless ... the game is fun for a short time, but gets old after a few rounds of play.\" Video Game Critic, another website, gave the game a review in 2004, scoring the game a \"D\". It said, \"there's really not much substance to it ... overall Duck Hunt is pretty lame, and only worth playing for a trip down memory lane.\" Video game players say that they like the game. IGN users gave it an 8.7 out of 10, and the GameSpot users gave the Mario-Duck Hunt cartridge a 9.1 out of 10. It was rated the 155th best game made on a Nintendo System in Nintendo Powers Top 200 Games list.\n\"Duck Hunt\", and the characters in it, have been in other video games since the game first came out in the 1980s. The dog in \"Duck Hunt\" has appeared in \"Barker Bill's Trick Shooting\" and can be shot in the \"Balloon Saloon\" game. In \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\", a trophy shows the ducks from \"Duck Hunt\". Also, games in the \"WarioWare, Inc.\" series have games about \"Duck Hunt\". Level 19 in Tetris DS is also about \"Duck Hunt\"\nWii Play.\nOne of the games in \"Wii Play\" for the Wii console is Shooting, a game that is similar to \"Duck Hunt\".

Its capital has the same name, San Jos\u00e9 de Ocoa.\nIt was created on 6 September 2000 but it started on 1 January 2001. It was a municipality of the Peravia province before being raised to the category of province.\nName.\nThe province is named after its capital city, San Jos\u00e9 de Ocoa. \"Ocoa\" is the name of the river that crosses the province; it is a Ta\u00edno word that means \"a place with many mountains\".\nHistory.\nBartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas was the first person that wrote about the region when he said that \"Maniey\" (now, \"Maniel\") was a Ta\u00edno province. Maniey or Maniel meant \"a place where there are peanuts\"; mani ( (Spanish) is the Ta\u00edno word for peanut. Peter Martyr d'Anghiera did not write about the \"Maniey\" but he wrote about a lake in the region of Rancho Arriba; there is not a lake (or lakes) there anymore, only a swamp.\nFor a long time, the region was visited only by \"monteros\" (men that hunted wild cows and pigs). Then some \"s\" (runaway slaves) came to live here, in the high mountains of the region. One settlement was called \"Maniel\"; since then, Maniel meant in Hispaniola a place where maroons live and not only the name of the region. \nThe first settlement by maroons in the region is from the beginning of the 16th century and was called Maniel Viejo de Ocoa. This settlement lasted until 1666 or 1667 because many people died from smallpox and measles that affected the island in those years. There was also a military action in the region to capture maroons.\nThe second settlement was during the first years of the 19th century (around 1802), and it is known as Maniel de los Lorenzos (\"Lorenzos' Maniel\") because of the last name (\"Lorenzo\") of its founders. It was founded at El Canal, north of the city of San Jos\u00e9 de Ocoa.\nVery soon some families from Ban\u00ed, on the south, began to move to the region and made their houses at what is now the city of San Jos\u00e9 de Ocoa.\nDuring the Dominican War of Independence (1844), there were two important battles in the region: the battles of \"El Memiso\" and of \"El Pinar\", won by Dominican soldiers. So the Haitian soldiers could not go on to Santo Domingo, and had to go back to Haiti.\nIn December 1858, San Jos\u00e9 de Ocoa was made a municipality of the old province of Santo Domingo; in 1895, it was changed to a municipality of the Azua province. With the creation of the Peravia, San Jos\u00e9 de Ocoa was a municipality of that new province. Then, on 6 September 2000, San Jos\u00e9 de Ocoa was made a new province with the northern half of the Peravia province and with the municipalities of San Jos\u00e9 de Ocoa, Rancho Arriba and Sabana Larga, and the municipal district of La Ci\u00e9naga.\nIn 2004, Nizao-Las Auyamas and El Pinar became municipal districts, and El Naranjal in 2006.\nLocation.\nSan Jos\u00e9 de Ocoa is bordered to the north by the Monse\u00f1or Nouel and La Vega provinces, to the east by San Crist\u00f3bal, to the south by the Peravia, and to the west by Azua.\nPopulation.\nIn (last national census), there were people living in the San Jos\u00e9 de Ocoa province, and 37,466 () living in towns and cities. The population density was persons/km\u00b2.\nIts population represents of the total population of the country and the province is ranked as the 29th (out of 31 plus the National District) more populated province.\n, the total estimated propulation of the province is 56,565 inhabitants.\nThe largest city of the province is San Jos\u00e9 de Ocoa, its head municipality or capital, with an urban population (in ) of 22,383 inhabitants.\nGeography.\nThe San Jos\u00e9 de Ocoa province has a total area of . It has of the area of the Dominican Republic and it is ranked as the 26th (out of 31 plus the National District) largest province.\nThe altitude of the provincial capital, San Jos\u00e9 de Ocoa, is above sea level.\nThe most important river is the Ocoa river, that flows through the province from north to south.\nMunicipalities.\nThere are 3 municipalities and 4 municipal districts (M.D.) in the province.\nEconomy.\nThe main economic activity of the province is farming; the main products are coffee, beans and potatoes. Other vegetables, such as cabbage and carrots, are also grown as well as some tropical fruits (avocado and mango)."}

It was released on November 18, 1988, along with \"Oliver &amp; Company\". The movie's success led to thirteen direct-to-video sequels and a TV show. \"The Little Mermaid\" was later released on November 17, 1989. It is the second of three animated features to have been nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. \"The Black Cauldron\" and \"Rock-a-Doodle\" were also nominated for Best Picture in their respective years. The film won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, beating two Disney films, \"The Rescuers Down Under\" and \"The Great Mouse Detective\", as well as Best Sound Editing at the 77th Academy Awards.\nStory.\nAn orphaned long-neck dinosaur named Littlefoot goes off in search of the legendary Great Valley, a place with many plants where dinosaurs live in peace. Along the way, he meets four other young dinosaurs, each one a different species. They encounter several problems as they learn to work together and survive.\nCharacters.\nThere are five main characters known as the \"Gang of Five:\"\nLittlefoot: The leader of the gang, Littlefoot is a \"long-neck,\" the in-universe name for Brontosaurus. He is brave, and good at making decisions. He lives with his grandparents in the Great Valley.\nCera: A \"three-horn,\" also known as a Triceratops. She is stubborn and does not trust easily. She is the most aggressive of the group. She lives with her father for most of the movies, but gains a new mother in the 11th movie and a younger sister in the 12th movie.\nDucky: Ducky has been called a \"Swimmer,\" \"Big Mouth,\" and \"Duckfoot\" on screen, so it is not known for sure what kind of dinosaur Ducky is. She looks most like a Saurolophus, but she is called a Parasaurolophus on the Land Before Time Website . She is the nicest of the group, and trusts others easily. She lives with her mother (though her father does not appear) and says in the sixth film that she is one of thirteen twins, although the original series tht she is one of four. She also has her adopted brother Spike.\nPetrie: A \"flyer,\" or a Pteranodon. He gets scared very easily and is too trusting, but he is loyal and can be brave at important times. He lives with his mother and brothers.\nSpike: The youngest of the group. He is a \"Spiketail,\" which is a Stegosaurus. Spike does not talk, though it was shown in the 4th movie that he can when he wants to. He enjoys eating and lets Ducky sit on his back if she needs to. Ducky is his older sister, since she adopted him during the first movie. He lives with Ducky's family.\nAlso of note is a \"Sharptooth\" named Chomper, who was born in the 2nd movie and was so popular with fans that he returned in the 5th movie and the TV series. He is friends with all the main characters, despite his natural instincts telling him to eat them.\nSequels.\nIn addition to the movies, there is \"The Land Before Time: Sing-Along Songs\" (1997) and \n\"The Land Before Time: More Sing-Along Songs\" (1999)\nTV Series.\nAfter the success of the original movie and its sequels, a television series based on the movies began airing on YTV in Canada as a test on January 5, 2007. It aired in Canada, Britain, and the United States of America, and had 26 episodes. It then aired on Cartoon Network in the United States on March 5, 2007 where it was animated after the DVD release of \"The Land Before Time XII: The Great Day of the Flyers\". In the UK, it was once shown just on Boomerang, showing every day at 4pm, but it is now programmed on its sister preschool channel Cartoonito. It brought back Chomper as a main character, and introduced a new friend, an Oviraptor named Ruby, who helps the other dinosaurs learn lessons and solve problems. This was the second Bluth film not to include any songs, the first one being \"All Dogs Go to Heaven\"."}

It was created and hosted by Chuck Barris. The show's name came from a gong used to shorten performances that were not liked. The gong was sounded by celebrity judges, who rated the performers.\nBeginning.\nIn the mid-1970s, Barris hoped to make a new kind of game show, based on the old \"amateur hour\" contest shows. He held auditions to find talented acts to appear. Nearly all the performers who came to the auditions were ordinary people, who had one or two skills, or thought they had special talent. Many of the performances were \"party pieces\", that people did to amuse others. Others were more serious, and tried hard to perform well.\nMost of the acts made Barris and his staff laugh. They thought their idea for a show would not work, because of the strange and funny performances. Barris then realized that audiences might want to watch them for amusement. He and his staff began to look for funny and unusual acts. The show debuted in 1976, and became a hit.\nTwo hit shows.\nTwo versions of \"The Gong Show\" aired at first: A nighttime version, hosted by radio announcer Gary Owens, and a daytime version, hosted by Barris himself. Barris later took over the nighttime version also. Each version worked the same, but featured different judges and performers. A live band played music for the performances. Live audiences attended each show, and cheered on the acts they liked. When they did not like an act, they would call on the judges to \"Gong 'em!\" If a judge sounded the gong, the act had to stop, and lost their chance for a prize. The performer who rated highest with the judges won a cash prize. (The \"prize\" was mostly for show; all the performers were paid the same, whether they won or not.)\nCelebrities.\nMany celebrities served as judges on the show, including Jaye P. Morgan and Jamie Farr. One well-known comedian, Murray Langston, performed on the show with a paper bag over his head. He called himself the \"Unknown Comic\", and told simple jokes when he appeared onstage. Langston won his round, and was invited back to appear other times. Many people wondered who the Unknown Comic really was. Langston later admitted he had appeared on the show just for some quick cash, because he needed money. He hid his identity so his performance would not hurt his comedy career, since he was already well-known.\nNo real stars were made by \"Gong Show\" appearances, but thousands of people got a chance to perform on national television, and others got the chance to watch. One popular member of the show's cast was \"Gene, Gene, the Dancing Machine\", who would dance in front of the show's band between acts. Barris himself was also well-liked by the audience. He treated all the performers on the show kindly and seriously, and hosted the show like it was a party.\nMany of the acts who auditioned for \"The Gong Show\" were not suitable for television, or for times when children or families might watch. Some of these acts appeared in a movie, which was released in 1980.\nThe end.\nIn time, new and unusual acts became hard to find, as more people performed on \"The Gong Show\". The television audience also lost interest. Barris was tired from working on the show. \"The Gong Show\" was cancelled by 1982. Reruns came later, but they also stopped with time.\nToday, \"The Gong Show\" is remembered fondly by the people who watched it. Amateur talent contests still sometimes feature a gong, for when an act does not go over well. (They are rarely used.)\nBarris wrote a memoir, titled \"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind\", that talked about his time on the show."}

One of his songs, \"Palisades Park\", was a hit record for Freddy Cannon, a popular singer.\nBarris got his start in television as a page and later staffer at NBC in New York, and eventually worked backstage at the TV music show \"American Bandstand\".\nBarris was promoted to the daytime programming division at ABC in Los Angeles and was put in charge of deciding which game shows ABC would air. Before long, Barris admitted to his bosses that he disliked all the shows he was given to choose from, and believed he could make better ones. They suggested that he quit his programming job and become a show producer himself.\nGame Show Career.\nBarris first became successful during 1965 with his first game show creation \"The Dating Game\" on ABC. The next year Barris began \"The Newlywed Game\".\nHe went on to create several other short-lived games for ABC in the 1960s and for syndication in the 1970s, all of which revolved around a common theme: the game play normally derived its interest (and oftentimes, humor) from the excitement, vulnerability, embarrassment, or anger of female contestants or participants in the game. \nBarris became a public figure in a big way in 1976, when he produced\u00a0- and served as the host of the talent contest spoof \"The Gong Show\", which he packaged in partnership with TV producer Chris Bearde. The show's cult stature far outstripped the two years it spent on NBC (1976-78) and the four years it ran in syndication (1976-1980).\nLater years.\nAfter \"The Gong Show\" went off the air, Barris kept a lower profile (did not attract as much attention), but still worked in television. In the 1980s, he published a memoir, \"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind\". Barris claimed in the book to have been a CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) agent and assassin, who regretted his earlier life. He also regretted making \"puerile\" (childish) television shows, that catered to poor taste. It was republished in the 1990s.\nMany people believe \"Confessions\" does not tell a true story. Others are not sure if it is fact or fiction. Some, including celebrities who knew Barris, do not know or care, and enjoy his stories as entertainment. The CIA itself denies Barris ever worked for them.\nGeorge Clooney made \"Confessions\" into a movie, starring Sam Rockwell, Drew Barrymore and Julia Roberts.\nPersonal life.\nBarris was married to Lyn Levy from 1957 until they divorced in 1976. He later married Robin Altman from 1980 until they divorced in 1999. He later married Mary Rudolph in 2000. Barris had one child with Levy.\nDeath.\nBarris died on March 21, 2017 of natural causes at his home in Palisades, New York at the age of 87."}

Other kinds of arthritis include psoriatic arthritis and septic arthritis (when an area is invaded by bacteria).\nOsteoarthritis is when the cartilage in between two bones breaks down. This condition causes the bones to rub together. This kind of arthritis is more common in elderly people. The most common places for this arthritis are the hips, knees, lower back, and neck. There are medicines that can relieve the pain and prevent disability.\nRheumatoid arthritis is caused by autoimmunity. Autoimmunity is when the body's immune system attacks its own tissues. The most common places for this arthritis is in the wrists and the knuckles. It usually starts between the ages of 20 and 40. Children and elderly people can also get this kind of arthritis. There are medicines to slow down the process of this disease. There are also some medicines to relieve pain. It is important to treat this kind of arthritis early.\nGout causes severe pain and swelling. Gout normally affects the big toe. It can also affect heels, ankles, hands, wrists or elbows. Gout is from high levels of uric acid that is in the blood. Gout can cause urate crystals to settle in tissues of joints. Gout creates stone-like shapes. The stone-like shapes build in joints, ligaments and tendons.\nArthritis is more common in older people. Both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis affect women more often than men.\nAnimals, including dogs and cats, can also get arthritis."}

He reigned from AD 37. After only four years, he was assassinated by members of his bodyguard and the Roman Senate. During his reign, many innocent people were killed without fair trials. Even with all that, he was popular with the Roman public in his time.\nLife.\nCaligula's father Germanicus was the nephew and adoptive son of emperor Tiberius. He was a very successful general. He was one of Rome's most beloved public figures.\nWhen Germanicus died at Antioch in 19 AD, his mother Agrippina the Elder returned to Rome with her six children. She had a bitter feud with Tiberius. That eventually led to the destruction of her family. Caligula was the only male survivor. In 31, he joined the emperor on the island of Capri. Tiberius had gone there five years earlier. When Tiberius died in 37, Caligula became emperor.\nThere are few surviving sources on Caligula's reign. He is described as a noble and moderate ruler during the first two years of his rule. After this, the sources focus upon his cruelty, extravagance, and sexual perversity, presenting him as an insane tyrant.\nCaligula worked to give more authority to the emperor. He put a lot of his effort into ambitious construction projects and luxurious dwellings for himself. He started the construction of two new aqueducts in Rome: the \"Aqua Claudia\" and the \"Anio Novus\". During his reign, the empire took over the Kingdom of Mauretania and made it into a province.\nIn early 41, Caligula was assassinated. There was a conspiracy involving officers of the Praetorian Guard, members of the Roman Senate and members of the imperial court. After Caligula's death, the conspirators' tried to bring back the Roman Republic, but they were unsuccessful. The Praetorian Guard declared Caligula's uncle Claudius emperor in his place.\nAncestry.\nAncestors of Caligula\nInsanity?\nThere are stories about Caligula that show cruelty and insanity. He was accused of killing just for amusement. He was accused of committing incest with his sisters and prostituting them with other men. He was accused of turning the palace into a brothel.\nCaligula appeared in public dressed as various gods. He demanded to be worshipped as a god. There was a legend that he appointed a horse to the priesthood.\nIt is difficult to know anything for certain about Caligula. Only two sources from his time still exist. Those are the works of Philo and Seneca. They give mostly anecdotes. At one time, there were detailed histories on Caligula. Now they are lost. Caligula's sister, Agrippina the Younger, wrote an autobiography which certainly had a lot of information about Caligula's reign. It is also lost. No surviving source paints Caligula in a favorable light. It is not known whether Caligula was insane.\nRelics.\nIn 2017 a mosaic from one of Caligula's Lake Nemi pleasure ships was discovered in New York City\nOther websites.\n "}

He wrote a very large number of chansons (French songs). He also wrote some masses.\nArcadelt's music became extremely popular because it was quite simple and easy to sing with beautiful melodies that people could remember.

{"id": "93639", "revid": "7889940", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=93639", "title": "Respiratory system", "text": "The respiratory system, also called the gas exchange system, is the body getting rid of carbon dioxide and taking in oxygen. Carbon dioxide, a waste product, goes out of the body. Oxygen, which the body needs, comes in. The lungs are the main organ to do this. In other words, the process in which oxidation of organic compounds occurs in cell and energy is released is called the Respiratory system. \nThe first step in this process is breathing in air, or inhaling. Inhalation means bringing air rich in oxygen into the body. Exhalation means giving out air rich in carbon dioxide from the body. The second step is gas exchange in the lungs where oxygen is diffused into the blood and the carbon dioxide diffuses out of the blood. The third process is cellular respiration, which produces the chemical energy that the cells in the body need, and carbon dioxide. Finally, the carbon dioxide from cellular respiration is breathed out of body from the lungs.\nBreathing.\nBreathing is the first step in respiration. For respiration to happen, the body needs a constant supply of oxygen, which is done by breathing. Inhalation is the breathing in of air. To inhale, the lungs expand, decreasing the air pressure in the lungs. This is caused by two actions. The diaphragm (a sheet of muscular tissue that separates the lungs from the abdomen) is pulled downward. Also the muscles between the ribs contract to expand the chest. Both of these actions expand the lungs. To fill the enlarged lungs, air from outside at higher pressure comes rushing into the area of low pressure in the lungs. Air first passes through the nose and mouth, then through the larynx (voice box), then down the trachea (windpipe), and into the lungs.\nThe lungs are made of many tubes or branches. As air enters the lungs, it first goes through branches called the bronchi, then through smaller branches called bronchioles, and finally into the air sacs. Gas exchange occurs in the air sacs where oxygen is exchanged with carbon dioxide. \nThe carbon dioxide in the air sacs now need to be exhaled, or breathed out. In the reverse process to inhaling, the diaphragm and the rib muscles relax, causing the lungs to be smaller. As the air pressure in the lungs is greater when the lungs are smaller, air is forced out. The air sacs are able to contract and expand because they are coated with a lubricant, surfactant, this lubricant helps the air sacs inflate while also preventing the collapse of the lungs during deflation.The exhaled air has a high concentration of carbon dioxide and a low concentration of oxygen. The maximum volume of air that can be breathed in and breathed out is called the vital capacity of the lungs and is up to five liters.\nGas exchange.\nThe inhaled air goes down to the air sacs at the end of each bronchiole. The air sacs are called alveoli \u2014 they have a large surface area, and are moist, thin, and close to a blood supply. The inhaled air has a much greater concentration of oxygen than carbon dioxide whilst the blood flowing to the lungs has a more carbon dioxide than oxygen. This creates a concentration gradient between the air in the air sacs and the blood, meaning there is more oxygen in the air than the blood. \nAs the membrane, oxygen can easily diffuse in and out. Oxygen at high concentration in the air sacs diffuses into the blood where oxygen concentration is low, and carbon dioxide at high concentration in the blood diffuses into the air sacs where carbon dioxide concentration is low. The oxygen in the blood enters the circulatory system and is used by the cells in the body. The carbon dioxide in the air sacs are exhaled out of the body."}

There are many kinds but the term often means the machine that Niklaus Otto invented. In this kind, fire makes pressure increase inside a sealed box (cylinder). The pressure pushes a rod which is attached to a wheel. The rod pushes the wheel and makes it spin around. The spinning wheel is attached to other wheels, such as four car wheels, with a belt or a chain. The engine is very strong and can make all the wheels move. \nThere can be many configurations of internal combustion engines such as the single piston engine, the inline engine, the flat engine, the V engine, the VR engine, the W engine, the X engine, the U engine, the H engine, the horizontal K engine, the opposed piston engine, the delta engine, the Wankel or rotary engine and the radial engine which is commonly used in planes. \nThe most common layouts among these engines are the V layout, and the inline layout. In the V engine, the pistons are aligned in a V shape if you look at them from the front. There can be V twin engines, with 2 pistons, V3 engines, V4 engines, V6 engines, V8 engines, V10 engine, V12 engines, V14 engines, V16 engines, V18 engine, V20 engine and V24 engines. The VR layout is the same as a V layout except the angle between the V shape is smaller. In inline engines, the pistons are aligned in a straight line. There can be inline 1 engines, also called a singular piston engine, all the way up to a straight 14 which was mainly used in older models of cars. Flat engines are the same as inline engines but are aligned horizontally. \nW, X, U, H, Horizontal K, Delta and opposed piston engines all have different configurations. In the W engine, the pistons are aligned in a W shape if looked at from the front. The Bugatti Chiron, one of the fastest cars in the world, features a W engine. The pistons in a X are aligned to look like an X from the front. In the U engine, there a 2 inline engine with separate crankshafts and a shared output shaft. When looked at from the front of the engine block, it resembles a U shape. H engines are U engines except there are 2 more inline engines attached to the bottom of the existing inline engines from the U engine. The H and the U layout can be configured vertically or horizontally. In delta engines, the pistons are aligned in a triangle shape. However, there are 2 pistons per cylinder/combustion chamber, and therefore the minimum amount of pistons in a delta engine is 6. Horizontal K engines persist of 2 flat pistons facing opposite each other at the bottom and a V engine above them, making them look like a horizontal K. The Opposed piston engines also have 2 pistons per cylinder. They can be aligned Vertically or Horizontally. When there are only 2 pistons in the engine, they can also be called boxer engine. \nRadial engines are commonly used in planes but can be rarely used in cars. An example of this is the Porsche 356 and the 1939 Plymouth Pickup. The pistons in are radial engine are aligned in a star shape. When having multiple sets of pistons, the engines can be stacked beside each other. \nRotary/Wankel engines work the same as a piston engine except it doesn't have a piston but instead has a rotor that also cycles through the 4 main stages of engines (intake, compression, combustion and exhaust). \nAs well as there are many engine layouts, there are many different parts to an engine. Some if these include pistons, camshafts, crankshafts, timing belts, valves and more. All parts of an engine need to be fully functional for it to work and all parts have a separate role. An engine works by first sending power from the car battery to the ignition coil which then causes an engine spark. The spark then ignites combustion in the cylinders and the combustion starts the engine. \nThere can be petrol or diesel engines in a car. In petrol or gasoline engines, it is required to have an ignition system to burn the fuel and air mixture. However, in diesel engines, the an ignition system is not required to burn the fuel but instead, they use a different type of fuel called diesel, similar to heating oil, and the fuel is burnt through extreme compression. \nFor extra power, more air is needed to increase the energy evolved per unit of fuel. This is where forced induction must take place. There are some ways of creating forced induction such as turbochargers and superchargers. Turbochargers rely on the volume and velocity of the exhaust to spin the turbine wheel in the middle of the turbocharger. Turbochargers should consume less power from the engine than superchargers and therefore suffer bad throttle response. This delay can also be referred to as turbo lag. Smaller turbochargers spool quickly and deliver more boost pressure at lower engine speeds but suffers at higher RPMs. On the contrary, Bigger turbos can deliver more power at higher revs but suffers low throttle response. There can be many turbocharger and the most common amount being 1 and 2. Superchargers on the other hand, have close to no lag time as the compressor is constantly spinning proportionally to the engine speed. However, they require torque from the engine to operate. Some common types of superchargers are the Roots-type supercharger, a Screw-type supercharger, and a Centrifugal-type supercharger. In a Roots-type supercharger there are paddles on two drums that are continuously rotating, that forces air into the intake. The Roots-type supercharger is a positive displacement device and therefore has the advantage of producing the same pressure ratio at any engine speed. A Screw-type supercharger, like the Roots-type supercharger, is a positive displacement device. They consist of 2 screws that compresses the air and are more efficient than roots type as they create a cooler air output than a roots supercharger but are more difficult to manufacture. A centrifugal-type supercharger, is not a positive displacement device. Although it looks like a turbocharger, they are very different as the power source of the centrifugal supercharger is horsepower from the engines crankshaft whereas a turbocharger uses the exhaust gas to spin the compressor. \nWhen using forced induction, the air temperature rises dramatically. To cool the air at higher temperatures, an intercooler is needed. An intercooler cools the air before it enters the cylinder (combustion chamber) using air or water. When hot air enters the combustion chamber, it decreases the fuel efficiency as warm air holds less oxygen than cool air. An air to air intercooler uses the cool air from outside to cool the existing hot air as it enters the intercooler. The more surface area the intercooler has the cooler the air can get. There are 2 types of air to air intercooler, the bar and plate intercooler and the tube and fin intercooler. Bar and plate intercoolers can cool the air to lower temperature but a tube and fin intercooler can cost less and also weight less. In air to water intercoolers, instead of using air from outside, it uses a cool liquid to cool the air as it passes though and then uses a radiator to cool the cooling liquid. Air to water intercooler are more complex, heavier and more expensive than air to water intercoolers but can be more efficient than them. \nEngines need oil to make them slippery or the moving parts would grind together and stick. Parts of a car engine are measured to 0.01 of a millimetre and some engine parts fit together very tightly. \nInternal differs from external combustion where the fire is outside the engine, such as a steam engine. \nMost road vehicles use the internal combustion engine today, and most of those use the four-stroke engine.\nGas turbines are internal combustion engines that work continuously, not by strokes. Rocket engines and guns are internal combustion engines but they do not turn wheels."}

One of them is not open if hockey is played, because a hockey rink is larger than a basketball court. The other sections used to have different colors. There were red, orange, yellow, brown and blue seats. However, the fans of the New York Rangers only wanted to sit in the blue seats. They did not want to use any of the other sections. They even did not let other fans use the blue seats. For this reason, the MSG does not use these colors today.

Non-building structures, such as towers, are not included in this list (see list of tallest buildings and structures).\nHistorically, the world's tallest man-made structure was the ancient tomb - the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt, which held the position for over 3,800 years until the construction of Lincoln Cathedral in England in 1311. Until the completion of the Washington Monument in 1884 the world's tallest buildings were Christian churches and cathedrals in Europe. The early skyscraper was pioneered in Chicago with the Home Insurance Building in 1885, forming the basis for which the United States would hold the position of the world's tallest building throughout the 20th century until 1998, when the Petronas Towers were completed. Since then only two buildings have held the title: Taipei 101 in 2004 and Burj Khalifa in 2010.\nSince the beginning of the 21st century, the US, the Middle East, China, and Southeast Asia have experienced booms in skyscraper construction.\nRanking criteria and alternatives.\nThe international non-profit organization Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) was formed in 1969 and announces the title of \"The World's Tallest Building\" and sets the standards by which buildings are measured. It maintains a list of the 100 tallest completed buildings in the world. The organization currently ranks Burj Khalifa in Dubai as the tallest at . However, the CTBUH only recognizes buildings that are complete, and some buildings included within the lists in this article are not considered finished by the CTBUH.\nIn 1996, as a response to the dispute as to whether the Petronas Towers or the Sears Tower was taller, the council listed and ranked buildings in four categories:\nSpires are considered integral parts of the architectural design of buildings, changes to which would substantially change the appearance and design of the building, whereas antennas may be added or removed without such consequences. The Petronas Towers, with their spires, are thus ranked higher than the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower) with its antennas, despite the Petronas Towers's lower roofs and lower highest point.\nUntil 1996, the world's tallest building was defined by the height to the top of the tallest architectural element, including spires but not antennae. This led to a rivalry between the Bank of Manhattan Building and the Chrysler Building. The Bank of Manhattan Building (i.e. 40 Wall Street) employed only a short spire and was tall and had a much higher top occupied floor (the second category in the 1996 criteria for tallest building). In contrast, the Chrysler Building employed a very large spire secretly assembled inside the building to claim the title of world's tallest building with a total height of , although it had a lower top occupied floor and a shorter height when both buildings' spires were excluded.\nUpset by Chrysler's victory, Shreve &amp; Lamb, the consulting architects of the Bank of Manhattan Building, wrote a newspaper article claiming that their building was actually the tallest, since it contained the world's highest usable floor, at . They pointed out that the observation deck in the Bank of Manhattan Building was nearly above the top floor in the Chrysler Building, whose surpassing spire was strictly ornamental and inaccessible.\nAt present, the Burj Khalifa tops the list by some margin, regardless of which criterion is applied.\nTallest buildings in the world.\n, this list includes all 75 buildings (completed and architecturally topped out) which reach a height of or more, as assessed by their highest architectural feature. Of these, 37 are in China. Six of the last seven buildings to have held the record as 'tallest building' are still found in the list, with the exception being the North Tower of the original World Trade Center at after its destruction in the September 11 attacks of 2001. If the twin towers had not been destroyed and One World Trade Center never built, the WTC towers would rank 34 and 35 on the list today.\nAlternative measurements.\nHeight to pinnacle (highest point).\nThis measurement disregards distinctions between architectural and non-architectural extensions, and simply measures to the highest point. This measurement is useful for air traffic obstacle determinations, and is also a wholly objective measure. However, this measurement includes extensions that are easily added, removed, and modified from a building and are independent of the overall structure.\nThis measurement only recently came into use, when the Petronas Towers passed the Sears Tower (now named Willis Tower) in height. The former was considered taller because its spires were considered architectural, while the latter's antennae were not. This led to the split of definitions, with the Sears Tower claiming the lead in this and the height-to-roof (now highest occupied floor) categories, and with the Petronas claiming the lead in the architectural height category.\nIf the World Trade Center towers were still standing today they would occupy numbers 12 (North Tower at ) and 37 on the list (or 11 and 36, for it can be assumed the rebuilt One World Trade Center would have never been built).\nHeight to occupied floor.\nThis height is measured from the level of the lowest, significant, open-air, pedestrian entrance to the highest occupied floor within the building.\nBuildings under construction.\nThis is a list of buildings taller than that are currently under construction. On-hold buildings whose construction was interrupted after it had reached a significantly advanced state are also listed.\nList by continent.\nThe following list shows the tallest completed buildings located in each continent listed by greatest to least height (click on name of continent for continent-specific list):"}

At its first concert the orchestra played a very long programme which included Beethoven\u2019s \"Symphony No. 5\" conducted by Ureli Corelli Hill. The musicians worked as a cooperative or \"communistic\" society. This meant that the musicians themselves made up the rules about how the orchestra should be run: who would become a member, which music would be performed, and who would conduct. At the end of each season they divided any money the orchestra had earned amongst themselves.\nBeethoven's ninth and a new home, 1846.\nThe orchestra were a great success, but they needed a new concert hall. They gave a fund-raising concert which included Beethoven's \"Symphony No. 9\". It was the first time it had ever been played in America. The concert took place in Castle Garden on the southern tip of Manhattan. There were about 400 performers in the orchestra and choir. The words that the choir sings were translated into English. It was the first time this work had been sung in English anywhere in the world. However, the tickets cost a lot of money: US$2.00 each, so not so many people came. It was some time before the orchestra got their concert hall. Many people thought Beethoven's 9th symphony was a strange piece of music because the choir only sing in the last movement which is called \"Ode to Joy\". In 1865 Theodore Eisfeld conducted the Orchestra\u2019s memorial concert for the recently assassinated Abraham Lincoln, but the last movement was not performed because it was thought that the \"Ode to Joy\" was not suitable for the sad occasion.\nCompetition from another orchestra, 1878.\nLeopold Damrosch, who had been Franz Liszt's concertmaster at Weimar, was the orchestra\u2019s conductor for the 1876-1877 season. But the public did not like him, so he started his own orchestra: the Symphony Society of New York. When he died in 1885, his 23-year-old son Walter Johannes Damrosch took over and continued the competition with the old Philharmonic. It was Walter who would make the rich Scotsman Andrew Carnegie realize that New York needed a really good concert hall and on May 5, 1891 both Walter and the Russian composer Tchaikovsky conducted at the first concert of the city's new Music Hall. A few years later this new hall was renamed Carnegie Hall after the man who gave the money for it to be built.\nTheodore Thomas began conducting the Philharmonic in 1877 and made it a very good orchestra. In 1891 Thomas left New York to found the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.\nAnton Seidl conducted the orchestra until 1898. Seidl had worked as Wagner's assistant and was famous for conducting Wagner\u2019s music. He gave the first performance of Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's Ninth Symphony \"From the New World.\" Many people were sad when Seidl suddenly died in 1898 from food poisoning at the age of 47. Twelve thousand people applied for tickets to his funeral at the Metropolitan Opera House at 39th Street and Broadway and the streets were jammed with people and traffic.\nNew management, 1909.\nIn 1909 the orchestra was organized differently. Instead of a cooperative, they were run by a small group of people called . They persuaded Gustav Mahler to be principal conductor. Instead of 18 concerts a season they gave 54, which included a tour of New England. Mahler was used to conducting opera, but now he could conduct symphonies, and he introduced audiences to his own compositions. During his time the orchestra were given regular salaries for the first time.\nBetween 1911 and 1920, the Philharmonic's conductor was Josef Stransky, who led every single one of the orchestra's concerts during this period.\nMergers and outreach, 1921.\nWhen the Philharmonic joined together with the National Symphony in 1921, they had the Dutch conductor Willem Mengelberg. He stayed there for nine years, although other conductors, including Bruno Walter, Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler, Igor Stravinsky, and Arturo Toscanini, led about half the concerts. They started to have an outdoor symphony series, playing low-priced summer concerts at Lewisohn Stadium in upper Manhattan. In 1920 the orchestra hired Henry Hadley as \"associate conductor\" to perform concerts which included works by American composers.\nIn 1924, the Young People's Concerts were started, and soon grew to 15 concerts per season by the end of the 1920s. They started to make recordings. In 1928 they joined together with another orchestra, the New York Symphony Society. Toscanini conducted the newly organized orchestra, and continued until 1936.\nThe War years, 1940.\nThe English conductor John Barbirolli and the Pole Artur Rodzinski, were joint replacements for Toscanini in 1936. The next year Barbirolli was made the main conductor, a post he held until the spring of 1941. In 1943, Rodzinski became conductor. He had also been conducting on the Sunday afternoon radio broadcast when CBS listeners around the country heard the announcer break in on Arthur Rubinstein's performance of Brahms's Second Piano Concerto to tell them about the attack on Pearl Harbor.\nArtur Rodzinski, Bruno Walter, and Sir Thomas Beecham made a series of recordings with the Philharmonic for Columbia Records during the 1940s.\nThe Telegenic Age, 1950.\nLeopold Stokowski and Dimitri Mitropoulos were the orchestra\u2019s two conductors in 1949, with Mitropoulos becoming conductor in 1951. Mitropoulos often conducted new music and music that was not well known. In 1957, Mitropoulos and Leonard Bernstein served together as Principal Conductors until, in the course of the season, Bernstein was made conductor, becoming the first American-born-and-trained conductor of the Philharmonic.\nLeonard Bernstein was Music Director for 11 seasons. Many new things happened during this time. Two television series were started on CBS: the \"Young People's Concerts\" and \"Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic.\" The first of these started in 1958. It was a new idea and it won every award for educational television. Bernstein continued the orchestra's recordings with Columbia Records until he retired as music director in 1969. He got lots of composers, especially American composers such as Aaron Copland, to write new works for the orchestra.\nIn 1971 Pierre Boulez became the first Frenchman to have the job of conductor of the Philharmonic. Boulez had new ideas about music to be performed. He was a composer himself and often performed modern music.\nAmbassadors abroad.\nZubin Mehta became conductor in 1978. He, too, conducted a lot of new music. \nKurt Masur, who had often been conducting the Philharmonic since 1981, became conductor in 1991. During his time he included a series of free Memorial Day Concerts at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine and annual concert tours abroad that included the orchestra's first trip to mainland China. His stayed until 2002, and was then given the honorary title \u201cMusic Director Emeritus of the Philharmonic\u201d.\nOn 26 February 2008 the Philharmonic gave a concert in Pyongyang in North Korea. It was the first time since the end of the Korean War in 1953 that there had been an important cultural visit from the United States to North Korea.\nA third century, 2000.\nIn September 2002, 60 years after conducting the Orchestra at the age of twelve at Lewisohn Stadium, Lorin Maazel became conductor of the Philharmonic. In his first subscription week he conducted the first ever performance of John Adams' \"On the Transmigration of Souls\". This work had been composed in memory of those who lost their lives on September 11, 2001. He performed new music as well as music of the well-known composers. He stayed with the orchestra until the end of the 2008-2009 season."}

The smaller English army won against the much larger French army. New tactics and weapons make this an important battle in the history of warfare because the English used longbows to win against French knights. The longbow was a faster weapon to fire than the French and Genoan crossbow and could send arrows farther than the crossbow could and with more force. Before this battle during the Middle Ages, knights had been the most important part of an army. Because of this change some historians call this battle the beginning of the end of chivalry.\nThe Battle.\nIn the battle, the French knights, protected by chain mail reinforced with metal plate, were nearly exhausted by charging several miles into the battle (against their king's wishes). Their horses had to walk through deep mud and charge up a hill into English and Welsh arrow storm. They were cut down. Many French nobles died.\nThe knights' horses were barely protected at all. The storm of arrows killed or disabled the knights' mounts, and left the knights floundering in the mud on foot beneath a hail of arrows.\nThe bolts (heavy arrows) of the Genoese crossbowmen at the forefront of the battle could not reach the English. They fell short because the crossbow strings were wet. The archers had also misjudged the range and shot too early and too low. The English, controlling the high ground, were able to run a short distance down the hill and pick off the Genoese with volleys of arrows. As the Genoese attempted to retreat, they were cut down by the French knights, who thought the withdrawal was cowardly. This wasted the first charge of French cavalry, and left them disorganized for the charge on the English.\nIn a strong defensive position, Edward III ordered that everyone fight on foot. He split the army in three divisions, one commanded by his sixteen-year-old son, Edward, the Black Prince. The archers were set in a 'V-formation' along the top of the hill. While they waited, the English built a system of ditches, pits and caltrops, to hurt and bring down the enemy cavalry."}

He did this, because he did not want to undermine the President's desire for a unanimous decision. \nWhen it had become clear the invasion had failed, Schlesinger later wrote: \"In the months after the Bay of Pigs, I bitterly reproached myself for having kept so silent during those crucial discussions in the cabinet room ... I can only explain my failure to do more than raise a few timid questions by reporting that one's impulse to blow the whistle on this nonsense was simply undone by the circumstances of the discussion.\"\nSchlesinger contributed many things to liberal theory. He was mostly for the kind of liberalism Kennedy did. He was admired for his wit, scholarship, and devotion to delineating the history and nature of liberalism. Since 1990 he had been a critic of multiculturalism.\nHe popularized the term \"imperial presidency\" during the Nixon administration by writing the book \"The Imperial Presidency\"."}

It was first made in the early 2000s for SWAT teams and special forces in situations usually involving terrorists and hostages.\nOverview.\nIts designers were two former Israeli Army senior officers. It was made with money invested by American investors. It has several different types. So far, the types made are the Standard, the 40\u00a0mm grenade launcher, the APR, and an Anti-tank version. It works because its many parts are either on the front or the back end, which are linked by a steel hinge. It is manufactured by Corner Shot Holdings, LLC, a company in Miami with offices in Israel. Units have been sold in 15 countries. The CornerShot was recently evaluated by the UK Ministry of Defence.\nForms and variations.\nThe CornerShot is available in several different types. A standard pistol version is available, along with a 40\u00a0mm grenade launcher. Because they are fitted with very good digital cameras, any type can also be used as a tool to spy with. All the models come with the same camera and 2.5\u00a0inch color LCD screen. this provides video and a sighting system with transmission capability. The flashlight and camera let it work in either day or night. A variety of cameras, as well as a folding stocks, are available. An accessory rail is standard.\nStandard.\nThe standard CornerShot can put a normal semi-automatic pistol in the front part of the weapon. It has a remote linkage to the trigger mechanism in the rear part. The mechanism has a trigger pull of 21\u00a0newtons (4.7 lbf). It is 820\u00a0millimetres (32.67\u00a0in) long, with a weight of 3.86\u00a0kilograms (8.5\u00a0lb).\n40\u00a0mm grenade launcher.\nThe 40\u00a0mm Grenade Launcher is a breech-loading, single shot grenade launcher. Manually operated, or it can only fire one round at a time. It fires all 40\u00a0mm grenades, less-deadly and non-deadly ammunition (or what a gun fires), and tear/irritant gas capsules (the container in a liquid or gas is stored). Spent ammunition is ejected for easier reloading. The same system is available in 37\u00a0mm size for police. The 40\u00a0mm model has a rifling of 1:1.224, is 900\u00a0mm long, and weighs 4.4\u00a0kg (9.5\u00a0lb). The muzzle velocity is 74.7\u00a0m/s (M-406 grenade). Its range for normal fire, single target is 150\u00a0meters. For area coverage, with fragmentation munitions, or ammunition that blows apart when it hits its target, is 350\u00a0meters.\nAssault Pistol Rifle (or APR).\nThe Assault Pistol Rifle mounts an assault pistol in the front part of the weapon to allow the use of rifle bullets. It fires 5.56\u00a0mm ammunition. The APR pistol can be removed from the CornerShot frame.\nCornerShot Panzerfaust (or CSP).\nIt was first shown at the Eurosatory 2004 military trade show in Paris. The model for use against armored vehicles is designed to fire Panzerfaust anti-tank rockets. It can turn 90\u00a0degrees instead of the standard 60\u00a0degrees.\nHow it works.\nIn the standard version a pistol is mounted in the front end of the weapon, which bends horizontally (like a door does) at a mid-gun sixty-degree hinge. There is a digital camera and a flashlight attached to the barrel in the bayonet position. On the butt side of the hinge are the trigger, camera screen (which is on a horizontal hinge just like the mid-gun hinge but it is off of the left side of the gun), and controls for the camera and light.\nSimilar weapons.\nThe Krummlauf was a bent barrel designed for the Sturmgewehr 44. It was used by Germans in World War II. It allowed for looking and firing around corners with its 30 degree barrel and a periscope-style sight."}

The lowest two levels of the German government are called local government. The five levels of German government are all legally independent. This means that each level of government has a separate job in Germany. The German constitution (the Grundgesetz) lists the five levels of government and says what each level should do. \nThe five levels are:\nSome states have \"Regierungsbezirke\" which are a group of counties and cities in an area to help run certain tasks across the area.\nOther states have \"\u00c4mte\" which is a collection of municipalities (local governments) in a district. They might do this if the local governments are too small to run some local services.\nRegierungsbezirke and \u00c4mte are not guaranteed by the constitution, they are a way of helping the various levels of government to do their job.\n\"Subsidiarity\".\nThe idea of subsidiarity means that government jobs should be done by the lowest possible level.\nThere are two types of tasks (jobs) for a municipality. \"Voluntary\" which a town or municipality can do if it wants, and \"mandatory\", which are things that a federal or state law says the local government has to do.\nSetting up a theatre, a museum, a sports field or a meeting hall is a voluntary task. If the local government can afford to set these things up, the \"Land\" (state) cannot stop them. Also the \"Land\" (state) cannot order the local government to set these things up.\nThe mandatory self-government tasks are things which a local government must do itself, or must get someone else to do for it. For example, one of the most important jobs of any local government is to prove its citizens (people who live there) with water, electricity, heating, and gas, as well as wastewater services and waste removal.\nA council could run its own waterworks or join with others to share a larger facility. Modern electricity supply means that a council does not have to run their own power station anymore. But they must help private companies get the electricity supply to local houses and factories.\nTransferred tasks.\nAlthough the Federation or state might have the right to control some things, the idea of subsidiarity means that they are \"administered\" (carried out) at the lowest possible level. For example, marriage ceremonies and issuing birth and death certificates are arranged by the town registrar, the Federation and the Land arrange legal and expert supervision so that the task is done properly and is the same across Germany.\nOther transferred tasks include:\nRunning local government.\nWho runs the town or district government depends on where in Germany the town is.\nMagistrat system.\nThe town council, or town council meeting is responsible for all jobs not given to the \"magistrat\". The magistrat is the executive responsible for administering services. It is chosen by the town council, and can have both professional and honorary members. The mayor is head of the magistrate, but not of the town council meeting. The mayor is chosen separately by the people not the council. the system is only used in Hesse. It is the oldest system, and the only system where a group of elected people are responsible for the administration, instead of just one, the mayor.\nMayoral system.\nThe mayor is head of the council and the administration.\nNorth German system.\nPower is split between the mayor and the town clerk.

For thousands of years, people had noticed how traits are inherited from parents to their children. However, Mendel's work was different because he did experiments on plants, and designed those experiments very carefully.\nIn his experiments, Mendel studied how traits were passed on in pea plants. He started his crosses with plants that bred true, and counted characters that were either/or in nature (either \"tall\" or \"short\"). He bred large numbers of plants, and expressed his results numerically. He used test crosses to reveal the presence and proportion of recessive characters.\nMendelian genetics.\nLimitations.\nMendel's laws apply widely, but not to all living things. They apply to any organism which is diploid (has two paired sets of chromosomes) and which engages in sexual reproduction. They would not apply to bacteria, for example, or to asexual reproduction. They do apply to the great majority of plants and animals.\nMendel's laws.\nMendel explained the results of his experiment using two scientific laws:\nMendel's laws explained the results he got with his pea plants. Later, geneticists discovered that his laws were also true for other living things, even humans. Mendel's findings from his work on the garden pea plants helped to establish the field of genetics. His contributions were not limited to the basic rules that he discovered. Mendel's care towards controlling experiment conditions along with his attention to his numerical results set a standard for future experiments."}

In 2004 he was in the Guinness Book of World Records as the youngest person who has been to all the countries in the world. In 2006/2007 he worked for the UN.\nEducation.\nMaurizio Giuliano was born on 24 February 1975 in Milan, Italy, with a lawyer as a father and a housewife as a mother. He lived in Cuba, Chile, and Indonesia, among other countries. As of 2004, he knew eight languages according to one source, while another source specified that he \"spoke\" five and had a \"passion\" for two more.\nHe went to school in Milan and Manchester, and then studied at the University of Oxford in 1996 and the University of Cambridge in 1997. At Oxford, he studied at University College to know about Oxford's inter-disciplinary course in \"Philosophy, Politics, and Economics\" (PPE), especially Latin America and eastern Europe.\nAs of 1998, he was a research fellow at the Centre for Social Studies (CESOC) in Santiago, Chile.\nWritings.\nStudy on Cuba.\nHe wrote two books and some articles on Cuban politics, especially on the US embargo (which usually stops Americans from doing business with Cubans), which he thinks (in the book \"\"La Transici\u00f3n Cubana y el \"Bloqueo\" Norteamericano\"\" and other works) is not good.\nIn an article published in the British academic journal \"Democratization\" in 1998, he focused in particular on how the US embargo against Cuba helps create \"empathy\" by third parties towards Cuba, so that Cubans think it is support for Cuba's government. So he argued that the US Government \u2013 in addition to the embargo's direct influence on supporting Cuba's regime \u2013 indirectly interferes with the possibility of improving Cuba. That is because third countries, foreign non-governmental organizations and prominent individuals lend support to Cuba's resistance to the US embargo, and this offsets external pressures for democracy, thereby allowing the Cuban regime to convert such \"empathy\" into a source of legitimacy at home.\nHis scholarly work on internal Cuban politics, notably on the 1996 purge of Havana's Centre for American Studies (CEA) (contained in the book \"El Caso CEA\" published in 1998), has been the object of academic reviews, as it exposed the internal conflicts between Cuba's political apparatus and the country's intelligentsia (most intelligent people), previously unknown.\nAccording to some reviews, the book, a work of investigative journalism helped by academic analysis, dealt a strong blow to hard-liners within the regime,\nby exposing for the first time the internal conflicts between Cuba's apparatus and its intelligentsia.\nIn 2001, Cuban exiled scholars Alberto \u00c1lvarez and Gerardo Gonz\u00e1lez, who were among those purged from the CEA, wrote the book \"\u00bf Intelectuales vs. Revoluci\u00f3n ? El caso del Centro de Estudios sobre Am\u00e9rica\", which strongly built upon Giuliano's book to offer further insights on relations between Cuba's political apparatus and the country's intellectuals.\nJournalism.\nBesides work on Cuba, other countries Giuliano covered in his journalistic work include East Timor and Myanmar (formerly known as Burma).\nIn 2000, he visited North Korea and published an essay about his visit, essentially describing his tour around the country as being like a movie made by the North Korean authorities.\nIn his journalistic work, he reportedly ran into problems with the authorities of at least two countries. In 1998, he was denied entry to Myanmar after making contact with the National League for Democracy and taking photos of its leader Aung San Suu Kyi. And on 30 October 2002, he was reportedly detained and manhandled by Israeli authorities while crossing the Allenby Bridge.\nGiuliano's writings have also included lighter topics. During his time in Kabul, for example, he wrote restaurant reviews for a local English-language magazine.\nPolitical advocacy.\nIn the early 2000s, Giuliano was a consultant for the Italian Senate's Committee on Human Rights. At that time, at least some of his writings were also intended to influence the positions of the Italian Government on certain human rights issues, as was the case with material that he wrote on North Korea.\nDevelopment career.\nIn 2004, Giuliano worked for the International Organization for Migration in the elections for Afghan refugees in Pakistan,\nand in 2005 worked in Afghanistan for the United Nations Development Programme.\nIn both cases, he was working in the field of communications with the media.\nBetween 2006 and 2008, he served with the United Nations, again in the field of media relations, in the Central African Republic,\nSudan,\nChad,\nand Cameroon following the refugee crisis caused by the battle of N'Djamena of February 2008.\nTravel.\nAccording to the Guinness Book, through his work, he had travelled to every single sovereign country in the world (which totalled 193 according to the Guinness Book) by 20 February 2004, aged 28 years and 361 days. He claimed that he had visited a total of up to 238 territories (including the 193 sovereign countries recognized by Guinness), and stated that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) had been the hardest country to get into, after numerous attempts and long waits to get a visa.\nHe started travelling at age 14, and believes that, as of 2004, he had travelled at least two million miles, including on the Trans-Siberian Railway and through 11 round-the-world air journeys. Some of his earliest journeys were to Albania and Sierra Leone in 1991, aged 16, and to Mongolia in 1992 for their national festivities Naadam. Most of his later travels were related to his journalistic work.\nOn 20 February 2004 he visited Suriname, thereby completing his visit to all sovereign nations of the world. He held a press conference there on 24 February, where he stated that he had chosen Suriname to complete his record, as the country had always fascinated him due to its richness and variety in cultures and ethnicities.\nHe then travelled from Suriname to London, with 42 passports (of which 30 were Italian and 12 British) filled with immigration stamps, in order to prove his record to Guinness World Records.\nHe claimed that most of his travels were unrelated to the record, and that only since 2001, on the suggestion of friends, did he have the Guinness Record in mind when planning his travels. In explaining his record, however, he stated that he might have an \"addiction to crossing borders\"."}
{"id": "93934", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=93934", "title": "Aang", "text": "Aang is a fictional character and the main hero in Nickelodeon's television series \"\". The character was made by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko and voiced by Zach Tyler Eisen. He has take part in all the episodes of \"Avatar\", except \"Zuko Alone\" (7th episode of ). Aang is also in the first episode, \"The Boy In The Iceberg\". Aang appears in other media, like trading cards (a card that is collected), video games, T-shirts, and web comics.\nAang is the last Airbender. They were the only race of people who could control the air. He is 112 years old. He has not become older because he had been frozen in an iceberg for 96 years, and is still like a 12 year old, because he used Avatar State to protect himself and his bison. In the second show, it is discovered that Aang is the living form of the Avatar. This is the spirit of the planet in human form. As the Avatar, Aang controls the elements and must keep the Four Nations at peace. The show follows Aang's journeys to do this.\nMost of Aang's habits, such as vegetarianism, are based on Buddhist and Taoist tradition. Aang is the series' unwilling hero. He shows hesitation when joining his friends to save the world from the Fire Nation. His \"lighthearted\" personality has been praised by critics. The creators wanted Aang to \"win enemies with his wits\" and be a \"trickster hero\".\nCreation.\nAang's character was created by Bryan Konietzko. The sketch showed a middle-aged man with an arrow on his head. Konietzko changed the character into a picture of a child with a flying bison. At the same time, Michael Dante DiMartino was interested in a documentary about explorers trapped in the South Pole. The idea caused the pair to think:\nThe plot they described relates with the first and second episodes of the series, where the \"water people\" (Katara and Sokka) find the \"air guy\" (Aang) while \"trapped in a snowy wasteland\" (the Southern Water Tribe) with \"some fire people [that] are pressing down on them\" (Fire Navy and Zuko). The creators of the show made Aang to be frozen in an iceberg for 1000 years. He was to wake inside a futuristic world, where he would have a robot named Momo and a flying bison named Appa. The creators lost interest in the theme, and changed it to 100 years of suspended animation. The robotic Momo was changed to a flying lemur, and the herd of bison was reduced to one.\nAang's character has a well grown cultural belief. According to the show's creators, \"\"Avatar\" based on the belief of Buddhism and Taoism.\" A important part of the character is his vegetarian diet, regular with Buddhism or Taoism. In the Brahmajala Sutra, a Buddhist code of ethics, vegetarianism is encouraged. In \"The King of Omashu\" (the 5th episode of first season), Aang shows his vegetarian beliefs by refusing to eat meat. Aang shows a reluctance to fight and an dislike of killing. In \"The Spirit World (Winter Solstice, Part 1)\", Aang gets into a fight with an angry spirit who is destroying a village because the people burned his home (one forest). Instead of fighting the spirit, Aang talks with it. \nAirbending, the element that Aang mainly uses in the show, is based on Baguazhang, an \"internal\" Chinese martial art. This fighting style focuses on circular movements, and does not have many finishing moves. These characteristics were meant to show the unpredictability of air and the peaceful nature of Airbenders in the show.&lt;ref name=\"avatar2/index.jhtml\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nIn the episode \"Tales of Ba Sing Se\" (the 15th episode of ), Aang\u2019s name was written as (\u0101n \u00e1ng) in Chinese.\nIn the series.\nThe creators of the show call each a \"book\" and each episode a \"chapter\"; each of these books was take the name of element that Aang must control, except the air. Flashbacks also reveal events that happened before the show opened. In a flashback during \"The Storm\", Aang remembered the day when elder monks told him that he was the Avatar. Monk Gyatso, Aang's teacher and father-figure, said that Aang must be raised as a normal child. Nearing the end, the monks began to believe that Gyatso interfered too much, so they decide to send Aang to the Eastern Air Temple. Aang refuses to be torn away from his mentor; he writes a note for Gyatso before flying away on his bison, Appa. It is revealed in the first episodes of the show that a violent storm catches Aang and sends him into the ocean during his escape. Aang then enters the Avatar State, unknowingly, for the first time to encase himself and Appa in a frozen air bubble. An image of this air bubble, resembling an iceberg, ends the flashback.\nAfter the 100 years he was in the iceberg with his bison, the story starts when Katara and her brother Sokka free Aang and Appa in the . In the next episode, they all started the trip to the Northern Water Tribe, with hope to find a waterbending master to teach Aang and Katara how to control the water. During their journey they are chased by Zuko, the banished prince of the Fire Nation, who must capture the Avatar to return his honor. In one episode, Aang meets his previous incarnation, Avatar Roku (born on Fire Nation), who said him that he must learn all four bending arts and win Fire Lord Ozai before the end of summer. When the team, named team \"Avatar\", arrived in the Northern Water Tribe, a Waterbender named Master Pakku teaches Aang (and later Katara) waterbending. Later, in the , Aang meets Toph Bei Fong, a blind earthbending, who becomes his earthbending teacher. Later, Aang and his friends learn about the solar eclipse, which will occur before the end of the summer, and will block the Firebenders powerless. During the season finale, a guru tried to teach Aang how to open up his seven \"chakras\" in order to control the Avatar State. When Aang has a vision of Katara being in danger, he leaves the Air Temple where he is being taught before the seventh \"chakra\" is opened, locking it. He then battles in the underground caverns of Ba Sing Se. He is killed when Azula strikes him with lightning, but is brought back to life thanks to Katara's special water that has healing abilities, and also her healing abilities.\nIn the , Aang and his friends had to win a new enemy - an killer hired by Zuko who shoots with his third eye. Aang and his friends from Earth Kingdom attack the Fire Nation capital during the solar eclipse, but the invasion failed because Azula knew about it. In the next episode, Zuko offers to teach Aang firebending. Aang accepts, despite the group's strong opposition. In \"The Firebending Masters\" (the 13th episode of third season) Aang learns firebending with the help of the last two dragons.\nBefore the , he is trapped with his friends because he does not find correct he kills Ozai. After he sleepwalks into a forest, he speaks with four previous Avatars (Roku, Kyoshi, Kuruk, Yangchen), and asking for advice. Each gives him a reason to kill the Fire Lord Ozai, discouraging him. After discovering that the forest is atop a swimming lion-turtle, and receiving advice from said lion-turtle, he prepares to confront the Fire Lord. Once Ozai arrives, Aang engages him in battle. After sparing Ozai when redirecting his lightning and then being backed into a corner, Aang enters the Avatar State. The Avatar State tips the battle in Aang's favor, and makes swift work of Ozai. Using a technique taught to him by the lion-turtle, which called Energybending, Aang removes Ozai's ability to firebend, effectively eliminating the threat. Later, in the Fire Nation capital, Aang is seen in monk robes, standing beside Zuko while he become Fire Lord. He is later seen relaxing with his friends in Ba Sing Se. The series ends with Aang and Katara kissing.\nCharacteristics.\nMichael Dante DiMartino, one of the show's creators, said:\nAang is a vegetarian, as shown in \"The King of Omashu\" (the 5th episode of first season) and \"The Headband\" (the 2nd episode of third season) when he refuses to eat meat since the Air Nomads taught him that life is holy. Aang states a reluctance to fight in \"The Spirit World (Winter Solstice, Part 1)\"; Aang hopelessly negotiates with a spirit who is destroying a village instead of fighting. Due to his non-violent nature, he also shows ethical reluctance refusing to killing Firelord Ozai, and eventually strips Ozai of his bending instead of killing him. In the show, Aang has a complex network of friends extending over all four nations.\nAang, in \"The Storm\" (the 12th episode of first season), said that he wishes he had been there to help Air Nomads a century ago, but would rather live a child's carefree life. Many times in the show, Aang shows how much he cares for those are close to him. He also showed that he can act immaturely, and once tried to deceive others in order to keep the group together. In \"Bato of the Water Tribe\" (the 15th episode of first season), Aang thinks Katara and Sokka might leave to visit their father. Aang hides the map showing their father's whereabouts and lies about having it in the first place.\nIn some episodes, he shows flight abilities with airbending. One technique for this is to make a sphere of air and ride on it, which Aang calls the Air Scooter. Other methods of flying include his glider, and Appa. In the Avatar State, Aang can also fly inside a ball of air.\nReception.\nIn the show's intended demographics, Aang has been received very well. Kendall Lyons said that, \"Aang seems to be the happy kid that you can easily familiarize yourself with\", and that he \"seems to bring comfort in the most dangerous or trouble situations.\" There are many similar descriptions about Aang as a childlike character who is \"reckless and excitable\". Reviews point out that \"as the Avatar, Aang seems unstoppable, but as Aang, he is just another like an airbender\". The review says later that the show continues to focus on a more realistic character instead of a perfect one by showing many weaknesses in his character.\nOther media.\nAang's character showed in the '. He is 1 of the 4 characters of , a video game based on the first season of the show. Two sequels were made: ', a video game based on the second season of the show, and \"\", a video game based on the third season. Avatar T-shirts, some with Aang's face on them, are being sold on the Nickelodeon Shop website. Tokyopop has published a films comic (sometimes referred to as cine-manga), in which Aang is the main character, like in \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\".\nAang is in \"Escape from the Spirit World\", an online video game that is on Nickelodeon's real website. The game has some plot changes that are not in the show. The show's directors, Michael DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko, say the events are canon.\nIn 2008, M. Night Shyamalan, a film director, cast 12-year-old Tae Kwon Do practitioner Noah Ringer as Aang in the film adaptation of the series, \"The Last Airbender\". The casting of a white actor in the role of Aang (as well as a primarily Caucasian cast) in the Asian-influenced \"Avatar\" universe triggered negative reactions from some fans marked by accusations of racism, a letter-writing campaign, and a protest outside of a Philadelphia casting call for movie extras. The casting decisions were also negatively received by several critics who stated that the original casting call expressed a preference for Caucasian actors over others."}

It is named after the two heroes of the games. Right now, five games are in the series.\nWhere the games happen.\nAll of the \"Jak and Daxter\" games happen on a planet that is similar to Earth, where many creatures who look like humans with long ears live. A long time ago, beings called \"Precursors\" lived on the planet, but disappeared, and the people use the machines the Precursors left behind. Outside of cities and villages, there are many wild and dangerous animals.\nA substance called \"Eco\" is also used by the people. It can be found as gas, liquid, or even solid crystals. There are several different kinds of Eco, and all the different Ecos can do special things. Green Eco can heal injuries or damage, and Blue Eco can make things move faster. There is also Dark Eco, a dangerous kind of Eco which can kill or mutate. In the first \"Jak and Daxter\" game, \"\", the character Daxter falls into a pit full of Dark Eco and turns into an \"Ottsel\", a fictional, or not real, cross between an otter and a weasel.\nGameplay.\nWhen Naughty Dog first told people about \"Jak and Daxter\", people were very excited, because Naughty Dog had made the famous \"Crash Bandicoot\" series. \"Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy\" was one of the first video games to use something called streaming, which means that the game loads while it is being played, so there are no loading screens. It was also very similar to the games \"Super Mario 64\" and \"Banjo-Kazooie\", because players need to jump, explore, and collect a special kind of object to win the game.\nAfter \"The Precursor Legacy\", the \"Jak and Daxter\" games started to be about other things, not just jumping and finding things. \"Jak II\", the second game, gives the player guns to shoot and vehicles to drive. This is like in the \"Grand Theft Auto\" video games.\nThe first three games of the \"Jak\" series; \"Precursor Legacy\", \"Jak II\", and \"Jak 3\"; are still mainly about platforming. The player controls the character Jak or the character Daxter in jumping puzzles to get to a goal. The character can only get hit by wild animals or monsters only a few times before dying and having to start the goal over, but the character can get life back by touching Green Eco. In \"Jak 3\", the player can get armor that lets Jak be hit more before dying.\nThe player can also use attacks or guns to kill the monsters before Jak or Daxter is hit and hurt."}

The Buick Opel which was originally an Isuzu Gemini and was also offered to future GM marque Daewoo as the Maepsy (which was sold as a Saehan and later Daewoo model). Geo cars were a joint venture between GM and its Japanese partners which included Toyota, Suzuki and Isuzu. Chevrolet's revived Nova (the Corolla Sprinter) led to Chevrolet Sprint (Suzuki Cultus) and the Spectrum (Isuzu Gemini). All three cars were rebranded as Geo in 1989. Geo was cancelled in 1997 and merged into the Chevrolet brand. The Geo models were the Metro, Prizm, Storm, Tracker, and Spectrum. The Prizm was made at New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. which was jointly owned by Toyota and General Motors. While the Metro and Tracker were made at CAMI Automotive a joint venture between GM and Suzuki, and the Storm and Spectrum were made entirely in Japan by Isuzu, and because of dwindling Isuzu sales they were short-lived. Many Geo models continued as Chevrolet's and were later replaced by in-house cars (i.e. Chevrolet Cobalt (Geo Prizm), a another joint venture vehicle or inherited models from GM Daewoo/Korea."}

From 1989-1992 it was sold as a subcompact sedan and hatchback, but in 1992 it was redesigned and sold solely as a compact sedan (this was due to Toyota Corolla and Sprinter being redesigned).

{"id": "93978", "revid": "7848155", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=93978", "title": "Malware", "text": "Malware, short for malicious software, is any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer. There are different kinds of malware that can hurt computers, such as viruses, Trojan horses, spyware and ransomware. These programs can steal passwords, delete files, collect personal information, or even stop a computer from working at all. Computer security or anti-malware software is usually good at stopping malware from installing itself. When security software is not installed, malware can get into the computer. Getting rid of malware can be difficult, even when using programs designed to remove it.\nThe term \"malware\" refers only to software that is made for malicious purposes and works against users' expectations \u2014 and so does not include applications that may do unintended harm due to software bugs.\nHistory.\nPeople first started writing malware in the 1970s and early 1980s. Computers were very simple then. They did not have any interesting information for malware to take. Instead, people wrote malware for fun or just to show that they could. Even the most common piece of malware from this time did not do damage to people's computers. In fact, malware was so rare that the word \"malware\" was not coined until 1990. \nMore people started using the computers in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Computers were getting more complex and faster. People saw that they could use malware to get useful information now, like passwords and credit card information. So, more programmers started writing malware. The number of malware programs on the Internet has grown very quickly ever since then the late 1990s and is still growing today. Experts think that 31.5% of the world's computers have some type of malware installed.\nPurposes.\nThe main reason people write malware is to hurt others and make money, usually by stealing or deleting important information. The Cryptolocker computer virus, for example, makes it so a person cannot use their own computer until they pay the malware writers for a software key to unlock it. Another virus, CIH, tries to make it so the victim can never use their files or turn on their computer again. Malicious keystroke logging software remembers everything a user types in and gives it to the malware author to read.\nWorld governments have written malware to hurt their enemies. Experts think that the United States government made a virus named Stuxnet to stop an important place in Iran from working. The Chinese government probably used a virus to stop people from protesting its decisions.\nHow malware gets installed.\nThere are a lot of ways malware can get onto someone's computer. One common way is through email attachments. These attachments are usually sent from other computers that already have malware on them. When someone downloads and opens the attachment, the virus installs and uses their computer to send itself to even more people. \nAnother way malware installs itself is when a victim gets malware just by going to a website with the malware hidden on it. This is called drive-by downloading. A user does not have to click anything for their computer to get infected from a drive-by download. This kind of malware attack is usually found on websites that are not used a lot or whose security methods are very old. However, even current websites that people use all the time can host drive-by downloads when someone hacks the site. \nPeople who write malware also get their programs onto computers by attaching them to real programs that people want. This is most common with pirated programs. This is because the downloader was doing something illegal and cannot complain to the authorities without getting in trouble themselves. However, some non-piracy websites also put malware (or other unwanted programs that are almost as bad as malware) in a download with real, legal software in a process known as bundling. Computer security experts complain about websites that bundle real software with malware. Their complaints do not always stop the websites from bundling.\nKinds of malware.\nThere are many different kinds of malware. Each acts a different way.\nWhy computers get malware.\nThere are a few reasons why computers get programs a user didn't mean to install. One common reason is because of regular programs that have software bugs. Malware can use bugs, such as a buffer overflow, to make a program do something it was not designed to do. Malware can also get onto a computer if it tricks a user into putting it there themselves. This can happen when a user plugs in a USB flash drive that has a virus on it already. Malware also commonly uses social engineering to get users to run it, like pretending to be an important email attachment for work. Some malware even pretends to be an anti-malware program to get people to run it.\nHow malware is stopped.\nSince malware is such a big problem, many companies make programs to try to stop it. These anti-malware programs have a lot of different ways to find malware. One is static analysis, which looks at the source code of a program before it is run. Then, if the program is similar to malware the static analysis program has seen before, the anti-malware program will stop the code from running. Another way of finding malware is dynamic analysis. Dynamic analysis runs only part of a program it is checking. If this part of the program tries to do anything that could be bad or harmful, the anti-malware program will not let the program run.\nMalware can also be stopped without a program. This can be done by not letting a computer connect to the Internet or other computers, called creating an air gap. However, these computers can still get malware if someone puts it there another way. One example is when someone plugs in a Universal Serial Bus (USB) drive that was already plugged into a computer with a virus."}

It was started by a group of people in the year 2004. By the year 2005, Matrixism had over 300 members and it was seen in books and newspapers. There are now 16,000 members of Matrixism.\nMatrixism is a syncretic religion (a religion that joins together all religions). The words \"the matrix\" are seen in a Baha'i book from the year 1912 named \"The Promulgation (starting) of Universal (complete international) Peace\". Matrixism uses this fact to make a connection to the history of world religion but the three \"Matrix\" motion pictures are Matrixism's Bible (prime book).\nMatrixism has four beliefs called \"The Four Tenets (rules) of Matrixism\". The four rules are; 1) Belief in the prophecy of the One. 2) Use of psychedelics (mind expansion medicine) as sacrament. 3) Seeing the relative nature of the world. 4) Acting by the rules of one of the world's religions. For Matrixism April 19th is a holiday (special day) named Bicycle Day. November 22nd is another holiday for Matrixism named the Day of Remembrance and Reflection. Aldous Huxley, John F. Kennedy and C.S. Lewis all died on this day in 1963.\nThe sign for Matrixism is \u8d64, the Japanese kanji for the word \"red\". This sign was used in the computer game \"Enter the Matrix\". The color is a reference to the \"red pill\", from the motion picture \"The Matrix\", which is representative of being able to see that which is true. The word (sign) \u8d64 is also a Chinese word (character). In fact, the Japanese kanji is from a Chinese character."}

In the game series, Toad is Princess Peach's attendant. He is also a friend of Mario and Luigi. Toad first appeared in Super Mario Bros, but didn't have a name. He became a playable character in \"Super Mario Bros. 2\". He also appeared in Mario Kart, in Super Mario 64, Super Mario Galaxy and many other games. He also shares many similarities with the blue toad in New Super Mario Bros. Wii. On the television series based on the games, Toad gave Mario information and sometimes Power Stars. He was a recurring member in The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!. In that series, he would help his friends whenever they needed it. The character on the show was voiced by John Stocker. Toad looks like a small man with a mushroom-like hat. He also wears a vest and shoes.\nDevelopment.\nToad and the species were first seen in the game \"Super Mario Bros.\". Toad's design was made directly from the power up, the Super Mushroom as well as the game's general use with mushrooms. Shigeru Miyamoto, the creator of the Mario series, made a reason that Toad's creation was that of being a character that has a simplistic design; yet, still appears cute and lovely and pleases to everybody. In the game, the peaceful Toads of the Mushroom Kingdom had been turned into various objects such as bricks and pipes by the evil King Bowser; however, some of Princess Toadstool's loyal servants, known as the \"Mushroom Retainers\" were simply kidnapped. During the making of \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\", the developers at Nintendo decided between four characters to be playable in the game: Princess Peach, Toad, Wario and Waluigi (all suggestions made by fans). Two Toads (yellow and blue) were eventually included as playable characters in \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" due to their physical similarity to Mario and Luigi.\nPromotion and reception.\nToad is considered one of the major Mario series characters, because he is playable and appears in many of the games. Toad appears in lots of Mario merchandise, such as toys, plushies, and keychains, among other things. Toad is featured in Nintendo's board games such as being on the protagonist side in the Mario themed chess set, as well as being a purchasable character in the Nintendo Monopoly game. In , Toad's hat is available after getting 3000 points in Tom Nook's Point Tracking system.\n\"Black Pear Tree\", an EP by The Mountain Goats and Kaki King, features a song titled \"Thank You Mario But Our Princess is in Another Castle,\" sung from the view of Toad. Toad ranked in the seventh slot on Game Daily's top 10 Nintendo characters that deserve their own games list; the site explained that he has a strong appeal that Nintendo has yet to tap into. Toad is listed as number two in the most neglected Mario Bros. characters list as he has been described by the site to have been ignored by Nintendo for quite a while due to the lack of starring roles he gets in the more recent games. In an Oricon poll from 2008, Toad was voted as the eighth most popular video game character in Japan.

The first book was written in 1986, and the people are all animals, like mice, rats, moles, otters, stoats, and weasels. The story is about an abbey called Redwall, and the animals that live there. \"Redwall\" has been made into an opera, and an animated TV series based on three of the novels (\"Redwall\", \"Mattimeo\", and \"Martin the Warrior\"), which first aired in 1999. The books are mainly aimed at older children. There were twenty-two novels and two picture books published. The twenty-second, and last novel, \"The Rogue Crew\", was published on May 3, 2011, after Jacques' death.\nOverview.\nThe book series does not happen in one particular timeframe. Instead, it is set in many different times in the history of the world of Redwall. Some of the books focus on characters who, in another book, are historical figures (e.g., Martin the Warrior's father, Luke, in \"The Legend of Luke\"). Usually, those books are set before Redwall Abbey was started. There is a timeline in the Redwall series, but it often places the books in a completely different order than the order they were written.

Doing something that burns fuel will make carbon dioxide gas (CO2). It is the total amount of greenhouse gases produced to directly and indirectly support human activities, usually expressed in equivalent tons of carbon dioxide. Just as walking on the sand leaves a footprint, burning fuel leaves carbon dioxide in the air, which is called a carbon footprint. Total carbon footprint/emission would include energy emissions from human activities - that is, from heat, light, power and refrigeration and all transport related emissions from cars, freight and distribution. \nThe words \"carbon footprint\" are often seen in the news. They are used with the word sustainability, which means that we can keep doing something without making something bad happen. That is, if there is too much of a carbon footprint, then there is no sustainability. People and businesses are often asked to think about how much carbon they are putting into the air, and how this changes the environment and maybe causes global warming. This is often said about traveling by airplane or by car, because burning fuel makes carbon dioxide gas.\nWhere it comes from.\nOil, gas, and coal are called \"fossil fuels\" because they come from fossils of ancient plants and animals. Those plants and animals had carbon in them. When we burn oil, gas, and coal, the carbon becomes carbon dioxide and goes into the air. This makes the greenhouse effect, which means that the carbon dioxide makes the earth warmer, like a greenhouse. A carbon footprint is the carbon dioxide that is put into the air because of a person, a group of people, an event or a product.\nRemedies.\nThe most common way to reduce the carbon footprint of humans is to Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Refuse. Another easy option is to drive less. By walking or biking to the destination rather than driving, not only is a person going to save money on gas, but they will be burning less fuel and releasing fewer emissions into the atmosphere. However, if walking is not an option, one can look into carpooling use public transportation options in their area.\nYet another option for reducing the carbon footprint of humans is to use less air conditioning and heating in the home. By adding insulation to the walls and attic of one's home, and installing weather stripping or caulking around doors and windows one can lower their heating costs more than 25 percent. \nChoice of diet is a major influence on a person's carbon footprint. Animal sources of protein (especially red meat), rice (typically produced in high methane-emitting paddies), foods transported long distance and/or via fuel-inefficient transport (e.g., highly perishable produce flown long distance) and heavily processed and packaged foods are among the major contributors to a high carbon diet.

He bought the Louisiana territory from France, which was being led by Napoleon Bonaparte at the time, for 15,000,000 USD. First, the men sent to France were allowed to spend up to 10 million USD in order to buy New Orleans and, if possible, the west bank of the Mississippi River. But then the French government said that for 5 million more dollars they would sell all of the Louisiana territory. Thomas Jefferson approved the deal and used his constitutional power to sign treaties to buy the land. However, France did not control most of the land that was purchased. Because of that, the United States had to make other agreements with and payments to other governments and groups. The total amount paid for the Louisiana Purchase and all of these other agreements was about 2.6 billion USD.\nNapoleon Bonaparte sold the land because he needed money for the Great French War. The British had re-entered the war and France was losing the Haitian Revolution and could not defend Louisiana. Thomas Jefferson took the French offer as an opportunity to make America larger, even if it meant going against his Republican principles of small government (some would say he exceeded his constitutional power by accepting the deal on his own).\nThe purchase added 828,394 square miles and doubled the size of the U.S.. This included all of the states of Oklahoma, Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, and part of the states of Louisiana, Texas, Minnesota, Colorado, New Mexico, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota. It also included a small piece of land that is now part of Canada.\nThe Louisiana Purchase gave the U.S. control of the Mississippi River and the port city of New Orleans, both of which were used by farmers to ship their crops and get paid. It also ensured that France and other European countries would not try to take the land. France only controlled small bits of the territory, so the new owners still had to take the land from the Native American nations that lived there.\nThe Lewis and Clark expedition explored the Louisiana Purchase and the Oregon Territory. They started from St. Louis. Their route traced the Missouri River."}

He was born at Stavenhagen in Mecklenburg-Schwerin.\nIn 1831, Reuter started to study at the University of Rostock, and in 1832 went to the University of Jena. At Jena he joined a \"Burschenschaft\" (nationalist students' club). In 1833 he was arrested in Berlin by the Prussian government. They could only prove he had worn the club's colours, but he was condemned to death for high treason. King Frederick William III of Prussia changed this to imprisonment for thirty years. In 1838 he was sent to a prison in Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and he spent two years in the fortress of D\u00f6mitz. Reuter was set free in 1840, when Frederick William IV became king of Prussia.\nAfter his release from prison, Reuter started studying law again at the University of Heidelberg but had to leave and go back to Stavenhagen and help to run his father's farm. When his father died, he gave up farming, and in 1850 became a private teacher in a little town then called Treptow-an-der-Tollense in Pomerania. Here he married Luise Kunze, the daughter of a Mecklenburg pastor.\nReuter's first book was written in Low German. It was published in 1853. Three years later Reuter decided to give up teaching to become a writer, so he left Treptow and moved to Neubrandenburg.\n\"Ut de Franzosentid\" and \"Ut mine Stromtid\" are Reuter's best books. In them he describes the men and women he knew in the villages and farmhouses of Mecklenburg. \"Ut de Franzosentid\" is set at the time of the fight against Napoleon. \"Ut mine Stromtid\" describes the revolutionary movement of 1848.\nIn 1863 Reuter moved from Neubrandenburg to Eisenach and here he died on 12 July 1874.

His fellow poet Du Fu counted him to the group of Chinese scholars that he called the \"Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup\" in a poem. Li Bai is often regarded, along with Du Fu, as one of the two greatest poets in China's literary history. Today we know about 1,100 of his poems.\nThe first translations in a Western language were published in 1862 by Marquis d'Hervey de Saint-Denys in his \"Po\u00e9sies de l'\u00c9poque des Thang\". The English-speaking world was introduced to Li Bai's works by a Herbert Allen Giles publication \"History of Chinese Literature\" (1901) and through the liberal, but poetically influential, translations of Japanese versions of his poems made by Ezra Pound.\nLi Bai is best known for the imagination and Taoist imagery in his poetry. He spent much of his life travelling. People tell the story that he fell from his boat when he tried to embrace the reflection of the moon, and therefore drowned in the Yangtze River.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nLi Bai was probably born in Central Asia, though the exact location is unknown. His ancestors had lived in exile in that area since around the 7th century. He grew up in a fairly poor family. His father was a merchant. Li Bai did not receive any formal schooling as a child. Despite this, he had always been skilled with the art of words even as a young boy. In 705, Li Bai's father moved the family back to Mien-chou in Sichuan. It was there that he spent most of his early childhood.\nAs Lai Bai grew up he developed his sword fighting skills. He spent his teenage years traveling all of Sichuan as a knight-errant. At age 25, he traveled to Central China. In 727, Li Bai traveled to A-lu in Hubei. He married the daughter of the retired prime minister. There, he continued to explore the natural world where he lived.\nTravels.\nIn 735, Li Bai traveled north to the Yellow River, and east to the Yangtze River. In 742, he traveled to Chang\u2019an, and was presented to the Emperor. The Emperor gave Li Bai many compliments, and thought highly of him. He gave Li Bai a position at the Hanlin Academy. Li Bai received a lot of attention from fellow scholar-officials.\nLi Bai enjoyed drinking liquor. He is known for often getting very drunk with seven other officials in city taverns. This earned them the title the \"Eight Immortals of the Wine Cup\" from Du Fu, another one of China's best poets at the time.\nIn 744, Li Bai left the city of Chang'an. He was bored with the luxuries of city life. A year later, he met up with Du Fu, in Loyang. It was here that he also became a Taoist, a decision that would change the rest of his life. After settling his family down in Loyang, he left on another ten-year journey wandering around northern China. During this time, his poetry reflects his shift in interest to Toasm rather than his youthful interests of knightly behaviors and gallantry. While famous and well known, Li Bai started to struggle with problems like lack of money and property.\nPoetry.\nLi Bai is best known for his imaginative and witty poetry. It involves romantic descriptions of nature, and opinions on ethics and death. He was famous among both nobles and commoners in his time, and is thought of as one of the four best poets during the Tang Dynasty. He is also well known for his Taoist beliefs and rebellion against Confucian teachings through his writing.\nOne of Li Bai's most famous poems is \"Drinking Alone by Moonlight\" (, pinyin: Yu\u00e8 Xi\u00e0 D\u00fa Zhu\u00f3), which is a good example of some of the most famous aspects of his poetry\u2014a very spontaneous poem, full of natural images. Li Bai actually wrote several poems with the same title; Arthur Waley's version of the most famous reads:\nPhilosophy.\nLi Bai\u2019s poetry reflects the state of low feeling one experiences when he finds his life is wasted, and talents unused. To drown his own sorrows, Li Bo became very drunk very often, until it became a lifelong habit. Wine, however did help him write. While he was drunk, Li Bai was able to compose beautiful verses without restraint. Without anything holding him back, Li Bai\u2019s finest poems were composed with much spontaneity and imagination.\nInfluence.\nLi Bai is influential in the West partly due to Ezra Pound's versions of some of his poems in the collection \"Cathay\", such as . In the east he influenced poets like Mi Fei in the Song Dynasty.\nA crater on the planet Mercury has been named after him.\nOther websites.\nOnline translations (some with original Chinese, pronunciation, and literal translation):"}

From the window he often saw English soldiers firing at the demonstrators, men and women. \"You could say,\" he later noted, \"that the one thing which most shook the security of my childhood was the 1919 revolution.\"\nBefore the Nobel Prize only a few of his novels had appeared in the West.\nBecause of his outspoken support for Anwar el Sadat's treaty with Israel, his books were banned in many Arab countries until after he won the Nobel prize.\nLike many Egyptian writers and intellectuals, Mahfouz was on a \"born list\" by muslim fundamentalists. He defended Salman Rushdie after the Iranian leader [https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naguib_Mahfouz Khomeini condemned him to death, but later he criticized Rushdie's \"Satanic Verses\" as \"insulting\" to Islam.\nBefore his death, Mahfouz was the oldest living Nobel Literature laureate and the third oldest of all time, only Bertrand Russell and Halldor Laxness were older. At the time of his death, he was the only Arabic-language writer to have won the Nobel Prize for Literature."}

His name means \"He who is loved by the Gods and who is friendly to everyone\".\nAshoka is often cited as one of India's greatest emperors. After a number of military conquests, he reigned over much of present-day India. He fought a war with the kingdom of Kalinga in which there was said to be 200,000+ casualties. He conquered Kalinga (present-day Odisha) around 261 BCE.\nAfterwards, shaken by his brutal victory, he decided to become a Buddhist and lead with peace, not war. To do this, he set up hospitals for animals and humans, created shaded and rested areas along roads for weary travellers to rest, and dug wells in villages. We know these things about his life through various inscriptions (writing) on rocks and pillars. Asoka also convinced people to follow Buddhists paths.\nThe national emblem of India and the \"Ashok Chakra\" are created by Ashoka. It's in the flag to keep a remembrance of him."}

Puritans thought that the English Reformation had not gone far enough. They also did not agree with some of the things the Church of England did.\nKing Henry VIII separated from the Roman Catholic Church in 1534 and established the Protestant Church of England. This Church remained until 1553. Queen Mary returned the Church to Roman Catholicism until 1558 when Elizabeth I of England became Queen. Since she was a Protestant many people were happy, but thought that the Church had not changed enough and was still too much like Catholicism.\nA Puritan was any person who tried to become purer through worship and doctrine. The Puritans' way of life and set of beliefs were called Puritanism. The most important parts of Puritanism were piety (obeying religious rules), dressing simply, and living a modest life.\nThe Puritans believed some of the same things as Calvinists and Scottish Presbyterians. All of these groups were devoted to the Bible and to being morally pure.\nOne of the Puritans' most important beliefs was that every person needed to understand the Bible in his own way. (This belief is shared among most Protestants.) Puritans tried to live by the Bible's teachings in every way. They tried to be morally pure in even the smallest ways. They also tried to be spiritually pure in every way. They thought that man existed for the glory of God. They believed that man's most important job in life was to do God's will (what God wanted). By doing God's will, man would be rewarded with happiness in the future.\nBecause they did not agree with the way the Church of England did things, the Puritans made reforms, or changes, in their own churches and societies. Some of the Reformed churches in Europe made similar changes. The Puritans made preaching very important. They used as little ritual and decoration as possible. Very often, sermons talked about Hell. One famous sermon is \"Sinners in the hands of an angry god\", by Jonathan Edwards, an important Puritan preacher. The sermon talks about God being angry with people for sinful behavior, and throwing them into the fires of Hell as a punishment.\nMany Puritan groups emigrated to New England so that they could start their own societies there and practice Puritanism the way they wanted. Puritan beliefs and writings became very important in New England. One important work was Puritan John Bunyan's \"The Pilgrim's Progress\".\nSeparatists.\nThose who left the Church of England altogether were known as Separatists. Many of the Plymouth Colony Pilgrims who established the first successful colony in New England were separatists.\n Some of these churches were later called Congregationalists."}

He was a writer of modern Hindi and Urdu literature.\nBiography.\nMunshi Premchand (, ), whose original name was \"Dhanpat Rai Srivastava\" , was born on 31 July 1880, in village \"Lamahi\" near Varanasi, where his father was a clerk in the post office. Premchand's parents died young - his mother when he was seven and his father while he was fourteen and still a student. Premchand was left responsible for his stepmother and step-siblings. \nEarly in life, Premchand faced immense poverty. He earned five rupees a month tutoring a lawyer's child. He was married at the early age of fifteen but that marriage failed, later he married again, to Shivrani Devi, a balavidhava (child widow), and had several children. She supported him through life struggles. \nPremchand passed his exam with great effort in 1898, and in 1899 he took up school-teaching job, with a monthly salary of eighteen rupees. In 1919 he passed his B.A. with English, Persian and History. Later, Premchand worked as the deputy sub-inspector of schools.\nPremchand lived a life of financial struggle. Once he took a loan of two-and-a-half rupees to buy some clothes. He had to struggle for three years to pay it back.\nWhen asked why he does not write anything about himself, he answered: \"What greatness do I have that I have to tell anyone about? I live just like millions of people in this country; I am ordinary. My life is also ordinary. I am a poor school teacher suffering family travails. During my whole lifetime, I have been grinding away with the hope that I could become free of my sufferings. But I have not been able to free myself from suffering. What is so special about this life that needs to be told to anybody?\". \nDuring his last years,he became terribly ill. The money his wife used to give for his treatment was used in running his press \"The Saraswati\". He was also writing a book \"Mangalsutra\" which would never be completed. All this had serious impact on his health leading to his early death on 8th October 1936, at the age of 56.\nWriting style.\nThe main characteristic of Premchand's writings is his interesting story-telling and use of simple language. His novels describe the problems of the rural peasant classes. He avoided the use of highly Sanskritized Hindi (as was the common practice among Hindi writers), and also Spanish language.\nLiterary works.\nPremchand has written about 300 short stories, several novels as well as many essays and letters. He has also written some plays. He also did some translations. Many of Premchand's stories have been translated into English and Russian.\n\"Godaan\" (The gift of a cow), his last novel, is considered the finest Hindi novel of all times. The hero, Hori, a poor peasant, desperately longs for a cow, a symbol of wealth and prestige in rural India. Hori gets a cow but pays with his life for it. After his death, the village priests demand a cow from his widow to bring his soul to peace.\nIn \"Kafan\" (Shroud), a poor man collects money for the funeral rites of his dead wife, but spends it on food and drink.\nFilms based on Premchand's work.\nSatyajit Ray filmed two of Premchand's works \u2013 \"Sadgati\" and \"Shatranj Ke Khiladi\". \"Sadgati\" (Salvation) is a short story about poor Dukhi, who gets exhausted to death while he hews wood for more or less nothing. \"Shatranj ke Khiladi\" (The Chess Players) tells the story of chess players who are so concentrated on a game that they forget their responsibilities in the midst of a crisis."}

It uses the numerals 0 through 7. The system is similar to binary (base 2) and hexadecimal (base 16). Octal numerals are written using the letter \"o\" before the numeral, for example, o04 or o1242. Octal numbers are also sometimes written with a small 8 to the lower right, as in 12428.\nAt one time, the octal system was used mainly for work with computers. It provided an easier way to work with binary numbers. As computers changed from using 24-bit systems to 32- and 64-bit systems, hexadecimal replaced octal for most uses. Certain groups, for example, Native Americans using the Yuki language in California and the Pamean languages in Mexico, also use an octal numbering system. They do this because when they count, they use the spaces between their fingers instead of counting the actual fingers.\nOctal and binary.\nThe octal numeral system uses a \"three-bit\" binary coding. Each digit in an octal numeral is the same as three digits in a binary numeral. The grouping of the binary digits is done from right to left. The first three binary digits from the right are grouped into the last part of the octal numeral, then the next three digits form the next to the last part of the numeral.\nOctal and decimal.\nIn the decimal system (base 10), each digit in octal is equal to that digit multiplied by the exponent of 8 that is equal to its location minus one.\nExample: o3425 to decimal\nOctal and hexadecimal.\nOctal is similar to hexadecimal because they are both easily converted to binary. Where octal is equal to three-digit binary, hexadecimal is equal to four-digit binary. Where octal numerals start with the letter \"o\", hexadecimal numerals end with the letter \"h\". The easiest way to convert from one to the other is to convert to binary and then to the other system."}

Later, the term was given a \"second\" meaning, the \u90e8\u9996 (Pinyin: \"b\u00f9sh\u01d2u\", Japanese \"bushu\", Korean \"busu\"). This means \"section header\", which refers to the place where a character is listed in the dictionary. \nRadicals are typically simpler characters, or different variants of simpler characters, which combine with other radicals to make a more complex character. People can only make so many unique ideographs for the huge number of words and morphemes that make up a language. Combining already existing ideographs together to form a compound ideograph is a very convenient solution to make many more words. While there are thousands of Chinese characters (well over 45,000) that exist, it is said that nearly all characters used in daily life are made up of just 214 radicals. \nOne example of simpler characters combining to form a more complex one is the complex character \u660e \"m\u00edng\" meaning \"bright\" or \"tomorrow\", which is made up of the radicals \u65e5 \"r\u00ec\" meaning \"sun\" or \"day\" and \u6708 \"yu\u00e8\" meaning \"moon\" or \"month\", both of which are simple characters that can exist by themselves, and the putting together of sun \u65e5 and moon \u6708 to make one character show that either the sun and moon pass before tomorrow comes, or that they are the bright objects in the sky that shine light on the earth. An example of characters with radicals that don't exist by themselves is the complex character \u4f11 \"x\u00ecu\" meaning \"to stop\", \u201cto cease\u201d or \"to rest\", which is made up of the radical \u4ebb, which is a variant of the simple character \u4eba \"r\u00e9n\" meaning \"person\" or \"human\", though the variant never exists as by itself must therefore attach itself to another character to form a complete character, and the radical \u6728 \"m\u01d4\" meaning \"wood\" or \"tree\", hinting what a person might want to do after he/she ceases working (like lying on a tree). \nA more complex is the character \u5abd \"m\u0101\" meaning \u201cmother\u201d (shown right), in which the left part \u5973 \"n\u01da\" meaning \"woman\" or \"female\" happens to be the semantic component, and also the section header under which dictionaries list the graph. However, not all section headers function in a particular character as the semantic component. Some are based on phonetics, or hint as the character's pronunciation, like the right part \u99ac \"m\u01ce\" meaning \"horse\" of the character \u5abd. Although the meaning of the character \u5abd has no clear, obvious connection to a horse, \u99ac is included to help the reader remember its pronunciation. Other section headers are merely chosen for convenience of finding the character in a dictionary, and play neither a semantic nor a phonetic role, like \u4e8c \"\u00e8r\" \"two\" in \u4e9e \"y\u00e0\" \"second\" or \"inferior\",\u4e85 \"ju\u00e9\" (no meaning) in \u4e86 \"li\u00e0o\" \"past tense marker\", and \u4e00 \"y\u012b\" \"one\" in \u4e01 \"d\u012bng\" \"fourth\". These two meanings of \u201cradical\u201d are not synonymous, though they may coincide in a particular example, causing a lot of confusion. (For clarity, both semantic component and section header terms are used here.)\nThe equivalents in cuneiform and Egyptian hieroglyphics are called determinatives.\nChinese character components, whether semantic or phonetic in role, are the building blocks for all Chinese Hanzi as well as in the derived forms of Japanese Kanji, Korean Hanja, and Vietnamese Ch\u1eef n\u00f4m and Ch\u1eef nho.\nSince the Kangxi dictionary of 1716 was indexed using the 214 \n\"Z\u00echu\u00ec\" section headers, the standard list thereof has remained unchanged. Section headers are foundationally important for the organisation and use of Hanzi, Kanji, and Hanja dictionaries."}

From 1946 to 1952 he was the first elected Secretary-General of the United Nations.\nEarly life.\nLie was born in Oslo (then Kristiania) on 16 July 1896. He joined the Labour Party in 1911 and was named as the party's national secretary soon after getting his law degree from the University of Oslo in 1919. He married Hj\u00f8rdis J\u00f8rgensen in 1921; the couple had three daughters, Sissel, Guri, and Mette.\nPolitical career.\nLater he was elected to the Storting (Norway's Parliament). He was appointed Minister of Justice when a Labour Party government was formed by Johan Nygaardsvold in 1935. Lie was later named Minister of Trade and Industries and Minister of Supply and Shipping.\nIn 1940, when Norway was invaded by Germany, Lie ordered all Norwegian ships to sail to Allied ports. Lie was named as Foreign Minister of the Norwegian government-in-exile.\nSelection as UN Secretary General.\nLie led the Norwegian \"delegation\" (group) to the United Nations conference in San Francisco in 1946 and was a leader in drafting the rules to set up the United Nations Security Council. He was the leader of the Norwegian delegation to the United Nations general assembly in 1946. On February 1, 1946, he was elected as the first United Nations Secretary-General as a result of a compromise between the major powers, having only missed being elected President of the first General Assembly by a small margin. He gets much of the credit for securing the current site for the United Nations headquarters from John D. Rockefeller, Jr., and establishing the offices there.\nAs Secretary General.\nAs Secretary General, Lie supported the foundation of Israel and Indonesia. He worked for the withdrawal of Soviet forces in Iran and a stop to fighting in Kashmir. He attracted the anger of the Soviet Union when he helped gather support for the defence of South Korea after it was invaded in 1950 and later worked to end the Soviet boycott of UN meetings, though his involvement has only little to do with the eventual return of the Soviet Union to the UN. He was opposed to Spain's entry into the United Nations because of his opposition to the Franco government. He also sought to have the People's Republic of China recognized by the United Nations after the Nationalist government was exiled to Taiwan, arguing that the People's Republic was the only government which could fulfill the membership obligations in full. This did not happen until the 1970s.\nHe has been criticized for his failures to facilitate negotiation in the Berlin Blockade, as well as his failure to bring about a more swift end to the Korean War. His critics argue that he was under the influence of a select few in the UN Secretariat. He has also been criticized for his arrogance and stubbornness.\nOver objections from the Soviet Union, his term of office was extended by the General Assembly 46 - 5 in 1950. This was the result of a Security Council impasse, in which the US refused to accept any candidate but Lie, and the Soviet Union's absolute refusal to accept him again, due to his involvement in the Korean War. The Soviet Union refused to acknowledge him as secretary general in his second term, and after having been accused by Joseph McCarthy of hiring \"disloyal\" Americans (an allegation which he attributed to the rapid hiring of civil servants necessary after the creation of the organization), Lie resigned on November 10, 1952.\nLater life.\nLie remained active in Norwegian politics after his resignation from the UN. He was the Governor of Oslo and Akershus, Chairman of the Board of Energy, Minister of the Interior, and Minister of Trade.\nDeath.\nLie died on December 30, 1968 of a heart attack. He was 72 years old."}

He was chosen after his predecessor Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld was killed in a plane crash in September 1961.\n\"U\" is a word in Burmese, roughly equal to \"Mister.\" \"Thant\" was his only name. In Burmese he was known as Pantanaw U Thant. His home town is Pantanaw, so this means \"Mr Thant of Pantanaw\"\nCivil servant.\nWhen U Nu became the Prime Minister of the newly independent Burma, he asked Thant to join him in Rangoon and appointed him as Director of Broadcasting in 1948. In the following year he was appointed Secretary to the Government of Burma in the Ministry of Information. From 1951 to 1957, Thant was Secretary to the Prime Minister. He also took part in a number of international conferences and was the secretary of the first Asian-African summit in 1955 at Bandung, Indonesia which gave birth to the Non-Aligned Movement.\nFrom 1957 to 1961, he was Burma's Permanent Representative (Ambassador) to the United Nations, and became actively involved in negotiations over Algerian independence. In 1960 the Burmese government awarded him the title \"Maha Thray Sithu\" as a commander in the Pyidaungsu Sithu Thingaha Order (similar to an order of knights).\nUN Secretary General.\nThant began serving as Acting Secretary-General from November 3, 1961, when he was unanimously appointed by the General Assembly, on the recommendation of the Security Council, to fill the unexpired term of Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld. He was then unanimously appointed Secretary-General by the General Assembly on November 30, 1962 for a term of office ending on November 3, 1966. During this first term he was widely credited for his role in defusing the Cuban Missile Crisis and for ending the civil war in the Congo.\nU Thant was appointed to a second term as Secretary-General of the United Nations by the General Assembly on December 2, 1966 on the unanimous recommendation of the Security Council. His term of office continued until December 31, 1971, when he retired. During his time in office, he oversaw the entry into the UN of dozens of new Asian and African states and was a firm opponent of apartheid in South Africa. He also established many of the UN's development and environmental agencies, funds and programmes, including the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the UN University, UNCTAD, UNITAR and the United Nations Environment Programme.\nHe had also led many successful though now largely forgotten peace making efforts, for example in Yemen in 1962 and Bahrain in 1968. In each case, war would have provoked a wider regional conflict, and it was Thant's quiet mediation which prevented war.\nUnlike his two predecessors, Thant retired after ten years on speaking terms with all the big powers. In 1961 when he was first appointed, the Soviet Union had tried to insist on a \"troika\" formula of three Secretaries-General, one representing each Cold War bloc, something which would have maintained equality in the United Nations between the superpowers. By 1966, when Thant was reappointed, all the big powers, in a unanimous vote of the Security Council, affirmed the importance of the Secretary-Generalship and his good offices, a clear tribute to Thant's work.\nThe Six Day War between Arab countries and Israel, the Prague Spring and subsequent Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 leading to the birth of Bangladesh all took place during his time as Secretary-General.\nHe was widely criticized in the US and Israel for agreeing to pull UN troops out of the Sinai in 1967 in response to a request from Egyptian President Nasser. U Thant tried to persuade Nasser not to go to war with Israel by flying to Cairo in a last minute peace effort.\nHis once good relationship with the US government deteriorated rapidly when he publicly criticized American conduct of the Vietnam War. His secret attempts at direct peace talks between Washington and Hanoi were eventually rejected by the Johnson Administration.\nThant followed unidentified flying object reports with some interest; in 1967, he arranged for American atmospheric physicist Dr. James E. McDonald to speak before the UN's Outer Space Affairs Group regarding UFOs.\nOn January 23, 1971 U Thant categorically announced that he would \"under no circumstances\" be available for a third term as Secretary-General. For many weeks, the UN Security Council was deadlocked over the search for a successor before finally settling on Kurt Waldheim to succeed U Thant as Secretary-General on December 21, 1971 \u2014 Waldheim's 53rd birthday \u2014 and just ten days before U Thant's second term was to have ended.\nIn his farewell address to the United Nations General Assembly Secretary-General U Thant stated that he felt a 'great sense of relief bordering on liberation' on relinquishing the 'burdens of office'. In an editorial published around December 27, 1971 praising U Thant, \"The New York Times\" stated that \"the wise counsel of this dedicated man of peace will still be needed after his retirement\". The editorial was entitled \"The Liberation of U Thant\".\nDeath.\nU Thant died of lung cancer in New York on November 25, 1974. By this time Burma was ruled by a military junta which refused him any honors. The then Burmese President Ne Win was envious of U Thant's international stature and the respect that was accorded him by the Burmese populace. Ne Win also resented U Thant's close links with the democratic government of U Nu which Ne Win had overthrown in a coup d'\u00e9tat on March 2, 1962. Ne Win ordered that U Thant be buried without any official involvement or ceremony.\nFrom the United Nations headquarters in New York, U Thant's body was flown back to Rangoon but no guard of honour or high ranking officials were on hand at the airport when the coffin arrived.\nOn the day of U Thant's funeral on December 5, 1974, tens of thousands of people lined the streets of Rangoon to pay their last respects to their distinguished countryman whose coffin was displayed at Rangoon's Kyaikasan race course for a few hours before the scheduled burial.\nThe coffin of U Thant was then snatched by a group of students just before it was scheduled to leave for burial in an ordinary Rangoon cemetery. The student demonstrators buried U Thant on the former grounds of the Rangoon University Students Union (RUSU), which Ne Win had dynamited and destroyed on July 8, 1962.\nDuring the period of December 5 through December 11, 1974, the student demonstrators also built a temporary mausoleum for U Thant on the grounds of the RUSU and gave anti-government speeches. In the early morning hours of December 11, 1974, government troops stormed the campus, killed some of the students guarding the makeshift mausoleum, removed U Thant's coffin, and reburied it at the foot of the Shwedagon Pagoda, where it has continued to lie.\nUpon hearing of the storming of the Rangoon University campus and the forcible removal of U Thant's coffin, many people rioted in the streets of Rangoon. Martial law was declared in Rangoon and the surrounding metropolitan areas. What has come to be known as the U Thant crisis \u2014 the student-led protests over the shabby treatment by the Ne Win government of U Thant \u2014 was crushed by the Burmese government.\nIn 1978, U Thant's memoirs \"View from the UN\" was published, by the American publishing house Doubleday."}

He was the sixth Secretary-General of the United Nations (UN) from January 1992 to December 1996.\nEducation.\nBoutros-Ghali graduated from Cairo University in 1946. He received a PhD in public international law from the University of Paris. Then he received a diploma in international relations from the Sciences Po in 1949. \nPolitical career.\nBoutros-Ghali's political career took off during the days of former president Anwar El-Sadat. He was a member of the Central Committee of the Arab Socialist Union (1974-77). He had been Egypt's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs from 1977 until early 1991. He then became Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs for several months before moving to the UN. As Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, he played a part in the peace agreements between Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin.\nSecretary General tenure.\nElected to the top post of the UN in 1991, Boutros-Ghali's term in office remains controversial. He was criticised for the UN's failure to act during the 1994 Rwandan Genocide, which officially left about 937,000 people dead, and he appeared unable to muster support in the UN for intervention in the continuing Angolan Civil War. One of the hardest periods for his office during his term was dealing with the crisis of the Yugoslav wars after the disintegration of former Yugoslavia. His reputation thus became entangled in the larger controversies over the effectiveness of the UN and the role of the United States in the UN. For his detractors, he came to symbolise the UN's alleged inaction in the face of humanitarian crises.\nSecond term.\nIn 1996, ten Security Council members, led by African members Egypt, Guinea-Bissau and Botswana, sponsored a resolution backing Boutros-Ghali for a second five-year term, until 2001. However, the United States vetoed a second term for Boutros-Ghali. In addition to the United States, the United Kingdom, Poland, South Korea, and Italy did not sponsor this resolution, although all four of those nations voted in support of Boutros-Ghali after the US had firmly declared its intention to veto. Although not the first vetoed (China vetoed the third term of Kurt Waldheim in 1981), Boutros-Ghali was the first and only UN secretary-general not to be elected to a second term in office. He was succeeded at the UN by Kofi Annan.\nUS counter-terrorism czar Richard Clarke, Michael Sheehan, and Jamie Rubin participated in what they called \"Operation Orient Express.\" From page 201 of Clarke's book Against All Enemies: \"Albright and I and a handful of others (Michael Sheehan, Jamie Rubin) had entered into a pact together in 1996 to oust Boutros-Ghali as Secretary General of the United Nations, a secret plan we had called Operation Orient Express, reflecting our hope that many nations would join us in doing in the UN head. In the end, the US had to do it alone (with its UN veto) and Sheehan and I had to prevent the President from giving in to pressure from world leaders and extending Boutros-Ghali's tenure, often by our racing to the Oval Office when we were alerted that a head of state was telephoning the President. In the end Clinton was impressed that we had managed not only to oust Boutros-Ghali but to have Kofi Annan selected to replace him. (Clinton told Sheehan and me, 'Get me a crow, I should eat a crow, because I said you would never pull it off.')\"\nLater life.\nFrom 1997 to 2002 Boutros-Ghali was Secretary-General of La Francophonie, an organisation of French-speaking nations. From 2003 to 2006, he served as the Chairman of the Board of the South Centre, intergovernmental research organisation of developing countries. He was currently President of the Curatorium Administrative Council at the Hague Academy of International Law. In 2003 Boutros-Ghali was appointed as The Director of the Egyptian National Council of Human Rights.\nFrom April 2007 Boutros-Ghali had supported the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly. He was one of the initial signers of the campaign's appeal. In a message to the campaign, he stressed the necessity to establish democratic participation at the global level.\nDeath.\nBoutros-Ghali died on 16 February 2016 at a hospital in Cairo, Egypt after suffering from a broken pelvis. He was 93.\nWorks.\nBoutros-Ghali published two memoirs:"}

As they became more and more popular, Century Media started to promote Finntroll. That summer Finntroll played their first open air festivals in Finland. The year after the release of the album \"Jaktens Tid\" the band could not go on tour, because their singer had a tumor in his vocal cords. That is why he stopped singing in the band after the album \"Visor om Slutet\" (English: \"Songs about the End\"). This album was recorded in January 2003, in a forest cabin near Helsinki. Shortly before the release of \"Visor om Slutet\" Raimoranta died, because he fell off a bridge in Helsinki. He had drunk too much alcohol.

Pollyanna is happy all the time, and makes other people happy. She plays a game called the \"glad game\", where you find something to be happy about even when you are sad.

Cavalry regiments, until the end of World War I, were always \"mounted\" on horses. Nowadays \"cavalry regiments\" are mounted on tanks. The British Household Cavalry is unusual because half of them are also still mounted on horses. The two Regiments of Household Cavalry, the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, which parades with horses and the Household Cavalry Regiment, which has light armoured vehicles, are manned by equal numbers of soldiers from The Life Guards and The Blues and Royals both of which are part of the \"Household Division\". In Britain the \"Household Division\" has the special privilege of guarding the Sovereign and the Royal Household. The term \"Household Division\" is used in all Commonwealth countries. \nIn many other countries there are similar highly-trained army corps which guard the head of state and have ceremonial duties as well as operational military roles. Regiments of this sort can be found in Australia, Brunei, Belgium, Canada, Denmark and many other countries. But when speaking in English of the \"Household Cavalry\", the term generally refers to the \"British Household Cavalry\". \nThe Life Guards and The Blues and Royals.\nIn Britain there are seven regiments in the Household Division. They are generally referred to as \"The Guards\". Five of the Guards regiments are \"infantry\", which means that they are \"foot soldiers\" and are Foot Guards, and the senior two regiments are \"cavalry\" meaning they are first and foremost armoured soldiers who also have a ceremonial role \"mounted\" on horses for ceremonial duty. \nThe British Household Cavalry is made of two regiments: The Life Guards and The Blues and Royals. They are the senior regular regiments in the British Army, with traditions dating from 1660. The \"Horse Guards\", (as they are known, for short), have their barracks in Hyde Park Barracks in Knightsbridge in London and perform their principal duty of forming daily The Queen's Life Guard at a building in London which was formerly the headquarters of the British Army. There are always mounted guards on duty ouside the \"Horse Guards\" building in front of which lies the famous Horse Guards Parade where The Queen's Birthday Parade takes place. There, the daily ceremony of the \"Changing of The Queen's Life Guard\" takes place. (This is a different Changing of the Guard to the one at Buckingham Palace.) \nThe Colonel-in-Chief of both Regiments of Household Cavalry is Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II. The Colonel of The Life Guards is General Lord Guthrie of Craigiebank GCB, LVO, OBE. The Colonel of The Blues and Royals is Her Royal Highness The Princess Royal KG, KT, GCVO, QSO. \nThe motto of both regiments is \"Honi Soit Qui Mal Y Pense\" (Shame on him who thinks evil of it). \nAs military regiments, The Life Guards and The Blues and Royals have served in these places:\nUniform.\nThe ceremonial uniform of the Household Cavalry has two features that are not often seen on other soldiers. They wear a shiny Silver helmet With Brass and Silver fittings, with a long \"plume\" of horse hair hanging from the top. When on \"mounted guard\" duty they also wear a \"cuirasse\" (metal chest armour). The two regiments can be told apart by the colour of their jacket (which is called a \"tunic\") and by the \"plumes\" on their helmets. The Life Guards wear red tunics with white plumes while The Blues and Royals wear blue tunics and have red plumes to their helmets. While on guard, the soldiers carry swords. When mounted on horses, the soldiers wear white riding-breeches, known as buckskins, and tall black winged leather boots, which are called jack boots, having been \"jacked\" or reinforced against sword blows (Fr. Jaque: chainmail). \nThe \"farrier\" assists the Regimental Veterinary Officer in of taking care of the horses. When the farrier is mounted on parade, he carries the traditional symbol of an axe. In battle, one of the farrier's jobs was to kill horses that were badly injured. They also had to cut off one of the hooves so that there was proof of the horse's death so that a new one could be purchased. The horses are all black three quareter bred Irish draught horses except for the trumpeters' horses, which are grey, and the drumhorses which are large draught horses. They are almost invariably coloured horses, Shires or Clydesdales and are \"piebald\" (black and white), \"skewbald\" (brown and white) or roan. The drumhorses each carry two solid silver kettle drums on parade.\nThe trumpeter, whose job is to relay messages by trumpet, can be told apart because he does not wear a cuirrass, and has a grey (white) horse. On \"State occasions\" when The Queen or another member of the Royal Family is present, the bands of The Household Cavalry wear gold coats designed at the time of King Charles II made of gold braid and dark blue velvet jockey hats. Each regiment has its own Quick March and Slow March. They both use a Scottish tune the \"Keel Row\" for a ceremonial \"trot past\".\nThe Household Cavalry's Operational Role.\nThe Household Cavalry Regiment is an armoured reconnaissance regiment based in Windsor. Most Household Cavalry soldiers begin their careers on mounted duty before being posted, normally after about two years at ceremonial duty, to the reconnaissance regiment, which has Scimitar light tanks, where they are trained in driving, gunnery ands signals. This regiment has deployed more than almost any other in the British Army to operations in Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan. Gallantry medals awarded to soldiers of the Household Cavalry since 2003 include: a George Cross (GC) to Trooper Christopher Finney of The Blues and Royals, a Conspicuous Gallantry Cross (CGC) and a Military Cross (MC) to Staff Corporal Michael Flynn of The Blues and Royals (making him the most decorated serviceman in the British Army), a CGC to Lance Corporal of Horse Andrew Radford, a Distinguished Service Order to Major Richard Taylor of The Life Guards, and MCs to Captain Paddy Williams of The Blues and Royals and to Staff Corporal Shaun Fry of The Life Guards. All these were awarded on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. "}

In the \"Commedia dell'arte\" it was an outline of entrances, exits, and action describing the story of a play that was literally pinned to the back of the scenery. \nSurviving scenari from the Renaissance contain little other than character names, brief descriptions of action, and references to specific lazzi with no further explanation. It is believed that a scenario forms the basis of a fully improvisational performance though it is also likely that they were simple reminders of the plot for those members of the cast who were literate. \nIn the creation of an opera or ballet, a scenario is often developed initially to indicate how the original source, if any, is to be adapted. This sketch can be helpful in \"pitching\" the idea to a prospective producer, director, or composer.\nScenarios are also used in policy planning, and when trying out strategies against uncertain future developments. Here the key idea is for the scenario to be an overview, a summary, of a projected course of action, events or situations. Scenarios are widely used by organizations of all types to understand different ways that future events might unfold."}

{"id": "95912", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=95912", "title": "Diode", "text": "A diode is an electronic component with two electrodes (connectors) that allows electricity to go through it in one direction and not the other direction. \nDiodes can be used to turn alternating current into direct current (Diode bridge). They are used in power supplies and sometimes to decode amplitude modulation radio signals (like in a crystal radio). Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are a type of diode that produce light.\nToday, the most common diodes are made from semiconductor materials such as silicon or sometimes germanium.\nHistory.\nThe first types of diodes were called Fleming valves. They were vacuum tubes. They were inside a glass tube (much like a lightbulb). Inside the glass bulb there was a small metal wire and a large metal plate. The small metal wire would heat up and emit electricity, which was captured by the plate. The large metal plate was not heated, so electricity could go in one direction through the tube but not in the other direction. Fleming valves are not used much anymore because they have been replaced by semiconductor diodes, which are smaller than Fleming valves. Thomas Edison also discovered this property when working on his light bulbs.\nConstruction.\nSemiconductor diodes are made of two types of semiconductors connected to each other. One type has atoms with extra electrons (called the n-side). The other type has atoms that want electrons (called the p-side). Because of this, the electricity will flow easily from the side with too many electrons to the side with too few. However, electricity will not flow easily in the reverse direction. These different types are made by doping (semiconductor). Silicon with arsenic dissolved in it makes a good n-side semiconductor, while silicon with aluminum dissolved in it makes a good p-side semiconductor. Other chemicals can also work.\nThe connector to the n-side is called the cathode, the connector to the p-side is called the anode.\nFunction of a diode.\nPositive voltage at p-side.\nIf you give positive voltage to the p-side and negative voltage to the n-side, the electrons in the n-side will want to go to the positive voltage at the p-side and the holes of the p-side will want to go to the negative voltage at the n-side. Because of this, current flow is able to exist, but it takes a certain amount of voltage to get this started (very small amount of voltage is not enough to get the electric current to flow). This is called the cut-in voltage. The cut-in voltage of a silicon diode is at about 0.7\u00a0V. A germanium diode needs a cut-in voltage at about 0.3\u00a0V.\nNegative voltage at p-side.\nIf you instead give negative voltage to the p-side and positive voltage to the n-side, the electrons of the n-side want to go to the positive voltage source instead of the other side of the diode. Same thing happens on the p-side. So, current will not flow between the two sides of the diode. Increasing the voltage will eventually force electric current to flow (this is the break-down voltage). Many diodes will be destroyed by a reverse flow but some are made that can survive it.\nInfluence of temperature.\nWhen the temperature increases, the cut-in voltage goes down. This makes it easier for electricity to pass through the diode.\nTypes of diodes.\nThere are many types of diodes. Some have very specific uses and some have a variety of uses.\nSymbols.\nHere are some common semiconductor diode symbols used in schematic diagrams:\nStandard rectifier diode.\nThis changes A/C (alternating current, like in a wall plug in a house) to D/C (direct current, used in electronics). The standard rectifier diode has specific requirements. It should handle high current, not be much affected by temperature, have a low cut-in voltage and support quick changes in the direction of current flow. Modern analog and digital electronics use such rectifiers.\nLight-Emitting Diode.\nAn LED produces light when electricity flows through it. It is a longer lasting and more efficient way of creating light than incandescent light bulbs. Depending on how it was made, the LED can make different colors. LEDs were first used in the 1970's. The light-emitting diode may eventually replace the light bulb as developing technology makes it brighter and cheaper (it is already more efficient and lasts longer). In the 1970's the LEDs were used to show numbers in appliances such as calculators, and as a way to show the power was on for larger appliances.\nPhotodiode.\nA photodiode is a photo detector (the opposite of a light-emitting diode). It responds to light that comes in. Photodiodes have a window or optical fiber connection, which lets light in to the sensitive part of the diode. Diodes usually have strong resistance; the light reduces the resistance.\nZener Diode.\nA zener diode is like a normal diode, but instead of being destroyed by a big reverse voltage, it lets electricity through. The voltage needed for this is called the breakdown voltage or Zener voltage. Because it is built with a known breakdown voltage it can be used to supply a known voltage.\nVaractor Diode.\nThe varicap or varactor diode is used in many appliances. It uses the region between the p-side and n-side of the diode where electrons and holes balance each other. This is called the depletion zone. By changing the amount of reverse voltage, the size of the depletion zone changes. There is some capacitance in this area, and it changes based on the size of the depletion zone. This is called variable capacitance, or varicap for short. It is used in PLLs (Phase-locked loops) which are used to control the high-speed frequency a chip runs at.\nStep-Recovery-Diode.\nThe symbol is the symbol of a diode with a kind of snag. It is used in circuits with high frequencies up to GHz. It turns off very quickly when the forward voltage stops. It uses the current that flows after the polarity was reversed to do this.\nPIN Diode.\nThe construction of this diode has an intrinsic (normal) layer between the n- and the p-sides. At slower frequencies, it acts much like a standard diode. But at high speeds it can not keep up with fast changes and starts to act like a resistor. The intrinsic layer also lets it handle high power inputs, and can be used as a photodiode.\nSchottky diode.\nThe symbol of this is the diode symbol, with an \u2018S\u2019 at the peak. Instead of both sides being a semiconductor (like silicon), one side is metal, like aluminum or nickel. This reduces the cut-in voltage to about 0.3 volt. This is about half of the threshold voltage of a usual diode.\nThe function of this diode is that no minority carriers are injected - the n-side only has holes, not electrons, and the p-side only has electrons, not holes. Because this is cleaner, it can react faster, without diffusion capacitance that can slow it down. It also creates less heat and is more efficient. But it does has some current leakage with reverse voltage.\nWhen a diode switches from moving current to not moving current, this is known as switching. It takes dozens of nanoseconds in a typical diode; this creates some radio noise, which temporarily degrades radio signals. The Schottky diode switches in a small fraction of that time, less than a nanosecond.\nTunnel diode.\nIn the symbol of the tunnel diode there is a kind of additional square bracket at the end of the usual symbol.\nA tunnel diode consists of a highly doped pn-junction. Because of this high doping, there is only a very narrow gap where the electrons are able to pass through. This tunnel-effect appears in both directions.\nAfter a certain quantity of electrons have passed, the current through the gap decreases, until the normal current through the diode at the threshold voltage begins. This causes an area of a negative resistance.\nThese diodes are used to deal with really high frequencies (100\u00a0GHz). It is also resistant to radiation, so they are used in spacecraft. They are also used in microwaves and refrigerators.\nBackward diode.\nThe symbol has at the end of the diode a sign that looks like a big I. It is made similar to the tunnel diode, but the n- and the p-layer are not doped as high. It allows current to flow backwards with small negative voltages. It can be used to rectify low voltages (less than 0.7 volts).\nSilicon-Controlled Rectifier (SCR).\nInstead of two layers like a normal diode, this has four layers, it is basically two diodes put together, with a gate in the middle. When voltage goes between the gate and the cathode the lower transistor will turn on. This lets the current go through, which activates the upper transistor, and then the current will not need to be turned on by a gate voltage."}

Their full title is: \"Pomp and Circumstance Military Marches\"). Elgar started to write a sixth march, but never finished it.\nThe first of the marches is especially famous and has a tune which is one of the best known tunes in Britain. It is often sung to the words \" Land of Hope and Glory\".\nThe title.\nThe title \u201cPomp and Circumstance\u201dis taken from Act III, Scene iii of Shakespeare's \"Othello\":\nThe marches.\nThe \"Pomp and Circumstance\" marches are\nThe first five were all published by Boosey &amp; Co. as Elgar's Op.\u00a039. Elgar dedicated each march to one of his musical friends.\nEach march takes about five minutes to play.\n\" March No. 1 in D \" is the best known of the set. It was completed, together with March No. 2, in 1901, soon after the first performance of his \u201cDream of Gerontius\u201d which had been badly performed. Elgar dedicated it to Alfred Rodewald who conducted its first performance with the Liverpool Orchestra Society on 19 October 1901. Both marches were played two days later at a Promenade Concert in the Queen's Hall London, conducted by Henry Wood. Elgar knew that the audience would love the big tune in the middle of March No. 1, so that march was played second. Henry Wood tells in his autobiography that \u201cthe people simply rose and yelled. I had to play it again \u2013 with the same result; in fact, they refused to let me get on with the programme\u2026.merely to restore order, I played the march a third time.\u201d \nThe next year King Edward VII was due to be crowned in June. The King liked the big tune, and wanted it performed with words at the coronation. So Elgar used it at the end of his \"Coronation Ode\" with words by A.C. Benson. The coronation did not take place because the king became ill just before the big day. \"Land of Hope and Glory\" was sung in June 1902 by Clara Butt, and the whole Ode was performed in Sheffield four months later.\nIn Britain \"Land of Hope and Glory\" is sung every year at the Last Night of the Proms in the Royal Albert Hall as part of the Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1.\nThe words are:\nIn the United States the tune is sometimes known as \"Pomp and Circumstance\" or as \"The Graduation March\", and is played as the processional tune at high school and college graduation ceremonies.\n\" March No. 2 in A minor \" was dedicated to the composer Granville Bantock\". It was first performed at the same concert as March No. 1. It the shortest and simplest of the marches.\n\" March No. 3 in C minor \" was finished in November 1904 and published in 1905. It was dedicated to Ivor Atkins\". It was first performed on 8 March 1905, in the Queen's Hall, London, conducted by the composer. It sounds quite serious at first, then it becomes very energetic.\n\" March No. 4 in G \" is very grand, like No. 1. Again there is a big tune in the middle. It was dedicated to Dr. G. Robertson Sinclair, the organist of Hereford Cathedral. It was first performed on 24 August 1907, in the Queen's Hall, London, conducted by Elgar himself.\n\" March No. 5 in C \", composed in 1930, was dedicated to Percy Hull, a friend from Hereford. It has some brilliant orchestral effects.\n\" March No. 6 in G minor \" was started, but when Elgar died there were only sketches left. The musician Anthony Payne recently discovered some more sketches for it in the library of the Royal School of Church Music. He finished composing in the way that Elgar might have done, and the work was first performed on 2 August 2006 with Andrew Davis conducting the BBC Symphony Orchestra at The Proms at Royal Albert Hall."}

Scientists think it is 350 kilometers wide. Its mean distance from the Sun is 3.067 (AU). It was found on October 2, 1910 by Vincenzo Cerulli. It is named after the Latin name for Teramo, Italy, which is where Cerulli worked. It is the fifth heaviest asteroid after Ceres, Vesta, Pallas and Hygiea, and scientists think that it makes up 2.0% of the mass of the whole asteroid belt.\nCharacteristics.\nAlthough the biggest asteroid apart from the \"big four\", Interamnia is not studied a lot. \nIt is easily the biggest of the F-type asteroids, but there are few details of what the inside is made of or shape and no lightcurve analysis has been done to find out the ecliptic coordinates of Interamnia's poles (and its axial tilt). Its apparently high bulk density (though subject to much error) suggests a very solid body entirely without internal porosity or traces of water. This also strongly suggests that Interamnia is big enough to have withstood all the collisions that have happened in the asteroid belt since the Solar System was made.\nIts very dark surface and fairly far distance from the Sun means Interamnia can never be seen with 10x50 binoculars. At most oppositions its magnitude is around +11.0, which is less than the \"minimum\" brightness of Vesta, Ceres or Pallas. Even at a near-perihelion opposition its magnitude is only around +9.9, which is over four magnitudes lower than Vesta.\nIts orbit is a more eccentric than Hygiea (15% versus 12%) but is different because Hygiea's orbit is much more inclined and takes less time to complete one orbit. Another difference is that Interamnia's perihelion is at the other side of the perihelia of the \"big four\", so that Interamnia at perihelion is actually closer to the Sun than Ceres and Pallas are at the same longitude. It is unlikely to collide with Pallas because their nodes are located too far apart. Although its nodes are located on the opposite side from those of Ceres, it is generally far from Ceres when both cross the same orbital plane and a collision is again unlikely."}

She sometimes used the pseudonym \"Cl\u00e9mence\" and was also known as \"the red virgin of Montmartre\".\nLife.\nLouise Michel was born at the Ch\u00e2teau of Vroncourt (Haute-Marne) on 29 May 1830, the daughter of Marianne Michel, and of Etienne Charles Demahis. She was brought up by her father's parents, and received a libertaria education. After her grandfather's death in 1850 she was trained to teach, but after few times she saw that Napoleon III prevented her from serving in a state school. She became violently anti-Bonapartist, and is said to have thought about the assassination of Napoleon III. She became anarchist in 1866 to a school in the Montmartre quarter of Paris, where she saw that his destiny was to work for charity and follow the revolution.\nParis.\nShe was active during the Paris Commune as an ambulance woman, she helped mutilated or injured on the barricades. During the Siege of Paris she was in resistance against the Prussians. On the establishment of the Commune, she joined the National Guard. She offered to shoot Thiers, and suggested the destruction of Paris for its surrender.\nShe was with the Communards who made their last stand in the cemetery of Montmartre, and was closely allied with Th\u00e9ophile Ferr\u00e9, who was executed in November 1871. Michel dedicated a moving farewell poem to Ferr\u00e9, \"l\u2019\u0153illet rouge\" (\"The Red Carnation\"). It is without a doubt that upon learning of this loss, Victor Hugo dedicated his poem to Michel, \"Viro Major\". This ardent attachment was perhaps one of the sources of the exaltation which marked her career, and gave many handles to her enemies. After December 1871, she began composing revolutionary propaganda; demanding assistance for poor people, other measures which threatened the government, and calls for the disenfranchised to arm themselves. She herself took up arms as well and donned a military style uniform. She never renounced the Commune, and after various legal maneuvers city judges sentenced her to death. She spent twenty months in prison and was sentenced to deportation.\nDeportation.\nShe was put onto the ship \"Virginie\" on the 8th of August, 1873, to be deported. She arrived in New Caledonia 4 months later. On board, she met Henri Rochefort, a famous polemist, who became her friend until her death. She also met Nathalie Lemel, another figure active in the commune. Louise was in New Caledonia for seven years. She refused special treatment reserved for women. In 1878 she was a leader in a revolt. The following year, she received authorisation to become a teacher in Noum\u00e9a for the children of the deported\u2014among them many Kabyles (Kabyles du Pacifique) from Cheikh Mokrani's rebellion (1871)\u2014and later in schools for girls.\nReturn to France.\nMichel returned to Paris in 1880 after amnesty was given to the Communards. Her revolutionary never died and she controlled freely a libertarian school. She travelled everywhere in France, supporting revolution. In 1883 she led a Paris mob which pillaged a baker's shop. For this she was given six years imprisonment, but was released in 1886, at the same time as Kropotkin and other prominent anarchists. After a short period of freedom she was again arrested for speaking bad about the social system.\nShe was soon free again, but, hearing that her enemies hoped to put her in a lunatic asylum, she went to England in 1890. She returned to France in 1895, taking part in the revolt made by the Dreyfuss affair in 1898. Few months ago she was constantly followed by the police, until she died in \"Room 11\", in the Hotel Oasis, Marseilles on January 10, 1905.\nThe women in the social.\nMichel became highly admired by French workers and revolutionaries, particularly for her association with the Paris Commune. From after her death until 1916, a demonstration was held every year at her tomb at Levallois-Perret. Frequently, the language used to describe her is that reserved for saints and heretics; she is often referred to as \"\"Bonne Louise\" (Good Louise) or the \"Vierge rouge\"\" (red Virgin). She was always respected same in periods when women were without right.\nThe Metr\u00f2.\nOn May 1, 1946, the Parisian \"m\u00e9tro\" station \"Vallier\" was renamed Louise Michel, see: Louise Michel (Paris Metro)."}

However many Protestants regard much Catholic art as idolatry.\nThis is due to differences in the understanding of the Ten Commandments. \"You shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make for yourself a graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth; you shall not bow down to them or serve them; for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing steadfast love to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.\" (RSV Exodus 20:3-6)\nIslamic art is often based on Geometric abstraction or calligraphy to avoid idolatry, but Jewish art is somewhat broader.

Because of its focus, modern numismatics is more popular with collectors than with historians. Other subfields/variants include exonumia (focus on coin-like objects), notaphily (focus on paper money instead of coins), and scripophily (focus on stocks and bonds instead of coins)."}

The Spartans and associates defended the pass at Thermopylae against the Persian army. Although Leonidas lost the battle, his death at Thermopylae was seen as a heroic sacrifice. Leonidas sent most of his army away when he realized that the Persians had outmaneuvered him. Three hundred of his fellow Spartans stayed with him to fight and die. Almost everything that is known about Leonidas comes from the work of the Greek historian Herodotus (c. 484\u2013c. 425 BC)\nThermopylae.\nInvasion of Greece.\nIn 480 BC, the Persians with their king Xerxes attacked Greece. When the Greeks asked the Spartans to join their army against the Persians, the Spartans went to the Oracle at Delphi. The Oracle gave a prophecy. It said that either Sparta would fall or the Spartans would lose a king.\nFighting back.\nIn August 480 BC, Leonidas went to Thermopylae with 300 of his bodyguards. Other Greek forces joined him there and formed an army of 4,000 soldiers. This army would try to hold the pass of Thermopylae against the great army of Xerxes I, King of Persia.\nSiege.\nLeonidas and his men held Thermopylae for three days. On the third day, a Greek traitor named Ephialtes led the Persian army behind the Spartans. It was then that Leonidas sent away all the Greek troops except 700 Thespians, who refused to leave. The small Greek force was attacked from both sides. They fought hard but finally they were all killed. Xerxes told his men to remove Leonidas' head and put it on a stake. He also told them to crucify his body. Now, there is a monument near Leonidas\u2019 death site. It has the following inscription:\nAfter the battle.\nOnly two Spartans survived that battle. One was Kirtanian. He was injured and sent behind the rest of the soldiers. The other was Pantites. He was sent by Leonidas to get help in Thessaly. He did not get back to Thermopylae until after the battle was done. At the end, he hanged himself because he was harassed and often referred as a coward."}

It is a fish that comes from warm freshwater areas of Africa, North and South America, India and Sri Lanka. It has been taken to other areas because it is good for fish farming, and it also is a good pet for an aquarium. When the fish is released into other parts of the world, it quickly takes over from the native fish. It can do this because it breeds quickly, eats all the available food, and eats the eggs and babies of native fish. This can cause the water to become so muddy, that the native fish cannot live. Tilapia has been listed as one of the 100 worst introduced species. A person owning or selling one in Australia could be fined up to AU$11,000.\nAn introduced species may have a great advantage over the native species. They usually come in without the predators and parasites which they suffer in their old environment. This allows them to have young quickly.

Bunkers were built during the Cold War for important political people and for the general public because of the scare of a nuclear war.\nTypes of bunkers.\nThere are many different types of bunkers:\nTrench.\nA trench is long and narrow. It may be part of a big system of trenches. Soldiers often dig and use trenches. When most of the front-line soldiers use trenches, it is called trench warfare.\nPillbox.\nA pillbox is a small building made of concrete that also has small windows that people can shoot guns out of. The name came from the fact that they look like the boxes that pills came in.\nPillboxes were used a lot during World War I when defence in depth was being used. Pillboxes are most often found camouflaged so that they are harder to spot. They can also be part of a trench system, where the pillbox is a firing step that has been built to take grenade blasts and smaller mortar fire. Pillboxes were also built to help protect strategic structures such as bridges or jetties.\nIndustrial.\nIndustrial bunkers are built like regular bunkers and they can be mining sites, food storage areas, dumps for materials, data storage, and sometimes places that people live in. They were built by nations during World War II to help protect the important industries from getting bombed. Many mines in France and Germany were made into bunkers by both the Germans and the French in both World War I and World War II.\nFamous bunkers.\nFamous bunkers include the World War II V-weapon buildings in Germany (e.g., Mittelwerk, La Coupole, and \u00c9perlecques) and the Cold War buildings in the United States (Cheyenne Mountain, Site R, and The Greenbrier) and Canada (Diefenbunker)."}

It includes extreme farming, grazing, fishing, and using fresh water. \nOver-harvesting is harmful in the long term. Forests or wetlands are hard to replace. Damage to nature hurts animals and humans. Most wetlands are damaged by overuse as a source of drinking water, and are sometimes drained to make farmland or land for building. A thriving and diverse ecosystem is destroyed. \nOver-harvesting also applies to animals. Population numbers may drop as a result, and species may become extinct. Overfishing is a typical example. Nowadays, you can only fish, shoot deer or birds at certain times of the year. The season when they mate, reproduce and lay eggs or have the young are protected. Areas of especial natural beauty or scientific interest are also protected. Taking bird eggs is also now against the law, at least in the United Kingdom.\nOne thing which acts against conservation is the overpopulation of the world. The greatest single reason why the world loses forests is that some people want the land for other purposes. A few people gain, but everyone shares the cost.

It was sponsored by Liverpool Echo who later tried to stitch the band up by putting them on the front cover under the title \"Bulger Band\", a reference to their song No Excuses that they believed, incorrectly, to be about the murder of toddler James Bulger. The band never spoke to the Liverpool Echo again. The band signed a manangement contract with Raymond Coffer. They later signed with the record label Parlophone (EMI).

They released a second album in 1998, \"Subtitles\". It did not sell as well as hoped. The band spent the next few years writing and touring sporadically, finally relocating to Seattle in 2001 to work on a third album with long time cohort Barrett Jones. After a productive 2-month stint, straight after the 9/11 bombings, the band went back home to write more songs and booked to go into Stone Gossard's (Pearl Jam) Studio Litho with Barrett to record the rest of the third record. This never happened after being dropped from their label.The band went their separate ways in March 2002 and remain firm friends, occasionally reuniting for off the cuff live shows in their native Liverpool."}

He was born the same year as Shakespeare, or at least baptised, but lived only to the age of 29, when he was murdered in a brawl.\nMarlowe was the son of a shoemaker in Canterbury. His intelligence won him scholarships, to King's School in Canterbury at age 15, and two years later to the University of Cambridge. Marlowe was well-educated; he earned a bachelor's degree in 1584 and a master's degree in 1587. \nMarlowe's plays were both popular and controversial, in his own era and later. His plays deal with disturbing subjects like devil worship (\"Doctor Faustus\"), homosexuality (\"Edward II\"), and anti-Semitism (\"The Jew of Malta\"). Marlowe is generally regarded as master of blank verse.\nIn addition to seven plays, Marlowe wrote one long poem, \"Hero and Leander\", and one famous shorter poem, \"The Passionate Shepherd to His Love.\"\nMarlowe's death was also highly controversial. He was killed in a tavern brawl, stabbed in the head. Yet there is some historical evidence that he was a secret agent. Marlowe also was, or sometimes claimed to be, an atheist, at a time when atheism was a crime that could be punished by death. Some people have wondered if his death was connected with these other issues.\nUncertainty about Marlowe's death has led some people to believe that Marlowe faked his death and continued to write plays using the name \"William Shakespeare.\" This is called the \"Marlovian theory.\" In modern times, the changes were attempted to rename the theory in \"Derogation of the king.\""}

This makes the chest look like it has caved in on itself. It is also commonly referred to as \"funnel chest\" or \"chest bowl\". It is the most common form of pectus deformity, occurring in approximately 1 in 300-400 births, with a 3:1 male predominance ratio. While Pectus Excavatum occurs at birth, it often does not develop properly until early adolescence when growth is more rapid.\nCauses.\nDoctors do not know why some people have the dent. They think it might be caused by a bad gene from the parent. It is also linked to syndromes (illnesses) that affect other parts of the body.\nNumbers.\nPectus excavatum happens in about 1 in every 300-400 children, with the 75% majority of cases being male.\nNon-invasive treatment.\nSuction Cup.\nA vacuum bell, also called a suction cup, can be used to fix pectus excavatum. The cup is placed on the chest and all the air is removed: this pulls up the chest. This non-invasive procedure shows promise to be a permanent cure for pectus excavatum. Treatment must continue for two years after the appearance of correction is made.\nSurgery.\nThe dent can be fixed by a doctor. The following are alternate surgical ways of fixing the chest:\nNuss Procedure.\nThe Nuss Prodcedure was created by Doctor Nuss from Norfolk in Virginia. A metal bar is put into the chest; the bar holds the chest up.\nRavitch.\nThe Ravitch technique is from the 1950s. It involves cutting out part of the chest, placing a bar in the chest, and having the bone grow back. Most doctors do not use the Ravitch because it causes much blood loss."}

Central Park has about 35,000,000 visitors every year. It is the most visited city park in the United States. The park contains lakes, a castle, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Central Park Zoo. The park has been shown in many movies and television programs.\nSize.\nThe Central Park is 2.5 miles (4\u00a0km) long between 59th Street (Central Park South) and 110th Street (Central Park North), and is 0.5\u00a0miles (0.8\u00a0km) wide between Fifth Avenue and Central Park West. It is similar in size to San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, Chicago's Lincoln Park, Vancouver's Stanley Park, or Munich's Englischer Garten. It lies between the New York Theater District, Harlem (north), Upper West Side, and the Upper East Side.\nCentral Park is bordered on the north by West 110th Street, on the south by West 59th Street, on the west by Eighth Avenue, and on the east by Fifth Avenue. Along the park's borders however, these are known as Central Park North, Central Park South, and Central Park West, respectively. Only Fifth Avenue retains its name as the eastern border of the park. Each of the twenty gates on these streets has a name.\nThe park is bigger than Monaco and Vatican City, though some other parks in the city are even larger.\nHistory.\nIn 1855, New York City had four times as many people as in 1821. The city grew bigger, and there were fewer parks in Lower Manhattan. A park was being planned for Upper Manhattan. Two years before, in 1853, the New York state government gave over an area, from 59th to 106th Streets, to build the Park. The land alone cost more than US$5 million.\nThe park first opened in 1857. In 1858, Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux won a design competition to improve and expand the park with a plan they entitled the Greensward Plan. Construction began in the same year and was finished in 1873. Many rocks, soil, and plants were put in the park. People living in the park were forced to move out. Later, the park was made larger.\nIn the 1930s, because people had not taken care of the park, it was cleaned up and changed by Robert Moses. By the 1960s, the park became a bad place to go again, so in the 1980s and 1990s, the Central Park Conservancy was made. The Central Park Conservancy cleaned up Central Park from the 1980s through the 2000s.\nThe park was named a National Historic Landmark in 1963.\nCentral Park Conservancy.\nThe Central Park Conservancy runs the park. They operate it because of an agreement with the city government. 85% of Central Park's $25 million annual budget and 80% of the park's maintenance staff come from the Conservancy.\nThe conservancy cares for 250 acres of lawns, 21,500 trees, 150 acres of lakes and streams, and 130 acres of woodlands. Their staff plant hundreds of bulbs, shrubs, flowers, and trees every year. They make sure that 9,000 benches, 26 ballfields, and 21 playgrounds are clean and good to use. They also care for 55 sculptures and monuments, as well as 36 bridges. Conservancy crews remove graffiti from Central Park and collect more than 2,000 tons of trash a year!\nThe Conservancy has been led by four presidents. The first is Elizabeth Barlow Rogers, who helped to create the Conservancy in 1978. She was president until 1996. Karen H. Putnam, the Conservancy\u2019s development director, was president from 1996 to 2000, after completing the projects slated under the \"Wonder of New York\" capital campaign. The third, Regina S. Peruggi, used to be president of Marymount Manhattan College. She led the Conservancy from 2000 to 2003. Since 2003, Douglas Blonsky, who used to look over construction for the Park, has been the president of the Conservancy.\nIn popular culture.\nCentral Park has been mentioned in thousands of books, movies, and TV shows. In the U.S. TV show \"Friends\" (1994-2004), the coffee shop where the characters often gathered was named \"Central Perk\" as a pun on the term \"coffee percolator\" (a type of pot used to brew coffee)."}

She became the first African-American woman to enter space when she served on the crew of the Space Shuttle Endeavour in September 1992. She has appeared on television several times, including as an actress in an episode of .\nEarly life.\nJemison was born in Decatur, Alabama. She moved to Chicago at age three. Her brother and sister are Ada and Charles Jemison. From early on, she was interested in science. Jemison\u2019s parents supported her love for science and space. As a child, she spent lots of time in the library. She read books about space, and evolution. \nEducation.\nJemison graduated from high school at the age of 16. She studied at Stanford University on a scholarship. There she earned a Bachelor of Science in chemical engineering in 1977. During her education, Jemison involved herself in activities outside her classes. These included dance, theater, and volunteer work. She was also the head of the Black Student Union. While at Cornell, Jemison helped people who had left their country because it was not safe to live there. She helped run health studies in Kenya as well. She studied how complicated organisms can be influenced by gravity. In 1981 she earned a Doctorate of Medicine.\nTraining and space mission.\nJemison was in astronomy ever since she was a child. She dreamed of going to space one day. While attending UCLA, she applied for NASA. Soon after she applied, NASA had a terrible accident on January 28, 1986. \"Challenger\" was launched in Florida and it blew up soon after taking off. The astronauts were all killed. There would be no more astronauts going into space until the scientists figured out what had happened. Jemison became one of the 0.75% of people who were chosen for a special type of instruction at NASA a year after this accident had occurred.\nThe training incorporated physical demand and rigorous studying of science. She had to learn what to do in case if an emergency had happened. She soon became a certified mission specialist. Jemison\u2019s mission was in September of 1992. She is remembered as the member of the crew on \"Endeavour\", an eight-day journey. This was a joint mission between the US and Japan. She fertilized frog eggs and observed their development into tadpoles.\nCareer.\nJemison worked at NASA from 1987 to 1993. She later started The Jemison Group, Inc., which created ALAFIYA, a satellite-based telecommunications system. This system was to be used to bring healthcare to developing nations. She also was a professor in the Environmental Studies Program at Dartmouth College. There she directed the Jemison Institute for Advancing Technology in Developing Countries. She has studied astronomy, zoology, archaeology, and many other things.\nJemison joined the Peace Corps, a volunteer organization. She worked as a medical officer there from 1983 to 1985 in Sierra Leone and Liberia.\nAchievements.\nJemison has won many awards since her time in space. She was named as one of the 50 most influential women by \"Ebony\" magazine. She is in three different halls of fame: the National Medical Association Hall of Fame, Texas Science Hall of Fame, and National Women\u2019s Hall of Fame. Jemison has also been on a few television programs, including the PBS program \"African American Lives\". She also speaks in public about her life and influence. Mae C. Jemison Public School was named after her."}

These molecules are put together with a double bond that makes it a hydrocarbon. It is very important in industry and has even been used in biology as a hormone. It is also the most made chemical. About 75 million tons of it have been made each year since 2005. Its biggest use is to make polyethylene.\nHistory.\nSince 1795, ethylene was called an \"olefiant gas\", or \"oil making gas\". This was because it came together with chlorine to make the \"oil of the Dutch chemists\".\nIn 1866, the German chemist August Wilhelm von Hofmann came up with a system for naming hydrocarbons. The suffixes -ane, -ene, -ine, -one, and -une were used to call the hydrocarbons with 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 fewer hydrogen atoms than the alkane it came from. Because of this system, ethylene became ethene.\nIn 1979, the IUPAC decided that ethylene would stay ethylene.\nHow it is made.\nEthylene is made in the chemical industry by steam cracking. Some of the parts of an ethylene plant can be:\nThere are other systems in an ethylene plant. The systems listed above were the most important systems in an ethylene plant.\nSince making ethylene uses a lot of energy, the people making the ethylene try very hard to keep the heat from the gasses from leaving the furnaces."}

This means the archbishop had his ecclesiatical (church) powers and also the powers of an he Archbishopric was about the same size as the modern state of Salzburg in Austria.\nThe most famous Archbishop was probably the last to rule as a prince. He was Hieronymus von Colloredo, who was an early patron of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.\nHistory.\nAbbot-Bishopric (4th century\u2013c. 482).\nIn 450 a book was written about the live of St Severinus of Noricum. The book said that Salzburg had two churches and a monastery. St. Maxius is the only abbot-bishop known by name. Soon after Maxius was martyred, Salzburg was destroyed soon after in about 482.\nBishopric (c. 543/698\u2013798).\nSt. Rupert later went back to Salzburg to set up the churches again. He saw the ruins of Salzburg overgrown with brambles, but no one knows whether he arrived about 543 during the time of Theodo I or in about 698 when Bavaria was conquered by the Franks.\nIt was not until after 700 that Christian civilisation started to grow again in the region. The cathedral monastery was named in honour of St. Peter and Rupert's niece Ehrentrudis founded the nunnery at Nonnberg.\nEarly Archbishopric (798\u20131060).\nArno, Archbishop of Salzburg enjoyed the respect of the Frankish king Charlemagne. Charlemagne asked him to make the land between the Danube, the Raab, and Drave Rivers Christian. This area ad recently been taken from the Avars. Monasteries were founded and all of Carinthia was slowly Christianised.\nWhile Arno was in Rome attending to some of Charlemagne's business in 798, Pope Leo III appointed him Archbishop over the other bishops in Bavaria (Freising, Passau, Regensburg, and S\u00e4ben). When the dispute over the church's border between Salzburg and Aquileia broke out, Charlemagne declared the River Drave to be the border. Arno also began the copying of 150 volumes from the court of Charlemagne. This was the start of the first library in Austria.\nInvestiture Era (1060\u20131213).\nThe first archbishop of the era was Gebhard, who during the Investiture Controversy remained on the side of the Pope. Because of this, Gebhard was exiled for nine years, but was allowed to return shortly before his death and was buried in Admont. His successor Thimo was imprisoned for five years, and suffered a horrible death in 1102. After King Henry IV abdicated and Conrad I of Abensberg was elected Archbishop. Conrad lived in exile until the Calistine Concordat of 1122.\nThe Archbishops again took the side of the Pope during the arguments between the Pope and the Hohenstaufens. Archbishop Eberard I of Hilpolstein-Biburg was allowed to reign in peace, but his successor Conrad II of Austria made the Emperor's angry and died in 1168 in Admont trying to hide from the Emperor. Conrad III of Wittelsbach was appointed the Archbishop of Salzburg in 1177 at the Diet of Venice, after the supporters of both Pope and Emperor were deposed.\nPrince-Bishopric (1213\u20131803).\nArchbishop Eberard II of Truchsess was made a prince of the Empire in 1213, and created three new sees: Chiemsee (1216), Seckau (1218) and Lavant (1225). Eberard was excommunicated in 1245 after refusing to publish a decree deposing the emperor. Eberard died suddenly the next year. During the German Interregnum, Salzburg also suffered confusion. Philip of Carinthia was made ruler of Salzburg, but refused to become a priest. This meant he could not be Archbishop, so he was deposed (sacked) by Ulrich, Bishop of Seckau.\nKing Rudolph I of Habsburg quarrelled with the archbishops. The arguments wer started by Abbot Henry of Admont After Henry died the archbishops and the Habsburgs made peace in 1297. The people and archbishops of Salzburgs remained loyal to the Habsburgs in their struggles against the Wittelsbachs. When the Black Death reached Salzburg in 1347, the Jews were accused of poisoning the wells and suffered severe persecution. The Jews were expelled from Salzburg in 1404. Later, the Jews were allowed to return but were forced to wear pointed hats. Although the Renaissance was a time when new paintings, sculptures and music was being made across Europe, this did not happen in Salzburg because the archbishops were not got rulers, and because of poor conditions in the empire during the reign of Frederick IV.\nConditions were at their worst during the reign of Bernard II of Rohr. The country was in depression, local authorities were raising their own taxes and the Turks were attackingthe archdiocese. In 1473, he summoned the first provincial diet (parliament) in the history of the archbishopric, and eventually abdicated. It was only Leonard of Keutschach (reigned 1495\u20131519) who changedthe situation. He had all the burgermeisters and town councillors (who were charging unfair taxes) arrested at the same time and imprisoned in the castle. His last years were spent in bitter struggle against Matth\u00e4us Lang of Wellenburg, Bishop of Gurk, who succeeded him in 1519.\nArchbishop Paris of Lodron led Salzburg to peace and prosperity during the Thirty Years' War in which the rest of Germany was thoroughly devastated. During the reign of Leopold Anthony of Firmian, Protestants emerged more vigorously than before. He invited the Jesuits to Salzburg and asked for help from the emperor, and finally ordered the Protestants to recant or emigrate - about 30,000 people left and settled in W\u00fcrttemberg, Hanover and East Prussia, and a few settled in Georgia in the United States of America. The last Prince-Archbishop, Hieronymus of Colloredo, is probably the most well known for his patronage of Mozart. His reforms of the church and education alienated himself from the people.\nModern Archbishopric (1803\u2013\"present\").\nIn 1803, Salzburg was secularised (stopped being control by the church) as the Electorate of Salzburg. The former Grand Duke Ferdinand III of Tuscany (brother of Emperor Francis II) was made elector. In 1805 Salzburg became a part of Austria, and in 1809, a part of Bavaria. The Bavarians closed the University of Salzburg, banned monasteries from accepting novices (new monks for training), and banned pilgrimages and processions. The Congress of Vienna returned Salzburg to the Austrians in 1814.\nBishops of Salzburg.\nAbbot-Bishops of Iuvavum c. 300s\u2013c. 482.\n\"Abandoned after c. 482\"\nArchbishops of Salzburg.\nDuchy of Salzburg 1803\u20131805.\nThe secularized Duchy of Salzburg was created in 1803, but annexed by Austria in 1805.

They were put there by Neolithic people in the British Isles and Brittany, and they also occur elsewhere in the world.\nThere may be single standing stones, circles, lines or groups of them. Their dates are mostly from 4000 BC to 1,500 BC. Since Neolithic peoples did not have writing, we know little about their use. It is generally thought they had both practical (meeting place) and ceremonial or religious uses. Pottery that has been found near some of these stones suggest some of them in Europe belonged to the so-called 'Beaker culture'.\nTheir shape is generally uneven and squared, often tapering towards the top. Menhirs can be found across Europe, Africa and Asia, but they are most numerous in Western Europe; in particular in the British Isles (Great Britain and Ireland), and Brittany. There are about 50,000 megaliths in these areas. Standing stones are usually difficult to date, but pottery found underneath some in western Europe connects them with the Beaker people. They were erected as part of a megalithic culture which flourished in Europe and beyond.\nWhere they appear in groups, often in a circular, oval, henge or horseshoe formation, they are sometimes called megalithic monuments. These are sites of ancient religious ceremonies, sometimes containing burial chambers. The developments of radiocarbon dating and tree-ring calibration have added to our knowledge of their timing. In some archaeological sites, the remains of wooden henges can be found. Woodhenge was a henge and timber circle monument in the Stonehenge World Heritage Site in Wiltshire, England. It is 2 miles (3.2\u00a0km) north-east of Stonehenge.\nHistory.\nPractically nothing is known of the social organization or religious beliefs of the people who erected the menhirs. There is not even any trace of their language. We do know that they buried their dead, and had the skills to grow cereal, farm and make pottery, stone tools and jewellery. Some recent research into the megaliths in Brittany suggests a much older origin, perhaps back to six to seven thousand years ago. This is not generally accepted at present."}

He won an \"Outstanding Guest Actor\" Emmy in 2001 for a part on \"The Practice\". He is best known for playing Zep Hindle in the 2004 movie \"Saw\" and Ben Linus in the television series \"Lost\".\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nEmerson was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa and grew up in the nearby town of Toledo, Iowa. He studied theater and art at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, and graduated in 1976. He then moved to New York City. He had trouble finding work as an actor so he took retail jobs and worked as a freelance illustrator. In 1986, he moved with his first wife to Jacksonville, Florida. In Jacksonville, between 1986 to 1993, he was in local productions, and worked as a teacher and director.\nCareer.\nEmerson thought about not being an actor and being a teacher instead, because it is a more stable job. He decided to go back to school and get a Master of Fine Arts. He thought it might help him meet theatre professionals and directors. \nEmerson's first big role was in 1997. He starred as Oscar Wilde in Moises Kaufman's play, \"Gross Indecency: The Trials of Oscar Wilde,\" and then was in many other plays. In 1998, he acted with Uma Thurman in the off-Broadway production of \"The Misanthrope\". In 1999, he played the part of Willie Oban in \"The Iceman Cometh\" with Kevin Spacey. He co-starred with Kate Burton in both \"Give Me Your Answer, Do!\" and \"Hedda Gabler\".\nIn movies and television, Emerson played somewhat dangerous, damaged characters. He played the roles so that the character would seem mysterious. In 2001, he won an Emmy Award as \"Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series\", for playing the (fictional) confessed serial killer William Hinks in several episodes of \"The Practice\".\nOne of Emerson's most well-known works was in 2004, as the character Zep Hindle in the horror movie \"Saw\". In 2006, Emerson began guest-starring on the television series \"Lost\" as Henry Gale/Ben Linus . He was originally planned to be in a small number of episodes, but he returned for season 3 as a main cast member. In 2007, he was nominated for another Emmy Award for his work on the series."}

It was the last battle of the Northern Virginia Campaign during the American Civil War. The battle had two names: the Union side called it the \"Battle of Chantilly\" and the Confederates called it the \"Battle of Ox Hill\".\nBackground.\nConfederate General Robert E. Lee had just won the Second Battle of Bull Run on August 29. The Union Army, commanded by John Pope, started retreating north towards Washington, D.C. Lee wanted to destroy Pope's army. He sent Thomas J. Jackson's corps to march around Pope's army in order to capture the road to Washington. If the Confederates captured the road, Pope would have been surrounded and be forced to surrender.\nOn September 1, Pope found out where Jackson was. He sent Jesse L. Reno with two divisions to attack Jackson. Jackson had stopped on Ox Hill, which was near the Chantilly Plantation. He decided to stop there because he found Pope's army was farther north than he expected.\nThe battle.\nThe first Union commander to arrive at Ox Hill was Isaac Stevens. He decided to attack Jackson's men about 5 p.m. At the same time, a thunderstorm broke out and made some of the solders's ammunition too wet to fire. Many men had to fight with bayonets. Stevens's division made part of the Confederate army retreat. But the Confederates counterattacked and forced Steven's division retreat. During the attack, Stevens was killed.\nAfter Stevens' s attack failed, Philip Kearny's division arrived. Kearny tried to attack the Confederates but he was killed too. After sunset, the Union soldiers retreated from the battlefield.\nAftermath.\nThe Union army lost about 1,000 casaulties in the battle. The Confederates lost about 500 to 600 casualties. Pope continued retreating to Washington on September 2."}

He was born in Bad Goisern, Upper Austria, and died near Klagenfurt, Austria.\nAt the age of 29 he became the youngest member of the Austrian parliament and in 1989 the Governor of Carinthia for the first time.\nHaider lead the Freedom Party to great success so that in 1999 the party reached the second most votes with 27% behind the SP\u00d6 with 33% and could form a coalition with the Austrian People's Party \u00d6VP (having for the first time only the third most votes) making Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel Chancellor of Austria.\nHaider passed his leading position to other party members so that a coalition could take place and returned to Carinthia to work as Governor again.\nIn 2004 Haider was re-elected as Governor of Carinthia. One year later the leading members of the FP\u00d6 as well as there party members in the government together with J\u00f6rg Haider (as their new head) founded a new Party, the BZ\u00d6. In 2006 the BZ\u00d6 party reached the 4% (that time lead under P. Westenthaler) in the Austrian elections and so became part of the Parliament with 7 representatives. For the snap elections in September 2008 he was voted unanimity in his party for the leading position and ran as candidate again for the elections like back in the nineties. Surprisingly the party gained 10.7% and therefore could rise its seats 3 times now having 21 representatives under the lead of J\u00f6rg Haider. However Haider promised before the votes toke place too remain Governor as he would have only changed as of becoming Chancellor. There were possibilities to build a government with J\u00f6rg Haider as chancellor (Haider already achieved to form a coalition where the \u00d6VP under Sch\u00fcssel with the 3rd most votes got the Chancellor) or at least the BZ\u00d6 represented in the government. For this a coalition of BZ\u00d6 with FP\u00d6 and \u00d6VP was necessary, however Haider never got into this position.\nOn 11 October 2008, Haider died in a traffic accident near the town of Klagenfurt. He was returning home after an event that had taken place earlier. Many people living in Carinthia in reaction to his death, left public offerings as flowers, candles, cards and personal messages, Austrian singer and intendant Harald Serafin called the tragic death even an \"Austro-Lady-Diana-Story\"."}

Yagan was blamed for spearing cattle near the Swan River. There were not many cattle in the new colony and food was scarce. Yagan's taking of the settlers animals and food supplies was seen as a very serious crime. After a European was killed, the military started a search for Yagan. He was found after four months and sent to Carnac Island. He escaped after six weeks. One of the soldiers who had got to know him on Carnac Island, compared him to William Wallace.\nYagan's brother was killed in April 1833 while trying to steal flour from a cart. Yagan, Midgigoroo and several others attacked another cart and killed the drivers. They were declared outlaws, which meant they had no legal rights and could be killed by anyone. A reward of \u00a330 was offered for their capture. Midgigoroo was soon captured and executed. Two months later, on 11 July 1833 a shepherd, William Keates, shot and killed Yagan. Keates was killed soon afterwards in another fight with the Aborigines, and his brother claimed the reward for the capture of Yagan. Yagan's head was cut off and sent to England for display. \nAfter a long search his remains were rediscovered in an unmarked grave in Liverpool and returned to Australia in 1997. On 10 July 2010, Yangar was reburied in Perth, at a site now called the Yagan Memorial Park. The park is on the site where Yagan was killed in 1833."}

It is about how the angle and distance of a three-dimensional object is represented on a flat surface. To create a real scene, objects are drawn smaller to show that they are farther away from the person looking at the artwork. The dimensions of an object are also drawn differently depending where the line of sight is. The size of an object's dimensions along the line of sight are usually drawn shorter than dimensions across the line of sight. This is called foreshortening, and is used to create the appearance of three dimensions on a flat surface.\nLandscape paintings have a horizon line. This line represents objects that are infinitely far away. They have shrunk, in the distance, like objects on the Earth's horizon. Changing the height of the horizon level changes the view point for the picture. A person lying on the ground and looking up would have a different view to a person on a ladder looking down.\nBasic concept.\nPerspective works by representing the light that passes from a scene through an imaginary rectangle (the painting), to the viewer's eye. It is similar to a viewer looking through a window and painting what is seen directly onto the windowpane. If viewed from the same spot as the windowpane was painted, the painted image would be identical to what was seen through the unpainted window. Each painted object in the scene is a flat, scaled down version of the object on the other side of the window. "}

The other Clan cats are initially reluctant to accept Firepaw because of his kittypet origins, but he earns a place in the Clan as he is a natural fighter, hunter,and a truly loyal member of ThunderClan.\nFirepaw quickly becomes best friends with the apprentices Graypaw and Ravenpaw, and falls in love with the Clan's medicine cat (a Clan healer with spiritual abilities, forbidden to have a mate or kits) Spottedleaf. He continues his apprenticeship and learns to hunt, fight, survive in the wild and about Clan traditions. He finds another great friend, Yellowfang, an old, grumpy but very profound medicine cat who was exiled from ShadowClan and later accepted into ThunderClan and taken care of by Firepaw.\nThe cats have no natural enemies in the forest, but the Clans occasionally fight with each other to occupy hunting grounds, to settle dissensions, or even to drive each other out from their territories. In an earlier battle to re-occupy a region known as sunning rocks, the ThunderClan deputy (second in command) Redtail loses his life. This happens shortly before Firepaw arrives. Firepaw later learns from Ravenpaw that the deputy was not killed by the enemy Clan but by Tigerclaw, an ambitious ThunderClan warrior. Expecting to be named deputy, he is disturbed when Lionheart is made the new deputy just after Firepaw arrives. Firepaw and Graypaw help Ravenpaw escape the forest to live on a farm as Tigerclaw plans to kill him for knowing about his secret...\nAfter driving out WindClan for more hunting territory, ShadowClan tries to drive out ThunderClan, leading to a battle. Lionheart is killed during the fight, and Tigerclaw is named deputy. After this, Clawface of ShadowClan kills Spottedleaf and steals some ThunderClan kits. Everyone leads to suspect that it was Yellowfang who took the kits, considering she disappeared the moment they revealed Clawface's murder. Firepaw, along with Graypaw, follow Yellowfang's scent to ShadowClan territory, to find out the truth about Spottedleaf and the missing kits. Together, with some help from within ShadowClan, they drive out Brokenstar, the villainous leader of ShadowClan. Yellowfang, having proved her loyalty, becomes ThunderClan's new medicine cat, while Firepaw and Graypaw are made warriors and receive their warrior names, Fireheart and Graystripe."}

This value is estimated as (1~3)\u00d710^-26\u00a0kg/m\u00b3 and it\u2019s calculated when you take the matter-energy density of the universe and divide it by the matter-energy density of the universe that is required to achieve that balance.\nThis is related to the cosmic density parameter in many ways; this term describes the ratio of the actual density value of the Universe to the critical density value. If the ratio is one, then the Universe is at balance, and the Universe is flat and will expand forever. If the ratio is greater than one, then the actual density of the Universe is greater than the critical density, and thus the Universe will eventually become closed and will ultimately end up collapsing in on it self. If the ratio is less than one, then the actual density is less than the critical density, and the Universe is open and expands forever in every direction."}

Non-Euclidean geometry only uses some of the \"postulates\" (assumptions) that Euclidean geometry is based on. In normal geometry, parallel lines can never meet. In non-Euclidean geometry they can meet, either infinitely many times (elliptic geometry), or never (hyperbolic geometry).\nAn example of Non-Euclidian geometry can be seen by drawing lines on a ball or other round object, straight lines that are parallel at the equator can meet at the poles\nOrigin.\nIt is called \"Non-Euclidean\" because it is different from Euclidean geometry, which was discovered by an Ancient Greek mathematician called Euclid. The different names for non-Euclidean geometries came from thinking of \"straight\" lines as curved lines, either curved inwards like an ellipse, or outwards like a hyperbola.\nThe first authors of non-Euclidean geometries were the Hungarian mathematician J\u00e1nos Bolyai and the Russian mathematician Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky, who separately published treatises on hyperbolic geometry around 1830. As well Eugenio Beltrami published book on non-Eucludean geometry in 1868. Others, such as Carl Friedrich Gauss, had earlier ideas, but did not publish their ideas at the time."}

Richard is a woods guide who lives in the area of the world called Westland. Westland is the only part of the world that contains no magic. Westland is set apart from the other lands of the world by a very evil magic boundary. The boundary stops anyone from coming through into the Westland from the Midlands. As a woods guide, Richard leads important political people through the woods to wherever they need to go in Westland. Richard has a brother called Michael Cypher. He is the First Coucilor of Westland. \nRichard's father, George Cypher, was mysteriously killed in the beginning of the book. Because of this, Richard entered a state of sadness. When Richard finds out about an interesting vine left in a jar for him by his dead father, Richard decides to go into the forest to try to find the vine. This leads him to help a traveller escape from 4 men that are chasing her through the forest. The traveller is called Kahlan Amnell, and the people she is running from are called a quad. \nRichard saves Kahlan from the quad. After saving Kahlan, Richard learns that he had just helped someone who had come through the boundary. Before then, it was not heard of for someone to come through the boundary. Richard finds out that Kahlan is looking for the First Wizard. Richard feels that she is in need of help. Because of this, Richard takes Kahlan to his best friend, Zedd.\nWhen he goes to visit his friend, Richard learns that his friend, Zedd, has kept many secrets from him. Richard finds out that Zedd is really the wizard that Kahlan has been looking for. \nKahlan tells Zedd about some of the events that are taking place in the Midlands. Darken Rahl, who is the in the book, is leading an army against the Midlands. After hearing of these events, Zedd decides that Richard is the true Seeker. In doing so, Zedd gives Richard the Sword of Truth. Zedd then decided that they need to cross the boundary to stop Darken Rahl from the world using the magic of the boxes of Orden. \nRichard finds out that the boxes of Orden hold the power of life and death. He also finds out that Darken Rahl needs 3 boxes and needs to open them in the correct order using the information written in the Book of Counted Shadows. Richard was taught the Book of Counted Shadows as a little boy by his father. \nRichard then finds a way through the boundary thanks to his friend, Chase. Chase is a boundary . Boundary wardens are officials who keep people from getting too close to the boundary. Chase tells Richard that there is a pass through the boundary. Chase leads them to the pass.\nAlong the way to the pass, Richard and his friends are attacked by underworld creatures. This encounter leaves both Zedd and Chase in a state of sleep. Soon after this event takes place, Richard and Kahlan reach the home of Adie. Adie is a bone sorcereress, and is the only one who can tell Richard and Kahlan how to get through the boundary. They leave Zedd and Chase in Adie's care, and cross through the boundary. \nAfter they cross into the Midlands, Richard finds out that the Mud People are the only people who knows where the box of Orden is that they need to stop Darken Rahl from taking over the world. After teaching the Mud People how to make roofs that do not leak, they give Ricahrd the information he needs. \nThe book then follows Zedd, Kahlan, Richard, and Chase, as they try to keep the box of Orden from Darken Rahl, who is trying to take over the world.\nWizard's First Rule.\nPeople will believe a lie either because they want to believe it's true or because they are afraid it might be true.\nThis rule was a big part of the story and it was also the way that Richard ends up killing Darken Rahl at the end of the book."}

(series)", "text": "Super Smash Bros., also known as SSB or Smash Bros. or Smash, is a fighting game franchise created by Nintendo. There are five titles in total and features a wide cast of characters from Nintendo. Some of them were featured from third party games. It has been incredibly successful and has garnered a large competitive electronic sports.\nHistory.\n\"Super Smash Bros.\" was first released for Nintendo 64, \"Super Smash Bros. Melee\" was released for Nintendo GameCube, \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\" for the Wii, \"Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U\" was released in 2014 and \"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate\" for Nintendo Switch.\nGameplay.\nMost of the game involves fighting between different characters, called fighters, with the goal being to knock your opponent off of the stage a certain amount of times. When a fighter is hit, they take damage in the form of a percent value. The higher that the percent value is, the easier it will be to knock them off the map. The game features a wide variety of playable stages, characters and gamemodes. At the beginning of the game, players are limited to a smaller cast of characters to choose from, but can unlock the rest of the characters by completing certain tasks, achievements or just after playing for long enough. The characters have different abilities and attacks, but are used by pushing the same buttons\u2014A is for normal attacks, and B is for special abilities or attacks (such as hitting harder or shooting things). These buttons can be used be used in combination with tilting the analog stick in different directions to use different variations of these abilities or different attacks entirely. Normal attacks used with a quickly flicked analog stick can be used to pull off a smash attack (a powerful attack, usually used for launching your opponent off the stage). The controller triggers can be used to shield, which blocks damage from opponents for a few seconds, until it breaks. Players can also use the controller triggers to grab opponents and throw them. A combination of different attacks and abilities can be used to pull off a combo, where the player traps the opponent in a combination of attacks for high damage. There are many complex techniques and tier lists created by the competitive community of the Super Smash Bros. series.\nItems and stages.\nIn some game modes, players can use randomly appearing items to help them damage or KO their opponent. Some of these items include bombs, peaches, baseball bats, assist trophies (which temporarily produces an AI character that attacks opponents), and Smash Balls (which allows the player to unleash a powerful Final Smash attack). Players can choose stages to play on. Most of the stages are based on places in other Nintendo games, such as \"Mario\", \"Donkey Kong\", \"The Legend of Zelda\" and \"EarthBound\", but others (such as the Final Destination stage) are from \"Super Smash Bros.\" In later games, player also have the choice to choose out of 3 different stage versions for every stage. These include the default stage, an Omega version (which turns off items, removes obstacles and makes the stage perfectly flat, so that the stage mimics the Final Destination stage) and a Battlefield version (which turns off items, makes the stage perfectly flat but adds three static platforms above it, so that the stage mimics the Battlefield stage). This feature has been added due to the popularity of using no items on a relatively empty stage in competitive tournaments of the games.\nCharacters.\nThe Smash Bros. series has many characters from many different video games. Most of these are from Nintendo games. Starting with Super Smash Bros. Brawl, characters that were not from Nintendo games were added, such as Solid Snake and Sonic the Hedgehog.\nStages.\nThere are many stages in Super Smash Bros. Many characters have stages and some stages aren't tied to a character at all."}

He started to call himself \"Heartfield\" in 1916, to criticize the rabid nationalism and anti-British sentiment in Germany during World War I.\nCareer.\nIn 1918, Heartfield began at the Berlin Dada scene, and the Communist Party of Germany. He was thrown out of the Reichswehr film service because he supported the strike after the assassination of Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg. With George Grosz, he founded \"Die Pleite\", a satirical magazine. Heartfield started to work for two communist publications: the daily Die Rote Fahne (\"The Red Flag\")and the weekly Arbeiter-Illustrierte-Zeitung (AIZ)(\"Workers' Illustrated Newspaper\"). AIZ published Heartfield's most famous work\nIn 1933, after the National Socialists came to power in Germany, Heartfield moved to Czechoslovakia, where he continued his photomontage work for the \"AIZ\" (which was published in exile); in 1938, the Nazis were preparing to invade Czechoslovakia, so he moved to England, and lived in Hampstead, London. After World War II he settled in East Germany, after 1954 he lived in East Berlin and worked closely with theatre directors such as Benno Besson and Wolfgang Langhoff at Berliner Ensemble and Deutsches Theater.\nIn 2005, Tate Britain held an exhibition of his photomontage pieces.\nWorks.\nHis photomontages satirising Adolf Hitler and the Nazis often used Nazi symbols such as the swastika to change their propaganda message.\nOne of his more famous pieces, made in 1935 entitled \"Hurrah, die Butter ist Alle!\" () was published on the frontpage of the \"AIZ\" in 1935. The photomontage shows a family at a kitchen table, where a nearby portrait of Hitler hangs and the wallpaper is covered with swastikas. The family \u2014 mother, father, old woman, young man, baby, and dog \u2014 are trying to eat pieces of metal, such as chains, bicycle handlebars, and rifles. Below, the title is written in large letters, in addition to a quote by Hermann Goering during food shortage. Translated, the quote reads: \"Iron has always made a nation strong, butter and lard have only made the people fat\". The picture makes fun of a speech Goering made, the quote is shortened to \"Guns before butter\"\nModern culture.\n\"Hurrah, die Butter ist Alle!\" served as the inspiration behind the song \"Metal Postcard (Mittageisen)\" by Siouxsie &amp; the Banshees; the song was re-recorded in German and released as a single with Heartfield's work as the cover art.\nThe Heartfield piece \"The Hand has 5 Fingers\" with its original text: \"5 fingers make a hand! With these 5 grab the enemy!\", was referenced by alternative metal band System of a Down. A text printed on the back of the album \"System of a Down\" reads: \"The hand has five fingers, capable and powerful, with the ability to destroy as well as create\"."}

It is in the southwestern part of the country. Its capital city is Santa Cruz de Barahona.\nIt was created as a \"Maritime District\", an old category given to some regions along the coast, on 12 September 1881. The Dominican Constitution of 1907 changed the Maritime Districts to provinces.\nName.\nThe province takes the name from its capital city, Santa Cruz de Barahona. Barahona is a Spanish last name, and it seems that a Spanish colonist with that name lived in the area.\nLocation.\nBarahona is bordered to the northwest by the province of Baoruco, to the northeast by Azua, to the west by the Independencia province. The Pedernales province is to the southwest and south of Barahona and the Caribbean Sea is to the east.\nHistory.\nThe province was part of the old Azua. It was created as a Maritime District on 12 September 1881 with the municipalities of Santa Cruz de Barahona, Cabral, Duverg\u00e9, Enriquillo and Neiba. Its category was changed to province by the Dominican Constitution of 1907.\nTwo new provinces were created from the original province of Barahona. The Baoruco Province was created in 1943 and then the Pedernales Province in 1957.\nCabral and Enriquillo are municipalities of the province since 1907; later, other municipalities were created: Para\u00edso in 1974; Vicente Noble in 1978; Las Salinas and Polo in 2001; El Pe\u00f1\u00f3n in 2002; Fundaci\u00f3n in 2003; and La Ci\u00e9naga and Jaquimeyes in 2004.\nThe municipal districts of the province were created in:\nPopulation.\nIn (last national census), there were people living in the Barahona province, and 156,513 () living in towns and cities. The population density was persons/km\u00b2.\nIts population represents of the total population of the country and the province is ranked as the 14th (out of 31 plus the National District) more populated province.\n, the total estimated propulation of the province is 188,820 inhabitants.\nThe largest city of the province is Santa Cruz de Barahona, its head municipality or capital, with a population (in 2010) of 62,054 inhabitants.\nGeography.\nThe Barahona province has a total area of . It has 3.6% of the area of the Dominican Republic and it is ranked as the 12th (out of 31 plus the National District) largest province. The altitude of Santa Cruz de Barahona, provincial capital, is .\nThere are two important regions in the province: the valley of the Yaque del Sur river, in the north of the province, and the \"Sierra de Bahoruco\" (\"Bahoruco mountain range\"). Because the Sierra de Bahoruco gets to the coast, most of the population lives on the coast or near the river Yaque del Sur; the only town in the mountains is Polo.\nThe eastern part of Sierra de Neiba is in the northwest of the province and the Sierra Mart\u00edn Garc\u00eda is the limit with the Azua Province, in the northeast.\nThe valley of the river Yaque del Sur is an important farming centre in the southwest because people here uses the water of the river to grow different crops, mainly plantain and sugar cane. The Rinc\u00f3n lake is in this valley; fishing is an important activity in this lake.\nThe Sierra de Bahoruco is in the rest of the province (south, center and west); the part of the Sierra de Bahoruco that is in the province of Barahona is called \"Bahoruco Oriental\" (Eastern Bahoruco) because it is different from the rest of the mountain range. While pines are common in the Sierra de Bahoruco, they are not common in Eastern Bahoruco where there are rainforests because those mountains, and the province, have the Caribbean Sea to the east and winds bring a lot of water that falls on the mountains.\nThe highest mountain in Eastern Bahoruco is Pie de Palo (1,603 m). Other high mountains are Trocha de Pey (1,476 m), La Torre (1,455 m) and Loma Remigio (1,287 m).\nThe most important river of the province is Yaque del Sur. Other rivers are Niza\u00edto (23\u00a0km long) and Bahoruco (14\u00a0km). The river San Rafael is only 3\u00a0km long but many persons go there during summer to enjoy its cool waters and part of its water is taken to the city of Barahona.\nThe climate of the province is a tropical climate, very hot and dry in the valley, but it is cooler on the mountains. In the valley, cacti and other plants of dry regions are common. Rainforests are common in the mountains of the province because it rains a lot in the Bahoruco Oriental.\nThere are three important roads in the province, and they get to the border with Haiti. One of them goes through the province from north to south and gets to Pedernales after crossing the Sierra de Bahoruco by the coast.\nThe other two roads get to Jiman\u00ed; they go around the Lake Enriquillo, one by the northern side and the other by the southern side of the lake.\nMunicipalities.\nThere are 11 municipalities and 11 municipal districts (M.D.) in the province. The municipalities and its municipal districts (M.D.) are:\nEconomy.\nThe main economic activity of the province is agriculture; the main products are coffee in the mountains and plantain and sugar cane in the valley of the river Yaque del Sur.\nOther important economic activities are industry (sugar and textiles) in Santa Cruz de Barahona and fishing along the Caribbean coast."}

In asexual reproduction, the mold makes spores inside a \"sporangium\". When the spores are ready to leave and spread more mold, the sporangium breaks open and lets the spores float out. In sexual reproduction its hyphae touch the hyphae of another \"Rhizopus\" mycelium. When they fuse, they make round balls called \"zygospores\". After some time, the zygospore makes another sporangium, which then makes spores. During this sexual process, genetic recombination takes place, as with all eukaryotes.\nThe spores land on a place where they can turn into a new mold, and begin to grow. They very quickly start making \"hyphae\", small tendrils that look like roots. Hyphae are not roots, but part of the mycelium. The mycelium is the main part of the mold, and grows inside the bread. Black bread mold grows fast when the temperature is higher than 15 degrees Celsius and lower than 20oC.\nBlack bread mold is found in all countries of the world. It is often found growing on bread and on soft fruits such as bananas and grapes. Because the mold spores are airborne, the mold can spread easily."}

Rhythmic gymnasts perform on a floor with an apparatus, accompanied by music, in individual or group events. Gymnasts manipulate one or two apparatus: rope, hoop, ball, clubs, and ribbon. Rhythmic gymnastics is a sport that combines elements of gymnastics, dance, and apparatus manipulation. The victor is the participant who earns the most points, determined by a panel of judges, for leaps, balances, pirouettes, flexibility, apparatus handling, execution, and artistic effect.\nRhythmic gymnastics developed from other sports. It is influenced by group gymnastics, classical ballet, German apparatus work, and the Swedish free exercise method.\nInternational competitions are split between juniors, under sixteen by their year of birth; and seniors, for women sixteen and over again by their year of birth. The largest events in the sport are the Olympic Games, World Championships, and World Cups.\nRhythmic gymnastics was officially recognized by FIG in 1963. The first time rhythmic gymnastics was in the Olympics was in 1984 in Los Angeles. That year, a Canadian gymnast called Lori Fung won the individual competition. In 1996, rhythmic gymnastics group competitions were added to the Olympics.\nRope.\nThe length of the rope depends on how tall the gymnast using it is. They swing the rope, throw and catch the rope, make figure-eights, and more. They also leap and jump through the rope while they are holding it.\nHoop.\nThe hoop is made of wood. Gymnasts toss it and catch it, spin it, swing it, and roll it in many different ways.\nBall.\nBalls used in rhythmic gymnastics are made with rubber or soft plastic. Gymnasts throw balls and catch them, bounce and roll them, balance the ball on their hand, and do waves and circles.\nClubs.\nThe clubs are another piece of equipment that rhythmic gymnasts use.

He said that there was a \"little cloud\" near the Andromeda galaxy.\nOrigin.\nA nebula is usually made up of hydrogen gas and plasma. It may be the first stage of a star's cycle, but it may also be one of the last stages.\nMany nebulae or stars form from the gravitational collapse of gas in the interstellar medium or ISM. As the material contracts, massive stars may form in the center, and their ultraviolet radiation ionises the surrounding gas, making it visible at optical wavelengths.\nThe size of these nebulae, known as H II regions, varies depending on the size of the original cloud of gas. These are sites where star formation occurs. The formed stars are sometimes known as a young, loose cluster.\nSome nebulae are formed as the result of supernova explosions, the death throes of massive, short-lived stars. The materials thrown off from the supernova explosion are ionized by the energy and the compact object that it can produce. One of the best examples of this is the Crab nebula, in Taurus. The supernova event was recorded in the year 1054 and is labelled SN 1054. The compact object that was created after the explosion lies in the center of the Crab Nebula and is a neutron star.\nOther nebulae may form as planetary nebulae. This is the final stage of a low-mass star's life, like Earth's Sun. Stars with a mass up to 8-10 solar masses evolve into red giants and slowly lose their outer layers during pulsations in their atmospheres. When a star has lost enough material, its temperature increases and the ultraviolet radiation it emits can ionize the surrounding nebula that it has thrown off. The nebula is 97% Hydrogen and 3% Helium with trace materials.\nIn the past galaxies and star clusters were also called 'nebulae', but no longer. Nebulae can be sorted by what they look like and why we can see them.\nStar-forming regions and diffuse nebulae.\nLarge regions of ionised hydrogen gas are produced by star-forming regions. Nebulae are often star-forming regions, such as in the Orion complex. In these regions gravitation pulls together gas and dust. Material clumps together to form larger masses, which attract further matter. Eventually this become massive enough to form stars. The material left over may form planets and other planetary system objects.\nEmission nebulae / H II regions.\nEmission nebulae make their own light. They are often called H II regions, because it is the ionized hydrogen which makes them glow. Usually the gases in an emission nebula are ionized. This makes them emit light and infra-red radiation.\nReflection nebulae.\nReflection nebulae reflect light from nearby stars.\nDark nebulae.\nDark nebulae do not emit light or reflect light. They block the light from stars that are far away.\nPlanetary nebulae.\nPlanetary nebulae are quite common, because they are produced by red giant stars late in their lives. These stars usually become white dwarfs, leaving behind an expanding ball of ionized gas, which we see as a roughly circular bright nebula.\nSupernova remnants.\nA supernova occurs when a high-mass star reaches the end of its life. When nuclear fusion in the core of the star stops, the star collapses and explodes . The expanding shell of gas forms a supernova remnant. The Crab nebula is a supernova remnant which probably exploded in 1054 AD. Light and X-ray emission from supernova remnants comes from ionized gas. There is a huge amount of radio emission called synchrotron emission. This emission originates from high-velocity electrons oscillating in magnetic fields."}

He is regarded as a pioneer of eugenics and Nazi eugenics in Germany.\nHaekel was professor of comparative anatomy at the University of Jena, where he worked for 47 years, from 1862 to 1909. Haekel discovered, described and named thousands of new species, mapped a tree of life relating all life forms. He coined many terms in biology, including \"ecology\", \"phylum\", \"phylogeny\", \"stem cell\", and the kingdom \"Protista.\" Haeckel promoted and popularised Charles Darwin's work in Germany and developed the controversial recapitulation theory (\"ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny\"). This claimed that an individual organism's biological development, or ontogeny, parallels and summarises its species' evolutionary development.\nThe published artwork of Haeckel includes over 100 detailed, multi-colour illustrations of animals and sea creatures. As a philosopher, Ernst Haeckel wrote \"Die Weltr\u00e4tsel\" (1895\u20131899, \"The Riddle of the Universe\", 1901), and \"Freedom in Science and Teaching\" to support teaching evolution.\nHaeckel was a member of the nationalist and antisemitic Pan-German League (German: \"Altdeutscher Verband\") and of the peace organization Verband f\u00fcr internationale Verst\u00e4ndigung.\nBooks.\nHaekel wrote many books, some of them in multi-volumes.

Lunar eclipses happen about twice a year, unlike total solar eclipses that are sometimes more than a year apart. They can be seen from a much larger portion of the Earth compared to solar eclipses. Lunar eclipses can last for a few hours, but total solar eclipses last only a few minutes. \nDuring a lunar eclipse, the Moon looks red-brown. It may be thought that the Moon is completely black because of the Earth's shadow, but no. The reddish-brown color is because some of the Sun's light bends through the Earth's atmosphere and shines on the Moon. Refraction is greater for red light rays than for others, so red is what strikes the Moon.\nLike solar eclipses, there are different types of lunar eclipses. There are total eclipses, where the moon passes completely through Earth's shadow and all of the moon appears reddish-brown. A partial eclipse occurs when only part of the moon passes through Earth's shadow and so only part of the moon appears reddish-brown.\nLunar eclipses are safe to view with just your eyes and also with telescopes."}

His full name in Arabic is (). In English, he is usually called \"Avicenna\" (), his Latinized name.\nEarly life.\nAvicenna was born near Bukhara, which at the time was ruled by Samanid dynasty. His father was a government official and his home served as a meeting place for men of learning. Avicenna had educated teachers while growing up. By age 14 he had mastered many subjects and had already memorized the Quran. From the age of 14 to 18 he taught himself because he could not find a tutor to provide more information than he already knew. He began to practice and learn about medicine at 16. He also learned about law and natural sciences. He was good at all subjects but decided medicine was easier for him than mathematics or metaphysics. Sometime before he turned 18 years old, he cured a Samanid emir. Because of his he was allowed into the royal libraries of the Samanid dynasty. By the age of 18 he had become a master of the most important works of science in his time. Also, his reputation as a doctor had grown. At 20 he was regarded as one of the wisest people of his time.\nWritings.\nBesides philosophy and medicine, Avicenna's works includes writings on astronomy, alchemy, geography and geology, psychology, Islamic theology, logic, mathematics, physics and poetry.\nLater life.\nFrom 1015 to 1022, Avicenna was a high official and doctor to the ruler of Hamedan in western Iran. After the ruler of Hamedan died Avicenna was put in prison. He was released four months later when Hamadan was captured by Al\u0101 al-Dawla, the ruler of Isfahan. Al\u0101 al-Dawla only captured Hamadan for a short period of time. Avicenna escaped, disguised as a dervish, to Isfahan to work for Al\u0101 al-Dawla as a doctor. In 1030, the Ghaznavids attacked Isfahan and some of Avicenna's work was lost and possibly stolen. He died during an attack on the city of Hamedan."}

It connects Hokkaido to Aomori Prefecture. This tunnel is the second longest transport tunnel in the world. The tunnel is 53.85 km (33.49 miles) long. 23.3 km (14.5 mile) of the tunnel is underwater. There are two stations in the tunnel. \nHistory.\nThe means of transportation from Hokkaido to Honshu was the Seikan ship until Seikan tunnel was completed. It took about 3 hours. However, it had some troubles. For example, the sea route was not safe. The Toyamaru accident in 1954 had 1155 dead and some missing people, caused by Typhoon Number 15 Roke. because of that reason, the plan that constructing Seikan Tunnel from Hokkaido to Honshu was becoming a reality. At first, the east route and west route was considered. In the west route, the deepest depth of water was 140 meters and the nature of the soil was easy to drill rocks, so west route was then chosen.\nTechniques.\nThe tunnel can be entered by the Shinkansen (bullet train). The inner structure of the tunnel was planned to have three bullet train's rails. Because half of this tunnel is under the bottom of the sea, the workers who built this tunnel were worried about seawater. So, they used new construction techniques. For example, laser measurement, 2150m horizontal drilling, pouring water glass and cement into soft bedrock. These techniques were paid attention to by all of the world at that time. There is still much water, so the seawater that is collected is placed in the tunnel and is pumped out of the tunnel.\nStations.\nThere are two stations in Seikan tunnel. Tappikaitei Station opened in Aza-Minmayatatsuhama, Sotogahama-machi, Higashitsugaru-gun, Aomori on March 13, 1988. And Yoshiokakaitei Station opened in Tatesaki, Fukushima-cho, Matsumae-gun, Hokkaido on March 13, 1988. If passengers have a special ticket, they can get off the train at the stations to look around. These are located in 149.5 meters under the seabed and there are 2247 steps of stairs to the surface. Also, these stations have shelters for train fires and blackouts. Tappikaitei Station and Yoshiokakaitei Station became the service stop each on November 10, 2013 and August 27, 2013. However, these stations were closed on March 15, 2014, because the number of passengers who used these stations, was not a lot."}

The word can also be used for an Ancient Roman building that was used for law and meetings. The word \"basilica\" is Latin which was taken from the Greek \"Basilik\u00e9 Sto\u00e0\".\nNowadays the word is used in three ways:\nHistory.\nAncient Rome.\nA Roman basilica was a large hall built for meetings, business and law. A Roman basilica usually had the doors at the long sides of the building. At each end was a semi-circular part where the judges sat. The building usually had two rows of columns, which made a high central part and a lower aisle on either side. The light came in from windows above the columns. As the Roman Empire spread, every city had a basilica.\nEarly Christian basilicas.\nEarly in the 4th century (312 AD), the Roman Emperor Constantine made Christianity the legal religion of the Roman Empire. The Christians who had been worshipping secretly in private houses now wanted to build churches. They did not want the churches to look the same as Roman Temples. They built them to look more like Roman Basilicas. A basilica was a good plan for a Christian church because lots of people could fit inside, and the aisles were useful for people to move around. The semi-circular part at one end, the \"apse\", was just right to put the altar. Christian basilicas usually have the door at one end, rather than at the side. In front of the door there was often a courtyard called an \"atrium\". Most of these atriums have gone, but churches often have a town square or a market place in front of them.\nSome of the oldest Early Christian basilicas were four that were begun in Rome by the Emperor Constantine. Three of them are still standing, but they have had many changes in the last 1,700 years. These are the basilicas of \"Santa Maria Maggiore\", \"St. John Lateran\" and \"St. Paul's outside the Walls\". The fourth basilica was \"'Old St. Peter's\" which was replaced in the 16th and 17th centuries by the present St. Peter's Basilica. Other Early Christian Basilicas were built in Greece and the Holy Land.\nPresent-day basilicas.\nSome basilicas are called \"Ancient Basilicas\". These have been called basilicas since Early Christian or Medieval times. It is their traditional name. Ancient Basilicas include \"the Church of the Holy Sepulchre\" in Jerusalem, \"the Basilica of San Vitale\" in Ravenna and \"the Basilica of San Lorenzo\" in Rome. The four other \"ancient basilicas\" of Rome are called the \"Major Basilicas\". Each \"Major Basilica\" has a throne for the pope and an altar that is specially for the pope to celebrate mass. No-one else can use that altar without the pope's permission. All the other basilicas are called \"Minor Basilicas\".\nNowadays, for a church to be called a \"Minor Basilica\", it has to be given some special privileges or rights by the pope in a document called a \"Papal Brief\". When a church has been made a basilica, the clergy then carry some special symbols when they are in procession. In 2008 there were more than 1,600 basilicas in the world.\nWhy do churches become basilicas?\n \nAncient basilicas.\nMany churches are given the name \"basilica\" to show that they are special in some way. There are a very few ancient basilicas that were built on a place that was associated with Jesus. They are thought of as some of the holiest Christian sites in the world. These include \"the Basilica of the Annunciation\" in Nazareth, \"the Basilica of All Nations\" where Jesus prayed on the Mount of Olives and \"the Basilica of the Holy Sepulchre\" in Jerusalem. \"The Basilica of the Holy Sepulchre\" is very unusual because the church is shared by the Catholic and Orthodox Churches.\nMartyrs.\nOther ancient basilicas are places where a saint was martyred (put to death). One of these is \"the Basilica of Saint Stephen\", the first Christian Martyr, which is also in Jerusalem. There are many ancient basilicas which were built on the place where a saint was buried. In Rome there are many basilicas like this, because Rome was a very big city, with many Christian people. The Emperors thought Christianity was dangerous to them, because Christians put the rules of Jesus before the law of the Emperor. Many Christians were martyred. When Christianity became legal, churches were built over the graves of martyrs. These churches often became known as basilicas, because they were in the shape of a Roman basilica. Basilicas built over tombs of martyrs include \"Sant'Agnese outside the Walls\", \"San Lorenzo outside the Walls\", and \"St. Paul's outside the Walls\". The words \"outside the walls\" mean that the burial place of the saint was outside the walls of the city.\nRelics.\nSome basilicas are famous because they have \"relics\" (or bones or perhaps a body part) of a saint. It could also be the case that the relics were reinterred from the original place. If a church housed the body of an important saint, then many people would come on pilgrimage and would dedicate themselves to prayer and the use of the sacraments. Basilicas that have bodies include \"St. Mark's\", Venice, \"St. Nicholas of Bari\", also in Italy, and \"the Basilica of St. Mary Magdalene\" in Vezelay, France. Not all relics are bodies. Basilicas may also hold a famous object like a piece of the True Cross, or the belt worn by the Virgin Mary. People often ask whether all these precious relics are authentic. The Roman Catholic Church does not get into arguments about trying to prove whether the pieces of the Cross, the body parts and other things are real. Sometimes the relic is known to be real. Sometimes there is no way to prove it, either way.\nSaints.\nOther basilicas are churches that were built by a famous saint, were used by a famous saint, or were built to honour the saint, who did not die as a martyr but lived a very holy life. Two of the most famous basilicas of this sort are \"the Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi\" and \"the Basilica of St. Anthony of Padua\". Many thousands of pilgrims go to these churches every day to remember two saints who were gentle, humble and taught people to live better lives.\nSigns and Miracles.\nSome basilicas are built because a miracle or special sign took place. The sign might be a vision and might give a plan to build. \"The Basilica of Lourdes\" in France is built at the place where Bernadette Soubirous had a vision of the Virgin Mary. It is an important pilgrimage place. Sometimes the sign is not so strange as a vision. In the Philippines, \"the Basilica del Santo Ni\u00f1o\" was built at the place where a partly burnt box was found in 1565. It contained a little statue of the Christ Child and had been left behind by some Spanish or Portuguese explorers many years earlier. \"Santo Ni\u00f1o\" means \"Holy Child\" in Spanish.\nWell-known basilicas.\nMajor basilicas.\nThe four great Basilicas of Rome, as well as having a seat and an altar for the pope, have a \"Holy Door\" which is only opened for special occasions such as a Jubilee Year."}

The coasts of Harad were settled by the \"Black N\u00famen\u00f3reans\". The peoples living in Harad were often influenced by Sauron and made war with the western realms. In the Fourth Age the Reunited Kingdom of Arnor and Gondor made peace with Harad. In Harad also lived the elephant-like \"m\u00fbmakil\" (or oliphaunts).\nMiddle-earth mountains.\nAmon Hen.\nAmon Hen (Sindarin: \"Hill of the Eye\") is a hill on the west side of the river Anduin, at the southern end of the long lake Nen Hithoel, by the Falls of Rauros. On the other, eastern side of the lake is the hill Amon Lhaw. On Amon Hen the Fellowship of the Ring was broken, and they went in different directions.\nEred Luin.\nThe Ered Luin (Sindarin: Blue Mountains), also known as Ered Lindon, are a mountain range in the far west of Eriador. Until the end of the First Age, the Ered Luin separated Beleriand and Eriador. In the middle of the mountain range is a gap, creating the Gulf of Lh\u00fbn/Lune, where the Grey Havens lie.\nEred Mithrin.\nThe Ered Mithrin (Sindarin: Grey Mountains) is mountain range to the north of Rhovanion. At the western end of the Grey Mountains is Mount Gundabad of the Misty Mountains, east of it lie the Iron Hills.\nEred Nimrais.\nThe Ered Nimrais (Sindarin: \"Whitehorn Mountains\") or White Mountains are a mountain range, which is between Gondor in the south and Rohan in the north. In its western part the White Mountains are separated from the Misty Mountains by the \"Gap of Rohan\", near which is the valley of Helm's Deep. Through the Mountains ran the \"Paths of the Dead\". The easternmost end of the White Mountains is the mountain Mindolluin, on which is the city of Minas Tirith.\nMisty Mountains.\nThe Misty Mountains (or Sindarin Hithaeglir) are a great mountain range, between Eriador in the west and Rhovanion in the east.

The Weather Hills lie next to the Great East Road, about halfway between the Shire and Rivendell. \nOn Weathertop was the Tower of Amon S\u00fbl, a watch-tower built by the kingdom of Arnor. Oneof the \"palant\u00edri\" was kept in the Tower. In T.A. 1409 the Tower was destroyed, and only ruins were left. In October T.A. 3018, Aragorn and the hobbits camped on Weathertop and were attacked by the Ringwraiths; Frodo Baggins was wounded by a Morgul-blade.\nMiddle-earth rivers.\nAnduin.\nThe Anduin is the largest river in Middle-earth. It comes out of the Grey Mountains and flows through Rhovanion and the Emyn Muil. There it goes through the rapids of Sarn Gebir and into the long lake Nen Hithoel, after which it falls down the Falls of Rauros. After that the river Anduin flows between the White Mountains and the Mountains of Shadow. It flows into the sea in a broad river delta, which is called the Mouths of Anduin or the Ethir Anduin.\nBruinen.\nBruinen or Loudwater was a river in Eriador. It began in the Misty Mountains, and flowed south, through the valley of Rivendell, and into the river Mitheithel.\nBaranduin.\nThe Baranduin or Brandywine River is a river in Eriador. It begins out of Lake Evendim in northern Eriador, and flows south. It flows through the Shire, and at last into the sea.\nOther Middle-earth locations.\nArnor.\nArnor was a human realm in Eriador. It was founded by Elendil and his people, who survived the Fall of N\u00famenor towards the end of the Second Age. The peoples living in Arnor were the descendants of the N\u00famenorean survivors, and the indigenous human peoples who had lived there before. The capital of Arnor was the city Ann\u00faminas on the shores of Lake Evendim in northern Eriador. Elendil became the first King of Arnor; after his death, his older son Isildur became King.\nAfter the death of the tenth king, E\u00e4rendur, in T.A. 861, his three sons split Arnor into three new lands, one for each of them: Arthedain in the west, Cardolan in the south, and Rhudaur in the north. With time, all three countries were destroyed in wars against the northern land Angmar.\nAfter the War of the Ring, the land again became part of the Reunited Kingdom of Arnor and Gondor, ruled by King Elessar Telcontar and his descentants.\nBree-land.\nBree-land is a small region in Eriador, which is around the Breehill. It has four villages: Bree (the biggest), Archet, Combe and Staddle. The peoples living in the villages of Bree-land are Men and Hobbits; it is the only place where both people live together. The only other place inhabited by Hobbits is the Shire.\nBree is at the meeting point of two large roads, the Great East Road and the North-South Road, which made it an important centre of trade and travel.\nErebor.\nThe Lonely Mountain or Sindarin Erebor is a mountain in the northeast of Rhovanion. When the dwarves had to leave their ancient home Khazad-d\u00fbm, it became the new home of Durin's folk. They were led by Thr\u00e1in I, who became \"King under the Mountain\". Later Erebor was attacked by the dragon Smaug, and the dwarves had to flee again. In the story told in \"The Hobbit\", the dragon Smaug is killed and the dwarves again return to the Lonely Mountain. D\u00e1in II Ironfoot becomes new King under the Mountain.\nEsgaroth.\nEsgaroth or Lake-town is a town in the northeast of Rhovanion. It is built at the Long Lake, south of the Lonely Mountain and east of Mirkwood. It was destroyed by the dragon Smaug, but was rebuilt.\nFangorn.\nFangorn or Fangorn Forest is a large forest on the eastern side of the southern end of the Misty Mountains. Fangorn is the only known home of the Ents, a people of giant tree-like beings. The Sindarin word \"Fangorn\" translates to \"Beardtree\", and is also the Sindarin name of the Ent Treebeard.\nGondor.\nGondor was a human realm in southeastern Middle-earth. It was founded by the brothers Isildur and An\u00e1rion and their people, who had survived the Fall of N\u00famenor towards the end of the Second Age.\nIn the later part of the Third Age, Gondor was between the sea in the south, the Mountains of Shadow in the east, and the White Mountains in the north; in earlier times the land of Gondor reached farther north. The city Osgiliath, built over the river Anduin, became the capital of Gondor. Isildur also founded the city Minas Ithil east of the Anduin, and his brother An\u00e1rion founded the city Minas Anor west of the Anduin on the mountain Mindolluin.\nGondor had several regions. Ithilien is in the east, between the river Anduin in the west and the Mountains of Shadow in the east. An\u00f3rien was a small land north of the White Mountains, between the river Anduin in the east and Rohan in the west. Calenardhon was the land north of the White Mountains, which later became Rohan in the 26th century T.A. Enedwaith was northwest of the White Mountains, which was mostly abandoned in the later part of the Third Age. Between the coast and the White Mountains were several regions, from the west to the Anduin in the east. Near the seashore in the south were the regions Anfalas, Belfalas, Dor-en-Ernil, Lebennin, and Lossarnach. Along the Mountains in the north were the Morthond Vale, Lamedon, and the Ringl\u00f3 Vale. Southeast of the Anduin was the region South Gondor.\nAfter the \"War of the Last Alliance of Elves and Men\" against Sauron, Isildur left to rule the northern kingdom Arnor, while the son of An\u00e1rion stayed to rule Gondor.\nIn the 15th century there was a great civil war, the city Osgiliath was destroyed, and Minas Anor became the new capital.\nDuring the time of the rule of King E\u00e4rnur, the Ringwraiths captured Minas Ithil, and it was renamed Minas Morgul. Minas Anor was renamed Minas Tirith (\"Tower of Guard\"). Both cities were in a constant state of war, much of the action taking place around or in the former capital of Osgiliath. During the War of the Ring, Gondorian-controlled Western Osgiliath fell to Mordor, allowing Sauron to attack Minas Tirith. The Orcs attacked the city, but the coming of the Rohirrim forced them to stop, allowing the defenders to charge the enemy. The Battle of the Pelennor Fields was won by the Men of Gondor and Rohan.\nThe last King, E\u00e4rnur, disappeared in 2050 of the Third Age. After this Gondor was ruled by the \"Stewards of Gondor\" instead of a king until the end of the Third Age.\nAfter the War of the Ring, the land became part of the Reunited Kingdom of Arnor and Gondor, ruled by King Elessar Telcontar and his descendants.\nGreat East Road.\nThe Great East Road is an ancient Dwarven road, which ran from western Beleriand, over the Ered Luin, through the Shire, to the Misty Mountains, and to the dwarven lands in the east.\nHelm's Deep.\nHelm's Deep was a deep valley on the north side of the western part of the White Mountains, south to the \"Gap of Rohan\". The valley was blocked by a natural series of hills called Helm's Dike. Behind this lay a fortress: the Hornburg. At the end of the valley is the entrance to the Glittering Caves.\nIsengard.\nIsengard is a fortress at the southern end of the Misty Mountains. It is a small valley inside a ring-shaped wall, the Ring of Isengard, and in its middle is a tall black tower, Orthanc.\nIt belonged to Gondor, but in the 28th century it was given to Saruman. It housed a palant\u00edr. In the War of the Ring the Ents destroyed the ring-wall. After the War, the tower Orthanc was given back to King Elessar and the Reunited Kingdom.\nKhazad-d\u00fbm.\nKhazad-d\u00fbm was the ancient home of the Dwarves under the Misty Mountains. It was a great underground city and mines. It was the only place in Middle-earth where the precious metal \"mithril\" could be found, which made the dwarves very rich.\nKhazad-d\u00fbm was founded by Durin the Deathless early in the First Age, long before the rise of the Sun and Moon. \nIn the Third Age the dwarves woke a Balrog deep in the mines of Khazad-d\u00fbm. The Balrog killed King Durin VI and many Dwarves, and the surviving Dwarves had to flee and left for other places. Khazad-d\u00fbm got a new name, Moria, which is Sindarin for \"dark pit\".\nLothl\u00f3rien.\nLothl\u00f3rien was an elven realm, between the Misty Mountains and the Anduin. It lay on the land between the rivers Anduin and Silverlode, close to the dwarven realm Khazad-d\u00fbm. Lothl\u00f3rien was founded in the Second Age, and Amd\u00edr became the first King. The elves of Lothl\u00f3rien fought in the War of the Last Alliance of Elves and Men against Sauron. In the war Amd\u00edr was killed, and his son Amroth became king after him, but Amroth later left Lothl\u00f3rien. Since then until the end of the Third Age it was ruled by Lord Celeborn and Lady Galadriel. Caras Galadhon was the main city of Lothl\u00f3rien. Other names of Lothl\u00f3rien are the shortened form L\u00f3rien, and the names Laurelind\u00f3renan, Dwimordene (Rohirric), or The Golden Wood.\nMordor.\nMordor (Sindarin: \"Black Land\" and Quenya: \"Land of Shadow\") is a land in the southeastern part of Middle-earth, east of the Anduin. It was the land of Sauron in the Second and Third Age.\nMordor is surrounded by mountain ranges: the Ered Lithui (Sindarin: \"Mountains of Ash\") in the north, the Ephel D\u00faath (Sindarin: Mountains of Shadow) in the west and another mountain range in the south. In the northwest is the plateau Gorgoroth. At the foothills of the Ered Lithui in northwestern Mordor was Sauron's main fortress Barad-d\u00fbr. Southwest of Barad-d\u00fbr lay the volcano Mount Doom.\nParts of Mordor are a wasteland. The southern part of Mordor, around the Sea of N\u00farnen was more fertile and used as farmland, to produce food for Sauron's armies.\nMirkwood.\nMirkwood is a large forest in Rhovanion. Originally it was known as Greenwood the Great (Sindarin: \"Eryn Galen\"). \nIn the Second Age an Elven people settled in the Greenwood, founding the Woodland Realm, with its capital on the hill Amon Lanc. After the end of the Second Age, the Elves went to live farther north. In the 11th century of the Third Age, Sauron settled himself in the hill-fortress of Dol Guldur on Amon Lanc in the south of the forest. His evil influence darkened the woods, although it lessened towards the north; after this the forest became known as \"Mirkwood\". After the War of the Ring the forest was cleared of Sauron's influence and became known as Eryn Lasgalen (Sindarin: \"Wood of Greenleaves\").\nNorth-South Road.\nThe North-South Road is a long road running from the realm of Arnor in the north to Gondor in the south. The road began in the city Fornost Erain, the capital of Arthedain, crossed the Great East Road at Bree, and ran farther to the southern end of the Misty Mountains. There the road turned east, towards the cities Minas Tirith, to Osgiliath, and ended at Minas Ithil.\nA part of the road south of Bree is also known as the Greenway.\nRivendell.\nRivendell (Sindarin: Imladris, Westron: \"Karningul\") was an elven city in eastern Eriador. It was founded in the Second Age by Elrond, who ruled it until the end of the Third Age.\nRohan.\nRohan or the Riddermark (or short The Mark) was a human realm in southeastern Middle-earth, north of Gondor. Rohan lay north of the White Mountains, southeast of Isengard and southwest of the Emyn Muil. Originally it was a part of Gondor, and named Calenardhon. The capital of Rohan is Edoras, with the king's hall Meduseld.\nBut because of the plague in 1636 T.A. and the later wars, Calenardhon was mostly empty and very few people lived there. In 2509 T.A. the Rohirrim came south from the north, to help Gondor fight against a combined invasion of Men from the north-east and Orcs from Mordor. The Rohirrim helped Gondor win the \"Battle of the Field of Celebrant\" and the war. As a reward, Steward Cirion of Gondor gave the land Calenardhon to the Rohirrim. The King of the Rohirrim, Eorl the Young, swore the \"Oath of Eorl\": that Rohan would come and help Gondor, if it needed help in its wars. Afterwards, the people of the Rohirrim moved into their new land, which they named the \"Riddermark\" or just \"The Mark\". Gondor called the land \"Rohan\" (Sindarin: \"Land of the Horse-lords\").\nThe Shire.\nThe Shire is a land in Eriador. It is settled by Hobbits. Its name in Westron was S\u00fbza \"Shire\" or S\u00fbzat \"The Shire\". Its name in Sindarin was i Drann.\nThe Shire was settled by the Hobbits in the 24th century of the Third Age. It is divided into four \"Farthings\": the North-, West-, South- and Eastfarthing. The leaders of the Shire were \"the Mayor\" of Michel Delving, \"the Thain\" from Tuckborough and \"the Master of Buckland\".\nN\u00famenor.\nN\u00famenor was a huge star-shaped island west of Middle-earth in the Second Age. At the beginning of the Age it was given to the human peoples who had helped the elves in the wars against Morgoth. In the middle of the island was the mountain Meneltarma, which was a holy place for the N\u00famenoreans. N\u00famenor was divided into six regions, one in each \"star-arm\" and one in the middle. The regions were Forostar (\"Northlands\"), Andustar (\"Westlands\"), Hyarnustar (\"Southwestlands\"), Hyarrostar (\"Southeastlands\"), Orrostar (\"Eastlands\"), and the central region Mittalmar (\"Inlands\").\nIn eastern Mittalmar was the region Arandor (\"Kingsland\"), with the capital city Armenelos, and the haven R\u00f3menna. \nTheir first king was Elros Tar-Minyatur, brother of Elrond. N\u00famenor became the most powerful nation of Men. But later many N\u00famenoreans, including their kings, became power-hungry and became enemies of the elves. Towards the end of the Second Age, when it was ruled by King Ar-Pharaz\u00f4n the Golden, N\u00famenor was destroyed and sank in the sea, similar to the legendary Atlantis. Only a group of N\u00famenoreans led by Elendil, the \"Elendili\" (\"Elf-friends\") or \"the Faithful\", could escape the destruction of N\u00famenor and came to Middle-earth, where they founded the realms Arnor and Gondor. The \"Akallab\u00eath\" is the story of N\u00famenor's history and downfall.\nSome of the many names of N\u00famenor were \"Westernesse\", \"N\u00famen\u00f3r\u00eb\" (Quenya, the long form of \"N\u00famenor\") and \"Anad\u00fbn\u00ea\" (Ad\u00fbnaic), both meaning \"West-land\"; \"Andor\" (Quenya) and \"Y\u00f4z\u00e2yan\" (Ad\u00fbnaic), which both mean \"the Land of the Gift\". Later it was also called \"Atalant\u00eb\" (Quenya) and \"Akallab\u00eath\" (Ad\u00fbnaic), both meaning \"the Downfallen\"."}

K. Rowling. She was sorted in the House of Ravenclaw and first appears in the movies and the books in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. \nMany people in the Harry Potter series think she is a strange girl. This has led to her having the nickname \"Loony Lovegood\", but she does not change herself. She is the daughter of Xenophilius Lovegood and Pandora Lovegood, and lives near the Weasley's house, in a black tower. She was in her first year at Hogwarts School Of Witchcraft and Wizardry in Harry Potter's second year Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and was in her fourth year when she first came into the series.\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.\nWhile Luna is not directly mentioned in this book, her existence is first alluded to at Stoatshead Hill where the Weasley family, minus Mrs. Weasley, along with Harry and Hermione meet Amos Diggory and his son Cedric to catch a Portkey to the Quidditch World Cup. The Lovegood family is mentioned when Amos asks Arthur if they are expecting more wizards to meet them at the Portkey. Arthur replies that the Fawcetts were unable to get tickets and the Lovegoods arrived a week earlier.\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.\nIn Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Harry first meets Luna (in her fourth year) on the Hogwarts Express train where is described as having straggly (messy), waist-length, dirty blonde hair and a distant dreamy, look. Harry thinks that she is odd because she was reading The Quibbler upside-down, and wearing a necklace made of butterbeer corks and radish earrings. When Harry first sees the Thestrals (black horse like creatures that can fly) pulling the carts, Luna tells him that she can see them too. Both Harry and Luna could see the Thestrals when most others could not because they had both seen death, and Thestrals can only be seen by someone who has witnessed death. \nLater, Luna tells Harry that she and her father believe him about the conspiracy involving Harry, and that they support him. When Harry forms Dumbledore's Army, Luna joins and gets better at defensive magic. When Gryffindor's Quidditch team played against Slytherin, Luna supported Gryffindor by making a life size lion hat that roared realistically. Later in the book, when Harry was going to contact Kreacher about the location of Sirius Black, Luna kept watch for him, telling everyone that there was a gas leak. When Professor Umbridge's Inquisitorial Squad (a group of students who were given power over other students to punish) found him, Luna was captured and held by a Slytherin. While being held, Harry saw her looking out the window, as if she was bored. After they had escaped, it was Luna's idea to travel to the Ministry of Magic by Thestrals. During the battle at the Department of Mysteries, Luna took an active part in the fighting, until she was hit by a Stunning spell that knock her briefly unconscious. After Sirius's death Harry noted that Luna was the only person that could truly comfort him about it, because, like Harry, Luna had also lost someone close to her, her mother.\nHarry Potter and the Half Blood Prince.\nHarry first meets Luna again on the Hogwarts Express when he sits with her in a compartment, with Neville Longbottom. When some admirers of Harry's say that he could sit with them, Harry declines, saying that Luna and Neville \"are cool\". Later in the year, near Christmas, Harry invited Luna to be his guest at Professor Slughorn's party; Harry noted that she looked pretty, she wore a \"spangled silver dress\", and while at the party, she talked to vampires and shared her off-beat beliefs. That send Harry into coughing with laughter.\nSoon after the Party, Luna was the commentator at a Quidditch (which is a game played at Hogwarts) match, in which she went off on side topics by saying that the Hufflepuff Chaser, Zacharias Smith suffered from \"Losers' Lurgy\" and she also pointed out oddly shaped clouds, and often forgot players names. Although Professor McGonagall was annoyed, a lot of students found her commentary highly amusing. At the end of the year, Luna patrolled the corridors in search of Death Eaters.\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.\nHarry first meets Luna this time at Bill and Fleur's wedding, in which she and her father, Xenophilius Lovegood wore \"egg yolk\" yellow robes. Later, Luna was captured on the Hogwarts Express by Death Eaters because her father wrote the truth about Harry in The Quibbler. Harry assists Luna out of Malfoy Manor, where she had been taken hostage, and she comforted Mr. Ollivander (who had also been taken prisoner because Voldemort needed information from him), by sharing her beliefs. \nAt Dobby's funeral, Luna gave a nice eulogy which calmed everyone, thanking Dobby for rescuing them all from Malfoy Manor. Later when Harry had to find Ravenclaw's lost diadem, Luna escorted him into the Ravenclaw common room, where she also stunned Alecto Carrow, a Death Eater. At the Battle of Hogwarts, she cast her Hare Patronus, which made several approaching Dementors leave, and she also fought Bellatrix Lestrange. After the Battle, Luna created a distraction, so that Harry could be alone.\nAfter the Series.\nJ.K. Rowling said in an interview that Luna became a Magizoologist, the 'Wizard equivalent of a naturalist' and she married fellow naturalist Rolf Scamander. Somewhere in between 2008 and 2011 she had 2 twin sons named Lorcas and Lysander."}

A class is written by a programmer in a defined structure to create an object (computer science) in an object oriented programming language.\u00a0It defines a set of properties and methods that are common to all objects of one type. \nFor example, a class could be a car, which could have a color field, four tire fields, and a drive method.\nAnother related class could be a truck, which would have similar fields, but not be exactly the same as a car. Both a car and a truck could be a kind of a third class which could be called a vehicle class. In this way, the programmer could create the parts of the program that are the same for both the car and the truck in programming the vehicle class, yet the programmer would be free to program how a car is different from a truck without duplicating all of the programming.\nIn this example, there are three classes: 1) a class called \"car\", 2) a class called \"pick-up truck\", and 3) a class called \"vehicle\". These classes would be used to make objects. Although there is only one class called \"car\", there could be many objects that are created from the class called \"car\". And, although there is only one class that is called \"truck\", many objects of type truck could be created from this class. The \"vehicle\" class is actually general and there would probably not be any objects that were only of the class \"vehicle\". But a car would be a kind of vehicle and a truck would also be a kind of vehicle. So, you could say that both cars and trucks are from the same class, vehicle.\nInside of classes are two kinds of things: methods and fields (or properties). Methods can store the code for doing actions; in this example you could have a drive method and a brake method, and maybe a turnRight and turnLeft method. Fields store data; you could have a color field, a speed field and a size field. You can call methods by first making an object of the Car or Truck class, and call it for example ferrari, and doing ferrari.methodName(). In this case, if we wanted to make the vehicle move, we could do ferrari.drive().\nExample.\nHere is an example realized with Java. Please notice that all unnecessary aspects are left out.\npublic class vehicle { // base class for all vehicles\n String color; // field color\n int position; // field position\n public void drive(int distance) { // method drive\n this.position += distance;\npublic class car extends vehicle {\n int persons; // a new field called persons\n public void getIn() { // method to get into the car\n this.persons++;\n \n public void getOut() { // method to get out of the car\n this.persons--;\npublic class truck extends vehicle {\n String load; // a new field called load\n public void load(String load) { // method to load the truck\n this.load = load;\n \n public String unload() { // method to unload the truck\n String oldLoad = this.load;\n this.load = null;\n return oldLoad;"}

It is from the family Cheloniidae. \nLoggerheads live in the seas around the world. Most of the beaches where loggerheads lay eggs are found on the coasts of the United States in North America (mostly in Florida), Oman in Asia, and Australia in the Pacific Ocean. Some loggerheads also live near other countries like Chile, Greece, and Indonesia.\nHow they live.\nLoggerheads eat fish, squid, jellyfish, crabs, and other small sea animals. Loggerheads mate while they are moving in the seas mostly from March to June every 2 or 3 years. When they are ready to lay eggs female loggerheads always come back to the same beach where they came out of their eggs as babies. Most loggerheads lay eggs in June and July. Most lay between 100 and 126 eggs. The eggs look much like ping-pong balls.\nWhen they come out of the eggs baby loggerheads are called \"hatchlings\". They usually come out at night so that other animals, like birds and crabs, do not eat them. The hatchlings follow light from the morning sun to the sea. They swim out to parts of the ocean that have seaweed (plants that grow in the sea) to hide from other animals while they grow.\nMost loggerheads move to warm waters during months that are colder but some hibernate, or sleep for long times, when it is cold. When they are hibernating they can stay under the water for up to seven hours before coming up for air.\nLoggerheads live 30 to 50 years or more.\nProtecting them from people.\nIn the past loggerhead sea turtles were hunted by people for meat and for their eggs. Also their fat and shells were used to make medicines, combs, and other things. The number of loggerheads today is small and so governments in many countries have laws that do not allow them to be hunted anymore.\nThe main danger for loggerheads now is the nets used by fishermen which can accidentally kill the turtles. They are also killed by boats, fishing hooks, and other dangers from people.\nCivilization is harming the loggerhead reproduction cycle, due to beach construction."}

{"id": "97356", "revid": "586", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=97356", "title": "Gian Lorenzo Bernini", "text": "Gian Lorenzo (or Gianlorenzo) Bernini (, , ; Giovanni Lorenzo; 7 December 159828 November 1680) was one of the greatest artists of the Italian Baroque period. He was famous both for his sculpture and his architecture. From 1627, he worked for Pope Urban XIII and then for Pope Alexander VII at St. Peter's Basilica where he designed the famous \"piazza\" (place) in front of the basilica and many of the most splendid things that are inside.\nEarly life.\nBernini was born in Naples, Italy. He was the son of Pietro Bernini (1562-1629) who was a well known sculptor. When he was about 7 years old, his father took him to Rome.\nInspiration.\nAs a boy and as a young man living in Rome, he saw the works of many famous artists. He saw the famous fresco paintings on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel by Michelangelo, one of the most famous artists of the 1500s. The paintings told the Bible story of Creation. He saw the huge dome of St. Peter's Basilica which Michelangelo designed and the new extension to the building that was being built by Carlo Maderna.\nWorks.\nOne artist who Bernini knew well was Annibale Carracci who painted scenes on the ceilings of rooms for the pope. The scenes told stories, often Ancient Roman legends. Carracci took Bernini into St. Peter's Basilica. Bernini fell on his knees and decided at that moment that he wanted to make something beautiful and splendid to honour Saint Peter.\nAnother artist whose work Bernini saw was Caravaggio. Caravaggio's paintings were nothing like Carracci's. Carracci's pictures were bright, lively and colourful. Caravaggio's pictures were dark, sad and often frightening. But looking into Caravaggio's paintings was like looking at something that was really happening while you were watching. The people in Caravaggio's paintings looked as if they could breathe, speak and feel pain.\nBy the time he was 20, Bernini was a sculptor, carving statues out of marble. He had learnt a lot, not just how to carve marble, which he learnt from his father, but how to make figures that told stories like Carracci's and Michelangelo's and seemed to be alive, like Caravaggio's. An important man in the Roman Catholic Church, Cardinal Scipione Borghese, saw his work and became his patron, paying Bernini to make many beautiful sculptures for him and his family. Soon the cardinal's uncle got to hear about Bernini. He was Pope Urban VIII, the most powerful man in Italy. He asked Bernini to work for him at St. Peter's Basilica. Bernini spent 40 years of his life there, all the time except for a trip to France and shorter visits to other cities.\nBernini's sculpture.\nMost sculptures of that time were just of one figure. But Bernini had seen Michelangelo's famous sculpture of the \"Pieta\" which showed the Virgin Mary grieving over the body of her dead son, Jesus. Bernini made figures that were in groups and told stories. One of his famous groups comes from Roman Mythology. It shows the god, Apollo chasing a beautiful wood nymph (a sort of fairy) that he had fallen in love with. But her father had magic powers and suddenly turned his daughter into a tree. Bernini sculptured the very moment when her toes are turning into roots, her legs are becoming the trunk, and leaves are sprouting out of her hands and long hair. She has her mouth open and a look of horror on her face. No-one had ever tried to carve anything like that in marble before. The thing that is so amazing about Bernini's sculpture is that he has made the flesh, the wood, the leaves and the hair all look so real, even though they are all carved in white stone.\nBernini's most famous sculpture is \"St. Theresa in Ecstasy\". It tells the story of a saint who had a vision of an angel. Her vision was so beautiful that she fainted. Bernini has sculptured the vision, with St. Theresa lying on a cloud with the laughing angel in front of her. Their robes are blowing around, and it is hard to believe that the whole scene, which is set against a wall, is not really floating. Bernini did not just design the statues. He also designed the walls of the chapel around it, which is like a stage-set, made of beautifully patterned marble. Against another wall, he carved a balcony and several white marble people looking at the scene. They are members of the family that paid for the chapel.\nThe city of Rome has lots of squares with fountains in them. Pope Alexander wanted to make the city more beautiful, so during his time, more fountains were made. One of the biggest squares in Rome was the Piazza Navona. On one side of the piazza was the church of St. Agnes, built by Borromini. Bernini thought it was an ugly building. He was asked to make the \"Fountain of the Rivers\" in the square, right outside the church. It has four figures who are symbols of four rivers. Bernini carved one of river-figures looking up at the church and throwing his hands in the air in shock at its ugliness. Borromini was very upset with Bernini's joke, which has been there now for more than 300 years.\nBernini at St. Peter's.\nBaldacchino and niches.\nBernini's first work at St. Peter's was to design the \"baldacchino\" which is like a tent or \"pavilion\" above the High Altar. This amazing thing is 30 metres (98\u00a0ft) tall and is probably the largest piece of bronze in the world. It stands underneath Michelangelo's dome and has four huge bronze twisted columns decorated with olive leaves and bees, because bees were the symbol of Pope Urban. Pope Urban had a niece that he loved very much and he got Bernini to put her face and the face of her new-born baby boy on the columns as well.\nHolding up the dome of the Basilica were four enormous stone pillars (piers). Bernini had a great idea for the big piers. He had four hollow \"niches\" carved into them where four huge statues could stand. This sent some people into a panic because they thought the dome would fall down, but it did not.\nThe basilica owns some precious relics: a piece of the True Cross of Jesus, a veil that a woman wiped the face of Jesus with, while he was carrying the cross, the spear that was used to pierce Jesus side, and the bones of St. Andrew, the brother of St. Peter. No-one knows for sure whether these things are real or not, but for hundreds of years they have been precious. Bernini's plan was the make four marble statues of the four Holy people: St. Helena who found the cross, St. Longinus who was the soldier with the spear, St Veronica who wiped Jesus' face and St. Andrew. Even though the design is Bernini's, the statues, which are all 5 metres high, were made by four different sculptors. Only St. Longinus is the work of Bernini.\nThe chair of St. Peter.\nBernini's next job was to make a special throne out of bronze, to hold an ancient wood and ivory throne that had been at the basilica for more than 500 years. It is called the \"Cattedra Petri\" or \"throne of St. Peter\". The bronze throne, with the old wooden throne inside it, is held up high at the end of the basilica, by four important saints who are called \"Doctors of the Church\" because they were all great writers and teachers. The statues are made of bronze. They are Saints Ambrose and Augustine for the Church of Rome and Saints Athanasius and John Chrysostum for the Orthodox Church. Above the chair is a window which is made not from glass but thin translucent stone called alabaster. The Dove of the Holy Spirit is in the middle of the window with rays of light spreading out into the basilica through a sculpture of golden clouds and angels. Bernini designed this to look like a window into Heaven. There was a great celebration when the chair was put in place on January 16, 1666.\nSt. Peter's Piazza.\nTo the west of the basilica is the \"Piazza di San Pietro\" (St. Peter's Place). The piazza was designed by Bernini and built between 1656 and 1667. It was not an easy job because the designer had lots of things to think about. Firstly, many people complained that Maderna's \"facade\" on St. Peter's looked too wide, so Bernini wanted to make it look narrower, not wider. Secondly, in the old square left over from the Old St. Peter's, Pope Sixtus V had a monument set up. This monument was a precious Ancient Egyptian \"obelisk\" (which is like a tall column, but with four flat sides). From its base to the top of the cross (that the pope had put on top) it was 40 metres (131\u00a0ft) high, and had been brought to Roman in ancient times. The obelisk really should be at the centre of the new square, but it was not in quite the right place, and was very difficult to move without breaking. The third problem was that Maderna had built a fountain to one side of the obelisk, and Bernini needed to make another fountain to match it, otherwise the design would look unbalanced.\nBernini solved the problem by making two areas, instead of one huge one. The first area is an almost-square area right in front of the facade. It is cleverly designed with sloping sides that make the building look taller and not so wide. The second part of the piazza is oval. It has the obelisk at the centre with two fountains on either side at the widest part. The two parts of the piazza are surrounded by a \"colonnade\" (covered walk-way) which is carried on tall columns. All around are large statues of saints which seem to look down on the thousands of visitors that come to the square every day. The colonnade is in two great arcs that seem to stretch out like loving arms, welcoming people to the Basilica. In recent times some buildings were demolished, making another square, to match the one near the piazza. It is a good place for vans to park and can be seen in the photo.\nThe famous architectural historian, Sir Banister Fletcher, said that no other city in the world had given such a wonderful view to people visiting their main church. He said that no other architect except Bernini could have imagined such a noble design. He said it is the greatest entrance to the greatest Christian church in the whole world.\nThe Chapel of the Sacrament.\nBernini's last work for St. Peter's, 1676, was to decorate of the Chapel of the Sacrament. He designed a miniature temple just like the one that was built over the place where St. Peter died. He made it bronze covered with fine gold. On either side is an angel, one gazing in adoration and the other looking towards the viewer in welcome. Bernini died in 1680 aged 81, after working for St. Peter's for 40 years of his life."}

To get wind data, they can be tracked by radar, radio direction finding, or navigation systems (such as the satellite based Global Positioning System). \nThe invention of the weather balloon started the age of remote sensing, the ability to collect information where there are no people. Weather balloons are a major tool of atmospheric research. High altitude balloons have also been used by astronomers and cosmologists to take readings of certain particle frequencies or gather light readings free of excessive disturbance from Earth's lower atmosphere (troposphere).\nThe first observation balloon was launched immediately before the first manned balloon flight by Frenchmen Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Rozier and the Marquis d'Aalandes on November 21, 1783, for a pre-flight wind reading. Later, French meteorologist Leon Teisserenc de Bort (1855-1913) pioneered the use of weather balloons, handily proving their utility. With balloon-acquired data, he determined the existence of a lower level of the atmosphere, which he termed the troposphere or \"sphere of change,\" where weather takes place. Since the 1930s, when radio tracking systems were invented, balloons have been used as complete floating weather stations, using such instruments as thermometers, barometers, hygrometers, cameras, and telescopes.\nMany agencies use weather balloon flights to model the atmosphere and to make more accurate weather predictions. They collect such atmospheric information as temperature , pressure, and humidity that can then be plotted on weather maps. Three-dimensional atmospheric modeling is also possible using weather balloons because the instruments they carry are able to provide data collected from several different altitude points. Since they started, the long bags of helium have been carrying aloft increasingly sophisticated observation devices.

They were part of the \"Schutzstaffel\" (SS). They helped make The Holocaust happen by murdering about 12 million people throughout Europe. Almost all of the people they killed were civilians.\nSometimes, the \"Einsatzgruppen\" would kill only a few people at once. Other times, they would kill thousands of people in a few days. For example, at Babi Yar, the \"Einsatzgruppen\" killed 33,771 Jewish people in two days.\nMost of the people the \"Einsatzgruppen\" killed were Jews. They killed between 5 and 6 million Jews.p.\u00a0257 However, they also killed hundreds of thousands of Polish people, Soviets, and Roma people in Eastern Europe.\nAfter Nazi Germany lost World War II, 24 leaders of the \"Einsatzgruppen\" were put on trial for war crimes and crimes against humanity at the Nuremberg Trials. Sixteen were convicted. Fourteen were sentenced to death, and two were sentenced to life in prison. Other countries later tried four other \"Einsatzgruppen\" leaders, convicted them, and sentenced them to death.pp=274\u2013275\nCreation and Action T4.\nSS leader Reinhard Heydrich created the \"Einsatzgruppen\" around 1938.\nAt first, in October 1938, Heydrich sent the \"Einsatzgruppen\" to the Sudetenland. Adolf Hitler, the leader of Nazi Germany, wanted to take over the Sudetenland. He was ready to use the Nazi military to invade the area. However, in the Munich Agreement, world powers agreed that Hitler could have the Sudetenland. The \"Einsatzgruppen\" helped take over government buildings, and took all the government papers they could find. They also arrested about 10,000 Czech communists and German citizens.pp.\u00a0405, 412\nFrom September to December 1939, the \"Einsatzgruppen\" took part in the Nazis' Action T4 program. The Nazis believed that people with physical, intellectual, and mental disabilities did not deserve to live. Action T4 was a plan to kill them all. At first, the \"Einsatzgruppen\" and other Nazis shot these people. However, by spring of 1940, the Nazis started using gas chambers so they could kill people with disabilities more quickly.pp.\u00a0138\u2013141\nInvasion of Poland.\nIn 1939, Hitler decided to invade Poland. Heydrich decided the \"Einsatzgruppen\" would follow the regular German Army.p.\u00a0425 Their job would be to kill the most important people in Polish society, like clergy, teachers, and members of the academia. They would also kill anyone who refused to agree with Nazi ideas or rules.p.\u00a0144 Adolf Hitler said: \"...there must be no Polish leaders; where Polish leaders exist they must be killed[.]\"p.\u00a0143 The Einzatsgruppen followed this plan by killing about 65,000 civilians by the end of 1939. These people included Polish leaders, Jews, prostitutes, Roma people, and people with mental illnesses.pp.\u00a0430\u2013432\nFinally, the \"Einsatzgruppen\" forced the surviving Jews in Poland to move to ghettos in big Polish citiies. The Nazis planned to get rid of all the Jews in Poland, but they had not yet decided where to send them.pp.\u00a0227\u2013228, 242-245 With the help of the German Army, the \"Einsatzgruppen\" also forced tens of thousands of Jews eastward into the part of Poland that the Soviet Union had taken over.p.\u00a0429\nOperation Barbarossa.\nIn 1941, Hitler decided to invade the Soviet Union. He called this plan Operation Barbarossa. Hitler hated communism. He wanted to take over the communist Soviet Union, and kill communism for good.pp.\u00a095\u201396\nIn May 1941, Heydrich gave the \"Einsatzgruppen\" an order to kill the Jews in the Soviet Union.pp.\u00a094\u201395\nIn June 1941, Heinrich Himmler, the leader of the SS, told other SS leaders that the Nazis planned to kill up to 30 million people in the Soviet Union. The \"Einsatzgruppen\" would play an important part in this by murdering people who the Nazis thought were inferior. However, the Nazis would also use other strategies, like starvation, to kill other Soviets.p.\u00a0181\nThe \"Einsatzgruppen\" were divided into seven battalions.p.\u00a0225 Hitler's army invaded the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941. A few weeks later, the \"Einsatzgruppen\" started working in eastern Poland, which was controlled by the Soviet Union.p.\u00a0185 Heydrich gave them three main jobs:p.\u00a0177\nThe \"Einsatzgruppen\" did these jobs in many ways. Sometimes, they would make lists of people who they thought were enemies, and would then murder them. Other times, they would perform massacres of thousands of people over a few days. For example, at Babi Yar, one \"Einsatzgruppen\" battalion killed 33,771 Jews in two days; in the Rumbula massacre, another killed about 25,000 people in two days.\nMore \"Einsatzgruppen\" are created.\nAs the Nazis took over more and more countries, they created more \"Einsatzgruppen\". They also created smaller groups called \"Einsatzkommando\" and \"Sonderkommando\". These included:\nKillings in the Soviet Union.\nOrders to kill.\nAfter the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union, the \"Einsatzgruppen\"s main job was still to kill civilians, like they did in Poland. However, this time, Heydrich ordered the \"Einsatzgruppen\" to kill:\nBetween July 8 and July 17, Heydrich also ordered the \"Einsatzgruppen\" to kill:\nKillings.\nThe Red Army retreated. However, Heydrich thought there were Soviet guerrilla fighters still in the area and thought local Jews were helping them. He ordered the \"Einsatzgruppen\" to encourage anti-Jewish pogroms in the newly occupied territories. Pogroms (some of which the \"Einsatzgruppen\" started) broke out in Latvia, Lithuania, and Ukraine.p.\u00a0526 Within the first few weeks of Operation Barbarossa, 10,000 Jews were killed in 40 different pogroms. By the end of 1941, about 60 pogroms had happened, killing up to 24,000 people.p.\u00a0526\nAll of the main \"Einsatzgruppen\" took part in mass shootings from the beginning of the war.pp.\u00a0196\u2013202 At first, they shot only adult Jewish men. However, by August, they were shooting all Jews, including women, children, infants, and the elderly. At first, they killed people in firing squads. When this became too slow, the \"Einsatzkommandos\" began to shoot larger groups next to, or even inside, mass graves.p.\u00a0207 As news about these killings spread, many Jewish people ran away.\nThe Nazis began to send people to concentration camps and ghettos. Rural areas were mostly \"Judenfrei\" (free of Jews).pp.\u00a0211\u2013212 The Nazis created forced labour gangs so they could make use of the Jews as slaves until the Nazis had killed them all. The Nazis had put off that goal until 1942.pp.\u00a0212\u2013213\nKillings in the Baltic States.\n\"Einsatzgruppe A\" worked in the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. These countries had been occupied by the Soviet Union before the Nazis took them over. \"Einsatzgruppe A\" killed about 140,000 people between June and November 1941.p.\u00a098\nWhen \"Einsatzgruppe A\" entered Kaunas, Lithuania, a pogrom was happening. They let all of the criminals out of jail and encouraged them to join the pogrom. In four days, 4,000 Jews were killed in the pogrom.p.\u00a041\nThe head of \"Einsatzgruppe A\" let a violent anti-Semitic man named Viktors Ar\u0101js start a smaller \"Einsatzgruppe\" called the Ar\u0101js Kommando. Together, the two groups killed 2,300 Jews in Riga, Lithuania. Within six months, the Ar\u0101js Kommando killed about half of the Jews in Latvia.\nGroups like the Ar\u0101js Kommando were created in Lithuania and Estonia too. With their help, \"Einsatzgruppe A\" was able to kill almost every Jew in its area.p.\u00a0182\nRumbula massacre.\nIn November 1941, Himmler decided that Latvians were not being killed fast enough. He wanted to move Jews from Germany into Latvia. He ordered that everyone living in the ghetto in Riga, Latvia, be murdered.pp.\u00a0206\u2013209\nThe Nazis told the people in the ghetto they were being sent to another place to live. They told them to bring their things and valuables.pp.\u00a0208\u2013210\nThe Nazis moved people towards a nearby forest a thousand at a time. They shot people who tried to run away or could not walk fast enough. They took the things the Jews had brought with them, and made them take off their clothes. Then, fifty at a time, they made the victims lie down in a mass grave and shot them.pp.\u00a0208\u2013210\nIn two days, about 25,000 people were murdered by the \"Einsatzgruppen\".pp.\u00a0210\u2013214\nKilling with poison gas.\nAfter a while, Himmler realized that the \"Einsatzgruppen\"s methods were not the best way to kill people as quickly and cheaply as possible.p.\u00a0197 He also found that many \"Einsatzgruppen\" had trouble killing so many people. Some had physical and mental health problems, and others became alcoholics.pp.\u00a052, 124, 168 Himmler made a final decision after watching a mass execution in August 1941. He decided that shooting Jews was too stressful for his men.pp.\u00a0547\u2013548\nHimmler decided that the answer to this problem was to kill Jews (and others) with poison gas.p.\u00a0167 Starting in 1942, all of the main \"Einsatzgruppen\" began killing people using gas vans, which had been used to kill people with disabilities early on in Action T4. In these vans, carbon monoxide exhaust fumes from the vans' engines were pumped into the back of the truck, killing the victims inside. However, by September 1941, Nazis at Auschwitz concentration camp had begun experimenting with Zyklon B, a cyanide-like pesticide.pp.\u00a0280\u2013281\nAt the Wannsee Conference on January 20, 1942, the Nazis officially decided to kill all of the Jews in Europe (11 million people). Some would be worked to death. Others would be killed in extermination camps (death camps).().p.\u00a0555-556 The Nazis created death camps like Auschwitz-Birkenau and Be\u0142\u017cec extermination camps with the goal of killing as many people as possible, as quickly as possible. These death camps replaced the \"Einsatzgruppen\" as the Nazis' main strategy of mass murder and genocide.pp.\u00a0279\u2013280\nAt first, the \"Einsatzgruppen\" were sent to fight partisans people in Nazi-occupied territories who continued to fight back against the Nazis.p.\u00a0248 However, by 1944, most \"Einsatzgruppen\" had become part of Waffen-SS fighting units or sent to guard death camps.\nJ\u00e4ger Report.\nThe \"Einsatzgruppen\" kept careful records of their mass murders so they could write reports to their supervisors. The Commander of \"Einsatzgruppe A\" filed the J\u00e4ger Report on December 1, 1941. it talks about \"Einsatzgruppen A\"s actions in Lithuania.\nThe report says that \"Einsatzgruppen A\" killed 137,346 people.p.\u00a0215 Most were Jews, but others were communists, criminals, and other Nazi \"enemies.\"p.\u00a0126 Starting in mid-August, when 3,207 people were murdered, the victims included children.p.\u00a0126\nIn February 1942, J\u00e4ger changed his estimates of how many people the \"Einsatzgruppen\" killed. He said there were 138,272 victims, including:p.\u00a0126\nJ\u00e4ger also said that only 1,851 of the victims (1.3%) were not Jewish.p.\u00a0126\nOther reports.\nMany other papers and reports written by the \"Einsatzgruppen\" talk about how many people the different units killed. For example, one researcher looked at over 200 Operational Situation Reports (reports from the \"Einsatzgruppen\" to their bosses about what they were doing). He also looked at letters and reports written by \"Einsatzgruppen\" bosses. He found that as of 1942, \"Einsatzgruppen A, B, C\", and \"D\" had killed almost a million people:"}

His widely disseminated 'History of the Indies' helped to establish the Black Legend of Spanish cruelty. \nBiography.\nBartolome de Las Casas was born in Seville, Spain in 1484. He was there when Christopher Columbus went to Seville in 1493 after Columbus' first trip to the Americas. His father, Pedro de las Casas, and his uncle went to the Americas in the second voyage of Columbus that left in November 1493.\nWith his father, he went to the Caribbean island of Hispaniola in 1502 together with Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando, the new governor of the island. In 1506 he went to Rome, Italy, where he became a Catholic priest.\nHe went back to Hispaniola in 1508 and moved to Concepci\u00f3n de la Vega, in the Cibao valley, and got an encomienda (land with the indigenous people living there). Then he went in 1513 to Cuba and the governor Diego Vel\u00e1zquez gave him an \"encomienda\". But soon Las Casas began to understand that the native people (Ta\u00ednos in Cuba and Hispaniola) were treated as slaves in a very bad way, and he began to defend the native people.\nLas Casas became the first official priest in the New World in 1512.\nIn 1515 he went to Hispaniola, and from there to Spain to defend the native people of the Americas. From 1517 to 1523, and with the title \"Protector of the Indians\", he tried to develop a model settlement in northern Venezuela to protect the native people but the experiment failed. From there, he went to Hispaniola, joining the Dominican Order (an order of Catholic priests) in 1523.\nHe stayed in the city of Santo Domingo until 1527 when he was sent to Puerto Plata, on the northern coast, to found a new religious community and where he began to write his \"History of the Indies\".\nHe became Bishop of Chiapas, Mexico, from 1544 to 1547. He wrote a book about the abuse of Indians called \"A short account of the destruction of the Indies\". The book was finished in 1542 but it was not released as a book until 1552.

He became famous for a series of coloured prints of the Seven Wonders of the World.\nMarten van Heemskerck was born in the town of Heemskerck, near Haarlem in Holland. His father was a farmer. Marten was apprenticed to two painters in Haarlem, but was called home by his father to help with the farm work. Marten ran away from home, and in a single day travelled 50 miles to the town of Delft. He found another master to teach him painting, but soon left him as well. He then went to Haarlem where from 1527 to 1529 he worked with a painter called Jan van Scorel.\nOne of the artists who influenced Marten van Heemskerck at this time was Jan Mabuse who had travelled to Italy and had seen the paintings of famous artists from Florence and Venice. Marten began to copy the style of Mabuse's paintings. In 1532 he went to Italy and spent several years going from town to town, looking at the artworks and making drawings of what he saw.\nThe city that was to have the most influence on Marten van Heemskerck was Rome. He was very interested in the ruins left from the time of the Ancient Romans. He made many drawings of the ruined buildings and other things that he saw. His sketchbooks, which are now in a museum in Berlin are very important evidence for showing what Rome was like in the 1500s. One important building that he drew was St. Peter's Basilica which had been begun, but never completed.\nThe most famous artist who was alive at this time was Michelangelo. He was mainly a sculptor but he had spent five years painting the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Like everybody else, Marten van Heemskerck thought it was amazing. He was so influenced by the figures that Michelangelo had painted that he designed a series of pictures called \"Twelve Panels showing Strong Men from Mythology and Biblical History\". Like the series of the \"Seven Wonders of the Ancient World\" they are well known as prints made from \"engravings\" (they are printed from a metal plate with the design cut into it).\nWhen van Heemskerck was in Rome in 1536, he got work as a \"scene-painter\". This is like a person who paints the scenery in a theatre. Charles V had coming to Rome and was going to have a \"triumphal procession\". The streets of the city were decorated with archways for the emperor to pass under. Van Heemskerck worked with Antonio da San Gallo, Battista Franco and Francesco Salviati. The writer Giorgio Vasari saw some battle scenes that he painted and wrote that they were well composed and boldly painted.\nHe returned to the Netherlands and lived at Haarlem where he settled down and married twice. After that, he only left Haarlem for a short time, in 1572, to go to Amsterdam because the Spanish had invaded Haarlem. In 1540 became president of his Guild of Painters. He became a rich and well-known painter. When he died, he left some money in his will to be paid to a bridal couple who would get married on his tomb. This custom was believed to bring peace to the dead person. He also left some land to help an orphanage in the city.\nMany works by Marten van Heemskerck can still be seen. They include \"Adam and Eve\", \"St. Luke painting the Madonna and Child\" and a painting of Jesus in the museum in Ghent, Belgium. These pictures were done before he went to Italy. In the 1550s he painted several altarpieces which can be seen in the museums of Delft, Haarlem and Brussels, as well as lives of St. Bernard and St. Benedict."}

These reactions take place within a reactor. The plant also has machines which remove heat from the reactor to operate a steam turbine and generator to make electricity. Electricity made by nuclear power plants is called nuclear power. \nNuclear power plants are usually near water to remove the heat the reactor makes. Some nuclear power plants use cooling towers to do this. Nuclear power plants use uranium as fuel. When the reactor is on, uranium atoms inside the reactor split into two smaller atoms. When uranium atoms split, they give off a large amount of heat. This splitting of atoms is called fission. \nThe most popular atoms to fission are uranium and plutonium. Those atoms are slightly radioactive. The atoms produced when fuel atoms break apart are strongly radioactive. Today, fission only happens in nuclear reactors. In nuclear reactors, fission only happens when the reactors parts are arranged properly. Nuclear power plants turn their reactors off when replacing old nuclear fuel with new fuel. \nThere are about four hundred nuclear power plants in the world, with many in the United States, France, and Japan. Some famous accidents at nuclear power plants were the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan, 1986 Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine, and the 1979 Three Mile Island accident in the United States. An Anti-nuclear movement in Australia opposes the making of any nuclear power plants in the country."}

It crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center. The American Airlines airplane was a Boeing 767. It was scheduled to fly from Logan International Airport in Boston to Los Angeles International Airport. Fifteen minutes after takeoff, the hijackers forced their way into the cockpit. One of the hijackers was a trained pilot. He took the controls of the aircraft and flew it into the North Tower. The hijackers were members of the terrorist group Al-Qaeda.\nAll 92 people on the airplane died in the crash\u201411 crew members and 81 passengers; 5 of them were hijackers. The time of the crash was 08:46 Eastern Daylight Time. Many people in the street saw the crash. A few people were able to capture the moment of impact; Jules Naudet, a French cameraman who was filming a movie, and Pavel Hlava, a Czech immigrant. Additionally, a webcam set up by Wolfgang Staehle at an art exhibit in Brooklyn that took pictures of Lower Manhattan every four seconds, and a newscamera that was left on the ground also captured the crash. The crash and the fire that started right after it made the North Tower collapse within 102 minutes. The attack killed nearly 3,000 people and injured thousands of people. It left a profound mark on American history and changed airport security.\nFlight.\nThe aircraft flying American Airlines Flight 11 was a Boeing 767-200ER. Even though it could carry a maximum of 158 passengers, the September 11 flight carried only 81 passengers and 11 crew members. Flying the aircraft was pilot John Ogonowski and first officer Thomas McGuinness. The flight attendants were Barbara Arestegui, Jeffrey Collman, Sara Low, Karen Martin, Kathleen Nicosia, Betty Ong, Jean Roger, Dianne Snyder and Madeline Sweeney.\nBoarding.\nMohamed Atta, a member of terrorist group al-Qaeda and leader of the attacks, and another hijacker, Abdulaziz al-Omari, flew together from Portland, Maine to Boston early on September 11, 2001. Both hijackers had first class tickets for a flight to Los Angeles, California. Three other hijackers, Waleed al-Shehri, Wail al-Shehri and Satam al-Suqami arrived at Logan International Airport by car. All five checked in and by 07:40, were aboard the aircraft which was supposed to leave at 07:45.\nMohamed Atta sat in business class with Abdulaziz al-Omari and Suqami. Waleed al-Shehri and Wail al-Shehri sat in first class. The aircraft taxied away from Gate\u00a0B32 and departed Logan International Airport at 07:59 from runway\u00a04R after a 14-minute delay.\nHijacking.\nIt is thought that the hijacking of the plane started at 08:14. This was when the pilot and first officer stopped talking with air traffic control at Boston. Two minutes later, the aircraft stopped flying along the route it was supposed to. No more radio replies came from the aircraft and the system in the aircraft used to avoid crashing into other aircraft was also switched off. Flight attendants Ong and Sweeney contacted American Airlines with AT&amp;T airphones during the hijack. They said the hijackers had hurt two of the other attendants and killed an Israeli passenger. During the long four-minute call, Ong told the airline which seats the hijackers were sitting in and said no-one could get into the cockpit.\nAt 08:23:38, Atta tried to talk to the passengers from the cockpit but he pressed the wrong button and sent the message to air traffic control. He said that \"[They] have some planes, just stay quiet and you'll be okay. We are returning to the airport.\" A minute later he said, \"Nobody move. Everything will be okay. If you try to make any moves, you'll endanger yourself and the airplane. Just stay quiet.\" Air traffic control realized the aircraft had been hijacked and they called the Federal Aviation Administration. Soon after, Atta announced \"Nobody move please, we are going back to the airport, don't try to make any stupid moves.\" Five minutes later, Boston air traffic control called North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). NORAD ordered two F-15 fighter aircraft to catch the flight, but it was too late\u2014American Airlines Flight 11 had already made its last turn towards Manhattan and crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center more than six minutes before the fighter aircraft had taken off.\nCrash.\nAt 08:46:40, the hijackers crashed Flight\u00a011 into the northern side of the North Tower (Tower\u00a01) of the World Trade Center. The aircraft, traveling at about [or 404 knots] and carrying about 10,000 U.S. gallons of flammable fuel, hit between the 93rd and 99th\u00a0floors of the North Tower. In all, 92\u00a0people on board were killed.\nBecause of the angle the airplane struck, people could not escape from at or above where the aircraft had crashed. All stairs and elevators from the 92nd\u00a0floor to at least the 99th floor were blocked by fire or debris, trapping 1,344\u00a0people. Hundreds were killed right away by the impact. The rest either were trapped and died from the fire, smoke or the collapse of the tower, and some even died after they jumped or fell out the windows of the burning building. More than one elevator shaft carried the burning fuel downward, exploding on the way down.\nJules Naudet, a French cameraman filmed the crash. A webcam set up at an art exhibition in Brooklyn to take pictures of Lower Manhattan, every four seconds, also filmed Flight\u00a011 crashing into the North Tower.\nNews organizations first reported an explosion at the World Trade Center. CNN interrupted a commercial at 08:49 with the headline that read \"World Trade Center Disaster.\" President George W. Bush was arriving at an elementary school in Sarasota, Florida when he was told about the crash. The president said, \"This is pilot error. It's unbelievable that somebody would do this. The guy must have had a heart attack.\" The first news reports believed that the crash had been an accident until Flight\u00a0175 crashed into the South Tower at 09:03.\nAfter the crash.\nAfter the crash, the North Tower burned and collapsed in on itself. Although the crash caused much damage, the fire caused by jet fuel was blamed for the damage and collapse of the tower. Hundreds of rescue workers also died when the tower collapsed.\nRescue workers at the site started to find remains of bodies from the victims of Flight\u00a011 soon after the attack. Some workers found bodies strapped to airplane seats. Other workers discovered the body of a flight attendant with her hands tied up. That meant that the hijackers may have used handcuffs. Within a year, remains of the 33\u00a0victims that had been on Flight\u00a011 had been identified. They identified two other Flight\u00a011 victims, lead flight attendant Karen Martin and another person, after body remains were discovered near Ground Zero in 2006. In April 2007, examiners using newer DNA technology identified another Flight\u00a011 victim. The remains of two hijackers, who could have been from Flight\u00a011, were also identified and removed from Memorial Park in Manhattan. The remains of the other hijackers have not been identified and are buried with other unidentified remains at Memorial Park.\nIn a video recording found months later in Afghanistan, al-Qaeda's leader, Osama bin Laden, seemed to say he planned the attack. He said he believed part of towers would collapse. The flight recorders, or tapes that record useful flight data, for Flight\u00a011 and Flight\u00a0175 were never found.\nAfter the attacks, the flight number for flights on the same route at the same takeoff time was changed to American Airlines Flight\u00a025, and a Boeing 757 was used instead of a Boeing 767. An American flag was flown on the jet bridge from which Flight\u00a011 departed from Logan Airport."}

The player can run, curl up into a ball and jump, and perform a new move, the Spindash. The spindash is a move where Sonic can curl up, gain energy, and roll at high speeds. At the end of the game, the heroes can be seen flying in the air. The game has variety in its gameplay, with a flying section in a plane level.\nReception.\nBecause of the popularity of its predecessor, \"Sonic the Hedgehog 2\" already had a fanbase waiting for its release. The game received a lot of praise, and it was a bestseller in the UK charts for 2 months. As of 2006, the game had sold over 6 million copies. This makes it the second best-selling game on the Sega Genesis.\n\"Electronic Gaming Monthly\" said it was the best Genesis game of 1992.\nThe most common criticisms were about the two-player mode, a first for the series."}

He was best known for being a member of London hard rock band Led Zeppelin. Bonham is considered one of the greatest rock drummers of all time.\nJohn Bonham's career started in 1967, when he joined the Band of Joy with singer Robert Plant. After having some success, the band broke up. At around the same time, another band called The Yardbirds also broke up. Soon after this, Jimmy Page, the lead guitarist for the Yardbirds, decided to start a new band. This new band, called Led Zeppelin, had Plant on vocals, John Paul Jones on bass and keyboards, Bonham on drums and Page playing guitar.\nBonham died after choking on his own vomit in his sleep after drinking forty shots of vodka, and bassist John Paul Jones found him the next morning.\nLed Zeppelin.\nAfter playing some small gigs throughout England, the band came out with their first album, named \"Led Zeppelin I\". John Bonham's talents can be heard on such songs as \"Good Times, Bad Times\", featuring his single bass drum skip throughout the song. Soon after this, the band left for a tour of America, on Boxing Day (26 December 1969). After a rather successful tour, Zeppelin came out with their second album, naming it \"Led Zeppelin II\". This album included the song \"Moby Dick\", which had a famous drum solo by Bonham. Throughout the solo, Bonham showed off his talents by playing hand drums while continuing to use his right foot.\nBy this time, Led Zeppelin was becoming more well known. With the release of their third album (not surprisingly named \"Led Zeppelin III\"), they became one of the biggest bands in the world. Bonham's featured song on this album, which he wrote, was \"Out On The Tiles\". \nLed Zeppelin later released the albums \"Led Zeppelin IV\" (which was originally unnamed), \"Houses of the Holy\", and \"Physical Graffiti\". During this time, Zeppelin was touring non-stop. In addition to still playing \"Moby Dick\", Bonham also received attention for his work on songs such as \"Four Sticks\", \"The Ocean\", and \"In My Time Of Dying\". \nSoon after \"Physical Graffiti\", the band took time off because Robert Plant was injured in a car crash. In this time off, besides spending time with his family and tinkering with cars, Bonham was working on their next album, \"Presence\".\nDeath.\nOn 24 September 1980, Bonham was picked up by his personal assistant, Rex King. They were going to a rehearsal for the upcoming tour. During the day, Bonham drank many alcoholic beverages. After the rehearsal the band left and went to Page's house. The next day, Benji LeFevre, Led Zeppelin's new tour manager, and John Paul Jones found Bonham dead.\nThe coroner ruled that Bonham had drank forty shots of vodka, and his cause of death was pulmonary edema. Bonham had vomited in his sleep, and suffocated on his own vomit.\nAfter Bonham died, Led Zeppelin decided to quit because they felt that Bonham was too good to be replaced."}

{"id": "97677", "revid": "642202", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=97677", "title": "Ozama River", "text": "The River Ozama is a river in the eastern part of the \"Llano Costero del Caribe\" (in English, \"Caribbean Coastal Plain\"). Its overall length of 148 km makes it the fourth longest river in the Dominican Republic, and its watershed (2,685 km\u00b2) is the fourth largest of the country.\nBecause large parts of the watershed is found in region where rainfalls are frequent, without a dry period, its flow is always very good.\nName.\nOzama is a Ta\u00edno word. Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas always wrote \"Hozama\". When he wrote, the \"H\" represented the letter \"J\" and was pronounced (similar to the English \"H\" in house, home). There are several words in the Dominican Republic with that H: Haina-Jaina, Hait\u00ed-Jait\u00ed.\nWriters of the 16th century wrote Hosama and Osama. But later the H disappeared completely.\nCourse.\nThe sources of the Ozama are in the Loma Siete Cabezas mountain (in English, \"Seven Heads Mountain\"), the highest mountain of the Sierra de Yamas\u00e1 mountain range. It flows east through the Monte Plata province and then slowly bends southeast, forming part of the limits between the Santo Domingo and Monte Plata provinces.\nNear the municipality of San Luis, it is joined by the River Yabacao and then turns to the southwest. In the city of Santo Domingo, the river flows to the south and into the Caribbean Sea.\nThe most important tributaries are Yabacao, Isabela and Savita (or Sabita).\nCities.\nThe \"Greater Santo Domingo\", that includes Santo Domingo and parts of Santo Domingo Este and Santo Domingo Norte, is the most important city on the river banks. The river divides the old city of Santo Domingo in three sections; before 2001, all three sections were part of Santo Domingo but now only the western part is part of the city. The eastern section is the city of Santo Domingo Este and the northern section is part of Santo Domingo Norte.\nEnvironment and usage.\nThe River Ozama flows through a region where rainfalls are frequent and, for that reason, its water is not needed for irrigation. There are too much solid materials in the water and it cannot be used for the houses.\nWater from the Caribbean Sea gets into the river for several kilometres because the riverbed is below sea level. There were mangroves (plants that can live in water with a hight salinity), and there are still some near La Victoria, on the banks of the river near the mouth because of the salinity of its water.\nWater quality in the River Ozama has been severely affected by industrialisation, ships, and the large population that lives around its banks close to the mouth.\nThe river is not deep enough for big ships except close to the mouth. When the country was a Spanish colony, and some years after the Independence, flat boats were used to move around the region.\nIn history.\nThe city of Santo Domingo was founded in the 16th century on the left side of the mouth but soon it was moved to the right side and became the capital city of the Spanish colony.\nSugarcane was grown to produce sugar in lands around the River Ozama and its tributary Isabela. The river was used to take the sugar to the port of Santo Domingo.\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, sugar cane was the most important crop grown close to the River Ozama. Cattle is also important in the region because grasses are abundant.\nFor the second half of the 20th century, Santo Domingo became the most important port of the country; the port was near the mouth of the River Ozama. But now the port is used mainly for tourist ships.\nIn art.\nThe River Ozama has been used in art, mainly in poetry, as a symbol of the country. Many poets wrote poems about the river when they were out of the country because of political reasons; they sang to the river to represent the return to their country. Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn Puello, a Dominican poet of the 19th century, wrote several poems where the name is used to represent the country; two of them are \"Ecos del destierro\" (\"Distant sounds from the exile\") and \"La vuelta al hogar\" (\"Back to home\")."}

The Western dates are in the Julian calendar. The Hijra is celebrated annually on 8\u00a0Rabi'\u00a0I, about 66 days after 1\u00a0Muharram, the first day of the Muslim year. Many writers confuse the first day of the year of the Hijra with the Hijra itself, erroneously stating that the Hijra occurred on 1\u00a0Muharram AH\u00a01 or 16 July 622."}

It first showed in 1993 and ended in 1999.\nStory.\nFran Fine is a bridal consultant at Danny's Parisian Brides for Less. Thinking her boyfriend of three years will propose at any minute, she stays with him. But in the series premier, he dumps her for Heather Biblow. He fires her so Heather Biblow can take her job. Fran is forced to take a job as a door-to-door cosmetics saleswoman for Shades of the Orient cosmetics. When she knocks on the door of the Sheffield residence, the man at the door, who turns out to be the butler, mistakes her for an applicant for the nanny position. After meeting the man of the house, Maxwell Sheffield, he is none to thrilled with her unorthodox manners and lack of experience. Out of desperation, he takes her on as nanny on a trial basis.\nThe girls, Maggie, the oldest, and Gracie the youngest quickly warm up to her, but not Maxwell's son, the middle boy Brighton. He was the hardest to win over, and eventually she becomes an integral part of the Sheffield home, and she becomes best friends with the butler Niles.\nThe series showed many hints of the growing attraction between Miss Fine and Mr Sheffield, even so far as Mr Sheffield saying he loved her...then taking it back. Eventually they do get married after a lot of ups and downs. Near the end of the series, Fran gives birth to twins, a boy and a girl. The Sheffields (Maxwell, Fran, Grace, Jonah, Eve) move to California. Maggie and Brighton take a trip to Europe. The last scene of the show is of Fran finding her Shades of the Orient case from the series premiere, looking at the case and the house with loving memories and walking out the door for the last time.\nImpact.\nReception.\nThe show performed poorly in its first year. When it was almost canceled, Sagansky stepped in. According to Jacobson: \"At all those affiliate meetings, he used to say, 'Stick by \"The Nanny\"!' He knew it was something special.\" The sitcom was the first new show delivered to CBS for the 1993 season. It was the highest-tested pilot at the network in years. The series was also very successful internationally. In Australia, it was one of the highest-rated programs during the mid-to-late 1990s."}

Depending on body type and style of clothes, some musicians prefer no more than a thin sponge, a cloth or sometimes nothing at all under the instrument. It is important that the player can shift his left hand easily and freely to play in the higher positions without being afraid that he will drop the instrument, and without feeling the need to squeeze the instrument between his chin and shoulder as this will make the muscles in his neck very tight.\nThe shoulder rest must not be confused with the chinrest, which is the bit on which the player rests his chin."}

{"id": "97830", "revid": "586", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=97830", "title": "Camera obscura", "text": "A camera obscura (plural \"camerae obscurae\" or \"camera obscuras\", from Latin , \"dark chamber\") is a darkened room with a small hole or lens at one side through which an image is projected onto a wall or table opposite the hole. Camera obscura is Latin for \"dark chamber.\"\nAt its most basic, the camera obscura is a simple box (which may be room-sized) with a small hole in one side, (see pinhole camera for details on how to build one). Light from only one part of a scene will pass through the hole and strike a specific part of the back wall. (The projection can be made on paper on which an artist can copy the image.) As the pinhole is made smaller, the image gets sharper, but the light-sensitivity decreases. With this simple apparatus, the image is always upside-down. By using mirrors, as in the 18th century overhead version, it is also possible to project a \"right-side-up\" image.\nDiscovery and origins.\nThe first mention and discovery of the principles behind the pinhole camera, a precursor to the camera obscura, belong to Mozi (470 BC to 390 BC), a Chinese philosopher and founder of Mohism. Later, Aristotle (384 to 322 BC) understood the optical principle of the pinhole camera. He viewed the crescent shape of a partially eclipsed sun projected on the ground through the holes in a sieve, and the gaps between leaves of a plane tree.\nThe first camera obscura was later built by an Iraqi scientist named Abu Ali Al-Hasan Ibn al-Haytham, born in Basra (965-1039 AD), known in the West as \"Alhacen\" or \"Alhazen\", who carried out practical experiments on optics in his \"Book of Optics\".\nIn his various experiments, Ibn Al-Haitham used the term \u201c\"al-Bayt al-Mu\u1e93lim\"\u201d(), translated in English as dark room. In the experiment he undertook, in order to establish that light travels in time and with speed, he says: \u201cIf \"the hole was covered with a curtain and the curtain was taken off, the light traveling from the hole to the opposite wall will consume time.\u201d\" He reiterated the same experience when he established that light travels in straight lines. The most revealing experiment which indeed introduced the camera obscura was in his studies of the half-moon shape of the sun\u2019s image during eclipses which he observed on the wall opposite a small hole made in the window shutters. In his famous essay \"On the form of the Eclipse\" (\"Maq\u0101lah f\u012b Sura al-Kos\u016bf\") () he commented on his observation \"The \"image of the sun at the time of the eclipse, unless it is total, demonstrates that when its light passes through a narrow, round hole and is cast on a plane opposite to the hole it takes on the form of a moon-sickle\"\u201d.\nIn his experiment of the sun light he extended his observation of the penetration of light through the pinhole to conclude that when the sun light reaches and penetrates the hole it makes a conic shape at the points meeting at the pinhole, forming later another conic shape reverse to the first one on the opposite wall in the dark room. This happens when sun light diverges from point \u201c\ufe8d\u201d until it reaches an aperture \u201c\ufe8f\ufea4\u201d and is projected through it onto a screen at the luminous spot \u201c\ufea9\ufeeb\u201d. Since the distance between the aperture and the screen is insignificant in comparison to the distance between the aperture and the sun, the divergence of sunlight after going through the aperture should be insignificant. In other words, \u201c\ufe8f\ufea4\u201d should be about equal to \u201c\ufea9\ufeeb\u201d. However, it is observed to be much greater \u201c\ufed9\ufec1\u201d when the paths of the rays which form the extremities of \u201c\ufed9\ufec1\u201d are retraced in the reverse direction, it is found that they meet at a point outside the aperture and then diverge again toward the sun as illustrated in figure 1. This was indeed the first accurate description of the Camera Obscura phenomenon. \nIn camera terms, the light converges into the room through the hole transmitting with it the object(s) facing it. The object will appear in full colour but upside down on the projecting screen/wall opposite the hole inside the dark room. The explanation is that light travels in a straight line and when some of the rays reflected from a bright subject pass through the small hole in thin material they do not scatter but cross and reform as an upside down image on a flat white surface held parallel to the hole. Ib Al-Haitham established that the smaller the hole is, the clearer the picture is.\nAlthough both the pinhole camera and camera obscura is credited to Ibn al-Haytham, the camera obscura was first described by Aristotle, who was the first to describe how an image is formed on the eye, using the camera obscura as an analogy. Alhazen states (in the Latin translation), and with respect to the camera obscura, \"Et nos non inventimus ita\", we did not invent this.\nTourist attractions.\nSome camera obscura have been built as tourist attractions, often taking the form of a large chamber within a high building that can be darkened so that a 'live' panorama of the world outside is projected onto a horizontal surface through a rotating lens. Although few now survive, examples can be found at the following locations:\nThere is also a portable example which Willett &amp; Patteson tour around England and the world."}

An extremely small hole in a thin material can create an image when all light rays from a scene go through a single point. In order to produce a reasonably clear image, the aperture has to be about 1/100th the distance to the screen, or less. The shutter of a pinhole camera usually consists of a hand operated flap of some light-proof material to cover and uncover the pinhole. \nA common use of a pinhole camera is to capture the movement of sunlight over a long period of time. This type of photography is called Solargraphy. \nPinhole cameras require much longer exposure times than conventional cameras because of the small aperture; typical exposure times can range from 5\u00a0seconds to hours or days. \nThe image may be projected on a translucent screen for real-time viewing (popular for viewing solar eclipses; see also camera obscura).\nLike other cameras, pinhole cameras make the picture upside-down.\nInvention of pinhole camera.\nVery early in history (as far back as 500 B.C.), Greeks such as Aristotle and Euclid wrote on naturally-occurring rudimentary pinhole cameras, for example light may travel through the slits of wicker baskets and the crossing of leaves The ancient Greeks, however, believed that our eye emitted rays which enabled us to see. What enabled a much better understanding of the pinhole camera was the discovery that light enters the eye rather than leaving it. It was the 10th-century Muslim mathematician, astronomer and physicist Ibn al-Haytham who published this idea."}

She became one of the biggest box-office stars of her time. In 1999, she was ranked as the 12th greatest female star of all time by the American Film Institute in their list AFI's 100 Years... 100 Stars. Colbert once said to an interviewer, \"Audiences always sound like they're glad to see me, and I'm damned glad to see them.\"\nEarly life.\nColbert was born on September 13, 1903, to Georges Cauchoin and his wife, the former Jeanne Loew. Her family emigrated to the United States and settled in New York City. She had one brother, Charles, who used the surname Wendling and went on to become his sister's agent. After her formal education ended, she enrolled in the , where she paid for her dramatic training by working in a dress shop. She made her Broadway debut in 1923 in the stage production of \"The Wild Wescotts\". It was during this event that she adopted the name Claudette Colbert. One of the brightest film stars to grace the screen was born Emilie Claudette Chauchoin on September 13, 1903, in Saint Mand\u00e9, France where her father owned a bakery at 57, rue de la R\u00e9publique (now Avenue G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Gaulle). The family moved to the United States when she was three years old. She began acting in high school and in 1923 appeared on the Broadway stage in a small part. Hooked, she gave up on her plans to be a fashion designer to instead pursue a career in acting. She made her first motion picture appearance in 1927, in ', a silent movie shot on location in Paramount Studios in New York, New York facilities. However, talking movies were taking over and two years later, Colbert appeared in her first talking movie, ', co-starring another newcomer, Edward G. Robinson. Her final appearance before the cameras was in a TV movie, (1987). She did, however, remain on the stage where she had returned in 1956, her first love. After a series of strokes, Claudette divided her time between New York and Barbados. On July 30, 1996, Claudette died in Speightstown,Barbados. She was 92 years old.\nCareer.\nIn 1930 Colbert signed a contract with Paramount Pictures, who were looking for stage actors who could handle dialog in the new \"talkies\" medium. Colbert's elegant, musical voice was one of her best assets. Some of her early hit movies were \"Manslaughter\" (1930) and \"Honor Among Lovers\" (1931), both with Fredric March, \"The Smiling Lieutenant\" (1931), with Maurice Chevalier and Miriam Hopkins, and \"Torch Singer\" (1933), with Ricardo Cortez and David Manners.\nColbert's career got a huge boost when Cecil B. DeMille cast her as the Roman empress Poppaea in his historical epic \"The Sign of the Cross\" (1932), opposite Fredric March and Charles Laughton (as Nero). In one of the most memorable scenes in movie history, Claudette bathes nude in a marble pool filled with asses' milk.\nShe worked again for DeMille and was dazzling as his \"Cleopatra\" (1934), opposite Warren William and Henry Wilcoxon. In 1934 she won an Academy Award for Best Actress for her role opposite Clark Gable in the Frank Capra classic screwball comedy \"It Happened One Night\", a movie she initially described as the \"worst picture in the world\". Her performance, however, proved to Hollywood that she was an expert comedienne. She initially balked at pulling up her skirt to entice a passing car to give her and Gable a ride in one famous scene, complaining that it was unladylike. However, upon seeing the chorus girl who was brought in as her body double, an outraged Colbert told the director, \"Get her out of here. I'll do it. That's not my leg!\" Colbert then starred in the original \"Imitation of Life\" (1934), opposite Warren William and Louise Beavers.\nClaudette spent the rest of the 1930s deftly alternating between romantic comedies and dramas, and found success in both: \"Private Worlds\" (1935), with Charles Boyer; \"She Married Her Boss\" (1935), with Melvyn Douglas; \"The Gilded Lily\" (1935) and \"The Bride Comes Home\" (1935), both with Fred MacMurray; \"Under Two Flags\" (1936), with Ronald Colman; \"Tovarich\" (1937), again with Boyer; \"Bluebeard's Eighth Wife\" (1938), with Gary Cooper; \"Zaza\" (1939), with Herbert Marshall; \"Midnight\" (1939), with Don Ameche; \"It's a Wonderful World\" (1939), with James Stewart; and \"Drums Along the Mohawk\" (1939), with Henry Fonda.\nIn addition to Capra and DeMille, Colbert was working with the top directors in the industry: Dorothy Arzner, Ernst Lubitsch, Preston Sturges, Frank Lloyd, John M. Stahl, Wesley Ruggles, Gregory La Cava, Anatole Litvak, George Cukor, Mitchell Leisen, and John Ford.\nColbert believed that her face was difficult to light and photograph, and was obsessed with not showing her \"bad\" side, the right, to the camera, because of a small bump that resulted from a childhood broken nose.\nFrom 1936 to 1944, she starred in numerous programs of Cecil B. DeMille's \"Lux Radio Theater\", which was one of the most popular dramatic radio shows at the time. In 1952, she returned to work in her native France where she stayed until 1955.\nApart from making two more Hollywood movies, she went back to Broadway in 1958 doing \"The Marriage Go-Round\" with Charles Boyer, earning a 1959 Tony Award nomination for her work. Also for her Chicago theatre work, in 1980 she won the . In 1984 she appeared with Rex Harrison in Frederick Lonsdale's \"Aren't We All\" at the Haymarket Theatre, London, and also the Brooks Atkinson Theatre on Broadway, presented by Douglas Urbanski. Ms. Colbert's last movie was \"Parrish\" in 1961. She acted in numerous Broadway plays for the next twenty years. In 1987, she did a television mini-series titled \"\" and was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Mini-series or a Special. In 1988, she won the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Series, Mini-Series or Motion Picture made for TV. In 1989 she received the Kennedy Center Honors.\nDuring her career, Claudette Colbert played in sixty-five movies. For her contribution to the motion picture industry, she was honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\nPersonal life.\nColbert married twice. Her first husband was Norman Foster, an actor and later a director, whom she married in 1928 and divorced in Mexico in 1935. According to the account of the divorce in the \"New York Times\", published on August 31, 1935, \"Some secrecy surrounded the proceedings, for while Mr. Feldman [Colbert's agent] apparently was at liberty to tell of the divorce being granted, he said he could not tell where in Mexico it was obtained.\" The report further stated that \"The Fosters created something of a sensation when they disclosed that they were trying to remain happily married while living in separate homes. But even this experiment apparently failed.\" Four months after her divorce, on December 24, 1935, Colbert married Dr. Joel J. Pressman, a throat specialist, who died in 1968; her former husband went on to marry the actress Sally Blane, a sister of Loretta Young.\nWhen she retired from motion pictures, Colbert and her husband moved to Palm Springs where she operated a store for a time before moving to Barbados. The idea of moving to Barbados came to her following a visit to No\u00ebl Coward's house in Jamaica. At her home there, called Bellerive, she spent her later years as a hostess to the world's powerful and famous. Ronald Reagan was one of her guests during his presidency, as were , Kirk Douglas, Jack Benny, Rex Harrison, and Slim Keith. She had a small guest house built on the property for the honeymoon of Frank Sinatra and Mia Farrow.\nColbert died at her home in Barbados, following series of small strokes during the last two years of her life at the age of 92, and she was interred there in the Parish of St. Peter Cemetery along with her mother and husband. A requiem mass was held at St. Vincent Ferrer church in New York City later.\nAccording to an article published in August 10, 1996 issue of the \"Cincinnati Post\", the childless Colbert left most of her estate, estimated at $3.5 million and including her Manhattan apartment and her home in Barbados, to a friend, Helen O'Hagan, a retired director of corporate relations at Saks Fifth Avenue, whom Colbert had met in 1961 on the set of \"Parrish\", the actress's last movie. Bellerive was later bought by David Geffen.\nAfter Colbert's death, rumors about the actress's purported lesbian relationships, including supposed affairs with Marlene Dietrich and Greta Garbo, began to circulate in the international media. In response, Colbert's friend Helen O'Hagan told the \"New York Daily News\" that the actress barely knew Dietrich or Garbo and that Colbert was \"a man's lady\". The purported Colbert-Dietrich relationship also was explored in the 2001 book \"Behind the Screen: How Gays and Lesbians Shaped Hollywood, 1910-1969\" by William J. Mann, a movie historian."}

The Doctor travels in his space-time-ship, the TARDIS, (Time And Relative Dimensions In Space) with which she can go anywhere in time and space. Because the TARDIS' \"chameleon circuit\" is broken, it looks like an old British police-call box permanently. The Doctor often takes other people with him, who are usually called \"companions\" or \"assistants\". They are always 21st century humans in the modern series, however the classic series often had human-looking aliens or people from the past or future. The most recent companions are Yaz and Dan.\nBiography.\nThe Doctor did not want to stay on Gallifrey any longer, so he \"borrowed\" an old Type 40 TARDIS. In the TARDIS he and his granddaughter Susan Foreman left their home planet Gallifrey. They stayed for a time on Earth in the 1960s, where Susan also went to school.

{"id": "97951", "revid": "7847270", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=97951", "title": "WWE Raw", "text": "WWE Raw is the Monday night professional wrestling television program, made by WWE in 1993. \"WWE Raw\" is usually seen as WWE's flagship program over its sister programs, \"WWE SmackDown\", \"WWE NXT\" and WWE Main Event, due to its longer history and the way it is promoted.\nHistory.\nOriginal format.\nStarting as \"WWF Monday Night Raw\", the program first started on January 11, 1993 on the USA Network for one hour. The original \"Raw\" broke new ground in televised professional wrestling. Traditionally, wrestling shows were taped on sound stages with small viewers or at big arena shows. The \"Raw\" formula was very different than that of its predecessor, \"Prime Time Wrestling\". Instead of taped matches, with studio voice overs and taped chat, \"Raw\" was a show shot to a live viewers, with angles as they happened. The first episode had Yokozuna winning against Koko B. Ware, The Steiner Brothers winning against The Executioners, WWF Intercontinental Champion Shawn Michaels winning against Max Moon and The Undertaker winning against Damien Demento. The show also featured an interview with Razor Ramon.\n\"Raw\" came from the Grand Ballroom at Manhattan Center Studios, a small New York City theater and played live each week. The combination of an intimate venue and live action proved highly successful. However, the weekly live schedule proved to be a financial drain on the WWF, and taped shows began airing every other week. From early 1994 to September 1999, \"Raw\" was shown live on one Monday and then the next day (Tuesday) next Monday's \"Raw\" was taped. This meant that \"Raw\" was live one week and taped the next.\nThe storylines and characters during the early years of \"Raw\" still had a healthy dose of the old Federation \"gimmick-heavy\" style. For example, there were moments such as Irwin R. Schyster tearing up Tatanka's headdress, the different \"Undertaker sightings\" (during the Undertaker vs. Undertaker storyline, leading up to SummerSlam 1994); and characters like Duke \"The Dumpster\" Droese, Doink the Clown, or Thurman \"Sparky\" Plugg.\n\"Raw\" was also one of a kind, in which they covered the unexpected, exciting moments, a prelude to the \"Attitude Era\", in which it coined \"Raw\" as \"Uncut, Uncensored, Uncooked.\" Some of those moments are Razor Ramon losing a match unexpectedly to Sean \"The 1-2-3 Kid\" Waltman, who was later known as X-Pac, Marty Jannetty beating Shawn Michaels to win the WWF Intercontinental Championship, and \"Raw\" was the first WWF television program of any kind to show footage of Lex Luger bodyslamming Yokozuna at the \"USS Intrepid\".\nThe first hosts of \"Raw\" were Vince McMahon, Rob Bartlett and \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage. Sean Mooney conducted the interviews and Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan also helped contribute. In March 1993, Rob Bartlett was dropped from the broadcasting team and was replaced by Bobby Heenan. Then on December 6, 1993, Gorilla Monsoon kicked Bobby Heenan out of the WWF forever. In reality, this was a storyline between Monsoon and his close friend Heenan, who decided to leave the World Wrestling Federation in order to lighten his travel schedule and because he did not want to take a 50% paycut. After about a year, \"Raw\" moved out of the Manhattan Center and traveled to various regular Federation venues in the United States.\nThe Monday Night Wars.\nIn 1995, World Championship Wrestling (WCW) began showing its new wrestling show, \"Monday Nitro\", live each week on TNT. \"Raw\" and \"Nitro\" went head-to-head for the first time on September 11, 1995. Due to \"Raw\"'s taping schedule on several occasions, WCW Vice President Eric Bischoff, who was also an on-air personality, would often give away the results of WWF's taped \"Raw\" shows on the live WCW show. Some fans also looked at \"Raw\" taping results on the steadily-growing Internet; as a result, this caused the ratings of the taped \"Raw\" episodes to be lower.\n\"WWF Raw\" had a live broadcast every other week to save costs, until September 1999, when ratings and pay-per-view buy rates had grow, allowing them to justify doing a weekly live show.\nAt the start of the ratings war in 1995 through to mid-1996, \"Raw\" and \"Nitro\" exchanged victories over each over in a closely contested rivalry. Beginning in mid-1996, however, thanks primarily to the nWo angle, \"Monday Nitro\" started a ratings win-streak that lasted for eighty-three continuous weeks, ending on April 13, 1998.\nRaw is War.\nOn February 3, 1997, \"Monday Night Raw\" went to a two hour format, as the Attitude Era was starting to come in full stream in the WWF. In an attempt to break the momentum of what had turned into ratings domination by WCW's competing \"Monday Nitro\", Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) was brought in as Jerry Lawler \"challenged\" ECW on February 17, 1997. In an episode where \"Raw\" returned to the Manhattan Center, the \"challenge\" answered on the following week's show with Taz, Mikey Whipwreck, Sabu, Tommy Dreamer, D-Von Dudley, and the Sandman. ECW owner Paul Heyman did a call-in interview on \"Raw\" the week after that.\nDuring 1997, there were more and more controversial elements in \"Raw\" and WWF programming such as the Nation of Domination, and the D-Generation X \"racial graffiti\" storyline designed to \"implicate Bret Hart's 'the Hart Foundation'\", and the \"XXX Files\" series.\nOn March 10, 1997, \"Monday Night Raw\" officially became \"Raw is War\". The March 17, 1997 episode featured a heated Bret Hart/Vince McMahon ringside altercation (that unknowingly foreshadowed events in November) with profanity normally unheard on TV. Brian Pillman did a series of \"XXX Files\" segments with Terri Runnels, which further \"pushed the envelope\". These segments ended prematurely with the September 29, 1997 episode of \"Raw\", after the death of Pillman on October 5, 1997 due to hereditary heart problems.\nAfter WrestleMania XIV in March 1998, the WWF regained the lead in the Monday Night Wars with its new \"WWF Attitude\" brand, led in particular by rising stars Steve Austin, The Rock and Mankind. The classic feud between the villainous WWF Chairman Vince McMahon (who was re-imagined and re-branded from the color commentator into the evil company chairman character Mr. McMahon after the real-life Montreal Screwjob incident) and fan favorite Steve Austin (who had been released by Bischoff in the summer of 1995 for not being marketable) caught the imaginations of fans. The April 13, 1998 episode of \"Raw\", headlined by a match between Austin and McMahon, marked the first time that WCW had lost the head-to-head Monday night ratings battle in the 84 weeks since 1996.\nWhile \"Raw\" was taking a new approach to programming, \"Nitro\" would start making lackluster shows with the same storylines. Older stars such as Hogan and Nash frequented the main events, while younger talent such as Chris Jericho, Chris Benoit and Eddie Guerrero were not given opportunities to advance, and the only newcomer elevated to main-event status at this time was Bill Goldberg.\nMeanwhile, on \"Raw\", fans were immersed in the feud between WWF owner Vince McMahon and \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin. New talent such as Triple H and his D-Generation X faction, Mankind and The Rock were elevated to main event status on the WWF's program. Superstars such as Kane, Val Venis, Goldust, etc. were coming through the ranks and exposing the WWF as the place where new talent comes through unlike the WCW counterpart. Things were so heated between the two programs that, when both shows were in the same area on the same night (\"Raw\" in Hampton, Virginia, \"Nitro\" in Norfolk), D-X was sent to film a \"war\" segment at the Norfolk Scope where they berated WCW and interviewed fans on camera who stated that they received their \"Nitro\" tickets for free (presumably in an attempt by WCW to pack the arena as full as possible due to low ticket sales).\nOn January 4, 1999. Mick Foley, who had wrestled for WCW in the early 1990s as Cactus Jack, won the WWF Title as Mankind on \"Raw\". On orders from Bischoff, \"Nitro\" announcer Tony Schiavone gave away this previously taped result on the live \"Nitro\", and then sarcastically added \"that'll sure put some butts in the seats\"; over 600,000 viewers changed channels to watch \"Raw\". This was also the night that \"Nitro\" aired a WCW World Championship match in which Kevin Nash blatantly laid down for Hulk Hogan after Hogan poked him in the chest. The next week, and for months after, many fans in the \"Raw\" audience brought signs which read, \"Mick Foley put my ass in this seat!\"\nThe end of the Wars.\nA new television contract with Viacom led to a WWF change in the broadcast. On September 25, 2000, \"Raw\" moved from the USA Network to TNN (which later became Spike TV).\nWCW's sharp decrease in revenue and ratings led to Time Warner's sale of the company to the WWF in 2001. The last version of \"Nitro\" was shown on March 26, 2001. The show began with Vince McMahon making a short statement about his recent purchase of WCW and ended with a simulcast on \"Raw\" on TNN with an appearance by Vince's son Shane McMahon on \"Nitro\". Shane interrupted his father's gloating over the WCW purchase to explain that Shane was the one who actually owned WCW, setting up what become the WWF's \"Invasion\" storyline.\nThe \"Raw is War\" logo and name were retired in September 2001, following the September 11, 2001 attacks and sensitivity over the word \"war\". It also symbolized that professional wrestling's \"Monday Night Wars\" were over.\nBrand Extension.\nIn early to mid-2002, WWE had a process they called the \"Brand Extension\". WWE divided itself into two \"de facto\" wrestling promotions with separate rosters, storylines and authority figures. Raw and SmackDown! would host each division, give its name to the division and essentially compete against each other. The split was a result of WWF purchasing their two biggest competitors, WCW and ECW. The brand extension was publicly announced during a telecast of \"WWF Raw\" on March 25, 2002, and became official the next day.\nWrestlers now would become show-exclusive, wrestling for their specific show only. At the time this excluded the WWE Undisputed Championship and WWE Women's Championship, as those WWE titles would be defended on both shows. In August 2002, WWE Undisputed Champion Brock Lesnar did not want to defend the title on \"Raw\", in effect causing his title to become exclusive to \"SmackDown!\" The following week on Raw, General Manager Eric Bischoff awarded a newly instated World Heavyweight Championship to Raw's designated #1 contender, Triple H. Due to the fact that since the WWE Undisputed Championship was now SmackDown! exclusive it was no longer seen as \"undisputed\". Following this, the WWE Women's Championship soon became Raw-exclusive as well. As a result of the Brand Extension, an annual \"draft lottery\" was instituted to exchange members of each roster and generally refresh the lineups.\n\"WWE Raw\" said they have earned the distinction of having the most original episodes of any fictional weekly program on August 2, 2005 when it broadcast the 636th episode. It was said to have took the place of \"Gunsmoke\", which held that distinction. However, under the criteria WWE used to make this claim, the actual record would be held by the show \"Georgia Championship Wrestling\", which ran continuously on Saturday evenings on TBS between 1972 and 1984.\nReturn to USA Network.\nOn March 10, 2005, Viacom and WWE decided not to go on with the agreement with Spike TV, making it so \"Raw\" and other WWE programs on the network would cease when their deal expired in September 2005. On April 4, 2005, WWE announced a 3-year deal with NBC Universal to bring \"Raw\" back to its old home, the USA Network, with 2 yearly specials on NBC and a Spanish \"Raw\" on Telemundo. On the same week as \"Raw\"'s restart on USA, Spike TV scheduled Ultimate Fighting Championship's live \"Ultimate Fight Night\" in \"Raw\"'s old timeslot in a try to go head-to-head with \"Raw\".\nThe show's first night back on USA was billed as the \"WWE Homecoming\" and featured the return of former WWE Champions such as Hulk Hogan, Steve Austin, Mick Foley, Triple H and Vince McMahon along with cameos from legends such as Roddy Piper, Jimmy Hart, Jimmy Snuka and Harley Race. WWE Homecoming was three hours long \u2014 the longest an episode of \"Raw\" has ever run in its 12-year history. USA also showed \"Raw Exposed\", an hour of the best moments of \"Raw\" during its previous run on USA. WWE announced that \"Raw\" got its highest ratings in three years, gaining close to six million viewers.\nThe following week, Vince McMahon fired Jim Ross for not helping after Steve Austin gave him and his entire family the Stone Cold Stunner. Jonathan Coachman, the second analyst at the table, took over Ross's duties as play-by-play for two weeks until former ECW announcer Joey Styles was hired.\n2006.\nOn the May 1, 2006 version of \"Raw\", Joey Styles said he was quitting (kayfabe). His vacating of the announcer position set the stage for Jim Ross to return to Raw's commentary booth, thus ending the storyline where Ross got fired by Linda McMahon. This freed Styles to become a commentator for the ECW brand when it launched in June.\nIn Canada, after an 11-year run on TSN, \"Raw\" moved to rival sports broadcaster The Score after it was announced that TSN would be carrying \"Monday Night Football\"' for the 2006 season. This also meant that Canadian viewers would be watching via tape-delay, as The Score did not broadcast \"Raw\" live at first, but in 2007, started airing the show live.\nDuring the September 25, 2006 episode of \"Raw\" in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, the opening of \"Raw\" suffered a blackout. Spotlights were the only lights running in the house. Power in the presentation was later back. Another similar moment happened back on May 26, 1996 in Florence, South Carolina for WWF , when a major thunderstorm hit the Florence Civic Center causing major chaos for the PPV. That Tuesday, returned to North Charleston, South Carolina to finish out three matches that were not shown because of the lost power feed.\nOn October 9, 2006, \"Raw\" held a three hour season start called the \"Raw Family Reunion\", where the Raw brand had a new logo and theme song, Papa Roach's \"...To Be Loved\". The episode also featured talent from the SmackDown! and ECW brands. Later that month, on October 23 \"Raw\" aired its 700th episode, making it the longest running weekly entertainment show, without a hiatus, in television history.\n2007.\nOn June 25, 2007, \"Raw\" was scheduled in Corpus Christi, Texas to be a three-hour special memorial show for the (kayfabe) death of the Mr. McMahon character after he had been presumed dead in a limo explosion. The event was canceled due to the real death of Chris Benoit and his family earlier that day, with a three-hour Chris Benoit memorial show being shown instead. This was the first time that \"Raw\" had been shown with no viewers and had Vince McMahon breaking kayfabe to address the viewers at home. The show had extracts from the DVD , showing some of Benoit's most memorable matches, along with comments from some of Benoit's colleagues. However, when the facts of Benoit's death came to light, WWE pulled this episode from international markets which aired \"Raw\" on a tape delay basis. Several channels announced the episode was being withheld for legal reasons. A substitute \"Raw\", hosted by Todd Grisham from WWE Studios, was created featuring recaps of big-time championship changes of the past year. The episode started with a message from Vince McMahon which originally aired on the edition of June 26 of \"ECW\".\nJohn Cena's 380 day championship reign was ended due to injury by Randy Orton on the October 1 episode of Raw. Orton won the title that Sunday at No Mercy.\nOn December 10, 2007 \"Raw\" celebrated its 15th anniversary in a three-hour spectacular on the USA Network with the returns of Stone Cold Steve Austin, Rob Van Dam, The Godfather, Steve Blackman, Howard Finkel, Ted DiBiase, Eric Bischoff, Marty Jannetty, Gangrel, Trish Stratus, Lita, Sunny, Hulk Hogan and Mick Foley (as Mankind) among others. Along with several reunions of former tag teams and also included a 15-man \"15 Years of Raw\" battle royal. The RAW XV: 15th Anniversary DVD was also sold that had the best moments in Raw history.\n2008.\nIn April 2008 as part of the United States presidential election, candidates Barack Obama, John McCain and Hillary Rodham Clinton presented special messages on W.W.E. Raw. The show was watched by an estimated 4.97 million viewers, of which there were 1.45 million viewers who were men aged 18 to 34: an important group of voters the candidates were trying to talk to.\n2009.\nIn 2009, at No Way Out that February 15, Edge won the World Heavyweight Championship in Raw's Elimination Chamber match, thus making it a SmackDown exclusive title and giving SmackDown two top tier championships. As a result of the 2009 WWE Draft in April, WWE Champion Triple H was drafted to the Raw brand, while the World Heavyweight Championship moved to the Raw brand after Edge lost the title to John Cena at WrestleMania XXV. SmackDown would regain the World Heavyweight Championship at Backlash (2009) when Edge defeated John Cena to win the championship. In addition, SmackDown and Raw would exchange both women-exclusive championships with Raw gaining the WWE Divas Championship and SmackDown gaining the WWE Women's Championship. Also, SmackDown and Raw exchanged the WWE Intercontinental Championship which is now exclusive to SmackDown and the WWE United States Championship which is exclusive to Raw Brand, for the first time ever.\nOn June 15, 2009, McMahon announced on a special three-hour edition of Raw that he had \"sold\" the WWE Raw franchise to Donald Trump, who appeared on-screen to confirm it and declared he would be at the following commercial-free episode in person. WWE issued a press release on the scripted sale while the USA Network later issued a statement confirming the \"sale\" as part of a storyline. The statement was issued in response to multiple news sources having mistakenly reported the event as legitimate. Due to the mistake, on the day following the announcement, WWE's stock on the New York Stock Exchange notably fell. Despite USA Network's acknowledgment that the sale was fictional, Randy Katz, a securities lawyer with Baker &amp; Hostetler, commented on the Fox Business Network that a probe by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission against WWE and USA Network owner General Electric \"certainly is a possibility. The next week, Vince McMahon repurchased Raw from Donald Trump and announced that a \"Guest host\" initiative originally introduced by Trump in response to the position of General Manager being vacant would go in effect on June 29. Each weekly guest host is usually either a WWE Hall of Famer, a former or returning talent, or other celebrity. The guest host or hostess assumes the role of a brand General Manager, serving as Raw's authority figure for the day. The following year, it was announced that with Vickie Guerrero (and subsequently Bret Hart) becoming the new full-time GM, the guest hosts (while continuing to appear) would no longer have booking power.\n2010.\nIn 2010, TNA IMPACT!, which normally airs on Thursdays, would go head to head with Raw in a three-hour live broadcast. This would be the first time since March 2001 that two major wrestling promotions would go head-to-head in a Monday night ratings competition. TNA promoted the debut of Hulk Hogan leading to the broadcast. WWE countered by announcing the return of Bret Hart, who had not appeared with the company since the Montreal Screwjob in 1997. The ratings showed that, much like the first Monday Night War, Raw came out on top, averaging 5.6 million viewers while iMPACT! averaged 2.2 million viewers.[25]\nOn March 8, 2010, Impact! permanently moved to Monday nights to compete head-to-head with Raw. After declining ratings, Spike executives announced that starting April 5, Impact! would air an hour earlier than Raw. After scoring its lowest ever rating at 0.5, it was announced May 3 that Impact! would be moving back to its original time on Thursdays starting May 13.[28] Since then on April 19, 2010, many of the WWE Raw superstars were stranded in Belfast due to the ash cloud from Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull (a volcano in Iceland) hovering over most of Europe and causing many flights to be put on hold. Former ring announcer Lilian Garcia announced that night while the SmackDown roster took part in production of the Raw episode. The following month on May 17, 2010, Raw aired its second overall commercial free episode from the Air Canada Centre in Toronto, Ontario.\nThat summer on August 30, 2010, Raw aired its 900th episode, SmackDown superstars and NXT rookies also appeared on this milestone episode. It featured The Undertaker vs Bret Hart for the first time in almost 14 years. That November, Raw went \"Old School\" for one night with the old ring and titantron designs. This episode featured WWE Legends Hacksaw Jim Duggan, Mae Young, Million Dollar Man, Ron Simmons, The Iron Sheik and many more. Mark Henry briefly returned to his \"Sexual Chocolate\" gimmick in honor of Raw going \"Old School\".\nOn February 14, 2011, The Rock returned to WWE as he was announced as the host for WrestleMania 27. On the April 6 episode of Raw following WrestleMania 27, Rock and Cena agreed to a match at WrestleMania 28. On June 27, CM Punk was suspended after he cut a shoot promo on Raw mocking Vince McMahon, Hulk Hogan, The Rock and taking stabs at WWE management. At Money in the Bank, CM Punk left WWE with the WWE Championship and Raw held a tournament for a new champion won by John Cena. CM Punk returned. Triple H became COO of WWE and began operating day-to-day operations. At SummerSlam the titles were unified. On the August 29 episode of Raw, Triple H announced that talent from SmackDown could appear on Raw and Raw talent could appear on SmackDown, thus ending the Brand Extension. The Miz and R-Truth were fired and chaos happened at Hell in a Cell and on Raw, resulting in Triple H no longer being able to operate Raw due to the vast majority of the roster walking out. John Laurainitis became GM. CM Punk won the WWE Championship at Survivor Series beginning an epic reign.\nOn January 2, 2012 Chris Jericho returned to WWE and promised to win the Royal Rumble which he did not. Brock Lesnar and Lord Tensai returned to Raw on the April 2 episode. On July 23, Raw celebrated its 1000th episode. Starting on September 17, Raw along with the rest of WWE programming had a pink rope in the middle of the ring to promote breast cancer until October 29. On the November 19 episode of Raw, CM Punk celebrated 365 days as WWE Champion.\nOn the January 7, 2013 episode of Raw, The Rock came back again. On January 14, Raw celebrated 20 years. CM Punk's championship reign was ended at Royal Rumble at 434 days. On the March 4 episode of Raw they went \"Old School\" for the second time. The following episode of Raw was a tribute to the late Paul Bearer, The Undertaker and Kane led the tribute but were twice interrupted by Undertaker's WrestleMania 29 opponent, CM Punk.\nProduction.\nAs of 2008, \"Raw\" is shown live on Monday evenings on the USA Network (in the USA), The Score in Canada and on Sky Sports 3 in Great Britain, though it is sometimes taped and placed on a broadcast delay depending on what circumstances dictate. The theme song for the Raw brand is \"Burn It to the Ground\" by Nickelback since November 16, 2009. Before that the theme song was \"...To Be Loved\" by Papa Roach, which used from October 9, 2006 to November 9, 2009.\nSince March 10, 1997, broadcasts of \"Raw\" were split into two hours and given hourly names for television ratings purposes, with the first hour being referred to as \"Raw is War\" and the second as \"War Zone\" by the show's on-screen graphics. However, as of October 1, 2001, the first hour has been referred to as \"Raw\" and the second as \"Raw Zone\" by the show's on-screen graphics.\nOn January 7, 2008, WWE said that all 3 brands (RAW, SmackDown!, and ECW) would be broadcast in HD, codenamed \"WWE HD\" starting with RAW on January 21. WWE invested about $20 million on new recording and broadcasting equipment to prepare for the move, as well as new pyrotechnics and lighting. The move replaced the RAW, SmackDown!, and ECW sets with a new state of the art set shared by all brands.\nBroadcasting notes.\nThe show currently starts live on USA Network (and on tape delay Wednesdays on mun2, and Sundays on Telemundo (in Spanish)) in the United States, and in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland on Sky Sports 3.

{"id": "97969", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=97969", "title": "Ludwig Wittgenstein", "text": "Ludwig Josef Johann Wittgenstein ( in German) (April 26, 1889 \u2013 April 29, 1951) was an Austrian philosopher. He worked mainly in the basics of logic, the philosophy of mathematics, the philosophy of mind, and the philosophy of language. He is regarded as one of the most important philosophers of the twentieth century.\nBefore his death at the age of 62, the only book Wittgenstein had published was the \"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\". His second book \"Philosophical Investigations\" was published shortly after he died. Both of these works are regarded as very important for analytic philosophy.\nLife.\nLudwig Wittgenstein was born in Vienna on 26 April 1889, to Karl and Leopoldine Wittgenstein. He was the youngest of eight children and was born into one of the most prominent and wealthy families in the Austro-Hungarian empire. His father's parents, Hermann Christian and Fanny Wittgenstein, were born into Jewish families but later converted to Protestantism, and after they moved from Saxony to Vienna in the 1850s, assimilated themselves into the Viennese Protestant professional classes. Ludwig's father, Karl Wittgenstein, became an industrialist and went on to make a fortune in iron and steel. Ludwig's mother Leopoldine, born Kalmus, was an aunt of the Nobel Prize laureate Friedrich von Hayek. Despite Karl's Protestantism, and the fact that Leopoldine's father was Jewish, the Wittgenstein children were baptized as Roman Catholics \u2014 the faith of their maternal grandmother \u2014 and Ludwig was given a Roman Catholic burial upon his death. Wittgenstein was homosexual.\nWittgenstein began studying mechanical engineering. During his research he became interested in the foundations of mathematics, particularly after reading Bertrand Russell's \"Principles of Mathematics\" and Gottlob Frege's \"Grundgesetze\". In 1911 Wittgenstein visited Frege and Russell and discussed philosophy with them at great length. He made a great impression on Russell and started to work on the foundations of logic and mathematical logic. Russell saw Wittgenstein as a successor who would carry on his work.\nThe \"Tractatus\".\nDuring the First World War, Wittgenstein served in the army and developed his logic. He included ethical aspects. In the summer of 1918 he learned that his friend David Pinsent had been killed in an airplane accident. Wittgenstein became depressed and thought of suicide. He went to stay with his uncle Paul where he was able to complete the \"Tractatus\". No publisher accepted it, but Russell realised it was a philosophically important work and wrote an introduction. Wittgenstein did not like it because he thought that Russell had not understood the book. In the end Wilhelm Ostwald's journal \"Annalen der Naturphilosophie\" printed a German edition in 1921, and Routledge's Kegan Paul printed a bilingual edition with Russell's introduction in 1922.\nThe years after the \"Tractatus\".\nSince Wittgenstein thought that the \"Tractatus\" had solved all the problems of philosophy, he left philosophy and returned to Austria to train as a primary school teacher. Wittgenstein had unrealistic expectations of the rural children he taught, and had little patience with those children who had no gift for mathematics. But he had good results with children that were interested, especially boys. His severe disciplinary methods led to disagreement with some of his students' parents, and eventually he resigned his position and returned to Vienna, feeling that he had failed as a school teacher.\nAfter abandoning his work as a school teacher, Wittgenstein worked as a gardener's assistant in a monastery near Vienna and then he worked with the architect, Paul Engelmann. This intellectual work did much to restore Wittgenstein's spirits.\nBetween 1925 and 1928, he joined his sister Margaret in Vienna, where she was having a house built. Wittgenstein and the architect Paul Engelmann built it together, and though they never lived in it, 'Haus Wittgenstein' is still standing in Vienna today.\nToward the end of this work, Wittgenstein was contacted by Moritz Schlick, one of the leading figures of the newly formed Vienna Circle. This contact stimulated Wittgenstein intellectually and revived his interest in philosophy.\nReturn to Cambridge.\nIn 1929 he decided to return to Cambridge. He was met at the railway station by a crowd of England's greatest intellectuals. He found out to his horror that he was one of the most famous philosophers in the world now.\nIn 1939 Wittgenstein was appointed to the chair in Philosophy at Cambridge.\nDuring World War II he left Cambridge and volunteered as a hospital porter in Guy's Hospital in London and as a laboratory assistant in Newcastle upon Tyne's Royal Victoria Infirmary.\nFinal years.\nWittgenstein resigned his position at Cambridge in 1947 to concentrate on his writing.

He was the first Republican to serve as Vice President of the United States, elected as Abraham Lincoln's Vice President in the 1860 presidential election.\nEarly life.\nHamlin was born in Paris, Maine. He was a descendant of James Hamlin who had lived in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1639. He attended the area's schools, and later managed his father's farm. For the next few years he worked at several jobs. He studied law. He lived in Hampden, where he practiced law until 1848, when he moved away.\nPolitical life.\nHamlin studied law. He was admitted to the legal profession in 1833, and quickly became known as a good lawyer and a good speaker. In politics, he began as an against slavery Democrat.

Busan is one of four cities in South Korea with a subway system; the others are Seoul, Daegu and Incheon. Subway systems are also being built in Gwangju and Daejeon. Planning for the Busan Subway began in 1979 and building started in 1981. The first stage, a line with 17 stations between Nopo-dong and Beomnaegol opened on the 19 July 1985. There are now 102 stations, four lines, and of tracks.\nThe system is operated by Busan Transportation Corporation. It was first launched in 1985 when Line 1 (Nopo-dong(\ub178\ud3ec\ub3d9)~Beomnaegol(\ubc94\ub0b4\uace8)) was opened. Now there are 6 lines with 114 stations, 116.5 kilometers of tracks. Busan Transportation Corporation publishes a name of 'Humetro' as a brand identity.\nLine 1 (Orange Line).\nLine 1 (Nopo-dong(\ub178\ud3ec\ub3d9)~Beomnaegol(\ubc94\ub0b4\uace8)) was first opened in 1985. In 1994, the whole section (Nopo-dong(\ub178\ud3ec\ub3d9)~Sinpyeong(\uc2e0\ud3c9)) was launched. Line 1 is the South-North route. And it passes right through the heart of the city. It was 32.5\u00a0km long with 34 stations in 1994 when the line was later extended to 40.5 km with 40 stations, which the extension was opened on April 20, 2017. The subway used in Line 1 is middle-sized subway. It was made of stainless domestically for the first time when being constructed. It is a 8-cars train. Many cutting edge technologies (including NATM, TBM construction methods) were used to construct line 1. \nLine 2 (Green Line).\nLine 2 (Hopo(\ud638\ud3ec)~Seo-myeon(\uc11c\uba74)) first began operation in 1999, and the entire route (Jangsan(\uc7a5\uc0b0)~Hopo(\ud638\ud3ec)) was completed in 2002. Line 2 was built to solve chronic heavy traffic from east to west of the city. In 2008, the extension route (Hopo(\ud638\ud3ec)~Yangsan(\uc591\uc0b0)) was launched for developing transportation system between Busan and Yangsan city. The whole line 2 is 45.2\u00a0km in length, 43 stations. It is middle-sized subway and a 6-cars train. Shield construction method was used to build line 2. It was the first time to use this method when constructing the subway line in the country. This method was needed to build the line across Suyeong River.\nLine 3 (Brown Line).\nLine 3 (Suyeong(\uc218\uc601)~Daejeo(\ub300\uc800)) started its service in 2005. It is aimed at reducing traffic in Mandeok(\ub9cc\ub355), Minam(\ubbf8\ub0a8) and Yeonsan-dong(\uc5f0\uc0b0\ub3d9). Line 3 also connects relatively isolated Gangseo(\uac15\uc11c) area with the center of the city. It is expected to help to improve the quality of life in Gangseo(\uac15\uc11c) region. Line 3 is 18.1\u00a0km long with 17 stations. It is middle-sized subway and uses a 4-cars train. Line 3 subway is a Korean standard type train. All equipment is localized, and a train itself is 20% lighter than line 1 subway.\nLine 4 (Blue Line).\nLine 4 has been constructed since 2003. It opened on March 30, 2011. It connects from Minam(\ubbf8\ub0a8) to Anpyeong(\uc548\ud3c9) with 12 stations. The line\u2019s length is 12.7\u00a0km. It is expected to promote development of Geumsa(\uae08\uc0ac), Bansong(\ubc18\uc1a1) and Gijang(\uae30\uc7a5) regions. It is light rail which consumes only 80% money in construction and management compared to existing heavy rail.\nBusan-Gimhae Light Rail Transit.\nThis line is operated by Busan-Gimhae Light Rail Transit Corporation which (from Sasang(\uc0ac\uc0c1) to Gaya University) links to the western area of Busan to adjoining city of Gimhae. It has 21 stations and 23.9\u00a0km of track. It was completed and opened on September 9, 2011.\nPassenger.\nThe number of passengers using Busan subway is about 263,574,000 a year (2009.

It is regarded as one of the best and most selective universities in China. It was established in 1911 as a school for Chinese graduates wanting to go further with their studies at universities in other countries, especially the United States and the UK.\nHistory.\nTsing Hua University was opened in Beijing, China in 1911 on the site of a former royal garden belonging to a prince. It was first a \"preparatory school\", a school for preparation, for students to be later sent by the government to study in America. The people who graduated were transferred directly to American schools as juniors upon graduation.\nIn 1925, the school established its College Department and started its research institute on Chinese Study. In 1928, the name officially changed to National Tsing Hua University (NTHU).\nDuring the Second World War in 1937, Tsing Hua University, along with Peking University and Nankai University, merged to form Chang Sha Temporary University in Chang Sha, which later became National Southwestern Associated University in Kunming of Yunnan province. After the war, Tsing Hua moved back to Beijing and resumed its operation.\nThe communist victory at the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949 led to the creation of the People's Republic of China (PRC), so the university's President Mei Yi Qi and some professors went to Taiwan where they established the National Tsing Hua Institute of Nuclear Technology in 1955, which later became National Tsing Hua University.\nIn 1952, the communist government regrouped the country's higher education institutions in an attempt to build a Soviet style system, with individual institutions tending to specialise in a certain field of study. TsingHua University was disassembled, losing its law school, school of agriculture, school of sciences and humanities, and became a polytechnic engineering university. Even so, the University remained in the top tier schools in China (Many Chinese scholars regards that its only rival is Peking University). In many years following this regroup, the school was often referred to as the \"MIT of China\" . But since the 1980s, the university began to incorporate a multidisciplinary system. As a result, a lot of schools were built and rebuilt. These included the School of Science, School of Economics and Management, School of Humanities and Social Sciences, School of Law, School of Public Administration, and the School of Art. Only two colleges charge tuition to its graduate students; the law school and the Academy of Arts and Design.\nDuring the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976, the university became a battlefield between different sects of Mao's Red Guards (China) and a stronghold of the radicals. It did not resume its normal operation until 1977 when the Cultural Revolution was officially put to an end.\nSince 1977, the university has enjoyed rich government funding and policy support which greatly improved its facilities. Since 1978, it has flourished with the re-establishment of the departments in sciences, economics and management, and the humanities. Its graduate school has been recognized nationally, ranking first in the National Evaluation of Graduate Schools. The School of Continuing Education uses modern information technologies, as well as the advanced educational resources at Tsing Hua.\nPresent.\nMost Chinese university rankings place TsingHua first in China. It attracts the most talented students of the nation and enjoys the best engineering and applied sciences programs in China, occupying a position similar to MIT, Stanford, and Princeton in the US. Peking Union Medical College of Tsinghua University is likewise regarded as the best medical school in the country. Tsinghua's longtime rival Peking University is better known for natural sciences, social sciences, law, and liberal arts, somewhat similar to the Ivy League schools of Yale, Harvard, and the University of Pennsylvania.\nAdmission to Tsinghua is highly competitive. The majority of selected students are national scholars and among the brightest high school graduates in the country. Many of China's top scientists, engineers, politicians and business leaders are among Tsinghua alumni. The former Chinese leader (2002-2012), Hu Jintao, is a former Tsinghua student who graduated with a degree in hydraulic engineering in 1964. The current General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (since 2012), Xi Jinping, is a former Tsinghua student who graduated with a degree in chemical engineering in 1979.\nAs of 2003, Tsinghua University had 12 colleges and 48 departments, 41 research institutes, 35 research centers, and 167 laboratories, including 15 national key laboratories. In September 2006, Peking Union Medical College was renamed to Peking Union Medical College, Tsinghua University . The university offers 51 bachelor's degree programs, 139 master's degree programs and 107 Ph.D. programs. Recently, Tsinghua has become the first Chinese university to offer a Master of Laws program in American law, through a cooperative venture with the Temple University Beasley School of Law. The university is a member of LAOTSE, an international network of leading universities in Europe and Asia. Each year, the University celebrates the Intellectual Property Summer Institute in cooperation with Franklin Pierce Law Center of Concord, New Hampshire.\nOn April 12, 2007, Tsinghua University's School of Economics and Management became the first business school in the Chinese mainland to earn AACSB accreditation. Former Premier Zhu Rongji was the founding dean of the school.\nThe University's Institute of Nuclear and New Energy Technology is on a separate campus in a northern suburb of Beijing.\nTsinghua is where former United States Vice President Al Gore lectured at in his documentary, An Inconvenient Truth. Viewers can see the university lecture hall, with its well-known purple seats.\nCampus.\nThe campus of Tsinghua University is in northwest Beijing, in the Haidian district which was designated for universities.\nIt is located on the former site of Qing Dynasty royal gardens and retains some Chinese-style landscaping as well as some traditional buildings, but many of its buildings are Western-style reflecting the American influence in its history. It is known throughout China for having one of the most beautiful campuses.\nThe university's architect T. Chuang, a 1914 graduate of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, modeled his designs for the quadrangle and auditorium of Tsinghua on the Illinois campus, specifically imitating Foellinger Auditorium, located on the quad at the University of Illinois.\nUniversity Traditions.\nTsinghua Alma Mater.\nTsinghua's early alma mater (school anthem) was composed by an American instructor Miss Katherine E. Seelye:\nIn 1923, another version of the school alma mater with lyrics in Chinese (by Prof. Wang Luan Xiang, a Chinese language professor of Tsinghua) was composed by Mrs. Zhang Hui Zhen and was well received by the students and faculty. The song was then adopted as the school's official Alma Mater.\nAnniversary and Homecoming.\nThe last Sunday of April is Tsinghua's anniversary and Homecoming (\"Xiao-Qing\") Day.\nSchool Flowers.\nRedbud and Lilac\nSchool Colors.\nPurple and White\nTsinghua Fight Song.\nThe school cheer goes: Ri-ri-ri, Rah-rah-rah! Tsinghua, Tsinghua, Tsinghua ! Rah-rah-rah!\nGlobal Partnership.\nTsinghua University has signed agreements with ACCA (Association of Chartered Certified Accountants), the renowned international accountancy body that offers Chartered Certified Accountant qualification worldwide, to train the new generation of professional accountants in China. Under the agreement, Tsinghua will develop the programme that under ACCA's syllabus for enabling China's young accounting students to join the ACCA professional exam scheme at a higher level. Tsinghua will also recognise the Oxford Brookes University BSc Applied Accounting degree, which has been successfully developed in conjunction with ACCA and which enables students who have completed two parts of the ACCA qualification to apply for the Oxford Brookes degree.(Please click: )"}

Bathymetric (or hydrographic) charts are often made to support the safety of underwater navigation and exploration. Most of these underwater topographic maps use contour lines (called \"depth contours\" or \"isobaths\") to show the terrain of the sea floor, and how deep it is. They usually also give surface navigational information.\nOriginally, bathymetry involved the measurement of ocean depth through sounding. Early techniques used heavy rope or cable lowered over a ship's side. This method measures the depth of the water at a single location each time. It was not a very accurate method. The data used to make bathymetric maps today usually comes from an echosounder (sonar). This device is attached to the bottom or the side of a boat."}

The best known are probably the caves of Altamira (in Spain), Lascaux (in France), or Creswell Crags in England. Sometimes, paintings were also done on cliff faces. Fewer of those have survived though, because of erosion. One such example are the rock paintings of Astuvansalmi (in Finland).\nMost often, animals or hunting scenes were painted.

It is a type of radiometric dating. \nThe method uses the radioactive isotope carbon-14. Most organic matter contains carbon. Carbon has different isotopes, which are usually not radioactive. 14C is the radioactive one, its half-life (time it takes to reduce its radioactivity by half) is about 5,730 years. This makes it possible to tell the age of substances that contain carbon. The method works to about 60,000 years old. Dates obtained are usually written as \"before present\" ('present' is 1950). \nPlants take up atmospheric carbon dioxide by photosynthesis, and are eaten by animals, so every living thing is constantly exchanging carbon-14 with its environment as long as it lives. Once it dies, however, this exchange stops.\nIn 1958 Hessel de Vries showed that the concentration of carbon-14 in the atmosphere varies with time and locality. The relatively short-lived 14C is constantly renewed by cosmic ray bombardment on atmospheric nitrogen. Since the bombardment is slightly variable, and for other reasons, the 14C taken into organic matter is also slightly variable. That leads to errors in the chronology. However, under about 20,000 years the results can be compared with dendrochronology, based on tree rings. For the most accurate work, variations are compensated by means of calibration curves. \nThe method was developed by Willard Libby and his colleagues at the University of Chicago in 1949. In 1960, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work. He first demonstrated the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by accurately estimating the age of wood from an ancient Egyptian royal barge of which the age was known from historical documents."}

It lasted from about 1200 BC to about 275 BC. \nThere were different periods that are now told apart mainly by the kinds of brooches used. The brooches changed rather rapidly and permit a good estimate. Hallstatt culture sites have been found in the east of France, in Switzerland, in the south of Germany, in Austria, in Slovenia and Croatia, northwestern Hungary, southwestern Slovakia and southern Moravia.\nIn this time, the social structure developed into a hierarchy. That can be documented by various things that were added to graves, such as at Magdalenenberg. In the Bronze Age, people lived in big settlements. As iron became available, trade routes changed. A new upper class could establish itself. Unlike before, the upper class liked to live in big houses in the countryside to show their power.\nFunerary cults also changed, from cremation burials, to burials with sarcophagi. The new upper class used its wealth for import goods, mostly from the Mediterranean. People started settling there around the 2nd millennium BC.\nOther websites.\nHallstatt culture: the real thing.

It is not known who wrote it, and there is no agreement as to when it was written. Estimates for the date range from AD 608 right through to AD 1000, and there is no consensus. The poem has only one manuscript source, written about 1010. \"Beowulf\" is 3182 lines long. Tolkien describes and illustrates many of the features of Old English poetry in his 1940 essay \"On translating Beowulf\".\nThe protagonist of the poem is Beowulf. In the poem, Beowulf fights three monsters: Grendel and Grendel's mother, and later in his life an unnamed dragon. \nStory.\nHrothgar, a Danish king, has built a big mead hall, which is called Heorot. Hrothgar and his people live a good life and celebrate in Heorot. But then they are attacked by Grendel, who comes to Heorot every night and kills some of Hrothgar's people.\nBeowulf is a warrior from Geatland (modern southern Sweden). He hears of Hrothgar's troubles with Grendel. Beowulf and his men leave Geatland to help King Hrothgar.\nBeowulf and his men stay the night in Heorot. When Grendel comes to kill them, Beowulf fights him. Beowulf tears Grendel's arm off from his body and sticks it on the wall as a trophy. Grendel runs to his home in the marshes, where he dies. Everyone is happy that Grendel is killed and celebrates. \nBut the next night, Grendel's mother comes to Heorot and kills many people for revenge and grabs Grendel's arm. Beowulf then goes to the marshes where Grendel and his mother lived. Beowulf fights Grendel's mother and kills her.\nBeowulf later becomes a king. He fights a dragon that was living in a barrow. With the help of the young man Wiglaf, Beowulf kills the dragon. Beowulf is wounded in the final battle and dies and crowns Wiglaf as his successor. \nAdaptations.\nThe story of \"Beowulf\" has often been told in books, plays, and films. Sometimes the full story is told, sometimes just parts of the story. Sometimes the plot is altered. Sometimes only ideas or themes are taken from the story. \nSome examples are:"}

She is a Time Lady from the planet Gallifrey, and she was a companion of the Fourth Doctor.\nBecause she was a Time Lord, Romana was able to regenerate, having two on-screen incarnations with somewhat different personalities (called Romana I and Romana II by fans). Romana I was played by Mary Tamm from 1978 to 1979. When she became pregnant and chose not to return for another series, the part was recast. Romana II was played by Lalla Ward from 1979 to 1981.\nRomana I.\nThe White Guardian assigns Romana to help the Doctor during his quest for the Key to Time. Romana first appears in \"The Ribos Operation\", and was intended as a contrast to her predecessor, the savage Leela. Romana is initially haughty and somewhat arrogant, looking down on the Doctor (whom she considers to be her academic inferior; she obtained a triple first at the academy, while the Doctor passed with only 51 percent, on his second attempt) and responding to his initial resentment at her presence with icy put-downs. However, she soon gains an appreciation for the Doctor's experience and sense of adventure, and begins to respect him as a teacher.\nRomana II.\nThe introduction of Romana's second incarnation in \"Destiny of the Daleks\", a script credited to Terry Nation, but with several changes by script editor Douglas Adams, treats the concept of regeneration humorously. At the beginning of the serial, Romana changes bodily forms several times, like she was trying on different outfits, before deciding to take the form of Princess Astra, who had been played by Lalla Ward in the final serial of Season 16, \"The Armageddon Factor\".\nRomana II enjoys a more intimate relationship with the Doctor than her first incarnation, some fans have assumed that she had a romantic relationship with the Doctor. Although a relationship was never shown or intended by the writers. In many ways, she is the companion most like her Doctor - besides being of the same race and close to the same intelligence, she occasionally mimics his sense of style, wields her own sonic screwdriver and can occasionally get the better of him in moments of banter and more practical situations. As her practical experience develops, she also becomes more assured and capable in the situations she finds herself in.\nHer final television appearance was in \"Warriors' Gate\", where, along with the robot dog K-9, she leaves to forge her own path in the parallel universe of E-space. She also appears briefly in the 20th Anniversary special \"The Five Doctors\" through the reuse of footage from the uncompleted story \"Shada\" because Tom Baker refused to come back.\nAfter the departure of both Romana I and II, both versions of the character also appeared very briefly in flashback sequences during the Fourth Doctor's regeneration in \"Logopolis\" as well as the Fifth Doctor's mind-copy in \"Resurrection of the Daleks\".\nShe would also be mentioned in \"Castrovalva\" during the Fifth Doctor's post-regenerative confusion, as well as \"Arc of Infinity\", where the Fifth Doctor, in response to a reprimand from the High Council of Time Lords for \"leaving her behind\", retorts that she \"chose to remain in E-Space\".\nIn the new series the doctor says that all of the Time Lords apart from him were killed in the time war. Whether Romana was killed with the others, or is still alive in E-Space or elsewhere, has not been specifically established on screen.\nAppearances in other media.\nAn article by Russell T Davies in the \"Doctor Who Annual 2006\" states that Romana was President of the Time Lords during the Time War against the Daleks (see below), which ended with Gallifrey being destroyed. As with all spin-off media and the new series, it is unknown if it is canon.\nNovels.\nIn the licensed Virgin New Adventures novel \"Blood Harvest\" by Terrance Dicks, Romana II leaves E-Space and returns to Gallifrey with the help of the Seventh Doctor. In \"Goth Opera\" by Paul Cornell, from the complementary Missing Adventures series, she is given a seat on the High Council of Time Lords. In New Adventures' \"Happy Endings\", also by Cornell, it is revealed that Romana has become Lady President of Gallifrey. Romana's presidency is reflected in the later novels and in her appearances (voiced by Ward) in audio dramas from Big Finish Productions. Romana appears in independent charity novel Time's Champion, in the role of President of the Time Lords.\nIn the BBC Books Eighth Doctor Adventures novels, Romana undergoes a second regeneration, and her new incarnation (Romana III, whose appearance was modelled on silent movie actress Louise Brooks) is far less sympathetic and far more ruthless than the other two.\nAudio plays.\nRomana II appeared pseudonymously in a series of audio plays produced in the early 2000s by BBV. In this series, Lalla Ward played a character who appeared with K-9 in an unnamed parallel universe. This character is called the Mistress (which was what K-9 called Romana in the television series). Because of an unusual copyright situation in which BBV was able to license K-9 but not Romana or other \"Doctor Who\" elements, the Mistress is not explicitly called Romana. For similar reasons, the parallel universe (obviously intended to reflect Romana's exile in E-Space) is called a \"pocket universe\" in the series' packaging.\nIn Big Finish's regular line of \"Doctor Who\" audio stories, Ward joined the Sixth Doctor in \"The Apocalypse Element\", in which Romana is Lady President of Gallifrey. In \"Zagreus\", Romana II is forced to banish the Eighth Doctor from the universe as he has become a danger to it following his infection by the forces of \"anti-time\". Following on from this, she is featured in a number of audio plays with former Doctor companion Leela (played by Louise Jameson) under the umbrella title of \"Gallifrey\".\nThe series ends on a cliffhanger, with Gallifrey on the brink of economic and social collapse as well as in danger of being overrun by a Free Time virus, while most of the characters are trapped with no apparent means of escape."}

She was chosen by the Xianfeng Emperor as a concubine. She gained almost total control over the court when the rule of her son the Tongzhi Emperor started. He and her nephew the Guangxu Emperor attempted unsuccessfully to rule in their own right.\nAs the source tells it, Cixi had a partnership with the #1 concubine Zhin, who had been raised to Empress. The two women ruled together, with Cixi as the more dominant personality.\nShe was in charge during the Opium Wars, First Sino-Japanese War, and the Boxer Rebellion. She was largely conservative during her rule, and some historians consider her reign despotism, and think that she might be responsible for the fall of the Qing Dynasty, and therefore Imperial China, as a result of Cixi's rule."}
