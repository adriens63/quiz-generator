{"id": "749781", "revid": "590442", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=749781", "title": "Minorities in Turkey", "text": "Minorities in Turkey form a substantial part of the country's population, with at least an estimated 30% of the populace belonging to an ethnic minority. While the Republic of Turkey, following the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, recognizes Armenians, Greeks and Jews as ethnic minorities, this legal status is not granted to Muslim minorities, such as the Kurds, which constitute the largest minority by a wide margin (13\u201318%), nor any of the other minorities in the country. The amount of ethnic minorities is suspected to be underestimated by the Turkish government. Ethnic Albanians, Pontic Greeks, Kurds, Arabs, Bosniaks, Circassians and Chechen people are usually considered Turkish under ethnic Turkish law (Ethnic Turkish Law).\nMany of the minorities (including the Albanians, Bosnians, Crimean Tatars, and various peoples from the Caucasus, as well as some of the Turks themselves) are descendants of Muslims (\"muhajirs\") who were expelled from the lands lost by the shrinking Ottoman Empire, but they have assimilated into and intermarried with the majority Turkish population and have adopted the Turkish language and way of life, though this does not make them ethnic Turks.\nAlthough many minorities have no official recognition, state-run TRT television and radio broadcasts minority language programs and elementary schools offer minority language classes.\nEthnic minorities.\nBalkan peoples.\nAlbanians.\nA 2008 report from the Turkish National Security Council (MGK) estimated that approximately 1.3 million people of Albanian ancestry live in Turkey, and more than 500,000 recognizing their ancestry, language and culture. There are other estimates however that place the number of people in Turkey with Albanian ancestry and or background upward to 5 million.\nHowever, these assumptions of the Turkish government are rejected by scholars who explain they are without any basis.\nBosniaks.\nToday, the existence of Bosniaks in the country is evident everywhere. In cities like \u0130stanbul, Eski\u015fehir, Ankara, \u0130zmir, or Adana, one can easily find districts, streets, shops or restaurants with names such as Bosna, Yenibosna, Mostar, or Novi Pazar. However, it is extremely difficult to estimate how many Bosniaks live in this country. Some Bosnian researchers believe that the number of Bosniaks in Turkey is about four million. Turkish politicians are aware of the large number of Bosniaks living in Turkey, and, referencing this in 2010, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davuto\u011flu said: \"There are more Bosniaks living in Turkey than in Bosnia.\"\nBulgarians.\nPeople identifying as Bulgarian include a large number of the Pomak and a small number of Orthodox Bulgarians. According to Ethnologue at present 300,000 Pomaks in European Turkey speak Bulgarian as their mother tongue.\nIt is very hard to estimate the number of Pomaks along with the Turkified Pomaks who live in Turkey, as they have blended into the Turkish society and have been often linguistically and culturally dissimilated. According to \"Milliyet\" and \"Turkish Daily News\" reports, the number of Pomaks along with the Turkified Pomaks in the country is about 600,000. According to the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Bulgarian Orthodox Christian community in Turkey stands at 500 members.\nGreeks.\nThe Greeks constitute a population of Greek and Greek-speaking Eastern Orthodox Christians who mostly live in Istanbul, including its district Princes' Islands, as well as on the two islands of the western entrance to the Dardanelles: Imbros and Tenedos ( and \"Bozcaada\"). Some Greek-speaking Byzantine Christians have been assimilated over the course of the last one thousand years.\nThey are the remnants of the estimated 200,000 Greeks who were permitted under the provisions of the Treaty of Lausanne to remain in Turkey following the 1923 population exchange, which involved the forcible resettlement of approximately 1.5 million Greeks from Anatolia and East Thrace and of half a million Turks from all of Greece except for Western Thrace. After years of persecution (e.g. the Varl\u0131k Vergisi and the Istanbul Pogrom), emigration of ethnic Greeks from the Istanbul region greatly accelerated, reducing the 119,822\n-strong Greek minority before the attack to about 7,000 by 1978. The 2008 figures released by the Turkish Foreign Ministry places the current number of Turkish citizens of Greek descent at the 3,000\u20134,000 mark.\nAccording to Milliyet there are 15,000 Greeks in Turkey, while according to Human Rights Watch the Greek population in Turkey was estimated at 2,500 in 2006. According to the same source, the Greek population in Turkey was collapsing as the community was by then far too small to sustain itself demographically, due to emigration, much higher death rates than birth rates and continuing discrimination. In recent years however, most notably since the economic crisis in Greece, the trend has reversed. A few hundred to over a thousand Greeks now migrate to Turkey yearly for employment or educational purposes.\nChristian Greeks were forced to migrate. Muslim Greeks live in Turkey today. They live in cities of Trabzon and Rize. Pontic Greeks have Greek ancestry and speak the Pontic Greek dialect, a distinct form of the standard Greek language which, due to the remoteness of Pontus, has undergone linguistic evolution distinct from that of the rest of the Greek world. The Pontic Greeks had a continuous presence in the region of Pontus (modern-day northeastern Turkey), Georgia, and Eastern Anatolia from at least 700 BC until 1922.\nSince 1924, the status of the Greek minority in Turkey has been ambiguous. Beginning in the 1930s, the government instituted repressive policies forcing many Greeks to emigrate. Examples are the labour battalions drafted among non-Muslims during World War II as well as the Fortune Tax levied mostly on non-Muslims during the same period. These resulted in financial ruination and death for many Greeks. The exodus was given greater impetus with the Istanbul Pogrom of September 1955 which led to thousands of Greeks fleeing the city, eventually reducing the Christian Greek population to about 7,000 by 1978 and to about 2,500 by 2006 before beginning to increase again after 2008.\nSerbs.\nIn the 1965 Census 6,599 Turkish citizen spoke Serbian as a first language and another 58,802 spoke Serbian as a second language.\nCaucasus peoples.\nAbkhaz.\nAbkhazians or the Abkhaz (Abkhaz: \u0410\u04a7\u0441\u0443\u0430, \"Apswa\"; ) are a Northwest Caucasian ethnic group, mainly living in Abkhazia, a disputed region on the Black Sea coast. A large Abkhaz diaspora population resides in Turkey, the origins of which lie in the population movements from the Caucasus in the late 19th century. Many Abkhaz also live in other parts of the former Soviet Union, particularly in Russia and Ukraine.\nArmenians.\nArmenians are indigenous to the Armenian Highlands which corresponds to the eastern half of modern-day Turkey, the Republic of Armenia, southern Georgia, western Azerbaijan, and northwestern Iran. Although in 1880 the word \"Armenia\" was banned from being used in the press, schoolbooks, and governmental establishments in Turkey and was subsequently replaced with words like eastern Anatolia or northern Kurdistan, Armenians had maintained much of their culture and heritage. The Armenian population of Turkey was greatly reduced following the Hamidian massacres and especially the Armenian Genocide, when over one and half million Armenians, virtually the entire Armenian population of Anatolia, were massacred. Prior to the Genocide in 1914, the Armenian population of Turkey numbered at about 1,914,620. The Armenian community of the Ottoman Empire before the Armenian genocide had an estimated 2,300 churches and 700 schools (with 82,000 students). This figure excludes churches and schools belonging to the Protestant and Catholic Armenian parishes since only those churches and schools under the jurisdiction of the Istanbul Armenian Patriarchate and the Apostolic Church were counted. After the Armenian genocide however, it is estimated that 200,000 Armenians remained in Turkey. Today there are an estimated 40,000 to 70,000 Armenians in Turkey, not including the Hamshenis.\nArmenians under the Turkish Republican era were subjected to many policies which attempted to abolish Armenian cultural heritage such as the Turkification of last names, Islamification, geographical name changes, confiscation of properties, change of animal names, change of the names of Armenian historical figures (i.e. the name of the prominent Balyan family were concealed under an identity of a superficial Italian family called Baliani), and the change and distortion of Armenian historical events.\nArmenians today are mostly concentrated around Istanbul. The Armenians support their own newspapers and schools. The majority belong to the Armenian Apostolic faith, with much smaller numbers of Armenian Catholics and Armenian Evangelicals. The community currently functions 34, 18 schools, and 2 hospitals.\nChechens and Ingush.\nChechens in Turkey are Turkish citizens of Chechen descent and Chechen refugees living in Turkey. Chechens and Ingush live in the provinces of Istanbul, Kahramanmara\u015f, Mardin, Sivas, and Mu\u015f.\nCircassians.\nAccording to Milliyet, there are approximately 2.5 million Circassians in Turkey. However such assumptions have no basis. According to scholars and EU there are three to five million Circassians in Turkey. The closely related ethnic groups Abazins (10,000) and Abkhazians (39,000) are also counted as Circassians. The Circassians are a Caucasian immigrant people; the vast majority of them have been assimilated and only 20% still speak Circassian. In Turkey, they are usually Sunni (Hanafi) Muslim.\nDagestani peoples.\nVarious ethnic groups from Dagestan are present in Turkey. Dagestani peoples live in villages in the provinces like Bal\u0131kesir, Tokat and also scattered in other parts of the country. A majority among them are Nogais; Lezgins and Avars are other significant ethnic groups. Kumyks are also present.\nGeorgians.\nThere are approximately 1 million people of Georgian ancestry in Turkey according to the newspaper \"Milliyet\". Georgians in Turkey are mostly Sunni Muslims of Hanafi \"madh'hab\". Immigrant Georgians are called \"Chveneburi\", but autochthonous Muslim Georgians use this term as well. Muslim Georgians form the majority in parts of Artvin Province east of the \u00c7oruh River. Immigrant Muslim groups of Georgian origin, found scattered in Turkey, are known as Chveneburi. The smallest Georgian group are Catholics living in Istanbul.\nLaz.\nMost Laz people today live in Turkey, but the Laz minority group has no official status in Turkey. Their number today is estimated at 2,250,000. The Laz are Sunni Muslims. Only a minority are bilingual in Turkish and their native Laz language which belongs to the Kartvelian Language group along with Georgian. The number of the Laz speakers is decreasing, and is now limited chiefly to the Rize and Artvin areas. The historical term Lazistan \u2014 formerly referring to a narrow tract of land along the Black Sea inhabited by the Laz as well as by several other ethnic groups \u2014 has been banned from official use and replaced with \"Do\u011fu Karadeniz\" (which also includes Trabzon). During the Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u20131878, the Muslim population of Russia near the war zones was subjected to ethnic cleansing; many Lazes living in Batum fled to the Ottoman Empire, settling along the southern Black Sea coast to the east of Samsun.\nCentral Asian peoples.\nTurkey received refugees from among the Pakistan-based Kazakhs, Turkmen, Kirghiz, and Uzbeks numbering 3,800 originally from Afghanistan during the Soviet\u2013Afghan War. Kayseri, Van, Amasva, Cicekdag, Gaziantep, Tokat, Urfa, and Serinvol received via Adana the Pakistan-based Kazakh, Turkmen, Kirghiz, and Uzbek refugees numbering 3,800 with UNHCR assistance.\nKazakhs.\nThey are about 30,000 Kazakh people living in Zeytinburnu-Istanbul. It is known that there are Kazakh people in other parts of Turkey, for instance Manisa, Konya. In 1969 and 1954 Kazakhs migrated into Anatolia's Salihli, Develi and Altay regions. Turkey became home to refugee Kazakhs. The Kazakh Turks Foundation (Kazak T\u00fcrkleri Vakf\u0131) is an organization of Kazakhs in Turkey. Kazakhs in Turkey came via Pakistan and Afghanistan. \"Kazak K\u00fclt\u00fcr Derne\u011fi\" (Kazakh Culture Associration) is a Kazakh diaspora organization in Turkey.\nKyrgyz.\nTurkey's Lake Van area is the home of Kyrgyz refugees from Afghanistan. Turkey became a destination for Kyrgyz refugees due to the Soviet\u2013Afghan War from Afghanistan's Wakhan area 500 remained and did not go to Turkey with the others. \"Friendship and Culture Society of Kyrgyzstan\" (\u041a\u044b\u0440\u0433\u044b\u0437\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d \u0414\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043a \u0436\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f\u0442 \u041a\u043e\u043e\u043c\u0443) (K\u0131rg\u0131zistan K\u00fclt\u00fcr ve Dostluk Derne\u011fi Resmi Sitesi) is a Kyrgyz diaspora organization in Turkey.\nThey were airlifted in 1982 from Pakistan where they had sought refugee after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan at the end of 1979. Their original home was at the eastern end of the Wakhan Corridor, in the Pamirs, bordering on China. It is not known how many Kyrgyz still live in Van and how many have moved on to other parts of Turkey.\nTurkmen.\nThere are only 1,500 ethnic Turkmen in Turkey.\nTajik.\nThere are only 1,000 ethnic Tajik in Turkey.\nUzbeks.\nTurkey is home to 45,000 Uzbeks. In the 1800s Konya's north Bogrudelik was settled by Tatar Bukharlyks. In 1981 Afghan Turkestan refugees in Pakistan moved to Turkey to join the existing Kayseri, Izmir, Ankara, and Zeytinburnu based communities. Turkish based Uzbeks have established links to Saudi-based Uzbeks.\nUyghurs.\nTurkey is home to 50,000 Uyghurs. A community of Uyghurs live in Turkey. Kayseri received Uyghurs numbering close to 360 via the UNHCR in 1966\u20131967 from Pakistan. The Turkey-based Uyghur diaspora had a number of family members among Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, India, and Pakistan based Uyghurs who stayed behind while the UNHCR and government of Turkey had Kayseri receive 75 Uyghurs in 1967 and 230 Uyghurs in 1965 and a number in 1964 under Alptekin and Bughra. \"We never call each other Uyghur, but only refer to ourselves as East Turkestanis, or Kashgarlik, Turpanli, or even Turks.\"- according to some Uyghurs born in Turkey.\nA community of Uyghurs live in Istanbul. Tuzla and Zeytinburnu mosques are used by the Uyghurs in Istanbul. Piety is a characteristic of among Turkey dwelling Uyghurs.\nIstanbul's districts of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck\u00e7ekmece, Sefak\u00f6y and Zeytinburnu are home to Uyghur communities. Eastern Turkistan Education and Solidarity Association is located in Turkey. Abdurahmon Abdulahad of the East Turkistan Education Association supported Uzbek Islamists who protested against Russia and Islam Karimov's Uzbekistan government. Uyghurs are employed in K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck\u00e7ekmece and Zeytinburnu restaurants. \"East Turkistan Immigration Association\", \"East Turkistan Culture and Solidarity Association\", and \"Eastern Turkistan Education and Solidarity Association\" are Uyghur diaspora organizations in Turkey.\nTurkic peoples.\nAzerbaijanis.\nIt is hard to determine how many ethnic Azeris currently reside in Turkey because ethnicity is a rather fluid concept in this country. and According to the Looklex Encyclopaedia, Azerbaijani people make up 800,000 of Turkey's population. Up to 300,000 of Azeris who reside in Turkey are citizens of Azerbaijan. In the Eastern Anatolia Region, Azeris are sometimes referred to as \"acem\" (see Ajam) or \"tat\". They currently are the largest ethnic group in the city of I\u011fd\u0131r and second largest ethnic group in Kars.\nCrimean Tatars.\nBefore the 20th century, Crimean Tatars had immigrated from Crimea to Turkey in three waves: First, after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 1783; second, after the Crimean War of 1853-56; third, after the Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u201378. The official number of Crimean Tatars is 150,000 (in the center of Eski\u015fehir) but the real population (in the whole of Turkey) may be a few million. They mostly live in Eski\u015fehir Province and Kazan-Ankara.\nKarachay.\nKarachay people live in villages concentrated in Konya and Eski\u015fehir.\nMeskhetian Turks.\nThere is a community of Meskhetian Turks (Ahiska Turks) in Turkey.\nIranian peoples.\nAbdal.\nGroups of nomadic and semi-nomadic itinerants found mainly in central and western Anatolia. They speak an argot of their own and follow the Alevi faith.\nAfghans.\nAfghans are one of the largest irregular migrant groups in Turkey. From the period 2003\u20132007, the number of Afghans apprehended were significant, with statistics almost doubling during the last year. Most had fled the War in Afghanistan. In 2005, refugees from Afghanistan numbered 300 and made a sizeable proportion of Turkey's registered migrants. Most of them were spread out over satellite cities with Van and A\u011fr\u0131 being the most specific locations. In the following years, the number of Afghans entering Turkey greatly increased, second only to migrants from Iraq; in 2009, there were 16,000 people designated under the Iraq-Afghanistan category. Despite a dramatic 50 percent reduction by 2010, reports confirmed hundreds living and working in Turkey. As of January 2010, Afghans consisted one-sixth of the 26,000 remaining refugees and asylum seekers. By the end 2011, their numbers are expected to surge up to 10,000, making them the largest population and surpass other groups.\nKurds.\nEthnic Kurds are the largest minority in Turkey, composing around 20% of the population according to Milliyet, 18% of the total populace or c. 14 million people according to the CIA World Factbook, and as much as 23% according to Kurdologist David McDowall. Unlike the Turks, the Kurds speak an Iranian language. There are Kurds living all over Turkey, but most live to the east and southeast of the country, from where they originate.\nIn the 1930s, Turkish government policy aimed to forcibly assimilate and Turkify local Kurds. Since 1984, Kurdish resistance movements included both peaceful political activities for basic civil rights for Kurds within Turkey, and violent armed rebellion for a separate Kurdish state.\nOssetians.\nOssetians emigrated from North Ossetia since the second half of the 19th century, end of Caucasian War. Today, the majority of them live in Ankara and Istanbul. There are 24 Ossetian villages in central and eastern Anatolia. The Ossetians in Turkey are divided into three major groups, depending on their history of immigration and ensuing events: those living in Kars (Sar\u0131kam\u0131\u015f) and Erzurum, those in Sivas, Tokat and Yozgat and those in Mu\u015f and Bitlis.\nPersians.\n500,000 to 650,000.\nZazas.\nThe Zazas are a community who identifies as ethnic Kurds. Their language Zazaki is a language spoken in eastern Anatolia between the rivers Euphrates and Tigris. It belongs to the northwest-Iranian group of the Iranian language branch of the Indo-European language family. The Zaza language is related to Kurdish, Persian and Bal\u014dchi. An exact indication of the number of Zaza speakers is unknown. Internal Zaza sources estimate the total number of Zaza speakers at 3 to 6 million.\nEuropean peoples.\nBritons.\nThere are at least 34,000 Britons in Turkey. They consist mainly of British citizens married to Turkish spouses, British Turks who have moved back into the country, students and families of long-term expatriates employed predominately in white-collar industry.\nDutch.\nApproximately 15,000 Dutch live in Turkey.\nGermans.\nThere are over 50,000 Germans living in Turkey, primarily Germans married to Turkish spouses, employees, retirees and long-term tourists who buy properties across the Turkish coastline, often spending most of the year in the country. In addition, many Turkish Germans have also returned and settled, and it is not uncommon to hear German being spoken on the streets of Istanbul by Turks.\nLevantines.\nLevantines continue to live in Istanbul (mostly in the districts of Galata, Beyo\u011flu and Ni\u015fanta\u015f\u0131), \u0130zmir (mostly in the districts of Kar\u015f\u0131yaka, Bornova and Buca), and the lesser port city Mersin where they had been influential for creating and reviving a tradition of opera. Famous people of the present-day Levantine community in Turkey include Maria Rita Epik, Franco-Levantine Caroline Giraud Ko\u00e7 and Italo-Levantine Giovanni Scognamillo. About 35,000 Levantines live in Turkey.\nPoles.\nThere are only 4,000 ethnic Poles in Turkey who have been assimilated into the main Turkish culture. The immigration did start during the Partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. J\u00f3zef Bem was one of the first immigrants and Prince Adam Jerzy Czartoryski founded Polonezk\u00f6y in 1842. Most Poles in Turkey live in Polonezk\u00f6y, Istanbul.\nRussians.\nRussians in Turkey number about 50,000 citizens. Russians began migrating to Turkey during the first half of the 1990s. Most were fleeing the economic problems prevalent after the dissolution of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. During this period, many Russian immigrants intermarried and assimilated with Turkish locals, giving rise to a rapid increase in mixed marriages. There is a Russian Association of Education, Culture and Cooperation which aims to expand Russian language and culture in Turkey as well as promote the interests of the community.\nOther minorities.\nAfricans.\nBeginning several centuries ago, a number of Africans, usually via Zanzibar as Zanj and from places such as Niger, Saudi Arabia, Libya, Kenya and Sudan, came to the Ottoman Empire settled by the Dalaman, Menderes and Gediz valleys, Manavgat, and \u00c7ukurova. African quarters of 19th-century \u0130zmir, including Sab\u0131rta\u015f\u0131, Dolapkuyu, Tama\u015fal\u0131k, \u0130ki\u00e7e\u015fmelik, and Ball\u0131kuyu, are mentioned in contemporary records. Due to the slave trade in the Ottoman Empire that had flourished in the Balkans, the coastal town of Ulcinj in Montenegro had its own black community. As a consequence of the slave trade and privateer activity, it is told how until 1878 in Ulcinj 100 black people lived. The Ottoman Army also deployed an estimated 30,000 Black African troops and cavalrymen to its expedition in Hungary during the Austro-Turkish War of 1716\u201318.\nArabs.\n \nArabs in Turkey number between 800,000 and 1 million, and they mostly live in provinces near the Syrian border, particularly the Hatay region, where they made up two thirds of the population in 1939. However, including recent Syrian refugees, they make up to 5.3% of the population. Most of them are Sunni Muslims. However, there is a small group of Alawis, and another one of Arab Christians (mostly in Hatay Province) in communion with the Antiochian Orthodox Church.\nTurkey experienced a large influx of Iraqis between the years of 1988 and 1991 due to both the Iran\u2013Iraq War and the first Gulf war, with around 50,000 to 460,000 Iraqis entering the country.\nSyrians in Turkey include migrants from Syria to Turkey, as well as their descendants. The number of Syrians in Turkey is estimated at over 3.58 million people as of April 2018, and consists mainly of refugees of the Syrian Civil War.\nAssyrians.\nAssyrians were once a large ethnic minority in the Ottoman Empire, but following the early 20th century Assyrian Genocide, many were murdered, deported, or ended up emigrating. Those that remain live in small numbers in their indigenous South Eastern Turkey (although in larger numbers than other groups murdered in Armenian or Greek genocides) and Istanbul. They number around 30,000.\nJews.\nThere have been Jewish communities in Asia Minor since at least the 5th century BC and many Spanish and Portuguese Jews expelled from Spain came to the Ottoman Empire (including regions part of modern Turkey) in the late 15th century. Despite emigration during the 20th century, modern-day Turkey continues to have a small Jewish population of about 20,000.\nRoma.\nThe Roma in Turkey number approximately 700,000 according to Milliyet. Sulukule is the oldest Roma settlement in Europe. By different Turkish and Non-Turkish estimates the number of Romani is up to 4 or 5 million while according to a Turkish source, they are only 0.05% of Turkey's population (or roughly persons). The descendants of the Ottoman Roma today are known as Xoraxane Roma and are of the Islamic faith.\nMinor foreigner.\nAustralians.\nThere are as many as 12,000 Australians in Turkey. Of these, the overwhelming majority are in the capital Ankara (roughly 10,000) while the remaining are in Istanbul. Australian expatriates in Turkey form one of the largest overseas Australian groups in Europe and Asia. The vast majority of Australian nationals in Turkey are Turkish Australians.\nBrazilians.\nBrazilians in Turkey are one of the very small Brazilian communities outside Brazil, numbering about 275. Majority of Brazilians in Turkey works in embassies and/or consulates in Istanbul and Ankara, with a small number works in private companies in other metropolitan cities.\nCanadians.\nThere are over 1,100 Canadians living in Turkey, the majority of which are based in Ankara and Istanbul according to the Registration of Canadians Abroad (ROCA) and the local Canadian embassy and consulates in the country. In recent years, the number of Canadians settling within Turkey has seen a sharp rise with the country continuing to be one of the fastest-rising destinations for Canadians heading overseas. The growing figures have been linked as a proponent for the skyrocketing ratio of Canadian tourists choosing to visit Turkey each year. In 2009, approximately 150,000 Canadians had been to Turkey, an increase from the 39,000 in 1995.\nChinese.\nThere is a small community of Chinese people in Turkey, mostly temporary expatriates. A few hundred Chinese students are enrolled in various Turkish universities. Turkey has a sizeable number of Muslim Uyghur people who hail from the Xinjiang region of China. They have come in large numbers since the early 1950s from the northwestern provinces of China, and as part of their migration to the Middle East, many chose to settle down in urban centres of Turkey. Today, they have effectively associated themselves with the local economy and can be seen practicing in various forms of trade.\nFilipinos.\nThere were 5,500 Filipinos in Turkey as of 2008, according to estimates by the Commission on Filipinos Overseas and the Philippine embassy in Ankara. Out of those, most are recorded as maids and \"overseas workers\" employed in households of diplomatic communities and elite Turkish families. Moreover, ten percent or approximately 500 Filipinos in Turkey are skilled workers and professionals working as engineers, architects, doctors and teachers. Most of the Filipinos reside in Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, Antalya and nearby surrounding areas.\nIndians.\nIndians in Turkey are a small community numbering 300 and comprising roughly 100 families. Most of them work as doctors and computer engineers or employees in multinational corporations. India also has a small business presence in Turkey through representative offices of Reliance Industries, Tata Motors and Indorama.\nJapanese.\nThere is a medium-sized population of Japanese people in Turkey, comprising mostly recent expatriates from Japan and their descendants born in Turkey. As of September 2010, their numbers were recorded at 1,430 by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Most Japanese living in Turkey are based in Ankara and Istanbul.\nPakistanis.\nPakistanis in Turkey refers to a small community consisting mainly of expatriates and students. Many of the Pakistani students study at Turkish universities and colleges. There are also large number of long-term and short-term economic migrants from Pakistan in Turkey who often intend to cross into the European Union. Pakistan has a permanent embassy in Ankara and a consulate general in Istanbul, which aim to serve the interests of the community throughout the country. Around 800 Pakistani students are studying in Turkey.\nReligious minorities.\nAtheists.\nIn Turkey, Atheism is the third biggest group after Islam and Christianity. The percentage of atheists according to polls apparently rose from about 2% in 2012 to approximately 6% in 2016.\nBah\u00e1'\u00ed.\nTurkish cities Edirne and \u0130stanbul are in the holy places of this religion. Estimate Bah\u00e1'\u00ed population in Turkey is 10,000 (2008) \nChristians.\nChristianity has a long history in Anatolia which, nowadays part of the Republic of Turkey's territory, was the birthplace of numerous Christian Apostles and Saints, such as Apostle Paul of Tarsus, Timothy, St. Nicholas of Myra, St. Polycarp of Smyrna and many others. Two out of the five centers (Patriarchates) of the ancient Pentarchy were located in present-day Turkey: Constantinople (Istanbul) and Antioch (Antakya). All of the first seven Ecumenical Councils which are recognized by both the Western and Eastern churches were held in present-day Turkey. Of these, the Nicene Creed, declared with the First Council of Nicaea (\u0130znik) in 325, is of utmost importance and has provided the essential definitions of present-day Christianity.\nToday the Christian population of Turkey estimated more than 150,000, includes an estimated 70,000 Armenian Orthodox, 35,000 Roman Catholics, 17,000 Syriac Orthodox, 8,000 Chaldean Catholic, 3,000-4,000 Greek Orthodox, 10,000-18,000 Antiochian Greeks and smaller numbers of Bulgarians, Georgians, and ethnic Turkish Protestants.\nOrthodox Christians.\nOrthodox Christianity forms a tiny minority in Turkey, comprising far less than one tenth of one percent of the entire population. The provinces of Istanbul and Hatay, which includes Antakya, are the main centres of Turkish Christianity, with comparatively dense Christian populations, though they are very small minorities. The main variant of Christianity present in Turkey is the Eastern Orthodox branch, focused mainly in the Armenian Apostolic and Syriac/Greek Orthodox Church.\nProtestants.\nProtestants comprise far less than one tenth of one percent of the population of Turkey. Even so, there is an Alliance of Protestant Churches in Turkey. \nThe constitution of Turkey recognizes freedom of religion for individuals. The Armenian Protestants own three Istanbul Churches from the 19th century.\nOn 4 November 2006, a Protestant place of worship was attacked with six Molotov cocktails. \nTurkish media have criticized Christian missionary activity intensely.\nThere is an ethnic Turkish Protestant Christian community most of them came from recent Muslim Turkish backgrounds, rather than from ethnic minorities.\nRoman Catholics.\nThere are around 35,000 Catholics, constituting 0.05% of the population. The faithful follow the Latin, Byzantine, Armenian and Chaldean Rite. Most Latin Rite Catholics are Levantines of mainly Italian or French background, although a few are ethnic Turks (who are usually converts via marriage to Levantines or other non-Turkish Catholics). Byzantine, Armenian, and Chaldean rite Catholics are generally members of the Greek, Armenian, and Assyrian minority groups respectively. Turkey's Catholics are concentrated in Istanbul.\nIn February 2006, Catholic priest Andrea Santoro, an Italian missionary working in Turkey for 10 years, was shot twice at his church near the Black Sea. He had written a letter to the Pope asking him to visit Turkey. Pope Benedict XVI visited Turkey in November 2006. Relations had been rocky since Pope Benedict XVI had stated his opposition to Turkey joining the European Union. The Council of Catholic Bishops met with the Turkish prime minister in 2004 to discuss restrictions and difficulties such as property issues. More recently, Bishop Luigi Padovese, on June 6, 2010, the Vicar Apostolic of Turkey, was killed.\nJews.\nThere have been Jewish communities in Asia Minor since at least the 5th century BC and many Spanish and Portuguese Jews expelled from Spain were welcomed to the Ottoman Empire (including regions part of modern Turkey) in the late 15th century. Despite emigration during the 20th century, modern-day Turkey continues to have a small Jewish population.\nThere is a small Karaite Jewish population numbering around 100. Karaite Jews are not considered Jews by the Turkish Hakhambashi.\nMuslims.\nAlawites.\nThe exact number of Alawites in Turkey is unknown, but there were 185 000 Alawites in 1970. As Muslims, they are not recorded separately from Sunnis in ID registration. In the 1965 census (the last Turkish census where informants were asked their mother tongue), 180,000 people in the three provinces declared their mother tongue as Arabic. However, Arabic-speaking Sunni and Christian people are also included in this figure.\nAlawites traditionally speak the same dialect of Levantine Arabic with Syrian Alawites. Arabic is best preserved in rural communities and Samanda\u011f. Younger people in \u00c7ukurova cities and (to a lesser extent) in \u0130skenderun tend to speak Turkish. Turkish spoken by Alawites is distinguished by Alawites and non-Alawites alike with its particular accents and vocabulary. Knowledge of Arabic alphabet is confined to religious leaders and men who had worked or studied in Arab countries.\nAlevis.\nAlevis are the biggest religious minority in Turkey. Nearly 15%-25% of all Turkish population is in this group. They are mainly Turk but there are significant Kurd and Zaza populations who are Alevi\nTwelvers Shia.\nTwelver shia population of Turkey is nearly 3 million and most of them are Azeris. Half million of Ja'faris live in \u0130stanbul.\nYazidi.\nTurkey is in the area of the Yazidi homeland, along with Syria and Iraq. The Yazidi population in Turkey was estimated at around 22.000 in 1984. Earlier figures are difficult to obtain and verify, but some estimate there were about 100.000 Yazidi in Turkey in the early years of the 20th century.\nMost Yazidis left the country and went abroad in the 1980s and 1990s, mostly to Germany and other European countries where they got asylum due to the persecution as an ethnic and religious minority in Turkey. The area they resided was in the south eastern area of Turkey, an area that had/has heavy PKK fighting. Now a few hundred Yazidi are believed to be left in Turkey."}

Ha is the grandson of Sir Ha Yeon, who is the twenty-first grandson of Joseon's most notable prime minister, Yeonguijeong.\nAfter his basic education, Ha began to read modern literature. He was motivated by a bookseller who visited the school and purchased a series of books on modern Korean literature. Thereafter, readings of Korean literature sparked his interest in writing and philosophy. In this process, Ha began to question humanity and thing-in-itself. During the high school years, Ha's spiritual journey continued. He pursued truth, the meaning of life and humanity in Buddhism, Hinduism and other major religions. In this spiritual journey, he read many western philosophical classics.\nHa was influenced by the works of Sigmund Freud, Carl Gustav Jung, Immanuel Kant and S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard. Ha experienced spiritual progression recognizing the importance and meaning of human existence, and the 'despair' of Kierkegaard and the 'reason' of Kant became a less serious issue to his life and study. At the end of 12th grade, Ha had a mystical religious experience that made him confess that God is the only answer to his quest for meaning. Ha then became a Christian.\nHis poetry became an artistic stimulus for artists in parts of England and America.\nCareer.\nHa became a Presbyterian minister and a professor of historical theology at Korea Presbyterian Theological Seminary. He teaches Biblical Exposition. Ha established Korea Presbyterian Church and the Korea Presbyterian Seminary, serving as Pastoral General, Christian education, Missions etc., at his own expense.\nHis theological thought is inherited from the original church, unlike the Roman Catholic or Reformed Church, or of the Protestant church, which offer traditional Christian interpretation. Ha presented the historical point of view of the Orthodox Church, describing how the confession of faith and the historical context coincide. Ha is a poet, and a reformist theologian. He debuted as a poet by the recommendation of fellow poet Park Jaesam and two others in \"Hankyoreh Literature Magazine\" in 1994."}

It was written by Steven Greene, Eric Alter, and Nick Thiel and directed by Dave Thomas. The movie was distributed by Paramount Pictures.\nPlot.\nTwo American nightclub owners from New York City, Travis (John Travolta) and Wendell (Arye Gross) are drugged and kidnapped while on their way to opening a nightclub in rural Nebraska. The KGB spy Cameron Smith (Charles Martin Smith) takes them to the Soviet Union, as \"experts\" on the \"American lifestyle\" with the intention of teaching KGB spies to be like Americans. And under the influence of drugs they think they have arrived in \"Nebraska\" to open the nightclub. Travis and Wendell are brought to the phony town of \"Indian Springs\", which is populated by Russians who speak perfect American English and act like Americans. KGB spies go there to study \"American people\" and \"American culture\", but is stuck in the 1950s. The KGB spy Smith is in charge of the \"typical American town\" built for espionage-training purposes and hopes that his fellow spies will learn real American culture. But things get out of control when Travis and Wendell introduce their fellow \"American\" neighbors current pop culture, turn a bar into a rock music club and teach the townsfolk to dance. Both also flirt with local women. \nTravis and Wendell increasingly become suspicious, but when they get lost in a forest and stumble upon a military base where everyone is speaking Russian, they realize that they are actually in the Soviet Union. Things also get dangerous when the townsfolk taste freedom, and the KGB decides to stop the experiment and kill the American \"guests\", who have to find ways to flee the country.\nReception.\n\"The Experts\" did very badly at the box office (it was a massive \"box office bomb\"); its budget was estimated at $3 million and the box office was only $169,203. The film was also badly criticized by the film critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a positive rating of only 26% from the audience."}

It was founded by conservative members of the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America(PCUSA) who strongly objected to the Modernist theology during the 1930s. It has had an influence on evangelicalism far beyond its size.\nHistory.\nThe Orthodox Presbyterian Church was founded in 1936, largely through the efforts of John Gresham Machen. Machen and others had founded Westminster Theological Seminary in 1929, in response to a re-organization of Princeton Theological Seminary. In 1933, Machen, concerned about Liberal Christianity|liberal theology tolerated by Presbyterians on the mission field, formed the Independent Board for Presbyterian Foreign Missions. The next Presbyterian General Assembly reaffirmed that Independent Board was unconstitutional and gave the associated clergy an ultimatum to break their links. When Machen and seven other clergy refused, they were suspended from the Presbyterian ministry.\nOn June 11, 1936, Machen and a group of conservative ministers, elders, and laymen met in Philadelphia to form the Presbyterian Church of America (not to be confused with the Presbyterian Church in America, or PCA, which came about decades later). Machen was elected as the first moderator. The PCUSA filed suit against the fledgling denomination for its choice of name, and in 1939, the denomination adopted its current name, the Orthodox Presbyterian Church.\nMachen died in January 1937. Later that year, a significant faction of the OPC, led by Carl McIntire, broke away to form the Bible Presbyterian Church, a denomination which, unlike the OPC, required abstinence from alcohol and taught premillennialism.\nCongregations.\nAs of 2014, The OPC had 281 congregations. In 2019, Escondido Orthodox Presbyterian Church received media attention as the church of which John Earnest, alleged perpetrator of the 2019 Poway synagogue shooting|Poway synagogue shooting, was a member. Its pastor, Zake Keele, condemned the shooting as an \"act of evil.\"\nDoctrine.\nThe OPC system of doctrine is the Reformed faith, also called Calvinism. Calvin's doctrines continued to develop after his death, and a particular evolution of them was set forth by a 17th-century assembly of British theologians in the Westminster Standards (which include the Westminster Confession of Faith and the Westminster Larger Catechism|Larger and Westminster Shorter Catechism|Shorter Catechisms). The OPC holds to the Westminster Standards with the American revisions of 1788.\nThe OPC provides the following summary of its doctrine:\nOPC pastors and presbyteries teach a range of doctrines based on the historical view of the biblical creation accounts, from framework and analogical interpretations to young earth.\nAmerican politics.\nThe 39th General Assembly, meeting in 1972, adopted a statement on abortion that included the affirmation that \"voluntary abortion, except possibly to save the physical life of the mother, is in violation of the Sixth Commandment (Exodus 20:13).\"\nIn 1993, the denomination petitioned then President Bill Clinton to continue to disallow homosexuals to serve in the military. According to the petition, \"homosexuality is a reproach to any nation. It undermines the family, and poses a substantial threat to the general health, safety and welfare of our citizens.\" The petition claims that AIDS and \"other diseases\" are spread particularly through homosexual conduct.\nThe 68th General Assembly declared that women serving in combat positions in the military is contrary to the Bible.\nIn 2006-2007, a study committee formed by the General Assembly created a report that concluded that \"the church should never turn its back on fellow brothers and sisters in Christ, whether they are legally or illegally in the country. We should be willing to see to the spiritual and physical needs of anyone who comes to the church.\" The report also recommended that illegal immigrants seek to \"repent\" of their legal status.\nOPC ministers have held a variety of political views. Carl Trueman, an ordained minister in the OPC, has authored \"Republocrat: Confessions of a Liberal Conservative\" (pub. 2010). Several founders of American Christian Reconstructionism (such as Rousas John Rushdoony and Greg Bahnsen) were Orthodox Presbyterian ministers."}

Launched in January 2012.\nMain Doctrine.\nMost objections to and attacks on Calvinism focus on the \"five points of Calvinism,\" also called the doctrines of grace, and remembered by the mnemonic \"TULIP.\" The five points are popularly said to summarize the Canons of Dort; however, there is no historical relationship between them, and some scholars argue that their language distorts the meaning of the Canons, Calvin's theology, and the theology of 17th-century Calvinistic orthodoxy, particularly in the language of total depravity and limited atonement. The five points were popularized in the 1963 booklet \"The Five Points of Calvinism Defined, Defended, Documented\" by David N. Steele and Curtis C. Thomas. The origins of the five points and the acronym are uncertain, but the acronym was used by Cleland Boyd McAfee as early as circa 1905. An early printed appearance of the T-U-L-I-P acronym is in Loraine Boettner's 1932 book, \"The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination\". The acronym was very cautiously if ever used by Calvinist apologists and theologians before the booklet by Steele and Thomas. More recently, theologians have sought to reformulate the TULIP acronym to more accurately reflect the Canons of Dort.\nThe central assertion of these points is that God saves every person upon whom he has mercy, and that his efforts are not frustrated by the unrighteousness or inability of humans.\nHistorical and Practical Doctrine.\nThe OPCK system of doctrine is the Reformed faith, also called Calvinism.

The most famous of these legendary kings is Ravana. Most people in the country believe that Ravana is still alive but in deep sleep. But most prominent historians regard Vijaya as Sri lanka's first king. Vijaya is an Indian prince who because of misbehavior was put in a boat with his 700 friends was sent off. He was the son of king Sinhabahu who was in fact the son of a Lion. Hence most Sinhalse claim to be descending from the Lion's blood.\nThere were several kings who ruled Sri Lanka after Vijaya but the most important after that was Pandukabaya because he chose Anuradhapura as the country's capital.\nColonial Era.\nThe first Portuguese arrived at Sri Lanka in 1505.\nCivil War.\nSri Lanka experienced the Civil war through years 1983 to 2009. Racial discrimination after the post colonial era was the main reason for civil war as such. The sinhala only act which was passed in 1953 was one of the main reasons for a war as such. This act led to about 1/3 of the population facing difficulties when performing daily tasks. It also gave superior status to the Sinhalese component of the population.\nEven though most people criticize the Act, it can be argued as a healthy decision as previously Lanka used colonial English to handle work at courts which limited amout of people understood. So it was really a choice between making more people understand or making the population literate in English.\nThe war was between the LTTE and the Sri Lankan army. Due to careful planning and expert battling techniques of Sarath Fonseka under the guidance of former president Mahinda Rajapakse and former defence secreatariat Gotabaya Rajapakse, the brutal civil war ended in May 2009 as the LTTE admitted defeat.\nPost-War Era.\nSri Lanka had to gain international confidence after the war."}

Non-LGBT persons do not commonly face these difficulties. India has removed laws that treated gay sex and transgender people unfairly. But Indian laws do not completely protect from unfair treatment or allow same-sex marriage.\nSince 2014, transgender people in India may change their gender without surgery. The constitution also gives them a right to name themselves under a third gender. Some states also protect \"hijras\", who are traditional third gender people in South Asia, through housing programmes, welfare benefits, pension schemes, and free operations in government hospitals. There are about 4.8 million transgender people in India.\nIn 2018, the Supreme Court of India said that homosexuality was not a crime. It declared that Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code did not follow the constitution when adults had consensual homosexual sex. Homosexuality was never illegal in ancient Indian and traditional codes. It was made a crime by the British during their rule in India.\nThough LGBT rights have been spoken for in recent political movements, much homophobia is still present among the people. A poll from 2019 says that around half of Indians object to same-sex relationships. Hindu respondents accept the LGBT community the highest. In 2010s, LGBT people in India gained tolerance and acceptance, especially in large cities. Still, most LGBT people in India remain hidden because they fear unfair treatment from their families who might see homosexuality as shameful.\nAllowing same-sex relationships.\nMarriages between people of the same sex are not allowed in India by law. Same-sex couples are also not given rights of civil union or a household partnership. In 2011, a Haryana court marked a same-sex marriage involving two women as lawful. After marrying, the couple got threats from friends and relatives in their village. Their family finally accepted their marriage.\nIn October 2017, a group of citizens advised that a new Uniform Civil Code be created. This code would make the same-sex marriage lawful before the Law Commission of India.\nThere are now many same-sex marriage applications still waiting to be judged by the courts.\nProtection from unfair treatment.\nArticle 15 of the Indian Constitution protects Indian citizens from unfair treatment\nThe Supreme Court of India has ruled that unfair treatment because of sexual orientation and gender identity did not follow the Constitution. \nEven after this, no clear law bans unfair treatment based on both sexual orientation and gender identity. India does not have detailed laws which protect against most unfair treatment and harassment in private jobs. (Such laws exist for sexual harassment though.) Article 15 only covers unfair treatment by government bodies.\nIn 2019, the \"Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2019\" was accepted. The law bans unfair treatment against transgender people in private jobs, education and healthcare.\nLGBT activists are reaching out to people who have faced unfair treatment (because of their sexual orientation or gender identity) in private jobs or other non-governmental areas. They are asking such people to question the two rulings in court. They are also fighting for a clear law against unfair treatment. Such a law would also cover private unfair treatment.\nIn the military.\nLGBT people are banned from working in the Indian military. In December 2018, Member of Parliament Jagdambika Pal (BJP) asked the Indian Parliament to change the \"Army Act, 1950\", the \"Navy Act, 1957\" and the \"Air Force Act, 1950\". His advised change would allow LGBT people to work in the military.\nEvents.\nActor Kamal Rashid Khan was booked by the police on December 9, 2018 for making rude comments against LGBT people.\nTreatments for conversion.\nIn February 2014, the Indian Psychiatric Society (IPS) said that homosexuality is not unnatural. It also said that neither science nor rules for psychiatry could prove that homosexuality is a mental illness or a disease. In June 2018, the IPS repeated its stand on the issue. It said that we should not disapprove of people who are not heterosexual, punish them, or remove them from the society.\nEven after this, conversion treatments still happen in India. They usually carry out electroshock treatment (which may cause memory loss), hypnosis, drugs causing nausea, or talk therapy. In talk therapy, the person is told that homosexuality happens because they are \"not asserting enough\" or have \"an uncaring father and a strict mother\". Conversion treatments can cause depression, anxiety, seizures, drug use and suicidal tendencies.\nSexual violence.\nIn July 2019, lawmaker K. T. S. Tulsi introduced the \"Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, 2018\" in the Rajya Sabha to amend the Indian Penal Code, the Criminal Procedure Code and the \"Indian Evidence Act, 1872\" in order to make sexual crimes gender-neutral by including men and transgender people in addition to women. If passed the bill allows for recognition of not only transgender persons defined as the \"other\" gender under Indian law, but would potentially leave the door open for the recognition of other gender identities.\nRights of intersex people.\nProblems of intersex people in India are seen as problems of third gender people. The most well-known third gender groups in India are the \"hijras\". After talking to \"hijras\" for many years, Serena Nanda wrote a book called \"Neither Man Nor Woman: The hijras of India\". In the book, she wrote that people in India believed that hijras were born as intersex persons and were taken away by the hijra community at birth or in childhood. However, she found no proof for this belief among the hijras whom she met. They had all joined the group on their own whenthey were teenagers. Sangam literature uses the word \"pedi\" for people who are born intersex. Other groups in India call intersex people as \"mabedi usili\" and give them special names.\nControl over one's body.\nIntersex persons are not protected from attacks on to their bodies.\nCases where small intersex children have been killed have been reported. Medical reports say that parents in India usually think of small intersex children to be male. Parents choose to have surgery done on children if they can pay for it.\nThe Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, India, answered a letter from an activist for intersex rights, Gopi Shankar Madurai. In the answer, they wrote that any surgery, even operations to change sex, are done only after testing the patient completely, designing a proper treatment asking the patient/guardian\".\nIndian passports are available with an \"O\" option (for \"Other\") to name one's sex, apart from Male and Female options.\nOn 22 April 2019, the Madras High Court made an important judgement. The judgement said that transgender women were allowed to marry. The judgement ordered the state of Tamil Nadu to ban surgeries on small intersex children based on their sex. The court looked at the works of intersex activist Gopi Shankar. The Court found out that compulsory treatments were often done on intersex children. The court also gave examples from Hindu mythology in its judgement, like the story of Iravan.\nProtection from unfair treatment.\nMany Indian sports-persons have been shamed and treated unfairly after their sex was checked. They have also lost work and their medals. Santhi Soundarajan was a runner who won the silver medal in the 800 metres race at the 2006 Asian Games in Doha, Qatar. Her medal was taken away from her and she tried to kill herself later. Another runner, Pinki Pramanik, was blamed by a female roommate of rape. She was later tested and named male, though she and other medical experts do not agree. Yet another Indian runner, Dutee Chand, won a case against the IAAF in 2015. This case helped women runners with more testosterone in their bodies to participate as women because there is no clear proof that testosterone benefits performance. In 2016, some sports doctors said that runners born with a problem of sex development who were raised as females should be allowed to participate as women.\nIntersex people in Indian politics.\nGopi Shankar Madurai was one of the youngest candidate to run in an Indian election. He was also the first openly intersex and genderqueer candidate. He ran for a seat in the 2016 Tamil Nadu elections.\nWhat people think.\nWhat people think about LGBT rights in India is difficult to answer. According to a 2016 poll by the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, 35% of Indian people wanted to make same-sex marriage legal. 35% id not want same-sex marriage to be legal. A survey by the Varkey Foundation found that 18-21 year olds supported same-sex marriage more than others.\nAccording to a 2017 poll carried out by ILGA, 58% of Indians agreed that gay, lesbian and bisexual people should have the same rights as straight people. 30% Indians disagreed. Additionally, 59% agreed that they should be protected from unfair treatment at the workplace. But 39% of Indians said that people who are in same-sex relationships should be considered criminals (44% people disagreed with this). 66% people agreed that transgender people should have the same rights as others, 62% believed they should be protected from unfair treatment at work and 60% believed they should be allowed to change their gender before law.\nTop government institutes, such as IITs, accept LGBT people more. According to a poll conducted at IIT Delhi in 2015, 72% of respondents agreed that \"being homosexual is normal as being heterosexual\". Many IITs have their own LGBT clubs, like \"Saathi\" (English: Friend) at IIT Bombay, \"\" at IIT Delhi, \"Ambar\" at IIT Kharagpur, \"Unmukt\" at IIT Kanpur and more.\nAccording to a 2019 survey, the Indian states/union territories which accepted the LGBT community most were Uttar Pradesh (36%), followed by Tamil Nadu (30%) and Delhi (30%). The states which showed accepted same-sex relationships least were Mizoram (87%), followed by Nagaland (63%), Jammu and Kashmir (63%) and Kerala (58%). The states with the most undecided respondents were West Bengal (60%), followed by Assam (40%), Punjab (39%) and Tripura (37%). The Hindu community accepted same-sex relationships the most. Christian respondents opposed same sex-relationships most(70%), followed by Muslims (50%) and both Hindus and Sikhs at 40%."}

This is different from being extinct across the world (global extinction) because these species still exist outside of that area. Sometimes when this happens, it can have a very large effect on how the ecosystem works. This might be because that species was important in the food web. The species disappearing might cause more species to go locally extinct or the balance of biomass to change.\nThere have been many cases when species have been added back, or reintroduced, to that area after going locally extinct. If a species is reintroduced after a long amount of time, this might mean there will be larger effects on the ecology of that area. An example of a species being reintroduced are grey wolves in Yellowstone National Park."}

It was the 2003 runner-up, and the 2005 winner, of the \"best game or quiz show on Asian television\" award.\nIn the original format, a contestant was shown 10 faces.

Originally, the game ended on a wrong answer, resulting in a few instances where a contestant won without playing a single face, so it was changed to so that the game ended when one contestant gave a wrong answer and the other gave a correct answer on their respective turns. The jackpot round was similar to the Tag Team format, with a keyword being given along with each piece.\nThotsakan Chamlaeng Game (\u0e17\u0e28\u0e01\u0e31\u0e13\u0e10\u0e4c\u0e0a\u0e48\u0e27\u0e22\u0e04\u0e23\u0e39\u0e43\u0e15\u0e49, Help Southern Teachers).\nBetween May 2007 and February 2008, celebrities answered questions about various people and things to earn money for charity, to help teachers in the South of Thailand.\nThotsakan Yok Siam (\u0e17\u0e28\u0e01\u0e31\u0e13\u0e10\u0e4c\u0e22\u0e01\u0e2a\u0e22\u0e32\u0e21, All of Siam).\nThe current format began in late February 2008, where teams representing each province of Thailand answer questions about various aspects of the culture of Thailand in a knockout competition. The eventual winner will receive 10 million baht. A name change in April saw the Tod Sa Gun being dropped from the show's title because the questions generally no longer involve displaying a picture of someone's face.\nThotsakan Kids Game (\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e17\u0e28\u0e01\u0e31\u0e13\u0e10\u0e4c\u0e40\u0e14\u0e47\u0e01, Kids Edition).\nChildren play on their own rather than against each other. They have to match the correct face with a given name. The player will receive a scholarship worth up to one million baht. The game will go on until a wrong answer is given.\nA later format change, perhaps due to the controversy (see below), saw teams of three different ages, and then single players, playing for charity in a similar format to the Southern Teachers version, before the kids' edition was discontinued altogether in June 2008, which, combined with the renaming of Yok Siam (above), meant an end to the Tod Sa Gun name after just over 5 years.\nControversy.\nWhile the show is popular, it has faced accusations that the programme is rigged. Internet webboard posters, such as in Pantip.com, have alleged that the game is set up to make more appealing players win (like in the 1950s American quiz show scandals.) The allegation first started after a woman had scored almost 50 consecutive wins. In 2006, the accusation started again after a young boy had 200 wins in the kids edition. It was noted that Phanya Nirunkul, the show's host and Workpoint's owner, gave a lot of support to the child. For example, Phanya gave the boy a green suit of his own (at the time, the host wore a green suit). There was a pocketbook written about the boy's success in the game published by Phanya's company, even before he had reached his 200 wins. After the boy was done with the quiz show, he became a co-host of a variety show under Workpoint. All in all, it look like a big setup to promote an unknown boy to fame and reap a long-term rating from his popularity. A young girl has also had 200 consecutive wins in the kids edition, and the allegation has started flying around internet webboards once again.\nFan Pan Tae, another Workpoint's quiz show by Phanya, is also criticized about inaccuracy. A more serious allegation includes the show gives unfair advantages to famous competitors over unknown ones."}

It is manufactured in Thailand by the Singha Corporation Co. Ltd.. Singha corp is a subsidiary of its parent company, Boon Rawd Brewery.\nHistory.\nPraya Bhirom Bhakdi received a license to brew beer from the Thai government. In May 1933, construction of a brewery began. Boon Rawd Brewery was founded on 4 August 1933. In March 1934, production was started. Three beers were brewed: Golden Kite, Singha, and Stupa.\nA royal warrant was bestowed on 25 October 1939. Boon Rawd is the only brewery permitted to display the royal Garuda. The Singha is a powerful mythological lion, found in ancient South Asian and Thai mythology.\nBoon Rawd bought two German breweries at Hartmannsdorf and Mittweida, Saxony in 1994. Some Singha beer is brewed in Germany by Schlossbrauerei Au-Hallertau under licence from Singha Corporation Co., Ltd..\nBeginning in September 2007, a 5.0% (abv) version of Singha replaced the 6.0% (abv) original. This new version, while still brewed in Thailand by Pathum Thani Brewery Co. Ltd., states on its label to have been brewed under the supervision of Singha Corporation Co. Ltd., instead of Boon Rawd.\nFrom 2013, some Singha beer has reportedly been produced at Carlsberg's Russian plant for distribution in some markets. Singha is also said to use eight Carlsberg plants in Asia for production, as part of an agreement to share each other's production facilities and markets.\nGovernance.\nSingha Corporation, established in 2001, is a subsidiary of Boon Rawd Brewery, tasked with managing of all of Boon Rawd's 150-plus subsidiary companies. It reports directly to Boon Rawd's Board of Directors.\nProducts.\nBesides Singha beer, the company manufactures Singha Light, Leo beer, U Beer, bottled and soda water, and packaged foods. \nOperations.\nIn 2017, Singha Corporation sold 1.32 billion litres of Singha, Leo, and U Beer and retained a 62 percent market share in Thailand.

It may be because the person is at an unknown location or has escaped justice, for example after paying bail and then refused to return to the court on the date set anyway, or because the person may not be even alive (a famous case is Martin Bormann, who most likely died in May 1945 and was sentenced to death in November 1946, as part of the Nuremberg Trials). It is controversial, especially if a person is convicted and sentenced to a hard punishment, because the basic premise of a trial is thus violated, and everyone has a right to defend oneself. Others point out, however, that this right is waived when one doesn't show up without a good reason and that the court must make its best, through appointing a defender for instance, to determine guilt or innocence even if the person is not present. Most defendants make their case through a defender anyway, especially when the crime is serious. \nAnother case is when a court or committee must determine whether a person, such as a suspected terrorist, is going to be surveilled or wire-tapped, and whether there is enough suspicion of criminal activity or intent to do so. In that case, the person himself can of course not be asked to appear, as the idea is to hold the surveillance secret. In that case, a defender is appointed to make the case that the suspected person does not want to and does not deserve to be subjected to surveillance and that it should not be permitted, although he/she doesn't know of the proceedings. Most of such hearings, however, are not a trial in the technical sense of the term, though they may involve a judge and lawyer and so on."}

He built a bomb and sent it to a factory owner in Stockholm called Karl Fredrik Lundin. The bomb exploded but nobody was seriously injured. He sent a total of four bombs until 1907 before he was discovered. \nLetter bomb sendouts.\nThere had been many injuries caused by letter bombs. A very famous letter bombmaker is Ted Kaczynski, the so-called \"Unabomber\", who sent a series of letter bombs between 1978 and 1995, killing three people (all men) and injuring 23. One package, however, exploded onboard an airplane, which could have killed all the passengers and personnel, but it only caused an emergency landing. He stopped sending bombs after the New York Times\u00a0accepted to publish a text he had written called \"Industrial Society and its Future\". \nUnfortunately for him, his brother recognised the writing style and alerted the police, which ultimately captured Kaczynski and he was sentenced to life imprisonment. The bombs were very well made and had no evidence from the sender, but typically of letter bombs, they are too small to case significant damage, and in most cases did not even kill the person who opened the package (this was also the case with Ekenberg, who failed to kill a single person). For this reason, and because most important government departments X-rays packages, the method is not very efficient. \nAnother \nGovernment agencies.\nSeveral government agencies have used letter bombs to target persons outside their jurisdiction. One victim of a letter bomb was German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, who was sent a letter bomb by the so-called Stern gang and Israeli politician (and later Prime Minister) Menachem Begin in the 1950s. \nBegin's reasons, as he explained, was that Adenauer and all Germans were responsible for the deaths of millions of Jews during the Holocaust, although Adenauer had been imprisoned by the Nazi regime which committed these crimes. The same group also sent several bombs to US President Harry S. Truman. The South African apartheid\u00a0regime used letter bombs, including to activist Ruth First, who died when opening one in 1982."}

It was organised in 1941 to collect French Jews and particularly foreign Jews who had escaped to France before the invasion by the Germans. After that, they were put on railroad carts and sent east, to concentration camps, from which most did not return alive. Nearly 70,000 people were rounded up, including resistance fighters, Roma people, and others considered \"undesirable\". Until 1943, the camp was administered by French police under German supervision. After this, the French were removed and replaced by German\u00a0SS men led by Alois Brunner, which increased the efficiency of the deportations. \nWhen the camp was liberated in 1944, about 1,500 people remained.

{"id": "750927", "revid": "1128114", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=750927", "title": "History of the Jews in Europe", "text": "Jews have lived in Europe for thousands of years, and their dispersal and relations with governing authorities and peoples have changed greatly. Originally, in the Roman Republic and Roman Empire, there was a Jewish minority which had varying rights and relations with the Romans. After the Roman-Jewish wars in the first and second centuries and the destruction of the Temple, Jews were expelled from Palestine, which greatly increased their numbers in Europe (and North Africa and Asia). In the Middle Ages, with the spread of Christianity and Christian anti-Semitism, conditions were generally bad, and Jews were forbidden from integrating (mingling) with Christians, working most jobs and were often secluded to particular parts of cities, called ghettos. They were allowed to do certain jobs that Christians were not allowed to, such as lending money to people for interest, which was a necessary part of modern economies but considered foul or bad for Christians. This made several Jews wealthy but also increased resistance and persecutions. \nJews were eventually welcomed in Poland, whose king declared the Statute of Kalisz to protect them. For example, Christians could not testify against Jews for committing crimes, which commonly had led to unjust accusations and punishments. For many Christians, however, this protection increased their resistance. Many Jews, so-called \"Ashkenazim\", gathered in Eastern Europe because of this, however. In Spainand Portugal under Muslim rule, the so-called Al Andalus period, Jews were generally accepted although they could not take part in the government. After Christian rule was re-established on the Iberian peninsula, Jews were rejected and persecuted if they stayed. Some sought refuge in the Ottoman Empire, which was then relatively tolerant to Jews and Christians and allowed them to have their own courts and laws, as long as they payed taxes and did not resist Ottoman rule. \nAfter the Renaissance and the Early Modern Period, Jews were integrated increasingly and permitted to live openly as Jews in more and more countries. After the French Revolution, France and other European countries affected by French rule through Napoleon I introduced secular laws aimed at abolishing religion in the public sphere and assimilating Jews, i.e. treating them more openly as citizens and members of the public, who could believe whatever they wanted privately and still be members of the community. Other Jews began to discard their religion too, or integrated willingly into the larger community, such as by becoming Christians, like British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli's father, Isaac d'Israeli. Many European countries had restrictions on Jews until the 19th and 20th centuries, however, such as banning them from certain professions or holding public offices. Many Jews became prominent scientists or public intellectuals, however, such as Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud and Albert Einstein. Only one hundred years before, this would have been impossible. \nWith the modern time and the gradual establishment of republics and constitutional monarchies across Europe, conditions were considered much better for Jews. Some preferred to emigrate to the United States and other American countries, however, including Argentina, which to this day has a large Jewish community. Eventually, the United States gathered the largest Jewish population outside of the Russian Empire. After Poland became an independent country again after the Treaty of Versailles, it had the largest Jewish population in Europe, of about 3,000,000 Jews. The Soviet Union, which came about in 1922, had nearly as many. With Adolf Hitler's rise to power in Germany, there was again increased emigration, to the Western European countries and to the United States, supported by the Germans who did not want Jews in German-governed territory. More Jews emigrated to Palestine, which had been taken from the Ottoman Turks by the United Kingdom in 1917, to establish a Jewish homeland for Jews. Hitler temporarily supported this migration, but the British were sceptic, as the greater number of Jews meant conflicts with the local Arabs, who resisted Jewish immigration, and several bloody rebellions were fought between them and the British troops in the region. With World War II, the Nazi-controlled German armies occupied most of Europe and started to deport Jews east, eventually adopting a policy of mass murder known as the Holocaust. After 1942, all Jews under German control (with very few exceptions) would be sent to Eastern Europe and killed or worked to death. In the end, before Nazi Germany's defeat in 1945, this killed about two thirds of the Jewish population in Europe. Only the Jewish communities of Albania, Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal, Britain and Ireland were untouched, and those of Italy, Yugoslavia and Romania much less affected. Many remaining Jews migrated to the United States and Palestine, where Israel was created in 1948 as a Jewish-majority state, which resulted in Europe losing most of its Jewish population and the United States becoming the most Jewish country. Also, later persecution in Communist Poland and other countries led to more refugees. Of the 3,000,000 Jews in Poland, less than 3,000 remain today. In France, the United Kingdom and Russia, however, there are significant communities left comparable to before the war."}

As the name suggests, these masks are made of textiles. Cotton is commonly used. Starting with the 19th century, such masks have been used by healthcare professionals. They are also used to protect against air pollution, although they may not be very effective in protecting against air pollution. \nDepending on the design, they can be effective stopping the transmission of disease spread by droplets of liquid. Today, healthcare professionals often use surgical masks or respirators, which offer better protection. A study done in 2010 found that 40 to 90 percent of particles pass through a cloth facemask.\nCloth face masks are commonly used during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially when surgical and other medical face coverings are not available."}
{"id": "751092", "revid": "1011873", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=751092", "title": "George Bass", "text": "George Bass (30 January 1771 \u2013 after 5 February 1803) was a British naval surgeon and explorer of Australia.\nEarly years.\nBass was born on 30 January 1771 at Aswarby, near Sleaford, Lincolnshire. His father, George, was a tenant farmer, George Bass, and his mother a local beauty named Sarah (n\u00e9e Newman). His father died in 1777. He went to Boston Grammar School and later studied medicine at the hospital in Boston, Lincolnshire. At the age of 18, he was accepted in London as a member of the Company of Surgeons, and in 1794 he joined the Royal Navy as a surgeon.\nHe arrived in Sydney in New South Wales on HMS \"Reliance\" on 7 September 1795.\nAlso on the voyage were Matthew Flinders, John Hunter, Bennelong, and his surgeon's assistant William Martin.\nThe voyages of the Tom Thumb and Tom Thumb II.\nBass brought a small boat to Australia. It had an keel and beam, which he called the Tom Thumb on account of its size. In October 1795 Bass and Flinders, accompanied by William Martin sailed to Botany Bay and explored the Georges River. Their reports on their return led to the settlement of Banks' Town.\nIn March 1796 they went on a second voyage in a larger small boat, which they called the Tom Thumb II. They travelled down the coast to Lake Illawarra, which they called Tom Thumb Lagoon. They explored Port Hacking.\nLater in 1796 Bass discovered good farming land near Prospect Hill, found cattle which had been lost since 1788, and tried to cross the Blue Mountains.\nWhaleboat voyage to Western Port.\nIn 1797 Bass and six crew sailed an open whaleboat to Cape Howe, the farthest point of south-eastern Australia. From here they kept going went west as far as Western Port. He believed that Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania) was not joined to mainland Australia. Watching the tides and the long south-western swell at Wilson's Promontory convinced him that his idea was right.\nBass visited the Kiama area on the south coast of New South Wales. He made notes on the many plants and the amazing natural phenomenon, the Kiama Blowhole.\nCircumnavigation of Tasmania in the \"Norfolk\".\nIn 1798, Bass and Flinders, sailed the \"Norfolk\", around Van Diemen's Land, proving that it was an island. They visited the estuary of the Derwent River, found and named by Captain John Hayes in 1793. Bass made a report which led to it being chosen for the future city of Hobart in 1803. When they got back to Sydney, Flinders recommended to Governor John Hunter that the passage between Van Diemen's Land and the mainland be called Bass Strait.\n\"This was no more than a just tribute to my worthy friend and companion,\" Flinders wrote, \"for the extreme dangers and fatigues he had undergone, in first entering it in a whaleboat, and to the correct judgement he had formed, from various indications, of the existence of a wide opening between Van Diemen's Land and New South Wales.\"\nBass sent some of his botanical discoveries to Sir Joseph Banks in London. \"In this voyage of fourteen weeks I collected those few plants upon Van Diemen's Land which had not been familiar to me in New South Wales,\" he wrote to Banks, \"and have done myself the honour of submitting them to your inspection.\" He was made an honorary member of the Society for Promoting Natural History, which later became the Linnean Society. Some of his reports were published in the second volume of David Collins's \"An Account of the English colony in New South Wales.\" He was one of the first to describe the Australian marsupial, the wombat.\nMarriage and trading.\nOn 8 October 1800, George married Elizabeth Waterhouse at St James's Church, Westminster. She was the sister of Henry Waterhouse, Bass's former shipmate, and captain of the \"Reliance\". In January 1801 Bass set sail again for Australia, leaving Elizabeth behind. The couple wrote to each other, they did not meet again, as Bass never returned from this journey. \nBass and a group of friends had invested some \u00a310,000 in the copper-sheathed brig , and a cargo of general goods to sell in Port Jackson. \nOn the voyage, the ship passed through Bass Strait. He recorded it simply as Bass Strait, like any other geographical feature. His modesty meant he felt no need to say \"discovered by me\" or \"named after me\".\nOn arrival Bass that others had brought out goods as well, and he was unable to sell his cargo. Governor King was trying to save money and would buy the cargo, even at a 50% discount. King did ask Bass to get salt pork from Tahiti. Food was scarce in Sydney at that time and prices were high, yet there were plenty of pigs in the Society Islands. King said he would pay Bass six pence a pound, half the current price in Sydney. This deal suited both men. With his partner Charles Bishop, Bass sailed from Sydney in the \"Venus\" for Dusky Sound in New Zealand. They spent 14 days taking iron from the wreck of Captain Brampton's old ship the \"Endeavour\". This was made into axes which were used to trade for the pork in Tahiti. They returned to Sydney in November 1802.\nIn January 1803 Bass asked King for the rights to all the fish along the South Island of New Zealand, from Dusky Sound to Otago Harbour \u2013 now the site of the city of Dunedin. He also wanted to include all the lands and seas to the south, notably the Antipodes Islands. His brother-in-law, Waterhouse, had discovered the islands, and probably told him about the excellent prospects for fishing. \nFinal voyage.\nBass set sail on his last voyage in the \"Venus\" on 5 February 1803, but he and his crew were never seen again. His plan was to go to Tahiti and perhaps on to the Spanish colonies on the coast of Chile to buy provisions and bring them back to Sydney.\nBass may also have planned to smuggle goods into Chile. Spain would only allow Spanish ships and merchants to bring goods into the country. But the colonists in Chile needed more than they could supply and shortages and heavy taxation caused high prices. This made smuggling profitable. Port Jackson was described by some 19th-century historians as a base for such smuggling Britain's strained relationship with Spain at that time meant British authorities were unconcerned.\nBass still had much of the general cargo he had brought to Sydney in 1801 and he may well have been tempted to try and sell it in Chile. Two of his last letters have hints at a venture which he could not name. He set off in 1803, with a diplomatic letter from Governor King attesting his bona-fides and that his sole purpose if he were on the West coast of South America would be in procuring provisions.\nHe was never heard from again, and Governor King and Bass's friends in Sydney were forced to accept that he had met some misfortune. In England in January 1806 Bass was listed by the Admiralty as lost at sea. His wife Elizabeth was given money from the widows' fund, back dated to when Bass's half-pay had ended in June 1803. Bass had made the usual contributions to the fund from his salary.\nPossibilities.\nThere are many ideas about what may have happened to Bass. One story, by William Campbell of the brig \"Harrington\", said that Bass was captured by the Spanish in Chile and sent to the silver mines. The \"Harrington\" was also involved in smuggling and returned to Sydney some three months after Bass's departure. But this story dates from 1811 in a report by William Fitzmaurice. Campbell did not mention Bass in either 1803, or in 1805 when he captured a Spanish ship. Three months is too short for Bass to have reached Chile and then the \"Harrington\" to get back to Sydney.\nAlso all British prisoners held by the Spanish in Chile and Peru were freed in 1808 and returned to Europe. If the crew of the \"Venus\" had been captured then none of the 25 survived.\nAdventurer Jorgen Jorgenson wrote about Bass in 1835. He said Bass had attempted forced trade at gunpoint in Chile, and was captured when he let his guard down. Jorgenson probably met Bass, but this story is almost certainly not true. Jorgenson's writing, though entertaining, was often far from factual.\nA search of Spanish archives in 1903 by scholar Pascual de Gayangos and a search of Peruvian archives in 2003 by historian Jorge Ortiz-Sotelo found no mention of Bass. His ultimate fate remains a mystery.\nRecognition.\nIn 1963 Bass was honoured on a postage stamp issued by Australia Post, and again in 1998 with Matthew Flinders.\nA re-enactment of the whaleboat voyage was made on the 200th anniversary of Bass's voyage. It arrived at Western Port on 5 January 1998, using a \"Elizabeth\" skippered by Bern Cuthbertson. \nThe following places were named after Bass:"}

The forces of the British East India Company fought against Nepal, then ruled by the House of Gorkha. The battle took place around the Nalapani fort, near Dehradun. The British besieged the fort between 31 October and 30 November 1814. The fort's garrison was commanded by Captain Balbhadra Kunwar. Major-General Rollo Gillespie, who had previously fought in the Battle of Java, was in charge of the attacking British troops. Gillespie was killed on the first day of the siege while rallying his men and despite considerable odds, both in terms of numbers and firepower, Balbhadra and his 600-strong garrison successfully held out against more than 5,000 British troops for over a month.\nFirst two costly attempts to seize the fort by direct attack were unsuccessful. The British then tried to force the garrison to surrender by cutting off the fort's water supply. After three days of thirst, on the last day of the siege, Balbhadra refused to surrender. He led the 70 surviving members of the garrison in a charge against the besieging force. Fighting their way out of the fort, the survivors escaped into the nearby hills. Considering the time, effort, and resources spent to capture the small fort, it was a pyrrhic victory for the British. A number of later engagements, including one at Jaithak, unfolded in a similar way; but more than any other battle of the war, the fighting around Nalapani established the Gurkhas' reputation as warriors. As a result, they were later recruited by the British to serve in their army."}

It is intended to be worn by health professionals during surgery and during nursing. Such masks are used to catch the bacteria shed in liquid droplets and aerosols from the wearer's mouth and nose. They are not designed to protect the wearer from inhaling airborne bacteria or virus particles and are less effective than respirators, which provide better protection.\nThere are different qualities of such mask. Despite their name, not all surgical masks should be used during surgeries. Chinese health officials distinguish between medical (non-surgical) and surgical masks.\nSurgical masks are made of a nonwoven fabric created using a melt blowing process. They came into use in the 1960s and largely replaced cloth facemasks in developed countries. A shortage of surgical masks is a central issue of the ongoing 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic.\nSurgical masks are popularly worn by the general public all year round in East Asian countries like China, Japan and South Korea to reduce the chance of spreading airborne diseases to others, and to prevent the breathing in of airborne dust particles created by air pollution. Additionally, surgical masks have become a fashion statement, particularly in contemporary East Asian culture bolstered by its popularity in Japanese and Korean pop culture which have a big impact on East Asian youth culture."}

It was the third and final DreamWorks Animation movie co-produced with Aardman Animations following \"Chicken Run\" (2000) and \"\" (2005), and was the first Aardman project completely made in computer animation as opposed to their usual stop motion standard. The movie stars the voices of Hugh Jackman, Kate Winslet, Andy Serkis, Bill Nighy, Ian McKellen, Shane Richie and Michael Richards. In \"Flushed Away\", a pet rat named Roddy St. James is flushed down the toilet by a sewer mouse, and befriends a scavenger named Rita in order to return home while evading a power-hungry toad and his rat henchmen.\nThe movie was released in the United States by Paramount Pictures on 3 November 2006, and in the United Kingdom on 1 December 2006. Despite receiving positive reviews, \"Flushed Away\" underperformed at the box office, prompting DreamWorks to end their partnership with Aardman. The film received nominations for the BAFTA Award and Critics' Choice Award for Best Animated Feature. It also got 8 nominations at the 34th Annie Awards, winning a leading 5, including Writing in a Feature Production, and Voice Acting in a Feature Production."}

They often try to bring attention to the importance of immigration to Canada.\nRecent years.\nCanadians use the word \"multiculturalism\" in many different ways. Sometimes they use it to describe the many different religious traditions and cultural influences. They say that this creates a very special cultural mosaic of Canada. The country is full of people that come from many different racial, religious, and cultural origins. Since Canada was created, there has been a lot of immigration. By the beginning of the 21st century, there were more people that were not of a British or French background.\nIn Canada there are many examples of multiculturalism. for example, Canada lets in refugees, immigrants, and do not care about any race, religion, or culture.

{"id": "751562", "revid": "2133", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=751562", "title": "SP-network", "text": "In cryptography, an SP-network, or substitution\u2013permutation network (SPN), is a series of linked mathematical operations used in block cipher algorithms such as AES (Rijndael), 3-Way, Kalyna, Kuznyechik, PRESENT, SAFER, SHARK, and Square.\nSuch a network takes a block of the plaintext and the key as inputs, and applies several alternating \"rounds\" or \"layers\" of substitution boxes (S-boxes) and permutation boxes (P-boxes) to produce the ciphertext block. The S-boxes and P-boxes transform (sub-)blocks of input bits into output bits. It is common for these transformations to be operations that are efficient to perform in hardware, such as exclusive or (XOR) and bitwise rotation. The key is introduced in each round, usually in the form of \"round keys\" derived from it. (In some designs, the S-boxes themselves depend on the key.)\nDecryption is done by simply reversing the process (using the inverses of the S-boxes and P-boxes and applying the round keys in reversed order).\nAn S-box substitutes a small block of bits (the input of the S-box) by another block of bits (the output of the S-box). This substitution should be one-to-one, to ensure invertibility (hence decryption). In particular, the length of the output should be the same as the length of the input (the picture on the right has S-boxes with 4 input and 4 output bits), which is different from S-boxes in general that could also change the length, as in DES (Data Encryption Standard), for example. An S-box is usually not simply a permutation of the bits. Rather, a good S-box will have the property that changing one input bit will change about half of the output bits (or an avalanche effect). It will also have the property that each output bit will depend on every input bit.\nA P-box is a permutation of all the bits: it takes the outputs of all the S-boxes of one round, permutes the bits, and feeds them into the S-boxes of the next round. A good P-box has the property that the output bits of any S-box are distributed to as many S-box inputs as possible.\nAt each round, the round key (obtained from the key with some simple operations, for instance, using S-boxes and P-boxes) is combined using some group operation, typically XOR.\nA single typical S-box or a single P-box alone does not have much cryptographic strength: an S-box could be thought of as a substitution cipher, while a P-box could be thought of as a transposition cipher. However, a well-designed SP network with several alternating rounds of S- and P-boxes already satisfies Shannon's confusion and diffusion properties:\nAlthough a Feistel network that uses S-boxes (such as DES) is quite similar to SP networks, there are some differences that make either this or that more applicable in certain situations. For a given amount of confusion and diffusion, an SP network has more \"inherent parallelism\" and so \u2014 given a CPU with many execution units \u2014 can be computed faster than a Feistel network. CPUs with few execution units \u2014 such as most smart cards \u2014 cannot take advantage of this inherent parallelism. Also SP ciphers require S-boxes to be invertible (to perform decryption); Feistel inner functions have no such restriction and can be constructed as one-way functions."}

The winner receives the Maurice Podoloff Trophy, which is named in honor of the first commissioner (then president) of the NBA, who served from 1946 until 1963. Until the 1979\u201380 season, the MVP was selected by a vote of NBA players. Since the 1980\u201381 season, the award is decided by a panel of sportswriters and broadcasters throughout the United States and Canada.\nEach member of the voting panel casts a vote for first to fifth place selections. Each first-place vote is worth 10 points; each second-place vote is worth seven; each third-place vote is worth five, fourth-place is worth three and fifth-place is worth one. Starting from 2010, one ballot was cast by fans through online voting. The player with the highest point total wins the award. As of June 2019, the current holder of the award is Giannis Antetokounmpo of the Milwaukee Bucks.\nEvery player who has won this award and has been eligible for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame has been inducted. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won the award a record six times. He is also the only player to win the award despite his team not making the playoffs back in the 1975\u201376 season. Both Bill Russell and Michael Jordan won the award five times, while Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James won the award four times. Russell and James are the only players to have won the award four times in five seasons.Moses Malone, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson each won the award three times, while Bob Pettit, Karl Malone, Tim Duncan, Steve Nash and Stephen Curry have each won it twice. Only two rookies have won the award: Chamberlain in the 1959\u201360 season and Wes Unseld in the 1968\u201369 season. Hakeem Olajuwon of Nigeria, Duncan of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Nash of Canada, Dirk Nowitzki of Germany, and Giannis Antetokounmpo of Greece are the only MVP winners considered \"international players\" by the NBA.\nCurry in 2015\u201316 is the only player to have won the award unanimously. Shaquille O'Neal in 1999\u20132000 and James in 2012\u201313 are the only two players to have fallen one vote shy of a unanimous selection, both receiving 120 of 121 votes. Since the 1975\u201376 season, only two players have been named MVP for a season in which their team failed to win at least 50 regular-season games\u2014Moses Malone (twice, 1978\u201379 and 1981\u201382) and Russell Westbrook (2016\u201317)."}

The toys related to the \"Friendship Is Magic\" series are called G4.\nStarting with the G1 series, each toy pony, unicorn or pegasus (winged horse) came in bright colors for example pink and blue, and a \"cutie mark,\" or symbol on its rear end. The symbol usually had something to do with its name and personality. For example, the pegasus pony named Firefly had blue lightning bolts for her cutie mark. Fireflies are also called lightning bugs.\nFirst cartoons.\nIn 1986, Hasbro made a cartoon for television called \"My Little Pony n' Friends\" to sell My Little Ponies and other toys.

It is also known as common ferret, black or forest polecat, foumart, or fitch. It is dark brown, with a pale underbelly and a dark mask across the face. Occasionally, there are other color variations, such as albinos. The family it is in also contains minks and other weasels. Compared to them, the polecat has a shorter, more compact body; a more powerfully built skull and teeth; and is less agile. It is well known for its ability to secrete a particularly foul-smelling liquid to mark its territory.\nIt is much less territorial than other mustelid. Animals of the same sex frequently share home ranges. Like other mustelids, the European polecat is polygamous, with pregnancy occurring after mating, with no induced ovulation. It usually gives birth in early summer to litters consisting of five to ten kits, which become independent at the age of two to three months. The European polecat feeds on small rodents, birds, amphibians and reptiles. It occasionally cripples its prey by piercing its brain with its teeth and stores it, still living, in its burrow for future consumption.\nThe European polecat originated in Western Europe during the Middle Pleistocene. its closest living relatives are the steppe polecat, the black-footed ferret and the European mink. It can produce fertile offspring with the steppe polecat and the black-footed ferret. Hybrids of polecat and mink tend to be sterile, and are distinguished from their parent species by their larger size and more valuable pelts.\nThe European polecat is the only ancestor of the ferret, which was domesticated more than 2000 years ago for hunting vermin. The species has otherwise been historically viewed negatively by humans. In the British Isles especially, the polecat was persecuted by gamekeepers, and became synonymous with promiscuity in early English literature. During modern times, the polecat is still scantly represented in popular culture when compared to other rare British mammals, and misunderstandings of its behaviour still persist in some rural areas. , it is classed by the IUCN as Least Concern due to its wide range and large numbers.\nLatin name.\nAs well as the several indigenous names referring to smell (see above), the scientific name \"Mustela putorius\" is also derived from this species' foul smell. The Latin \"putorius\" translates to \"stench\" or \"stink\" and is the origin of the English word \"putrid\"."}

He killed twenty-two people and injured three others before the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) shot and killed him in Enfield.\nThe attack lasted for thirteen hours. Wortman impersonated a police officer for part of the attack by driving a car he had made to look like a police car and wearing a police uniform. The killings were not terrorism, but police do not yet know the reason Wortman did these killings. He had guns even though he didn't have a licence, so police are trying to find out how he got the guns.\nPolice did not use Canada's Alert Ready system, which could have sent messages to the phones of people in the area of Wortman to stay inside. Many people think they should have used it, and police are trying to find out why it wasn't used. \nIt is the deadliest attack of its kind in Canadian history.\nAttacks.\nApril 18.\nThe attack began as domestic violence between Wortman and his girlfriend in their home in Portapique, Nova Scotia, which is north of Halifax. They had came home from a party and were arguing. Wortman attacked her and she ran away into the woods. Wortman then set fire to his house and went back to the party. He began shooting at the people there and killed seven.\nMany calls to the police were made about more shootings and fires outside of eight homes in Portapique from 10:14p.m. RMCP officers arrived twelve minutes later at 10:26P.M. and found that thirteen more people had been shot dead by Wortman and three houses had been set on fire. Police said many had died while trying to escape the flames or help other victims. By the time they had got there, Wortman had already escaped. Another man said he had been shot and injured by a man driving a police car.\nPolice quickly realised that Wortman had probably committed the crimes and started a search of Portapique for him. RMCP made a tweet telling the people in the town to stay inside and lock their doors.\nApril 19.\nPolice found Wortman's girlfriend at 6:30a.m. and she told them that Wortman had a fake police car and gave them a photo of it. A BOLO was sent out to all police officers in Nova Scotia telling them to look for a fake police car. Police then announced there was an active shooter situation.\nAt around 8:00a.m., a 9-1-1 caller reported an explosion and gunfire at a house in Wentworth, Nova Scotia, about north of Portapique. The two residents of the house and a neighbour were killed. Wortman went to another house in police uniform but the people wouldn't let him in and called the police, so Wortman left. At 9:35a.m., he shot and killed a woman who was walking in Wentworth Valley. He then went south back towards Portapique.\nFrom 10:54a.m., Wortman was seen in Glenholme, Debert, Onslow, and Brookfield, in that order. This would show him heading towards Halifax. In this time, he performed two traffic stops pretending to be a police officer and shot and killed both drivers.\nSometime before 10:49a.m., Wortman stopped next to a police officer's car in Shubenacadie, Nova Scotia and shot him. This injured the officer and he drove to a hospital and survived. He then continued down the road and crashed head on into another police officer's car who was driving. The female officer began shooting at Wortman, but was killed by him. He stole her gun and ammunition and set her car on fire. He then shot and killed someone who tried to help the officer before stealing his silver Chervrolet Tracker car and driving south.\nA short time later, he killed a woman he knew in her home in Shubenacadie and stole her Mazda 3 car. He was later seen driving south through Milford, near Halifax.\nAt 11:26a.m., Wortman drove into a rest area near Enfield, Nova Scotia., south of Portapique and north of Halifax. A police officer saw him and knew who he was and shot Wortman dead.\nIn total, Wortman had murdered 22 people and injured 3 others.\nPerpetrator.\nThe perpetrator of the attacks was 51-year-old Gabriel Wortman, who was a denturist who lived in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. He had been arrested for assault before in 2001, but was given 9 months of probation."}

It is found in the Atlantic Oceans and the Caribbean Sea, from the surface to depths of . It does not occur in large areas of the central North Atlantic and the central South Atlantic. The Atlantic sailfish is related to the marlin.\nTests in the 1920s estimated that the Atlantic sailfish was capable of short sprints of up to 111 kilometres per hour; however, more conservative estimates of 37 to 55 kilometres per hour are more widely accepted. More recent studies even suggest sailfish do not exceed swimming speeds of .\nAtlantic sailfish hunt schooling fish, such as sardines, anchovies and mackerel although they also feed on crustaceans and cephalopods.\nDescription.\nThe Atlantic sailfish is a metallic blue fish with a large sail-like dorsal fin and a long and pointed bill-like snout. It is dark bluish-black on the upperparts and lighter on the sides (counter-shading). There are about twenty bluish horizontal bars along the flanksThe underparts are silvery white. The tail fin is strongly forked. The fins are bluish-black and the front dorsal fin is speckled with small black spots. The bases of the anal fins are pale.\nThe length of this fish is up to and the maximum published weight is .\nStudies found that sailfish hunting schools of sardines rely heavily upon stealth and quick slashing or tapping with the rostrum in order to temporarily immobilize prey and make capturing small prey easier. The bill has been hypothesized to increase the hydrodynamic qualities of the fish and even to ward off predators. However, it has been well documented that the sailfish use the bill for hunting.\nDistribution and habitat.\nThe Atlantic sailfish is a pelagic fish of tropical and temperate waters in the Atlantic Ocean. It ranges from approximately 40\u00b0N in the northwestern Atlantic to 40\u00b0S in the southwestern Atlantic, and 50\u00b0N in the northeastern Atlantic to 32\u00b0S in the southeastern Atlantic. It is a migratory species and moves about the open ocean and into the Mediterranean Sea. Its depth range is from warm surface waters down to about .\nTaxonomy.\nSome authorities only recognise a single species of sailfish, \"Istiophorus platypterus\", with \"I. albicans\" being treated as a synonym for \"I. platyperus\"."}

The episode was dedicated to Max von Sydow who died on March 8, 2020.

Bart takes the grenade to school and pranks them, causing everyone to run away. Ned Flanders throws himself on the grenade as a sacrifice and to save everyone. Superintendent Chalmers is going to suspend Bart from school, but Ned wants to take care of him with his three P's: persistence, prayer, and persistent prayer.\nAt the Flanders house, Ned goes to take Bart fishing. When Bart catches a fish, Ned teaches him how to roast it in a fire. Bart also joins a church choir and everyone in the church congratulate Ned for making Bart a better person. This makes Homer jealous.\nHomer walks around the city and finds Nelson Muntz at a landfill crying because of what is going on at his home. Homer brings him to Krusty Burger and says that he will be his mentor, so that he can make Bart jealous. Lisa says that Homer should go to a counselor because he ends up causing problems. The therapist Homer goes to disagrees with what Homer tries. Homer finds Nelson's mother who asks if he will leave Nelson, like a lot of men did in the past. Homer tries to tell Nelson about it, but he gets sad and plans revenge on Bart. \nAt the Christian Pride Parade, Nelson tries to start a praying hands machine in order to crush Bart with the hands. Homer sees Nelson and pushes Bart away, getting crushed by the hands. Homer and Bart ride in the ambulance together. Homer apologizes to Nelson and lets Ned take him as a mentor. \nReception.\nDennis Perkins of \"The A.V. Club\" gave the episode a score of C- and said that \"'Better Off Ned' isn\u2019t just a lousy half-hour (minus commercials, minus three episode-ending tags in place of any sort of resolution) of The Simpsons because it\u2019s double-dipping on the same premise. It\u2019s a truly lousy episode because it fairly rings with indifference, glib cruelty, and enough lamp-shading of creative exhaustion to serve as platonic ideal for late-run \u2018is that show still on?\u2019 disposability.\" \"Den of Geek\" gave the episode a 3 out of 5 stars and says \"'Better Off Ned' is sweet but feels like a doughnut where the creamy middle has been sucked out. It doesn\u2019t quite miss the edge as much as it dulls it. The opportunities are here for sharper comedy, but the episode cuts across the surface.\""}

Almost a million children's and young people have in 57. years participated at Jugend Musiziert. For many of them, this was the first step in a very successful music career.\nJugend musiziert in Germany.\nIn Germany, the nationwide competition includes children and adolescents up to the age of 21, for singing and organ up to the age of 27. It serves the musical location, the comparison with others and the promotion. The participants may not yet be in a musical vocational training (full course) or professional practice. The participants play pieces of music from different eras. The length of the lecture depends on the age group and the requirements in the individual categories and ranges from 10 to 20 minutes. The competition is divided into three phases: First, it is held at regional level, in around 140 regions in Germany and at around 30 German schools in other European countries. Bearer of a \u201c1st Prizes at regional level \u201dare\u201c passed on \u201dto the respective national competition (a German school in Northern, Western and Southern Europe also holds its own national competition) and winner of a\u201c 1. State level \u201dat the appropriate minimum age for the federal competition. The solo and ensemble categories change every three years. The \u201cclassical\u201d orchestral instruments formed the foundation of \u201cJugend musiziert\u201d from the very beginning. In 1970 the piano was added, later drums, plucked instruments and vocal categories. In 2009 the solo category \"Bass (Pop)\" was introduced, followed by \"Guitar (Pop)\" and \"Vocals (Pop)\". The most recent expansion in 2015 was the solo category \"Special Instrument\", with a chopping board and baglamas. It will be offered as an ensemble category for the first time in 2016. In 2015, \u201cJugend musiziert\u201d had more than 20,000 participants nationwide. Around 7,500 of them were forwarded to the state competitions; almost 2,400 first state prize winners took part in the federal competition. The nationwide competition, which was held for the first time in 1964, is sponsored by the German Music Council. Leading associations are: Federal Association of Music Lessons, Federal Association of German Orchestra Associations, German Tonk\u00fcnstlerverband (DTKV), Jeunesses Musicales Deutschland (JMD), Association of German Music Schools (VdM). Jugend musiziert is funded by the Federal Ministry for Family, Seniors, Women and Youth, the local umbrella organizations, the municipalities and as the main sponsor of the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe.\nIn 2020, all state competitions and the federal competition in Freiburg were canceled for the first time in the 57-year history of Jugend musiziert music because of the COVID-19 Virus.\nJugend musiziert in Austria.\nThe Austrian competition was founded in 1969 by F. Knoppek in Leoben as an instrumental and vocal competition for young people from Austria and South Tyrol aged 10\u201321 (for brass instrument players, double bass and bassoon up to 23, for singers aged 16\u201326) . It takes place every two years - since 1975 with preselection in so-called \"state competitions\" in the state capitals and the \"federal competition\" in Leoben. Participants are delegated from all Austrian federal states. The Tyrolean delegation also includes participants from South Tyrol.\nIn the Austrian competition, the number of participants rose from 235 in 1969 to over 2000 from 1989. The representatives of the federal states worked out reform proposals (annual implementation, division into a more funding-oriented basic competition and a top competition based on the professional training standard, inclusion of missing instruments and instrumentation, introduction of a binding \u201ccompulsory piece\u201d from the 20th century, etc.). In 1993 the competition was last held nationwide under the old name. As an alternative, the federal states and the federal ministries concerned with the aspects of youth, school and university as well as music funding founded the organization Musik der Jugend, which organizes the Prima la musica competition.\nIn Leoben itself, the sponsoring association continued to hold smaller competitions under the name \"Jugend musiziert\" it protected in the following years, albeit limited to individual categories and at irregular intervals."}

It was the first popular electric bass to be made and has four strings with one split-coil humbucking pickup. It was also the first bass guitar to have a solid body.\nHistory.\nAcoustic, fretted plucked string instruments have been around for a very long time. One example is the bass lute, which has been around since the 17th century. The berda, which is a Slavic folk instrument, has also been around for hundreds of years. In the 19th century, some bass instruments made like a guitar were created. Gibson made an acoustic \"mando bass\", which was made like a mandolin.\nFirst electric basses.\nMany inventors tried to make electric basses because most bassists were using the double bass, which was very big, heavy, and too quiet. Before the Precision Bass was made, many inventors used the double bass and tried to make it electric. Lloyd Loar was one of the first to try to make them louder. He put a pickup on double bass in order to play it through an amplifier. He did this between 1919 and 1924.\nIn the 1930s, Rickenbacker made an electric double bass. Then American Paul Tutmarc made the first electric bass that could be played like a guitar, called the \"Audiovox 736 Bass\". This bass also had frets. Even though these were the first of this kind, they never sold very well.\nFirst Fender Precision Bass.\nLeo Fender, the founder of Fender, had the idea in the 1940s to build a solid-body bass guitar. He wanted it to be easier to play than a double bass. He also wanted it to be smaller so it was easy to move. He got this idea when talking to guitarists who didn't have jobs. They said that they could have gotten jobs being bassists, but found the double bass too hard to play.\nThe idea of an electric, solid-body bass was new, so Fender had to make it themselves. They spoke to many bassists and guitarists to work out what design would be best. Fender had made the Telecaster guitar before and so used his designs from it to help him make the Precision. The bass was tuned the same as a double bass, EADG, with four strings. The body was a lot like the telecaster, but the top stuck out more towards the headstock so the neck wasn't too heavy to hold when playing the bass with a strap standing.&lt;ref name =\"The Bass Book\"&gt;"}

But it is a very good entry for the season.\"\nOn February 1, 2020, Dan Vebber won the at the 72nd Writers Guild of America Awards for writing the episode."}

{"id": "753816", "revid": "7501165", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=753816", "title": "Black garden ant", "text": "The Black garden ant (\"Lasius niger\"), also known as the Common black ant, Common house ant or Tramp ant, is a formicine ant. It is a species of the subgenus \"Lasius\", which is found across Eurasia and in some parts of South America, Southeast Asia and Australasia. The European species is now split into two species; \"L. niger\", which are found in open areas; and \"L. platythorax\", which is found in forests . \nThe ants build nests underground, commonly under stones, but also in rotten wood, or under roots. The nests can have up to 40,000 workers, but the average size is 4,000\u20137,000 ants. The colony has a single queen which can live up to 15 years, and it has been claimed that some have lived for 30 years. In the early stages of a colony there can two or three queens in the nest. They will tolerate each other until the first workers come, then it is most likely they will fight until one queen remains. In tests in laboratories, worker ants have lived at least four years.\nAppearance.\nThe worker ants are dark glossy black, and 3\u20135\u00a0mm long. The queens are 9\u00a0mm long, glossy black color, and with slight brown stripes on her abdomen. After a queen mates, she removes her wings and eats her wing muscles as food over the winter. The male ants are 3.5\u20134.5\u00a0mm long and are only produced by queens for mating. They have a dark glossy body, which is a different shape from the workers, and look like a wasp. They have delicate wings which stand out from the rest of the body. \nMating flights.\nAnts mate while flying. The mating (or nuptial) flights of \"Lasius niger\" usually take place from June to September. In North America flights happen during the autumn, but in Europe they take place during the hot summer months of July and August. Flights can contain thousands of winged males and females. When the queen has mated, she will land and look for a suitable place to dig a tunnel. The males generally only live for a day or two after the mating flights.\nNests.\nThe queen ant removes her wings to dig. When she has dug a tunnel, she blocks the entrance and then digs a small chamber to lay her eggs. The eggs hatch after 8\u201310 weeks. The queen does not leave the nest to look for food until eggs have hatched, and the larvae have grown into ants. She survives on the protein from eating her own wings. \nEgg to ant.\nThe black garden ant, like other ants, has four stages of development: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. The eggs are tiny, white, kidney-shaped, with a smooth sticky surface. This helps them to be carried in a group instead of one by one. After hatching the larvae look like tiny maggots. They need to be fed by the queen (or workers in the case of an established colony) if they are to mature. As they grow, they shed their skin, doing so usually three times in total. With each molt, the larvae grow hooked hairs which allow them to be carried in groups. At the last molt they are too big to be carried as part of a group and so are carried individually. When it is big enough, it spins a cocoon around itself. To help, the queen (or workers) may bury the larva so that it can spin its cocoon undisturbed. When the process of metamorphosis is complete the worker ant comes out of the cocoon. It is completely white but it only takes one hour to turn black.\nA new colony.\nThe first worker ants are very small. Later generations of ants grow much bigger. The new worker ants begin make the nest bigger. They take care of the queen and her eggs. They open the entrance to the nest and begin to look for food above ground. They need to gather food quickly to support future growth and to feed the starved queen. The queen will have lost around 50% of her body weight. The queen will lay more eggs, which is her only task in the colony. The later generations of worker ants will be bigger, stronger and more aggressive because there is more food for them while they are growing. Instead of only having the queens to look after them, they have a team of foraging and nursing workers. Provided workers are able to find food, the colony will see an exponential rise in population. After several years, when colony is well established, the queen will lay eggs that will become new queens and males. Black ants often make large nests with with tunnels connecting the different sections.\nEating habits.\nThe black garden ants eat nectar, small insects such as codling moth larvae, and fruit. The ants can 'milk' aphids, cockroaches and beetles. "}

This is different from a minority government, when the party with the most seats in a legislature has less than half the seats, and a coalition government, when multiple different parties work together to govern. Usually when elections happen, the parties try to win a majority government. This is because majority governments let them pass all their legislation.\nSometimes, when parties have a very stable coalition for a very long time, people call it a majority government. One example of this is in Australia, where the Liberal and National have parties have worked together in a coalition for several decades."}

It is in the foothills of the Great Dividing Range, within the Shire of Hepburn, and about 108 kilometres north-west of Melbourne. The town was first settled in 1852 as a gold-mining town. There were 2,548 people living in Daylesford in 2016.\nThe area around the town, including Hepburn Springs to the north, is known for its natural spring mineral spas. Over 80 per cent of Australia's sparkling mineral water is found in this area.\nDaylesford is one of Australia's few spa towns. Many people visit for the spas, as well as the restaurants and galleries. It is also the filming location for the third season of The Saddle Club.\nThe area was the home of the Djadja Wurrung Aborigines. Farmers began to move into the district in 1838. In 1848, Irish immigrant John Egan took up land on the future town site then known as Wombat Flat. He and a party of searchers found gold in 1851 on land now covered by Lake Daylesford. This started a local gold rush. More gold was found around the area. The town site was surveyed and founded in 1852. At first the town was called Wombat, and later renamed Daylesford.\nIn 1859 there were 3400 people digging for gold. The post office opened on 1 February 1858 and a telegraph office was opened in August 1859. Daylesford was declared a municipality in 1859 and a borough in the early 1860s.\nBy the 1860s all the alluvial gold had been found. Large mines were built to get the gold that was found underground in the quartz reefs. Mining continued until the 1930s. In later years Daylesford became associated as being a fashionable spa resort, this ended during the Great Depression. In the 1990s it became fashionable again.\nThe Daylesford Magistrates' Court closed on 1 January 1990.\nClimate.\nDaylesford is above sea level. It has a cooler, wetter climate than Melbourne. Summer (January\u2013February) temperatures range from . July temperatures are cold, ranging from about to . Annual precipitation, occasionally falling as snow, averages about . In some years, rainfall has been as low as to over in other years.\nEconomy.\nThe Daylesford-Hepburn Springs area, has 65 mineral springs. This is more than 80 per cent of Australia\u2019s known mineral water springs. As a result, there are a number of spa developments including Hepburn Bathhouse &amp;amp; Spa, Mineral Spa at Peppers Springs Retreat and Salus Spa, Lake House. The town holds a number of annual events, including the ChillOut Festival in March each year, the largest gay and lesbian festival in rural and regional Australia; the Harvest Week Festival; the lavender festival; and the Hepburn Springs Swiss Italian Festival celebrating the town's Swiss-Italian heritage.\nMajor industries in the economy of Daylesford today are healthcare, accommodation and food, and retail trade.\nThe town has several primary schools and one public secondary school, Daylesford Secondary College. The secondary college began as a mining school in 1890. Other schools include Daylesford Primary School, St. Michael's Primary School, and Daylesford Dharma School. \nTransport.\nThe Midland Highway runs directly through the town. It links to Castlemaine in the north and Ballarat in the south-west. \nThe railway to the town closed in 1978. The railway layout at Daylesford station was unusual in that the lines from Creswick and Carlsruhe both entered the station from the same end. The Daylesford Spa Country Railway currently operates a Sunday tourist service to Musk and Bullarto along the line towards Carlsruhe.\nSport.\nThe town has an Australian Rules football team which plays in the Central Highlands Football League.\nThere is also the Daylesford and Hepburn United Soccer Club also known as the Saints .The Saints have won four league titles in their 20-year history along with two cup finals."}

Intact blood vessels are important to moderating blood's tendency to form clots.\nThe word \"hemostasis\" (, \"sometimes\" ) uses the combining forms \"hemo-\" and \"-stasis\", New Latin from Ancient Greek \u03b1\u1f31\u03bc\u03bf- \"haimo-\" (akin to \u03b1\u1f37\u03bc\u03b1 \"ha\u00eema\"), \"blood\", and \u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 st\u00e1sis, \"stasis\", yielding \"motionlessness or stopping of blood\"."}

Many organisms can replace this damaged tissue with new tissue. This occurs in several steps, and is generally known as tissue healing, or wound healing. \nIn undamaged skin, the epidermis (surface layer) and dermis (deeper layer) form a protective barrier against the external environment. When the barrier is broken, biochemical events repair the damage. This process is divided into predictable phases: blood clotting (hemostasis), inflammation, tissue growth (proliferation), and tissue remodelling (maturation). Blood clotting may be seen as part of the inflammation stage instead of a separate stage.\nIn general, after the wound is fully healed, a scar will remain. Even after the scar has appeared remodelling processes take place. It can take a very long time until this scar has reached its final form.\nSometimes complications from wound healing can occur. A common one is infections during the healing process, which will lead to more scars or larger ones. \nThis process is not limited to humans, but it does not apply to organisms with a hard exoskeleton such as arthropods."}

The Sadu Jana Vimochana Samara Vedi (SJVSV) agitation began with hundreds of Vedi workers encroaching upon the Kumbazha Estate of Harrison Malayalam Limited at Chengara on 4 August 2007, demanding five acres of land for farming and Rs.50,000 towards initial farming expenses to each landless family among them. They pitched tents on the occupied land and started tapping the rubber trees at the estate for livelihood. The Vedi leader claims that 200\u00a0hectares of land at Chengara is under SJVSV occupation. Really the land struggle is not taking place in Chengara, but in Harrisons Malayalam Estate more than 3\u00a0km away, which is popularly known as Chengara estate. So it got the name \"Chengara Samaram\". A fact is that it is taking place on the Athumpumkulam border of the Harrisons Malayalam Estate not in the border of Chengara."}
