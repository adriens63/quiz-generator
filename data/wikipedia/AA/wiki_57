Scandinavian Vikings, also called Norsemen, explored the oceans and rivers of Europe through trade and warfare. The Vikings also reached Iceland, Greenland, Newfoundland, and Anatolia. Some Vikings are believed to have settled at L'Anse aux Meadows, an archaeological site on the northernmost tip of the island of Newfoundland, Canada, at a place they called Vinland.\nStart.\nIn England the Viking Age began dramatically on June 8, 793, when Norsemen destroyed the abbey on Lindisfarne. Monks were killed in the abbey, thrown into the sea to drown, or carried away as slaves along with the church's wealth. The Viking devastation of Northumbria's Holy Island shocked and alerted the royal courts of Europe. \"Never before has such an atrocity been seen,\" declared the Northumbrian scholar Alcuin of York. More than any other single event, the attack on Lindisfarne cast a shadow on the perception of the Vikings for the next 1100 years. In the 1890s scholars outside Scandinavia began to rethink the achievements, artistry, technological skills and seamanship of the Vikings.\nUntil Victoria's reign in Britain, Vikings were portrayed as violent and bloodthirsty. The stories from medieval England had always portrayed them as 'wolves among sheep'. During the nineteenth century, public opinions changed. The first challenges to the many anti-Viking images in Britain emerged in the 17th century. Some scholarly works on the Viking Age became available to readers in Britain. Archaeologists began to dig up Britain's Viking past. Linguists started to work on identifying Viking-Age origins for rural idioms and proverbs. The new dictionaries of the Old Norse language enabled the Victorians to study some of the Icelandic Sagas.\nDuring the second half of the 18th century the Icelandic Sagas were still used as important historical sources, but the Viking Age was regarded as a barbaric and uncivilized period in the history of the Nordic countries. Until recently, what was known about the history of the Viking Age was based on the Icelandic Sagas, the history of the Danes written by Saxo Grammaticus, the Russian \"Primary Chronicle\" and \"the War of the Irish with the Foreigners\". Few scholars still accept these texts as reliable sources; historians nowadays rely more on archaeology and numismatics, which have helped people understand the period.\nBackground.\nThe Norsemen were explorers, colonizers and traders as well as plunderers. The Vikings from Norway explored the North Atlantic and settled Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Shetland and Orkney Islands, Caithness in Scotland, Greenland and (briefly) North America. The Vikings from Denmark raided ports and coastal towns along the coasts of Europe and Britain. The Vikings from Sweden pushed east, into areas that are now parts of Russia and Ukraine, establishing trade connections with the Middle East and beyond.\nBy the 9th century, a strong central authority was established in Jutland, and the Danes were looking beyond their own territory for land, trade and plunder. Norway had been settled over many centuries by Germanic peoples from Denmark and Sweden who made farming and fishing communities around its coasts and lakes. The mountains and fjords formed strong natural boundaries. The communities remained independent of each other, unlike the situation in Denmark which is lowland. By the year 800, there were 30 small kingdoms in Norway. The sea was the easiest way of communicating between these Norwegian kingdoms and the outside world. In the eighth century Scandinavians began to build war ships and send them on raids. The Viking longships were capable of travel on the open seas but also had a very shallow \"draft\", meaning they could sail into shallower bays and farther up rivers than other ships of their time. This led to the term \"Viking\", which came from the Old Norse word \"v\u012bk\" (meaning inlet or bay). A person who went on raids was said to go \"viking\".\nIt is unknown what triggered the Vikings' expansion and conquests. This era was at the same time as the Medieval Warm Period (800 \u2013 1300) and stopped with the start of the Little Ice Age (about 1250 \u2013 1850). The lack of pack-ice during their time may have allowed the Norsemen to go \"a-viking\" or \"raiding\". It is believed that the heathen Norsemen suffered from unequal trade practices by Christian merchants who were given preference through a Christian network of traders. A two-tiered system of pricing existed among merchants who secretly traded with the Norse heathens. Viking raids occurred both separately and together with regular trading expeditions.\nHistorians also suggest that the Scandinavian population was too large for the peninsula and there were not enough crops to feed everyone. This led to a hunt for more land to feed the ever-growing Viking population. Internal conflicts, especially during the period of conquest and settlement that followed the early raids, caused the progressive centralisation of power into fewer hands. This meant that lower classes who did not want to be oppressed by greedy kings went in search of their own lands. Those who settled Iceland created Europe's first modern republic with a yearly assembly of elected officials called the \"Althing\".\nOverview.\nThe earliest date given for a Viking raid is 787 AD when, according to the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", a group of men from Norway sailed to Portland, in Dorset. There, a royal official mistook them for merchants. They killed him when he tried to lead them to the king's manor to pay a trading tax on their goods. The beginning of the Viking Age in the British Isles is, however, often given as 793. It was recorded in the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" that the Northmen raided the important island monastery of Lindisfarne:\n\"AD. 793. This year came dreadful fore-warnings over the land of the Northumbrians, terrifying the people most woefully: these were immense sheets of light rushing through the air, and whirlwinds, and fiery dragons flying across the firmament. These tremendous tokens were soon followed by a great famine: and not long after, on the sixth day before the ides of January in the same year, the harrowing inroads of heathen men made lamentable havoc in the church of God in Holy-island \"(Lindisfarne)\", by rapine and slaughter.\" -\"Anglo Saxon Chronicle\"\nIn 794, according to the \"Annals of Ulster\", there was a serious attack on Lindisfarne's mother-house of Iona, which was followed in 795 by raids on the northern coast of Ireland. From bases there, the Norsemen attacked Iona again in 802, causing great slaughter amongst the \"C\u00e9li D\u00e9\" Brethren, and burning the abbey to the ground.\nThe end of the Viking Age is traditionally marked in England by three major events: the failed invasion by Haraldr Har\u00f0r\u00e1\u00f0i, who was defeated by Saxon King Harold Godwinson in 1066 at the Battle of Stamford Bridge; in Ireland, the capture of Dublin by Strongbow and his Hiberno-Norman forces in 1171; and in Scotland by the defeat of King H\u00e1kon H\u00e1konarson at the Battle of Largs in 1263. Harold Godwinson was subsequently defeated within a month by William, Duke of Normandy, who was another descendant of Vikings. Normandy had been acquired by \"Normans\" (Norsemen) in 911. Scotland took its present form when it regained territory from the Norse between the thirteenth and the fifteenth centuries.\nMost Scandinavian historians and archaeologists give a different definition. Instead, the Viking age is said to have ended with the establishment of royal authority in the Scandinavian countries and the adoption of Christianity as the dominant religion. The date is usually put somewhere in the early 11th century in all three Scandinavian countries. The end of the Viking Age in Norway is marked by the Battle of Stiklestad in 1030. They proclaimed Norway as a Christian nation, and Norwegians could no longer be called Vikings.\nThe Kingdom of the Franks under Charlemagne was especially hard-hit by Viking raiders, who could sail down the Seine without much difficulty. Near the end of Charlemagne's reign and throughout the reigns of his sons and grandsons, a string of Viking raids began, leading to a Scandinavian conquest and settlement of the region now known as Normandy.\nIn 911, French King Charles the Simple made an agreement with the Viking warleader Rollo, a chieftain of either Norwegian or Danish origin. Charles gave Rollo the title of duke and granted him possession of Normandy. In return, Rollo swore fealty to Charles, converted to Christianity, and swore to defend the northern region of France against raids by other Viking groups. Several generations later, the Norman descendants of these Viking settlers identified themselves as French and brought the French language and their variant of French culture to England in 1066. With the Norman Conquest, they became the ruling aristocracy of Anglo-Saxon England, leading to the change from Old English to Middle English language.\nReligion.\nAt the start of the Viking age, the Vikings believed in the Norse religion. They believed in a of gods and goddesses, as well as \"Valhalla\", a heaven for warriors. The lower class of society would go to a place called \"hel\", similar to life on earth. According to Viking beliefs, Viking chieftains would please their war-gods by their bravery, and would become \"worth-ship\"; that is, the chieftain would earn a \"burial at sea\". They also performed land burials which often still included a ship, treasure, weapons, tools, clothing and even slaves and women buried alive with the dead chieftain, for his journey to Valhalla and adventure in the after-life. Poets composed sagas about the exploits of these chieftains, keeping their memories alive.\nFreyr and his sister Freya were gods of \"fertility\", which means being able to grow. They made sure that people had many children and that the land produced plenty of crops. Some farmers even called their fields after Freyr, in the hope that this would ensure a good harvest. Toward the end of the Viking Age, more and more Scandinavians were converted to Christianity, often by force. The introduction of Christianity did not immediately end Viking voyages, but it may have been a factor that helped the Viking Age to an end.\nTrade centres.\nSome of the most important trading ports during the period include both existing and ancient cities such as Jelling (Denmark), Ribe (Denmark), Roskilde (Denmark), Hedeby (Denmark, now Germany), Aarhus (Denmark), Vineta (Pomerania), Truso (Poland), Kaupang (Norway), Birka (Sweden), Bordeaux (France), Jorvik (England), Dublin (Ireland) and Aldeigjuborg (Russia).\nIn fiction and theater.\nIn the late 19th century (1800s), Richard Wagner and other artists in the Romantic period made operas and other artwork about ancient Germanic culture. They liked the Vikings because they were not Greeks or Romans. They came up with the idea of Vikings wearing fur clothes and helmets with wings or horns on them and drinking out of hollowed-out animal horns. Some ancient Germans wore helmets with horns on them, but real Vikings did not. Wagner and his partners deliberately dressed the actors in the opera \"Ring des Nibelungen\" so they would look like ancient Germans and so the audience would feel like modern Germans came from medieval Vikings."}

It is also known as Bordeaux after its region of \"appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e\". This is the French system which certifies where food and drink comes from.\nHistory.\nThe wine from Bordeaux was a dark ros\u00e9 spiced drink in the Middle Ages. That's why it was called \"claret\", from the French \"clairet\". It changed to the present dry dark red in the 18th century.\nCrisis.\nThe wine industry in Bordeaux has economic problems. It faces fierce competition from New World wines. Also, the French drink less wine nowadays.\nIn 2004, exports to the U.S. dropped 59% in value over the previous year. Sales in Britain dropped 33% in value during the same period. The UK, a major market, now imports more wine from Australia than from France. Chilean red wine is also extremely popular now.\nProbably there is no single reason for these changes. Bordeaux wines are almost always blends from two or more types of vine. Many New World wines are single vine strains such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot noir, Syrah (Shiraz), and the white wine grapes Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc. Bottles labelled by type of grape (and so by taste) has caught on with the public. Also, the cheaper French wines are much more expensive when exported. All wines and spirits into countries like the UK are heavily taxed. A cheap French (or Spanish or Italian) wine which might sell in at home fore under \u00a31, will sell for \u00a34 or more in the UK. Customers have evidently decided that wine from elsewhere is a better deal.\nThe situation is quite different for sophisticated Bordeaux wines.

When people talk about the infinite monkey theorem, the \"monkey\" is not always a real monkey. Instead, it is an example of a device that produces random letters. However, the chances of a monkey actually typing a text, like Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\", are very small.\nSimplified Proof.\nFor example, let it be that Shakespeare wrote \"Wikipedia is the best website in the world\". If the monkey does not have extra characters like numbers (example: 4, 2) and symbols (example: #, ~) then the monkey will only have 53 things on is keyboard to press. Those are: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, and the spacebar.\nSince there are only 53 buttons the monkey is allowed to press, eventually, he will hit the \"W\" button. This is because the monkey has infinite time to press the buttons and has a 1 in 53 chance of pressing the W button. Then, he will probably hit another button and not type the sentence \"Wikipedia is the best website in the world\".\nBut, the monkey has infinite time. That means, in total, he will press the \"W\" button infinity times. After every time the monkey presses the \"W\" button, he has a 1 in 53 chance of pressing the \"i\" button. But, since the \"W\" button will be pressed infinite times, the word \"Wi\" will appear infinite times too. This is because the chance of \"i\" following \"W\" is equal to the chance of \"W\" which is 1/53 multiplied by the chance of \"i\" following it which is 1/53. That is 1/2809. That is really small, but since \"W\" and \"i\" appear an infinite amount of times in the monkey's words it becomes certain. Meaning there is a 100% chance that \"eventually\", the word \"Wi\" will appear. However, since \"W\" and \"i\" both will be presses by the monkey an infinite amount of time, \"Wi\" will actually appear an infinite amount of times too.\nThis goes on and on. Eventually, after even longer time, there will be the word \"Wik\" because \"Wi\" appears infinite times and \"k\" has a 1 in 53 chance of following it. Now, since \"Wik\" appears infinite times, we know that \"Wiki\" will eventually appear too. Not only that, we know \"Wiki\" will appear an infinite amount of times.\nFollowing this logic, we will see \"Wikip\" and \"Wikipe\" and \"Wikiped\" and \"Wikipedi\" all the way until we will see \"Wikipedia is the best website in the world\". Not only that, but we will see it infinite times.\nSince the sentence \"Wikipedia is the best website in the world\" was just any sentence, by using the proof above, one can know \"anything\" appears an infinite amount of times. Therefore, we know that all of Shakespeare's things will appear. Even the things he threw away, even the thoughts he had at night, and even Hamlet.\nThis is like how you can find any combination of numbers (example:1829192) in the number pi since it has an infinite amount of random numbers.\nThe above proof was an example of a Proof by induction."}

It was developed to model the chance of events happening in all kinds of real-life scenarios.\nDefinition.\nTake two measurable spaces, and name them formula_1 and formula_2. A measurable space is any pair of sets, called formula_3 and formula_4, that follow these rules:\nA random variable, named formula_11, is a measurable function from formula_12 to formula_13. This is written formula_14. A random variable is typically represented by capital roman letters such as formula_15, formula_16, formula_17 and formula_18, and can be either discrete (taking on a countable set of values) or continuous (taking on an interval of values).\nThe set formula_12 is called the sample space. The set formula_20 is called the event space.\nUse in Probability.\nTake a probability measure formula_21 on formula_1. Take a set formula_23 in formula_24. Then formula_25 is defined to mean formula_26.\nExamples with Dice.\nWhen you roll a dice, 6 events can happen. These events are the different numbers that can show on the dice: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. \nDicing Fruit.\nHere is an example of a random variable. You roll a fair dice once. If the number on the dice is odd, you eat an apple, and if the number is even, you eat an orange. The random variable is the type of fruit that you will eat. Before you roll the dice, you don't know if you will eat an apple or an orange. We can also write this with mathematics:\nTake formula_27. Take formula_20 to be the power set of formula_12. Take formula_30. Take formula_24 to be the power set of formula_13. Our random variable follows the even/odd rule from above:\nHere formula_34 represents the number on the dice after you roll it. We said the dice is fair. In mathematics, this means formula_35 for formula_36 and formula_37.\nThe event that you eat an apple is a set in the event space. It is formula_38. The probability that you eat an apple is the probability measure of this set. It is formula_39.\nDicing Fruit Unfairly.\nHere is another example. Sometimes a dice is unbalanced. This means that it rolls some numbers more often than others. We can do the same experiment as above, but with an unbalanced dice.\nFor example, let's say that we use a dice that has been changed in one way: it never rolls the number 5. Then you are less likely to eat an apple, because 5 is an odd number. The random variable is \"exactly\" the same as before:\nThis is because end possibilities have not changed. After the dice is rolled, you will eat an apple or an orange. You don't know which. What has changed is the \"probability\" that you eat an apple or an orange. In mathematics, this means\nThe event that you eat an apple is \"the same set\" as for the fair dice. It is formula_38. But this event is now less likely to happen, because the dice cannot roll a 5. In other words, the probability that you eat an apple is \"different\" than for the fair dice. It is formula_43.\nProbability spaces.\nThe examples show that a random variable doesn't automatically give probabilities. If we choose formula_44 differently, one random variable can give different probabilities. This can be confusing. For this reason, mathematicians often define a random variable on a probability space. The mathematical notation for this is formula_45. This fixes the probability measure. Then there is no confusion about the probabilities of events."}

It was signed in Nantes by King Henry IV in April 1598, although some provinces blocked it until 1610. The purpose of the law was to make peace after the French Wars of Religion. Henry IV was a former Huguenot (French Protestant) who had changed his religion to being Catholic so that he could be the king of France.\nThe edict was an early example of freedom of religion in Europe. However, it did not make Catholics and Protestants equal. It said that the Catholic Church was the national religion of France. It only allowed people to be Protestants in certain areas, where they were allowed to defend their own fortress towns. They also still had to pay money to the Catholic Church and have Catholic holidays. Many Catholics in France hated the idea of allowing people to be Protestant, while the Protestants thought that it did not go far enough.\nThe Edict of Nantes was weakened during the reign of King Louis XIII, with many of the fortress towns being captured by the government. In 1685, King Louis XIV replaced the Edict of Nantes with the Edict of Fontainebleau, which banned people from being Protestant. This made many Huguenots leave the country, and a hundred years later there were not many left. In 1787, King Louis XVI made it legal for people to be Protestant again. During the French Revolution a few years later, France gave people full freedom of religion.\nOpposition.\nLouis XIV did not like the Edict of Nantes. Being an ruler, Louis thought that there should be one king, one nation, and one church only - and that church had to be the Roman Catholic Church. The king let Roman Catholics Huguenots even after the Edict. He hoped the Huguenots would become Roman Catholics. Finally, in 1685 King Louis withdrew the Edict of Nantes.\nThe government declared that no one could believe in any religion except Roman Catholicism. Anyone joining in a Protestant service could die. Because of this, many Huguenots died for their faith. Some, though, gave up and became Roman Catholics. Others, refusing to stop being Protestants, ran away from France.\nLouis XIV was horrified when he lost the Huguenots. They were among the most skilled workers in France. Many bankers, weavers, and merchants were Huguenots. Louis XIV ordered that France's borders be closed, and said that nobody could leave the country without his permission. However, Protestants still found ways to escape. Some hid in barrels on ships sailing away from France. Others disguised themselves as peasants and escaped. All together, probably more than two hundred thousand Huguenots ran away.\nProtestant countries in Europe were glad to have such hard-working subjects: over a third of the Huguenots went to the Netherlands. From there many of them went to the Dutch colony at the Cape of Good Hope. Many went to England, and from there to America, especially Virginia and the Carolinas.\nThese immigrants were very valuable to their new home countries. They were hard working, obedient, and talented. They also brought many secrets of French manufacturing with them: for example, they introduced silk production to the rest of Europe."}

It is often represented by the symbol formula_1. After performing the cross product, a new vector is formed. The cross product of two vectors is always perpendicular to both of the vectors which were \"crossed\". This means that cross product is normally only valid in three-dimensional space.\nImportance of the cross product.\nBeing a vector operation, the cross product is extremely important in all sorts of sciences (particularly physics), engineering, and mathematics. One important example of the cross product involves torque or moment. Another important application involves the magnetic field.\nVisualizing the cross product in three dimensions.\nThe cross product of formula_2 and formula_3 is a vector that we shall call formula_4:\nThe vector formula_6 is perpendicular to both formula_7 and formula_8. The direction of formula_6 is determined by a variation of the right-hand rule. By holding your right hand as shown in the picture, your thumb points in the direction of formula_4 (the cross product of formula_7 and formula_8), with the index finger pointing in the direction that formula_7 points, and the middle finger pointing in the direction that formula_8 points. If the angle between the index and middle fingers is greater than 180\u00b0, then you need to turn the hand upside down.\nHow to calculate the cross product in vector notation.\nLike any mathematical operation, the cross product can be done in a straightforward way.\nTwo dimensions.\nSince cross products are usually only defined for three-dimensional vectors, the calculation of cross product in two dimensions treat the vectors as if they are vectors on the xy-plane in three dimension.\nMore specifically, if\nformula_15\nand\nformula_16\nthen\nformula_17\nor\nformula_18\nand\nformula_19\nwhere formula_20 is just a symbol indicating that the new vector is pointing up (in the z-direction). If one \"crosses\" two vectors which are both in the xy-plane, then the product, being perpendicular to both vectors, must point in the z direction. If the value of formula_21 is positive, then it points out of the page; if its value is negative, then it points into the page.\nThree dimensions.\nThere are two ways to find the cross product of two 3D vectors: with coordinate notation or with angle.\nCoordinate notation.\nGiven vectors formula_7 and formula_8, where \nformula_24\nand \nformula_25\nThen the cross product of formula_7 and formula_8 is: \nformula_28.\nWith angle.\nGiven vectors formula_7 and formula_8, where \nformula_24\nand \nformula_25\nThen the cross product of formula_7 and formula_8 is: \nformula_35,\nwhere formula_36 is the angle between formula_7 and formula_8, \u2016a\u2016 and \u2016b\u2016 are the magnitudes of vectors formula_2 and formula_3, and n is a unit vector perpendicular to the plane containing formula_2 and formula_3."}

This was usually done by causing the accused person to do a painful task. If that task was completed without injury or if the injuries healed fast, this taken as a \"sign of God\", which meant that the accused was innocent. People believed that God would not allow innocent people to be harmed. He would therefore help them by doing a miracle. There were three common types of Trial by Ordeal: \nOrdeals had to be watched over by a religious person, such as a priest, because each ordeal was supposed to show the judgement of God. In England, Ordeals were common up to and including the reign of Henry II, who introduced Trials by Jury.\nIn pre-modern society, the ordeal typically was done together with the oath and witness accounts as the central means by which to reach a verdict. The term \"ordeal\" itself, Old English \"ord\u01e3l\", has the meaning of \"judgment, verdict\" (German \"Urteil\", Dutch \"oordeel\"), from Proto-Germanic \"*uzdailjam\" \"that which is dealt out\".\nIn Europe, ordeals commonly required an accused person to test himself or herself against fire or water. How this was done varied in detail, and was different at different places and times. In England, ordeals were common under both the Anglo-Saxons and the Normans. Fire was the element typically used to test noble defendants, while water was more commonly used by lesser folk. \nPriestly cooperation in trials by fire and water was forbidden by Pope Innocent III at the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215, and replaced by compurgation. Trials by ordeal became more rare over the Late Middle Ages, often replaced by confessions extracted under torture, but the practice was discontinued only in the 16th century. Johannes Hartlieb in 1456 reports a popular superstition for how to identify a thief by an ordeal by ingestion practiced privately without judicial sanction. \nTrial by ordeal has existed in polytheistic cultures as far back as the Code of Hammurabi and the Code of Ur-Nammu, and in animist tribal societies, such as the trial by drinking \"red water\" (calabar bean) in Sierra Leone. There the intended effect is magical rather than calling forth justice from a god. "}

It is thought of as one of the greatest orchestras in the world.\nThe orchestra play in a concert hall called the Musikverein. Before becoming a member of the Vienna Philharmonic the musicians have to work for at least three years in the opera house (the Vienna State Opera). Then they are allowed to try to become a member of the Vienna Philharmonic.\nHistory.\nThe orchestra started in 1842, when Otto Nicolai formed the \"Philharmonische Academie\". The members of this orchestra made all the decisions about how the orchestra should be organized, and the orchestra still works in this way today.\nWhen Nicolai left in 1847, the orchestra nearly came to an end. They did not play very much until 1860, when Karl Anton Eckert joined as conductor. Since then, the orchestra has given concerts all the time.\nFrom 1875 to 1898 Hans Richter was principal conductor, except for the season 1882-1883 when he had an argument with the orchestral committee. During the time Richter was conductor the orchestra gave the first performances of several very famous works, including Symphonies no 2 and 3 by Brahms and Symphony no 8 by Anton Bruckner.\nGustav Mahler was their conductor from 1898 to 1901. During this time the orchestra played abroad for the first time. They played at the 1900 Paris World Exposition. The next conductors of the orchestra were Felix Weingartner, Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler and Clemens Krauss.\nSince 1933, the orchestra has not had one main conductor, but instead it has many guest conductors who have stayed for short periods. These have included a great many of the world's best known conductors, including Richard Strauss, Arturo Toscanini, Hans Knappertsbusch, Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler, Karl B\u00f6hm, John Barbirolli, Herbert von Karajan, Carlo Maria Giulini, Georg Solti, Erich Kleiber, James Levine, Zubin Mehta, Carlos Kleiber, Leonard Bernstein, Claudio Abbado, Riccardo Muti, Nikolaus Harnoncourt, Pierre Boulez, Lorin Maazel, Mariss Jansons, Daniel Barenboim and Valery Gergiev. Three conductors, however, gave many concerts with the orchestra during the period after World War II: Karajan and B\u00f6hm, who were made honorary conductors, and Bernstein, who was made an honorary member of the orchestra.\nSince 1941 the orchestra has played the New Year's Day concert every January 1, in their concert hall Musikverein. The concert is dedicated to the music of the Strauss family composers, especially Johann Strauss II. The concert is watched on television by people all over the world.\nIn recent years the orchestra has been criticised because they did not allow women to become full members of the orchestra. This is now gradually starting to change. They were also criticised for racism because they only took people who were white. In 2001 they appointed a violinist who was half-Asian."}

It is named after the concert hall in which it is based, the Gewandhaus (pronounce: \u201cGe-VANT-house\u201d). The word \u201cGewandhaus\u201d means \"Textiles Hall\". It is a hall that originally was used for people to buy and sell textiles.\nHistory of the orchestra.\nThe beginnings of the orchestra go back to 1743, when a society called the \"Grosses Concert\" began performing in private homes. In 1744 the \"Grosses Concert\" moved its concerts to the \"Three Swans\" Tavern. Their concerts continued there for 36 years. Gradually more and more people started to complain about the noise and the behaviour in the tavern, so in 1780 the mayor and city council of Leipzig offered to let the orchestra use part of the Gewandhaus, the building where the merchants were selling textiles. The orchestra gave its first concert in the Gewandhaus in 1781. It is the oldest orchestra in Germany, apart from private orchestras who belonged to rich people.\nIn 1835 the great composer Felix Mendelssohn became the orchestra's main conductor (music director). He was called the \"Gewandhauskapellmeister\". He kept this position, apart from one year, until his death in 1847. In 1885, the orchestra moved into a new hall which was given the same name. This was destroyed by bombing in World War II in 1944. The present Gewandhaus is the third building with the name. It was opened in 1981.\nThe orchestra gives concerts in Leipzig and all over the world, and makes many recordings. They also play at the Thomaskirche, the church where Johann Sebastian Bach used to work, and as the official opera orchestra of the Leipzig Opera.\nLater principal conductors included Arthur Nikisch, Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler, Bruno Walter, and V\u00e1clav Neumann. From 1970 to 1996, Kurt Masur was Gewandhauskapellmeister. From 1998 to 2005 their conductor was Herbert Blomstedt. \nIn 2005, Riccardo Chailly took over as both Gewandhauskapellmeister and music director of the Leipzig Opera. They have released recordings on the Decca label of Felix Mendelssohn, Johannes Brahms, and the Robert Schumann symphonies in the re-orchestrations by Gustav Mahler."}

It was founded by Father Junipero Serra in 1772. It is on the central coast of California, halfway between San Diego and Monterey. It was named after Saint Louis, the bishop of Toulouse. It was the fifth of twenty-one missions in California. Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa is noted for its beautiful architectural features, mission life, and historical events.\nDesign.\nMission San Luis Obispo is different from all the other' missions' because it is one of the smallest and has a unique design. The design has both belfry (a bell tower) and a vestibule, which is an entrance hall between the outer door and the interior of a building. These are not found on any of the other California missions. The main nave (the long entrance part of the church) is long and narrow. At San Luis Obispo there is a secondary nave that is the same size and at the right of the altar. This is the only \"L\"-shaped mission church. Windows around the courtyard have round pillars with square opening, unlike the arches of other missions. San Luis Obispo is painted white and is surrounded by gardens, wine vineyards, and a fountain.\nMission Life.\nMission life was hard for the California Indians because they had to work hard and study Catholic Religon.\nWomen had to cook, sew, garden, and make candles and soap. Men had to farm and care for the animals while the older people had to fish and make arrows. The children attended church every day to study Catholicism. When their studies were done they would work hard helping their families. The Spanish introduced the gun to the Chumash. The Hupa were grateful for the Spaniard guns as they depended on them for hunting bears for food. The Chumash helped these Spaniards build the missions and take care of it and its surrounding\nOther hostile Indians attacked San Luis Obispo on three separate occasions before 1774. During the attack, the thatched roofs of the mission buildings were set afire by blazing arrows. In May 1807, the mission was designated as one of six in which the California priests could make their annual retreats for spiritual exercises. Following Mexico's war against Spain in 1810, all the California missions were forced to contribute food and clothing to the army. In 1830, the bell tower was destroyed in an earthquake, but was later rebuilt with stone.\nToday, the mission serves as a parish church of the diocese of Monterey."}

But in addition to the skin (drumhead) there are also small pairs of jingles - like tiny cymbals - in slots around the frame. However, tambourines come in many types. Some are made without a skin, particularly for use in schools. The tambourine came to Europe through the Arabs who brought it to Italy and Spain.\nHow to play a tambourine.\nThe tambourine is usually held in the hand. The jingles can be made to sound by hitting the frame of the instrument with the other hand, or by shaking the instrument. Often the player will hold the instrument high in the air. This not only looks good, but it can also be heard well. The other hand can tap rhythms on the skin which makes it sound like a drum as well as making the jingles sound. It can be hit by the knuckles, or with the finger tips, or the flat of the hand or the back of the hand. It can also be hit against the side of the leg. A good player with a good tambourine can sometimes create a nice effect with a \"thumb roll\". This is done by making the tip of the thumb slightly wet and then moving it fast along the edge of the skin so that the thumb bounces very fast.\nIt is also possible to put the instrument, with the head up, on the player's lap or on a table or chair, and play with the fingers or with drumsticks.\nWhen a tambourine is used in an orchestra it is usually just one tambourine, although Berlioz asked for two tambourines in his overture \"Le carnaval romain\". It is very often used in music which sounds Italian or Spanish. It nearly always makes music sound very lively, for example in the second movement of Prokofiev's First Violin Concerto."}

If a tachyon did exist, it would have an imaginary number as its mass.\nIn September 2011, it was reported that a tau neutrino had traveled faster than the speed of light in a major release by CERN; however, later updates from CERN on the OPERA project indicate that the faster-than-light readings were resultant from \"a faulty element of the experiment's fibre optic timing system\".\nIn modern physics the term \"tachyon\" often refers to imaginary mass fields rather than to faster-than-light particles.

Once the boiling is done, the collagen will cool and make a jelly. As a food, gelatin is used to make jellied desserts; used in the preservation of fruit and meat, and to make powdered milk. Gelatin can also be used as glue for matches or for paper money. You can also find it used as the syrup in medicine, also known as medicine emulsions. Gelatin is also found in some makeup.\nGelatin is classed as a liquid when above room temperature but reverts to a solid if below room temperature. \nBecause gelatin comes from animals, vegetarians and vegans do not eat or use products that have gelatin added. Some religious or cultural groups also do not eat gelatin because of the animals used to make it. For example, people that keep kosher or halal will not eat gelatin because it is often made from cows. Alternatives to gelatin are products like agar or carrageenan which comes from seaweed or pectin which comes from plants. "}

When it fills with water, it is the largest lake in Australia, being long and wide. It is also in the driest part of Australia, getting only about of rain each year. It is in the north of South Australia, about north of Adelaide. The lake was named after the explorer, Edward Eyre, who was the first Europen to see it in 1840. It is the centre of the Lake Eyre National Park.\nGeography.\nLake Eyre is in the driest desert region of central Australia. It is a large endorheic lake system, which means that the water flows in, but does not flow out. As the water evaporates, the lake dries up leaving a dry salt lake. The lake does not usually completely dry up, there is often water in small areas on the lake surface. The rate that the water dries up is per year, that is about 20 times more than the rainfall in the area.\nFilling up.\nDuring the wet season the rivers from Queensland flow towards the lake through the Channel Country. These rivers drain about one sixth of Australia, an area the size of Spain. How much water reaches the lake depends on how rain falls in Queensland. Since 1885 the lake has filled in 1886/1887, 1889/1890, 1916/1917, 1950, 1955 and 1974-1976. In 1974 Lake Eyre was deep. Local rain filled Lake Eyre to in 1984 and 1989. Very heavy rain in January 2007 took about six weeks to reach the lake but put only a small amount of water into it. In February 2009, water from flooding rains in Queensland were flowing along the creeks to the lake covering about 40\u00a0km per day. The lake fills to about every three years, to , every ten years, and fills up about four times every 100 years.\nDrying up.\nWhen Lake Eyre is full, the water is almost fresh and native fresh water fish can live in it. The lake becomes saltier as the salt crust dissolves over six months. This kills millions of fish. When about 4m deep the Lake is as salty as the sea. It becomes more salty as the water evaporates. At about 500mm depth the Lake becomes a \"pink\" color because of a beta-carotene pigment made by the algae \"Dunaliella salina\".\nEarly history.\nBeaches made by wave action suggest that during the Medieval Warm Period Lake Eyre possibly held \"permanent water\" at levels above those of 1974.\nThe local Aboriginal people, the Arabunna people, have stories that explain the creation of Lake Eyre. These stories are part of their sacred traditions, and are only told to initiated people.\nAnimal and bird life.\nFresh water fish found in the full lake include boney bream (\"Nematolosa erebi\"), the Lake Eyre Basin sub-species of golden perch (\"Macquaria ambigua\") and various small hardyhead species (\"Craterocephalus spp\"). The Lake Eyre hardyhead, can live in water up to 15 times saltier than the ocean.\nWhen there is water more than 8 million birds, from more than 60 different species, flock to the lake. The pelicans are usually the first to arrive, followed by silver gulls, hoary headed grebes, Australasian grebes, cormorants, ducks, banded stilts, kites, falcons and wedge tailed eagles. Scientists still do not know how the birds know when the lake holds water.\nThere is also a lizard, the Lake Eyre Dragon, Ctenophorus maculosus, that lives in the cool mud below the salt crust of the lake.\nYacht club.\nThe \"Lake Eyre Yacht Club\" is a small group of people who sail on the lake's floods, including recent trips in 1997, 2000, 2001, 2004, 2007 and 2009. A number of 6 m Trailer Sailers sailed on Lake Eyre in 1975, 1976 and 1984 when the flood depth reached 3\u20136 m.\nLand speed record attempts.\nThe salt crust on the lake is not thick and can break like glass under a person's weight. At Level Post Bay, the crust is more than one metre thick, and because of its flat surface it has been the site for various land speed record attempts. In 1964, British driver, Sir Donald Campbell, set a new record of , in the \"Bluebird-Proteus CN7\"."}

The player winds the string around the thumb and finger so that the two shells can be clicked together.

The province is a popular tourist attraction since the late 1990s because there are many fine beaches.\nIts capital is the city of San Felipe de Puerto Plata.\nName.\nThe province is named after its capital city, Puerto Plata. \nWhen Christopher Columbus visited the northern coast of the Hispaniola island for the first time, on 11 January 1493, he saw a mountain with clouds on its top and he gave it the name of \"Monte de Plata\" (\"Mountain of Silver\"). The town that was founded on the foot of that mountain was called \"Puerto de Plata\" (\"Port of Silver\"); the name was changed later to just \"Puerto Plata\".\nHistory.\nThe first European town, La Isabela, was founded by Columbus in January 1493 by Columbus near the city of Puerto Plata; the city of Puerto Plata was founded in 1502.\nIn 1605, the towns of Puerto Plata along with Monte Cristi, Bayaj\u00e1 and La Yaguana were destroyed by the governor, Antonio de Osorio. All the people living in those towns had to move to places closer to the capital due to the amount of illegal trade happening in these towns. These towns formed what are now Monte Plata and Bayaguana.\nIt was created as a Maritime District (a special administrative category similar to a province and that has been abandoned) in 1865.

It looks like a xylophone but the bars are made of aluminium instead of wood. Like the xylophone, the bars are arranged in a similar way to a piano keyboard so that tunes can be played. An alternate form is the 6-plus-6-system, where each row has the bars in a whole-tone distance and both rows are in a half-tone distance. The player uses mallets (beaters), either one or two in each hand. There are tubes underneath each bar. These are called \"resonators\". They make the sound louder. There is also an electric motor which can be switched on by a pedal. This makes fans go round and round in the ventilators and makes a very strong, vibrating sound. This is why the instrument has its name. Sometimes people call a vibraphone vibes.\nVibraphones were first made in the United States in 1921.\nThe mallets are beaters with a rubber ball at the end. Yarn or a hard cord is wound tightly round these balls. Vibraphone mallets are usually slightly harder than the ones ones used for the marimba. They usually consist of a rubber ball core wrapped in yarn or cord and attached to a narrow dowel, most commonly made of rattan or birch (other materials, such as nylon, are sometimes used). Mallets suitable for the vibraphone are also generally suitable for the marimba. There are different ways of holding them. A common way is to hold them between the thumb and index finger, using the other fingers to help control the sticks. Playing with four mallets is harder, but allows the player to play harmony (chord with four notes).\nSometimes special techniques are used such as \"pitch bending\". This is done by sliding one of the mallets along a bar in a special way. Occasionally players are asked to use a bow such as cello or double bass bow, and bow across the edge of a bar.\nThe vibraphone is used in the orchestra in Alban Berg's opera \"Lulu\". It is also used in works by Olivier Messiaen, Leonard Bernstein, Benjamin Britten and Vaughan Williams (opening of Symphony no 8). Vibraphones are commonly heard in jazz, especially in combos.\nReferences.\nThe Illustrated Encyclopedia of Musical Instruments, K\u00f6nemann; "}

{"id": "180344", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=180344", "title": "Swine influenza", "text": "Swine influenza virus is a virus that is common in pigs. This type of influenza virus can also infect humans and birds. Swine influenza virus is sometimes called SIV or swine flu.\nSwine flu is common in pigs. Normally, it only infects people who have been in close contact with pigs. However, the disease has also spread from one person to another. Swine flu can cause fever, disorientation (not being clear-headed), stiffness of the joints, vomiting, and loss of consciousness. Sometimes this ends in death.\nThere are different types, or strains, of swine flu. They are called H1N1, H1N2, H3N1, H3N2, and H2N3.\nBackground.\nH1N1 came from the Spanish flu, which caused a pandemic in humans in 1918 and 1919. New viruses came from the Spanish flu. These viruses became common in pigs. Every once in a while, the viruses spread from pigs to humans. This has happened during the 20th century. (However, they happened at the same time as the flu epidemics that happen every year. Because of this, it is hard to tell the difference between 'normal' influenza and swine influenza.) Infections that spread from pigs to humans are rare. Scientists only know of 12 known cases in the United States since 2005.\nIt is very difficult to prevent the flu virus. This is because the virus changes all the time. If a person gets the flu, his body forms antibodies to fight that virus off if it happens again. But since the flu virus changes all the time, a person's antibodies do not recognize the virus the next time it happens, because it is different. The same thing happens with vaccines.\nThe changes in the flu virus can cause a flu pandemic. For example, the virus might only change a little bit in about two to three years. After about ten years, most people will have developed antibodies to fight these small changes. But if the virus then changes a lot, there can be a pandemic. Hundreds of millions of people suddenly realize that the antibodies they developed are useless. Even during the Spanish flu pandemic, the first wave of the disease was relatively mild, while the second wave was very deadly.\nIn 1957, an Asian flu pandemic infected about 45 million Americans and killed 70,000. Eleven years later, from 1968 to 1969, the Hong Kong flu pandemic infected 50 million Americans and caused 33,000 deaths. It also cost about $3.9 billion. In 1976, about 500 soldiers became infected with swine flu over a few weeks. However, by the end of the month, investigators found that the virus had \"mysteriously disappeared\", and there were no more signs of swine flu anywhere on the post. There were a small number of isolated (far-apart) cases around the U.S. However, these were in people who were thought to have caught the virus from pigs.\nScientists fear the swine flu virus might mutate, or change, into a pandemic as deadly as the 1918/1919 pandemic. They watched the outbreak in 2009, and made plans about what to do if a global pandemic breaks out.\nSymptoms.\nThe main symptoms of the swine influenza is much the same as regular influenza. Symptoms include vomiting, nausea, runny nose, (loss of appetite), lethargy (feeling tired), chills, fever, body aches, sore throat, coughing, diarrhea, and stomach ache.\nWhere swine influenza is found.\nThe bird flu virus H3N2 is endemic in pigs in China. It has recently been found in pigs in Vietnam. Specialists also think that this might lead to new variations of the influenza virus. Pigs can carry human influenza viruses. These viruses can combine in new ways, and exchange certain genes with H5N1. Through mutation, this would create a form of the virus that can pass easily among humans. H3N2 evolved from H2N2 by antigenic shift. In August 2004, researchers in China found H5N1 in pigs.\nIn 2005 it was discovered that H5N1 could be infecting up to half of the pig population in some areas of Indonesia, but without showing symptoms. Chairul Nidom, a virologist at Airlangga University's tropical disease center in Surabaya, East Java, did some independent research: he tested the blood of 10 apparently healthy pigs housed near poultry farms in West Java where avian flu had broken out, \"Nature\" reported. Five of the pig samples contained the H5N1 virus. The Indonesian government has since found similar results in the same region. Additional tests of 150 pigs outside the area were negative.\nSwine Flu in Humans.\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a United States government agency, reports that the symptoms and transmission of the swine flu from human to human is much like seasonal flu. Usually, the symptoms are fever, lethargy (feeling tired), lack of appetite and coughing. Some people with swine flu also have reported runny nose, sore throat, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. It is believed to be spread between humans when an infected person coughs or sneezes and then touches something. Another person then might touch the same thing with the virus on it and then touch their own nose or mouth. The swine flu in humans is most contagious during the first five days of the illness although some people, most commonly children, can be contagious for up to ten days. Diagnosis can be made by sending a specimen (sample), collected during the first five days, to the CDC for analysis.\nThe Swine Flu is susceptible to four licensed drugs in the United States, amantadine, rimantadine, oseltamivir and zanamivir. However, for the 2009 outbreak, it is recommended it be treated with oseltamivir and zanamivir. The vaccine for the human seasonal flu does not protect against the swine flu. Even if the virus strains are the same specific variety, the antigenicity is very different.\nVeterinary swine flu vaccine.\nThe virus has evolved in recent decades. This has made Swine influenza a bigger problem, mainly because traditional vaccines against influenza do not always work against Swine influenza. There are special vaccines against Swine influenza, but they only work if the virus strain is similar to some extent. In the cases more difficult to treat, special vaccines are produced. These are very similar, as they are made to match the specific virus strain.\nPresent vaccination strategies for SIV control and prevention in swine farms, typically include the use of one of several bivalent SIV vaccines commercially available in the United States. Of the 97 recent H3N2 isolates examined, only 41 isolates had strong serologic cross-reactions with antiserum to three commercial SIV vaccines. Since the protective ability of influenza vaccines depends primarily on the closeness of the match between the vaccine virus and the epidemic virus, the presence of non-reactive H3N2 SIV variants suggests that current commercial vaccines might not effectively protect pigs from infection with a majority of H3N2 viruses.\nThe current vaccine against the seasonal influenza strain H1N1 is thought unlikely to provide protection. The director of CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases said that the United States' cases were found to be made up of genetic elements from four different flu viruses\u2014North American swine influenza, North American avian influenza, human influenza A virus subtype H1N1, and swine influenza virus typically found in Asia and Europe. On two cases, a complete genome sequence had been obtained. She said that the virus is resistant to amantadine and rimantadine, but susceptible to oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza).\n2009 outbreak (Swine flu).\nA new strain of swine influenza A called H1N1 was responsible for the swine flu outbreak in 2009 in humans. It came from a combination of several strains of influenza in humans and influenza in birds and swine influenza. Tests were done. Testers found that the hemagglutinin (HA) gene was similar to that of swine flu viruses that had already been found in pigs in the United States since 1999, but the neuraminidase (NA) and matrix protein (M) genes resembled versions in European swine. Viruses that were built like this had not been found in humans or pigs before. There is no program to monitor what viruses are circulating in pigs in the United States, however it began in Mexico, North America.\nLegacy in WHO guidelines.\nIn 2009, the government of Egypt ordered over 300,000 pigs killed to prevent the spread of H1N1, even though experts said the pigs were not going to spread H1N1 anyway. Most of the pigs' owners were not paid for their dead pigs.\nIn 2015, the World Health Organization made itself some rules for naming viruses: No official name is allowed to refer to a place, person or animal. This is to prevent stigma, or blame. The WHO rules list \"swine flu\" as an example of what not to do when naming a virus or disease.\nFurther reading.\nSwine Flu h1n1"}

By answering the questions, people can learn about how they tend to make choices. They can also learn about how they view the world. After answering the questions in the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, people are placed in one of sixteen groups. These groups are based on theories by Carl Gustav Jung in his book \"Psychological Types\" (1921).\nKatharine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers created the first set of questions during World War II. The set of questions was made to help women who were working for the first time. Katharine Cook Briggs and Isabel Briggs Meyers thought that the set of questions would help women be happier and work better. The set of questions has grown into the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. The MBTI that we use today was created in 1962.\nThough there are sixteen types, it is stated that there is no best type. The types are considered all equal.\nTyping.\nOutlooks: extraversion / introversion.\nThe MBTI measures four things. The first is extraversion (E) and introversion (I). Extraverts are people who get energy from the outside world. Extraverts like to spend their time with other people. Introverts are people who get energy from the inside world. Introverts tend to get energy from thinking and reflecting.\nInformation gathering: sensing / intuition.\nThe second measure is sensing (S) and intuition (N). Sensing and intuition are ways of gathering information. People who are sensing trust facts. Sensing people accept things if they can see, hear, touch, taste, or smell them. People who tend to like intuition are more likely to accept outcomes based on other people and meanings that cannot be tested.\nDecision making: thinking / feeling.\nThe third measure is thinking (T) and feeling (F). Thinking and feeling are ways that people make decisions. Those who prefer thinking tend to make decisions alone. They heavily weigh reason, good sense, order, and cause and effect. Those who prefer feeling are more likely to think of the effect that a decision may have on other people. They tend to try to gain balance and agreement with everyone that is involved.\nThose who prefer thinking do not \u201cthink better\u201d than those who prefer Feeling, and those who prefer feeling do not make decisions based only on people.\nDealing with others: judging / perceiving.\nThe last measure is of judging (J) and perceiving (P). Judging and perceiving detail how people deal with the outside world. A person who likes Judging tends to report that they use Thinking or feeling to deal with the outside world. A person who likes perceiving tends to report that they use sensing or intuition to deal with the outside world.\nThe full type.\nA Myers Briggs type is made up of each of the preferences above. For example an ESTJ would be a person who prefers extraversion, sensing, thinking, and judging. An INFP would be a person who prefers introversion, intuition, feeling, and perceiving."}

Today, it is known as one of the first books about feminism. In the 18th century, some people thought that women should not get a formal education. Wollstonecraft wrote this work as a reply to them. She says that women should have an education that fits their position in society. She says women are very important to the nation, because it is women who usually educate their children. She says that an educated woman can also be companions to their husbands, rather than just uneducated wives. Wollstonecraft does not see women as ornaments to society, or property to be traded in marriage. She argues that they are human beings, and therefore deserve the same basic rights men have.\nIn 1791, Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord wrote a report to the French National Assembly. In this report, he argued, that women should only receive a very basic education. \nWollstonecraft used this report to write her reply. She also led an attack on the sexual double standards the society of the day had. She also indicted men for encouraging women to indulge in lots of emotion. Wollstonecraft wrote the \"Rights of Woman\" quickly so that she could directly respond to ongoing events; she wanted to write a more thoughtful second volume, but died before doing so.\nWollstonecraft calls for equality between the sexes in particular areas of life, such as morality, but she does not write that men and women are equal in all things. This has made it difficult to classify Wollstonecraft as a modern feminist as they believe men and women are equal in all things. She could not use either the word or the concept of \"feminism\", because they were only developed later. Today, many people believe that her work was not received well, but this may be wrong. People who believe this also believe that Wollstonecraft was as reviled during her lifetime as she became after the publication of William Godwin's \"Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman\" (1798). However, the \"Rights of Woman\" was actually well-received when it was first published in 1792. One biographer has called it \"perhaps the most original book of [Wollstonecraft's] century\"."}

They are over 50 species, and they live worldwide in warm waters. They can glide in the air just above the water. They are all small, with a maximum length of about 45 cm (18 inches), and have winglike, rigid fins and an unevenly forked tail. \nThey do not fly actively: their fins do not flap. What they do is speed towards the surface and keep on going. When they leave the water they glide, sometimes for a surprising distance. It is generally thought to be an adaptation which helps them escape predators.\nThe glides are usually up to in length. Some have been observed soaring for hundreds of metres using the updraft on the leading edges of waves. The fish can also make a series of glides, each time dipping the tail into the water to produce forward thrust. The longest recorded series of glides, with the fish only periodically dipping its tail in the water, was for 45 seconds.\nIt has been suggested that the genus \"Exocoetus\" is on an evolutionary borderline between flight and gliding. It flaps its enlarged pectoral fins when airborne, but still seems only to glide, as there is no hint of a power stroke.\nThe earliest known flying fish were in the Middle Triassic."}

It is promoted by Transport for London and is valid on a number of different travel systems across London including London Underground, buses, the Docklands Light Railway (DLR), London Overground, trams, some river boat services and most National Rail services within the London Fare Zones. More importantly, it is very similar to Travelcard, a branch from the original London's e-payment cards.\nA standard Oyster card is a blue credit card-sized stored value card which can hold a variety of single tickets, period tickets and travel permits which must be added to the card prior to travel. It is also a contactless smart card which passengers must touch onto an electronic reader when entering and leaving the transport system in order to validate it or deduct funds. The cards may be \"recharged\" in person from numerous sales points, by recurring payment authority or by online purchase. The card is designed to reduce the number of transactions at ticket offices and the number of single paper tickets sold on the London transport network. Use is encouraged by offering substantially cheaper fares on Oyster than payment with cash.\nThe card was first issued to the public in July 2003 with a limited range of features and there continues to be a phased introduction of further functions. By June 2010, over 34\u00a0million Oyster cards had been issued and more than 80% of all journeys on services run by Transport for London used the Oyster card."}

They are discs made of copper, bronze or a special alloy. They look rather like saucepan lids, but in the middle they jut out a little and they have straps there that pass through a hole.\nThere are two ways of playing cymbals. One way is to use a pair of cymbals that are the same. The player holds one cymbal in each hand, holding them by the strap. He then bangs the cymbals together. There are many ways of doing this depending on the sort of sound that is wanted. For example, a very quiet sound can be made by rubbing the edges of the cymbals together. A very loud sound can be made by hitting them together as the arms form a circle, and letting the cymbals vibrate for a long time by holding them in the air.\nAnother way of playing the cymbal is to use just one cymbal, and to hang it on a stand. It can then be played with a beater, stick or wire brush. It can be hit at the edge, in the middle, or half way between, depending on the sound that is wanted.\nCymbals are made in different sizes. Some may be just 25\u00a0cm across, large ones may be up to 60\u00a0cm across. Cymbals do not normally give any particular pitch. There are, however, small ones based on an old form of cymbal which are called \u201ccrotales\u201d. There are also Chinese cymbals which have a turned-up edge.\nCymbals are used in many different musical groups. They are heard in an orchestra, in jazz groups, percussion groups and bands, including marching bands. A drum kit always has at least one cymbal. This may be a \u201ccrash cymbal\u201d (on the top of a stand) or a pair of hi-hats (a pair of small cymbals operated by pressing a pedal with the foot.\nOrigins.\nThe word cymbals comes from the Latin \"cymbalum\", which itself comes from the Greek word \"kumbalom\", meaning a small bowl. It was used in many ancient cultures including Egyptian civilisations.\nOrchestral cymbals.\nCymbals are often used in orchestras. The first composer to use them was probably Joseph Haydn in his \u201cMilitary Symphony\u201d (1794). They are often used when there is a big climax (for example in the \u201cAcademic Festival Overture\u201d by Johannes Brahms, but they can also sometimes be played very quietly. Sometimes players should let the cymbal vibrate for a long time after a big crash, but at other times he may have to hold the cymbals against his body quickly to stop the noise. This is called \u201cdamping\u201d the sound.\nCymbals have traditionally often been played together with the bass drum. This makes a \"crash-bang-wallop\" noise.\nReferences.\n\"The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Musical Instruments\" by K\u00f6nemann; "}

It is also the name of a committee area of the Scottish Borders Council. Berwickshire is on the boundary of Scotland with England. It is named after Berwick-upon-Tweed, but Scotland lost Berwick to England in 1482.\nBerwickshire's first county town was the Royal Burgh of Berwick-upon-Tweed. In 1482 England seized Berwick. After that the shire's business was done at Duns or Lauder until Greenlaw became the county town in 1596.\nA Sheriff Court sits in Duns.\nLocal government.\nBerwickshire County Council, like all the County Councils in Scotland, was made in 1890. The Council met in Duns. Berwickshire County Council was ended in 1975.\nIn 1975 a new Borders Region was made.

Berwickshire District Council was ended in 1996.\nBerwickshire is now all in the Scottish Borders Council Area.\nCoat of arms.\nIn 1890, when Berwickshire County Council was made, the Council asked the Lord Lyon King of Arms to give them a shield and arms. He gave a shield and arms to the County Council on 10 October 1890.\nThe shield shows a bear chained to a wych-elm tree. The bear and wych-elm are part of Berwick upon Tweed\u2019s shield because they sound like the town\u2019s name.\nOn 12 November 1975 the Lord Lyon gave the arms again to Berwickshire District Council.

It spans across Torrance Boulevard at Bow Street, a short distance west of Western Avenue. It was once part of the north/south Torrance to San Pedro spur line of the Pacific Electric Railway. The line was the railroad's first interurban line to San Pedro. After splitting off to the east from the Union Tool Company plant which was once a short distance south of the bridge, the line ended at a Columbia Steel steel mill (later United States Steel) by running up and over the east/west Torrance local line. It is the only part of the PE which crossed itself this way. This was due to the area's geography. If the railroad simply built a spur off of the main line, it would have meant that trains trying to get to the steel mill would have faced too steep a climb. The steel mill has since been torn down to make way for the national headquarters of American Honda Motor Company, but the remaining part of the Torrance line - which once had two separate tracks - was rebuilt in 2003 and is still in use for local train runs by the Union Pacific Railroad. Gone too are the Pacific Electric's Torrance shops at the western branch of the split, now the site of an industrial park and which still receives trains on the local line.\nThe bridge was designed by Irving Gill and was built in 1913 as part of the original layout of the city as drawn up by Jared Sidney Torrance and Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr.. It became the city's second entry in the National Register of Historic Places on July 13, 1989 after Torrance High School. It is also listed with the California Office of Historic Preservation.\nThough tracks and track parts remain on the bridge, it is no longer in use nor has it been for quite some time. There is no chance of the bridge ever being used to carry trains again, since the right-of-way at either end has been changed and the tracks removed. Even so, the Pacific Electric Railroad Bridge has become a symbol of the city as part of the Torrance Police Department's logo as of January 1, 2000, only the third such change in the department's history.

Anglerfish light their rod with bioluminescence (their own light) and then wiggle it to mimic a small marine animal. When other creatures come to eat the small marine animal, the anglerfish eats them. They are called anglerfish because they catch fish with bait, just like anglers, who use a rod and line (rather than nets).\nOne of the families, the Ceratiidae, has an extraordinary mating system where the male actually fuses into the female.\nEvolution.\nA mitochondrial genome phylogenetic study suggested that anglerfishes diversified in a short period of the Lower Cretaceous, between 130 and 100 million years ago."}

They include five genera: Influenzavirus A, Influenzavirus B, Influenzavirus C, Thogotovirus and Isavirus. The first three genera contain viruses that cause influenza in vertebrates, including birds (see also avian influenza), humans, and other mammals. Isaviruses infect salmon; thogotoviruses infect vertebrates and invertebrates, such as mosquitoes and sea lice.\nThe three genera of Influenzavirus can be told apart by the structure of their proteins. They infect vertebrates, as follows:\nTypes.\nThere are three genera of influenza virus: Influenzavirus A, Influenzavirus B and Influenzavirus C. Each genus includes only one species, or type: Influenza A virus, Influenza B virus, and Influenza C virus, respectively. Influenza A and C infect multiple species, while influenza B almost exclusively infects humans.\nInfluenza A.\nInfluenza A viruses are further classified, based on the viral surface proteins hemagglutinin (HA or H) and neuraminidase (NA or N). Eighteen H subtypes (or serotypes) and eleven N subtypes of influenza A virus have been identified.\nFurther variation exists; thus, specific influenza strain isolates are identified by a standard nomenclature specifying virus type, geographical location where first isolated, sequential number of isolation, year of isolation, and HA and NA subtype.\nExamples of the nomenclature are: \nThe type A viruses are the most virulent human pathogens among the three influenza types and causes the most severe disease. The serotypes that have been confirmed in humans, ordered by the number of known human pandemic deaths, are:\nInfluenza B.\nInfluenza B virus is almost exclusively a human pathogen, and is less common than influenza A. The only other animal known to be susceptible to influenza B infection is the seal. This type of influenza mutates at a rate 2-3 times lower than type A and consequently is less genetically diverse, with only one influenza B serotype. As a result of this lack of antigenic diversity, a degree of immunity to influenza B is usually acquired at an early age. However, influenza B mutates enough that lasting immunity is not possible. This reduced rate of antigenic change, combined with its limited host range (inhibiting cross species antigenic shift), ensures that pandemics of influenza B do not occur.\nInfluenza C.\nThe influenza C virus infects humans and pigs, and can cause severe illness and local epidemics. However, influenza C is less common than the other types and usually seems to cause mild disease in children."}

Wagner wrote both the words and the music. It is based on an old German legend.\nOrigins of the story.\n\"Lohengrin\" is a story written by an unknown German author. It is related to other stories that belong to the Knight of the Swan tradition.\nWagner\u2019s opera is like a fairy tale. It immediately became very popular. The young King Ludwig II of Bavaria built a fairy-tale castle in the south of Germany and called it \"Neuschwanstein,\" meaning: \u201cNew Swan Stone\u201d. The King was very fond of Wagner\u2019s music and gave him a lot of money to help him with his next operas, especially for the cycle known as the \"Ring of the Nibelung\".\nIt was first performed in Weimar, Germany on 28 August 1850 with Franz Liszt conducting. Liszt chose to conduct it on that particular day because 28 August was the birthday of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe who had lived in Weimar.\nWagner did not hear the first performance. In May 1849 he had run away from Germany because he had been involved in a revolution. He fled to Switzerland. He did not hear his opera \"Lohengrin\" until 15 May 1861 when he saw a performance in Vienna.\nThe story.\nAct 1.\nThe opera starts with a prelude played by the orchestra. It describes an angel coming down from the sky with the Holy Grail.\nKing Henry the Fowler has arrived in Brabant. He is sitting by the banks of the river Scheldt. Around him are Counts and nobles of the Saxon army. Opposite them are Counts and nobles of Brabant. King Henry explains that he had been fighting Hungarians who came to invade his country. They had agreed not to fight for nine years, but these nine years were now coming to an end and his men would have to fight again. The King wants the Brabantines to help them. He asks one of their bravest knights, Friedrich von Telramund, to explain why the Brabantines are arguing amongst themselves.\nCount Telramund explains that the Duke of Brabant had recently died. As he lay dying, he had asked Telramund to look after his daughter Elsa and his son Gottfried. One day the two children had gone into the forest and Elsa had returned alone. The Duke tried to find out what had happened to Gottfried. The Duke\u2019s wife Ortrud persuades the Duke to accuse Elsa of murdering her brother. The duke then makes himself the king of Brabant.\nElsa knows that she is innocent and asks God to be her judge. She needs a knight to fight for her. Telramund agrees to fight him.\nThe second time that the Herald calls the unknown knight, a miracle happens. A boat, pulled by a swan, appears. A knight in shining armour stands in the boat. He gets out of the boat, tells the swan that it can go, and then he greets the king. He asks Elsa if he can be her knight. Elsa kneels in front of him and asks for his help. He says that he will serve her, but he asks one thing: that she should never ask him what his name is or where he comes from. Elsa agrees. Everyone, except for Ortrud, prays and the fight starts. The unknown knight wins, but then he spares Telramund\u2019s life. The unknown knight now takes Elsa\u2019s hand and asks her to marry him.\nAct 2.\nThe action takes place in the courtyard outside the cathedral. It is night. Telramund and Ortrud have been told to go away. Ortrud is a heathen witch, the daughter of Radbod, the Duke of Frisia. She tries to make Telramund brave again. She is going to persuade Elsa to ask the unknown knight what is name is.\nWhen Elsa comes onto the balcony in the morning she sees Ortrud and feels sorry for her. An announcement is made that the king has decided to give the unnamed knight the title of Duke of Brabant. He says he does not want the title, and prefers to be known just as \"Guardian of Brabant.\"\nThe King, the Knight, Elsa and her attendants are about to go into the church. Ortrud, beautifully dressed, appears and says that the knight is a magician. Telramund appears and says that the result of the fight he had did not count, because the knight has not told his name. The knight still refuses to tell his name.\nAct 3.\nThe bedroom of the young couple. Elsa and her new husband enter to the well-known music called the Bridal Chorus. The couple say they love one another. However, Elsa still remembers how Ortrud was pressing her to ask the Knight his name. She asks him who he is. Telramund and four of his friends rush into the room to attack the knight, but Telramund is killed instead. The Knight is very sad and tells Elsa they will now go to the King and he will tell him who he is.\nThe scene changes to the banks of the river, as in Act I. The army is ready for war. Telramund\u2019s dead body is carried in. The Knight explains why he killed Telramund. He tells the story of the Holy Grail and says that he is Lohengrin, Knight of the Holy Grail and son of King Parsifal. He says that he now has to return to his home. He had only stayed so long so that he could prove that Elsa was innocent.\nSadly he says goodbye to his young wife. The swan comes again. Lohengrin prays that Elsa may get her lost brother back. The swan dives into the river and appears again in the form of Gottfried, Elsa\u2019s brother. He had been turned into a swan by the evil magic of Ortrud.\nA dove comes down from heaven, and takes the place of the swan at the head of the boat. It takes Lohengrin to the castle of the Holy Grail. Elsa is so upset that she dies.\nReferences.\n\"Wagner Nights\" by Ernest Newman (1949)"}

He was born in the J\u00e6ren district of Rogaland, Norway, as the son of \u00deorvaldr \u00c1svaldsson (Thorvald Asvaldsson). He therefore also appears, patronymically, as Erik Thorvaldsson (or as Eir\u00edkr \u00deorvaldsson). His nickname, \"the Red\", most likely refers to his hair color.\nErik the Red was born in Stavanger, Norway. His father, Thorvald Asvaldsson, murdered a man, so the family was exiled to Iceland. Erik also got into some trouble in Iceland, and was exiled in 982. Erik had heard of the travels of Gunnbj\u00f6rn Ulfsson, who discovered some islands west of Iceland. Erik decided to explore these islands, and found land at a place he named Midj\u00f6kull. But the weather there was very harsh, so Erik left and continued south, reaching land again at an island he named Erik\u2019s Island. Erik spent his winter, as well as the following one, at Erik\u2019s Island. Erik was no longer exiled from Iceland, so he returned the summer of 985. But when the fights with his neighbors began again, Erik decided to start advertising his new found land. He called his land Greenland, to make it sound nicer than it actually was.\nHe left Iceland in 986 with 25 ships, but only 14 survived the journey, with about 400-500 people and animals. The ships settled at Brattahlid. There were two established settlements; the Eastern Settlement on the coast on the southwest, and the Western Settlement 300 miles above that Settlement. He lived in the colony in Eriksfjord, and was the chief leader of both settlements. The people that lived in the settlements farmed land, raised animals like cows, pigs, and lamb, and hunted many animals. Erik\u2019s wife Thjodhild became a believer in Christ, and she built the initial church in Greenland. However, Eric didn\u2019t convert to Christianity.\nLater, he wanted to go on an expedition west of Greenland, in search of land. He did not go because he fell off his horse, and saw this as a symbol of bad luck. In around 1000, Leif Erikson, his son conducted what was most likely the first trip made to the North American mainland."}

It is from the state capital, Sydney. In 2006 there were 161 people living at Tibooburra. Tibooburra is the hottest place in New South Wales. The name \"Tibooburra\" comes from the indigenous Australian word for \"place of granites.\"\nTibooburra is a small and very remote town, but fuel, meals and several different places to stay are available. It is north of Broken Hill.\nNew South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service have an Information Centre in the town. There is also a police station.\nHistory.\nExplorer Charles Sturt was one of the first Europeans to visit the area in 1844. He spent six months trapped by drought at Depot Glen, south of Tibooburra. He then tried to travel north west but was stopped by the desert. Burke and Wills also went through the area in 1861 on their journey north towards the Gulf of Carpentaria. It was the search for Burke and Wills that led to the opening up of the country for the farming and grazing. \nThe town began during the gold rush to the nearby \"Albert Goldfields\". Gold was found in the area around Tibooburra in the 1880s. The town was first called called \"The Granites\". Many of the buildings are built from stone, such as the courthouse built in 1888.\nAustralian artist Clifton Pugh was often stayed at the Family Hotel (1882) in Tibooburra. He painted a number of murals, drawings and sketches on the inside wall of the hotel.\nTourist attractions.\nThe main tourist attraction is Sturt National Park, and Cameron's Corner, where the border lines of the states of Queensland, South Australia and New South Wales meet. Cameron's Corner has a hotel which also has fuel and some basic accommodation. \nClimate.\nTibooburra has a dry, hot, desert climate with temperatures above 40\u00b0 Celsius (104 \u00b0F) in summer, often reaching as high as 47 \u00b0C (117 \u00b0F). Temperatures are milder in winter, about 20 \u00b0C (68 \u00b0F) in the daytime. Tibooburra is the hottest town in New South Wales. There is little rainfall during the year. In March 1949 and January 1974, the town received around or twice its average annual rainfall. In its driest year of 1940, only fell for the whole year.\nTibooburra Outback School of the Air.\nTibooburra Outback School of the Air is the town's only school, teaching both local children and the children of property owners in the area. It started as a Distance Education Centre in 1991. Before this, children on properties were educated through central schools in towns such as Broken Hill. The school was begun in 1886. No high school exists in the town. Children travel to the nearest high school, do home school, or attend boarding schools.\nThree or four times each year, students from distant properties attend a 'mini-school' at the school. Mini-schools usually have themes (such as pirates or the circus) and have of a range of fun and educational activities. Out of town families also receive two home visits a year, in which a teacher (or teachers) and students visit and spend the day on the property.\nIn 2004 the school changed from radio based education to the Satellite Education Program."}

There is only a tiny population in the Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve, in Victoria, Australia. The helmeted honeyeater became the state of Victoria's official bird emblem in 1971.\nFamous ornithologist, John Gould first described the bird as being a separate species, which he named \"Ptilotis cassidix\" in 1867. It now one of the three sub-species of the yellow-tufted honeyeater, \"Lichenostomus melanops\". The other sub-species are not endangered.\nWhere the bird lives.\nThis bird is only found in a five km long patch of forest along two streams in the Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve, 50\u00a0km east of Melbourne. A reserve was set up in the Bunyip State Park for releasing birds raised in captivity. In 2003 there were 103 individuals in the wild with 20 breeding pairs known as well as a further 34 birds in captivity at the Healesville Sanctuary. The 2009 Victorian bushfires burnt to within 200 metres of bird colony at Bunyip State Park. Captive birds had to be moved to the Melbourne Zoo when the fires also came close to the Healesville Sanctuary. However, on April 28, 2009, 13 birds bred in captivity were released back into the wild. The number of wild birds is now believed to be 113.\nBefore the captive breeding program was started there were only about 5060 birds left in the wild. The birds have been bred at Healesville and at Sydney's Taronga Park Zoo.\nDescription.\nThe Helmeted honeyeater is about 20 centimetres (8 inches) long. Their colour can be anywhere from black to olive green. They have a yellow patch on the heads.\nWhat they eat.\nHelmeted honeyeaters eat manna, which is like a sap from some eucalyptus trees. They also eat nectar from the eucalypt flowers as well as small insects and spiders.\nSaving the helmeted honeyeater.\nSeveral things are being done to save this bird from becoming extinct. One is a captive breeding program, where the birds are bred at Healesville and Toronga Park. When they become old enough, between 6\u20148 months, the are put into the wild where they will hopefully begin breeding. Forest areas are being planted with the right sort of trees and plants to provide the birds with food and shelter. This is being done on private land as well as in the State parks. There is also planting to join the small patches of bush with corridors so the birds are not trapped in one small area."}

It is made up of five business divisions:\nNational Fuel Gas was incorporated in 1902 and is based in Williamsville, New York.\nThe Utility division sells natural gas or moves natural gas from one part of the country to another. The Pipeline and Storage division provides interstate natural gas transportation and storage services for related and non-related companies. The Exploration and Production division prospects for and extracts natural gas and oil from the ground. The Energy Marketing division markets natural gas to industrial, commercial, government, and residential customers. The Timber division markets wood from its New York and Pennsylvania forests, and it owns two sawmills in northwestern Pennsylvania, to cut wood into useful sizes and treat it with chemicals to make it last longer.\nHistory.\nNational Fuel Gas was one of the first gas utility companies in the United States, and so they have been the first to create some new technologies. Engineers at the company discovered that empty underground gas fields could be used to store gas that has been taken from the ground somewhere else. Thus, the first such storage facility in the US was set up at Zoar Field, about forty miles south of Buffalo. This turned out to be a good financial decision for NFG in the 1940s and 50s, when increased demand for natural gas led to long pipelines in the eastern states being connected to new pipelines and fields in the southwestern states. NFG could then buy huge amounts of cheaper summer gas from the southwest, pipe it to the New York storage fields, pump it down into the ground, then take it back out when demand and prices went up in the winter months.\nThe company was also the first in the industry to make a gas-fired generator to electrify pipelines so they wouldn't corrode so much. (Natural gas can eat away at metal, over time.)\nIn 1975, with the introduction of \"Balanced Billing\", the company claimed that it was \"the only gas utility in the country\" with a flexible plan for customers to pay bills in eleven equal monthly payments, with settlement of any overpayment or underpayment in the twelfth month. This is a sort of system of installment credit.\nShareholder information.\nNational Fuel Gas Co. is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol NFG.

More specifically, an isomorphism is a function between two structures that preserves the relationships between the parts. To indicate isomorphism between two structures formula_1 and formula_2, one often writes formula_3. \nUsing the language of category theory, this means that morphisms map to morphisms without breaking composition. An isomorphism is also a homomorphism that is one-to-one. \nAs an example, one can consider the operation of adding integers Z. The doubling function \u03c6(x) = 2x maps elements of Z to elements of the even integers 2Z. Since \u03c6(a+b) = 2(a+b) = 2a+2b = \u03c6(a)+\u03c6(b), adding in Z is structurally identical as adding in 2Z (which makes this an example of isomorphism)."}

It is the basis for believing in the expansion of the universe and is evidence often cited in support of the Big Bang model.\nAlthough widely attributed to Edwin Hubble, the law was first derived from the General Relativity equations by Georges Lema\u00eetre in a 1927 article. There he proposed that the Universe is expanding, and suggested a value for the rate of expansion, now called the Hubble constant. Two years later Edwin Hubble confirmed the existence of that law and determined a more accurate value for the constant that now bears his name. The recession velocity of the objects was inferred from their redshifts, many measured earlier by Vesto Slipher in 1917 and related to velocity by him. \nThe law is often expressed by the equation , with \"H\"0 the constant of proportionality (the Hubble constant) between the \"proper distance\" \"D\" to a galaxy and its velocity \"v\" (see \"Uses of the proper distance\"). \"H\"0 is usually quoted in (km/s)/Mpc, which gives the speed in km/s of a galaxy away.

He was born Hungarian and became a naturalized American. He is particularly remembered for his work with the Cleveland Orchestra which he made into one of the world\u2019s finest orchestras.\nLife.\nEarly years.\nGeorge (originally \u201cGeorg\u201d) Szell was born in Budapest, Hungary and grew up in Vienna, Austria. His music teachers included Mandyczewski, who had been a friend of Brahms, and Max Reger who taught him composition. He was an excellent pianist and was only 11 when he first performed in public, playing one of his own compositions. He started touring Europe. He was only 16 when he conducted the orchestra of the Vienna Court Opera (now the Vienna Philharmonic) and 17 when he appeared with the Berlin Philharmonic, both as pianist and conducting his own music.\nSzell soon realized that what he wanted to do most was to conduct. He stopped composing, although he kept up his piano playing until the end of his life. Richard Strauss got him some work with the Berlin Staatsoper in 1915. He conducted in several German opera houses, including Darmstadt, D\u00fcsseldorf, again in Berlin from 1924-1929 and then Prague (1929-1937). He first conducted in the United States in 1930 with the Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra. At this time he was better known as an opera conductor than as a conductor of orchestral concerts.\nYears in the U.S.A..\nWhen World War II started in 1939 Szell was in the U.S. on his way to Europe after having toured Australia. He stayed in the U.S. and settled with his family in New York City. At first he earned a living as a teacher, but he soon began to get invitations to conduct. He conducted the NBC Symphony Orchestra in 1941. From 1942 he often conducted the Metropolitan Opera, and the following year he appeared with the New York Philharmonic. In 1946 he became a naturalized citizen of the United States.\nIn 1946 Szell got the job he was to keep for the rest of his life: Music Director of the Cleveland Orchestra. This orchestra had suffered because of the war and needed someone strong to turn it into a good orchestra. Szell agreed to do this so long as they always did exactly what he wanted.\nSzell was a very strict conductor. In rehearsals he made them work very hard at every tiny detail. Like Toscanini, he was absolutely ruthless. If he thought that a musician had made some mistakes, that musician would be fired (lose his job). If anyone questioned what Szell was doing he would be fired. He even showed the cleaner the proper way to mop the floor.\nBy the end of the 1950s the Cleveland Orchestra had become famous for its precise playing. It had become one of the greatest orchestras in America and Europe. They toured in the U.S. and to Europe, the Soviet Union, Australia and Japan.\nConducting style.\nSzell\u2019s strictness in his conducting was well known. He was, however, an excellent musician, and the members of the orchestra who managed to keep their jobs were delighted with the standard of their playing. They said that he praised them when they were good, and did not keep on rehearsing once the piece was perfect. Szell never showed off when conducting, he never made the music sound sentimental. Like Toscanini, he thought that a conductor should do exactly what the composer had written in the score, without adding his own personal feelings to the music. Some critics thought that his Mozart sounded a bit too lacking in feeling, but Szell said \u201cI cannot pour chocolate sauce over asparagus\u201d. He conducted music by the main central-European composers: Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Schumann and Brahms, Bruckner, Mahler and Strauss. He also conducted some modern music, particularly by Dutilleux, Walton, Prokofiev, Hindemith and Bart\u00f3k. He encouraged Pierre Boulez to conduct the Cleveland Orchestra.\nAfter World War II Szell often conducted other famous orchestras, including the Concertgebouw Orchestra, the London Symphony Orchestra, the Vienna Philharmonic, the New York Philharmonic and at the Salzburg Festival.\nPersonal life.\nSzell married Olga Band in 1920. They were divorced in 1926. In 1938 he married Helene Schultz Teltsch. Their marriage lasted until his death.\nWhen Szell was not working he enjoyed cooking. He also liked driving cars. Although he could have been driven to his concerts by a chauffeur, he often preferred to drive his Cadillac himself.\nHe died in Cleveland, Ohio in 1970.\nReferences.\nThe New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, ed.

Successive dynasties based in China ruled Vietnam directly for most of the period from 207 BC until 938 when Vietnam regained its independence. Vietnam remained a tributary state to its larger neighbor China for much of its history but repelled invasions by the Chinese as well as three invasions by the Mongols between 1255 and 1285. Emperor Tr\u1ea7n Nh\u00e2n T\u00f4ng later diplomatically submitted Vietnam to a tributary of the Yuan to avoid further conflicts. The independent period temporarily ended in the middle to late 19th century, when the country was colonized by France (see French Indochina). During World War II, Imperial Japan expelled the French to occupy Vietnam, though they retained French administrators during their occupation. After the war, France attempted to re-establish its colonial rule but ultimately failed in the First Indochina War. The Geneva Accords partitioned the country in two with a promise of democratic election to reunite the country.\nHowever, rather than peaceful reunification, partition led to the Vietnam War. During this time, the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union supported the North while the United States supported the South. After millions of Vietnamese deaths, the war ended with the fall of Saigon to the North in April 1975. The reunified Vietnam suffered further internal repression and was isolated internationally due to the continuing Cold War and the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia. In 1986, the Communist Party of Vietnam changed its economic policy and began reforms of the private sector similar to those in China. Since the mid-1980s, Vietnam has enjoyed substantial economic growth and some reduction in political repression, though reports of corruption have also risen.\nEarly kingdoms.\nEvidence of the earliest established society other than the prehistoric Iron Age \u0110\u00f4ng S\u01a1n culture in Northern Vietnam was found in C\u1ed5 Loa, an ancient city situated near present-day H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i. \nAccording to myth, the first Vietnamese people were descended from the Dragon Lord L\u1ea1c Long Qu\u00e2n and the Immortal Fairy \u00c2u C\u01a1. L\u1ea1c Long Qu\u00e2n and \u00c2u C\u01a1 had 100 sons before deciding to part ways. 50 of the children went with their mother to the mountains, and the other 50 went with their father to the sea. The eldest son became the first in a line of early Vietnamese kings, collectively known as the H\u00f9ng kings (H\u00f9ng V\u01b0\u01a1ng or the H\u1ed3ng B\u00e0ng Dynasty). The H\u00f9ng kings called their country, located on the Red River delta in present-day northern Vietnam, V\u0103n Lang. The people of V\u0103n Lang were known as the L\u1ea1c Vi\u1ec7t."}

She was married to him from 1879 until he died in 1890. After his death, she became Queen-Regent of the Netherlands because her daughter Wilhelmina was only 10 when her father died, and too young to reign.\nEarly life.\nEmma was the fourth of seven children. Her father was George Victor, king of Waldeck and Pyrmont, and her mother was Helena, Princess of Nassau-Weilburg. Her grandmother on her father's side, Emma of Anhalt-Bernburg-Schaumburg-Hoym, was a grandchild of princess Carolina of Orange-Nassau and Karel Christiaan of Nassau-Weilburg. Her grandfather on her mother's side, Willem of Nassau-Weilburg, was also their grandchild. This means that Emma was related to the House of Orange-Nassau through two family connections.\nThe princess grew up in Schloss Arolsen in Germany. Her daughter, the later Queen Wilhelmina wrote in her autobiography that her mother's home life was very modern and well informed for that time.\nHer husband, William III.\nThe king was married before, to his cousin Sophie of W\u00fcrttemberg. She died in 1877. Their marriage was unhappy, they had lived apart since 1855. William III had a few relationships outside his first marriage. The newspapers even reported on his relationships with the American barmaid Elisa Parker and the opera singer Leonora d'Ambre from Paris.\nAfter Sophie died, and the sons did not marry anyone, William thought it best to re-marry. That way, the family name of Orange would not die out. He met Sophie after going to her house to meet her older sister Pauline. He had also looked into marrying his niece Elisabeth van Saksen-Weimar-Eisenach.\nWhen they were engaged in September 1878, Emma was 20 years old, and William was 61. They married on 7 January 1879, and on 31 August 1880, Wilhelmina was born.\nThe marriage.\nThe first years of the marriage were happy for Queen Emma. She liked to do woodcarving, and spent a lot of time in her workshop in Utrecht. She also spent a lot of time on taking care of her \"Wimmy\". But soon things changed. In 1884, William's youngest son Alexander died. He was 32 years old, and was not married. William's other sons had already died: Maurits in 1850 age 6, and William in 1879 aged 38. This meant that princess Wilhelmina would now be next in line to become Queen.\nThe princess was only three years old. The King was 65. Because of the age difference, the government voted for Emma to become \"Regent\". This meant that if the king died before Wilhelmina was 18 years old, Emma would do the job of Queen until Wilhelmina was old enough to take over.\nRegent.\nThe health of the King went downhill fast in 1888. In May the family moved from The Hague to their palace in the quiet of Apeldoorn. The king could no longer rule the country. The government voted that Queen Emma would be Regent, and she took the oath to rule for her husband on 20 November in The Hague. She ruled in his place for only three days; William died on 23rd November 1890. He was 73 years old. From that day, at 10 years old, Wilhelmina officially became the Queen. Emma became Queen-regent for her daughter until 1898.\nEmma worked in the same way as her husband. She made sure she would meet all ministers once every fourteen days. Unlike her husband, she opened up for everyone who wanted to speak to her. She also opened a lot of the post that was sent to her personally. In her period as Queen-widow-regent, she had to reshuffle her cabinet three times. She found this a difficult task.\nShe also gave great care to raising her daughter. She wanted to make sure her daughter would be ready to be the queen.\nQueen-mother.\nYoung Wilhelmina soon chose her own path when she became Queen. She tried to get away from her mother, but often had to rely on her good knowledge of protocol. At first they lived together in Palace Noordeinde. When Wilhelmina married, Emma moved to Palace Lange Voorhout. She was no longer involved in reigning the country but still would receive diplomats and other people as widow of the king.\nShe supported the work to stop tuberculosis, which was a disease many people died from at the time. Her sister Sophie had died from it too.\nThe next in line to the throne, Juliana, was born in 1909. The government again looked for a regent. They did not think Wilhelmina's husband Hendrik was good. Because they had good memories of Emma as regent, they requested that Emma again be Regent. Wilhelmina agreed, and from 1909 to 1927 (when Juliana would be 18) Emma once again was regent. This time it was not needed.\nEmma died on 20th March 1934 from the complications of bronchitis."}

It is 55 km long and flows to the north into the Manzanillo Bay, Atlantic Ocean.\nName.\nThe Ta\u00edno name of the river was \"Guatapan\u00e1\" but the Spanish people that came to live in the Hispaniola island called it Dajab\u00f3n after the Ta\u00edno name of the region (\"Dahaboon\"). Because this river was the border between the two colonies of the island, there were many fights during the 16th and 17th centuries and many people died here; then the French people began to name the river Massacre, written sometimes Masacre in Spanish; massacre means the killing of many people.\nCourse.\nThe source of the Dajab\u00f3n is at the \"Pico de Gallo\" mountain, on the northern side of the Cordillera Central mountain range. It flows through the Dajab\u00f3n province and then form part of the limits between Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Its mouth is in the Manzanillo Bay, on the Atlantic Ocean.\nIts discharge (volume of water which passes through a section of the river per unit of time) is 2.84 cubic metres per second at Don Miguel, a place a few kilometres south of the city of Dajab\u00f3n.\nThe city of Dajab\u00f3n is the most important Dominican city close to the river. It flows also through the city of Loma de Cabrera. The Haitian city of Ouanaminthe is also close to the river.\nThe most important tributary is the river \"Capotillo\" (in Haiti, river \"Bernard\"). There is not any important tributary in the lower part.\nThe river Capotillo is part of the northern border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic until it joins the river Dajab\u00f3n between the cities of Loma de Cabrera and Dajab\u00f3n. Then the border follows the course of the river Dajab\u00f3n."}

It is almost always made of metal, such as iron or aluminum.\nFrying pans also are often manufactured of some type of metal combination. Aluminum and stainless steel are favorite choices for this type of fryer tool. The metal pans are often coated with a copper bottom that adds both style and enhances the heat distribution qualities of the pan. However, a stainless steel or aluminum frying pan is not considered as versatile as the cast iron models, since they cannot be placed in the oven and are also not usually recommended with gas stovetops, since the flames tend to discolor and eventually damage the copper bottoms.\nThe first material used to manufacture the modern frying pan was copper; although there are evidences cast iron frying pans were also used during the Han Dynasty. The shape of these old frying pans was not quite different than the modern ones, as shows the picture of this copper frying pan dated between the 5th and 6th century BC of the Archeological Museum in Thessalonica."}

{"id": "181453", "revid": "6649743", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=181453", "title": "P versus NP", "text": "P versus NP is the following question of interest to people working with computers and in mathematics: Can every solved problem whose answer can be checked quickly by a computer also be quickly solved by a computer? P and NP are the two types of maths problems referred to: P problems are fast for\u00a0computers\u00a0to solve, and so are considered \"easy\". NP problems are fast (and so \"easy\") for a computer to check, but are not necessarily easy to solve.\nIn 1956, Kurt G\u00f6del wrote a letter to John von Neumann. In this letter, G\u00f6del asked whether a certain NP complete problem could be solved in quadratic or linear time. In 1971, Stephen Cook introduced the precise statement of the P versus NP problem in his article \"The complexity of theorem proving procedures\".\nToday, many people consider this problem to be the most important open problem in computer science. It is one of the seven selected by the Clay Mathematics Institute to carry a US$1,000,000 prize for the first correct solution.\nClarifications.\nFor instance, if you have a problem, and someone says \"The answer to your problem is the set of numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\", a computer may be able, quickly, to figure out if the answer is right or wrong, but it may take a very long time for the computer to actually come up with \"1, 2, 3, 4, 5\" on its own. Another example includes finding prime numbers. It is easy to check if a number is prime, but it is very difficult to find those numbers in the first place. For some interesting, practical questions of this kind, we lack any way to find an answer quickly, but if we are provided an answer, it is possible to check\u2014that is, to verify\u2014the answer quickly. In this way, NP problems may be thought of as being like riddles: it may be hard to come up with the answer to a riddle, but once one hears the answer, the answer seems obvious. In this comparison (analogy), the basic question is: are riddles really as hard as we think they are, or are we missing something?\nBecause these kinds of \"P versus NP\" questions are so practically important, many mathematicians, scientists, and computer programmers want to prove the general proposition, that every quickly-checked problem can also be solved quickly. This question is important enough that the Clay Mathematical Institute will give $1,000,000 to anyone who successfully provides a proof or a valid explanation that disproves it.\nDigging a little deeper, we see that all P problems are NP problems: it is easy to check that a solution is correct by solving the problem and comparing the two solutions. However, people want to know about the opposite: Are there any NP problems other than P problems, or are all NP problems just P problems? If NP problems are really not the same as P problems (P \u2260 NP), it would mean that no general, fast ways to solve those NP problems can exist, no matter how hard we look. However, if all NP problems are P problems (P = NP), it would mean that new, very fast problem-solving methods do exist. We just have not found them yet.\nSince the best efforts of scientists and mathematicians have not found general, easy methods for solving NP problems yet, many people believe that there are NP problems other than P problems (that is, that P \u2260 NP is true). Most mathematicians also believe this to be true, but currently no one has proven it by rigorous mathematical analysis. If it can be proven that NP and P are the same (P = NP is true), it would have a huge impact on many aspects of day-to-day life. For this reason, the question of \"P versus NP\" is an important and widely studied topic.\nExample.\nSuppose someone wants to build two towers, by stacking rocks of different mass. One wants to make sure that each of the towers has exactly the same mass. That means one will have to put the rocks into two piles that have the same mass. If one guesses a division of the rocks that one thinks will work, it would be easy for one to check if one was right. (To check the answer, one can divide the rocks into two piles, then use a balance to see if they have the same mass.) Because it is easy to check this problem, called 'Partition' by computer scientists\u2014easier than to solve it outright, as we will see\u2014it is not a P problem.\nHow hard is it to solve, outright? If one starts with just 100 rocks, there are 2^{100-1}-1 = 633,825,300,114,114,700,748,351,602,687, or about 6.3 x 10^{29} possible ways (combinations) to divide these rocks into two piles. If one could check one unique combination of rocks every day, it would take 1.3 x 10^{22} or 1,300,000,000,000,000,000,000 years of effort. For comparison, physicists believe that the universe is about 1.4 x 10^{10} years old (450,000,000,000,000,000 or about 4.5 x 10^{17} seconds, or about one trillionth as old as the time it would take for our rock piling effort. That means that if one takes all of the time that has passed since the beginning of the universe, one would need to check more than two trillion (2,000,000,000,000) different ways of dividing the rocks \"every second\", in order to check all of the different ways.\nIf one programmed a powerful computer, to test all of these ways to divide the rocks, one might be able to check formula_1 combinations per second using current systems. This means one would still need formula_2 very powerful computers, \"working since the origin of the universe,\" to test all the ways of dividing the rocks.\nHowever, it may be possible to find a method of dividing the rocks into two equal piles without checking all combinations. The question \"Is P equal to NP?\" is a shorthand for asking if any method like that can exist.\nWhy it matters.\nThere are many important NP problems that people don't know how to solve in a way that is faster than testing every possible answer. Here are some examples:\nExponential Time.\nIn the example above, we see that with formula_3 rocks, there are formula_4 ways to partition the set of rocks. With formula_5 rocks, there are formula_6 combinations. The function formula_7 is an exponential function. It's important to NP because it models the worst-case number of computations that are needed to solve a problem and, thus, the worst-case amount of time required.\nAnd so far, for the hard problems, the solutions have required on the order of formula_6 computations. For any particular problem, people have found ways to reduce the number of computations needed. One might figure out that a way to do just 1% of the worst-case number of computation and that saves a \"lot\" of computing, but that is still formula_9 computations. And every extra rock still doubles the number of computations needed to solve the problem. There are insights that can produce methods to do even fewer computations producing variations of the model: e.g. formula_10. But the exponential function still dominates as formula_5 grows.\nConsider the problem of scheduling exams (described above). But suppose, next, that there are 15000 students. There's a computer program that takes the schedules of all 15000 students. It runs in an hour and outputs an exam schedule so that all students can do their exams in one week. It satisfies lots of rules (no back-to-back exams, no more than 2 exams in any 28 hour period, ...) to limit the stress of exam week. The program runs for one hour at mid-term break and everyone knows his/her exam schedule with plenty of time to prepare.\nThe next year, though, there are 10 more students. If the same program runs on the same computer then that one hour is going to turn into formula_12 hours, because every additional student doubles the computations. That's formula_13 weeks! If there were 20 more students, then\nThus, for formula_18 students, it takes one hour. For formula_19 students, it takes formula_17 years.\nAs you can see, exponential functions grow really fast. Most mathematicians believe that the hardest NP problems require exponential time to solve.\nNP-complete problems.\nMathematicians can show that there are some NP problems that are NP-Complete. An NP-Complete problem is at least as difficult to solve as any other NP problem. This means that if someone found a method to solve any NP-Complete problem quickly, they could use that same method to solve \"every\" NP problem quickly. All of the problems listed above are NP-Complete, so if the salesman found a way to plan his trip quickly, he could tell the teacher, and she could use that same method to schedule the exams. The farmer could use the same method to determine how many boxes she needs, and the woman could use the same method to find a way to build her towers.\nBecause a method that quickly solves one of these problems can solve them all, there are many people who want to find one. However, because there are so many different NP-Complete problems and nobody so far has found a way to solve even one of them quickly, most experts believe that solving NP-Complete problems quickly is not possible.\nBasic Properties.\nIn computational complexity theory, the complexity class NP-complete (abbreviated NP-C or NPC), is a class of problems having two properties:\nFormal overview.\nNP-complete is a subset of NP, the set of all decision problems whose solutions can be verified in polynomial time; NP may be equivalently defined as the set of decision problems solved in polynomial time on a machine. A problem p in NP is also in NPC if and only if every other problem in NP is transformed into p in polynomial time. NP-complete was to be used as an adjective: problems in the class NP-complete were as NP+complete problems.\nNP-complete problems are studied because the ability to quickly verify solutions to a problem (NP) seems to correlate with the ability to quickly solve problem (P). It is found every problem in NP is quickly solved\u2014as called the P = NP: problem set. The single problem in NP-complete is solved quickly, faster than every problem in NP also quickly solved, because the definition of an NP-complete problem states every problem in NP must be quickly reducible to every problem in NP-complete (it is reduced in polynomial time). \nExamples.\nThe Boolean satisfiability problem is known to be NP complete. In 1972, Richard Karp formulated 21 problems that are known to be NP-complete. These are known as Karp's 21 NP-complete problems. They include problems such as the Integer programming problem, which applies linear programming techniques to the integers, the knapsack problem, or the vertex cover problem."}

He was probably French. Nothing is known about his life except that he worked in or around Paris in the late 12th century to early 13th century. People have tried to find out who he was by studying the archives of Notre Dame Cathedral, but his name has not been found there. He probably had another name, and used the name P\u00e9rotin for his compositions. \nP\u00e9rotin worked on a very important collection of polyphonic music called \"Magnus Liber\" (meaning: Big Book). The composer L\u00e9onin had written a lot of this music. He may have been P\u00e9rotin's teacher, but we do not know. He seems to have written music for four voices which are settings of words for the Feast of the Circumcision and St Stephen's Day. He wrote three and four voice music of a type called organum. It was a very important development in the history of Western music. He wrote music in a polyphonic style. Often he took a tune and arranged it so that one voice sang it incredibly slowly while another voice sang something much faster on top.\nIt is difficult to work out any dates for his works because of the way the music was written. Often it is not even clear what mode they are in.\nP\u00e9rotin's music has been an influence on some 20th century composers who wrote minimalist music such as Steve Reich."}

It is served by the Underground Central and Jubilee lines, and by London Overground, Abellio Greater Anglia, TfL Rail and c2c. It is in Travelcard Zone 3.\nTo distinguish the station from Stratford-upon-Avon this station is called Stratford (London) by National Rail, and is sometimes referred to as Stratford Regional to distinguish it from Stratford International station away.\nAmenities.\nGoods facilities.\nThere were three primary goods facilities in the Stratford area in the steam age, although the nearby Stratford Works and engine shed generated their own traffic. A short distance to the north of Stratford station (on the line to Cambridge) there were marshalling yards at Temple Mills. There was a small goods yard north of the station on the east side of the line which occupied a constrained site. The mainstay of traffic was domestic coal although shortly before closure in the 1960s the site was used as a reception point for concrete components for the building of tower blocks in Newham.\nThere was a small depot at Carpenters Road about a quarter of a mile south of Stratford station. Opened in 1900, the depot consisted of four long sidings and primarily dealt with coal and building materials. It was closed on 7 December 1964.\nThere was a large depot at Stratford Market railway station. All of these three facilities were operated by the Great Eastern Railway up until 1923 before being taken over by the London &amp; North Eastern Railway until nationalisation in 1948 when they became part of British Railways Eastern Region.\nThere was also a goods terminal at Bow operated by the Midland Railway which is still open today mostly for building materials. This yard operated as the terminal for building materials for the adjacent Olympics site.\nBetween Stratford and Maryland stations Windmill Lane cattle pens existed on the down side of the line whilst four private sidings belonging to Young &amp; Martens were located on the up side.\nDuring the 1960s part of the Stratford Works site was converted to the London International Freight Terminal (LIFT) which opened in 1967 and there was a freight liner terminal that operated on the far side of the Stratford railway complex (on the Channelsea Loop line) between 1967 and 1994. The former site is now occupied by the international station and shopping centre.\nStratford International.\nThe nearby Stratford International station opened on 30 November 2009 (for preview services only). Since 13 December 2009 Southeastern began its full domestic high-speed service between London St Pancras, directly to Ebbsfleet International and Ashford in Kent. The Docklands Light Railway 'Stratford International' extension has provided a link between the two stations since 31 August 2011. There is also a walking route between the two stations passing through the newly built Westfield Stratford City Shopping Centre.\nDespite Stratford International's name, no international trains call there, and Eurostar (currently the only international operator) has no plans to do so. Passengers instead interconnect on high-speed trains travelling to either London St Pancras or Ebbsfleet in Kent, there are a number of other potential operators that may use the station for international services. These include Deutsche Bahn's proposed London-Frankfurt/Amsterdam service and the proposed \"Transmanche Metro\" service to Calais via local stations.\nStratford City.\nIn preparation for the Olympics and the Stratford City development, a new north-facing exit and ticket hall has been built. Both existing passenger subways have been extended north to connect with the ticket hall, and the abandoned subway at the eastern end of the station, which formed part of the old station complex, has been reopened and refurbished to allow interchange between platforms 3\u201312 and the new high-level platforms 1 &amp; 2. A new pedestrian bridge has also been built to connect Stratford shopping centre with the Stratford City development. This also connects the mezzanine-level ticket hall with the northern one. The northern ticket hall and the footbridge opened along with Westfield Stratford City on 13 September 2011.\nBus stations.\nStratford bus station is to the south of the station and Stratford City bus station is to the north. Both are served by bus services right across London and to the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park."}

It is the fifth of his nine symphonies. It was written between 1804 and 1808. This symphony is one of the most popular and well-known works of classical music.\nThere are four movements: an opening sonata allegro, a slower andante, and a fast scherzo which leads straight in to the finale. \nThe symphony was first performed in Vienna's Theater an der Wien in 1808. His Sixth Symphony was also performed for the first time at the same concert. The Fifth Symphony soon became recognized as one of the most important musical works.\nThe music.\nThe symphony begins with a four-note \"short-short-short-long\" motif which is heard twice (slightly lower the second time): \nThe opening of the symphony is so famous that it has often been quoted. Other composers have used it in their compositions, e.g. Sergei Rachmaninoff in his song \"Fate\". It has often been used in popular culture, from disco to rock and roll, and in film and television. During World War II, the BBC used the four-note motif to introduce its radio news broadcasts because \"short-short-short-long\" spells the letter \"V\" in Morse code. The \"V\" meant \"Victory\". It was played very quietly on a drum. People in Nazi occupied countries who wanted to hear the news listened in secret to the BBC news because it was more likely to be true.\nThe third movement of the symphony uses this rhythm sometimes as an accompaniment. \nWhen Beethoven wrote this symphony he was in his mid-thirties. He was becoming more and more deaf. He found this terribly hard to bear. He thought that he, of all people, should have perfect hearing. He felt very depressed, but he decided not to commit suicide, but to stay alive and write down all the music he had in his head. He wrote about this in a letter called the Heiligenstadt Testament.\nThe opening of the Fifth Symphony sounds very bold and heroic. The whole symphony sounds like a struggle which starts from those four notes. People have often said that those four notes represent fate knocking at the door. By the time we get to the last movement (the finale) the music has become major instead of minor. It sounds as if Beethoven has overcome his depression.\nThe fourth movement of this symphony is one of the first times a trombone or a piccolo is used in a symphony."}

A homotopy is a deformation (change of form) of one thing into another without cutting it. For example, if we imagine a stretchy object, then all the shapes we can stretch or twist it into are \"homotopy equivalent\". One famous example is the homotopy equivalence of a coffee cup and a donut. To a topologist, these two shapes are the same.\nThe first example of a homotopy that a topology student is introduced to is a homotopy between functions. A homotopy between two functions \"f\" and \"g\" provides a collection of functions that start at \"f\" and eventually become \"g\". What this means is that this homotopy takes a parameter and gives a function, and there is a possible parameter that gives \"f\" and one that gives \"g\". Typically, we choose the interval \"[0, 1]\" because this has a starting and ending point, and numbers are allowed to vary smoothly within \"[0, 1]\". To output a function, this means that the homotopy takes a second parameter, which is the argument of the output function. That is, if \"f\" takes a number in the interval and outputs pairs of real numbers, the homotopy takes a number in the interval as the parameter and another number in the interval for \"f\". The homotopy then outputs the interpolated function evaluated at the given pair. That is, if \"H\" is a homotopy from \"f\" to \"g\", then we know formula_1where formula_2and formula_3. "}

These people then study how to play musical instruments, singing, composition, musicology, music history and music theory.\nSeveral high schools also offer an education in music. In these high schools, the subjects are integrated into a normal school curriculum.\nThe third type of music school is independent of the other education a child or adults gets. These schools are often organised as associations, or they are run by a theatre. Pupils can learn how to sing, play an instrument, or be a dancer or actor in a theatre play, outside a context of regular schooling."}

The first performance of the opera as completed by Alfano was conducted by Ettore Panizza.\nThe most famous song from the opera is the aria \"Nessun dorma\".

It was the largest marsupial carnivore to have lived in Australia. Fossil remains on the dry Nullarbor Plain show that humans and climate change probably caused the extinction of the Australian megafauna about 45,000 years ago.\nThe animal was robust with powerfully built jaws and very strong forelimbs. It had retractable claws, unique among marsupials. This allowed the claws to remain sharp by protecting them from wear when walking. The claws were well-suited to holding prey and for climbing trees. The first digits (\"thumbs\") on each hand were semi-opposable and bore an enlarged claw. Palaeontologists believe that this would have been used to grapple with its prey, and gave a sure footing on tree trunks and branches. The hind feet had four functional toes, the first digit being much reduced in size but possessing a roughened pad similar to that of possums. It may have assisted with climbing. It is unclear whether the marsupial lion had syndactyly (fused second and third toes) like other diprotodonts.\nIt had strong claws and very powerful jaws. Biologists estimate that it had the most powerful bite of any mammal, alive or extinct.\nIt was able to hunt animals like the giant kangaroo and the giant wombat, but its big jaw would have made it hard for it to hunt and kill small animals. The marsupial lion could weigh up to . It was about long, and stood about tall.\nFossils and other evidence.\nFossil bones of the marsupial lion have been found in caves on the Nullabor Plain. Scientists have estimated their age at between 400,000 and 800,000 years old. Cave paintings of marsupial lions in northwest Australia, discovered in 2006, depict them with a striped back, tufted tail and pointed ears. In 2009, after a long drought in southeast Victoria had dried out many lakes, a farmer near Ballarat discovered fossil footprints and a jawbone of a marsupial lion preserved in limestone in a dry lake bed."}

{"id": "181622", "revid": "966595", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=181622", "title": "Hibari Misora", "text": " was a Japanese singer and actress. The style of music she sang was enka. She received many awards, among them living national treasure. In Japan she is regarded as one of the greatest singers of all time. She was the first woman in Japan to receive the , which was awarded for her notable contributions to the music industry. Hibari Misora was also one of the most commercially successful music artists in the world. At the time of her death, she had recorded around 1,200 songs, and sold 68 million records. After her death, consumer demand for her recordings grew significantly, and she had sold more than 80 million records by 2001. Her swan-song is often performed by artists and orchestras in her honour. Artists who recorded this song include The Three Tenors, Teresa Teng, Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlan, and the Twelve Girls Band.\nBiography.\nLife and career.\nHibari Misora was born in Isogo-ku, Yokohama, Japan. Her father was , a fishmonger, and her mother , a housewife. Misora showed musical talent from an early age after singing for her father at a World War II send-off party in 1943. When he saw this, he used much of his family's savings to allow his daughter to start a musical career. In 1945 she gave her first performance in a concert hall in Yokohama, at the age of eight. She used the name , which her mother had proposed. A year later she appeared on a NHK broadcast, and impressed the Japanese composer Masao Koga with her singing skill. He thought she was a prodigy with the courage, understanding, and emotional maturity of an adult. In the next two years, she became an accomplished singer and was touring notable concert halls to sold-out crowds. Her recording career began in 1949 at the age of twelve, when she changed her stage-name to and starred in the film . The film brought her nationwide recognition. She recorded her first single for Columbia Records later that year. It became a commercial hit, selling more than 450,000 copies. After that, she recorded \"Kanashiki kuchibue\", which was featured on a radio program and was a national hit. As an actress, she starred in about 160 movies from 1949 to 1971, and won many awards. Her performance in \"Tokyo Kiddo\" (1950), in which she played a street orphan, made her symbolic of both the hardship and the national optimism of post-World War II Japan. Her third single was from the film and was another hit, \"Watashi wa machi no ko\".\nAs a singer, she became known for her performance of enka, a sentimental form of Japanese popular music which emerged during the early part of the 20th century, and was renowned for her live performances, and singing which encapsulated the emotional pain of those who had suffered. Although she did not understand English, she made excellent recordings US jazz standards.\nThroughout her career she recorded over 1,401 songs, with her best selling song \"Yawara\" selling 1.8 million times.\nIn 1973 Tetsuya Kat\u014d, Misora's brother, was prosecuted for gang-related activity. Although NHK did not acknowledge any connection, Misora was excluded from \"Kouhaku uta gassen\" for the first time in eighteen years. Offended, she refused to appear on NHK for years afterwards.\nDeath.\nHealth problems also plagued her in her later years. In April of 1987, on the way to a performance in Fukuoka, Misora suddenly collapsed. Rushed to hospital, she was diagnosed with avascular necrosis brought on by chronic hepatitis. She was confined to a hospital in Fukuoka, and eventually showed signs of recovery in August. She commenced recording a new song in October, and in April of 1988 performed at a concert at the Tokyo Dome. Despite overwhelming pain in her legs, she performed a total of 39 songs.\nHer triumph was to be short lived. She had drunk a lot of alcohol for decades. This had weakened her liver, and her condition grew worse. On 24 June 1989, after being confined to a hospital in Tokyo, she died from pneumonia at the age of 52. Her death was widely mourned throughout Japan.\nBeginning in 1990, television and radio stations play her song on her birthdate each year to show respect. In a national poll by NHK in 1997, the song was voted the greatest Japanese song of all time by more than 10 million people.\nMuseum.\nIn 1994, the \"Hibari Misora Museum\" opened in Arashiyama, Kyoto. It traced the history of Misora's life and career in multi-media exhibits, and displayed various memorabilia. It attracted more than 5 million visitors, until it officially closed on November 30, 2006, as to allow a scheduled reconstruction of the building. The main exhibits were moved into the Sh\u014dwa period section of the Edo-Tokyo Museum, until reconstruction was complete. The new \"Hibari Misora Theater\" opened on April 26, 2008, and includes a CD for sale of a previously unreleased song.\nQuestion of Korean ancestry.\nPeople are unsure where Hibari Misora's parents were originally from. \nSome people think that she was of Korean origins, and that both her parents and herself had Korean passports. Others disagree. After studying her ancestry, they think that her parents were not Korean, but rather Japanese."}

Like the Flintstones or the Smurfs, they have much of the same technology as contemporary humans, adapted to their own aquatic environment. The Snorks use clams as currency, a reference to the slang word \"clam\", meaning \"dollar.\"\nAccording to the Snork back-story, a few ventured to the surface (which the Snorks believe is \"outer space\") in 1643, and watched a Royal Navy ship being attacked by pirates. The captain wound up in the water, and that was the first contact between the species when the Snorks saved his life, to which the captain then expressed his gratitude by writing a book about the Snorks, although very few humans believe in the existence of the Snorks. Since then, Snorks have adopted several human habits, such as wearing clothes."}

{"id": "181827", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=181827", "title": "Noble savage", "text": "The noble savage is an old term.\n\"Savage\" is a new term.\nThe term \"noble savage\" is an idea people had: Without civilization, humans are essentially good; it is civilization that makes them act in bad ways. The idea started in the 17th century and developed in the 18th century. One of the first to express it was Shaftesbury. He told the would-be author \u201cto search for that simplicity of manners, and innocence of behaviour, which has been often known among mere savages; ere they were corrupted by our commerce\u201d (\"Advice to an Author\", Part III.iii). His counter to the doctrine of original sin, born amid the optimistic atmosphere of Renaissance humanism, was taken up by another author who lived at the same time, the essayist Richard Steele, who attributed the corruption of contemporary manners to false education.\nIn the eighteenth-century cult of \"Primitivism\" the noble savage, uncorrupted by the influences of civilization, was considered more worthy, more authentically noble than the contemporary product of civilized training. Although the phrase \"noble savage\" first appeared in Dryden's \"The Conquest of Granada\" (1672), the idealized picture of \"nature's gentleman\" was an aspect of eighteenth-century sentimentalism, among other forces at work.\nPre-history of the Noble Savage.\nDuring the seventeenth century, as an aspect of Romantic \"Primitivism\", the figure of the \"Good Savage\" was held up as a reproach to European civilization, then in the throes of savage wars of religion. People were especially horrified by the Massacre of Saint Bartholomew (1572), in which some 20,000 men, women, and children were massacred, chiefly in Paris, but also throughout France, in a three-day period. This led Montaigne to write his famous essay \"Of Cannibals\" (1587), in which he stated that although cannibals ceremoniously eat each other, Europeans behave even more barbarously and burn each other alive for disagreeing about religion. The treatment of indigenous peoples by the Spanish Conquistadors also produced a great deal of bad conscience and recriminations. Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas, who witnessed it, may have been the first to idealize the simple life of the indigenous Americans. He and other observers praised the simple manners of the indigenous Americans and reported that they were incapable of lying. European guilt over colonialism, with its use of recently invented guns on people who did not have them inspired fictional treatments such as Aphra Behn's novel \"Oroonoko, or the Royal Slave\", about a slave revolt in Surinam in the West Indies. Behn's story was not primarily a protest against slavery but was written for money; and it met readers' expectations by following the conventions of the European romance novella. The leader of the revolt, Oroonoko, is truly noble in that he is a hereditary African prince, and he laments his lost African homeland in the traditional terms of a Golden Age. He is not a savage but dresses and behaves like a European aristocrat. Behn's story was adapted for the stage by Irish playwright Thomas Southerne, who stressed its sentimental aspects, and as time went on it came to be seen as addressing the issues of slavery and colonialism, remaining very popular throughout the Eighteenth Century.\nOrigin of term \"Noble Savage\".\nIn English, the phrase \"Noble Savage\" first appeared in Dryden's play, \"The Conquest of Granada\" (1672): \"I am as free as nature first made man, / Ere the base laws of servitude began, / When wild in woods the noble savage ran.\" However, the term \"Noble Savage\" only began to be widely used in the last half of the nineteenth century and then as a term of disparagement. In French the term had been the \"Good Savage\" (or good \"Wild man\"), and, in French (and even in eighteenth-century English), the word \"savage\" did not necessarily have the connotations of cruelty we now associate with it, but meant \"wild\" as in a wild flower.\nThe idealized picture of \"Nature's Gentleman\" was an aspect of eighteenth-century sentimentalism, along with other stock figures such as, the Virtuous Milkmaid, the Servant-More-Clever-than-the-Master (such as Sancho Panza and Figaro, among countless others), and the general theme of virtue in the lowly born. Nature's Gentleman, whether European-born or exotic, takes his place among these tropes, along with the Wise Egyptian, Persian, and Chinaman. He had always existed, from the time of the epic of Gilgamesh, where he appears as Enkiddu, the wild-but-good man who lives with animals; and the untutored-but-noble medieval knight, Parsifal. Even the Biblical David the shepherd boy, falls into this category. Indeed, that virtue and lowly birth can coexist is a time-honored tenet of Abrahamic religion, most conspicuously so in the case of the Founder of the Christian religion. Likewise, the idea that withdrawal from society\u2014and specifically from cities\u2014is associated with virtue, is originally a religious one.\n\"Hayy ibn Yaqdhan\" an Islamic philosophical tale (or thought experiment) by Ibn Tufail from twelfth-century Andalusia, straddles the divide between the religious and the secular. The tale is of interest because it was known to the New England Puritan divine, Cotton Mather. Translated in to English (from Latin) in 1686 and 1708, it tells the story of Hayy, a wild child, raised by a gazelle, without human contact, on a deserted island in the Indian Ocean. Purely through the use of his reason, Hayy goes through all the gradations of knowledge before emerging into human society, where he revealed to be a believer of Natural religion, which Cotton Mather, as a Christian Divine, identified with Primitive Christianity. The figure of Hayy is both a Natural man and a Wise Persian, but not a Noble Savage.\nThe \"locus classicus\" of the eighteenth century portrayal of the American Indian is that of Alexander Pope, unquestionably the most famous and widely-translated poet of his day. In his philosophical poem, \"Essay on Man\" (1734), Pope wrote: \nLo, the poor Indian! whose untutor'd mind /\nSees God in clouds, or hears him in the wind; /\nHis soul proud Science never taught to stray / \nFar as the solar walk or milky way; / \nYet simple Nature to his hope has giv'n, / \nBehind the cloud-topp'd hill, a humbler heav'n; /\nSome safer world in depth of woods embrac'd, /\nSome happier island in the wat'ry waste, / \nWhere slaves once more their native land behold, / \nNo fiends torment, no Christians thirst for gold! / \nTo be, contents his natural desire; / \nHe asks no angel's wing, no seraph's fire: / \nBut thinks, admitted to that equal sky, / \nHis faithful dog shall bear him company.\nPope's poem expresses the typical Age of Reason belief that men are everywhere and in all times the same, which was also Christian doctrine (Pope was a Catholic). He portrays his Indian as a victim (\"the poor Indian\"), who, although less learned and with less aspirations than his European counterpart, is as good or better and hence equally worthy of salvation. He is a \"bon sauvage\", but not a noble one.\nAttributes of Romantic Primitivism.\nIn the first century CE, all of these qualities had been attributed by Tacitus to the German barbarians in his \"Germania\", in which he contrasted them repeatedly with the softened, Romanized, corrupted Gauls, by inference criticizing his own Roman culture for getting away from its roots\u2014which was the perennial function of such comparisons. The Germans did not inhabit a \"Golden Age\" of ease, but were tough and inured to hardship, qualities which Tacitus saw as preferable to the \"softness\" of civilized life. In antiquity this form of \"hard Primitivism\", whether viewed as desirable or seen as something to escape, co-existed in rhetorical opposition to the \"soft Primitivism\" of visions of a lost Golden Age of ease and plenty.\nThe legendary toughness and martial valor of the Spartans were also admired throughout the ages by hard Primitivists; and in the Eighteenth Century a Scottish writer described Highland countrymen this way:\nThey greatly excel the Lowlanders in all the exercises that require agility; they are incredibly abstemious, and patient of hunger and fatigue; so steeled against the weather, that in traveling, even when the ground is covered with snow, they never look for a house, or any other shelter but their plaid, in which they wrap themselves up, and go to sleep under the cope of heaven. Such people, in quality of soldiers, must be invincible . . ."}

The station has two separate parts:\nThis split is generally held to, as the track layout does not allow much swapping, with only a small number of connecting flyovers between the main lines in the Battersea area, and a single track connection just outside the station. As the Brighton side is the busier of the two, disruption on that line sometimes results in some of its suburban services using the eastern side. This is often true of the Gatwick Express, which travels along the Brighton Main Line, as it will often divert over Chatham side tracks during engineering works in order to maintain service levels.\nVictoria also serves as the London terminus for the Venice Simplon Orient Express, from Platform 2, the longest platform.\nThere are ticket barriers to platforms 1-12 and 15-19. Platforms 13 and 14 don't have ticket barriers and this is where the Gatwick Express service departs.\nLondon Underground.\nThe London Underground station lies to the north of the mainline station concourse.It is currently the busiest station on the system with around 76 million using the station (not including interchanging passengers) as of 2007, 60.2 million (including interchanges) using the Victoria Line platforms. There are two ticket halls. The newer hall, closer to the mainline station, serves the Victoria Line; the other, farther north, serves the District and Circle Lines. The ticket halls are connected by a pedestrian passage beneath the Bus station.\nProposed\nCoach and bus stations.\nVictoria coach station.\nVictoria coach station is half a mile south-west of the railway stations.

These were the last hydraulically operated lifts on LT. The access to the Piccadilly and Victoria line platforms is by staircase only, reached via two narrow passages that physically prevent the installation of automatic ticket barriers - remarkable, considering its Zone 2 location. Manual ticket inspections do, however, regularly take place. Oystercard readers are available for \"pay as you go\" customers."}

This made him very interested in Russian music.\nIn 1918, Ansermet started an orchestra of his own, the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande (OSR). He remained conductor of this orchestra until he retired in 1966. He made this into an internationally famous orchestra. They travelled to many countries in Europe and America. They gave first performances of many modern works. After World War II they made many recordings for Decca Records.\nAnsermet was largely self-taught. His conducting was very different from that of many of the other famous conductors of the time such as Pierre Monteux, Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler and Otto Klemperer. He did not like the way that Stravinsky kept making changes to his works. He conducted works by Arthur Honegger and Frank Martin, but did not like serial music such as that of Arnold Schoenberg.\nHe died in Geneva on 20 February 1969.\nReferences.\nGroves Dictionary of Music &amp; Musicians, ed Stanley Sadie, 1980; "}

Fanfares are usually played by trumpets or French horns and other brass instruments, often with drums. The word \"fanfare\" can also mean an event with a high amount of publicity, even if there is no actual music.\nHistory.\nFanfares began in the Middle Ages. Modern movies often show trumpets playing fanfares in ancient Rome, but there is little evidence that this ever happened. In the 18th century France, the fanfare was a piece of music with energy and repeated notes. Modern fanfares come from the 19th century in Britain where they were written for important state events such as the crowning of a king or queen. Hubert Parry wrote a fanfare, \"I Was Glad\", for the coronation of Edward VII.\nFanfares today.\nFanfares are used today as music at the start of television and radio news programs. Often they are used as victory marches in video games, particularly Role Playing Games. Fanfares are also seen at military parades and events. The British Army bands all have a special teams of between four and eight trumpet players to play fanfares. The new University for the Creative Arts in England has asked composer Edward Gregson to write a fanfare to play at its graduation ceremonies.\nFanfare trumpets.\nA special trumpet, usually called a herald trumpet, is often used to play fanfares. The fanfare trumpet has a long straight tube, which often can have a banner hanging from it. There are three sizes of fanfare trumpet, a Bb trumpet, tenor trumpet and a bass trumpet."}

There it was important to separate seriously wounded soldiers from less-seriously wounded. Nightingale reduced death rates from 40% to 2% by creating the concept of intensive care.\nBecause of a polio epidemic, Bj\u00f8rn Ibsen established the first intensive care unit in Copenhagen in 1953.

The dogs are trained to tell their owner when they hear important sounds.\nTraining.\nHearing dogs need to be calm and friendly around people. They need to be trained to hear and understand certain sounds. They also have to be trained to work with their owner and to tell their owner when certain sounds occur.\nThe sounds can come from doorbells, smoke alarms, telephones, or alarm clocks. The hearing dogs may work outside their owner's home and be trained to hear sounds like sirens, forklifts and a person calling the owner's name. They may also be taught to respond to and/or lead away from a sound: For example, in the case of a fire alarm, the dog will usually drop to the floor, instead of leading the owner towards the alarm, which would be dangerous. \nThe training period for hearing dogs may take up to year. Most hearing dogs are professionally trained, but people may choose to train a hearing dog themselves.\nAccessibility.\nIn most countries, hearing dogs are allowed, by law, to go to any place that the public would normally be allowed to go.\nHearing dogs may wear a brightly coloured collar and leash. They can also wear a cape or jacket to make it easier to identify them.\nIn the United Kingdom, hearing dogs wear distinctive jackets, which are burgundy (the colour of red wine) and have the logo of the charity which trains and pays for the dogs.\nIn Australia, hearing dogs are trained through the Lions Club International of Australia. They wear a bright orange leash, collar and harness to identify them, and carry with them an official ID."}

It may be secret, and many methods are used including telephone tapping to listen to the person's calls and putting an electronic listening device, a bug, into a room.\nGovernments and the military have built large facilities designed to listen in to communications between other governments and military groups. For example the U.S. has a large base at Pine Gap near Alice Springs, Australia, which listens to communication signals from all over the world.\nEavesdropping is also surveillance, but often without much planning. It means listening to things you aren't supposed to hear. It is a deliberate act, rather than simply overhearing someone else talking.\nSurveillance methods.\nMany people engage in surveillance for many purposes. That purpose may be crime prevention, alerting for attacks, or general gathering of information for a politcal purpose. The results of surveillance are sometimes called \"intelligence\". Surveillance collects information for police, intelligence agencies, military planners or commercial firms.\nThis may include observation from a distance by means of electronic equipment (such as CCTV cameras), or interception of electronically transmitted information (such as internet traffic or phone calls). \nSurveillance may include simple, relatively low-technology methods such as watchtowers, human intelligence agents and postal interception. On the other hand, global surveillance is done by satellite cameras on a daily basis. Such satellites are called \"reconnaissance satellite\" or spy satellites.\nThe word ' comes from a French phrase for \"watching over\" (\"sur\" means \"from above\" and \"veiller\" means \"to watch\")."}

Distributions were introduced in the middle of the 20th century by Laurent Schwartz, who received a Fields Medal for his work on them. The Fields medal is comparable to a Nobel Prize in mathematics, which does not exist. \nDistributions were introduced to model certain concepts from Physics. Physics has the concept of a \"mass of points in space\". The Dirac delta function can model an electromagnetic charge of a point in space. The Dirac delta function is zero everywhere, except at one point, where it is infinitely large. This needs to be the case, because the density function needs to be 1. There is no function that can meet this criterion, except if integraton is taken as a \"function\" in the mathematical sense.\nToday, distributions are used in different fields of mathematics and physics, for example to model Partial differential equations or Fourier analyses, which are important for Quantum electrodynamics or signal processing."}

Macro photography is about photographing objects that are very close to the lens, the film or the sensor. Using the classic definition, in macro photography the image shown on the film plane (or sensor) is nearly as big as the object photographed. There are different ways to achieve this. The most common one is to use a specialised \"macro\" lens. Such lenses are good at focussing sharply on a small area approaching the size of the film frame. Most 35mm format macro lenses achieve at least 1:2, that is to say, the image on the film is half the size of the object being photographed. Many 35mm macro lenses are 1:1, meaning the image on the 135 film is the same size as the object being photographed. Another important difference is that lenses designed for macro are usually at their sharpest at macro focus distances and are not quite as sharp at other focus distances.\nIn recent years, the term \"macro\" has been used in marketing material to mean being able to focus on a subject close enough so that when a regular 6\u00d74\u00a0inch (15\u00d710\u00a0cm) print is made, the image is life-size or larger. With 35mm film this requires a magnification ratio of only approximately 1:4, which demands less of lens quality than 1:1. With digital cameras the actual image size is rarely stated, so that the magnification ratio is largely irrelevant; cameras instead advertise their closest focusing distance.\nTypical subjects are still life, such as fruit, flowers, jewelry and small household objects. Macro photography often reveals details of the subject not visible with the naked eye.\nProblems with macro photography.\nThere are two main problems with macro photography:"}

For large corpora, about 40% to 60% of the words (counting by type) are \"hapax legomena\", and another 10% to 15% are \"dis legomena\". In the Brown Corpus of American English, about half of the 50,000 words are \"hapax legomena\" within that corpus.\nNote that \"hapax legomenon\" refers to a word's appearance in a body of text, and does not talk about its origin nor how often it is used in speech. For this reason, it is different from a nonce word, which may never be recorded, or which may find currency and may be widely recorded, or which may appear several times in the work which coins it, and so on."}

The Gulf would go as far as Indio, California if there wasn't a large river delta made by the Colorado River. This delta blocks the sea from flooding the Mexicali and Imperial Valleys. Volcanoes can be found along the East Pacific Rise. The island of Isla Tortuga is one example of the volcanoes found.\nIslands.\nThe Gulf of California has two large islands, the Isla \u00c1ngel de la Guarda and Tibur\u00f3n Island. It also has several smaller ones, including Isla Espiritu Santo and Isla Partida which is joined to it by a small bit of land."}

His longtime band was the Electric Light Orchestra (also known as ELO), but he worked with many other artists, including Duane Eddy, members of the Travelling Wilburys (Lynne himself was one also), and The Beatles.\nLynne first became known as a member of a band called The Idle Race. He taught himself about recording with a simple reel-to-reel tape recorder at home, using \"sound on sound\" to build up the sound of his own music. He later joined The Move, which then re-formed as Electric Light Orchestra. Lynne did not collaborate with ELO's members, as much as he directed how each member should play and sound. His work with ELO was often compared to music by The Beatles. Even John Lennon, the Beatles's founder, called ELO a \"Son of Beatles\" kind of band, before his death in 1980. Lynne also performed music for two movie soundtracks, \"All This and World War II\" and \"Electric Dreams\".\nElectric Light Orchestra's fame lessened during the 1980s. Lynne began to produce other, sometimes older recording artists, some of whom had new hits after years without them. A friend introduced Lynne to George Harrison, another former Beatle, who planned a comeback album in the late 1980s. Their collaboration, \"Cloud Nine\", reawakened interest in Harrison and his music.\nAfter the success of \"Cloud Nine\", Lynne and Harrison formed the Travelling Wilburys with Tom Petty, Bob Dylan and Roy Orbison. They became a popular group.\nEarly in the 1990s, the surviving Beatles completed a documentary series telling their own history. George Martin, their original producer, could not play as big a role as he had, because he had lost some of his hearing. Lynne was chosen to work with them. Yoko Ono handed over demos of five unfinished John Lennon songs, and two were chosen for the rest of the band to overdub (add parts to). Lynne used his studio knowhow to develop finished records from the raw demos, and the songs became hits, over twenty years since the Beatles issued a new recording.\nLynne moved to Los Angeles, California, and bought a house, which he turned into a large recording studio, with places to plug in equipment in nearly every room. He formed a new lineup of ELO in the early 2000s, recording a new album and beginning a tour, but interest was short-lived, and many shows were cancelled.\nLynne's music with ELO is popular again, through its use in television commercials. He continues to write and produce new music."}

The total Palestinian population, including descendants, is estimated at approximately 10 million, roughly half continuing to live in the region of historic Palestine, an area encompassing Israel proper, the West Bank including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip and Jordan. In this combined area, as of 2009, they constitute a majority of 51% of all inhabitants, some of whom are internally displaced persons. The remainder, just over half of all Palestinians, comprise what is known as the Palestinian diaspora, most of whom are stateless Palestinian refugees lacking citizenship in any country. Of the diaspora, over two and a half million live in neighboring Jordan, one million is shared between Syria and Lebanon, a quarter million in Saudi Arabia, and Chile's half a million is the largest concentration outside the Arab world.\nBy religious affiliation, most Palestinians are Muslim, particularly of the Sunni branch of Islam, and there is a significant Palestinian Christian minority of various Christian denominations, as well as smaller religious communities. As the commonly applied term \"Palestinian Arab\" ethnonym implies, the current traditional vernacular of Palestinians, irrespective of religion, is the Palestinian dialect of Arabic. For those who are citizens of Israel, known also as Arab Israelis, many are now also bilingual in Modern Hebrew. Recent genetic research has demonstrated that ancient Levantines cluster predominantly with modern-day Palestinians and the Bedouins who live in the same region. Similarly, it shows that Palestinians as an ethnic group represent modern \"descendants of a core population that lived in the area since prehistoric times,\" largely predating the Arabian Muslim conquest that resulted in their acculturation and established Arabic as the lingua franca, which eventually became the sole vernacular of the locals, most of whom would over time also convert to Islam from various prior faiths.\nThe first widespread use of \"Palestinian\" as an endonym to refer to the nationalist concept of a Palestinian people by the local Arabic-speaking population of Palestine began prior to the outbreak of World War I, and the first demand for national independence was issued by the Syrian-Palestinian Congress on 21 September 1921. After the creation of Israel, the exodus of 1948, and more so after the exodus of 1967, the term came to signify not only a place of origin, but the sense of a shared past and future in the form of a Palestinian nation-state. The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) represents the Palestinian people before the international community. The Palestinian National Authority, officially established as a result of the Oslo Accords, is an interim administrative body nominally responsible for governance in Palestinian population centres in the West Bank and Gaza Strip."}

The hatches are usually in hospitals or social centers or churches and consist of a door or flap in an outside wall which opens onto a soft bed, heated or at least insulated. Sensors in the bed alert carers when a baby has been put in it so that they can come and take care of the child. It will be cared for by hospital staff. If it is not claimed within a given time period, it will be given up for adoption. These hatches are popular in Germany and Pakistan.\nOne reason baby hatches are used is because some mothers can't take care of their babies.\nHistory.\nBaby hatches started in medieval times.

This social whale is known as the \"unicorn of the sea\" because the male has a very long tusk. Very little is known about this whale. Narwhal means \"corpse whale\" in Old Norse.\nDescription.\nLarge male narwhals can grow to a length of 15 feet, and weigh up to two tons. A female can give birth once every three years, after a pregnancy of 15 months. At birth, the baby narwhal is about five feet long and weighs about 180 pounds.\nAll narwhals have two teeth in their upper jaw and a tusk. After the first year of a male narwhal's life, its left tooth grows outward, spirally. There are some narwhals that are double-tusked, but they are not as common. This long, single or double tooth projects from its upper jaw and can grow to be 8.75 feet (2.7 meters) long. Tusks are usually twisted in a counterclockwise direction and are hollow inside. The tusk's function is uncertain, perhaps used as a formidable jousting weapon in courtship and dominance rivalry, in getting food, and/or for channeling and amplifying sonar pulses (which they emit). The tusk is not used in hunting. Long ago, narwhal sightings probably reinforced (or started) the unicorn legends. In fact, when people found the horn of a dead narwhal washed up on shore, they thought that they had found the horn of a unicorn.\nNarwhal can dive deep into the sea to around 800 meters, but can also sometimes dive up to 1,500 meters. This makes them one of the deepest diving sea mammals.\nHabitat.\nNarwhals live in the icy waters of the Arctic seas. The Narwhal's thick skin, called blubber, keep them warm in the cold water. They do not go far away from ice. Narwhals live in groups of between 10 and 100. Narwhals are migrating animals who like to move from one place to live in another place for a while. In summer, groups of them move closer to land, where they can sometimes be seen in the estuaries, deep fjords, and bays of Greenland, Northern Canada and as far eastern Russia. In Winter they move back to the icy waters, where they breathe from small holes in the ice. \nNarwhals can hunt under ice and like to eat Arctic fish such as the flatfish Greenland halibut, the polar and Arctic cod, shrimp and squid. They suck in their prey when they get close. \nNarwhals are both hunted by polar bears and killer whales. The native Inuit people, sometimes called the Eskimos, are still allowed to hunt the Narwhals for their meat and for the tusks. The tusks are sold with or without carving. The annual value received from Narwhal hunts in Hudson Bay is $530,000, of which $370,000 is for meat, $150,000 for tusks, bones and teeth of males, and $10,000 for teeth and bones of females."}

This behaviour included glossolalia (or \"speaking in tongues\"), shaking, and signs of mental or emotional disturbances . In the indigenous language, people who were taking part in the Vailala Madness called it \"iki haveve\", or \"belly-don't know,\" which was another way of saying \"dizziness.\"\nThe people in the movement thought that a 'Ghost Steamer' would come. This ship would be piloted by dead people who were coming back. The dead people would bring with them cargo with tinned food and tools. In one version of the story, the dead people would bring guns to kick the white colonizers out, but not everybody agrees that this was what people in the Vailala Madness actually believed."}

It was the first road connecting Riverside County to the Colorado River.\nThe part which remains today is a graded dirt road which crosses southeastern Riverside County and a part of Imperial County, beginning roughly 12 miles/19km east of North Shore and ending about 14 miles/23km southwest of Blythe for a total of 70 miles/113km.\nHistory.\nThe trail is named for trailblazer William David Bradshaw who first crossed the area in 1862. A former forty-niner, Bradshaw knew that the northern gold mines were rapidly emptying and that miners and other people leaving the area would need a more direct trail from the south across the desert to the new gold strike at La Paz. Without a direct trail, they would have to travel a great distance southeast to Yuma, then north up the river to La Paz. Bradshaw was a smart man; he knew there were lots of chances to make money in a gold boomtown.\nOriginally 180 miles/290km long, the western end of the trail began east of San Bernardino in the San Gorgonio Pass. Bradshaw and his party travelled southeast to the northern tip of the Salton Sink, turning due east to the foothills of the Orocopia Mountains and an existing stage stop called \"Dos Palmas.\"\nLeaving Dos Palmas, the men continued eastward between the Orocopia and Chocolate mountain ranges, briefly passing by the southern end of the Chuckwalla range and ending at the Palo Verde Valley. Once they crossed the Colorado River, the party rode upstream for about four miles to the gold fields. Despite the fact that the trail crossed mostly barren desert, there was lots of water to be found at water holes found at roughly thirty-mile/48km intervals.\nBetween 1862 and 1877, the Bradshaw Trail was the main route between Southern California and the La Paz gold fields.\nThe trail today.\nThe remaining part of the Bradshaw Trail mostly crosses public land. The extreme eastern end of the trail at Ripley does not. Use of a four wheel drive vehicle is recommended to travel across the trail. There are no services on the trail itself.\nAnother fact to consider is the Chocolate Mountain Aerial Gunnery Range which borders a part of the Bradshaw Trail to the south. This is a live bombing range and is clearly marked.\n\"See also: Wiley's Well\""}

It is also the name of the area around it.\nIt is named after Palo Verde storekeeper and postmaster A.P. Wiley. In 1907, Mr. Wiley dug deep into a shallow well dug in 1876 by a stagecoach company which used the nearby Bradshaw Trail. Wiley made the well larger since he hoped that he could attract business to his remote desert store. The well was taken care of by local ranchers and cattlemen for years afterward. However, the rapidly falling level of the water meant a drop of the water's depth to 60'/18m within a dozen years. Today, the well's original depth is only about 20'/6m at best after wet weather. The water in the well is not good for drinking.\nIn 1985, the Bureau of Land Management drilled a new well 965'/294m deep to support the new Wiley's Well Campground, one of only two developed campgrounds in the Mule Mountains Long-Term Visitor Area. The water is both hot at 90\u00a0\u00b0F/32\u00a0\u00b0C and full of minerals. The water is pumped into a cistern to help cool it to drinking temperature.\nWiley's Well is popular with rockhounds. They have been coming to Wiley's Well since the 1930s with the discovery of geode beds. Even though Wiley's Well has been very popular with rockhounds over the decades, the area remains rich with such minerals as chalcedony, citrine, quartz crystals, rhyolite and jasper. Though winters are mild, making the campground popular with visitors who visit every year from colder areas, summer can be extremely hot with recorded temperatures as high as 130\u00a0\u00b0F/54\u00a0\u00b0C. \nWiley's Well is easy to reach. It is off the Wiley's Well Road exit from Interstate 10, sixteen miles/26km west of Blythe. The entrance to the campground is nine miles/14km south of the highway. "}

Some are traditional areas and some are for local government or other government things.\nCounties (Traditional).\nThese counties are sometimes called \"historic counties\", \"traditional counties\" or \"ancient or geographical counties\". People argue about how much they exist in law. They are useful for genealogical and historic matters. Anyone may choose to use traditional counties or not.\nThe traditional counties have had nothing to do with government since 1889. However until 1974 most local government counties were very like them.\nThe United Kingdom has 92 traditional counties.\nCounties (Local Government) Districts &amp; Principal Areas.\n\"See also\"\nLocal government administrative areas have different functions and powers in each of the different countries in the United Kingdom (England and the devolved administrations of Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales) This resulted from devolution of administrative, executive, or legislative authority to the new institutions operating. The areas administered by local government have different types of names in the different parts of the United Kingdom.\nThere is a total of 326 English districts. As the structure of local government in England is not uniform, there are currently four principal types of district-level subdivision (numbers shown in brackets)\nAs a result, in parts of England there are local government counties with districts in them.[1] In other parts there are counties with just one district, and in those parts there is only one council, which is the district council or the county council.[2] Greater London is not a county; it has City of London, London Borough Councils, and a Greater London Authority. The Council of the Isles of Scilly is unique but is in effect a county council operating as unitary authority.\nIn Scotland there are \"local government areas\"[3] but most people call them \"council areas\".\nIn Wales there are \"principal areas\".[4] Some councils' areas in Wales are called \"counties\" and others \"county boroughs\".\nIn 1972, administrative functions in the Counties of Northern Ireland were replaced by 26 unitary authorities.[5]\nCeremonial Counties &amp; Lieutenancy Areas.\nThe Queen appoints officers called \"lord-lieutenants\" and High Sheriff in ceremonial counties and lieutenancy areas. The UK area in which their duties are carried out is usually called a \"ceremonial county\" except in Scotland, where they are called \"Lieutenancy Areas\". In Scotland only a lord-lieutenant is appointed to each lieutenancy area.\nCeremonial Counties (England, Northern Ireland and Wales).\nA ceremonial county in England and Wales is a local government county or a group of local government counties.

Water, when split, gives oxygen, hydrogen, and electrons. These electrons move through structures in chloroplasts and, by \"chemiosmosis\", make ATP.\nThe hydrogen is converted to NADPH, which is then used in the light-independent reactions. Oxygen gas diffuses out of the organism as a waste product. This all happens in the \"grana thylakoid\" of chloroplasts.\nHistory.\nColin Flannery first put forward the idea that photosynthesis needs light in 1779. He realised that sunlight falling on plants was needed. Joseph Priestley had noted the release of oxygen gas in 1772, but he did not see the link with light.\nIn 1931 Cornelius Van Niel proposed that photosynthesis is a case of a general mechanism where a photon of light is used to photodecompose a hydrogen donor, with the hydrogen being used to reduce .\nIn 1939 Robin Hill found that isolated chloroplasts would make oxygen but not fix , showing that the light and dark reactions occurred in different places. This led later to the discovery of photosystem 1 and 2."}

It is a deep-fried ball or patty made from ground chickpeas, fava beans, or both. Falafel is made from chickpeas or fava beans. Spices are added to these. Falafel is either made into a ball, or a disc, which is then fried. The dish originally came from Egypt. Today, it is a popular form of fast food in the Middle East, where it is also served as a mezze. In Israel it is served as street food.\nOrigin of the word.\nThe word is pronounced (fuh-lah-full); .\nIn Egyptian and Sudanese Arabic it is called \"Ta'amiyya\".\nThe Arabic word \"falafel\" (\"fal\u0101fil\") may be the plural of () 'pepper'. More relevantly, it is an adjective for \"fluffy\"/\"crunchy\" things, as in (), a kind of cooked rice, and (), curly hair. Different spellings in English include \"felafel\" and \"filafil\".\nDifferent ways of serving falafel.\nFalafel is usually served in a pita-like bread called lafa, either inside the bread, which acts as a pocket, or wrapped in a flat bread. In many countries falafel is a popular street food or fast food. The falafel balls, whole or crushed, may be topped with salads, pickled vegetables and hot sauce, and drizzled with tahini-based sauces. Falafel balls may also be eaten alone as a snack or served as part of a mezze. During Ramadan, they are sometimes eaten as part of an iftar, the meal which breaks the daily fast after sunset.\nHistory.\nFalafel was originally made with fava beans. When the dish was used more to the north, chickpeas were more common, so they were used instead. The chickpea was used as a food item in the Levant before 4000 BC.\nAccording to Ynetnews, \"A common theory suggests falafel was invented some 1000 years ago by the Egyptian Copts. They took it with them when they moved to the rest of the Middle East. Another theory dates the invention of falafel as far as the 6th century AD, or even earlier, placing it on the subcontinent of India, which is known until today for making various chickpea-based dishes\".\nIngredients.\nFalafel is made from fava beans or chickpeas or a combination of the two. In Egypt, fava beans are used exclusively. Other variations may contain only chickpeas. This is the case of Palestinians, Yemenite Jews in Jerusalem as well as in Syria and Lebanon. In the Levant, Falafel is generally made only with chickpeas. Unlike many other bean patties, in falafel the beans are not cooked before they are used. Instead they are soaked, possibly skinned, then ground, a small quantity of onions, parsley, spices (including cumin), and bicarbonate of soda are added. It is then deep fried at a high temperature. Sesame seeds may be added to the balls before they are fried; this is particularly common when falafel is served as a dish on its own rather than as a sandwich filling.\nRecent culinary trends have seen the chickpea falafel have more success than fava bean falafel. Chickpea falafels are served across the Middle East, and have been popularized by expatriates of those countries living abroad. However, fava-bean falafel continue to predominate in Egypt and Sudan and their respective expatriate communities, and Egyptians are fond of deriding chickpea falafel as inferior.\nIn Israel small 2.5\u00a0cm spherical balls are made, while in Egypt and among Palestinians larger patties are shaped with a tablespoon or a special scoop with a lever to release them into the hot oil.\nVariations.\nThe kind of bread used for falafel may be different. Outside the Middle East, pita bread is often used as a pocket and stuffed with the different ingredients; in Arab countries a round khubz bread, 'eish' in Egypt, is halved, and the two resulting round pieces are used to create a cigar-shaped wrap. There, hummus (chickpeas pureed with tahini) is rarely used as a condiment, the usual sauce is tahini (sesame seed paste) thinned with water and lemon. The most common salad ingredients are tomato and parsley. In Lebanon, parsley is mixed with chopped mint leaves. It is also common in Syria and Lebanon to add pickles; the two canonical ones are pickled turnip, colored pink with beetroot, and pickled cucumber. Recently, there has been a new \"filled\" falafel, its center usually consisting of ground meat or minced onions or a boiled egg. These fillings are wrapped by the uncooked falafel mixture, and then deep fried.\nThe salads or the pita itself may be seasoned with salt or sumac, which is very commonly used in Syria; alternatively, these may be sprinkled on top.\nEgyptian falafel (Ta'amiyya).\nEgyptian falafel is made from Phaseolus vulgaris or fried Vicia faba grains.\nSyrian falafel.\nFalafel made of bean beans with ground chickpeas and fried in a pretzel shape with a hole in the middle and coated with sesame."}

Originally it comes from Piedmont, where rice is commonly grown. It is very important for the cuisine of Milan. Common ingredients of the base recipe are white wine, and onions.\nRisotto is a class of Italian rice dishes cooked in broth to a creamy consistency. The broth may be meat-, fish-, or vegetable-based. Many types of risotto contain Parmesan cheese, butter, and onion. It is one of the most common ways of cooking rice in Italy.\nRisotto is normally a \"primo\" (first course), served on its own before the main course, but \"risotto alla milanese\" is often served together with ossobuco alla milanese.\nRice varieties.\nA high-starch (amylopectin), low-amylose round medium- or short-grain rice is usually used to make risotto. Such rices have the ability to absorb liquids and to release starch and so they are stickier than the long grain varieties.\nThe principal varieties used in Italy are Arborio, Baldo, Carnaroli, Maratelli, Padano, Roma, and Vialone Nano. Carnaroli, Maratelli and Vialone Nano are considered to be the best (and most expensive) varieties, with different users preferring one over the other. They have slightly different properties. For example, Carnaroli is less likely than Vialone Nano to get overcooked, but the latter, being smaller, cooks faster and absorbs condiments better. Other varieties like Roma, Baldo, Ribe and Originario may be used but will not have the creaminess of the traditional dish. These varieties are considered better for soups and other non-risotto rice dishes and for making sweet rice desserts. Rice designations of Superfino, Semifino and Fino refer to the size and shape (specifically the length and the narrowness) of the grains, and not the quality.\nBasic preparation.\nThere are many different risotto recipes with different ingredients, but they are all based on rice of an appropriate variety cooked in a standard procedure.\nThe rice is first cooked briefly in a soffritto of onion and butter or olive oil to coat each grain in a film of fat, this is called \"tostatura\"; white or red wine is added and has to be absorbed by the grains. When it has evaporated, the heat is raised to medium high and very hot stock is gradually added in small amounts while stirring gently, almost constantly: stirring loosens the starch molecules from the outside of the rice grains into the surrounding liquid, creating a smooth creamy-textured liquid. At that point it is taken off the heat for the \"mantecatura\" when diced cold butter and finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese are vigorously stirred in to make the texture as creamy and smooth as possible. It may be removed from the heat a few minutes earlier, and left to cook with its residual heat. Seafood risotti generally do not include cheese.\nProperly cooked risotto is rich and creamy but still with some resistance or bite: al dente, and with separate grains. The traditional texture is fairly fluid, or \"all'onda\" (\"wavy, or flowing in waves\"). It is served on flat dishes and it should easily spread out but not have excess watery liquid around the perimeter. It must be eaten at once as it continues to cook in its own heat and can become too dry with the grains too soft.\nVariations.\nRisotto can be made using many kinds of vegetable, meat, fish, seafood and legumes, and different types of wine and cheese may be used. There is even, exceptionally, an Italian strawberry risotto.\nMany variations have their own names:"}

It started on April 24, 1916 and ended on April 29, 1916. It was carried out by members of the Irish Republican Brotherhood and members of the Irish Citizens Army. It was done to protest against British rule in Ireland. \nAt first, the Irish had planned to have a larger number of men attack the city. But a man called Sir Roger Casement was captured on the way back from Germany with guns and the Irish had very few guns. As a result, only about 1,250 men took part in the rising. Out of these about 300 went into the General Post Office (GPO) in Dublin led by P\u00e1draig Pearse and James Connolly. Other groups took over different parts of the city, for example St. Stephen's Green, Shelbourne Hotel, Boland's Mills and Jacobs Factory. At first the British put up no resistance because of Easter public holiday, but soon more of them came into Dublin to fight the Irish. \nThe biggest fighting happened at Bolands Mills where \u00c9amon de Valera had his men open fire on British soldiers called \"Sherwood Foresters\" while they landed in the city. The shootings here killed about 200 people and wounded several more. St. Stephen's Green was a big part of the fighting as well where the Irish lost a lot of men. After six days the Irish were exhausted and were being shot at by huge artillery pieces mounted onto a British ship called HMS Helga. The General Post Office was badly hit and soon the Irish surrendered. Sixteen of the Irish leaders were shot by firing squad after the Rising.\nThe British admitted that they lost 155 men to Irish gunfire and 200 were wounded. The Irish rebels lost at least 70 men and over 1,000 of them were wounded. At least 100 Irish citizens were killed in the crossfire as well. After the rising, Dublin was in very bad shape and several hundred people had been killed.\nAfter the rebellion.\nAfter the Easter Rising conflict, the leaders of the rebellion were given trials in British courts and were sentenced to death. Fourteen were executed by British soldiers at Kilmainham jail in Dublin. The prisoners eyes were covered with blindfolds and they were shot. Among them were the leaders, Patrick Pearse and James Connolly. Another leader, Thomas Kent was later shot in Cork, Ireland. Roger Casement was hanged in London, England.\nAt first the people in Dublin were confused and angry, because many had died and food supplies were cut off. But after the British shot the leaders, some of the Irish people began to follow and support them in sympathy for their cause. The Easter Rising was a major reason for the creation of the Irish Republic and the Irish War of Independence."}

It is the only member of the genus Phyllopteryx. It is found in water 3 to 50 m deep around the south coast of Australia, from Port Stephens, New South Wales to Geraldton, Western Australia. It also found in the waters around Tasmania. Weedy sea dragons are named for the weed-like growth on their bodies. This camouflage hides them as they move among the seaweed beds where they live. The weedy sea dragon is the aquatic emblem for the state of Victoria.\nDescription.\nWeedy sea dragons can reach 45\u00a0cm in length. They feed on tiny crustaceans and other zooplankton, which they suck into the end of their long tube-like nose. They don't have a tail that can wrap around and hold on to things the way a seahorse can. They swim in shallow reefs and weed beds, and look like weeds drifting over bare sand.\nBreeding.\nSea dragons, seahorses and pipe fish are the only species where the male carries the eggs. The male carries the fertilized eggs, joined under his tail. They stay there for about eight weeks until they . The young can look after themselves as soon as they are born. Breeding sea dragons in captivity is rare because scientists don't know what makes them breed in the wild. Keeping sea dragons in captivity is difficult as only about 60% will survive.\nThe Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, California, Melbourne Aquarium in Australia, and the Tennessee Aquarium in Chattanooga, Tennessee, are the only places in the world to have bred weedy sea dragons, though others have been able to get them to lay eggs.\nLeafy sea dragons.\nA relative of the weedy sea dragon is the leafy sea dragon \"Phycodurus eques\". In the November 2006, the \"National Geographic\" magazine, reported that marine biologist Greg Rouse is looking at the DNA of the two sea dragon species."}

It is known to come from our earliest infant universe. Since the universe is very large, and the speed of light is constant, we know that when the CMB light arrives from the infant universe, it arrives as the oldest signal that we can detect.\nDuring the Big Bang, a lot of high-energy radiation was created. Then, the universe became bigger and colder. Therefore, the high-energy photons lost most of their original energy. Now, as a result, that radiation is in the microwave part of the electromagnetic spectrum (the microwave part has quite low energy). The cosmic microwave background is the radiation that has been traveling without hitting anything ever since the time the universe became transparent, about 380,000 years after the Big Bang. \nArno Penzias and Robert Wilson first detected the CMB radiation. Scientists think that the existence of CMB radiation is important evidence, with red shift, that the Big Bang theory is true. \nLater data is based on the Planck spacecraft operated by the European Space Agency (ESA). It was designed to observe differences in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at microwave and infra-red frequencies, with high sensitivity and small angular resolution. The spacecraft has finished its work, but researchers are still analyzing the data. The main interest is that there is:\nNo explanation for this is known."}

{"id": "183331", "revid": "7893583", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=183331", "title": "Lionel Messi", "text": "Lionel Andr\u00e9s \"Leo\" Messi Cuccittini (Spanish pronunciation: [ljo\u02c8nel an\u02c8d\u027ees \u02c8mesi]) (born 24 June 1987) is an Argentine footballer. He plays for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and the Argentina national team as a forward. \nMany experts and critics consider Messi as one of the greatest football players of all time. Some even say he is the greatest player ever. Messi has seven Ballon d'Or awards, the most of any player, and one more than Cristiano Ronaldo. His playing style and skills are very similar to the Argentine legend Diego Maradona because of their short height. There is much competition between him and Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo because of their similar skill levels.\nEarly Life.\nMessi was born and raised in Rosario, Argentina. Messi is the third of four children of Jorge Messi and his wife Celia Cuccittini. He has two brothers named Rodrigo and Matias and two cousins named Maximiliano and Emanuel.\nMessi's grandmother died when he was 11, and after that he generally celebrates his goals by pointing up in the sky in tribute of his grandmother.\nClub Career.\nFC Barcelona.\nMessi began football at a young age and his potential was quickly seen by Barcelona. He left Newell's Old Boys' youth team in September 2000 and moved with his family to Europe in February 2001. He officially signed with Barcelona in December 2000 on a napkin. They moved to Spain because Barcelona offered their help to treat his growth hormone deficiency, and Newell's didn't offer any help. \nMessi played his first professional match at 16 years old on 16 November 2003 against Porto. He played the 2003-04 season with Barcelona B. He was promoted to the first team for the 2004-05 season, and made his league debut on 16 October 2004 against Espanyol as a substitute. He made his league debut at age 17, and became the youngest player to play for Barcelona's first team in an official competition. He scored his first professional goal on 1 May 2005 against Albacete from an assist by Ronaldinho. The goal made him the youngest-ever scorer for the club at that time. Barcelona won La Liga that season for the first time in 6 years, and won the league for a second time in a row along with the Spanish Super Cup and UEFA Champions League in 2006. \nHis first breakthrough season was in the 2006\u201307 season; he became a first team regular by scoring his first hat-trick of his career in El Cl\u00e1sico. On 18 April 2007, he scored a goal similar to Maradona's \"Goal of the Century\" against England in the 1986 World Cup, where Maradona got the ball behind the halfway line on the right side and beat 4 defenders and the goalie to score. Messi's goal was similar to this; he received a pass from Xavi on the right side behind half-field, and then megged an opponent and 4 others including the goalie before finishing off with his right foot inside the penalty box. In 2019, Barcelona fans voted it as the best goal in the club's history, receiving 45% of votes. After Ronaldinho left the club at the end of the 2007-08 season, Messi was handed the number 10 shirt. Maybe his most successful season was the 2008\u201309 season. In this season, Messi scored 38 goals, including one in the Champions League final against Manchester United that Barcelona won 2\u20130 as part of their treble. In the following 2009\u201310 season, Messi scored 47 goals in all games. That equals to Ronaldo's (Brazilian) record total for Barcelona. Messi also won his first Ballon d'Or in December 2009, and also won his second a year later. He scored again in the 2011 Champions League final against their same opponent two years earlier, Manchester United. Barcelona won 3-1. Messi won his third Ballon d'Or in a row that year. \nParis Saint-Germain.\nAfter a situation involving FC Barcelona and their overwhelming wage bill, Messi made the controversial switch to the French football club Paris-Saint Germain. \nInternational Career.\nArgentina.\nMessi was allowed to play for both Spain and Argentina since he had dual-nationality, but he decided to play for his home country, Argentina. He led the team to the final game of the 2005 U-20 World Cup by scoring important goals in the knockout stages. Messi scored two goals in the final against Nigeria, and Argentina won 2\u20131. In addition to receiving a winner's medal, Messi was also awarded the Golden Shoe for most goals scored (6), and Golden Ball for best player.\nMessi played his first game with the senior team on 17 August 2005 against Hungary. He came on as a substitute. However, he was shown a red card two minutes later for hitting an opponent in the face on accident while Messi was trying to pull the opponent off from his shirt. He was very disappointed by this. Messi scored his first goal for Argentina in a friendly against Croatia on 1 March 2006. Argentina lost the game 3-2. He was selected for the 2006 World Cup by coach Jos\u00e9 Pekerman. In Argentina's second game against Serbia, he became their youngest player to play at a World Cup. He also assisted a goal scored the last one in the 6\u20130 victory. That goal made him the youngest goalscorer in the 2006 World Cup. \nMessi won the 2008 Olympics with Argentina as well, as he assisted \u00c1ngel Di Maria's goal in the final against Nigeria in Beijing. Messi was made captain of the national team in 2011. He scored his first hat-trick with the country in his 68th appearance during a 3-1 victory against Switzerland in February 2012.\nOn 21 June 2016, he broke the top scoring record for Argentina by scoring his 55th goal with a free-kick against the United States in the Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario. The record was held by Gabriel Batistuta with 54 goals.\nRetirement.\nOn 26 June, Argentina once again lost to Chile on penalties 4-2 in the Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario final after a 0\u20130 tie. Messi missed his penalty in the penalty shootout. This was Messi's third consecutive defeat in a major tournament final with Argentina, and his fourth overall. A day after the match, Messi announced his retirement from international football. In an emotional interview after the game, he said he was very sad that he missed the penalty and also sad that he wasn't able to win any trophies in four finals.\nReturn from Retirement.\nHe came out of retirement in October 2016 for the 2018 World Cup qualifiers.\nAfter a slow start to the 2018 FIFA World Cup, he helped Argentina qualify to the next round of the competition by scoring the first goal in the 2-1 win over Nigeria.\nPersonal life.\nRelationships.\nMessi has three children with his wife Antonella Roccuzzo. They are named Thiago Messi, Mateo Messi and Ciro Messi. Thiago was born on 2 November 2012, Mateo was born on 11 September 2015 and Ciro was born on 10 March 2018. On the bottom of Messi's cleats is the name of his first son, Thiago.\nMessi and Antonella married in June 2017.\nCharity.\nWhen not playing on the field, Messi finds time to do charity work. He started the Leo Messi Foundation in 2007 which helps children in at-risk situations. Messi also opened a kids park for children living in a hospital in Barcelona.\nTax Issues.\nIn July 2016 he was convicted of tax fraud and sentenced to spend 21 months in prison. Messi was also fined two million Euros. Messi never went to prison, and the problem was be solved with probation. He told the court he \"only played football\" and didn't know anything because he left his money problems to be dealt with by his father, Jorge Messi.\nHonours.\nClub.\nBarcelona\nInternational.\nArgentina U20\nArgentina Olympic team\nArgentina Senior team"}

The voice calls out a color, a number, or both, depending on the game selected, and the player flips the unit so that the correct knob is facing upwards. After every four points, the game becomes faster. If the player responds incorrectly, the round is ended and the unit will make a raspberry sound. There are six games in total - three where the player has to follow the command, one memory game that uses a combination of colors and numbers, a code buster game and a game called Pass Attack where players have to make up their own pattern. When the game has finished, the electronic unit will say \"This game is finished!\" After a pause the game will encourage the player to play the game again by saying \"Wanna warp again?\" In Brain Warp, the player can select between one of the six different games.\nThe Star Wars version is grey and is in the shape of the Death Star. Each knob has the same color from Brain Warp in a and has a Star Wars character which include:\nIn 2007, a follow up to Brain Warp was released by Hasbro called Hyperslide which features the Code Buster game from Brain Warp and has four discs which all have a different color.\nHistory.\nThe game was the most popular in Duracell's Kids' Choice National Toy Survey in 1996. During the manufacturing process, there were some units of Brain Warp that contained an earlier revision of the game. The earlier revision was able to cope with faster speeds between 36-44 points on the three reflex games, Colors, Numbers and Combo than the original revision. The revision also had some unused sound files in test mode and had a different background music compared to the newer revision. Also, there was a bug in the older revision that lead to the voice and sound effects not in the right pitch against the music. This also happened with Hasbro's Bop It Extreme and Tiger's Boogey Ball game.\nBrain Shift.\nOn September 6, 1998, Tiger Electronics released a similar game to Brain Warp, a tabletop electronic audio game called Brain Shift. Players move a 'stick shift' in response to voice commands to complete color and sound patterns, and the game becomes increasingly fast. The game requires close attention, and teaches children to recognize and replicate patterns. It came second in the 1998 Duracell Kids' Choice National Toy Survey, and gained a \"Seal of Approval\" from the US-based National Parenting Center. The hype around the release by Tiger Electronics of the Furby at the same time allowed the company to concentrate its marketing on Brain Shift. This game has two different versions of introduction. It either says \"Ok, listen up\" or \"Alright!\" followed by its catchphrase, \"Get your brain in gear and let's play Brain Shift.\" This game has six colors: red, green, yellow, blue, orange and white. The game will then say \"Now choose your game\". Some units of Brain Shift glitch on low batteries and cut out \"your game\" with a \"you shift\". and there are six different games: After choosing a game, the voice will then say \"Now how many shifters do we have?\" The number of players will be selected and then the game will give a short explanation of how the game is played and then the game will commence.\nSome units of Brain Shift had a 'Tiger recommends Duracell' sticker attached to where the batteries are inserted. All sealed units had the stickers on the back of the packaging. This was because at that time, Tiger was allowed to promote Duracell batteries on their games. If the user press 'on' and 'pause' buttons on the front of the device and inserts one of the top right, bottom left and bottom right battery whilst there are three batteries in the unit, the game will enter test mode and play Happy Birthday To You using the sound that plays the melody during the game. Each color on the test mode will test different functions of the game. If the 'pause' button is pressed whilst in test mode, the user will be able to test the stick shift and the game will say the number followed by the colour.\nBrain Bash.\nThe first game from the Brain Family was released in 1994 by Tiger called Brain Bash. The game has four purple buttons and four yellow buttons. The game has five games that play in order. They all involve math. The main game is called Touch Command. The electronic voice issues voice commands to the players such as \"One touch one.\" Player one touches the yellow one button and then press purple one button.\nCatchphrases.\nEach Tiger Electronics brain game has several catchphrases including:\n\"Standard Brain Warp\"\n\"Star Wars Version\"\n\"Brain Shift\"\n\"Brain Bash\""}

She has been credited by Caltrans with the idea of using a painted line to separate lanes of traffic on a highway. This is now in use all over the world.\nMcCarroll was born and raised in the Adirondacks. She attended a medical college in Chicago. She moved to Southern California in 1904 with her first husband, John Robertson. They had hoped that the desert climate would help him with his tuberculosis, but Robertson died in 1914. She later married Frank McCarroll, the local station manager for the Southern Pacific Railroad. From 1907 to 1916, she was the only physician regularly practicing in the vast desert between the Salton Sea and Palm Springs. She was also the only physician serving the area's five Indian reservations for the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\nIn the fall of 1917, McCarroll was driving on the road leading to her office near Indio, California on a stretch of highway that would later become part of U.S. Route 99. Today, that part of the highway is part of Indio Boulevard. She was literally run off the road by a truck, as she recalled many years later: \nMcCarroll soon told her idea to the local chamber of commerce and the Riverside County Board of Supervisors, but no one listened. Finally, she took it upon herself to hand-paint a white stripe down the middle of the road. This would later help drivers since they could now easily see the actual width of the lane and keep accidents like Nurse McCarroll's from happening again. Through the Indio Women's Club and many similar women's groups, Nurse McCarroll launched a statewide letter writing campaign to tell of her proposal. In November 1924, the idea was adopted by the California Highway Commission and 3,500 miles of lines were painted at a cost of $163,000. It would not be long before the idea was adopted worldwide.\nA memorial plaque to Dr. McCarroll may be found at the intersection of Indio Boulevard and Flower Street in Indio, California. On April 24, 2002, to honor her contribution to road safety, the State of California named the stretch of Interstate 10 near Indio east of the Indio Boulevard/Jefferson Street exit as \"The Doctor June McCarroll Memorial Freeway.\" To find the plaque with a GPS system, the coordinates are 33\u00ba43.260 N, 116\u00ba13.040 W."}

Before Christianity they practiced a religion as as the Romans with many gods. It grew during the 5th and 6th centuries one of the most churches in the world.\nIntroduction.\nRoman Christianity was late arriving in Ireland because the Roman armies never invaded the island. Consequently, Roman culture, and its brand of Roman Christianity, had little influence on early Irish Christianity. Because the educated class of the Celts, the Druids, had a long history of educational excellence and philosophic curiosity, they welcomed the new religion into Ireland as they did all new information. The ancient Greeks did student exchanges with the Druids, whom they considered the other great philosophers in Europe. Perhaps the most famous Greek scholar to study under the Druids was Pythagoras. \nIreland is the one country that had no martyrs when Christianity came into its territory. This prompted the Irish Christians of later years to develop the \"White Martyrdom\" of monks who lived austere lives as \"living martyrs.\" Christian worship had reached Ireland around 400 AD. Ireland at this time was still a Celtic nation, which the Roman Church called pagan. Contrary to common myth, the Irish did not abandon their Celtic culture in favor of Christianity. Rather, Christianity was woven into their culture. The Celtic cross reflects this mxture of the two. Celtic culture, unlike the very linear philosophy of Rome and Greece, was built upon a very cyclically minded philosophy, patterning itself after the seasonal cycles and life cycles they observed in their beloved natural world. The Celtic cross includes the cross to represent Christianity and the Circle to represent the Celtic world view.\nSuccesses.\nRoman Christianity, like Roman culture, was a city-based culture. All of the letters of Saint Paul that made it into the official Roman canon of the New Testament were written to new churches in various Roman cities. The Latin word for Celt was \"Galli\". Paul's letter to the Galatians was written to a Celtic settlement, uncharacteristically urban, in what is now Turkey. For most of its early history, the Roman church paid little attention to the country dwellers they called the \"Paganus,\" which is equivalent to the contemporary \"redneck\" or \"country bumpkin.\" Consequently, it was not the Roman missionaries who Christianized the vast majority of the European land mass. It was the monks from Ireland who were comfortable with the nature-loving ways of the Paganus. They traveled to mainland Europe and taught the countryfolk Celtic Christianity. \nDespite Rome's later philosophic battles against it, like those at the Synod of Whitby in 664 AD, Celtic Christianity remained the dominant form of Christianity in terms of numbers of adherents for the first thousand years of the Christian era. Most modern Christians do not know this because once Rome either converted, suppressed, or killed the adherents of what they saw as a heresy. They removed all reference to Celtic Christianity's legacy from the libraries of Europe - except the Irish libraries, material being translated only since Irish Independence in the early Twentieth Century.\nMyths.\nLegend says that Celtic Christianity in Britain was founded by St. Joseph of Arimathea; legend also says that King Arthur is buried in his ruined abbey. According to legend, Joseph was a tin merchant who was often coming and going to the tin mines of Roman Britain. Legend continues to say that he may have taken his nephew, Jesus, with him on some of these trips. Later Joseph of Aramathea becomes first keeper of the Holy Grail. Perhaps the best known myth about Celtic Christianity is that Saint Patrick brought Christianity to Ireland. Christianity was already established in Ireland by the time Patrick began his ministry. "}

In the battle, an alliance of Germanic tribes won a major victory over three Roman legions. The Germanic tribes were led by Arminius; the Roman legions by Publius Quinctilius Varus.\nThis was more than a victory, it was the complete destruction of three Roman legions and all their commanders; the few men who survived were made slaves. It was one of the two greatest disasters in Roman military history (the other being at the Battle of Cannae). Apart from occasional raids and campaigns, the Romans never again held the Germanic land across the Rhine.\nThe battle began a seven-year war which ended with the Rhine as the boundary of the Roman Empire for the next four hundred years, until the decline of the Western Roman Empire.\nThe leaders.\nThe Roman commander, Varus, was about the fourth most important man in Rome. He was known and feared because of his ruthless actions and his crucifixion of defeated enemies. It is certain this was known to the Germans, and may have helped the tribes come together to resist him.\nThe German commander was Arminius, who had been given a Roman military education. He had spent his youth in Rome as a hostage. Therefore, he knew Roman military methods: this knowledge was to be crucial.\nLater, Arminius returned to Germania with Varus, and became his trusted advisor. In secret, he forged an alliance of Germanic tribes that had traditionally been enemies. He was helped to do this by the anger over Varus' insolence and cruelty to the people he defeated.\n\"...Stratagem was, therefore, indispensable; and it was necessary to blind Varus to their schemes until a favorable opportunity should arrive for striking a decisive blow...\" British historian Edward Shepherd Creasy (1812\u20131878)\nWhile Varus was on his way from his summer camp, west of the Weser river, to the winter headquarters near the Rhine, he heard reports of a local rebellion. This was faked by Arminius.\n\"...This was represented to Varus as an occasion which required his prompt attendance at the spot; but he was kept in studied ignorance of its being part of a concerted national rising; and he still looked on Arminius as his submissive vassal...\" Edward Shepherd Creasy\nRecent archaeological finds place the battle at Kalkriese Hill in Osnabr\u00fcck County, Lower Saxony. The Romans must at this time have been marching northwestward from the area that is now the city of Detmold, passing east of Osnabr\u00fcck; they must then have camped in this area before being attacked.\nBattle.\nVarus's forces included three legions, six cohorts of auxiliary troops (non-citizens or allied troops) and three squadrons of cavalry. Many of them had little combat experience with Germanic fighters under local conditions.\nThe Roman forces were not marching in combat formation, and there were also large numbers of camp-followers. As they entered the forest they found the track narrow and muddy; according to Dio Cassius a violent storm had also arisen. He also writes that Varus neglected to send out advance reconnaissance parties.\nThe line of march was dangerously stretched out \u2013 estimates are that it was more than 15\u00a0km (9\u00a0miles), and was perhaps as long as 20\u00a0km (12\u00a0miles). It was then suddenly attacked by Germanic warriors who were carrying some light swords, large lances and spears that came with short and narrow blades, so sharp and warrior friendly that they could be used as required. The Germanic warriors surrounded the entire Roman army and rained down javelins on the intruders.\nThe Romans were able to set up a fortified night camp, and the next morning broke out into open country, near the modern town of Ostercappeln. The break-out cost them heavy losses, as did a further attempt to escape by marching through another forest area, with heavy rains continuing. The rain stopped them from using their bows because sinew strings become slack when wet, and left them virtually defenseless as their shields also became waterlogged.\nThe Romans then began a night march to escape, but marched into another trap that Arminius had set, at the foot of a hill near Osnabr\u00fcck. There, the sandy, open strip on which the Romans could march easily narrowed at the bottom of the hill. There was a gap of only about 100\u00a0m between the woods and the swampland at the edge of the Great Bog. The road was blocked by a trench, and, towards the forest, an earthen wall had been built along the roadside. This let the tribesmen to attack the Romans from cover.\nThe Romans made a desperate attempt to storm the wall, but failed. The Germanic warriors then stormed the field and slaughtered the Romans; Varus committed suicide.\nAround 15,000\u201320,000 Roman soldiers must have died; not only Varus, but also many of his officers are said to have taken their own lives by falling on their swords in the approved manner. Tacitus wrote that many officers were sacrificed by the Germans as part of their indigenous religious ceremonies, cooked in pots and their bones used for rituals. However, others were ransomed, and some of the common soldiers were enslaved.\nThe victory over the legions was followed by a clean sweep of all Roman forts, garrisons and cities \u2013 of which there were at least two \u2013 east of the Rhine. The remaining two Roman legions in Germany were stationed in a fort at Mainz, and commanded by Varus' nephew. They were content to try to hold the Rhine.\nVarus's mistakes.\nThough we can never know why Varus made these mistakes, his reputation for arrogance and over-confidence suggests he underestimated the Germans. But all Rome's previous experience, from Caesar onwards, had shown the Germanic tribes as strong in war.\nAftermath.\nUpon hearing of the defeat, the Emperor Augustus, according to the Roman historian Suetonius in his work \"De vita Caesarum\" (On the life of the Caesars), was so shaken by the news that he stood butting his head against the wall of his palace, repeatedly shouting:\n\u201e\"\"\u201c ('Quintilius Varus, give me back my legions!')\nThe three legion numbers were never used again by the Romans after this defeat, unlike other legions that were restructured \u2013 a case unique in Roman history.\nThe battle ended the period of triumphant Roman expansion that had followed the end of the Civil Wars 40 years earlier. Augustus' stepson Tiberius took effective control, and prepared for the continuation of the war. Three legions were sent to the Rhine to replace the lost legions.\nRoman retaliation.\nThough their shock at the slaughter was great, the Romans began a slow, systematic preparation to reconquer the country. In 14 AD, just after Augustus' death, and the accession of his heir and stepson Tiberius, a huge raid was led by the new emperor's nephew Germanicus.\nOn a starry night he massacred the Marsi and ravaged their villages with fire and sword. That night the Germans had celebrated; drunk and asleep, they were surprised by Germanicus. The temple of their deity was destroyed.\nSeveral other tribes were roused by this slaughter and ambushed Germanicus on the way to his winter-quarters, but were defeated with heavy losses.\nThe next year was marked by two major campaigns and several smaller battles with a large army estimated at 55,000\u201370,000 men, backed by naval forces. In spring 15 AD, the legate Caecina Severus invaded the Marsi a second time with 25,000\u201330,000 men, causing great havoc.\nMeanwhile, Germanicus' troops had built a fort on Mount Taunus from where he marched with 30 to 35,000 men against the Chatti (probably a region of villages) and slaughtered children, women and the elderly. The able-bodied men fled across a river and hid themselves in the forests. After this blow Germanicus marched on Mattium and burned the city down.\nIn summer 15 AD, the army visited the site of the first battle. According to Tacitus, they found heaps of bones, and skulls nailed to trees, which they buried, \"...looking on all as kinsfolk and of their own blood...\". Burial pits with remains fitting this description have been found at Kalkriese Hill.\nUnder Germanicus, the Romans marched another army, with allied Germanic soldiers, into Germania in 16 AD. He was able to fight his way across the Weser near modern Minden, suffering some losses. He forced Arminius' army to stand in open battle at the Weser River. Germanicus's legions inflicted huge casualties on the Germanic armies while sustaining only minor losses.\nOne final battle was fought at the Angivarian Wall, west of modern Hanover. Again many Germanic soldiers were killed, which forced them to flee. In summer 16 AD, Caius Silius marched against the Chatti with 33,000 men. Germanicus invaded the Marsi for a third time and devastated their land.\nWith his main goals reached and winter coming, Germanicus ordered his army back to their winter camps, with the fleet getting damaged in a storm in the North Sea. After a few more raids across the Rhine, with the recovery of two of the three Roman legions' eagles lost in 9 AD, Tiberius ordered the Roman forces to halt and withdraw across the Rhine. Germanicus was recalled to Rome and informed by Tiberius that he would be given a Triumph and a new command.\nGermanicus' campaign had been to revenge the defeat at Teutoburg, and also partly in reaction to signs of mutiny amongst his troops.\nArminius, who had been considered a real threat to stability by Rome, was now defeated. Once his allied Germanic coalition had been broken and honour avenged, the huge cost and risk of keeping the Roman army operating beyond the Rhine was not worth any likely benefit to be gained.\nThe last chapter of this story is told by the historian Tacitus. Around 50 AD, bands of Chatti invaded Roman territory and began to plunder (take everything of value). The Roman commander, with a legionary force supported by Roman cavalry and auxiliaries, attacked the Chatti from both sides and defeated them. The Romans were ecstatic when they found Roman prisoners, including some from Varus' legions who had been held by the Chatti for 40 years.\nLater German nationalism.\nThe battle, and the histories of Tacitus, had a big effect on 19th century German nationalism. In the 19th century the Germans were still divided into many German states, but they linked themselves with the Germanic tribes as shared ancestors of one \"German people\".\nIn 1808, the German author Heinrich von Kleist's play \"Die Hermannsschlacht\" aroused anti-Napoleonic sentiment, even though it could not be performed under French occupation.\nLater, the figure of Arminius was used to represent the ideals of freedom and unification \u2013 as supported by German liberals, and opposed by reactionary rulers. A memorial \u2013 the Hermannsdenkmal \u2013 was begun during this period, and Arminius became a symbol of \"Pan-Germanism\". The monument remained unfinished for decades, until after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870\u201371 unified the country. The completed monument was then a symbol of conservative German nationalism."}

First off the Soviet Union became the Russian Federation. People now consider that the Federation is a follow up of the Soviet Union. However, Post-Soviet Russia lacked the military and political power of the former USSR. Now that communism died, Russia could elect a President. In June 1991, Boris Yeltsin was elected as the first president of Russia.\nChange in Economy.\nBoris Yeltsin told his people that he would help the economy. One thing he did was help improve trade with other countries. However, not all his ideas would be good. When Yeltsin lifted price controls, a sudden increase in prices occurred (hyperinflation). Because the military was hit hard during the fall of the Soviet Union, many plants laid off workers because the Government was not sending the plants any new orders. This led to large unemployment.\nIn August 1998 the Russian government devalued the ruble and defaulted on their debt. This was called the 1998 Russian financial crisis. This was due in part to the Asian financial crisis and the war in Chechnya. Many banks were forced to close down. The government stopped making payment of wages, pensions and when workers were paid, it was often with goods rather than rubles.\nDespite this, Russia came back from the August 1998 financial crash with speed. This was because the price of oil went up. Having the prices of oil go up, the exportation of the oil form Russia would cost more, this would bring in lots of money for the economy.\nA series of privatizations occurred.\nRelationships with Countries.\nUnlike in the Cold war, Russia now said that the West was considered an ally. In June 1998 they joined the NATO peace-keeping forces. The Russians also have begun relationships with China. In 1997 the Russians made a treaty with Belarus\nToday.\nRussia in the 21st century has gone through many changes. In 2000 Vladimir Putin was made President of Russia. Through his term he had good and bad approval ratings. In 2001-2002 Putin took over several media stations. Issues like this have also occurred with print media. However Putin has done good things for Russia, Indeed, during real GDP grew on average 6.7% a year, average income increased 11% annually, and a positive balance of the federal budget now let the government to cut 70% of its debt during his term."}

The storm, which caused nine fatalities, formed from an area of cloud on August 30, 2007, and became a tropical storm the next day. The storm moved along the Mexican Pacific coast, and it rained very heavily. The city that had the most problems was Acapulco, Guerrero, where six people were killed by landslides, and where over 100\u00a0families had to leave after the La Sabana River flooded. Henriette then turned north and headed towards the Baja California peninsula, and became a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Henriette made its first landfall east of Cabo San Lucas when it was at its strongest, causing the death of one woman because of rough seas.\nHurricane Henriette then moved over the Sea of Cortez, and made its second landfall near Guaymas, Sonora. After causing heavy rains in Sonora, the storm weakened over the Sierra Madre Occidental and what was left went on to cause flooding in New Mexico and Texas. The damaged caused cost about $275\u00a0million (2007\u00a0MXN, $25\u00a0million 2007\u00a0USD). It hit Mexico on the same day Hurricane Felix hit Nicaragua, only one of two time when an Atlantic hurricane and a Pacific hurricane have made landfall on the same day.\nMeteorological history.\nHenriette originated from a tropical wave that departed the west coast of Africa on August 20, 2007. The wave produced some convection while in the Caribbean Sea but reached Central America on August 28 before any significant development could occur. Early on August 30, the area of low pressure, now 400\u00a0miles (640\u00a0km) south-southeast of Acapulco, Mexico, started to gain clusters of strong convection. By the afternoon of August 30 the system continued to show strong convection and had developed a broad but well defined area of low to mid level cyclonic turning. By 0600\u00a0UTC that day the system became a tropical depression about southeast of Acapulco and was designated as Tropical Depression Eleven-E.\nConvection continued but the cyclone was encountering extensive easterly to north-easterly wind shear which stinted the strengthening of this storm throughout its history. The cyclone initially headed toward the west-northwest around a subtropical ridge that was centered over the western Gulf of Mexico. The depression moved north west, parallel with the west coast of Mexico due to being steered by the mid/upper-level ridge. On August 31, it strengthened to become Tropical Storm Henriette, 85\u00a0miles (137\u00a0km) south of Acapulco. \nIt continued to move along the Mexican coast bringing heavy rains. With continued strong convection, Henriette maintained its strengthening and was predicted to reach hurricane strength. However, despite the low wind shear and apparent warm waters. Henriette did not strengthen as expected. This is believed to be due to its proximity to land and colds waters being brought up due to Henriette's slow movement. The convection and strengthening continued and maintained itself as it moved away from Jalisco. Henriette turned westward and away from the Pacific coast of Mexico late on September 1 as the subtropical ridge built westward over northern Mexico.\nHenriette continued to improve in structure and with the formation of a distinct eye feature, reached hurricane strength on September 4 as it turned north-northwestward toward the Baja California peninsula, ahead of a mid-latitude trough approaching the west coast of the United States. The hurricane reached its peak intensity of 85\u00a0mph (135\u00a0 km/h) that morning while centered about 75\u00a0miles (120\u00a0km)south-southeast of Cabo San Lucas.\nThe center of Henriette made landfall just east of Cabo San Lucas on the afternoon of September 4 with maximum winds near \u00a0(130\u00a0 km/h). It was over land for only about six hours before emerging into the Sea of Cortez. The brief interaction with land caused a slight weakening, but Henriette remained a Category\u00a01\u00a0hurricane for most of that day. The next day it made final landfall near Guaymas in the state of Sonora. Henriette weakened quickly over land and dissipated over the mountains of northwestern Mexico early on September 6. The remnants of Tropical Storm Henriette continued to track across west Texas and southeastern New Mexico as it was being absorbed by a cold front moving through New Mexico. The flow of moisture from originating from these remnants, moderate instability, and marginal shear contributed to flash flooding and severe thunderstorms.\nPreparations.\nThe formation of Henriette was not anticipated well in NHC Tropical Weather Outlooks. The incipient system was first mentioned only about 31\u00a0hours before it became a tropical depression, and the potential for the formation of a depression was explicitly stated beginning only about 13\u00a0hours prior to genesis.\nOn August 31, 2007 the National Meteorological Service in Mexico decreed zone of alert from Lagunas de Chacahua, Oaxaca to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco. It requested the public to take precautions before the possible coming of rain, intense winds and storm surges in the south and southwestern coasts of Mexico. The Ministry of Education of Guerrero canceled classes at all schools in the evening and close the port navigation. Faced with the prospect of Henriette strengthening, The Head of the Harbor Bay in Acapulco stopped all travel for small craft and coastal fisheries. Also blue and yellow flags were raised as a preventive measure for swimmers. On September 4, the port of Mazatl\u00e1n, Sinaloa had to be shut down to all navigation due to the inclement weather produced by the hurricane. The port authority reported that Henriette produced waves surpassing 4\u00a0meters (13\u00a0ft) in height. The Carnival Pride cruise scheduled to arrive at the port had to be diverted out to sea as a result of the port's closure. In the city itself, school was suspended for two days, and officials stated that approximately 600\u00a0famiilies might have to be evacuated. Further north, the port of Topolobampo, Sinaloa was also closed due to Henriette's threat, and 20\u00a0families were evacuated from their homes in an ejido.\nIn La Paz, the Municipal Direction of Civil defense informed that the first of 13\u00a0temporary shelters would be opened and anticipated the evacuation of more than 2000\u00a0people that lived in high-risk zones. In some areas, the local police recommended to the population, mostly those living in areas of high risk, that they should take care not to leave their homes unless necessary and to find evacuation routes and temporary shelters. Both Manuel M\u00e1rquez de Le\u00f3n International Airport in La Paz and Los Cabos International Airport in San Jos\u00e9 del Cabo were shut down, stranding 7,500\u20138,500 tourists. Henriette also forced the ports in Los Cabos to close completely, and the port in La Paz to close to small craft.\nImpact.\nHenriette struck hardest in the resort town of Acapulco. Though the storm never passed closer than to the town, heavy rains along the coast saturated the ground, leading to mudslides. Six people were reported dead as a result of rockslides in two suburban neighborhoods of the city and in the port itself. Three were killed by a huge rock hitting their house, and the other three were killed when their dwellings partially collapsed. In addition, flooding from the overflowing of the River La Sabana, led to the evacuation of at least one hundred families from around the river by the Consejo Estatal de Proteccion Civil.\nJorge Antonio Pacheco Albert, Director of Civil Protection for the Port of Acapulco, reported that approximately 800 were injured during the passage of Henriette along the coast and that 337\u00a0people relocated to temporary shelters. In Michoac\u00e1n, Henriette damaged 10,000 square meters (107,000\u00a0sq. ft) of beach near Ixtapilla, destroying approximately 5,000 Olive Ridley turtle nests, comprising 10% of the endangered species's nests in the state.\nIn Sonora, the hurricane destroyed 450\u00a0homes and damaged another 5,000\u00a0dwellings in Etchojoa and Huatabampo, which both have large Mayo Indian populations. The storm's precipitation flooded nearby agricultural fields, stopping wheat production, forcing local government to fumigate the region to try to prevent a dengue fever outbreak. In the Yaqui River valley, two people were killed, and another 70\u00a0homes were destroyed by Henriette's winds. Throughout the state, 24,000\u00a0families were left homeless. \nOne woman died due to high surf near Cabo San Lucas on the Baja California peninsula. Two fishermen were reported killed off the Sonora coast.\nThe road connecting Guaymas to Ciudad Obreg\u00f3n was closed due to damage from the overflow of the brook Cocoraque which stranded around 600\u00a0cars. L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas was affected when the Acalpican River broke its banks. At least 50\u00a0houses in the community of \"El\u00a0Habillal\", were flooded by water levels of up to . The residents had to leave their houses and be relocated in provisional housing. \nThe remnants of Henriette caused flash floods and surface water 8\u201312\u00a0inches (20\u201330\u00a0cm) deep which covered roads with depths up to 1.5\u00a0inches (4\u00a0cm) in the U.S. States of New Mexico and Texas. Hail also accumulated on roadways. Damage in Mexico totaled about $275\u00a0million (2007\u00a0MXN, $25\u00a0million 2007\u00a0USD). The name \"Henriette\" was not retired from use by the World Meteorological Organization, and will be used again in 2013."}

He led the Irish Parliamentary Party. He played an important part in the fight for Home Rule for Ireland.\nBackground.\nCharles Stewart Parnell was born in Avondale, County Wicklow. His family was upper class. He was the seventh child of John Henry Parnell and his American wife Delia Tudor Stewart. Parnell's great-grandmother was in the Tudor family so he was related to the British Royal Family.\nHis parents separated when he was six. He was sent to different schools in England, where he was unhappy. His father died in 1859 and he inherited his fortune. He then studied at Cambridge University (1865-9) but never graduated. He was Sheriff of his county, Wicklow, prior to being an MP (member of the House of Commons).\nMember of Parliament.\nCharles Stewart Parnell was first elected to the House of Commons, as a Home Rule League MP for Meath, on 21 April 1875. During his first year Parnell mostly stayed quiet and watched. He first drew attention in 1876 when he said a group of Irish rebels called Fenians (accused of killing a police officer) did not kill anyone.\nHome Rule.\nParnell fought for Ireland's right to be self-governing Home Rule Movement. At first he met with Fenians, but he later decided to work with Michael Davitt. He was elected president of Davitt's movement, (called the \"Land League\") on 21 October 1879. After becoming the MP for Cork City, he formed a new group with ideas from many other groups called the Irish National League which later became the Irish Parliamentary Party. Although Ireland did not become independent for many years, Parnell's work in Parliament pushed Ireland much closer to their goal by unifying Irish politics.\nPersonal life.\nKatherine O'Shea.\nOn 24 December 1889 Captain William O\u2019Shea decided to divorce his wife Katherine O'Shea. O'Shea had already separated from his wife, but would not divorce her as she was expecting a substantial inheritance.\nO'Shea at last filed for divorce. He claimed she had an affair and three children with Parnell. Parnell did not reply to the claim, and the divorce was granted. Because divorce is not allowed by Catholics, many Catholics who supported Parnell did not like him anymore and he became less popular.\nParnell married Katherine after her divorce. The damage from his affair caused many people to lose respect for him, and he became less powerful. Many members of his party left him. He died on 6 October 1891 of a heart attack and in the arms of his wife. He was 45 years old."}

{"id": "183830", "revid": "103847", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=183830", "title": "Modernism", "text": "Modernism was a cultural movement of the late 19th century to the mid-20th century. It changed art, literature, music, architecture and drama.\nModernism rejected tradition. It was interested in new ways of doing old things. Also, there was a belief that science and technology could change the world for the better. The details differ greatly, and the term covers some movements which are somewhat contradictory.\nArt.\nModern art replaced classical art. It included abstract art, cubism, pop art, minimalism, and Dadaism. It affected sculpture quite strongly, though at the beginning sculptors like Rodin and Epstein made both traditional and modernist works. Henry Moore is one of the most famous modernist sculptors.\nTypical modernist painters were Picasso, Braque, Matisse, Kandinsky and Mondrian.\nMusic.\nComposers such as Stravinsky, George Antheil and Schoenberg are modernists. Stravinsky's \"The Rite of Spring\" (\"Le Sacre du Printemps\") is a landmark work.\nDance.\nBallets such as \"The Rite of Spring\" and \"Les Noces\" (\"The Wedding\") mark the arrival of modernism into this traditional dance form. Modern dance outside of ballet started with Isadora Duncan, Loie Fuller and Ruth St. Denis.\nLiterature.\nJames Joyce's \"Ulysses\" is the classic example of modernism in the novel. \"Ulysses\" (1922) has been called \"a demonstration and summation of the entire Modernist movement\". Franz Kafka's \"The Metamorphosis\" (1915), \"The Trial\" (1925) and T.S. Eliot's poem \"The Waste Land\" (1922) are also prime examples. Looking back, it is clear that: Fyodor Dostoyevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" (1866) had a great influence on other writers.\nThe arrival of magic realism is part of modernism. The novels and short stories of Mikhail Bulgakov such as \"Diabolidad\" and \"The Master and Margarita\" are examples.\nArchitecture.\nModernism in architecture is found in the work of Frank Lloyd Wright, Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius the founder of Bauhaus, and Mies van der Rohe. Le Corbusier's famous remark \"A building is a machine for living in\" shows how different his thinking was to architects of the 19th century. The skyscraper, such as Mies van der Rohe's Seagram Building in New York (1956\u20131958), became the archetypal modernist building.\nCriticism.\nA criticism of the modern movement is that it does not value tradition, and goes in for change for the sake of change. What modernists want most is freedom of expression, or, perhaps, freedom of experimentation. This is why many modern paintings avoid making visual copies of real things. In modernist literature, an author may leave out plots or narrative or characterization in books.\nThese experiments were not random. They drew on the ideas of their day: mass media, science and technology, Marxism, Freudian psychology, and so on. There was a general search for new materials, new methods and new ideas. There was often a rejection of elitism, and a love of populism and popular culture.\nAnother criticism was of the connection between modernism and socialism. Certainly many modernists were also socialists. In the early days of socialism it seemed to offer hope of a new future without the baggage of the past. This also explains their rejection of tradition."}

This time was very prosperous for the British people. Trade was at its best. A well educated middle class ruled the country and the British Empire. Other countries also prospered but Britain became the greatest great power.\nThe Industrial Revolution continued to increase productivity and prosperity, especially in the middle and later parts of Victoria's reign. Making iron and steel was a basic industry. The furnaces were fired with coal. Shipbuilding was a major industry. Canals and steam railways connected all parts of the country, and British steamships connected the world. Cotton and wool were made into cloth and exported. Ceramics were also a major industry.\nOne important change in the Victorian era was the making of the sewage system in London. In 1829 photography was invented. Gas lighting was important too. Streetlights became common first, followed by lights in public buildings and at home. In the 1880s people began making power stations and distribution systems to feed the new electric lightbulbs.\nEconomic changes.\nBritain began ruling its trading colonies in Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean. The British Empire now extended all over the world. It used new technologies like the railways and electric telegraph to communicate across these regions. Many British citizens moved to the colonies to make their fortune.\nIndustrialisation brought with it a rapidly growing middle class. They were not aristocrats and landowners, but on the other hand they were not unskilled workers. They were the people who created, managed and ran the new industrial factories.\nSocial changes.\nIn the Victorian era, the middle class people owned their own houses. The family home often included three generations. The concept of \"privacy\" became a mark of the middle class life. What went on in those homes was the themes of many mid-century novelists.\nThe printing press became faster in the nineteenth century and paper was cheaper too. The \"taxes on knowledge\" on newspapers and printed advertisements were lifted. This made magazines and newspapers cheaper. The government tried to improve literacy rates by starting schools for the poor. More books were written for, and read by, the newly educated middle classes.\nEntertainment.\nMore theatres opened in London. Orchestras and symphonies played, and operas were widely attended. Gambling at cards and new casinos became popular during the period. In the middle of the 19th century saw The Great Exhibition of 1851, the first World's Fair, and showed the greatest creations of the century."}

It was later called the electron and was the first subatomic particle to be found. Thomson also found the first evidence for isotopes of a stable (non-radioactive) element in 1913, while studying anode rays (positive cations). \nIn atomic theory he hypothesized that atoms were spheres of evenly spread positive charge, where an individual negatively charged electron resided.

He became the Member of Parliament for Rushcliffe at the 1970 general election and became a Queen's Counsel in 1980. He held a number of lower positions in government under Margaret Thatcher until she promoted him to Health Secretary in 1988.

In 2005 he stood for the leadership for a third time but was defeated by David Cameron.

The most common German word for lollipop is \"Lutscher\", but Germans now also use \"Lollipop\". The band debuted in July 2000 with an album called \"die Lollipops\" and have released new CDs, videos, and audio books at the rate of about two per year. As of 2005, their label had sold more than 1.5 million of their CDs and videos, of which 8 made it to gold, and one made it to platinum. Note that the meanings of the terms platinum and gold are different for different countries: in Germany gold signifies 100,000 sales and platinum 200,000. \nDie Lollipops has featured two singers at a time for most of its history; generally these have been girls between the ages of about 11 and 16. Because the band has been around for nine years, they must replace their singers with new ones every few years. The current duet started recording in late 2007 with Susi and Fiona (then 12 and 11 years old respectively). They released an album called \"Einfach tierisch\" in March 2008, and plan to release another one called \"Immer in Bewegung\" in July 2009. Peter Hoffmann has remained the producer since the group was formed. The band has attracted composers from other bands registered by Edel Music; a singer named Klaus B\u00fcchner had written a song about drinking alcohol called \"Wir feiern wieder Feste\" in 1987 when he was singing in his own band, called Klaus &amp; Klaus; he then re-wrote it as a children's song about a never-ending party for die Lollipops. The title of the song is still the same and the syllable rhythms are similar, especially in the chorus. \nDue to the language barrier, the Lollipops are largely unheard of outside the German-speaking world. Their music can be downloaded via websites such as Amazon.com."}

It is recessive, which means both parents must give the baby the defective gene for the baby to have Tay-Sachs. One in every twenty seven Jewish American has one defective gene and can give Tay-Sachs the defective gene to their child. The disease is very rare. It is most common in Jewish families. There is a blood test to see if a person has the Tay Sachs gene. This blood test has helped reduce the number of babies born with Tay-Sachs. In 1800\u2019s, there were 60 new cases and in the 21st century there were 5.\nInfants with the Tay-Sachs gene from both parents usually die of pneumonia or other infections during their first four years of life. Some symptoms include: lack of energy, loss of vision and motor skills (paralyzation), and seizures. Tay\u2013Sachs disease is usually first noticed in infants around six months old. They show an abnormally strong response to sudden noises or other stimulus. This is called the \"startle response\". The child may also be listlessness or have muscle stiffness (hypertonia). The disease is classified into several forms, which are based on the age when the neurological symptoms began. There is no known treatment for this disease.\nThe disease is named after Warren Tay and Bernard Sachs who first described the disease in the late 19th century. After the discovery, he noticed a red spot on the retina of a one year old child. The child was experiencing the same symptoms of the disease. Bernard Sachs was a neurologist from the United States.

Crowded House are referred to as \"The Crowdies\" by Australian fans.\nOriginally active from 1985 to 1996, the band has had consistent commercial and critical success in Australia and New Zealand and international chart success in two phases, beginning with their self-titled debut album, \"Crowded House\", which reached number twelve on the US Album Chart in 1987 and provided the Top Ten hits, \"Don't Dream It's Over\" and \"Something So Strong\". Further international success came in the UK and Europe with their third and fourth albums, \"Woodface\" and \"Together Alone\" and the compilation album \"Recurring Dream\", which included the hits \"Fall at Your Feet\", \"Weather with You\", \"Distant Sun\", \"Locked Out\", \"Instinct\" and \"Not the Girl You Think You Are\".\nFounding drummer Hester left in May 1994, citing family reasons, but returned for their \"Farewell to the World\" concerts in Melbourne and Sydney in 1996. Neil Finn had decided to end the band to concentrate on his solo career and the Finn Brothers project with Tim. On 26 March 2005 Hester committed suicide, aged 46.\nIn 2006, the group re-formed with new drummer Matt Sherrod. They have since released two albums, which have both reached number one on Australia's Album Chart. The new albums are called \"Time on Earth\" (2007) and \"Intriguer\" (2010)."}

The game is like a battle, and the cards have different uses to help the player win the battle. There is one deck of cards for each player. Each deck contains 40 to 60 cards. Each player also has an optional \"extra deck\" of up to 15 cards that are used in certain situations. There is also a 15-card \"side deck\", which allows players to modify their deck between games. Players are only allowed three of the same card per deck and side deck. Each player starts with a certain number of \"Life Points\". To win the game, a player has to reduce their opponent's Life Points to zero. This is usually achieved by using \"monster\" cards to attack the monster cards of the opponent or damage the opponent's life points. The other two card types are \"spells\" and \"traps\". There are many, many types of spells and traps. For example, these cards' effects may eliminate an opponent's card, counter the effects of an opponent's card, or retrieve a specific card from one's own deck, to name just a few.

A short time after diaphragm contracts, the throat suddenly closes. This closing stops the air from flowing in, and results in the \"hic\" sound that gives \"hiccups\" its name. A hiccup is a reflex, a kind of action happens in the body without trying. Hiccups often repeat several times per minute, and end on their own after a few minutes.\nSometimes a single hiccup happens, or they may happen over and over, a few times each minute, in a series called a \"bout\" of hiccups. Hiccups are rhythmic: the time between one hiccup and the next usually doesn't change much. A bout of hiccups generally ends by itself, without having to doing anything to end it on purpose. Many home remedies (cures) are often tried to attempt to shorten how long the hiccups last, because hiccups can be uncomfortable and make it hard to pay attention to other things. It is rare that medical help is necessary because it is rare that they last long enough to cause any harm. \nHiccups may be triggered (started) by several common human conditions such as swallowing air, eating very quickly, and laughing for a long time. They can also be caused by some drugs and by some diseases.\nThe reason that people hiccup is not known for sure. A leading theory (idea) is that hiccups evolved to help human babies and other young mammals obtain milk more easily during breast feeding. This is related to the pattern that hiccups often happen when a bubble of air forms below the diaphragm and takes up space in the belly."}

The problem with this is that different manufacturers measure different things with it, some measure write speeds, others read speeds. There are also differences because some give guarantees, and others simply say that the speeds they indicate are the maximum achievable under good conditions.\nStill another measurement is called \"rating\". A rating of 1 corresponds to 150 KBytes per second, the read speed of a CD. That way, a class 2 is equal to a speed of 13x.\nmicroSD cards do the same thing but are much smaller. "}

It is often shortened to ISDN. It is used for telephone lines. Before ISDN, telephone lines were mainly seen as a way for people to make phone calls, so the main idea was to use circuit switching. When a phone call is made, a line is set up between the two participants. This phone call is analogue. With ISDN, this view changes. As the signal is now digital ISDN can be used to offer a number of services, which use the telephone line to transport data. There were different services, like telex or teleprinters before ISDN, but they used their own networks. At specific locations, there were gateways between these networks. With ISDN, this changes. There is only one network, and it offers different services. Some of them are for voice, to make phone calls, others are for data, for example to send telefaxes.\nChannels.\nISDN offers a number of data channels, and a signalling channel. The data channels carry the actual service data. The two data channels are completely independent and can be used independently. The usual setup has two such data channels. That way, it is possible to send a fax through one channel, while doing a phone call over the other channel, for example. If the main focus is on a high quality voice connection, the two channels can be combined into one single channel carrying twice the amount of a single channel enhancing the quality dramatically.\nFor larger companies it is possible to extend the number of data channels to 30 with still one signalling channel."}

He was one of the first painters of the 19th century to paint subjects of everyday life in the modern world. This made him very important for modern painting, especially for the change from Realism to Impressionism. \nSome of his paintings were very controversial. The paintings \"Lunch on the Grass\" and \"Olympia\" were a starting-point for a group of young painters to develop what would later be called \"Impressionism\".\nLife.\nTraining.\n\u00c9douard Manet was born in Paris on 23 January 1832, to a wealthy family. As he grew up, his uncle encouraged him to paint and draw, but his father wanted him to join the navy. Eventually he was allowed to be trained as a painter. Manet worked from 1850 to 1856 in the studio of the academic painter Thomas Couture a painter of large historical paintings. In his spare time he copied the old masters in the Louvre. \nWhile he was a student he visited Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands, looking at the paintings of Renaissance and Baroque masters such as Frans Hals, and Spanish painters such as Diego Vel\u00e1zquez and Goya. \nIn 1856, Manet opened his own studio. One of the best known French painters of that time was Gustave Courbet who painted in a style known as Realism. Courbet, in his pictures, tried to show the life of the poor working people of the farms and villages. Manet began to paint beggars, singers and people in cafes. His style was not like Courbet's because he used large brushstrokes without much detail. Courbet's paintings were dark and somber because he painted all his canvases brown before he put the figures in. Manet's paintings were brighter and lighter, with lots of white paint and often small parts painted in bright blue and red\nIn 1863 Manet married Suzanne Leenhoff, who had been employed by his father to teach piano to Manet and his younger brother Eugene. Suzanne had an eleven year old son, Leon Koella Leenhoff who often posed as a model for Manet's paintings.\nImpressionism.\nEvery year the academy in Paris would hold a big exhibition (art show) called the \"Salon de Paris\". In 1863 Manet put a picture into the show called \"Lunch on the Grass\" (\"Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe\"). The judges at the Salon refused to hang this work in the gallery because it showed a naked woman sitting on the grass with two men wearing clothes. If the painting had been about Ancient Greek mythology, this would not be a problem but these men were wearing ordinary suits, and the woman's dress and hat were lying on the grass. Perhaps she was a prostitute. The judges said that the painting was indecent (very rude). \nAt this time there were a group of young artists who mainly painted landscapes. They were Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Alfred Sisley, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille, Camille Pissarro, Paul C\u00e9zanne, and Armand Guillaumin. Monet and his friends also had their paintings turned away. They were angry and they met with Manet to discuss this. The Emperor Napoleon III gave permission for another exhibition called the \"Salon des Refuses\" which showed all the pictures that had been \"refused\". Many people went to see this exhibition and soon discovered that there was a new \"movement\" in art, quite different from the style that they were used to. \nIn 1874 thirty Impressionist artists held their first exhibition. The main artists who are called \"Impressionists\" include Claude Monet, Auguste Renoir, Paul C\u00e9zanne, Camille Pissarro, Alfred Sisley, Edgar Degas and Berthe Morisot. Manet became friendly with Berthe Morisot, who later married his brother Eugene Manet. Manet encouraged Morisot with her painting. Morisot, in turn, encouraged Manet to paint outdoors, in the way that Monet and the other Impressionist painters did. Monet painted some landscapes, seascapes and city scenes in the Impressionist style. However, most of his paintings are \"figurative\" (they are pictures of people). \nManet's paintings usually show people going about their ordinary lives. They show people at home and at work, or out and enjoying themselves. One painting is very different. It is a terrible scene showing the execution of the Emperor Maximillian of Mexico by a firing squad. \nManet died of syphilis in Paris at the age of 51. He is buried in the Passy Cemetery in the city."}

It is also known as qat, qaat, quat, gat, jaad, chat, chad, chaad and miraa. The plant is grown commercially in Kenya, Oman, Yemen and Ethiopia.\nKhat is a shrub. When grown commercially, the shrubs grow to a size of about 5m, in the wild they can reach about 20m. \nKhat is used as a stimulant in Yemen, Ethiopia and Somalia, the effects are comparable to those of drinking tea or coffee. \nProblems.\nThere are some problems with Khat. People can become psychologically addicted to the drug. Many anti-drug organisations, such as the Drug Enforcement Administration target this drug. \nIt is illegal to use in many countries.\nMany farmers in Yemen now produce Khat, instead of other crops, because they get more money for it.\nKhat is very popular in Yemen. Much of the country's farming resources go towards it. It is estimated that 40% of the country's water supply goes towards irrigating it. Its production is said to increase by about 10% to 15% every year. Water use in producing khat is so high that groundwater levels in the Sana'a basin are getting lower. For this reason, government officials have proposed to move large portions of the population of Sana'a to the coast of the Red Sea. \nKhat is a major cash crop in Yemen and the price brings in a high income for farmers. Some studies done in 2001 estimated that the income from growing khat was about 2.5 million Yemeni rials per hectare, while it was only 0.57 million rials per hectare if fruits were grown. This is a strong reason farmers prefer to grow khat over coffee and fruits. It is estimated that between 1970 and 2000, the area on which khat was cultivated grew from 8,000 hectares to 103,000 hectares."}

This Neo-stone age began 3,000 BC lasting almost 1500 years. Similar tools were found in Sitakunda of the eastern region Chittagong, and near Comilla district. The sparsely forested hills in eastern Bengal strewn with fertile valleys imparted a hospitable location for Neolithic settlements.\nPhysically, the indigenous peoples of eastern India were long-headed, dark skinned, broad-nosed, and short in stature.

{"id": "184531", "revid": "68157", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=184531", "title": "Bumblebee", "text": "Bumblebees or \"bumble bees\", or \"humble bees\") are a group of social and semi-social bees, of the genus Bombus. The genus contains about 250 different species, mostly in the Northern Hemisphere. They can also be found in New Zealand and Tasmania. They occur practically everywhere on the Eurasian landmass.\nMost bumblebees live in small groups, which generally last only for a year (though the queen lasts longer). They collect pollen as protein for their young, and themselves eat nectar. They are extremely hairy, with a covering of soft hairs called a \"pile\". It is the female worker bee which one sees out collecting pollen. The pollen is packed into two \"baskets\" on its hind, very noticeable when full. The baskets are just hairs specially adapted for this function.\nMost of them have the same social structure as honey bees do, there is a \"queen\", and there are \"workers\" and \"drones\". The usual size of a colony is under 50 members, though some tropical species live in larger colonies.\nBumblebees carry aposematic warning colours, usually some combination of black, red, yellow and white. This is the usual M\u00fcllerian mimicry found in bees and wasps. Bumblebees are extremely hairy, and that also is a defence against birds. Young birds, particularly, find them difficult to handle. Some birds are regular predators of bumblebees: the great grey shrike (\"Lanius excubitor\") and the bee-eaters for example.\nLife cycle.\nFertilised queens overwinter in a dormant state. They start a nest in the Spring. The nests are smaller, usually much smaller, than those of hive bees. The queen stores sperm from her mating, and can decide whether or not to fertilise an egg as it comes down the oviduct to the vagina. The females are diploid, the males are haploid. This is the common method of sex determination throughout the Hymenoptera.\nOnly fertilised eggs grow into females, unfertilised ones grow into males. To develop, the larvae are fed both nectar for carbohydrates and pollen for protein.\nQueens suppress their female workers egg-laying by aggression and pheromones, until late in the season, when the workers do start to lay eggs. The eggs develop into males (drones) if they are not fertilised (haploid), and females if they are diploid.\nThus the queen will be the mother of all the first males. New queens (those fertilised eggs which are fed on nutritious food) and males leave the colony when they are mature. They mate and the new queens search for a place to overwinter. Then they are dormant over the winter period, starting a new nest in the Spring. That completes the cycle. The queens live a number of years. The workers (unfertilized females) live about a season. Drones live away from the hive(s). Queens do not mate with drones from their own hive.\nBumblebees can fly very high. In 2014, \"National Geographic\" said bumblebees can fly higher than Mount Everest.\nNest size.\nNest size \"according to the species\" is between 50 and 400 individuals. Colonies have been fiund as small as ~20 individuals and as large as 1700. These nests are small compared to honeybee hives, which hold about 50,000 bees. \nNest types.\nMany species nest underground in old rodent burrows or sheltered places. They avoid direct sunlight, where nests might overheat. Other species make nests above ground, whether in thick grass or in holes in trees. Stone-boring bees are found in limestone walls and cliffs, and sand borers are found in compact sand cliffs.\nA bumblebee nest is not organised into hexagonal combs like that of a honeybee; the cells are instead clustered together untidily. The workers remove dead bees or larvae from the nest and deposit them outside the nest entrance, helping to prevent disease. Nests in temperate regions last only for a single season and do not survive the winter.\nParasitic bees.\nAbout ten species are called cuckoo bumblebees. These are nest parasites: they specialize in invading and taking over the nests of other bumblebees. In these species, there are no workers. Once such an animal has invaded a nest, it will force the workers to feed it and its offspring. Once the offspring are ready, they will leave the hive, to mate and take over other hives.\nSting.\nAll bumblebees have a sting, as hive bees do. However, the bumblebee sting does not damage it when used, and they can sting several times. However, they rarely do sting, unless really threatened.\nThey have an additional type of defence against birds, and that is their mechanical toughness. Birds usually do not swallow bees whole. If they eat bees at all, they manipulate them to eat the thorax alone, for its wing muscles. This is hard to do with a bumblebee, and time-consuming. Generally, they are left alone.\nBumblebees in England.\nThe BBC has made a number of field reports for its regular Naturewatch and Spring watch programs. The short film clips have information on:"}

Some of the most well established Bengali communities are in the Middle East, Japan, Malaysia, United Kingdom and United States.\nRemnants of civilisation in the greater Bengal region date back 4,000 years, when the region was settled by Dravidian, Tibeto-Burman and Austroasiatic peoples. The origin of the word \"Bangla ~ Bengal\" is unknown, but it is believed to be derived from the Dravidian-speaking tribe \"Bang\" that settled in the area around the year 1000 BC.\nAfter the arrival of Indo-Aryans, the kingdoms around Bengal were first described in the \"Atharvaveda\" about 1000 BC. From the 6th century BC, Magadha expanded to include most of the Bihar and Bengal regions. It was one of the four main kingdoms of India at the time of Buddha. Magadha extended over nearly all of South Asia, including parts of Persia and Afghanistan, reaching its greatest extent under the Buddhist emperor Ashoka the Great in the 3rd century BC. One of the earliest foreign references to Bengal is the mention of a land ruled by the king Xandrammes named Gangaridai by the Greeks around 100 BC.

The second bridge, which took eight years to build, was the first in London to carry trams and later one of the first two roads in London to have a bus lane.\nThe present bridge is most significant for road traffic across the Thames.\nIn June 2012, the bridge was highlighted on the route of Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee Pageant on the Thames."}

It is one of the three 'senior' non-leagues (that is a league that is not the Scottish Football League (SFL), Scottish Premier League or one of the Scottish Junior Football Association's leagues) in Scotland. The HFL is a full member of the Scottish Football Association.\nHistory.\nFormation.\nThe HFL was formed on 4 August 1893, at the Inverness Workman's Club. The original league consisted of seven teams: Inverness Thistle, Caledonian, Clachnacuddin, Forres Mechanics, Inverness Union, Inverness Citadel and Cameron Highlanders. Ross County were an eighth original member, but resigned membership in November 1893. Of the original teams, two are still playing in the league today (Clachnacuddin and Forres Mechanics), and two merged to become current Scottish Premier League club Inverness Caledonian Thistle.\nRecent History.\nMany of the member clubs have performed well when competing against SFL clubs in the Scottish Cup. However, from the 1990s onwards, the HFL has been a victim of its own success, with various teams defecting to other leagues. Furthermore it has also had to contend with overexposure of large teams in the area, such as Aberdeen and Inverness Caledonian Thistle, as well as the Old Firm to the South, and to an extent English football. However, the lack of Premier League, and to a lesser extent First Division, teams in the area, has worked in its favour, with some football fans being less willing to travel long distances to games in southern Scotland.\nThe league has been somewhat weakened in recent years by the departure of many former members who have subsequently joined the SFL. This happened in 1994 when Caledonian, Inverness Thistle and Ross County left. Until then the HFL had operated with 18 clubs; this was reduced by the departure of the three mentioned clubs, but Wick Academy from the North Caledonian Football League were elected, to create a league of 16 clubs. This was the state of affairs till 2000 when Elgin City and Peterhead were elected into the SFL. In 2002 Inverurie Loco Works were elected into the HFL to give it a membership of 15 clubs, with which it continues to operate.\nIn 2008, North Region Junior League sides Formartine United and Turriff United both submitted bids to join the Highland League, following in the footsteps of past Junior League side Inverurie Locos. If both teams were to join, the Highland League would have a total of 17 teams. An even team league is preferred, so only one club's application was likely to be successful. Whichever team is successful in their application was planned to join in the 2009\u201310 season. However Banks O' Dee and Strathspey Thistle also applied, giving the potential for an 18 team Highland league in 2009-10 if three of these four clubs were elected.\nOn February 25 2009, Formartine United, Turriff United and Strathspey Thistle were accepted into the league for the following season, with Banks O' Dee being the unsuccessful club.\nResults from the HFL and the Highland League Cup have featured on the Press Association vidiprinter since the start of the 1997\u201398 season.\nThe Highland League is the subject of a song of the same name by the popular music ensemble I, Ludicrous.\nLinked Competitions.\nThe HFL also administer several other competitions contested by some or all of the clubs.

The DNA consists of two helices that are combined. When the two helices are copied, each will have one part coming from the original cell. The other part will be newly made. In chemistry, that is called \"synthesis\". \nThere are three different way this replication could happen:\nMeselson and Stahl found that DNA employs semi-conservative replication. They put the bacteria in an environment with a Nitrogen isotope. They first used N15. The bacteria then integrated this isotope into their DNA. Later they used an environment that contained N14. They then looked at which of the isotopes the bacterial DNA contained. They found that it contained both isotopes of nitrogen, which implies that conservative replication is not the correct conclusion. By having a closer look they could then also rule out disperse replication. Some helix strands were all v. Other helix strands from the time in the N15 environment had N14."}

William's job was to cut people's hair and make rope. By the age of twelve, Joan had learned to make ropes and clothes.\nIn 1553, Queen Mary came to the throne and it was made illegal to hold Protestant views. Mary condemned 277 people for not having the right sort of religion. This crime was called heresy.\nJoan Waste was taken to court for breaking the law. The judge was a man employed by the bishop. She had to defend her views and was told she would die. She had not liked the fact that the church services were being read in the language of Latin. She was to die for being a Protestant and for refusing to agree with the Catholic Church. She bought a Bible in English, but the Catholic Church wanted them to only be in Latin. She asked friends to read to her for a penny.\n Her trial took place at All Saints Church. This main building has been rebuilt, but the tower was built in 1530. This tower is now part of Derby's cathedral.\nOn the day of her death she walked arm-in-arm with her twin brother to be burned.\nHer death took place at the Windmill Pit on the Burton Road in Derby. She was hanged over the fire with a rope. She fell into the fire when the rope burned through. The judge was Antony Draycot. He went home to his meal.\nThe place where Joan Waste was killed is now the site of a church. When Elizabeth I of England became queen in 1559 she removed Ralph Baines from the job of Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield. Baines was sent to be a prisoner of the Bishop of London. The judge was also sent to be a prisoner. He died after being released in 1571."}

Bilal's owner was Umayyah ibn Khalaf, an enemy of Islam. When Bilal learned about Muhammad and became Muslim, his master started punishing him. When Muhammad heard about this, he ordered Abu Bakr to buy Bilal's freedom and Bilal -who was now free- joined Muhammad's companions.\nMuhammad choose Bilal as the first muezzin. A muezzin is someone who leads the call to daily prayer. Sometimes Bilal walked the streets to call Muslims to come to prayer but most of the times, he said the Adhan from the top of the mosque.\nSome years later, when the Muslim army walked towards Mecca, everyone ran to their homes and closed all doors and windows. They were afraid that the Muslims were going to kill them, because of the bad things they did to the Muslims many years ago. But, the Muslims went towards the Kaaba, the worship house believed to be built by Abraham and his elder son, Ishmael. Bilal, shouted out loud to the people of Mecca that they were all safe: \"All those who lay down arms are safe. All those in the house of Abu Sufyan are safe. All those behind closed doors are safe.\"\nAfter Muhammad died, Bilal never said the Adhan again - except on two occasions. Once in Syria and the second time, in Medina, when Muhammad's grandson, Hasan ibn Ali asked him to do so.\nBilal died in Damascus between 638 and 642 (AD).\nLegacy.\nHadith books are the collections of Muhammad's sayings.\nMuhammad used to say about Bilal:\nWhen Bilal was chosen as the Muezzin, some people complained to Muhammad.

He was one of the most famous conductors of his time. He came from a very rich family and was able to use his money to pay orchestras that he formed. He formed the London Philharmonic Orchestra and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. He was especially well known for conducting the music of Mozart as well as that of his friend Delius.\nHe often made funny jokes and many amusing stories are told about things that he said.\nEarly life.\nBeecham was born in 1879 in St. Helens, Lancashire in the north of England. Beecham was self-taught as a conductor. He had some private composition lessons from Charles Wood in London and Moszkowski in Paris. Beecham\u2019s father, Sir Joseph Beecham, had made a lot of money making medicines (the famous Beecham pills) and he also liked music, so he was able to help his son in his career as a musician.\nThomas was only 20 years old when his father was reinstated as mayor of St. Helens. To celebrate this, his father paid for the Hall\u00e9 Orchestra to give a concert. It was going to be conducted by the famous German conductor Hans Richter. However, a few days before the concert it was announced that Richter was ill. Thomas immediately said he would conduct the concert. The orchestra at first refused to play for a 20 year old who had only once ever conducted a concert, but in the end they changed their minds and the concert was a great success.\nEarly career.\nIn 1909 Thomas got a group of musicians together to form the Beecham Symphony Orchestra. They gave concerts and played for ballets and operas. Beecham conducted operas in Covent Garden and other London opera houses. He conducted works by composers such as Strauss, Delius, Smythe and Holbrooke. He also played for Diaghilev\u2019s Ballets Russes when they first came to England.\nDuring World War I he gave money to the Halle Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra and the Royal Philharmonic Society, all of which he conducted. He often conducted these orchestras outside London, giving people the chance to hear music they had never heard before.\nFor several years he had money problems and did not conduct much. Then, in 1932, he formed the London Philharmonic Orchestra and quickly made it into an excellent orchestra. They toured Germany in 1936 and the next year went to Paris. During the 1930s he conducted at Covent Garden where he had control of everything that went on. He conducted several cycles of Wagner\u2019s Ring. When World War II started in 1939 the theatre was closed. He went to the United States where he conducted several orchestras including the New York Philharmonic. He also went to Australia.\nLater career.\nIn 1944 he returned to Britain. His orchestra, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, were now a self-governing body (the members themselves made decisions about what the orchestra should do and play). They decided that they did not want Beecham because he would want to have power to rule the orchestra in the way he wanted. So Beecham formed another orchestra: the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. He gave many concerts, toured with them and made many great recordings. He was especially known for his concerts of Joseph Haydn and Mozart. He also conducted Die Meistersinger at Covent Garden in 1951 as well as appearing at the Teatro Col\u00f3n in Buenos Aires in 1958. The last concert he gave was on 7 May 1960 when he conducted the RPO in Portsmouth.\nHis fame.\nBeecham was an enormously talented musician. Because he had a lot of money he did not need to go through the musical education that most other musicians have. He formed his own life, and spent a lot of his energy as well as money creating the right conditions for musicians to work in, conditions that would have been normal in many other European countries, but which were not normal at the time in England.\nHe was not interested in the music of Bach, though he did conduct Handel. He was famous for his Mozart performances, and particularly enjoyed playing Berlioz, Mendelssohn, Bizet and Dvo\u0159\u00e1k. He was one of the first people in England to conduct the new music of Richard Strauss and Sibelius. He was a close friend of Delius and performed his music as well as editing it so that it could be published.\nThere are many stories about the witty things that he said. He was knighted in 1916.\nFamous quotations.\nA lady told Beecham that she wanted her son to learn to play a musical instrument but did not want to hear the awful sound it made when he was beginning to learn. She asked him what instrument he should learn. Beecham said he should learn the bagpipes because \u201cthey sound exactly the same when you have finished learning them as when you start learning them\u201d.\nBeecham was rehearsing a very long opera by Wagner. They had been rehearsing for a long time. Beecham took out his watch and said: \u201cMy God! We have been playing for two hours and we are still playing this bloody tune!\u201d\nBeecham was rehearsing an opera by an English composer. The composer was at the rehearsal, and kept stopping the orchestra and asking Beecham to play it differently. Each time Beecham turned back to the orchestra and said: \u201cThe same again, gentlemen, please\u201d.\nBeecham once met a lady he knew, but could not remember who she was. He asked her whether she was well."}

He was crowned emperor in 1908 at the age of three. He married five times but never had any children. His father was Zaifeng Prince Chun II. He never knew his mother and was raised by eunuchs. \nAt the age of six, he was overthrown by Sun Yat-sen in the 1911 Revolution. Although he was forced to give up all political power, he was allowed to keep his title, his servants, and everything he owned in the Forbidden City, but in turn he had to pay the Republic of China 4 million taels a year and he was never allowed to leave the Forbidden City. \nIn the year 1919, Pu-yi appointed a British tutor named Reginald Johnston. It was through him that the young emperor developed a fascination with the Western world, so he began to adopt aspects of the West for himself. He learned how to ride a bicycle, he cut off his own Manchu queue, he even began to wear glasses. \nAfter Pu-yi was married to his first wife, he discovered that many of the palace's treasures were getting stolen. Believing that it was his eunuchs who were stealing his treasures, he demanded that they make an inventory to keep the treasury from getting robbed anymore. On the June 27, 1923, a fire destroyed the area around the Palace of Established Happiness. He accused the eunuchs of burning up the treasury to destroy any proof of their theft, and he also overheard some eunuchs' conversation that made him fear for his life. In response, he banished all the eunuchs from the palace. \nIn 1925, warlord Feng Yuxiang forced the emperor to leave the Forbidden City. Pu-yi then asked his tutor Johnston to go to the British Embassy and ask them to let the emperor to move to England. Unfortunately, the embassy refused his request. He then called the Japanese Embassy and they agreed to escort him out of Beijing and move him over to Tianjin. After the Japanese took over Manchuria n 1932, they made Pu-yi the Emperor of their new puppet state, Manchukuo. Despite being emperor, though, he practically had no power, but he was constantly manipulated, threatened, and blackmailed by the Japanese government. Once again, the emperor found himself to be a prisoner in his own palace. Chinese media and writers accused the Japanese and collaborators like Puyi of being homosexuals as an insult.\nAfter the Soviet Red Army invaded Manchuria in 1945, they captured Pu-yi when they invaded Changchun. After the CCP took over China in 1949, the Soviets agreed to hand Pu-yi over to China, and for the next ten years, the former emperor was thrown in a prison camp in Liaoning. After the prison guards declared that he was reformed, he was freed from prison and was moved back to Beijing, where he would spend the rest of his life as a common citizen. He would work as a gardener and then an editor, in which he would earn 100 yuan a month. When he returned to the Forbidden City (which was made into the Imperial Palace Museum), he had to buy a ticket to enter. He thought that it was ironic that he had to buy a ticket just to visit his own home."}

Endocrinology is also a medical specialty. This means that when a doctor finishes studying medicine in general, they can choose endocrinology as the part of medicine they work in.\nThe endocrine system consists of several glands in different parts of the body. They secrete hormones directly into the blood. Hormones have many different functions and modes of action.\nHormones are active in metabolism, growth and development, tissue function, sleep, digestion, respiration, excretion, mood, stress, lactation, movement, reproduction, and perception. Another field is behavioral endocrinology.\nMedical aspects.\nMedical understanding of hormones began in the 19th century with Graves' disease, caused by a swelling of the thyroid gland. Since the mid-19th century many medical conditions have been found caused by hormone imbalance, that is, too much or too little of a hormone.\nAn endocrinologist can help people who have diseases related to their endocrine system. Diseases that an endocrinologist would treat include:\nThese are just examples; there are many other endocrine diseases.\nAn endocrinologist can find out if a person has one of these diseases by doing tests. They can test a person's blood to find out if they have too much or too little of a hormone. An example of this is Type 1 diabetes. People who have Type 1 diabetes do not have enough of a hormone called insulin. Endocrinologists usually do not treat patients directly, but give advice to physicians about what how patients might be helped.\nEndocrine disorders fall into three groups: \nMost medical applications concern the lack of balance between hormones, and sometimes the complete lack of a necessary hormone. For example, most forms of hyperthyroidism are associated with an excess of thyroid hormone and a low level of thyroid stimulating hormone.\nHelping transgender people.\nEndocrinologists can advise on hormone treatment for transgender persons. A transgender person might want their body to look different so that they look more like their chosen gender. For example, a transgender woman might want less facial hair so that she looks less like a man to other people.\nRelated pages.\nThe main pages which explain endocrinology are:"}

He was an extremely famous and popular conductor who had a lot of influence on music in England during his life. He conducted many choirs, both amateur and professional, as well as orchestras. He was the main conductor of the Henry Wood Promenade Concerts from 1948 to 1967. He made the Last Night of the Proms into a very popular and joyful concert which today is enjoyed by millions of people worldwide on television. He conducted the music of many British composers, helping them to become known to a wide public.\nLife.\nEarly years.\nSargent was born in 1895 into a working-class family. His father was a coal merchant at Stamford, Lincolnshire, who also played the organ. Sargent grew up in Stamford and became involved in a lot of amateur music making. He learned a lot about music from singing in church and playing the organ. He took his ARCO organ diploma when he was only 16 and became an organ pupil at Peterborough Cathedral. At 18 he got a job as organist at Melton Mowbray church. In the same year he got a music degree from the University of Durham.\nAfter conducting local choirs and orchestras he got the opportunity to conduct his own composition \"Impressions on a Windy Day\" with Henry Wood\u2019s Queen\u2019s Hall Orchestra, first at Leicester and then at the Proms in the Queen's Hall. Wood encouraged him in his conducting. He started to teach at the Royal College of Music and moved to London. He conducted the Robert Mayer children\u2019s concerts and the Courtauld-Sargent concerts, a series which was aimed at people who had never been to concerts. He conducted for Sergei Diaghilev\u2019s Ballets Russes and, in 1928 he became conductor of the Royal Choral Society, a job which he kept until his death.\nIllness, and mid career.\nIn 1932 he was very ill with tuberculosis, but he recovered during the next few years. He often conducted the London Philharmonic Orchestra which had been formed in 1932 by Thomas Beecham. He did not often conduct opera, but he did conduct at the Royal Opera House: in 1936 with Gustave Charpentier's opera \"Louise\" in 1936 and in 1954 the first performance of Walton's \"Troilus and Cressida\".\nAs an orchestra conductor Sargent was not always popular. He made many enemies with a remark he made in 1936 when he said that orchestral musicians should not have a secure \u201cjob for life\u201d but should give their \u201clifeblood with every bar they played\u201d. Sargent had only just recovered from a long illness himself, during which time the musicians had given him support, so they were very annoyed when he said this.\nHe was very popular in Australia and nearly took a job there, but when World War II started he decided he should work in his own country. During the war, Sargent conducted the Hall\u00e9 Orchestra in Manchester (1939-42) and the Liverpool Philharmonic (1942-48) and became a popular radio broadcaster with the BBC. He helped the British people to keep their spirits up during the war by touring and giving many concerts and not asking for much money. During one concert he was playing Beethoven's \"Symphony No. 7\" when there was an air raid. Sargent stopped the orchestra, calmed the audience by saying they were safer inside the hall than they would be outside, and started to conduct again. The orchestra played extremely well that night. In May 1941 Sargent conducted Elgar's \"Dream of Gerontius\" in an afternoon concert in the Queen's Hall. That night the Queen\u2019s Hall was completely destroyed by a bomb.\nIn 1945, Arturo Toscanini invited Sargent to conduct the NBC Symphony Orchestra. He gave four concerts, in which he included mostly British music.\nThe Proms and later years.\nSargent was chief conductor of the Proms from 1948 until his death in 1967. In 1950 he followed Sir Adrian Boult as conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra. He held that job until 1957 when he became Chief Guest Conductor. Everywhere that Sargent took the orchestra the audience were wild with excitement. The orchestra became internationally famous.\nSargent was a very popular person at the Proms. He made the Last Night (the last concert of each season) into an exciting celebration in which the audience waved flags and joined together to sing, hum and clap. He conducted music by famous classical composers as well as British music by more recent composers. However, he did not conduct modern experimental music.\nDuring his time at the Proms foreign conductors such as Carlo Maria Giulini, Georg Solti, Leopold Stokowski, Rudolf Kempe, Pierre Boulez and Bernard Haitink were invited to perform. There were also some foreign orchestras.\nWhen the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra nearly had to come to an end after Beecham's death in 1961, Sargent worked hard to save the orchestra. A lot of the players, who still remembered the remark he made in 1936, started to support him again.\nBy the mid-1960s Sargent was suffering from cancer. He was too ill to conduct the Proms in 1967, but on 16 September, at the Last Night, to everyone\u2019s astonishment, he appeared at the end of the concert to talk to his audience. He gave his baton to Colin Davis who took over his job. Sargent looked very ill, and died two weeks later.\nAchievement and reputation.\nSargent received many honours. He was knighted in 1947 and received the Royal Philharmonic Society gold medal in 1959. His nickname was \u201cFlash Harry\u201d because he always dressed and behaved in a flashy style. He was often known as \u201cBritain\u2019s ambassador of music\u201d, because he often toured all over the world with his orchestras, conducting British music, especially the works of Elgar, Vaughan Williams, Holst and Walton. If the professional musicians he worked with did not always like him, his audiences loved him and he was especially fond of the Promenaders. At his memorial service in Westminster Abbey the whole of the nave was reserved for Promenade Season Ticket holders"}

He leads the hip hop group N-Dubz. Contostavlos was raised on a Camden Town council estate, North London by his mother, Zoe Contostavlos and father, Byron Contostavlos. His father was the bassist in 1970s group Mungo Jerry.Contostavlos is from Greek origin but speaks fluent English with a classic North London accent. He does not think of himself to be \"English in anyway\". At home he speaks Greek. He says he is a \"foreign guy that lives in Camden\". He wears unusual hats. His trademark is a selection of woolly fleece lined hats with big pom-poms on the top and strings on the sides. These have been called \"Dappy hats\". He normally turns up one side of the hat.\nEarly life and current status.\nDappy was born in Camden Town, London. It is said that he grew up in a small council flat with his parents and older brother. He actually lived in a large townhouse because his father was a member of 1970s band Mungo Jerry. In an interview he gave to The Sun, he said that the estate he lived on was \"rough and lots of the kids I saw got into drugs or fights\". Dappy showed interest in music from a young age. He started performing around Camden Town at the age of 13 years old. He performed with band members Richard \"Fazer\" Rawson and Tula \"Tulisa\" Contostavlos, who is his cousin. At the time they were called the \"Lickle Rinsers Crew\". Contostavlos and his band-mates studied at Haverstock School. Contostavlos was forced to leave the school when he was 15, for multiple truancies and fighting. He later went back to study at college and received a GCSE A* in English. His father, Byron was, to Dappy, the \"inspiration behind the band\". With the money he made from his time in the band, Bryon set up a small studio for the band. When Byron died, the song N-Dubz wrote \"Papa (Can You Hear Me?)\" was played at his funeral. It became the group's best hit at #19, and at #17 in the download charts. Dappy later had the words \"RIP Dad\" tattooed on his neck. He refers to his dad as \"B\" or \"Uncle B\".\nHe is a housemate in the 2014 series of Celebrity Big Brother (UK).\nPersonal life.\nN-Dubz were forced to change some of their live shows from the Uncle B tour after Dappy got temporary deafness. He later said that it \"was terrible and it has really taught me to take better care of my ears because I wouldn't be the musician I am today if I couldn't hear.\"\nCriticism.\nIn 2007 Dappy released \"Love For My Slum\" with fellow UK rap artist Baker Trouble. It was number one on Channel U for several weeks. It did not do as well with the media. It was heavily criticised for a scene in which Dappy is stood outside a block of expensive luxury flats with a \"rich kid\" who is trying to look like a gangster. \"The Independent\" wrote \"His lyrics combine jealousy with anger: 'You got too much to lose / You're in a great position... You wouldn't last a minute where I'm from / You'd go missing / So appreciate what you got / 'cos I'm still wishing.' And then he grabs the rich kid by his coat, pulls him toward him, and punches him in the face. The silent boy falls instantly to the pavement...\", they then went on to put \"Do scenes like these suggest that music videos are encouraging their viewers to indulge in criminality?\". Other newspapers put that he was \"idolising thuggery\". When asked in interviews about the single, and these comments he said \"these people need to listen to the lyrics, they are about showing appreciation to what you've got\".\nIn December 2008, Contostavlos pleaded guilty to two counts of assault at Chelmsford Magistrates Court, Essex. He spat in a girl's face while drunk on a night out. He got four weeks' imprisonment, suspended for 12 months and 100 hours community service. He was also ordered to pay \u00a350 to the girl and her friend, and \u00a3300 costs.\nOn 29 January 2009, Contostavlos was arrested after he someone said he was saying he would kill someone while he had a gun. He said this is not true. The police searched his Camden home looking for a gun. Three days later (Saturday 31 January) he was taken off a British Airways flight from Edinburgh to London by police after it landed, with fellow N-Dubz performer Fazer, after appearing to be acting disorderly. A source said: \"They were swearing at kids on the plane, being foul and threatening passengers. Cabin crew called ahead to the police, who were waiting when the plane landed. They were taken away by armed officers.\"\nDappy has also had many problems in the media with celebrities such as Alexandra Burke, Elly Jackson of La Roux, and Flo Rida. \nHis 2008 drunkenness has caused problems in January 2010 when he applied for a visa to the United States. He has since been allowed a visa.\nDappy hit a man in Chelmsford in February 2014, for which in June 2014 he was convicted of common assault and fined."}

The contract allows the electricity provider to produce power on the land owner's land or roof and the land owner buys the electricity primarily from the electricity provider. This deal is often done using solar technology, where the electricity provider will install, operate, and maintain solar panels on the land owner's roof. Then the land owner will buy the electricity from the solar panels on the roof. Part of the PPA is to set a price for the electrcity (often lower than the previous price the land owner was paying for power line electrcity). If the solar panels do not provide enough electricity for the land owner, then he will buy the rest of his electrcity from the power lines. If the electricity provider creates more electricity than the land owner needs, then he will sell the excess to the power lines.\nSchools and government buildings often like to do power purchasing agreements because they do not have the money to install solar panals on their roof. Large department stores also like to do power purchasing agreements because they have large roofs and do not want to deal with the costs of installing and maintaining panels.\nPower Purchasing agreements tend to last 5 \u2013 20 years. At the end of the PPA, either the contract is extended, the solar panels are removed from the property, or the land owner buys the solar panels from the electricity provider.\nPower Purchasing agreements have been very important to the expansion of solar electricity use in the United States. Investment tax credits from the federal and state governments have helped make the price of solar panels affordable for the providing companies. The tax credit can help pay for significant percentage of the project cost in some cases. \nSome of the electricity providers who offer PPAs are:"}

It is directly north of Portland, Oregon and south of Vancouver, British Columbia. Both cities were named for George Vancouver, a British explorer and sea captain. The city of Vancouver includes Fort Vancouver, begun by the British Hudson's Bay Company in 1824. It was made part of the United States on June 15, 1846, as part of the Oregon Treaty. It is the fourth largest city in Washington State.\nHistory.\nThe Vancouver area was home to Native Americans before the arrival of Europeans. Chinook and Klickitat tribes called this area \"land of the mud turtles\" before 1775. Disease killed most natives before the Hudson's Bay Company came in the 1820s. The Hudson's Bay Company built Fort Vancouver to trade in beaver skins, which were used to make top hats. Workers at Fort Vancouver came from England, the Sandwich Islands, Scotland and Canada. Many trappers had native wives and lived outside Fort Vancouver.\nAmericans began to arrive from the Oregon Trail. John McLoughlin was head man at Fort Vancouver and helped the Americans with tools and seed. Fort Vancouver closed in the 1840s. The city of Vancouver was incorporated in 1857 and was over three times as big by 1909. In 1917, the first bridge connecting Oregon to Washington over the Columbia River was built from Vancouver. In 1982 another bridge was built a few miles east for the I-205 freeway.\nColumbia Barracks became Vancouver Barracks and was the biggest US military base in Oregon, Washington or Idaho for many years. During World War I the Vancouver Barracks had a lumber mill to cut spruce wood to make biplanes. Another ship yard built ships for World War II. Shipyard workers came and Vancouver grew from 18,000 to over 80,000 people. Vancouver grew again and in 1997 grew again to almost its present size. About half as many people live just north of Vancouver as live inside the city. About one in three Vancouver workers have jobs in Portland, Oregon.\nGeography and Climate.\nVancouver is located at 45\u00b038\u20321\u2033 North, 122\u00b036\u203211\u2033 West (45.633743, \u2212122.603011).\nVancouver is just north of the Columbia River and west of the volcanic Cascade Range mountains and the Columbia gorge. Vancouver is about fifty miles from the Pacific Ocean, which gives it rain. Because it is in a valley between the Pacific Coast and Cascade mountains, there are clouds in winter. When it is clear one can see Mount Hood, the Mount Saint Helens volcano and Mount Adams from Vancouver.\nVancouver is north of Portland, Oregon and shares a similar climate: wet from November through June and dry from July through October. Vancouver has snow once or twice a year, on average. Vancouver has a total area of . Abuout 7% is water, including Vancouver Lake to the west.\nArchitecture and Buildings.\nThe National Register of Historic Places says that Vancouver is a good place to visit.

{"id": "185435", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=185435", "title": "Radiant heating", "text": "Radiant heating occurs when a hot surface warms other objects around it. Radiant heating has a long history of use in buildings by the Romans and the Koreans, and is much more efficient than standard ways of heating the air in a building. Underfloor radiant heating is the most common type of radiant heating used in buildings, but wall and overhead radiant heating systems are also used. Radiant heating can also be used to heat outdoor areas. \nHistory of Radiant Heating.\nThe Romans were the first people to use underfloor radiant heating systems. These systems were based on hypocausts, and used warm air for heat. The floor was set on top of many brick piles, leaving room for the hot air and steam produced by a furnace to pass underneath the floor. The hot air then went up chimneys on the sides of the walls, so the hot air and steam never actually went into the living rooms. These systems were very expensive to build and maintain, so only the rich could afford them. \nIn Korea, radiant underfloor heating has been in use for about 2000 years. Ondol, which means \"warm stone,\" involves the use of stones and underground ducts to help transport warm air from the kitchen to the rooms in the house. Most homes and buildings in Korea still use ondol, although they now use hot water and electric systems. The American architect Frank Lloyd Wright discovered ondol in the early 1900s and used it in many of his building designs. Wright also invented hot water underfloor systems.\nTypes of Radiant Heating.\nUnderfloor heating.\nThe most common kind of radiant heating is underfloor heating. There are three types of underfloor heating: hot air systems, hot water systems and electric systems. \nHot air systems.\nHot air systems use hot air to heat the floor, similar to the Romans' systems. However, air does not hold heat very well, and these systems aren't recommended for residential use. \nHot water systems.\nHot water systems are the most popular and cost-effective systems for cold climates. In this type of system, water is heated by a boiler and pumped through pipes laid underneath the floor. Hot water systems can also be combined with solar thermal energy to make them more environmentally friendly. Solar thermal energy uses sunlight to heat water, which can then be used in the underfloor heating system. \nHot water systems can also be run in reverse by running cold water through the pipes to cool the building. However, this technology is difficult to use properly and can result in condensation on the floor, which can ruin hardwood floors or rugs and make people more likely to fall.\nElectric systems.\nElectric systems are made of electric cables that are laid underneath the floor. Electricity is then used to heat the cables, and this type of system can be turned on or off much faster than a hot water system. However, these systems are often more expensive than hot water systems because of the high prices of electricity, especially if the hot water system includes the use of solar thermal energy. The high cost of an electric heating system can be reduced if the floor can be set to heat during non-peak hours, such as late at night, and is left turned off during the day. Electric systems are also less environmentally friendly because electricity is usually produced by burning fossil fuels, which increases carbon emissions.\nUnderfloor installation.\nUnderfloor radiant heating systems can be installed as either wet or dry systems. Wet systems are laid down and then concrete is poured over them. Concrete floors hold heat very well, but can take a long time to absorb the heat. Dry systems run in open air space between the foundation and the floor, but can be less efficient because they have to heat the air too. However, dry systems are much easier to reach if the system breaks or leaks. \nAny kind of flooring can be used with underfloor heating, but ceramic tiles are the most popular floor material because they transfer and store heat well. Materials like wood, carpet, or linoleum tile decrease the heat transfer from the underfloor system and the system must be set at a higher temperature if any of these materials are used.\nWall and overhead heating.\nWall and overhead radiant heating systems are usually made of aluminum panels hung on the walls or ceiling. Like underfloor radiant heating, these panels can be heated by either hot water or electricity. However, panels heated by hot water often leak, so electric panels are the most common. These panels can't heat as much area as an underfloor system, but they can be quickly turned on and off when a person enters or leaves the room. Electric panels can reduce energy costs if panels are left turned off in empty rooms.\nOutdoor heating.\nUsing radiant heating outdoors is much more practical than heating air because the air is always moving outside. Outdoor radiant heaters are almost always electric devices, and usually portable, although it is possible to have underfloor radiant heating installed under a patio."}

Usually, backpackers hike in groups to stay safer. They must think to bring first aid supplies, sleeping bags, tents, rain gear, stoves, food and other camping supplies.\nBackpacking may be done on short or long trips. Sometimes, backpacking groups begin at a trail head with a parking lot and hike over a weekend until they work their way back to the vehicle. On longer trips, groups may settle in at a base camp and hike for weeks or even months if they are more experienced and prepared.\nWhen following certain rules, backpackers have the chance to leave the outdoors better than they found them. There are certain practices such as Leave No Trace that teach backpackers and hikers to pack out all waste and help conserve nature in every way possible such as not building fires in dry areas, saving water, and protecting the environment. When backpackers use these skills, they help preserve nature while getting to explore themselves while outside the influence of the rest of the world."}

It is used by several organizations including Wikimedia, Debian, Gentoo, BerryTube, and the KDE.\nHow it works.\nVoters rank the candidates in the order from the one that they most want to win to the one they least want to win. The same preference (how much the voters want the candidate to win or lose) can be given to more than one candidate, and candidates can be given no number (they are interpreted as the worst).\nNext, for every pair of two candidates, the two are compared: ignoring all other candidates, which of the two in the pair is preferred by most voters? How many voters agree with the majority decision is noted.\nMore calculations take place. Given two candidates A and K, A is said to beat K with strength \"t\" if \"t\" voters prefer A to B, \"t\" voters prefer B to C, and so on, and \"t\" voters prefer J to K. The winner W is the candidate which beats any other candidate X with strength \"t\", but X does not beat W with strength \"t\".\nReferences.\nMarkus Schulze, A new monotonic, clone-independent, reversal symmetric, and condorcet-consistent single-winner election method , Social Choice and Welfare, volume 36, number 2, page 267\u2013303, 2011.

The total amount of the overcharges paid by customers of a cartel is the major component of damages that can be recovered by plaintiffs in private antitrust suits. Under U.S. federal antitrust law, buyers injured by cartel overcharges are entitled to triple the overcharges that they are able to prove in court.\nThe overcharge has a one-to-one relationship to the Lerner Index, the most common measure of market power in economics. Both measures employ the same numerator (PM - PC), where PM is the observed market price and PC is the competitive benchmark price, but use different denominators. The overcharge ratio is (PM-PC)/PC, whereas the Lerner Index is (PM-PC)/PM. Both ratios are zero when a market is perfectly competitive or a cartel is ineffective in raising prices. The Lerner Index has an upper limit of one when the pure monopoly price is charged in a market. The overcharge has no upper limit."}

Extra items such as honey, coffee or cocoa can be added. Pudding or coconut cubes can be used instead of pearl tapioca.\nWhen it was first invented, not many people were interested in it. But after a bubble tea maker was interviewed on a Japanese TV program, it became popular among people of all ages. The popularity of bubble tea can be seen not only in Taiwan but also in other countries such as South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, China, Southeast Asia, Australia, Canada and the USA.\nBubble tea has now arrived in England and the rest of Europe.\nThings that are in bubble tea.\nMost bubble tea recipes contain a tea base mixed with fruit or milk, to which chewy tapioca balls or fruit jellies are added. Ice-mixed versions are usually mixed with fruit or syrup, resulting in a slushy softness. There are many varieties of the drink with a huge range of ingredients like coconut or mango. The two most popular types are bubble milk tea with tapioca and bubble milk green tea with tapioca.\nThe reason for choosing tapioca.\nAt first, people made bubble tea without tapioca pearls. But Taiwanese people started to find substances to make the sweetened flavor. Tapioca came from the cassava plant, which is a root of the trees from South America. This plant is now farmed and enjoyed around the world.\nEffects on the body from bubble tea.\nFour positive nutrients that tapioca provide are carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, and organic compounds. These include a very low level of fat, cholesterol, and sodium . It is also known as the source of fiber, \u201cgood\u201d cholesterol, and protein.
