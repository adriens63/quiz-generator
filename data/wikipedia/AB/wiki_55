Fields are sets of numbers (sometimes abstractly called elements) that have a way of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. Groups are like fields, but with only one operation often called addition (subtraction is considered addition with negative numbers). Fields are often hard to study because there are so many possible combinations of numbers, that the internal structure is hard to decipher. Groups are usually much less complex and easier to understand. Galois theory gives a concrete connection between hard to study fields and easy to study groups.\nDisclaimer.\nThe nature of Galois' work is extremely advanced. It is usually considered out of reach for general audiences, or anyone without a strong technical background in Abstract algebra. This article will go into some detail, mostly defining types of equations and groups, and give a brief overview of the main ideas behind Galois theory. This article may not truly belong on \"Simple English Wikipedia\", though it may be referenced by those who have trouble understanding the main \"Wikipedia\" page, and just need a brief discussion on the subject. Beyond the first paragraph of this page, some mathematical experience may be required. All things considered, any high schooler should be able to follow the main ideas laid forth in this article.\nHistorical Motivation.\nEuclid and Geometry.\nIn the year 300 BCE, the Greek mathematician Euclid (pronounded yook-lid) wrote a book on geometry titled \"Elements.\" The text contained thirteen books, all on how to solve problems in geometry. Euclid was able to find ways to bisect any angle; that is, he was able to find an angle that was half of any other angle. Euclid was able to do much more, too. He could construct with a straightedge and compass shapes like circles, triangles, squares, pentagons, and others. However, he was unable to find a way to make every possible polygon. For example, Euclid was unable to make a regular 9-gon, a shape with 9 equal sides, using only ruler and compass. Mathematicians, like Euclid, tried to solve other problems as well. If they could cut any angle in two halves, then was there a way to cut \"any\" angle into three equal angles? Similarly, was there a way to square the circle (find a square with area equal to \u03c0, or a square with side length equal to formula_1 ), or double the cube(find a cube with twice the volume of another, by constructing a side of the cube with length formula_2 )? These questions remained unanswered for over 2000 years.\nThe Sisters of the Quadratic Formula.\nA polynomial equation is an equation where you are only allowed to add and subtract multiples of powers of a variable, like formula_3. An \"n\"th power is a variable multiplied by itself \"n\" times. Or example polynomial has 5th, 3rd, 2nd, and 1st powers of \"x\". The degree of a polynomial is the largest power found in the equation. In school, students learn about a type of polynomial equation called a quadratic equation. This is an equation where the highest power, or multiple, is two. An example of a quadratic equation isformula_4, or formula_5. Notice that the only thing we care about is that there is a squared term. This makes the equation quadratic. If formula_6 are numbers and formula_7, then formula_8 is a valid quadratic equation. You may remember from school that if you know formula_6 then you can solve this equation using the quadratic formula,formula_10which gives the solutions to our equation only by plugging in formula_6. Mathematicians hoped to find a simple equation for the solutions (or, roots) for \"any\" polynomial equation, hopefully using only addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and two other simple calculations: powers and roots. Mathematicians were able, after years of work, to find equations for polynomials with degree 3, and eventually degree 4. However, no one was ever able to find a formula for the solutions to a polynomial with degree 5 or higher. Why not? What was preventing them from being able to plug in the (in this case, since there are 5 powers) formula_12 in formula_13 and get the answers? No one could find out why.\nFields and Groups.\nThe solution to these problems arrived out of the study of fields and groups. It turns out that each equation has a special field and group associated with it.\nFields.\nThe field associated with each equation has complicated structure. However, you can tell a lot about the structure by how much you can rearrange elements by shuffling without changing the structure. \nGroups and Sn.\nAll of the ways of shuffling a field can be turned into a group. There are special types of groups, called the \"Symmetric Group on n elements\" labeled Sn, which are all the ways of shuffling \"n\" things. Symmetric groups are well behaved and easy to work with when you only shuffle 1, 2, 3, or 4 things. If you use 5 or more, the structure of the symmetric group becomes too chaotic.\nGalois's Solution.\nUp until the early 1800s, mathematicians were able to find some answers for specific cases of these unsolved problems. Unfortunately, no one had given a reason (or, proof) for any equation. It was French mathematician \u00c9variste Galois (25 October 1811 \u2013 31 May 1832) who was the first to find a solution, explaining why certain equations like 2nd, 3rd, and 4th degree polynomials did have nice solution formulas, but other equations, like 5th degree and above, cannot have a formula. The answer boiled down to reducing the problem of the equations's field to the equation's group; Galois proved that the two had a connection.\nGalois' Realization.\nGalois noticed that the structure of the groups associated with polynomials were really just the symmetric groups in disguise. If the degree of a polynomial was \"n\", then the group of the polynomial was the symmetric group on \"n\" elements. Galois saw that the group of the equation shuffled the roots of the polynomial, and the structure of the shuffles could be analyzed instead.\nSolving Euclid's Problems.\nEuclid had wanted to find a way of cutting any angle in thirds. Galois showed that if a ruler and compass could be used to make a third of an angle, it would have an associated equation of degree 3. He showed that only powers of two could be made, by analyzing the equation's group and field. Galois showed that trisecting an arbitrary angle was impossible. Galois' theory could also be used to show that it was impossible to square a circle and double a cube.\nWhat Polynomials had Formulas?\nGalois used his theory to also show that for polynomials of degree 5 and higher, their associated groups were Sn. He also showed that if an equation had a formula to solve it, then the group of the equation would have a nice structure and was not chaotic. Since the structure of the symmetric group \"is\" chaotic for formula_14, he showed that no general formula could exist for those polynomials."}

Its scientific name, \"inermis\", means \"does not have a weapon\". Most burrowing frogs have sharp bones in their feet, but the bumpy rocket frog does not. Burrowing frogs use these bones to dig.\nThis frog lives in flood plains, forests, grasslands, swamps and streams, but it can live in rocky places if there are streams through them.\nFemales lay their eggs 100-300 at a time in temporary bodies of water with no plants in them. The tadpoles can grow to 4 cm."}

Based on the teachings of TCM, it is important to balance the five elements in a person's body: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. Each element also has something called \"yin\" and \"yang\", or opposite values that must exist alongside each other rather than to overcome the other. The way to balance the \"yin\" and \"yang\" is to strengthen \"qi\", or an invisible force that brings balance to the \"yin\" and \"yang\". Knowing the five elements and the \"yin\" and \"yang\" is important because each organ of the body is related to one of the five elements. It is important to strengthen a person's \"qi\" because balancing the \"yin\" and \"yang\" of a person's organs is important for people to be healthy.

Using affinity chromatography, they can take just one kind of molecule out of a mixture of many molecules. Affinity chromatography works on molecules that exist inside the bodies of living things and not on other molecules. Affinity chromatography is one kind of liquid chromatography.\nAffinity chromatography works because most molecules from inside living things stick to some molecules but not others, the way magnets stick to opposite magnets but not to wood or plastic. An antibody will stick to its antigen but not to a different antibody's antigen. A protein will stick to its own receptor or inhibitor but not to a different protein's receptor or inhibitor. A DNA-splicing protein will stick to its own DNA sequence but not to a different DNA sequence. In affinity chromatography, the thing that the target molecule sticks to is called the \"ligand\".\nTo prepare for affinity chromatography, scientists decide which molecule they want and find its ligand. The ligand could be an antibody if the target molecule has an antigen; DNA if the target molecule is a polymerase, DNA-binding protein, or DNA-binding enzyme; aromatic molecules if the target is a different kind of enzyme; or a peptide if the target is another biomolecule. Then they prepare a \"stationary phase\" and treat it with the ligand. The stationary phase can be membranes, special beads, or supports with different-sized pores in them.\nThen the scientists pour the mixture, or \"mobile phase\" over the stationary phase. Sometimes, the scientists add a \"binding buffer\" to help the target molecule stick to its ligand. Then the scientists rinse away the rest of the mixture. The target molecule is stuck to its ligand, which is stuck to the stationary phase, so it is not rinsed away. Then the scientists add an \"elution buffer\" to make the ligand let go of the target molecule so they can collect it. Scientists sometimes use machines or special tools to hold the stationary phase in exactly the right position and to pour the mixture, rinse, and other treatments in exactly the right way.\nIn some affinity chromatography, the binding buffer and elution buffer work by changing the pH of the solution. That means they make it more acidic or less acidic. Because most molecules from living things change shape depending on how much acid is nearby, the binding buffer and elution buffer can make the ligand and target molecule change shape to hold on tighter or let go of each other.\nAffinity chromatography does not always work perfectly. Sometimes the scientists must purify the target molecule to make sure they did not accidentally collect other molecules too.\nBecause scientists need to prepare a stationary phase with exactly the right ligand, they can only use affinity chromatography to collect molecules that they already understand well. Usually, they cannot use affinity chromatography to collect new or strange molecules."}

These are displayed in the main list in \"italics\".\nFIFA members are eligible to enter the FIFA World Cup and matches between them are recognized as official international matches. Based on their match results over the previous four-year period, the FIFA World Rankings, published monthly by FIFA, compare how good the national teams are on a point-based system.\nSome national teams who are members of a confederation but not FIFA members compete in confederation-level and subregional tournaments.

All 22 national governing bodies that form UAFA are also members of both FIFA and either the AFC or CAF. National teams from UAFA member countries are noted in the list below.\nThe Confederation of Independent Football Associations (ConIFA) is an organization for teams representing unrecognised states, subnational regions, and stateless minorities, as well as teams from recognised states that have not managed to gain entry into FIFA.

Yuzu was announced to be in development on January 14, 2018, 10 months after the Nintendo Switch came out. It is developed in C++.\nThe emulator is made by the developers of the Nintendo 3DS emulator Citra. Both programs use a lot of the same code. At first, Yuzu only supported test programs and homebrew, but as of July 2019, a small amount of games work without any issues. A list of games that work with Yuzu is updated on Yuzu's official website.\nFeatures.\nYuzu uses a network service called Boxcat instead of Nintendo's BCAT dynamic content network.\nYuzu allows the resolution to be changed to that of docked mode or undocked mode, or even higher than any of them.\nIn December 2019, Yuzu added an experimental Vulkan renderer to its Early Access build. As of April 2020, this Vulkan renderer is being used with MoltenVK to continue making Yuzu for MacOS because Apple discourages the use of OpenGL in MacOS.\nOn May 9, 2020, the development team announced an update that included experimental multi-core CPU emulation.\nReception.\nIn October 2018, \"Kotaku\" published an article saying \"Super Mario Odyssey\" was playable. The author of the article showed concern Yuzu could emulate games that were available commercially at the time.\n\"PC Gamer\" said Yuzu was able to run shortly after the games came out, but with audio issues.\nIn October 2019, Gizmodo published an article saying Yuzu could emulate some games at a frame rate at about the same speed as a real Nintendo Switch."}

Since 2014, the possession of 10 grams of cannabis flower or under can have a relatively minor penalty. Those who qualify to use marijuana as a therapy have permission to visit a dispensary, where carefully grown marijuana is sold under the authority of the Maryland government. The regulating government body that oversees the program is known as the \"Natalie M. LaPrade Medical Cannabis Commission\", or \"MMCC\". Any and all marijuana products are not covered under any insurance plans and must be paid for in cash only.\nDue to the COVID-19 outbreak, the MMCC changed laws and rules surrounding the purchase of medical cannabis to make access easier while implementing social-distancing guidelines, including allowing home-delivery. \nHistory.\nLike in most U.S. states, marijuana possession, use, manufacturing, and distribution held harsh penalties historically. In 2010, about half of all arrests made were for possession of cannabis. In Maryland, African-Americans were about 3 times more likely than caucasians to be arrested for the possession of marijuana, even though usage of cannabis is similar for most racial populations. African-Americans have received harsher penalties for similar charges than other minority groups. \nLaws.\nPossession of 10 grams of cannabis flower or less can hold a civil offense penalty with a fine not to exceed $100. Having more than 10 grams but below 50 pounds (about 22 kilograms) can have a penalty of a $1,000 fine and up to one year in incarceration. \nNatalie M. LaPrade Medical Cannabis Commission (MMCC).\nThe MMCC is the overseeing body of Maryland's medical marijuana program. Governor O'Malley signed legislation that established a medical marijuana program in Maryland in May of 2013. It is named in honor of Maryland Delegate Cheryl D. Glenn's mother who died of kidney cancer at age 87. It is believed that Glenn's mother would have benefitted from medical marijuana therapy. Doctors, nurses, dentists, podiatrists and midwives may permit patients to use and purchase marijuana. "}

{"id": "770424", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=770424", "title": "Alberto Santos-Dumont", "text": "Alberto Santos-Dumont (July 20, 1873 \u2013 July 20, 1932) was a Brazilian pilot and early aviator. He built and flew some of the first airplanes and made some of the first good steering systems for hot air balloons. He is called the \"Father of Aviation\" in Brazil.\nAccording to the First Flight Society, he was the third person in the world to fly an airplane, after only Wilbur and Orville Wright. He was the first person in Europe to fly an airplane. \nEarly life.\nAlberto Santos-Dumont was born in a village named Cabangu in Minas Gerais, Brazil. He was the sixth of his parents' eight children. Santos-Dumont's father had been born in France and trained to be an engineer. He liked to use machines on the family's large coffee farm and became rich. He taught Alberto Santos-Dumont how to use machines too.\nFor a while, Alberto Santos-Dumont studied at the Col\u00e9gio Culto \u00e0 Ci\u00eancia in Brazil, but when he was 18, his father had an accident that left him unable to move parts of his body. The Santos-Dumont family moved to Europe, and his parents sent Alberto Santos-Dumont to Paris. In Paris, he learned physics and other sciences.\nAs an adult, Alberto Santos-Dumont was about 1.62 meters tall (5' 4\").\nFlying.\nAt first, Santos-Dumont worked with hot air balloons. One problem with hot air balloons was that they were very difficult to steer. After making a few hot air balloons that could go up and down well, Alberto Santos-Dumont decided to build a good steering system. He built eleven hot air balloons that could be steered, called dirigibles, between 1898 and 1905. His third balloon in this project, \"Santos Dumont No. 3\", worked. He was able to steer it around the Eiffel Tower and land where he meant to land. His \"Santos Dumont No. 6\" won the Deutsch de la Meurthe prize.\nSantos-Dumont liked to fly his dirigibles around Paris. He became famous and popular, and people copied his clothes and style. United States President Theodore Roosevelt invited him to visit the White House. The French nicknamed him \"le petit Santos,\" or \"little Santos,\" and he became a folk hero in Brazil.\nThen Santos-Dumont decided to work on heavier-than-air flying machines, which people call airplanes or aeroplanes today. In the fall of 1906, he tried to fly his biplane, the \"Santos-Dumont 14-bis\" in a field outside Paris. Experts disagree on exactly what counts as flying and what is only a hop in the air, so perhaps his first flight was on September 13 when the \"14-bis\" stayed in the air for a short distance or perhaps it was in October when it flew for 50 meters, but everyone agrees that Santos-Dumont did fly in the fall of 1906. On November 12, 1906, outside Paris, he flew the \"14-Bis\" biplane for 220 meters (722 feet) outside Paris, 6 meters up in the air. The 14-bis used a 50-horsepower internal combustion engine, meaning an engine that burned its own fuel inside itself instead of using steam.\nBecause many people had come out to watch him fly, because he was already famous, and because the Wright Brothers had not told many people about their own flight at Kitty Hawk in 1903, many people thought Alberto Santos-Dumont was the first person to fly an airplane at all.\nAlberto Santos-Dumont made his last flight in 1910. Some time after that, doctors told him he had multiple sclerosis. He committed suicide in Brazil in 1932. Some sources say this was because he was sad that airplanes had become weapons in World War I and other wars.\nLegacy.\nAlberto Santos-Dumont is part of the First Flight Society's shrine at Kitty Hawk and listed in the Brazilian Air Ministry Almanac.\nSome people in Brazil believe Alberto Santos-Dumont was the first person to fly an airplane, before the Wright Brothers. This is for two reasons: First, some people think the Wright Brothers' flight at Kitty Hawk did not count. They believe the Wright Brothers \"Flyer\" got off the ground but not long enough to count as flying. Others say that the winds at Kitty Hawk helped the \"Flyer\" too much for the flight to count. Others say that the Kitty Hawk flight did not count because the Wright Brothers used a catapult to get the \"Flyer\" started. However, the Wright Brothers did not really use a catapult that day, though they did use one with later planes. Second, some people they think the Wright Brothers did fly, but not in 1903 when they said they did. One reason for this is that Alberto Santos-Dumont performed almost all his tests and experiments publicly. Anyone who wanted could watch him work. He often tested his planes with many people watching. The Wright Brothers kept much of their work a secret because they did not want other inventors to steal their ideas. They hoped to patent their work and make money. However, when the Wright Brothers flew their first true plane at Kitty Hawk, they asked five people from the local town and life saving station to come watch and take a photograph. By 1906, the Wright Brothers had flown many of their planes many times, for as far as 39 kilometers. Today, most aviation historians believe that Alberto Santos-Dumont was not the first person to fly.\nBy flying his dirigible around the Eiffel Tower and landing on purpose, Alberto Santos-Dumont helped convince people that flying machines were not only interesting inventions but that they could be useful in real life. He also invented the \"Desmoiselle\", a monoplane. That means it was a plane with one set of wings instead of two sets of wings like a biplane. The \"Desmoiselle\" flew so well that it helped monoplanes become the most common type of plane."}

In the fall of 1906, it became the first airplane to fly in Europe.\nSantos-Dumont tried several times before he truly managed to fly in the \"14-bis\". His first attempt in July 1906 did not work. In September, he managed two short hops. In October, the \"14-bis\" flew for 50 meters. That was the first flight that the Aero Club of France ever officially witnessed. In November, he was able to keep the \"14-bis\" in the air for 220 meters, 6 meters up in the air.\nAccording to the Aero Club of France, the \"14-bis\" was 40 feet wide from wingtip to wingtip, 33 feet wide, and weighed 352 pounds. It used an Antoinette engine. It was made out of pine and bamboo with aluminum to keep it together. Its wings were made out of silk cloth. \nThe \"14-bis\" had three different sets of controls so Alberto Santos-Dumont could steer. Some were tied to his shoulders so that he looked like he was dancing or shaking while in the air.\nNo one knows where the original \"14-bis\" from the fall of 1906 is now. Experts think Santos-Dumont took it apart and used the pieces to build other airplanes.\nSome people, especially in Brazil, believe the \"14-bis\" was the first airplane to fly, before the Wright Brothers' \"Flyer\". The main reason for this is that although the Wright Brothers flew the \"Flyer\" at Kitty Hawk in 1903, they did not tell many people about it right away. Europeans saw Alberto Santos-Dumont fly the \"14-bis\" in 1906 before they heard about the Wrights flying the \"Flyer\" in 1903. This was because the Wright Brothers hoped to patent their work and make money, so they kept most of their experiments a secret. Alberto Santos Dumont was not trying to make money, so he invited almost anyone who wanted to come watch him work. However, the Wright Brothers did invite witnesses to their first flight at Kitty Hawk in 1903 to watch and take a photograph. By 1906, the Wright Brothers had flown many of their planes many times, for as far as 39 kilometers. Today, most aviation historians believe that the \"14-bis\" was not the first plane to fly."}

{"id": "770927", "revid": "1011873", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=770927", "title": "Cannabinoid", "text": "A cannabinoid is a chemical found in the cannabis (marijuana) plant. There are 113 cannabinoids that scientists know of, but there are likely more. Two of the best known cannabinoids are tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). THC is a psychoactive drug, meaning it can make you feel and think differently. Not all cannabinoids are psychoactive and each one works differently. All cannabinoids share a similar chemical structure and are researched for treating diseases.\nReceptors in the body.\nCannabinoids work by connecting, or binding, to receptors in the body. These receptors make up a system called the endocannabinoid system (ECS). There are two types of receptors: CB1 (cannabinoid receptor type 1) and CB2 (cannabinoid receptor type 2). CB1 receptors are mostly found in the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain and spine. It is also found in other places in the body like sex organs. CB2 is found in the peripheral nervous system in other parts of the body. CB2 receptors are found in the immune system, which is the system that prevents us from getting sick.\nPhytocannabinoids.\nPhytocannabinoids are cannabinoids that are found naturally in the cannabis plant are are affected by light. They are different than synthetic cannabinoids that are made in a laboratory (lab). When exposed to light, phytocannabinoids can change their chemical structure and turn into other cannabinoids. \nSynthetic cannabinoids.\nSynthetic cannabinoids are cannabinoids that are man-made in labs. They are used as a drug for research purposes and do not work the same way that natural cannabinoids do. Synthetic cannabinoids are also known as \"K2\" and \"spice\". People who have taken synthetic cannabinoids as a drug have gotten very sick and some have died.\nPharmacology.\nCannabinoids are fatty and oily chemicals that can connect to fat cells in our bodies. This is why it takes a long time to pass a drug test after using marijuana. The \"high\" feeling that people get when using marijuana depends on if they smoke a marijuana cigarette (\"joint\"), vape cannabis oils, or eat food with cannabis in it. Most people feel high for a few hours after using cannabis. Cannabinoids that bind to CB1 and CB2 receptors get into the bloodstream after being used and can change how the body functions for a short amount of time. \nMedicinal use.\nSome medicines, like Marinol (dronabinol), are carefully made in a lab to help sick people. THC is used to help nausea for people getting chemotherapy. CBD can help people with epilepsy who get seizures. In places, where it is legal, medical marijuana is grown carefully and sold in stores called dispensaries. \nLegality.\nThe legality of cannabinoids is different around the world. Many first-world nations have passed laws for people to use marijuana to treat their diseases known as medical marijuana as well as allowing recreational use for adults. Using of having marijuana can be illegal in other countries and be punished with fines, time in jail, or the death penalty. In the United States, psychoactive cannabinoids are illegal on the federal level, but many states have passed laws that allow people to have, use, and grow marijuana. CBD is popular in the U.S. because it is not psychoactive and can be sent in the mail. \nHistory.\nCannabis has been used for thousands of years. CBD was discovered in 1940. THC was discovered in 1964 by Dr. Raphael Mechoulam and Dr. Yechiel Gaoni in Israel."}

The Australian 2/6th Independent Company flew into the valley from Port Moresby in 13 USAAF C-47 Dakotas, making a difficult landing on a rough airstrip. Unaware that a much larger Japanese force was also headed for Kaiapit and Nadzab, the company attacked the village on 19 September to secure the area so that it could be developed into an airfield. They then held it against a strong counterattack. During two days of fighting the larger force, the Australians suffered relatively few losses. Their victory at Kaiapit enabled the Australian 7th Division to be flown into the upper Markham Valley, stopping the Japanese from threatening Lae or Nadzab, where a major airbase was being developed. The victory also led to the capture of the Ramu Valley, which provided new forward fighter airstrips for the air war."}

It has vomerine teeth in its upper jaw.\nThis frog lives near the ocean and on islands with sandy soil. It lives in creeks and marshes that have acidic water (pH 2.8-5.5), such as wallums. If the water becomes less acidic, then other frogs move in and eat all the food. Adult frogs climb on sedge plants during the day.\nThis frog lays eggs in acidic water (pH &lt; 6) in temporary or semi-permanent swamps. They lay eggs 200-1000 at a time near sedge plants.\nThis frog is also in danger because humans like to build things in the places where they live. Humans like beaches and seashores, so they sometimes walk over the grasses and shore plants where the frog likes to hide during the day. Scientists also think the fungal disease chytridiomycosis might be killing these frogs.\nScientists think this frog is also in danger because of invasive species. Plants from other places might change the places where these frogs like to live. Frogs from other places eat all their food. Fish from other places, such as mosquito fish, eat the tadpoles and eggs. Feral pigs can also run through the wallums and damage them. "}

It uses many of the concepts already known from discrete mathematics; for example Venn diagrams to show which elements are contained in a set, or Boolean algebra. It is powerful enough for many areas of contemporary mathematics and engineering. The term naive set theory is used for this kinds of set theory. It is usually contrasted with axiomatic set theory.\nNaive set theory leads to a number of problems:\nThere is a problem though: All the problems above can only be shown to be problems when axioms can be used to describe sets and their properties. \nRichard Dedekind (1831-1916) discovered this and started a new set theory, in 1888. In his set theory, there are axioms about sets. His set theory is not good enough though:\nErnst Zermelo published a set theory in 1908. It uses axioms to define sets, and very much limits the ways in which sets can be made. Together with Abraham Fraenkel he is one of the creators of Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory, the set theory that was used for the much of the 20th century. Because of G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems this can only be proved for finite sets, though.\nWhen teaching about sets in schools, naive set theory and the definition of Georg Cantor are sometimes used."}

It is from the eastern United States but human beings brought it to many other parts of the world, such as Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Australia, where it has caused problems as an invasive specie.\nThe adult male eastern mosquitofish grows to 3.5 cm and the female to 6.0 cm. It is green or brown on top and blue, white or silver on the bottom. It has large eyes and one dorsal fin and a round tail fin.\nThis fish likes to live in fresh water but can live in water that has some salt. It can survive cold and warm temperatures. It eats insects and their larvae.\nPeople brought the eastern mosquitofish to Hawaii in the 1910s and to Australia in the 1920s and set it free there. They thought it would eat mosquito larvae so there would be fewer mosquitoes. But the eastern mosquitofish did not eat more mosquitoes than the fish that were already in Australia did. The eastern mosquitofish outcompetes other fish and bites their tails or even eats them. It can kill larger fish by damaging their fins. In the western United States, the eastern mosquitofish killed or outcompeted many other fish that were better at controlling mosquitoes than it is. After people put eastern mosquitofish in a body of water, there may be an algal bloom because the eastern mosquitofish eats or kills all the fish that usually eat the algae.\nThis fish likes to eat frog eggs and tadpoles. It is one reason why the green and golden bell frog is endangered in Australia and the Chiricahua leopard frog in Arizona. \nThe fish has 50-300 eggs at a time. The eggs stay inside the female's body until they hatch. It takes the new fish two months to become adults. Eastern mosquitofish can do this several times each year.\nThe western mosquitofish \"G. affinis\" and eastern mosquitofish \"G. holbrooki\" used to both be called \"G. affinis\" because people thought they were the same species. They are not. According to the IUCN Global Invasive Species Database, most records in Australia that say \"G. affinis\" really refer to \"G. holbrooki\"."}

They stop the animal from licking or biting its body and from scratching or touching its head with its feet.\nOverview.\nThe veterinarian places the collar around the neck of an injured animal so that it cannot bite or lick the injured part of its body. For example, a dog with a cut on its skin might need medicine placed directly on the cut. The dog might try to lick the medicine and poison itself. An animal that has had surgery might try to pull out its stitches. An animal with a broken leg might bite into its cast and try to pull it off. If it is wearing an Elizabethan collar, it cannot do this. \nSome pet owners say their pets find it difficult to eat, drink and play while wearing an Elizabethan collar. Veterinarians sometimes try other collars, like those made out of cloth, collars that look like inner-tube-shaped cushions, and collars that act more like a neck brace, stopping the animal from moving its head.\nElizabethan collars are named after Elizabethan ruffs, stiff, starched collars that people wore in 1500s England.\nToday, most Elizabethan collars are made out of plastic. In the 1800s, they could be made out of wood or leather."}

Their arrival was largely accidental, and the Portuguese sought control of commerce, rather than territory. The Portuguese were later drawn into the internal politics of the island with the political upheaval of the Wijayaba Kollaya, and used these internal divisions to their advantage during the Sinhalese\u2013Portuguese War, first in an attempt to control the production of valuable cinnamon and later of the entire island. Direct Portuguese rule did not begin until after the death of Dharmapala of Kotte, who died without an heir, and had bequeathed the Kingdom of Kotte to the Portuguese monarch in 1580. That allowed the Portuguese sufficient claim to the Kingdom of Kotte upon Dharmapala's death in 1597. Portuguese rule began with much resistance by the local population.\nEventually, the Kingdom of Kandy sought help from the Dutch East India Company, with whom they initially entered into agreement. After the collapse of the Iberian economy in 1627, the Dutch\u2013Portuguese War saw the Dutch conquest of most of Portugal's Asian colonies - Ceylon included, between 1638 and 1658. Nevertheless, elements of Portuguese culture from this colonial period remain in Sri Lanka.\nHistory.\nArrival and establishment of the Portuguese (1505-1543).\nThe first contact between Sri Lanka and the Portuguese was established by Dom Louren\u00e7o de Almeida in 1505\u20136. It was largely accidental and it wasn't until 12 years later that the Portuguese sought to establish a fortified trading settlement."}
{"id": "771328", "revid": "1025341", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=771328", "title": "Medicare (United States)", "text": "Medicare is a national health insurance program in the United States. It began in 1965 under the Social Security Administration (SSA) by Lyndon B. Johnson and now administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). It gives health care insurance for Americans aged 65 and older, people with End-Stage Renal Disease and also for some younger people with disability. Medicare consists of three parts:\nMedicare Part A (Hospital Insurance): Covers inpatient hospital care, skilled nursing facility care, hospice, and some home health care.\nMedicare Part B (Medical Insurance): Covers doctor office visits and services, outpatient care, medical supplies, and preventative care and services.\nMedicare Part D (prescription drug coverage): Covers the cost of prescription drugs, flu shots, and vaccines.\nMedicare Advantage.\nMedicare Advantage is part of the Medicare program offered to older people and disabled adults who qualify. Also referred to as Part C plans, Medicare Advantage (MA) plans are provided by private insurance companies instead of the federal government. They include the same Part A hospital and Part B medical coverage that Original Medicare provides but not hospice care. Most MA plans also include Part D prescription drug coverage. Anyone who joins an MA plan still has Medicare.\nThe average monthly premium for a Medicare Advantage plan in 2021 is expected to drop 11% to about $21 from an average of $23.63 in 2020. Private companies receive a fixed amount each month for Medicare Advantage plan care. In turn, these companies can charge out-of-pocket costs to policyholders and are able to establish their own rules for service such as the need for referrals or provider networks for both non-urgent care and emergency services.\nRegional preferred provider organizations (PPOs) were established to provide rural beneficiaries greater access to Medicare Advantage plans and cover entire statewide or multi-state regions. Regional PPOs accounted for 5% of all Medicare Advantage enrollees in 2020. About 24 million people, or 36% of those receiving Medicare benefits, were enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan in 2020. That number is expected to climb to more than 26 million in 2021.\nMedicare for Alcoholism.\nMedicare Parts A and B include coverage for addiction treatment, including alcohol rehab. According to Medicare Interactive, a website that provides information on Medicare plans, Medicare Part A can help pay for hospitalization for substance abuse treatment, while Part B can help cover treatment for partial hospitalization or outpatient addiction treatment services.\nIn addition, Medicare Part D provides coverage for medications used in treating alcohol addiction, such as naltrexone, as long as these drugs are considered medically necessary for the policyholder."}

{"id": "771332", "revid": "1152007", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=771332", "title": "Among Us", "text": "Among Us is an American science-fiction social deduction video game made by Innersloth. Inc. It was released for iOS and Android on June 15, 2018, for PC on Steam on November 16, 2018. It was also released on itch.io on August 17, 2018. \"Among Us\" follows a crew being killed one at a time by an Impostor. The game got very popular in late 2020 because many Twitch streamers and YouTubers have played it.\nGameplay.\nIn \"Among Us\", players play as one of four to fifteen players, and can either be a \"Crewmate\" or an \"Impostor\". Each game has one to three Impostors in it. The number of Impostors can be changed at the start of the game.\nCrewmates are given a list of tasks to complete at the start of the game. They can win if everyone does their tasks, or if they vote out all the Impostors.\nImpostors can win by killing all the Crewmates, or killing enough Crewmates so that there are more Impostors than Crewmates. They do not have tasks, but instead have a list of \"fake tasks\". Impostors can pretend to complete these tasks to make it seem like they are not Impostors. Impostors can travel around the map using vents, and \"sabotage\" parts of the map (such as causing a reactor meltdown on The Skeld) to distract or kill other Crewmates.\nEvery player has a chance to call an emergency meeting or, when they see a dead body, to report it to everyone else. During a meeting, players can talk about who they think is the Impostor. This is the only time when players can talk to each other and vote. If a player gets the most votes, they are voted out, meaning they are removed from the game. Among Us does not let players use voice chat. Players can only talk by typing messages. Because of this, many players use services like Discord for voice chat.\nWhen a player is killed by the Impostor, or if they are voted out, they become a ghost. Ghosts can not do things with other players, and they can not talk or vote during meetings. However, they can still do tasks, and see the rest of the game. Ghost Impostors can also sabotage to help their teammates. If both the Crewmates and the ghosts complete their tasks, the Crewmates will win.\nMaps.\nThe Skeld.\n\"The Skeld\" is the very first map in Among Us. It was released with the game, and is the most popular map. It used to be the only free map in the game, and is set in a simple spaceship.\nMira HQ.\n\"Mira HQ\" is the second map in the game. Unlike The Skeld, the map was released as paid content, and is set in a floor in a floating building that is the headquarters of the company MIRA. It was announced on August 3, 2019, and it was released on August 8, 2019. As of June 11, 2020, this map became free for all players to play. This map contains new features such as new tasks, a decontamination system and a door log.\nPolus.\n\"Polus\" is set in a base in a planet named Polus. This map, like \"Mira HQ\", was also released as paid content. This map does not have vents for the Impostor, but holes that connect the different buildings. This map is quite big and open compared to the other maps. It also has a new camera system. As of June 11, 2020, this map also became free for all players to play. Most tasks/features in this map are only in this map.\nThe Airship.\n\"The Airship\" is the fourth map in the game. It was announced at The Game Awards on December 10, 2020. It is based off of the Airship from \"Infiltrating the Airship\" in The Henry Stickmin Collection, another game Innersloth worked on. It has been released on the 31st of March 2021 for free.\nReception.\nThe game received mainly positive reviews but some criticized the game because 'after a while, you just see the same old maps', while on Steam the game received 'very positive' reviews.\nAmong Us got a lot more popular in the summer of 2020, because a lot of Twitch streamers started streaming themselves playing it, at some point making it the most viewed category on Twitch. There were so many new players causing servers to go down, even though they were designed for scalability. Developers decided to redesign servers to account for the influx of new players.\nIt is maintaining its popularity due to large YouTube creators making videos on it, like MrBeast. Some YouTube creators were introduced to it by The Henry Stickmin Collection. \nPopularity.\nThe game got popular in some regions like South Korea and Brazil before getting popular worldwide. PuffBalls United stated that the game is more popular in Mexico, Brazil, and South Korea than the United States. According to ForteBass, Twitch streamer Sodapoppin first popularized the game worldwide on Twitch in July of 2020. \nThe game was played by several content creators and streamers after it got popular.\nContinued popularity.\nThe game's popularity continued into the following months. The pandemic also raised its popularity. The game popularized the slang word \"sus\" (note that it has been used before the game's popularity). The game also had many ironic internet memes, like Sussy, Sussy Baka, \"When the imposter is sus\", and \"Amogus\". as well as references to random or otherwise bizarre objects such as trash cans, fire alarms, and backpacks resembling the Crewmate."}

It has a built-in suppresor. The special rifle (AS) development began in the first half of the late 1980s in the Central Research Institute of Precision Engineering, in the city of Klimovsk part of the Moscow region. The lead designer of the rifle is Pyotr Serdyukov.\nTsNIITochMash (Central Institute for Precision Machine Building) developed it in 1987. Since 1987, the Soviet Army and the KGB used it in their arsenal. Russian Spetsnaz special forces and some divisions of the Russian Army also use it.\nThe rifle is expensive and there are not many AS-Vals available. It is not used often according to many Russian Spetsnaz operators. It is used during special operations by either sabotage or reconnaissance units deployed behind enemy lines. \nThe AS Val and VSS are very effective. Some Russian army and special forces units, and Moscow\u2019s intelligence and security forces still use it. Forces used the rifles during the last years of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. They were also important in the Chechen wars and the conflict in Georgia.\nMost recently, Russia used the weapon during military operations in Crimea and Syria.\nDesign.\nThe AS Val has an effective range of about 300 m. It uses heavy subsonic 9\u00d739mm SP-6 (high-performance armor-piercing) ammunition (which weigh down the bullet). It also uses the SP-5 ball cartridge used by the VSS Vintorez suppressed sniper rifle. It can also use the same 10- or 20-round magazines of the VSS Vintorez and the 30-round magazine of the SR-3M. Controls are similar to all AK-type rifles. It has a charging handle on the right side, a tangent rear sight, a magazine release button behind the magazine well, and a safety lever above the trigger guard. The fire selector is located within the trigger guard, behind the trigger.\nThe rifle has two modes of fire: semi-automatic and fully automatic fire. It has a cyclic rate of fire of 900 rounds per minute (RPM). According to its users, the AS Val is reliable, accurate, and well liked.\nThe rifle has an AK-type side mount for various optical sights. For example, it has the 4x PSO-1 scope and night sights such as the 1PN51 calibrated for use with the 9\u00d739mm cartridge. The standard open sights are graduated up to 400 m in 25 m increments.\nThe AS Val shares 70% of its components with its sister-gun, the VSS Vintorez. The differences are a skeletonized steel stock which folds to the left for storage and transportation (the gun can operate with stock folded, but it cannot have a scope while the stock is folded).\nThe reliability of the rifle is said to be equivalent to the AKM. This includes functioning in difficult conditions such as dust, dirt, sand, rain, and at a temperature range from -50 \u00b0C to +50 \u00b0C."}

It is from the southern and midwestern United States and east coast of Mexico. Human beings brought it to many other parts of the world, such as Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Australia, where it has caused problems as an invasive specie. Some scientists say that the western mosquitofish has had the largest effect on the environment of any fish in Poeciliidae.\nThe adult male western mosquitofish grows to 4 cm and the female to 7 cm. It has a round tail fin. It eats algae, insects, and other invertebrates. It can eat more than its own body weight every day. It can live in water that is twice as salty as seawater. It can live in water as hot as 43\u00b0C.\nIn the early 20th century, people brought the western mosquitofish to other places because they thought it would eat mosquitoes and their larvae, but this did not work. Sometimes there were more mosquitoes than before: The western mosquitofish ate, outcompeted or killed other fish that were eating mosquitoes. It sometimes killed fish that were better at controlling mosquitoes than it was. It also ate some of the insects that had been eating the mosquitos and larvae. It also ate zooplankton, which left more food for the mosquito larvae.\nThe western mosquitofish can kill larger fish by attacking their fins and eating their eggs and babies. It eats smaller fish. It likes to eat frog eggs and tadpoles. After people put western mosquitofish in a body of water, there may be an algal bloom because the western mosquitofish eats or kills all the fish that usually eat the algae. The western mosquitofish is one reason why many other species are endangered. Some of the important ones are the Railroad Valley springfish (\"Crenichthys baileyi\") in Nevada, the Sonoran topminnow (\"Poeciliopsis occidentalis\") in Arizona, and the damselfly in Hawaii.\nThe western mosquitofish usually has 60 eggs at a time, but it can have as many as 300 at a time. The eggs stay inside the female's body until they hatch.\nThe western mosquitofish \"G. affinis\" and eastern mosquitofish \"G. holbrooki\" used to both be called \"G. affinis\" because people thought they were the same species. They are not. According to the IUCN Global Invasive Species Database, most records in Australia that say \"G. affinis\" really refer to \"G. holbrooki\"."}

The VSS is a gas-operated select-fire rifle. It has a long-stroke gas piston operating rod in a gas cylinder above the barrel. The weapon catch is held in its place thanks to a rotating bolt who attach themselves to the appropiate socket when needed. The VSS is striker fired.

Russian special forces wear different berets depending on the branch of the armed forces they belong to.\nAs Spetsnaz is a Russian term, it mostly means the special forces of Russia, but other post-Soviet states often refer to their special forces units by the name as well, since these nations also got their special purpose units from the old Soviet security agencies.\nKnown Operation History.\nSecond World War.\nDuring the Second World War, it Soviet forces needed intelligence on German troop positions in northern Norway and Finland. On 5 July 1941 Admiral Arseniy Golovko of the Northern Fleet authorized the formation of a ground spy troop. This unit, the 4th Special Volunteer Detachment, was to be recruited from the fleet's sports-men and had about 65 to 70 personnel. Later the unit was renamed the 181st Special Reconnaissance Detachment. \nThe most prominent of these new recruits was Viktor Leonov, who joined the Soviet Navy in 1937. He was assigned to a submarine training detachment and then moved to a repair station in the Northern Fleet at Polyarnyy. Leonov had trained as a scuba diver, after which he joined 4th Special Volunteer Detachment, where he conducted numerous secret operations and twice being awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.\nInitially the unit was confined to performing small scale reconnaissance missions, platoon sized missions by sea and on occasion on land into Finland and later Norway. They began conducting sabotage missions and raids to snatch prisoners for interrogation. They would also destroy German ammunition and supply posts, communication centers, and harass enemy troop concentrations along the Finnish and Russian coasts.\nWhen the European conflict ended, the Naval Scouts were sent to fight the Japanese. Leonov along with Capt. Kulebyakin and 140 men, landed on a Japanese airfield at Port Vonsan, not realizing they were opposed by over 3,500 enemy soldiers. A tense standoff ensued, until the commanding officers of the unit managed to bluff the Japanese forces into surrendering.\nSoviet War in Afghanistan.\n\"For further details about the Soviet conflict during Afghanistan War see here.\"\nSoviet Spetsnaz forces took part in the Soviet\u2013Afghan War of 1979\u20131989 in Afghanistan, usually fighting battles using helicopters. Their most famous operation, Operation Storm-333, was carried out on 27 December 1979 when Soviet special forces stormed the Tajbeg Palace in Afghanistan and killing Afghan President Hafizullah Amin and his 200 personal guards. The Soviets then installed Babrak Karmal as Amin's successor.\nThe operation involved approximately 660 Soviet operators dressed in Afghan uniforms, including 50 KGB and GRU officers from the \"Alpha Group\" and \"Zenith Group\". The Soviet forces occupied major governmental, military and media buildings in Kabul, including their primary target \u2013 the Tajbeg Palace.\nIn the first one and a half years of the war, Spetsnaz units in the form of the 459th special forces company, were exclusively responsible for recon missions and intelligence gathering for the 40th Army. Aside from reconnaissance, the 459th was also tasked with capturing prisoners, destroying the leaders and field commanders of the Mujahideen.\nBy 1985, the GRU had expanded its special forces footprint to two spetsnaz brigades in Afghanistan, comprising just under 5,000 troops."}

According to historian Mary Beard, no ancient historian who was alive at the same time as Caligula ever said Caligula really made Incitatus a senator, and it is likely that he only told a joke about doing it.\nAncient historians do say Caligula gave his horse many gifts. In 121 c.e., in his book \"The Twelve Caesars\", the historian Suetonius says of Incitatus: \"Besides a stall of marble, a manger of ivory, purple blankets and a collar of precious stones, he even gave this horse a house, a troop of slaves and furniture, for the more elegant entertainment of the guests invited in his name; and it is also said that he planned to make him consul.\"\nIn fiction.\nIn Robert Graves' 1934 book \"I, Claudius\", the fictional Caligula does make the fictional Incitatus a senator and gives him an ivory trough to eat out of. This is one of the ways Graves shows that Caligula has become mentally unstable. After Caligula dies, Claudius treats Incitatus like a normal horse again.\nA talking version of Incitatus appears as a villain in Rick Riordan's 2018 young adult novel \"The Burning Maze\"."}

This resulted in legal action from FMC against Lamborghini in 1977.\nThe Cheetah was built in San Jose, California. After it was built, the prototype was sent to Sant'Agata Bolognese so Lamborghini could put on the finishing touches. The Cheetah was powered by a large, waterproofed 180\u00a0bhp 5.9L Chrysler engine, rear mounted, with a 3 speed automatic transmission. The mounting of the engine in the rear gave the Cheetah very poor steering, and the engine was not powerful enough for the Cheetah. This resulted in poor performance overall.\nThe only finished prototype was never tested by the US military. It was later sold to Teledyne Continental Motors, and it still exists today. \nLamborghini eventually developed the Lamborghini LM002.

The author makes a case against tabula rasa (people who believe we are all born with no built in mental content). The book was voted for the 2003 Aventis Prizes and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize.\nSummary.\nPinker says that modern science has challenged three linked ideas that make up the main view of human nature in intelligent life:\nMuch of the book is looking at fears of the social and political consequences of his view of human nature:\nPinker says that the blank slate view of human nature would actually be more of a threat if it were true. For example, he argues that political equality does not require similarity, but policies that treat people as individuals with rights; that moral progress doesn't need the human mind to be naturally free of selfish actions, only morals to counteract them are needed; that responsibility doesn't need behavior to be uncaused, only that it answers to praise and blame; and that meaning in life doesn't. the process that created the brain must have a purpose, only that the brain itself must have purposes. He also argues that grounding ideals in claims about a blank slate opens them to the possibility of being overturned by future discoveries. He further states that a blank slate is in fact not in-sequence with opposition to many social evils since a blank slate could be conditioned to enjoy slavery.\nEvolutionary and genetic inequality statements do not have to support right-wing policies. Pinker writes that if everyone is equal regarding abilities it can be argued that it is only necessary to give everyone equal opportunity. On the other hand, if some people have less innate ability, then redistribution policies should favor those with less innate ability. Further, economics is built upon an assumption of an actor, while evolutionary psychology suggests that people have many different goals and behaviors that do not fit the actor theory. \"A rising tide lifts all boats\" is often used as an argument that inequality need not be reduced as long as there is growth. Evolutionary psychology suggests that low status itself, apart from material considerations, is highly stressful towards the brain and may cause dangerous behaviors, which suggests that inequalities should be reduced. Finally, evolutionary explanations may also help the left create policies with greater public support, suggesting that people's sense of fairness (caused by mechanisms such as reciprocal altruism) rather than greed is a primary cause of opposition to welfare, if there is not a distinction in the proposals between what is perceived as the deserving and the undeserving poor."}

It has sometimes been seen in northwestern Australia, far from its natural range. Citizen scientists from Frogwatch SA think this is because people keep Peron's tree frogs as pets and then they either escape or are set free. This frog is usually gray-green during the day. It turns red-brown with green spots at night. It has black and yellow colouring on its legs. It looks very similar to Tyler's tree frog. Scientists tell them apart because their voices sound different.\nThis frog lays eggs in temporary bodies of water. The tadpoles are yellow with stripes."}
{"id": "771857", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=771857", "title": "Reassortment", "text": "Reassortment is mixing of the genetic material of a species into new combinations in different individuals. \nThere are several ways this happens. The term is used when two similar viruses infecting the same cell exchange genetic material. In particular, reassortment occurs among influenza viruses. Their genomes have eight segments of RNA. These segments act like mini-chromosomes: each time a flu virus is assembled, it needs one copy of each segment.\nA single host (a human, a chicken, or other animal) may be infected by two different strains of the influenza virus. Then it is possible that new assembled viral particles will be made from segments whose origin is mixed, some coming from one strain and some coming from another. The new reassorted strain will share properties from both parental lineages.\nReassortment is responsible for some of the major changes in the history of the influenza virus. The 1957 and 1968 pandemic flu strains were caused by reassortment between an avian virus and a human virus. The H1N1 virus responsible for the 2009 swine flu pandemic has an unusual mix of swine, avian and human influenza genetic sequences.\nThere are other examples, but this is enough to indicate why reassortment causes such dangerous illness. \nIf any of a virus\u2019s genome segments is damaged in such a way as to prevent replication or expression of an essential gene, the virus is inviable when it, alone, infects a host cell (single infection). However when two or more damaged viruses infect the same cell (multiple infection), the infection may succeed due to reassortment of segments. Each of the eight genome segments may be present in at least one undamaged copy."}

Aristophanes at the beginning of his next play The Acharnians said he would have revenge on Cleon. Aristophanes also wrote a comedy called The Knights to try and convince the people not to re-elect Cleon and another called The Wasps about Cleon being a populist.\nAccording to Aristotle, Cleon was the first one who would shout down anyone who disagreed with him and accuse any and all opponents of being essentially traitors to \u2018the people\u2019 and who did everything he could to convince the people that the only way for them to have power was to let him do what he wanted even if it were against the Constitution."}

It lasted 78 days and led to the death of one person. The Oka Crisis is a well-known example of violent conflict between a First Nations group and the Canadian government.\nBackground.\nThe Mohawk people were in the Montreal area starting from the 1700s. In 1717, some land in the Montreal region was given to the Roman Catholic Church to use as a seminary. Part of this land included a Mohawk burial site. In 1868, Joseph Onasakenrat, a leader of the Mohawk, wrote a letter to the seminary that said that part of the land was meant for the Mohawk people to use. A year later, he and some other Mohawk attacked the seminary but were unable to get the land in the end.\nIn 1936, the seminary sold off the land the Mohawk claimed was theirs.\nIn 1959, the town of Oka let a golf course be built on part of the disputed land. The Mohawk filed a lawsuit but it didn't go through.\nIn 1977, a group of Mohawk called the Kanehsat\u00e0:ke band filed a land claim with the Office of Native Claims. By filing a land claim, they wanted to be accepted as the owners of the land. They were unable to successfully file a claim.\nIn 1989, the golf club said they wanted to expand the golf course. The Mohawk people protested and took the club to court.\nIn 1990, the court approved of the expansion of the golf course.\nCrisis.\nThe Mohawk set up barricades so that no one could get to the golf course. The mayor of Oka, Jean Ouellette, told them to get off but they refused.\nOn July 11, Mayor Ouellette called the Quebec provincial police to the town.\nEnd of Crisis.\nAlthough the Mohawk did not get the land, the golf course was not expanded."}

They are also concerned about the amount of sexual harassment occurring in army ranks. Many past soldiers have used the hashtag #IAmVanessaGuillen to tell their stories about being harassed and assaulted.\nThere have been many protests demanding that Vanessa be found and brought back to her family.

It lives in the Foja Mountains in Indonesia.\nThis frog is green, brown and yellow in color. The male frog has a point on the end of its nose. The point can get bigger or smaller at different times, but scientists do not know exactly why.\nScientists saw that the point on the male frog's nose becomes bigger while the male frog is singing, so they think it might be part of impressing female frogs. Other scientists think it makes it easier for Pinocchio frogs to recognize other Pinocchio frogs and tell them apart from other frogs that look similar and live in the same place.\nThe Pinocchio frog is named after the fictional character Pinocchio, a puppet whose nose becomes bigger whenever he tells a lie. Scientists have known the Pinocchio frog existed since at least 2008. It was first formally described, meaning scientists wrote the first scientific paper about it, in 2019."}
{"id": "772167", "revid": "196884", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=772167", "title": "Vomitoxin", "text": "Vomitoxin is a group name for many natural poisons made by fungi from the genus \"Fusarium\". These fungi grow on grains, such as wheat, rice, barley, and corn. The vomitoxin can stay in the grain. Things made out of the grain, such as flour, beer, or other food, may have vomitoxin in them. If humans or other animals eat the food, they can become sick with vomiting, dizziness, pain, and other problems. These problems usually stop after some time.\nChemistry.\nThere are more than 140 different vomitoxins. The three most common are deoxynivalenol, nivalenol, and T-2 toxin.\nDeoxynivalenol does not break apart when it gets hot. It can be cooked at 350\u00b0C and still stay a poison. Some forms of cooking, like boiling, do help against deoxynivalenol. This is because the deoxynivalenol moves out of the grain into the water, and the water is thrown away.\nScientists believe that deoxynivalenol does not cause cancer.\nIn animals.\nAnimals that eat grain or other food with vomitoxin in it usually do not die, but they do usually eat less. That makes them grow less.\nAnimals that eat grain that has vomitoxin in it can have the vomitoxin stay in their bodies. Chickens fed vomitoxin lay eggs with vomitoxin in them. Pigs fed vomitoxin have meat with vomitoxin in it. Cows fed vomitoxin give milk with vomitoxin in it. However, there is usually less vomitoxin in the animal product than in the grain that the animal ate.\nStopping vomitoxin.\nVomitoxin and the fungi that make it cost farmers money. According to Alberta Agriculture and Rural Development, \"Fusifarum\" in wheat and other crops cost C$50 million to $300 million each year in Canada alone from 1994 to 2014.\nFarmers can do several things to prevent vomitoxin from getting into food. They can use crop rotation, plant seeds that have been checked to have no \"Fusarium\" in them, plant types of crops that are strong against \"Fusarium\", and put fungicide on the crops to kill the fungus. Because fungal infections make the crop plants smaller and lighter, sometimes farmers can use combine harvesters to blow air on the crops so that the infected wheat blows away leaving the heavier healthy wheat behind."}

He was wearing no underwear and had a pack of matches in his pocket from a \"Grant's Truck Stop\". This truck stop is thought to be in the Midwestern United States. He also had a ring on with the letters \"JPF\" written on the inside. This could refer to his initials James Paul Freund.\nThe female victim, Pamela Buckley, was thought to be younger than the male one, aged between 18 and 25 years old before her name was known. It was later found out that Buckley was 24 years old. She had reddish-brown hair down to her shoulders and blue or gray eyes. She had two moles on the left of her face. She had no scars and had never been pregnant. She also had not shaved her legs. She was wearing a white muslin blouse over a pink halter top. She also wore blue denim cut-off shorts. She had purple and pink Stride-Rite brand wedge-heeled sandals. Like the male victim, she was wearing no underwear.\nPictures, drawings and photographs of the pair were spread all around the U.S.. DNA testing found that they were not related to each other in 2007. in 2014, Police paused the investigation until it was known who the pair were.\nThey were buried in graves marked \"Male Unknown\" and \"Female Unknown\" at the Bethel United Methodist Church Cemetery in Oswego, South Carolina on August 14, 1977.

Borysovycha was touched at how full of motion the music of Mykoly Hirshovycha was, what he could do with the piano, deeply respected and loved his student.\nFor some time, Kapustin dreamed of becoming a super good pianist and performing classic pieces, but not on big stages, but in a more cozy place or recording in studios. But at about the age of 20, the pianist started to like in jazz.\nIn 1957, the Orchestra of the Central House of Artists and Kapustin played at the VI International Festival of Youth and Students, which was in Moscow. At that time, the festival had 34,000 people in it who stood for 131 countries. The festival was the biggest ever. And it was here, on the world stage, that Kapustin had his work played for the first time, the Concertino for piano and orchestra (which he wrote in the same year). It was then that the composer found his style in the natural mix of classical structure mixed with jazz improvisations (making up things you play), harmonies, rhythms, chords, etc.\nNot only did he learn at the big school, Kapustin played with a small jazz band in high types of restaurants for people who were not Ukrainians. One of these light concerts was recorded and later on the radio \"Voice of America\" began to play it again.\nIn 1961 Kapustin left the Moscow Conservatory.\nBetween the years 1961\u20131972, he worked together with Oleha Lundstrema's orchestra. During his work with the orchestra, it turned out that Kapustin was very good pianist who practiced a lot and a very great composer, writing a number of new works.\nIn 1972\u20131977, he was pianist of the Blue Screen Orchestra. He also played in the State Symphony Orchestra of Cinematography of Ukraine.\nThe end of the 70's was Kapustin's change from playing to writing different types and lots of music. He wrote many works of many different forms for orchestra and piano alone.\nHis works were published with the help of Stivena Osborna and Mykola Petrov. Kapustin's piano pieces were added in the set of works and recorded by Mark-Andre Amlen, Mykola Petrov and others. And so was why Kapustin's music all around the world. The composer himself has again and again recorded very good playing his own works.\nOn December 11, 2007, a concert for the composer's work was held in Moscow. Kapustin was there. March 8, 2009 in the Chamber Hall of the Moscow Conservatory was a concert of his works, which he also went to, who answered many questions from fans of his work."}

The island was also called San Juan Bautista and Elizabeth Island in the past. With Pitcairn, Oeno and Ducie Islands it forms the Pitcairn Island Group.\nIt is one of the world's last two raised coral atolls whose ecosystems remain relatively unaffected by human contact. A 2017 survey found a large amount of plastic debris on its beaches. Ten of its 51 flowering plants, all four of its land birds and about a third of the identified insects and gastropods are endemic \u2013 a remarkable diversity given the island's size.\nThe island is small: it measures by . It has an area of . It is located northeast of Pitcairn Island. It has poor soil and little fresh water. This makes it unsuitable for agriculture. There are three beaches on the northern end. The rest of the coast is made of steep cliffs up to in height.\nIn 1902 Henderson was added to the Pitcairn Islands colony. The Pitcairn Islands are a South Pacific British Overseas Territory. United Nations made it a World Heritage Site by the in 1988.\nHistory.\nArchaeological evidence suggests that a small permanent Polynesian settlement existed on Henderson at some time between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries. The reasons, why the group disappeared from the island are unknown. At about the same time, Polynesians also left Pitcairn Island. The group on Henderson would have depended on the group on Pitcairn for many things of daily life; there's no stone suitable for making tools on Henderson. The Pitcairn Polynesians may in turn have disappeared because of the decline of nearby Mangareva; Henderson was at the end of a chain of small, dependent colonies of Mangareva.\nOn 29 January 1606, Portuguese captain Pedro Fernandes de Queir\u00f3s, was the first European to see the island, and named it \"San Juan Bautista\". He was leading a Spanish expedition at the time. Captain Henderson of the British East India Company ship \"Hercules\" rediscovered the island on 17 January 1819. Thomas Raine (1793-1860), master of the ship \"Surry\" of London, had called it \"Henderson's Island\" as it appeared to him from the conversation he had with James Henderson at Valparaiso to be his discovery on his last voyage to India from that port in the ship \"Hercules\". On 2 March 1819, Captain Henry King, in the \"Elizabeth\", landed on the island to find the king's colors already flying. His crew scratched the name of their ship into a tree.\nA sperm whale rammed and sank the Nantucket whaleship Essex on 20\u00a0November 1820. The crew arrived at Henderson on 20\u00a0December in three small whaleboats. They found the island's only known drinkable water-source \u2013 a brackish spring on the north shore, exposed at half tide \u2013 and ate fish, birds, eggs, crabs and peppergrass, but they had largely exhausted the available food within a week. On 27 December the three boats set sail for South America, leaving behind Thomas Chappel, Seth Weeks, and William Wright, who chose to stay. They survived until their rescue on 9 April 1821. In his account of the ordeal, Chappel reported having seen human skeletons in a cave. The report of sperm whale ramming the ship may have inspired Herman Melville to write \"Moby-Dick\"\nIn August 1851, visitors from Pitcairn Island also found skeletons in a cave and wreckage on the beach next to the cave. After a party of Pitcairn Islanders collecting miro wood rediscovered the skeletons in March 1958, a medical examination determined that the bones were of Caucasian origin, and they were then buried in a shallow grave inside the cave. An American survey team examined the bones in 1966 and buried them in five coffins in the left-hand corner of the cave, tightly jamming a large cross between the ceiling and the rock floor at the entrance. They concluded the remains were of five or six people, one of whom was between three and five years of age. It was presumed they were the survivors of a shipwreck who died of dehydration.\nA final examination in the context of a scientific expedition in 1991 concluded that the human remains on Henderson Island were prehistoric Polynesians.\nIn 1902, Henderson Island, along with Oeno and Ducie islands, was formally annexed to the British Empire by Captain G. F. Jones, who visited the islands in a cutter with a crew of Pitcairn Islanders. In August 1937, HMS Leander, on a journey from Europe to New Zealand, carried out an aerial survey of Henderson, Oeno and Ducie, and on each island, a British flag was planted and an inscription was nailed up proclaiming: \"This island belongs to H.B.M. King George VI.\" \nIn 1957, a 27-year-old American, Robert Tomarchin, lived the life of a castaway on the island for approximately 2\u00a0months, accompanied by a pet chimpanzee, apparently as a publicity stunt, until people from Pitcairn rescued him in two longboats.\nIn the early 1980s, conservative American businessman Arthur \"Smiley\" Ratliff expressed interest in establishing a mansion for himself on the island, with an airstrip. The Pitcairn Island Council approved his plans but, after environmentalists lobbied to protect the natural ecology and environment of the island, the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office overrode the decision and vetoed the proposed development. Henderson Island was listed as a World Heritage Site in 1988.\nNatural resources.\nSince the introduction of aluminum-hulled long-boats in the 20th century, Pitcairners have made regular trips to Henderson to harvest the wood of \"miro\" and tou trees. Usually, they go to Henderson once per year, but they may make up to three trips if the weather is favourable. Pitcairners carve the wood into curios for tourists, from which they get much of their income.\nGeography.\nHenderson Island is a raised coral atoll. With Pitcairn, Ducie and Oeno islands, forms the Pitcairn Island Group. The nearest major landmass is more than away. This coral limestone island sits atop a conical (presumed volcanic) mound, rising from a depth of roughly . Its surface is mostly reef-rubble and dissected limeston. Except for the north end, the island is encircled by steep limestone cliffs up to high.\nThere are three main beaches, on the northwest, north, and northeast shores. The north and northwest beaches are on the border of reefs. The depression at the island's center is thought to be a raised lagoon. There is onlly one known source of drinking water on the island: a brackish spring on the north shore exposed at half tide, rising from a crevice in flat rock, large surfaces of which compose the face of the beach. The surrounding ocean tidal range is about one meter at spring tide.\nFlora.\nApart from five species bordering the beaches, including coconut palms, the vegetation is undisturbed. Henderson Island is covered by 5\u201310\u00a0m tall tangled scrub forest. There is less forest in the central depression. It has 51 native species of flowering plants, ten of which are unique to the island (endemic). Dominant tree species include coconut palms, \"Pandanus tectorius\",\" Thespesia populnea\" (miro), \"Tournefortia argentea\", \"Cordia subcordata\" (tou), \"Guettarda speciosa\", \"Pisonia grandis\", \"Geniostoma hendersonense\", \"Nesoluma st.-johnianum\", \"Hernandia stokesii\", \"Myrsine hosakae\", and \"Celtis sp.\"\nFauna.\nBirds.\nThe island is presently home to four endemic land bird species \u2013 the Henderson fruit dove, Henderson lorikeet, Henderson reed warbler and the flightless Henderson crake. Three species of the family Columbidae were formerly endemic to the island. They became extinct when the Polynesians arrived around 1000 CE. Of the fifteen non-endemic seabird species found, nine or more probably breed on the island. Breeding colonies of the globally endangered Henderson petrel formerly existed on Ducie but were wiped out by invasive rats by 1922. It is believed to now nest uniquely on Henderson island.\nBones of birds have been found near the prehistoric settlements. These settlements existed 500 to 800 years ago. The bones found include those of two species of bird that still visit the island, but do not nest there: The Christmas shearwater and red-footed booby. There are alos bones of four bird species that can no longer be found on the island at all. Polynesian settlers may have driven these bird species, along with six terrestrial snail species to extinction on the island. This loss of a ready and regular food supply may have contributed to the Polynesians' disappearance. The island has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area for its endemic landbirds and breeding seabirds.\nOther animals.\nThe invertebrate species are largely unknown but a third of the island's known non-marine gastropods and insects are endemic. There are no native mammals but the Pacific rat, introduced by Polynesians 800 years ago, abounds. A skink and the green sea turtle have been identified, and an unidentified gecko has been reported. There are also crabs.\nBiological risk.\nLand bird populations appear to be relatively stable. The big problem is that when yachts land on the island without authorization, they introduce new predators, disease vectors or diseases. Introduction of the Eurasian black rat or the domestic cat would be likely to cause almost immediate extinction of the ground-dwelling Henderson crake and possibly other species. The endemic birds may have no immunity to the fatal avian pox which is transmitted by biting flies.\nBetween July and November 2011 a partnership of the Pitcairn Islands Government and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds stareted a program to eradicate the Pacific rat using poison. The program was very successful. Before the program, between 50.000 and 100.000 rats lived on the island. The poison killed almost alll of them. Between 60 and 80 rats survived and the population has now fully recovered.\nPlastic debris.\nResearch published in April 2017 looked at debris on several beaches, and reported \"the highest density of plastic rubbish anywhere in the world\" as a result of the South Pacific Gyre. The beaches contain an estimated 37.7 million items of debris. There weight is estimated at 17.6 tonnes. When a study was done on North Beach, each day 17 to 268 new items washed up on a 10-meter section of the beach. The study noted that purple hermit crabs make their homes in plastic containers washed up on beaches; the debris may reduce shoreline gastropod diversity, may contribute to a reduction in the number of sea turtle laying attempts and may increase the risk of entanglement for coastal-nesting seabirds."}

It most common among certain groups of Protestant Christians. It is also known as prosperity gospel, the health and wealth gospel, the gospel of success, or seed faith. These groups also believe that faith, positive speech, and donations to religious causes will increase one's material wealth. Prosperity theology sees the Bible as a contract between God and humans: if humans have faith in God, he will deliver security and prosperity.\nThe doctrine says that it is God's will for his people to be blessed. The atonement is interpreted to include the healing of sickness and lessening of poverty. Both are curses that can be broken by faith. This is believed to be achieved through donations of money, visualization, and positive confession.\nGroups in favor of prosperity theology started in the United States in the 1950s. The origins may go back to a movement callled New Thought, which started in the 19th century. The basic ideas were important for another movement, called Word of Faith. In the 1980s televangelism was sometimes successful because of these ideas. In the 1990s and 2000s, prosperity theology was adopted by influential leaders in the Pentecostal Movement and Charismatic Movement in the United States and has spread throughout the world. Prominent leaders in the development of prosperity theology include E.&amp;nbsp;W. Kenyon, Oral Roberts, A.&amp;nbsp;A. Allen, Robert Tilton, T.&amp;nbsp;L. Osborn, Joel Osteen, Creflo Dollar,[8] Kenneth Copeland, Reverend Ike, and Kenneth Hagin. \nLeaders from other Christian novements have critiziced prosperity theology: They say that it is irresponsible, promotes idolatry, and is contrary to scripture. Secular as well as some Christian observers have also criticized prosperity theology: They say it exploits the poor. The practices of some preachers have attracted scandal and some have been charged with financial fraud.\nNotable works in favor of prosperity theology.\nNotable works that advocate prosperity theology include:[8]"}

The Tongva lived in shelters called \"kiches\". The \"kiche\" was dome-shaped. The frame was made of willow branches and was covered with mats made with reeds, grasses, or animal hides. The Tongva lived in villages with as many as 400\u2013500 \"kiches\". A chief lived in the largest \"kiche\" and had almost total authority over the village.

The KOOM part rhymes with loom and the yai part rhymes with pie. Some people pronounce Kumeyaay in three syllables and add an extra \"uh\" between KOOM and yai.\nThe Kumeyaay were also called Diegue\u00f1o, which is a Spanish word that comes from Mission San Diego.

Now, most of them speak English and Spanish.\nHistory.\nIn the 1760s, the Spanish came onto Kumeyaay land. They wanted to teach the Kumeyaay about the Christian religion and the European lifestyle. To do that, they built the Mission San Diego, which was a church, a school, and a village.all in one. However, the Kumeyaay did not like being told what to do. In 1775, the Kumeyaay fought the Spanish at Mission San Diego. They set some buildings on fire and killed a priest.\nWhen the Kumeyaay land became part of Mexico, there was no one to send money to the missions to keep them running so the Kumeyaay left.\nWhen part of Kumeyaay land became part of the United States, the Kumeyaay were sent to live on certain pieces of land called reservations. Many of these reservations now have casinos so that the Kumeyaay people can make money.\nReligion.\nMost Kumeyaay are now Catholic. Many parts of their old religion were forgotten when they became Catholic. However, they still remember some parts.\nIn the traditional Kumeyaay religion, a dead person's soul must cross a deep gorge in order to get to heaven."}

{"id": "772459", "revid": "1108895", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=772459", "title": "Navajo language", "text": "The Navajo language (Navajo: \"Din\u00e9 Bizaad\") is a Southern Athabaskan language that is spoken in the United States, specifically in the Navajo Nation (in the states of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah). It is the most widely spoken Native American language in the US and the most spoken Indigenous language in the Americas north of the US-Mexico border. In 2011, almost 170,000 Americans spoke Navajo at home. Navajo is famous for being used by the Navajo Code Talkers during World War II. \nCompared to many other languages, the Navajo language has a lot of sounds, including many that are not found in the English language. Navajo is also a tonal language, like Chinese, which means that pitch is used to make words different from each other. English is not a tonal language. For these reasons and many more, many English speakers find it difficult to learn Navajo.\nIn Navajo, new words are made by adding prefixes and suffixes to a part of a word called the stem. These prefixes and suffixes add meaning, such as tense, who is doing the action, and so on. In Navajo, sentences are arranged as subject-object-verb although they can be arranged in other ways too.\nNavajo does not have a lot of loanwords from other languages.\nThe Navajo language is written with the Latin alphabet, just like English. The current alphabet was developed in the 1930s. Before this, the Navajo did not have their own alphabet.\nName.\nThe Navajo do not call themselves or their language \"Navajo.\" The word \"Navajo\" is from the Tewa word \"Navahu\", which means \"large field\" (\"nava\" \"field\" + \"hu\" \"valley\"). The Tewa are another group of Native Americans and speak their own language. That Tewa word eventually made it into the Spanish language, where it referred to an area in New Mexico. That Spanish word then was used in English to refer to the Navajo people, who live in New Mexico.\nThe Navajo call themselves \"Din\u00e9\", which means \"people.\" They call their language \"Din\u00e9 bizaad\" (\"people's language). They also call their language \"Naabeeh\u00f3 bizaad,\" which is based on the word \"Navajo.\"\nClassification.\nNavajo is part of the Athabaskan language family. A language family is a group of languages that are related to each other and come from a common ancestor language. For example, English is part of the Indo-European language family because it has a lot of similarities with languages spoken in Europe, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent. Navajo is one of the most southernmost Athabaskan languages. Other Athabaskan languages are spoken in Alaska and on the Pacific coast.\nLike many other Athabaskan languages, Navajo has tones. However, the tones evolved independently in different languages. For example, what is a \"high\" tone in Navajo is a \"low\" tone in other Athabaskan languages and vice versa.\nThe Western Apache language is the language that is most closely related to Navajo. They share a lot of the same tones and a lot of words. Navajo is similar to other Apachean language.\nHistory.\nThe ancestors of the Navajo are thought to have come from the northern US and Canada, because other Athabaskan languages are spoken in those places. Archaeologists think that the Navajo came to the Southwest by 1500.\nStarting in the 1800s, the Spanish colonized the Navajo territory as part of Mexico. Then the US took over the area after the Mexican-American war. After that, American settlers came and set up schools to teach the Navajo about English and Christianity. They did not allow the Navajo to use their language in order to make them learn English. Children were forced to wash out their mouths with soap if teachers found them speaking Navajo. Because of this, many parents were afraid to teach their children the language.\nRobert W. Young and William Morgan (Navajo) were two men who worked for the Bureau of Indian Affairs. They created a single alphabet for the Navajo language. Before then, there were many alphabets used to write down the Navajo language.\nA white American man who lived with the Navajo recommended that the language be used as a code language during World War II. Back then, there were no Navajo dictionaries and very few non-Navajo spoke the language. Also, the Navajo language is very different from German and Japanese, the languages of the enemies at the time. The military started to recruit Navajo men to become code talkers. These code talkers sent code messages in Navajo. The code talkers used very specific words for military words (such as \"iron fish\" for submarine) so that even other Navajo would have a hard time understanding if they didn't learn the meanings of those terms. The Japanese found out they were speaking Navajo because a professor who studied Native American languages recognized it, but they could not understand the words of the code. There were other code talkers in other Native American and non-Native American languages, but the Navajo Code Talkers were the most famous.\nAfter World War II, the Navajo language began to decline. More roads were built into Navajo land, which exposed them more to English. However, things began to change in the 1960s. President Johnson signed a law that said that kids who don't speak English are allowed to have bilingual education. That was when the Navajo began to open up schools that taught in both English and Navajo.\nToday, Navajo is considered to be a language in trouble because more and more of the Navajo now speak English only. However, people are working to change it by speaking and writing in Navajo and teaching the language to other people.\nGrammar.\nIn Navajo, new words are created by putting prefixes in front of other words.\nNavajo is called a subject-object-verb language. This means that the subject is first and the verb is last (\"I you love\"). This is different from English, which is a subject-verb-object language (\"I love you\").\nVerbs.\nVerbs (action words) are the most important part of Navajo grammar. Every sentence needs a verb. Each verb is composed of a root, with additional prefixes and suffixes attached to form a word.\nNouns.\nNouns are people, places, and things. They are not as important in Navajo. Many nouns are created by adding certain prefixes and suffixes to verbs. \nUnlike in some other languages, Navajo nouns do not have grammatical gender. They also do not change in the plural (unlike English, which usually adds the suffix -s to indicate plural nouns). \nNavajo nouns are organized as animate (people, plants, and animals) or inanimate (everything else).\nIn the Navajo language, possession is not indicated by 's or words such as my. Instead, prefixes are added to the beginning of words. (Example: chid\u00ed 'car' - shichid\u00ed 'my car')\nAdjectives.\nNavajo does not have adjectives. Verbs play the role of adjectives.\nNumbers.\nThe Navajo words for million (miiltsoh), billion (biny\u00f3\u00f3n), and other large numbers are based on English.\nDays of the Week.\nThe Navajo borrowed the 7-day week from the Spanish. The first day of the week is Sunday, which is \"Dam\u00f3o\". This comes from the Spanish word for Sunday, \"Domingo\".\nLetters.\nThe Navajo language uses the ABCs, just like English. Before, the Navajo language had no writing system. As missionaries came, they made up their own alphabets. However, some linguists came up with a single alphabet that represented the sounds of Navajo well. This alphabet has lots of extra letters and marks so that all the sounds of the Navajo language can be written correctly.\nBelow is a chart of all the Navajo letters.\nVowels.\nThe hooks underneath the letters are called ogoneks and represent nasal vowels. Nasal vowels are not found in English, but they are found in languages like French and Portuguese.\nHigh tones are represented with a mark called an acute accent, such as \u00e1.\nDouble letters lengthen the vowels so that they are said a bit longer than just one letter.\nSample text.\nNavajo: \"Ashiik\u00e9 t\u02bc\u00f3\u00f3 diigis l\u00e9i\u02bc t\u00f3\u0142ikan\u00ed \u0142a\u02bc \u00e1diiln\u00ed\u00ed\u0142 d\u00f3\u00f3 nihaa nahidoonih n\u00edigo yee hodeez\u02bc\u0105\u0301 jin\u00ed. \u00c1ko t\u02bc\u00e1\u00e1 a\u0142\u02bc\u0105\u0105 ch\u02bcil na\u02bcat\u0142\u02bco\u02bcii k\u02bciidiil\u00e1 d\u00f3\u00f3 h\u00e1\u00e1hg\u00f3\u00f3sh\u012f\u0301\u012f\u0301 yinaalnishgo t\u02bc\u00e1\u00e1 \u00e1\u0142ah ch\u02bcil na\u02bcat\u0142\u02bco\u02bcii n\u00e9ineest\u02bc\u0105\u0301 jin\u00ed. \u00c1\u00e1d\u00f3\u00f3 t\u00f3\u0142ikan\u00ed \u00e1yiilaago t\u02bc\u00e1\u00e1 b\u00edh\u00edg\u00ed\u00ed t\u02bc\u00e1\u00e1 a\u0142\u02bc\u0105\u0105 t\u0142\u02bc\u00edz\u00edk\u00e1g\u00ed yii\u02bc haid\u00e9\u00e9\u0142b\u012f\u012fd jin\u00ed. \"H\u00e1adida d\u00ed\u00ed t\u00f3\u0142ikan\u00ed y\u00edg\u00ed\u00ed doo \u0142a\u02bc aha\u02bcdiidzi\u0142 da,\" n\u00edigo aha\u02bcdeet\u02bc\u0105\u0301 jin\u00ed\u02bc. \u00c1\u00e1d\u00f3\u00f3 baa nahidoonih biniiy\u00e9 kintahg\u00f3\u00f3 dah yidii\u0142jid jin\u00ed\u02bc ...\"\nEnglish: Some crazy boys decided to make some wine to sell, so they each planted grapevines and, working hard on them, they raised them to maturity.

In 2012, the rat mascot was rebranded into a mouse.\nPizza Time Theatre era.\nThe character was first created as the mascot for a restaurant made by Nolan Bushnell (founder of Atari) in 1977. Bushnell went to the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA) conference in Orlando and saw walk-around character costumes being sold. In them, Bushnell found one that looked like a coyote, so he bought it for his planned Coyote Pizza restaurant. When the costume arrived at Atari, the costume was actually a rat, with a long pink rat tail. Bushnell decided to change the restaurant's name to Rick Rat's Pizza. However, Bushnell's planning group thought that a rat for the name of a restaurant would not be appropriate. Finally, Bushnell's group decided on the name Chuck E. Cheese for the mascot and changed the restaurant's name to Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre. The first Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatre opened in San Jose, California, in the same year Chuck E. Cheese was made, 1977.\nChuck E. Cheese's era: 1995-present.\nIn 1995, the mascot was given a more child-friendly makeover, with wider cheeks, a less pointy, shorter snout, longer eyes and smaller ears. This one was added to the restaurants in 2001.\nIn July 2012, the mascot was changed into a much smaller kind of the character, who played electric guitar. Voice actor Duncan Brannan, who for 19 years had made Chuck E. Cheese a wise-cracking mouse from New Jersey, was replaced with Jaret Reddick, the frontman and guitarist for the pop punk band Bowling for Soup."}

With this setup, he discovered that only a slight change of the values he used for the model could lead to totally different results. This is known as Butterfly effect. In numerical weather predicion, values are often rounded, so that in each step, a small error is added.\nHe also discovered and developed the mathematical foundations.

The programme spans eight series and 53 episodes, including a pilot episode. \nThe ongoing racial conflict between the husbands of the two couples is the main underlying theme of the programme, with the white husband perceived as more bigoted and ignorant.

He is a bigoted person and his racial slurs are aimed mainly at Bill. He often describes Bill as a \"nig nog\", \"Sambo\" and '\"King Kong\".

He often asserts that all blacks (and Bill in particular) are cannibals and claims that \"the white man always takes precedence over the black man\".\nJoan Booth (Kate Williams) is Eddie's wife. She is more tolerant towards her neighbours. In fact, she gets very on well with Barbie, Bill's wife, and they are often seen together discussing the animosities between their husbands.\nBill Reynolds (Rudolph Walker) is a supporter of West Ham United. Whenever Eddie tries to outdo him, Bill usually ends up having the last laugh and rarely gets his comeuppance. He tends to have a very short temper, especially where Eddie's concerned and has threatened him with a clenched fist several times. Although more sophisticated and educated compared to Eddie, Bill is also stubborn and is more than capable of using insulting phrases as he occasionally refers to Eddie as a \"white honky\" and \"snowflake\", and does not like catching Eddie staring at his wife. He also has a very high-pitched laugh. Bill was promoted to foreman at the end of the episode \"Clarky Leaves\". His catchphrases include \"Hey, honky!\", \"Cobblers!\" and \"You talking to me, snowflake?\".\nBarbie Reynolds (Nina Baden-Semper) is Bill's wife. Barbie and her next-door neighbour, Joan Booth, instantly strike up a friendship that carries on throughout the series, and the two women are often seen drinking tea or eating or getting caught up in their antagonistic husbands' latest row. Eddie is sometimes fascinated by her, as in the pilot episode when she bends over while wearing hot pants. She and Joan both become pregnant at the end of Series 3, with Barbie giving birth to a son, Terry. Unlike other characters, she does not have any catchphrases.\nOther main cast members are Jacko Robinson (Keith Marsh) and Arthur Thomas (Tommy Godfrey) who are often seen with Eddie and Bill in their local bar. Jacko's catchphrase \"I'll 'ave half\", meaning a half of bitter, became a popular catchphrase."}

The female is 3.0 to 3.6 cm long.\nThis frog can live in swamps near the coast up to rainforests in the mountains. Scientists say people can tell whether a frog is a revealed frog by looking at it because it has much larger discs at the ends of its toes than other frogs do and because it sometimes has black spots on its middle. People can tell it apart from other frogs by listening to it because its voice is around 4 Hz. It has long legs and a stripe from its nose to each armpit. It is cream-brown or red-brown in colour. It may have orange on its legs.\nScientists knew this frog existed in at least the 1960s, but it was first formally described, meaning scientists wrote the first formal paper about it, in 1982.\nIt lays its eggs in still water.\nThis frog is not endangered but people do damage its habitat by removing trees and bringing cows there to eat the grass."}

The kind of weapon the military wanted was a gun that would be more powerful and accurate than the M1911, but shorter and lighter than the M1 Garand. The M1 Garand was too long and heavy for support troops to carry, especially since combat was not their main job.\nEven though the M1 carbine looks similar to the M1 Garand, the two guns are actually very different. First, the M1 carbines bullets, the .30 Carbine, are much smaller and lighter than the Garand's .30-06 bullets. Second, the gun itself is much lighter, smaller, and shorter range than the Garand. The M1 carbine weighs less than half of the Garand. Third, the M1 carbine is loaded with box magazines that holds 15 bullets, while the M1 Garand is loaded with clips that hold 8 bullets.\nEven though it is not used by the military anymore, it is still popular with civilians.\nThe M2 carbine is a selective fire version of the M1, which means it can switch between semi-automatic and full automatic fire."}

It is a subspecies of the leopard cat (\"Prionailurus bengalensis\"). In Japanese, people call it \"yamaneko\", or \"mountain cat.\"\nThis cat is a little larger than a domestic cat, with rounder ears and spots where a tabby cat would have stripes.\nThese cats live in forests and on hills with streams. They have been seen on beaches. They can climb trees and swim. There are almost no small mammals on Iriomote Island, so the cats cannot eat mice or other rodents the way wildcats in other places do. They eat many different kinds of things, for example insects, lizards, fish, and shrimp.\nThe females give birth to 1-4 kittens at a time in dens in trees or in crevices in rocks. People have seen kittens as young as three months living on their own. Scientists think it takes 10-12 months for them to become adults.\nEcologist Masako Izawa of the University of the Ryukyus in Okinawa said she thinks there are fewer than 1000 Iromote cats in the wild. There may be only 100. This cat is endangered because of habitat loss, meaning that human beings build things in the places where they live. Some cats are hit by cars when they come to the road to eat dead frogs, dead lizards, and other animals that have been killed by cars. They are also endangered because domestic cats mate with them. Veterinarians have taught people on Iriomote Island to spay and neuter their pet cats to prevent this, the local government has tried to stop people from driving too fast and the government of Japan has made part of Iriomote Island a wildlife protection area.\nFor a time in the 1970s, the people who lived on Iriomote Island said the government of Japan thought the cats were more important than they were. One German scientist had asked the government of Japan to make all the human beings leave the island to protect the cat. Other scientists showed, however, that the cat can live next to humans and is not afraid to look for food near farms and rice paddies. In 2019, many Iriomote islanders said they were proud of their rare wildcat, though they worried that too many tourists would come to their island and damage it."}

The trail goes between Springer Mountain in Georgia and Mount Katahdin in Maine. The trail is about long. The exact length changes over time as parts are changed. The Appalachian Trail Conservancy says the Appalachian Trail is the longest hiking-only trail in the world. More than 2 million people hike on part of the trail at least once each year.\nThe idea of the Appalachian Trail started in 1921. The trail was completed in 1937 after more than ten years of work. Changes to the trail still happen every year. Thirty-one trail clubs and many partners help keep it usable. The National Park Service, United States Forest Service, and the nonprofit Appalachian Trail Conservancy manage it. Most of the trail is in forest or wild lands. Some parts go through towns, roads and farms. It passes through 14 states: Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine.\nThru-hikers attempt to hike the whole trail in one season. The number of thru-hikes per year has increased steadily. In 2017, 715 northbound and 133 southbound thru-hikes were reported. Many books, documentaries, websites, and fan organizations are dedicated to the hike. Some people hike from one end to the other, then turn around and thru-hike the trail the other way. This is known as a \"yo-yo\".\nOther websites.\nOfficial sites"}

It means that if a country was not under the control of a king who was from Europe and Christian, then any European Christian country could take control of the land. The discovery doctrine ignores any claim to the land that the native people living there might make.\nHistory.\nMany European kings used the discovery doctrine to justify colonization. They said that they wanted to bring civilization and Christianity to new places. Back then, it was thought that European culture was the best culture and Christianity was the best religion.\nUnited States law.\nThe courts of the United States have used the discovery doctrine to say that Native Americans were not allowed to own land. The reasoning behind this thinking is that they were just occupants of the land and did not really own it before Europeans came. Therefore, the land was not theirs but belongs to European governments or their successors (in this case, the United States and Americans would be the land owner since the country was formed after independence from Great Britain).\nPresent-day consequences.\nMany people now think that the discovery doctrine is not fair and racist. They think indigenous peoples should have the right to own land because the land is part of who they are as a people group and owning land allows them to have more legal benefits.\nReligion.\nSome churches that have supported the discovery doctrine in the past now repudiate it. That means that they do not believe anymore and that they are sorry for all the hurt it has caused. Many of the churches that repudiated the discovery doctrine are Protestant churches in North America, specifically the United States. \nThe Catholic Church has not made a statement against the discovery doctrine, so it still supports it. Many of the rulers who used the doctrine discovery were Catholics."}

Bush announced his plans to seek the Republican Party nomination for the presidency of the United States in the 2000 presidential election.\nBush began the campaign as the front runner among Republicans because many people knew his name, high funds, and control of the governorship of Texas and polls starting in 1997 showed Bush leading every opponent by double digits. \nThe main challenger to Bush was Senator John McCain, who appealed to moderate Republicans.\nBush won the majority of the primaries and after the March 2000 Super Tuesday contests he was well ahead in delegates of both McCain and Alan Keyes. On August 3, 2000 Bush won the Republican nomination at the Republican Convention with the support of 2,058 delegates. Dick Cheney, the former U.S. Secretary of Defense, was nominated as vice president despite Cheney recommending former Missouri Senator John Danforth.\nThroughout the majority of the primary and general campaign seasons Bush was leading Gore in the polls. On November 7, 2000, it was projected that Bush had won in Florida and its 25 electoral votes. \nGore won the national popular vote but the Gore campaign lost the electoral college vote after a legal battle over disputed vote counts. Bush won the election on the electoral college vote of 271 to 266."}

In the 19th century, some ceremonies lasted up to sixteen days. Modern ceremonies can still last two days or more. The caste of the bride and the groom are important for the ceremony. The \"pendli\" or wedding is considered the strongest of social bonds. It is said to spiritually merge two souls opening the doors to \"gruhastaashramam\" (household life). There is a Telugu saying that \"Marriage is supposed to be a family union and not an individual formality.\"\nTelugu marriage is sanctified by seven pledges made by the bride and groom. It begins when the bride and groom have completed seven turns around a sacred fire. Many of the gestures have a symbolic importance They are common in the ceremony and ensure that the bride and groom are united in the presence of \"Panchabhutaalu\" \u2014five essential elements for life, namely: \"Bhumi\" (earth), \"Akaasham\" (sky), \"Agni\" (fire), \"Neeru\" (water) and \"Vaayuvu\" (air). The ceremony is held under a \"Ka\u1e37y\u0101\u1e47a Ma\u1e47\u1e0dapa\u1e43\" or wedding pavilion decorated with fresh flowers. The \"N\u0101dasvaram\" (also called the \"Shehnai\" in North India) is an Indian musical instrument that traditionally accompanies most Telugu weddings.\nEach element in the ceremony is connected and is given special importance. Historically, the groom would ride an elephant to the bride's home where the wedding is supposed to take place. This practice is called \"Gajaarohana\". Today this tradition is declining. Some marriage ceremonies are held in a temple in the presence of god, but most are conducted outside because of the number of people at the ceremony. After every ceremony, they serve food to all the guests, which is also the main part of the culture of offering food to anyone. It is also a tradition to eat ice cream or sweets after dinner because it is considered auspicious. All the rituals conducted throughout the Telugu wedding ceremony have a religious significance.\nThe decorations mostly consist of rich colourful flowers and mango leaves. Families renovate their houses and invite all the guests going to each of their houses by the use of \"kumkuma\" (colourful, decorative powder)."}

It was made from 1968 to 1978. There were three generations of the Espada. These generations were known as Series I, Series II, and Series III.\nHistory.\nThe Lamborghini Espada was designed by Marcello Gandini in 1967.\nThe Espada is a four-seater grand-touring car. It was initially sold at the same time as the Islero and the mid-engine Miura. The Espada and the Islero both replaced the 400 GT.\nThree different series of the Espada were made. These were the S1 (1968\u20131970), the S2 (1970\u20131972) and the S3 (1972\u20131978). Each series was an update from the last, with changes such as more horsepower and a redesigned interior. Overall, 1,217 Espadas were made.\nSeries I.\nThe Espada was launched at the 1968 Geneva Motor Show, alongside the Islero. The Espada was equipped with a Lamborghini V12 engine, which was based off the one used in the 400 GT 2+2. The engine was rated at in the series I cars. 186 Series I Espadas were made before January 1970.\nSeries II.\nAt the 1970 Brussels Motor Show, Lamborghini revealed the Series II version of the Espada. The power output of the Espada increased to due to a higher 10.7:1 compression ratio. The brakes were changed to vented Girling discs instead of solid discs. CV joints were now used on the rear half-shafts. Lamborghini made 575 of the Series II Espadas, which was the most of any series of Espada.\nSeries III.\nThe Series III Espada was launched in 1972. It was fitted with wider Pirelli Cinturato 215/70WR15 CN12 tyres. The front grille now had a square instead of hexagonal mesh. A sunroof was also made an option for the Series III.\nThe engine was carried over from the Series II Espada. Power steering by ZF and air conditioning were now standard. In 1974, a Chrysler Torqueflite 3 speed automatic transmission became available as an option.\nFrom 1975, large impact bumpers had to be installed to meet United States safety requirements. Other changes had to be made for the car to meet US laws. Some people consider these later US-spec cars to be a separate fourth series of the Espada.\nEngine and transmission.\nThe Espada used an updated version of the 400 GT\u2019s 4.0 liter V12 engine. The engine produced horsepower in the Series I Espada, and in the Series II and III Espadas. The engine was paired to a five-speed manual transmission, with a three-speed Chrysler-built automatic transmission as an option for the Series III Espada."}

It lives in Western Australia.\nThis frog can grow to 3.5 cm long. This frog can be dark red, light brown or gray in colour. It has some stripes on its head and body and some webbing on its feet.\nThey lay eggs in the rocky streams and other rocky bodies of water. The eggs sink to the bottom. The tadpoles swim to the top and stay near the surface. They take two months to become frogs.\nScientists think this frog is related to \"L. coplandi\". People tell them apart because their voices sound different."}

{"id": "773099", "revid": "586", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=773099", "title": "Serial comma", "text": "The serial comma or Oxford comma is a comma used directly after the second-to-last item in a list of three or more items. For example, a list of three people may be shown as \"Alice, Bob, and Charlie\" (with the comma) or \"Alice, Bob and Charlie\" (without the comma).\nSome style guides prefer using the comma, while others advise against it. It may sometimes be useful to add the comma to avoid confusion. For example, a sentence such as \"Please bring Marcus, a musician and a skater to the dinner event today\" may confuse anyone reading that sentence. Without the Oxford comma, they might think that Marcus is a musician and a skater, so they would need to bring Marcus instead of three people to that dinner event today.\nWhen following a style guide that opposes the comma, one can rearrange the terms to avoid confusion. For example, saying \"a musician, a skater and Marcus\" does not change the intended meaning, but it avoids the confusion."}
