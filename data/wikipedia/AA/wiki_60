She was called \"Lady Ella\", the \"Queen of Jazz\", and the \"First Lady of Song\".\nHer voice spanned three octaves. She could sing very high notes and very low notes. She was famous for her scat singing. She won 14 Grammy Awards. She was awarded the National Medal of Art and the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\nEarly life.\nElla Fitzgerald was born in 1917 in Newport News, Virginia, United States to William and Temperance \"Tempie\" Fitzgerald. Soon after Ella was born, her parents separated. She went to live in Yonkers, New York with her mother and her mother's boyfriend, Joseph Da Silva. In 1923, Fitzgerald's half-sister, Frances Da Silva, was born. When she was a child, Fitzgerald lived in the Colored Orphan Asylum in Riverdale, the Bronx.\nAs a youngster, Fitzgerald wanted to be a dancer. She loved listening to jazz music by Louis Armstrong, Bing Crosby and The Boswell Sisters. She especially liked the lead singer Connee Boswell, later saying, \"My mother brought home one of her records, and I fell in love with it...I tried so hard to sound just like her.\"\nIn 1932, Fitzgerald's mother died. Ella began doing badly at school. At one time, she had a job as a lookout at a brothel and a job with some people with Mafia connections. She got into trouble with the police, and was sent to a reform school. She escaped from the reformatory, and for a time was homeless.\nFitzgerald had her first job as a singer when she was 17 on November 21, 1934 at the Harlem Opera House in Harlem, New York. She was able to compete in one of its famous \"Amateur Nights\". At first she was going to go on stage and dance but, intimidated by some local dancers, she decided to sing instead. She won the first prize of US$25 singing Connee Boswell's \"Judy\" and \"The Object of My Affection\".\nBig-band singing.\nIn January 1935, Fitzgerald won the chance to perform for a week with the Tiny Bradshaw band at the Harlem Opera House. She met a drummer and bandleader called Chick Webb here. Webb had already hired a singer called Charlie Linton to work with the band. According to \"The New York Times\", Webb was \"reluctant to sign her...because she was gawky and unkempt, a \"diamond in the rough.\"\" Webb let her try singing with his band when they played a dance at Yale University.\nFitzgerald began singing often with Webb's Orchestra during 1935, at Harlem's Savoy Ballroom. She recorded several hit songs with them, including \"Love and Kisses\" and \"(If You Can't Sing It) You'll Have to Swing It (Mr. Paganini)\". In 1938 she co-wrote and sang a version of the nursery rhyme, \"A-Tisket, A-Tasket\". After this, she started getting famous.\nChick Webb died on June 16, 1939, and his band was renamed \"Ella Fitzgerald and her Famous Orchestra\". Fitzgerald became the bandleader. She recorded nearly 150 sides during her time with the orchestra.\nSinging with Decca.\nIn 1942, Fitzgerald left the band and began to work as a solo singer. She was signed to the Decca label, and she had several popular hit songs. She recording with other musicians like the Ink Spots, Louis Jordan, and the Delta Rhythm Boys.\nDecca's Milt Gabler became her manager and she began working often for the jazz producer Norman Granz. She often sang in his Jazz at the Philharmonic concerts. Then, Granz became her manager, but he did not record her on any of his record labels for nearly a decade.\nIn the mid-1940s, after the swing era, and the end of the great touring big bands, jazz music became quite different. A new kind of jazz called bebop became popular and Fitzgerald changed her style of singing. She worked with Dizzy Gillespie's big band and started including scat singing as a big part of her performances. About singing with Gillespie, Fitzgerald said, \"I just tried to do [with my voice] what I heard the horns in the band doing.\"\nHer 1945 scat recording of \"Flying Home\" was later described by \"The New York Times\" as \"one of the most influential vocal jazz records of the decade...Where other singers, most notably Louis Armstrong, had tried similar improvisation, no one before Miss Fitzgerald employed the technique with such dazzling inventiveness.\" Her be-bop recording of \"Oh, Lady be Good!\" (1947) was also very popular, and made people think of her as one of the most important jazz singers.\nGranz did not like some of the music Fitzgerald was given at this time, so during her last years on the Decca label she recorded some duets with pianist Ellis Larkins, released in 1950 as \"Ella Sings Gershwin\".\nSinging with Verve.\nIn 1955, Fitzgerald left Decca, and joined Granz's new record label, Verve Records. She said later, \"I had gotten to the point where I was only singing bebop. I thought bebop was 'it', and that all I had to do was go some place and sing bop. But it finally got to the point where I had no place to sing. I realized then that there was more to music than bop. Norman...felt that I should do other things, so he produced \"The Cole Porter Songbook\" with me. It was a turning point in my life.\"\nA new album, \"Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Cole Porter Songbook\", was released in 1956. It was the first of eight multi-album \"Songbook\" sets that she would record for Verve between 1956 and 1964. Many of the songs were standards and Fitzgerald tried to cross over into a non-jazz audience.\n\"Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Duke Ellington Songbook\" was the only \"Songbook\" on which the composer of the songs also played with her. Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn, who had worked together for a long time, both played on half the set's 38 tracks, and wrote two new pieces of music for the album: \"The E and D Blues\", and a musical piece about Fitzgerald (the only \"Songbook\" track that Fitzgerald does not sing on).\nThe \"Songbook\" series became the Fitzgerald's most critically acclaimed and popular work. \"The New York Times\" wrote in 1996, \"These albums were among the first pop records to devote such serious attention to individual songwriters, and they were instrumental in establishing the pop album as a vehicle for serious musical exploration.\"\nElla Fitzgerald also recorded albums of the songs of Cole Porter and George Gershwin in 1972 and 1983. The albums were called \"Ella Loves Cole\" and \"Nice Work If You Can Get It\". A later album of songs by a single composer was released when she was with Pablo Records, \"Ella Abra\u00e7a Jobim\", with songs by Antonio Carlos Jobim.\nWhile she was recording the \"Songbooks\" and the occasional studio album, Fitzgerald toured 40 to 45 weeks per year in the United States and internationally, with Norman Granz. Granz helped her to become one of the most important live jazz performers.\nIn the mid-1950s, Fitzgerald became the first African-American to perform at the Mocambo (a Hollywood nightclub), after Marilyn Monroe had persuaded the owner to make the booking. This was very important in Fitzgerald's career. The event was turned into a play by Bonnie Greer which is to receive a production in London's West End from November 2009.\nSome live albums on Verve that she recorded are well thought of by critics: \"Ella at the Opera House\", ' and '.\nLater years.\nIn later life, Fitzgerald kept a busy concert schedule, but her health worsened. She had heart surgery in 1986. She had diabetes, which accounted for her failing eyesight. Her diabetes worsened, and both legs were cut off (amputated) below the knees. She never completely recovered. She was unable to perform often. She spent time with family. Fitzgerald died in her Beverly Hills, California home on June 15, 1996 from a stroke. She was interred in the Sunset Mission Mausoleum at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California.\nAwards.\nBy the 1990s, Fitzgerald had recorded more than 200 songs. In 1991, she gave her final concert at Carnegie Hall. She had performed there 26 times. She received numerous awards. In 1979, she received Kennedy Center Honors. In 1987, she received the National Medal of Arts. She received the Presidential Medal of Freedom. France presented her with the Commander of Arts and Letters award. Yale University, Dartmouth, and other schools awarded her honorary doctorates. Several of Fitzgerald's awards, significant personal possessions, and documents were given to the Smithsonian Institution, the library of Boston University, the Library of Congress, and the Schoenberg Library at UCLA.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1941, Fitzgerald married Benny Kornegay, a convicted drug dealer. The marriage was annulled after two years. In December 1947, she married double bass player Ray Brown. They adopted a child of Fitzgerald's half-sister, Frances. They named him Ray Brown, Jr.. Fitzgerald and Brown divorced in 1953.\nIn July 1957, Reuters reported that Fitzgerald had secretly married Thor Einar Larsen, a young Norwegian, in Oslo. The affair was quickly forgotten when Larsen was sentenced to five months hard labor in Sweden for stealing money from a young woman."}

She was also called \"Lady Day\", a nickname that her friend and musical partner Lester Young gave her. Holiday was a very important influence on jazz and pop singing. The way that she sang was similar to the way jazz musicians played their instruments. She was admired for her very personal and intimate way of singing. Critic John Bush wrote that she \"changed the art of American pop vocals forever.\"\nShe co-wrote some songs which have become jazz standards, like \"God Bless the Child\", \"Don't Explain\", and \"Lady Sings the Blues\". She also became famous for singing jazz standards written by other people, like \"Easy Living\" and \"Strange Fruit\".\nEarly life.\nHoliday was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1915, a Roman Catholic. She had a difficult childhood, which affected her life and career. Not much is known about her early life, but there are stories about it in her autobiography, \"Lady Sings the Blues\", which was published in 1956. Later, it was found out that some parts of this book were wrong.\nHoliday got her pseudonym, or stage name, from Billie Dove, an actress she admired, and Clarence Holiday, the man who was probably her father. At the beginning of her career, she spelled her last name \"Halliday\", but then changed it back to \"Holiday\" (they are pronounced the same, 'Hahliday', in American English).\nPeople have never been sure who Holiday's father was. This is because her birth certificate said her father was called Frank DeViese. Some people now think that this was a mistake that somebody made when she was born.\nHoliday's mother was called Sadie Fagan. Fagan became pregnant when she was 13 years old. Her parents threw her out of her home in Baltimore, and she went to Philadelphia where her daughter Eleanora (Billie Holiday) was born. Fagan moved back to Baltimore and married Clarence Holiday, who was probably her baby's father, but they later divorced. When she was 10 years old, Holiday often missed school. When she said that she had been raped, she was sent to The House of the Good Shepherd, a Catholic reform school. She was allowed out two years later, with the help of a family friend. Holiday moved to New York City with her mother in 1928. In 1929 Holiday's mother saw a neighbor, Wilbert Rich, raping Holiday. Rich was sentenced to three months in jail. But after her incident as a rape victim she was still constantly raped by drunk men in her neighborhood. She almost got pregnant by a drunk man walking down their street.\nEarly singing career.\nHoliday later said that in 1930 she worked as a prostitute in a brothel, and was imprisoned for a short time for solicitation (prostitution). In the 1930s in Harlem, New York City, she started singing for tips in night clubs, and got a job at Pod's and Jerry's, a famous Harlem jazz club. In 1933 she was working at a club called Monette's. She was discovered by a talent scout called John Hammond.\nHammond helped Holiday to record her first songs in November 1933 with Benny Goodman: \"Your Mother's Son-In-Law\" and \"Riffin' the Scotch\". In 1935 she recorded more songs with a group led by pianist Teddy Wilson. They recorded \"What a Little Moonlight Can Do\" and \"Miss Brown To You\".\nTeddy Wilson was signed to Brunswick Records by John Hammond to record pop songs in the new 'swing' style for jukeboxes. They were allowed to improvise the music. Holiday was very good at improvising the melody line to fit the emotions.\nHoliday also wrote songs during the 1930s, like \"Billie's Blues\", \"Tell Me More (And Then Some)\", \"Everything Happens For The Best\", \"Our Love Is Different\", and \"Long Gone Blues\".\nA tenor saxophonist called Lester Young often accompanied Holiday. He had been a boarder at her mother's house in 1934 and she got on well with him. Young gave her a nickname, \"Lady Day\" and she called him \"Prez.\" She spent three months working at Clark Monroe's Uptown House in New York in 1937. In the late 1930s, she also worked as a big band singer with Count Basie and Artie Shaw. She was one of the first black women to work with a white orchestra (Artie Shaw's).\n\"Strange Fruit\".\nIn the 1930s, Holiday was recording for Columbia Records. She heard of a song called \"Strange Fruit\". It was based on a poem about lynching written by Abel Meeropol, a Jewish schoolteacher from the Bronx. The poem had been set to music and was performed at teachers' union meetings. It was heard by a night club owner called Barney Josephson and he told Holiday about it. She sang the song at Josephson's club in 1939. At first she was worried that it might make people angry. She later said that the song reminded her of her father's death, and that this was partly why she did not want to perform it at first. In a 1958 interview, she also said that many people did not understand what the song meant: \"They'll ask me to sing that sexy song about the people swinging\", she said.\nThe music producers at Columbia Records thought that subject of the song (the lynching of black people) might upset people. A music producer called Milt Gabler said that Holiday could record it for his label called Commodore Records. That was done in April 1939 and Holiday sang \"Strange Fruit\" over the next twenty years. The song did not get played on the radio but still sold well. Gabler said that this was because the other side of the record was \"Fine and Mellow\", which was a jukebox hit. Later, she recorded \"Strange Fruit\" again for Verve.\n1944-1950.\nIn 1944, Holiday went to work, still with Milt Gabler, at Decca Records. She was 29 years old. Her first songs for Decca were called \"Lover Man\" and \"No More\". \"Lover Man\" was a song written for her. It is about a woman who has never known love, and it became one of her biggest hits.\nIn November 1944, Holiday recorded three songs, \"That Ole Devil Called Love\", \"Big Stuff\", and \"Don't Explain\". Holiday wrote \"Don't Explain\" after she caught her husband, Jimmy Monroe, with lipstick on his collar. After that, Holiday didn't record any songs until August 1945. She recorded, \"Don't Explain\", \"Big Stuff\", \"You Better Go Now\", and \"What is This Thing Called Love?\". In 1946, she recorded songs called \"No Good Man\" and \"Good Morning Heartache\", \"The Blues Are Brewin\", and \"Guilty\". In February 1947, Holiday recorded two hits, \"There Is No Greater Love\" and \"Deep Song\". She also recorded \"Solitude\" and \"Easy Living\", songs that she had recorded with Teddy Wilson in the 1930s.\nHoliday's next recording was after she came out of prison in 1948. She recorded this time with a vocal group called the Stardusters. She recorded \"Weep No More\" and \"Girls Were Made to Take Care of Boys\". She was worried that people wouldn't like the recordings and recorded two more songs without the group, \"My Man\" and Gershwin's \"I Loves You Porgy\". These became very popular.\nThe next year, Billie had more hits. She sang a version of Bessie Smith's, song \"T'Ain't Nobody's Business if I Do\", \"Gimme A Pigfoot (And A Bottle of Beer)\", \"Do Your Duty\", and \"Keeps on Rainin'\", to her lush \"You're My Thrill\" and \"Crazy He Calls Me\". She also recorded a song that she wrote called \"Somebody's On My Mind\".\nIn her last recording in 1950, she recorded two songs. Both of them were backed by strings, horns, and a choir. She recorded her own \"God Bless the Child\" and \"This is Heaven to Me\".\nMovies.\nIn 1947, Holiday was in a film with Louis Armstrong called \"New Orleans\". The musical drama film featured Holiday singing with Armstrong and his band and was directed by Arthur Lubin. Holiday was not pleased that she had to play a maid. In her autobiography she said:\n\"I thought I was going to play myself in it. I thought I was going to be Billie Holiday doing a couple of songs in a nightclub setting and that would be that. I should have known better. When I saw the script, I did. You just tell one Negro girl who's made movies who didn't play a maid or a whore. I don't know any. I found out I was going to do a little singing, but I was still playing the part of a maid.\"\nHoliday was also in the 1950 Universal-International short film \"'Sugar Chile' Robinson, Billie Holiday, Count Basie and His Sextet\", where she sang \"God Bless the Child\" and \"Now, Baby or Never\".\n1947 arrest and comeback.\nOn May 16, 1947, Holiday was arrested for the possession of narcotics and drugs in her New York apartment. On May 27, 1947, she had to go to court. Holiday pleaded guilty (admitted that she had the drugs) and was sentenced to Alderson Federal Prison Camp in West Virginia. Holiday said she never \"sang a note\" at Alderson even though people wanted her to. She was released early (March 16, 1948) because of her good behavior. When she arrived at Newark, everybody was there to welcome her back, including her pianist Bobby Tucker.\nHer manager Ed Fishman thought of the idea to have a comeback concert at Carnegie Hall. Holiday was worried at first because she thought that nobody would want her back, but she decided do it. On March 27, 1948, the Carnegie concert was very successful. She did sang songs like Cole Porter's \"Night and Day\" and \"Strange Fruit\". The concert was not recorded.\nHoliday was arrested again on January 22, 1949, at a hotel in San Francisco.\n1950s.\nHoliday said that she began using hard drugs in the early 1940s. She had married trombonist Jimmy Monroe on August 25, 1941. When she was still married to Monroe, she started a romantic relationship with trumpeter Joe Guy, who was also her drug dealer. She lived with him as his wife (called a common law wife) and divorced Monroe in 1947. She also separated from Guy. After of she was arrested and convicted for possessing drugs in 1947, she was not allowed to work in clubs in New York for the rest of her life. The only time she was able to was when she sang at the Ebony Club in 1948, where she had the permission of John Levy.\nIn the 1950s, Holiday's health became bad, because of her drinking alcohol, using drugs and her relationships with abusive men. Her voice became rough, but some people say that her singing became more emotional.\nOn March 28, 1952, Holiday married Louis McKay, a man who worked for the Mafia. McKay, like most of the men in her life, was abusive, but he did try to get her to stop using drugs. They later separated.\nOn November 10, 1956, she performed two concerts before big audiences at Carnegie Hall.\nHoliday went on tour Europe for the first time in 1954 with Buddy DeFranco and Red Norvo. When she went back to Europe, almost five years later, she went on television for Granada's \"Chelsea at Nine\", in London. This was one of the last times she was on television. Her last studio recordings were made for MGM in 1959, with Ray Ellis and his Orchestra, who had also accompanied her on Columbia's \"Lady in Satin\" album \nin 1958. The MGM recordings were released after Holiday's death on an album called \"Last Recordings\".\nHoliday's autobiography, \"Lady Sings the Blues\", was published in 1956. It was ghostwritten by William Dufty, a \"New York Post\" writer and editor who was married to Holiday's close friend Maely Dufty. He wrote the book quickly after talking to Holiday in his apartment, as well as using earlier interviewers. His wanted to let Holiday tell her story her way.\nHoliday never had any children of her own, but had two godchildren: singer Billie Lorraine Feather, daughter of Leonard Feather, and Bevan Dufty, son of William Dufty.\nDeath.\nOn May 31, 1959, Holiday was taken to the Metropolitan Hospital in New York. She had liver and heart disease. Police officers were at the door to her room. She was arrested for drug possession as she lay dying and her hospital room was raided by the police. They kept guarding her at the hospital until she died from cirrhosis of the liver on July 17, 1959. In the last years of her life, she had gradually lost her earnings, and she died with $0.70 in the bank and $750 in cash."}

{"id": "197631", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=197631", "title": "Nina Simone", "text": "Nina Simone (born Eunice Kathleen Waymon; February 21, 1933 \u2013 April 21, 2003) was an American singer, songwriter, pianist, arranger and civil rights activist. Simone did not like people to classify her music, or say what genre it fell into, but people often call her a jazz musician. She was often called \"The High Priestess of Soul\".\nEarly life.\nNina Simone was born Eunice Kathleen Waymon in Tryon, North Carolina in 1933. She was one of eight children in a poor family. She began playing the piano when she was age of three. The first song she learned was \"God be With You, Till we Meet Again\" and she played at her local church. Her first concert was a classical piano recital, when she was twelve. Her parents sat on the front row to watch her, but were made to move to the back of the hall to make way for white people. Simone said she would not to play until her parents were moved back to the front. She remembered this event later when she got involved with the civil rights movement.\nSimone's mother, Mary Kate Waymon was a strict Methodist minister. Her father, John Divine Waymon, was a handyman, and sometimes a barber, who was often ill. Mrs. Waymon worked as a maid and her employer, hearing of Simone's talent, gave them money for piano lessons. After that, a local fund was made to help in carrying on her education. When she was 17, Simone moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\nShe found more racism here when she applied for a scholarship at a local college. She had to take a test, and passed it, but she was not given the scholarship. When she asked the examiner why she was not given a scholarship, the examiner told her \"because you're black.\"\nAfter this, Simone became very passionate about the civil rights movement. She began to earn money teaching piano and accompanying singers. This money helped her to study at the Juilliard School of Music in New York. She applied to study piano at the Curtis Institute, but was not successful. She believed that this too was because she was black, and because she was a woman.\nEarly career (1954\u20131959).\nSimone played the piano at the Midtown Bar &amp; Grill on Pacific Avenue in Atlantic City to earn money for her studying. The owner said that she would only get the job if she would sing as well as play the piano. She did not want her mother to know that she was playing \"the devil's music\", so she started using the stage name Nina Simone. She got \"Nina\" from a nickname given to her by a boyfriend, and \"Simone\" from a French actress called Simone Signoret. Simone played and sang a mixture of jazz, blues and classical music at the bar. She began to get fans. In 1958 she recorded a song called \"I Loves You Porgy\", from \"Porgy and Bess\" by George Gershwin. She had learned the song from a Billie Holiday album, and performed it as a favor for a friend. It became her only \"Billboard\" top 40 success in the United States. Soon, she recorded her first album \"Little Girl Blue\" on Bethlehem Records. Simone never earned money from the album because she sold the rights for $3000, missing out on more than $1 million of royalties.\nSimone then signed a contract with the record company Colpix Records and released several studio and live albums. Colpix let her have control over choosing the material that she recorded. Simone made sure she had control and did not really mind whether she had a recording contract or not. She only played pop music to make money for her classical music studies.\nCivil rights era (1964\u20131974).\nIn the 1960s, Simone was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. In 1964, Simone began to work with the Dutch record label Philips. She began to record songs about her African-American origins and racial inequality. She recorded a live album called \"Nina Simone In Concert\" which included the song \"Mississippi Goddam\". It was about the murder of Medgar Evers and the bombing of a church in Birmingham, Alabama that killed four black children. The song was boycotted in some southern states. With \"Old Jim Crow\" on the same album she reacts to the Jim Crow Laws.\nAfter that, a civil rights was a common theme in Simone's songs. Simone performed and spoke at many civil rights meetings, like the Selma to Montgomery marches. She sang a version Billie Holiday's song \"Strange Fruit\" (on \"Pastel Blues\"), a song about the lynching of black men in the South. She also a poem by W. Cuney called \"Images\" on her 1966 album \"Let It All Out\", about the lack of pride in African-American women. Simone wrote \"Four Women\", a song about four different stereotypes of African-American women. It was on her 1966 album \"Wild Is the Wind\"\nSimone moved from Philips to RCA Victor in 1967. She sang \"Backlash Blues\", written by her friend Langston Hughes on her first RCA album, \"Nina Simone Sings The Blues\". On \"Silk &amp; Soul\" she recorded Billy Taylor's \"I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free\" and \"Turning Point\". The 1968 album \"Nuff Said\" has some live recordings from the Westbury Music Fair, April 7, 1968, three days after the murder of Martin Luther King, Jr. She dedicated the whole performance to him and sang \"Why? (The King Of Love Is Dead)\". This was a song written by her bass player straight after they heard the news of King's death. \nTogether with Weldon Irvine, Simone turned Lorraine Hansberry's unfinished play \"To Be Young, Gifted and Black\" into a civil rights song. She performed it live on her 1970 album \"Black Gold\". A studio recording was released as a single, and the song has been covered by Aretha Franklin and Donny Hathaway.\nLater life (1974\u20132003).\nSimone left the United States in September 1970. She flew to Barbados. She thought that her husband and manager, Andrew Stroud, would tell her when she had to perform again. However, Stroud thought that Simone's sudden disappearance (and the fact that she had left behind her wedding ring) meant that she wanted a divorce. As her manager, Stroud was also in charge of Simone's income. This meant that after their separation Simone did not know anything about how her business was managed and what she was actually worth. When she came back to the United States, she found out that she was wanted for not paying taxes. She went back to Barbados again to get away from the authorities and prosecution. She stayed in Barbados for quite some time, and had a long affair with the Prime Minister, Errol Barrow. A close friend, singer Miriam Makeba, persuaded her to go to Liberia in Africa. After that she lived in Switzerland and the Netherlands. She went to live in France in 1992.\nShe recorded her last album for RCA Records, \"It Is Finished\", during 1974. In 1978 CTI Records owner Creed Taylor persuaded her to record another album, \"Baltimore\". This album got good reviews, but did not make much money. Four years later Simone recorded \"Fodder On My Wings\" on a French record label. During the 1980s Simone performed regularly at Ronnie Scott's jazz club in London. She recorded an album there in 1984 called \"Live at Ronnie Scott's\". On stage, Simone often seemed to be haughty and aloof but seemed to enjoy talking to her audiences. In 1987, her 1958 song \"My Baby Just Cares For Me\" was used in an advert for Chanel No. 5 perfume in the UK. After that, the song was released again and it went to number 5 in the UK singles chart, making Simone more popular in the UK. Her autobiography, \"I Put a Spell on You\", was published in 1992 and she recorded her last album, \"A Single Woman,\" in 1993.\nDeath.\nIn 1993 Simone went to live near Aix-en-Provence in Southern France. She was ill with breast cancer for several years. She died of the disease in her sleep at her home in Carry-le-Rouet, Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne on April 21, 2003. Her funeral service was attended by singers Miriam Makeba and Patti LaBelle, poet Sonia Sanchez, actor Ossie Davis and hundreds of other people. Elton John sent a flowers with the message \"We were the greatest and I love you\". Simone's ashes were scattered in several African countries. She left behind a daughter, Lisa Celeste, who is now an actress and singer who took on the stage name Simone."}

{"id": "197700", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=197700", "title": "Bessie Smith", "text": "Bessie Smith (July 9, 1892 or April 15, 1894 \u2013 September 26, 1937) was an American blues singer. She was sometimes called \"The Empress of the Blues\" and was very popular in the 1920s and 1930s. A lot of people think that she was one of the best singers of her time, and along with Louis Armstrong, she was an important influence on later jazz singers.\nEarly life.\nIn the 1900 American census, Bessie Smith's mother, Laura Smith, said that Bessie was born in Chachanooga, Tennessee in July 1892. In the census in 1910, her sister, Viola Smith said that Bessie's birthday was April 15, 1894. That is the date that is on all later documents, and was the one that Smith used.\nShe was the daughter of Laura and William Smith. William Smith was a laborer and part-time Baptist preacher who died before his daughter was old enough to remember him. By the time she was nine, her mother had died as well, and her older sister Viola had to look after for her sisters and brothers.\nTo earn money for their poor family, Smith and her brother Andrew began Busking (performing) on the streets of Chattanooga as a duo. She sang and danced, and he accompanied her on guitar. They liked to perform in front of the White Elephant Saloon in the middle of Chattanooga's African-American community.\nIn 1904, Smith's oldest brother, Clarence, ran away from home and joined small traveling troupe owned by Moses Stokes. \"If Bessie had been old enough, she would have gone with him,\" said Clarence's widow, Maud. \"That's why he left without telling her, but Clarence told me she was ready, even then. Of course, she was only a child.\"\nIn 1912, Clarence came back to Chattanooga, with the Stokes troupe and helped Smith get an audition. She got a job as a dancer, not a singer, because the company already had a singer called .\nBy the early 1920s, Smith starred a musical called \"How Come?\" with Sidney Bechet. The musical went to Broadway. Smith had an argument with the producer of \"How Come?\" and she was replaced by Alberta Hunter. Smith went back to Philadelphia, where she now lived. She met and fell in love with a security guard called Jack Gee. They got married on June 7, 1923. At this time, Smith made her first song recordings with Columbia Records. Her marriage was difficult and both of them had affairs.\nSmith became the biggest headliner on the black Theater Owners Booking Association circuit. She ran a show that sometimes had as many as 40 people and made her the highest-paid black entertainer of her day. Gee liked the money she was earning, but did not like her show business life. In particular, he did like the fact that Smith was bisexual. In 1929, Smith found out that Gee was having an affair with another performer called Gertrude Saunders. Smith separated from Gee but they never got divorced. Smith went to live with a man called Richard Morgan, as is they were husband and wife. He was an old friend and the uncle of a jazz musician called Lionel Hampton. Smith and Morgan stayed together for the rest of her life.\nCareer.\nMa Rainey helped Smith to get better as a performer, but she did not teach her to sing. Smith began started her own act around 1913, at Atlanta's \"81\" Theatre. By 1920 she had got a good reputation in the South and along the Eastern Seaboard.\nIn 1920, a singer called Mamie Smith recorded a song called \"Crazy Blues,\". This was one of the first blues songs recorded by an African-American singer, and was very popular. The recording industry realised that there were lots of black people who would buy blues records. Smith was signed by Columbia Records in 1923 when the label decided to make a \"race records\" series.\nHer first recording, a coupling of \"Gulf Coast Blues\" and \"Downhearted Blues,\" was very popular. Smith became a headliner on the black T.O.B.A. circuit and was its top attraction in the 1920s. She worked very hard, in theatres during the winter, and touring for the rest of the year. She became the highest-paid black entertainer of her day. Somebody from Columbia Records gave her a nickname, \"Queen of the Blues\". Soon, the press were calling her the \"Empress of the Blues\".\nShe made about 160 recordings for Columbia, often accompanied by other popular musicians like Louis Armstrong, James P. Johnson, Joe Smith, Charlie Green, and Fletcher Henderson.\nDeath.\nOn September 26, 1937, Smith was seriously injured in a car accident while traveling between Memphis, Tennessee, and Clarksdale, Mississippi. Her boyfriend Richard Morgan was driving. People think he might have fallen asleep at the wheel or that he could not tell what speed a slow-moving truck was driving in front of him. Tire marks at the scene showed that Morgan tried to hit the truck by driving around its left side but he hit the back of the truck side-on very fast. Smith, who was in the passenger seat, was hit worst in the crash. Morgan did not have any major injuries. One of the first people to see her after the crash was a doctor. He said that she had a bad injury to her arm which made her lose a lot of blood. She also had bad injuries to the side of her body, and was in shock.\nAn ambulance took Smith to Clarksdale's Afro-American Hospital and her right arm was amputated (taken off). She did not wake up and died that morning. After she died, some people said that it was because a hospital for white people would not treat her, but in those days, an amubulance driver would never have taken a black person to a \"Whites only\" hospital at all."}

It was built by Lockheed's \"Skunk Works\" in the 1960s for the United States Air Force (USAF). In other words, it was a spy plane.\nDesign.\nThe Blackbird was designed to fly at more than Mach 3 \u2013 three times the speed of sound. This meant it would become very hot during flight. To help with this, most of the aircraft was made of titanium. Radar absorbing material was also used to make the aircraft more difficult to detect.\nSR-71 Blackbird used a special fuel called JP-7. Before the flight, the fuel tanks used to leak. This is because at ground altitude the tolerances (distance between parts of the fuel tank) were larger than at the plane's cruising altitude. Once in the air, because of the speed and air resistance, the parts became very hot. Because of this heat, the distance between the parts shrank stopping the loss of fuel.\nThe aircraft also had cameras and radars fitted to take photographs of targets.\nHistory.\nThe first Blackbird flight happened on December 22, 1964 in Palmdale, California. In January 1966, the first aircraft entered service with the USAF. No aircraft were lost in war but one crashed in an accident in 1969. Only 32 aircraft were built. Its final flight was on March 6, 1990, Blackbird S/N 61-7972. The SR-71 program was retired from service in 1998.\nRecords.\nThe aircraft flew at an altitude of over and at speeds over . It held the world record for the jet-powered flight, flying at Mach 3.2. The record was broken in March 2004 by NASA's X-43A aircraft."}

Any star that is plotted in that area is a main-sequence star. The Sun is a main-sequence star. Most of the stars in the Milky Way galaxy and most other galaxies are also main-sequence stars. This is because stars on the main sequence are highly stable, so they remain there a long time.\nHertzsprung-Russell diagrams are graphs that measure each star's brightness against its temperature or color. The main sequence appears as a band going from the upper-left (hot and bright) to the lower-right (cooler and less bright). You can see an example of the band of main-sequence stars to the right.\nStars are created from nebula and first appear on the main sequence. They stay on the main sequence for millions or billions of years. When a star begins to run out of fuel, it gets much bigger and colder and turns into a red giant. After this happens, the star is no longer on the main sequence. It does not spend so much time in its red giant phase.\nIn general, the hottest and brightest stars (in the upper-left of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram) also have the most mass. The main sequence is sometimes divided into two parts. Any star that has a mass greater than 1.5 times the Sun's mass is grouped into the \"upper main sequence\"; any star with a mass lower than 1.5 solar masses belongs to the \"lower main sequence\".\nStars get the energy they produce through nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium. The upper main sequence (hot and bright with the most mass) produces energy by one type of nuclear fusion involving only hydrogen and helium. The lower main sequence (cooler and less bright with a lower mass) produces energy by another type of nuclear fusion. This type uses other elements (for example, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen) with higher atomic numbers as nuclear catalysts.\nBecause of these different types of fusion, stars on the lower main sequence last much longer than stars on the upper main sequence. Our Sun is located on the lower main sequence and is predicted to last between 10 and 12 billion years. A star located on the upper main sequence may only last a few million years.\nNowadays, a new star may be classified as main sequence just by its color. A main sequence star of a particular color has a narrow band of brightness when seen from a standard distance. An astronomer could calculate the distance to this newly-discovered star by comparing its brightness as seen from Earth against the brightness for a certain color on the main sequence."}

Two main ways to measure these objects are proper motion and parallax.\nProper motion is an object\u2019s change in position over time when seen from the Earth. Just like anything else that moves, a star's proper motion is measured by looking towards the same place at different times and seeing how far the star has moved. The difference with stars is that, from Earth, they seem to move very slowly so we have to measure in arcseconds per year. When a star has a large proper motion, it usually means that it is nearby. Barnard\u2019s Star, the star with the largest proper motion, only moves 1 degree across the sky (3600 arcseconds) in 348 years.\nParallax is the apparent difference in position of an object when seen from two or more different places. When an object is seen from a new place, there is a new line of sight going from the viewer to the object showing a different background in the distance. Parallax is measured using the angle between two lines of sight.\nParallax can also be used to measure distances to the nearest few thousand stars. These distances are measured in parsecs which are equal to about 3.26 light years."}

He was one of the most important jazz bandleaders of his time. He led his popular Count Basie Orchestra for almost 50 years. Many important musicians came to became popular and successful with his help, like tenor saxophonists Lester Young and Herschel Evans, trumpeters Buck Clayton and Harry \"Sweets\" Edison and singers Jimmy Rushing and Joe Williams. Basie's famous songs were \"One O'Clock Jump\" and \"April In Paris\".\nEarly life.\nWilliam James Basie was born in 1904 in New Jersey. His parents were Harvey Lee Basie and Lillian Ann Childs, who lived on Mechanic Street in Red Bank, New Jersey. His father worked as a coachman and caretaker for a rich judge. After automobiles (cars) became more popular than using horses to get around, his father became a groundskeeper and handyman for some families in the area. His mother was a piano player and she gave Basie his first piano lessons. To earn money, she took in laundry to wash and baked cakes for sale.\nBasie was not very interested in school. He dreamed of a traveling, inspired by the carnivals which came to town. He only got as far as junior high school. He helped out at the Palace theater in Red Bank, to get into the shows for free. He also learned to use the spotlights for the vaudeville shows. One day, when the pianist did not arrive in time for the show, Basie played instead. He soon learned to improvise music for silent movies.\nBasie was very good at the piano, but he liked drums better. There was another drummer in Red Bank who was better, called Sonny Greer, so Basie stopped playing drums and just played piano. They played together until Greer started his professional career. Basie played with different groups for dances, resorts, and amateur shows, like Harry Richardson\u2019s \"Kings of Syncopation\". When he was not playing a gig, he spent time at the local pool hall with other musicians. He got some jobs in Asbury Park, playing at the Hong Kong Inn, until a better player took his place.\nEarly career.\nAround 1924, Basie went to Harlem, New York City. A lot of jazz was being played there. He liced down the block from the Alhambra Theater. Soon after he went to Harlem, he met Sonny Greer again, who was now the drummer for the Washingtonians, Duke Ellington's early band. Soon, Basie met many Harlem musicians, like Willie \"the Lion\" Smith and James P. Johnson.\nBasie toured in some acts between 1925 and 1927, as a soloist and accompanist to blues singers Katie Krippen and Gonzelle White. He went to Kansas City, St. Louis, New Orleans, and Chicago. He met many great jazz musicians, like Louis Armstrong.\nBack in Harlem in 1925, Basie got his first regular job at Leroy\u2019s, a place known for its piano players, where lots of celebrities went. The band usually played without sheet music. He met Fats Waller, who was playing organ at the Lincoln Theater, accompanying silent movies, and Waller taught him how to play the organ. Willie \"the Lion\" Smith helped Basie out when there was not much work, arranging gigs at house-rent parties, where he met other important musicians.\nIn 1928 Basie was in Tulsa and heard Walter Page and his Famous Blue Devils, one of the first big bands, which had Jimmy Rushing singing. A few months later, Basie was asked to join the band, which played mostly in Texas and Oklahoma. He began to be known as \"Count\" Basie.\nKansas City years.\nIn 1929, Basie started playing with the Bennie Moten band, Kansas City. The Moten band was classier and more respected than the Blue Devils. They played in a style called the Kansas City stomp. As well as playing piano, Basie also arranged music with Eddie Durham. When they were staying in Chicago, Basie recorded with the band. He sometimes played four-hand piano and dual pianos with Moten. The band got better when they added a saxophone player called Ben Webster.\nThe band voted Moten out and Basie became the leader. The band was now called \"Count Basie and his Cherry Blossoms\". Later he went to join Moten's new band. Moten died in 1935 and the band did not stay together. Basie made a new band, which included many of the musicians from Moten's band. Lester Young, a saxophone player, also joined. They played at the Reno Club and sometimes on local radio. One night the band started improvising a piece which Basie called \"One O'Clock Jump\". It became his signature tune."}

{"id": "198083", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=198083", "title": "The West Wing", "text": "The West Wing is an American television drama created by Aaron Sorkin that was originally shown from September 22, 1999 to May 14, 2006. The series is set in the West Wing of the White House\u2014where the Oval Office and offices of presidential staff are\u2014during the fictional presidency of Josiah Bartlet (played by Martin Sheen).\nIt first aired on NBC in 1999, and has been shown on many networks in several other countries. The series ended its seven years on television on May 14, 2006.\nThe show received positive reviews from critics, political science teachers, and former White House workers. In total, \"The West Wing\" won three Golden Globe Awards and 27 Emmy Awards, including the award for Outstanding Drama Series, which it won four times in a row from 2000 through 2003. The show's ratings were lower in later years, series creator Aaron Sorkin (who wrote or co-wrote 85 of the first 88 episodes) left the show after the fourth season. It was still popular with viewers who have a high-income.\nCrew.\nThe series was created by Aaron Sorkin. Sorkin served as executive producer for the first episode with director Thomas Schlamme and John Wells. Kristin Harms and Llewellyn Wells were producers for the first episode. Michael Hissrich acted as a co-producer.\nThe first season proper saw the return of all of the pilot production team along with the addition of Ron Osborn and Jeff Reno as consulting producers and Rick Cleveland as a second co-producer with Robert W. Glass as an associate producer. Glass left the production team after only five episodes. Osborn and Reno departed after nine episodes. Paul Redford served as a story editor throughout the first season. Lawrence O'Donnell, Jr. worked as executive story editor for the second half of the season.\nWith the second season Kevin Falls became a co-executive producer. Cleveland left the production team and Redford and O'Donnell were promoted to co-producer. Peter Parnell, and Patrick Caddell became co-producers and Julie Herlocker and Mindy Kanaskie became associate producers. O'Donnell was promoted again to producer five episodes into the season and Hissrich joined him twelve episodes into the season.\nThe third season saw the departure of Parnell, Caddell, and Herlocker and the temporary absence of O'Donnell. Director Christopher Misiano became a supervising producer and Patrick Ward came aboard as an associate producer. Redford was promoted to producer. With the thirteenth episode of the third season director Alex Graves became an additional supervising producer and Eli Attie joined the writing staff as a story editor.\nThe fourth season marked the temporary departure of Hissrich. Misiano and Graves became co-executive producers alongside Falls. Attie was promoted to executive story editor and Debora Cahn became a staff writer. The fourteenth episode of the season saw Redford promoted to supervising producer and Kanaskie, Ward and Attie promoted to co-producers.\nThe fifth season saw the departure of both Sorkin and Schlamme as executive producers. Schlamme remained attached to the series as an executive consultant. John Wells remained the sole executive producer and showrunner. Co-executive producer Kevin Falls also left the show. O'Donnell rejoined the production team as a consulting producer. Wells also added Carol Flint, Alexa Junge, Peter Noah and John Sacret Young as consulting producers. Andrew Stearn came aboard as a producer and Attie was promoted to producer. Cahn became story editor and Josh Singer replaced her as staff writer. With the tenth episode Flint, Junge, Noah and Sacret Young became supervising producers.\nWith the sixth season Misiano and Graves were promoted to executive producers. Redford and Junge left the production team and Dylan K. Massin became a co-producer. Cahn was promoted to executive story editor and Singer replaced her as story editor. Lauren Schmidt filled the staff writer role. The fourth episode saw the departure of original crew member Llewellyn Wells. Debora Cahn was promoted to co-producer with the fourteenth episode.\nThe seventh season saw Noah and O'Donnell promoted again, this time becoming additional executive producers. Attie became a supervising producer. Hissrich returned to his role as producer for the final season.\nCast.\n\"The West Wing\" employed a broad ensemble cast to portray the many positions involved in the daily work of the federal government. The President, the First Lady, and the President's senior staff and advisors form the core cast. Many secondary characters, appearing intermittently, complement storylines that generally revolve around this core group.\nEach of the main actors made about $75,000 an episode, with Sheen's most recently confirmed salary being $300,000. Rob Lowe also had a six-figure salary, reported to be $100,000, because his character originally was supposed to have a more central role. Disparities in cast salaries led to very public contract disputes, particularly by Janney, Schiff, Spencer, and Whitford. During contract negotiations in 2001, the four were threatened with breach of contract suits by Warner Bros. However, by banding together, they were able to persuade the studio to more than double their salaries. Two years later, the four again demanded a doubling of their salaries, a few months after Warner Bros. had signed new licensing deals with NBC and Bravo.\nJohn Spencer, who played Leo McGarry, died from a heart attack on December 16, 2005\u00a0\u2014 about a year after his character experienced a nearly fatal heart attack on the show. A brief memorial message from Martin Sheen ran before \"Running Mates\", the first new episode that aired after Spencer's death. The loss of Spencer's character was addressed by the series beginning with the episode \"Election Day\", which aired on April 2, 2006.\nDifferent performers had been originally considered for many of the roles. Bradley Whitford states in an interview on the Season 1 DVD that he was originally cast as Sam, though the character of Josh was the role Whitford had wanted and for which he had auditioned. In addition, Josh's character had been written specifically for him by Aaron Sorkin. In the same interview, Janel Moloney states that she had originally auditioned for the role of C.J., and that the role she eventually received, Donna, was not meant to be a recurring character. Other actors who were seriously considered included Alan Alda and Sidney Poitier for the President, Judd Hirsch for Leo, Eugene Levy for Toby, and CCH Pounder for C.J.\nPlot.\n\"The West Wing\", like many serial dramas, stretches storylines over several episodes or entire seasons. In addition to these larger storylines, each episode also contains smaller arcs which usually begin and end within an episode.\nMost episodes follow President Bartlet and his staff through particular legislative or political issues. Plots can range from behind-closed-doors negotiating with Congress (\"Five Votes Down\") to personal issues like sex (\"Pilot\", \"Take out the Trash Day\") and personal drug use (a major plotline throughout the first and second seasons). The typical episode loosely follows the president and his staff through their day, generally following several plots connected by some idea or theme. A large, fully connected set of the White House allows the producers to create shots with very few cuts and long, continuous master shots of staff members walking and talking through the hallways. These \"walk and talks\" became a trademark of the show. The final two seasons presented a narrative change, with the focus of the show divided between plots in the West Wing with President Bartlet and his remaining senior staffers and plots revolving around the rest of the main cast on the campaign trail for the 2006 election.\nDevelopment.\nThe series developed following the success of 1995 theatrical film \"The American President\", for which Aaron Sorkin wrote the screenplay, and Martin Sheen played the White House Chief of Staff. Sorkin used some of the same research he had done for \"The American President\" a suggestion from a friend to create \"The West Wing\". \nAccording to the DVD commentary, Sorkin intended to center the show on Sam Seaborn and the other senior staff with the president in an unseen or a secondary role. However, Bartlet's screen time gradually increased, and his role expanded as the series progressed. Positive critical and public reaction to Sheen's performance raised his character's profile, decreasing Lowe's perceived significance. In addition, according to Sorkin, the storylines began to focus less on Sam and more on Josh Lyman, the deputy chief of staff. This shift is one of the reasons for Lowe's eventual departure from the show in the fourth season.\nFor the first four seasons, Sorkin wrote almost every episode of the series, occasionally reusing plot elements, episode titles, character names, and actors from his previous work, \"Sports Night\", a sitcom in which he began to develop his signature dialogue style of rhythmic, snappy, and intellectual banter. Fellow executive producer and director Thomas Schlamme championed the \"walk and talk,\" a continuous shot tracking in front of the characters as they walk from one place to another that became part of \"The West Wing\"'s signature visual style. Sorkin's hectic writing schedule often led to cost overruns and schedule slips, and he opted to leave the show after the fourth season, following increasing personal problems, including an arrest for possession of illegal drugs. Thomas Schlamme also left the show after the fourth season. John Wells, the remaining executive producer, took the helm after their departure.\nThe show aired its series finale on Sunday, May 14, 2006. It had suffered a significant ratings fall after being placed in the same timeslot as ABC's Top 20 hit \"\", and CBS' Top 30 hit \"Cold Case\".\nCritical reactions.\n\"The West Wing\" offers a rare glimpse into the inner workings of the White House, and the show's legitimacy, political slant, and film merits have generated considerable discussion.\nRealism.\n\"The West Wing\" is not completely accurate in its portrayal of the actual West Wing; however, former White House staffers agree that the show \"captures the feel [of the West Wing], shorn of a thousand undramatic details.\"\nFormer White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers as well as expert pollster Patrick Caddell served as consultants for the show from the beginning, helping writers and actors depict the West Wing accurately. Other former White House staffers, such as Peggy Noonan and Gene Sperling, have served as consultants for brief periods.\nA documentary special in the third season compared the show's depiction of the West Wing to the real thing. Many former West Wing denizens applauded the show's depiction of the West Wing, including advisor David Gergen, Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, Chief of Staff Leon Panetta, Deputy Chief of Staff Karl Rove, and former Presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, and Bill Clinton.\nWhile critics often praised \"The West Wing\" for its writing, others faulted the show as unrealistically optimistic. A large part of this criticism came from the perceived naivet\u00e9 of the characters. Television critic Heather Havrilesky asked \"What rock did these morally pure creatures crawl out from under and, more important, how do you go from innocent millipede to White House staffer without becoming soiled or disillusioned by the dirty realities of politics along the way?\"\nSocial impact.\nDespite acclaim for the veracity of the series, Sorkin believed, \"our responsibility is to captivate you for however long we've asked for your attention.\" Former White House aide Matthew Miller noted that Sorkin \"captivates viewers by making the human side of politics more real than life\u00a0\u2014 or at least more real than the picture we get from the news.\" Miller also noted that by portraying politicians with empathy, the show created a \"subversive competitor\" to the cynical views of politics in media. In the essay \"\"The West Wing\" and the West Wing\", author Myron Levine agreed, stating that the series \"presents an essentially positive view of public service and a healthy corrective to anti-Washington stereotypes and public cynicism.\"\nDr. Staci L. Beavers, associate professor of political science at California State University, San Marcos, wrote a short essay, \"The West Wing as a Pedagogical Tool\", concerning the viability of \"The West Wing\" as a teaching tool. She concluded, \"While the series\u2019 purpose is for-profit entertainment, \"The West Wing\" presents great pedagogical potential.\" \"The West Wing\", in her opinion, gave greater depth to the political process usually espoused only in stilted talking points on shows like \"Face the Nation\" and \"Meet the Press\". However, the merits of a particular argument may be obscured by the viewer's opinion of the character. Beavers also noted that characters with opposing viewpoints were often set up to be \"bad people\" in the viewer's eyes. These characters were assigned undesirable characteristics having nothing to do with their political opinions, such as being romantically involved with a main character's love interest. In Beavers's opinion, a critical analysis of the show's political views can present a worthwhile learning experience to the viewer.\nOne of the stranger impacts of the show occurred on January 31, 2006, when \"The West Wing\" was said to have played a hand in defeating Tony Blair's government in the British House of Commons, during the so called \"\"West Wing\" Plot\". The plan was allegedly hatched after a Conservative Member of Parliament watched the episode, \"A Good Day\", in which Democrats block a bill aimed at limiting stem cell research, by hiding in an office until the Republican Speaker calls the vote.\n\"The Left Wing\".\n\"The West Wing\" was sometimes called \"The Left Wing\" by detractors because of its portrayal of an ideal liberal administration and its alleged demonization of conservatives. Chris Lehmann, senior editor of Washington Post Bookworld, characterized the show as a revisionist look at the Clinton presidency: an attempt to solidify the Clinton legacy and to make America forget the Whitewater and Lewinsky scandals. On the other hand, some Republicans have admired the show since its inception, before even the departure of Sorkin and the show's resulting shift toward the center. In his 2001 article \"Real Liberals versus the \"West Wing\"\", Mackubin Thomas Owens wrote,\nJournalist Matthew Miller wrote, \"although the show indeed has a liberal bias on issues, it presents a truer, more human picture of the people behind the headlines than most of today's Washington journalists.\"\nFilming techniques and reactions.\nIn its first season, \"The West Wing\" attracted critical attention in the television community with a record nine Emmy wins. The show has been praised for its high production values and repeatedly recognized for its cinematic achievements. With a budget of $6 million per episode, many consider each week's show to be a small feature film. However, many in the television community believe that the true genius of the show was Sorkin's rapid-fire and witty scripts.\n\"The West Wing\" is noted for developing the \"walk-and-talk\"\u2014long Steadicam tracking shots showing characters walking down hallways while involved in long conversations. In a typical \"walk-and-talk\" shot, the camera leads two characters down a hallway as they speak to each other. One of these characters generally breaks off and the remaining character is then joined by another character, who initiates another conversation as they continue walking. These \"walk-and-talks\" create a dynamic feel for what would otherwise be long expository dialogue, and have become a staple for dialogue-intensive television show scenes.\nAwards.\nIn its first year, \"The West Wing\" received nine Emmys, a record for most won by a series in a single season. The show also received the Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series in 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003, tying \"Hill Street Blues\" and \"L.A. Law\" for most won in this category. Each of its seven seasons was nominated for the award. \"The West Wing\" ranks 8th all-time in number of Emmy Awards won by a show.\nThe show shares the Emmy Award record for most acting nominations by regular cast members for a single show in one year. (Both \"Hill Street Blues\" and \"L.A. Law\" also hold that record). For the 2001\u20132002 season nine cast members were nominated for Emmys. Allison Janney, John Spencer and Stockard Channing each won an Emmy (for Lead Actress, Supporting Actor and Supporting Actress). The others nominated were Martin Sheen (for Lead Actor), Richard Schiff, Dule Hill and Bradley Whitford (for Supporting Actor), and Janel Moloney and Mary-Louise Parker (for Supporting Actress). In that same year, Mark Harmon, Tim Matheson and Ron Silver were each nominated in the Guest Actor category (but none won the award). This gave the show an Emmy Award record for most acting nominations total (including guest performer category) in a single year, with 12 acting nominations.\nTwenty Emmys were awarded to writers, actors, and crew members. Allison Janney is the record holder for most wins by a cast member, with a total of four Emmys.\nIn addition to its Emmys, the show won two Screen Actors Guild (SAG) Awards, in 2000 and 2001, for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series. Martin Sheen is the only cast member to have won a Golden Globe, and he and Allison Janney are the only cast members to win a SAG award (for best actor and best actress). In both 1999 and 2000, \"The West Wing\" was awarded the Peabody Award for excellence in broadcasting.\nThis table shows award wins by cast members:\nW.G. \"Snuffy\" Walden received an Emmy Award for Main Title Theme Music in 2000 for \"The West Wing Opening Theme\".\nMany cast members have been Emmy-nominated for their work on \"The West Wing\" but have not won, including Martin Sheen\u2014who was nominated each year for all seven seasons of the series without receiving the award\u2014as well as Janel Moloney, who was nominated twice, and Dul\u00e9 Hill, Rob Lowe, and Mary-Louise Parker, who were all nominated once. Matthew Perry, Oliver Platt, Ron Silver, Tim Matheson, and Mark Harmon have also received Emmy nominations for guest starring on the show.\nExploration of real world issues.\n\"The West Wing\" often features extensive discussion of current or recent political issues. After the real-world election of Republican President George W. Bush in 2000, many wondered whether the liberal show could retain its relevance and topicality. However, by exploring many of the same issues facing the Bush administration from a Democratic point of view, the show continued to appeal to a broad audience of both Democrats and Republicans.\nIn its second season episode \"The Midterms\", President Bartlet admonishes fictional radio host Dr. Jenna Jacobs for her views regarding homosexuality at a private gathering at the White House. Dr. Jacobs is a caricature of radio personality Dr. Laura Schlessinger, who strongly disapproves of homosexuality. Many of the president's biblical references in his comments to Dr. Jacobs appear to have come from an open letter to Dr. Schlessinger, circulated online in early May 2000.\nThe Bartlet administration experiences a scandal during the second and third seasons that has been compared to the Monica Lewinsky affair. President Bartlet was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) in 1992. The scandal centers around President Bartlet's nondisclosure of his illness to the electorate during the election. He is investigated by an opposition Congress for defrauding the public and eventually accepts Congressional censure. Multiple sclerosis advocacy groups have praised the show for its accurate portrayal of the symptoms of MS and stressing that it is not fatal. The National MS Society commented:\nFollowing the September 11, 2001 attacks, the start of the third season was postponed for a week, as were most American television premieres that year. A script for a special episode was quickly written and began filming on September 21. The episode \"Isaac and Ishmael\" aired on October 3 and addresses the sobering reality of terrorism in America and the wider world, albeit with no specific reference to September 11. While \"Isaac and Ishmael\" received mixed critical reviews, it illustrated the show's flexibility in addressing current events. The cast of the show state during the opening of the episode that it is not part of \"The West Wing\" continuity.\nWhile the September 11 attacks do not occur in \"The West Wing\" continuity, the country does enter into a variation of the War on Terrorism. The war begins during the show's third season, when a plot to blow up the Golden Gate Bridge was uncovered; in response, the President orders the assassination of terrorist leader Abdul ibn Shareef. This storyline draws similarities to the real-world U.S. invasion of Afghanistan as well as U.S. relations with Saudi Arabia, as it brings the Middle East to the forefront of U.S. foreign relations and elevated terrorism as a serious threat in \"The West Wing\" universe. In Seasons 3, 4 and 5, the fictional Bahji terror group seems to act as a fictional stand-in for the real world Al Qaeda, but in Seasons 6 and 7, characters mention Al Qaeda itself as a threat, despite no clearly stated history of Al Qaeda terror attacks in \"The West Wing\" continuity (although Nancy McNally does refer to Osama Bin Laden as a potential threat at the beginning of Season 2.)\nIn the middle of the fourth season, Bartlet's White House is confronted with the genocide in the fictional African country of Equatorial Kundu which was compared to the Rwandan Genocide of 1994. The result was new foreign policy doctrine for Bartlet Administration and military intervention to stop the violence, which came after much hesitation and reluctance to call the conflict a genocide. In reality, the Clinton Administration didn't intervene in Rwanda, making series events look like a moral imperative.\nIn the sixth and seventh seasons, \"The West Wing\" explores a leak of top-secret information by a senior staffer at the White House. This leak has been compared to the events surrounding the Valerie Plame affair. In the storyline, the International Space Station is damaged and can no longer produce oxygen for the astronauts to breathe. With no other methods of rescue available, the president is reminded of the existence of a top-secret military space shuttle. Following the president's inaction, the shuttle story is leaked to a White House reporter, Greg Brock (analogous to Judith Miller), who prints the story in \"The New York Times\". Brock will not reveal his source and goes to jail for failing to do so, as did Miller. In order to stop the investigation, in which authorities suspect Chief of Staff C.J. Cregg, Toby Ziegler admits leaking the information, and the President is forced to dismiss him. In comparison, the Plame affair resulted in the arrest and conviction of Lewis Libby, the vice president's chief of staff. However, Libby was convicted of perjury in testimony to a grand jury. No one was convicted for \"blowing the cover\" of Plame. (Richard Armitage, an official in the Bush State Department, acknowledged leaking information about Plame to reporters but was never charged with a crime.) Libby's two and a half year prison sentence was later commuted by President Bush, though the other facet of his sentence ($250,000 fine) stands until Libby's appeals were to be considered.\nOther issues explored in \"The West Wing\" include:\n\"The West Wing\" universe.\nDomestic.\nAll contemporary domestic government officials in \"The West Wing\" universe have been fictional. President Bartlet has made three appointments to the fictional Supreme Court and maintains a full cabinet, although the names and terms of all members have not been revealed. Some cabinet members, such as the Secretary of Defense, appear more often than others. Many other government officials, such as mayors, governors, judges, representatives, and senators, have been mentioned and seen as well.\nFictional locations inside the United States have been created to loosely represent certain places:\nSan Andreo.\nSan Andreo is a fictional California city. It is near San Diego. It has 42,000 people. The San Andreo Nuclear Generating Station is there.\nA near meltdown at the nuclear plant becomes the focus of an October surprise for Republican nominee Senator Arnold Vinick during the 2006 presidential election, due to Vinick's strong pro-nuclear stance and revelations of his active lobbying for the construction of the plant. This was seen to be a key factor in Vinick's narrow defeat in the election by Democratic nominee Congressman Matt Santos.\nHartsfield's Landing.\nHartsfield's Landing is a fictional town in New Hampshire. It is stated to be a very small community of only 63 people, of whom 42 are registered voters, that votes at one minute past midnight on the day of the New Hampshire primary, hours before the rest of the state, and has accurately predicted the winner of every presidential election since William Howard Taft in 1908. It is based on the true New Hampshire communities of Hart's Location and Dixville Notch, which in real life do vote before the rest of the state during the primaries, and also loosely upon the concept of \"bellwether states\" in US presidential elections.\nKennison State University.\nKennison State is a fictional university in Iowa that was used as the setting of a bombing in the beginning of the fourth season.\nForeign.\nWhile several real-world leaders exist in the show's universe, most foreign countries have fictional rulers. Real people mentioned in \"The West Wing\" include Muammar al-Gaddafi, Yasser Arafat, Fidel Castro, Queen Elizabeth II, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, King Carl Gustaf, Thabo Mbeki and Osama bin Laden. However, when a peace accord was worked out between Israel and the Palestinian Authority at the start of the show's sixth season, the Chairman of the Palestinian Authority was the fictional Nizar Farad, not Arafat. (By that time in the real world, Arafat was dead and a successor, Rawhi Fattuh, had been elected.)\nEntire countries are invented as composite pictures that epitomize many of the problems that plague real nations in certain areas of the world:\nQumar.\nQumar, a fictional oil-rich, terrorist-sponsoring Middle Eastern state, is repeatedly a source of trouble for the Bartlet administration. According to maps on the show, Qumar is in southern Iran, directly across the important Strait of Hormuz. After the September 11 attacks, it became the main venue for the show's terrorism subplots.\nJabal Nafusah (also the name of a real-life Libyan city) seems to be the largest city and the capital, according to maps shown of the country. Qumar is an absolute monarchy, ruled by a sultan and his family. The country is a former British protectorate. The nation was first introduced in the third season where it was mentioned as a close ally of the United States. Qumar continues on the show to be a U.S. ally, though the sultan and other officials were extremely troubled by the Bartlet administration's assassination of Defense Minister Abdul ibn Shareef, and a bombing campaign and invasion that followed Zoey Bartlet's abduction by Qumari extremists (ostensibly in retaliation for Shareef's murder). As a result of the air strikes, gas pipelines were damaged, leading to economic troubles for the country and its European allies.\nDuring the final season episode \"The Cold\", a situation room map shows the Persian Gulf clearly, but omits Qumar.\nEquatorial Kundu.\nEquatorial Kundu is a fictional African nation blighted by AIDS and a civil war resembling the 1994 Rwandan genocide.\nWhen Kundu was first mentioned in season 2, it is led by President Nimbala who is executed by the end of the episode. In January 2003 of the series' timeline (\"Inauguration, Part I\"), the Arkutu-run government of President Nzele (described as a \"sadistic madman\") begins an ethnic cleansing campaign against the Induye in Bitanga, killing 200 people. The violence soon spreads outside Bitanga and into the countryside. In President Josiah Bartlet's second inaugural address (\"Inauguration Over There\"), he announces the new Bartlet Doctrine for the use of force: America shall intervene whenever there are humanitarian interests at stake. With that new doctrine, Bartlet sends a brigade of the 82nd Airborne Division, the 101st Airborne Division, and a Marine Expeditionary Unit, a force of 11,000 troops in total, to Kundu (\"The California 47th\"). As of the episode \"Twenty Five,\" US forces are still operating in Kundu.\nIn its original appearance, Kundu's location is somewhat ambiguous. President Nimbala and his aide appear to speak Setswana, a Bantu language spoken in South Africa and Botswana, which would imply a Southern African setting. The Season 4 appearance seems to more firmly place the country in West Africa, near to the Ivory Coast and Ghana. Its capital city is Bitanga, which contains a major airport, TV station and a radio station.\nPresidential elections.\nFictional timeline.\nIn general, \"The West Wing\" attempts to create an alternative reality, in which there is a subtly different set of historical truths in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. In particular, the show tries to suggest that the last \"real\" president in its timeline is Richard Nixon, and to chart the careers of its principal players in the light of that decision. Nevertheless, there are occasions in which more contemporary presidents are implied.\nHowever, through timeline analysis, it can be assumed that while Richard Nixon was the last President to hold a real-life presidential term, Ronald Reagan was the last real-life President. These are the Presidents and their terms in the West Wing universe:\nSkewed from reality.\nFictional Presidents who served between Nixon and Bartlet include one-term Democrat D. Wire Newman (James Cromwell) and two-term Republican Owen Lassiter.\nLeo McGarry is mentioned as being Labor Secretary in the administration that was in office in 1993 and 1995. In the first season, an outgoing Supreme Court Justice tells President Bartlet that he had been wanting to retire for 5 years, but waited \"for a Democrat.\" The season four episode \"Debate Camp\" features a flashback to the days just before Bartlet's inauguration, as Donna Moss meets with her Republican predecessor, Jeff Johnson, who makes it clear that the outgoing Republican administration has been in office for eight years. In season six Leo says that the Republicans have been \"out of power for eight years\", and Republicans at their convention say \"eight (years) is enough\".\nThe passage of time on the show relative to that of the real world is somewhat ambiguous when marked by events of shorter duration (e.g., votes, campaigns). Sorkin has noted in a DVD commentary track for the second season episode \"18th and Potomac\" that he has tried to avoid tying \"The West Wing\" to a specific period of time. Despite this, real years are occasionally mentioned, usually in the context of elections and President Bartlet's two-term administration.\nThe show's presidential elections are held in 2002 and 2006, which are the years of the midterm elections in reality. The election timeline in \"The West Wing\" matches up with that of the real world until early in the sixth season, when it appears that a year is lost. For example, the filing deadline for the New Hampshire primary, which would normally fall in January 2006, appears in an episode airing in January 2005.\nIn an interview, John Wells stated that the series began one and a half years into Bartlet's first term and that the election to replace Bartlet was being held at the correct time.\nIn the season 5 episode \"Access\", it is mentioned that the Casey Creek crisis occurred during Bartlet's first term, and network footage of the crisis carries the date of November 2001.\n1998 presidential election.\nBartlet's first campaign for president is never significantly explored in the series. Bartlet won the election with 48% of the popular vote, 48 million votes, and a 303\u2013235 margin in the Electoral College. Bartlet faced three debates with his Republican opponent, who is assumed to be Lewis D. Eisenhower, the Vice President under Owen Lassiter and an immediate relative to former President Dwight D. Eisenhower. It is mentioned that Bartlet won the third and final debate, which was held eight days before election day in St. Louis, Missouri, and that this helped swing a close election in his favor. Josh Lyman said in the days prior to the election \"Bartlet was punching brick walls\" as the result seemed too close to call, before the result broke his way. Leo McGarry said the same thing in \"Bartlet for America\" when he said \"It was eight days to go, and we were too close to call\".\nThe campaign for the Democratic nomination is extensively addressed. In the episodes \"In the Shadow of Two Gunmen\" and \"Bartlet for America\", flashbacks are used to tell how Bartlet defeated Texas Senator John Hoynes (Tim Matheson) and Washington Senator William Wiley for the Democratic nomination. The flashbacks also reveal how Leo McGarry persuaded Bartlet, who was then governor of New Hampshire, to run for president and how Bartlet ultimately selected John Hoynes as his choice as running mate.\n2002 presidential election.\n\"The West Wing\"'s 2002 presidential election pits Bartlet and Vice President John Hoynes against Florida Governor Robert Ritchie (James Brolin) and his running mate, Jeff Heston. Bartlet faces no known opposition for renomination, though Democratic Senator Stackhouse does launch a brief independent campaign for the presidency. Ritchie, not originally expected to contend for the nomination, emerges from a field of seven other Republican candidates by appealing to the party's conservative base with simple, \"homey\" sound bites.\nBartlet's staff contemplates replacing Vice President John Hoynes on the ticket with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Percy Fitzwallace (John Amos), among others. After it is clear that Ritchie will be the Republican nominee, Bartlet dismisses the idea, declaring that he wants Hoynes in the number two spot because of \"four words,\" which he writes down and hands to his staffers to read: \"Because I could die.\"\nThroughout the season it is anticipated that the race will be close, but a stellar performance by Bartlet in the sole debate between the candidates helps give Bartlet a landslide victory in both the popular and electoral vote.\n2006 presidential election.\nA speed-up in \"The West Wing\"'s timeline, in part due to the expiration of many cast members' contracts and a desire to continue the program with lower production costs, resulted in the omission of the 2004 midterm elections and an election during the seventh season. The sixth season extensively details the Democratic and Republican primaries. The seventh season covers the lead-up to the general election, the election, and the transition to a new administration. The timeline slows down to concentrate on the general election race. The election, normally held in November, takes place across two episodes originally broadcast on April 2 and April 9, 2006.\nCongressman Matt Santos (D-TX) (Jimmy Smits) is nominated on the fourth ballot at the Democratic National Convention, during the sixth season finale. Santos was planning to leave Congress before being recruited to run for the presidency by Josh Lyman. Santos polled in the low single digits in the Iowa caucus and was virtually out of the running in the New Hampshire primary before a last-ditch direct television appeal vaults him to a third-place finish with 19% of the vote. Josh Lyman, Santos's campaign manager, convinces Leo McGarry to become Santos' running mate.\nSenator Arnold Vinick (R-CA) (Alan Alda) secures the Republican nomination, defeating Glen Allen Walken (John Goodman) and the Reverend Don Butler (Don S. Davis), among others. Initially, Vinick wants Butler to become his running mate. However, Butler does not want to be considered because of Vinick's stance on abortion. Instead, West Virginia Governor Ray Sullivan (Brett Cullen) is chosen as Vinick's running mate. Vinick is portrayed throughout the sixth season as virtually unbeatable because of his popularity in California, a typically Democratic state, his moderate views, and his wide crossover appeal. Vinick, however, faces difficulty with the pro-life members of his party as a pro-choice candidate, and criticism for his support of nuclear power following a serious accident at a Californian nuclear power station.\nOn the evening of the election, Leo McGarry suffers a massive heart attack and is pronounced dead at the hospital, with the polls still open on the West Coast. The Santos campaign releases the information immediately, while Arnold Vinick refuses to use Leo's death as a \"stepstool\" to the presidency. Santos emerges as the winner in his home state of Texas, while Vinick wins his home state of California. The election comes down to Nevada, where both candidates need a victory to secure the presidency. Vinick tells his staff repeatedly that he will not allow his campaign to demand a recount of the votes if Santos is declared the winner. Josh Lyman is seen giving Santos the same advice, although the Santos campaign does send a team of lawyers down to Nevada. Santos is pronounced the winner of the election, having won Nevada by 30,000 votes, with an electoral margin of 272\u2013266.\nSantos organizes his administration, choosing Josh Lyman as Chief of Staff, who in turn calls on former colleague Sam Seaborn to be Deputy Chief of Staff. In need of experienced cabinet members, Santos taps Arnold Vinick as Secretary of State, believing the senior statesman to be one of the best strategists available and respected by foreign leaders.\nPresident Bartlet's final act as President of the United States is pardoning Toby Ziegler. The series ends with Bartlet returning to New Hampshire. Having said his goodbyes to his closest staff, former President Bartlet tells President Santos, \"Make me proud, Mr. President\", to which Santos responds, \"I'll do my best, Mr. President.\"\nAccording to executive producer Lawrence O'Donnell, Jr., the writers originally intended for Vinick to win the election. However, the death of Spencer forced him and his colleagues to consider the emotional strain that would result from having Santos lose both his running mate and the election. It was eventually decided that the last episodes would be rescripted by John Wells. Other statements from John Wells, however, have contradicted O'Donnell's claims about a previously planned Vinick victory. The script showing Santos winning was written long before the death of John Spencer. In 2008 O'Donnell stated to camera \"We actually planned at the outset for Jimmy Smits to win, that was our .. just .. plan of how this was all going to work, but the Vinick character came on so strong in the show, and was so effective, it became a real contest ... and it became a real contest in the West Wing writer's room.\"\nSimilarities to 2008 U.S. presidential election.\nSimilarities between the fictional 2006 election and the real-life 2008 U.S. presidential election have been noted in the media: young minority Democratic candidate (Matthew Santos on the show, Barack Obama in real life) has a gruelling but successful primary campaign against a more experienced candidate (Bob Russell on the show, Hillary Clinton in real life) and chooses an experienced Washington insider as his running mate (Leo McGarry on the show, Joe Biden in real life), whereas the Republican contest is determined early in the primary season with an aging maverick senator of a Western state being the nominee (Arnold Vinick on the show, John McCain in real life), defeating an ordained minister as the closest competitor (Reverend Butler on the show, Mike Huckabee in real life), and then selecting a socially conservative running mate from a small Republican state (West Virginia Governor Ray Sullivan on the show, Alaska Governor Sarah Palin in real life).\nWriter Eli Attie called David Axelrod to talk about Obama after Obama's 2004 Democratic National Convention speech and says that he \"drew inspiration from [Obama] in drawing [the Santos] character,\" while actor Jimmy Smits says that Obama \"was one of the people that I looked to draw upon.\" Writer and producer Lawrence O'Donnell says that he partly modeled Vinick after McCain. Obama's Chief of Staff, Rahm Emanuel, is said to be the basis of the Josh Lyman character, who became Santos' Chief of Staff."}

He is a Republican and a Mormon. After the Republicans won control of the Senate during the 2014 midterms, Hatch became President pro tempore on January 6, 2015 after the 114th United States Congress was sworn in.\nOn January 2, 2018, Hatch announced his retirement from the Senate after low approval ratings.\nEarly life.\nHatch was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on March 22, 1934. His parents were Jesse Hatch and Helen Frances. Hatch studied at Brigham Young University and at the University of Pittsburgh. He worked as an attorney in Pittsburgh and in Utah.\nUnited States senator (1977-2019).\nIn 1976, in his first run for public office, Hatch was elected to the United States Senate, defeating Democrat Frank Moss, a three-term incumbent. Among other issues, Hatch criticized Moss' 18-year tenure in the Senate, saying \"What do you call a Senator who's served in office for 18 years? You call him home.\" Hatch argued that many Senators, including Moss, had lost touch with the people who voted for them. Hatch himself has now been in office for 40 years.\nIn 1995 Hatch was the leading figure behind the senate's anti-terrorism bill, to a large extent a response to the Oklahoma City Bombing. As a senior member of the Senate Select Intelligence Committee, Hatch was also instrumental in the 2008 extension of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. He said, \"This bipartisan bill will help defeat terrorism and keep America safe. No, the legislation is not perfect, but it ensures that the increased expansion of the judiciary into foreign intelligence gathering doesn\u2019t unnecessarily hamper our intelligence community.\u201d\nHatch has been a longtime advocate of amending the United States Constitution to require that total spending of the federal government for any fiscal year not exceed total receipts. He proposed the DREAM Act, which would provide a pathway to citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants, who were children when their parents came to the United States.\nSenator Hatch co-sponsored the Restoring the 10th Amendment Act (S. 4020 111th Congress), which would strengthen state rights under the 10th Amendment. The bill would provide special standing for state officials in challenging proposed regulations.\nIn 2018, Hatch announced that he would retire after seven terms in the Senate.\nPossible Supreme Court nomination.\nHatch has long expressed interest in serving on the U.S. Supreme Court, but due to his age decided not to express any interest anymore. It was reported that he was on Ronald Reagan's short list of candidates to succeed Lewis F. Powell, Jr. on the United States Supreme Court, but was passed over at least in part because of the Ineligibility Clause. Despite that, he vocally supported Robert Bork, who was chosen instead. After Bork's and Douglas H. Ginsburg's nominations to the seat faltered, Anthony Kennedy was confirmed to fill the vacancy.\n2000 presidential campaign.\nIn 2000, Hatch made a failed bid for the Republican presidential nomination, losing to then-Texas Governor George W. Bush. During the first Republican debate, Hatch made web usability a campaign issue, a first for a presidential candidate. He claimed his website was more user-friendly than Bush's. At least one web usability expert agreed.\nPersonal life.\nHatch married Elaine Hansen on August 28, 1957. They are the parents of six children.\nHatch is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Hatch serves as a member of the board of directors of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.\nIn November 2018, Hatch received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Donald Trump."}

{"id": "198155", "revid": "7734220", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=198155", "title": "Lichen", "text": "Lichens are a plant that grows on rocks. They are a mixture of two very different things, a fungus and an algae. The fungus lives with the algae, and they trade things with each other. The lichen looks like a plant, but it is not. Botanists did not know this until 1875.\nClassification.\nLichens are made up of three different living things. The fungus gives them their shape and holds them together. The algae gives them their color. The cyanobacteria give them their food. They are all different kinds of living things, so some scientists say they can't be classified together. But some scientists say they can, because they are all living together and they are all doing the same thing. So they have to be the same kind of living thing.20% (one in five) of fungal species live in lichens. Lichen fungi belong to several different groups of fungi. \nMost common (over 40%) are Ascomycetes, which produce spores in a sac-shaped container, the \"ascus\". Only a few types of alga occur within lichens; these algae also have their own names. Algae may be sometimes the dominant partner in so-called 'jelly lichens', \"Collema\" and \"Leptogium\", but this is rare. More usually, the algae are the green alga \"Trebouxia\". Other species are the orange \"Trentepohli\", and the cyanobacterium \"Nostoc\".p9\u201310\nTheir life habit.\nThe life habit of lichens is to stick closely onto surfaces.\nLichens can occur anywhere on land, and some can live in aquatic environments. The nearest rock, wall or roof probably has lichen on it. Often the lichen is mat-like, and clings to the surface. Some are like little bushes: see the photos. Lichens are famous for not needing a regular supply of water; their metabolism can go into suspension, and later revive. When growing on mineral surfaces, some lichens slowly break down the substrate, and extract tiny amounts of mineral nutrient. Fungi form the main part of the thallus (body), with the photobiont contributing 20% or less.p17 The photobiont is usually on the inside of the thallus.\nLichen thalli may grow together and fuse, and this may happen between different species and genera.p23 These are called 'mechanical hybrids'. They get noticed when the two forms are differently colored.\nSurvival.\nLichen do survive extreme conditions. They are found in some of the most extreme places on Earth \u2013 the frozen north, hot deserts, rocky coasts. They are common as epiphytes on leaves and branches in rain forests and temperate woods. They can live on bare rock, walls and gravestones, and on exposed soil surfaces.p19 There are about 200 different kinds of lichens in Antarctica. In the Horlick Mountains, at 86 degrees south, there are six different kinds of lichen. In the Himalayas, they grow at altitudes up to 18,000 feet (~5500m).p216\nThe European Space Agency discovered that lichen can survive unprotected in space. Two species of lichen were sealed in a capsule and launched on a Russian Soyuz rocket. Once in orbit the capsules were opened. Two species of lichen were exposed to the vacuum of space, to cosmic radiation and huge swings of temperature. After 15 days the lichens were retrieved and were found to be in full health: no damage was found.\nRain forests.\nThere are a huge number of lichen species in rainforests, far outnumbering flowering plants. The lichen are mostly epiphytes, living on trees. A single site in Costa Rica yielded about 300 species of lichen on leaves, in the understory of the rain forest; a single fallen \"Elaeocarpus\" tree in New Guinea held 173 species; the evergreen laurel \"Ocotea atirrensis\" was found with 50\u201380 lichen species on a \"single leaf\".p60\u201361\nMutual benefits.\nWhen partnerships are very close, it is difficult to assign benefits to either partner. Their success is as a pair (or trio). Sometimes the partners can exist as separate organisms: certainly their close relatives can. Probably most of the algae and all of the cyanobacteria can survive on their own, though in more restricted habitats. The details vary according to the specific species or strains involved. The man who first realised the nature of lichen, Simon Schwedener, thought of the partnership as one of controlled parasitism. Obviously, the photobiont provides photosynthetic products: carbohydrates as sugar alcohols (green algae) or glucose (cyanobacteria). The bacteria also convert atmospheric nitrogen (N2) to ammonium ions (NH4+) which the fungus can use in amino acids for proteins.p26\nThe alga certainly benefits from a supply of water (which the fungus is good at storing). There is also general mechanical protection. Algae get protection from ultraviolet light, which in some environments is quite significant. Probably, algae get access to the minute amounts of minerals, which the fungus gets from the substrate or from dust settling on the thallus. Algal cells are sometimes destroyed in the course of nutrient exchange, though the algal cells divide and replace them. Above all, the partnership is a resounding success, and gets to places where few plants can survive.\nReproduction.\nMany lichens reproduce without sex (asexual reproduction). They make small groups of algal cells surrounded by fungal filaments. These \"soridia\" can be blown by wind. Some lichens just break up into fragments when they dry. Wind carries the pieces, which grow when moisture returns. Also, lichen fungi can reproduce sexually by forming fruiting bodies containing spores. These fruiting bodies are usually perennial, and may be long-lasting: some in the Swiss Alps have lived for over 50 years. After dispersal by wind, such fungal spores must meet with an algal partner to form a lichen.p19\u201322\nHistory on Earth.\nThe fossil record for lichen dates back 400 million years for certain, and the signs are that earlier forms existed 600 million years ago. They must have been one of the earliest life-forms on land. It is thought, from the number of fungal and algal species involved, that the symbiosis must have taken place many times between different species.p46\nIt has been suggested that some or all of the Ediacaran biota might be lichen. The proposal has been received with some skepticism.\nLichenometry.\nLichenometry is a method of dating exposed rock by using the growth of lichen. It uses an estimate of how long the lichen's radius or width grows over time.\nOther uses.\nMany lichen are sensitive to changes around them. For this reason, they are used by scientists to show changes in the environment, such as air pollution, ozone depletion, and metal contamination. Lichens have also been used to make dyes, perfumes, and herbal medicines.\nSome lichen produce natural antibiotics that kill bacteria. Humans have used these compounds as natural antibiotics. Extracts from many \"Usnea\" species were used to treat wounds in Russia in the mid-twentieth century.\nThe map lichen \"Rhizocarpon geographicum\" grows extremely slowly, and can reach an age of over 1000 years. It may be used for dating: the diameter of the largest lichen of a species on a rock surface shows the time that the rock has been exposed.\nLichen are the main winter food for reindeer. The deer can get at shrubby lichen under the snow. In summer they have much more choice of food. Some lichen are eaten by humans. A kind of lichen, which is called \"Iwatake\" in Japanese and \"Seogi\" in Korean language, is collected from cliffs, and used in various Korean and Japanese foods. Lichen have a high level of acid. Care must be taken, as there are at least two kinds of lichen that are toxic.\nThe bacterial or algal partners produce pigments that absorb sunlight in photosynthesis. There are reports dating back almost 2000 years of purple and red colours being extracted from lichens. Lichens of the family Roccellaceae are commonly called 'orchella weed' . They have been important in history, because they could supply orcein, a dye. \"Rocella tinctoria\" is the source of the pH indicator litmus. Orcein is got by boiling the lichen, and litmus is produced by adding ammonia and air. Orcein is also used as a food dye, with the E number E121.\nToday, dyes based on lichens have largely been replaced by synthetic ones."}

Nearly all branches of science have helped us understand the main events of the Earth's past, characterized by constant geological change and biological evolution. The geological time scale (GTS), as defined by international convention, depicts the large spans of time from the beginning of the Earth to the present. The Earth is about, approximately one-third the age of the universe, by accretion from the solar nebula.\nHadean.\nOrigin.\nThe formation of Earth occurred as part of the formation of the Solar System. It started as a large rotating cloud of dust and gas. This cloud, the solar nebula, was composed of hydrogen and helium produced in the Big Bang, as well as heavier elements produced in supernovas. Then, about 4.68 billion years ago, the solar nebula began to contract, rotate and gain angular momentum. This may have been triggered by a star in the region exploding as a supernova, and sending a shock wave through the solar nebula.\nAs the cloud rotated, it became a flat disc perpendicular to its axis of rotation. Most of the mass concentrated in the middle and began to heat up. Meanwhile, the rest of the disc began to break up into rings, with gravity causing matter to condense around dust particles. Small fragments collided to become larger fragments, including one collection about from the center: this would become the Earth. As the Sun condensed and heated, nuclear fusion started, and the solar wind cleared out most of the material in the disc, which had not yet condensed, into larger bodies. The same process is expected to produce accretion disks around virtually all newly forming stars in the universe, some of which yield planets.\nMoon.\nThe Earth's relatively large natural satellite, the Moon, is unique. During the Apollo program, rocks from the Moon's surface were brought to Earth. Radiometric dating of these rocks has shown the Moon to be 4527 \u00b1 10 million years old, about 30 to 55 million years younger than other bodies in the solar system. New evidence suggests the Moon formed even later, 4.48\u00b10.02\u200aGa, or 70\u2013110\u200aMa after the start of the Solar System. Another notable feature is the relatively low density of the Moon, which must mean it does not have a large metallic core, like all other terrestrial bodies in the solar system. \nTheories for the formation of the Moon must explain its late formation as well as the following facts. First, the Moon has a low density (3.3 times that of water, compared to 5.5 for the Earth) and a small metallic core. Second, there is virtually no water or other volatiles on the Moon. Third, the Earth and Moon have the same oxygen isotopic signature (relative abundance of the oxygen isotopes). The Moon has a bulk composition closely resembling the Earth's mantle and crust together, without the Earth's core. This has led to the giant impact hypothesis: the idea that the Moon was formed during a giant impact of the proto-Earth with another protoplanet.\nThe impactor, sometimes named Theia, is thought to have been a little smaller than the current planet Mars. Theia finally collided with Earth about 4.533 Ga.\nModels reveal that when an impactor this size struck the proto-Earth at a low angle and relatively low speed (), much material from the mantles (and proto-crusts) of the proto-Earth and the impactor was ejected into space, where much of it stayed in orbit around the Earth. This material would eventually form the Moon. However, the metallic cores of the impactor would have sunk through the Earth's mantle to fuse with the Earth's core, depleting the Moon of metallic material. The giant impact hypothesis thus explains the Moon's abnormal composition. The ejecta in orbit around the Earth could have condensed into a single body within a couple of weeks. Under the influence of its own gravity, the ejected material became a more spherical body: the Moon.\nThe radiometric ages show the Earth existed already for at least 10 million years before the impact, enough time to allow for differentiation of the Earth's primitive mantle and core. Then, when the impact occurred, only material from the mantle was ejected, leaving the Earth's core of heavy elements untouched.\nThe impact had some important consequences for the young Earth. It released an enormous amount of energy, causing both the Earth and Moon to be completely molten. Immediately after the impact, the Earth's mantle was vigorously convecting, the surface was a large magma ocean. The planet's first atmosphere must have been completely blown away by the enormous amount of energy released. The impact is also thought to have changed Earth\u2019s axis to produce the large 23.5\u00b0 axial tilt that is responsible for Earth\u2019s seasons (a simple, ideal model of the planets\u2019 origins would have axial tilts of 0\u00b0 with no recognizable seasons). It may also have sped up Earth\u2019s rotation.\nArchean.\nArchean Earth.\nAt the beginning of the Archean, the Earth's heat flow was nearly three times higher than it is today, and was still twice the current level by the beginning of the Proterozoic. Thus, plates and volcanic activity were considerably more active than they are today; the Earth's crust was not only thinner than is today, but probably broken up into many more tectonic plates, with numerous hot spots, rift valleys, and transform faults. The existence of plate tectonics in this eon is disputed: it is an active area of modern research.p297-302\nThere were no large continents until late in the Archean; small protocontinents were the norm, prevented from coalescing into larger units by the high rate of geologic activity. These felsic protocontinents probably formed at hot spots rather than subduction zones, from a variety of sources: mafic magma melting more felsic rocks, partial melting of mafic rock, and from the metamorphic alteration of felsic sedimentary rocks.p297-301\nThe Archean atmosphere apparently lacked free oxygen. Temperatures appear to have been near modern levels, although astronomers think that the sun was about one-third dimmer. This is thought to reflect larger amounts of greenhouse gases than later in Earth history.\nArchean geology.\nWhen the Archean began, the Earth's heat flow was nearly three times as high as it is today, and it was still twice the current level at the transition from the Archean to the Proterozoic (2,500 Ma). The extra heat was the result of a mix of remnant heat from planetary accretion, from the formation of the metallic core, and from the decay of radioactive elements.\nThe oldest rock formations exposed on the surface of the Earth are Archean or slightly older. Archean rocks are known from Greenland, the Canadian Shield, western Australia, and southern Africa. Although the first continents formed during this eon, rock this age makes up only 7% of the world's current cratons; even allowing for erosion and destruction of past formations, evidence suggests that only 5-40% of the present continental crust formed during the Archean.p301\nIn contrast to the Proterozoic, Archean rocks are often heavily metamorphized deep-water sediments, such as greywackes, mudstones, volcanic sediments, and banded iron formations. Greenstone belts are typical Archean formations: they are made of alternating high and low-grade metamorphic rocks. The high-grade rocks come from volcanic island arcs, and the low-grade metamorphic rocks come from deep-sea sediments. These sediments eroded from the island arcs and ended in a forearc basin. In short, \"greenstone belts show where protocontinents were stuck together\".p302-3\nArchean life.\nThe processes that gave rise to life on Earth are not completely understood, but there is substantial evidence that life came into existence either near the end of the Hadean Eon or early in the Archean Eon.\nThe earliest evidence for life on Earth is graphite of biogenic origin found in 3.7 billion\u2013year-old metasedimentary rocks discovered in Western Greenland. Fossils of cyanobacterial mats (stromatolites) are found throughout the Archean\u2014becoming especially common late in the eon\u2014while a few other probable bacterial fossils are known from chert beds.p307 In addition to bacteria, microfossils of the extremophilic archaea have also been identified.\nLife in the Archean was limited to simple single-celled organisms (lacking nuclei), called prokaryotes. In addition to the domain Bacteria, microfossils of the domain Archaea have also been identified. There are no known eukaryote fossils.p306, 323 No fossil evidence yet exists for viruses. Fossilized microbes from terrestrial microbial mats show that life was already established on land 3.22 billion years ago.\nProterozoic.\nThe Proterozoic record.\nThe geologic record of the Proterozoic is much better than that for the preceding Archaean. In contrast to the deep-water deposits of the Archean, the Proterozoic features many strata that were laid down in extensive, shallow epicontinental seas; furthermore, many of these rocks are less metamorphosed than Archean-age ones, and plenty are in fact unaltered.p315 Study of these rocks show that the eon featured rapid continental accretion (unique to the Proterozoic), supercontinent cycles, and mountain-building (orogeny) activity.p315/8; 329/32\nThe first known glaciations occurred during the Proterozoic. One ice age began shortly after the beginning of the eon. There were at least four during the Neoproterozoic, climaxing with the \"Snowball Earth\" of the Varangian glaciation.p320; 325\nThe build-up of oxygen.\nThe Great Oxygenation Event was one of the most important events of the Proterozoic. Though oxygen was undoubtedly released by photosynthesis well back in Archean times, it could not build up to any significant degree until chemical sinks--unoxidized sulfur and iron\u2014had been filled; until roughly 2.3 billion years ago, oxygen was probably only 1 to 2% of its current level.(Stanley, 323) Banded iron formations, which provide most of the world's iron ore, were also a prominent chemical sink; most accumulation ceased after 1.9 billion years ago, either due to an increase in oxygen or a more thorough mixing of the oceanic water column.p324\nRed beds, which are coloured by haematite, indicate an increase in atmospheric oxygen after 2 billion years ago; they are not found in older rocks.(Stanley, 324) The oxygen build-up was probably due to two factors: a filling of the chemical sinks, and an increase in carbon burial, which stored organic compounds which would have otherwise been oxidized by the atmosphere.p325\nProterozoic life.\nThe first advanced single-celled and multi-cellular life roughly coincides with the oxygen accumulation; this may have been due to an increase in the oxidized nitrates that eukaryotes use, as opposed to cyanobacteria.(Stanley, 325) It was also during the Proterozoic that the first symbiotic relationship between mitochondria (for animals and protists) and chloroplasts (for plants) and their hosts evolved.p321-2\nEukaryotes such as acritarchs blossomed, as did cyanobacteria; in fact, stromatolites reached their greatest abundance and diversity during the Proterozoic, peaking roughly 1.2 billion years ago.321-3\nClassically, the boundary between the Proterozoic and the Paleozoic was set at the base of the Cambrian period when the first fossils of animals known as trilobites appeared. In the second half of the 20th century, a number of fossil forms have been found in Proterozoic rocks, but the boundary of the Proterozoic has remained fixed at the base of the Cambrian\u2014currently placed at 542 Ma.\nPhanerozoic.\nPaleozoic.\nThe Paleozoic covers the time from the first appearance of abundant, hard-shelled fossils to the time when the continents were beginning to be dominated by large, relatively sophisticated reptiles and relatively modern plants. The Paleozoic is a time in Earth's history when complex life forms evolved, took their first breath of oxygen on dry land, and when the forerunners of all multicelular life on Earth began to diversify. There are six periods in the Paleozoic era: Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous and Permian.\nThe upper (youngest) boundary is set at a major extinction event 250 million years later, known as the Permian\u2013Triassic extinction event. Modern practice sets the older boundary at the first appearance of a distinctive trace fossil called \"Phycodes pedum\".\nGeologically, the Paleozoic starts shortly after the breakup of a supercontinent called Rodinia and at the end of a global ice age (Snowball Earth). Throughout the early Palaeozoic, the Earth's landmass was broken up into a substantial number of relatively small continents. Toward the end of the era, the continents gathered together into a supercontinent called Pangaea, which included most of the Earth's land area.\nAt the start of the era, life was confined to bacteria, algae, sponges and a variety of somewhat enigmatic forms known collectively as the Ediacaran fauna. A large number of body plans appeared nearly simultaneously at the start of the era\u2014a phenomenon known as the Cambrian Explosion.\nThere is some evidence that simple life may already have invaded the land at the start of the Palaeozoic, but substantial plants and animals did not take to the land until the Silurian and did not thrive until the Devonian. Although primitive vertebrates are known near the start of the Palaeozoic, animal forms were dominated by invertebrates until the mid-Palaeozoic. Fish populations exploded in the Devonian. During the late Palaeozoic, great forests of primitive plants thrived on land forming the great coal beds of Europe and eastern North America. By the end of the era, the first large, sophisticated reptiles and the first modern plants (conifers) had developed.\nMesozoic.\nThe Mesozoic covers the time when life was dominated by large sophisticated reptiles. The lower (oldest) boundary is set by the P/Tr extinction event. The upper (youngest) boundary is set at the K/T extinction event.\nGeologically, the Mesozoic starts with almost all the Earth's land collected into a supercontinent called Pangaea. During the era, Pangaea split into the northern continent Laurasia and the southern continent Gondwana. Laurasia then split into North America and Eurasia. Gondwana broke up progressively into continents: South America, Africa, Madagascar, India, Australia and Antarctica.\nThe Mesozoic is known as the Age of Dinosaurs. It also saw the development of early birds and mammals and, later, flowering plants (angiosperms). At the end of the Mesozoic, all the major body plans of modern life were in place, though in some cases notably the mammals the forms that existed at the end of the Cretaceous were relatively primitive.\nCenozoic.\nThe Cenozoic\u00a0is the age of mammals. During the Cenozoic, mammals diverged from a few small, simple, generalized forms into a diverse collection of terrestrial, marine, and flying animals. Flowering plants and birds also evolved substantially in the Cenozoic\u00a0.\nGeologically, the Cenozoic\u00a0is the era when continents moved into their current positions. Africa and Australasia split from Gondwana to drift north, and India collided with Southeast Asia; Antarctica moved into its current position over the South Pole; the Atlantic Ocean widened and, late in the era, South America became attached to North America."}

In other words, terminal velocity is the point at which the velocity (speed of moving of the falling object) is no longer getting greater. The gravitational force minus the force of drag (or air resistance) equals zero.\nAn object continues to fall steadily until air resistance becomes so great that it equals the pull of gravity and the object can fall no faster. Besides weight, terminal velocity depends on other factors such as shape and cross sectional area. \nExample.\nThe terminal velocity of a skydiver in a belly-to-earth (i.e., face down) position is about 195\u00a0km/h (122\u00a0mph or 54\u00a0m/s). This velocity is the limit of the acceleration process. The forces on the body balance each other more and more closely as the terminal velocity is approached. In this example, a speed of 50% of terminal velocity is reached after only about 3 seconds, while it takes 8 seconds to reach 90%, 15 seconds to reach 99% and so on.\nHigher speeds are achieved if the skydiver pulls in his or her limbs (see also freeflying). In this case, the terminal velocity increases to about 320\u00a0km/h (200\u00a0mph or 90\u00a0m/s), which is almost the terminal velocity of the Peregrine Falcon diving down on its prey."}

{"id": "198289", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=198289", "title": "Waltzing Matilda", "text": "\"Waltzing Matilda\" is one of Australia's best known songs. The bush ballad, a country folk song, has been called \"the unofficial national anthem of Australia\".\nThe title, Waltzing Matilda, is Australian slang for walking through the country looking for work, with one's goods in a \"Matilda\" (bag) carried over one's back.\nThe song tells the story of a traveling farm worker making a drink of tea at a bush camp and capturing a sheep to eat. When the sheep's owner arrives with three policemen to arrest the worker for taking the sheep (a crime punishable by hanging), the worker drowns himself in a small watering hole. The worker's ghost stays to haunt the site.\nThe words to the song were written in 1895 by a poet and nationalist Banjo Paterson. It was first printed as sheet music in 1903. There are many stories about the song and how it was written. The song has its own museum, the Waltzing Matilda Centre in Winton, Queensland.\nHistory.\nWriting of the song.\nThe music, based on a folk song, was written by Christina Macpherson. Paterson wrote the words while staying at the Dagworth Homestead, farm in Queensland. While he was there the owners played him an old Celtic folk tune called \"The Craigeelee\". Paterson decided that it would be a good tune to write words for and completed during his stay at the farm.\nThe tune is probably the Scottish song \"Thou Bonnie Wood Of Craigielea\", which Macpherson heard played by a band at the Warrnambool steeplechase. Robert Tannahill wrote the words in 1805 and James Barr wrote the music in 1818. In 1893 it was arranged for brass band by Thomas Bulch. The tune may have been based on the melody of \"Go to the Devil and Shake Yourself\", written by John Field (1782\u20131837) sometime before 1812. It is sometimes also called: \"When Sick Is It Tea You Want?\" (London 1798) or \"The Penniless Traveller\" (O'Neill's 1850 collection).\nThere is also an idea that tune may be similar to \"The Bold Fusilier\" (also called \"Marching through Rochester\"), a song sung to the same tune and dated by some back to the eighteenth century but first printed in 1900.\n&lt;poem&gt;A bold fusilier came marching back through Rochester\nOff from the wars in the north country,\nAnd he sang as he marched\nThrough the crowded streets of Rochester,\nWho'll be a soldier for Marlboro and me?&lt;/poem&gt;\nLyrics.\nThere are no \"official\" words to \"Waltzing Matilda\", and slight differences can be found in the sources. This version uses the famous \"You'll never catch me alive said he\" variation introduced by the Billy Tea company. Paterson's original words use 'drowning', which the tea company felt was too negative.\n&lt;poem&gt;\nOnce a jolly swagman camped by a billabong\nUnder the shade of a coolibah tree,\nAnd he sang as he watched and waited 'til his billy boiled\n\"You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me\"\nWaltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda\n\"You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me\"\nAnd he sang as he watched and waited 'til his billy boiled,\n\"You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me\".\nDown came a jumbuck to drink at that billabong, \nUp jumped the swagman and grabbed him with glee, \nAnd he sang as he shoved that jumbuck in his tucker bag, \n\"You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me\".\nWaltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda\n\"You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me\"\nAnd he sang as he shoved that jumbuck in his tucker bag,\n\"You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me\".\nUp rode the squatter, mounted on his thoroughbred,\nDown came the troopers, one, two, three,\n\"Where's that jolly jumbuck you've got in your tucker bag?\"\n\"You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me\".\nWaltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda\n\"You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me\"\n\"Where's that jolly jumbuck you've got in your tucker bag?\",\n\"You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me\".\nUp jumped the swagman and sprang into the billabong,\n\"You'll never catch me alive\", said he,\nAnd his ghost may be heard as you pass by that billabong,\n\"You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me\".\nWaltzing Matilda, Waltzing Matilda\n\"You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me\"\nAnd his ghost may be heard as you pass by that billabong,\n\"You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me.\" \n\"Oh, You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda, with me.\"\n&lt;/poem&gt;"}

It is the only 19th century exhibition hall that held an international exhibition still in use. In 1880, 1.8 million people visited the exhibition; the population of Melbourne was only 282,000 people. From 1901 to 1925 the state government of Victoria used the building while the federal government used the State Parliament buildings.\nIn 2009, archaeologists dug up the car park to find out more about the buildings. They found paths from gardens that had been on the site before the building was put up. They also found the remains of an octagonal (eight-sided) kiosk which had sold food snacks and drinks in the gardens. They also found the remains of an extra building put up in 1888 to hold military weapons that were part of the 1880 exhibition."}

The siege started in 1661 and ended in 1662. It ended the Dutch East India Company's rule over Taiwan. After the siege, the Kingdom of Tungning ruled over the island. This event was said to be \"a war that determined the fate of Taiwan in the four hundred years\".\nBeginning.\nIn 1659, after an unsuccessful attempt to capture Nanjing, Koxinga, leader of Ming loyalists began searching for a home for his men. \n\"He Bin\", who was working for the Dutch East India Company, fled to Koxinga's base in Xiamen and provided Koxinga with a map of Taiwan. The Dutch had established a post at Tayoan, that had two forts. The first was Fort Zeelandia at the entrance to the bay at Tayoan which was the main Dutch settlement. The second was Fort Provintia also located at the bay. Frederick Coyett, the governor of Taiwan was at Fort Zeelandia with 1,800 men. Fort Provintia had 500 men.\nThe Siege.\nKoxinga's fleet set sail from Kinmen on March 23, 1661. His fleet consisted of hundreds of ships of various sizes, with 25,000 men aboard. The fleet arrived at Tayoan on April 2, and, after passing through a shallow waterway unknown to the Dutch, landed at Luermen.\nThe men laid siege to Fort Provintia and it surrendered on April 4. Three days after the capture of Fort Provintia, Koxinga's men surrounded Fort Zeelandia and demanded its surrender. Koxinga sent a Dutch priest, Anthonius Hambroek, to ask for this surrender. Hambroek did not do this and he was killed after returning to Koxinga's camp.\nKoxinga's fleet then used cannons and they attempted to enter the fort, but many died. Koxinga then waited outside the fort. On May 28, news of Koxinga's attack reached Jakarta. The Dutch sent 10 ships and 700 sailors to help. The ships arrived on July 5 and had some small fights with Koxinga's fleet.\nOn July 23, the two sides fought as the Dutch ships tried to enter the fort. After a while, the Dutch ships had to retreat with two ships lost, three small vessels captured, and about a hundred casualties. The Dutch tried to break the siege again in October, but were beaten back by Koxinga's army. This victory, coupled with news of low morale among the garrison from deserted German mercenaries, convinced Koxinga to launched an assault in December.\nOn January 12, 1662, Koxinga's fleet began another bombardment, while the ground force prepare to assault the fort. With supplies dwindling and no sign of reinforcement, Coyett raised a white flag. The surrender was complete on February 1, and the Dutch East India Company left Taiwan on February 17.\nAfterwards.\nCoyett was tried for surrendering and exiled to the Banda Islands. He was pardoned after help from his friends. He published a book named \"Neglected Formosa\" () in 1675. In the book he criticized the company for neglecting his pleas for reinforcement.\nAfter the loss of Tayoan, the Dutch East India Company tried to recapture it. They joined with the Qing Empire to battle Koxinga's fleet, but failed.\nCultural influences.\nThe battle was shown in the movie \"Zheng Chenggong 1661\", which ends with Koxinga's victory over the Dutch. The movie's English title is \"Sino-Dutch War 1661\"."}

He also hosts the reality competition show \"Redneck Island\" on CMT and debuted a new reality show for CMT on June 10, 2014 called \"Steve Austin's Broken Skull Ranch\".\nWrestling career.\nEarly years.\nAustin first joined Chris Adams' school in the Dallas Sportatorium, where Chris Adams also competed for World Class Championship Wrestling. Adams' trained purely technical and taught Austin the wrestling moves. Adams' however did not teach Austin anything relating to kayfabe or the business. The first lesson that Austin learned was from Tony Falk, a referee in Austin's 1989 televised World Class debut against a wrestler named Frogman LeBlanc. Falk called spots and helped Austin win the match by pinfall. Austin first competed under his real name but was named \"Steve Austin\" by Memphis booker Dutch Mantell. Austin returned to Dallas and had a feud with Adams, who was managed by Percy Pringle and was led to the ring by Jeannie Adams (Adams' real-life former wife and Austin's girlfriend at the time). During that time, Austin adopted the \"Stunning\" nickname which he also used in WCW.\nWorld Championship Wrestling.\nAfter leaving the USWA in 1990, Austin signed with WCW in 1991. He was first accompanied by a valet named Vivacious Veronica but was later joined by Jeannie Adams who was known as \"Lady Blossom\". A couple weeks before he debuted, Austin was able to defeat Bobby Eaton to win his first WCW World Television Championship on June 3, 1991. Later in that year, he joined Paul E. Dangerously's Dangerous Alliance. On April 27, 1992, Barry Windham defeated Austin in a two out of three falls match to win the WCW Television Championship. Austin won the title back from Windham on May 23. He held the title until he lost the title to Ricky Steamboat on September 2, 1992. The Dangerous Alliance stable broke up a while later. During Halloween Havoc, he replaced Terry Gordy and teamed with \"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams in a match against Dustin Rhodes and Barry Windham for the unified WCW and NWA World Tag Team title. The match ended in a thirty-minute time limit draw.\nIn January 1993, Austin joined Brian Pillman to form the tag team The Hollywood Blonds. Austin and Pillman defeated Ricky Steamboat and Shane Douglas on March 3 to win the WCW World Tag Team Championship. The Blonds held the titles for five months. At Clash of the Champions XXIII, Austin and Pillman competed in a two-out-of-three-falls tag team title match against Ric Flair and Arn Anderson. The Blonds were defeated by Flair and Anderson but they were not given the titles because one of the falls was counted by a disqualification. The Blonds were scheduled to defend their title against Anderson and Paul Roma at Clash of the Champions XXIV. Pillman was however injured and was replaced by Steven Regal. Anderson and Roma defeated Austin and Regal at the event. While Pillman was still injured, Austin joined Colonel Robert Parker's Stud Stable. When Pillman returned, he was betrayed by Austin and was defeated in a singles match against Austin at Clash of the Champions XXV.\nAustin defeated Dustin Rhodes with two straight falls in a two-out-of-three-falls match to win the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship at Starrcade. On August 24, 1994, Austin lost the championship to Ricky Steamboat. Austin was supposed to have a rematch for the title at Fall Brawl but won the title by forfeit after Steamboat was not able to compete because to a back injury. His reign as champion only lasted minutes when lost to Jim Duggan, who was acting as Steamboat's replacement. The match only lasted thirty-five seconds. He had a rematch against Duggan for the United States Championship at both Halloween Havoc 1994 and Clash of the Champions XXIX but didn't win either matches. After Austin returned from a knee injury in early 1995, he took part in a tournament to crown the new WCW United States Heavyweight title. Austin defeated Duggan in the first round by count-out but lost in the quarterfinals to Randy \"Macho Man\" Savage\nExtreme Championship Wrestling.\nWhen Austin suffered a triceps injury while on a tour of Japan, he was fired by WCW Vice President Eric Bischoff. WCW and Bischoff thought that Austin would not be a 'marketable' wrestler. After he was fired, Austin expressed his opinion on being fired by Eric Bischoff over the phone as having taken the coward's way out. Bischoff said that he fired Austin because he refused to do a taping in Atlanta. When he heard that Austin was fired, Paul Heyman who ran Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW), contacted him. Heyman hired Austin to perform in-ring interviews because Austin was still not recovered from his injury enough to compete. Austin's time in ECW helped build his future \"Stone Cold\" persona. He appeared in vignettes which ran down WCW and Bischoff. Some of the more memorable promos that he did involved his then-status as \"WCW Monday Nitro\" host by introducing \"Monday NyQuil\". He was also joined by \"Bongo\", (which were a set of bongo drums that were meant to represent Steve \"Mongo\" McMichael) in helping to promote the show \"where the big boys play with each other\"\nDuring his time in ECW, he was known under the ring name \"Superstar\" Steve Austin. He feuded with Mikey Whipwreck and had a match with The Sandman. Austin challenged for the ECW Championship but was defeated by Whipwreck at November to Remember. Austin competed in a Triple Threat match at December to Dismember against The Sandman and Whipwreck for the ECW World Heavyweight Championship but he did not win the match. Heyman said later on that he wanted to have Austin win the ECW Championship but Austin did not want to win it because he felt that he was more effective \"as the hunter, rather than the hunted.\""}

Usually, he\u2019s wearing a suit and tie, and his place is in the center of the table at one side, near the chips.\nThe Stickman - is in charge of the center of the layout and uses a stick to move the dice. His place is on the opposite side of the table from the Boxman. The stick is needed because dealers never touch the dice, so the Stickman has to be able to reach them wherever they land. He\u2019s also announcing each roll of the dice and passes them to the shooter when all payoffs are done.\nThe Dealers - are the ones who take care of the layouts, one layout per dealer. There are two dealers at the table and one on a break, and they stand at the sides of the Boxman. Their duty is to correctly pay all bets at their side of the table and exchange chips for cash."}

It was held on December 3, 2006 at James Brown Arena in Augusta, Georgia. It was the first December to Dismember event held by the WWE and the second overall. The name came from the December to Dismember event which was held by the original Extreme Championship Wrestling in 1995. Even though it was an ECW brand pay-per-view, wrestlers from both the \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown!\" brands also worked on the pay-per-view.\nThe main event was an Extreme Elimination Chamber match for the ECW World Championship. The six wrestlers in the match were Bobby Lashley, Rob Van Dam, Hardcore Holly, CM Punk and Test and defending champion Big Show. Lashley won the match and the championship after he hit Big Show with a spear and pinned him.\nThe pay-per-view had an attendance of 4,800 and 90,000 people payed to see the event, with 55,000 of the buys being domestic. This was the lowest buyrate in WWE history. \nReception and aftermath.\nDecember to Dismember received very negative reviews. Matt MacKinder of SLAM! Wrestling rated the event 4 out of 10 stars and said \"the two matches that were promoted saved this thing from being a debacle\". December to Dismember was voted as the \"worst major wrestling show of the year\" in the 2006 Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards.\nNot even 24 hours after the pay-per-view, WWE announced that Vince McMahon had sent Paul Heyman home, and cited \"slumping television ratings and a disgruntled talent roster as causes for Mr. Heyman's dismissal\". McMahon was trying to put the blame on Heyman for the poorly received pay-per-view, and after he had a meeting with both Vince and Stephanie McMahon, Heyman legitimately left the company but still remained under contract. Heyman did not want to see Lashley booked to win the ECW Championship but McMahon said that the fans would be happy to see a new champion and a 10-minute celebration. During an early 2008 interview with \"The Sun\", Heyman said how he would have booked the Elimination Chamber main event. He said that he would have had Punk enter first and quickly eliminate Big Show by submission. He said that McMahon did not like the idea, but Big Show did and that he was eager for the opportunity to help \"make\" a rising star like Punk. Heyman also said that he continued to go to McMahon on the night of the pay-per-view to tell him that \"The people are going to throw this back in our face\".\nTommy Dreamer and Stevie Richards both did not like how the event turned out and they both asked for their contract releases after the pay-per-view. Both McMahon and Vice President of Talent Relations John Laurinaitis refused to release them."}

He was one of the most important musicians in the history of recorded music, and is called one of the greatest figures in jazz music. He also played blues, gospel, pop, and classical music. He worked for 60 years. He became even more popular after he died. He was given a special award citation from the Pulitzer Prize Board in 1999. \nEllington called his music \"American Music\", not \"jazz\". Some of the people who played in Ellington's band were also famous or important jazz musicians.\nEllington led his band from 1923 until he died of lung cancer in 1974. His son Mercer Ellington took over the band until he died of cancer in 1996. Then Paul Ellington, Mercer's youngest son, took over the band.\nLife.\nEdward Kennedy Ellington was born on April 29, 1899. His parents were called James Edward Ellington and Daisy Kennedy Ellington. They lived with Daisy's parents in Washington, D.C. James Edward Ellington (J.E.) was born in Lincolnton, North Carolina on April 15, 1879 and moved to Washington, D.C. in 1886 with his parents. Daisy Kennedy was born in Washington, D.C. on January 4, 1879. Her father had been an American slave. J.E. worked for the United States Navy. He also worked as a butler for a white doctor. He occasionally worked as a caterer at the White House..Daisy and J.E. were both piano players.\nWhen he was seven, Ellington began learning to play the piano. Daisy helped her son to learn good manners. Ellington\u2019s friends noticed that he acted like a gentleman,\nand gave him a nickname, \"Duke\".\" At first, Ellington was more interested in baseball than playing the piano. He later remembered President Theodore Roosevelt watched him play baseball. Ellington went to Armstrong Technical High School in Washington, D.C. His first job was selling peanuts at Washington Senators baseball games. This job helped him to become more confident.\nIn 1914, Ellington wrote his first song. He had a job in a caf\u00e9, serving soda, using a soda fountain. His song was called \"Soda Fountain Rag\". He could not read or write music yet. Ellington missed a lot of piano lessons and did not think he was very good at it. When he was 14 he heard pianists playing in a poolroom. He was inspired to try harder with his piano playing.\nHe heard the piano played in Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and Atlantic City. He tried to copy the styles he heard. He started to learn about harmony, and learned to read and write music. He started to play gigs in caf\u00e9s and clubs in Washington, D.C. He had a scholarship to study art at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn in 1916 but he decided to concentrate on his music instead.\nBetween 1917 and 1919, Ellington started his professional music career. During the day, he had a job painting signs. At night, he played the piano. Sometimes, he got work playing the piano from people that he met in his other job. He started his first band, \"The Duke\u2019s Serenaders\". They played in Washington, D.C. and Virginia at dances and parties. The other musicians in his band were Otto Hardwick, on bass and then saxophone; Arthur Whetsol on trumpet; Elmer Snowden on banjo; and Sonny Greer on drums. They played for both white and black people, which was unusual then."}

The band started in 1995 by vocalist and percussionist Anders Colsefini, guitarists Donnie Steele and Josh \"Gnar\" Brainard, bassist Paul Gray, drummer Joey Jordison,and percussionist Shawn Crahan. Before the band released its first album in 1999, Slipknot has gone through many line-up changes. After their first album, the line-up has stayed the same. The band is known for having a lot of members. The current members include a lead singer, two guitarists, a bassist, a drummer, two percussionists, a sampler, and a turntablist.\nIn 1996, when the band finished recording their demo album \"Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat.\", Slipknot saw its first line-up change when guitarist Donnie Steele left the band and was replaced by Craig Jones. Shortly after, drummer Jordison said they needed a full-time sampler and Jones took the position as \"he liked doing that anyway.\" Mick Thomson then joined the band to be the new guitarist. After \"Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat.\" was released, the band were working on new songs which needed more singing melody and the then-lead singer Colsefini had a hard time with this. In 1997, Corey Taylor was asked to join the band and after practicing with Slipknot \"everything just clicked.\" Because of that, Colsefini was moved to backing vocals and percussion. However Colsefini was unhappy with his new role and left the band a month later.\nSince the band wanted to keep their percussive sound, Greg Welts joined the band to replace Colsefini. Towards the end of 1997, each band member picked an a number to identify themselves. In 1998, Welts became the only member to be kicked out of the band and he was replaced by Chris Fehn. Slipknot wanted to have a DJ in the band, but had a hard time finding one because \"the people [they] knew who were DJs all sucked!\" Sid Wilson approached the band after seeing them live. He proceeded to impress the band with his ability and his antics; Wilson was considered \"Slipknot material\" and his hiring brought the band's line-up to nine members. The final change in the band's line-up came at the latter stages of the recording process of the band's debut album, \"Slipknot\", in 1999. While the band took a break from recording the album, Brainard decided to leave the band and was replaced by Jim Root.\nTwo more lineup changes took place over the years. The first was after the departure of Joey Jordison in December 2013. In early 2014, the late Paul Gray was replaced by Alessandro Venturella, and Jordison was replaced by Jay Weinberg, leaving Crahan as the only remaining original member. The second change occurred in mid 2019, after Chris Fehn was fired from the band. He was replaced by a mysterious new member.\nCurrent members.\nSlipknot band members performing in 2008.\nFormer members.\n "}

This caused two of the columns and three spans of the bridge to collapse into the river. The ship sank quickly in the deep water. Four cars fell into the river killing five people, and seven members of the ship's crew were also killed. Several cars were able to stop, with their front wheels hanging over the edge. \nThe collapse of the bridge left people living on the east bank of the Derwent with a 50km drive to get into the city. A temporary Bailey bridge was put in place. This was the longest Bailey bridge in the world. The Tasman Bridge was rebuilt and opened again to traffic on 8 October, 1977."}

It happened from 1966 to 1976.\nThe start of the Cultural Revolution followed the failure of the Great Leap Forward. Mao tried to remove capitalists from the Communist Party of China, the party in charge of China. To get rid of the capitalists, he started the Socialist Education Movement. It started in 1962 and ended in 1965. At the same time, a redoing of the school system made sure that students were able to also work in factories and communes. Mao slowly started to regain power in 1965, supported by Lin Biao, Jiang Qing, and Chen Boda.\nThe Communist Party was split between Mao's partners and Deng Xiaoping's partners. Deng Xiaoping was a rival of Mao. Mao then tried to get support from young people in China by creating the book Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong (also known as the Little Red Book), a collection of Mao's sayings. The Red Guard was also made popular. They were a group of young people in China that went around teaching Mao's sayings. They also beat people who disagreed with Mao and destroyed homes and museums. There were many fights breaking out, and China faced anarchy. During the revolution, several important people in China were forced to leave. These people included Liu Shaoqi, President of China, and Deng Xiaoping, the secretary-general of the Communist Party of China.\nThe Cultural Revolution began to slow down in 1967, and ended in 1969. The Ninth National Party Congress was a meeting where the end of the Cultural Revolution was announced.\nEffects.\nThe Cultural Revolution caused a lot of problems in China. Production in factories was lowered because of the workers' political activities. It was also lowered because the people put in charge of the factories did not know how to run them. Transportation was made worse because a lot of trains were being used to take Red Guards around the country. Many scientists and engineers were put in jail or sent to work on the farms, which meant that their knowledge was lost. Because of these changes, the industrial output of China was reduced by 14 percent.\nThe education of many Chinese people was also cut short. The education system was more disrupted in the cities than in the countryside. Universities and many schools were closed. A program called the \"sent-down youth\" program also disrupted education. In that program, children were sent from the cities to the countryside."}

It was started by the Communist leader Chairman Mao Zedong in 1958 and it ended in 1961. The Great Leap Forward failed to bring industrialization and the famine that it created killed millions of people. Some people think it to be the biggest famine in history.\nAgriculture and farms.\nMao wanted China to be able to make food for the country and make food to export; he also wanted China to produce a lot of goods. He started the Great Leap Forward to do this. Some people were forced to give their land to the government. Many people had to work on farms for the government, that were also called \"agricultural cooperatives\". Later, these cooperatives were put together to involve thousands of people. In 1958, ninety-eight percent (98%) of people who worked on farms were in these cooperatives.\nIn 1958, there was a good harvest. However, this began to change the year after.\nPeople believed that planting plants close together was good. However, crops did not grow as well when they were close together. This led to lower grain harvests in 1959. After that the harvests were bad also because resources were not used well. This lasted at least until 1961.\nIndustry.\nThe change in China was put on a schedule. Mao wanted China to have a greater industrial output than Britain in fifteen years. He later shortened this to one year. If people did not like the fast pace of the schedule, they were usually killed. By 1958, 550,000 people were killed because they did not agree with the government.\nBecause the government spent a lot of money on industry, the country increased its debt. In order to meet production goals, many people built blast furnaces in their backyard. They would then try to make iron for tools. However, this did not work very well. People ended up melting good things, turning them into unusable things.\nFamine.\nLeaders competed with each other to see who could make the most things. This led the farms to be forgotten. Leaders would also lie about the amount of crops being grown. They would tell the government that they were making more than they actually were. In 1959, the country began running out of food. This is because they sold their grain to other countries. This problem was made worse because the output of farms was decreasing. People were also not allowed to leave the areas they were living in. That meant that they could not look for food in other places. Some villages had one-fourth or one-third of people dying in them. Girls and old people were underfed. Infants and the very old were the first to die.\nThe famine is thought to have killed between 16.5 million and 40 million people.\nAftermath.\nThe government tried to stop the famine by cancelling orders for technology. Instead, they imported food for people to eat. However, the economy of China continued to fall after the end of the Great Leap Forward. Workers were stressed, and the Soviet Union took away its support of China. Mao used the Cultural Revolution to punish those he claimed caused the failure."}

The novel was written in the middle of the 18th century during the Qing Dynasty. Its author is thought to be Cao Xueqin (Chinese: \u66f9\u96ea\u82b9). Redology is the study of the book.\nThe book is based on Cao's family. It is meant to be a memorial to the women that he met when he was young, including friends, relatives and servants. This novel is thought to be one of the first feminist novels. It is also one of the first novels to be written in vernacular, not classical, Chinese. This means that it was written in the same way people spoke at the time, rather than in a posh way. This helped to make vernacular Chinese an acceptable way of writing literature."}

The first letter refers to squares that are 500\u00a0km by 500\u00a0km. Those squares are outlined in dark grey on the map to the right.

The stable was founded at Night of Champions when Cody Rhodes turned on Hardcore Holly forming \"Priceless\" with Ted DiBiase Jr. Legacy held the WWE Tag Team Championship twice with Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase holding the titles on two separate occasions. \nHistory.\nRoots.\n(December 2007-Mid 2008).\nThe roots of the team started December 10 2007, on the \"Raw 15th anniversary\", when Cody Rhodes and Hardcore Holly defeated Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch for the World Tag Team Championship.\nThey retained the championship in many matches, against fellow tag-teams such as Carlito and Santino Marella, and Paul London and Brian Kendrick.\nRhodes and Holly would then enter a feud with Ted Dibiase and his mystery partner, when DiBiase Jr. and The Million Dollar Man Ted DiBiase, Sr., appeared in a segment on \"Raw\". DiBiase and his father, challenged Rhodes and Holly to a title match at Night of Champions (2008) against DiBiase (Jr.) and a mystery partner which they accepted. At Night of Champions DiBiase came to the ring unaccompanied and said his partner would be there. However, the bell rang and there was no partner for it to be a two on one handicap match. DiBiase demanded that he face Holly first and as DiBiase approached Holly, Holly was attacked by his tag team partner Rhodes, revealing that he was DiBiase's tag team partner, turning Rhodes heel and in the process. Rhodes and DiBiase became the new tag team champions.\nPriceless.\nAfter holding the titles for just over a month, they dropped it to John Cena and Batista on the August 4 edition of \"Raw\". The following week, DiBiase and Rhodes used their rematch clause to regain the title. Rhodes and DiBiase were joined by Manu, forming a stable of multi-generational superstars. On the October 27, 2008 edition of \"Raw\", Rhodes and DiBiase lost their titles to Kofi Kingston and CM Punk. During this time, Rhodes, DiBiase and Manu entered a storyline with Randy Orton where Orton constantly criticized and insulted them, and attacked DiBiase on November 7, on \"Raw\"; punting him in the head. At Survivor Series, Rhodes, along with Orton, was a sole survivor, for Orton's team, in the Elimination match.\nThe Legacy (Mid 2008-Early 2010).\nRhodes and Manu accepted Orton's offer to form an alliance a few weeks after the \"DiBiase incident\"; attacking John Cena along with Chris Jericho, and the trio dubbed themselves \"The Legacy\"; debuting the following week in a 2 on 3 handicap match against Batista and the WWE Champion Triple H, and although they were now a stable, neither one of the three made any changes in their attire.\nThe December 15th edition of \"Raw\" they defeated Batista and the World Heavyweight Champion John Cena, in a match where Orton punted Batista in the head, leaving him indefinitely inactive (actually due to a torn hamstring), also that night Cody and Manu interfered in Rey Mysterio's match against Sim Snuka, giving a beating to Rey, who was later attacked by Mike Knox.,\nRandy Orton and Cody Rhodes and Ted Dibiase JR formed Legacy\nThe following week; December 22, Orton qualified for a Fatal Four Way Elimination Match, his opponent being the now unable to compete Batista, while the same night, Manu lost to Kofi Kingston in a one on one match, with Rhodes at ringside.\nAfter Orton grew tired of \"The Legacy\" losing matches, in an ongoing quest to mold his disciples; he informed Cody Rhodes, Sim Snuka and Manu that that very night they would have to complete their first test. Each man would have to compete in a singles match. Each man who won would have completed \u201cstep one,\u201d any man who lost would be out of his \"Legacy\"; the only man that lost was Manu.\nWhile same that night, Kelly Kelly confronted her real secret romance Randy Orton, After lying to Kane about his identity two weeks previous. After listening to Kelly Kelly berate him for not calling her back, Orton told Kelly that he didn\u2019t need her to protect him against Kane. He then blew her off by telling her that he didn\u2019t need any distractions while vying for the World Heavyweight Championship, this caused an alteration in between Kane and Orton, in a match where Kane jobbed to Kane, and thus ending the feud.\nIn the Elimination Fatal Four Way to determine who would follow to face John Cena at the Royal Rumble, in between Y2J, Orton, Shawn Michaels and JBL, just as Jericho prepared to lock JBL into the Walls of Jericho, Michaels laid out the first ever Undisputed Champion Chris Jericho with a Sweet Chin Music. Next up, it was Orton who found himself on the receiving end of Sweet Chin Music.\nOrton opened Raw the night after the Royal Rumble, flanked by the members of the Legacy, Rhodes and DiBiase, as well as two lawyers and a therapist. He followed to reveal that he (kayfabe) suffers from IED (Intermittent Explosive Disorder, a mental condition that caused him to experience violent outbursts when provoked, losing all control of his emotions and actions). According to Orton and his therapist, WWE knew of the condition, and if fired, the Orton said that he planned on not only taking Rhodes and DiBiase with him, but also on bringing a lawsuit against the company.\nThe leader of the Legacy then detailed his plans for a second lawsuit, suing for breach of contract if he is not granted the opportunity to compete in the main event of WrestleMania XXV, an honor he earned by defeating 29 other Superstars in the Royal Rumble Match the night before. Before leaving with Rhodes, DiBiase, his therapist and his lawyers, Orton issued a prepared, half-hearted apology to Mr. McMahon, his family and the WWE Universe.\nAt the close of the show, Stephanie McMahon entered the ring, expressing her desire to speak to Randy Orton face-to-face. Accompanied by his therapist, two lawyers, Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase, the 2009 Royal Rumble winner made his entrance, reiterating the consequences waiting for Stephanie if she was to fire him: Two costly lawsuits being filed against WWE as well as DiBiase and Rhodes walking. The Legend Killer went even further, threatening to file an injunction to stop WrestleMania, the event at which he is guaranteed a World Title Match.\nAfter daring McMahon to fire him, the Raw General Manager announced that they had other plans for him \u2013 even beyond the Superstars that engulfed the ring. With that, Stephanie\u2019s brother Shane McMahon made his entrance, and attacked Orton with such ferocity that it took the entire Raw roster to restrain him.\nThe following week Orton challenged McMahon to a No Holds Barred match at No Way Out, which Shane accepted.\nThe next week Orton faced The Undertaker and lost by desqualification, while Rhodes and DiBiase defeated Cryme Tyme. Orton would then go on to feud with then WWE Champion Triple H, for what Orton and Legacy had done to Triple H's family. On the March 2nd edition of Raw, Randy Orton chose to face Triple H in the main event at Wrestlemania 25. At Wrestlemania 25 Triple H would defeat Randy Orton after hitting him with a sledgehammer and a pedigree. The night after Wrestlemania 25, Orton had a one on one match with Mr. McMahon, just as Orton was about to go for the punt kick, Shane McMahon came to the aid of his father; this prompted Rhodes and DiBiase to come out and attack Shane; which then lead to Triple H coming out. As Legacy were attacking Triple H, Batista returned to attack Randy Orton for what he did to him in December of 2008.\nOn the February 22nd 2010 episode of Monday Night RAW, Orton made a 6-Man Tag Match because he was thinking Legacy needed to form together and Randy even said he was sorry but after Orton left the scene, it was revealed that Ted and Cody were planning to betray Randy once and for all but during the match, when Cody tagged Randy out, while entering the ring, Orton shockingly DDT'd Cody. Ted was in shock because he realized Orton figured out their plan which lead to Orton supposedly turning into a face and RKO'd Ted DiBiase right on the spot and left the arena leaving Evan Bourne to pin the fallen Cody Rhodes.\nIn wrestling.\nFinishing and signature moves\nRandy Orton\nCody Rhodes\n\"Priceless\" Ted DiBiase"}

The main purpose of intercropping is to produce more crops in a given area. It also makes use of resources (nutrients) that would otherwise not be used by a single crop. Crops are selected such that their nutrient requirements are different. This way, the crops can give the same returns but require less space.\nThings to consider when choosing which crops to mix include the soil, climate and varieties. It is very important not to have crops competing with each other for space, nutrients, water, or sunlight. An example of an intercropping strategy is planting one crop that has deep roots with another that has shallow roots.\nIntercropping has been proposed as an alternative to slash-and-burn farming, which is very bad for the environment.\nConserving soil\nIntercropping also helps to conserve soil.

He was one of the first people to suggest that organisms changed in accordance with natural laws. This is known as evolution.\nLife.\nJean-Baptiste was the 11th child of Philippe Jacques de Monet de La Marck and Marie-Fran\u00e7oise de Fontaine de Chuignolles. His parents were nobles, but they were not well-off. His parents wanted him to become a priest. Starting at age eleven, he attended a Jesuit school in Amiens. After his father's death in 1759, Jean-Baptiste joined the army. Lamarck fought in the Pomeranian War with Prussia, and was awarded a medal for bravery on the battlefield. During his service, he was stationed in different forts in France, mostly at the eastern border, and the Mediterranean coast. At his post in Monaco, Lamarck became interested in natural history and resolved to study medicine. In 1766, he was injured. He retired from the army in 1768 and returned to his medical studies. He worked at a bank in Paris. From 1770 to 1774, he studied medicine at the university, but did not finish his studies with a degree. During this time, he met some of the well-known scientists of his day, such as the botanists Bernard and Antoine-Laurent de Jussieu, and the naturalist Buffon.\nLamarck developed a particular interest for botany, and later, after he published a three-volume work \"Flora fran\u00e7aise\", he gained membership of the French Academy of Sciences in 1779. Lamarck became involved in the \"Jardin des Plantes\" and was appointed to the Chair of Botany in 1788. When the \"Mus\u00e9um national d'Histoire naturelle\" was founded in 1793, Lamarck was appointed as a professor of zoology. In 1801, he published \"Syst\u00e8me des animaux sans vert\u00e8bres\", a major work on the classifications of invertebrates. In an 1802 publication, he became one of the first to use the term \"biology\" in its modern sense. Lamarck continued his work as a top authority on invertebrate zoology.\nIn the modern era, Lamarck is remembered mainly for a theory of the inheritance of acquired characters, called soft inheritance or Lamarckism. His major work on this subject was \"Philosophie zoologique\", Paris 1809.\nHis idea of soft inheritance was a reflection of the folk wisdom of the time, accepted by many natural historians. Lamarck's contribution to evolutionary theory was an early, perhaps the first, theory of evolution. In Lamarck's theory, an alchemical complexifying force drove organisms up a ladder of complexity. A second environmental force adapted them to local environments through \"use and disuse\" of characteristics, making them different from other organisms. Since these ideas cannot be reconciled with what we know about genetics, they are now history.\nLamarck died in Paris in 1829. When he died, his family was so poor they had to apply to the Academie for financial assistance. Lamarck's books and the contents of his home were sold at auction, and he was buried in a temporary lime-pit.\nControversy with Cuvier.\nLamarck came into conflict with the widely respected palaeontologist Georges Cuvier, who was not a supporter of evolution:\nAfter his death, Cuvier used the forum of a eulogy to denigrate Lamarck: \nLater opposition to his ideas.\nOpposition to Lamarck's theories became stronger when Mendel's genetics was rediscovered, but there were always common-sense doubts. Particular criticism came from Alfred Russel Wallace and August Weismann later in the 19th century. Here is an example:\nWallace's argument in short is:"}

There he studied the natural history. He was an early supporter of Darwinism, and lived in Brazil for the rest of his life. M\u00fcllerian mimicry is named after him.\nLife.\nUnlike most of his contemporaries in Britain, M\u00fcller had what would be seen today as a normal scientific education at the universities of Berlin and Greifswald, culminating in a doctoral degree. Then, he decided to study medicine. As a medical student, he began to question religion and in 1846 became an atheist. Despite completing the course, he did not graduate because he refused to swear the graduation oath, which contained the phrase \"so help me God and his sacred Gospel\".\nM\u00fcller was disappointed by the failure of the Prussian Revolution in 1848, and realised there might be implications for his life and career. As a result, he emigrated to South Brazil in 1852, with his brother August and their wives, to join Hermann Blumenau's new colony in the State of Santa Catarina. The colony, near the coast on the Itaja\u00ed River, was called Blumenau. In Brazil, M\u00fcller, living with his wife Caroline, became a farmer, doctor, teacher and biologist, sometimes employed by the provincial government, sometimes surviving on his own efforts, sometimes defending against Indians but always collecting evidence of life in the Atlantic forest. The climate here is sub-tropical, and the vegetation typical of the Brazilian coast: it is not rain forest.\nIn 1876 he was appointed as Travelling Naturalist to the National Museum in Rio de Janeiro. This was the ideal post for him: it gave him the opportunity to range over the whole of the Itaja\u00ed system and study anything that interested him. A series of reports published in the \"Archivos\" of the National Museum record this work.\nAt last this, the best period of his life, was brought to an end indirectly, by the overthrow of the liberal monarchy of Dom Pedro II in 1889. The new Brazilian Republic was riddled with corruption and nepotism, and eventually there was a civil war in 1893-5. Travelling naturalists were to be based in Rio de Janeiro, and instructions were sent out. M\u00fcller refused point-blank and was dismissed, as was von Ihering in S\u00e3o Paulo.\nIn his retirement years M\u00fcller received many letters of support and offers of financial help (from Darwin, amongst others). His cousin Alfred M\u00f6ller visited him, and eventually became his biographer. His rewards during life from the Brazilian state were minor; but his reputation now stands high. He was one of a half-dozen great naturalists to visit and work in South America during the nineteenth century. Humboldt, Darwin, Wallace, Bates, Spruce \u2014 and Fritz M\u00fcller. He was the only one of these to settle in Brazil for the rest of his life. A statue was erected to M\u00fcller in Blumenau in 1929.\nAnother of Fritz's brothers, Hermann M\u00fcller, was also an evolutionary biologist. He was especially interested in the coevolution between insects and flowers.p29 He, too, corresponded with Dariwn, who arranged for his 1873 book to be translated into English.\nChronology of life.\nA broad chronology of M\u00fcller's life is as follows:\nBiology.\nDuring his life M\u00fcller published oved 70 papers, mostly in German-language periodicals, some in English and Portuguese. The topics covered a range of natural history topics in entomology, marine zoology, and botany.\nM\u00fcllerian mimicry.\nM\u00fcller's great discovery concerned the resemblance between two or more unpalatable species which are protected from predators capable of learning. The protection is often a noxious chemical, perhaps gained from the larva eating a particulat plant; or it may be a sting or other defence. It is an advantage for such potential prey to advertise their status in a way clearly perceptible to their predators; this is called \"aposematic\" or warning colouration. In Muller's case the prey were butterflies, and the predators usually birds or reptiles.\nThe aposematic colours are most often some combination of red, yellow, black, white, whereas palatable animals are usually cryptic. The noxious animals may display by slow flying, and in general are prominently visible. Noxious animals usually have thick, leathery cuticles through which, at certain points, they extrude noxious fluids when pecked; they will often survive a 'trial'.\nIn M\u00fcllerian mimicry an advantage is gained when unpalatable species resemble each other, especially when the predator has a good memory for colour (as birds, for instance, do have). Thus one trial may work to dissuade a bird from several species of butterfly which all fly the same 'flag'. Brazilian butterflies provide some of the most extraordinary examples of mimicry, and M\u00fcller, Bates and Wallace all had lengthy experience of this. All three traveller-naturalists believed firmly that such systems of mimicry could only come about by means of natural selection, and all of them wrote about it.\nStingless bees.\nOne of his favourite topics was the life habits of the stingless honey-bees \"Melipoma\" and \"Trigona\". They are protected by a venom which they squirt when disturbed. The local name for them is Cagafogo (fire-shitter).\nDimorphism in midges.\nAnother discovery was the dimorphism in midges of the family Blepharicereidae. There are two female forms with different mouth-parts: one sucks blood, the other takes nectar, as does the male. To prove the point to skeptics, he sexed the flies carefully, and reared them from pupae.\nTermites.\nBy studying living termites M\u00fcller was able to correct many errors to be found in text-books. For example, their caste system is organised quite differently from ants, since the castes contain members of both sexes, whereas in hymenoptera the castes are unisexual and the males are haploid. Termites are placed in a different order from ants, the Isoptera.\nBotanical work.\nMuch of M\u00fcller's botany was stimulated by the series of botanical works published by Darwin in the years after the \"Origin\". M\u00fcller made contributions in all these fields. After Darwin's \"Fertilisation of Orchids\" (1862) he spent years of work on orchids, sending observations to his brother Hermann and to Darwin. Darwin used some of this work in his second edition of 1877, and Hermann later became famous for his work on pollination. On \"Climbing plants\" (Darwin 1867) M\u00fcller sent a letter to Darwin listing 40 genera of climbing plants classified by their method of climbing. The next few months saw more observations, which Darwin had translated and published as M\u00fcller's first paper in English.\nM\u00fcller and Darwin.\nM\u00fcller became a strong supporter of Darwin. He wrote \"F\u00fcr Darwin\" in 1864, arguing that Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection was correct, and that Brazilian crustaceans and their larvae could be affected by adaptations at any growth stage. This was translated into English as \"Facts and Arguments for Darwin\" in 1869. If M\u00fcller had a weakness it was that his writing was much less readable than that of Darwin or Wallace; both the German and English editions are hard reading indeed, which has limited the appreciation of this significant book.\nExtensive correspondence exists between M\u00fcller and Darwin, and M\u00fcller also corresponded with Alexander Agassiz, Ernst Krause, and Ernst Haeckel."}

He was the eldest son of the 6th Earl of Hopetoun. He was educated at Eton College and the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, where he passed in 1879 but did not join the Army. He looked after the family houses and lands. In 1883 he became active in the House of Lords. He served as a Lord in Waiting from June 1885 to January 1886 and August 1886 to August 1889.\nGovernor.\nIn 1889 he was made the Governor of Victoria, where he served until 1895. He went back to the United Kingdom and was made a privy councillor. He became the Paymaster-General from 1895 to 1898, and then Lord Chamberlain until 1900. The Australian colonies joined together to form the Commonwealth of Australia from 1 January 1901. Hopetoun was well liked in Victoria and he knew all the important Australian politicians. This made him a good choice to be the first Governor-General of the Commonwealth, and he was appointed in July 1900. In India, on his way to Australia, he got typhoid fever and his wife got malaria. They arrived in December 1900.\nGovernor-General.\nHopetoun's first job was to choose a Prime Minister to form a government, which would start on 1 January 1901. The first elections were not going to be held until March, so he could not choose the leader of the biggest political party in the House of Representatives. Instead, he asked Sir William Lyne, the Premier of the largest state, New South Wales, to be Prime Minister\nWhile this was a reasonable choice, Lyne had opposed federation and was unpopular with the leading federalist politicians. Alfred Deakin and other important politicians told Hopetoun they would not work with Lyne. Hopetoun then asked Edmund Barton, the leader of the federal movement and the man everybody thought should be the Prime Minister. This became known as the \"Hopetoun Blunder\".\nThere were soon more problems. Hopetoun had brought his own Official Secretary, Captain Edward William Wallington. The Australians did not want an Englishman in charge of official business. They also did not like the regal pomp and ceremony that Hopetoun used in his position, and the money that this cost. He acted as if ruled Australia with the Prime Minister. This was not what writers of the Constitution had wanted.\nHopetoun became friends with Melbourne anarchist and union pioneer, John 'Chummy' Fleming. In May 1901, Fleming protested against unemployment in Melbourne by rushing onto the Prince's Bridge to stop the Governor-General's carriage. Hopetoun listened to Fleming talk about the problems of the unemployed. According to some reports, Hopetoun made the government speed up work projects.\nFinally, there was a problem with how much the Governor-General should be paid to have a house in both Sydney, the largest city, and Melbourne, the home of the Australian government. The Commonwealth and Victorian parliaments would not pay Hopetoun more money. Hopetoun resigned in May 1902. He and his family left Australia (from Brisbane) on 17 July 1902. He knew he had failed in a historic role. He was created 1st Marquess of Linlithgow on 27 October 1902, while he still the Governor-General. His term officially ended on 9 January 1903. He was made Secretary for Scotland in 1905.\nHe died suddenly on 29 February 1908, in Pau, Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques, France.\nMarriage and children.\nOn 18 October 1886 he married Hersey Everleigh-de-Moleyns, daughter of the fourth Baron Ventry. They had four children;\nHis son Victor, the 2nd Marquess of Linlithgow became the longest-serving Viceroy of India 1936-43, a job he had always wanted. His grandson Lord Glendevon married the daughter of the English novelist W. Somerset Maugham."}

He is best known for proposing a theory of natural selection. This was published in 1858 together with Charles Darwin's idea.\nWallace did extensive natural history exploring. He went first to the Amazon River basin with Henry Walter Bates, and later to Malaya and Indonesia. He wrote books on both these adventures. While in Indonesia he drew the \"Wallace Line\" which divides Indonesia into two parts. On one side are animals of Australasia. On the other side are species mostly of Asian origin. He wrote a wonderful book on biogeography (the distribution of animals).\nThe great adventure.\nAfter a few years of working as a railway surveyor with his brother, Wallace's life was changed by meeting Henry Walter Bates in Leicester in 1847. \nThe Amazon.\nWallace and Bates discussed the idea of an expedition to the Amazon. The plan was to defray expenses by sending specimens back to London, where an agent would sell them for a commission. Also, for the travellers to \"gather facts towards solving the problem of the origin of species\", as Wallace put it in a letter to Bates.

For the first year they settled in a villa near the city, collecting birds and insects. After that they agreed to collect independently.\nWallace continued charting the Amazon for four years, collecting specimens and making notes on the peoples, the languages, the geography, flora, and fauna. On 12 July 1852, Wallace embarked for England on the brig \"Helen\". After twenty-eight days at sea, balsam in the ship's cargo caught fire and the crew was forced to abandon ship. All of the specimens Wallace had on the ship, most of his collection, were lost. He could only save part of his diary and a few sketches. Wallace and the crew spent ten days in an open boat before being picked up by the brig \"Jordeson\".\nThe East Indies.\nFrom 1854 to 1862, age 31 to 39, Wallace travelled through the \"Dutch East Indies\" (now Malaysia and Indonesia), to collect specimens for sale and to study nature. Wallace collected more than 125,000 specimens in the Dutch East Indies (more than 80,000 beetles alone). More than a thousand of them represented species new to science. \nHis observations of the clear zoological differences across a narrow strait in the archipelago led to his proposing the zoogeographical boundary now known as the Wallace Line. Bali and Lombok were two islands in the archipelago only 17 miles apart at the widest (28\u00a0km), roughly the same size and with the same climate, soil, elevation and aspect. Yet their flora and fauna were so different. \n\"In this archipelago there are two distinct faunas rigidly circumscribed, which differ as much as do those of Africa and South America... yet there is nothing on the map or on the face of the islands to mark their limits. The boundary line passes between islands closer together than others belonging to the same group. I believe the western part to be a separated portion of continental Asia, while the eastern is a fragmentary prolongation of a former west Pacific continent\".\nWhy was it, he wondered, that the animals and plants on the Bali side of the channel were of Asian types, while those on the Lombok side were Australasian in type? This had to mean that the western group had evolved from common western stock, while the eastern group had evolved from a common eastern stock. \nWhile he was exploring the archipelago, he refined his thoughts about evolution and had his famous insight on natural selection. In 1858 he sent an article outlining his theory to Darwin; it was published, along with a description of Darwin's own theory, in the same year.\nAccounts of his studies and adventures there were eventually published in 1869 as \"The Malay Archipelago\". It became one of the most popular natural history travel journals of the 19th century. It was praised by Charles Darwin and Charles Lyell and by others, such as the novelist Joseph Conrad, who called it his \"favorite bedside companion\".\nNatural selection.\nUnlike Darwin, Wallace began his career as a travelling naturalist already believing in evolution. Both he and Bates had read \"Vestiges\", a controversial work of popular science, published anonymously in 1844. This advocated an evolutionary origin for the solar system, the earth, and living things. He also read Malthus's \"Principle of population\", which he says \"twenty years later gave me the long-sought clue to the effective agent in the evolution of organic species\". He meant by that the struggle for existence, which led Wallace to \"natural selection\".\nWallace wrote his ideas on the small isle of \"Ternate\", in what was then the Dutch East Indies. He was suffering from malaria. While the natives looked after him, his thoughts turned to Malthus's book. \n\"I thought of [Malthus's] clear exposition of the 'positive checks to increase' \u2013 disease, accidents, wars, famine \u2013 which keep down the population... It then occurred to me that the same causes, or their equivalents, are\ncontinually acting in the case of animals also... Why do some die and some live? And the answer came clearly, that on the whole the best fitted live... Then it suddenly flashed upon me, that this self-acting process would necessarily improve the race...\" \nThis was the origin of his letter to Darwin, which set out the idea of natural selection.\nHis views on human evolution.\nIn 1864 Wallace published a paper, \"The origin of human races and the antiquity of Man deduced from the theory of natural selection\", applying the theory to human beings. Huxley had already published his view that evolution applied to mankind as it did to other living things.\nWallace thought that natural selection could not account for mathematical, artistic, or musical genius, as well as metaphysical musings, wit and humour. He eventually said that something in \"the unseen universe of Spirit\" had interceded at least three times in history. The first was the creation of life from inorganic matter. The second was the introduction of consciousness in the higher animals. And the third was the generation of the higher mental faculties in mankind. He also believed that the purpose of the universe was the development of the human spirit. \nMany, including Huxley, Hooker, and Darwin himself, were highly critical of these ideas. As one historian of science has pointed out, Wallace's views in this area were at odds with two major tenets of Darwinism. These are: evolution does not have a goal, and it is not aimed at or centered around mankind. It is thought by most biographers that his thinking on the evolution of man was influenced by his adoption of spiritualism, which happened at the same time.\nSpiritualism.\nWallace was not a believer in revealed religion of any kind, but he did believe in spiritualism. This has puzzled biographers, who struggle to think why such a man would believe in spirits. Early in his life, he experimented with hypnosis, which was then doubted and criticised. He used some of his students in Leicester as subjects, with considerable success. Apparently, this persuaded him not to reject ideas which were doubted. Even when Huxley told him that one of his favourite mediums was a proven fraud, he refused to believe it. He preferred the evidence of his own experience.\nWallace's public support of spiritualism, and his defence of spiritualist mediums against allegations of fraud, damaged his scientific reputation. It strained his relationships with friends such as Bates, Huxley and Darwin, who felt he was overly credulous. Others became openly hostile to Wallace over the issue. Wallace and other scientists who defended spiritualism were subject to much criticism from the press, with \"The Lancet\", the leading English medical journal, being particularly harsh. The controversy affected the public's idea of Wallace for the rest of his career, though he was always respected in other ways.\nOther interests.\nWallace had a wide range of interests, and wrote books about all of them. He wrote against vaccination, for phrenology, for spiritualism, for land nationalisation, against the moon having canals, and for social change and the progress and improvement of mankind. He did not believe in religion, but he did believe in spiritualism. He was a radical in politics, economics and social reform. He was a kind and honourable person, but he could be a tough opponent if he thought something unfair was going on. Even the titles of some of his books were sensational, as for example:\nBooks.\nWallace wrote about 22 books, depending on how one counts them.\nHis greatest works include:"}

He was widely admired, but his life came to a terrible end. Vavilov repeatedly criticised a powerful but poor scientist, Trofim Lysenko. As a result, Vavilov was arrested, and died of starvation in a prison in 1943. Today Vavilov's name stands high. The \"Vavilov Institute of Plant Industry\" in St. Petersburg is named after him.

Before herbicides, weeds were plucked by hand. This has been done for thousands of years. The weeds come to look like the crop because the weeders pick those weeds which look most different. Vavilovian mimicry is caused by unintentional selection by humans. The weeds that survive pass on their genes. Gradually, all the weeds look more like the crop plant.\nAn example is rye, a common Mediterranean species. Rye was originally just a weed growing with wheat and barley. Weeding made it like the crop. Like wheat, it came to have larger seeds and more rigid spindles to which the seeds are attached.\nRye is a tougher plant than wheat: it survives in harsher conditions. Having become a crop like the wheat, rye was able to become a crop plant in harsh areas, such as hills and mountains."}

Ray was the son of a village blacksmith who got to Cambridge University on a scholarship. This was in 1644, when the Puritans were making war against Charles I. When he got his bachelor's degree in 1648, he continued as a Fellow of Trinity College.\nRay was a Protestant dissenter who had accepted the return of Charles II. He was ordained as a priest of the Church of England, in London in 1660. By then, Charles II insisted that all priests sign an affadavit against the Puritan party. The Act of Uniformity of 1662 made the Book of Common Prayer compulsory in religious services, which was opposed by those of Puritan beliefs. Ray would not sign the affidavit, so he was forced to resign his Fellowship, and could not work as a priest.\nRay returned to his native village of Black Notley, near Braintree in Essex. After Ray joined up with a former student, Francis Willughby, the pair spent three years in continental Europe, discovering what the latest scientific ideas were. When he returned to England in Spring 1666, he joined the new Royal Society, and devoted himself to the study of natural history. His most important scientific works were supported financially by the Royal Society, whose President at a critical time in the 1680s was Samuel Pepys.\nRay published important works on plants, animals, and natural theology. His classification of plants in his \"Historia Plantarum\", was an important step towards modern taxonomy. Ray rejected the system by which species were classified according to an either/or type system. Instead he classified plants by observation according to similarities and differences. Thus he advanced scientific empiricism against the deductive rationalism of the scholastics. He was the first person to give a biological definition of the term \"species\".\nRay's works.\nRay published about 23 works, depending on how one counts them.

He is often said to be one of the best pianists of the 20 century.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nHorowitz was born in Kiev, which was a part of the Russian Empire at the time, to a Jewish family in 1903. He was the youngest of four children. His father was an engineer and his mother was a pianist. He first started piano lessons from his mother at an early age. In 1912 he joined Kiev University where he was taught by Vladimir Puchalsky, Sergei Tarnowsky, and Felix Blumenfeld. He performed Sergei Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 3 in D Minor on his graduation. He then performed his first solo concert in Kharkiv in 1920.\nHorowitz got more and more famous but was often paid in food rather than money because Russia wasn't very rich. Although performing in many concerts, he secretly wanted to be a composer. In 1925, he moved to the West, intending not to return.\nCareer in the West.\nOn January 2, 1926, Horowitz played his first concert outside of Russia. He then played in many other places, such as Berlin, Paris, and London. He gave his first concerts in the United States in 1928. \nWhen World War II started in 1939, Horowitz decided to live in the U. S. He became an American citizen in 1944. Horowitz was very proud of being an American, and decided to make a piano version of Sousa's The Stars and Stripes Forever. He played many concerts to raise money for the war effort, and he asked people to call him \"the American pianist.\" Horowitz began playing music written by an American composer, Samuel Barber, and gave the world\u2019s first performances of the Barber's Piano Sonata and Excursions.\nDuring World War II, Horowitz also played a lot of Russian music, giving the first performances in America of Prokofiev's Piano Sonatas Nos. 6, 7 and 8 (which were called \"War Sonatas\") and Kabalevsky's Piano Sonatas Nos. 2 and 3. \nHorowitz stopped playing concerts four times (1936 to 1938, 1953 to 1965, 1969 to 1974, and 1983 to 1985), as he was unsure that he was good enough, even when he was popular.\nHe made his television debut on September 22nd, 1968, in a concert at Carnegie Hall.\nStyle.\nHorowitz was most well known for playing music written between 1830 and 1920. His 1932 recording of the Liszt Sonata is still considered by many to be the best ever, even though many other pianists have recorded it. Other pieces he was famous for were Scriabin's \u00c9tude in D-sharp minor, Chopin's Ballade No. 1 in G minor, and many of Rachmaninoff\u2019s short pieces, including Polka de W.R. Horowitz was praised for his way of playing the Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto No. 3, and the composer said \"he swallowed it whole. He had the courage, the intensity, the daring.\" Horowitz later became good friends with Rachmaninoff. Horowitz was also well known for playing quieter works like Schumann's Scenes of Childhood, Scarlatti sonatas, and some Mozart and Haydn sonatas.\nHorowitz's way of playing often used large contrasts between soft and loud volumes. He was able to play louder than most other pianists, without making an ugly sound. His playing was also known for many different kinds of sounds \u2013 sometimes called \"tone colors\". Horowitz was also famous for playing precise passages in octaves very fast.\nRecordings.\nHorowitz began making recordings in 1928. He recorded for several record labels. His most famous early records were Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 3 with Albert Coates and the London Symphony Orchestra (the first time that piece was recorded) and Franz Liszt's Sonata in B minor. \nWhen Horowitz was not playing in public, he sometimes made recordings in his house. His recordings won many awards, and he continued recording until a few days before he died.\nThe last years.\nIn 1986, Horowitz told his friends that \u201cbefore I die, I want to see the land where I was born.\u201d So, he decided to play two concerts in Russia. At the time, Russia and the United States were trying to be more friendly with each other, and Horowitz\u2019s concerts were part of that effort. The concert in Russia\u2019s capitol, Moscow, was shown on TV, and people in the audience could be seen wiping tears from their eyes.\nWhen Horowitz returned to the United States, President Ronald Reagan gave him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\nVladimir Horowitz died on November 5, 1989 in New York of a heart attack. He was 86."}
{"id": "199814", "revid": "68157", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=199814", "title": "Thomas Henry Huxley", "text": "Thomas Henry Huxley PC PRS (4 May 1825 \u2013 29 June 1895) was an English biologist who specialised in comparative anatomy. He was born in Ealing, Middlesex. He was a friend and supporter of Charles Darwin, and had a public career. He was a member of ten Royal Commissions.\nToday he is sometimes called \"Darwin's Bulldog\" for his support of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. However, this term was not used during his lifetime. Huxley was slow to accept some of Darwin's ideas, but he was wholehearted in his public support of Darwin.\nHuxley's 1860 debate with the English Bishop Samuel Wilberforce was a famous public event. The debate was about evolution, and it was widely reported in the press. Many thought Huxley won that debate, which helped Huxley's career, and the theory of evolution. \nHuxley also developed scientific education in Britain, and fought against the more extreme forms of religion. These activities had a big effect on the way people in Britain and elsewhere thought about the world. Huxley used the term \"agnostic\" to say that he did not know if there is a god or not. We continue to use the term \"agnostic\" today. Huxley was for many years a close friend of the Irish physicist John Tyndall. \nHuxley had little schooling, and taught himself almost everything he knew. Remarkably, he became a great anatomist and zoologist. Later, he discussed the evolution of man and the apes. Another of his ideas was that birds evolved from small carnivorous dinosaurs, which is now known to be true.\nHuxley died in Eastbourne, Sussex. Three of his grandsons became famous in the 20th century.\nVoyage round the world.\nAs a young man, Huxley went on a long voyage of discovery to the southern continents. He was Assistant to the Surgeon on the Royal Navy ship HMS \"Rattlesnake\". What he did was to collect sea animals, and study them. He went ashore in New Guinea and the eastern coast of Australia, to study the animals, and the native peoples. He fell in love with a girl in Sydney, Australia, and some years later they married and had children.\nHuxley on Man.\nFor nearly ten years he worked on the relationship of man to the apes. This led him into a clash with Richard Owen, a man who was disliked for his behaviour, but admired for his skill. The struggle between them ended in some severe defeats for Owen.\nHuxley's public lectures grew into his most famous work \"Man's place in Nature\" (1863). There he deals with the evolution of man, before Charles Darwin published his \"Descent of Man\" in 1871.\nIn the book Huxley gives evidence for the evolution of man and apes from a common ancestor. It was the first book devoted to the topic of human evolution. The book proposed to a wide readership that \"evolution applied as fully to man as to all other life\".\nPublic work.\nHuxley was an important public figure. When he was young there were virtually no biology degrees in British universities, and few courses. Most biologists of his day were either self-taught, or took medical degrees. By the time he retired there were professors in biology in most universities, and a broad agreement on what should be taught. Huxley was the single most influential person in this transformation. Huxley was for about thirty years evolution's most effective champion. For some, Huxley was \"\"the\" leading English spokesman for science in the nineteenth century\".\nSchools and the Bible.\nHuxley supported the reading of the Bible in schools. Huxley was against organised religion, but he thought the Bible's moral teachings and use of language helped English life. \"I do not advocate burning your ship to get rid of the cockroaches\".\nHowever, what Huxley proposed was to create an \"edited version\" of the Bible, without \"shortcomings and errors... These tender children [should] not be taught that which you do not yourselves believe\". The London School Board voted against his idea, but it also voted against the idea that public money should be used to support students attending church schools. Vigorous debate took place on such points, and the debates were written down in detail. Huxley said \"I will never be a party to enabling the state to sweep the children of this country into denominational schools\". The Act of Parliament which founded board schools allowed the reading of the Bible, but did not permit any particular religious doctrine to be taught.\nIt may be right to see Huxley as helping the secularisation of British society which gradually occurred over the following century. Ernst Mayr said \"It can hardly be doubted that [biology] has helped to undermine traditional beliefs and value systems\". Huxley more than anyone else was responsible for this trend in Britain.\nRoyal Commissions.\nHuxley worked on ten Royal and other commissions. The subjects included medical law, contagious diseases, vivisection; fisheries; universities in Scotland, and science education in Ireland. He was Inspector of Fisheries 1881\u201385, and held many awards from many universities. He was President of the Royal Society from 1883\u20131885. The British state made him a Privy Councillor, as a reward for his public work."}

He was a central figure in the field of evolutionary biology for his work on the fruit-fly \"Drosophila\". He did research on these flies in California, mostly on populations of \"Drosophila pseudoobscura\". \nDobzhansky was important in the modern evolutionary synthesis, which was the synthesis of evolutionary biology with genetics.\nUkraine and Russia.\nAt school Dobzhansky collected butterflies and beetles, and studied biology at Kiev University. After graduation he moved to St Petersburg (then called Leningrad), and studied under Yuri Filipchenko, who had a \"Drosophila\" lab. Dobzhansky collected Coccinellidae (ladybird beetles) in the wild, and explored their genetics.\nAmerica.\nDobzhansky emigrated to the United States in 1927. He worked with Thomas Hunt Morgan at Columbia University, who had pioneered the use of fruit flies (\"Drosophila melanogaster\") in genetics experiments. He followed Morgan to the California Institute of Technology from 1930 to 1940. Dobzhansky took fruit fly research out of the laboratory and into the field. He discovered that regional varieties of flies were more similar to each other genetically than to flies from other regions.\nIn 1937 Dobzhansky published one of the major works of the modern evolutionary synthesis, entitled \"Genetics and the Origin of Species\". He defined evolution as \"a change in the allele frequency within a gene pool\". It is through changes in the proportion of alleles in a population that evolution takes place. Also in 1937, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. During this time he had a falling out with one of his \"Drosophila\" collaborators, Alfred Sturtevant, based perhaps on professional competition. \nDobzhansky returned to Columbia University from 1940 to 1962. He was one of the signatories of the 1950 UNESCO statement \"The Race Question\". He then moved to the Rockefeller University) until his retirement in 1971."}

He was born in London, and died there. He was a proponent of natural selection, and a leading figure in the modern evolutionary synthesis.\nHe was Secretary of the Zoological Society of London (1935\u20131942), the first Director of UNESCO, and a founding member of the World Wildlife Fund.\nHuxley came from the distinguished Huxley family. His brother was the writer Aldous Huxley, and his half-brother, a fellow biologist and Nobel laureate, Andrew Huxley; and his paternal grandfather was Thomas Henry Huxley, a friend and supporter of Charles Darwin and proponent of evolution.\nHuxley was well known for his presentation of science in books and articles, and on radio and television. He was awarded UNESCO's \"Kalinga Prize\" for the popularisation of science in 1953, the \"Darwin Medal\" of the Royal Society in 1956, and the \"Darwin-Wallace medal\" of the Linnean Society in 1958. He was also knighted in that same year, 1958, a hundred years after Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace announced the theory of evolution by natural selection. In 1959 he received a Special Award of the Lasker Foundation in the category Planned Parenthood \u2013 World Population. Huxley was a prominent member of the British Eugenics Society.\nEarly work.\nHis particular interest was bird behaviour, especially the courtship of water birds. His observations on the ethology of the Great Crested Grebe, published in 1914, was a landmark in avian field research. His invention of vivid labels for the rituals (such as 'penguin dance', 'plesiosaurus race' etc.) made the ideas memorable and interesting to the general reader.\nEvolution.\nHuxley was the most important biologist after August Weismann to insist on natural selection as the primary agent in evolution. A fine communicator, he was a prominent populariser of biological science to the public. In the early 20th century he was one of the minority of biologists who believed that natural selection was the main driving force of evolution, and that evolution occurred by small steps and not by jumps. These opinions are now standard. Though his time as an academic was quite brief, he taught and encouraged a number of evolutionary biologists at the University of Oxford in the 1920s.\nModern evolutionary synthesis.\nHuxley was a key figure in the modern evolutionary synthesis. This explained how the discoveries of Gregor Mendel on genetics fitted with Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by means of natural selection. Huxley's \nHuxley's first 'trial run' was the treatment of evolution in the \"Science of Life\" (1929\u201330), and in 1936 he published a long and significant paper for the British Association. In 1938 came three lengthy reviews on major evolutionary topics.\nNow it was time for Huxley to tackle the subject of evolution at full length, in what became the defining work of his life. His book ' was written whilst he was Secretary to the Zoological Society, and made use of his remarkable collection of reprints covering the first part of the century. It was published in 1942. Reviews of the book in learned journals were little short of ecstatic; the American Naturalist called it \"The outstanding evolutionary treatise of the decade, perhaps of the century. The approach is thoroughly scientific; the command of basic information amazing\".\nHuxley's main co-respondents in the modern evolutionary synthesis are usually listed as Ernst Mayr, Theodosius Dobzhansky, George Gaylord Simpson, Bernhard Rensch, Ledyard Stebbins and the population geneticists J.B.S. Haldane, Ronald Fisher and Sewall Wright. However, at the time of Huxley's book, several of these had yet to make their distinctive contribution. E.B. Ford and his co-workers in ecological genetics were at least as important.\nEvolutionary progress.\nHe always believed that on a broad view evolution led to advances in organisation. \"Progress without a goal\" was one of his favourite phrases.\nIn the final chapter of his \"Evolution the modern synthesis\" he defines evolutionary progress as \"a raising of the upper level of biological efficiency, this being defined as increased control over and independence of the environment. \"Natural selection plus time produces biological improvement... Improvements in biological machinery... the limbs and teeth of grazing horses... the increase in brain-power... The eyes of a dragon-fly, which can see all round [it] in every direction, are an improvement over the mere microscopic eye-spots of early forms of life\". \"[Over] the whole range of evolutionary time we see general advance \u2014 improvement in all the main properties of life, including its general organization. [But] improvement is not universal. Lower forms manage to survive alongside higher\".\nEugenics.\nHuxley was a prominent member of the British Eugenics Society, and was vice-president (1937\u20131944) and President (1959\u20131962). Huxley was one of many intellectuals at the time who believed that the lowest class in society was genetically inferior. He advocated \"the virtual elimination of the few lowest and most degenerate types\". In his writing he used this argument several times: \"no-one doubts the wisdom of managing the germ-plasm of agricultural stocks, so why not apply the same concept to human stocks?\".\nIn the post-war years, after the realisation that eugenic ideas had become tainted by the Nazis, Huxley (1957) coined the term \"transhumanism\" to describe the view that man should better himself through science and technology, possibly including eugenics, but also, importantly, the improvement of the social environment.\nUNESCO and race.\nIn response to the rise of European fascism in the 1930s Huxley was asked to write \"We Europeans\" with three other scientists. Huxley suggested the word 'race' be replaced with ethnic group. After the Second World War he was instrumental in producing the UNESCO statement \"The Race Question\", which asserted that:\n\"A race, from the biological standpoint, may therefore be defined as one of the group of populations constituting the species \"Homo sapiens\"\"... \"Now what has the scientist to say about the groups of mankind which may be recognized at the present time? Human races can be and have been differently classified by different anthropologists, but at the present time most anthropologists agree on classifying the greater part of present-day mankind into three major divisions, as follows: The Mongoloid Division; The Negroid Division; The Caucasoid Division.\"... \"Catholics, Protestants, Moslems and Jews are not races...\" \nBooks.\nThis is a selection of Huxley's most influential books:"}

{"id": "199951", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=199951", "title": "Mycorrhiza", "text": "A mycorrhiza (Greek for \"fungus roots\") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant.\nIn a mycorrhiza, the fungus lives inside the plant roots, and in the earth. The fungal hyphae are more efficient than plant roots at absorbing nutrients.\nMycorrhizas are important for plant growth in many ecosystems. At least 80% of all land plant species (and over 90% of families) have mycorrhiza. They depend on it for survival. They are the most common symbionts in the plant kingdom: they involve about 6000 species of fungi and 240,000 species of plants.\nMycorrhizas are divided onto two main types: ectomycorrhiza and endomycorrhiza. \nThe hyphae of ectomycorrhizal fungi do not penetrate individual cells within the root, while the hyphae of endomycorrhizal fungi penetrate the cell wall and invaginate the cell membrane. \nThe mycorrhizal symbiosis is ancient, dating to at least 400 million years ago.\nHow it works.\nThis mutualism gives the fungus sugars, such as glucose and sucrose produced by the plant in photosynthesis. \nThe carbohydrates move from their source (usually leaves) to the root and then to the fungal partner. In return, the plant gains the use of the mycelium's very large surface area to absorb water and mineral nutrients from the soil, especially phosphorus.\nThe mechanisms of increased absorption are both physical and chemical. Mycorrhizal mycelia are much smaller in diameter than the smallest root. They can explore a greater volume of soil, providing a larger surface area for absorption: \"It is estimated that every kilogram of soil contains at least 200 km of fungi strands\".\nAdvantages.\nMycorrhizal plants are often more resistant to diseases, such as those caused by microbial soil-borne pathogens, and are also more resistant to the effects of drought. These effects are perhaps due to the improved water and mineral uptake in mycorrhizal plants. \nMycorrhiza is especially advantageous to the plant in nutrient-poor soils. Plants grown in sterile soils and growth media often perform poorly without the addition of spores or hyphae of mycorrhizal fungi to colonise the plant roots and aid in the uptake of soil mineral nutrients. The absence of mycorrhizal fungi can also slow plant growth in harsh areas.\nThe fungal partners may also help plant-to-plant transfer of sugars and other nutrients. Such mycorrhizal communities are called \"common mycorrhizal networks\". \nSome species inhabit the tissues inside roots, stems, and leaves, in which case they are called \"endophytes\". \nSimilar to mycorrhiza, endophytic colonization by fungi may benefit both partners. Endophytes of grasses give their host more resistance to grazers and get food and shelter from the plant in return.\nBacteria in mycorrhiza.\nMycorrhizal roots offer excellent ecological niches for other microbes. Mycorrhizal fungi may host bacteria that complete their life cycles within fungal cells. One of the best known is \"Geosiphon pyriforme\", which can host cyanobacteria inside characteristic bladders.\nArbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) fungi are unique in hosting bacteria in their cytoplasm. Intracellular structures very similar to bacteria were first described in the 1970s. Research later identified them as true bacteria."}

He influenced the great scientists of his day: John Herschel, Charles Darwin, Charles Lyell and Michael Faraday. He invented many terms we use today, such as \"scientist\" (in 1837).\nThe son of a carpenter, Whewell rose to the top. For 28 years he was a Professor, and for 25 years he was Master of Trinity College, Cambridge. He was one of the founding members and a president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, a Fellow of the Royal Society, and President of the Geological Society. It was the Prime Minister himself, Robert Peel, who recommended his appointment as Master of Trinity.\nWhewell had wide interests. He researched ocean tides (for which he won the Royal Medal). He published work in mechanics, physics, geology, astronomy, and economics. He composed poetry, wrote books, translated the works of Goethe, and wrote sermons and theological tracts.\nHistory &amp; philosophy of science.\nWhewell's five volumes of the \"History and Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences\" are his major work. Science was then still a novel activity. The scientists themselves held differing views as to how best to go about their work. Whewell provided a theoretical framework, and the framework provoked a great deal of debate. There was also a long-running discussion with John Stuart Mill about social and economic philosophy."}

It normally consists of a metal frame (rectangular or circular in shape) supporting a flat jumping surface connected to the frame by springs. The jumping surface may be of a strong synthetic fabric material or, mostly, of a mesh design. Trampolines allow users to bounce higher by storing energy in the springs as they land on the surface which then accelerates the user back away from the jumping surface as the springs contract.\nThe first modern trampoline was invented by George Nissen in 1920-1922 as a kind of equipment for gymnastics.\nDuring World War II, the United States Navy Flight School developed the use of the trampoline in its training of pilots and navigators, giving them concentrated practice in spatial orientation that had not been possible before. After the war, the development of the space flight program again brought the trampoline into use to help train both American and Soviet astronauts, giving them experience of variable body positions in flight."}

He led the Confederacy during the American Civil War. He was President of the Confederate States of America for its entire history, from 1861 to 1865.\nEarly life.\nDavis was born on June 3, 1808 in Christian County, Kentucky, the last child of ten of Jane (n\u00e9e Cook) and Samuel Emory Davis. Both of Davis' paternal grandparents had immigrated to North America from the region of Snowdonia in the North of Wales; the rest of his ancestry can be traced to England. Davis' paternal grandfather, Evan, married Lydia Emory Williams. Samuel Emory Davis was born to them in 1756. Lydia had two sons from a previous marriage. Samuel served in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, along with his two older half-brothers. In 1783, after the war, he married Jane Cook (also born in Christian County, in 1759 to William Cook and his wife Sarah Simpson). Samuel died on July 4, 1824, when Jefferson was 16 years old. Jane died on October 3, 1845.\nEducation.\nIn 1811 he moved to St. Mary Parish, Louisiana, and later to Wilkinson County, Mississippi. In 1813 Davis began his education at the Wilkinson Academy, near the family cotton plantation in the small town of Woodville. Two years later, Davis entered the Catholic school of Saint Thomas at St. Rose Priory. At the time, he was the only Protestant student at the school. Davis went on to Jefferson College at Washington, Mississippi, in 1818, and then to Transylvania University at Lexington, Kentucky, in 1821. In 1828 he graduated from the United States Military Academy. He was an officer in the United States Army until 1835.\nLater political career.\nOn February 9, 1861, after Davis resigned from the United States Senate, he was selected to be the provisional President of the Confederate States of America; he was elected without opposition to a six-year term that November. During his presidency, Davis took charge of the Confederate war plans but was unable to find a strategy to stop the larger, more powerful and better organized Union. His diplomatic efforts failed to gain recognition from any foreign country, and he paid little attention to the collapsing Confederate economy, printing more and more paper money to cover the war's expenses.\nHistorians have criticized Davis for being a much less effective war leader than his Union counterpart Abraham Lincoln, which they attribute to Davis being overbearing, controlling, and overly meddlesome, as well as being out of touch with public opinion, and lacking support from a political party (since the Confederacy had no political parties). His preoccupation with detail, reluctance to delegate responsibility, lack of popular appeal, feuds with powerful state governors, inability to get along with people who disagreed with him, and neglect of civil matters in favor of military ones all worked against him.\nLater life.\nAfter Davis was captured on May 10, 1865, he was charged with treason. Although he was not tried, he was stripped of his eligibility to run for public office; Congress later lifted this restriction in 1978, 89 years after his death. Many Southerners felt bad with his arrest, refusal to accept defeat, and resistance to Reconstruction. Over time, admiration for his pride and ideals made him a Civil War hero to many Southerners, and his legacy became part of the foundation of the postwar New South. By the late 1880s, Davis began to encourage reconciliation, telling Southerners to be loyal to the Union. He was helped in the last decade of his life by the generosity of Sarah Anne Ellis Dorsey, a rich widow. First she invited him to her plantation in 1877 near Biloxi, Mississippi, at a time when he was sick, and gave him a cottage to use for working on his memoir. She gave Davis her plantation before her death in 1878, and she also gave him a fund for his support. This made him to live in some comfort with his wife until his death on December 6, 1889 in New Orleans, Louisiana from bronchitis. He was 81 years old."}

Hooker was one of the founders of geographical botany, and Charles Darwin's closest friend. He was Director of the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, for twenty years, in succession to his father, William Jackson Hooker, and was awarded the highest honours of British science.\nVoyages.\nAntarctic 1839\u20131843.\nThe expedition consisted of two ships, HMS \"Erebus\" and HMS \"Terror\"; it was the last major voyage of exploration made entirely under sail. Hooker was the youngest of the 128 man crew. He sailed on the \"Erebus\" and was assistant to the ship's surgeon, who was instructed to collect zoological and geological specimens. The ships travelled all over the southern oceans from South America to Australia and New Zealand. Hooker made plant collections at each location and while travelling drew these and specimens of algae and sea life pulled aboard using tow nets.\nAfter spending 5 months in the Antarctic they returned to resupply in Hobart, then went on to Sydney, and New Zealand. They left New Zealand to return to Antarctica. After spending 138 days at sea, and a collision between the \"Erebus\" and \"Terror,\" they sailed to the Falkland Islands, to Tierra del Fuego, back to the Falklands and onward to their third sortie into the Antarctic. The ships arrived back in England on 4 September 1843; the voyage had been a success for Ross as it was the first to confirm the existence of the southern continent and chart much of its coastline.\nHimalayas and India 1847\u20131851.\nOn 11 November 1847 Hooker left England for his three year long Himalayan expedition; he would be the first European to collect plants in the Himalayas. Hooker's expedition was based in Darjeeling. Hooker wrote to Darwin relaying to him the habits of animals in India, and collected plants in Bengal.\nHooker and a sizable party of local assistants departed for eastern Nepal on 27 October 1848. They travelled north west along Nepal's passes into Tibet. In April 1849 he started on a longer expedition into Sikkim, but he was imprisoned by the Dewan of Sikkim when they were travelling towards Tibet. A British team was sent to negotiate: they were released without bloodshed. Hooker returned to Darjeeling where he spent January and February 1850 writing his journals, replacing specimens lost during his detention and planning a journey for his last year in India.\nHooker's survey of hitherto unexplored regions, the \"Himalayan Journals\" was published in 1854.\nPalestine 1860.\nThis trip was taken in the autumn of 1860, with Daniel Hanbury. They visited and collected in Syria and Palestine; no full-length report was published, but a number of papers were written. Hooker recognised three phytogeograpical divisions: Western Syria and Palestine; Eastern Syria and Palestine; Middle and Upper mountain regions of Syria.\nMorocco 1871.\nHooker visited Morocco from April to June 1871, in the company of John Ball, George Maw and a young gardener from Kew, called Crump.\nWestern United States 1877.\nThis was undertaken with his friend Asa Gray, the leading American botanist of the day. \"A difficult question was why in the great mountain chains of the Western United States there appeared to be only a few botanical enclaves of plants of eastern-Asiatic affinities among plants of Mexican and more southern types.\" Hooker was back in Kew with 1,000 dried specimens by October.\nSome idea of the delights he encountered (trivia from his journal &amp; letters):\nHis views on the flora of Colorado and Utah: There are two temperate, and two cold or mountain floras, viz: 1. a prairie flora derived from the eastward; 2. a so-called desert and saline flora derived from the west; 3. a subalpine; 4. an alpine flora, the two latter of widely different origin, and in one sense proper to the Rocky Mountain ranges.\nDarwin and evolution.\nWhile on the \"Erebus\", Hooker had read proofs of Charles Darwin's \"The Voyage of the Beagle\" provided by Charles Lyell and had been very impressed by Darwin's skill as a naturalist. They had met once, before the Antarctic voyage started. After Hooker's return to England, he was approached by Darwin who invited him to classify the plants that Darwin had collected in South America and the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. Hooker agreed and the pair began a life-long friendship. On 11 January 1844 Darwin mentioned to Hooker his early ideas on the evolution and natural selection, and Hooker showed interest. In 1847 he agreed to read Darwin's \"Essay\" explaining the theory, and responded with notes giving Darwin calm critical feedback. Their correspondence continued throughout the development of Darwin's theory and in 1858 Darwin wrote that Hooker was \"the one living soul from whom I have constantly received sympathy\".\nRichard Freeman wrote: \"Hooker was Charles Darwin's greatest friend and confidant\". Certainly they had extensive correspondence, and they also met face-to-face (Hooker visiting Darwin). Hooker and Lyell were the two people Darwin consulted (by letter) when Wallace's famous letter arrived at Down House, enclosing his paper on natural selection. Hooker was instrumental in creating the device whereby the Wallace paper was accompanied by Darwin's notes and his letter to Asa Gray (showing his prior realization of natural selection) in a presentation to the Linnean Society. Hooker was the one who formally presented this material to the Linnean Society meeting in 1858. In 1859 the author of \"The Origin of Species\" recorded his indebtedness to Hooker's wide knowledge and balanced judgment.\nIn December 1859, Hooker published the \"Introductory Essay to the Flora Tasmaniae\", the final part of the Botany of the Antarctic Voyage. It was in this essay (which appeared just one month after the publication of Charles Darwin's \"On the Origin of Species\"), that Hooker announced his support for the theory of evolution by natural selection, thus becoming the first recognised man of science to publicly back Darwin.\nAt the historic debate on evolution held at the Oxford on 30 June 1860, Bishop Samuel Wilberforce, Benjamin Brodie and Robert FitzRoy spoke against Darwin's theory, and Hooker and Thomas Henry Huxley defended it. According to Hooker's own account, it was he and not Huxley who delivered the most effective reply to Wilberforce's arguments.\nHooker acted as president of the British Association at its Norwich meeting of 1868, when his address was remarkable for its championship of Darwinian theories. Hooker was a close friend of Thomas Henry Huxley, a member of the X-Club (which dominated the Royal Society in the 1870s and early 1880s), and the first of the three X-Clubbers in succession to become President of the Royal Society.\nKew.\nBy his travels and his publications, Hooker built up a high scientific reputation at home. In 1855 he was appointed Assistant-Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and in 1865 he succeeded his father as Director, holding the post for twenty years. Under the Hookers, the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew rose to world renown. At the age of thirty, Hooker was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1873 he was chosen as its President (until 1877). He received three of its medals: the Royal Medal in 1854, the Copley Medal in 1887 and the Darwin Medal in 1892. He continued to intersperse work at Kew with foreign exploration and collecting. His journeys to Palestine, Morocco and the United States all produced valuable information and specimens for Kew."}

They became extremely famous in Europe in the early part of the 20th century. \nThe group was formed and directed by the Russian Sergei Diaghilev. The Ballets Russes had more influence on ballet and ballet music than any other ballet company of their time. The dancers were from Russia, but the group travelled throughout Europe, spending a lot of their time based in Paris. Stravinsky was one of the many composers who wrote ballet music for them.\nSergei Diaghilev was an impresario who was extremely good at spotting good dancers and helping them to rise to great standards. He had very good taste in art and music and inspired some great composers to write music for his dancers. He got some of the most famous painters of his time to make set designs for his productions.\nHistory of the ballet group.\nThe group was started in 1909. By 1911 they had become a group who toured regularly. Many of the dancers had come from the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg. They adapted the productions from the Mariinsky Theatre, performing ballets such as \"Prince Igor\", \"Cleopatra\" and \"Le Festin\" and \"Les Sylphides\".\nDuring the World War I they were cut off from any contact with Russia. During these years they experimented with many new ideas. Productions such as \"Les Biches\" and \"Le Train Bleu\" were about the fashionable society around them. At the same time the company also had productions which reflected Russian folklore, Greek legends and the Orient.\nTheir fame continued after the war. \nWhen Diaghilev died suddenly in 1929 the Ballets Russes broke up and the dancers moved to other companies. Some of them formed the \"Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo\", who travelled to America and influenced dancing there.\nThe choreographers.\nThe company worked with several very famous choreographers such as Marius Petipa, Michel Fokine, Vaslav Nijinsky, Leonide Massine, and the young George Balanchine. Nijinsky\u2019s dances reflect the art movement called Expressionism. Many of his new ideas could be seen in \"L'Apres-midi d'un Faune\" and \"The Rite of Spring\".\nDancers.\nThe Ballets Russes had many famous dancers. Many of them were from the Russian Imperial Theatres and they came to dance for Ballets Russes during the summer months. Some of the great dancers include Anna Pavlova, Tamara Karsavina, Olga Spessivtzeva, Mathilde Kschessinska, Ida Rubinstein, Bronislava Nijinska, Lydia Lopokova and Alicia Markova.\nThe company was particularly influential because they treated male dancers as important. Up until this time the female dancers had much more attention than the male dancers. Among the male dancers were Michel Fokine, Serge Lifar, L\u00e9onide Massine, George Balanchine, Adolphe Bolm, and, especially, Vaslav Nijinsky who became the greatest dancer of his time.\nMusic.\nThe most famous music composed for Ballets Russes was that by the composer Igor Stravinsky. His ballets include \"The Firebird\", \"Petrouchka\", \"The Rite of Spring\", \"Les Noces\" and \"Apollon musag\u00e8te\". The first time that \"The Rite of Spring\" was performed many in the audience hated it and booed and started to fight. Others thought it was brilliant. Stravinsky's music was original and shocking, and Nijinsky's choreography went beyond classical ballet technique. The audience found it difficult to understand the music and dance. They were used to the romantic music and classical ballet of the nineteenth century.\nDiaghilev also used music which had already been composed. This included music by Debussy, Ravel, Darius Milhaud, Prokofiev and other famous composers of the time.\nSet and costume design.\nThe artists and designers who worked for the ballet included some of the 20th century's most famous names. Picasso, Bakst, Braque, Matisse, Coco Chanel, Mir\u00f3, Dali, and Utrillo were some of the best-known."}

He formed a ballet company called \"Les Ballets Russes de Serge Diaghilev\". Many think it was the greatest ballet company of all time.\nFor twenty years, between 1909 and 1929, they were the most famous ballet company in the world. Many of their ideas influenced art and music as well as dance. Diaghilev got some of the world's greatest painters to design sets for his productions, and some great composers, including Igor Stravinsky, to compose music for the ballets.\nHis dancers included the legendary Nijinsky and the Imperial prima ballerina Karsavina; also Pavlova, Danilova and Spessivtseva. His choreographers included Fokine, Nijinska, Massine and Balanchine; his composers included Stravinsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, Prokofiev, Ravel and Debussy; his set designers included Picasso, Cezanne, Matisse, Utrillo, Bakst and Braque; Cocteau worked as an artist and wrote scenarios. The ballets created and the performances changed the course of ballet history.\nDiaghilev's gift lay in spotting talent, and bringing great artists to work together. He also persuaded patrons to support the \"Ballets Russes\". The production costs were enormous, and were not always covered by the ticket prices. The repertoire (list) of new ballets and new music grew, and the productions were not always successful. Diaghilev's company folded soon after his death, though many of the group worked together in new companies.\nDiaghilev was homosexual. He died of diabetes."}

By its population and economic activity, it is the second-most important city in the country, after Santo Domingo.\nHistory.\nChristopher Columbus built a small fort in the summer of 1495, on the northern side of the Yaque del Norte river in a place named \"La Emboscada\". This is several kilometres to the west of the present city. Columbus named the fort after \"Santiago Ap\u00f3stol\", in English \"Saint James\"\nIn 1504, Nicol\u00e1s de Ovando, governor of the Hispaniola, moved the town to Jacagua which is now the municipal district of San Francisco de Jacagua. This place was near the mountains and away from the river Yaque del Norte.\nAn earthquake destroyed the city of Santiago on 2 December 1562. The next year, 1563, the city was rebuilt again on the north side of the river Yaque del Norte but this time more to the east, where it is now. This new town was called \"Santiago de los Caballeros\", in English, \"Saint James of the Knights\" or, better, \"Knights of Saint James\".\nPopulation.\nThe city had, in , a total population of 591,985: 288,746 men and 303,239 women. The urban population was of the total population.\nThe people from this city are called (demonym) in different ways; \"santiaguero\" for males and \"santiaguera\" for females. Sometimes \"santiagu\u00e9s\" is used for both sexes. \"Santiaguense\" (for both sexes) is used to differentiate them from people of other cities with the same name in Spain, Cuba, Chile, and Argentina).\nGeography.\nThe municipality of Santiago de los Caballeros has a total area of . It has five municipal districts (a municipal district is a subdivision of a municipality).

The city of Santiago de los Caballeros is on the southern side of those mountains, and even some parts of the city are on the mountains.\nThere are several small hills in the city; the highest is the \"Cerro del Castillo\" (\"Castle Hill\") in the eastern part of the city; on this hill there is a monument: the \"Monumento a los H\u00e9roes de la Restauraci\u00f3n\" ( \"Monument to the Restoration War Heroes\"), commonly named only as the \"Monumento\".\nRivers.\nThe river \"Yaque del Norte\", the longest of the Dominican Republic, flows along the old southern side of the city. Now, the city is on both sides of the river but most people still lives on the northern (right) side of it. Other rivers are Nibaje and Gurabito but they are very small and tributaries of the Yaque del Norte.\nClimate.\nThe city of Santiago de los Caballeros is located in the northeastern part of the \"Yaque del Norte Valley\", a very dry and hot region.

She was most well known for her poetry, but she also wrote novels, children's books, short stories, book reviews, and newspaper articles. Her most well-known novel is \"The Bell Jar\", which was partly based on her life. She married another famous poet, Ted Hughes. She died by suicide in 1963.\nEarly life.\nPlath was born in 1932 in Boston, Massachusetts. Her parents were Otto Emil Plath and Aurelia Schober Plath. Her father was from Germany; her mother was Austrian-American. He was a college professor and wrote a book about bumblebees. Aurelia Plath was twenty-two years younger than her husband. In April 1935, Plath's younger brother Warren was born. The family moved from Jamaica Plain to Winthrop, Massachusetts in 1936. This was where Aurelia had grown up. Plath published her first poem here, when she was eight. It was in the children's section of a newspaper called the \"Boston Herald\".\nIn 1940, Otto Plath died. He was buried in Winthrop cemetery. In 1942, Aurelia and the children moved to Wellesley, Massachusetts.\nCollege.\nPlath went to Smith College. After her third year, she became a guest editor for a magazine called \"Mademoiselle\", and spent a month in New York City. At this time, she became depressed. She tried to kill herself by taking too many sleeping pills. After she took the pills, she crawled underneath her house, but she was found and taken to hospital. She went to a mental hospital called McLean Hospital and was treated for her depression. She was given both insulin shock treatment and electric shock therapy. She began to improve and returned to Smith College for the second semester in January 1954. She graduated from Smith College in 1955.\nPlath then went to the University of Cambridge in England, on a Fulbright scholarship. She attended Newnham College, Cambridge and carried on writing poetry and prose. She also wrote for the student newspaper, \"Varsity\", at Cambridge. At a party she met an English poet called Ted Hughes. She married him on June 16, 1956.\nLater life.\nAfter they were married, Plath and Hughes went to live in the United States. Plath taught at her old college, Smith College. They met and became friends with a poet named W. S. Merwin. In mid-1959, Plath became pregnant and after a cross-country trip of the United States and several months at the artists colony Yaddo, in Saratoga Springs, New York and they moved back to England. They lived in London initially, and then in a small town in Devon called North Tawton. Plath published her first collection of poems, \"The Colossus\". In February 1961 she had a miscarriage, which she wrote about in some of her poems.\nIn the early summer of 1962, Hughes began an affair with a woman called Assia Wevill. Plath and Hughes separated (lived apart) in 1962. Plath moved to London with their children, Frieda and Nicholas.\nDeath.\nIn 1963, Plath committed suicide at her London home. She sealed the room she was in with wet towels, turned the gas oven on and put her head inside the oven. She died because she was poisoned by carbon monoxide gas. Some people think that she did not mean to kill herself. She was buried in a small village in West Yorkshire called Heptonstall."}

Maximilian was thus a member of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine, a female-line cadet branch of the House of Habsburg. His older brother was the reigning Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria and their mother was Princess Sophie of Bavaria, a member of the House of Wittelsbach.\nMany Europeans, and Viennese in particular, suspected that he was actually fathered by Napoleon II of France. There was a close relationship between Sophie and Napoleon II. It was said that Sophie never recovered after his death and that she blamed it on Metternich for the rest of her life.\nMaximilian ruled as the Emperor of Mexico from 1864 to 1867. He was installed by occupying French forces under Napoleon III. When the French left in 1867, Maximilian refused to go with them, believing he had the support of the people.\nMaximilian was shocked by the living conditions of the poor in contrast to the magnificent haciendas of the upper class. His wife Empress Carlota of Mexico began holding parties for the wealthy Mexicans to raise money for poor houses. One of Maximilian's first acts as Emperor was to restrict working hours and abolish child labour. He cancelled all debts for peasants over 10 pesos, restored communal property and forbade all forms of corporal punishment. He supported land reforms, religious freedom, and extending the right to vote beyond the landholding class. These liberal policies caused opposition from the wealthy and the landowners, led by Benito Ju\u00e1rez under the banner of republicanism.\nMaximilian was captured by Benito Juarez\u2019s Republican forces and executed by firing squad on 19 June 1867."}

It can also be a formal admission to adulthood in a community. Rites of passage such as Christian baptism or confirmation, or Jewish bar or bat mitzvah, or graduation from school, are initiations. Acceptance into a fraternal organization like the freemasons or religious order like the Benedictines is also an initiation. A person taking the initiation ceremony is called an \"initiate\".\nEtymology.\nThe English word comes from the Latin, \"initium\": \"entrance\" or \"beginning. The related English verb, initiate, means to begin or start a particular action.\nTribal initiations.\nTribes often have initiations. In many African tribes, initiation means circumcision of males and sometimes circumcision/genital mutilation of females. Initiation is thought to be necessary for the individual to be regarded as a full member of the tribe. Otherwise, the individual may not be allowed to take part in ceremonies or even in social ritual such as marriage. A man will not be allowed to marry or have any special relationship with a woman who didn't go to an initiation, because she is not considered as a woman.\nInitiation may be thought of as an event which may help teens prepare themselves to be good husbands and wives. Because of modernization initiation is not taken so seriously as before, but there are still certain areas which still perform initiations.\nIn some African tribes, boys have initiation rites for 3\u20134 months and girls for 1\u20132 months.\nAustralian Aboriginal tribes usually had long periods of time to help prepare adolescent boys, teaching them the Law before they were ready to attend large elaborate ceremonies at the time of initiation when they were finally recognized as men in their society. Most tribes had circumcision and scarification as part of the male initiation rituals, while many Central Australian tribes also practiced subincision."}

It is 80\u00a0km long, north to south, on the western bank of the Volga River and has a population of over 1.011 millon people. The city was made famous for its heroic resistance and bloody siege during the Battle of Stalingrad taking place during World War II.\nHistory.\nVolgograd developed from 1589 when the fortress of Tsaritsyn was founded at the confluence of the Tsaritsa and Volga Rivers. \nDuring the Russian Civil War the city was the scene of heavy fighting. Bolshevik forces occupied it during 1918, but were attacked by White forces. It was renamed as Stalingrad in 1925.\nUnder Stalin, the city became heavily industrialized as a centre of heavy industry and trans-shipment by rail and river. During World War II, Stalingrad became the center of the Battle of Stalingrad as well as a turning point in the war against Germany. Essentially, the German offensive was checked at Stalingrad. The Battle of Stalingrad lasted from August 21, 1942 to February 2, 1943, where 1.7 million to 2 million Axis and Soviet soldiers were killed, wounded or captured, in addition to over 40,000 civilians killed.

Certain religions say there is a god who is all-loving, all-knowing and all-powerful. In these religions, the question to answer is how an all-loving and all-powerful god could allow evil to exist. \nResponses include the argument that if there is free will, evil must necessarily exist; that humans cannot understand God; that evil is simply being without god; or that there is evil because the world is corrupted and fallen (from grace). \nLogical problem of evil.\nA version of the problem of evil, perhaps by Epicurus, goes as follows: \nAnother argument goes: \nArguments such as these are about the \"logical\" problem of evil. They attempt to show that the assumed propositions lead to a logical contradiction and cannot therefore all be correct. \nA common response is that God can exist with and allow evil in order to achieve a greater good. Some philosophers accept that arguments such as \"God allows evil in order to achieve the greater good of free will\" are logically possible and thus solve the logical problem of evil. Since the aim is only to defeat the assertion that God and evil are \"logically incompatible\", even a highly implausible instance of God's coexistence with evil is sufficient for the purpose.\nPhilosophies of science have approached the problem from the angle of empiricism. For logical positivism the issue with God is the lack of any independent method of verification. In their view, this makes the proposition \"God exists\", not true or false, but meaningless. A similar position points to the lack of any way the proposition might be falsified."}

There are many religions which are based on revelations. The problem with these revelations is that they contradict each other. A person must either accept or reject at least one of these revelations in order to be part of a religious group. That way, accepting one means rejecting some (if not all) of the others. Unless the revelation is personal, the follower must to some extent rely on the judgment or the stories of others. Assuming the revelation is personal, the follower is still ignoring the revelations of those before him.\nChristians believe that Jesus is the savior of the world and the son of God; Jews believe just as strongly that he is not. Similarly, Muslims believe that the Qur'an was divinely authored, while Jews and Christians do not. There are many examples of such contrasting views. Positions where one religion contradicts another, or where one group of people contradicts another are common. There are many denominations in Christianity who do not agree about many things."}

As a consequence, neither ever does. It is often seen in a paradox like the \"chicken or the egg.\"\nIn computer science, deadlock refers to a specific condition when two or more processes are each waiting for each other to release a resource. It can also be that more than two processes are waiting for a number of resources. Deadlock is a common problem in multiprocessing where many processes share a specific type of mutually exclusive resource known as a \"software lock\" or \"soft lock\". Computers intended for the \"time-sharing\" or \"real-time\" markets often have a \"hardware lock\" (or \"hard lock\") which guarantees \"exclusive access\" to processes. This forces the prforcing serialized access. Deadlocks are particularly troubling because there is no \"general\" solution to avoid (soft) deadlocks.\nA similar situation is when two people are drawing diagrams, but they have only one pencil and one ruler. If one person takes the pencil and the other takes the ruler, a deadlock occurs when the person with the pencil needs the ruler and the person with the ruler needs the pencil to finish his work with the ruler. Both requests can't be satisfied, so a deadlock occurs.\nThe telecommunications description of deadlock is a little stronger: deadlock occurs when none of the processes meet the condition to move to another state (as described in the process's finite state machine) \"and\" all the communication channels are empty. The second condition is often left out on other systems but is important in the telecommunication context."}

He is usually called Lord Berners. He was an amateur composer who is remembered for his strange, eccentric behaviour.\nLife.\nBerners was born in Apley Hall, Bridgnorth, England. The Berners family were related to King Edward III of England. His father was a naval officer who was not often at home. He was looked after by his mother and grandmother who was very religious and very strict. Berners was very interested in lots of things, especially music, but his mother did nothing to help him.\nAt first he went to boarding school in Cheam. Then he went to Eton. He taught himself to compose. He became a diplomat and travelled to Rome and Constantinople. In 1919, when his uncle died, he became 14th Baron Berners and 5th Baronet. He had already composed some music which had been published under the name Gerald Tyrwhitt.\nBerners lived an eccentric life. He lived in Berkshire but also had houses in London and Rome. He had plenty of money, so that he did not have to work. He had many friends, including the composers Stravinsky, Lambert and William Walton who dedicated his \"Belshazzar\u2019s Feast\" to him.\nHis music.\nBerners\u2019s music is full of Romantic feeling, irony and parody. He wrote a lot for the theatre. He composed \"The Triumph of Neptune\" in 1926 for Diaghilev\u2019s Ballets Russes. His music could often be described as light music. \nHis eccentricities.\nBerners started his strange behaviour when he was quite small. He had heard that a dog could be taught to swim by throwing it into water, so he decided to teach his dog to fly by throwing it out of the window. The dog was not hurt, but Berners was given a beating.\nHe was often naughty, making silly traps for people. He was sent to boarding school in Cheam when he was nine. There he had a gay relationship with an older boy. He was then sent to Eton College. Berners said that he learned nothing there.\nLater, when he was grown up, he painted pigeons at his house and once he even had a giraffe as a pet so that he could have tea with it. He travelled in a Rolls-Royce and kept a clavichord under the front seat. \nHe died in 1950 at Faringdon House, leaving his estate to his partner Robert ('Mad Boy') Heber Percy, who lived with him at Faringdon.\nHis epitaph on his gravestone reads: "}

The most widely used human racial types are those based on visual traits (such as skin color, cranial, facial features, or type of hair). Modern biology says that there is only one human race. But the word \"race\" also has a meaning in sociology. Many people react in one way if they see a white person and in another way if they see a black person. That's why in the United States and other countries official forms sometimes ask people to describe their ethnic origin. This is a way of saying \"what racial group do you think you are?\".\nHistory.\nIn the 19th century and in the early 20th century, many scientists divided human beings into three races. White people were called \"Caucasoid race\", black people were called \"Negroid race\", and the people of East Asia and Southeast Asia were called \"Mongoloid race\".\nThere was much prejudice based upon this way of looking at the world. The Europeans and Asians both regarded themselves as superior to the other skin colors. Racism, a non-scientific theory or ideology, was that a particular race was superior or inferior. It argued that in the races that make up the human race, there are deep, biologically determined differences. It also states races should live separately and not intermarry. A supporter of racism is called a racist. These attitudes in turn supported the horrors of African slavery, Apartheid, Segregation and the Jim Crow laws, Nazism and Japanese imperialism.\nSocial darwinism and race.\nSocial darwinism refers to various ideologies based on a concept that competition is active among all individuals, or even whole nations as social evolution in human societies.\nIt is a social adaptation of the theory of natural selection as proposed by Charles Darwin. \"Natural selection\" explains success in various animal populations as the outcome of competition between individual organisms for limited resources. This idea is popularly known as \"survival of the fittest\", a term first used by Herbert Spencer, not Darwin.\nFascist movements have commonly held social Darwinist views of nations, races, and societies In Nazi Germany, the Nazis used social Darwinism to promote their racialist idea of the German nation was part of the Aryan race and believed in the competition of races. The Nazis tried to strengthen the \u2018Aryan race\u2019 in Germany by murdering those they regarded as inferior. By this they meant Jews, Slavs, Roma, homosexuals and disabled people."}

It is an expression used to identify something that does very simple tasks in a very complex way. The expression was named after American inventor and cartoonist Rube Goldberg (1883\u20131970). Rube Goldberg machines are usually a set of simple mechanisms that are indirectly unrelated, which carry out a simple function, these are called chain reactions and initiate a series of events to produce a certain outcome. Although the Rube Goldberg machine creates a simple outcome, it is most likely impossible to replicate in real-life as it is often extremely complex and quirky."}

It is named after Pliny the Younger who wrote the only surviving eyewitness account of the eruption. That eruption of Vesuvius killed Pliny the Elder, the uncle of Pliny the Younger.\nPlinian eruptions have columns of gas and volcanic ash high into the stratosphere. There is a large amount of pumice into the atmosphere and very powerful gas blast eruptions.\nShort eruptions can end in less than a day. Longer ones can take several days to months. These eruptions begin with clouds of volcanic ash and occasionally pyroclastic flows. Sometimes the amount of magma erupted is so large that the top of the volcano collapses. This leaves a caldera behind. Fine ash can deposit over large areas. Plinian eruptions often happen with loud noises, such as those created by Krakatoa.\nLarge Plinian eruptions.\nSome examples of large Plinian eruptions that formed calderas include the following:\nThe lava is usually rhyolitic and has a lot of silicates. Basaltic lavas are unusual for Plinian eruptions; the most recent example is the 1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera.\nPliny's description.\nPliny wrote about what his uncle's did after first seeing the eruption:\nPliny the Elder went to rescue some of the victims. He sailed across the Gulf of Naples to Stabiae (near the modern town of Castellammare di Stabia). Pliny the Younger wrote an account of his death, and suggested that he collapsed and died through inhaling poisonous gases emitted by the volcano. His body was found buried under the ashes of the Vesuvius with no apparent injuries on 26 August, after the plume had dispersed. This confirmed the death through asphyxiation or poisoning."}

They are best known for their very strange monster costumes and using vulgar language in their songs. Their obscene stage performances, which involve violence, slaughter, profanity and obscene comments about politics, are meant to scare, frighten, shock and amuse people. They have won a Grammy Award.\nHistory.\nGwar first formed in 1984 in Richmond, Virginia. The band was made up of Joey Slutman (Joey Byalwec) vocals, Oderus Humongous (Dave Brockie) lead guitar, Balsac The Jaws of Death (Steve Douglas) bass guitar and backing vocals, and Hans Spincter (Sean Summer) drums.\nHowever the group has had many changes. Joey Byalwec left the band in 1986 eventually making Oderus Humongous no longer the group's guitar player but GWAR's permanent vocalist and Balsac the Jaws of Death no longer the band's bass guitarist But the band's Backup vocalist.\nRecordings.\n\"Hell O!\".\nAfter many long years of practicing, GWAR released their first album, \"Hell O!\" in 1988 on Shimmy Disc Records. With a few new members and characters. The group for \"Hell O!\" were Oderus Humongous (Dave Brockie) lead vocals, Flattus Maximus (Dewey Dowell) lead guitar, Nippelus Erectus (Rob Mosky) drums, Beefcake the Mighty (Michael Bishop) bass guitar, and Balsac the Jaws of Death (Steve Douglas) on backing vocals.\nA year later in 1989, Gwar released their first live CD \"RAW-GWAR\" showing the band with their very 1st fans and their morbid, violent graphic and political and taboo related stage performances.\n\"Scumdogs of the Universe\".\nIn 1990 Gwar released their second album, \"Scumdogs of The Universe\". They left Shimmy Disc Records and recorded for Metal Blade Records. Gwar's music changed from hardcore punk, in \"Scumdogs of the Universe\" they have more of a crossover thrash/punk rock sound. The band's first album, \"Hell O!\", did not have any famous songs, but Scumdogs includes Gwar's first two famous songs, \"Sick of You\" and \"King Queen\"\nThe day after the release of Scumdogs, the band released their second live CD, \"Live From Antarctica\". In 1991 the band released their first music video, a video of \"Sick of You\".\n\"America Must Be Destroyed\".\nGWAR released their third and most controversial album \"America Must Be Destroyed\" in 1992. Certain songs on the album were described as \"raunchy\" and \"disturbing\". This album was the first without Steve Douglas as the character Balsac the Jaws of Death. He was replaced by Mike Derks, who is still the current Balsac character. \nTheir fourth album, \"This Toilet Earth\", was recorded in 1994. It is considered to be the most strangest album it contains elements of Crust,Punk,Grindcore,Horror Punk, Traditional Punk Rock,Heavy Metal, Thrash Metal and Hard rock heavily influenced by the early 1980's Thrash metal groups Metallica,Slayer and Anthrax.\nGWAR's 5th studio album Ragnarok was released in 1995 it contains an experimental combination of Crossover Thrash and Funk rock.\nGwar's 6th album Carnival of Chaos was released in 1997.

He was the grandson of Louis XV and younger brother of kings Louis XVI and Louis XVIII. Charles was known as Charles Philippe, comte d'Artois, until he became king. During the French Revolution he was one of the leaders of the \u00e9migr\u00e9s. Charles X was the last senior Bourbon to rule France.\nEarly Life.\nCharles-Philippe was born in 1757, the youngest son of the Dauphin Louis Ferdinand, and his wife, the Dauphine Marie Jos\u00e8phe, at the Palace of Versailles. Charles was named comte d'Artois at birth by his grandfather, the reigning King Louis XV. As the youngest male in the family Charles seemed unlikely ever to become king.\nCharles' father died in 1765, which left Charles' oldest surviving brother, Louis-Auguste (the later Louis XVI), to succeed their father in the capacity of Dauphin, the French equivalent to a crown prince or heir apparent. Charles' mother, Marie Jos\u00e8phe, never recovered from the loss of her husband and she died in March 1767 from tuberculosis. This left Charles an orphan at the age of nine.\nThroughout the 1770s, Charles spent lavishly. He accumulated enormous debts (they totalled 21 million livres), which Louis XVI paid for him in the early 1780s. Their brother the comte de Provence also accumulated debts of a similar magnitude, which Louis XVI also paid off.\nHis political awakening started with the first great crisis of the monarchy in 1786, after which he headed the reactionary faction at the court of Louis XVI. The comte d'Artois supported the removal of the aristocracy's financial privileges, but was opposed to any reduction in the social privileges enjoyed by both the Church and the nobility.\nDuring and After the French Revolution.\nWhen the French Revolutionary Wars broke out in 1792, Charles escaped to Great Britain. George III of Great Britain and Ireland welcomed the comte d'Artois warmly, and gave him a generous allowance. He lived in Edinburgh and London with his mistress Louise de Polastron. After the accession (1814) of Louis XVIII to the French throne, Charles returned to France, where he headed the ultraroyalist party of reaction.\nKing of France.\nCharles' first act as King of France was to grant the style of Royal Highness to his cousins of the cadet branch of the House of Bourbon, the Orl\u00e9ans. Because the Duke of Orleans had voted the death of his brother Louis XVI, Louis XVIII had greatly disliked the Orl\u00e9ans family. However, Charles intended it to create a unified House of Bourbon.His favoritism during his reign toward the Roman Catholic Church and the aristocracy aroused great opposition, leading to the July Revolution of 1830.\nJuly Revolution.\nCharles X was a strong believer in absolutism and rejected the Charter of the French Liberties, issued by his predecessor and brother Louis XVIII. In July 1830, he suspended the legislature, limited the right to vote, and restricted the press. Liberals and radicals responded forcefully to the absolute king. In Paris, angry citizens threw up barricades across the narrow streets. Others fired at soldiers and threw stones and roof tiles. The revolutionary tricolor flew from the towers of Notre Dame cathedral. Charles was forced to abdicate. He again went into exile in Britain. He was succeeded by his cousin, Louis-Philippe, son of the Duke of Orleans who had supported the French Revolution.\nDeath.\nCharles caught cholera when he arrived in Gorizia, Italy. He died on November 6 1836. The townspeople draped their windows in black to mourn him. Charles was buried in the Church of the Annunciation of Our Lady, in the Franciscan Kostanjevica Monastery (now in Nova Gorica, Slovenia).\nMarriage and issue.\nCharles X married Princess Maria Teresa of Savoy, the daughter of Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia and Maria Antonia of Spain on 16 November 1773. The couple had four children:"}

His is better known by his alternate persona Mr. E or Eels. He began calling himself Mr E. as a teenager because it sounded \"mysterious.\" Also, many of his friends made fun of him because his initials spelled out \"MOE\". Evert is best known for his rock band, Eels.\nUnlike most rock bands, Eels rarely plays with the same combinations of members twice. Mark Everett is the only constant member. He is the only one who plays on every single album and live show. All other members are friends of his who add other instruments to the albums and concerts. Most of them are in other bands, such as Aysa and Chloe from the pop band Smoosh. Many do not use their real names, as Everett does. For example, bassist Koool G Murder performed on the albums \"Souljacker\" and \"Hombre Lobo\", and has played bass at most shows on the tours for both albums.\nEach Eels concert is different. Most feature the members who perform the song on the album playing the instruments that they did on that song. Many are acoustic sets. Everett sings and plays piano all by himself. A lot of songs that Eels perform live are covers (songs written by other people), and songs that have never appeared on any albums.\nEverett's life.\nMark Everett's father was Hugh Everett III, a scientist who was the first person to propose the idea that our universe is just one of several connected \"alternate\" universes. At the time (1954), no one believed Everett, and he considered himself a failure. He died when Mark was 19.\nMark's first album was called Bad Dude in Love (1985). It was self-released, meaning that Everett recorded and designed the packaging for the entire album all on his own, selling only five hundred copies to a few friends. That album was the first and last to be released under his full name, Mark Oliver Everett. His next album, A Man Called E (1992) was released only as E, and sold many more copies than Bad Dude in Love. Because many critics did not know who E was, they were confused by the album's title, but the album still sold well.\nEverett's next album as E was Broken Toy Shop (1993). The cover art, which depicts Everett sitting in the center of a toy city, has been said to be his least favorite album cover out of all his releases. This would be Everett's last album using his real name or his pseudonym E, as Eels' first album, Beautiful Freak, featuring bassist Tommy Walter and drummer Butch, was released in 1996.\nIn 1998, Everett became the only living member of his family after his mother died of lung cancer. His sister had died of suicide in 1996. He wrote 16 songs about his sadness that later became his next Eels album, Electro-Shock Blues, featuring Butch from the last album. Butch and Everett would also be the only members to appear on 2000's Daisies of the Galaxy.\nIn 2001, Everett participated in a philosophical vacation on which he was not alllowed to write or speak for religious reasons. Finding himself inspired, he broke the rules and wrote 12 songs that would later become Souljacker, with Koool G Murder, Butch, Joe Gore, John Parish, and Adam Siegel. During this time, he had stopped shaving, and his beard had begun to grow very long, as shown in this picture. Today, Everett\u2019s beard is even longer, and the most recent Eels album (Hombre Lobo \u2013 Spanish for werewolf, featuring Koool G Murder and Knuckles) features songs that Everett wrote about how the beard made him look and feel more \u201cdangerous.\u201d\nFollowing Souljacker, Eels released Shootenanny!, an album that drew a lot of negative attention to the band (at the time consisting of E, Butch, Joe Gore, and Koool G Murder) for Everett\u2019s inappropriate behavior at press events to support the album. In an interview with an Australian television show about rock music, Everett joked about the interviewer waking him up after having sex with a prostitute and doing heroin the night before. Also, Everett was asked to write a review of the diaries of Kurt Cobain (who had died eight years before); his review was a single sentence: \u201cPlease don\u2019t do this to me after I die.\u201d Eels\u2019 subsequent release, Blinking Lights and Other Revelations, a double-disc concept album about a journey through life but not in a chronological order, was much more well received.\nIn addition to these studio albums, Eels has also released one Best Of collection, six live albums, two collections of unreleased material, a book by Everett about his father (and a subsequent documentary film that aired on BBC), and has written songs for eleven movies, including all three Shrek films."}

The metal detector worked but it was confused between the bullet and a coiled bed-spring which he had been lying on.

It is also known as the \"Day of Atonement\". It lasts 25 hours. During this period, Jews ask God to forgive them for all their sins. People fast on this day, and they go to synagogue. Other things people are not allowed to do during Yom Kippur include washing, using perfumes and lotions. Many wear white as a symbol of purity. Even though people fast, Yom Kippur is considered a happy holiday. This is because Jews are sure that God will forgive them on this day.\nYom Kippur is the tenth day of the month of Tishrei in the Hebrew calendar. In Jewish tradition, God writes the fate of each person for the coming year into a \"book\" on Rosh Hashanah. God waits until Yom Kippur to \"seal\" the book. During the days between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, Jews try to improve their behavior. They ask God to forgive them for sins against God. They also ask \"each other\" to forgive them for anything they did to hurt each other. The evening and day of Yom Kippur are used for public and private confessions of guilt (\"Vidui\"). At the end of Yom Kippur, Jews consider themselves absolved by God.\nThe Yom Kippur prayer service includes several special parts. One of them is the number of prayer services. A regular day has three prayer services (\"Ma'ariv,\" the evening prayer; \"Shacharit,\" the morning prayer; and \"Mincha,\" the afternoon prayer). A Shabbat or major Jewish holiday has four prayer services (these three plus \"Musaf,\" the additional prayer). Yom Kippur has a fifth prayer service: \"Ne'ilah,\" the closing prayer. All five prayer services include a public confession of sins (\"Vidui\"). The additional (\"Musaf\") prayer includes a prayer dedicated to the special Yom Kippur \"avodah\" (service) of the High Priest in the Temple in Jerusalem.\nYom Kippur is one of the holiest of Jewish holidays. It is observed by many Jews who do not observe other holidays. More people come to synagogue on Yom Kippur than on any other day of the year."}

After the star uses its fuel, it is a very tight ball of gasses. Then, it gets colder and colder, until it stops making light and heat, when it becomes a black dwarf. Scientists are not sure how long this takes. Some think it takes 1,000,000 billion years, but others think it could be longer. Scientists do not believe that black dwarf stars can exist right now because the universe is only 13.8 billion years old."}

{"id": "201293", "revid": "1011873", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=201293", "title": "Monarch butterfly", "text": "The monarch butterfly (\"Danaus plexippus\") is an insect in the Nymphalidae family. It is the best-known butterfly in North America.\nMonarchs are known for their long annual migrations. In North America, they travel long distances south in the fall, and north in the spring. They start to migrate south in about August. They must get to frost-free areas. Freezing will kill them. A migration towards the north starts in the spring.\nNo single individual makes the whole round trip. The monarch is famous for its southward migration and northward return in summer. The migration north spans the life of three to four generations of the butterfly. A longer-lived \"super generation\" flies from the northern-most parts of the butterfly's range in Canada all the way to Mexico. It overwinters in the south, and breeds in the spring to start the next generation flying north. The following reference gives a map of the migration routes.\nDescription.\nCaterpillar.\nThe monarch caterpillar is banded with yellow, black, and white stripes. The head is also striped with yellow and black. There are four black body extensions, two on each end of the body. They look similar to antennae. The caterpillar will be as long as 5\u00a0cm (2\u00a0inches).\nAdults.\nThe monarch butterfly has a wingspan that ranges from 8.9 to 10.2 centimeters (3\u00bd to 4\u00a0inches).\nThe upper side of the wings are orange with black edges and veins. There are white spots in the black wing margins. The male has a spot on his bottom wing. The spot gives out scents which attract females. The viceroy butterfly (\"Limenitis archippus\") is similar. It has an extra black band across the bottom wing. The underside of the wings is a tan-orange color with black veins. The wing margins are black with white spots in them.\nA white form of the monarch has been seen in Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia and the United States. It has been seen as early as 1896. It was named \"nivosus\" by lepidopterists (a lepidopterist is a person who studies butterflies and moths). It is grayish white in all areas of the wings that are normally orange. The white form makes up about 1% or less of all monarchs except for on Oahu, Hawaii where it has kept populations as high as 10%. The existence of two or more forms of a species in the same area is quite common, and is called polymorphism.\nRange and distribution.\nIn North America, the monarch is found from southern Canada to northern South America. It sometimes wanders to western Europe, sometimes as far as Greece. It reaches Europe from being transported by USA ships. It can also wander to Europe by flying there if weather and wind conditions are right. It has also been found in Bermuda, Hawaii, the Solomons, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Australia, New Guinea, Ceylon, India, the Azores, and the Canary Islands.\nMigration.\nMonarch butterflies are known for their long annual migration. In North America, they make large migrations towards the south starting in August until the first frost. A migration towards the north takes place in the spring. No single individual makes the whole round trip. Female monarchs lay eggs for the next generation during these migrations.\nBy the end of October, the monarchs that are east of the Rocky Mountains migrate to Mexico. Many thousands from the Great Lakes region pass through Point Pelee National Park. They migrate to the sanctuaries of the Mariposa Monarca Biosphere Reserve in the Mexican states of Michoac\u00e1n and Mexico. Most of the monarchs that are west of the Rocky Mountains do not travel all the way down to Mexico. Instead, they overwinter (spend the winter) in many places in central and southern California.\nWhile in Mexico, the monarchs gather in very large numbers to rest. They perch on suitable trees and bushes by clinging (hold on to tightly) with their feet. They cling to each other making layers and layers of resting Monarchs overwintering. This was discovered by Fred Urquhart of the University of Toronto, who studied monarch butterflies for nearly forty years. He knew the Monarchs migrated because he would stop seeing them after a certain time of the year. He put a label on each Monarch he found. On this label was his name, address, and a request to send him the butterfly if it was found.\nA few months later, people from all over North America and Mexico began returning his labelled butterflies to him. Mexico was the southernmost area from which he had received a butterfly, so he started traveling there to look for the Monarchs. For many years, he traveled to Mexico. There he climbed through jungles, walked through forests, and talked to the people he found. He finally heard there was a place west of Mexico City where people had seen lots of monarchs all together. After a long search, He finally found millions of monarch butterflies covering every part of the area.\nDuring the spring migration, the population that is east of the Rocky Mountains may reach as far north as Texas and Oklahoma. The second, third and fourth generations return to their northern places in the United States and Canada in the spring.\nHabitat.\nThe Monarch can be found in many different kinds of habitats. When it is breeding, it is found in habitats with milkweed (a kind of plant). Some of these habitats include, fields, meadows, prairies, parks in or near cities, gardens, and roadsides. The monarch can be found in almost any kind of habitat during migration. It overwinters in pine, cypress, and eucalyptus groves in California. It overwinters in fir forests and pine groves in Mexico.\nMuch of the monarch's breeding habitat is not good anymore. In some states and provinces, milkweed is thought to be a weed. In these places, the milkweed is killed to keep livestock from eating it and becoming sick. Moreover, herbicides use, especially with genetically modified herbicide-resistant plants, eliminate milkweed. With fewer milkweed plants, the monarch does not have as much habitat to breed in.\nHabitat destruction has been a concern as the number of monarch butterflies that completed an annual migration to their winter home in a Mexican forest sank in 2013 to its lowest level in at least two decades, due mostly to extreme weather and changed farming practices in North America. The Mexican forest occupied by the butterflies, once as high at , dwindled to in the annual census conducted December 2012.\nLife cycle.\nThe monarch butterfly goes through complete metamorphosis.\nEgg.\nThe female lays her eggs one by one. They are laid on the underside of the leaves of caterpillar's food plant. The eggs are light yellow. Freshly laid eggs are creamy-white. After three to four days, they turn dark gray. The egg usually weighs about 0.54 milligrams. It is about 1.2 millimeters long. Its diameter is about 0.87\u00a0millimeters (average on 55 eggs).\nCaterpillar.\nThe caterpillar hatches out of the egg. The young caterpillar is a gray-black color with a black head. After the first molt (shedding its skin) the caterpillar is banded with yellow, black, and white stripes. The head is also striped with yellow and black. There are four black body extensions, two on each end of the body. They look similar to antennae. The caterpillar will reach a length of 5 centimeters (2\u00a0inches). The caterpillar eats the leaves and flowers of the food plant. It make no nests or shelters. It grows very quickly, and because of this, it molts four to five times.\nChrysalis.\nAfter the caterpillar molts one last time, it makes a chrysalis. A chrysalis is not the same as a cocoon. The monarch caterpillar attaches its back end (posterior) to a support, and hangs downward in the shape of the letter 'J'. The inside of the caterpillar's body begins to change and it splits its skin to form the blue-green chrysalis. The blue-green chrysalis has a band of black and bright gold near the top. There are other gold spots lower down. After spending many weeks in the chrysalis, the adult finally comes out as a butterfly.\nSpecies similar in appearance.\nThe viceroy (\"Limenitis archippus\") is similar to but is smaller than the monarch. It has an extra black band across the bottom wing that the monarch does not have.\nThe queen (\"Danaus gilippus\") is dark reddish-brown instead of orange. It does not have black veins. There are white spots on the top wing submarginal (near the edge of the wing) area. These spots are on both the upper side and the underside.\nThe soldier (\"Danaus eresimus\") is also dark reddish-brown instead of orange. It has thin, black veins. The underside of the bottom wing has a dark center. It has light brown, square-shaped spots around the dark center.\nMimicry.\nMonarchs are bad-tasting and poisonous because they contain a chemical known as cardenolide (cardiac glycoside). The chemical slows the heart-beat of vertebrates. Monarch caterpillars get this chemical when they feed on milkweed.\nWhen the monarch becomes a butterfly, it no longer eats milkweed, but it still has the chemical in its body. The butterfly shows that they are not good to eat with their bright orange and black wings. This is warning coloration. A bird may try to eat a monarch, but it will become sick and vomit after eating it. After this experience, the bird learns not to eat another monarch, and also any other butterfly which is similar in appearance. The viceroy is similar looking to the monarch, but does not have the milkweed poison in its body. Birds that have had the bad experience of eating a monarch will usually not eat a viceroy. It is an example of M\u00fcllerian mimicry.\nThreats.\nPredators.\nOverwintering Monarchs in Mexico are often eaten by black-headed grosbeaks. These birds are immune to the glycoside. Other birds, such as orioles and jays, have learned to eat only the thoracic muscles and the body parts inside the abdomen. These parts have less poison than the rest of the body. Some mice are also immune to large amounts of the poison. Over time, overwintering monarchs become less poisonous. This makes them more likely to be eaten by predators. In Mexico, about 14% of the overwintering Monarchs are eaten by birds and mice.\nOn Oahu, Hawaii, there is a white form of the Monarch. This is because two species of birds have been introduced. The two birds are known as the red-vented bulbul and the red-whiskered bulbul. They were introduced in 1965 and 1966. They are now the most common insectivorous birds. They are probably the only birds that eat insects as big as the monarch. Monarchs in Hawaii have low cardiac glycoside levels, but the birds may be immune to the chemical. The two bird species eat the caterpillars and sometimes the chrysalids. They look for them on branches and the underside of leaves in milkweed bushes. The birds also eat resting adults and egg-laying females. They eat flying monarchs less often. The white form has a higher chance of living than the orange one. The white form does not fit the birds' search image of a normal monarch, and so it is not eaten. This kind of defense is known as apostatic selection. The white form is also camouflaged in patches of light shining through groups of leaves.\nParasites.\nParasites include the tachinid flies \"Sturmia convergens\" and \"Lesperia archippivora\". Caterpillars that have the \"Lesperia archippivora\" maggots inside them will finish their last molt. They will then hang upside down on a horizontal surface. They die before they turn into a chrysalis. At that time one white maggot comes out of the caterpillar. The maggot then forms a brown pupa on the ground.\nThe bacteria \"Micrococcus flacidifex danai\" also infects the caterpillar and causes \u201cblack death\u201d. Just before turning into a chrysalis, the caterpillar will find a horizontal surface. They die a few hours later. The body turns black shortly after. The bacteria \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa\" causes infections in weakened insects. It is a common cause of death in insects that are raised in laboratories.\nRelationship with humans.\nThe monarch is the state insect of Alabama, Idaho, Illinois, Minnesota, and Texas. It is the state butterfly of\nVermont and West Virginia.\nIt was nominated in 1990 as the national insect of the United States of America.

When the caterpillars mature into butterflies, they are then set free into the wild.\nSome organizations, such as the Cape May Bird Observatory, have monarch labeling programs. Labels are placed on the wing of the butterfly. The labels have information on them. This helps scientists track the monarchs during their migration. It also helps the scientists study the paths that the monarchs take on their migration.\nAdult food sources.\nAdult Monarchs have been seen on a number of different nectar plants.

It is the belief that \"the natural world is the whole of reality\". The term was first used this way in English in 1750.\nIt is a kind of philosophy called metaphysical, because it covers everything: \"nature is all there is, and all basic truths are truths of nature\". \nAll the things and powers which are commonly called supernatural, such as God, souls or witchcraft do not exist, according to this position. \nMethod and science.\nMethodological or scientific naturalism is concerned with practical methods for acquiring knowledge. \nMany scientists use the scientific method for their research. Hypotheses are be explained and tested only by reference to natural causes and events.\nExplanations for observations are only useful when they are based on hypotheses of natural causes. An explanation that relies on a natural mechanism that works according to certain rules is usable. Explanations that need miracles to work are not.\nMethodological naturalism is the principle underlying all of modern science. Some philosophers extend this idea, so that it applies to all of philosophy as well. Science and philosophy, according to this view, are said to form a continuum. W.V. Quine, George Santayana, and other philosophers have advocated this view.\nA number of other philosophical ideas are similar to naturalism:"}

It was written for the 1913 Paris season of Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes company. \nThe music was written by Igor Stravinsky. The dances, which Stravinsky hated, were choreographed by Vaslav Nijinsky. The style of the dance was not in traditional ballet form, but as what Nijinsky imagined to be a primitive ritual. Stravinsky complained that Nijinsky had no understanding of the rudiments of music. The set and costumes were designed by Nicholas Roerich. \nThe ballet was first performed by Diaghilev's Ballets Russes at the Theatre du Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris on 29 May 1913. The dress rehearsal met with approval from critics and invited guests, but the premiere was greeted with tumult and riot, only stilled by the performance of Marie Piltz as the sacrificial maiden. Subsequent performances were received with growing appreciation, but the ballet's great difficulties forced it to be presented only six times.\nThe ballet was revived in 1920 by the Ballets Russes, but the music had been performed in its entirety in concert before the revival. Nijinsky's dances had been forgotten so Leonide Massine (who had not seen the original performances) designed the dances anew. These met with Stravinsky's approval. In 1940, Walt Disney used the music to accompany a segment of the animated movie \"Fantasia\". This segment depicted lumbering dinosaurs and smoldering volcanoes.\nStravinsky's music.\nThe music lasts about 40 minutes, and is divided into two parts. It has the subtitle \"Pictures from Pagan Russia\". Stravinsky had the idea of composing music which was about country people from old times in Russia who danced a fertility rite. This means: a ceremony which is supposed to bring good luck to the next year\u2019s harvest. In this ancient Russian dance, one young girl is chosen to dance and dance until she dies. She is the sacrifice. She is sacrificed to the god of spring.\nHow Stravinsky wrote the score.\nThe painter Nicholas Roerich talked with Stravinsky about the idea for this ballet in 1910. Stravinsky started writing down musical ideas while he was still working on his ballet \"The Firebird\". Then he worked on \"Petrushka\". In 1912 he was able to concentrate on \"The Rite of Spring\". All these ballets were composed for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. \nFirst performance.\n\"The Rite of Spring\" was first performed by the Ballets Russes on 29 May 1913 at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in Paris. The conductor was Pierre Monteux. The audience were shocked at the primitive kind of dancing and the irregular rhythms and strange orchestral sounds and unusual chords. Nijinsky\u2019s choreography was so different from classical ballet. Nijinsky found it difficult to work with Stravinsky and difficult to work with the music.\nCarl Van Vechten described the scene as follows:\n\"A certain part of the audience was thrilled by what it considered to be a blasphemous attempt to destroy music as an art, and, swept away with wrath, began very soon after the rise of the curtain, to make cat-calls and to offer audible suggestions as to how the performance should proceed. The orchestra played unheard, except occasionally when a slight lull occurred. The young man seated behind me in the box stood up during the course of the ballet to enable himself to see more clearly. The intense excitement under which he was labouring betrayed itself presently when he began to beat rhythmically on top of my head with his fists. My emotion was so great that I did not feel the blows for some time\".\nMarie Rambert heard someone in the gallery call out: \"Un docteur \u2026 un dentiste \u2026 deux docteurs\u2026\". The second performance (June 4) was fortunately less eventful and, according to Maurice Ravel, the entire work could actually be heard.\nThe complicated music and violent dance steps caused some to boo. They started to shout and whistle. They argued, and other people who liked it argued back. Then some people started to fight. In the end the police were called. Stravinksy was very upset and ran out of the theatre. The performance was a scandal, but this actually made people curious and soon the ballet became very famous. It was performed six times that season, and there were no more interruptions during the other performances.\nThemes.\n\"The Rite of Spring\" is divided into two parts, and each part has several sections:\nMusical characteristics.\nStravinsky's music has many complex harmonies with dissonant sounds. There are passages with polyrhythms (several rhythms at once) as well as polytonality (music in several keys at once). The time signatures keep changing, and he often uses ostinati (repeated patterns).\nStravinsky wanted his music to describe the releasing of lots of energy. Most composers would have done this by using a lot of percussion instruments. However, although two players are needed for the timpani, there are not many other percussion instruments. Instead, the whole orchestra becomes a kind of percussion instrument. Also, the music often sounds like Russian folkmusic.\nInstrumentation.\n\"The Rite of Spring\" uses a very large orchestra with some unusual instruments. There are almost 100 people playing the piece. Here is a list of the instruments used:\nThe dance.\nNijinsky's choreography was thought almost as shocking as the music. The idea is: a tribe sacrifices a young virgin each year in the Spring to please their gods, and make sure crops grow well. The dancers adopt a pigeon-toed stance (position); their moves are heavy. They move together in groups; their movements are like a ritual. They look like a primitive tribe performing a ritual. The ritual moves towards the sacrifice of the girl. \"The Rite of Spring\" is a link between classical ballet and modern dance.p395\nReconstruction of the ballet.\nNijinsky's choreography has not been kept very well, but there have been efforts in recent years to reconstruct his performance, using costumes and set designs that look like the original ones from 1912. The Royal Ballet in London has a compact disc which discusses Bronislava Nijinska's directions for the dance in a modern (post WWII) production of the ballet.\nFantasia.\n\"The Rite of Spring\" became even more popular when Walt Disney used some of the music in his animated movie \"Fantasia\" in 1940. It is used in the film to describe early life on planet earth with dinosaurs roaming about."}

In 1886 Ernst Haekel suggested that the embryonic development of an organism (its ontogeny) followed the same path as the evolutionary history of its species (its phylogeny). It is also called the biogenetic law or embryological parallelism\nIt was a theory (idea) that tied evolution (the change in organisms over time) with embryology (the way organisms develop before they are born). The theory stated that before they are born, organisms pass through developmental stages that look like adult animals of other species, in roughly the same order that these other species split off during evolution.\nAlthough there is something to this idea, it is no longer thought to be such a useful way to look at development.\nHaeckel's theory.\nHaeckel formulated his theory as \"Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny\". Ontogeny is the steps an organism takes in its development before it is born, starting as a single cell and ending as a baby. Phylogeny is the steps a species takes in its development, starting as a very simple organism and evolving into the current organism. \"Recapitulates\" is a synonym for \"reflects\" and implies that the ontogeny of an organism is similar to the phylogeny of its species.\nFor example, Haeckel realized that before they are born, there is a time when humans have slits in their necks. These slits look like the gills on adult fishes. Haeckel took this to mean that some time before our species became human, we were fish-like. This view is supported by the fossil record and other evidence. As the unborn human gets closer to being born, it develops a tail. In fact, some human babies are even born with tails. Haeckel concluded, again correctly, that at some time in humanities more recent evolutionary past (after we had gone through our fish stage) the species that would go on to become humans had a tail.\nHowever, not all of Haeckel's evidence or conclusions were this good. Haeckel produced several embryo drawings that often overemphasized similarities between embryos of related species. These found their ways into many biology textbooks, and into popular knowledge, even though they were wrong. Furthermore, Haeckel used this \"evidence\" to conclude that white people were evolutionary superior to people of other races. Not only is this a racist view, but we know today that it is not true.\nRejection.\nToday, scientists think that Haeckel overstated the case. For example, the \"gills\" of a developing human do not work (though Haekel never said they did). Furthermore, as better observations were made, it was discovered that developing babies don't look exactly like the pictures Haeckel drew. He may have exaggerated what he saw in order to support his point better. Also, Haekel's discussion was entirely about morphology: he did not discuss the evolution and development of animal behaviour.\nHowever, this is not to say that nothing about the theory makes sense. It is true that our ontogeny gives clues about our phylogeny. However, the relationship is not nearly as direct as Haeckel said it was. In fact, Haekel's over-emphatic claims led in due course to over-emphatic rejections.\nModern observations.\nToday, scientists agree that some parts of Haeckel's theory still make sense. For example:"}

It is on top of a subduction zone. Tambora was taller before its explosive volcanic eruption in 1815. This killed tens of thousands of people around the world. Later eruptions have been smaller.\nHistory.\nWhen the volcano erupted in 1815, it climaxed on 10 April. It was the most destructive volcanic eruption in modern history. It has been estimated that it was four times larger than the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa, between Java and Sumatra, in terms of volume of magma ejected. Before the explosion, Tambora was 4,300 m (14,100\u00a0ft) high, now it is only 2,722 m (8,930\u00a0ft) high. Its massive crater is therefore a caldera.\nThe eruption destroyed a small Asian culture, known to archaeologists as the Tamboran kingdom. Most deaths from the eruption were from starvation and disease, as the fallout ruined farming in the local region. The death toll was at least 71,000 people, of whom 11,000\u201312,000 were killed directly by the eruption. The often-cited figure of 92,000 people killed is believed to be overestimated.\nIt launched 160 cubic kilometers of ash into the upper atmosphere. This caused famine around the world. Tambora's 1815 outburst was the largest volcanic eruption in recorded history. The explosion was heard on Sumatra island more than away. Heavy volcanic ash falls were observed as far away as Borneo, Sulawesi, Java and Maluku islands.\nClimate change.\nThe eruption caused a global climate change known as the \"volcanic winter\". 1816 became known as the \"Year without a summer\" because of the effect on North American and European weather. Crops failed and livestock died in much of the Northern Hemisphere, resulting in the worst famine of the 19th century."}

He was usually called Mullah Omar. Between 1996 and 2001, he was Afghanistan's de facto head of state. Three states officially recognised him under the title of 'Head of the Supreme Council'. He was born in 1959 in Kandahar Province of Afghanistan. He held the title Commander of the Faithful from the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.\nThe United States put him on their most wanted list. They believe he sheltered Osama bin Laden, and some of his al-Quaeda group, directly before and after they committed the September 11 attacks. He was believed to be directing the Taliban in their war against Hamid Karzai's Government and foreign NATO troops in Afghanistan from Pakistan. Many people considered him to be a major terrorist.\nDespite his political rank, and his high status on the FBI's wanted list, not much was publicly known about Omar. There are very few photos of him. A picture that was used by the media in 2002, shows another Taliban official, but not Omar. It is also debated how authoritative the images that exist really are.\nOmar's right eye was missing as the result of a war wound. People described him as being tall. He was described as shy and untalkative with foreigners.\nWhen he was Emir of Afghanistan, Omar stayed in Kandahar most of the time and rarely met outsiders. He sent his Foreign Minister, Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil, to represent him, on most occasions.\nNews media claimed that he was killed by a drone strike in 2008.\nIn 2012, it was revealed that an individual claiming to be Omar sent a letter to President Barack Obama in 2011, expressing slight interest in peace talks.\nDeath.\nOn 29 July 2015, the Afghan government and state intelligence sources said that Omar had died in April 2013 two years previously in Karachi, Pakistan, of tuberculosis. Some Taliban sources denied that he had died; other sources considered the report to be speculative, designed to destabilise peace negotiations in Pakistan between the Afghan government and the Taliban. A Taliban spokesman said that they would issue a statement. Abdul Hassib Seddiqi, the spokesman for Afghanistan's National Directorate of Security, claimed: \"We confirm officially that he is dead\".\nIt was later learned that he died in Afghanistan, not Pakistan."}

It is native to North America and South America. The Variegated Fritillary is closely related to butterflies in the genus \"Speyeria\". It has some differences from \"Speyeria\" butterflies. Some of the differences are: Variegated Fritillaries have 2-3 broods per year vs. one per year in \"Speyeria\". They travel more vs. staying in the same place. And they use a wide range of host plants vs. just violets. Variegated Fritillaries use passionflowers as a host plant. Because of this, Variegated Fritillaries have taxonomic links to the heliconians. Their flight is low and fast, and they are hard to approach. Its genus name was taken from the Greek word \"euptoietos\" meaning \"easily scared\".\nDescription.\nThe upper side of the wings is orange and black. The fore wing and hind wing have a row of submarginal black spots and black median lines running across the wings. (Submarginal means just inward of the wing edge. Median means through the center of the wing.) The underside of the fore wing is orange. The hind wing is mottled with browns and grays. There is a pale postmedian band (postmedian means just outward of the median). There is no silvering. The wingspan is 1.75-2.25\u00a0inches.\nSimilar species.\nThere is a butterfly similar to the Variegated Fritillary. It is the Mexican Fritillary (\"Euptoieta hegesia\"). The Mexican Fritillary is brighter orange. The upper side of its hind wing has more orange. The underside of its wings is plainer, with no submarginal spots or median black lines.\nFlight period.\nThis species may be seen flying from April-October in the south. It flies in the north from summer to early fall.\nHabitat.\nThis butterfly is found in different kinds of habitats. It can by found in clover fields, alfalfa fields, fields, pastures, waste areas, roadsides, and mountain meadows.\nNectar plants.\nThe Variegated Fritillary has been seen on different kinds of flowers. Here is a list of them:\nLife cycle.\nFemales lay their eggs singly on the host plant's leaves and stems. The eggs are pale green or cream colored. The caterpillar eats the leaves, flowers, and stems of the food plant. The caterpillar is red with black stripes. There are white spots in the black stripes. In many individuals, the white is more noticeable than the black. It has six rows of black spines. It has a pair of long, clubbed spines on the head. The chrysalis is shiny white with small black spots. It has a variable amount of brown markings and has orange and gold projections. Adults overwinter in the south and fly north each spring and summer. It has 2-3 broods per year.\nHost plants.\nHere is a list of host plants that the Variegated Fritillary caterpillar eats:"}

{"id": "201501", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=201501", "title": "Carom billiards", "text": "Carom billiards, sometimes called carambole billiards or simply carambole (and sometimes used as another word for a game called \"straight rail\") are a family of billiards games played on cloth-covered tables. In these games, the players strike heavy balls with sticks called cues. Carom billiards tables have no pockets or opening where balls are sunk, that snooker and pool tables do have. In its simplest form, the object of carom billiards games is to score points or \"counts\" by bouncing one's own ball, called a cue ball, off of the other two balls on the table. The date the first carom game was invented is not exactly known. Also, how exactly the games developed and which game was first is not clear. However, carom billiards games are believed to have started sometime in the 18th-century (the 1700s) in France in Europe.\nThere are many different games, each with distinct rules, strategies and objects of play, that are all part of carom billiards. Some of the most well known games are \"straight rail\", \"cushion caroms\", \"balkline\", \"three-cushion billiards\" and \"artistic billiards\". There are many other carom billiards games that combine aspects of these games, but that are not as well known. For example, the \"champion's game\" was a short-lived game that developed during a transitional period between the invention of straight rail and the invention of balkline. Other games are combinations of these games and other games played on tables \"with pockets\" (pool or snooker games), such as \"English billiards\" played on a snooker table and its related games, \"American four-ball billiards\", and \"cowboy pool\", played on a pool table.\nHow the name came about.\nThe word \"carom\" means any strike and bounce off something. It started being used to describe the pocketless billiard games in the 1860s. It is a shortening of the word \"carambola\", used in Spanish and Portuguese and spelled \"carambole\" in French. Carambola was earlier used to describe just the red ball used in billiards games, but later was given to the game itself. Some people who study word origins suggest that \"carambola\" was originally the name of a yellow-to-orange colored, tropical Asian fruit, known in Portuguese as a \"carambola\". This was taken from an earlier word, \"karambal\", from the Marathi language of India, also known as starfruit. The accuracy of the fruit origin has been questioned. It has been said to be just a legend, because the fruit does not look very similar to the big red ball that is used in carom games, and there is no direct proof for the fruit explanation.\nEquipment.\nCloth.\nCloth has been used to cover billiards tables since the 15th century (1400s). In fact, the company that became the most famous maker of billiard cloth, Iwan Simonis, was formed in 1453. Most cloth made for carom billiards tables is a type of cloth called \"baize\" that is dyed green in color, and is made from 100% wool that has fibers that are made to be very straight (a process called worsting). Baize cloth provides a very fast surface allowing the balls to travel easily across the table material, called a \"bed\". The green color of cloth was originally chosen to look similar to grass. Green has been the common cloth color since the 16th century (1500s). However, the color also serves a useful function. Human eyes more easily see green than any other color. This allows players to keep playing for longer periods of time without straining their eyes.\nBalls.\nModern billiard balls are made from \"phenolic resin\", which is a type of very strong plastic. The size of carom billiards balls is normally 61.5\u00a0mm (27\u204416\u00a0in) in diameter. They weigh between 205 and 220\u00a0grams (7.23 \u2013 7.75\u00a0ounces; 7.5 is average), and are quite a bit larger and heavier than the balls used for pool games. While UMB, the International Olympic Committee-recognized world carom billiards authority, permits balls as small as 61.0\u00a0mm (approximately 23\u20448), no major manufacturer produces such balls any longer, and the main standard is 61.5\u00a0mm. The three standard balls in most carom billiards games are a completely white cue ball, a second cue ball sometimes having a red or black dot on it (to help people in telling the balls apart), and a third, red ball. In some sets of balls, however, the second cue ball is solid yellow. Both types of ball sets are allowed in tournament play.\nBilliard balls have been made from many different materials since the start of the game. For example, they have been made from clay, wood, ivory, plastics (including celluloid, Bakelite, crystalate, and phenolic resin) and even steel. The most common substance from 1627 until the early- to mid-twentieth century was ivory. The search for a substitute for ivory use was not for environmental reasons but based on how expensive they were and fear of danger for elephant hunters. The search was made more enticing when a New York billiard table maker offered a $10,000 prize for a substitute material. The first usable substitute was made from a material called \"celluloid\". Celluloid, which is an early form of plastic, was invented by a man named John Wesley Hyatt in 1868. There was a problem with the material though. Celluloid was unstable and highly flammable, sometimes exploding when people were making it.\nBilliard cues.\nThe stick used to hit billiard balls, called a billiards cue, is different in some ways from the typical pool cue. Compared with pool cues, billiard cues are often shorter, with a shorter end cap (called a ferrule), a fatter bottom portion where the back hand grips the stick (called a butt), a wooden screw in the middle rather than one of metal or plastic, and a smaller tip diameter. These features make the billiard cue stiffer. This stiffness helps players in striking the larger and heavier billiard balls as compared with pool balls. The stiffness also acts to reduce an effect called \"deflection\" (sometimes called \"squirt\"). Deflection is an undesirable effect from the use of sidespin. Sidespin is spin placed on a ball by striking it not at its center but off to one side of its center, causing it to spin as it travels down the table. Deflection causes a ball to travel not in a straight line in the direction it was struck.\nHeated slate.\nUnderneath the cloth of billiard tables is a very hard rock called slate. The slate bed of a billiard table is often heated to about 5\u00a0\u00b0C/9\u00a0\u00b0F above room temperature, which helps to keep moisture out of the cloth to aid the balls rolling and rebounding in a consistent manner, and generally makes a table play faster. A heated table is required under international carom rules and is an important requirement for the games of three-cushion billiards and artistic billiards. Heating table beds is an old practice. Queen Victoria of England (1819\u20131901) had a billiard table that was heated using zinc tubes, At that time, though, the reason for the heating was different. The heat was used to keep ivory balls from going out of shape (warping). The first use of electric heating was for a tournament in the game of \"18.2 balkline\", that was held in December 1927 between two players: Welker Cochran and Jacob Schaefer, Jr. \"The New York Times\" announced it with fanfare: \"For the first time in the history of world's championship balkline billiards a heated table will be used\u00a0...\"\nHistory of games.\nStraight rail.\nStraight rail, sometimes called carom billiards, straight billiards, the three-ball game, the carambole game, and the free game in Europe, is thought to date to the 1700s. No exact time of origin is known though. It was called French caroms, French billiards or the French game in early times, taking those old names from the French who made the game popular. The object of straight rail is simple: one point, called a \"count\", is scored each time a player's cue ball makes contact with both object balls (the second cue ball and the third ball) on a single strike of the cue ball. Winning is achieved by reaching a certain number of points, agreed to between the players to be the winning number.\nWhen straight rail was first invented there was no restriction on the way points were scored. However, the technique of \"crotching\", meaning to have two balls right next to each other on the area of one of the table's four corners where the rails meet\u2014the \"crotch\"\u2014made scoring a lot easier. This resulted in an 1862 rule which allowed only three counts before at least one ball had to be sent away from the corner in order to legally score another point. Techniques continued to develop which increased counts greatly despite the crotching ban. One of these techniques is called \"nursing\", and made scoring much easier. A \"nurse\" is a series of shots where the balls are kept very close together, allowing a player to score off of them with very soft strokes without changing their positions much, so the scoring can continue. The most important of these nurse techniques, called the \"rail nurse\", involves nudging the balls down a rail, moving them just a few centimeters on each score and keeping them close together and positioned at the end of each stroke in the same or near the same arrangement so that the rail nurse can be repeated.\nProfessional straight rail in the United States was only seen for six years, from 1873 to 1879. It was followed by a game designed to reduce the use of the rail nurse so that spectators would not be bored by watching it. Today, straight rail play is not very common in the U.S. but it still popular in Europe, where it is thought to be a good practice game for balkline and three-cushion billiards. Europe hosts professional competitions, known as \"pentathlons\" after the ancient Greek Olympic competitions, in which straight rail is one of five billiards games at which players compete. The other four are called 47.1 balkline, cushion caroms, 71.2 balkline and three-cushion billiards.\nThe champion's game.\nA new game appeared in 1879, called the champion's game or limited-rail. The champion's game is considered an in-between game\u2014between straight rail and balkline\u2014and was designed to stop the rail nurse. The game uses diagonal lines\u2014balklines\u2014drawn at the table's corners to indicate that if balls were inside those lines, points could not be scored, thus \"cutting off four triangular spaces in the four corners, [taking] away 28\u00a0inches [711\u00a0mm] of the 'nursing' surface of the end rails and 56 inches [1422\u00a0mm] on the long rails.\" Despite its differences from straight rail, the champion's game only expanded the areas of the table where many points in a row could be scored before the balls had to be moved to a new position. This was not sufficient to stop nursing.\nBalkline.\nBalkline came after the champion's game. It added more rules to stop nursing techniques. There are many varieties of balkline, but all divide the table into marked regions called \"balk spaces\". The balk spaces define areas of the surface of the table where a player may only score up to a certain number of points while the object balls are within that region.\nIn the balkline games, rather than drawing balklines a few inches from the corners as was done in the champion's games, the entire table is divided into rectangular spaces. This is done by drawing balklines a certain distance across the length and the width of the table. The lines are drawn a number of inches parallel from each rail. This divides the table into eight rectangular areas called \"balk spaces\". Additionally, rectangles are drawn where each balkline meets a rail, called \"anchor spaces\". The anchor spaces were added to the game to stop nursing techniques that developed especially for the challenges of balkline without them.\nGenerally, the differences between one balkline game and another are defined by two different things: 1) where the balkines are drawn on the table, and 2) the number of points that are allowed in each balk space before at least one ball must leave that region of the table. Balkline games are named by giving two numbers that tell us about the spacing used and how many points can be scored in the balk spaces. The first number tells us how many inches from the rail the balkine will be drawn. The second number after a \"dot\", indicates the number of points that can be scored in the balk spaces before the balls must leave it (that number is always either one or two). So, for example, the name \"18.2 balkline\", tells us that balklines are drawn distant from each rail, and only two points are allowed in a balk space before a ball must leave that area.\nOver its history balkline has had many variations including 8.2, 10.2, 12.2, 13.2, 12\u00bd.2, 14.1, 14.2, 18.1, 18.2, 28.2, 38.2, 39.2, 42.2, 45.1, 45.2, 47.1, 47.2, 57.2 and 71.2 balkline. In its different forms, balkline was the main carom game played from 1883 to the 1930s. After that, other carom games became more popular. This is especially true of three-cushion billiards. Balkline is not very common in the U.S., but remains popular in Europe and the Far East.\nCushion caroms.\nCushion caroms, sometimes called by its original name, the indirect game, is thought to have developed in the 1820s in Britain, it developed out of an older game called the \"doublet game\", that dates to at least 1807. The game is sometimes incorrectly called \"one-cushion\" or \"one-cushion billiards\", which is the direct translation of its name into English from various other languages such as Spanish (\"\"una banda\") and German (\"einband\"\").\nThe object of cushion caroms is to score \"cushion caroms\", meaning a bounce off of both of the other balls on the table, with at least one rail of the table being struck by the cue ball before the contact with second object ball. Cushion caroms was not played for a number of years, but came back in the late 1860s. Its return was for similar reasons as to why balkline developed. It was frustration of many people with straight rail. The techniques such as nursing that were invented to make scoring much easier, also made the game very boring to watch. Thus, as straight rail lost popularity, cushion caroms was revived for a time. Cushion caroms is rarely played in the U.S., but it still has some popularity in Europe.\nThree-cushion billiards.\nIn three-cushion billiards, sometimes called three-cushion carom, three-cushion, three-cushions, three-rail, rails and the angle game, the object is to carom off both object balls with at least three rails being contacted before the contact of the cue ball with the second object ball. Arising sometime in the 1870s, the origin of three-cushion billiards is not entirely known. It is undisputed that the Internal Revenue Collector of the Port of St. Louis, Wayman C. McCreery, made the game popular. At least one publication states he invented the game as well.\nThe first three-cushion billiards tournament took place January 14\u201331, 1878 in C. E. Mussey's Room in St. Louis, with McCreery taking part. The tournament was won by New Yorker Leon Magnus. The high run for the tournament was just 6 points, and the high average a .75. The game was infrequently played prior to 1907, with many top carom players of the era saying they did not enjoy it. However, in 1907 after the introduction of the Lambert Trophy, the game became more popular in the U.S. and internationally.\nBy 1924 three-cushion had become so popular that two very well know players in other billiard areas agreed to play each other in it at a challenge match. On September 22, 1924 Willie Hoppe (last name rhymes with \"poppy\"), the world balkline champion and Ralph Greenleaf, the world pocket billiards (pool) title holder, played a well-advertised, multiple-day, 600-point match. Hoppe was the eventual winner with a final score of 600\u2013527. The game's decline in the U.S. came about in 1952 when Hoppe, then 51-time billiards champion, announced his retirement.\nThree-cushion billiards is a very difficult game. Averaging one point per turn at the table is professional-level play, and averaging 1.5 to 2 is world-class play. An average of one means that for every turn at the table, a player makes one point and misses once. This means that the player makes a point on only 50% of his or her shots. The highest run at three-cushion billiards for many years was 25, set by the American Willie Hoppe in 1918 during an exhibition. As of 2007, the high run record is 31 points, shared between Semih Sayg\u0131ner of Turkey and Hugo Pati\u00f1o who is originally from Colombia but resides in the U.S. The best game at the standard 50 points in a tournament is 9 innings by the Swedish player, Torbj\u00f6rn Blomdahl in 2000, and 4 innings (count: 19-11-9-11) by Korean and U.S. national champion, Sang Lee in September 1992 in a game at SL Billiards in Queens, New York. The highest tournament average is 2.536 by Dick Jaspers from the Netherlands in 2002 at a tournament in Monaco. Raymond Ceulemans from Belgium has won an unmatchable 21 three-cushion billiards world-championships.\nThree-cushion billiards is the most popular carom billiards game played in the U.S. today, where pocket billiards (pool) is far more widespread. Three-cushion retains great popularity in parts of Europe, Asia, and Latin America.\nThe principal governing body of the sport is the Union Mondiale de Billiard (UMB). That organization has been holding world three-cushion championships since the late 1920s. Decades later, the Billiards World Cup Association (BWA) competed with UMB, but faded in the late 1990s due to financial problems. The International Olympic Committee-recognized World Pool-Billiard Association (WPA) cooperates with the UMB to keep their rulesets consistent.\nArtistic billiards.\nIn Artistic billiards, sometimes called fantasy billiards or fantaisie classique, players compete at performing 76 planned shots, each assigned a degree of difficulty. Each set shot has a maximum point value assigned for perfect execution, ranging from a 4-point maximum for lowest level difficulty shots, and climbing to an 11-point maximum for shots deemed highest in difficulty level. There is a total of 500 points available to a player. The governing body of the sport is the Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Billiard Artistique (CIBA).\nEach shot in an artistic billiards match is played from a well-defined starting position. In fact, in some tournaments the balls must be placed within two millimeters of a diagrammed position. Each shot must also be done in an established manner in order for points to be awarded. Players are allowed three attempts at each shot. In general, the 76 shots in the game\u2014even the lowest difficulty 4-point shots\u2014require a high degree of skill, much practice and specialized knowledge to perform.\nWorld title competition first started in 1986 and required the use of ivory balls. However, this requirement was dropped in 1990. The highest score ever achieved in world competition was 374, by the Frenchman Jean Reverchon in 1992. The highest score in competition overall is 427 set by Belgian Walter Bax on March 12, 2006 at a competition held in Deurne, Belgium, beating his own previous record of 425. The game is played mostly in western Europe, especially in France, Belgium and the Netherlands."}

It is similar to at least 113 other chemicals in cannabis, known as cannabinoids, but not all of them will make you feel different or high after using it. There are about 540 chemicals in cannabis total. THC is a very fatty chemical and doesn't interact with water very well. THC is thought to be used by the plant for protection from bugs, light, and other harm from its environment. The THC chemical structure was discovered in 1964 by Dr. Raphael Mechoulam and Dr. Y. Gaoni at the Weizmann Institute in Israel.\nUse in medicine.\nTHC is used in medicine as a treatment for many physical and psychological problems. It can be used to help people with pain or are sick from getting chemotherapy for cancer. There are some medications which have THC and can be ordered by a doctor depending on where and what country you live in.\nPharmacological Effects.\nCannabis works by sticking to special receptors in the brain and body, which is known as the endocannabinoid system or ECS. Over time, a person will need more THC to feel the same effects as before. This is known as tolerance. A person may also experience withdrawal, which can be uncomfortable and is a result of stopping THC use quickly after using it for some time. People usually do not get addicted to using THC. \nTHC in the body.\nTHC is very fatty (fat soluble) and binds to fat cells in our body and causes it to leave the body slowly, even if the effects of the drug or high has already ended. . The minimum time for a person to pass a drug test would be about 1 week. It is not possible for humans or animals to realistically die from taking too much THC or marijuana and no person has ever died from it. \nLegality.\nMany places in the world do not see THC or cannabis as legal and can have very harsh penalties from having, producing, or using it. Some countries allow it for use only in medical treatment while others allow it for recreational use by adults, usually older than 18 or 21 years old. Children may be permitted to use it if they're very sick. \nIn North America, Canada and Mexico have taken action to allow marijuana use in some way. In the United States, the federal government sees marijuana as illegal and very addictive and cannot be used as a medicine. Individual states with in the U.S.A. allows people to use marijuana to help with sickness or recreationally. \nDrug Testing.\nEmployers or people who work in a government agency, like the police or FBI, may test someone to see if they used any drugs recently. This is called a . Police may do this if they think you have used marijuana before or while you are driving a car. THC lasts a long time in the body and can be found in body fluids, like urine or saliva, or hair and sweat. Since it lasts so long in the body, it can be a problem being sure if someone is high. "}

Narcotics are now called opioids. \nNarcotics are highly addictive. Narcotics, whether they are prescription drugs or heroin, are some of the most addictive drugs that exist.

He was discovered by his manager Scooter Braun from his YouTube videos in 2008.\nEarly life and career.\nJustin Bieber grew up in Ontario. When he was twelve years old, he went into a local singing contest. He came in third place. The video of the contest was uploaded to his YouTube channel run by his mother Pattie Mallette. Bieber was noticed by famous music industry manager Scott Samuel \"Scooter\" Braun.\nBraun saw the 12-year-old boy on YouTube singing a song by Ne-Yo. Braun contacted Bieber's mother, Mallette, who agreed to bring her son, who was 14-year-old at that time, to Atlanta to try working together. Braun convinced them to move from Canada to the United States.\nAfter seeing more success, Braun presented Bieber to two successful artists, Usher and Justin Timberlake. Both showed interest. Eventually Usher's mentor, music executive L. A. Reid, signed Bieber to a deal with Island Def Jam.\nIn 2009, Bieber toured with Iyaz and Taylor Swift, and traveled in the United States. His first album, \"My World\", which was released in that year, features four singles, \"One Time\", \"One Less Lonely Girl\", \"Favorite Girl\", and \"Love Me\". He signed to a record deal with Usher. He released \"My World 2.0\" in March 2010 as his second album, as well as going on a world tour. The album includes his smash hit single \"Baby\" featuring Ludacris, a remix version of \"Somebody to Love\" featuring his mentor Usher, and two promotional singles \"U Smile\", and \"Never Let You Go\". In the same year, he released \"My Worlds Acoustic\", which includes acoustic versions of his songs from the \"My World\" album and it also contains the ballad song \"Pray\". \"Purpose\"'s single \"Sorry\" is his most popular song.\nBieber has released a book called \"\".\nIn late 2011, he made his professional acting debut in the biopic 3D concert film ', the movie is accompanied with the release of his remix album ', which includes remix versions of songs from his previous albums, collaborations with other recording artists and a brand-new track is also included. The remix album includes the single \"Never Say Never\" a duet song with singer and actor Jaden Smith in which it serves as the theme song for the 2010 movie \"The Karate Kid.\" That same year, he released his first Christmas-themed album and his second studio album, \"Under the Mistletoe\", it features the singles \"Mistletoe\", Fa La La\" featuring hip hop vocal group Boyz II Men, \"All I Want For Christmas Is You\" featuring Mariah Carey, and \"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\".\nIn 2012, his third studio album, \"Believe\", was released; it contains the singles \"Boyfriend\", \"Beauty and a Beat\" featuring rapper Nicki Minaj, \"As Long as You Love Me\" featuring Big Sean, the album was supported by his Believe Tour which began in 2012 and ended in 2013. In 2013, he released \"Believe Acoustic\", containing acoustic versions of songs from the album \"Believe\" and three new songs.\nOn December 23, 2013, the album \"Journals\" was released. It has fifteen songs. Ten have been released as singles.\nThe album \"Purpose\" came out in late 2015. It includes the singles \"Sorry\", \"Love Yourself\", and \"Company\". Earlier in the year, he was arrested for being reckless. The album was supported by the Purpose World Tour, which began in 2016, became his highest-grossing world concert tour ever.

The libretto and choreography were composed by Michel Fokine. The story of the ballet is based on a Russian fairy tale. The music was composed by Igor Stravinsky. It was Stravinsky's first ballet score. \"The Firebird\" was first performed by the Ballets Russes in Paris at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre National de l'Op\u00e9ra on 25 June 1910. Anna Pavlova had been asked to create the role of the Firebird. She thought Stravinsky's music incomprehensible and declined. The role went to Tamara Karsavina. The ballet has seen several revivals. It is also known by its French title \"L'Oiseau de Feu\". \nStory.\nPrince Ivan ventures into the garden of the evil Kashchei. He catches the magical Firebird. She promises to aid the Prince whenever he needs help if he will release her. He takes a magic feather from the bird's tail, then releases her. \nTwelve princesses with the Tsarevna (daughter of the Tsar) dance. All are in the power of the evil sourcerer Kashchei. Prince Ivan falls in love with the Tsarevna. He asks Kashchei whether he can marry her. Kashchei is angry and sends his monsters after the Prince. Kashchei is about to turn him to stone, when the Prince waves the feather. The Firebird appears, and comes to the Prince\u2019s rescue. She casts a spell on the monsters. They fall asleep. The Firebird tells the Prince that Kashchei\u2019s soul lies in an egg. The Prince smashes the egg. Kashchei loses his power, the monsters, and his palace. The Prince marries the Tsarevna.\nRevivals.\nThe ballet was revived in Britain in 1954 with costumes and sets by Natalia Gontcharova. Margot Fonteyn starred as the Firebird, Michael Somes as the Prince, Frederick Ashton as Kastchei, and Svetlana Beriosova as the Tsarevna. This production played the Metropolitan Opera House in September 1955 with the same principals. \nGeorge Balanchine staged his version of the work with the New York City Ballet at the City Center in 1949 with designs by Marc Chagall. Maria Tallchief danced the Firebird. Balanchine revised his version in 1970 in conjunction with Jerome Robbins. Robbins handled the group scenes. Chagall revised his designs for the production. \nMaurice B\u00e9jart choreographd an abstract production for the Paris Op\u00e9ra in 1970. He believed the traditional fairy tale production was impossible to present on the modern stage. He cast a \"danseur\" in the title role. The cast wore denim."}

{"id": "201936", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=201936", "title": "Instinct", "text": "Animals with nervous systems are born with instincts. An instinct is a part of the behaviour of an organism. It is inherited (innate), not learned. However, the term does not include the operation of sense organs, and does not include the normal working of the autonomic nervous system. Instincts are to do with visible muscular action in response to releasers. Releasers are triggers which set off chains of instinctive behaviour. Although instincts are not learned, in some cases their performance can be improved by experience and practice.\nThere are some problems with the term 'instinct'. It can be used loosely to mean a general tendency, such as \"a man's instinct is to protect his family\". It can be used to describe chains of behaviour of mixed origin. Properly, it is used only of well-defined acts whose causation is inherited, and which are triggered by specific stimuli called releasers. \nOther terms for instinct are fixed action patterns (FAP) and innate behaviour chains.\nOverview.\nInstinctive behaviours can be variable and responsive to the environment. Any behaviour is instinctive if it is performed without being based upon prior experience, that is, in the absence of learning. Sea turtles, newly hatched on a beach, will automatically move toward the ocean, and automatically swim when they are in the water. A joey climbs into its mother's pouch upon being born. Honeybees communicate by dance the direction of a food source without formal instruction. Other examples include animal fighting, animal courtship behaviour, internal escape functions, and building of nests.\nReflexes as instincts.\nReflex actions are a special case. A true reflex is distinguished from other behaviours by mechanism; they do not go through the brain. Rather, the stimulus travels to the spinal cord and the message is then transmitted back through the body, tracing a path called the reflex arc. Reflexes are similar to fixed action patterns, but a fixed action pattern can be processed in the brain as well. A male stickleback's instinctive aggression towards anything red during his mating season is such an example. Examples of instinctive behaviours in humans include many of the primitive reflexes, such as rooting and suckling, behaviours which are present in most mammals.\nMaturational instincts.\nSome instinctive behaviors depend on maturational processes to appear. For instance, we commonly refer to birds \"learning\" to fly, because they cannot fly at first, but can a week or two later. However, young birds have been experimentally reared in devices that prevent them from moving their wings until they reached the age at which their cohorts were flying. These birds flew immediately and normally when released, showing that their improvement resulted from neuromuscular maturation and not true learning.\nComponents of instincts.\nWhile fixed action patterns and reflexes are clear examples of almost entirely instinctive behaviours, most behaviours are complex and consist of both instinctive and learned components. For instance, in imprinting a bird has a sensitive period during which it learns who its mother is. Konrad Lorenz famously had a goose imprint on his boots. Thereafter the goose would follow whomever wore the boots. The identity of the goose's mother was learned, but the goose's behavior towards the boots was instinctive. Similarly, sleeping in humans is instinctive, but how much and when one sleeps is clearly subject to environmental factors. Whether a behaviour is instinctive or learned is common subject of nature versus nurture debates.\nDisplacement activities.\nIn a situation when two instincts contradict each other, an animal may resort to a displacement activity.\nBiological function.\nInstinct is a built-in need to do something. It's not something an animal thinks about; it's something it does automatically. A baby bird automatically throws its head back, opens its mouth wide, and screams for food. It is an instinct. Baby bats automatically cling to the cave wall. Grasshoppers naturally spit out the things in their stomach on predators that try to eat them. Bees naturally work to take care of the hive and make honey. Butterflies inherit preferences for laying their eggs on certain plants.plant their young need to eat, and that's where they lay their eggs. Animals are born with these instincts, and they follow their instincts without conscious thought.\nOrganisms have two ways they can get behaviours. One way is learn, by observation, and by repeating things which have a pleasant outcome. The other way is to inherit the behaviour pattern by heredity."}

{"id": "201988", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=201988", "title": "Petrushka", "text": "Petrushka is a ballet burlesque in four scenes. Alexandre Benois and Igor Stravinsky wrote the story of the ballet. Igor Stravinsky wrote the music. Michel Fokine choreographed the work (designed the dances). Benois designed the sets and costumes. \"Petrushka\" was first performed by Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in Paris on 13 June 1911. Nijinsky played Petrushka, and Tamara Karsavina played The Ballerina. Alexandre Orlov played The Moor, and Enrico Cecchetti played The Charlatan. \n\"Petrushka\" tells the story of the loves and jealousies of three puppets. The three are brought to life by The Charlatan during St. Petersburg's 1830 Shrovetide Fair. Petrushka is in love with The Ballerina. She rejects him because she likes The Moor. Petrushka is angry and hurt. He challenges The Moor. The Moor kills him with his scimitar. Petrushka's ghost rises above the puppet theatre as night falls. He shakes his fist at The Charlatan, then collapses in a second death. \n\"Petrushka\" brings music, dance, and design together in a unified whole. It is one of the most popular of the Ballets Russes productions. It is usually performed today using the original designs and dances. Grace Robert wrote in 1949, \"Although more than thirty years have elapsed since \"Petrushka\" was first performed, its position as one of the greatest ballets remains unassailed. Its perfect fusion of music, choreography, and d\u00e9cor and its themethe timeless tragedy of the human spiritunite to make its appeal universal.\"\nRussian puppets.\nPetrushka is a puppet. He is a character known across Europe under different names: Punch in England, Polichinelle in France, Pulcinella in Italy, Kasperle in Germany, and Petrushka in Russia. Whatever his name, he is a trickster, a rebel, and a wife beater. He enforces moral justice with a slap stick, speaks in a high-pitched, squeaky voice, and argues with the devil. His plays were formulaic and subversive. They repeated key scenes from one play to another. The plays usually ended with a dog, a policeman, or the devil dragging him away.\nEmpress Anna Ivanovna brought marionettes to Russia in the 18th century. These puppets were an amusement for the aristocracy. Rod puppets were an Asian import. They performed religious plays, mostly at Christmas. Petrushka however was a hand puppet. He was beloved by the common people. He performed in street theatres and other open air venues in small portable booths or behind screens that could be easily assembled and just as easily disassembled. After the Russian Revolution, Soviet authorities forced Petrushka indoors. They wanted to be better able to monitor his subversiveness.\nStory.\nScene One. The scene is St. Petersburg's Shrovetide Fair in 1830. A crowd of peasants, police, gypsies, and others wander about Admiralty Square looking for fun. Two dancers entertain the fairgoers. At the back of the stage is a large puppet booth. Two toy soldiers rush from the booth, beating their drums to attract the crowd's attention. The Charlatan appears before the booth. The curtain of the booth opens. Three puppets are seen, each in a little cell. One puppet is a dark-skinned Moor, another is a pretty Ballerina, and the third is Petrushka. The three leave their cells to perform a pantomime at the center of the stage. The Moor and Petrushka both love The Ballerina, but she likes The Moor. Petrushka is jealous. He starts a fight with The Moor. The Charlatan abruptly stops the pantomime. The curtain falls.\nScene Two. There is no musical introduction except drumrolls announcing the beginning of the scene. The curtain rises and a door opens. Petrushka is seen being kicked through the door. He falls. He pulls himself together to the accompaniment of arpeggiated C major and F\u266f major chords (the \"Petrushka chord\"). \nHe stands uncertainly and shakes his fist at the portrait of The Charlatan on the wall. The music is a violent rendition of the \"Petrushka chord\", now scored for trumpets. Petrushka falls to his knees. The music grows lyrical as he mimes his self-pity, his love for The Ballerina, and his hatred of The Charlatan.\nThe Ballerina enters \"en pointe\". When Petrushka sees her, he begins a display of frantic gestures and athletic leaps. The Ballerina is frightened and hurries away. Petrushka falls to the floor in despair. The clarinets mock him. He curses The Charlatan to the accompaniment of the \"Petrushka chord\" for full orchestra. For a moment, Petrushka peers out of his room at the crowd in Admiralty Square to the \"crowd music\" from Scene One. He collapses as clarinets mock him with the \"Petrushka chord\". A trumpet call signals the end of the scene. \nScene Three. Drumrolls are heard as the curtain rises. Whereas Petrusha's room was dark and chilly, The Moor's room is brilliant with color. The walls are decorated with palm trees, exotic flowers, white rabbits hopping about, and desert sands. \nThe Moor lies lazily on a daybed playing with a coconut. He shakes it. There's something inside! He tries to cut it open with his scimitar, but fails. He believes it a god and bows in worship before it. \nThe door opens. The Charlatan brings The Ballerina into the room. The Ballerina is attracted to The Moor's handsome appearance. She plays a saucy tune on a toy trumpet, represented by a cornet in the original 1911 orchestration. The Moor tries to dance with her but fails. \nThe Moor sits on the daybed. The Ballerina sits on his knees. They cuddle. They hear noises outside the door. Petrushka has broken free from his cell, and rushes into the room to rescue The Ballerina from seduction. Petrushka attacks the Moor, but quickly realizes he is too small and weak. The Moor beats Petrushka. The puppet flees for his life, with the Moor chasing him. The curtain falls.\nScene Four. The scene is again the Shrovetide Fair. Evening is falling. The crowd is having a lot of fun. A dancing bear and organ grinders entertain the crowd. Wet nurses perform a dance. Suddenly, Petrushka runs from the puppet booth. The Moor chases him, and kills him with a blow of his scimitar. The crowd is frightened. The Charlatan enters. He shows the crowd that Petrushka is nothing but a puppet filled with straw. The crowd slowly walks away, still stunned with what they have just seen. The Charlatan is left alone. The spirit of Petrushka appears on the roof of the puppet booth. He shakes his fist at The Charlatan. He is terrified and hurries away. Petrushka collapses over the roof of the puppet booth, his arms swinging to and fro in the night.\nDiaghilev and the Ballets Russes.\nSerge Diaghilev, the impresario who brought together the three men who created \"Petrushka\", was the son of a nobleman. He was educated at home, and moved to St. Petersburg in 1890 to study law. He took music lessons from Rimsky-Korsakov, and developed a strong interest in the arts. \nDiaghilev spent his inheritance traveling to Europe's major art museums. Between 1899 and 1905 he published \"The World of Art\", a magazine that had great influence on the Russian art world. Its success led Diaghilev to set even greater artistic goals for himself.\nHe managed to secure a position at the Imperial Ballet, but was fired after overstepping his authority. He organized concerts of Russian music for the Paris Op\u00e9ra, and promoted Russian operas and short ballets. The Paris public was thrilled with these ballets.\nIn 1910, Diaghilev focused his efforts on ballet, and the Ballets Russes was organized. Stravinsky's \"The Firebird\" was one of the highlights of the 1910 season. In spite of the company's success, Ballets Russes did not have a permanent home. The dancers went back to their jobs at the Imperial Ballet when the Paris season was over.\nWhen Nijinsky was fired from the Imperial Ballet for an incident possibly masterminded by Diaghilev, the impresario hired him. Nijinsky was an artist of the greatest magnitude who could lead the Ballets Russes to unheard of success and international renown.\nOther artists joined the Ballets Russes, but the company still did not have a permanent home. It led a nomadic existence. \"Petrushka\" and \"Le Spectre de la rose\" were the highlights of the 1911 season, \"Daphnis and Chloe\" and \"Afternoon of a Faun\" of the 1912 season, and \"The Rite of Spring\" of the 1913 season. Nijinsky married in 1913, and broke with Diaghilev. \nIn the following years, Diaghilev persuaded disgruntled artists who had left the company to return Fokine and Benois, especially. In 1921, the company found a permanent home in Monte Carlo. It continued to produce the colorful ballets it was famous for. The company's international renown grew, but the excitement of its early Paris days was over.\nConcept and libretto.\n\"Petrushka\" was the creation of four men: composer Igor Stravinsky, scenery and costume designer Alexandre Benois, choreographer Mikhail Fokine, and Ballets Russes impresario Serge Diaghilev. The four men worked closely with each other on the creation of \"Petrushka\". \nStravinsky and Benois each attributed the creation of the libretto to one another in the days following the ballet's successful premiere. The idea about a ballet based on a puppet was Stravinsky's, but the libretto was almost certainly the work of Benois. The subject was close to his heart, and he was, after all, an experienced librettist.\nAlexandre Benois was born 3 May 1870 in St. Petersburg. His father was an architect. Benois did not plan a career in the arts, but graduated in law from the St. Petersburg Imperial University in 1894. In 1897, his watercolors were exhibited and noticed by Diaghilev and Bakst. The three men founded an art magazine that exerted great influence in Russia. In 1901, Benois was appointed scenic director for the Mariinsky Theatre, and in 1905 moved to Paris and began working for the Ballets Russes.\nBenois was unavailable for comment when Stravinsky offered his undeveloped idea about a ballet for a puppet to Diaghilev in 1910. He had separated himself from the Ballets Russes after his libretto for \"Sch\u00e9h\u00e9razade\" had been attributed to L\u00e9on Bakst in the ballet's theatre programmes. Diaghilev and Stravinsky tried to persuade Benois to return, but Benois refused. Time passed and Benois's pique softened. He rejoined his colleagues after learning the new ballet's subject was Petrushka.\nDiaghilev was pleased to have Benois back on board and suggested the ballet be set during the Shrovetide Fair (a Mardi Gras-like celebration before Lent) in St. Petersburg about 1830. This period was one of Benois's favorites. Benois gave Petroushka a full-length body and two companions, The Ballerina and The Moor. Benois was designing costumes and scenery during the libretto's composition to give his colleagues a visual idea of the ballet's final appearance.\nBenois, Stravinsky, and Diaghilev met in Rome in 1911. Rehearsals for \"Petrushka\" were in progress in the basement of the theatre where the Ballets Russes was performing though the music and libretto were yet to be completed. The ballet received a more definitive shape when Fokine began to rehearse the principal dancers, and, as often as possible, the dancers playing the different fairgoers in the crowd.\nMusic by Igor Fyodorovich Stravinsky.\nIgor Stravinsky was born on 17 June 1882 near St. Petersburg. His father, an opera singer with the Mariinsky Theatre, was of a noble Polish family. As a boy, Stravinsky studied piano and music theory. He later studied law, but passed most of his time with music. In 1905, he began music studies with Rimsky-Korsakov. In 1909, Stravinsky's \"Fantastic Scherzo\" and \"Fireworks\" were performed in St. Petersburg. Diaghilev heard both works and was deeply impressed. \nIn 1910, \"The Firebird\" was put into development for the Ballets Russes. Tcherepnin was hired to write the music, but lost interest. The job was given to Lyadov. Diaghilev grew disappointed with Lyadov. He was slow to get started. The impresario recalled his impression with Stravinsky and decided the young composer was the man to write the score for \"The Firebird\". Stravinsky was hired. \nStravinsky was young and inexperienced. He worried whether he could meet the deadline date for the score, but accepted the job. He was flattered to be chosen from the many great musicians of the age to write the score, and just as flattered to be working with men who were geniuses in their fields.\nStravinsky worked closely with Fokine in developing \"The Firebird\". The result was a work in which movement, music, and scenery and costume design were integrated into one artistic whole. The stop-and-go, episodic character of classical ballet was avoided in favor of a fluid continuity from start to finish. \"The Firebird\" premiered in 1910 to great success. \nThis success led Diaghilev to hire Stravinsky to write the score for another ballet, \"The Rite of Spring\". The idea for this ballet was Stravinsky's, and based on a dream he had had about a virgin forced to dance to death to propitiate the god of spring. Stravinsky knew that writing this score would take a long time. He tired of it, and started to work on a concert piece for piano and orchestra to refresh himself. Stravinsky thought of this new piece as a contest between the orchestra and the piano. The orchestra finally overwhelms the piano to emerge the winner. \nStravinsky was thinking of the Russian hand puppet, Petrushka, when he wrote the concert piece: \"In composing the music, I had in my mind a distinct picture of a puppet, suddenly endowed with life, exasperating the patience of the orchestra with diabolical cascades of arpeggios. The orchestra in turn retaliates with menacing trumpet blasts.\"\nThe music is modern. It uses the music of the past (folk tunes and popular songs), but departs from the simplicity of these tunes. The most modern music in the score is the music for Scene Two. This is the music Stravinsky wrote as a concert piece for piano and orchestra. The scene opens with the clash of C major and F-sharp major chords. This bitonality represents Petrushka's dual nature as a living being and straw-filled puppet. \nStravinsky put some popular Russian folk tunes into the score as well as less ethnic music such as a waltz by early 19th-century Viennese composer Josef Lanner. This waltz was inserted into Scene Three for The Ballerina and The Moor. Stravinsky put a popular French tune into Scene One (\"She had a wooden leg\") and was forced to pay royalties into the 1950s to the tune's writer. \nStravinsky revised and arranged the \"Petrushka\" score several times. In 1914, the 42-minute work was cut to a 20-minute suite for concert performance. In 1919, Stravinsky gave his permission to the Aeolian Company of London to create transcriptions for piano rolls. Stravinsky himself wrote a virtuoso piano transcription in 1921 for Artur Rubinstein. Plans for a sound movie of \"Petrushka\" in 1929 were dropped when Benois would not agree to the project. In 1956, Stravinsky conducted a 15-minute adaptation of the score for an animated movie.\nScenery and costumes.\nThe ballet is set during the Shrovetide Fair in St. Petersburg in 1830. Benois had many childhood memories of these fairs. He put these memories the sideshows, the little theatres, the roundabouts and other fair attractions into the first and fourth scenes of \"Petrushka\".\nBenois designed eleven productions of \"Petrushka\"' over the years. His designs were always based on those of the first production of 1911. He always set the ballet in Admiralty Square, although the actual place of the fair was moved to the Winter Palace Square and finally to the Field of Mars. The fair (infamous for the heavy drinking that took place during its run) was eventually shut down by Prince Oldenburg and the Temperance Society. \nAll productions of \"Petrushka\" designed by Benois had several things in common. They all had a proscenium executed in a Russian folk style, and a backdrop showing St. Isaac's Cathedral. The costumes were accurate recreations of the clothing worn in the 1830s. The curtain that was lowered between scenes displayed the Charlatan surrounded by clouds. This curtain was replaced with a night scene of demons and monsters flying over St. Petersburg.\nThe second scene of the ballet shows Petrushka's lonely little room. There is a picture of the Charlatan on one wall. The original picture was damaged when the production was moved from St. Petersburg to Paris. It was replaced with a picture of the Charlatan in profile by another designer. Benois did not like this picture. He refused to speak to Diaghilev for a long time.\nThe third scene in the ballet is the Moor's room. This scene gave Benois much trouble. He tried many jungle animals elephants, lions, crocodiles on the wall covering of the room but was not pleased. He finally settled on a design of palm trees. This exotic design remained the same through all of Benois's later productions. It created a striking contrast to the bareness of Petrushka's room.\nChoreography.\nFokine was born to middle class parents in 1880, and entered the Imperial Ballet school in 1889. He graduated in 1898 and immediately found a position as dancer in the Imperial Ballet. He was curious, intelligent, and ambitious. In 1902 he started to choreograph short ballets for the students of the Imperial Ballet school. \nHe opposed much of the traditions of the Imperial Ballet such as the circular position of a dancer's arms, the \"pirouette\" ending a male dancer's solo, and the lengthy curtain calls. His intent was to make each movement have meaning, to create a fluid work from start to finish unhindered by the traditional stop and go of classical ballet, and to avoid a gymnastic style of dance. He wanted his dancers to interpret musical phrases, accents, and nuances through meaningful movement. He codified his thoughts on dance in five principles.\nHe put his ideas to work over the next several years with encouraging success. He respected the choreographic accomplishments of the past and refused to re-choreograph older works. He preferred to work with new material. In 1907 he choreographed \"Le Pavilion d'Armide\". He worked with Benois for the first time on this ballet. \"Pavillion\" earned the critical favor of the Imperial Ballet. It was eventually staged at the Mariinsky Theatre. \nIt was Benois who introduced Fokine to Diaghilev. He choreographed \"Les Sylphides\" and a few other ballets for Diaghilev's first Paris season, and \"The Firebird\" and \"Scheherazade\" for the 1910 season. In 1911 he choreographed not only \"Petrushka\". \nFokine described Stravinsky's \"Petruska\" score as \"sounds tormenting the ear and yet stimulating the imagination and stirring the soul.\" The dancers complained about the score and found it difficult to keep track of counts. Fokine admitted as much, but managed to make progress with the dancers and on the choreography itself. Fokine redefined ballet with this work. \nIn \"Four Centuries of Ballet\" Lincoln Kirstein writes about \"Petrushka\" and its creators. Fokine gave \"pizzicato points\" to the Ballerina, Kirstein notes, while the Moor's toes are turned out (\"en dehors\"), and Petrushka's toes are turned in (\"en dedans\"). The mechanical, flat movements of the puppets provide contrast to the natural movements of the crowd, and mime accentuates the Ballerina's vanity, the Moor's mindless pride, and Petruchka's helplessness. ballets\nFokine may have been influenced by other ballets about life-size animated dolls such as \"Coppelia\" (1870), \"Arlekinada\" (\"Les Millions d'Arlequin\"), and \"Fairy Doll\" (1903). Some moments and scenes in \"Arlekinada\" presage similar ones in \"Petrushka\". Fokine's most revolutionary gestures in \"Petrushka\" are the demotion of virtuoso star roles to character roles, and the elimination of classical ballet's narrative introduction, \"white\" act, obligatory virtuoso dances for the stars, and divertissement. The solo moments for The Moor and Petrushka are basically mime, and, without her own scene, The Ballerina has no solo. \nFokine used Russian national dance forms in a fragmentary fashion for the various characters in the crowd. Fokine complained that the crowd was insufficiently rehearsed, Nijinsky complained that movement for the crowd was never really choreographed but was left for the dancers to improvise, and Benois complained that Diaghilev would not spend the money necessary to realize certain effects. Kirstein writes, \"The metaphor of manipulated automata remains poeticallty powerful, now haloed in the nostalgia of many period memoirs. Did Benois see Diaghelev as the charlatan Showman? Was Nijinsky typecast as Petrouchka?\"\nVaslav Nijinsky.\nVaslav Nijinsky was born in Kiev, Russia in 1889 or 1890. His parents were Polish dancers. He went to the Imperial Ballet school in 1900. He studied under Cecchetti. He rose through the ranks. He partnered Anna Pavlov, Mathilde Kschessinska, and Tamara Karsavina. He met impresario Serge Diaghilev and the two became lovers. Nijinsky left the Imperial Ballet to join Diaghilev's Ballets Russes.\nNijinsky was famous for losing himself in a character. He transformed his Slavic features, his athletic physique, his virtuoso technique, and his classical discipline into one of the most moving portraits in the ballet repertoire that of a sad puppet with jerking, awkward movements. \nHe had difficulty understanding the character in rehearsal and asked Benois for guidance. On the night of performance however, Nijinsky's superhuman understanding of character transformed him into the puppet. Benois wrote, \"The metamorphosis took place when he put on his costume and covered his face with make-up I was surprised at the courage Vaslav showed, after all his \"jeune premier\" successes, in appearing as a horrible half-doll, half-human grotesque. The great difficulty of Petrushka's part is to express his pitiful oppression and his hopeless efforts to achieve personal dignity without ceasing to be a puppet. Both music and libretto are spasmodically interrupted by outbursts of illusive joy and frenzied despair. The artist is not given a single \"pas\" or \"fioriture\" to enable him to be attractive to the public, and one must remember that Nijinsky was then quite a young man and the temptation to be \"attractive to the public\" must have appealed to him far more strongly than to an older artist.\"\nAmerican dance critic Carl Van Vechten describes Nijinsky's Petrushka: \"He is a puppet and remarkable touch a puppet with a soul. His performance in this ballet is, perhaps, his most wonderful achievement. He suggests only the puppet in action; his facial expression never changes; yet the pathos is greater, more keenly carried over the footlights, than one would imagine possible under any conditions. I have seen Fokine in the same role, and although he gives you all the gestures the result is not the same. It is genius that Nijinsky puts into his interpretation of the part. Who can ever forget Nijinsky as Petrushka when thrown by his master into his queer black box, mad with love for the dancer, who, in turn, prefers the Moor puppet, rushing about waving his pathetically stiff arms in the air, and finally beating his way with his clenched fists through the paper window to curse the stars? It is a more poignant expression of grief than most Romeos can give us.\"\nPerformance history.\n\"Petrushka\" was first performed by the Ballets Russes in Paris at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet on 13 June 1911. Nijinsky portrayed Petrushka, Tamara Karsavina The Ballerina, Alexandre Orlov The Moor, and Enrico Cecchetti The Charlatan. Pierre Monteux conducted.\nFokine revived the ballet in 1925 for the Royal Danish Ballet, and again for Ballet Theatre in October 1942. The Royal Ballet revived the work on 26 March 1957 with Alexander Grant, Margot Fonteyn and Peter Clegg. Rudolph Nureyev danced Petrushka with the Royal Ballet in 1963. \nThe ballet was first performed in the United States by the Ballets Russes at the Century Theatre in New York City on 25 January 1916 with Leonide Massine in the title role. The Joffrey Ballet revived the work in New York City on 13 March 1970, and the American Ballet Theater revived it on 19 June 1970 at the New York State Theater.\nStructure.\nTableau I: The Shrovetide Fair\nTableau II: Petrushka's Room\nTableau III: The Moor's Room\nTableau IV: The Shrovetide Fair (Toward Evening)"}

A blackbody is an object that absorbs all radiation (visible light, infrared light, ultraviolet light, etc.) that falls on it. This also means that it will also radiate at all frequencies that heat energy produces in it. \nEverything glows, depending on its temperature. Hotter things glow more in shorter wavelengths. Cooler things don't glow so much, especially in short wavelengths. Partly the radiation wavelength depends on what the material is, and partly it doesn't. The part that only depends on temperature, and not on composition, is called blackbody radiation. \nQuantum wave.\nThis part of the story of radiation was first explained by James Clerk Maxwell via wave theory but the predicted and actual intensity vs. frequency curves did not go together right. At higher frequencies classical physics predicted that more and more energy would be radiated from the body until the energy became infinite. This broke the first law of thermodynamics which is a fundamental part of all physics. This was called the ultraviolet catastrophe. \nWhen it was realised that classical physics did not work for blackbody radiation, the German physicist Max Planck explained their relationship by saying that there are individual things (he did not try to guess what kind of things) that vibrate, each at its frequency. Each wave of each frequency has its special energy level. A single x-ray is very high photon energy and can go right through the human body. \nA single wave or photon of infrared light is very low energy, cannot go through the human body, and can only warm it. Planck's good thinking was to realize that to get a single wave at the x-ray frequency, it was necessary to have a big enough package of energy (or \"quantum\") to make such a strong wave. So if a blackbody took in a single wave at the x-ray frequency, then it could give off an x-ray at some later time. But if the blackbody only took in infra-red light it would not matter how much of it was absorbed. \nIt could only give off infrared light and could not give off even ordinary red light, much less any higher energy light such as ultraviolet light or x-ray radiation. Planck said that the total energy given off by a blackbody at any particular frequency is equal to the number of the \"vibrating things\" (see above), n, that was vibrating at a given frequency, f times a special constant, h, that turns frequency units into energy units. The equation is:\nThe constant he made, h, is called the Planck constant.\nThe idea that a unit of light at a given frequency always has the same energy, the idea that there is a quantum of energy for each unit of light at a given frequency, became the doorway into quantum mechanics, so the idea of a blackbody is something that is basic to modern physics. It shows up in discussions of a wide variety of physics topics having to do with energies and frequencies."}

It was finished on 19 May 1856. The plans for its building began in 1853, at the start of the Crimean War. The Medical Department of the army was totally unprepared for the very large number of wounded soldiers being brought from the battles at places like the siege of Sevastopol. It saw the first real involvement of Florence Nightingale.\nNightingale was a young and determined nurse, sent to Scutari to care for the soldiers. She began to develop sanitation and hygiene properly. The Boer Wars in southern Africa between 1880 and 1902 had a very high casualty rate for the British. More than 20 thousand dead and many who died from disease when they returned home. Thousands of British soldiers brought back to Netley were nearly far too many for the hospital, but others had been built by then and so they were able to deal with the number of troops. Netley\u2019s role in World War One was very important in saving the lives of many troops. Hundreds of wooden huts were built behind the site of the Hospital, increasing the capacity of Netley to some 5000 men. This was needed especially during the Somme offensive and the battles at Ypres."}

The \"slanted leg\" part comes from the fact that these spiders have their legs touching the ground at an angle instead of straight up and down. The \"recluse\" part is because this spider is very shy and runs away from humans.\nAppearance.\nThe brown recluse spider can be light brown, dark brown, or even gray. Sometimes it is called the violin spider since its head has a darker mark on it that looks like a violin. Not including its legs, it can grow to about long. They have six eyes, which is an unusual number of eyes for a spider.\nMale and female brown recluses can be identified once the spider has molted several times. Spiders have a set of appendages on their faces called pedipalps. The pedipalps on the male have much larger ends than the ones on females. These fattened pedipalps serve as the sex organs for the male. The female has her sex organs on the underside of her body. This is perhaps the only way to easily tell a male from a female. Scientists who study brown recluses and their relatives can even identify relatives of the brown recluse by studying the shapes of the sex organs.\nHabitat.\nBrown recluse spiders only live in the United States. Spiders living in the south west part of the U.S. live in the woods, and spiders in the north east part live inside houses. Brown recluse spiders like dry, dark areas that have good hiding places. Wild brown recluse spiders live in hollowed rotting tree trunks and logs. Brown recluses that live in houses usually like garages, basements, and attics. These are places where people are less likely to bother them, and they have lots of good hiding places, like cardboard boxes.\nSometimes, people mail boxes without checking them first for spiders. Brown recluses can hide inside these boxes and might make their home wherever the package is opened. However, spider experts have found brown recluses sent through the mail rarely start a new colony in their new home, partly because there are no other brown recluses for them to mate with. Sometimes brown recluses sent through the mail set up colonies in warehouses. However, they do not move very far from their colony, which is usually not well-established in the new place.\nFood.\nBrown recluse spiders are insectivores. They eat soft-bodied insects (like moths or flies) and other spiders. They are cannibals and will not hesitate to eat each other. When mating, a female brown recluse will try to eat the male.\nWhen preying, the brown recluse slowly creeps toward its prey. Once it is close enough, it pounces on the prey and sinks its fangs into the prey. Its fangs contain a deadly venom that kills the prey very quickly.\nBrown recluses can go without food or water for a very long time. Some brown recluses can go for five seasons with no food or water.\nBehavior.\nBrown recluse spiders are hunting spiders, so they spend most of the time on the ground. They hide during the daytime and sleep, and at night they come out to hunt. They usually do not climb unless they are running from something. They can walk upside-down, but most brown recluses walking on ceilings have probably come from the upstairs floor. The blood cannot flow through their legs while they walk, so they must stop every few seconds to allow the blood to flow.\nBrown recluses are very good at survival. They can go without food or water for more than a year. They are also very good at surviving in people's homes during cold winters. If they get their leg caught in something, such as a crack or a predator's mouth, they can drop the leg. The spider can still walk around with only four legs, as long as there is still one leg on each side.\nBecause these spiders are so good at surviving in hard times, it is very hard to get rid of them. Bug sprays and pest killers usually are not good for killing them, except for some kinds that are against the law to use. A spider that has been sprayed might even become vicious.\nBrown recluse spiders are afraid of people, and usually if they see one they stand still. If the person chases the brown recluse, it will most often run and hide. Even though brown recluse spiders are scared of people, it is a bad idea to try to touch one, because their bite can be very dangerous.\nBrown recluses will normally only bite a person if the person is touching the spider or if the spider is stuck between the person and something else. Most brown recluse bites happen when someone puts on clothes that have a brown recluse spider living inside of them. For people who have brown recluses living in their house, it is a good idea to shake out any clothes that have been on the floor for a few days before putting them on. These people should also be careful when walking around in attics, basements, or dark parts of the house with no shoes on. Wearing socks or gloves helps, because the spiders have very short fangs. It is very common for people living with brown recluses to never see the spiders and never be bitten, and good habits can help make sure no one is bitten.\nDanger and myth.\nBrown recluse spiders have been feared since they were discovered in 1940, and people will often take drastic approaches to rid their homes of these spiders. Spider experts noticed that the bite of a brown recluse could sometimes lead to a terrible infection called necrosis. Sometimes the necrosis becomes fatal, but these fatal bites are actually very rare, and most bites from brown recluses are no more harmful than a normal spider bite. The spider's bite is most dangerous for people who are young or overweight.\nIt is very common for people bitten by spiders to arrive in a doctor's office without bringing the spider that bit them. When this happens, a doctor must guess what sort of spider could have bitten the person. The brown recluse spider is a very common spider to blame, since its name is so well-known, but it is very seldom that the brown recluse spider was involved. Doctors' guesswork has led many people to believe brown recluses exist outside their native area, such as in California, even though this is not true. It is pretty common for a Brown recluse to bite someone and that person may not feel any symptoms for multiple hours or even days from the time of the bite. In most cases, either a disease was the cause of the symptoms, or a different kind of spider bit the person and the doctor makes a mistake when he or she guesses it was a brown recluse.\nVery little is known about the venom of the brown recluse, and spider venom experts have been looking for a long time for ways to effectively tell whether a brown recluse has bitten a patient as well as an antidote for its venom."}

Kluge Prize for Lifetime Achievement in the Humanities and Social Sciences, given in fields where there are no Nobel Prizes. In announcing the prize, James H.

Meanders form a snake-like pattern as the river flows across a fairly flat valley floor. The position of the curves changes over time. Meanders were named for a river in Anatolia. \nA river rarely flows in a straight line: it bends around because it drops sediment where it flows most slowly. There are areas of slower and faster water movement. The river flows faster on the outside of a curve, and the fast water erodes the outside bends of a river channel by hydraulic action and abrasion. This forms a river cliff. The river flows more slowly on the inside of the river beach. The slower water drops sediment. \nContinuous erosion on the outer bank and deposition on the inner bank will expand the bend in the river. This is called a meander. Over time, meanders become larger and more visible. \nEventually meanders turn into oxbow lakes when two outside bends erode together making a shorter route for the water."}

The yuan was instead of the Chinese \"tael\". The tael was common and was in use in Manchuria. A tael would buy about 40 grams of silver.\nHistory.\nThe Manchukuo yuan would buy 24 grams of silver in 1932. The price of silver changed and the yuan would not buy 24 grams of silver. To show that the yuan had value it was made equal to Japanese money. The Japanese money was called the yen. In 1940 the Manchukuo yuan was being used to measure Manchukuo exports and imports to America, Germany and Japan.\nThe paper money was in five values in 1932. Each piece of paper money is called a note. There was a one hundred yuan note, a ten yuan note, a five yuan note, a one yuan note and a small value note. A new 1000 yuan note was made in 1944.\nThe paper money or notes had pictures of Chinese emperors printed on them. The money was first made in Japan. Later they were made by the Bank in the Manchukuo capital of Hsinking (Hsinking is now called Changchun). \nThe Yuan was subdivided into 10 \"chiao\", 100 \"fen\" or 1000 \"li\". Coins were made that were worth 5 \"li\" and bigger values. The largest value coin was 10 \"fen\".\nIn 1944 and 1945, Manchukuo made coins of red or brown cardboard. These may be unique as to coining material, but they are not particularly scarce.\nOn January 1946 Manchukuo Yuan was replaced. The Chinese allowed people to swap 1 Manchukuo for a new type of money called a \"North-Eastern Yuan\". In 1948 these new yuan could be swapped by a \"Gold Yuan\". One Gold Yuan cost 150,000 \"North Eastern Yuans\"."}

Tropical Depression Eleven was located just to the north of Cuba at the time. On August 23 it became \"Tropical Storm Jerry\".

The National Hurricane Center did not expect to Tropical Depression Eleven to become a tropical storm because most of the showers and thunderstorms were over land.\nOn August 23, Tropical Storm Jerry made landfall in Jupiter, Florida while it was still a weak tropical storm with winds at 40 miles per hour. It stayed as a tropical storm until it went into the Gulf of Mexico. It made a second landfall in Florida of August 25 while a tropical depression.

He was also a mathematician, cosmologist and encyclopedic author. \nHis collected information influenced the next two generations of naturalists, including Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck and Georges Cuvier. \nBuffon published 35 volumes of his \"Histoire naturelle\" during his lifetime, and nine more were published after his death, for a total of 44 volumes. \"Truly, Buffon was the father of all thought in natural history in the second half of the 18th century\". p330\nBuffon held the position of Intendant (Director) of the \"Jardin du Roi\", now called the \"Jardin des Plantes\"; it is the French equivalent of Kew Gardens. The \"Lyc\u00e9e Buffon\" in Paris is named after him.\nHis work.\nNatural history.\nBuffon is best remembered for his \"Histoire naturelle\". \"Written in a brilliant style, this work was read ... by every educated person in Europe\".p330 It was translated into many different languages, making him one of the most widely read authors of the day, a rival to Montesquieu, Rousseau, and Voltaire.\nIn the opening volumes of the \"Histoire naturelle\" Buffon questioned the usefulness of mathematics, criticized Carl Linnaeus's taxonomical approach to natural history, outlined a history of the Earth with little relation to the Biblical account, and proposed a theory of reproduction which ran counter to existing ideas. \nThe early volumes were condemned by the Faculty of Theology at the Sorbonne. Buffon published a retraction, but he continued publishing the offending volumes without any change.\nBuffon noted that despite similar environments, different regions of the world have distinct plants and animals. This observation, later known as Buffon's Law, may be the first principle of biogeography. \nCommon descent.\nBuffon understood the idea of common descent, and discussed it a number of times. This does not mean he believed in it. Probably he did not, but he discussed it fairly openly on a number of occasions. Interpreting his ideas is not simple, for he returned to topics many times in the course of his work.\nIn volume 14 he argued that all the world's quadrupeds had developed from an original set of just thirty-eight quadrupeds. On this basis, he is sometimes considered a \"transformist\" and a precursor of Darwin.\nEarth science.\nIn \"Les \u00e9poques de la nature\" (1778) Buffon discussed the origins of the solar system, speculating that the planets had been created by a comet's collision with the sun. \nHe also suggested that the earth originated much earlier than the 4004 BC of Archbishop James Ussher. Basing his figures on the cooling rate of iron tested at his Laboratory le Petit Fontenet at Montbard, he calculated that the age of the earth was 75,000 years. Once again, his ideas were condemned by the Sorbonne, and again he issued a retraction to avoid further problems.\nRelevance to modern biology.\nCharles Darwin wrote in his preliminary historical sketch added to the third edition of \"On the Origin of Species\": \"Passing over... Buffon, with whose writings I am not familiar.\" Then, from the fourth edition onwards, he amended this to say that \"the first author who in modern times has treated it [evolution] in a scientific spirit was Buffon. But as his opinions fluctuated greatly at different periods, and as he does not enter on the causes or means of the transformation of species, I need not here enter on details.\" \nThe paradox of Buffon is that, according to Ernst Mayr:\nHe was not an evolutionist, yet he was the father of evolutionism. He was the first person to discuss a large number of evolutionary problems, problems that before Buffon had not been raised by anybody... he brought them to the attention of the scientific world.\nExcept for Aristotle and Darwin, no other student of organisms [whole animals and plants] has had as far-reaching an influence.\nHe brought the idea of evolution into the realm of science.\nHe developed a concept of the \"unity of type,\" a precursor of comparative anatomy.\nMore than anyone else, he was responsible for the acceptance of a long-time scale for the history of the earth.\nHe was the founder of biogeography.\nAnd yet, he hindered evolution by his frequent endorsement of the immutability of species. He provided a criterion of species, fertility among members of a species, that was thought impregnable."}

It changed the way it was moving to the northwest on August 27 while it was over Cuba, but all clouds were over the Bahamas and Florida.

Conditions remained good and the tropical depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Anita later on August 29. Water temperatures were warm, this allow Tropical Storm Anita to become Hurricane Anita during August 30. Hurricane Anita looked like it would strike Texas at first, but other weather systems did not allow it to do so.

After the merger, the Skyline and its larger counterpart, the Nissan Gloria, were sold in Japan at dealership sales channels called Nissan Prince Shop.\nIt is currently available in either coup\u00e9, or sedan body styles. They are most commonly known by their round brake lights. The station wagon bodystyle was ended in 1989 with the introduction of the R32 platform.\nModels R30 to R34 of the Skyline are still popular cars for modifying by Japanese car enthusiasts from the 1980s to today. There are available features such as straight-6 engines, turbochargers, and the high-performance GT-R trim. While not distributed in the United States, the Skyline's prominence in video games, movies and magazines resulted in many such cars being imported there from 1999 to late 2005. Motorex petitioned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to allow 1990\u20131999 GT-Rs and GTSs to be imported, at the condition that they were changed to meet United States Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards.\nThe 11th-generation Skyline (V35) was another major turning point for the nameplate. It dropped some of the Skyline's trademark characteristics such as the straight-6 engine and turbocharging, eventually separated the GT-R into its own line, and moved to V6-engined era, this decision which extended to all later Skylines. Nissan decided to keep the Skyline for the luxury-sport market. Its platform-mate, the 350Z, revived the Z line of pure sports cars. The V35 was the first Skyline made for export to North America, being sold under Nissan's luxury marque Infiniti as the G35. The Skyline (V36/J50) is sold in Europe, North America, South Korea, Taiwan, and the Middle East as the Infiniti G37.\nApril 11, 2010 saw a world record for the biggest ever Nissan Skyline meet and the most ever officially recognized on a track in the Guinness Book of World Records. This took place at Silverstone, United Kingdom at the ISTS event."}

The same year \"Vasa\" was ready outside Stockholm, but sank by accident on her maiden voyage (first trip). \"Vasa\" sank because she was too heavy on top. Those who built her knew that she had problems, but they didn't dare say that to the Swedish king Gustavus Adolphus. He was not in Sweden when \"Vasa\" was built and he wanted her to go fight in the Thirty Years' War as soon as possible. There was a hearing about why \"Vasa\" sank, but no one was found guilty or judged for her sinking.\nSwedish divers in diving bells brought up some of \"Vasa\"'s cannons from the sunken ship in the 1660s. Anders Franz\u00e9n found \"Vasa\" in 1956 after he had read about the ship in sources and looked for her in the water around Stockholm. The ship was brought up in 1961 and was then treated with special chemicals so that it would last for a long time. The preservation treatment took almost 20 years to complete. \"Vasa\" is now in the Vasa Museum in Stockholm, Sweden. It is a very popular place for tourists to visit. It gets more than one million visitors every year.\nWhen \"Vasa\" was brought up there were thousands of things inside her. There were bones of people, clothes, weapons, tools, coins, food and even some of the sails. The things and \"Vasa\" have been very good for historians, because they helps them understand how it was in Sweden in the 1600s. \"Vasa\" was a very expensive ship and was one of the largest in the world. She had hundreds of sculptures, and they were painted in many colors. She was a symbol of how powerful Sweden wanted to look and how good the Swedish king was."}

McDonald's Restaurants is also known as the \"McDonald's coffee case\". It is a lawsuit between Stella Liebeck and McDonald's. Stella Liebeck was badly injured by hot coffee. She had bought the coffee from a McDonald's restaurant. A jury awarded her $2.86 million, but in the end she only got $640,000. \nWhat happened to Stella Liebeck?\nThe accident with the hot coffee happened on February 27, 1992. Stella Liebeck was 79 years old. She bought a cup of coffee from the drive-through window of a McDonald's restaurant. When she opened the cup to add cream and sugar, she spilled the coffee on her lap. She was taken to the hospital and they found that she had bad burns. She had to stay in the hospital for eight days. She got skin grafting: they moved healthy skin to replace the burned skin. She lost a lot of weight. Her daughter had to care for her for 3 weeks when she came out of the hospital. The accident changed her body forever. She was disabled for 2 years.\nWhat did she want?\nStella Liebeck wanted $20,000 from McDonald's. She needed to pay the hospital and her daughter. McDonald's offered only $800. Then Liebeck hired an attorney, Reed Morgan. Morgan said that the coffee was dangerous and asked $90,000, but McDonald's refused. That is why they needed a trial.\nHow did the trial go?\nThe attorney, Reed Morgan, showed examples of what McDonald's did wrong: \nThen on August 18, 1994 the jury decided. They said that McDonald's was 80% wrong and Stella Liebeck was 20% wrong. The warning on the coffee cup was too small. Stella Liebeck got $160,000 to pay the hospital and her daughter. She also got $2,7 million so that McDonald's would not do it again. But the judge made it $640,000. "}

It transports sperm cells from the pollen grain, from the stigma (in flowering plants) to the ovules at the base of the pistil. Like ferns, other basal land plants, and many algae, some gymnosperms have flagellate sperm, which swim through a watery fluid to fertilize the egg cells.\nIn angiosperms the pollen tube germinates from the pollen grain and grows the entire length through the stigma, style, ovary and ovules to reach the eggs. In maize, this single cell can grow longer than 12 inches to traverse the length of the pistil. The sperm cells by themselves are not motile and are carried within the tube. As the tip of the tube reaches an egg it bursts and releases two sperm cells leading to a \"double fertilization\". One sperm unites with the egg cell to produce the embryo of a new plant, while a second sperm unites with the central cell (polar nuclei) to produce the endosperm of the seed. The endosperm is rich in starch, proteins and oils and is a major source of human food (e.g., wheat, barley, rye, oats, corn)"}

If the person says no, then she will rip their face so it resembles hers.\nThere are different rumors about how to avoid her killing you. One is to say she is average, and another is to ask her if you are beautiful, in hopes of confusing her so one could escape while she has to think about what to do next.\nThe stories of Kuchisake Onna came from the Heian period Japan, where there lived a very beautiful but very vain woman. Her husband thought she was being unfaithful to her, and cut her face out of jealousy.\nThis happened so because she used to be so beautiful that everyone in the late 90s used to dream her. One day her Samurai Husband went on a war and she started an affair with a young handsome young man.When he returned he found his wife having an affair with another person. So, he took his sharped sword and divided her face in to two halves through lips. This made her too ugly due to which no one ever looked her again.

{"id": "203072", "revid": "1011873", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=203072", "title": "Swan Lake", "text": "Swan Lake is a romantic ballet in four acts. Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky wrote the music. In 1871 he wrote a little ballet about swans for his nieces and nephews. He used some of the music from this ballet for \"Swan Lake\". The story of the ballet is based on a German fairy tale. This tale was probably tweaked by Tchaikovsky and his friends during the ballet's early discussion stages.\n\"Swan Lake\" is about a prince named Siegfried. He falls in love with the Swan princess, Odette. She is a swan by day, but a young woman at night. She is under a magic spell that can only be broken by a man who will make a promise to love her for all time. Siegfried makes the promise. He is tricked though by the magician who cast the spell. The ballet ends with the deaths of Siegfried and Odette.\nThe ballet was first performed on 4 March 1877 at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, Russia. Critics looked upon it as a failure for many reasons. In 1895 some changes were made to the ballet. It was then performed at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia. This time the critics thought \"Swan Lake\" a great success. Most performances today are based on this 1895 version.\nStory of the ballet.\nAct 1: \"1. Sc\u00e8ne\"The curtain rises on Prince Siegfried's birthday party. He is 21. On the next evening a grand ball will be held. He is to select a bride from six visiting princesses. Wolfgang, his tutor, introduces a band of peasants to the merrymakers. \"2. Valse. 3. Sc\u00e8ne.\" The Queen Mother enters. She thinks Siegfried is frivolous. The Queen Mother leaves. Benno encourages the Prince to continue the fun. \"4. Pas de trois.\"Dances for the peasants. \"5. Pas de deux.\"Dances for the merrymakers. \"6. Pas d'action.\"Wolfgang is drunk and collapses. \"7. Sujet.\"The sun sets. Siegfried suggests a final dance. \"8. Danse des coupes.\"The merrymakers dance a \"polonaise\" holding their goblets. \"9. Finale.\"A flock of swans flies overhead. Benno suggests a hunt. The Prince agrees. They set off.\nAct 2: \"10. Sc\u00e8ne.\"A lake shimmering in the moonlight is seen. Siegfried and his friends watch a flock of swans glide across the lake's surface. \"11. Sc\u00e8ne.\"The hunters take aim. The birds are transformed into maidens. Their leader asks Siegfried why he troubles them. She says that she is the Princess Odette. She and her companions have all been changed into swans by her wicked stepmother. They are watched by her stepmother's companion Von Rothbart in the guise of an owl. Only a marriage vow can break the spell that keeps her a swan by day and a maiden by night. \"12. Sc\u00e8ne.\"Siegfried says he loves Odette. She promises to attend tomorrow's ball. She warns him that her stepmother is very dangerous. \"13. Danse des cygnes.\" \"14 Sc\u00e8ne.\" Dawn breaks. Odette and her friends return to the lake as swans.\nAct 3: Guests arrive in Siegfried's castle for the selection of the Prince's bride. \"16. Danse du corps de ballet and des nains.\"All dance, including a group of dwarves. \"17. Sc\u00e8ne.\"La sortie des invit\u00e9s et la Valse. The six princesses arrive. \"18. Sc\u00e8ne.\" Siegfried does not choose a bride from among the six princesses. Von Rothbart enters with his daughter Odile. She is disguised as Odette. \"19. Pas de six.\" The princesses dance. \"20. Danse hongroise.\" \"21. Danse espagnole.\" \"22. Danse napolitaine.\" \"23. Danse Mazurka.\" \"24. Sc\u00e8ne.\"Siegfried chooses Odile as his bride, believing she is Odette. Von Rothbart flees the hall as an owl. Siegfried rushes into the night to find Odette.\nAct 4: \"25. Entr'acte. 26. Sc\u00e8ne.\"Odette's friends await her return to the lake. \"27. Danse des petits cygnes. 28. Sc\u00e8ne.\" Odette collapses into her companions' arms. She tells them what has happened. A storm rises. Siegfried reaches Odette. \"29. Sc\u00e8ne finale.\"He begs her to forgive him. She dies of grief in his arms. He throws her crown upon the waters. The waves overwhelm him. The swans are seen gliding away across the lake.\nLibretto and score.\nIn 1871 Tchaikovsky was passing the summer in the Ukraine with his sister Alexandra Davydova. It was in her home at Kamenka that he wrote a short ballet about swans for her children to perform. The story of the ballet was based on \"The Lake of Swans\", a German fairy tale. Tchaikovsky used a musical theme from this children's ballet in the mature \"Swan Lake\". Little else is known of this ballet for children. \nIn 1875 Vladimir Begitchev asked Tchaikovsky to write a ballet about swans. Begitchev was the official in charge of the repertory of the Imperial Theatres. Tchaikovsky accepted his invitation to write the ballet. He told Rimsky-Korsakov, \"I accepted the work, partly because I want the money, but also because I have long had the wish to try my hand at this kind of music.\" In August he had completed sketches for two acts. He finished the ballet on 10 April 1876.\nIt is uncertain who wrote the libretto of the ballet. Both Begitchev and the dancer Vasily Geltzer were credited in the programme. They likely based it upon discussions with the artists who met at Begitchev's salon. They also used tales from Johann Mus\u00e4us's \"Volksm\u00e4rchen der Deutschen\" (178286), a collection of German fairy and folk tales.\nComposition.\nTchaikovsky had no experience writing ballet music for the professional theatre when he accepted Begitchev's invitation. In 1875 he began work on \"Swan Lake\". It was his first ballet. He studied the ballet music of other writers. He liked the music and ballets of Leo Delibes. Tchaikovsky thought Delibes's music was pretty and tuneful. Tchaikovsky however would base \"Swan Lake\" on a symphonic scale. Writing the music for \"Swan Lake\" was a way for Tchaikovsky to avoid the reality of being a homosexual in czarist Russia. Russia was a repressive state. Homosexuals were sent to prison, exiled, or banished. Symphonies did not ease the stress in the way ballet music did; he had to put too much of his inner life into symphonies. He was hired to write \"Swan Lake\" in May 1875. He completed the music in April 1876. The official responsible for the music at the Bolshoi Theatre thought Tchaikovsky's music impossible to understand. A \"leitmotif\" in Tchaikovsky's little ballet music for his nieces and nephews came to be called the \"Song of the Swans\". Tchaikovsky used this \"leitmotif\" in \"Swan Lake\".\nMusic.\nJohn Warrack points out that Tchaikovsky put the drama in the story into music: \"By making B the key of the tragedy, he initiates a musical \"plot\" with the dark forces of Rothbart tending to drag the tonality down into flatter keys. The main action, on the other hand, lies on the key area of A.\" Tchaikovsky balanced all the musical components of the work. \"The divertissements are in his lightest, most appealing musical manner\", Warrack writes, \"The dances that further the plot have rather greater musical substance, while the scenes of narrative and action are in what was found his \"symphonic\" manner.\" Critics said Tchaikovsky's music was \"too noisy, too 'Wagnerian' and too symphonic\". \nFirst performance.\nRehearsals for \"Swan Lake\" began before Tchaikovsky finished the score, and took place over 11 months. Everyone involved in the production had never heard such a complex score for a ballet. They described the music as \"undanceable\". Even the conductor threw his hands up in despair over the music.\nThe choreographer Julius Reisinger was incompetent, and the sets lacked a cohesiveness because they were designed by three different men. In addition, the Bolshoi Theatre was suffering at the time from problems including the lack of a ballet master who could develop a production based on the score. The role of Odette was not given to a first rate dancer but instead to a second rate talent. The reason may have been political.\n\"Swan Lake\" was first performed on 4 March 1877 at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow. Julius Reisinger designed the dances. Pauline Karpakova danced Odette. She put some numbers she liked from other ballets into \"Swan Lake\". The ballet was a failure. In 1883 the Bolshoi dropped the ballet from its repertory. At that time, the sets were falling apart. It was not until 1901 that Alexander Gorsky staged a new production of \"Swan Lake\" for the Bolshoi.\nWhat people thought about the ballet.\nThe first performance of \"Swan Lake\" was a disaster. Herman Laroche wrote, \"I must say that I had never seen a poorer presentation on the Bolshoi stage. The costumes, decor, and machines did not hide in the least the emptiness of the dances. Not a single balletomane got out of it even five minutes of pleasure.\" He praised the music. He wrote that Tchaikovsky was \"in excellent humour ... he was fully at the height of his genius.\" Tchaikovsky's brother Modest wrote, \"The poverty of the production, meaning the d\u00e9cor and costumes, the absence of outstanding performers, the Ballet Master's weakness of imagination, and, finally, the orchestra ... all of this together permitted [Tchaikovsky] with good reason to cast the blame for the failure on others.\" The ballet was a moderate success with theatre-goers however. It was presented 33 times between its premi\u00e8re at the Bolshoi in 1877 and its final performance in 1883.\nSt. Peterburg revision, 1895.\nTchaikovsky died on 6 November 1893. People started to take more interest in his music after his death. Lev Ivanov was the assistant Ballet Master at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg. He designed new dances for Act 2. This act was presented on 1 March 1894 in a concert at the Mariinsky in memory of Tchaikovsky. Pierina Legnani danced Odette. The revised act was a great success. It was presented again with even greater success. Marius Petipa was the Ballet Master at the Mariinsky. He was impressed with the success of these two presentations. He made the decision to stage the complete ballet at the Mariinsky. He designed the dances for Acts 1 and 3 while Ivanov designed the dances for Acts 2 and 4.\nRiccardo Drigo was the conductor of the Mariinsky orchestra. He dropped some numbers from the ballet. He orchestrated three piano numbers from Tchaikovsky's Op. 72. He then put them in the ballet. These three numbers were \"L'Espi\u00e8gle\", \"Valse Bluette\", and \"Un poco di Chopin\". He then put a number into Act 3 which he may have written himself.\nTchaikovsky's brother Modest changed the ballet's story a little for the revision. He gave the ballet a happy ending. The new \"Swan Lake\" was presented on 27 January 1895 at the Mariinsky. Pierina Legnani danced both Odette and Odile. The ballet was a great success. This version of the ballet is the one generally seen today.\nThirty-two \"fouett\u00e9s en tournant\".\n\"Swan Lake\" is famous for the 32 \"fouett\u00e9s en tournant\" in Act 3. These \"fouett\u00e9s\" are danced at the end of the \"Black Swan\" \"pas de deux\" by the ballerina playing Odile. The \"pas\" was an afterthought of Tchaikovsky's. It was not included in the original production. It consists of the opening adagio followed by a variation for the male dancer. This is followed by a variation for the ballerina. The whole concludes with a brisk movement for both dancers that includes the \"fouett\u00e9s\". Pierina Legnani first danced the \"fouett\u00e9s\" in the Mariinsky production of 1895. Ballet-goers were uncertain about the 32 \"fouett\u00e9s\". Some thought they were just a stunt. Others found them exciting. These ballet-goers went to every performance to count the number of turns.\nOther early productions.\n\"Swan Lake\" became known in Europe and the United States not long after the revised version was presented at the Mariinsky Theatre in 1895. It was first presented in Europe at Prague in June 1907. It was first presented in the United States at the Metropolitan Opera House in December 1911. Diaghilev's Ballets Russes presented a two-act \"Swan Lake\" in London in 1911. The Ballets Russes presented a one-act version in London in 1925. The complete \"Swan Lake\" was first presented in England by the Sadler's Wells Ballet in November 1934. Ballerinas portraying Odette include Mathilde Kchessinska, Anna Pavlova, and Margot Fonteyn. Pavel Gerdt was the Prince Siegfried of the 1895 St. Petersburg production. Nijinsky and Rudolph Nureyev have also performed Prince Siegfried.\nStructure.\nThe score used in this comparison is Tchaikovsky's score. It may be different from Riccardo Drigo's score which is usually performed today. The titles for each number are taken from the original published score. Some of the numbers are titled simply as musical indications, those that are not are translated from their original French titles.\nIntroduction.\nModerato assai \u2014 Allegro non troppo \u2014 Tempo I\nAct III.\nAppendix I.\n\"Pas de deux for Mme.

He mainly painted 'still life'. He signed works between 1683 and 1707. Most of his paintings are small. His style is typical of Dutch 17th century still life painting. Other Dutch painters who lived at the same time had a different style of painting. Coorte was \"one of the last practitioners of this intimate category\".\nBiography.\nVery little is known about his life. He was probably born in Middelburg and also died there. He became a pupil of Melchior d'Hondecoeter around 1680 in Amsterdam. From 1683 he seems to have returned to Middelburg, where he set up a workshop and signed his small, carefully balanced minimalist still lifes. He often painted on paper that was glued to a wooden panel. About 80 signed works by him have been catalogued, and nearly all of them follow the same pattern; small arrangements of fruits, vegetables, or shells on a stone slab, lit from above, with the dark background typical of still lifes earlier in the century. Instead of the Chinese or silver vessels favoured by his contemporaries, his tableware is very basic pottery. \"Objects and light are studied intensely, and are painted with a wondrous tenderness\". Neither his birth nor death date is certain, and archival evidence only exists in Middelburg for his membership in the Guild of St. Luke there from 1695 onwards, when he was fined for selling a painting without being a member of the guild. His works appear frequently in contemporary Middelburg taxation inventories\nLegacy.\nCoorte was probably not well known to the people who lived at the same time, outside the city of Middelburg. Much like Vermeer, he was almost entirely forgotten. In the 1950s, the Dutch art historian Laurens J. Bol revived his reputation, beginning with an article in 1952, and finally publishing the first monograph and catalogue raissone on Coorte in 1977 (\"Adriaen Coorte\", Amsterdam). Bol arranged an exhibition of 35 examples of Coorte's work in 1958 at the Dordrechts Museum. This became a sensation in the Netherlands; the poets Hans Faverey and Ed Leeflang were both inspired by the paintings. In 2003 there was an exhibition at the National Gallery of Art, Washington. In 2008 a new travelling exhibition was set up; \"Ode to Coorte\", that was nearly as successful, making Coorte the most celebrated \"rediscovered\" Dutch Baroque painter of recent decades.\nHis paintings have been compared to Spanish Bodegones, but he may also have been influenced by older painters:"}

In a still life, objects like flowers, fruit, or glasses are arranged in a certain way, and then painted. Most still lifes are of inanimate objects manmade or natural.Still life painting has been popular since the 17th century, when Dutch painters like Adriaen Coorte raised it to a fine art. However, the idea is old: examples can be found in antiquity. With a still life, the artist can focus more on composition and arrangement than with other forms of painting, such as landscape painting or portraiture."}
