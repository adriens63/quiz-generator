The article is often unsigned. Australian and major United States newspapers, such as \"The New York Times\" and \"The Boston Globe\", often give editorials the heading \"opinion\".\nEditorials can also be in the form of a cartoon.\nThe editors decide on which issues their readers will want to know the newspaper's opinion.\nEditorials are usually published on a special page, called the editorial page. This often features letters to the editor from members of the public. The page opposite this page is called the op-ed page (opposite the editorial); and has opinion pieces by writers not employed by the publication. However, a newspaper may choose to publish an editorial on the front page. In the English-language press, this occurs rarely and only on topics considered very important; it is more common, however, in some European countries such as Spain, Italy, and France.\nMany newspapers do not put the name of the author on the editorial. Tom Clark, editorial writer for \"The Guardian\", argues that it helps readers discuss the issue, not the author. On the other hand, an editorial does reflect the position of a newspaper and the head of the newspaper, the editor, is known by name. Whilst the editor will often not write the editorial themselves, they maintain oversight and retain responsibility.\nWhen \"The Press\", a New Zealand newspaper based in Christchurch, changed after 157 years from broadsheet to compact in 2018, they published a list of editorials where current thinking differs from opinions expressed at the time. One example was the change in their view on women's suffrage in New Zealand. The government gave women the vote in 1893, and the editorial said that women would \"much prefer staying at home and attending to their household duties\" than going to the polling booths.\nIn fashion publishing, the term is often used to refer to \"photo\"-editorials. These are often full-page photographs on a particular theme, designer, model or other single topic, with or (as in a photo-essay) without accompanying text."}

It is based in Chicago, Illinois, USA. The dance company performs both classical ballets and modern dance pieces. Today, the company is based in Chicago, but from its first days in 1956 until 1995, it was based in New York City, USA. Many prominent choreographers have worked with the Joffrey, for example, Paul Taylor, Twyla Tharp, George Balanchine, and Robert Joffrey. The administrative center is in Joffrey Tower. Its dances are held at the Auditorium Theatre, but for 2020 the company had plans to move and begin holding its dances in the Civic Opera House (Chicago) as part of a seven-year rental agreement.\nHistory.\nWhen Robert Joffrey and Gerald Arpino started the company in 1956, they did something different from what other touring ballet companies did. Instead of just performing ballet classics, they had their six dancers dance new ballets by Joffrey. The troupe first performed in a major city in Chicago in 1957. The Joffrey Ballet originally settled in New York City, where joffrey was teaching dance to pay for the company. At that time, it was called the Robert Joffrey Theatre Ballet. The company began touring internationally in 1962. They first toured in the Middle East and Southeast Asia. In 1963, the company performed in the USSR. After some troubles, Joffrey built the company anew in 1965. \nThe new company was called the Joffrey Ballet. Following a successful season at the New York City Center in 1966, it was invited to become City Center's resident ballet company with Joffrey as artistic director and Arpino as chief choreographer. In 1973 Joffrey asked Twyla Tharp to create her first commissioned ballet, \"Deuce Coupe\". The company continued as City Center Joffrey Ballet until 1977. From 1977, it performed as the Joffrey Ballet, with a second home in Los Angeles from (1982-1992). In 1995, the company left New York City and moved to Chicago. At first, the Joffrey had financial difficulties in Chicago. But then it became successful. In 2005 the Joffrey Ballet celebrated its 10th anniversary in Chicago. In 2006 and 2007, it held two-season-long 50th anniversary celebrations. The celebrations included \"River to River\" tour of free, outdoor performances across Iowa, sponsored by Hancher Auditorium at the University of Iowa.\nIn 2007 Gerald Arpino retired from day-to-day operations, becoming artistic director emeritus until his death in 2009. In October 2007 former Joffrey dancer Ashley Wheater, assistant artistic director and ballet master for San Francisco Ballet, became the third artistic director.\nIn 2020, the company was one of a number of Chicago cultural organizations to receive financial support as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic/ That same year, the Joffrey canceled its entire 2020 season due to the pandemic. \"In addition, the Joffrey Academy of Dance, Official School of The Joffrey Ballet, and Joffrey Community Engagement . . . shifted to virtual programming until further notice.\" "}

Dubbed the \"King of Luk Thung\", he was one of the first major stars of Thailand's own country music genre. He was fatally shot while seated in his own car after a live performance in Nakhon Pathom.\nBiography.\nBorn in Suphan Buri Province, he chose Suraphol as his stage name. His first hit came in 1954 with \"Nam Ta Sao Wieng\" (\"Tears of a Lao Girl\"). It marked the emergence of luk thung, a Thai counterpart to such crooning styles as Japanese enka and Indonesian kroncong, and embodied such influences as Hollywood film music, American country music, Malay pop and Afro-Cuban rhythms.\nEnjoying popularity at the same time as Elvis Presley and The Beatles, Suraphol was sometimes called the \"Thai Elvis\". By the 1960s, there was no Thai performer who was better known than Suraphol Sombatcharoen.\nSuraphol composed more than 100 songs. Among his best known are \"Sao Suan Taeng\" (\"The Girl from the Cucumber Field\"), \"Mong\" (\"Look\"), \"Nam Ta Ja Tho\" (\"The Tears of a Corporal\"), \"Khong Plom\" (\"Fake Stuff\"), and \"Muai Cham\" (\"Broken-Hearted Chinese Girl\").\nShortly before his murder, he released his last and most memorable song, \"Siphok Pi Haeng Khwam Lang\" (\"\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e1a\u0e2b\u0e01\u0e1b\u0e35\u0e41\u0e2b\u0e48\u0e07\u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e31\u0e07\" or \"16 Years of Our Past\"), in which told sadly about the end of his own 16-year marriage, reflecting on both the happiness and bitterness of the union."}

New dating of the Popigai meteor suggests it may be a cause of the mass extinction.\nA leading scientific theory on climate cooling at this time predicts a decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide, which slowly declined in the mid to late Eocene and possibly reached some threshold about 34 million years ago. This boundary is closely linked with the Oligocene Oi-1 event, an oxygen isotope change which marks the beginning of ice sheet coverage on Antarctica."}

His father was Edmund Kean, an architect\u2019s assistant, and his mother, Anne Carey, was an actress. His mother was the daughter of the 18th-century composer and playwright Henry Carey.\nKean starting acting at the age of four, as a Cupid in Jean-Georges Noverre\u2019s ballet of \"Cymon\". As a child, his cheerfulness made him a universal favourite, but his background and lack of discipline, helped him develop independence and stubborn habits. In 1794, a few kind-hearted people paid for his school fees. Even though he did well in school, he found it unbearable. As such, he decided to work as a cabin boy at Portsmouth. Finding life at sea even more limiting, he pretended to be deaf and lame so skilfully that he managed to trick the doctors at Madeira.\nAfter returning to England, he requested for the protection of his uncle, Moses Kean, an entertainer, who introduced Kean to the study of Shakespeare. At the same time, Miss Charlotte Tidswell, an actress who had been especially kind to him since he was young, taught him the basics of acting.\nWhen his uncle died, Miss Charlotte was responsible in looking after Kean, and he began studying the main characters of Shakespeare. Kean displayed the creativeness of his mind by acting in a very different way from John Philip Kemble, an actor for many Shakespearean characters. A Mrs Clarke adopted Kean for his talents and appearance, but he was upset about a visitor's comments and suddenly left her house and went back to Miss Charlotte.\nDiscovery.\nAt the young age of 14, Kean was hired to act as main characters for 20 nights in the York Theatre, acting as Hamlet, Hastings and Cato. While he was at Richardson's Theatre, a travelling theatre company, the news of his talents reached George III, who ordered him to be at Windsor Castle. Kean later joined Saunders's circus, where while performaning as a horse rider, he fell and broke both legs. The accident left swelling on his foot throughout his life.\nKean learned music from Charles Incledon, dancing from D\u2019Egville, and fencing from Angelo. \nIn 1807, he had a chance to act in leading parts at the Belfast theatre with Sarah Siddons, who began by calling him \"a horrid little man\" and changed to saying that he \"played very, very well,\" but that \"there was too little of him to make a great actor\" after seeing his abilities.\nThe next year, Kean joined Samuel Butler's provincial troupe and went on to marry Mary Chambers of Waterford, a leading actress, on 17 July. His wife gave birth to two sons, one of whom was actor Charles Kean.\nDrury Lane and New York.\nFor several years, Kean's career had little chances to grow. But in 1814, the committee of Drury Lane Theatre, which was about to go bankrupt, decided to give Kean a chance among the \"experiments\" they were making to gain more popularity. When the hope of his first appearance in London got higher, he was so nervous that he exclaimed, \"If I succeed I shall go mad.\" As he was unable to pay for his elder son's medical treatment for some time, his son died the day after Kean signed the three-year Drury Lane contract.\nHis appearance at the Drury Lane Theatre on 26 January 1814 as Shylock left the audience enthusiastic. People recognised that Kean had brought self-respect and humanity to his role of the character. Jane Austen refered to his popularity in a letter she wrote to her sister, Cassandra, on 2 March 1814: \"Places are secured at Drury\nLane for Saturday, but so great is the rage for seeing Kean that only a third and fourth row could be got\". \nAppearances in \"Richard III\", \"Hamlet\", \"Othello\", \"Macbeth\" and \"King Lear\" demonstrated his ability to control his range of emotions. His joy was so great that he himself said, \"I could not feel the stage under me.\"\nIn 1817, Charles Bucke, a local playwright, submitted his play \"The Italians, or; The Fatal Accusation\" to Drury Lane, for which Kean was to play the main role. The play was well received by everyone until Kean said that his part was too small for him. Then, after a performance in February 1819 where Kean went to make a mess at the opening night of \"Switzerland\" by historical novelist Jane Porter, for whom Kean had had a personal dislike, Bucke pulled the play out of disrespect for Kean's actions.\nAfter much persuasion to still perform the play by the theater staff, Mr. Bucke then later had it republished with a introduction concerning the incident, including parts of conversation between the involved parties, which was later questioned in two books, \"The Assailant Assailed\" and \"A Defense of Edmund Kean, Esq.\" The result was embarassment on both sides and the play being performed anyway on 3 April 1819 to a terrible reception thanks to the dispute already surrounding the play and Kean's previous conduct.\nOn 29 November 1820, Kean appeared for the first time in New York City as Richard III. The success of his visit to America was unmistakable, although he fell into a annoying dispute with the news media. In 1821, Kean appeared in Boston with Mary Ann Duff in \"The Distrest Mother\", by Ambrose Philips, an adaptation of Racine's Andromaque. On 4 June 1821, he returned to England.\nKean was the first to fix the terrible ending to Shakespeare's \"King Lear\", which had been replaced on stage since 1681 by Nahum Tate's happy ending adaptation \"The History of King Lear\". Kean had previously acted as Tate's Lear, but told his wife that the London audience \"have no notion of what I can do till they see me over the dead body of Cordelia.\" Kean played as Lear for a few performances. They were not well received, though one critic described his dying scene as \"deeply affecting\", and with regret, he changed back to Tate.\nPrivate life.\nKean's lifestyle disrupted his career. As a result of his relationship with Charlotte Cox, the wife of a London city council member, Kean was sued by Mr Cox for criminal conversation (adultery). Kean was ordered to pay \u00a3800 to Mr Cox by a jury that only discussed for just 10 minutes. \"The Times\" launched a violent attack on him. The decision in the criminal conversation case of Cox v. Kean on 17 January 1825 caused his wife to leave him, and caused him to have such bitter feeling that he was boo-ed and attacked with fruits when he re-appeared at Drury Lane and nearly decided to retire permanently into private life. For many years, he lived at Keydell House, Horndean.\nSecond visit to America.\nThe purpose of Kean's second visit to America in 1825 was due to the repeated abuse he suffered in England. Some cities showed him a spirit of charity; many audiences submitted him to insults and even violence. In Quebec City, he was amazed with the kindness of some Huron Indians who went to his performances. He was made an honorary (unofficial) chief of the tribe, receiving the name \"Alanienouidet\". Kean's last appearance in New York was on 5 December 1826 in \"Richard III\", playing the same role in which he first acted in America.\nDecline and death.\nWhen Kean returned to England, he was received with favour in the end. However, his heavy reliance on the use of stimulants caused him his talents. Still, his great powers was successful during the moments of his creativity over the absolute ruin of his physical potential. His appearance in Paris was a failure due to being drunk.\nHis last appearance on the stage was at Covent Garden on 15 March 1833, when he played in \"Othello. When saying \"Villain, be sure,\" in scene 3 of act iii, Kean suddenly started crying in a stammered voice \"O God, I am dying. Speak to them, Charles,\" fell unconscious into his son, Charles Kean's, arms. He died in Surrey in 1833, and is honoured in the Parish Church where there is a memorial tablet on the floor, marking his grave and a wall plaque originally on the outside but moved inside and heavily restored during restoration work in 1904. He is buried in the parish church of All Saints, in the village of Catherington, Hampshire. His last words were claimed to have been \"dying is easy; comedy is hard.\" In Dublin, Gustavus Vaughan Brooke acted as William Tell after Kean's death.\nArtistic legacy.\nAs stated in the \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" Eleventh Edition, it was in the impression of the great creations of Shakespeare's fine mind that the varied beauty and magnificence of the acting of Kean were displayed in their highest form, although probably his most powerful character was Sir Giles Overreach in Philip Massinger\u2019s \"A New Way to Pay Old Debts\", the effect of his first performance of which was such that the pit rose altogether, and even the actors and actresses themselves were defeated by the terrific dramatic illusion. His main disadvantage as an actor was his height. Coleridge said, \"Seeing him act was like reading Shakespeare by flashes of lightning.\"\nStrangeness.\nHis strangeness at the height of his fame were numerous. Sometimes he would carelessly ride on his horse, Shylock, throughout the night. He was offered a tame lion with which he might be found playing in his drawing-room.\nPrize-fighters Mendoza and Richmond the Black were among his visitors and Henry Grattan was his loyal friend.\nAppraisals.\nIn his earlier days, Fran\u00e7ois Talma said of Kean, \"He is a magnificent uncut gem; polish and round him off and he will be a perfect tragedian.\" William Macready, who was amazed by Kean's \"Richard III\", met the actor at supper, speaks of his \"unassuming manner ... partaking in some degree of shyness\" and of the \"touching grace\" of his singing. Kean's way of saying \"I answer\u2014No!\" while acting as Sir Edward Mortimer in \"The Iron Chest\", made Macready know that he had no chance of getting the role from Kean. Kean's life was so full of dramatic interest that it was the subject (topic) for the play \"Kean\" by Jean-Paul Sartre as well as a play by Alexandre Dumas, entitled \"Kean, ou D\u00e9sordre et g\u00e9nie\", where actor Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rick Lema\u00eetre achieved one of his greatest success. In 1924, director Alexandre Volkoff made play by Alexandre Dumas into a French silent feature film with Russian actor Ivan Mosjoukine, who was then living in Paris, as the lead actor.\nTheatrical works.\nQuite a number of theatrical works have been based on Kean's life, such as:\nCultural influence.\nPeter O'Toole, a well-known 20th century British theatre and film actor, owned a ring that had once belonged to Kean, and he used the ring as a muse (insipration) for the writing of the second part of his autobiography \"Loitering With Intent: The Apprentice\" (1997). O'Toole said the line, \"dying is easy; comedy is hard\" and credited it to the last words of Kean in the 1982 movie \"My Favorite Year\"."}

The weapons and monsters look a little different from the earlier games, but there are fewer differences than in Doom 3. Other than the new graphics and new weapon, the gameplay was not much different from the earlier Doom games. It came out in 1997, but the game did not sell well because many popular FPS games came out that same year, including GoldenEye 007, Quake II, , and . However, the game does have a cult following and fans had made unlicensed mods on the PC and other video game consoles. Due to its popularity, Bethesda announced during Nintendo Direct 2019 that it would sell the game digitally on the Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Steam on November 22, 2019.

The equivalent title for women was Begum.\nIn modern times, the word is still used formally as a social title for men. It is cited after the name and is used generally with first names and not with last names.\nThe word entered English from Turkish \"bey\", itself derived from Old Turkic \"beg\", which - in the form \"b\u00e4g\" - has been mentioned as early as in the Orkhon inscriptions (8th century AD) and is usually translated as \"tribal leader\". The actual origin of the word is still disputed, though it is mostly agreed that it was a loan-word, in Old Turkic. This Turkic word is usually considered a borrowing from an Iranian language. However, German Turkologist Gerhard Doerfer assessed the derivation from Iranian as superficially attractive but quite uncertain, and pointed out the possibility that the word may be genuinely Turkic."}

In 1949 he was in Paris, called by Christian Dior for a stylistic collaboration with the French maison.\nAfter that experience, the Clark &amp; Morland Ltd in London also called him to design a line of shoes that he completed with all-Italian creativity.\nTogether with other names of the Italian fashion of the time such as Roberto Capucci, the Sartoria Antonelli, the atelier Carosa, Giovanelli Sciarra, Germana Marucelli, Polinober, the Sartoria Vanna and Jole Veneziani, he participated in 1952 in the first historical parade at the Sala Bianca in Palazzo Pitti in Florence. A very young Oriana Fallaci sent by the weekly Epoca told the news.\nIn 1953, together with other major names of the time (including Emilio Schuberth, the Sorelle Fontana, Alberto Fabiani, Giovannelli-Sciarra, Mingolini-Guggenheim, Eleonora Garnett and Simonetta), he founded the SIAM - Italian High Fashion Syndicate (later to become the National Chamber of Italian Fashion).\nIn July 1954, together with the Sorelle Fontana, Emilio Schuberth, Giovannelli-Sciarra, Eleonora Garnett and Mingolini-Guggenheim he took part in \"Alta Moda in Castel Sant'Angelo\".\nOn that occasion, the American Sally Kirkland, Fashion Editor of Life and of Vogue, was awarded for her role as ambassador of Italian fashion in the United States.\nDefying the conventions of the time (it was in the early fifties), he is the first to show an afro-American girl in a fashion parade, the young model Dolores Francine Rhiney. His creations are worn by actresses and famous women of those years. Ingrid Bergman, Sandra Dee, Jennifer Jones, May Britt, Anna Magnani, Virna Lisi, Sylva Koscina, Luciana Angiolillo, Isabella Albonico, Eloisa Cianni, Lucia Bos\u00e8, Lilli Cerasoli, Ivy Nicholson, Loredana Pavone, Joe Patterson, Anna Maria Ghislanzoni, Marta Marzotto and a very young Elsa Martinelli are some of these.\nIn 2014, the Maxxi museum in Rome as part of the \"Bellissima\" exhibition numbers him among the pioneers of Italian fashion."}

{"id": "712993", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=712993", "title": "History of the University of Kansas", "text": "The history of the University of Kansas starts in 1855. This was when people wanted to build a \"University of the Territory of Kansas.\" Nine years later in 1864, with the help of Amos Adams Lawrence, Kansas Governor Charles L. Robinson, and several other important people, the Kansas Legislature chartered the University of Kansas in Lawrence, Kansas. The university was at first funded by a $15,000 donation on a area of land from Charles Robinson and his wife Sara. The university started preparatory-level classes in 1866 and college-level classes in 1869.\nBeginnings: 1850s\u20131880s.\nConception.\nThe idea for a public university in the Kansas Territory was first mentioned by Territorial Governor Andrew Reeder on July 3, 1855. He gave a speech to members of the first territorial legislature, saying: \"To enlarge upon the necessity of general education for producing good government,\" he told the lawmakers, \"would be at this day a work of supererogation, and I leave the matter in your hands, confident it will receive the attention it deserves.\" After his speech, the session responded by creating a system of common schools for the territory. They also approved a charter for a \"University of the Territory of Kansas,\" proposed to be built in Douglas, Kansas (near present-day Lecompton). However, this proposed university was never built.\nLawrence residents had first thought of opening a private Free-State college in the town when it was first settled. This was in the summer of 1854. That fall, one of the members of the New England Emigrant Aid Company, Charles Robinson, told treasurer Amos Adams Lawrence that the people of Lawrence would start a college as soon as possible. It was supposed to be on top of Hogback Ridge (later known as Mount Oread). By 1856, no private college for Lawrence was yet created. However, the people of Lawrence were still hoping to create one. They also started to hope that it could later be changed into the state's university. On Christmas Day of 1856, a group of important Lawrence people approved a bill from a business committee. It said that the time had come to create a college in Lawrence. Fifteen trustees were chosen to govern the college. They immediately chose a committee to petition congress for land. It was estimated that $100,000 would be needed to get the college started properly. It was also believed that nearly all of this money would have to be raised outside of the Kansas Territory. The territorial legislature chartered a private \"University of Lawrence\" in January 1859. However, the people were never able to create a private college in Lawrence.\nEstablishment.\nIn 1859, in the Wyandotte Constitution - the constitution that Kansas became a state with - parts were written to create a state university. The first Kansas state legislature meeting in 1861, passed a bill that would create the state university in Manhattan, Kansas. They used the assets of the existing Blue Mont Central College. However, the bill was vetoed by Governor Charles Robinson of Lawrence. An attempt to override the veto in the Legislature failed by two votes. In 1862, another bill to make Manhattan the place of the state university failed by one vote. On February 16, 1863, the state accepted Manhattan's offer to donate the Blue Mont College building and grounds, and it created the state's land-grant college at the place. This would become Kansas State University.\nHowever, the legislature said Manhattan's land-grant institution was different than what a \"state university\" is. On February 20, 1863, Kansas Governor Thomas Carney signed into law a bill creating the state university in Lawrence. The law said that if Lawrence wanted the college, Lawrence would need to give a $15,000 endowment fund and a place for the university. The place would have to be in or near the town, and it had to be at least forty acres (160,000 m\u00b2) big. If Lawrence did not do these, Emporia would get the university instead of Lawrence.\nThe place chosen for the university was a hill known as Mount Oread or Hogback Ridge. It was owned by former Kansas Governor Charles L. Robinson. Robinson and his wife Sara traded the area to the State of Kansas in exchange for land somewhere else. The philanthropist Amos Adams Lawrence gave $10,000 of the needed endowment fund. The people of Lawrence raised the remaining cash by issuing notes supported by Governor Carney. On November 2, 1863, Governor Carney said that Lawrence had met the conditions to get the state university. On March 1, 1864, the University of Kansas was officially chartered.\nThe school's Board of Regents had its first meeting in March 1865. This is the event that KU dates its creation from. Work on the first college building (Old North College) started later that year. On July 19, 1866, the Board of Regents elected KU's first three faculty members.\nThe University of Kansas officially opened on September 12, 1866. It had 26 girls and 29 boys registered in the preparatory school. The school started teaching college-level classes in 1869. The first class (of four students) graduated from the university in 1873. It was one of the first public colleges to admit women and men equally in the United States.\nFrom these beginnings, a rivalry with Kansas State, the oldest public college in the state of Kansas, started.\nA student of the early 1870s was writer and journalist Frank Harris. In Volume 1 of his memoirs (\"My Life and Loves\", 1922), he described the intellectual climate he found in the university at that time. He said its New England liberal roots were being overtaken by conservatism.\nIn April 1874, the school's first serious student publication, \"Observer of Nature\", was issued. In March 1878, former Chancellor James Marvin led the school's first \"campus beautification\" project. Over 300 trees were planted, including an area which is now known as the \"Marvin Grove\".\n\"Rock Chalk Jayhawk\".\nIn May 1886, professor Edgar Henry Summerfield Bailey first proposed the cheer that would become the \"Rock Chalk Jayhawk, K.U.\u201d chant. Initially created for the KU science club, Bailey's version was \"Rah, Rah, Jayhawk, KU\" repeated three times. The rahs were later replaced by \"Rock Chalk.\" This is a transposition of chalk rock, the name for the limestone found on Mount Oread, where the Lawrence campus is. Over time, the chant became known worldwide. Former U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt said it the \"greatest college chant he'd ever heard.\" In 1920, the King of Belgium asked for a normal American college chant at the Olympic Games. After discussion, the athletes at the Games agreed on the Rock Chalk chant.\n1890s\u20131910s.\nCampus growth.\nIn 1893 the Kansas Legislature allowed $50,000 to build a new physics and electrical engineering building. The building resembled a French chateau now remembered as \"old\" Blake Hall. The next year, the university's library, Spooner Hall, was finished and opened. It is the oldest free-standing building still at KU. In 1895, the first long distance ship-to-shore message was sent by physics and engineering professor, Lucien I. Blake. The message was sent using underwater wireless technology.\nIn March 1898, lightning struck the engineering building and the heating plant. It started major fires, and destroyed both buildings. As a result, former Kansas City businessman George Fowler gave $18,000 to rebuild. It became known as the Fowler Shops. The building is now Stauffer-Flint Hall, where the journalism school is.\nStarting in 1910, electric trolleys started providing service throughout Lawrence and the KU campus. In the same year, Marvin Hall was dedicated as the School of Engineering. Haworth Hall was dedicated for the departments of geology and mineralogy. One year later, a commencement ceremony was held. This marked the completion of Potter Lake. On February 8, 1912, a group of KU women organized the Women's Athletic Association. It was the first group of its kind in the school's history. William B. Thayer and his wife donated their personal art collection to KU, valued at $150,000.\n1920s\u20131940s.\nIn 1921, the Memorial Stadium was built to replace McCook Field. The football team still plays in Memorial Stadium. This makes it the seventh oldest college football stadium in the United States.\nOn May 13, 1923, William Allen White became the first KU alumnus to win a Pulitzer Prize. It was awarded to him for his Emporia Gazette editorial \u201cTo An Anxious Friend\u201d. In that editorial, White defended free speech. The School of Business was created in 1924. The first campus union was built on in 1926 as a campus community center. On February 18, 1930, future KU alumnus Clyde Tombaugh said he discovered the planet Pluto. Later in 1930, present-day Snow Hall was completed and dedicated. It replaced the old, broken building. In 1932, one of KU's most famous football and wrestling stars, Pete Mehringer, qualified for the 1932 Olympics.\nA major civil rights decision came on August 8, 1938. Under severe pressure from Kansas Governor Walter Huxman and several civil rights leaders, the Kansas Board of Regents voted to stop rules which had stopped black students from completing their education at the KU School of Medicine. The current chancellor's residence was finished in 1939. It was known as \"The Outlook\". The residence was able to be built because of Elizabeth Watkins. Danforth Chapel was officially dedicated in April 1946.\nIn January 1946, the University of Kansas Press was created. The publishing house later joined with other universities in Kansas. It became the statewide University Press of Kansas.\n1950s\u20131970s.\nTo honor the 276 KU men and women who died in World War II, the Memorial Carillon and Campanile were dedicated on May 27, 1951. In 1954, the debate team won their first National Debate Tournament. Allen Fieldhouse was dedicated on March 1, 1955. The KU basketball team would win its only home game of the season on the same night. In 1968, former senator Robert F. Kennedy had presidential nomination speeches at both KU and K-State.\nIn early 1970, a firebomb exploded throughout the Kansas Union. It caused almost $1 million in damage. The School of Nursing was created in 1974 as a joint and co-equal unit of the KU Medical Center. The debate team had more success throughout the 1970s. They won the National Debate Tournament in 1970 and 1976. On February 21, 1978 former U.S. President Gerald Ford dedicated the new KU School of Law, Green Hall.\n1980s-1990s.\nIn 1983, the debate team won the National Debate Tournament for the fourth time. KU dedicated its Vietnam Memorial in 1986. It was the first university in the United States to build a monument like that. On June 15, 1991, lightning hit Hoch Auditorium. This created a fire which destroyed the building in less than an hour.\nIn 1993, the KU Edwards Campus was created in Overland Park, Kansas. It was created in order to provide adults with a chance to get college degrees and to get better education. The Edwards campus started providing programs developmental psychology, public administration, social work, systems analysis, engineering management and design.\n2000s to present.\nThe football team, led by coach Mark Mangino, won the 2008 Orange Bowl. They finished the season 12\u20131.\nIn 2009, the debate team won the National Debate Tournament for the fifth time in KU's history. Also in 2009, Bernadette Gray-Little became the first woman and African American to be the chancellor at the university. Gray-Little retired on June 30, 2017."}

The cognitive processes they use are known as executive functions (also called cognitive control): They are used to choose what to do, and to also control, if the chosed goals have been achieved. Some executive functions are basic cognitive processes such as attentional control, cognitive inhibition, inhibitory control, working memory, and cognitive flexibility. Higher-order executive functions require the use of several basic executive functions and include planning and fluid intelligence (for example reasoning and problem-solving).\nExecutive functions develop over time. They change during lifespan of an individual and can be improved at any time. Similarly, these cognitive processes can be adversely affected by different events. \nTests have been developed to assess the level of these functions. Rating scales can be used. These tests are usually performed as a part of a larger series of tests, which ain to find neurological and psychiatric disorders. An example of such a test is the Stroop test. An example of a scale is call Behaviour Rating Inventory of Excecutive functions. \nA counterexample of this is operant and classical conditioning: With these processes, individuals are \"taught\" to react in a certain way to a given stimulus. In such a situation, the indivual must override the response to a stimulus using executive functions. This is called inhibitory control. The prefrontal cortex is necessary but not solely sufficient for executive functions; other parts of the brain also have a role in mediating inhibitory control.\nCertain conditions affect cognitive control. These include addiction, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, and other central nervous system disorders. Stimulus-driven behavioral responses that are associated with a particular rewarding stimulus tend to dominate one's behavior in an addiction.\nHypothesized role.\nThe executive system is thought to be heavily involved in handling new situations outside the domain of some of our 'automatic' psychological processes that could be explained by the reproduction of learned schemas or set behaviors. Psychologists Don Norman and Tim Shallice have outlined five types of situations in which routine activation of behavior would not be sufficient for optimal performance:\nA \"prepotent response\" is a response for which immediate reinforcement (positive or negative) is available or has been previously associated with that response.\u00a0\nExecutive functions are often invoked when it is necessary to override prepotent responses that might otherwise be automatically triggered by stimuli in the environment. For example, on being presented with a potentially rewarding stimulus, such as a tasty piece of chocolate cake, a person might have the automatic response to take a bite. However, where such behavior conflicts with internal plans (such as having decided not to eat chocolate cake while on a diet), the executive functions might be engaged to inhibit that response.\nAlthough suppression of these prepotent responses is usually considered adaptive, problems for the development of the individual and the culture arise when feelings of right and wrong are overridden by cultural expectations or when creative impulses are overridden by executive inhibitions.\u00a0"}

The word Pahul or Puhul is a derivative from a substantive, \"pahu\" \u2014 meaning an agent which brightens, accelerates or sharpens the potentialities of a given object. In Sikhism, the baptised Sikh is also called an Amritdhari, literally meaning \"Amrit Taker\" or one who has \u2018Taken on Amrit\u2019. \nHistory.\nThis practice has been in existence since the times of Guru Nanak Dev (1469 - 1539). During that time-period, this ceremony was known as Charan Amrit or Charan Phul or the Pag Pahul, the words \"Charan\" and \"Pag\" both signifying the foot of the teacher. During that time-period, the neophytes poured water over Guru's toe to be initiated into the fold. When the Guru was not present, the \"masands\" or the local \"sangat\" leaders officiated. The water was poured on Guru's toe and then the devotees would drink it and seek blessings of the Guru. The Guru would guide the Sikhs about the Sikh teachings and instruct them to adopt them as a way of life.\nKhande di Pahul (Amrit ceremony) was initiated in the times of Guru Gobind Singh when Khalsa was inaugurated at Sri Anandpur Sahib on the day of Baisakhi in 1699. Guru Gobind Singh asked a gathering of Sikhs, \"who is prepared to die for God?\" At first, the people hesitated, and then one man stepped forward, and he was taken to a tent. After some time, Guru Gobind Singh came out of the tent, with blood dripping from his sword. He asked the same question again. After the next four volunteers were in the tent, he reappeared with the five, who were now all dressed like him. These five men came to be known as Panj Pyares or the Beloved Five. These five were initiated into the Khalsa by receiving Amrit. These five were Bhai Daya Singh, Bhai Mukham Singh, Bhai Sahib Singh, Bhai Dharam Singh and Bhai Himmat Singh. Sikh men were then given the name \"Singh\" meaning \"lion\" and the women received the last name \"Kaur\" meaning \"princess\"\n\"Khande Di Pahul\" not only embodies the primary objects of Sikh faith and the promises connected therewith, but also is itself a promise to lead a pure and pious life to unite with Almighty Lord. It is about inward cleansing of the conscience and seeking unity with The Supreme Lord through His Grace. The word \"Pahul\" is a derivative from the substantive, \"Pahu\"- which is an agent which brightens, accelerates or sharpens the potentialities of a given object.\nAmrit Chhakhna.\nAmrit Chhakhna refers to the drinking of the Amrit or the Nectar. The Amrit is administered in the presence of the holy text of the Sikhs, the Guru Granth Sahib which is consideded the 11th Guru. The candidates take a full bath, wear the five 5 Kakas and present themselves before the Guru Granth Sahib for initiation of Amrit.\nThe five Sikhs, who represent the five beloved, who have led a virtuous life and have strictly observed the Sikh discipline are chosen to prepare and administer the Amrit. The candidates for baptism are apprised of the Amrit conditions for acceptance before the ceremony is started. They are apprised about the pure and virtuous life they must lead. When the candidates agree to live by the discipline and code of Sikh conduct, the \"Panj Pyares\" start preparing the Amrit.\nA \"Sarb Loh\" (Iron or steel) cauldron (Bata or bowl) is filled with clean water. Some \"Patashas\" (sugar crystals/plums) are poured into the water. The Five Beloveds then sit in \"Vir Asan\" ( seated on the ground with left knee down and the right knee up) around the cauldron.\nThe mixture of Amrit is stirred with a \"Khanda\" while the Panj Pyares recite path of five Banis (\"Japji Sahib\", \"Jaap Sahib\", \"Sawayae\", \"Chaupai Sahib\" and \"Anand Sahib\") from Sri Guru Granth Sahib and Dasam Granth with attention and full concentration on the Amrit preparation in the cauldron. The solution thus prepared is called Amrit (nectar of immortality).\nIn this religion, it is believed that it should not be taken into mind that Amrit Chhakhna is the end purpose. It is the start of one's journey on a right path to attain a pure and pious life which is essential to attain God (according to the Guru Granth Sahib). It is not something external.\nThe person to become \"Amritdhari\" must wear the five holy symbols."}

It has instruments often found in both genres. It started in late 1960s, when rock bands such as the Doors, Pink Floyd, Yes, and the Moody Blues started using the Moog synthesizer into their music. Sampling and tape manipulation would also become common with the genre. Electronic rock acts usually combine things from other music styles, including punk rock, industrial rock, hip hop, techno, and synthpop. It has helped create subgenres such as indietronica, dance-punk, and electroclash. Since the late 2000s, electronic rock has become more popular."}

They were created in Birmingham in 1964. At first, the band had keyboardist Mike Pinder, multi-instrumentalist Ray Thomas, guitarist Denny Laine, drummer Graeme Edge, and bassist Clint Warwick. The group came became famous for their rhythm and blues music. They made some changes in musicians but settled on a line-up of Pinder, Thomas, Edge, guitarist Justin Hayward, and bassist John Lodge, who stayed together for most of the band's \"classic era\" into the early 1970s.\nTheir second album, \"Days of Future Passed\", which was released in 1967, was a combination of rock with classical music. This made the band early creators in the development of art rock and progressive rock. It has been described as a \"landmark\" and \"one of the first successful concept albums\". The group toured a lot in the early 1970s. Then, they took a long break from 1974 until 1977. Founder Mike Pinder left the group a year after they re-formed. He was replaced by Swiss keyboardist Patrick Moraz in 1978. In the following decade they took on a more synth-pop sound. They created \"The Other Side of Life\" in 1986. This made them the first band to earn each of its first three top 10 singles in the United States in a different decade. Health problems led to a smaller role for founder Ray Thomas throughout the 1980s. However, he made more music after Moraz left in 1991. Thomas left the band in 2002. The band's most recent album was \"December\" (2003), a collection of Christmas music. They continued to tour throughout the first decade of the 2000s. They still regroup for some events, one-off concerts, short tours, and cruises.\nThe Moody Blues' most successful songs include \"Go Now\", \"Nights in White Satin\", \"Tuesday Afternoon\", \"Question\", and \"Your Wildest Dreams\". The band has sold 70 million albums worldwide. This includes 18 platinum and gold LPs. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018."}

She was born in the Duchy of Lorraine into the House of Valois-Anjou. Margaret was the second eldest daughter of Ren\u00e9, King of Naples and Isabella, Duchess of Lorraine.\nMargaret was important in the Wars of the Roses. At times, she personally led the House of Lancaster into battle. Her husband had several nervous breakdowns. They were seen as insanity, so Margaret ruled the kingdom in his place. It was she who called for a Great Council in May 1455 that excluded the House of York headed by Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York. This started a civil conflict that lasted for more than thirty years. This conflict caused the deaths of thousands of men. One of those who died was her only son Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales, at the Battle of Tewkesbury in 1471.\nMargaret was taken prisoner by the Yorkists after the Lancastrian defeat at Tewkesbury. In 1475, she was ransomed by her cousin, King Louis XI of France. She went to live in France as a poor relation of the French king. She died in France at the age of 52.\nEarly life and marriage.\nMargaret was born on 23 March 1430 at Pont-\u00e0-Mousson in Lorraine. Margaret was the second daughter of Ren\u00e9, King of Naples and of Isabella, Duchess of Lorraine. She had five brothers and four sisters, as well as three half-siblings from her father's relationships with mistresses. Her father, popularly known as \"Good King Ren\u00e9\", was duke of Anjou and titular king of Naples, Sicily and Jerusalem; he has been described as \"a man of many crowns but no kingdoms\". Margaret was baptised at Toul in Lorraine. She spent her early years at the castle at Tarascon on the River Rh\u00f4ne in Provence and in the old royal palace at Capua, near Naples in the Kingdom of Sicily. Her mother took care of her education and may have arranged for her to have lessons with the scholar Antoine de la Sale, who taught her brothers. In childhood Margaret was known as \"la petite cr\u00e9ature\".\nOn 23 April 1445, Margaret married King Henry VI of England, at Titchfield Abbey in Hampshire. Henry was eight years older than she was. The king and queen of France were the uncle and aunt of the groom and the bride respectively: Henry's late mother, Catherine, had been the sister of King Charles VII, whose wife Marie of Anjou was a sister of Margaret's father Ren\u00e9. Further, Henry claimed for himself the Kingdom of France. He also controlled parts of northern France. Due to all this, the French king agreed to the marriage of Margaret to his rival on the condition that he would not have to provide the customary dowry and instead would receive the lands of Maine and Anjou from the English. The English government, fearing a highly negative reaction, kept this provision secret from the English public.\nMargaret was crowned Queen Consort of England on 30 May 1445 at Westminster Abbey by John Stafford, Archbishop of Canterbury at the age of fifteen. She was described as beautiful, and furthermore \"already a woman: passionate and proud and strong-willed\". Those that anticipated the future return of English claims to French territory believed that she already understood her duty to protect the interests of the Crown fervently. She seems to have inherited this indomitability from her mother, who fought to establish her husband's claim to the Kingdom of Naples, and from her paternal grandmother Yolande of Aragon, who actually governed Anjou \"with a man's hand\", putting the province in order and keeping out the English. Thus by family example and her own forceful personality, she was fully capable of becoming the \"champion of the Crown\".\nBirth of a son.\nHenry was more interested in religion and learning than in military matters and was not a successful king. He had reigned since he was only a few months old. Many of his actions had been done by people who ruled in his place. When he married Margaret, his mental condition was already unstable. At the time their only son, Edward of Westminster, Prince of Wales was born (on 13 October 1453), Henry had already suffered a complete breakdown. There were rumours that he was incapable of fathering a child and that the new Prince of Wales was the result of an adulterous liaison. Many have speculated that either Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset, or James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond was the young prince's actual father. Both were faithful allies of Margaret.\nAlthough Margaret was aggressively partisan and had a volatile temperament, she shared her husband's love of learning because of her cultured upbringing. She also gave her patronage to the founding of Queens' College, Cambridge.\nElizabeth Woodville (born ca 1437), later Queen of England as future wife of Margaret's husband's rival, King Edward IV, purportedly served Margaret of Anjou as a maid of honour. However, there is to little evidence to permit historians to establish this with absolute certainty: several women at Margaret's court bore the name Elizabeth or Isabella Grey.\nBeginnings of the dynastic civil wars.\nEnmity between Margaret and the Duke of York.\nAfter retiring from London to live in lavish state at Greenwich, Margaret was occupied with the care of her young son and did not display any signs of political will until she believed her husband was threatened with deposition by the ambitious Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York, who, to her consternation, had been appointed Lord Protector while Henry was mentally incapacitated from 1453 to 1454. The duke was a credible claimant to the English throne and by the end of his protectorship there were many powerful nobles and relatives prepared to back his claim. The Duke of York was powerful; Henry's advisers corrupt; Henry himself trusting, pliable, and increasingly unstable; Margaret defiantly unpopular, grimly and gallantly determined to maintain the English crown for her progeny. Yet at least one scholar identifies the source of the eventual Lancastrian downfall not as York's ambitions nearly so much as Margaret's ill-judged enmity toward York and her over-indulgence in unpopular allies. Nevertheless, Queen Margaret was a powerful force in the world of politics. King Henry was putty in her hands when she wanted something done.\nMargaret's biographer Helen Maurer, however, disagrees with earlier historians having dated the much-vaunted enmity between the Queen and York to the time he obtained the office of the protectorship. She suggests the mutual antagonism came about two years later in 1455 in the wake of the First Battle of St Albans, when Margaret perceived him as a challenge to the king's authority. Maurer bases this conclusion on a judicious study of Margaret's pattern of presenting gifts; this revealed that Margaret took a great deal of care to demonstrate that she favoured both York and Edmund Beaufort (Somerset) equally in the early 1450s. Maurer also claims that Margaret appeared to accept York's protectorship and asserts there is no substantial evidence to back up the long-standing belief that she was responsible for the Yorkists' exclusion from the Great Council following Henry's recovery (see below).\nThe late historian Paul Murray Kendall, on the other hand, maintained that Margaret's allies Edmund Beaufort (Somerset) and William de la Pole, then Earl of Suffolk, had no difficulty in persuading her that York, until then one of Henry VI's most trusted advisers, was responsible for her unpopularity and already too powerful to be trusted. Margaret not only convinced Henry to recall York from his post as governor in France and banish him instead to Ireland, she repeatedly attempted to have him assassinated during his travels to and from Ireland, once in 1449 and again in 1450. Edmund Beaufort (Somerset) and Suffolk's joint responsibility for the secret surrender of Maine in 1448, and then the subsequent disastrous loss of the rest of Normandy in 1449 embroiled Margaret and Henry's court in riots, uprisings by the magnates, and calls for the impeachment and execution of Margaret's two strongest allies. It also might have made an ultimate battle to the death between Margaret and the House of York inevitable by making manifest Richard's dangerous popularity with the Commons. Richard of York, safely returned from Ireland in 1450, confronted Henry and was readmitted as a trusted advisor. Soon thereafter, Henry agreed to convene Parliament to address the calls for reform. When Parliament met, the demands could not have been less acceptable to Margaret: not only were both Edmund Beaufort (Somerset) and Suffolk impeached for criminal mismanagement of French affairs and subverting justice, but it was charged as a crime against Suffolk (now a duke) that he had antagonised the king against the Duke of York. Further, the demands for reform put forward included that the Duke of York be acknowledged as the first councillor to the king, and the Speaker of Commons, perhaps with more fervour than wisdom, even proposed Richard, Duke of York, be recognised as heir to the throne. Within a few months, however, Margaret had regained control of Henry, Parliament was dissolved, the incautious Speaker thrown in prison, and Richard of York retired to Wales for the time being.\nIn 1457, the kingdom was again outraged when it was discovered that Pierre de Br\u00e9z\u00e9, a powerful French general and an adherent of Margaret, had landed on the English coast and burnt the town of Sandwich. As leader of a French force of 4,000 men from Honfleur, he aimed at taking advantage of the chaos in England. The mayor, John Drury, was killed in this raid. It thereafter became an established tradition, which survives to this day, that the Mayor of Sandwich wears a black robe mourning this ignoble deed. Margaret, in association with de Br\u00e9z\u00e9, became the object of scurrilous rumours and vulgar ballads. Public indignation was so high that Margaret, with great reluctance, was forced to give the Duke of York's kinsman Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, a commission to keep the sea for three years. He already held the post of Captain of Calais.\nLeader of Lancastrian faction.\nHostilities between the rival Yorkist and Lancastrian factions soon flared into armed conflict. In May 1455, just over five months after Henry VI recovered from a bout of mental illness and Richard of York's protectorship had ended, Margaret called for a Great Council from which the Yorkists were excluded. The Council called for an assemblage of the peers at Leicester to protect the king \"against his enemies\". York apparently was prepared for conflict and soon was marching south to meet the Lancastrian army marching north. The Lancastrians suffered a crushing defeat at the First Battle of St Albans on 22 May 1455. Edmund Beaufort (Somerset), the Earl of Northumberland and Lord Clifford were killed, Wiltshire fled the battlefield and King Henry was taken prisoner by the victorious Duke of York. In March 1458 along with her husband and leading nobles of the warring factions, she took part in The Love Day procession in London.\nIn 1459, hostilities resumed at the Battle of Blore Heath, where James Tuchet, 5th Baron Audley, was defeated by a Yorkist army under Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury.\nThe Wars of the Roses.\nEarly campaigns.\nWhile Margaret was attempting to raise further support for the Lancastrian cause in Scotland, her principal commander, Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset, gained a major victory for her at the Battle of Wakefield on 30 December 1460 by defeating the combined armies of the Duke of York and the Earl of Salisbury. Both men were beheaded and their heads displayed on the gates of the city of York. As Margaret was in Scotland at the time the battle had taken place, it was impossible that she issued the orders for their executions despite popular belief to the contrary. She followed up with a victory at the Second Battle of St Albans (at which she was present) on 17 February 1461. In this battle, she defeated the Yorkist forces of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, and recaptured her husband. It was after this battle that she, in a blatant act of vengeance, ordered the execution of two Yorkist prisoners of war, William Bonville, 1st Baron Bonville, and Sir Thomas Kyriell, who had kept watch over King Henry to keep him out of harm's way during the battle. The king had promised the two knights immunity, but Margaret gainsaid him and ordered their executions by decapitation. It is alleged that she put the men on trial at which her son presided. \"Fair son\", she allegedly asked, \"what death shall these knights die?\" Prince Edward replied that their heads should be cut off, despite the king's pleas for mercy.\nStay in France.\nThe Lancastrian army was beaten at the Battle of Towton on 29 March 1461 by the son of the late Duke of York, the future Edward IV of England, who deposed King Henry and proclaimed himself king. Margaret was determined to win back her son's inheritance and fled with him into Wales and later Scotland. Finding her way to France, she made an ally of her cousin, King Louis XI of France, and at his instigation she allowed an approach from Edward's former supporter, Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, who had fallen out with his former friend as a result of Edward's marriage to Elizabeth Woodville, and was now seeking revenge for the loss of his political influence. Warwick's daughter, Anne Neville, was married to Margaret's son Edward, Prince of Wales, in order to cement the alliance, and Margaret insisted that Warwick return to England to prove himself before she followed. He did so, restoring Henry VI briefly to the throne on 3 October 1470.\nFinal defeat at Tewkesbury.\nBy the time Margaret, her son and daughter-in-law (Anne) were ready to follow Warwick back to England, the tables had again turned in favour of the Yorkists, and the Earl was defeated and killed by the returning King Edward IV in the Battle of Barnet on 14 April 1471. Margaret was forced to lead her own army at the Battle of Tewkesbury on 4 May 1471, at which the Lancastrian forces were defeated and her seventeen-year-old son Edward of Westminster was killed. The circumstances of Edward's death have never been made clear; it is not known whether he was killed in the actual fighting or executed after the battle by the Duke of Clarence. If he died in battle, he would have been the only Prince of Wales ever to do so. Over the previous ten years, Margaret had gained a reputation for aggression and ruthlessness, but following her defeat at Tewkesbury and the death of her only son, she was completely broken in spirit. After she was taken captive by William Stanley at the end of the battle, Margaret was imprisoned by the order of King Edward. She was sent first to Wallingford Castle and then was transferred to the more secure Tower of London. Henry VI was also imprisoned in the Tower in the wake of Tewkesbury and he died there on the night of 21 May; the cause of his death is unknown, though regicide was suspected. In 1472 she was placed in the custody of her former lady-in-waiting Alice Chaucer, Duchess of Suffolk, where she remained until ransomed by Louis XI in 1475.\nDeath.\nMargaret lived in France for the next seven years as a poor relation of the king. She was hosted by Francis de Vignolles and died in his castle of Dampierre-sur-Loire, near Saumur (Anjou) on 25 August 1482 at the age of 52. She was entombed next to her parents in Angers Cathedral, but her remains were removed and scattered by revolutionaries who ransacked the cathedral during the French Revolution.\nMargaret's letters.\nMany letters, written by Margaret during her tenure as queen consort, still exist. One was written to the Corporation of London regarding injuries inflicted on her tenants at the manor of Enfield, which comprised part of her dower lands. Another letter was written to the Archbishop of Canterbury. Margaret's letters, which were typically headed with the words \"By the Quene,\" are compiled in a book edited by Cecil Monro, which was published for the Camden Society in 1863."}

Blackface became popular in the 19th century especially during Reconstruction after the American Civil War.\nBy the mid 19th century, blackface minstrel shows became a distinctive artform. It translated formal works, like opera, into popular terms for general audiences.\nEarly in the 20th century, blackface came off the minstrel show. It became a form in its own right.\nHowever, in the United States, blackface became less popular after the civil right movement. It is offensive and racist.\nThe videos for the Culture Club \"Do You Really Want to Hurt Me\" and Taco's \"Puttin' On the Ritz\" are videos in which actors in blackface appeared during the early 1980s. The original video for \"Puttin' On the Ritz\" (1983) was not allowed due to the characters in blackface in that video."}

It was one of the original top-level domains, established in January 1985.\nThe U.S. is the only country that has a government-specific top-level domain in addition to its ccTLD. Other countries typically use a second-level domain for this purpose, e.g., .gov.au for Australia, .gov.uk for the United Kingdom, .gc.ca for Canada, and .gouv.fr for France. Since the United States controls the .gov Top Level Domain, it would be impossible for another country to create a domain ending in .gov, for example, .jp.gov.\nSome U.S. federal agencies use .fed.us rather than .gov. The Department of Defense and its subsidiary organizations use .mil. Some U.S. governmental entities use other domains, such as the use of .com domains by the United States Postal Service (usps.com) and the United States Army (goarmy.com). Internet purists consider these usages to be improper, as these are governmental or military entities rather than commercial ones.\nAll governments in the U.S. are allowed to use .gov, such as atlantaga.gov for the city of Atlanta, and georgia.gov for the U.S. state of Georgia. This was not always true; under an earlier policy, only federal agencies were allowed to use the domain, and agencies beneath cabinet level were needed to use subdomains of their parent agency.\nThe usage of .gov as a gTLD controlled only by the U.S. is controversial, as some people believe this to be an example of arrogance by the U.S. \u2013 such views hold that usage of .fed.us or a new second-level domain of .gov.us would be more suitable. Others believe that U.S. control of .gov is a natural result of the fact that the U.S. federal government was responsible for the initial creation of the Internet and its first user."}

Many Cheyenne people hated this treaty because only a minority of Cheyenne chiefs had signed. They were also angry because those chiefs signed asking the rest of the tribe what they wanted. Different responses to the treaty were a reason why there was conflict between whites and Indians. This led to the Colorado War of 1864, including the Sand Creek Massacre.\nTreaty of Fort Laramie (1851).\nThe 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie between the United States and various tribes including the Cheyenne and Arapaho says that the Cheyenne and Arapaho were supposed to have a very big amount of territory in the area between the North Platte River and Arkansas River and eastward from the Rocky Mountains to western Kansas. This area included present-day southeastern Wyoming, southwestern Nebraska, most of eastern Colorado, and the westernmost parts of Kansas. However, in November 1858, people found gold in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado (then part of the western Kansas Territory). This created a gold rush. A lot of white people went across Cheyenne and Arapaho lands. Colorado territory officials asked federal authorities to change the size of Indians lands in the treaty. In Fall 1860, A.B. Greenwood, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, came to Bent's New Fort along the Arkansas River to make a new treaty.\nTreaty of Fort Wise (1861).\nOn February 18, 1861, six chiefs of the Southern Cheyenne and four of the Arapaho signed the Treaty of Fort Wise with the United States. This was at Bent's New Fort at Big Timbers. This was near what is now Lamar, Colorado. Lamar had been recently leased by the U.S. Government, and the name changed to Fort Wise. The Native Americans gave most of the lands given to them by the Fort Laramie treaty to the United States."}

However, ordinary window glass can shatter if the vehicle had a massive physical impact, which would produce flying sharp pieces of glass that can injure people. On 1917, Henry Ford developed the laminated safety glass from the French, which would help prevent broken glass from shattering. Modern windshields were developed from Ford's developments."}

The game is known for a team rejecting a touchdown awarded by the game officials.\nCentral Missouri's head coach Tate C. Page called it \"the finest act of sportsmanship\" that he ever saw. In the third quarter, Southwestern halfback Arthur Johnson completed a long run down the sidelines nearest Southwestern's bench. The referee signaled a touchdown. The crowd of 2,000 cheered.\nSouthwestern's head coach Harold Hunt ran out on the field to shout, \"Southwestern rejects the touchdown!\" He then told the officials that Johnson had stepped out of bounds. This would undo the touchdown. None of the referees had seen this happen, but they agreed to undo the touchdown. They put the ball back to the place where Coach Hunt said Johnson had stepped out. A photo of the run later showed Coach Hunt was correct. It was published in the Winfield Daily Courier.\nReferee W. P. Astle noted that there had been only three officials at the game instead of the regulation four. He later said, \"If the fourth official had been present to cover what was impossible for me to cover ...

It was played on December 25, 1905, in Wichita, Kansas. It was the first experiment with the forward pass. It was also the first experiment with the ten-yard requirement for first downs. It is unclear if the game was considered \"regular season\", \"post season\", or \"exhibition\" in classification.\nGame play.\nFairmount college was coached by Willis Bates. The head coach for Washburn that season was John H. Outland. However, since he was officiating, it is likely that the coaching job was given to assistant coach (and next year's head coach) Garfield Weede. The game ended in a 0\u20130 tie.\nThe weather for the game were good, but neither side was able to get close to the other team's goal except by a punt. Only seven first downs were made the entire game\u2014four by Washburn and three by Fairmount. Most of the game was played in the middle of the field. The fans were upset.\nNew rule test.\nSafer but not \"conducive\".\nBoth teams had played a previous game that same season. What made this second game different was that it was a test of a different way to play. During the game, each team's offense was required to gain ten yards in three downs instead of four to earn a new first down.\nThe experiment was considered a failure. Football legend John H. Outland officiated the game and said, \"It seems to me that the distance required in three downs would almost eliminate touchdowns, except through fakes or flukes.\" The \"Los Angeles Times\" said that there was much kicking and that the game was considered much safer than regular play, but that the new rule was not \"conducive to the sport.\"\nImpact.\nThree days later, 62 schools met in New York City to discuss rule changes to make the game safer. As a result of that meeting, the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States, later named the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), was created. Several other rule changes were made to make the game safer for players, including the addition of the forward pass.\nFirst forward pass.\nIn his history of the sport of football, David M. Nelson said that \"the first forward passes were thrown at the end of the 1905 season in a game between Fairmount and Washburn colleges in Kansas.\" Nelson says that Washburn did three passes, and Fairmount did two. Credit for the first pass goes to Fairmount's Bill Davis, who did a pass to Art Solter."}

This means an understanding, as there was no written policy at the highest level of organized baseball, the major leagues. There was minor league's vote in 1887 against allowing new contracts with black players within its league.

Unlike Minnan dialect, Fuzhou dialects say that there are fewer people. This is mainly because the social development model of Fuzhou and Minnan is different. Therefore, the two languages spread differently. The eastern part of the country is dominated by agriculture, while southern Fujian has a large number of fisheries.\nFuzhou dialect is popular in the seven counties of Fuzhou in the eastern part of Fujian, Ningde City and Nanping City, as well as Taiwan, Indonesia, Thailand, Brunei, Singapore. In addition, Fuzhou dialect is also popular in many Chinese communities in North America, South America, Europe, and Australia.\nFuzhou dialect is derived from ancient Chinese and medieval Chinese. Due to the large-scale immigration of Han, Jin and Tang Dynasty, these ancient languages merged into the current Fuzhou dialect. Fuzhou dialect has experienced slow and obvious changes in pronunciation and vocabulary in the last 200 years.\nIn ancient times, Yue people lived along the banks of the Li River. Since the kingdom of Chu destroyed the country, the descendants of the king led some of the subjects to migrate to Fujian and merged with the Yue people into the Yue ethnic group. In 110\u00a0BC, the Yue dynasty against Han and was settled by Emperor Wu of Han Dynasty, after which most of the Yue people were moved to the Jianghuai area. During the Western Han Dynasty, the Central Plains Han people entered the shackles for the first time, and merged with the Yue and Yue people. Fuzhou dialect was integrated into the Central Plains dialect.\nDuring the Jin Dynasty, the Central Plains people entered the country for the second time. The Han people and the Yue people further merged. The Han people became the main residents of Fuzhou, and the Central Plains dialect was once again integrated into the Fuzhou dialect.\nAt the end of the Tang Dynasty, the Han people of the Central Plains entered the country for the third time. Wang tried to establish the Shu Kingdom and strengthened the integration of the Central Plains dialect and the Gan dialect. Fuzhou dialect was basically formed in the Tang Dynasty and is gradually developing.\nThe Mandarin language movement in recent decades has led to fewer and fewer people in Fuzhou. Recently, the government and civil society have realized this problem and have taken many measures to promote it. According to statistics, half of Fuzhou young people now speak Fuzhou dialect.\nThe first book on the pronunciation of Fuzhou is the 'Yulin Sounds', which was published in the 17th century and provides a standard for Fuzhou dialect.\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, Western scholars studied Fuzhou dialect, compiled a dictionary, and translated the Bible into Fuzhou dialect. Japanese scholars published a series of books on Fuzhou dialect in the 1940s. The efforts of Western scholars have developed the use of the Latin alphabet to write Fuzhou dialect, which was standardized in 1890. This set of standards is mainly used in churches."}

Johnson (August 24, 1945 \u2013 July 6, 1992) was an American gay and transgender rights activist. She is best known for participating in the Stonewall riots in 1969. A founding member of the Gay Liberation Front, Johnson co-founded the advocacy group S.T.A.R. (Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries), alongside her friend Sylvia Rivera. From 1987 through 1992, Johnson was an AIDS activist with ACT UP.\nEarly life.\nJohnson was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey on August 24, 1945. She was one of seven children. Her father, Malcolm Michaels Sr, worked for General Motors. Her mother, mother, Alberta Claiborne, was a housekeeper. Johnson attended an African Methodist Episcopal Church as a child. Johnson was very religious. She was very interested in Catholicism, and kept a private altar at home. Johnson began wearing dresses at the age of five but stopped due to bullying from boys in her neighborhood. Johnson did not come to terms with being gay until the age of 17. Her mother was reportedly very homophobic, but Johnson has said that her mother was unaware of the LGBT community. After graduating from high school, Johnson moved to Greenwich Village, New York on her own. She supported herself by waiting tables. After meeting other gay people in the city, Johnson gained the confidence to come out herself.\nWorking as a performer.\nJohnson began working as a drag queen after coming out as gay. She chose the drag name \"Marsha P. Johnson\". \"Johnson\" comes from the restaurant Howard Johnson's. She said that the \"P\" stood for \"pay it not mind,\" a phrase she would use when people asked her gender. Johnson referred to herself as gay, a transvestite, and a drag queen interchangeably and preferred \"they,\" rather than \"she,\" to be used as a pronoun. Although she never referred to herself as being transgender, many modern scholars believe that was only because the term still was rarely used during her lifetime.\nJohnson said that her style of drag was not serious because she could not afford expensive clothes. She made flower crowns out of leftover flowers from the Flower District of Manhattan, which she began well known for wearing. Johnson was tall, thin and wore long flowing clothes, red high heels and bright wigs. This tended to draw a lot of attention. Her style was often described as being masculine and feminine at the same time.\nIn 1972, Johnson became a member of the New York-based drag performance troupe Hot Peaches. Johnson also performed with the troupe The Angels of Light. In 1975, Johnson was photographed by famous artist Andy Warhol, as part of a series called \"Ladies and Gentlemen\".\nStonewall riots and activism.\nThe Stonewall riots were a series of riots in New York City in 1969. They happened after the police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in Greenwich Village. Johnson is often said to have been one of the first people to begin rioting against the police, some going as far to say she \"threw the first brick at Stonewall\". Johnson denied this, but she did become heavily involved in gay rights activism after the police raid.\nAfter the Stonewall uprising, Johnson joined the Gay Liberation Front, which worked to fight against homophobia. She participated in a rally on the first anniversary of the Stonewall riots in 1970. Also in 1970, Johnson and her fellow GLF members staged a sit-in protest at New York University after the university staff canceled a dance when they learned it was sponsored by gay organizations. \nJohnson and her close friend Sylvia Rivera co-founded the Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR) organization. STAR advocated for transgender rights and also provided shelter for gay and transgender youth in the \"STAR House\", which also provided shelter for sex workers. Johnson worked to provide food, clothing, emotional support and a sense of family for homeless gay and transgender youth.\nThe two were banned from participating in the gay pride parade in 1973 when the staff running the event stated they were not going to allow drag queens at marches because they were \"giving them a bad name\". Their response was to march defiantly ahead of the parade. They believed it was their right to participate in pride alongside other members of the LGBT community.\nMental health and death.\nWhen she first came to New York City, Johnson became a sex worker to make money. She was arrested many times due to laws against prostitution. \nJohnson spoke of first having a mental breakdown in 1970. She would purposefully get herself arrested so that she would be given antipsychotic medication.\nThough remembered by most as a kind and generous person, she was known to have occasional bouts of anger and aggression. It is believed that she may have suffered from a mental illness which caused mood swings.\nJohnson was found dead shortly after the 1992 pride parade. Her body was discovered floating in the Hudson River. According to her friend, Randy Wicker, a witness saw Johnson fighting a man who later bragged about killing a drag queen named \"Marsha\". No arrests were made following this. Many locals believed that the law enforcement was unwilling to investigate Johnson's death because of her status as a drag queen and a sex worker.\nJohnson was cremated and her ashes were released over the Hudson River by her friends following a funeral at the local church.\nIn November 2012, activist Mariah Lopez was able to get the New York police department to reopen the case as a possible homicide.\nTributes and legacy.\nJohnson is remembered by many as an important figure in the fight for gay liberation.\nThe 2012 documentary \"Pay It No Mind \u2013 The Life and Times of Marsha P. Johnson\" features segments from a 1992 interview with Johnson, which was filmed shortly before her death. Many of her friends from Greenwich Village are interviewed for the documentary.\nIn 2018 the \"New York Times\" published a belated obituary for her.\nOn May 30, 2019, it was announced that Johnson and Sylvia Rivera would be honored with monuments at Greenwich Village, near the site of the Stonewall club.\nIn June 2019, Johnson was one of fifty American \u201cpioneers, trailblazers, and heroes\u201d inducted on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor within the Stonewall National Monument (SNM) in New York City\u2019s Stonewall Inn."}

There, he became the co-founder of the RDK (Republican Crimean Movement) party. In 1994, he headed the electoral block \"Russia\" for the Republican presidential elections, where he easily defeated Mykola Bahrov in the second round. Mykola Bahrov was at that time head of the Supreme Council of Crimea. In the second round of the presidential elections in Crimea in 1994, Meshkov won 72.9% and was elected only president of the republic.\nIts main political program was to facilitate much closer relations with the Russian Federation until the possible reunification of Crimea with Russia. Mechkov tried to initiate a political-military union with Russia and completely ignored the positions of the Ukrainian government. He also tried to force the rotation of the Russian currency, issue Russian passports to the population of Crimea and even transfer Crimea to the same time zone as Moscow. Due to the unexpected resistance of the local opposition, Meshkov only managed to place his autonomous republic in the Moscow time zone. He also appointed the Deputy Prime Minister, Russian economist Yevgeny Saburov, who has practically become the head of government. He then said in confrontations with other government officials about the legitimacy of his designee that he did not even have a Ukrainian passport. Because of this, Yevgeny Saburov was forced to resign. After that, he managed to paralyze the work of the Supreme Council of Crimea.\nIn 1995, the Ukrainian Parliament repealed the Crimean Constitution and abolished the office of president on March 17, 1995. After some previous warnings in September and November 1994 on March 17, 1995, the President of Ukraine Leonid Kuchma , signed the law of Ukraine that repeals the amended Constitution of Crimea and some other laws of the Republic of Crimea, because they were contrary to the Constitution of Ukraine and jeopardized the sovereignty of Ukraine."}

She was born into a wealthy and influential Alabama family. Her father was a leading 'Southern Democrat', and in the 1930s became Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. She was a childhood friend of Zelda Fitzgerald, the wife of novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald.\nTallula was an actress from the beginning to the end of her life. She acted in nearly 300 film, stage, television, and radio roles. Her personal life was wild. She struggled with alcoholism and drug addiction. She was infamous for her sex life, which included both men and women. \nTallulah was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 1972, and the Alabama Women's Hall of Fame in 1981. \nIn her 1932 movie \"Devil and the Deep\" there were three major co-stars, with Tallulah getting top billing over Gary Cooper, Charles Laughton, and Cary Grant. David O. Selznick, producer of \"Gone with the Wind\" (1939) called her the \"first choice among established stars\" to play Scarlett O'Hara. According to a memo from Selznick, November 11, 1936: Bankhead is first choice among established stars \u2013 and many votes coming in for her. Although her screen test for the role in black-and-white was superb, she photographed poorly in Technicolor. Selznick also thought that at age 36, she was too old to play Scarlett, who is 16 at the beginning of the film.

He was the leader of the Peruvian American Popular Revolutionary Alliance. Villanueva was born in Lima. He was the Prime Minister of Peru from 17 May 1988 through 15 May 1989 during Alan Garc\u00eda's first presidency. \nPolitical career.\nAt the age of 15 Villanueva became a member of APRA's \"Juventud Aprista Peruana\" in opposition to the military dictatorship of Luis Miguel S\u00e1nchez Cerro. At the age of 18 he was imprisoned in El Front\u00f3n prison (located on the small island of \"San Lorenzo\" off the coast of Callao, Lima's main port) for his subversive activities in Peru. He was a political ally and personal friend of V\u00edctor Ra\u00fal Haya de la Torre, the founder and most prominent leader of the APRA party.\nVillanueva spent most of his early life in different prisons for his political activities. In 1940, along with other APRA political activists, Villanueva was exiled to Chile. Between the 1940s and 1960s Villanueva spent his time in between Peruvian prisons and deportations to Chile and Argentina. While living in Santiago he met and married Lucia Ortega. They had a daughter: Lucia del Pilar Villanueva Ortega. \nIn late 1961, before a general amnesty was granted to members of APRA, Villanueva entered Peru clandestinely. He needed to start organizing the multiple party cells in preparation for their return to full political activities. Afraid that he would be caught, he sought refuge at his cousin's house in San Isidro. Ana Maria Villanueva de Riva-Vercellotti was married to an Italian, and Armando was convinced that Peru's secret police would never find him there. He was able to stay there, unperturbed, till full amnesty was granted.\nFrom 1963 to 1968 Villanueva served as a deputy in the lower house of the Peruvian legislature representing Lima, serving as President of the Chamber of Deputies from 1967 to 1968. Villanueva led the Aprista opposition to the military government of Juan Velasco.\nThe death of Haya de la Torre in 1979 propelled Villanueva to the leadership of the APRA party. As leader of the party Villanueva ran for the presidency in 1980 resulting in a second-place loss to the \"Popular Action\" party candidate Fernando Bela\u00fande. It is said that he lost the elections because the opposition mounted a negative campaign against him, claiming that he was married to a Chilean-born citizen. Chile's victory in the \"Guerra del Pacifico\" in 1883, which resulted in Peru losing a large chunk of its southern border to Chile, is still a subject of bad feeling in Peru.\nIn 1985 Villanueva was elected to the Peruvian Senate and elected as the President of the Senate from July 1986 to July 1987. During the presidency of Alan Garc\u00eda, he served as prime minister from 1988 to 1989.

The only known fossil of the pterosaur was found in 2017 north east of Winton, Queensland, Australia. \nThe pterosaur had a wingspan of about four metres, and when on the ground walked on its four limbs. The name, \"Ferrodraco lentoni\", comes from the Latin word, \"ferrum\" (iron), for the ironstone in which the fossil was found, and \"draco\", the Latin word for dragon. The species also is named after Graham Thomas 'Butch' Lenton, who was the mayor of Winton. \nOnly small parts of 15 different pterosaurs have been found in Australia. \"Ferrodraco\" is the most complete specimen found. Scientists have been able to identify five vertebrae, eight limb bones, a large part of the jaw and skull, and 40 teeth. They believe that the pterosaur lived about 96 million years ago. That is in the Upper Cretaceous. \nThe fossil is similar to pterosaurs found in England, except that it has much smaller teeth. This might be because of the type of food it ate, perhaps a diet of fish. Bones of pterosaurs were thin, and hollow, and because of this, very few have survived. \nWinton is well known as an area where dinosaur fossils are found, but this was the first pterosaur discovered here."}

Induced consumption is the idea that an increase in personal consumer spending (consumption) happens with an increase in disposable income (income after taxes and transfers). The proportion of disposable income which people spend on consumption is called the propensity to consume. MPC is the proportion of more income that a person spends. For example, if a household earns one extra dollar of disposable income, and the marginal propensity to consume is 0.65, then the household will spend 65 cents and save 35 cents of that dollar. Obviously, the household cannot spend \"more\" than the extra dollar (without borrowing).\nJohn Maynard Keynes says that the marginal propensity to consume is less than one.\nThe MPC is higher for poorer people than in rich.\nBackground.\nMathematically, the formula_1 function is written as the derivative of the consumption function formula_2 with respect to disposable income formula_3, i.e., the instantaneous slope of the formula_2-formula_3 curve.\nor, approximately,\nMarginal propensity to consume can be found by dividing change in consumption by a change in income, or formula_10. The MPC can be explained with the simple example:\nHere formula_11; formula_12\nTherefore, formula_13 or 83%.\nFor example, suppose you receive a bonus with your paycheck, and it's $500 on top of your normal annual earnings. You now have $500 more in income than you did before. If you decide to spend $400 of this marginal increase in income on something, your marginal propensity to consume will be 0.8 (formula_14)."}

For this reason, the caterpillars are sometimes called inchworms. \nA well-known species is the peppered moth (\"Biston betularia\"). Many species are classified as pests.\nAdults.\nMany geometrids have slender abdomens and broad wings which are usually held flat with the hindwings visible. They look a bit like butterflies, but in most respects they are typical moths. Most fly at night. They have a frenulum to link the wings, and the antennae of the males are often feathered. They blend into the background with camouflage. In some species, females have reduced wings.\nCaterpillars.\nMost caterpillars have four pairs of feet in their central section but geometer moth caterpillars only have two. This means that they are unable to move like the other caterpillars. They use the front pair of feet to hold on to a support, and then they pull the rest of their body up close. Next, they use the pairs of feet in the back part of their body to hold on, and push the front part forward. This means they are often in a position which looks like the Greek letter Omega, as can be seen in the photo. "}

The output of a key derivation function will look common to another result made from a random phrase. They are also used to re-use secret keys in a specific format, like using a shared secret key from the Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange for sending secrets in AES.\nUse.\nKey derivation functions are important in security. They allow a smaller \"secret phrase\" to be expanded into a larger key (of a fixed length decided by the KDF's digest size). This makes trying to find the original \"secret phrase\" more difficult. The length of the key makes it more difficult to discover the phrase or the hidden secret by trial and error (i.e. through brute-forcing), by making it difficult for a computer to guess. Sometimes, a small piece of random data (called a \"salt\") is added to the secret phrase before it is used with a KDF to make it more difficult guess the original \"secret phrase\" with a list of known \"hashes\".\nIt makes checking passwords safer without using the real password. Instead of keeping the real password, a \"hash\" of the key is kept and when checking the password, the \"hash\" of the real password is checked with the input. Some software put a limit on the length of a password and is sometimes used to make larger secret phrases smaller. KDFs are also made in a way so that, it takes a computer some effort to make the \"hash\". This makes making a list of potential combinations difficult."}

The problem with blocking all COX is that COX-1 is also used to regulate kidney function. Blocking COX-1 runs the risk of bleeding of the stomach, and reduction of the kidney function. COX-2 inhibitors only block COX-2, and do not have an effect on COX-1.. Clinical studies have shown that they increase the risk of a heart attack, and of a stroke.

He is an American educator and academic literary critic. He is professor emeritus of education and humanities at the University of Virginia. \nIn the 1960s Hirsch's \"Validity in Interpretation\" made an important work to contemporary literary theory and he was called \"the founder of contemporary intentionalism\". \nIn popular culture Hirsch is best known for his work on cultural literacy, and is the founder and chairman of the Core Knowledge Foundation. \nHe is a long-term critic of American schools, and promotes ideas for improving the education of children. His \"The Schools We Need: And Why We Don't Have Them\" (1996) was hated by the liberal left. It also managed to annoy the right wing because it attacked the local control of schools. in 2016 he published \" Why Knowledge Matters: Rescuing our Children from Failed Educational Theories\". This outlined three major problems with education in the United States. These are, according to him, the emphasis on teaching skills, such as critical thinking skills, rather than knowledge, individualism rather than communal learning, and developmentalism, that is, teaching children what is \"appropriate\" for their age.\nBeginning in 1990s, Hirsch began publishing books in the \"Core Knowledge Grader Series\" which the Foundation describes as \"an engaging, illustrated guide to the essential knowledge outlined in the Core Knowledge Sequence\". This series of books was received well by parents educating children at home, and it has been adopted by many school systems.\nSol Stern, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute who has written extensively on education reform, wrote in 2013 that Hirsch was \"the most important education reformer of the past half-century.\""}

It was created by Greg Daniels and Michael Schur. The show is about a group of people who live in a fictional town called Pawnee in the state of Indiana. They work in the government of Pawnee, in the Department of Parks and Recreation. The main character of the show is Leslie Knope. She is an optimistic person who loves her job and the city of Pawnee. The actress who plays her is Amy Poehler. There are many other characters in the show. They are: Ann Perkins (Rashida Jones), Mark Brendanawicz (Paul Schneider), Tom Haverford (Aziz Ansari), Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman), April Ludgate (Aubrey Plaza), Andy Dwyer (Chris Pratt), Ben Wyatt (Adam Scott), Chris Traeger (Rob Lowe), Jerry Gergich (Jim O'Heir), Donna Meagle (Retta), and Craig Middlebrooks (Billy Eichner).\nThe series changed as time went on. The writers wanted to make the show like real life. To do this, they learned about how governments of cities really worked. They also talked about current political issues in episodes of the show. For example, one episode has the government of Pawnee shut down. This means that there is not enough money for the government to work correctly, so it stops doing everything that is not very important. The writers put this in the show because of a real government shutdown. The real shutdown happened because of a financial crisis in 2007-2008, and this was the same time that the episode was being written. Sometimes, real politicians also acted on the show. Joe Biden, John McCain, and Michelle Obama were some of the politicians who did this. The characters in the show also changed. Some people watched the first season and thought that Leslie Knope was too ditzy\u2014that is, unintelligent and unable to do her job correctly. So the writers changed the way they showed Leslie. They wanted viewers to know she really was smart. During the show, many of the characters have changing romantic relationships and get different jobs. They changed just like people change in real life.\nThe first season only had six episodes. It got mixed reviews. People thought some things about it were good, and some things about it were bad. Many people thought it was too much like \"The Office.\" Like \"Parks and Recreation, The Office\" was another sitcom that Daniels created. But after the first season, it got positive reviews. Many people thought it was good, and it won many awards. It was nominated for an Emmy Award 14 times. It was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series\u2014Musical or Comedy. It won a Golden Globe Award for the good job Poehler \ndid playing Leslie Knope."}

This species and its relatives are often used for studies on genetics, development, physiology, and behaviour.\n\"D. melanogaster\" is not so much studied in the field as in the laboratory. The best-known studies of \"Drosophila\" in a natural environment was done by Dobzhansky and colleagues on \"Drosophila pseudoobscura\" from the early 1930s to 1970. Reprints and discussions are in Lewontin \"et al\" 2003, and theoretical discussions in Dobzhansky, 1970.\nThe cells of fruit flies usually do not divide after the imago is hatched. The fruit fly is mostly composed of post-mitotic cells, has a very short lifespan, and shows gradual ageing. As in other species, temperature influences the life history of the animal. They live longer in colder weather. Several genes can be manipulated to extend the lifespan of these insects.\nThe Drosophilidae has two subfamilies, the Drosophilinae and the Steganinae."}

He first joined the team in 1993. After a determined training, he played in both of Belize\u2019s 1998 Wold Cup qualification games against Panama in March 1996. Although, his team made it through the qualification Round. They would eventually lose the World Cup that year. After the loss for his team, Contreras announced his resignation from the Team and that he no longer aspires to enter the Soccer arena. He also said that he will be looking for another opportunity to serve the People of Belize. \nElectoral history \nContreras first joined the UDP in 1997 when he submitted his Nomination to contest the UDP Standard Bareer convention and election in Cayo West against Guillermo Valdez, who contested the 1993 election under the UDP ticket. Contreras had the support of Prime minister, Manuel Esquivel and Former UDP Leader, Dean Lindo, while Valdez was backed by Deputy prime minister, Barrow and Minister of Police and the Army, Michael Finnegan (Belizean politician). In the end, Contreras won 1,537 votes to Valdez\u2019s 1,527 votes. Contreras then prepared himself to face Amin Hegar of the People\u2019s United Party (PUP) in the 1998 Belizean general election who had been the MP for Cayo West for over five years. Contreras had a disadvantage and new that the road to Cayo West was not easy. He was even criticised for \u201clack of experience\u201d. When Esquivel called the election, Contreras led his People in a March from Cinderella Plaza through downtown Belize City to the Island. It was a very Successful March which energised his Party. After the March concluded, Lindo spoke to News 5 and said that he has full confidence that Contreras will win and deliver Cayo West for his People. Public support for Contreras indicated that he was going to win his Constituency with a Landslide victory. However that all changed on Election Day. It was found that Contreras had allegedly handed out leases to over four hundred lots on Election Day and this constituted Bribery under the Election laws. The written Opinion in the case has not yet been released. After a determined Campaign, Contreras emerged Victorious, gaining 1,537 votes to Hegar\u2019s 1,527 votes retiring the one term MP. Bucking a National trend, Contreras as the Only UDP Candidate to defeat a PUP House Incumbent In 1998 and one of the only three UDP members elected nationwide that Year. After the UDP\u2019s Landslide lost in the 1998 election, Esquivel resigned as UDP Leader and the Party had only three suitable candidates for the post. A The first being Front-runner, Barrow who was considered favourite in the race and the others being, Finnegan and Contreras. Both declined the offer to run for Party Leader and instead Contreras submitted his Nomination to run for Second Deputy Leader of the UDP and so the Party had no other option but to elect Barrow as their Leader. Barrow formed his Shadow cabinet comprising with just three Opposition Ministers. He appointed Contreras as Shadow Minister of Economic Development, Investment and Traderesponsible for aguing with Minister, Ralph Fonseca on issues concerning the Budget planning and management, Economic development, Investment and Trade. Contreras discharged his duties in the portfolio faithfully and eagerly. In 1999, he provided free Petrol to cars in his Constituency and reduced the sales of Vechicals by $1000. As a result, many of his constituents were able to afford them. In 2000, he officially opened a Sewing shop in Benque Viejo del Carmen. Soon the 2003 general election came, and it was time for Contreras to secure another term in Cayo West. He was endorsed unopposed as Standard-Bareer for the Constituency In 2002. He then went on to go neck-a-neck against PUP Newcomer Kendall Mendez. During the campaign, Contreras sited his major Achievements in his first term and embodied the road ahead for Cayo West. Contreras was once again Victorious In Cayo West, acquiring 2,180 votes to beat Mendez, whose votes totalled 1,800. Although Cayo West remained a UDP Stronghold, it lost the election that year and was sent back to opposition. This time with a larger Shadow cabinet of 7 ministers, Barrow selected Contreras to be Shadow Minister of Economic Development, Shadow Minister of Commerce, Industry and Consumer Protection. This time with double the responsibilities. In 2005, Contreras wrote a stimulase plan on how to tackle the Economic downfall and create more industries. Two issues that the Musa Administration failed to Address during his 10-year term. The UDP was on "}

However, he was only verified as the oldest living man, as the oldest living person was believed to be Kamato Hongo, also from Kyushu, who claimed to be almost one and a half-year older but is nowadays debunked as evidence suggests she was most likely at least four years younger than she claimed.\nBiography.\nChuganji, born in Fukuoka Prefecture on 23 March 1889, graduated from a technical school in the early 1900s and worked as a silkworm breeder, instructor in the agricultural specialty, as a bank employee, and community welfare officer. He had 4 sons and one daughter, who was 74 years old at the time of his death and his only living child, 7 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren. He did not like to eat vegetables but liked beef, pork and chicken, and daily ate toffee and drank a glass of milk and the occasional apple juice and only drank alcohol in moderation, which he believed as the secrets to a long life. During the last years of his life, he had failing eye sight and was bedridden.\nChuganji, who was the 6th Japanese man to become a supercentenarian, became the oldest living Japanese man after Sadayoshi Tanabe's death on 18 January 2000 and over a year later, on his 112th birthday, even the third Japanese man to become at least 112 years old as well as the oldest Japanese man ever after surpassing both Gengan Tonaki and Denzo Ishizaki, the oldest living man in the world after Italian World War I-veteran Antonio Todde's death on 3 January 2002 and at the same time Japan's oldest living person after Matsuno Oikawa's death, and finally also the oldest living person in the world - and the first man who became the oldest living person after James M. King's death in June 1967 - after the American woman Mae Harrington's death on 29 December 2002. Just 12 weeks later, on 23 March 2003, Chuganji became the first Japanese man, and only the second man in the world after 115-year-old Christian Mortensen who died almost 5 years earlier, to become at least 114 years old (although the claimed 120-year-old Shigechiyo Izumi was still believed to have been older, and Denzo Ishizaki who died a year after Christian Mortensen at age 112 years, 191 days claimed to have been two years older, asserting that his birth register which showed a birth year of 1886 rather than 1884 was \"delayed by two years\").\nDeath.\nOn the evening of Sunday 28 September 2003, after being served a glass of apple juice by his daughter, Chuganji died of natural causes at age 114 years, 27 weeks and was the oldest Japanese man ever, though until 25 October 2011 when his record was broken by Jiroemon Kimura who was the second Japanese man to become 114 years old as well as the only man who has become at least 116 years old, and (after 111-year-old Norio Kawada's death on 6 June 2003) the only living Japanese male supercentenarian. The first Japanese man who became a supercentenarian after Chuganji's death was Kohachi Shigetaka (10 May 1895 \u2013 3 July 2005); both Kameni Nakamura and Minsho Ozawa, who were the oldest living Japanese men after Chuganji's death and both born in October 1894 and died in 2004, as well as Totaro Murakami who died just 18 days after Ozawa, died before their 110th birthdays.\nChuganji was succeeded as the oldest living person by Mitoyo Kawate of Hiroshima and as the oldest living man by Spaniard Joan Riudavets."}
