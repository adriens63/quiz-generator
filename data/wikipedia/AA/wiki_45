Later on, she moved to acting. Her most famous role is as Rose Tyler, a companion to the Doctor in the television series \"Doctor Who\". She played this role from 2005 to 2006, and also reprised it in 2008 and 2010.\nCareer.\nMusic.\nPiper's first chance in the entertainment world came when she was a teenager, when she was selected to appear on the Saturday morning kids' television show \"Scratchy and Co\". Piper later got a role in a television commercial promoting the pop magazine \"Smash Hits\". In 1996 she sang on a backing song Nobody's Business. It was a dance track by h20. Soon after she was offered a record deal at the age of fifteen, and in 1998 became the youngest artist ever to start at number one in the UK Singles Chart with \"Because We Want To\", released under the artist name \"Billie\". Her follow-up single \"Girlfriend\" also started at number one and her first album, \"Honey to the B\" (released immediately afterwards) started at Number 14 in the UK album charts. She released two further singles off the album, \"She Wants You\" and \"Honey to the B\"; both songs started at Number 3. \nPiper then took a year to record her second album. She decided to release more records under her full name, Billie Piper. She returned to the Singles Chart in May 2000 with a new, sexier sound. She hit the Number 1 spot with \"Day &amp; Night\", but her success was not to carry on. She waited until the following September to release \"Something Deep Inside\". That reached Number 4 in the UK Singles Chart. In October 2000, Piper released her second album, \"Walk of Life\", which reached Number 14 in the UK Album Chart. The song \"Walk of Life\", the last single off this album, was released in December 2000 and reached Number 25 in the UK Singles Chart.\nIn 1999, Piper was nominated for two BRIT Awards and was named Best Female Star at the \"Smash Hits\" Poll Winners' party, although at the latter ceremony she began crying after being nastily booed by jealous fans of Ritchie Neville, member of boyband Five, whom she was dating at the time.\nOn 15 January 2007, BBC Radio 1 DJ Chris Moyles started a campaign to get \"Honey to the B\" back into the Top 100 on download sales as a way of testing out new chart rules that favour download sales. The campaign was highly successful, with \"Honey to the Bee\"re-entering the official UK singles chart at No. 17, eight years after it was first released.\nPiper prefers lip singing during performances. She backs this up with the reason that she is afraid she would not be able to sing live. However, in 1999 she decided to try actually singing during her tour in America. The audience loved it, but Piper said it made her too nervous to do it in Britain, where she had many more fans.\nTelevision.\nAfter an extended break, Piper decided to end her pop career in 2003 and return to her first ambition, acting. She took acting lessons while living in London. Piper gained very good reviews for these appearances and critics said that she was a far better actress than she was a singer.\nIn 2004, Piper appeared in the movies \"The Calcium Kid\", as the romantic interest of Orlando Bloom's character, and \"Things to do Before You're Thirty\". Shortly before starting work on \"Doctor Who\", she was one of the main characters in the horror movie \"Spirit Trap\" alongside Russian pop star Alsou, released in the summer of 2005 to bad reviews.\nIn May 2004, it was announced that Piper was to play the character Rose Tyler, companion to The Doctor, played by Christopher Eccleston, in the long-running BBC television series \"Doctor Who\", beginning in 2005.\nPiper won the Most Popular Actress category at the 2005 and 2006 National Television Awards for her work on \"Doctor Who\". BBC News named Piper as one of its \"Faces of the Year\" for 2005, primarily due to her success in \"Doctor Who\". At \"The South Bank Show\" Awards on 27 January 2006 Piper was awarded \"The Times\" Breakthrough Award for her successful transition from singing to acting. In March 2006, the Television and Radio Industries Club named Piper as best new TV talent at their annual awards ceremony. In September 2006, Piper was named Best Actress at the TV Quick and TV Choice Awards.\nAfter the completion of the very successful first series of the revamped \"Doctor Who\", the British media regularly released conflicting reports about how long Piper would be staying with the programme. In March 2006, she claimed that she would continue on \"Doctor Who\" into its third season in 2007. On 10 May 2006, however, she was reported to be considering quitting the series, although she did express an interest in playing a female version of the Doctor in the future (possibly related to a proposed \"Doctor Who\" spin-off series about Rose which was later dropped). On 15 June 2006, the BBC announced that she was to depart in the final episode of the second series, \"Doomsday\". Piper's decision to leave had been taken a year previously, but remained a secret until news of her departure became public.\nOn 27 November 2007, the BBC confirmed that she would return her role as Rose Tyler in the fourth series for three episodes. Later, it was confirmed by Russell T Davies in Doctor Who Magazine that this return had been planned since she left. It was also revealed in the Turn Left Doctor Who Confidential that Billie had made arrangements to return as Rose since she decided to leave.\nThe series began in April 2008, and after several cameo appearances, Piper made her official return as Rose in the series four final episodes Turn Left, The Stolen Earth and Journey's End. She has not said whether she will be reprising the role again, although on Doctor Who Confidential she said that she thinks \"It's never really the end for the Doctor and Rose\" but it probably was \"for the foreseeable future\".\nIn November 2005, Piper starred as Hero in a BBC adaptation of \"Much Ado About Nothing\", updated for the modern day like in \"Canterbury Tales\" series in which she featured, with Hero now being a weather presenter in a television station.\nPiper has completed work on a BBC version of Philip Pullman's historical novel \"The Ruby in the Smoke\" broadcast in December 2006, Piper played main character Sally Lockhart, a Victorian orphan. The BBC plans to film all four of Pullman's Sally Lockhart novels, with Piper continuing in the role in \"The Shadow in the North\" which was shown in December 2007. In 2007 she appeared as the main character, Fanny Price, in an adaptation of Jane Austen's novel \"Mansfield Park\", screened on ITV1. This was her first acting role on television for a broadcaster other than the BBC.\nPiper has provided voiceovers for various television commercials, including one for \"Comfort Fabric Softener\" airing in June 2007.\nPiper stars in \"Secret Diary of a Call Girl\", an ITV2 version of Belle de Jour's \"The Intimate Adventures of a London Call Girl\", a memoir detailing the life of a high-class prostitute. The series, which aired from 27 September 2007, saw Piper in several semi-nude scenes, including a lesbian romp and one scene featuring her saddling a client and riding him like a horse. A second series, with Piper in the starring role, started filming in May 2008, during which two body doubles were hired in order to effectively hide Piper's pregnancy.\nTheatre.\nPiper made her first stage appearance in a touring production of Christopher Hampton's play \"Treats\", which opened in early 2007 in Windsor. \"Treats\" was to have ended its tour in the West End, at the Garrick Theatre, starting on 28 February 2007 with previews from on 20 February. The play-officially finished as of 26 May."}

It was also a radio programme. Since the television series, there have been live tours of it.\nThe first series is about two zookeepers called Howard and Vince. The second series is also about them but is set in a flat. The third is set in a shop.\nHistory.\nFielding first met Barratt after seeing him perform his solo stand-up performance at the Hellfire Comedy Club in the Wycombe Swan theatre. The pair soon found that they shared comic interests, formed a double act, and \"decided to be the new Goodies\". After their first performance together at a bar in London in April 1998, Barratt and Fielding developed their zookeeper characters - Howard Moon and Vince Noir, respectively - in a series of sketches for Paramount Comedy\u2019s \"Unnatural Acts\". It was here that they also met Rich Fulcher, who would become Bob Fossil. Fielding\u2019s friend Dave Brown and Fielding's own brother Michael also became regular collaborators.\nThe Boosh soon produced three stage shows - \"The Mighty Boosh\" (1998), \"Arctic Boosh\" (1999) and \"Autoboosh\" (2000) - all of them were at the Edinburgh Fringe. With the success of \"Autoboosh\", a radio series was commissioned by the BBC. Produced by Danny Wallace, \"The Boosh\" was first broadcast in 2001 on BBC London Live, later moving to BBC Radio 4, from which the team were given a half-hour television show of the same name.\nThe first eight-part series, directed by Paul King, was then commissioned for BBC Three and broadcast in 2004, with a second of six episodes the following year. The second series moved away from the zoo setting, and instead Howard, Vince, Naboo the shaman and Bollo the talking ape living in a flat in Dalston. In 2006, the Boosh returned to theatre with \"The Mighty Boosh Live\", which featured a new story entitled \"The Ruby of Kukundu\".\nAfter two years, the Boosh returned to the television in November 2007. Set in Naboo\u2019s second-hand shop below the flat, the third series drew in approximately one million viewers with its first episode, and in light of its success, BBC Three broadcast an entire night of \"The Mighty Boosh\" on March 22, 2008, which included a new documentary and six of Barratt and Fielding's favourite episodes from all three series.\nThere will not be a fourth series till at least 2010 because they will be working upon a movie. This movie has been confirmed by the BBC."}

This is much bigger than a prison farm. A famous penal colony was Devil's Island in French Guiana. The British Empire used its colonies in North America as penal colonies for more than 150 years. The first British settlements in Australia were started as penal colonies.\nCommon Features.\nLife in penal colony was often very hard, sometimes including severe physical punishment. Some prisoners were sentenced for the rest of their natural lives. Many died from hunger, disease, neglect, working too hard, or trying to escape.\nIn the penal colony system, prisoners were sent far away to stop escapes and to make it hard to get home after their prison term finished. Penal colonies were often in unsettled lands, especially places where no else wanted to work or live. The prisoners' unpaid work would help the government develop new areas without spending a lot of money.\nBritish Empire.\nThe British used parts of North America as a penal colony. Convicts would be transported by private companies and sold by auction to plantation owners. About 50,000 British convicts were sent to colonial America. This was about one quarter of British settlers during the 1700s.\nAfter the American Revolution, Britain had to find somewhere else to send its prisoners. They established Sydney, Norfolk Island, Van Diemen's Land and Western Australia as big penal colonies. \nIn colonial India, the British had made various penal colonies. Two of the most infamous ones are on the Andaman islands and Hijli Detention Camp. In the early days of settlement, Singapore was sent Indian convicts. Their job was to clear the jungles for settlement and early public works."}

An ex-convict (or short: ex-con) is a person who has been let out of prison.\nIn past centuries many convicts were send to penal colonies. Many British convicts were sent to the Thirteen Colonies as cheap workers, but that stopped after the War of Independence. After this, convicts were transported to Australia in 1788, the very start of European settlement. They were used as cheap workers. Transportation was stopped in 1868. British convicts were also sent to Canada and India. \nFrance also sent convicts to French Guiana and New Caledonia, and Russia sent them to Siberia."}

The code is named after Richard Hamming who developed it in the 1950s. At the time, Hamming worked with machines that had relays and used punched cards to read the data. Because they were heavily used, the punched cards often had errors, which needed to be corrected by employees.\nHamming codes are used for digital signal processing and telecommunications. Hamming codes are generated according to certain rules. Hamming codes use multiple parity bits. A parity bit tells whether a group of bits is even or odd. In a hamming code, each bit of data is covered by several parity bits. This allows to detect errors, and in certain cases, to correct them as well. A hamming code uses redundancy. If there are three parity bits per code word, the code word must have a length of 7 (formula_1, for k as the number of parity bits). This leaves 4 bits of user data per code word, in the example. Usually, this is written as (N,n), where the first number is the total length of a code word, and the second is the number of bits for user data. The example above is (7,4). \nThe shortest possible Hamming code is (3,1), 2 parity bits are used for one data bit. This code has two valid values \"000\" and \"111\" - The codes \"001\", \"010\" and \"100\" are transmission errors, and will be assigned to the valid code word \"000\". The other possibilities \"011\", \"101\" and \"110\" will be changed to \"111\"."}

The Benelux region has a total population of about 27,562,220 and an area of about 74,640 km\u00b2 (28,819 sq mi).\nHistory.\nThe treaty establishing the Benelux Customs Union was signed on 5 September 1944, by the governments in exile of the three countries in London, and entered into force in 1948. It ceased to exist on 1 November 1960, when it was replaced by the \"Benelux Economic Union\" after a treaty signed in The Hague on 3 February 1958. It was preceded by the (still existent) Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union, established on 25 July 1921. Its founding contributed to the founding of the European Union (EU).\nPolitics.\nA Benelux Parliament (originally referred to as \"Interparliamentary Consultative Council\") was created in 1955. This parliamentary assembly is composed of 21 members of the Dutch parliament, 21 members of the Belgian national and regional parliaments, and 7 members of the Luxembourgish parliament. The treaty establishing the Benelux Economic Union (\"Benelux Economische Unie/Union \u00c9conomique Benelux\") was signed 3 February 1958 and came into force in 1960 to promote the free movement of workers, capital, services, and goods in the region. Its secretariat-general is located in Brussels. \nLaw.\nIn 1965, the treaty establishing a Benelux Court of Justice was signed. It entered into force in 1975. The Court, composed of judges from the highest courts of the three States, has to guarantee the uniform interpretation of common legal rules. This international judicial institution is in Brussels.\nThe Benelux is particularly active in the field of intellectual property. The three countries established a Benelux Trademarks Office and a Benelux Designs Office, both in The Hague. In 2005, they concluded a treaty establishing a Benelux Organisation for Intellectual Property which replaced both offices upon its entry into force on 1 September 2006.\nGeography, demographics and languages.\nDutch and French are the official languages of the Benelux and its institutions. Out of the total of 27.2 million people living in the member states 22.5 million (83 percent) speak Dutch and 3.9 million (14%) speak French, of whom 3.4 million are Walloons and 0.5 million are Luxembourgians (that speak German and Luxembourgish), whereas 3% is bilingual Dutch-French.\nSports.\nIn 2000, Belgium and the Netherlands jointly hosted the UEFA European Championship. In June 2007, representatives of the three countries announced they would be, as a \"single country\", bidding for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\nFuture.\nThe treaty establishing the Benelux Economic Union expired in 2010.

It is a kind of logical argument in which one proposition (the \"conclusion\") is inferred from two or more others (the premises). The idea is an invention of Aristotle.\nIn the \"Prior Analytics\", Aristotle defines the syllogism as \"a discourse in which, certain things having been supposed, something different from the things supposed results of necessity because these things are so\". (24b18\u201320)\nEach proposition must have some form of the verb 'to be' in it. A categorical syllogism is like a little machine built of three parts: the major premise, the minor premise and the conclusion. Each of these parts is a proposition and, from the first two, the \"truth value\" of the third part is decided.\nExamples.\nEach of the three distinct terms represents a category. In the above example, \"men,\" \"mortal,\" and \"Greeks.\" \"Mortal\" is the major term; \"Greeks\", the minor term. The premises also have one term in common with each other, which is known as the \"middle term\"; in this example, \"man.\" Both of the premises are universal, as is the conclusion.\nHere, the major term is \"die\", the minor term is \"men,\" and the middle term is \"mortals\". The major premise is universal; the minor premise and the conclusion are particular. Aristotle studied different syllogisms and identified valid syllogisms as syllogisms with conclusion true if both premises are true. The examples above are valid syllogisms.\nA sorites is a form of argument in which a series of incomplete syllogisms is so arranged that the predicate of each premise forms the subject of the next until the subject of the first is joined with the predicate of the last in the conclusion. For example, if one argues that a given number of grains of sand does not make a heap and that an additional grain does not either, then to conclude that no additional amount of sand will make a heap is to construct a sorites argument.\nLogic today.\nThe syllogism was replaced by first-order logic after the work of Gottlob Frege, published in 1879. This logic is suitable for mathematics, computers, linguistics and other subjects, because it uses numbers (quantified variables) instead of sentences."}

The constellation is normally represented as an eagle.\nAquila is just a few degrees North of the celestial equator. The constellation is best seen in the summer as it is along the Milky Way. Because of this location along the line of our galaxy, many clusters and nebulae are within its borders. However, they are dim and there are not many galaxies.\nHistory.\nAquila was one of the 48 constellations described by the 2nd century astronomer Ptolemy. It had been earlier mentioned by Eudoxus in the 4th century BC and Aratus in the 3rd century BC. It is now one of the 88 constellations defined by the International Astronomical Union.\nThe Greek Aquila is probably based on the Babylonian constellation of the Eagle (MUL.A.MUSHEN), which is in the same area as the Greek constellation.\nNovae.\nTwo major novae have been observed in Aquila. The first one was in 389 BC and was recorded as being as bright as Venus. The other was in 1918 and is known as (Nova Aquilae 1918). It briefly shone brighter than Altair, the brightest star in Aquila.\nDeep-sky objects.\nThree interesting planetary nebulae lie in Aquila:\nIllustrations.\nIn illustrations of Aquila that represent it as an eagle, a nearly straight line of three stars symbolizes part of the wings. The center and brightest of these three stars is Altair. The tips of the wings spread out to the southeast and northwest. The head of the eagle stretches off to the southwest.\nMythology.\nIn mythology, Aquila was owned by the Roman god Jupiter and did many tasks for him.\nIn a book by Gavin White, the Babylonian Eagle carried the constellation called the Dead Man (LU.USH) in its talons. The author also draws a comparison to the Classical stories of Antinous and Ganymede.\nIn classical Greek mythology, Aquila was identified as \u0391\u03b5\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 \u0394\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 (\"Aetos Dios\"). He was the eagle that carried the thunderbolts of Zeus. He was sent by Zeus to carry the shepherd boy Ganymede to Mount Olympus. The constellation of Aquarius is sometimes identified with Ganymede.\nIn the Chinese love story of Qi Xi, Niu Lang (Altair) and his two children (\u03b2 and \u03b3 Aquilae) are separated forever from their wife and mother Zhi Nu (Vega) who is on the far side of the river, the Milky Way.\nIn Hinduism, the constellation Aquila is identified with the half-eagle half-human deity Garuda.\nChinese astronomy.\nIn Chinese astronomy, \u03b6 Aql is within the Heavenly Market Enclosure (\u5929\u5e02\u57a3, \"Ti\u0101n Sh\u00ec Yu\u00e1n\"), and the other stars of the constellation are placed within the Black Tortoise of the North (\u5317\u65b9\u7384\u6b66, \"B\u011bi F\u0101ng Xu\u00e1n W\u01d4\")."}

Its name means Great Bear in Latin. It was named that because many different groups of people around the world have thought that its stars look a lot like a bear with a long tail. It is often used as a symbol for \"north\".\nAccording to Greek mythology, Ursa Major was once the beautiful maiden Callisto, whom the god Zeus had an affair with. In order to protect her and their son, Arcas, from his jealous wife Hera, Zeus turned Callisto and Arcas into bears. He then picked up the bears by their short, stubby tails and threw them into the sky.\nDeep-sky objects.\nSeveral bright galaxies are found in Ursa Major, including the pair Messier 81 (one of the brightest galaxies in the sky) and Messier 82 above the bear's head, and the Pinwheel galaxy (M101), a beautiful spiral galaxy northwest of the star \u03b7 Ursae Majoris. Other well-known spiral galaxies are NGC 4102, NGC 4605, Messier 108 and Messier 109. The constellation has about 50 galaxies that can be seen with a small telescope. The Owl nebula, the brightest planetary nebula, can be found along the bottom of the bowl of the Big Dipper.\nThe Big Dipper.\nThe seven stars in the northeast corner of Ursa Major form an called the Big Dipper (or the Plough in Great Britain). This group has been recognized by almost all groups of people who live or lived in places where it can be seen in the sky and it is one of the best-known star patterns. The Big Dipper is helpful in finding the north star because an imaginary line drawn through the two stars on the right side will point directly at the north star. These two stars are called The Pointers and they are very important on navigation by stars.\nAll of the stars in the Big Dipper except Dubhe and Alkaid are moving toward the same point in the sky through proper motion. This group of stars is known as the Ursa Major Moving Group."}

It is often called the Little Bear or the Little Dipper. Just like the related constellation Ursa Major, or the Big Bear or Big Dipper, it seems to have a long handle leading to a cup or ladle. The end of the handle is the North Star, called Polaris.\nThe ancient astronomer Ptolemy included Ursa Minor in his list of 48 constellations. It is now one of the 88 modern constellations. Ursa Minor is special because it includes the north celestial pole. However, this will change after several hundred years because the Earth will change the direction of its axis. That movement is called precession\nSpecial features.\nStars.\nUrsa Minor is often called the Little Dipper because its seven brightest stars seem to be in the shape of a dipper (ladle or scoop). The star at the end of the dipper handle is Polaris, the North Star.\nPolaris is the brightest star in the constellation. It is a 'yellow-white' supergiant shining at 2.02 apparent magnitude. It belongs to an unusual class of stars called Cepheid variables. The brightness of Polaris can change. The second brightest star is \u03b2 UMi (Kochab). It is a 2.08 orange giant star.\nThe four stars in the \"bowl\" of the little dipper are very useful for star watchers. They are of second, third, fourth and fifth magnitude. These stars are an easy guide to knowing what magnitude stars are visible. This is helpful for people who live in cities where light can make dim stars hard to see. It is also a way of testing your eyesight.\nDeep sky objects.\nThere is one dwarf galaxy in the area of the constellation. It is called Ursa Minor Dwarf.\nHistory and mythology.\nDrawings of Ursa Minor often show it as a baby bear with an unusually long tail. In some stories, the tail is so long because the baby bear was held by the tail and spun around the pole.\nGreek mythology connected Ursa Minor and Ursa Major to the story of Callisto and Arcas. However, one older version of the story has Bo\u00f6tes in place of Arcas. In that story Ursa Minor was a dog. This earlier tradition explains both the length of the tail and an older name for Polaris. The North Star used to be called \"Cynosura\" which means the dog's tail.\nIn another story from early Greek mythology, the seven stars of the Little Dipper were seven sisters. They were Atlas' daughters, the Hesperides. They were part of a story with the nearby constellations Bo\u00f6tes, Ursa Major, and Draco."}

It is almost straight above Earth's North Pole. Because of this, when it is seen from Earth, it looks like it always stays in the same place in the sky. For centuries, sailors in the northern hemisphere used Polaris to help them figure out where they were on the ocean and what way they were moving.\nPolaris is part of a triple star system. It has a very close dwarf binary, and a larger star, Polaris B, which orbits 2,400 AU away.\nThe main star, Polaris A, is a giant with 4.5 times the mass of the Sun and a diameter of 45 million kilometers. It is a classic Cepheid variable, the closest to us in the whole Milky Way. Polaris B can be seen even with a modest telescope. It was found by William Herschel in 1780 using one of the most powerful telescopes of the time: his own reflecting telescope. The nearby dwarf star, Ab, was predicted in 1929, but only seen quite recently. The dwarf orbits as close to A as Uranus is to our sun.\nEven though Polaris is the North Star today, this has not always been the case. The place in the sky that the Earth's north pole points at changes slowly over time. This movement is called stellar precession. In 3000 BC, a faint star called Thuban in the constellation of Draco was the North Star. Polaris did not become the North Star until about AD 500. It will get closer to straight above the Earth's north pole until sometime in 2102. Then it will move away again. It will be the closest star to the pole until about AD 3000.\nSurprisingly, considering its relative nearness, its distance is not yet known for certain. Many recent papers calculate the distance to Polaris at about 434 light-years (133 parsecs). However, some suggest it may be as much as 30% closer. If correct, this would be especially notable because Polaris is the closest Cepheid variable to Earth. Its physical parameters are critical to the whole astronomical distance scale.\nThere is no star in the southern hemisphere which plays a similar role to Polaris."}

It is a closed, compact, convex figure whose 1-skeleton consists of groups of opposite parallel line segments aligned in each of the space's dimensions, perpendicular to each other and of the same length. A unit hypercube's longest diagonal in \"n\" dimension is equal to formula_1.\nAn \"n\"-dimensional hypercube is also called an n\"-cube or an n\"-dimensional cube. The term \"measure polytope\" is also used, notably in the work of H. S. M. Coxeter (originally from Elte, 1912), but it has now been superseded.\nThe hypercube is the special case of a hyperrectangle (also called an \"n-orthotope\").\nA unit hypercube is a hypercube whose side has length one unit. Often, the hypercube whose corners (or \"vertices\") are the 2\"n\" points in R\"n\" with each coordinate equal to 0 or 1 is called \"the\" unit hypercube.\nConstruction.\nA hypercube can be defined by increasing the numbers of dimensions of a shape:\nThis can be generalized to any number of dimensions. This process of sweeping out volumes can be formalized mathematically as a Minkowski sum: the \"d\"-dimensional hypercube is the Minkowski sum of \"d\" mutually perpendicular unit-length line segments, and is therefore an example of a zonotope.\nThe 1-skeleton of a hypercube is a hypercube graph."}

B. White. It was made into an animated musical movie by Hanna Barbera Productions and Sagittarius Productions in 1973. The movie, sent to theaters by Paramount Pictures on March 1, 1973, is the first of only three Hanna Barbera movies not based upon one of their famous television cartoons. The song score of music and lyrics was written by the Sherman Brothers.\nThe movie has stayed popular over the years because of television and VHS; in 1994 the movie became one of the best selling movies of the year, 21 years after its first premiere. No other non-Disney musical animated movie has become so popular again later. This new popularity helped to create a direct-to-video sequel, \"\", which Paramount released in the US on March 18, 2003 (Universal released the movie internationally), followed by a live-action movie version of E. B. White's original story, which was released on December 15, 2006. The movie was presented by Pulitzer Prize in 1985, the year in which author E. B. White died. E. B. White himself wrote about it.\nThe story.\nA litter of 11 piglets are born to a mother pig on a farm owned by the Arable family. The 11th of the 11 baby pigs, named Wilbur, is a very small and the mother pig can't feed him. So John Arable decides to \"do away\" with Wilbur. However, when his daughter, Fern Arable, hears of the pig's fate she rescues him and tells her father it is unfair to kill Wilbur since he is smaller than the others. John agrees and Fern is allowed to keep the little piglet as a pet. Fern and Wilbur loved each other. Fern takes Wilbur around in a baby carriage and gives him a bath. However, after only six weeks of raising him, John Arable tells Fern that it is time for him to be sold. Wilbur was no longer a baby piglet but a full grown boar. Fern sadly says good-bye as Wilbur is sold down the street to her uncle, Homer Zuckerman. When Wilbur wants to play with a lamb, the lamb's father says that sheep do not play with pigs because it is only a matter of time before they are turned into smoked bacon and ham. Wilbur starts crying saying that he does not want to die, but a voice from above tells him to \"chin up\". Wilbur goes to sleep feeling better.\nThe next day the voice sings a song about \"chinning up\", and reveals herself to be a spider named Charlotte. Charlotte saves Wilbur by writing messages in her web, which is why the movie is called \"Charlotte's Web.\" She starts to write messages in her web, calling him \"terrific\" and \"some pig.\" The messages get a lot of attention from the media and other neighbors to the fair. Wilbur is such a media hit that this convinces the Arables, Zuckermans and Fussys to keep him and not kill him. Charlotte eventually lays her eggs and dies. When the baby spiders are born (514), most of them leave. Three of them stay, and for a number of years a few of Charlotte's kids stay around the farm and keep Wilbur company. But as much as Wilbur loves them, they will never replace the memory of his friend Charlotte.\nRelease.\nThe movie was released to theaters on March 1, 1973 by Paramount Pictures in the United States. It was released on February 22, 1973 in New York City in less theaters, and also released in West Germany on March 30, 1973, as well as August 11 in Sweden, and August 25 in Japan.\nReception.\nCritical reception.\nRotten Tomatoes says that the movie has a 74% \"fresh\" rating based on 19 reviews, with a score of 6.6. The RT community gave the movie an 86% approval rating, with a score of 7/10.\nCraig Butler of All-Movie Guide criticized the animation and the musical score, but said it was close to the book. He said that, \u201cno attempt has been made to soften the existential sadness at the story's core\u201d (no one tried to soften the major sad parts of the story, like when Charlotte dies at the end). Dan Jardine criticized the songs and the \u201cSaturday morning cartoon quality\u201d of the animation, but also says that Hamner kept just enough of White\u2019s prose to keep the movie from being only an experiment that did not work out. Christopher Null of Filmcritic.com said that the animation is sometimes \u201cdownright bad, but E. B. White's classic fable needs little to make it come to life\u201d. He later went on to say that the movie is \u201ca must-own for anyone with children, and a must-see for everyone else.\u201d He rated it four out of five stars. When it was reissued on DVD the movie was awarded an Oppenheim Toy Portfolio Gold Award.\nE.B. White's Reaction.\nAccording to Gene Deitch, a director of animation and friend of E. B. White, the author's wife wrote the following words in a 1977 letter: \"We have never ceased to regret that your version of \"Charlotte's Web\" never got made. The Hanna-Barberra version has never pleased either of us... a travesty...\" E.B. White himself wrote of the film: \"The story is interrupted every few minutes so that somebody can sing a jolly song. I do not care much for jolly songs. The Blue Hill Fair, which I tried to report faithfully in the book, has become a Disney World, with 76 trombones. But that's what you get for getting embroiled in Hollywood.\"\nSongs.\n\"Chin Up\" is sung by Charlotte the spider when she first meets Wilbur the pig in the barnyard. She convinces him to look on the bright side.\n\"I Can Talk!\" is sung by Wilbur the pig who had previously been unable to utter words. The Goose realizes as she is sitting on her eggs that her new neighbor in the pen beside her, Wilbur the pig, has not been eating his food, and that he seems to be sad. She offers him an ear if he will come over to her and talk since she cannot get off of her eggs. But soon she realizes that Wilbur cannot talk. She encourages him to try... And with a couple grunts, and a \"Wa... Wa... Wa\" \"Wi... Wi... Will...bur.. WILBUR!\" Suddenly, with the Goose's help, Wilbur realizes he can talk and say all the things he wants. Wilbur sings a song about his new talking skills, while waking up some of the other farm animals with his excitement.\n\"A Veritable Smorgasbord\" is introduced and sung in the story by the Goose, sung again by the Goose and Templeton. It is sung another time, this time at a \"double time\" tempo sung solo by Templeton.\n\"Zuckerman's Famous Pig\" is the title given to Wilbur the pig hero which saves him from being killed in the story, and the theme of the finale song in the movie. The song was composed and arranged in a barbershop quartet style by the Sherman Brothers, in keeping with the time and place of the story. It was covered by the Brady Kids and was chosen for release on their first single taken from \"The Brady Bunch Phonographic Album\" by producer Jackie Mills.\n\"We've Got Lots in Common\" is sung by Wilbur to the new gosling (baby goose), Jeffery, who, like Wilbur, is a runt. Wilbur passes on one of the lessons which Charlotte has taught him. The other barnyard animals sing along as well. In the advertisement for suppliers of the movie, a rare piece of footage of the Sherman Brothers singing \"We've Got Lots In Common\" can be seen. In this part, Richard Sherman plays piano while Robert Sherman stands over his brother's shoulder and sings along. The song was filmed in an unnamed recording studio in Los Angeles in 1972.\n\"Mother Earth and Father Time\" is introduced in the story by Charlotte and sang a second time in the movie as Charlotte is dying. According to \"The Annotated Charlotte's Web\" by Peter F. Neumeyer, some fans of the book are not in favor of the song's placement in the movie because it ruins E. B. White's strong words from the book, \"...And she didn't move again.\" which many people find extremely moving. The Sherman Brothers' father, songwriter Al Sherman, believed the \"Charlotte's Web\" song score, and \"Mother Earth and Father Time\" in particular, to be the brothers' finest work. The lyric addresses the idea of thinking about one's life. In the storyline the song is sung by Charlotte at the end of her life. Ironically, Al Sherman died shortly after the movie was released.\n\"There Must Be Something More\" is introduced in the story when Fern is learning about love from a little runt she saved from an \"untimely death\", when her father was about to \"do away with it\". Fern found it to be an injustice, and relates herself, saying to her father if she had been small, would he have killed her too? Her father gives in and lets her raise the pig she names Wilbur. Fern learns about love and life through Wilbur, and sings a song to tell Wilbur just how much she loves him. The song goes through the first two weeks of Wilbur's life with Fern. The song is sung by Fern to a baby Wilbur in a motherly way. The song is then sang again briefly by Wilbur when Fern gets a bit older begins to show an interest in young \"Henry Fussy\". Suddenly Wilbur is no longer so important in Fern's life. Charlotte explains to Wilbur that this is the nature of the world.\n\"Charlotte's Web\" is the title song of the movie. In the movie the song is sung back-to-back with \"Deep in the Dark\". The title song was covered by The Brady Bunch among others. In the movie, Charlotte tells Wilbur to go to sleep, and she would see him in the morning, and she sings a song called \"Deep In the Dark\" to put the barnyard to sleep.\nThe title song was covered (when an artist sings a song that is not their own) by The Brady Bunch among others: \"The Brady Bunch Phonographic Album\" features three Sherman Brothers songs including \"River Song\" from \"Tom Sawyer\", \"Zuckerman's Famous Pig\" and \"Charlotte's Web\". Their cover of the song is also featured on their \"Greatest hits\" album \"It's a Sunshine Day: The Best of The Brady Bunch\"."}

The remainder of the calculation is appended onto and sent with the computer recalculates the remainder. If it does not match the transmitted remainder, an error is detected. At this point, the data is re-sent. Ethernet packets have a (CRC) code. \nFor example: \nIf 'm' is your message of 16 bits, and you are calculating a CRC of 8 bits (CRC-8), then let 'x' be message 'm' appended by 7 zeroes. Let 'y' be a \"\" number. Divide 'x' by 'y', until you obtain a remainder that is not divisible further. Take this remainder and subtract it from the \"magic\" number 'y' and add this result to 'x' to obtain 'z'. 'z' is now a multiple of the \"magic\" number 'y' and dividing 'z' by 'y' will give a zero remainder. 'z' can now be transmitted to the receiver. The receiver will perform this division and check if the remainder is zero to confirm that there were no errors in transmission. The message can be recovered by simply reading the most significant 16 bits in the 24 bit transmission. \nIn real world systems, these long division operations are performed in hardware by bit-shifting and XORing, a feat which is trivial for digital electronics to perform at extremely high speeds.

He was struck by Zeus with a flash of lightning, in the fight of the Titans, and thrown into Tartarus but he was not killed. (Hes.

Hesiod also describes him as \"hybristes\", a violent, overbearing and insolent man. Menoitios and his brothers, the sons of Iapetos, were all depicted with extreme human foibles: Prometheus was overly crafty, Epimetheus a fool, and Atlas exceedingly daring.\nMenoitios was perhaps identical to Menoites the herdsman of Hades, whom Herakles wrestled with in the underworld.

Their mother language is Pashto, but many of them also speak neighboring Urdu, Hindko and Dari languages. They are the original or native people of the area south of the Hindu Kush in Afghanistan and west of the Indus River in Pakistan. However, in the modern period, they have spread to cities outside their native land. According to researchers, the total population of the group is estimated to be around 50 million.\nOrigins.\nMany Pashtuns believe that their ancestors were ancient Hebrews who arrived to what is now Afghanistan over 2,000 years ago and settled there. They were first mentioned by a Greek historian in 500 BC, then by Alexander the Great, and in the 3rd century they are called \"Abgans\" (\"Afghans\") by the Persian rulers. In the army of the Ghaznavids and Ghurids, thousands of Afghans were reported to be serving. They ruled Delhi Sultanate in the past and also Persia between 1725 to 1729 until they established the last Afghan empire that became what is now Afghanistan.\nTribal code.\nThe Pashtun people follow a strict code of honor, known as \"Pakhtunwali\", that requires them to support the poor, the weak, and the challenged; to fight evil; to provide shelter to anyone who needs it and many more. Pashtun are also strict with obedience in their families and society. They are also known as the best at welcoming guests and taking good care of them. They really love to see respectful people in society, with great manners and obedience.\nOccupations.\nThe Pashtuns are mostly farmers, herdsmen, and warriors but many of them are also businessmen and politicians. Most tribesmen are sedentary farmers, combining cultivation with animal husbandry; some are migratory herdsmen and caravaners. Large numbers of them have always been attracted to military service.\nPopulations in Afghanistan.\nIn Afghanistan, Pashtun make up around 50% of the total population. They form about 60 tribes of different size and importance, each of which occupies a different territory. In Afghanistan, where Pashtun are the major ethnic group, the main tribes are the Durrani, who mostly live in the south and west, and the Ghilzai, who live in northern and eastern parts of the country.\nPopulations in Pakistan.\nThey are over 15% of Pakistan's population, with Peshawar and Quetta being their principal cities. They predominate north of Quetta between the Sulaiman Range and the Indus River. Significant number of Pashtuns also live in most other major Pakistani cities, particularly Karachi, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, and Lahore. In the hill areas the main tribes are, from south to north: the Tarin, Kaka\u1e5b, Sherani, and Ustarana south of the Gumal River; the Ma\u1e25sud, Darwesh Khel, Waziri, and Bi\u1e6dani between the Gumal River and Thal; the Turi, Bangash, Orakzay, Afridi, and Shinwari from Thal to the Khyber Pass; and the Mahmand, Utman Khel, Tarklani, and Yusufzay to the north and northeast of the Khyber."}

The name of the conflict may be derived from a pun on the term \"Cold War\" (with \"cod\" reading so similarly to \"cold\"), possibly via the British tabloid press.\nIn 1972, Iceland unilaterally declared an Exclusive Economic Zone extending beyond its territorial waters, before announcing plans to reduce over-fishing. It policed its quota system with the coast guard, leading to a series of net-cutting incidents with British trawlers that fished the areas. As a result, a fleet of British Royal Naval warships and tug-boats was employed to act as a deterrent against any future harassment of British fishing crews by the Icelandic craft.\nIn 1976, a compromise between the two states allowed a maximum of 24 British trawlers access to the disputed 200 nautical mile (370\u00a0km) limit. Two-hundred-nautical-mile Exclusive Economic Zones became recognized internationally on November 14, 1994, after having been agreed at the conference on the Third United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) in 1982."}

It is supposed to look like the warrior Orion from Greek mythology. The constellation has other names in different cultures: it is mentioned under a Hebrew name in the Book of Job.\nThe constellation has a clear hour-glass shape with \"Orion's Belt\" in the centre. That part is made up of three bright stars (Alnitak, Alnilam, Mintaka) in line. The Orion constellation has 81 visible stars, including some of the brightest and most important stars in the night sky. Rigel is the brightest star in it, and Betelgeuse is a huge, rather unstable red supergiant. \nThe constellation includes a series of starburst nebulae where new stars are forming. The whole group of nebulae is known as the Orion complex. The complex is 1,500 to 1,600 light-years away, and hundreds of light-years across. It includes\nMythological legend.\nIn Greek mythology, Orion was a great hunter who joined Artemis's Hunt. He was the first ever male to ever enter the Hunt. Inevitably, he slowly started getting closer to Artemis, and eventually fell in love with her, even though he knew she had sworn an oath of maidenhood. Artemis did not sense this at the time, so she let him stay in the Hunt. The problem was that Orion was too good a hunter, and got in over his head. He killed too many animals, which was against the Hunters' nature, which was not to harm nature if it was not of danger to them. Gaea, the Earth Spirit, sensed this, and sent a giant scorpion to kill him, to punish him for his sins against nature. Artemis mourned his death, and herself made a constellation dedicated him, namely, the Orion's Belt.\nThe ancient Egyptians equated the constellation with Osiris, god of the afterlife. The ancient Egyptian \"First Time\", \"when Osiris walked on the Earth\", has by some fringe archeologists been held to be around 10,500 BC; thanks to precession (which was known to the astronomers of the Early Dynasties), around that time at the Spring Equinox the constellation could be seen \"walking\" on the horizon just before dawn.\nLocation.\nOrion can be used to find the constellations Gemini, Auriga, and Canis Major. Find the belt, and you will find gemini to the northeast, auriga to the north, and ganis minor to the southwest. The Orion Belt is an asterism of 3 stars, all in a straight line. You could find it by finding a very bright red star (Betelgeuse)."}

But once every thousand years, he spreads his wings and sings over a large mass of firewood, and when he is overjoyed by his song, he kindles a fire in his beak, and when it burns in the fire, an egg emerges from it, which immediately catches fire and burns. Another phoenix is \u200b\u200bborn from its ashes. Phoenix is \u200b\u200bconsidered a symbol of immortality and longevity in most cultures. But some cultures have attributed other characteristics to him. The story goes that the bird lives for several hundred years before it dies by setting itself on fire. However, it then starts a new life from the ashes of the fire.\nIn European culture.\nIn English culture, the Phoenix phoenix is \u200b\u200ba mythical bird, very beautiful and unique in its kind, which, according to legend, lives in the western desert for 500 or 600 years, burns itself on a pile of debris, and from the resulting ashes, he himself once again. He emerges with a youthful freshness and begins and passes another round of life. Phoenix in European culture is often an allegory of immortality and eternal life. Phoenix originally entered European culture from ancient Iran. During the eight centuries BC, the Phoenix bird is mentioned in nine references, eight of which have come down to us through quotations from later authors, and only one case by Herodotus, a Greek historian from 484 to 424 BC, is preserved in full. remained. Another Greek, Claudius Aelianus, also known as Aelian, wrote about Phoenix 200 AD: \"Phoenix keeps the arithmetic of 500 years correct without the help of arithmetic or finger counting, because he learns everything from nature, which is the whole intellect. Although it seems necessary to know about Phoenix, among the Egyptians - perhaps only a handful of priests - no one knows when 500 years will pass, but at least we need to know where Egypt is and Heliopolis where Phoenix is. \"Where is it and what kind of coffin does this bird put its father in and where does it bury it?\" According to the English text, this historian calls Phoenix's father a father, but calls Phoenix the neutral form (it). Subsequent authors have often used the feminine form for Phoenix, but since this bird is a unique myth and its offspring did not derive from mating, the discussion of its sex did not seem to be very important. A Roman historian named Publius Ovidius Naso, better known as Ovid, is the first Roman to write about Phoenix in Latin. \"How many creatures walk on earth today, but in the beginning they were different. There is only one being that will remain forever as it was from the beginning, that is, it will remain unchanged for many years, and finally, after extinction, it will be born again in its original form. This is a bird that the Assyrians, or in some sources probably the Syrians or the Phoenicians, call the phoenix. This bird does not eat ordinary seeds and grass, but eats fruit extracts and rare spices. When he is 500 years old, he builds a nest on a tall palm tree and with his fork makes a bed for himself from the finest materials, from tree bark to cinnamon and other spices and gums, and then he dies and his soul travels far away with fragrant smoke and steam, and the story It goes on to say that a small phoenix then rises from the chest of his lifeless body to live, as they say, another 500 years, and at that time, after his old age, he found the necessary courage to raise his throne and nests where his father is buried. A tall palm tree sets in motion and begins its journey to the city of the sun, where the Phoenix Nest Temple shines brightly in the Temple of the Sun. \u201d From all that has been said about the phoenix in European culture, two general accounts of the phoenix can be given: First, Phoenix arises from his father's lifeless body and takes his father's body to the city of Heliopolis and burns it on the altar of the Temple of the Sun; And another narration is that the phoenix burns in a pile of fragrant wood and debris, flutters its wings and ignites a flame, burns itself in the fire, and from its ashes another phoenix is \u200b\u200bborn. So, in a nutshell, this myth can be said in European culture: \"The phoenix burns in the fire and is born again from its ashes.\" In this regard, it is common in English to say, \"Every fire may contain a phoenix.\nIn ancient Egypt.\nDuring the first century AD, Phoenix was mentioned 21 times by ten authors. From all these sources it appears that the myth of Phoenix originated in ancient Egyptian civilization and was later spoken of in Greek, Roman and Christian civilizations, respectively. Among the Egyptians, the myth of Phoenix was originally the myth of the sun rising again at dawn after each night, and the name of the city of Heliopolis in Herodotus must have been related to this. The Egyptians consider the phoenix a sacred bird, which is very rare. According to the people of Heliopolis, the phoenix appears in Egypt once every 500 years after the death of the previous phoenix. There are only a few pictures of this bird, and as can be seen from its shape and size in these pictures, the wings and jump are red and yellow are golden, and its general size is like an eagle. A strange story is told about the work of this bird, and that is that this bird brings its father's body, which is covered with a kind of fragrant plant gum, all the way from the Arab land to the Temple of the Sun and buries it there. It is said that in order to bring a corpse, first it makes a gum large enough to carry it, then it empties it and puts the corpse in it and closes its mouth with fresh gum, and then the bullet, which is correct. It has regained its original weight, is brought to Egypt, and while the entire surface of the bullet is covered with gum, it is placed inside the Temple of the Sun, as mentioned.\nIn \nIn Persian mythology.\nPersian mythology, the phoenix means swan, a counterpart to the Indo-European and Chinese word phoenix, and appears to be the result of an arrangement of a pheasant, a Chinese chicken, and a mixture with other mythical birds. In Persian narrations, like in Indo-European narrations, this hen is a rare and lonely hen that is not a mate and as a result, she will not give birth. Phoenix lives a thousand years, and when his life comes to an end, he produces a large pile of firewood, and when he sits on that pile, he sings so much that he rejoices in his song, and by breaking his wings and with the help of his beak, he kindles a fire, and burns in the door. Fire produces a testicle (egg) from him and thus another phoenix is \u200b\u200bborn. In this narrative, Phoenix is \u200b\u200bthe swan counterpart in European literature who ends his life by singing. Basically, in Persian literature, as in Indo-European literature, burning in one's suffering and rising from one's ashes and being born again have their way into the myth of Phoenix.\nIn Chinese mythological culture, the phoenix is \u200b\u200bknown as Feng Huang or the red bird, which is a genus of fire and is a symbol of summer and the south, which causes drought. For this reason, Phoenix contains the negative and material element of the world, namely yin, and is considered the symbol of the queen. In front of the phoenix is \u200b\u200bthe dragon, which is always considered to be the representative of Khaqan in Chinese mythology. According to Chinese tradition, the phoenix flies less to the surface of the earth, and when it does, all the birds gather around it. According to Koyaji about Phoenix, he does not sit on the ground, but whenever he sits on the ground, he dances on one foot. Some have suggested that the Chinese phoenix is \u200b\u200bthe counterpart of Shang Shang or the rainbird in the Confucian version, while the Shang Shang or rainbird is the bird that symbolizes the yin, but the phoenix is \u200b\u200bcommonly considered the symbol of the yang. Phoenix in Chinese mythology is a symbol of joy and happiness and a sign of heavenly satisfaction. In these myths, the dragon is the spirit of the rain and the symbol of Khaqan, and the phoenix is \u200b\u200bthe symbol of the queen and the south and the helper of the farmers. \nIn Chinese mythology.\nIn Chinese mythology, the red bird or phoenix was a symbol of the south and was worshiped. Phoenix later replaced the pheasant. In the surviving maps, this bird had a curved beak, a long, sharp claw in the shape of a bird of prey, and was considered a help to farmers on the arid farms of the south. There is another phoenix in Chinese mythology called Qi Sang or Phoenix of the Mountains. This phoenix is \u200b\u200bthe phoenix that provided the map of rivers to Yu in the time of the Athenian dynasty.\nTHE feng, or phoenix, is the legendary king of all avian species according to Chinese myth.\n\u201cA Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix\u201d is one of the most popular themes in traditional Chinese painting. This is also the name of a traditional Chinese music piece featuring complicated suona playing skills.\nAccording to Chinese legend, the phoenix was originally an inconspicuous bird with a plain appearance. Unlike most birds that busied themselves with playing around, he collected fruit and seeds in his den from dawn to dust. Unable to understand his behavior, other birds mocked him for being greedy.\nLater, an unexpected draught left many birds without anything to eat. The phoenix opened his den, and shared his food with the other birds, saving their lives.\nWhen the rain finally returned, bringing life back to the forest, the birds wanted to show their gratitude to the phoenix. Each bird pulled out one of their most beautiful feathers, and together they made the feathers into a dazzling garment. They presented the garment to the phoenix, and crowned him as their king.\nHence, each year, all birds will fly to the phoenix on one particular day, and pay their respects to the king. This image has inspired countless artists.\nThough the phoenix is often called fenghuang today, the words feng and huang originally referred to a pair of colorful birds. Feng is a male bird and huang is female. However, just as the Chinese dragon was used as a symbol for the emperor in the royal court, the phoenix, with its beautiful appearance, was selected to symbolize the empress. The empress\u2019s crown at formal events was usually called the \u201cphoenix crown,\u201d while her dress was called the \u201cphoenix dress.\u201d Both crowns and dresses were decorated with many phoenix images.\nThus, the phoenix and dragon became \u201cgolden partners,\u201d and they often appear together in phrases with positive connotations. \u201cProsperity brought by the dragon and the phoenix\u201d (long feng cheng xiang) is widely used as an expression of luck. \u201cThe talent of the dragon and the presence of the phoenix\u201d (long zhang feng zi) is an expression used to describe the elegance of a person. \u201cThe dragon flies and phoenix rises\u201d (long fei feng qi) refers to when an emperor or a saint appears. \u201cDragon\u2019s heart and phoenix\u2019s liver\u201d (long xin feng gan) refer to a precious and rare dishes. \u201cClimb the dragon and attach to the phoenix\u201d (pan long fu feng) means to flatter the powerful for one\u2019s own benefit.\nAnd phoenix\u2019s powers are also to some extent complimentary to the dragon\u2019s. While the Chinese dragon can summon wind and call for rain, the phoenix is capable of manipulating fire.\nHowever, the phoenix in Chinese myth did not have the ability of rising from the ashes until contemporary litterateur Guo Moruo used the concept of the Western phoenix in his poetry.\nPhoenix in Literature.\nPhoenix Short Story by Sylvia Town Sand Warner Edited In the book Phoenix by Sylvia Townsend, Warner Phoenix depicts a mythical creature as a reality and symbolizes the identity and existence of a nation, which is a toy of the lusts and desires of profiteers.

He pockets well, but after a while, when he sees that the phoenix in the cage and captivity is not attractive to the people and does not attract the attention of the people, he decides to make a humble and ridiculous creature out of this magnificent bird in order to be interesting to the people. Reach. He constantly torments this bird, but finally, after enduring a lot of hardship and oppression, Phoenix rises like a nation under oppression and tyranny, burns all those who caused his suffering in his fire, and is born again free. . In part of the story we read: \u00a0\"The other birds were taken to his cage. Inherently fierce and warlike birds. They beheaded Phoenix and harassed him; But Phoenix was so sociable and kind that other birds gave up on him after a day or two of hostility. Mr. Paldero then used stray cats. They could no longer leave the field with good manners. But Phoenix flew quickly over their heads and fluttered his golden wings in their faces, frightening them. The phoenix was transferred to a small cage with a sprinkler on the roof. The sprinkler was turned on every night, and Phoenix coughed. Mr. Paldero had another idea in mind. Every day he stood in front of the phoenix cage, mocking and ridiculing it, and abusing it. When spring came, Mr. Paldero was thinking of starting a public campaign about the declining phoenix. \"Phoenix, which has long been popular, is declining,\" he said. Then, a few days later, Mr. Paldero put the stinking phoenix reaction in the cage to put the stinking straw bundles and some rusty barbed wire in the cage to see if he was still inclined to nest. One day Phoenix began to wander in the straw and grass. Mr. Paldero signed a contract for the filming rights. Finally the promised day arrived. It had been a few weeks since people became more and more interested in Phoenix, and the right to enter had reached five shillings. All around the fence was a roaring crowd. Lights and cameras were aimed at the cage, and a speaker through the loudspeaker seldom reminded the audience of what was happening. \"Phoenix is \u200b\u200bthe aristocrat of the bird world,\" the speaker said. \"Only the rarest and most precious specimens of Oriental wood, impregnated with perfume, can seduce Phoenix to establish its legendary love nest.\" At this moment, clean bundles of fragrant sticks and wood chips were thrown into the cage. The speaker continued from the speaker: \"Phoenix, like Cleopatra, is capricious, and like a magnificent charm, like the native music of intoxicated gypsies. \"All the splendor of the ancient East, its eternal magic, and its skillful tyranny.\" A woman in the crowd shouted, \"Look, she wants to set herself on fire.\" Trembling fell on the phoenix horns. He turned his head from side to side. He came down and walked back and forth from his seat. He moved the chips and sticks with fatigue and exhaustion. The cameras started working and light shone on Phoenix from all sides. \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" said Mr. Paldero, running to the speaker. This is an exciting moment that the world is waiting for with its soul trapped in its chest. The legend of centuries ago is unfolding before our eyes today. The phoenix sat on a pile of wood that burned like a fire, as if asleep. \"If that was the whole story, write down the educational film,\" said the film's director. At that moment, Phoenix and his nest suddenly ignited. The sparks rose up and spread to all sides. \"In a minute or two, everything turned to ashes, and several thousand people, including Mr. Paldero, died in the fire.\"\nIn Persian Literature.\nIn ancient Persian poetry, only Attar Neyshabouri mentions Phoenix in his poems. He also considered the phoenix as other mortal beings and emphasized the pervasiveness of the phenomenon of death.\u00a0In the logic of Attar al-Tair, the phoenix is \u200b\u200bthe heart of the bird of your heart, which is its refuge in India. He is a bird that has about a hundred holes in his beak and he is not a pair; According to the narration, the phoenix sits in the heights and when the wind blows on his beak, a pleasant melody appears and other birds gather around him with this song and become intoxicated and hunted by him.\u00a0In his poems, Attar Neyshabouri mentions the phoenix as a bird that has 360 holes on its tip and a pleasant melody comes out of each hole. He knows the origin of the phoenix in India.\nReferences.\nJohn. Russell. Heinels (2006), Understanding Persian Mythology\nAnthony Christie ,Chinese Mythology\nPhoenix. Encyclopedia Britannica, n.d.

Before the launching of the Hipparcos satellite telescope, distance estimates for the star varied widely, from 96 light years to 1200 light years. Hipparcos established Canopus as lying 310 light years (96 parsecs) from our solar system. \nThe difficulty in measuring Canopus' distance stemmed from its being a \"less luminous supergiant\". Such stars are rare and poorly understood. They are stars that can be either in the process of evolving to or away from red giant status. This in turn made it difficult to know how intrinsically bright Canopus is, and therefore how far away it might be. Direct measurement was the only way to solve the problem. Canopus is too far away for Earth-based parallax observations to be made, so the star's distance was not known with certainty until the early 1990s.\nCanopus is 13,600 times more luminous than the Sun and the most intrinsically bright star within about 700 light years. In fact, from 1 astronomical unit, Canopus would have an apparent magnitude of -37. Canopus appears less bright than Sirius in our sky only because Sirius is much closer to the Earth (8.6 light years).\nThe surface temperature of Canopus is 7350 \u00b1 30 K. Its diameter has been measured at 0.6 astronomical units (the measured angular diameter being 0.006 arcseconds), 65 times that of the Sun. If it were placed at the centre of the solar system, it would extend three-quarters of the way to Mercury. An Earth-like planet would have to lie three times the distance of Pluto for its star to appear the same size in the sky as our own sun. Canopus is a strong source of X-rays, which are probably produced by its corona, magnetically heated to around 15 million K.\nCanopus is part of the Scorpius-Centaurus Association, a group of stars which share similar origins."}

Cushites include people like Afars, Oromos, and Sidama. Some people said that its a good idea for Cushites to help each other with making money and politics. This aim is sometimes called \"Pan-Hornism\".\nBorders.\nThere are four countries in the Horn of Africa. They are Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia and Djibouti. The northernmost areas of the Horn are Ras Kasar in the west, settled by the Rashaida tribe, and Alula in the east, settled by Dishiishe. The easternmost area is Ras Hafun, settled by Leelkase, and the southernmost in Ras Kamboni, settled by Dhulbahante.\nNortheast Africa.\nNortheast Africa, or Northeastern Africa or Northern East Africa as it was known in the past, is a geographic regional term used to refer to the countries of Africa in and around the Red Sea. The region is between North Africa and East Africa, and mainly encompasses the Horn of Africa (Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia, Djibouti) and the Sudans (Sudan and South Sudan) as well as Egypt. Sometimes, its borders are stretched to either include Kenya, or Chad and Libya. Humans have lived in the area for a long time. Many fossil from the early hominids to modern human have been found here. It is one of the most genetically and linguistically diverse regions of the world, being the home to many civilizations and located on an important trade route that connects multiple continents.\nHistory.\nThe Horn of Africa became famous for taking longer to be colonized than other African countries. Those countries which fought back were Ethiopia, led by Menelik II, and the Daraawiish State, led by Ismail Mire. Eritrea was part of Ethiopia, but fought the Eritrean War of Independence from 1961 to 1991.\nNumbers.\nHorn of Africa can also mean the greater region containing the countries of Eritrea, Djibouti, Ethiopia and Somalia. The greater region covers about 2,000,000\u00a0km2 (or 772,200 square miles) and is inhabited by about 94.2 million people (Ethiopia: 79\u00a0million, Somalia: 10\u00a0million, Eritrea: 4.5\u00a0million, and Djibouti: 0.7\u00a0million).\nGenetics.\nUniparental lineages.\nCushitic ethnic groups have a diverse set of uniparental lineages. Nevertheless, certain commonalities can be observed.\nPaternally, E-M35 (also known as E1b1b1, formerly E3b1) forms an important lineage in many Cushitic populations, other important paternal lineages in Cushitic populations include J-M267 (also known as J1), A-M13 (A1b1b2b, formerly A3b2), and T-M70 (T1a, formerly K2).\nMany Cushitic populations can be paternally traced back to having ethnic origins in the Nile Valley (Egypt and Northern Sudan) through haplogroup E-M78 and the Red Sea region of the Horn of Africa through haplogroup E-V1515 This coincides with anthropological and linguistic hypotheses placing the ethnogensis of the Cushitic language family in the aforementioned regions.\nMaternally, Cushitic populations are more diverse, yet share certain lineages in common such as various East African-origin Macro-haplogroup L lineages (various L0, L1, L5, L2, L6, L4, L3 lineages) and North African and/or Middle Eastern-origin M1 and Macro-haplogroup N (in particular N subclades N1a, N1b, R0a, HV1b1, I, K1a, U3a, and U6a).\nAutosomal ancestry.\nCushitic populations have existed at the cross-roads of Africa and Eurasia since the Stone Age, with the Nile acting as a corridor between sub-Saharan Africa and Levant and North Africa thus Cushitic populations have multiple origins, like most other populations, that have become idiosyncratic of Cushitic populations. Cushitic populations tend to combine in their ancestries both, genetic components indigenous to East Africa, and non-African components of West Asian origin. According to an autosomal DNA study by Hodgson et al. (2014), the Afro-Asiatic languages were likely spread across Africa and the Near East by an ancestral population(s) carrying a newly identified non-African genetic component, which the researchers dub the \u201cEthio-Somali\u201d or \u201cSemitic-Cushitic\u201d in another study. This Ethio-Somali component is today most common among Cushitic and Ethiosemitic populations in the Horn of Africa and reaches a frequency peak among ethnic Somalis, representing the majority of their ancestry. The Ethio-Somali component is most closely related to the Maghrebi non-African genetic component, and is believed to have diverged from all other non-African ancestries at least 23,000 years ago. On this basis, the researchers suggest that the original Ethio-Somali carrying population(s) probably arrived in the pre-agricultural period from the Near East, having crossed over into northeastern Africa via the Sinai Peninsula. The population then likely split into two branches, with one group heading westward toward the Maghreb and the other moving south into the Horn. Ancient DNA analysis indicates that this foundational ancestry in the Horn region is akin to that of the Neolithic farmers of the southern Levant.\nAccording to Hodgson et al. (2014), both the African ancestry (Ethiopic) and the non-African ancestry (Ethio-Somali) in Cushitic speaking populations is significantly differentiated from all neighboring African and non-African ancestries in East Africa, North Africa, the Levant and Arabia. The genetic ancestry of Cushitic and Semitic speaking populations in the Horn of Africa represents ancestries (Ethiopic and Ethio-Somali) not found outside of Cushitic and Semitic speaking HOA populations in any significance. Therefore, both ancestries are distinct, unique to, and considered the signature autosomal genetic ancestry of Cushitic and Semitic speaking HOA populations.\nHodgson et al. states:\u201dThe African Ethiopic ancestry is tightly restricted to HOA populations and likely represents an autochthonous HOA population. The non-African ancestry in the HOA, which is primarily attributed to a novel Ethio-Somali inferred ancestry component, is significantly differentiated from all neighboring non-African ancestries in North Africa, the Levant, and Arabia.\u201dAccording to Hodgson et al. (2014), the non-African ancestry (Ethio-Somali) in the Cushitic speaking populations is distinct and unique to Cushitic and Semitic speaking HOA populations. Hodgson et al. states:\u201dWe find that most of the non-African ancestry in the HOA can be assigned to a distinct non-African origin Ethio-Somali ancestry component, which is found at its highest frequencies in Cushitic and Semitic speaking HOA populations.\u201dWhen calculated the genetic distance (FST) between Ethiosemitic-speaking and Cushitic-speaking Ethiopians, and populations of the Levant, North Africa, and the Arabian Peninsula using two approaches: (1) the whole genome and (2) only the non-African component \u2014 in the whole-genome analysis, Ethiopian Semitic and Cushitic populations appear to be closest to the Yemeni; when only the non-African component is used, they are closer to the Egyptians and populations inhabiting the Levant. However this is due to the fact that the similarity is because of the Ethiopian contribution to the Yemeni gene pool. Pagani et al. (2012) states:\u201dThe Ethiopian similarity with the Yemeni detected throughout the genome could be explained as an Ethiopian contribution to the Yemeni gene pool, consistent with that observed with mtDNA.\u201dA 2015 study by Dobon et al. identified an ancestral autosomal component of West Eurasian origin that is common to many modern Afroasiatic-speaking populations in Northeast Africa. Known as the \u2018\u2019Coptic\u2019\u2019 component, it peaks among Egyptian Copts who settled in Sudan over the past two centuries. The Coptic component evolved out of a main Northeast African and Middle Eastern ancestral component that is shared by other Egyptians and also found at high frequencies among Cushites (\u224840\u201360%), with the remaining 40\u201360% of the ancestry of Cushites being of sub-Saharan East African origin. However, these percentages are not certain since Figure 3 of the study by Dobon et al. only features these percentages in the k=3 model.\nAccording to Dobon et al. (2015), the results were not conclusive and states that there needs to be more studies on the East African samples. Dobon et al. states:\u201dOur main results add new and interesting features to the North East African genetic complexity, with new populations that define a genetic component in southern Nilo-Saharan speakers that cannot be related to a North-African or other sub-Saharan components. These populations should be included in further population genetics and epidemiological studies to have a representative sample of the genetic diversity of the region of East Africa.\u201dThe scientists involved in the study suggest that this points to a common origin for the general population of Egypt. They also associate the Coptic component with Ancient Egyptian ancestry, without the later Arabian influence that is present among other Egyptians. The Coptic component is roughly equivalent with the Ethio-Somali component.\nY DNA.\nA Y-chromosome study by Wood et al. (2005) tested various populations in Africa for paternal lineages, including 26 Maasai and 9 Luo from Kenya, and 9 Alur from the Democratic Republic of Congo. The signature Nilotic paternal marker Haplogroup A3b2 was observed in 27% of the Maasai, 22% of the Alur, and 11% of the Luo.\nAccording to Gomes et al. (2010), Haplogroup B is another characteristically Nilotic paternal marker. It was found in 22% of Wood et al.\u2019s Luo samples, 8% of studied Maasai and 50% of studied Nuer. The E1b1b haplogroup has been observed at overall frequencies of around 11% among Nilo-Saharan-speaking groups in the Great Lakes area, with this influence concentrated among the Maasai (50%). This is indicative of substantial historic gene flow from Cushitic-speaking males into these Nilo-Saharan-speaking populations. In addition, 67% of the Alur samples possessed the E2 haplogroup.\nA study by Hassan et al. (2008) analysed the Y-DNA of populations in the Sudan region, with various local Nilotic groups included for comparison. The researchers found the signature Nilotic A and B clades to be the most common paternal lineages amongst the Nilo-Saharan speakers, except those inhabiting western Sudan. There, a prominent North African influence was noted. Haplogroup A was observed amongst 62% of Dinka, 53.3% of Shilluk, 46.4% of Nuba, 33.3% of Nuer, 31.3% of Fur and 18.8% of Masalit. Haplogroup B was found in 50% of Nuer, 26.7% of Shilluk, 23% of Dinka, 14.3% of Nuba, 3.1% of Fur and 3.1% of Masalit. The E1b1b clade was also observed in 71.9% of the Masalit, 59.4% of the Fur, 39.3% of the Nuba, 20% of the Shilluk, 16.7% of the Nuer, and 15% of the Dinka. Hassan et al. attributed the atypically high frequencies of the haplogroup in the Masalit to either a recent population bottleneck, which likely altered the community\u2019s original haplogroup diversity, or to geographical proximity to E1b1b\u2019s place of origin in North Africa. The researchers suggest that the clade \u201cmight have been brought to Sudan [\u2026] after the progressive desertification of the Sahara around 6,000\u20138,000 years ago\u201d. Henn et al. (2008) similarly observed Afro-Asiatic influence in the Nilotic Datog of northern Tanzania, 43% of whom carried the M293 sub-clade of E1b1b.\nmtDNA.\nUnlike the paternal DNA of Nilotes, the maternal lineages of Nilotes in general show low-to-negligible amounts of Afro-Asiatic and other extraneous influences. An mtDNA study by Castri et al. (2008) examined the maternal ancestry of various Nilotic populations in Kenya, with Turkana, Samburu, Maasai and Luo individuals sampled. The mtDNA of almost all of the tested Nilotes belonged to various Sub-Saharan macro-haplogroup L sub-clades, including L0, L2, L3, L4 and L5. Low levels of maternal gene flow from North Africa and the Horn of Africa were observed in a few groups, mainly via the presence of mtDNA haplogroup M and haplogroup I lineages in about 12.5% of the Maasai and 7% of the Samburu samples, respectively.\nAutosomal DNA.\nThe autosomal DNA of Nilotic peoples has been examined in a comprehensive study by Tishkoff et al. (2009) on the genetic clusters of various populations in Africa. According to the researchers, Nilotes generally form their own African genetic cluster. The authors also found that certain Nilotic populations in the eastern Great Lakes region, such as the Maasai, showed some additional Afro-Asiatic affinities due to repeated assimilation of Cushitic-speaking peoples over the past 5000 or so years.\nAdmixture analysis.\nTishkoff \u2018\u2019et al\u2019\u2019 in 2009 published the largest study done to characterise genetic variation and relationships among populations in Africa. They examined 121 African populations, 4 African American populations and 60 non-African populations. Their results indicated a high degree of mixed ancestry reflecting migration events. In East Africa, all population groups examined had elements of Nilotic, Cushitic and Bantu ancestry amongst others to varying degrees. They also found that by and large, genetic clusters were consistent with linguistic classification with notable exceptions including the Luo of Kenya. Despite being Nilo-Saharan speakers, the Luo cluster with the Niger-Kordofanian speaking populations that surround them. They suggest that this indicates a high degree of admixture occurred during the southward migration of Southern Luo. Kalenjin groups and Maasai groups were found to have less Bantu ancestry but significant Cushitic ancestry.\nDavid Reich, a geneticist known for his studies on ancient DNA carried out a study which found that mutation frequencies in Luo people were much more similar to those of the surrounding Bantu speakers. They suggested that Luo speakers in East Africa may not have always been socially disadvantaged as they migrated into territories already inhabited by Bantu speakers. This is in keeping with oral history which affirms that large groups of Bantu speakers adopted Luo language, culture and customs that were dominant at the time."}

During this BETA time, iPlayer was only available as a download (WMV format) meaning that any person who did not have Windows loaded on their computer could not use iPlayer. This was not a popular move, and the BBC was put under pressure to allow all people to use iPlayer.\nOn Christmas Day 2007, iPlayer was no longer in BETA. People could now also watch programmes on the website instead of having to download the video as people had to do before. This meant that people who did not have Windows installed on their computers could use iPlayer as well.

In ancient times peoples such as the Hittites and the Incas were involved in colonialism.\nHowever people usually use the word colonialism to talk about the European overseas empires rather than land-based empires. Overseas empires include British rule in India and French rule in Algeria - both of which could only be reached by ships.\nLand based empires are usually described as imperialism and include:\nThe Ottoman Empire was created across Mediterranean, North Africa and into Southern Europe and existed during the time of European colonization of the other parts of the world.\nEuropean colonialism began in the fifteenth century when the Spanish and Portuguese began exploring the Americas, and the coasts of Africa, the Middle East, India, and East Asia.\nDuring the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, England, France and Holland made their own overseas empires. However the end of the eighteenth and early nineteenth century many European colonies in the Americas gained their independence.\nSpain and Portugal became weakened after the loss of their New World colonies and could not get back the power they once had. But Britain, France and Holland turned their attention to South Africa, India and South East Asia and began expanding.\nIn the nineteenth century Europe underwent industrialisation, the population got larger, armies became more organised and had better weapons produced in factories. This time became known as the era of New Imperialism. Very quickly European powers were able to take over land and included the Scramble for Africa.\nAfter World War I the European countries who had lost the war had to give up their colonies to the countries that had won the war. For instance Britain which won the war took over Tanzania from Germany (which had lost the war)\nAfter World War II however Europe's colonies started to become independent. In 1999 Portugal returned the last of Europe's colonies in Asia, Macau, to China, ending an era that had lasted five hundred years."}

At that time, British India belonged to Great Britain. In British India, most people were Hindu, or Muslim. The people who made the movement feared they would lose their liberty when the English left. They therefore wanted to create a separate state. This struggle was organised by the All India Muslim League party and resulted in the partition of the British Empire in India. The movement was led by Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Other important leaders were Nawab Muhammad Ismail Khan, Raja Amir Ahmed Khan of Mahmudabad, Sir Sikandar Hayat Khan, Nawabzada Liaquat Ali Khan, Fatimah Jinnah, Amjadi Bano Begum, Sir Abdullah Haroon, Khawaja Nazimuddin, Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, Sardar Shaukat Hayat Khan, Chaudhry Khaliquzzaman, A.K. Fazlul Huq, Aurangzeb Khan, Qazi Muhammad Isa and Abdur Rab Nishtar\nHistory of the movement.\nThe first person who had the idea of a separate state was not Allama Iqbal as is reckoned generally. He only forwarded the theory onwards in his speech in 1930. It was a prevailing idea that has its origins in United Provinces of Indian. People like Sir Syed Ahmed Khan and others had thought about a separate state there much earlier. From 1901 onwards, many other Muslim scholars had also been proposing the idea of a separate Muslim state within the subcontinent.Choudhary Rahmat Ali later proposed the name Pakistan in his Pakistan Declaration in 1933. People like Muhammad Ali Jinnah maintained their belief in religious unity. Religious hostilities between Hindus and Muslims gave the movement a stronger backing.\nIn 1940 during its meeting in Lahore, the Muslim League passed the Lahore Resolution (also known as Pakistan Resolution) that asked for an independent state of Pakistan. Soon after World War II, the United Kingdom became convinced that they would not be able to keep their colonies in South Asia, as the British Empire suffered very badly from the war. By 1947, British India was divided into two countries, a Muslim majority Pakistan and a Hindu majority India. Later on Bangladesh split from Pakistan in 1971."}

Many Hindus and Sikhs lived in the west, and many Muslims lived in the east, and so the partition saw many people displaced and much intercommunal violence. Lahore and Amritsar were at the center of the problem, the British were not sure where to place them - make them part of India or Pakistan. The British decided to hand both cities to India, but because of a lack of control and regulation for the border, Amritsar became part of India while Lahore became part of Pakistan. Areas in west Punjab such as Lahore, Rawalpindi, Multan, Gujrat, had a large Sikh population and many of the residents were attacked or killed by radical Muslims. On the other side in East Punjab cities such as Amritsar, Ludhiana, and Gurdaspur had a majority Muslim population in which many of them were wiped out by Sikh guerrillas who launched an all out war against the Muslims."}

The Governor-General headed the central Government of India in Calcutta and was responsible to the imperial government in London.

{"id": "125097", "revid": "1118100", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=125097", "title": "Flying disc", "text": "A flying disc is a flat round object with a thick rim. The rim make the disc easier to grip and throw, and also keeps the disc from turning over as it flies. Detailed throwing instructions are below, but the basic goal is to throw the disc while also making the disc spin. \nAlso mentioned below is a flying ring, made under the brand name Aerobie. Although these designs are very different, they both use air resistance in the same way to fly.\nUnlike the Aerobie, flying discs are used in both Ultimate Frisbee and Disc Golf. The Frisbee brand of flying disc is rarely used in official competition in either game, which is why the team sport of Ultimate Frisbee is officially called simply \"Ultimate.\" Still, as \"Kleenex\" was once a word used to mean \"facial tissue,\" \"Frisbee\" is still broadly used as a synonym for a flying disc.\nThe Aerobie.\nThe Aerobie Superdisk is an alternative design of flying disc that, although somewhat differently shaped, still has very similar properties to the conventional disc. It has less air resistance. Because there is less resistance to motion, the Aerobie discs can fly farther than the conventional disc. The Aerobie flying ring has minimal drag and holds the world record for the longest flight by a human-thrown projectile. However, due to the lack of a rim, the Aerobie is less suited to angled, curved flights and air-bouncing.\nSpin of the disc.\nThe spin of the disc helps to keep the disc stable in flight and prevent unplanned tilting. This is because a large angular momentum stabilises the disc in the same way that it keeps a gyroscope steady, with the angular force forcing the mass of the disc away from the centre of mass, perpendicular to the axis of rotation. Any unequal force acting on a particular area of the disc is quickly redirected to be equal over the circumference of the disc.\nAs the disc spins faster, it becomes more stable due to the rapidity of the equalisation of forces.\nMass of the disc.\nThe force required to accelerate the disc is directly proportional to the mass of the disc. This decreases the acceleration of the disc, assuming that the force of projection is constant. Therefore, discs come in a variety of weights, although those used for Ultimate are mainly 175 g in mass, heavier than the majority of discs and considerably heavier than an aerobie.\nFlying discs (including Frisbees) can be thrown in many ways. All involve spinning the disc to give it gyroscopic stability, and accelerating its mass to a certain velocity. Without spin, a disc will wobble and fall; without velocity, the disc will not go anywhere. Using these two guidelines, any number of throws are possible. Most discs are designed to create lift when thrown with the flat side up.\nTechniques.\nRight-side up.\nRight-side up throws are all similar in that they react the same way to the tilt of the disc when it is released. A disc thrown right-side up will accelerate in the direction of the low end of the disc. A disc tilted leading-edge up will lose speed at the end of the throw and make a gentle landing; if tilted sideways (known in aeronautics terms as roll), it can curve around objects.\nThere is a language for describing throws that curve. Both descriptions are relative to the direction the person is facing and intends to throw. This axis is marked in \"red\" in the picture.\nBackhand.\nThis is probably the most commonly learned throw, and also one of the most powerful. \nForehand.\nThis throw is also known as the \"flick,\" \"two-finger,\" or the \"side-arm\". Focused in the wrist, this throw takes little time to execute. Along with the backhand, it is one of the two most common throws used in Ultimate.\nVariations.\nThe forehand is a versatile throw, and can be adapted to many different situations.\nPush Pass.\nThe Push Pass: A relatively little-used throw, it is thrown with a grip similar to a backhand (index finger on the outer rim of the disc, thumb on top, other fingers curled underneath) but is released on the forehand side from a forehand stance. A pronating wrist snap similar to a forehand release pushes the disc forward, while spin is imparted \"backwards\" by rolling the disc off the index finger. A final flick of the index finger finishes the release. It is difficult to impart as much spin to the push pass as one can typically impart to a forehand or backhand, resulting in a less stable throw. It is useful in Ultimate for very short throws released to the forehand side.\nThumber forehand.\nThe thumber forehand is also known as a The Beach Thumber, Peach, or in the sport of guts, simply as a thumber. Its primary advantage is that it can be thrown quite hard and with a great amount of spin, and is relatively easy to learn. It is often seen used in a game of Guts due to its power and velocity. It is unpopular in Ultimate due to several disadvantages when compared to the standard forehand. It is relatively difficult to impart different curves or release angles to, it is harder to release extended away from the thrower's body, and it makes for slow grip transitions to a backhand or hammer.\nOverhand.\nThe Overhand (also known as \"Hungarian\", \"flamingo\", \"dragonwing\", \"windmill\", \"waffle\", \"discus\", \"wrist-hook\", \"chicken wing\", or \"biscuit\") is rarely used among ultimate players, because the alternative, the traditional forehand, allows greater sideways arm extension, useful in moving the disc around defenders. The Overhand is most useful when the disc is caught above the head and must be thrown quickly without changing grips, such as during a Greatest attempt.\nDuck.\nThe Duck (also known as a \"bear claw\", a \"duder,\" or a \"useless\") is thrown with a similar grip to the Overhand, except it is the backward version of it. While the Overhand is thrown with counter-clockwise spin (for right-handers), the duck is thrown with clockwise spin. It is usually thrown with the arm out to the side or above the head. It is called the duck due to the shape of the gripping hand during the throw, as if making a duck shadow puppet. This throw is used in attempts at The Greatest (jumping out of bounds and throwing the Frisbee back in to play while in the air).\nUpside-down.\nA disc thrown upside-down has a very different flight path than one thrown right-side up. The lift force does not enforce stable flight as it does on a right-side up disc, resulting in a more of a parabolic arc in flight. As with a right-side up throw, however, the flight path of the disc will curve toward the lower edge. This banking effect is most pronounced when the disc is at a 45 degree angle, and less pronounced when it is near-vertical, or near-horizontal. \nGyroscopic precession causes the disc to rotate toward horizontal through its flight path. Unlike a right-side up throw, however, an upside-down disc will not precess toward a stable flat state, and will in stead oscillate past horizontal and begin to bank in the opposite direction. This shuttlecock-like effect is known as \"helixing\", and is generally avoided due to the difficulty in controlling a helixing flight path. For this reason, an upside down throw is typically released with either clockwise rotation and the left edge up, or counterclockwise rotation and the right edge up. The longer the disc is expected to remain in the air, the closer to vertical it must be at release to avoid the helixing effect.\nHammer.\nThe Hammer is gripped just like a normal forehand throw, and is generally a mid-range, high and arching throw.\nA hammer, when thrown by a right-handed thrower, will arc up and to the left as it moves away from the thrower, and will bank towards the right in flight. The banking effect will be more pronounced if the disc is thrown higher and spends more flight time near a 45 degree angle.\nScoober.\nAnother upside-down variant of the forehand, the scoober (also known as the \"Spoon pass\" or \"Hiawatha\") is similar to a hammer, but released away from the body from a backhand stance, instead of over the head from a forehand stance. The scoober travels in a path similar to the hammer, although the initial release is typically more flat than a hammer release. Although it is more difficult to impart power to a scoober than a hammer, a scoober can be an effective short-range (10 to 20 yards/meters) throw and is used in Ultimate for breaking the mark and to throw over defenders in a zone defense.\nThumber.\nThe Thumber (not to be confused with the \"thumber forehand\") is a throw that is rarely used in competitive play, compared to the Hammer or standard forehand. It has a flight path that is the mirror-image of the Hammer (arcing high and to the right for a right-handed thrower). It can be useful when the disc needs to drop quickly and fly with an opposite curve to a Hammer in order to avoid defenders.\nTable of basic disc throws.\nThis table represents the fundamental disc throws with classic technique in the foreword form, in fact exist many variations of throws and grips that make the number of pitches quite infinite. \nThe \"natural path\" is the trajectory the disc takes without pre-release tilt.\nThe \"hyzer path\" is the trajectory the disc takes when the outside edge of the disc is tilted downward.\nThe \"anhyzer path\" is the trajectory the disc takes when the outside edge of the disc is tilted upward.\nThe \"spin\" is the rotation of the disc.\nEvery throw can be done with the right hand or the left hand and this is shown in the \"hand\" column.\nRH=right hand, LH=left hand, R=the path tends to the right of the thrower, L=the path tends to the left of the thrower, 0 means that the path is quite linear.\nSo R with RH and L with LH are outside-in (OI) paths; R with LH and L with RH are inside-out (IO) paths.\nIn \"spin\" column numbers represent the sign of the angular momentum relative to the upside of the disc (+1=positive (counter-clockwise rotation), -1=negative (clockwise rotation)).\nThrows may be signed as follows: hand acronym+throw acronym+tilt acronym. For example LHBHIO is an inside out backhand throw pitched with the left hand; RHFH0 is a linear forehand throw pitched with the right hand. To have linear paths the disc must be released with a light opposite tilt than his \"natural path\"."}

He was in 233 episodes on American television series. He was also in a feature-length movie and other media. He has become well known as an example of stop motion clay animation. He has become a cultural icon. There have been many tributes and parodies, including a video game and toys. Gumby Adventures aired on PBS Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network and Galavision\nOrigin.\nGumby was started by Art Clokey in 1953. The first 'episode' was a 3-minute short called \"Gumbasia\". It showed moving lumps of clay set to music, and parodied \"Fantasia\". In 1955, Art showed Gumbasia to movie producer Sam Engel, who then paid him for a 15-minute movie called \"Gumby Goes to the Moon\". \nGumby was given his own NBC series in 1957. Female actress' voiced Gumby. New episodes were added in 1962, and Dallas McKennon became the voice of Gumby.\nCharacters.\nGumby's main sidekick is Pokey, a talking orange pony. His enemies are the Blockheads. They are a pair of human-like, red-colored figures with block-shaped heads. The Blockheads were inspired by the Katzenjammer Kids, who were always getting into scrapes and causing discomfort to others. Other characters are Gumby's dog Nopey. All he says is \"nope\". There is also Prickle, a yellow dinosaur who sometimes acts like a detective with pipe and hat like Sherlock Holmes. Also on the series are Goo, a flying blue mermaid who spits blue goo balls and can change shape at will; Gumby's mother Gumba and father Gumbo. The later series in 1988 added Gumby's sister Minga and mastodon friend Denali.\nBonus Features.\n\"The Adventures of Gumby\" had 22 bonus episodes and 16 episodes with commentary.\nGumby Bumpers.\nGumby Bumpers in 2 minutes is released in January 4, 1980 starring Gumby, Pokey and cameo appearance of Blue Mermaid Goo.\nMary Had a Little Lamb.\nWas released on February 13, 1982. It is 6 minutes long.\n1967 version.\nIn 1967 version, an episode of Gumby Train Trouble is released in January 7, 1967 starring Gumby and first appearance of Nopey. This episode in 1967 is the version of 1958."}

It is the furthest image of the universe ever taken by humans. In it we see the universe as it was 13 billion years ago, when it was about 800 million years old.\nThe HUDF contains an about 10,000 galaxies. The patch of sky where the galaxies are was chosen because it has few bright stars in the near-field. Although most of the targets visible in the Hubble image can also be seen at infrared wavelengths by ground-based telescopes, Hubble is the only instrument which can make observations of these distant targets at visible wavelengths. \nSouthwest of Orion in the Southern-Hemisphere constellation Fornax at right ascension 3h 32m 40.0s, declination -27\u00b0 47' 29\" (J2000), the image covers 36.7 square arcminutes. This is smaller than a square of paper held away, and equal to roughly one thirteen-millionth of the total area of the sky. The image is such that the upper left corner points toward north (-46.4\u00b0) on the celestial sphere. The star near the center of the field is USNO-A2.0 0600-01400432 with apparent magnitude of 18.95.\nIn total, the image required 800 exposures taken over the course of 400 Hubble orbits around Earth. The total amount of exposure time was 11.3 days for the ACS and 4.5 days for the NICMOS.\nLater versions.\nOn September 25, 2012, NASA released a more refined version of the Ultra-Deep Field called the eXtreme Deep Field (XDF). The XDF reveals galaxies that span back 13.2 billion years in time, revealing a galaxy theorized to be formed only 450 million years after the big bang event. On June 3, 2014, NASA released the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field image composed of, for the first time, the full range of ultraviolet to near-infrared light.\nOn January 23, 2019, the Instituto de Astrof\u00edsica de Canarias released an even deeper version of the infrared images of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field obtained with the WFC3 instrument, named the ABYSS Hubble Ultra Deep Field. The new images improve the previous reduction of the WFC3/IR images, including careful sky background subtraction around the largest galaxies on the field of view. After this update, some galaxies were found to be almost twice as big as previously measured."}

When he was 13, his mother died.\nDue to the hearing problems, he was not admitted to the school, so he had to study by himself. He passed much of his time by reading books.

{"id": "125351", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=125351", "title": "History of Vilnius", "text": "Vilnius is the capital of Lithuania.\nEarly history.\nHistorians tend to identify the city with Voruta, a legendary capital of Mindaugas who was crowned in 1253 as King of Lithuania. The city was first mentioned in written sources in 1323, in letters of Grand Duke Gediminas that were sent to German cities and invited Germans and members of the Jewish community to settle in the capital city. In 1387, the city was granted city rights by Jogaila, one of Gediminas' successors.\nPolish-Lithuanian Commonwealth period.\nBetween 1503 and 1522 the walls were built to protect the city, and at the time it had nine city gates and three towers. Vilnius reached the peak of its development under the reign of Sigismund August, who moved his court there in 1544. In the following centuries, Vilnius became a constantly growing and developing city. This growth was due in part to the establishment of Almae Academia et Universitas Vilnensis Societatis Jesu by the King Stephen Bathory in 1579. The university soon developed into one of the most important scientific and cultural centres of the region and the most notable scientific centre of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Political, economic, and social activities were in full swing in the town. In 1769, the Rasos Cemetery, one of the oldest surviving cemeteries in the city, was founded. During its rapid development, the city was open to migrants from both abroad and far reaches of territories of Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Each group made its unique contribution to the life of the city, and crafts, trade and science prospered. During the Russo-Polish War (1654\u20131667), Vilnius was occupied by Russia for several years. The city was pillaged and burned, and its population was massacred. The city's growth lost its momentum for many years, but the population rebounded, and by the beginning of the 19th century city's population reached 20,000, making the city one of the largest in Northern Europe.\nIn Russian Empire.\nAfter the Third Partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 15 April 1795, Vilnius was annexed by Russian Empire and became the capital of a Vilna Governorate. During the Russian occupation the city walls were destroyed, and by 1805, only the Dawn Gate remained. In 1812, the city was seized by Napoleon on his push towards Moscow. Following the November Uprising in 1831, Vilnius University was closed and Russian repressions damaged the development of the city. During the January Uprising in 1863 heavy fighting occurred within the city, but was brutally pacified by Mikhail Muravyov, by the population because of the number of executions he organized. After the uprising, all civil liberties were withdrawn, and use of the Polish and Lithuanian languages was banned. in early 20th century Lithuanian speaking population constituted only a small minority then, with Polish, Yiddish, and Russian speakers being most of the population of the city. \nIn Poland.\nDuring World War I, Vilnius \u2013 as with the rest of Lithuania \u2013 was occupied by the German Empire from 1915 until 1918. The \"Act of Independence of Lithuania\", that restored Lithuanian independence from any affiliation to any other nation was proclaimed in the city on February 16 1918. After the withdrawal of German forces, Lithuanian forces were forced to retreat by advancing Russian occupation forces. Vilnius changed hands many times: for a while it was controlled by Polish self-defence units, who didn't want the city to be occupied by Russian-Bolshevik forces. Then the Polish Army regained control, then Soviet forces again. Shortly after its defeat in the Battle of Warsaw (1920), the retreating Red Army ceded the city back to Lithuania by signing a peace treaty on July 12, 1920. On October 9 of the same year, the Polish Army under General Lucjan \u017beligowski broke the treaty and seized Vilnius after a staged coup. The city and its surroundings were proclaimed as the separate state of Central Lithuania. On February 20 1922 after an elections, the whole area was attached to Poland, with the city as the capital of the Wilno Voivodship (Wilno being the name of Vilnius in Polish). The predominant languages of the city were still Polish and, to a lesser extent, Yiddish."}

More than 75% of Virgin Atlantic's flights go/come to London Heathrow Airport. The rest mostly fly from London Gatwick Airport, Manchester Airport or Glasgow Airport. Virgin flies to 31 cities. These are either in Africa, Asia, Europe, the United States or the Caribbean. \nIt was founded by British businessman Sir Richard Branson in the 1980s.\nPartners.\nVirgin Atlantic has partners. Here is a list of them:\nPlanes.\nVirgin Atlantic owns 10 Airbus A330 11 Airbus A340 planes, 10 Boeing 747-400 planes and 5 Boeing 787 planes. It also has an order for 6 Airbus A380 planes but were later cancelled and replaced by an order for 12 Airbus A350-1000 planes, another order is for 8 Boeing 787 planes.\nVirgin Atlantic used to have some other aircraft too.

Virgin Atlantic's first plane was a Boeing 747-200. \nInside the planes.\nVirgin Atlantic uses three different classes on their planes: Economy, Economy and Upper Class. \nEconomy.\nEconomy class is the standard class on Virgin Atlantic aircraft. It is the cheapest part of the plane to travel in. Passengers usually get a free meal, some drinks and a bag with gifts in like a toothbrush. The seats in this class have a maximum pitch of 31 in, but this depends on what plane the passenger goes in.\nPremium Economy.\nPassengers that use Premium Economy have their own check-in area. They get to get on the plane before Economy passengers and a drink before the flight. They get a better seat and a special cabin crew. The seat it wider and more distance from the seat in front of it.\nIn November 2006, Virgin made a new seat. It is wider than the old one and has a plug for laptops. It is being put on all planes and now, all Airbus A340s and all Boeing 747s that fly from London Heathrow Airport have the new seats.\nUpper Class.\nUpper Class is the name for Virgin Atlantic's .

They help people who have been injured or become ill very suddenly.\nParamedics can do many different things to decide what the problem is and to treat the patient at the scene. If it is needed, they then take the person to a hospital in the ambulance. They try to prevent the person's illness from getting worse before they reach the hospital, where doctors and nurses will take over care. Paramedics have to work in many different types of emergency, and cannot predict what the next one will be.\nPeople often use the term \"paramedic\" for anyone who works on an ambulance. However, not all ambulance crew have paramedic as their job title. \"Emergency Medical Technicians\" or \"Emergency Care Assistants\" do similar work but have less training. Some ambulances also have doctors and nurses. In many countries, the title of \"paramedic\" is for those who have taken a specific training course."}

It is the thickest, heaviest, and second longest known living snake (behind the reticulated python). The term \"anaconda\" usually means this species.\nHabitat.\nThis giant snake (which is also called the water boa) lives in swampy areas of tropical South America. It spends a lot of time in shallow water, hidden from unsuspecting prey. Anacondas give birth to live young; 20 to 40 baby snakes are born at one time. The largest specimens measured 17.1\u00a0feet long and weighed 215\u00a0pounds.\nHunting and diet.\nAll snakes are carnivores (meat-eaters). Anaconda eat 4 to 5 times year because it takes 3 to 4 months to digest their food. Anacondas mostly hunt at night. Anacondas kill by constricting (squeezing) the prey until it can no longer breathe. Sometimes they drown the prey. Like all snakes, they swallow the prey whole, head first. The anaconda's top and bottom jaws are attached to each other with stretchy ligaments, which let the snake swallow animals wider than itself. Snakes do not chew their food, they digest it with quite strong acids in the snake's stomach. Anacondas eat pigs, deer, caiman (a type of crocodilian), birds, fish, rodents (like the capybara and agouti), and other animals. After eating a large animal, the anaconda needs no food for a long time, and rests for weeks. The young (called neonates) can care for themselves soon after birth, including hunting (but are pretty much defenseless against large predators). They eat small rodents (like rats and mice), baby birds, frogs and small fish.\nOther species.\nThere are four species in the genus \"Eunectes\":"}

{"id": "125511", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=125511", "title": "Sniper", "text": "A sniper is a person who is trained to shoot perfectly at things that are very small or very far away. The sniper's target is usually an enemy. Many military snipers get special training to use a sniper rifle, a special type of gun. Most sniper rifles have a telescope called a sniper scope to help the sniper see the target. Snipers are also trained to be stealthy. Snipers hide or use military camouflage such as a ghillie suit that looks like (and may include some of) the surrounding foliage so that it is hard for the enemy to see them. A sniper is also called a \"marksman\".\nExperienced hunters often share many of the skills that long range shooters need to know. The two jobs are very similar. The word \"sniper\" came from Britain when highly accurate shooters would hunt\u2013also known as \"snipe\"\u2013birds that were very hard to see and shoot.\nMany police departments have snipers on their SWAT teams. Because police snipers do not always perform the same tasks as military snipers, police snipers are sometimes known as \"marksmen\".\nSniping.\nSnipers shoot targets that are far away. Because the bullet shot by a sniper has to travel a very long distance, the sniper has to be very careful when taking aim. There are three main things that have an effect on the accuracy of the shot. The sniper must plan for these things.\nThe bullets used by snipers are usually heavy. They are powered by a large amount of gunpowder. This makes the bullet travel very fast. The heaviness makes the bullet less affected by wind. The speed makes the bullet less affected by gravity. A fast bullet reaches a target quicker, before it has time for gravity to affect it. Large fast bullets do more damage to the target than lighter or slower bullets.\nAccuracy.\nMost soldiers are trained so that they can shoot a target that is between to away and hit it with approximately half their shots. Very well trained soldiers, such as the U.S. Marine Corps, can hit a target that is between to away, with approximately half of their shots. A sniper is trained to be able to hit a target over , or half a mile away with almost every single shot. Some snipers are so accurate that they can shoot something out of a person's hand, but they usually aim for the target's head or chest. These areas are harder to miss, and are more likely to disable the target.\nSniper rifles.\nA sniper uses a special kind of rifle called a sniper rifle. This rifle is much more accurate than normal rifles. Almost all sniper rifles use a Sniper scope, a special telescope that allows them to see targets very far away. There are two different kinds of sniper rifles: bolt action rifles, which fire a single shot and then the user must ready the next shot, and semi-automatic (\"semi-auto\") rifles which fire a single shot each time the trigger is pulled.\nTypically, bolt-action rifles have a longer range and are more accurate than semi-automatic rifles, however the rate of fire is slower than a semi-automatic rifle, which fires as fast as the shooter can squeeze the trigger. At close ranges, or where a shooter must make a quick follow-up shot, a sniper may prefer to use the semi-automatic rifle instead.\nA magazine is used on semi automatic rifles and most bolt action rifles. Magazines hold more shots in the gun and make it much faster to ready the next shot.\nCamouflage.\nSnipers usually wear camouflage clothing, to avoid being seen. Camouflage works by hiding the outline and shape of the human body, so that it is not easily seen. Camouflage does not work very well when the person wearing it is moving because the eye sees movement much better than shapes or colors. Snipers often paint their faces green or black to make them shine less, and blend in with the surroundings. Sometimes snipers wear special camouflage suits, called ghillie suits. Ghillie suits are made of shredded burlap or yute and often have plants attached to them. Snipers will often make several different ghillie suits to help them hide in different kinds of terrain. These suits are very effective at hiding the sniper. Often a sniper can be invisible to an enemy standing right next to him.\nPolice snipers generally do not need camouflage, because their main job is to make accurate shots, not to hide from the criminal. Sometimes police need to hide, so police snipers are trained in hiding techniques.\nSnipers in War.\nMilitary snipers are chosen for their intelligence, their good sight and their ability to shoot very well. They are trained to use their sight very well. They are trained to see the enemy from far away, and to notice small movements that might show that enemies are near. They are also trained to hide themselves. Snipers use these skills to destroy enemy troops. Snipers generally work in a small unit (or team) of just two people, a sniper and a spotter. The spotter finds targets for the sniper with a telescope. If the sniper misses the target, then the spotter also helps the sniper adjust the next shot so it hits the target. The spotter also protects the sniper from enemies at close range.\nSnipers are often used as scouts for the army because they can easily hide themselves from the enemy, even when they are close. They use the sniper scope on their rifles to see farther than most soldiers are able to see. Snipers are often able to notice details and remember information that ordinary soldiers would not. When a sniper is in a team with a spotter, it is usually the spotter's job to use a radio to speak with other military units. The team can report on the enemy position and enemy movements.\nSnipers in World War I and II.\nIn World War I (WWI), there were no special sniper rifles. Instead, snipers used normal rifles with a sniper scope mounted on them.\nIn World War II, snipers were common. They were an important part of the fighting. Every squad of the Soviet army included sniper or a 'marksman'. Camouflage tactics were developed during this time. Snipers were very useful during the Battle of Stalingrad. One Russian sniper was said to have killed over 240 German troops. Even that wasn't the best. Mihail Surkov killed 702 enemy troops and Semen Nomokonov killed 367 by sniping, including a general.\nPolice snipers.\nPolice departments train and use snipers. These snipers mainly serve on the SWAT team for their department. Often they are called upon to provide security at special events, or to make sure that other snipers do not murder someone. This job is called counter-sniping. Most police snipers are trained by the military.\nFamous snipers.\nSome snipers are famous for having killed hundreds of enemy soldiers. One such sniper is U.S. Marine Corps sniper Carlos Hathcock, who was famous in the Vietnam War for wearing a white feather in his hat. Other snipers are famous for being able to kill an enemy from very far away. Carlos Hathcock held the record for the furthest distance kill for a very long time \u2013 his farthest was over . However, in the Afghanistan War, snipers from the Canadian Army broke the record with a shot of . Other snipers are known for difficult shots. For example, Matt Hughes had to make a shot in very high winds by aiming over to the left of the enemy. An example of a famous sniper in WWII is Vasily Zaytsev. He supposedly killed 225 enemy soldiers during the Battle of Stalingrad.\nSimo H\u00e4yh\u00e4 (the White Death,bielaja smjert) has more documented kills than any other sniper in history.\nSnipers in popular culture.\nSnipers are often used in video games as elite soldiers. Getting a headshot with a sniper rifle is thought of as a hard skill to learn. In some movies, assassins use sniper rifles; examples include \"Phone Booth\" and \"Vantage Point\". Sometimes snipers have a bad reputation in the media; for example, in October 2002 two men went on a month long killing spree using a Sniper rifle in the Virginia and Maryland area."}

Almost all sniper rifles use a sniper scope, a special telescope that allows them to see targets very far away. There are two different kinds of sniper rifles: bolt action rifles, which fire a single shot and then the user must ready the next shot, and semi-automatic (\"semi-auto\") rifles which fire a single shot each time the trigger is pulled, and automatically ready the next shot for firing. Fully automatic rifles, which fire continuously when the trigger is pulled as long as there is ammunition, generally are not used though in rare instances they can be converted into a sniper rifle. In one such instance, a heavy machine gun with a scope, while not a true sniper rifle, set the record for longest kill by a sniper for years, until advances in rifle technology and sniper training allowed a sniper with a true sniper rifle to beat that record.\nTypically, bolt-action rifles have a longer range and are more accurate than semi-automatic rifles, however because each round must be chambered by hand, the rate of fire is slower than a semi-automatic rifle, which fires as fast as the shooter can squeeze the trigger. At close ranges, or in situations where a shooter must make a quick follow-up shot, a sniper may prefer to use the semi-automatic rifle instead. Examples of bolt action sniper rifles are the M40, R700, and M24. Examples of semi-automatic ones are the M21, Dragunov, and the M82 Barret .50 caliber.\nSniper rifles range in caliber (the diameter, or width, of the bullet fired in fractions of an inch) from as small as with the .22 LR (long rifle) bullet fired by many small pistols, to as large as with the .50 Browning Machine Gun (BMG) bullet which is fired by vehicle mounted heavy machine guns. Smaller rounds like the .22 LR are often used at very close range with a sound suppressor (commonly called a silencer) to quickly and quietly break street lights or kill vermin and small animals. The round is generally too weak and has too short of a range for longer range work, or shots on human-sized targets. In contrast, large rounds like the .50 BMG are fired out of very large and heavy sniper rifles that are often used for destroying light vehicles and equipment. They can fire at extreme ranges of over a mile, but generally are too bulky, inaccurate at short ranges, and expensive for general purpose work. \nSniper rifle barrels must be cleaned every day to get rid of any liquid. Not cleaning the barrel can allow to disastrous situations, or even let the barrel explode upon firing.\nSniper rifles of history.\nOn 7 October 1777, during the Battle of Saratoga, Timothy Murphy, a rifleman in Morgan's Kentucky Riflemen, shot and killed General Simon Fraser of the British army. Murphy was said to have taken the shot at roughly 500 yards. He was using the renowned Kentucky long rifle. Fraser was leading a recon in force against the rebellious colonists at Bemis Heights in New York. As a result of Fraser's death, the recon failed. This had a direct impact on the overall battle, leading to the British defeat. The Battle of Saratoga was considered one of the turning points of the War for Independence. \nMartin Luther King, Jr. was shot and killed from the bullet of the Remington .30-06 rifle. Another example is when John F. Kennedy was assassinated. He was sniped by a Carcano-type Model 91-38 rifle."}

It is inspired by XML.\nIt is different to most protocols because it is an open standard. This means that anybody who has a domain name and an internet connection can run their own server. Most of the software and the clients are open source.\nOther software such as Google Talk and the Gizmo5 use the XMPP protocol. It has been installed on thousands of servers across the internet. There are over five hundred million users who use software based on the protocol. Clients include Pidgin and iChat.\nHistory.\nJeremie Miller started the Jabber project in 1998. The first major public release was in May 2000. This early software was the basis of XMPP. It was a competitor to SIMPLE, which was based on the SIP protocol.\nIn August 2001, the Jabber Software Foundation (JSF) was started. The main role of the JSF was to manage the XML protocols for XMPP by documenting them. As well as this, the organisation was to co-ordinate the many companies that were using the XMPP technology.\nIn 2002, the Internet Engineering Task Force created a working group to formalize the protocol. The group was named the \"Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol Working Group\", or \"XMPP WG\".\nIn 2007, Jabber Software Foundation (JSF) became XMPP Standards Foundation (XSF).\nXMPP and HTTP.\nXMPP can use HTTP to send data to the servers. This is useful when there are strict firewalls in place, because data can be sent through the web instead of through a different port (port 5222 and 5223).\nThere are also open public servers which use standard ports (port 80 and 443) so that users can connect from behind most firewalls."}

It was directed by Theo van Gogh. Ayaan Hirsi Ali wrote the script. She made the story. The movie is 10 minutes long. The movie title is a direct translation of the word Islam into English.\nThe movie tells the story of four fictional characters. All four characters are played by a single actress wearing a veil. The woman wears a see-through chador but is otherwise naked. Different verses of the Qur'an are painted onto her body.\nThe characters shown in the movie are Muslim women who have been abused in different ways. For example, one woman has been raped by someone close to her. These women have a monologue - they speak to themselves.\nThe movie dramatically highlights three verses of the Quran ( and ). These verses seem make it permissible to treat women badly. The authors of the movie show the verses painted on the women's bodies.\nMohammed Bouyeri assassinated Theo van Gogh, after the movie had been shown on Dutch TV. Bouyeri is a Moroccan-Dutch Muslim who was upset about the movie. The assassination happened on 2 November 2004. A letter linked the murder to Van Gogh's movie and his views regarding Islam. It was addressed to Ayaan Hirsi Ali and called for \"jihad\" against \"kafir\". Kafir is an Arabic word for unbeliever, a person who hides, denies, or covers the truth. The letter was also against America, Europe, the Netherlands, and Hirsi Ali herself. After the murder of Van Gogh, tens of thousands gathered in the center of Amsterdam to mourn Van Gogh's death. There were fire-bombings of mosques and Muslim schools. Christian churches were also attacked. Eleven other Muslim men were also arrested, other than Bouyeri. They were charged with conspiracy to assassinate Hirsi Ali.\nAfter the murder of Theo van Gogh, \"Submission\" gained international fame. It was withdrawn from the International Film Festival Rotterdam. The movie had been scheduled to be shown on Sunday during a discussion on freedom of speech in movie at the festival. Because of the violent murder of Van Gogh, the producer of \"Submission\", Gijs van de Westelaken, said, \"We do not want to take any chance of endangering anyone else who participated in the movie.\" The movie was shown on television in a number of European countries.\nHirsi Ali has said she would like to make a sequel to the movie because \"By not making 'Submission Part II,' I would only be helping terrorists believe that if they use violence, they're rewarded with what they want.\" When she was asked if she would submit to threats against her life, she said \"Not me.\""}

The World Bank has the goal of reducing poverty.\nThe World Bank is different from the World Bank Group, because the World Bank is made up of only two institutions: the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association (IDA). The World Bank Group has these two, but also three more: International Finance Corporation (IFC), Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).\nHistory.\nThe World Bank is one of five institutions started as the Bretton Woods system in July 1944. The International Monetary Fund is another one. Many countries sent people to attend the Bretton Woods Conference. The most powerful countries with people there were the United States and United Kingdom, which controlled most of the negotiations. \nThe World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are both based in Washington DC, but the World Bank is headed by an American, while the IMF is led by a European.\n1945\u20131968.\nFrom the start until 1967 the bank did not lend as much money as it does now. Careful screening of loan applications was common. The bank wanted to provide loans for reconstruction and development, but if they lent out too much, there would be less trust in the bank.\nBank president John McCloy chose France to be the first country to receive a loan from the World Bank; Poland and Chile applied but did not receive one. The loan was for $987 million, half the amount that France actually asked for. There were very strict rules about the use of the funds. Bank staff made sure that the French government would have a balanced budget and pay back what it owed to the World Bank first before it paid back other countries. The United States State Department told the French government that the Cabinet should not have any communists. To get the loan, the French government removed the Communist coalition government. The loan to France was given very quickly after that.\nThe Marshall Plan of 1947 meant that many European countries already got help, so the World Bank began to lend to non-European countries. Until 1968, loans were used mainly to pay for projects that would help the country pay it back (such projects as ports, highway systems, and power plants).\n1968\u20131980.\nFrom 1968 to 1980 the bank worked mostly on meeting the basic needs of people in poor countries. The amount of money being loaned out grew bigger, and more loans were given. This was because the loans were not just given for infrastructure, but also for social services and other things.\nThese changes were made by Robert McNamara who became the president in 1968. McNamara managed the Bank in the same way he had worked when he was United States Secretary of Defense and President of the Ford Motor Company. McNamara changed the focus toward things such as building schools and hospitals, improving literacy and farming. McNamara started a new system of gathering information from nations applying for loans. This helped the bank to process loan applications much faster. To give out more loans, McNamara told bank treasurer Eugene Rotberg to find new sources of money, because the northern banks that had lent out the money did not have enough. Rotberg used the bond market to increase the amount of money that the bank could lend. One result of lending so much to help poor countries was that the countries in the Third World started owing a lot more money. From 1976 to 1980 developing world debt rose at an average of 20% a year.\n1989\u2013Present.\nFrom 1989 World Bank policy changed, because many people were complaining. Environmental groups and NGOs were also lent money, to help fix the things that the people were complaining about. Now bank projects include caring for the environment.\nMillennium Development Goals.\nThe World Bank's current focus is on meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). This means lending mainly to countries that are not very poor, at interest rates which are a little bit higher than the ones it borrows at. The IDA provides low or no interest loans and grants to the poorest countries. The Bank\u2019s mission is to help developing countries to develop more and become less poor. They will also meet the MDGs by helping countries to become good places for investment, jobs and sustainable growth. This (it is postulated) will help the country's economic growth through investment and help the poor to share the results of economic growth.\nKey Factors.\nThe World Bank says that there are five key factors necessary for economic growth:\nPoverty reduction strategies.\nFor the poorest developing countries in the world, the bank\u2019s plans are based on poverty reduction strategies. The World Bank looks very carefully at local groups of people, and the needs of the country, to develop a strategy that works best for that country. The government then says what it will do to help stop poverty, and the World Bank works with it.\nForty-five countries gave US$25.1 billion in \"aid for the world's poorest countries\", aid that goes to the World Bank International Development Association (IDA) which distributes the money to eighty poorer countries. While richer nations sometimes pay for their own aid projects, Robert B. Zoellick, the president of the World Bank, said when the gifts were announced on December 15, 2007, that World Bank money \"is the core funding that the poorest developing countries rely on\".\nLeadership.\nIn 2012, Jim Yong Kim became President of the Bank. He is responsible for chairing the meetings of the Boards of Directors and for running the Bank. The Bank President has always been a US citizen chosen by the United States, the largest shareholder in the bank. The person is then approved by the Board of Governors. They are president for five years, and after that they might be chosen again.\nThe Executive Directors, represent the Bank's member countries. They make up the Board of Directors and usually meet twice a week to approve and discuss loans and guarantees, new policies, the budget, ways to help countries and other important decisions.\nThere are 24 Vice-Presidents, three Senior Vice Presidents and two Executive Vice Presidents.\nVoting power.\nIn 2010, voting powers at the World Bank were changed so that developing countries, especially China, have a bigger vote. The countries with most voting power are now the United States (15.85%), Japan (6.84%), China (4.42%), Germany (4.00%), France (3.75%) and the United Kingdom (3.75%). Under the changes, other countries that saw big gains included Brazil, India, South Korea and Mexico. Most developed countries' voting power was reduced. Russia's voting power was not changed. \nCriticism.\nThe World Bank has been criticized by non-governmental organizations, such as Survival International, and academics, including its former Chief Economist Joseph Stiglitz. Critics say that the free market that the Bank supports is to economic development if done badly, too quickly, in the wrong order or in weak economies.\nIn \"Masters of Illusion: The World Bank and the Poverty of Nations\" (1996), Catherine Caufield argued that the way the World Bank works is bad for southern nations. Caufield said that the World Bank focuses too much on \"development\". To the World Bank, different nations all need the same \"remedy of development\". She argued that to have even modest success, Western practices are used instead of traditional economic structures and values. A second thing the World Bank thinks is that poor countries cannot become modern without money and advice from other countries.\nA number of academics in developing countries have said that the way the World Bank works only blames the poor for being poor.\nOne of the strongest criticisms of the World Bank is the way it was run. While the World Bank represents 186 countries, it is run by a small number of powerful countries. These countries choose who runs the World Bank, so what they want is what the bank does.\nThe World Bank is two different things: a political organization and a practical organization. As a political organization, the World Bank does what donor and borrowing governments, private capital markets, and other international organizations want. As a practical organization, it must be neutral, working mainly in development aid, technical assistance, and loans. Because the World Bank has to do what donor countries and private capital markets want, it says poverty is best solved by \"market\" policies. Many people think this is wrong.\nIn the 1990s, the World Bank and the IMF made the Washington Consensus. Many now agree that the Washington Consensus looked too much at the growth of GDP, and not enough how long the growth lasted or whether growth was even good at all.\nSome studies show that the World Bank has \"increased\" poverty and been bad for the environment, public health and cultural diversity. Some critics also say that the World Bank has always supported Neoliberalism, forcing developing countries to follow rules which have been damaging.\nPeople also say that the World Bank pushes U.S. or Western interests in certain parts of the world. Even South American nations have established the Bank of the South in order to cut down on US influence there. The fact that the President is always a citizen of the United States, nominated by the President of the United States makes some people unhappy. The US has just over 16% of the shares in the bank; some people say this makes the voting unfair because they have too much power, as decisions only happen if the countries that support it have 85% of the bank's shares. The World Bank also does not need to explain what it does to anyone.\nA lot of the criticism has led to protesting. The World Bank Oslo 2002 Protests, the October Rebellion, and the Battle of Seattle are among the protests that have happened. Such demonstrations are held all over the world, even amongst the Brazilian Kayapo people.\nIn 2008, a World Bank report found that biofuels had driven food prices up 75%. This was important news, but it was never published. Officials said that they thought it because George W. Bush would be embarrassed.\nKnowledge production.\nThe World Bank has been criticised for the way it carries out \u201cthe production, accumulation, circulation and functioning\u201d of knowledge. The Bank\u2019s production of knowledge has become important to explain why big loans are given out. The Bank uses many scientists around the world, organisations and other people to help make data and strategies.\u201d. The information is created to stop people looking too closely at what the Bank does. The only knowledge system that is used is the Western one, meaning that the systems that other countries used are put aside and the Western one forced in. Knowledge production has become very useful for the Bank, which plans carefully how to use it to explain why they focus on development.\nStructural adjustment.\nThe effect of structural adjustment policies on poor countries has been one of the most important criticisms of the World Bank. The oil crisis in the late 1970s made many countries have serious money issues. The World Bank decided that it would help by giving out special loans called \"structural adjustment loans\", which meant the policies of the country had to be changed to reduce inflation. Some of these policies included encouraging production and investment, changing exchange rates and changing the way government resources were used. These were most effective in countries where these policies could be implemented easily. For some countries, especially in Africa, inflation became worse. Stopping poverty was not part of these loans, so the poor usually became poorer because the governments were told to spend less money and raise food prices.\nBy the late 1980s, people realised that structural adjustment policies were worsening life for the world\u2019s poor. The World Bank changed structural adjustment loans after that. In 1999, the World Bank and the IMF introduced the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper to replace structural adjustment loans. Some people say that the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper approach is just another way of using structural adjustment policies as it continues to do a lot of the same things. Neither way has solved the problems of why some countries are so poor. By making some countries owe others money, many believe that the World Bank has taken over those countries' power to choose how they run their economy.\nSovereign immunity.\nDespite the goals of \u201cgood governance and anti-corruption\u2033 the World Bank needs sovereign immunity from countries it deals with. Sovereign immunity means nothing the World Bank does can be punished. Some people say sovereign immunity is a \u201cshield which [The World Bank] wants resort to, for escaping accountability and security by the people.\u201d Because the United States has veto power, it is the only country that can stop the World Bank from doing things it doesn't like.\nEnvironmental strategy.\nThe World Bank's work on a way to fix climate change and environmental threats has also been criticized. \nPeople say it has no real vision and purpose, and a limited focus on only what it can do in global and regional governance. People also say it ignores some specific issues in certain parts of the world, like. issues of rights to food and land, and sustainable land use. Critics have also seen that only 1% of the World Bank's lending goes to the environmental sector.\nEnvironmentalists are asking the Bank to stop worldwide support for coal plants and other things that pollute the environment. For instance, many people have criticized the 2010 decision of the World Bank's approval for a $3.75 billion loan to build the world\u2019s 4th largest coal-fired power plant in South Africa. The plant will increase coal mining, and cause more pollution."}

Most stars have only very small differences in brightness, like the Sun. But some stars can vary hugely.\nThere are generally two types of variable stars:\nIntrinsic variable stars.\nThere are a number of different types of variable stars.\nEruptive variables.\nProtostars.\nProtostars are young objects that have not yet completed the process of contraction from a gas nebula to a true star. Most protostars show irregular brightness variations.\nGiants and Supergiants.\nLarge stars lose their matter relatively easily. Variability due to eruptions and mass loss is fairly common among giants and supergiants.\nCataclysmic or explosive stars.\nSupernovae are the most dramatic type of events in the universe. A supernova can briefly emit as much energy as an entire galaxy, brightening by more than 20 magnitudes (over one hundred million times brighter). Supernovae result from the death of an extremely massive star, many times heavier than the Sun.\nThe supernova explosion is caused by a white dwarf or a star core reaching a certain mass/density limit, the Chandrasekhar limit. Then the star collapses in a fraction of a second. This collapse \"bounces\" and causes the star to explode and emit an enormous amount of energy. \nThe outer layers of these stars are blown away at speeds of many thousands of kilometers an hour. The expelled matter may form nebulae called \"supernova remnants\". A well-known example of such a nebula is the Crab Nebula, left over from a supernova that was observed in China and North America in 1054. The core of the star or the white dwarf may either become a neutron star (generally a pulsar) or disintegrate completely in the explosion.\nA supernova may also result from mass transfer onto a white dwarf from a star companion in a double star system. The infalling matter pushes the white dwarf over the Chandrasekhar limit. The absolute luminosity of this type of supernova can be calculated from its light curve, so these explosions can be used to fix the distance to other galaxies. One of the most studied supernovae is SN 1987A in the Large Magellanic Cloud."}

He was elected as the MSP for Glasgow Anniesland. Although Scottish Labour won the most seats, they did not have a majority in Parliament to allow them to form an Executive without the help of a smaller party. A deal was agreed with the Scottish Liberal Democrats to work together, with Dewar agreeing to their demand for the abolition of up-front tuition fees for university students.\nOn 13 May, Dewar was nominated as First Minister, and was officially appointed by the Queen on 17 May at a ceremony in the Palace of Holyroodhouse. He later travelled to the Court of Session to be sworn in by the Lord President and receive the Great Seal of Scotland.\nOn 16 June, Dewar set out the legislative programme for the Executive which included: an Education bill to improve standards in Scottish schools; land reform to give right of access to the countryside, a bill to abolish the feudal system of land tenure; and a bill to establish National Parks in Scotland.\nDeath and funeral.\nIn April 2000, Dewar was admitted to hospital for tests on his heart, following a previous test where a minor irregularity was discovered. In May 2000, he later had surgery to repair a leaking heart valve, and was forced to take a three month break from Parliament, with Deputy First Minister, Jim Wallace taking over as Acting First Minister. He returned to work on 14 August 2000.\nDewar dealt with the exams results fiasco and the lorry drivers strike, and attended the Labour party conference in Brighton in September, but at the end of September told the historian Tom Devine in Dublin that if there was no surge of the energy of old, he would have to reappraise the situation within a few months time.\nOn 10 October 2000 around lunchtime, Dewar sustained a fall. He seemed fine at first but later that day suffered a massive brain hemorrhage which was possibly triggered by the medication he was taking after the heart surgery. Donald Dewar died the following day, at 12.18pm, in Edinburgh's Western General Hospital. He was 63 years old.\nDewar's funeral service was held at Glasgow Cathedral, amid scenes of mourning unknown for a politician in Scotland's largest city. He was cremated on 18 October 2000, and his ashes were scattered at Lochgilphead.\n\"Although he has become something of a political legend, Donald would have abhorred any attempt to turn him into some kind of secular saint. He would have been horrified at a Diana-style out-pouring of synthetic grief at his untimely death.\" -- Iain MacWhirter, Sunday Herald, 15 October 2000."}

The Hunza valley is at an elevation of . The territory of Hunza is about . Karimabad (formerly called Baltit) is the main town which is also a very popular tourist destination in Pakistan because of the spectacular scenery of the surrounding mountains like Rakaposhi, Ultar Sar, Bojahagur Duanasir II, Ghenta Peak, Hunza Peak, Darmyani Peak, and Bublimating (Ladyfinger Peak), all or higher.\nHunza is the northern most district of Pakistan. The district touches the borders of China &amp; Afghanistan. Hunza valley is a combination of a number of smaller sub-valleys. Most famous of these sub-valleys are Shimshal, Chipursan, Misgar and Avgarch valleys. The main town of Hunza valley with all the government offices is the Aliabad and is located on main Karakoram Highway or N-35. While Karimabad is a more established tourist attraction. Hunza valley is located on the left banks of River Hunza while going north from Gilgit.\nThere are two parts of the valley.\nAltit Fort.\nAltit Fort is the oldest fort in the hunza valley. It was constructed some 1100 years ago and overlooks Hunza River. The primary goal of constructing this fort was to keep an eye over invaders from Hunzo-bar or Nagar. There was a great rivalry between the rulers and people of Hunza &amp; Nagar in the older times. Invaders from both valleys often attacked each others. Altit Fort was built to defend the people of Hunza from them. It was also the residence of the ruler of Hunza and his family. It can also be seen from main Karakoram Highway or N-35 after crossing Ganish. The fort can be accessed via a road from karimabad. The entry ticket for Pakistanis is PKR 400 while for foreigners is PKR 1000 for the fort. The fort offers views of the Royal Garden and a local musical school is also functioning within the premises. There is also an amazing but expensive restaurant run by ladies within the premises of the fort.\nthumb\nBaltit Fort.\nBaltit Fort is an 800 years old fort within Karimabad town of Hunza district. The fort was built for the protection of the ruler of Hunza and his family and also has a goal of deep defense. The fort is built on the same architectural style as of the Altit Fort. The fort can be accessed on foot from karimabad bazar. It would take you around 20 mins to reach the fort from the bazar via a steep walkway. The entry ticket fees is the same PKR 400 for Pakistanis and PKR 1000 for foreigners. Personally speaking, Baltit Fort offers amazing views of the Hunza &amp; Nagar districts from height.\nEagle\u2019s Nest or Duikar.\nEagle\u2019s Nest or Duikar is another great tourist attraction in the Hunza valley. Official name of the area is Duikar while it has some natural stones in Eagle shape, hence it got the name of Eagle\u2019s nest. The attraction offers unique views of Golden Peak, Diran Peak, Rakaposhi Peak, Lady Finger Peak, Ultar Peak, Hunza &amp; Nagar districts. The attraction is located at an altitude of 3000 meters.

These are four tunnels on the karakoram highway. After a massive landsliding on Attabad villages, river hunza was stopped at this point, ultimately destructing attabad villages and part of Karakoram Highway. This created a water reservoir, which is now known as Attabad Lake or Shishkat Lake. Immediately after creation of this lake, the transportation was resumed via a boat service on this patch of Karakoram Highway between Pakistan &amp; China. The construction work on creating tunnels through the mountains was immediately started. The tunnels were inaugurated in 2015. The tunnels are one of the largest in Pakistan. Attabad Lake is famous for its turquoise waters. Private water sports and boating facilities are also active in the lake.\nGulmit.\nGulmit village is the largest settlement in the Gojal area.

The suspension bridge is considered one the most iconic and dangerous bridges in the world. Personally, I think Passu bridge is way more dangerous than this.\nBorith lake.\nBorith lake is the Pakistan\u2019s highest salt water lake. The lake is located within the Borith village on karakoram highway. The lake is easily accessible via a car track or you can hike to the lake.

Administratively there are two Tehsils in Nagar namely Nagar-1 and Nagar-2 of Gilgit District.\nNagar was an independent principality for 1200 years. The British gained control of Nagar during a battle at place of Nilt (Jangir-e-Laye) between 1889 and 1892. Nagarkutch fought bravely but was defeated due to lack of weapons. The Tham (Chief) of that time, Azur Khan, was sent in exile to Kashmir.\nHunza was previously under the domination of Nagar and collectively called \"Buroshall\" and their capital was \"Capal Dongs\".

The people of Nagar and Hunza were ruled by a local Mir for more than 1200 years, which came to an end in 1974.

It ran from 19:00 to about 04:00 each night, in order to share terrestrial digital bandwidth with the CBBC channel. Unlike its commercial rivals, 90% of BBC Three's output is from the United Kingdom and other European Union countries. 80% is original, covering all genres from current affairs, to drama, to comedy to animation.\nBBC Three had a unique '60 second news' format. This was adopted so that operation of the channel could be completely automated, without the complication of dealing with variable length live news broadcasts. The current controller of the station is Danny Cohen, and the Head of Scheduling is Dan McGolpin.\nBBC Three closed as a standard television channel on 16 February 2016. On the same day BBC Three launched on BBC iPlayer as an online only service.\nThe BBC is planning to relaunch BBC Three's television channel in January 2022.\nLaunch.\nBBC Three was the successor to the similar BBC Choice channel and was launched on 9 February 2003. It was launched by Stuart Murphy, who previously ran BBC Choice.\nProgramming.\nSome of the programmes that have appeared for their first showing on BBC Three include EastEnders (2003), Little Britain (October 2004), Doctor Who Confidential (2005), and Torchwood (2006), The Apprentice, You're Fired! (2006). When the first episode of Torchwood was launched in October 2006 on BBC Three, 2.4 million people watched it. This broke BBC Three's previous record of 1.8 million. The second episode attracted an equally impressive 2.3 million viewers, and boosted BBC Three to a 3.5% share of multichannel viewing that evening, compared to the network's three-month Sunday average of 0.9%.\nThe channel featured hourly news updates called \"60 Seconds\", which included the top news, sport and entertainment stories. It was presented in a cheeky, relaxed style in keeping with the rest of the channel. As part of the BBC's discussions with the government in whether the channel could launch originally, a longer news programme had been promised to provide a daily section of news and current affairs. \"The News Show\", as it came to be called upon launch was later rebranded \"The 7 O'Clock News\". However, the BBC discontinued the bulletin in 2005, claiming that in fact, the programme's audiences were minuscule and the output was provided elsewhere on the BBC.\nViewing.\n The channel was aimed at 25\u201334-year olds, and competes with other digital channels including ITV2 and E4.\nIts share of the audience during its transmission hours was 2.6% among 25\u201334-year olds, and 1.7% among all individuals. BARB, the official ratings agency, averages out BBC Three's viewing figures over 24 hours even though the channel only broadcasted in the evenings, giving a distorted sense of the channel's viewership. Despite several official complaints from the BBC, BARB continued to publish figures which the BBC argued were unrepresentative. Nine million people watched BBC Three every week.\nAwards.\nThe channel had critical and popular successes, winning more awards in its four-year history than its commercial rivals (Sky One, Living, E4, ITV2, Five and Paramount Comedy Channel) have won in their combined 25-year history. In total BBC Three had won 7 BAFTA awards, 5 British Comedy Awards, 15 Royal Television Society Awards and 5 Rose d'Or Awards since the channel was launched in February 2003. Most recently, it won \"Broadcast Magazine\"'s \"Digital Channel of the Year\" Award for Best General Entertainment Channel, and MGEITF Non Terrestrial Channel of the Year.\nAll three of BBC Three's dramas produced in 2004 (\"Outlaws\", \"Bodies\" and \"Conviction\") received BAFTA nominations, as did classical music show \"Flashmob The Opera\".\nIn 2008, BBC Three's Gavin and Stacey won the BAFTA audience award and the best comedy performance award was awarded to James Corden for his part.\nCriticism.\nThe channel had also come in for criticism from several corners, the most prominent of which are some of the BBC's long-standing presenters. These include John Humphrys, who argued that BBC Three and BBC Four should be shut down in the face of budget cuts to Radio 4's Today programme, which he presents, John Sweeney of Panorama, and Jeremy Paxman are among other journalists have also criticised the channel and its content.\nProposed earlier start time for BBC Three.\nBBC Vision director Jana Bennett confirmed in an interview for Broadcast magazine in May 2008 that the BBC Trust has been petitioned to change the start of transmission time from the current time of 7pm each evening to earlier in the afternoon.\nBennett said that some of the extra hours would be given over to BBC Switch the BBC's teen programming strand."}

However, they did not claim this title for themselves.\nBahadur Shah II.\nAlthough the Mughal dynasty ruled over most of the Indian subcontinent from the 16th century onwards, they simply used the title Shahanshah (considered in the West to be the same as \"emperor\"). However dring the Indian rebellion of 1857 against the British, the rebel sepoys seized Delhi and called the Mughal Bahadur Shah II as \"Shahanshah-e-Hind,\" or Emperor of India. After the Brtish defeated the rebels, he was captured and was forced to live in Rangoon, Burma in 1858, this ended the rule of the Mughals.\nBritish monarchs.\nAfter the Mughal Emperor ended by the British East India Company, the title \"Empress of India\" was taken by Queen Victoria from 1 May 1876. \nPrime Minister Benjamin Disraeli is usually credited with creating the title for her. Also, the title was created when it became evident that Queen Victoria's daughter, Victoria, Princess Royal, would become an empress when her husband ascended the German imperial throne, many people thought it was wrong for the daughter to be an empress while her mother was just a Queen.\nWhen Victoria died, and her son Edward VII ascended the throne, his title became \"Emperor of India\". The title continued until India and Pakistan became independent from the United Kingdom at midnight on 14/15 August 1947.\nWhen signing their name for Indian business, a British King-Emperor or the Queen-Empress used the initials \"R\u00a0I\" (\"Rex/Regina Imperator/Imperatrix\") or the shorter version \"Ind. Imp.\" (\"Indiae Imperator/Imperatrix\") after their name. This was also used on many British coins, including some 1948 coins of George VI.\nKing of India and Pakistan.\nGeorge VI continued to hold the title King of India for two years during the short Governor-Generalships of Lord Mountbatten and of C. Rajagopalachari until India became a republic on 26 January 1950. George VI remained as King of the United Kingdom and King of Pakistan until his death in 1952. Pakistan became a republic on 23 March 1956, Elizabeth II was Queen of Pakistan for four years."}

McMillan.\nIn 1980, he changed several thousand atoms of bismuth into gold at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. His experimental technique, using nuclear physics, was able to remove protons and neutrons from the bismuth atom. Seaborg's techique would have cost too much money to make of gold, but his work is the closest to the mythical Philosopher's Stone.\nSeaborg worked at the Manhattan Project during World War II. He studied the chemical properties of plutonium as a part of the secret war research.\nHe served as Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission and was a professor at the University of California, Berkeley.\nSeaborg was the principal or co-discoverer of ten elements: plutonium, americium, curium, berkelium, californium, einsteinium, fermium, mendelevium, nobelium and element 106, which was named seaborgium in his honor while he was still living. He also developed more than 100 atomic isotopes. Early in his career, Seaborg was a pioneer in nuclear medicine and developed many isotopes of elements that helped to diagnose and treat diseases. For example, he studied iodine-131, which is used in the treatment of thyroid disease. He developed the actinide concept which placed the actinide series beneath the lanthanide series on the periodic table. Seaborg also proposed the placement of super-heavy elements in the transactinide and superactinide series."}

These are also possible adaptations to avoiding damage while fighting.\nThe honey badger has short and sturdy legs, with five toes on each foot. The feet have very strong claws, which are short on the hind legs and very long on the forelimbs. It is a partially plantigrade animal whose soles are thickly padded and naked up to the wrists. The tail is short and is covered in long hairs, except below the base.\nAdults are in shoulder height and 68\u201375\u00a0cm in body length, with females being smaller than males. Males weigh while females weigh 9.1\u00a0kg.\nThe honey badger has an anal pouch, a trait shared with hyenas. The smell of the pouch is said to be \"suffocating\", and may help calm bees when raiding beehives.\nFur.\nIts winter fur is long, with some coarse, bristle-like hairs. There are fewer hairs on the side, belly, and groin. The summer fur is shorter and has even fewer hairs, with the belly being half bare. The sides of the heads and lower body are pure black in colour. A large white band covers their upper bodies, beginning from the top of their heads down to the base of their tails.\nHabits.\nHoney badgers live alone in self-dug holes. They are good diggers, being able to dig tunnels into hard ground in 10\u00a0minutes. These burrows always only have one passage and a nesting chamber and are usually not large, about 1\u20133\u00a0metres long. They do not put bedding in the nesting chamber. Although they usually dig their own burrows, they may take over aardvark and warthog holes that are no longer being used, or termite mounds.\nHoney badgers are smart animals and are one of few species able to use tools. In the 1997 documentary series \"Land of the Tiger\", a honey badger in India was filmed using a tool; the animal rolled a log and stood on it to reach a kingfisher fledgling stuck up in the roots coming from the ceiling in an underground cave.\nHoney badgers are fearless and tough animals. They are known to savagely attack their enemies when they cannot escape. They are tireless in combat and can wear out much larger animals in fights. The fact that most predators do not want to hunt honey badgers has led to the theory that the countershaded coats of cheetah kittens evolved to look like the honey badger in order to keep predators away. This would be an example of mimicry.\nThe voice of the honey badger is a hoarse \"khrya-ya-ya-ya\" sound. When mating, males make loud grunting sounds. Cubs vocalise through whines. When attacked by dogs, honey badgers scream like bear cubs.&lt;ref name=\"p464/5\"&gt;Pocock R.I. 1941. \"Fauna of British India: Mammals\", volume 2. London: Taylor and Francis.&lt;/ref&gt;\nDiet.\nHoney badgers have the least specialised diet among mustelids. In undeveloped areas, honey badgers may hunt at any time of the day, though they become nocturnal in places with high human populations. When hunting, honey badgers trot with their fore-toes turned in, moving at the same speed as a young man. Despite their name, honey badgers mostly eat meat, and will take any sort of animal food at hand, including carrion, small rodents, birds, eggs, insects, lizards, tortoises and frogs. They will eat fruit and vegetables such as berries, roots and bulbs.\nThey may hunt frogs and rodents such as gerbils and ground squirrels by digging them out of their burrows. Honey badgers are able to feed on tortoises without difficulty, due to their powerful jaws. They kill and eat snakes, even highly venomous or large ones. They have dug up human corpses in India.&lt;ref name=\"p464/52\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They devour all parts of their prey, including skin, hair, feathers, flesh and bones, holding their food down with their forepaws. When seeking vegetable food, they lift stones or tear bark from trees.\nRange.\nThe species can be found through most of Sub-Saharan Africa from the Western Cape, South Africa, to southern Morocco and southwestern Algeria. Outside Africa it lives through Arabia, Iran and western Asia to Turkmenistan and the Indian subcontinent.\nRelationships with humans.\nHoney badgers often kill chickens that humans are raising for food. Because of their strength and persistence, they are difficult to keep away. They are known to rip thick planks from hen-houses or burrow underneath stone foundations.\nBecause of their tough, loose skin, honey badgers are difficult to kill with dogs. Their skin is hard to get through, and its looseness allows them to twist and turn on their attackers when held. The only safe grip on a honey badger is on the back of the neck. The skin is also tough enough to resist several machete blows. The only sure way of killing them quickly is through a blow to the skull with a club or a shot to the head with a powerful rifle, as their skin is almost proof against arrows and spears."}

It ranges from Egypt in the west to China in the east, and it is common in India.\nThe jungle cat is the largest remaining species of the wild cat genus \"Felis\". It is 20 to 37 inches in body length (50 to 97\u00a0cm), with a 8 to 12 inch tail (20 to 31\u00a0cm).\nTrue to Bergmann's rule, the felid is largest at the northern limits of its range and becomes smaller-bodied closer to the tropics.\nThey live in savannas, tropical dry forests and reedbeds along rivers and lakes in the lowlands, but, despite the name, are not found in rainforests. Although they are adaptable animals, being found even in dry steppe, they prefer wetland environments with tall grasses or reeds in which to hide.\nDistribution.\nThe jungle cat lives in the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, central and Southeast Asia, Sri Lanka and in southern China. The jungle cat lives in places with lots of water and thick vegetation, such as swamps, wetlands, littoral and riparian areas, grasslands and shrub. It commonly lives in agricultural lands, such as fields of bean and sugarcane, in its range. It has often been seen near humans. It can even live in places with little vegetation. It is rare in places with lots of snow. Historical records show that it lives in altitudes of 2,310 m (7,580\u00a0ft) in the Himalayas. It does not like to live in rainforests and woodlands.\nIn Turkey, it has been recorded in wetlands near Manavgat, in the Akyatan Lagoon on the southern coast and near Lake E\u011firdir. In Palestine, it was recorded in the Nablus, Ramallah, Jericho and Jerusalem.\nIn Iran, it lives in a lot of habitat. It lives from plains and agriculture lands to mountains at altitudes of 45 to 4,178 m (148 to 13,707\u00a0ft) in at least 23 of 31 provinces of Iran. In Pakistan, it was photographed in Haripur, Dera Ismail Khan, Sialkot Districts and Langh Lake Wildlife Sanctuary.\nIn India, it is the most common small wild cat. In Nepal, it was recorded in alpine habitat at altitudes of 3,000\u20133,300 m (9,800\u201310,800\u00a0ft) in Annapurna Conservation Area.\nA few jungle cat mummies were found among the cats in ancient Egypt.\nFeeding.\nThe jungle cat is mostly a carnivore. It likes to eat small mammals like gerbils, hares and rodents. It also hunts birds, fish, frogs, insects and small snakes. Its prey usually weighs less than 1\u00a0kg (2.2\u00a0lb). Sometimes, it eats mammals as large as young gazelles. The jungle cat is a partial omnivore. It eats fruits, especially in winter.\nThe jungle cat hunts by stalking its prey. It then chases its prey. The jungle cats ears helps the jungle cat to know where its prey is. It uses different ways to catch prey. Like the caracal, the jungle cat can jump high into the air to catch birds. It is a great climber. The jungle cat can run up to 32\u00a0km/h (20\u00a0mph). It is a good swimmer. It can swim up to 1.5\u00a0km (0.93\u00a0mi) in water. It can jump into water to catch fish."}

It is distributed over African and Asian deserts. Sometimes people call it \"desert cat,\" but that is really the name of a different animal. The sand cat does live in deserts, even the Sahara and Arabian Desert. It is also found in Iran and Pakistan. In zoos, this cat can live for up to 13 years.\nThe sand cat is about 50 cm long, not including the tail. The tail is 30 cm long and has rings on it. It weighs about 2.7 kg (6 lbs). It has sand-colored fur and a wide head with ears that can point up, out or down. There is fur on its paws so that the hot sand does not hurt it.\nThis cat finds shade or digs a burrow during the day and hides from the sunlight underground. It only lives in places where the sand or dirt is loose enough for it to dig. The sand cat looks for food at night. It eats rodents, lizards and insects. It can even hunt and kill snakes. It does not drink water, taking all its water from eating prey. It does not need to go near watering holes, so it can avoid bigger predators that might hurt it. Wolves, snakes, large birds and humans can hurt this cat.\nThe sand cat does not fight with other sand cats over territory. Sometimes sand cats will take turns in the same burrow, but they will not share it at the same time. The sand cat lives alone except when looking for mates and when mothers are raising cubs.\nDistribution.\nThe sand cat lives in both sandy and stony deserts. It prefers flat terrain with little grass or small bush. It avoids bare and moving sand dunes, where there is little prey. Sand cats live in the Moroccan Sahara, Algeria, Mali, T\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 Desert, Egypt, Sinai peninsula, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Jordan, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan.\nDiet.\nIn the T\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9 Desert, sand cats were seen hunting small rodents, young cape hare. They were also seen hunting greater hoopoe lark, desert monitor, sandfish, and venomous vipers. If they caught more than they could eat, they buried some to eat later.\nIn Israel, pieces of the Egyptian spiny-tailed lizards were found near burrows used by sand cats. They were seen hunting jirds, Cairo spiny mouse, desert lark, and small reptiles. In central Iran, pieces of the Blanford's jerboa and Balochistan gerbil were found around the dens of sand cats."}

With 321 sections and \n10 schedules, this was the longest act passed by British Parliament so far and was later split into two parts viz. Government of India Act, 1935 and Government of Burma Act, 1935.The demand for constitutional reforms in india has been quite old..\nThe Government of India Act, 1935 derived material from four key sources viz. Report of the Simon Commission, discussions at the Third Round Table Conference, the White Paper of 1933 and the reports of the Joint select committees. This act ended the system of dyarchy introduced by the Government of India Act 1919, and provided for establishment of a Federation of India to be made up of provinces of British India and some or all of the Princely states. However, the federation never came into being as the required number of princely states did not join it.\nIt was the last constitution of British India which split Burma from it. It lasted until 1947, when British territory was split into Pakistan and India.\nSalient Features of the Act.\nSalient Features of the Government of India Act 1935 were as follows:\nAll India Federation.\nThe proposed all India federation included 11 provinces of British India, 6 Chief Commissioners Provinces and those princely states who might accede to the federation. For princely states, the accession to the Federation was voluntary. The federation could not be established until:\nThe term on which a state joined the Federation were to be laid down in the Instrument of Accession. Joining the federation was compulsory for the British Provinces and chief commissioners provinces.\nDyarchy at Centre.\nUnder this act, the executive authority of the centre was vested in the Governor General on behalf of the Crown. The federal subjects were divided into two fold categories of \"Reserved\" and \"Transferred\" subjects. The Reserved list comprised of subjects such as administration of Defense, External affairs, ecclesiastical affairs and matters related to tribal areas. These subjects were to administered by Governor General in his discretion with the help of three counselors appointed by him. \"They were not responsible to legislative\".\nThe administration of the transferred subjects was to be done by Governor General on advice of the Council of Ministers whose number could not exceed 10. The council of ministers had to command the confidence of legislature. However, the Governor General could act on contrary to the advice of the Council of Ministers if any of his \u2018special responsibilities\u2019 was involved in such act. However, in that case {when an act involved special responsibilities}, the Governor General would work under the control and direction of the Secretary of State.\nFurther, the Governor General was also responsible for the coordination of work between the two wings and for encouraging joint deliberations between the counselors and the ministers.\nFederal Legislature.\nThe bicameral federal legislature would be consisted of two houses viz. Council of states and Federal Assembly.\nCouncil of States.\nThe Council of States was to be upper house and a permanent body with one third of its membership retiring every 3rd year. It was to be composed of 260 members of which 156 were to be representatives of British India while 104 of the Indian states.\nRepresentatives of British India.\nThe 150 out of 156 representatives of British India were to be elected on communal basis while six were to be nominated by Governor General from amongst women, minorities and depressed classes. Further, the seats which were reserved for Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs had to be filled via direct election while those reserved for Europeans, Anglo-Indians, Indian Christians and Depressed Classes were to be filled by Indirect election.\nRepresentatives of Princely state.\nThe distribution of the seats among states was on their relative importance and not population. The representatives of the princely states would be nominated by rulers.\nFederal Assembly.\nThe Federal Assembly was the lower house with a tenure of five years. It was to be made of 375 members who which 250 representatives of British India and not more than 125 members from princely states. While the seats reserved for princely states were to be filled by nominated members, the provinces were given different numbers of seats. Election to the Federal assembly was to be indirect. The term of the assembly was five years but it could be dissolved earlier also.\n8i8*\nProvincial Autonomy.\nThe most remarkable feature of the Act was the provincial autonomy. With the abolition of Dyarchy at provinces, the entire provincial administration was instructed to the responsible ministers who were controlled and removed by the provincial legislatures.\nThe provincial autonomy means two things. First, the Provincial Governments were wholly, responsible to the provincial legislatures and secondly, provinces, were free from outside control and interference in a large number of matters. Thus, in the provincial sphere, the Act of 1935 made a fundamental departure from the act of 1919.\nThe act divided the powers between the Centre and provinces in terms of three list-Federal List (for Centre, with 59 items), Provincial List (for Provinces, with 54 items), and Concurrent list (for both, with 36 items). Residuary powers were given to the Viceroy.\nThe degree of autonomy introduced at the provincial level was subject to important limitations: the provincial Governors retained important reserve powers, and the British authorities also retained a right to suspend responsible government.\nSafeguards and Reservations.\nA controversial feature of the Government of India Act, 1935 was the safeguards and reservations provided in the Act, would serve as checks and limitations on such undesirable tendencies which might lead to the failure of the responsible government in India. A plea was given that those safeguards and reservations were necessary for the interests of the country. They were imposed either on the exercise of powers by the Government of India on of the states.\nIt further extended the principle of communal electorate for depressed class (Scheduled castes) women and labour.\nEstablishment of Federal Court.\nThe Government of India Act, 1935 provided for the establishment of Federal Court to interpret the Act and adjudicate disputes relating to the federal matters. It provided that the Federal Courts should consist of one Chief justice and not more than six judges.\nThe Federal Court was given exclusive original jurisdiction to decide disputes between the Centre and constituent Units. The provision was made for filing of appeals from High Courts to the Federal Court and from Federal Court to the Privy Council. The Federal Court also had jurisdiction to grant Special Leave to Appeal and for such appeals a certificate of the High Court was essential.\nAbolition of Indian Council.\nIt abolished the council of India, established by the Government of India Act of 1858. The secretary of state for India was provided with a team of advisors in its place.\nExtension of Franchise.\nThe act extended the franchise. This act introduced for the first time the direct elections. About 10% of the total population got the voting rights.\nFederal Railway Authority.\nThe GOI act 1935 vested the control of Railway in a new authority called Federal Railway Authority, which had seven members and was free from control of ministers and councillors. The members of this authority reported directly to Governor General. The idea was to assure the British Stakeholders of the railways that their investment was safe.\nReorganization of the provinces.\nThe partial reorganization of the provinces included separation of Sind from Bombay, Splitting Bihar and Orissa into separate provinces, Complete separation of Burma from India, detachment of Aden from India and establishing as a separate colony.\nSeparation of Burma.\nThe Government of India Act 1935 contemplated the Federation of the British Indian Provinces and Indian States. But for Burma, there was a separate set of Events. Burma was proposed to be separated in pursuance of the recommendation of the Indian Statutory (Simon Commission) whose proposal was accepted in principle by the Government. Consequently a Burma Round Table Conference was held in London in 1932. In 1935, Burma Act was passed and separation of Burma actually took place in 1937. The Government of India Act 1935 also provided a new Burma Office, in preparation for the establishment of Burma as a separate colony, but the same Secretary of State headed both Departments and was styled the Secretary of State for India and Burma. The first secretary of state for India and Burma was Lord Dundas.\nImplications of the GOI Act 1935.\nThe proposal for setting up of the Federation of India did not materialize because the act proposed that federation could come into existence only if as many princely states (which had been given option to join or not to join) were entitled to one half of the states seats in the upper house of the federal legislature. Due to this, Central Government in India continued to be governed by the provision of the Act of 1919(Montague-Chelmsford Reforms).However, some parts of the GOI Act 1935 came into force for example : the Federal Bank (The Reserve Bank of India) and the Federal Court were established in 1935 and 1937 respectively. The other parts of the Act, particularly provincial Autonomy, came into force on 1st April 1937. The first elections under the Act were also held in 1937.\nWhat happened to Dominion status?\nThe Simon commission had promised \u2018Dominion Status\u2019 for India in 1929 , but the Government of India Act did not confer it.

They are mainly settled in Abbottabad District and the Murree Hills, Along with Tehsil Kahuta and in District Rawalpindi of Punjab Province.They are also found in District Haripur and Mansehra of Hazara Division of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province. Apart from Abbottabad and Murree, there are large populations of Dhund Abbasis living in the Bagh District and Muzaffarabad District of Azad Kashmir. The tribe speaks the \"Dhundi-Kairlali\" hill dialect of Pahari-Pothwari. \nThe word Dhund was an honorary name given to one of their forefathers. To Download the pdf book related to Dhund Abbasi's history, click here \nOrigins.\nThe tribe traces its roots back to Al-\u2018Abbas ibn \u2018Abd al-Muttalib (Uncle of Prophet Mohammad PBUH). The Dhund Abbasis are descendents of the Abbasid dynasty. The descendants of Al-\u2018Abbas ibn \u2018Abd al-Muttalib assumed authority over the muslim empire from the Umayyads in 750 CE and were known as the Abbasids, this dynasty governed for 500 years from Baghdad, Iraq. The rule of the Abbasids extended eastwards across Afghanistan into the South Asian subcontinent, covering the eastern part of modern-day Pakistan. \nTheir Ancestor Sardar Zorab Khan Abbasi (1030\u00a0AD) who was Governer General (Haki'm e Suba) &amp; Commander of Forces in Hirat, Afghanistan during the reign of Qali Qutab Shah (Wal'ie Hirat) of Ghaznavid Empire,attacked on the state of Kashmir when the Kashmiri King refuse to pay tax to Governer in Khurasaan. When Zorab Khan reached Kashmir along with his Army,King of Kahmir agreed to pay tax and also married his daughter to Sardar Zorab Khan Abbasi,the Abbasid Army Chief. He received great wealth And lands from King of Kashmir and settled in his state as an Ambassador of Abbasid Dynasty. His Grave is in Darkot,a village of Kohota Tehsil of District Rawalpindi. He had only one son named Sardar Akbar Gaei Khan Abbasi who's grave was also next to his father grave. Sultan Akbar had twelve sons by whom his race spreads. This incident was recorded in Miraat Us Salaateen along with family tree of Zorab Khan Abbasi,a fomous hitory book written in Persian in 1836AD. \nSardar Zorab Khan was the son of Taeq Shah also known as Taif Khan who was an Abbasid Commander in Khurasaan during the reign of Abbasi Caliph Al Ta'eh Li'Amr'illah who ruled from 974 to 991 AD. He later joined Subgtageen (Father of Mehmood Ghaznavi) in Khurasaan.\"Khan\" was the title given by Ghaznavid to Abbasid in Khurasaan,as Ghaznavid Empire is affiliated from Abbasid Caliphate having good relationship with Abbasid Caliphs. \nThe word Dhund was an honorary name given to one of their forefather Hazrat Shah Wali Ullah Khan Abbasi by their Spritual Sheikh Hazrat Baha'ud Deen Zakria Multani. Sardar Shah Wali Ullah Khan Abbasi was also a Sufi Saint. He was the Great Grand Son of Sardar Zorab Khan Abbasi. Shah Wali's Brother name was Bhaag Khan (Forefather of Ghayyal Abbasi Tribe) living in Poonch and Bagh Districts of Azad Kashmir, along with Tehsil Kohota and Kotli Sattiyan of District Rawalpindi.\nDhunds are the largest and most prominent tribe of Murree. Historically besides Murree, tribal abode of Dhund Abbasis include parts of present day Islamabad Capital Territory, Tehsil Kahuta and Kotli Sattian of Rawalpindi, District Abbottabad, Haripur and Mansehra of KPK and Deerkot tehsil in the Bagh district of Azad Kashmir.\nBesides there is a large population of Dhund tribe in Kahuta tehsil, who are known as Jasgam. According to Gazetteer Rawalpindi 1893-4 they had thirteen villages in tehsil Kahuta to at the time.\nAccording to Census of India 1881 total population of Dhund Abbasis, excluding Abbasis tribes of Kahsmir, in Rawalpindi and Hazara districts was 32690 of which 18268 lived in Rawalpindi and 14412 in Hazara. Furthermore, Abbasis' constitute overwhelming majority the population of Deerkot tehsil in Bagh district of Azad Kashmir.\nCurrent data is not available but the total population of Dhunds (Abbasi's) in Murree and surrounding areas of Rawalpindi, Islamabad, NWFP and Azad Kashmir would be around 1000,000.\nAlso of the predecessors of the tribe and very reverend Saint Dada (grandfather as he is affectionately called in the area) Peer Mulk Sooraj Khan Abbasi of Potha Sharif was a contemporary of Hazrat Bari Imam, another great saint whose mausoleum is in present day Islamabad. Bari Imam lived in the times of Mughal emperor Jahangir (1606-). This means that the Abbasis were present in considerable numbers at that time."}

Later, after Wycliffe had grown up, he attended Oxford University where he earned an arts degree. He became Master of Balliol College, Oxford in 1361. He was also given a parish in Lincolnshire, which meant he had to give up the position of Master. He lived at Oxford for a large portion of his life, and worked as a rector (a member of the clergy) at local churches. There were many more changes to his life. Some of his ideas were in conflict with those of the Church, but he had the support and protection of John of Gaunt, who was ruling England at the time.\nWycliffe encouraged the Church to benefit the sinners of the world by living a life of poverty, but not everyone agreed with his thoughts and ideas. In some of late writings, he wrote that the Bible was the authority of the Christian religion, not of the church. In 1382 Wycliffe\u2019s followers, the \"lollards\", helped him translate the Bible.

Its headquarters are in Seoul, South Korea.\nHistory.\nNEXON Corp. published their first title, \"Nexus: The Kingdom of the Winds\", in 1996. It was significant because \"Nexus: The Kingdom of the Winds\" was the world's first online graphic game to be published. It brought great success and fame to NEXON over the years. In 1998 NEXON released \"Dark Ages: Online Roleplaying\" which was loosely based on the Korean game \"Legend of Darkness\", using the same server technology. The North American version of \"Dark Ages\" was developed by David Kennerly\nNEXON Corp. has also released a few unsuccessful games to the North American audience in beta form which have since been dropped. They include \"Elemental Saga\", \"QuizQuiz\", \"KartRider\" and \"Elancia\". \"QuizQuiz\" never left beta stage in North America but was later released through the Japanese division of NEXON, NEXON Japan, in a Japanese version. \"QuizQuiz\" has since evolved into the exclusively Korean and Japanese online game \"Q-Play\", while \"Elemental Saga\" was eventually cancelled. NEXON has several games exclusively available to Korean players such as \"Elancia,\" and \"Crazy Arcade\"\nIn 2001, NEXON Inc. released Shattered Galaxy, published through TriSynergy. Though it had previously won the Seumas McNally Grand Prize at the 2001 Independent Games Festival, hosted through the Game Developers Conference, the game floundered when it was released to retail. It was subsequently maintained exclusively through KRU Interactive. Shattered Galaxy itself was a heavily localised and customised version of its Korean parent game, Tactical Commanders.\nIn 2003, Wizet created a hugely successful game called \"MapleStory\", which eventually had clients in South Korea, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, Southeast Asia, North America and Europe and many other places. NEXON then merged with Wizet and jointly control MapleStory.\nIt has produced several online video games, primarily MMORPGs and online action games. Most games have used a 2D perspective, including side-scrolling, top-down, and isometric perspectives. Newer 3D titles are currently being published. Although most games are available for free, various gameplay enhancements can be purchased.\nNEXON is one of the pioneers of the Free to Play model using Virtual Asset Sales to generate revenue. Of a reported $230M in revenue for 2005, 85% was said to be from the sale of virtual items.\nPartnerships.\nNEXON announced that they have made a partnership with Nintendo, though they will continue games for the computer as well. Together, they are currently working on MapleStory DS for Nintendo's handheld console, Nintendo DS.\nOn July 27, 2007, NEXON and Valve made a partnership and announced \"Counter-Strike Online\", a new online version of the world's most popular first person shooting multiplayer game that will be tailored for Asia. Under the terms of the agreement between two studios, NEXON developed and became the exclusive publisher for \"Counter-Strike Online\" in South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, and China.\nNEXON Cash.\nCommonly referred to as 'NX Cash' or just 'NX', the NEXON Cash system was one of the first systems to use the Virtual Asset Sales(VAS) model. The NEXON Cash system was first introduced in the Korean version of MapleStory. The NEXON Cash system allows users to purchase NEXON cash with real money. The NX cash can be used to obtain virtual game items that other users normally wouldn't have. You can buy cards with 5, 10, 25 or 50 dollar values. Players can use this virtual cash to buy items for their characters in games that support a \"Cash Shop.\" The NEXON Cash system has appeared in other games to generate additional funds for their company and keep their games free to play.\nOn January 11, 2007, NEXON America announced the release of \"NEXON Prepaid Cards\". The prepaid cards contain amounts of 10,000 ($10 USD) or 25,000 ($25 USD) NX currency that can be redeemed for NX Cash. As of 15 October, 2008 the prepaid cards are available in North American 7-Eleven stores, Target(Nexon no longer sells these at Target), Duane Reade, CVS/pharmacy, Best Buy, Rite Aid, Longs Drugs, and Blockbuster stores in the US. In Canada, the cards are available at Future Shop, Best Buy, Shoppers Drug Mart, and 7-Eleven.\nRecently MapleStory's Trade Shop was established, in which users can buy game items with real NEXON Cash. However, only NEXON Cash from the prepaid cards can be used in this. In the Trade Shop, players can request items for others to sell and even put up their own items for a certain amount of cash depending on the item's rarity and benefits.\nWizet.\nWizet is a game development studio in Seoul, South Korea, and is popular for its hit game, MapleStory. Wizet developed a franchise system and expanded its services to Japan, China, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, the USA, Europe, and Brazil. Eventually, Wizet reached the global world after having finished developing key features of MapleStory.\nWizet started as a small company with ideas to create yet another massively multiplayer online role-playing game which they achieved by creating MapleStory and with the financial resources from their parent company Nexon, Wizet was capable of developing and even selling merchandise of their popular game MapleStory."}

It is also the desire to do a particular job, especially a religious career like being a priest. For religious people, a vocation is often something they feel God has asked them to do. A vocation is followed more for spiritual or emotional reasons than for money, which is a helpful extra benefit from a vocation but not the reason for it.\nIn Christianity.\nVocations meet a psychological or spiritual need for the worker, and the word can also be used for a job at which a person is gifted. The word \"vocation\" comes from the Latin \"vocare\", meaning \"to call\";. In the past the word meant people's being called to follow Christianity. Martin Luther was the first to use it in the modern way, to describe a life-task.\nChristians believe God has created each person with gifts and talents designed for a reason. Christians can be called to vocations that are faithful to Christian teachings, such as marriage, or to be a priest, monk or nun, chastity as a single person or the general calling to live a life that is right, for the good of the Church or humanity.\nFor those who are not priests or full-time religious people, Protestantism was important in telling them they still had a vocation. Calvinism told people to work hard in life. Calvin said a Christian had two callings; a general calling to serve God and a calling to do a particular job at which they are useful. Protestant ministers in the past said working hard gives God glory. Without something to do, they said people were more likely to sin.\nVocation outside of Christianity.\nThis belief also has an impact outside of religion. Modern occupations seen as vocations are those that involve caring or teaching, such as medicine, nursing, teaching, or veterinary work. Politics, may also be seen as a vocation.

This copy can be used when the original data is changed, or lost. Losing data is common: A 2008 survey found that two thirds of respondents had lost files on their home PC. Another purpose of backing up data is to have a copy that represents an earlier state of the data, before it was changed. Organisations may have rules which state how long data should be kept, and what kinds of data these rules apply to. In many countries there are rules that specify that certain kinds of data need to be kept for a given time. An example of this is the data used for accounting.\nBackups are a simple form of disaster recovery. Even though they are commonly seen as disaster recovery, they should be part of a disaster recovery plan. A disaster recovery plan is a documented set of procedures and tasks to perform to protect the consistency and integrity of a corporate IT system. \nDifferent backup media.\nThere are different types of backup systems that use different kinds of media. Common backup media includes:\nSome of the backup media are portable, and can easily be stored in a safe location. The problem with storing tapes in a bank safe, for example is that they are only available during the opening hours of the bank.\nAnother issue has commonly been the speed of the backup. Media such as digital tapes can store a lot of data, but accessing them is relatively slow. Tapes can only be read or written in sequence, while media such as hard disks or optical drives are basically random access. When data is backed up, its encoding is often changed. This makes it possible to use codes such as Cyclic redundancy checks, which can detect, and sometimes repair an error.\nReasons for doing a backup.\nBackups are usually done for one of the following reasons:\nDifferent types of backup.\nFull backup.\nA full backup copies all of the data. This means that if the main copy of the data is lost, we can bring it all back simply by copying the data back from the backup.\nDifferential backup.\nA differential backup only copies the data that has changed since the last full backup. The reason we do this is that sometimes only a small amount of data has changed since the last full backup; this means we can do a differential backup much more quickly.\nIf someone loses their data, and needs to get it back from a differential backup, they need to use the last full backup, to bring back all of their data. They then need to use the last differential backup to bring back everything that was changed between the full backup and the differential backup.\nIncremental backup.\nAn incremental backup only copies the data that has changed since the last incremental backup. This makes each backup quicker, because we are only copying what has changed since the last backup. To bring the data back, if the main copy of the data is lost, we need the last full backup, as well as all of the incremental backups that have been done since then. This means that bringing data back from an incremental backup is slower and more risky than differential or full backups.\nHow long to keep a backup.\nGrandfather-father-son.\nThe Grandfather-father-son system means that we keep different types of backup for different amounts of time. For example, we might do a backup every day, and keep a week's worth of backups. We might then keep one backup for each week for a month, and one backup from each month for a year. This means that we have a backup of our data from a year ago, so that if we realise we need some data from a long time ago, we have that data available. We also have several copies of our recent data, in case one of them doesn't work."}

It is related to dogs and foxes. It is native to Central, South and Southeast Asia. There are many common names for it: Asiatic wild dog, Indian wild dog, whistling dog, red dog, and mountain wolf.\nIt is most closely related to species in the genus \"Canis\" (dogs and wolves),\nDuring the Pleistocene time period, the dhole lived in Asia, Europe and North America, but 12,000\u201318,000 years ago it died out everywhere except where it lives now.\nThe dhole lives in big, loosely organised groups with several breeding females. The groups usually have about 12 dholes, but some have over 40. It is awake in the day and hunts in groups. It usually eats medium sized to big hoofed animals. In tropical forests, the dhole competes with tigers and leopards, targeting somewhat different prey species, but still with substantial dietary overlap.\nIt is listed as Endangered by the IUCN. The population is getting smaller, and there are probably fewer than 2,500 adults left. The reasons for this are lack of habitat, lack of food, competing with other animals, being hunted, and getting diseases from pet dogs.\nOrigin of \"dhole\".\nIt is unclear where the word \"dhole\" comes from. The word was first used in English by soldier Thomas Williamson in 1808, who said that \"dhole\" is a native name for the animal used by people in Ramghur district, India. In 1827, Charles Hamilton Smith said \"dhole\" comes from a language spoken in 'various parts of the East'. However, Richard Lydekker wrote about 80 years later that the word \"dhole\" was not used by people living where dholes are found. The Merriam-Webster Dictionary suggests the word comes from the Kannada word t\u014d\u1e37a, meaing \"wolf\".\nNaming, taxonomy and evolution.\nPeter Pallas gave dholes the scientific name \"Canis alpinus\" (\"mountain dog\" in Latin) in 1811. He said it lived in Amurland (in Eastern Siberia), to the east of the Lena River. He added that dholes also lived around the Yenisei River and that they sometimes crossed into China. However, dholes may not still live so far north today.\nThe British naturalist Brian Hodgson gave the dhole the scientific name \"Canis primaevus\" (\"original/primitive dog\") and suggested that it was domesticated to become the pet dog. He later noticed how differently the dhole looked compared to other species in the genus \"Canis\" (containing wolves, pet dogs, coyotes and jackals) and put it in its own genus, \"Cuon\", from the Greek word for 'dog'.\nThe first study on the evolution of the dhole was conducted by paleontologist Erich Thenius, who found that dholes descend from an animal which looked like a golden jackal and which lived in the Pleistocene. The earliest known member of the genus \"Cuon\" is \"Cuon majori\", which lived during the Villafranchian period in the early Pleistocene. \"C. majori\" looked more like other species in the genus \"Canis\" than modern dholes.\nEuropean dholes, which lived during the Late Middle Pleistocene, looked like modern dholes except they were much larger, getting to be as big as the gray wolf. Dholes became extinct in most of Europe during the end of the Ice Age, though they may have survived up until the early Holocene in the Iberian Peninsula and in northern Italy. During the Pleistocene, dholes also lived on islands in Asia where they are now extinct, such as Sri Lanka, Borneo and possibly Palawan in the Philippines. Dholes also lived in North America, with fossils having been found in Beringia and Mexico.\nThe dhole's distinctive appearance has made it difficult to say which other species in the dog family it is most closely related to. George Simpson suggested the dhole, African wild dog and bush dog were in the same subfamily (\"Simocyoninae\") because all three species have similar teeth. However, other biologists such as Juliet Clutton-Brock found that dholes' bodies had more similarities with dogs in the genera \"Canis\", the Falkland Islands wolf, and the Arctic fox than the African wild dog and the bush dog. The similarities dholes share with African wild dogs and bush dogs are coincidental.\nSome biologists believe the extinct genus \"Xenocyon\" was the ancestor of the African wild dog and the dhole. However, later studies showed that the dhole and the African wild dog are closely related to other members of the genus \"Canis\". This could be true because according to the zoologist Reginald Pocock, there is a record of a dhole and a golden jackal having babies together in an animal collection in Madras.\nPast breeding with the African wild dog.\nIn 2018, the DNA of all members of the genus \"Canis\" (except for the black-backed jackal and side-striped jackal), the dhole and the African wild dog were compared. It was discovered that long ago, dholes and African wild dogs bred with each other. Today, these species live very far from each other. Thus, the study suggests that dholes may have once lived in the Middle East, where African wild dogs in North Africa came and bred with the dholes. However, no fossils of dholes have been discovered in either the Middle East or North Africa yet.source?\nSubspecies.\nIn the past, ten subspecies of the dholes were recognised. However, since 2005, only three subspecies of dholes have been recognised:\nHowever, studies on the dhole's DNA show little genetic difference between the subspecies. Dholes in Sumatra and Java may have been brough there by humans.\nAppearance.\nDholes have been described as looking like a mixture between a gray wolf and a red fox. They are also \"cat-like\" because of their slender back and legs, and its head has a shape like a hyena's due to the short snout. Dholes have six molars on their lower jaw, unlike other canids which have seven. Dholes have special teeth which help them to eat the meat from their prey quickly, preventing other animals from stealing their food.\nAdult female dholes can weigh from 10 to 17\u00a0kg (22 to 37\u00a0lb), while adult male dholes may weigh from 15 to 21\u00a0kg (33 to 46\u00a0lb). Dholes are 43 to 50\u00a0cm (17 to 22 in) tall at the shoulder and are 91\u00a0cm (3\u00a0ft) long, not including the tail. Dholes have oval-shaped ears.\nDholes are usually reddish, and they may become brighter red in winter. The throat, chest, flanks, and belly and the upper parts of the legs are yellowish. The lower parts of the legs are whitish, with dark brownish bands on the front legs. The tail is very fluffy and black. Dholes have shorter and rougher fur in summer. Dholes may moult (shed their fur to grow new fur) from March to May.\nDholes can whistle, although how they whistle is unknown. They whistle to communicate with the rest of the pack while travelling through thick forest. When attacking prey, they emit screaming KaKaKaKAA sounds. Other sounds include whines, growls, screams, chatterings and yapping cries. Unlike wolves, dholes do not howl or bark.\nWhere dholes live.\nIn Central Asia, dholes mainly live in mountainous areas. Dholes which live to the west are mainly found in meadows and steppes, while dholes which live to the east mainly live in the taiga. Dholes may also go to the seashore. In India, Myanmar, Indochina (Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam), Indonesia and China, dholes mainly live in forests in mountains, although they may sometimes live in grasslands.\nThe dhole might continue to live in the Tunkinsky National Park in southern Siberia near Lake Baikal. Dholes may still live in the Primorsky Krai province in far eastern Russia, where it was considered a rare and endangered species in 2004. There are unconfirmed sightings of dholes in the Pikthsa-Tigrovy Dom protected forest area. Elsewhere in Russia, no sightings of dholes have been reported since the late 1970s.\nDholes are likely extinct in Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.\nIn recent years, one dhole was caught in southern China's Jiangxi district. In 2011 to 2013, local government officials and herders reported the presence of several packs of dholes living in high mountains in the Karakoram region of the Xinjiang Autonomous Region. Dholes have also recently been seen in the Altun Mountains near Tibet. Dholes occur in small numbers in Gansu Province, with sightings of several packs in 2006 and again in 2013-2014.\nDholes still live in Tibet and possibly also in North Korea.\nDholes live in most of India south of the Ganges River. In northeast India, it is present in Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, and West Bengal and in the Indo-Gangetic Plain's Terai region. There are very few dholes in the Himalayas and northwest India. In 2011, dhole packs were recorded by camera traps in the Chitwan National Park.\nIn Bhutan, dholes were poisoned in the 1970s to protect livestock, but the campaign stopped and the population of dholes increased there in the 1990s.\nDholes still live in northeastern and southeastern Bangladesh. However, most sightings of dholes in Bangladesh are of small groups or single dholes, and the dholes in Bangladesh may not continue to breed for long.\nThe presence of dholes in Myanmar was confirmed by camera-trapping in 11 areas. In 2015, dholes and tigers were recorded by camera-traps for the first time in the hill forests of Karen State.\nThere are few large packs of dholes in the Malaysian Peninsula, Sumatra, Java, Vietnam and Thailand. In 2014, camera-trap videos in the rainforests on mountains in Sumatra showed dholes continue to live there.\nIn the 1990s, two Turkish scientists claimed to have seen dholes in northeastern Turkey. Some scientists believe they were true, but others question this claim. Also, one dhole may have been shot in the Caucasus Mountains in 2013; its remains (including a skull) were studied by a biologist in May 2015, who decided the skull was from a dhole. In August 2015, researchers from from Sofia, Bulgaria tried to find this population of dholes in Turkey. On October 12, 2015, this research team concluded that there is no clear evidence of dholes continuing to live in Turkey or the Caucasus Mountains.\nIn culture and literature.\nDholes were first described in European literature in 1794 by a Russian traveller named Pesterev, who saw dholes during his travels in far eastern Russia. He said that dholes regularly hunt Alpine ibexes in packs, and that it looks like the golden jackal."}

{"id": "126099", "revid": "373511", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=126099", "title": "Opeth", "text": "Opeth is a heavy metal band from Stockholm, Sweden. The band name came from the word \"Opet\", which was the name of a city in the Wilbur Smith novel \"Sunbird\". Opeth play \"progressive death metal\" (which comes from combining \"progressive rock\" and \"death metal\"). Opeth are also influenced by progressive rock, blues rock and jazz, and their songs often have both electric and acoustic parts. Opeth went on their first world tour after the release of their album \"Blackwater Park\". The band's members have changed many times since Opeth started in 1990, but band member Mikael \u00c5kerfeldt has always been present. Although he did not start the band, \u00c5kerfeldt is the only band member to perform in every album. Opeth has released seven studio albums, two live albums, two box-sets, and two DVDs.\nHistory.\nFormation (1990-1993).\nOpeth was formed in 1990 by David Isberg. Isberg asked Mikael \u00c5kerfeldt to play bass guitar for Opeth without telling any of the other Opeth band members. When \u00c5kerfeldt showed up to play with the band the next day, the band members refused to throw out their bass player for \u00c5kerfeldt and all band members but Isberg and \u00c5kerfeldt left to form a new band. Lots of new band members joined and left the band. Anders Nordin joined Opeth to play drums, Nick D\u00f6ring to play bass guitar and Andreas Dimeo to play electric guitar. D\u00f6ring and Dimeo left the band after one show and were replaced by Kim Pettersson on electric guitar and Johan DeFarfalla on bass guitar. DeFarfalla and Pettersson left Opeth after their next two shows and Peter Lindgren joined to play electric guitar.\nIsberg quit in 1992 and joined the band Liars in Wait. Now, Opeth only had \u00c5kerfeldt singing, Nordin on bass guitar and Lindgren on electric guitar. These three members began writing new songs sounding less like typical death metal, and started using acoustic guitars and guitar harmonies, making Opeth a more progressive death metal band. Johan DeFarfalla began playing bass guitar again for Opeth and these four members recorded their first album, \"Orchid\".\n\"Orchid\", \"Morningrise\", and \"My Arms, Your Hearse\" (1994\u20131998).\nAfter touring the United Kingdom Opeth began to record their second album, \"Morningrise\". The album had only five songs but was 66 minutes long. \"Morningrise\" was a big success, and the band toured the UK and Scandinavia playing songs from both albums. They signed a contract with Century Media, who re-released these two albums again in 1997. After the tour, \u00c5kerfeldt and Lindgren fired DeFarfalla for personal reasons, which made Nordin, who was on a vacation in Brazil, leave the band and stay in Brazil. Martin Lopez, who played for Amon Amarth, joined Opeth in 1997 as well as bassist Martin Mendez just before recording their third album, \"My Arms, Your Hearse\". However, \u00c5kerfeldt had to play bass on some songs from \"My Arms, Your Hearse\". The album was released on August 18, 1998, and was another big success. The album focused less on guitar harmonies and more on progressive metal riffs.\n\"Still Life\" and \"Blackwater Park\" (1999-2001).\nIn 1999, Opeth signed with UK label Peaceville Records in Europe, which was distributed by Music For Nations. Opeth began work on their next album, but because of delays, the band was only able to rehearse twice before recording the album. Eventually, \"Still Life\" was released on October 18, 1999 (not in the United States until February 2001)). \"Still Life\" was the first album recorded with Mendez, and was also the first Opeth album to have the band's logo on the front cover. \"Still Life\" is a concept album, and \u00c5kerfeldt explains that the album is about someone who \"is kind of banished from his hometown because he hasn't got the same faith as the rest of the inhabitants there. The album pretty much starts off when he is returning after several years to hook up with his old 'babe'. The big bosses of the town know that he's back... A lot of bad things start happening.\"\nAfter a few live shows in Europe, Opeth returned to work on their next album, with Porcupine Tree's Steven Wilson producing. \"This time it was tough\", \u00c5kerfeldt said, \"I feel pleasantly blown away by the immense result, though. It was indeed worth the effort.\" Wilson also pushed the band to use new sounds and production techniques. \"Steve guided us into the realms of 'strange' noises for guitars and voice\", \u00c5kerfeldt said. Opeth released its fifth studio album, \"Blackwater Park\", on February 21, 2001. This release encouraged Opeth to go on their first world tour, headlined Europe and playing to a crowd of 60,000 at the 2001 Wacken Open Air festival in Germany.\n\"Deliverance\" and \"Damnation\" (2002-2004).\nAfter touring in support of \"Blackwater Park\", Opeth returned home and began writing for the next album, but \u00c5kerfeldt had trouble coming up with new material: \"I wanted to write something heavier than we'd ever done, still I had all these great mellow parts and arrangements which I didn't want to go to waste.\" Jonas Renkse of Katatonia, a long-time friend of \u00c5kerfeldt, suggested writing music for two separate albums\u2014one heavy and one soft. Excited about the idea, \u00c5kerfeldt agreed without asking his bandmates or record label. While his bandmates liked the idea of recording two separate albums, \u00c5kerfeldt had to convince the label: \"I had to lie somewhat... saying that we could do this recording very soon, it won't cost more than a regular single album\". With most of the material written, the band rehearsed just once before entering the studio, again with producer Steven Wilson in Studio Fredman. Under pressure to complete both albums at the same time, \u00c5kerfeldt said the recording process was \"the toughest test of our history.\" After recording basic tracks, the band moved production to England to mix the heavy album, \"Deliverance\", with Andy Sneap at Backstage Studios. \"\"Deliverance\" was so badly recorded, without any organisation whatsoever,\" \u00c5kerfeldt claimed, that Sneap \"is credited as a 'saviour' in the sleeve, as he surely saved much of the recording.\"\n\"Deliverance\" was released on November 4, 2002, and debuted at number 19 on the US Top Independent Albums chart, marking the band's first US chart appearance. Allmusic stated, \"\"Deliverance\" is altogether more subtle than any of its predecessors, approaching listeners with haunting nuances and masterful dynamics rather than overwhelming them with sheer mass and complexity.\" Opeth played a single concert in Stockholm, then returned to the UK to finish recording vocals for the second of the two albums, \"Damnation\", at Steve Wilson's No Man's Land Studios. Although \u00c5kerfeldt first believed the band could not finish both albums, Opeth completed \"Deliverance\" and \"Damnation\" in just seven weeks of studio time, which was the same amount spent on \"Blackwater Park\" alone. \"Damnation\" was released on April 14, 2003, and gained the band its first appearance on the US \"Billboard\" 200 at number 192. The album also won the band a 2003 Swedish Grammy Award for \"Best Hard Rock Performance\". The band launched its biggest tour yet, playing nearly 200 shows in 2003 and 2004. Opeth performed three special shows in Europe with two song lists each\u2014one acoustic set and one heavy set. The band recorded its first DVD, \"Lamentations: Live at Shepherd's Bush Empire 2003\", at Shepherd's Bush Empire in London. The DVD featured a two-hour performance, including the entire \"Damnation\" album, as well as several songs from \"Deliverance\" and \"Blackwater Park\", and a one-hour documentary about the recording of \"Deliverance\" and \"Damnation\". The DVD was certified Gold in Canada.\nOpeth was scheduled to perform in Jordan in late 2003 without a crew due to the fear of terrorist attacks in the Middle East. Opeth's tour manager distributed 6,000 tickets for the concert, but before the band left for Jordan, Lopez called \u00c5kerfeldt saying he was having an anxiety attack and could not perform, forcing the band to cancel the show. In early 2004, Lopez was sent home from Canada after more anxiety attacks on tour. Opeth decided not to cancel the rest of the tour, and Lopez's drum tech filled in for two concerts. Opeth asked drummer Gene Hoglan of Strapping Young Lad to fill in. Lopez eventually returned to Opeth for the Seattle show on the final leg of the \"Deliverance\" and \"Damnation\" tour. Per Wiberg also joined the band on keyboards, and after more than a year on tour, Opeth went back home to start writing more new songs in 2004.\n\"Ghost Reveries\" (2005-2007).\nOpeth's European label, Music for Nations, closed its doors in 2005 and the band signed with Roadrunner Records. After writing material for their eighth album in late 2004, the band rehearsed for three weeks before entering the studio, the first time they rehearsed since the 1998 album, \"My Arms, Your Hearse\". Opeth recorded at Fascination Street Studios in \u00d6rebro, Sweden, from March 18 to June 1, 2005, and released the album \"Ghost Reveries\" on August 30, 2005, again to critical and commercial success. The album debuted at number 64 in the US, and number nine in Sweden, higher than any other Opeth release. Keith Bergman of Blabbermouth.net gave the album 10 out of 10, one of only 17 albums to achieve a perfect rating from the site.\nOn May 12, 2006, Martin Lopez announced that he had officially parted ways with Opeth due to health problems, and he was replaced by Martin Axenrot. Opeth toured on the main stage of Gigantour in 2006, alongside Megadeth. \"Ghost Reveries\" was re-released on October 31, 2006, with a bonus cover version of Deep Purple's \"Soldier of Fortune\" and a DVD of the making of the album. A recording of Opeth's live performance at the Camden Roundhouse, in London, on November 9, 2006, was later released as the double live album \"The Roundhouse Tapes\". On May 17, 2007, Peter Lindgren stated he was leaving Opeth after 16 years. \"The decision has been the toughest I've ever made but it is the right one to make at this point in my life,\" Lindgren said. \"I feel that I simply have lost some of the enthusiasm and inspiration needed to participate in a band that has grown from a few guys playing the music we love to a worldwide industry.\" Ex-Arch Enemy guitarist Fredrik \u00c5kesson replaced Lindgren, as \u00c5kerfeldt explained, \"Fredrik was the only name that popped up thinking about a replacement for Peter. In my opinion he's one of the top three guitar players out of Sweden. We all get along great as we've known each other for maybe four years and he already has the experience to take on the circus-like lifestyle we lead as members of Opeth.\"\n\"Watershed\" (2008-Present).\nIn November 2007, after nearly 200 performances in support of \"Ghost Reveries\", Opeth entered Fascination Street Studios with \u00c5kerfeldt producing. By January 2008, Opeth had recorded 13 songs, including three cover songs. The finished album, \"Watershed\", was released on June 3, 2008, and has seven tracks with cover songs included as bonus tracks on some versions. The album has since debuted at number 23 on the US \"Billboard\" 200, making it their highest-charting album yet. It enjoyed success in many other countries as well, entering the Australian ARIA album charts at number seven, while debuting at number one on Finland's official album chart. Opeth planned extensive touring in support of \"Watershed\", but some shows in Europe had to be cancelled because of some music festival cancellations and \u00c5kerfeldt coming down with chicken pox. On January 25, 2009, Opeth played their first show in India at IIT Madras's cultural festival Saarang. On March 06, 2009 the band played in the Middle East at the annual Dubai Desert Rock Festival in Dubai. On March 26, 2009 it was announced that Opeth would take part in the first European Progressive Nation tour with bands Dream Theater, Bigelf and Unexpect. On April 24, 2009, Opeth headlined the first day of Metal Hammer Magazine's first UK metal music festival HammerFest.\nHeritage.\nMikael \u00c5kerfeldt began writing for Opeth's tenth studio album sometime of September 2010 along with Fredrik \u00c5kesson (who co-wrote one song). The band recorded the album titled \"Heritage\" between 31 January-21 February 2011 and released on 14 September 2011 in Japan, following other release dates in various parts of the world.\nMusical styles and influences.\nAlthough he was not the founder of the band, Mikael \u00c5kerfeldt is the only member to appear on every release. He is Opeth's main songwriter and lyricist and has defined much of the band's sound. \u00c5kerfeldt was influenced at a young age by heavy metal bands such as Slayer, Death, Black Sabbath, Celtic Frost, King Diamond and Morbid Angel. \u00c5kerfeldt was later influenced by progressive rock and folk music, both of which had a strong impact on the sound of the band. Opeth's distinct sound combines elements of heavy metal with acoustic passages and elements of progressive metal and progressive rock. \u00c5kerfeldt commented on the diversity of Opeth's music:\nI don't see the point of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be impossible for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music. We're not afraid to experiment, or to be caught with our pants down, so to speak. That's what keeps us going.\nOpeth's earlier works often made use of twin-guitar harmonies, but they were abandoned in the band's later work. \"I got tired of it, the whole harmony guitar thing\", \u00c5kerfeldt said. \"It got out of hand in the mid-90s. Every band was doing that thing.\" Most of the band's songs exceed 10 minutes in length, which Aaron Burgess of \"Alternative Press\" magazine criticized, stating, \"you can't really be a casual Opeth fan. It takes enough as a listener just to get past the band's epic song lengths.\" Vocally, \u00c5kerfeldt shifts between growling death metal vocals for heavy sections, and clean, sometimes whispered vocals over acoustic passages. While death growls were dominant on the early albums, later releases used more clean vocals, such the 2003 release \"Damnation\" which had only clean singing. The band's lyrics often reflect a bleak outlook on life, with subjects such as failed relationships, nature, death, and depression. Some of the band's albums also have a consistent theme or concept throughout, such as \"Still Life\" and \"My Arms, Your Hearse\". The songs were put together as one continual piece, with the last word or phrase of each song becoming the title of the next."}

{"id": "126107", "revid": "1141202", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=126107", "title": "Menstrual cycle", "text": "The menstrual cycle is a process that adult women can go through. The menstrual cycle for a woman will repeat every 28 days while they are not pregnant. During this time, the women's ovaries create a mature ovum (egg). Then the woman's body prepares for pregnancy by thickening the walls of the uterus. If the woman does not become pregnant during this time, the egg and the lining of the uterus come out of the woman's body during menstruation.\nThe menstrual cycle process is controlled by four major hormones: FSH (follicle stimulating hormone); LH (luteinising hormone); estrogen; and progesterone. These hormones prepare the uterus to receive a fertilized egg and control its development.\nThe menstrual cycle has three stages: the Follicular stage, Ovulation, and the Luteal (or premenstrual) stage. The cycle will stop if the woman gets pregnant (if a fertilized egg implants itself into the lining of the uterus).\nFollicular Stage.\nThis stage is the start of the menstrual cycle, and is counted as day one of the cycle. This stage starts when the amount of progesterone and estrogen in a woman's blood drop. This causes the endometrium - the thick lining of the uterus - to leave the woman's body through menstruation. It will appear as bleeding from the vagina. This stage lasts from 4\u20136 days.\nAt the start of this stage, the pituitary gland will begin to release more FSH. This will continue for 3-4 days. The FSH makes several follicles grow in one of the ovaries. Each follicle contains an immature ova (egg). These follicles create estrogen.\nUsually, the amount of FSH in the body peaks during the third or fourth day of menstruation. All but one of the follicles dies off. The one that is left releases even more estrogen. Once again, the lining of the uterus thickens. Near the end of the stage, a woman's estrogen levels peak. This causes the pituitary gland to release LH, which also peaks at this time.\nOvulation.\nOvulation happens roughly every 14 days. This is when the mature egg is released into the oviduct (or fallopian tube) ready for fertilisation.\nOvulation happens if there is both a rise in estrogen and a peak in LH at the end of the follicular stage. The rising levels of LH make the ovum mature. The follicle that contains the ovum swells and breaks open. (In the next stage, the leftover cells of the follicle turn into an important structure called the corpus luteum.) The ovum is released into the Fallopian tube. \nDuring ovulation, a woman's body temperature is usually about 0.5 degrees Celsius over normal.\nLuteal Stage.\nThe follicle cells that used to hold the ovum now release progesterone into the body. This causes the endometrium to get even thicker.\nIf an ovum is going to be fertilized, it happens during this step. A woman becomes pregnant when a man's sperm fertilizes one of her ova, which then plants itself into the lining of the uterus.\nIf fertilized.\nIf the ovum is fertilized during Ovulation, it will become a zygote. It will start to copy itself over and over again through mitosis. It will also move from the ovarian duct into the uterus. The levels of estrogen and progesterone in the body remain high. The zygote grows into an embryo and implants itself into the endometrium tissue of the uterus. This forms a placenta, which starts to mature.\nAfter fertilization, the menstrual cycle stops so the embryo can continue to mature for the next 9 months. Progesterone and estrogen levels will stay high until the fetus is ready to be birthed.\nEventually, after giving birth, a woman's menstrual cycle will return to the way it was before she got pregnant.\nIf not fertilized.\nUntil around day 22, estrogen levels increase a little.

The main advantage of using market share is that it removes the effects of industry-wide macroenvironmental variables such as the state of the economy, or changes in tax policy. For example, if you were one of only two psychiatrists in Chicago, then it would not matter how bad the economy was because you would always have a huge slice of the consumer-base \"pie\" for your service. If your service was less needed, then advertising more would help increase your market share. \nThe market shares for different companies tends to change over time, causing change in the market share values; the reason can be political ups and downs, a disaster, etc.\nIn finance a share is a unit of account for various financial instruments including stocks, mutual funds, limited partnerships, and REIT's. In British English, the usage of the word share alone to refer solely to stocks is so common that it almost replaces the word stock itself.\nIn simple words, a share or stock is a document issued by a company, which entitles its holder to be one of the owners of the company. A share is issued by a company or can be purchased from the stock market.\nBy owning a share you can earn a portion and selling shares you get capital gain. So, your return is the dividend plus the capital gain. However, you also run a risk of making a capital loss if you have sold the share at a price below your buying price.\nA company's stock price reflects what investors think about the stock, not necessarily what the company is \"worth.\" For example, companies that are growing quickly often trade at a higher price than the company might currently be \"worth.\" Stock prices are also affected by all forms of company and market news. Publicly traded companies are required to report quarterly on their financial status and earnings. Market forces and general investor opinions can also affect share price."}

{"id": "126152", "revid": "373511", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=126152", "title": "Church of Satan", "text": "The Church of Satan is a religious group that encourages people to accept their human nature and build their ego, as it is told in \"The Satanic Bible\", written in 1969 by Anton LaVey. They do not worship or believe in Satan and they do not believe in God. \"Satan\" is just a symbol of freedom and the ego.\nHistory.\nThe Church of Satan started in San Francisco, California, on Walpurgis night April 30, 1966, by Anton Szandor LaVey, who was the Church's High Priest until he died in 1997.\nIn the 1950s Anton LaVey made a group called the Order of the Trapezoid, some of whose members later became the leaders of the Church of Satan. Some of the people at the events were: \u201cThe Baroness\u201d Carin de Plessen (who grew up in a Royal Palace in Denmark), Dr. Cecil Nixon (magician, Odd person, and maker of robot), underground filmmaker Kenneth Anger, City Assessor(someone who figures out values of city property) Russell Wolden, anthropologist(a person who studies culture and human development) Michael Harner, and writer Shana Alexander. Other friends of LaVey at this point were famous Science Fiction and Horror writers Anthony Boucher, August Derleth, Robert Barbour Johnson, Reginald Bretnor, Emil Petaja, Stuart Palmer, Clark Ashton Smith, Forrest J. Ackerman, and Fritz Leiber Jr.\nIn its first year, the Church of Satan was in the news a lot because they performed a Satanic marriage of Judith Case and journalist John Raymond. The ceremony was photographed by Joe Rosenthal, who took the famous photograph \"Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima\" during World War II. Another event was the public funeral of Church of Satan member and Naval Officer Edward Olson, as his wife had asked.\nThe Church of Satan was in many books, magazine and newspaper articles in the 1960s and 1970s. A whole documentary, \"Satanis\" was also made about it in 1970. LaVey was also in Kenneth Anger\u2019s film \"Invocation of my Demon Brother\", and helped as a technical adviser in \"The Devil's Rain\", which starred Ernest Borgnine, William Shatner, and first showed John Travolta. The Church of Satan was also shown in Luigi Scattini\u2019s film \"Angeli Bianchi, Angeli Neri\", which in the United States was known as \"Witchcraft \u201870\".\nIn 1975 LaVey argued within the Church of Satan by stopping the Church's \u201cGrotto\u201d system(having Satanic rituals in caves) and removing people he thought were using the Church instead of doing things in the outside world. After that, LaVey hoped success in society would decide who did well in the Church of Satan. LaVey chose to do less interviews. People thought the Church might have ended, or even that LaVey might have died.\nIn the 1980s some Christians, therapists who believed in recovered memories, and the news were saying Satanists were a criminal group. Members of the Church of Satan, such as Peter H. Gilmore, Peggy Nadramia, Boyd Rice, Adam Parfrey, Diabolos Rex, and musician King Diamond, were active in the news to deny the Church of Satan were criminals. These stories became known as the Satanic panic. The FBI later made a report saying these conspiracy theories were untrue.\nIn the 1980s and 1990s the Church of Satan made many movies, music, films, and magazines about Satanism. Adam Parfrey\u2019s Feral House publishing, the music of Boyd Rice, and the films of Nick Bougas, including his documentary \"Speak of the Devil: The Canon of Anton LaVey\". They were also frequently in the newspapers.\nAfter Anton Szandor LaVey's death, his partner Blanche Barton became head of the Church of Satan. Barton is still in the Church; however, in 2001 she gave her position to long-time members Peter H. Gilmore and Peggy Nadramia, the current High Priest and High Priestess and publishers of \"The Black Flame\", the magazine of The Church of Satan. The Central Office of the Church of Satan has also moved from San Francisco to New York City's Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, where the couple live. The Church of Satan does not recognize any other organizations as being Satanist though it does recognize that one does not need to be a member of the Church of Satan to be a Satanist.\nSome public figures have been involved with the Church of Satan, including Kenneth Anger, King Diamond, Teresa Hidy, David Vincent, Marilyn Manson, Aaron Joehlin, Boyd Rice, Marc Almond, Alkaline Trio guitarist and singer Matt Skiba and drummer Derek Grant, professional wrestler Balls Mahoney, professional wrestler Sterling James Keenan, journalist Michael Moynihan, death metal guitarist Matthew McRaith, Sammy Davis Jr. and the artist Coop. As the Church of Satan does not let people see the membership records, it is not known how many members they have.\nIn October 2004 the Royal Navy officially recognised its first registered Satanist, twenty-four year old Chris Cranmer, as a technician on the HMS Cumberland.\nOn June 6, 2006 The Church of Satan held the first public ritual Satanic Mass in 40 years at the Steve Allen Theater in the Center for Inquiry in Los Angeles. The ritual, based on The Satanic Bible and The Satanic Rituals, was led by Reverend Bryan Moore and Priestess Heather Saenz.\nIn December 2007 the Associated Press reported that a teenager had sent an e-mail to the Church of Satan administration saying he wanted to \"kill in the name of our unholy lord Satan.\" The Church told the Federal Bureau of Investigation about the message, which then told local police who arrested the teenager. \nMembership.\nThe Church of Satan has two types of members: Registered Members and Active Members. Registered Members just have to pay $200 to the Church, and are given a red card to show they are a member. An Active Member has to be involved with the Church and local members. Active Membership is divided into five Degrees:\nActive Members begin at the First Degree. They must be approved for an Active Membership, and this is based on their answers to a long list of questions. Members cannot apply for higher Degrees, and the requirements for each degree are not open to the public. Promotion to a higher degree is only by being invited. Members of the Third through Fifth degrees are the Priesthood and may be called \"Reverend.\" Members of the Fifth degree are sometimes called \"Doctor,\" although \"\"The\" Doctor\" usually means Lavey. Some Active Members are called Agents, qualified to explain the Church of Satan and the philosophy of Satanism to the media and others who are interested.\nPeople seeking membership must be old enough to be seen as adults in the country where they live. The only exception made is for children of members who show they understand the Church philosophy and practices who wish to join. What they can do is limited until they reach adulthood.\nMemberships may be ended through a decision of the ruling body of the Church of Satan consisting of the High Priest, the High Priestess and the Council of Nine.\nGrottoes.\nOver the years, the Church of Satan has stopped then restarted the use of Grottoes -small groups for people who live near each other to work on projects or do ritual together, or be friends. Now that most people have the internet, the Church of Satan has decided people do not need to join Grottoes to meet other Satanists. If a group of Church of Satan members now wish to form a \u201cmagic circle\u201d for something more than simple friendship and ritual, and can keep it active for a year and a day, the leader of the group can apply to have it called a Grotto and the leader called a Grotto Master. A grotto is expected to be secret, and only those they think are worthy are supposed to know about it. If a Grotto stops being useful it will be closed, as the Church of Satan has always done. Grotto Masters and Grottos do not represent the Church of Satan unless they have other authority to do so.\nPriesthood.\nMembers of the Priesthood have the titles \u201cPriest\u201d/\u201cPriestess,\u201d \u201cMagister\u201d/\u201cMagistra,\u201d or \u201cMagus\u201d/\u201cMaga.\u201d The Council of Nine, which is the ruling body of the Church of Satan, and the Order of the Trapezoid who help in the administration of the Church of Satan are part of the priesthood. The High Priest and Priestess act as administrative chiefs and the two main public representatives. The current High Priest is Peter H. Gilmore, the current High Priestess Peggy Nadramia.\nThe Church of Satan say they judge whether Active Members can join the Priesthood by their accomplishment in society and recognition within a profession rather than knowledge of the occult. They are expected to be able to speak about the Satanic philosophy, but do not have to represent the Church of Satan publicly, and might choose to keep their membership secret so they can do what they want in the world, meet their own goals and those of the Church. Membership in the Priesthood is by invitation only.\nPast &amp; present Church of Satan High Priesthood.\nZeena Lavey, Anton LaVey's daughter, was not a High Priestess of the Church and has left it.\nThe main texts of LaVeyan Satanism.\nSatanists within the Church of Satan follow these rules on how to live. But Satanists do not view the Satanic sins, statements, and rules of the earth as things that someone has to \"try\" to do. They think it's human nature, rather than a Jew or Christian who the Church of Satan think have to try hard to fit in with the rules of their religion.\nThe Nine Satanic Statements.\nThe Nine Satanic Statements outline what \"Satan\" represents in the Church of Satan.\nPentagonal Revisionism (Five-sided change).\nPentagonal Revisionism is a plan consisting of five major goals written in 1988 by founder Anton Szandor LaVey:\nThese goals have another purpose, as said by the author, to let non-Satanists see how much they agree with Satanic views. Pentagonal Revisionism is the application of Satanist beliefs to society and economics with five goals to encourage members. Other books, such as \"The Satanic Bible\",say more about Satanic dogma."}

The appendix is a pouch at the start of the large intestine. Symptoms usually include a sharp pain in the lower right abdomen. Also, nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite are common. However, about 40% of people do not have these typical symptoms. If the appendix ruptures (splits) the result is painful peritonitis, and sepsis. Therefore immediate treatment in hospital is needed for appendicitis. Usually the infected appendix is taken out.\nThe function of the appendix in apes is the digestion of vegetable matter such as leaves. Humans do not digest leaves, but we inherited some of the apes' vegetarian apparatus. Our appendix is much smaller than that of present-day apes, and for some reason our immune system does not serve it well. An infection there is not eliminated as it might be elsewhere in the body.\nThe causes of appendicitis include blocking in the appendix, or bacterial infections. If it is not treated, it may lead to peritonitis and shock. Most serious appendicitis happens to younger children and elder adults. Appendicitis is common between the ages of ten and fourteen for males, and fifteen and nineteen for females. The most usual treatment is an appendectomy which means removing the appendix. Sometimes, it gets better without surgery. Some people think that eating vegetables will help, but no chances should be taken. \"Seek medical advice\" if in doubt.\nReginald Fitz first described acute appendicitis in 1886. It is one of the leading causes worldwide of \"pain in the abdomen\", a term used in medicine and surgery to cover a wide range of causes."}

They are doctors for animals. There are many different types of veterinarians; some work with small animals, large farm animals, or wild animals. Veterinarians learn to treat all animals, but sometimes work with a specific type. Other veterinarians specialise in a particular type of medicine - for example, veterinary dermatologists work with animals with skin problems. Finally, some veterinarians do research on animal or human diseases.\nTo become a vet in North America, you must go to college for at least 2 or 3 years, and take several required classes, including many science classes. You then apply to veterinary school. If you are accepted, you are in veterinary school for 4 years, and then graduate with the degree Doctor of Veterinary Medicine. In the United States and Canada, you have to pass a test (called the NAVLE or North American Veterinary Licensing Exam) before you can practice as a veterinarian. In other countries such as Australia, veterinary schools are 5 years long and take students that have finished high school. In iraq, veterinary schools are 5 years long and take students that have finished high schools."}

{"id": "126227", "revid": "1060941", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=126227", "title": "Flat Earth", "text": "The idea of a flat Earth is that the surface of the Earth is flat (a plane). Belief in a flat Earth is found in the oldest writings. Early Mesopotamian maps showed the world as a flat disk floating in the ocean.\nThis was a common belief until the Classical Greeks began to discuss the Earth's shape about the 4th century BC. Eratosthenes (276 \u2013194 ) calculated the circumference of the Earth quite well. From then on, few educated people ever believed in its being flat. People first started having the thought that the Earth is round in around 6th century BC. Then, Aristotle proved the Earth was round in around 330 BC.\nThe large-scale shape of the Earth only matters when considering large distances. Therefore in the Ancient world only sailors, astronomers, philosophers, and theologians would have cared about the Earth's large-scale shape.\nThe following authors argued for a spherical or ball shaped earth: King Alfred of the Anglo-Saxons, Hildegard von Bingen, Thomas Aquinas, Snorri Sturluson, Marco Polo, Dante Alighieri, Christopher Columbus\nPortuguese people explored Africa and Asia, Columbus sailed to the Americas (1492) and Ferdinand Magellan's circumnavigated (sailed all round) the earth (1519-21). This proved finally, in a practical way that the Earth is a globe.\nDuring the 19th century, the Romantic ideas about a European \"Dark Age\" made the Flat Earth model look much more important than it ever had been in history.\nThe widely circulated woodcut is of a man poking his head through the firmament of a flat Earth to see the machines working the spheres. It was made in 16th century style but cannot be traced to an earlier time than Camille Flammarion's \"L'Atmosph\u00e8re: M\u00e9t\u00e9orologie Populaire\" (Paris, 1888, p.\u00a0163). The woodcut illustrates the statement in the text that a missionary in the middle Ages claimed that \"he reached the horizon where the Earth and the heavens met\". That story may be traced back to Voltaire, but not to any known source in the Middle ages. The original woodcut had a decorative border that places it in the 19th century; in later publications, some claimed that the woodcut dated from the 16th century and the border was removed. According to an unproved story Flammarion ordered the woodcut himself; certainly no source of the image earlier than Flammarion's book is known.\nAn early mention in literature was Ludvig Holberg's comedy \"Erasmus Montanus\" (1723). A great many people disagree with Erasmus Montanus when he claims the Earth is round, since all the peasants believe it is flat. He is not allowed to marry his fianc\u00e9e until he cries \"The earth is flat as a pancake\". In Rudyard Kipling's \"The Village that Voted the Earth was Flat\", the main characters spread the rumor that a Parish Council meeting had voted in favor of a flat Earth.\nFantasy fiction often imagines a flat Earth. In C. S. Lewis' \"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\" the fictional world of Narnia is \"round like a table\" (i.e., flat), not \"round like a ball\", and the characters sail toward the edge of this world. Terry Pratchett's Strata and Discworld novels (1983 onwards) are set on a flat, disc-shaped world resting on the backs of four huge elephants which are in turn standing on the back of an enormous turtle."}

He came to Australia in 1852 when he was 10 years old. His family came to dig gold in Victoria, Australia. When he was 12 years old he got a job working with horses\nWhen he was about 20 years old, Gilbert was living in New South Wales near Forbes. He became a member of a gang which was led by Frank Gardiner. Another member of the gang was Ben Hall. With Gardiner and Hall, Gilbert was involved with the biggest gold robbery in Australia's history: in 1862 the gang robbed a coach carrying gold at Eugowra. After the robbery, Gardiner went to Queensland to hide from the police. John Gilbert went to New Zealand. When he came back in May 1863, he started a new gang with Ben Hall.\nWith Ben Hall.\nThe Ben Hall gang robbed travelers on the roads, the mail coaches, the gold escorts, hotels, farm houses and even held up whole towns. The police seemed to be unable to stop the gang. At first people thought this was fun, the police being made to look like fools. Gilbert and John O'Meally did the first daylight bank robbery in Australia in July 1863. They rode into the town of Carcoar and tried to take money from the bank. The man working at the bank grabbed his gun and fired it twice. Gilbert and O'Meally ran out of the bank, quickly got on to their horses and rode away.\nBut as the number of robberies continued, people became scared and wanted the government to do something. In 1864, Gilbert killed a policeman, Sergeant Edmund Parry, during a robbery near Jugiong. The police search for Gilbert became urgent.\nAt Springfield, near Goulburn, Gilbert tried to rob four young brothers. The boys fired their guns and kept the bushrangers back. Gilbert tried to shoot one of the boys, but his stolen race horse (called \"Young Waverly\") got in the way. The horse died immediately and Gilbert was trapped under the dead horse. People thought that this was very funny; a dangerous bushranger being made to look like a fool by a group of boys.\nIn 1865 another another policeman was killed by another member of the gang, John Dunn. Members of the gang were declared outlaws. This meant they could be killed by anyone at anytime. The police shot Ben Hall dead near Forbes on May 5, 1865. On May 13, 1865 Gilbert and Dunn went to hide at John Kelly's (Dunn's grandfather) house. Kelly told the police at Binalong where the two bushrangers were hiding so he could get the reward money. The police went to the house, but Gilbert and Dunn climbed out a window and ran down to Billabong Creek to escape into the bush. Constable King was shot in the foot, and Dunn was shot in the arm. Gilbert was shot dead when he stopped to shoot back at Constable John Bright. After an inquest to record how he died, he was buried at Binalong, in the field where the police kept their horses. Gilbert was a bad criminal. He had been in 630 robberies. Dunn escaped but was captured six months later. He was hanged in Sydney in March 1866.\nGilbert in poetry and song.\nThe story of John Gilbert was told in a poem, \"How Gilbert Died\" , by Australian poet, Banjo Paterson. Paterson had lived in Binalong when he was a young boy."}

It affects how people think and act. \nPeople with ADHD may be too active; they may have trouble sitting still or being quiet. They may be rather impulsive. \nThey usually have problems focusing and remembering what is said or done around them. ADHD is called a \"neurological developmental disorder\" because it affects how people's nervous systems develop.\nExperts think that, throughout the world, about one in twenty children (5%) have ADHD. Some countries have more people with ADHD than others, and not everyone uses the same tests. Psychologists have found more people with ADHD in North America than in Africa and the Middle East. In the United States, about one in every fourteen children has ADHD (7%), including one in every ten boys (10%) and one in every twenty-five girls (4%). This could be because more boys get ADHD, or because fewer girls take ADHD tests.\nADHD is most common in children: fewer adults have ADHD. \nSome (less than half) people with ADHD in childhood find things get better when they are adults. Their symptoms are less noticeable. In some cases the symptoms go away entirely when they reach adulthood.\nSigns and symptoms.\nPeople with ADHD can have trouble paying attention, be overly active, or be impulsive. There are three types of ADHD, based on which of the three symptoms is most common. Someone who usually has trouble paying attention may have some or all of these symptoms:\nSomeone who usually is overly active may have some or all of these symptoms:\nPeople who are overly active usually lose these symptoms as they get older.\nSomeone who usually is impulsive may have some or all of these symptoms:\nPeople with ADHD may have trouble making and keeping friends. They may also have trouble controlling their anger. While children with ADHD may have trouble doing some things, many children with ADHD will not have trouble paying attention to something they enjoy or think are interesting.\nMost people who have ADHD also have other mental disorders, most often oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, dyslexia, Tourette syndrome, anxiety disorders (especially obsessive-compulsive disorder), mood disorders, substance use disorders, eating disorders and personality disorders (especially antisocial, borderline, histrionic, passive-aggressive and avoidant).\nCause.\nIt is believed that the main difference between neurotypical brains and the ones with the ADHD is the deficit in amount of dopamine receptors release within the synapses in the brain. This deficit is said to be the main factor in regulating motivation and sustaining attention. \nResearch of twins has shown that about three in four cases of ADHD are caused by one or both parents having ADHD. Siblings of children with ADHD are three to four times more likely to develop the disorder than siblings of children without the disorder. Genetic factors are also believed to be involved in determining whether ADHD lasts into adulthood. Some scientists think that ADHD is common because when humans were first developing, it was good to be overly active. Others think that, because ADHD is more common in children when the mother is anxious, ADHD developed to help children in dangerous places.\nThere are other possible causes for ADHD. If a pregnant person drinks alcohol, it can cause fetal alcohol syndrome, which can include ADHD. ADHD can also happen if a mother smokes tobacco while she is pregnant. Lead, low birth weight, premature birth, and some infections can increase the risk of a child having ADHD.\nManaging ADHD.\nThere is no cure for ADHD. People with ADHD can be helped with therapy or medication. Therapy is recommended for children who do not have bad symptoms or are very young. Therapy for people with ADHD helps with attention and behavior. There is also education for parents and teachers to help children with ADHD. Some physical exercise has been shown to help people with ADHD.\nThe first line treatment for ADHD includes cognitive behavioral therapy and use of stimulants. Stimulants increase the amount of a chemical called dopamine in the brain, which helps with paying attention, planning, organization, and management of being overly active. These medications should not be given to children below the age of 6. \nSociety and culture.\nPeople do not agree about the diagnosis of ADHD. The number of people with ADHD has increased in the last several years. Some people think this is because doctors are diagnosing too many people. Others think it is because doctors are getting better at finding people with ADHD. Some people think that ADHD is made-up and not a real illness, even though it's the most researched condition in psychiatry. Most studies suggest that ADHD is mostly caused by problems with genes.\nSeveral famous people have spoken about the rise in ADHD diagnoses. Actor Tom Cruise said that the medicines usually given to people with ADHD were like illegal drugs. Others disagreed with him because the amount of medicine given to people with ADHD does not cause addiction. There have been many studies about the effectiveness of the medicines used with ADHD. One certain study found that the medicine did help over a long time, but did not help more than other types of treatment."}

This means one molecule of ozone is made of three oxygen atoms. Ozone is rarely called \"trioxygen\", even though this is its IUPAC systematic name. Ozone is formed from oxygen gas (O2) by the action of ultraviolet light and also atmospheric electrical discharges. It is present in low concentrations throughout the Earth's atmosphere. In total, ozone makes up only 0.6 ppm (parts per million) of the atmosphere by volume.\nOzone is important to life on planet Earth. There is a portion of the stratosphere with a high concentration of ozone, called the ozone layer. The ozone layer filters out damaging ultraviolet radiation from the Sun, like a kind of sun screen. Without this ozone layer things would not have been able to live on the surface of our planet. The ozone layer also absorbs a lot of heat from the sun's rays. \nHowever, ozone is toxic to animals and plants above concentrations of about 0.1 ppm. In humans, it can cause nasal and throat irritation, and nausea. Extended exposure can cause lung oedema. 0.100 ppm is the maximum allowable limit for industrial, public, or occupied spaces in England, Japan, France, the Netherlands and Germany. The Ozone layer is in the 10 to 50 kilometer range of the Earth's atmosphere.\nReferences.\nNotes"}

He was born in 1895 in Jaisalmer (present day India). His ancestral roots linked to Rajput Clans of Rajisthan from where his father immigrated and settled in Karachi after the Sindh was amalgamated in British empire since 1843. He completed his intermediate from Sindh Madressah-tul-Islam, Karachi in 1911. Later, he went to Maharashtar to study engineering in Pune. Later he shifted to Bombay where he joined the project to uplift the lower caste in Bombay but after it was unsuccessful, he resigned along with a number of others from the project.\nPolitical life.\nAfter he retired from the project, he returned to Karachi and worked as an engineer at the then District Local Board, Karachi. However, he later resigned from the job due to differences on policy matter with G. M. Syed, who was then the president of the Board.\nLater, he joined politics and was elected a member of the Bombay Legislative Council from the constituency of Sindh in the 1934 election. Meanwhile he remained active in politics through the platform of the Sindh Ittehad party. He was also elected Mayor of the Municipality of Karachi for the term from May 1941 to May 1942. Afterwards, he joined Jinnah's All India Muslim League; that was launching a movement for establishment of an independent state for Muslim population of India within the sub-continent (which emerged as Pakistan later). Quaid e Azam led this movement and Hashim Gazdar was a friend of Muhammed Ali Jinnah on the platform of All India Muslim League to achieve the goal of a separate Muslim state. During this course, he was again elected a member of Legislative Assembly from Sindh; and remained the Deputy Speaker thereof.\nMuhammed Hashim Gazdar was among the people who represented Sindh in the first session of Pakistan's initiating Constituent Assembly that was convened four days prior to the emergence of Pakistan, i.e. 10 August 1947 at Sindh Assembly Building, Karachi. Other members to represent Sindh were Muhammed Ayub Khoro, J. Ram Das Doulat Ram, and Pirzada Abdul Sattar Abdul Rehman.\nAs a former politician, the role played by Hashim Gazdar during the pre-partition and post partition era is highly acknowledged. Being an honest legislator, a veteran Muslim League politician, his role was significant as an ideological prominent figure on the scenario of Pakistan politics since its genesis. Being a commendable parliamentarian, he is highly appreciable with a view to transiting politics to the new stream in accordance with the changing necessities of times.\nHe died in 1966 and is buried in Muslim Marwari Graveyard Mewashah, Karachi."}

There they meet the Face of Boe again and help defeat some cat-nurses. Over the course of season two, we learn that Rose has a crush on the Doctor, a point that is made strongly in 2.03 (when she competes for the Doctor's affections with former companion, Sarah Jane Smith) and 2.04 (when the Doctor falls for Madame de Pompadour). Toward the end of the season, the Doctor starts to return affection for Rose, ending in the finale where Rose is trapped in a parallel universe (that looks just like ours) with her mother, Jackie, Mickey, and her parallel-universe father, Peter Tyler.\nSeries 4.\nRose makes a number of little, non-speaking appearances throughout series four. \nIn \"Turn Left\", when a Time Beetle causes Donna to change the past and change the universe, Rose continually appears to her and helps her to set things right by sending her back in time. She also gives Donna the message \"Bad Wolf\" to deliver to the Doctor, which tells him that it is the end of the universe. Rose is reunited with the Doctor in \"The Stolen Earth\", but as the two run towards each other, the Doctor is shot down by a Dalek. A sad Rose, reunited with Jack Harkness for the first time since she resurrected him in \"The Parting of the Ways\", is forced to watch the Doctor begin to regenerate again.\nIn \"Journey's End\" the Doctor regenerates just enough to heal himself, moving the rest of his 'Time Lord' regenerative energy into his hand that was cut off in the series two episode \"The Christmas Invasion\". Donna later touches the hand, and the energy that flows into her creates a weird event called a 'biological metacrisis'. This metacrisis causes the hand to develop into a part human, part time lord version of the Doctor, complete with the Doctor's memories, personality and knowledge, but exhibiting traits of Donna's personality. This mixed version of the Doctor also has only one heart, and he can't regenerate. The original Doctor returns Rose to her alternate universe's Bad Wolf Bay. Between themselves, the original Doctor and the half-human Doctor have decided that the half-human Doctor will stay with Rose; this Doctor can give Rose a romantic relationship, as he will age and die as a human rather than greatly outliving her like his Time Lord counterpart would. The Doctor tells Rose that his half-human self needs her as he was \"born of blood and fire and revenge\" much like his previous body was after the Time War. He believes Rose can help turn him into a \"better man\". When the half-human Doctor seemingly completes the sentence the original Doctor started at the end of \"Doomsday\" they kiss each other. And although we do not hear what the half-human Doctor had whispered to Rose, executive producer Julie Gardner confirmed in Doctor Who Confidential that \"even though we don't hear it, of course he's saying 'I love you'.\"\nThe Doctor then leaves Rose and her Doctor in their parallel universe, the walls once again sealed."}

It was ruled by a Hindu Maharaja.\nThe state was created in 1846 after the defeat of the Sikhs. The East India Company annexed the Kashmir valley and wanted to recover some of the cost of the Anglo-Sikh war. The Muslim majority Kashmir was sold to the Dogra ruler of Jammu under the Treaty of Amritsar. The area of the state were set by the Treaty of Amritsar of 1846 \"situated to the eastward of the Indus and westward of the Ravi River it covered an area of 80,900 km2.\nAfter the British left India the princely state was divided between Pakistan and India as war took place between the neighbours.\nCreation.\nBefore the creation of the princely state, Kashmir had been ruled by the Durrani Empire it was then taken over by the Sikhs under Ranjit Singh. During Sikh rule Jammu had been a tributary of the Sikh Empire in the Punjab region, but after the death of its Raja, Kishore Singh, Dogra, in 1822 his son Gulab Singh was recognised by the Sikhs as being his heir. He then began expanding his kingdom.\nAs Ruler Jammu Gulab Singh took over Bhadarwah then Kishtwar. Taking over Kishtwar meant that Singh had now gained control of two of the roads which led into Ladakh which allowed him to take control of that territory. Although there were huge difficulties, due to the mountains and glaciers, the Dogras under Gulab Singh's officer, Zorawar Singh managed to conquered the whole of Ladakh.\nA few years later, in 1840, General Zorawar Singh invaded Baltistan and captured the Raja of Skardu who had sided with the Ladakhis, and took over his country. The following year (1841) Zorawar Singh tried to invade Tibet, however due to the winter weather and by being attacked by the Tibetians. He along with almost all of his army died.\nIn the winter of 1845 war broke out between the British and the Sikhs. Gulab Singh remained neutral until the battle of Sobraon in 1846, when he became a trusted adviser of Sir Henry Lawrence. This allowed him to gain land for himself - all the hilly or mountainous land to the east of the Indus and west of the Ravi River.\nKashmir itself was not easy for the Maharaja to take over. The Maharaja's army had to fight Imam-ud-din - the Sikh governor. Imam-ud-din was aided by the Bambas from the Jhelum valley. They managed to defeat Gulab Singh's troops near to Srinagar, killing Wazir Lakhpat. However Imam-ud-din was later persuaded by Sir Henry Lawrence to stop fighting and Kashmir passed without further fighting to the new ruler.\nExpansion.\nNot long afterwards the Hunza Raja, attacked Gilgit territory. Nathu Shah on behalf of Gulab Singh responded by leading a force to attack the Hunza valley; he and his force were destroyed, and Gilgit fort fell into the hands of the Hunza Raja, along with Punial, Yasin, and Darel. The Maharaja then sent two armies, one from Astor and one from Baltistan, and after some fighting Gilgit fort was taken back. In 1852 the Dogra troops were defeated by Gaur Rahman of Yasin, and for eight years the Indus formed the boundary of the Maharaja's territories.\nGulab Singh died in 1857, his successor, Ranbir Singh, sided with the British during the Indian Rebellion. After the rebellion had been defeated by the British Ranbir decided to take back Gilgit. In 1860 a force under Devi Singh crossed the Indus, and moved towards Gaur Rahman's strong fort at Gilgit. Gaur Rahman had died just before the arrival of the Dogras. The fort was taken and held by the Maharajas until 1947.\nAlthough Ranbir Singh was tolerant of other religions his control over the country was weak, between 1877 and 1879 a dreadful famine took place in Kashmir.\nGeography.\nJammu was the southernmost part of the state and was next to the Punjab districts of Jhelum, Gujrat, Sialkot, and Gurdaspur.\nTransport.\nThere used to be a route from Kohala to Leh, it was possible to travel from Rawalpindi via Kohala and over the Kohala Bridge into Kashmir. The route from Kohala to Srinagar was a cart-road 132 miles in length, from Kohala to Baramulla the road was close to the Jhelum River. At Muzaffarabad the Kishenganga River joins the Jhelum and at this point the road from Abbottabad and Garhi Habibullah meet the Kashmir route. The road carried heavy traffic and had to be repaired main times by the authorities.\nFlooding.\nIn 1893 very serious floods took place in the Jhelum because of rain that fell for 52 hours, and much damage was done to Srinagar. However the floods of 1903 was much more severe.\nEnd of the princely state.\nIn 1947 the Indian Independence Act was passed, this meant that British India would become two independent states - Pakistan and India. Also each of the princely states would be free to join India or Pakistan - or remain independent. All of princely ended up becoming part of Pakistan or India.\nHowever the ruler of Kashmir wanted to remain independent, neither joining Pakistan or India, this led to war between the two neighbouring countries in which Kashmir became divided between them. Each considered that \"all\" of the former princely state belongs to them. This has led to several wars. The Kashmir conflict between the two nuclear neighbours remains one of the hardest and longest running disputes that the United Nations Security Council has been trying to solve."}

It is named after the Jallianwala Bagh (Temple) in the northern Indian city of Amritsar , Punjab. On April 13, 1919, British Indian Army soldiers started shooting at an unarmed crowd of men, women and children. The person in charge was Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer, the military commander of Amritsar.\nThe shooting lasted about ten minutes. According to official British Raj sources, 379 people were killed. According to other sources, there were over 1,000 deaths, with more than 2,000 hurt badly, and Civil Surgeon Dr. Smith said that there were 1500 casualties.\nBackground.\nIndia during World War I.\nWorld War I began with large support and friendliness \"towards the United Kingdom from the leaders of India. This was not expected by the British, who thought there may be a revolt. India helped a lot to the British war effort by providing men and resources. About 1.3 million Indian soldiers and workers served in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, while both the Indian government and the princes sent large supplies of food, money, and ammunition.\"\n\"However, Bengal and Punjab were areas where people still did not like the British. Terrorist-style attacks in Bengal were connected with the unrest in Punjab. Also, from the beginning of the war, the overseas Indian population (mainly from Canada, Germany, and the United States) tried to start a rebellion in India similar to the 1857 uprising. With Irish Republican, German and Turkish help, a large conspiracy was made called the HinduGerman Conspiracy. This conspiracy also tried to make Afghanistan not support British India.\"\nAfter the war.\nAfter World War I, the high number of dead and wounded, inflation, heavy taxation and other problems greatly affected the people of India. Indian soldiers smuggled weapons into India to get rid of British rule. Different groups joined together to demand independence from Britain. In 1916, the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League signed the Lucknow Pact, agreeing to build a border dividing Punjab (India) and Pakistan.\nRowlatt Act.\nThe worsening civil unrest throughout India, especially amongst the Bombay millworkers, led to the Rowlatt committee in 1919. The Rowlatt committee was named after Sydney Rowlatt, an English judge. The job of the committee was to understand German and Bolshevik links to the militant movement in India, especially in Punjab and Bengal.\nThe committee asked for an extension of the Defence of India act of 1915 The act gave the Viceroy's government with great power, that included silencing the press, including detaining the political activists without trial, arrest without warrant of any individual suspected of treason. This act sparked huge anger within India.\nBefore the massacre.\nThe events that followed the Rowlatt Act in 1919 were also influenced by the events linked to the Ghadar conspiracy, At the time, British Indian Army troops were returning from the battlefields of Europe and Mesopotamia to an economic depression in India. There were many attempts to mutiny in 1915 and the Lahore conspiracy trials were still in public attention. News of young Mohajirs who fought on behalf of the Turkish Caliphate and later for the Red Army during the Russian Civil War was also beginning to reach India. The Russian Revolution had also started to influence India. It was at this time that Mahatma Gandhi, until then relatively unknown on the Indian political scene, began emerging as a mass leader.\nGandhi's call for protest against the Rowlatt act got an expected response - of furious unrest and protests. The situation especially in Punjab became bad very quickly. Rail, telegraph and communication systems were all disrupted. A huge crowd of 20,000 marched through Lahore.\nIn Amritsar, over 5,000 people gathered at Jallianwala Bagh. Michael O'Dwyer is said to have believed that this was part of an attempt to rebel against the British. James Houssemayne Du Boulay is said to have ascribed a direct relationship between the fear of a Ghadarite uprising in the midst of an increasingly tensed situation in Punjab, and the British response that ended in the massacre.\nOn April 10, 1919, a protest was held at the residence of the Deputy Commissioner of Amritsar, a city in Punjab, a large province in the northwestern part of what was then undivided India. The demonstration was held to demand the release of two popular leaders of the Indian Independence Movement, Satya Pal and Saifuddin Kitchlew, who had been earlier arrested on account of their protests. The crowd was shot at by British troops, the shooting stated more violence. Later in the day, several banks and other government buildings, including the Town Hall and the railway station were attacked and set on fire. The violence continued to increase, and resulted in the deaths of at least 5 Europeans, including government employees and civilians.\nFor the next two days, the city of Amritsar was quiet, but violence continued in other parts of the Punjab. Railway lines were cut, telegraph posts destroyed, government buildings burnt, and three Europeans were killed. By April 13, the British government had decided to place most of the Punjab under martial law. The legislation placed restrictions on a number of civil liberties, including freedom of assembly, banning gatherings of more than four people.\nThe massacre.\nOn April 13, 1919, thousands of people gathered in the Jallianwala Bagh (garden) near the Golden Temple in Amritsar. The date was for the Baisakhi festival which was also the Sikh new year. For more than two hundred years, this festival had drawn thousands from all over India. People had travelled for days to get to Amritsar.\nThe Jallianwala Bagh was surrounded on all sides by houses and buildings and had few narrow entrances, most of which were kept locked. Unable to escape people tried to climb the walls of the park. Many jumped into a well inside the compound to escape from the bullets. A plaque in the monument says that 120 bodies were plucked out of the well.\nAs a result of the shooting, hundreds of people were killed and thousands were injured. The shooting lasted for ten minutes. In a telegram sent to Dyer, British Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab, Sir Michael O'Dwyer wrote: \"Your action is correct. Lieutenant Governor approves.\"\nO'Dwyer asked for martial law to be imposed upon Amritsar and other areas; this was allowed by the Viceroy, Lord Chelmsford, after the massacre.\nDyer dismissed.\nDyer was initially applauded by some, but in July 1920 he was censured and forced to retire by the House of Commons."}

In 1903 the Indian Army absorbed the three presidency armies (the Bengal Army, the Madras Army and the Bombay Army).\nBetween 1903 and 1947 the Army of India consisted of two separate parts: the Indian Army and the British Army in India.

These troops rebelled against the British in 1857.\nAfter the rebellion, the British started recruiting what the British called the \"martial races,\" particularly Punjabi Muslims, Marathas, Rajputs, Sikhs, Gurkhas, Pashtuns, Garhwalis, Mohyals, and Dogras.\nAfter World War II.\nAfter World War II, the British formations and units that had been part of the British Army of India were divided between India and Pakistan.\nSoon after the Partition of India, both the newly formed armies fought each other in the First Kashmir War from 1947 - '48 which begun the bitter rivalry that has continued into the 21st century."}

It began in the 17th century as trading posts of the British East India Company, but later grew to include much of western and central India, as well as parts of Pakistan and the Arabian Peninsula.\nAt its greatest extent, the Bombay Presidency was made up of the present-day state of Gujarat, the western two-thirds of Maharashtra state, including the regions of Konkan, Desh, and Kandesh, and northwestern Karnataka state of India; It also included Pakistan's Sindh province and the British territory of Aden in Yemen. It consisted partly of districts, which were directly under British rule, and partly of native or princely states, which were ruled by local rulers under the administration of a governor.\nEarly history.\nThe first British settlement in the Bombay Presidency was in 1618, when the East India Company established a factory at Surat. The British were protected by a charter from the Mughal Emperor Jahangir. Bombay at the time was under the control of Portugal. In 1661 Bombay was given to the British government, as part of the dowry of Catherine of Braganza when she married Charles II of England. In 1668 Bombay was given to the East India Company for a yearly payment of \u00a310. In 1687 Bombay became the capital of the Company's territories in India. However, in 1753 Calcutta was in charge of the Government of Bombay.\nExpansion.\nDuring the 18th century, the Maratha Empire grew quickly, conquering Konkan and much of eastern Gujarat from the Mughal Empire. In western Gujarat, including Kathiawar and Kutch, the weakening Mughal control allowed lots of local rulers to become independent. The first battle between the British and the Marathas was the First Anglo-Maratha War which began in 1774 and resulted in the 1782 treaty of Salbai. The treaty meant that the island of Salsette, next to Bombay island, was given to the British. The British took over Surat in 1800. British territory became bigger in the Second Anglo-Maratha War which ended in 1803.\nIn 1803 the Bombay Presidency included only Salsette, the islands of the harbour (since 1774), Surat and Bankot (since 1756); but 1803 and 1827 the presidency grew even more. The Gujarat districts were taken over by the Bombay government in 1805 and made larger in 1818. The small states of Kathiawar and Mahikantha were organised into princely states under British control between 1807 and 1820.\nAfter the Revolt of 1857, the British East India Company rule ceased, and India came under the direct control of the British government. In 1932, Aden was separated from Bombay and made a separate province, and Sind became a separate province on April 1, 1936.\nPeople.\nThe Bombay Presidency had a large and diverse population. The census of 1901 gave a total of 25,468,209 people. By religion the population was 19,916,438 Hindu, 4,567,295 Muslim, 535,950 Jain, 78,552 Zoroastrian, and about 200,000 Christian.\nIn Sindh Islam had been the main religion since the Arab conquest in the 8th century. In Gujarat the main religion is Hinduism, although Muslim kingdoms have left their influence in many parts of the province. The Deccan is the home of the Marathi, who were 30% of the population. The Konkan had various Christian castes, because of the rule of the Portuguese.\nThe main languages of the Presidency were Sindhi in Sindh, Kutchi in Kutch, Gujarati and Hindustani in Gujarat, Marathi in Thana and the central division, Gujarati and Marathi in Khandesh, and Marathi and Kannada in the southern division. There were also Bhil (120,000) and Gipsy (30,000) dialects.\nAfter independence.\nIn 1947 Bombay Province became part of newly-independent India, and Sindh Province became part of Pakistan. In 1950 Bombay Province was reorganised into Bombay State, which included the princely states."}

It is a kind of viola. The name is Italian and means \u201cviola of love\u201d. It can have 6 or 7 strings. It is held under the chin and bowed like a violin. Sometimes it is used today to play music from the 17th and 18th centuries. Occasionally some modern composers have also written music for it.\nStructure and sound.\nThe viola d'amore is about the same size as a modern viola. However, the shape is more like the shape of a viol. Like viols, it has a flat back, a wide rib (the sides), sloping shoulders and a carved head at the top of the peg box. It does not have any frets (markings on the fingerboard) like a viol or a guitar. The sound-holes are often in the shape of a flaming sword.\nThe viola d'amore usually has six or seven playing strings which are played with the bow, just as with a violin. In addition, it has the same number of sympathetic strings. These are strings which vibrate when the other strings are played, making the sound richer and sweeter.\nThe notes it can play.\nThe viola d'amore was often tuned to whatever notes were best for the piece it was to going to play. This is a kind of scordatura (changing the way the strings are tuned). Towards the end of the 18th century the usual tuning became: \"A, d, a, d', f#', a', d\"\" (see music example. Notice the example uses the \"viola clef\")\nUse.\nThe viola d\u2019amore became very popular during the 17th century. However, after a time it became less popular because the instruments of the viol family were not used much while the instruments of the violin family took over. The viola d\u2019amore was too quiet and sweet to play with the modern violin family. However, in the 20th century some composers have written for the instrument again, e.g. Paul Hindemith.\nThe viola d'amore can regularly be heard today in groups who play Baroque music on period instruments. It can be heard, for example in Bach\u2019s St John Passion."}

It was first seen on 4chan and is called a \"bait and switch\". A \"bait and switch\" happens when the prankster gives a website to someone saying that the website address (which is somehow hidden) is about something else. When the victim clicks the link, they see the music video and have been \"rickrolled\" or \"rickroll'd\".\nAs rickrolling has grown in popularity, two of the many videos online have been watched over 13 million times each.\nOn October 27, 2008, at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, Astley himself performed a live rickroll. He came out during the singing of \"Best Friends\" by the cast of \"Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends\" and sang \"Never Gonna Give You Up\". At the end of the song, one of the characters said \"I love rickrolling!\"\nOn February 23, 2010, the most viewed Rickroll video was deleted.\nOn July 29, 2021, the official Rickroll video reached a billion views.\nHistory.\nSong.\nAstley recorded \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" in 1987 on his album \"Whenever You Need Somebody\". This song was his debut single and was a Number One hit for him on many international charts like the Billboard Hot 100, Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks and UK Top 40 charts. It was also Astley's first music video which features him performing the song while dancing.\nOrigin of the term.\nRickrolling is said to have begun as a spin-off of an earlier prank called \"duckrolling\"., which was when a link was supposed to lead to a picture or news story but would really link to an edited picture of a duck on wheels. The victim was then said to have been duckrolled. The first instance of rickrolling happened in May 2007 on the 4chan video game board, where a link to the video was said to be a copy of the first trailer for Grand Theft Auto IV. The joke was confined to 4chan for a short time.\nBy May 2008, Rickrolling had become an internet hit or phenomenon and very soon rickrolling was being covered on mainstream media. A poll in April 2008 by SurveyUSA guessed or estimated that at least 18 million American adults had been rickrolled.\nApril Fools' Day, 2008.\nOn April Fools' Day 2008 and the weeks after, many instances of Rickrolling showed up on the internet, and news media. All of the featured videos on Youtube's main page hyperlinked to the Rickroll. The prank showed up on international YouTube portals before showing up on the main page."}

Colors may be listed as an RGB \"triplet\" (a set of three numbers) in hexadecimal format (a \"hex triplet\"). RGB triplet can make 16,777,216 different colors. Many common colors can also be chosen by their common English names. Often a color tool or other graphics software is used to create color values.\nThe first versions of Mosaic and Netscape Navigator used the X11 color names as the base for their color lists. This was because they both started as X Window System applications.\nEach web color has its own definition, sRGB. This relates to the chromaticities of a single phosphor set, a given transfer curve, adaptive whitepoint, and viewing conditions. These have been chosen to be similar to many real-world monitors and viewing conditions. Even without color management, the colors created are fairly close to the given values. However, user agents can be different in the fidelity with which they show the colors. Better user agents use color management to create better color fidelity. This is important for Web-to-print applications.\nHex triplet.\nA hex triplet is a six-digit, three-byte number used in HTML, CSS, SVG, and other computer programs, to represent colors. The bytes represent the red, green and blue parts of the color. One byte represents a number in the range 00 to FF, or 0 to 255 in decimal notation. This represents the least (0) to the most (255) intensity of each of the color components. The hex triplet is formed by concatenating three bytes in hexadecimal notation, in the following order: \nFor example, consider the color where the red/green/blue values are decimal numbers: red=36, green=104, blue=160 (a greyish-blue color). The decimal numbers 36, 104 and 160 are similar to the numbers 24, 68 and A0 respectively. The hex triplet is obtained by combining the 6 hexadecimal digits together, 2468A0 in this example.\nHTML web colors.\nFormulated in 1997, there were originally 16 colors. Orange was added later to make a total of 17. The original 16 were part of something called the \"Windows VGA template\", meaning that they are the colors that can be used for actions like highlighting.\nList of HTML Color Names.\nThe table below contains all 140 of the HTML colors. All modern browsers support them. \nX11 colors (formulated in 1987).\nThese are called \"X11 web colors\" since the invention of the World Wide Web in 1991.\nChart of selected web colors.\nThis chart shows selected HTML and X11 colors as well as selected unofficial consensus web colors developed by web designers since 2002.

The season started on June 1 and ended on November 30. Tropical Storm Arthur formed two days early on May 30, 2008. During the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season there was a total of sixteen named storms: 16 tropical storms, 8 hurricanes and 5 major hurricanes.\nStorms.\nTropical Storm Arthur.\nTropical Storm Arthur formed near the Belize coast late on May 30, forming out of the interaction between a tropical wave and what was left of Tropical Storm Alma, which was a tropical storm in the East Pacific. Arthur made landfall in Belize on May 31. The system moved over Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula slowly and dissipated on land early on June 2. When Arthur made landfall on Belize, it caused about $78 million USD worth of damage and killed 5 people.\nArthur is the first reported tropical storm to form in May since Tropical Storm Arlene in 1981. Other systems have formed (such as Subtropical Storm Andrea in the previous year), but were subtropical. Some forecasters question whether Arthur's very short lifespan would have been reported and named in the years prior to today's technology. The formation of Arthur also marks the first time that a \"named\" storm formed in May for two consecutive years. It was also the third time in over 150\u00a0years of record.\nHurricane Bertha.\nEarly on July 1, a strong and big tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa. By early the next day, a surface low developed and the wave became more organized. The National Hurricane Center upgraded the system to Tropical Depression Two in the morning hours of July 3 after the system was able to keep convection over its center for at least 12\u00a0hours. The depression organized further and developed two distinct bands of convection. Six hours after becoming a depression, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Bertha, the second named storm of the season. The National Hurricane Center said that this tropical cyclone was predicted by up to a week in advance by many global computer models.\nAfter some strengthening on July 6, Bertha was upgraded to a hurricane early on July 7 as satellite and microwave imagery indicated an eye feature had formed. It continued to strengthen that morning. Fast strengthening continued that afternoon and Bertha strengthened into a major hurricane with 125\u00a0mph (195\u00a0km/h) winds and a well-defined eye. The strengthening trend stopped early on July 8, due to wind shear, and Bertha quickly weakened back to a Category 1 hurricane that afternoon.\nBertha again began to quickly strengthen on July 9 as a new eye had formed and the system became more symmetrical. The NHC upgraded Bertha to a category two hurricane with winds of 105\u00a0mph (170\u00a0km/h) and stated that Bertha could strengthen further to a major hurricane again, but instead weakened into an 85\u00a0mph (135\u00a0km/h) category 1 hurricane. Bertha has become the longest-lived pre-August Atlantic tropical cyclone on record. On July 12, Bertha slowed in movement, and was close to becoming still and by July 13 this slow movement weakened the storm to tropical storm strength. On July 18, Bertha strengthened back to a hurricane as its forward motion increased. As it moved over cooler waters, it weakened a bit to a tropical storm late on July 19. It finally became extratropical on July 20 southwest of Iceland.\nTropical Storm Cristobal.\nA disturbance off the Georgia coast slowly organized itself, and became Tropical Depression Three late on July 18. It strengthened into Tropical Storm Cristobal the next day. It continued to be near and parallel to the Carolina coast, though never making landfall. It became extratropical on July 23.\nHurricane Dolly.\nDolly formed on July 20 from a tropical wave, which was located north of Honduras. Since it became a tropical storm right away it never became a depression while forming. Early on July 21 Dolly made landfall in the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula. The day after that it became a hurricane. Dolly moved northwest and for a little while it was a category 2 hurricane. Dolly weakened a little, back to a category 1 later that day. Very shortly after weakening Dolly made landfall in South Padre Island, Texas. Dolly died over in a very northwestern area of Texas on July 27.\nDolly killed a few people in Mexico and the United States, but in Guatemala Dolly killed at least 17 people. Damage was a little bit more than $1 billion.\nTropical Storm Edouard.\nA shear line stalled in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico in early August as troughing aloft dug into the northeast Gulf of Mexico. This energy aloft helped to organize a surface low along the shearline early on August 2, which slowly organized over the following day. It strengthened into Tropical Depression Five before gaining strength and being named Tropical Storm Edouard on August 3. The storm made landfall in Southeast Texas near Port Arthur on the morning of August 5 as a strong tropical storm. As it moved inland, the system weakened into a tropical depression by afternoon. The depression weakened into a remnant low on August 7 while on land over Texas.\nTropical Storm Fay.\nA strong tropical wave moved into the northeastern Caribbean in mid-August. It caused heavy rain across the Leeward Islands and into Puerto Rico before tracking westward, while unable to develop a low-level circulation although it was producing tropical storm-force winds. On August 15, a closed circulation was found and the system was named Tropical Storm Fay. Later that day Fay caused heavy rains on the island of Hispaniola causing a major flash flood threat. Fay crossed Hispaniola, Cuba, and hit south Florida beginning late on August 18, slowly tracking northeastward across the peninsula. High amounts of flooding happened in much of eastern Florida, along with some wind damage. After crossing into the Atlantic, Fay turned westward again and crossed northern Florida on August 22. As it zigzagged from water to land, it became the first storm in Florida recorded history to make landfall four times. Fay weakened into a tropical depression along the north coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Fay eventually weakened into a remnant low around noon on August 26 while located over Alabama.\nHurricane Gustav.\nA disturbance formed in the deep tropical Atlantic in the fourth week of August. It tracked westward into the Caribbean Sea where it encountered better conditions for cyclone development, and became a tropical depression on the morning of August 25, west of the Windward Islands. It quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Gustav early that afternoon and into Hurricane Gustav early on August 26. It then weakened into a tropical storm on the evening of August 27. It re-organized further south into a strong tropical storm once again on August 28 before speeding up and hitting Jamaica. Gustav has killed 78 people in Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Jamaica, while 7 are still missing in Haiti. On August 29, it strengthened back into a hurricane. On the morning of August 30, it was upgraded to a Category 3 major hurricane. After strengthening slowed for a few hours, another round of quick strengthening happened and Gustav was upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane during a hurricane hunter flight around 1pm (EDT), with 145\u00a0mph winds. Continuing to intensify, it became a 150\u00a0mph storm that afternoon near 5\u00a0P.M. EDT. Soon after Gustav made landfall in Cuba, firstly on the island of Isla de la Juventud and later on the mainland near Los Palacios in Pinar del R\u00edo Province, causing severe damage, although it is difficult to predict how much damage it caused. It then emerged into the Gulf of Mexico weakening into a minimal 115\u00a0mph. It was expected to hit Louisiana so the mayor of New Orleans evacuated the city. At 8\u00a0a.m. CDT on the 2nd September it was reported to have weakened to category 2.\nHurricane Gustav made landfall in Louisiana on September 1, and quickly weakened over land. After weakening to a tropical depression September 4, Gustav was sucked into a cold front. Gustav was responsible for 138 deaths and up to $18\u00a0billion in damage.\nHurricane Hanna.\nTropical Depression Eight formed on August 28 from a low pressure area east-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands. It was upgraded to a tropical storm later that day and named Hanna. On September 1, while Hanna was moving very near to the island of Mayaguana in the Bahamas, it was upgraded to Category\u00a01 hurricane status. Hanna wandered around the southeastern Bahamas, weakening to a tropical storm while also dumping heavy rain on already-devastated Haiti. Hanna moved rapidly northeastwards along the east coast of the United States as a tropical storm. Hanna changed into an extratropical cyclone as it moved offshore from Massachusetts early on September 7. At least 537 deaths have been blamed on Hanna, most in Haiti.\nHurricane Ike.\nA tropical disturbance formed off the coast of Africa near the end of August. It moved south of Cape Verde and slowly strengthened. On September 1, It became Tropical Depression Nine while west of the Cape Verde islands and strengthened into a tropical storm later that day, when it was given the name \"Ike\". Ike developed an eye late on September 3 as it did explosive intensification, as it strengthened from a tropical storm to a Category 4 hurricane in twelve hours with an guessed pressure drop of 43 mbars, from 991 to 948 mbar; and a 24-hour pressure drop of 61 mbar, from 996 to 935 mbars. Ike weakened back to a Category 2 hurricane before re-intensifying back to a Category 4. It ripped across Great Inagua Island and Grand Turk Island, where 80% of the buildings on Grand Turk were seriously damaged or completely destroyed. It weakened to a strong Category 3 late in the afternoon of September 7 as it headed for landfall on the northeastern coastline of Cuba that evening. In addition, the storm killed at least 74 people in Haiti and 1 person in the Dominican Republic.\nAs Ike crossed Cuba on September 8, It weakened to a Category 1 hurricane and emerged into the Caribbean Sea, where it moved along or just off of the southern coast of Cuba. Ike killed 7 people as it effected nearly the whole county of Cuba. It made landfall on Galveston Island on September 13 as a strong category 2 hurricane, Its big size brought storm surge of over 12\u00a0feet from Galveston Island eastward into southern Louisiana. The Bolivar Peninsula was worst affected by the surge, while Galveston Island (where waves topped the seawall) and the Port Arthur areas also saw a lot of damage. Power was knocked out to most of the Houston area and windows were blown out of skyscrapers in downtown Houston. As Ike moved inland, it brought moderate flooding and wind damage during the Midwest and as far north as Pennsylvania. It became extratropical on September 14. At least 82 deaths have been blamed on Ike in the U.S., with 44 of them caused directly.\nDamage from Ike is guessed at $31.5 billion (2008 USD), the third most damaging hurricane in U.S. history, behind Katrina in 2005 and Andrew in 1992. At least 166 deaths have been blamed on Ike, of which 82 were in the United States. It was the most damaging hurricane in Texas history. Ike was an extremely big and strong storm. At one point, the diameter of Ike's tropical storm and hurricane-force winds were 550 and 240\u00a0miles (885 and 390\u00a0km) making Ike one of the biggest Atlantic hurricane recorded. Ike also had the second highest IKE (Integrated Kinetic Energy) of any Atlantic storm in the past 40 years. Integrated Kinetic Energy is a measure of storm surge damaging potential, similar to the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale, though the IKE is more complex and in many ways more accurate. On a scale that ranges from 1 to 6, with 6 being highest destructive potential, Ike earned a 5.2.\nTropical Storm Josephine.\nA tropical disturbance formed off the coast of Africa near the end of August. It tracked south of Cape Verde and slowly developed. On September 2, it became Tropical Depression Ten while south-southeast of the southernmost Cape Verde islands. The depression was upgraded to a tropical storm later the same day as it passed to the south of the Cape Verde islands. A few days later it weakened back to a tropical depression. On September 6 it dissipated in the open waters of the Atlantic.\nHurricane Kyle.\nA strong tropical disturbance tracked across the northeastern Caribbean Sea in the third week of September. It meandered around Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, dumping lots of rain across those islands causing a significant amount of damage, despite never developing a closed circulation. By September 24, it began to track northward away from the islands and into the open Atlantic water, and became a tropical storm on September 25. Kyle was upgraded to a hurricane during the afternoon of September 27. It continued northward and maintained hurricane strength until landfall near Yarmouth, Nova Scotia in Canada late on September 28. A few hours later, Kyle became extratropical as the cold waters of the Bay of Fundy took effect. In general, Maritimers were spared of the expected damage.\nTropical Storm Laura.\nIn the last week of September, a very large non-tropical system over the north-central Atlantic slowly moved westward away from the Azores. As it entered warmer waters, it slowly gained tropical characteristics and was declared Subtropical Storm Laura early on September 29. It became fully tropical the next day and was reclassified as Tropical Storm Laura. On October 1 it became \"post-tropical\" (in the forecaster's words) as it moved over cooler waters.\nTropical Storm Marco.\nTropical Depression Thirteen formed from a very small but well-organized low in the Bay of Campeche on October 6. It quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Marco with 65\u00a0mph (100\u00a0km/h) winds that afternoon. Marco made landfall near Veracruz, Mexico the next morning at the same intensity. Marco dissipated that night as the small circulation moved inland. At one point, tropical storm-force winds were estimated to extend only 10\u00a0miles from the center, which makes it the smallest tropical cyclone on record, beating Cyclone Tracy.\nTropical Storm Nana.\nTropical Storm Nana formed on October 12 from a disturbance which had been drifting toward the northwest over the previous couple days in the middle of the tropical Atlantic Ocean roughly halfway between the west coast of Africa and the Lesser Antilles. The storm weakened into a remnant low on October 14. This is the first use of the name \"Nana\" since 1990.\nHurricane Omar.\nA tropical disturbance in the eastern Caribbean Sea was in an area not expecting any development in the second week of October. While drifting across the region, upper-level winds calmed down enough for the tropical disturbance to strengthen and to develop into Tropical Depression Fifteen on October 13. It strengthened to Tropical Storm Omar the next day. Omar quickly strengthened into a 70\u00a0mph (110\u00a0km/h) storm that afternoon, and became a hurricane that night. It remained a hurricane through that night and it changed little in intensity through the next day, but that evening Omar intensified quickly and became a 115\u00a0mph Category 3 storm, and became a 125\u00a0mph (205\u00a0km/h) storm the next morning. Omar became a weak Category 4 early that morning. However, wind shear and dry air quickly weakened Omar to a minimal hurricane that afternoon as it raced towards the northeast at 26\u00a0mph (41\u00a0km/h). After dropping to tropical storm strength it became a hurricane again on October 17. It degenerated to a remnant low on October 18.\nTropical Depression Sixteen.\nTropical Depression Sixteen slowly formed off the coast of Nicaragua. It was not till October 14 that it was then called Tropical Depression Sixteen. After hugging the northern coast of Honduras (which did not let it strengthen), Tropical Depression Sixteen made landfall near midday on October 15. It dissipated inland that evening, never becoming a tropical storm. This storm caused up to $150 million in damage (2008 USD), and may have caused at least 75 deaths.\nHurricane Paloma.\nAn area of low pressure stopped moving in the Caribbean Sea without showing tropical development for the first few days at the beginning of November. On November 5, the low pressure system became Tropical Depression Seventeen while just east of Nicaragua. The next day it became Tropical Storm Paloma. It was the first tropical storm to receive this female name. Paloma then made landfall in Cuba and moved slowly and quickly dissipated on November 9. The remains of Paloma were tracked till they came ashore of the Florida Panhandle. Paloma caused up to $315 million (2008 USD) in damage in the area Paloma affected.\nAccumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE).\nThe table on the right shows the ACE for each storm in the season. ACE is a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed, so storms that last a long time, as well as strong hurricanes, have high ACEs. ACE is only officially released for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34\u00a0knots (39\u00a0mph, 63\u00a0km/h) or tropical storm strength. Subtropical storms are not included in season totals.\nStorm names.\nThis is the list of names used for named storms that form in the North Atlantic in 2008. The list is the same as the 2002 list except for Ike and Laura, because Isidore and Lili were bad storms in 2002, and their names were retired.\nRetirement.\nOn April 22, 2009, World Meteorological Organization retired the names \"Gustav\", \"Ike\", and \"Paloma\" from its rotating name lists. The names were replaced with \"Gonzalo\", \"Isaias\", and \"Paulette\"."}

It is made of charged protons, electrons and plasma shot out of the Sun, and creates the heliosphere. The wind is shot out at hypersonic speed, so fast that it can travel the whole length of the Solar System, nearly one light year. \nThe particles are dangerous to astronauts and spacecraft. The Earth's magnetic field absorbs or soaks up a lot of the solar wind causing the aurora, the Northern lights and Southern lights.\nAt a distance of more than a few solar radii from the Sun, the solar wind reaches speeds of 250 to 750 kilometers per second and is supersonic.\nA disturbance in the solar wind is called a \"solar storm\". Sometimes it causes a geomagnetic storm. Such a storm in 1989 brought down the Quebec electric power grid and put the entire province in darkness. The largest recorded geomagnetic storm was in September 1\u20132, 1859. If we were to have another as strong as that one it might cause up to 2 trillion dollars damage. \nSolar wind also causes the tail of a comet. When the comet is close enough to the sun that the heat evaporates some of the comet's ice, the motion of the solar wind causes the resulting water vapor and space dust to stream away from the comet. Because it is blown by the solar wind, the comet's tail does not trail behind it, but always points directly away from the sun. \nThe Solar Wind Composition Experiment of the Apollo program studied the atoms in the solar wind.

Stephen Kendrick co-wrote the movie with his brother, while serving as a producer. The supporting cast is made up of volunteers from Sherwood Baptist Church in Albany, Georgia, where the Kendrick brothers are associate pastors. The movie has Kirk Cameron as Caleb Holt in his first theater-released movie since 2001's \"\".\nOn May 21, 2008, Sherwood Pictures said that the movie would open in theaters on September 26, 2008. It was given an MPAA rating of PG for \"thematic material and some peril\".\nPlot.\n\"Fireproof\" is the story of a firefighter, Captain Caleb Holt, who lives by the old firefighter's adage: \"Never leave your partner behind\". But, after seven years of marriage to his wife Catherine, their own relationship is failing. Neither one understands the pressures the other faces. Caleb claims that Catherine is too sensitive and \"doesn't show me respect.\" Whereas she tells her hospital co-workers that he is \"so insensitive\" and that \"he doesn't listen to me\" and \"doesn't understand my needs.\" As they prepare to file for divorce, Caleb's father challenges his son to commit to a 40-day test called \"The Love Dare.\" Caleb starts it, but more for his father's sake than for his marriage.\nWhen Caleb learns the book's daily challenges are tied into his parents' newfound faith, his already limited interest is made smaller still. Even though he wants to stay true to the promise to his father, Caleb becomes frustrated time and time again. He finally asks his father, \"How am I supposed to show love to somebody who constantly rejects me?\" When his father tells him that this is the love God shows to people, Caleb makes a life-changing commitment to love God. And, with God's help, he begins to understand what it means to truly love his wife. But, he is unsure if it's too late to \"fireproof\" his marriage.\nProduction.\n\"Fireproof\" was filmed for 30 days over a two-month period between late October 2007 and December 14, 2007. The production was based on a budget of $500,000, which was more than $100,000 which Sherwood Pictures' had used to make \"Facing the Giants\". \"Fireproof\" was shot in sixteen locations, all of which were donated. Craig von Buseck of the Christian Broadcasting Network said that the movie was \"beautifully shot in and around Albany, Georgia, home to Sherwood Church.\" The Albany Fire Department donated their fire station locations, trucks and even some of their crew for use during the filming. Stephen Kendrick said, \"We\u2019ve never claimed that our movies are Academy Award winning. [...] But we are trying to pursue excellence.\"\nMarriage views.\n\"Fireproof\" is partnered with \"Fireproof My Marriage\", an organization created to strengthen and heal marriages. \"The Love Dare\", a book written by Alex and\nStephen Kendrick, is a major topic in the movie, being one of the main points of the plot. Alex Kendrick said in an interview that this movie would be \"a drama/romance about marriage. Our goal is to reinforce God's intention for marriage.\"\nWith 50% of all marriages in the United States ending in divorce, \"Fireproof\" has been endorsed by many marriage-oriented organizations, some of them are FamilyLife, \"The Marriage CoMission\", \"The Association of Marriage and Family Ministries\", \"Marriage Alive Communications\" and \"MarriageToday\". The movie has been uniting many other marriage advocates from all over the United States.\nReception.\nChristian groups.\n\"Fireproof\" has been given very good reviews from Christian groups since it was first seen. Mitch Temple of Focus on the Family said that, \"This brilliantly produced film radiates messages of authentic determination, faith and hope, even for those of us who have felt like giving up on our marriages.\" Michael Foust of the Baptist Press said that, \"I walked into the theater without any expectations, but walked out after the closing credits believing I had just seen perhaps the most convicting and inspiring film I had ever viewed. Fireproof isn't just a great Christian movie. It's a great movie. Period.\"\nWhile watching the movie for the second time, Steven Isaac of Plugged In said, \"I was with my bride of 14 years. [...] All I wanted to do was hold her hand.\"\nMovies critics.\nThis movie has also been given mixed reviews from movie critics. Chris Willman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" gave the movie a \"C,\" and said that, \"the conversion subplot feels shoehorned into the more crucial marital doings, as if coming to Jesus might be just one of a long checklist of steps to restore sizzle to your marriage, right between buying roses and preparing a candlelit dinner.\"\nFrank Scheck of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" said, \"While hardly sophisticated in its approach and certainly not polished in its technical elements, the movie does get its heartfelt message across with undeniable sincerity. Its success at the boxoffice, which will no doubt continue on home video, demonstrates that there's no shortage of filmgoers dissatisfied with cynical Hollywood product.\" Joe Leydon of \"Variety\" gave the movie a positive review saying \"Cameron is genuinely compelling as Caleb, a work-obsessed firefighter on the verge of divorce from his neglected wife.\"\nBox office.\nBefore it was released, \"Fireproof\" made up 40% of all Fandango sales by Friday morning. In the week before opening, \"Fireproof\" had pre-sold more than $1 million in tickets. \"Fireproof\" was released on September 26, 2008 in 839 theaters. In its first weekend, \"Fireproof\" grossed over $6.8 million, putting it in fourth place at the box office. Through October 15, 2008, \"Fireproof\" had stayed in the top 10 movies in America. In its theater run, \"Fireproof\" earned about $33,415,129, more than tripling the lifetime earnings of the movie made before it, \"Facing the Giants\", and making it the 5th biggest Christian movie ever."}

Gardiner used several different names during his life. He was leader of a gang that did one of Australia's biggest ever robberies. He is the only person ever exiled (sent away) from Australia. He was born in Scotland, and came to Australia with his family in 1834. They lived at Boro, near Goulburn, New South Wales.\nBushranger.\nFrank Gardiner was also called 'The Darkie'. He became a bushranger with John Peisley and robbed people on the roads near Cowra. In July 1861 he shot and wounded two policemen, Sergeant John Middleton and Trooper Hosie who had tried to capture him. He was captured but managed to escape. Trooper Hosie is thought to have taken a bribe and let him go. Gardiner and Peisley went to hide in the Weddin Mountains and joined up with other bushrangers John Gilbert and Ben Hall. The gang was able to move too quickly for the police to catch up because they had help from local people. On 15 June 1862 near Eugowra the gang robbed the gold coach and got away with \u00a314,000. This is about $4 million in 2003 money value. This was Australia's biggest gold robbery. Other men in the gang were Daniel Charters, John Fordyce, John Bow and Henry Manns. The police were quickly at the scene of the robbery and began following the gang. The police found the horse used to carry the gold and recovered most of it. A couple of days later the police were able to capture Gardiner and two other gang members. The next day, six bushrangers led by John Gilbert, held up the police and released Gardiner. The police watched all Gardiner's friends very closely. Many were arrested. Gardiner and Kate Brown decided it was not safe to stay.\nLater life.\nHe moved to Queensland with his mistress, Mrs. Kate Brown. Kate was the sister of Ben Hall's wife. Together they opened a small shop and hotel at Apis Creek near Rockhampton. After Kate wrote a letter to her family the police found out where they were living. The police were able to find Gardiner and arrested him in February 1864. In court the jury decided he had not tried to kill police Sergeant Middleton, but that he was a robber. The judge, (Sir) Alfred Stephen, sent him to gaol for 32 years. There is a folk song called \"Frank Gardiner\". The first line is \"Oh, Frank Gardiner he is caught at last he lies in Sydney jail.\" Kate Brown went to the Thames goldfields in New Zealand where she killed herself in 1868.\nExile.\nIn 1872 Gardiner's lawyer organized a lot of people to write to the governor to get him to let Gardiner out of gaol. The governor, Sir Hercules Robinson, agreed that Gardiner had been given too many years in prison. Gardiner was released in 1874 on the condition that he left Australia. This decision caused a lot of arguments, even in the New South Wales parliament. It led to the end of the Parkes's government.\nOn 27 July Gardiner left Australia and by February 1875 he was in San Francisco. He ran a hotel called the Twilight Saloon. The Australian newspapers often had stories about him. He married a rich widow and had twin sons, some even writing he had died in a gunfight in Colorado in 1903. Most of these stories could not be proved. A lot of the gold stolen in the Eugowra robbery was retreived back by the police, Gardiner's share was never found. There are stories of unknown Americans digging on the site of Frank Gardiner's old house in 1910. Were these Frank's sons searching for the missing gold?"}

Usually the temperature instead changes because of changes in pressure.\nAdiabatic cooling is the usual cause of clouds. When warm, humid air rises due to convection or other cause, water condenses to make clouds, and in some cases precipitation. Convection also causes cold air to sink. This warms it adiabatically, often destroying a cloud and sometimes causing any precipitation to evaporate before hitting the ground.\nDescription.\nIf we take some fluids in an insulated system and expand or compress the system very fast, the system won't be able to gain or loose any heat (from outside of the system). (In reality, you can't get a perfectly insulated system. But in some cases, the heat transfer is so low that we can call them adiabatic process.)\nFrom the first law of thermodynamics, we know that,\nHere, formula_2 is the change of internal energy; formula_3 is the change of heat and formula_4 is the change of work.\nSince there occurs no heat transfer in adiabatic process, the formula_3 becomes 0. So, for adiabatic process, the equation is,\nAgain, we know that formula_7.(formula_8;formula_9; formula_10; so, formula_7)\nHere, formula_12 is volume; formula_13 is force; formula_14 is pressure; formula_15 is the area and formula_16 is the distance.\nSo, the equation stands as,\nWhich means, by doing work (changing volume), one can change the internal energy (and so the temperature) in a adiabatic process.\nAdiabatic process for ideal gas (for reversible adiabatic process).\nIn the case of Adiabatic process (see the upper section), \nAgain, in constant volume, the heat capacity of one mole gas is, \nHere, formula_20 is the change of temperature and formula_21 is the temperature\u0964\nBut, in constant volume (as no work is done),\nSo,\nFrom the first (1) equation, \nNow, the Ideal gas law for one mole gas is,\nHere, formula_26 is the gas constant.\nBy differentiating the last equation,\nOr,\nformula_28\nNow from equation (2), we get, \nSince, formula_30 (Mayer's relation),\nHere, formula_32 is the heat capacity of gas at constant pressure.\nSimplifying the equation (3),\nIf,\nThen,\nBy dividing both sides of the equation (4) with formula_36 we get,\nIntegrating (Integration leaves a constant) the equation (5),\nIf we assume that,\nWe get,\nSimplifying the equation (6),\nThis is the relation between pressure and volume in adiabatic process."}

Its scientific name is Carcharocles megalodon. It lived from the early Miocene to the Pliocene epochs, 23 to 3.6 million years ago (mya). It is not closely related to the present-day great white shark.\nMegalodon had teeth, which are among the largest ever found, over long. Nicolaus Steno was the first to recognize the teeth as those of a giant shark. Paleontologists calculate that the shark was up to 18 meters (59 ft) long with average length of 10.5 meters (34 ft). It weighed up to 48-49 metric tons.\nPaleoecology.\nFossil records of \"C. megalodon\" indicate that it occurred in subtropical to temperate latitudes. Before the formation of the Isthmus of Panama, the seas were relatively warmer. This would have made it possible for the species to live in all the oceans of the world.\n\"C. megalodon\" lived in many marine environments (i.e. continental shelf waters, coastal upwelling, swampy coastal lagoons, sandy littorals, and offshore deep water environments), and moved from place to place. Adult \"C. megalodon\" were not abundant in shallow water environments, and mostly lurked offshore. \"C. megalodon\" may have moved between coastal and oceanic waters, at different stages in its life.\nIts prey.\nMegalodon hunted large and medium-sized whales, attacking the bony areas, such as chest, fins, or tail. This would stop the whale, or it could kill quickly with a fatal bite to the chest region. The megalodon bite is considered one of the strongest bites in the animal kingdom\u2019s history.\nIts great size, high-speed swimming capability, and powerful jaws coupled with formidable killing apparatus, made it an apex predator eating a range of fauna.\nFossil evidence is that \"C. megalodon\" preyed on cetaceans (i.e., dolphins, small whales, and \"Odobenocetops\", and large whales, (including sperm whales, bowhead whales, and rorquals pinnipeds, porpoises, sirenians, and giant sea turtles.\nMarine mammals were regular prey targets for megalodon. Many whale bones have been found with clear signs of large bite marks (deep gashes) made by teeth that match those of megalodon, and various excavations have revealed megalodon teeth lying close to the chewed remains of whales, and sometimes in direct association with them. Fossil evidence of interactions between megalodon and pinnipeds also exist. In one interesting observation, a megalodon tooth was found lying very close to a bitten earbone of a sea lion.\nRelationships.\nMegalodon is now considered to be a member of the family Otodontidae, genus \"Carcharocles\". Megalodon's older classification into \"Carcharodon\" was due to dental similarity with the great white shark. Most authors now think this is due to convergent evolution. The great white shark is more closely related to the extinct broad-toothed mako (\"Isurus hastalis\") than to megalodon. The dentition in those two sharks is similar, whereas megalodon teeth have much finer serrations than great white shark teeth. The great white shark is more closely related to the mako shark (\"Isurus\" spp.), with a most recent common ancestor about 4 mya. Those who still think megalodon and the great white shark are more closely related, argue that the differences between their dentition are minute and obscure."}

The Dust Bowl spread from Saskatchewan and Manitoba to the north, all the way to Oklahoma and parts of Texas and New Mexico in the south. In these areas, there were many serious dust storms and droughts during the 1930s. These caused major damage to the Dust Bowl areas' economies, ecology, and agriculture. The dust bowl was the worst man made disaster in U.S history. It was many dust storms that happened for many years. \nCauses.\nThe people who lived in the Dust Bowl area were mostly farmers. Many years of intense farming without rain left the soil dry. When strong winds blew, they covered cities, towns, and farms in dried, dusty soil, ruining the farmland. \n\"Black Sunday\".\nOne famous storm on April 14, 1935, called \"Black Sunday\", was so bad it covered dozens of cities in black clouds of dust and made it impossible to see the sky or even a few feet ahead. Writer Timothy Egan says that the Black Sunday storm \"carried away twice as much dirt as was dug out of the earth to create the Panama Canal.\"\nEffects.\nThe Dust Bowl period is still considered one of the worst environmental disasters in United States history. Many thousands of people died from breathing in the dust, or from starvation. Many others who survived lost everything they had, and left the Dust Bowl to look for work in other parts of the country. These people were called \"Dust Bowl refugees.\"\nThe seriousness of the Dust Bowl disaster later led to greater use of crop rotation, reforesting and other techniques to preserve the quality and quantity of topsoil in American and Canadian farms. Many songs, books, and works of art were created to tell stories of the people affected by the dust storms. Some of the most famous of these works are the novels \"The Grapes of Wrath\" and \"Of Mice and Men\", by John Steinbeck, the songs of folk music singer Woody Guthrie, and the photography of Dorothea Lange, who took pictures of many Dust Bowl refugees and their families.\nPhoto gallery"}

The first fossil Mosasaur, \"Mosasaurus hoffmanni\", was found in the Netherlands in 1776.p7 It was named in 1822 by W.D. Conybeare.\nDiscovery and interpretation.\nThe type specimen was found in a chalk quarry in Maastricht, Holland. It was found by a German army surgeon, Johann Hoffmann, who collected fossils for the Haarlem Museum. During a struggle for ownership, the skeletal parts went to the museum, whilst the skull stayed with the owner of the land, who refused to let anyone see it.\nThe true identity of the monster was decided correctly by the French anatomist Georges Cuvier. In 1795 French troops were outside Maastricht, and Cuvier arranged for the large skull to be saved when they stormed the town. The skull duly went to Cuvier in Paris, because he was the leading comparative anatomist of the day. He recognized the skull as that of a giant lizard, from its teeth and skull bones,p10 though not until 1808, and by then the son of a Dutch professor, Adriaan Camper, had already had the same idea. The discovery of the specimen was important in another way, because it helped to convince Cuvier that extinction of some species was a fact. Cuvier later came up with a catastrophism-type theory.\nHabitat.\nMosasaurs breathed air, were powerful swimmers, and were well-adapted to living in the warm, shallow epicontinental seas of the Upper Cretaceous. Mosasaurs were so well adapted to this environment that they gave birth to live young, rather than return to the shore to lay eggs, as sea turtles do. Thousands of fossils have been found, from every continent. There are about 40 known species. Most skeletons have been found in North America in chalk laid down in the Western Interior Seaway.\nAn interesting fact is that ichthyosaurs had died out by the middle of the Upper Cretaceous, and plesiosaurs and sea-going crocodiles were in decline. The reasons for this are not known: perhaps there was increased competition from large predator fish. It is this large marine predator niche that mosasaurs apparently occupied. They gave birth to live young, just as the ichthyosaurs had done. They flourished in the later Cretaceous, only to become extinct at the K/T extinction event.\nSize.\nThe type species was estimated to be 33' (10m) long. \"Mosasaurus\" had four paddle-like limbs on a long, streamlined body and a long, powerful tail. The large head had huge jaws, up to 4\u00a0ft (1.2 m long) with many teeth. The jaws could open about 3 feet (1 m). The lower jaw is loosely hinged to the skull with a moveable joint on each side (behind the teeth). This loose joint let it swallow huge prey. They would have hunted fish, turtles, molluscs, and shellfish. Ammonites have been found bearing mosasaur teeth marks.\nThe smallest-known mosasaur was \"Carinodens belgicus\", which was about to long and probably lived in shallow waters near shore, cracking molluscs and sea urchins with its bulbous teeth. Larger mosasaurs were more typical: mosasaurs ranged in size up to . \"Hainosaurus\" holds the record for longest mosasaur, at .\nScientists have wondered whether ancient reptiles like mosasaurs were warm-blooded or cold-blooded. Scientists from the University of Plymouth studied many animals that dive and hold their breath, from insects to whales. They found that larger animals can hold their breath longer than smaller animals because they can store more oxygen for their size, and they found this difference was much bigger for warm-blooded animals than for cold-blooded animals. They said this could be why modern whales became so large. They concluded that the large size of mosasaurs, like whales, meant they were more likely to be warm-blooded than cold-blooded.\nOther species.\nMany other species of mosasaur have since been found, for example, \"Tylosaurus\". \"Mosasaurus maximus\" was found at Onion Creek, Texas. All have the same general body style and pattern of life, though some, like \"Prognathodon\", had crushing teeth for dealing with shellfish. Present thought is that their closest living relatives are the monitor lizards."}

It was released on September 24, 1991 by DGC Records. It was produced by Butch Vig and was the first release by the band on the record label. It was also the first release with drummer Dave Grohl.\nEven though it wasn't thought to have been very popular before its release, \"Nevermind\" was a very big success. On January 11, 1992, it had reached number one on the US \"Billboard\" 200. The main single, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was very successful and reached number six on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The three other singles were: \"Come as You Are\", \"Lithium\", and \"In Bloom\". \"Nevermind\" was selling up to 300,000 copies a week between 1991 and 1992.\n\"Nevermind\" has sold over 30 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums ever. \"Nevermind\" helped to make both grunge music and alternative rock popular. It has been known as one of the greatest albums of all time.\nBackground.\nNirvana was a rock band from Aberdeen, Washington, formed by Kurt Cobain (vocals and guitar) and Krist Novoselic (bass guitar) in 1987. They first signed to the Seattle record label Sub Pop. The band released their first album on this label called \"Bleach\" in 1989 with Chad Channing on drums. Channing left Nirvana after this album in 1990, and the band needed a drummer. After seeing punk band Scream, Cobain and Novoselic liked the drumming by Dave Grohl. When Scream broke up after this, Grohl joined Nirvana as the drummer.\nDuring the start of the 1990s, Sub Pop was having a difficult time with money. Because of this, Nirvana looked for a new record label. They ended up signing with DGC Records\nTitle and cover.\nThe first name for the album before its release was \"Sheep\". This came from the kind of people Cobain thought were going to buy the album (sheep is a word meaning someone who does what other people do). The title was later changed to \"Nevermind\" as it was what Cobain thought about bad things in his life.\nThe album cover of \"Nevermind\" shows a naked baby (Spencer Elden) swimming underwater with a U.S. dollar bill on a fishhook. This is just out of the baby's reach. Cobain wanted to have a photo of a water birth on the cover but the record label wouldn't let him."}

The only works of art that are known to be definitely by Cimabue are the mosaic of Christ in Majesty in Pisa Cathedral and two very large ruined frescos in the Church of St Francis in Assisi.\nThe most famous painting that is believed to be by Cimabue is the \"Madonna of Santa Trinita\" which is an altarpiece that was done for the Church of the Holy Trinity. It is now in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. He is also believed to have painted two large crucifixes which hung in the Church of St Domenic in Arezzo and the Church of the Holy Cross (Santa Croce, Florence). The crucifix of Santa Croce was ruined in a flood and is now in the church's museum.\nThe biographer Giorgio Vasari wrote about Cimabue's life, 250 years after his death. He wrote that one day Cimabue was walking in the country when he saw a little shepherd boy scratching a picture of a sheep onto a rock. The drawing was so good that Cimabue went to the boy's father and begged that he might take the boy as his apprentice and teach him to paint. The boy was Giotto, who became a very famous painter, and who is thought of as the very first painter of the Italian Renaissance."}

Together with the province of Trento, it makes up the region of Trentino-Alto Adige/S\u00fcdtirol. The province has an area of . About 511,750 people live there (2011). The capital of the province is the city of Bolzano. The borders are Graub\u00fcnden and Lombardia in the west, Tyrol and Salzburg in the north, Trentino and Veneto in the south.\nAlthough it is part of Italy, most of the population speaks German. Around a quarter of the population speak Italian, most of whom live in the two largest cities (Bolzano and Merano). Italian and German are both official languages. In parts of the province, a third language, Ladin, is spoken and official as well. \"South Tyrol\" is the most common name for the province in ancient English. German and Ladin speakers usually refer to the area as \"S\u00fcdtirol\". The official name is the Province of Bolzano (in ; in ; in Ladin: \"Provinzia autonoma de Balsan/Bulsan\u00a0\u2013 S\u00fcdtirol\").\nSouth Tyrol/Alto Adige is an autonomous province. It has its own legislature that makes many laws that are separate from those made by the Italian government. Luis Durnwalder has been the head of government since 1989. He belongs to the South Tyrolean People's Party, which has been governing since 1948.\nName.\nThe name \"Alto Adige\" comes from the river Adige. \"Alto\" means upper, because the upper part of the river flows through the province. \nThe name was first created by the Napoleonic French to distinguish (point out: difference) this Italian-speaking area from the Austrian empire's Tyrol, directly north.\nHistory.\nBetween the Renaissance and the 19th century, the whole area, originally populated only by Latins from the time of Roman Empire, experienced a lot of Germanisation. In the centuries before Napoleon, only the Dolomite's area of the western part of the present area of South Tyrol (especially the Val Venosta near Merano) remained neolatin.\nAustria controlled the territory under the name of \"South Tyrol\" until 1918, performing a complete Germanisation policy after the wars of the Italian independence.\nAfter the First World War, despite the fact that its inhabitants were almost entirely German-speaking, South Tyrol was assigned to the Kingdom of Italy by the Treaty of Saint-Germain and the name officially was changed to \"Alto Adige\". This happened on the basis of the wishes of the Italian irredentists, who considered the Alto Adige as a geographical territory of Italy and based this on the fact that originally the territory had been mostly of \"Ladin language\" until the fourteenth century. Besides, the fascist government favoured the industrialisation of the province to attract Italian immigrants: as a result of this \"Italianisation\", today 120,000 people or 23% of the population down from 135,000in 1960 (35%) use Italian as their mother tongue.\nThe ruling political party in South Tyrol is the \"S\u00fcdtiroler Volkspartei\", which has had an absolute majority since 1947 because of the large amount of German speakers. Just after World War II about 65% of the population spoke German as their mother tongue, about a third spoke Italian, and about five percent spoke the Ladin language. In the 2011 census the percentages were: 63%, 23% and 4% (another 10% are immigrants from outside Italy)."}

{"id": "127148", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=127148", "title": "Black Swallowtail", "text": "The Black Swallowtail (\"Papilio polyxenes\") is a species of butterfly. It is also called the American Swallowtail or Parsnip Swallowtail. It is found throughout much of North America.\nDescription.\nThe Black Swallowtail has a wingspan of 6.7 to 10 cm (2.7 to 4 in). The upper side of the male's wings is black. There are two rows of yellow spots along the edges of both wings. There is a small area of blue on the bottom wing between the two rows of yellow spots.On the bottom edge of the bottom wing, there is a red spot with a small black dot in the center. The upper side of the female's wings is black. There are two rows of light yellow spots along the edges of both wings. These spots are smaller than the male's. There is a large area of blue on the bottom wing between these two rows. The female also has the same red and black spot on the bottom wing as the male. The female mimics the Pipevine Swallowtail (\"Battus philenor\"). The underside of the wings is the same in both sexes. The top wing is black with two rows of yellow-orange spots. The bottom wing has two rows of orange spots with a blue area between them.\nTaxonomy.\nThe Ozark Swallowtail (\"Papilio joanae\") and the Black Swallowtail were once thought to be the same species. Felix Sperling did an analysis of the Ozark Swallowtail's DNA. He suggested that even though the Ozark Swallowtail looks exactly like the Black Swallowtail, it is actually more closely related to the Old World Swallowtail (\"Papilio machaon\").\nIn North Dakota and southern Manitoba, the Black Swallowtail is thought to breed with the Old World Swallowtail. These hybrids are called Kahli Swallowtails. Kahli Swallowtails are either thought to be a separate species or a subspecies of the Black Swallowtail.\nThe Desert Black Swallowtail (\"P. p. coloro\") is a subspecies of the Black Swallowtail. It is found in southeastern California, southern Nevada, and western Arizona. It is similar to the male Black Swallowtail, but it has more yellow and the sexes look the same.\nSimilar species.\nThere are many similar species in the Black Swallowtails range.\nThe Pipevine Swallowtail is similar to the female Black Swallowtail. On the upper side of its wings it does not have any yellow spots. The bottom wing is a shiny, dark blue. It has one row of whitish spots in the middle of the bottom wing. The underside of the bottom wing has only one row of orange spots.\nThe Spicebush Swallowtail (\"Papilio troilus\") is similar to the female Black Swallowtail. It is usually larger. The upper side of its wings is black with one row of light greenish-blue spots along the edges of both wings.\nThe Ozark Swallowtail looks exactly like the Black Swallowtail. It can only be separated by habitat and host plant choices (the host plant is the plant that the caterpillar feeds on). It is found in woodlands. The host plants are Meadow Parsnip (\"Thaspium barbinode\") and Yellow Pimpernal (\"Taenidia intregerrima\").\nThe Old World Swallowtail has many different forms. The form \"brucei\" is very similar to both sexes of the Black Swallowtail. Form \"brucei\" is usually smaller. The black dot in the red spot on the bottom wing is not centered.\nRange and distribution.\nThe Black Swallowtail ranges from southern Canada south to Florida and Costa Rica west to the Rocky Mountains and eastern Arizona south to Mexico and Peru.\nHabitat.\nThe Black Swallowtail likes open habitats. It is found from sea level to high mountains. It is found in fields, meadows, deserts, marshes, near lakes and streams, farms, lawns, near cities, near roads, and gardens. It is rarely (unusually) found in forests or woodlands.\nHumans have greatly helped the Black Swallowtail. They brought non-native carrot species from Europe to North America. The Black Swallowtail uses these plants as host plants. Before humans cut down forests, Black Swallowtail were rare. They were only found in small prairies, wetlands, and openings in forests. However, in the northeast, people are not farming as much as they used to. This is making the Black Swallowtail become less common in this part of its range.\nFlight period.\nThe Black Swallowtail is seen from May to June in Canada. It is seen from June to August in the Colorado Mountains. In the eastern part of its range, it is seen from April to October and from February to October in Florida. In Arizona, it is seen from February to November. It has one brood (one group of offspring) in Canada and the Colorado Mountains. It has 2 to 3 broods in the rest of its range.\nBehavior.\nThe Black Swallowtail flies very fast. Its flight is much quicker than other swallowtails. The Black Swallowtail flies closer to the ground than other swallowtails do. In cold weather, they will hold their abdomens above their wings. This keeps them warm. Usually, Black Swallowtails live about 10 to 12 days. Some however, can live up to 35 to 40 days.\nAdult food sources.\nHere is a list of food sources for the Black Swallowtail:\nMales will also come to damp soil and mud to feed on minerals and moisture. This is called puddling.\nLife cycle.\nThe Black Swallowtail goes through complete metamorphosis.\nMating.\nThe male forms a territory. The territory is usually on the top of a hill. The male will sit on high branches or other vegetation on the hill. He will defend his territory from other male Black Swallowtails. If other males come too close, he will chase them away. The female will fly to the top of the hill to look for a mate. A successful courtship lasts for about 40 seconds. An unsuccessful one lasts for about 100 seconds. Mating lasts for about 45 minutes. Females that do not want to mate will try to escape from males by flying high in the air and then quickly flying downward.\nEgg.\nFemale Black Swallowtails fly close to the ground to look for host plants. Females lay one egg per host plant. The eggs are laid on the leaves and flowers. The egg is yellow. It later forms a red ring around the center. It will also form a red top. It will turn dark gray just before hatching. It takes about 10 days to hatch. In a lab test, females laid a total of about 200 to 430 eggs. They laid about 35 to 50 each day.\nCaterpillar.\nThe caterpillar will eat the leaves and flowers of the host plant. It makes no nests. The young caterpillar is black. It has a white spot in the middle of its body. This spot is called a saddle. It mimics a bird dropping. The older caterpillar is green. It has black bands with orange spots in each of the bands. The caterpillar has a special organ called an osmeterium. It is an orange, bad-smelling organ. It is shaped like a snake's tongue. It is kept behind the inside of the head. The caterpillar releases it to scare predators away. The caterpillar will reach a length of 5 cm (2 in). The Ozark Swallowtail caterpillar is similar to the Black Swallowtail caterpillar. It is usually greener, and the black bands are usually thinner.\nChrysalis.\nThe chrysalis hangs upright. There is a silk thread around the upper part of the chrysalis. This thread is called a girdle. The chrysalis is either brown or green. The Black Swallowtail will hibernate as a chrysalis.\nHost plants.\nHere is a list of host plants that the Black Swallowtail caterpillar feeds on:"}

It was used on certain games that let the player play with people around the world.\nOn January 26, 2012, it was announced by Nintendo during an investors' meeting that the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service would be succeeded by and merged into Nintendo Network. This new online system would unite the 3DS and Wii U platforms and replace Friend Codes, provide paid content, an online community style multiplayer system, and personal accounts.\nOn June 27, 2013, WiiConnect24 was shutdown due to the Wii U releasing, and the host Gamespy shutting down.\nBefore Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection shut down, two other apps were discontinued. Wii no Ma closed on April 30, 2012. Then, Kirby TV Channel closed in October 2012.\nFeatures.\nThe Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection was made to be easy to connect to, safe for everyone to use, and free. Games designed to take advantage of Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection offered WFC inside of the game. Basic features included worldwide matchmaking, leaderboards, and tournaments. Additional features were available between friends who exchanged Friend Codes.\nWii Shop Channel.\nThe Wii Shop Channel allows users to download games or software by Wii Points. You can buy Wii Points by Nintendo Point Cards or by Mastercard or Visa cards online. Users can browse the Virtual Console, WiiWare, or Wii Channel sections. Buying or using Wii Points were disabled on March 26th, 2018. The channel shut down on January 30th, 2019.\nCheck Mii Out Channel.\nThe \"Check Mii Out Channel\" is a channel that allows users to share their Mii. It was first available on November 11, 2007. Users can post their own Miis in the Posting Plaza, or import Mii's into their own Mii Parade.\nIn the Contests section, players can submit their own Miis to compete in contests to fit a description (example: Mario without his hat). After the time for sending a Mii has ran out, the user can vote for three Miis featured on the panel, with ten random Miis being shown at a time. Once the judging is over, the results of the contest can be viewed. Their selection and/or submission's popularity in comparison to others is displayed, as well as the winning Mii and user.\nThe Check Mii Out Channel sends messages to the Wii Message Board about recent contests. Users in some contests can add their user and submitted Mii to a photo with a background related to the contest theme. This picture can then be sent to the Wii Message Board. The Check Mii Out Channel was shut down on June 28, 2013.\nMario Kart Channel.\n\"Mario Kart Wii\" allows users to install the Mario Kart Channel. The channel works without the game disc inserted, but to compete in races and time trials, the game must be inserted.\nDemae Channel.\nA food delivery service was released on May 26, 2009, and got discontinued on March 31, 2017.\nWii Message Board.\nThe Message Board's online is discontinued, along with the shutdown with WiiConnect24. Users could leave messages, or other users on a calendar message board. Announcements of updates and video game news were posted by Nintendo. The Wii Message Board could be updated real-time by a game like .\nWii Speak.\nUsers that bought the Wii Speak microphone were able to use the Wii Speak Channel. They could access one of four rooms (with no limit in these rooms). Every user's avatar was their Mii, which lip syncs their words. Users were also able to send voice messages to other users via the Wii Message Board. The Wii Speak Channel was first released on December 5, 2008 in both North America and Europe. \"\" was one of the few games that used the peripheral.\nGames.\nThe first Wi-Fi games were \"Mario Kart DS\" and \"Tony Hawk's American Sk8land\" for the Nintendo DS, Mario Kart DS releasing on November 14, 2005, and Tony Hawk's American Sk8land releasing on November 16, 2005.There were over 100 Wii games, 25 WiiWare games, 93 Nintendo DS games, and 4 DSiWare games that supported the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Some notable games that used the service include \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\", \"Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl\", \"Pok\u00e9mon Black and White\" and \"Pok\u00e9mon Black 2 and White 2\", ', and '.\nSince May 20, 2014 at 10:30 PM EST, users cannot download additional content for games or play online multiplayer as Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection was shut down.\nConnection options.\nNintendo DS.\nThe Nintendo DS has a wireless adapter built in allowing the DS to access WFC via a wireless network. The DS only supports WEP.\nWii.\nThe Wii also has a wireless adapter built in. The Wii supports security protocols WEP, WPA, and WPA2. The Wii can also be connected via a ethernet cable (with an adapter).\nNintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector.\nIf there isn't a compatible Wi-Fi network, the DS and Wii can connect through the Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector. People were able to buy it from the Nintendo Online Store. The product has been discontinued due to legal issues.\nHotspots.\nNintendo made deals with hotspot providers to allow free access for Nintendo DS users. In 2005, Nintendo made an agreement with Wayport, Inc. to provide access in McDonald's restaurants across the U.S. In Canada, Nintendo had partnered with FatPort to create free hotspots. They announced it on October 19, 2005.\nShutdown.\nNintendo Wi-Fi Connection was terminated on May 20, 2014 at 10.30 PM (EST) for all Wii and DS games. Some users were able to keep playing for several hours after the shutdown, online play features incorporated into these games are no longer available without mods. The shutdown is caused by the shutdown of GameSpy, who was bought by Glu Mobile in 2012. The Wii Shop Channel, third-party video services, and the Pay &amp; Play games have been shut down as of February 1, 2019. It is still possible to download purchased content from the Wii Shop Channel. Users can continue to use the Wii U Transfer Tool to transfer Wii data from the Wii to a Wii U, and download \"The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword Save Data Update Channel\" in order to update the game due to a glitch. \nCommunity mods.\nWiimmfi, a replacement service for Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection had opened 10 days before WFC's shutdown. They first only supported Mario Kart Wii, but now support over 500 games. "}

They are known as Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young (CSNY) when joined by occasional fourth member Neil Young, who is from Canada.\nTheir songs include \"Marrakesh Express\", \"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\", \"Teach Your Children\", \"Ohio\" (a protest song, against the Kent State shootings in early 1970), and \"Just A Song Before I Go\".\nComing together.\nIn the 1960s, Stephen Stills and Neil Young were members of another band, called Buffalo Springfield. Crosby was a founding member of The Byrds, and British-born Graham Nash was a member of The Hollies. Crosby was fired from the Byrds late in 1967, and the Buffalo Springfield disbanded the next year. Nash went to California, where the others lived and worked, when the Hollies visited there in 1968. Nash and Crosby had met earlier in England, and got back in touch in California. Crosby and Stills had worked together on two songs, called \"Wooden Ships\" and \"You Don't Have To Cry\". Performing \"You Don't Have To Cry\" for Nash, he joined in on harmonies, and the three noticed they had a special sound together. Nash moved to California, and the three formed a band. They signed a recording contract with Atlantic Records.\nStills and Crosby were free to work together, and record for Atlantic, but Nash still belonged to the Hollies, who had a contract with Epic Records. A trade was worked out, between Atlantic and Epic. In exchange for losing Nash, Epic Records got to sign up another Atlantic band, Poco, formed by Richie Furay from the Buffalo Springfield.\nCSN's first album was released in the spring of 1969, and quickly became a hit. The cover showed Crosby, Stills and Nash sitting on a couch outside an abandoned house. (They did not sit in their name order; they had not yet named the group. When they decided on their name, they wanted to take another picture sitting in order, but the house had already been torn down.) Stephen Stills had played most of the instruments on the album, with Dallas Taylor playing drums. This worked fine for recordings, but not for live appearances. More musicians were needed. A keyboardist and bass guitarist were hired.\nAtlantic Records president Ahmet Ertegun suggested Neil Young, who now had his own band called Crazy Horse, as another guitarist for the group. Stills wasn't sure if Young would work out, but gave him a chance. He fit in so well that CSN made him a full-time member, and added his name to theirs. Young was able to both play with CSN, and keep his own place with Crazy Horse. Their second show as a quartet was at the Woodstock Festival, in August 1969. They toured for the next several months, and released a second album, \"D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu\", early the next year. They made another performing tour, to support the album, which was also a huge hit.\nComing apart.\nThe group was very successful, but its members had many different ideas, and could not always work well together. Tension grew between them, and they nearly disbanded. Young left to return to Crazy Horse, and tour with them on his own. Each of the four recorded a solo album during 1971, though, and each album became a hit. Nash and Crosby toured together, and Stills formed another band, called Manassas, with Chris Hillman of the Byrds. Another round of solo and duo albums was released during 1972, with Young's \"Harvest\" and its single \"Heart Of Gold\" becoming the biggest hits. Albums by the other members were not as successful, though they still sold well. Crosby and Nash got along very well, and worked together as a duo, while Stills joined Young and Crazy Horse to record Young's \"War Song\". Crosby also rejoined the Byrds, but the album they recorded together, \"Byrds\", was not a hit.\nThe four tried to reunite in Hawaii during 1973 to make a new album, \"Human Highway\", but things did not work out. Finally the next year, they reformed and started another tour, with a compilation album, \"So Far\", issued to give them something new to promote. Their shows ran longer than three hours, and there was sometimes trouble. Stills was abusing cocaine, and it made him hard to get along with. The same old tensions also came back. A new CSN&amp;Y project was dashed when Stills and Young erased Crosby and Nash's vocals from the master tapes. Crosby and Nash went off on their own. Stills and Young formed The Stills/Young Band, and released an album, but even that did not work out.\nStills and Young toured together during 1975 and 1976. In July 1976, Young left suddenly between shows, sending Stills a telegram that expressed his unhappiness, and told Stills to \"Eat a peach.\" Stills and Young each had to complete tour dates separately. Meanwhile, Nash and Crosby kept recording and performing together. They also sang background vocals for other artists, including James Taylor (\"Mexico\") and Joni Mitchell (\"Free Man In Paris\").\nBack together.\nDuring one of their shows, Crosby and Nash were joined onstage by Stills, to perform \"Teach Your Children\". The three worked things out, and reformed their trio. \"CSN\" was released in 1977, and \"Just A Song Before I Go\" became a new hit single.\nIn the next years, the trio worked together off and on, and also as solo artists. Young's music had become very different from that of the other band members, and he mostly worked with Crazy Horse, but he did collaborate now and then with CSN. Crosby had his own cocaine problems during the 1980s, and ended up serving a prison sentence. He was able to stop abusing cocaine, as Stills had earlier. CSN's later songs included \"Wasted On The Way\". Nash rejoined the Hollies for a reunion album in 1984, and played shows with them, but the reunion was not a success.\nCSN played in Berlin, Germany at the time the Berlin Wall was torn down, at the end of the 1980s. They also played shows during the 1990s and early 2000s, and their 2000 tour was called the \"CSNY2K\" tour. They recorded other albums, but they were not nearly the hits their early ones had been, and they worked with outside writers, instead of writing all their own songs. Atlantic Records cancelled their contract.\nCrosby, Stills and Nash still work together and apart, with Crosby and Nash having the longest and strongest partnership. Neil Young continues on as a solo artist, with and without Crazy Horse, exploring many different kinds of music."}

It is played between two teams of 4 s on horses, which are called polo ponies. The players try to score goals (points) by putting the ball in the goal. They use long mallets (long sticks). It is the state sport of Ancient Manipur.\nOrigins.\nAccording to the Guinness Book of Records, polo traces its origin to the Ancient Manipur, where it was played as the \"Sagol Kangjei\" (, ) right from 3100 BC.\nVarious forms of Polo, and similar sports, have been long played, traditionally, throughout a wide range covering Assam and Manipur areas of India, Kashmir, Nepal and Tibet, and the Northern valleys of Pakistan such as Gilgit, Hunza Valley, Baltistan and Chitral District and parts of Central Asia as well. In ancient Persia, \"Chavgan\", another form of Polo, was also played. It was only in the mid-19th century that colonial officers in British India began to play this sport and imported it to Britain, where the formal Hurlingham Rules were then laid down. Later, in the 1890s, Polo was also introduced to the United States.\nThe main rules of polo.\nThere are two teams both with 4 players. They play on a field which is 300 yards long (about 275 meters) and 160 or 200 yards wide (about 146 and 183 meters). There are goalposts (long sticks in the ground) 8 yards (7.32 meters) apart at each end of the field. To score, the ball has to go between the other team's goalposts, which is called a goal.\nThe game is 4, 6 or 8 periods (units of time) of 7 minutes, which are called \"chukkas\". Between chukkas, players change ponies.\nIn a game there are 2 umpires on horses and a referee on the side.\nPlayers are given a foul if they break the rules. These rules keep the horses and riders safe. One rule in polo is called the \"line of the ball\" or just the \"line\". The \"line\" is an invisible line between the ball and the player that has the ball. A player has the ball if they are the closest to make a play on the ball. The \"line\" is in the same direction as this player is traveling and extends as far as the player is able to safely stop their horse. If another player crosses the \"line\" (that is, if another player runs in front of the player who has the ball), they will receive a foul. This is a common foul because it is sometimes difficult for a player to tell where the invisible \"line\" is.\nA common defensive play in polo is called \"hooking\". A player may hook an opponent by using their mallet to block an opponent's mallet while the opponent tries to hit the ball. Sometimes it is unsafe for a player to hook their opponent. As an example, reaching over or under the opponent's horse to make a hook is considered unsafe. An unsafe hook will cause the player to foul. If a player cannot safely hook their opponent, they may instead use a different defensive play called a \"ride-off\". A \"ride-off\" happens when a player uses their horse to push an opponent's horse away from the \"line\". This makes it difficult for the opponent to make a play on the ball. If the player crosses the line while trying to ride off their opponent, they will receive a foul.\nIf a player makes a foul, the opponent may get a penalty shot. Penalty shots are made near the goal and other players cannot block the penalty shot.\nPlayer positions.\nEach player has certain responsibilities:\nPolo ponies.\nThe ponies are 14.2 to 16 hands (1 hand equals 4 inches or 10.16 centimetres). They weigh between 900 and 1100lbs-pounds- (about 408 and 499 kilos). Ponies can be ridden to play from the age of 5 up to 18 or even 20 years old sometimes. Polo ponies are not actually ponies because they are full-sized horses. Thoroughbreds are a common horse breed to use as polo ponies because they are fast and agile.\nEquipment.\nThe players have a helmet (hard hat), riding boots, white trousers, a shirt with the player's number on. Sometimes players also have one or two gloves, knee-pads and a whip. \nThe ball is made of plastic. Before, it was made of wood. The ball is about 3\u00bc inches (8.3 centimetres) in diameter and weighs about four ounces (113.4 grams).\nPolo saddles are English-style, similar to jumping saddles.\nPolo mallets are used to hit the ball. Their shape is similar to normal mallets, but they are much longer. The shaft of the mallet is usually made of bamboo and the head is usually made of wood. Players hit the ball with the side of the mallet rather than the front.\nOther forms of polo.\nPolo is not always played on ponies. Canoe polo, cycle polo, camel polo, elephant polo, golf cart polo, Segway polo, BMX polo, yak polo and water polo also exist. However most of these forms are not played at a professional level."}

For Windows 98 and Windows Me, only an older version was available. There was also an iPhoto plugin or program for uploading photos available for Mac OS X 10.4 and later.\nOn February 12, 2016, Google announced it was \"Moving on from Picasa\" and the Picasa desktop application would be discontinued on March 15, 2016.

On March 7, 2007, it was upgraded to 1GB.\nUsers with accounts at Google could store and share 1GB of photos for free. Users were able to purchase more storage space with these plans:\nUsers could upload pictures and videos by using either a web interface, through Picasa 2.5.0 or later on Microsoft Windows, using the Exporter for iPhoto, the Aperture to Picasa Web Albums plug-in, or Uploader on Mac OS X, or F-Spot on Linux.\nNo ads were shown on Picasa Web Albums in either the free or paid accounts. The Terms of Service allowed Google to use the uploaded photos and videos to display on the website or via RSS feeds, and also for promoting Google services without needing to pay the users.\nOn February 12, 2016, Google announced they would retire Picasa Web Albums (also called Picasaweb) so they could focus entirely on a single photo service called Google Photos. The retirement of Picasa Web Albums was effective on August 1, 2016.

In German, 'hell' means 'light' and in Norwegian it means 'luck', while in English it means hell.\nFalse cognates.\nSometimes, two words look alike and it appears that they are cognates but they are not because they are not derived from the same root.\nExample one: In the English language, the word 'light' (something that makes things visible) is not a cognate of the word 'light' (not heavy) because they are not derived from the same root.\nExample two: The German word 'haben' and the English word \" mean the same thing and they appear to be cognates but they are not simply because they are not derived from the same root.\nExample three: The Japanese word 'okiru' \u8d77\u304d\u308b and the English word 'occur' have the same thing happening as example two."}

Two people were injured and one was killed in attacks by an unidentified extremist group who attacked the bazaar shooting and killing the watchman of the Seven Stars music centre.\nIn August 2007 the people of Bakhshali observed a strike against power cuts. They blocked the main Mardan to Bakshali road in protest. The protectors said that the power cuts were harming business and their children's studies. The village has also been affected by violence between the Taliban and the government; on 24 January 2008 the militants attacked the vehicle of former Health minister Syed Kamal Shah injuring his guard. The rebels have also been pressuring local people to stop listening to music as well launching bomb attacks in the area.\nOn 15 August a meeting of elders in Mardan decided to set up anti-Taliban group similar to one that has been stated in neighbouring Buner District. According to Shakoor Khan, an elder from Bakhshali who attended the meeting, \"Before the Taliban resorts to torching more schools, we have decided to resist them\"."}

Birch bark also contains substances that are used in medicines and chemicals.\nUses.\nBirch bark was valuable throughout the world where birch trees were available:\nBirch bark is can also be used as a tinder. It is very good tinder as the inner layers will stay dry even through heavy rainstorms. To make birch bark useless as tinder, it must be soaked in water for a very long time."}

It gives small amounts of the chemical nicotine without the tobacco or other chemicals from real cigarettes. The main substances making up in the liquid in the e-cigarettes are nicotine, propylene glycol, glycerin and some flavors or smells.\nFunction.\nAn E-cigarette is made of 3 parts:\nThe e-liquid (propylene glycol and/or glycerin) is heated to make a vapour which looks like the smoke from real cigarettes. This caries the nicotine to the lungs where it is absorbed.\nAs of 2015, 3 generations of \"electonic cigarettes\" are known:\nHistory.\nThe modern electronic cigarette was invented by Hon Lik (regarded as the 'father of the electronic cigarette'), a Chinese pharmacist and inventor. Hon had himself quit smoking, after his father, also a heavy smoker, had died of lung cancer. Hon patented the modern e-cigarette design in 2003, and starting selling it domestically. Many versions made their way to the U.S., sold mostly over the Internet by small marketing firms.\nHowever, many US and Chinese e-cig manufacturers copied his designs illegally, and as a result Hon Lik did not get the expected financial rewards for his invention (although some US manufacturers have recompensated him through out of court settlements).\nIn 2008, this attracted the attention of the World Health Organization (\"WHO\") who said that these e-cigarettes were not proper nicotine replacement therapy and that this mis-information had to be taken away from any sites or advertisements saying that they were.\nStarting 2012 Tobacco companies also want a piece of E-Cigarette-cake and work on their own products. Marlboro goes for heating tobacco, Philip Morris tests a fizz-like method while British American Tobacco tries a medical-like inhaler. Many big tobacco companies didn't do their own research or stopped at some point. Instead they bought smaller e-cig companies to enter the market.\nE-Liquid.\nThese devices have a battery powered heating element and tank that contains a liquid solution made by combining nicotine, vegetable glycol or propylene glycol and flavorings. The gadget that can be bought in a variety of shapes and sizes usually resembles a pen or a regular cigarette, and it works like a vaporizer. The liquid used in e-cigs is commonly made of propylene glycol, glycerin, distilled water, artificial (fake) flavors and optionally nicotine. It often tastes like tobacco, fruit, mint/menthol or sweets.\nIn 2017, the TRPR (Tobacco and Related Products Regulations), which was a revised interpretation of the EU Commission's TPD (Tobacco Products Directive), came into effect in the UK. This piece of legislation aimed to ensure the safety of vape products include vape kits and included the limitations of nicotine-containing e-liquid bottles to 10ml, vape tank sizes to 2ml as well as nicotine strength of e-liquid to a maximum of 20mg. Current UK laws state the sale of e-cigarettes and e-liquids is legal to over 18s only, but many shops allow minors over the age of 12 to purchase nicotine-free e-liquid as all the ingredients in it are safe compared to nicotine e-liquid. Technically it is illegal for a minor to purchase any vaping products or any items associated with e-cigarettes but it is perfectly legal for a minor to use an e-cigarette, nicotine or nicotine-free. These are UK laws only.\nLegal History.\nMany countries are not approving electronic cigarettes as a less harmful alternative to traditional cigarettes. \nThe sale of tobacco cigarettes with flavor (except menthol) has been stopped in some countries but not yet in Europe or the USA. \nThe EU is testing if the product is bad to the health and safety of persons in general. They are also researching if electronic cigarettes can be called a medical product. In 2009 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was provided authority by Congress to ban all sales of cigarettes with flavors, except menthol.\nBecause many countries are not sure if electronic cigarettes are a medical product, each country has their own opinion and rules on e-cigarettes.\nHealth institutions are more and more interested in E-cigarettes because they are much cheaper than smoking regular ones, making them popular alternative. In the United States of America, individual states have different rules on use and sale of electronic cigarettes.\nApart from medical reasons e-cigarettes have also been banned in airport and other high population-density public places due to a number of incidents where they have been a cause of fire.\nThe United Kingdom are one of few countries to have government support for electronic cigarettes and e-liquids. Specifically, the NHS recommend e-cigarettes as a less harmful alternative to smoking"}

It stands 18.4 km from Cairo, Egypt. It is the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only one to remain mostly intact. When it was built it was 146.5 metres (481 feet) tall. It was the tallest building in the world for over 3,800 years. Erosion and other causes have shrunk it to 138.8 metres. The pyramid was probably built for Khufu, an Egyptian pharaoh. It was perhaps built by Khufu's vizier, Hemiunu. It is believed that it took about 20 years to build, and was completed around 10,000 BC.\nWhen it was built, the Great Pyramid was covered by white stones that formed a smooth outer surface. Some of these stones can still be seen around the base. Most of what can be seen of the pyramid now is its basic core 2,300,000 blocks of limestone and granite. There have been many different theories to explain how the pyramid was built. Most accepted building ideas are based on the idea of moving huge stones from a quarry and dragging and lifting them into place. Archaeologists found that the Pyramids of Giza were not built by slaves, but workers who were paid for working. Their graves were found near the pyramid in 1990.\nThere are three known rooms, or chambers, inside the Great Pyramid. The lowest chamber is cut into the rock on which the pyramid was built. This chamber was not finished. The other two chambers are higher up inside the pyramid. They are called the Queen's Chamber and the King's Chamber, but these are modern labels as we do not know how the Egyptians were going to use them. The Great Pyramid has two passages, one leading up, and the other down. It is the only Egyptian pyramid to have the two passages.\nThe Great Pyramid is part of a group of buildings, called the Giza Necropolis. This includes two mortuary temples in honour of Khufu. One is close to the pyramid and one near the Nile. There are three smaller pyramids for Khufu's wives. Other buildings include an even smaller \"satellite\" pyramid, and a raised causeway which joins the two temples. There are other tombs, called mastaba, probably for other important people."}

It has been broadcast four times a day on BBC Radio 4 since the 1920s.\nThe Met Office, the UK meteorological centre, produces it for the Maritime Coastguard Agency. The forecast talks about lots of places, starting with \"Viking\" in the northeast and going clockwise around the British coastline until it reaches \"Southeast Iceland\" in the northwest. Sometimes the names are changed to keep them the same as in other countries. It is one of the first items on Radio 4 each day, and has been referenced in many poems and songs, including a poem by Seamus Heaney and a song by the British band, Blur (\"This is a Low\").\nProtocol.\nThere is a strict set of rules (a protocol) on how the forecast is written, and it has a limit of 370 words. It is always said in the same way and is around 9 minutes long. The language of the forecast is hard to understand unless the listener understands how the rules work. For example: People listening to the forecast who know the protocol can understand it as \"In the English Channel, there are strong winds, followed by a stronger wind in less than twelve hours time with some light rain, but good visibility\". The numbers refer to the Beaufort Scale of wind strength. \"Imminent\" means within 6 hours, \"soon\" between 6 and 12, and \"later\" meaning after 12 hours. There are lots of other jargon used in the Shipping Forecast.\n\"Sailing By\".\nAn instrumental piece of music, \"Sailing By\", is played before the 00:45 broadcast of the Shipping Forecast. It acts as a between the news bulletin and the Shipping Forecast, in order to make the Shipping Forecast play at exactly the same time each day. This gives the Radio 4 controllers if the programming of Radio 4 is running late. There was an when it was temporarily taken off air for two years in 1993. \"Sailing By\" was written by Ronald Binge, in 1962 a light music composer.\nMethods.\nThe Shipping Forecast is broadcast in many different ways, most famously, on the radio. BBC Radio 4, the radio station that the Forecast is broadcast from three times a day, can be listened to as far away as Denmark, or can be listened to anywhere in the world via the BBC's website. \nNavtex.\nAn updated Shipping Forecast is broadcast six times a day from three Navtex transmitters placed strategically around the coast of the United Kingdom, giving information on the areas near to the transmitter. The three transmitters are called Cullercoats, Niton and Portpatrick, after the places they are at. Navtex is a type of radio communication that sends a message to a receiver that picks it up and changes it into text, like to a mobiles' text message. The Navtex messages can be received up to 270 miles offshore. Navtex is an acronym for NAVigational TEXt messages. Major areas of general Navtex coverage include the Mediterranean Sea, the North Sea, Japan and the coasts of North America. Navtex is one of the more common ways of receiving the Shipping Forecast when off-shore.\nCoastguard.\nThe Maritime Coastguard Agency sends messages every three hours from their sixteen stations that are located by the coast. They also send important navigational notices and a forecast that is for the area. The \"Maritime Safety Information\" broadcast includes a part of the Shipping Forecast, specific for the area in question.\nOther forecasts.\nThere are several related forecasts that are similar to the Shipping Forecast. The High Seas Forecast is similar to the Shipping Forecast in format and protocol, but is about the North Atlantic ocean, or 'Met Area 1'. It can be seen on Radio 4's website. It is also split into lots of areas, and some of them have the same name as in the Shipping Forecast.\nOther websites.\nRead the Shipping Forecast] \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/coast_and_sea/shipping_forecast"}

Over six million people read it every week. It was first published in 1982 by Lord Northcliffe. It sells the second biggest amount of Sunday newspapers in Britain after\"The News of the World\". The Daily Mail was launched nearly a century before(1896) and is The Mail on Sunday's \"sister paper\".\nThey are both owned by Associated Newspapers, but the editorial staff are completely separate.\nHistory.\n\"The Mail on Sunday\" was first launched on 2 May 1982, to go with the \"Daily Mail\". The first story ever printed on the front page was the \"RAF's bombing of Port Stanley airport in the Falklands\". The Daily Mail and General Trust(DMGT)came up with some tough targets for the paper to reach. Initially DMGT wanted to sell 1.25 million copies a week. But the launch of The Mail on Sunday was not a success. After six weeks, sales were only around 700,000 copies.\nLord Rothermere then brought in the \"Daily Mail\"'s editor David English (later Sir David). He helped redesign and re-launch The Mail on Sunday. In the first three and a half months, Sir David managed to stop the fall in sales. The circulation then increased to 840,000. Three new sections were introduced:\nToday (2008)the circulation is around 2.3 million, an increase of more than 1.5 million.\nThe newspaper's reputation developed thanks to Stewart Steven. Its circulation grew from around 1 million to almost 2 million during his time in charge. The editor who followed him was Jonathan Holborow and the current editor is Peter Wright."}

The show has been held every year since 1975 and is voted on by regular people. The People's Choice Awards air on CBS and are produced by Procter &amp; Gamble and Mark Burnett. Global promotion is handled by Kroszover Entertainment.\nThe award show's creator, Bob Stivers, made the first show in 1975. The first awards recognized \"The Sting\" as 1974's Favorite Picture, Barbra Streisand as the year's Favorite Film Actress, and John Wayne as its Favorite Film Actor. Ratings for the show peaked in 1977, when the 3rd People's Choice Awards attracted 35.3 million viewers who saw Farrah Fawcett-Majors win for Favorite Female TV Star, \"\" win as the Favorite Picture, and Streisand and Wayne win again in the Film Actress and Actor categories.\nProcter &amp; Gamble, the show's first and only sponsor, bought the show from Stivers in 1982.\nIn 2008, the \"People's Choice Awards\" introduced a new category: Favorite Sci-Fi Show. The nominees were \"Stargate Atlantis\", \"Battlestar Galactica\", and \"Doctor Who\". The winner was \"Stargate Atlantis.\" \nCategories.\nThe award categories have changed over the years. For example, the 16th People's Choice Awards had categories including Favorite All-Around Movie (\"Batman\"), and both a Favorite Movie Actor (Tom Cruise) and a World Favorite Movie Actor (Dustin Hoffman). At the 23rd People's Choice Awards, Rob Reiner was named the People's Choice Awards Honoree. More recently, the 32nd People's Choice Awards (shown in January 2006) included categories such as Favorite On-Screen Match-Up (Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson in \"Wedding Crashers\"), Favorite Leading Lady (Reese Witherspoon), Favorite Tour (U2), and an award named after a Procter &amp; Gamble brand: Nice 'n Easy Fans Favorite Hair (Faith Hill).\nPoll-based awards.\nIn the 20th century, the awards were based on results from Gallup polls. Each year, Gallup took a survey of different categories for favorite actor, actress, movie, artist, television show or group. There was no limit on who or what could be chosen. The public could choose whomever or whatever it liked. The results of the annual survey were announced in the form of the \"People's Choice Awards\".\nSince polls have margins of error, many years' awards have had ties in at least one category, when Gallup declared that the voting was so close that a single winner could not be chosen. For example, in 2003, both \"Spider-Man\" and \"\" were recognized as Favorite Motion Picture.\nSwitch to online voting.\nThe winners of the 31st People's Choice Awards (shown January 9, 2005) were decided by online voting rather than Gallup polls. The nominees submitted for Internet voting were picked using an unpublished process involving editors at \"Entertainment Weekly\", the show's production team, and a group of pop culture fans.\nThe nominees for the 32nd People's Choice Awards were picked by web research company Knowledge Networks, which took what it described as a nationally representative sample of men and women ages 18 to 54, with and without Internet access, to come up with the nominees after being presented with a list of candidates determined by national ratings averages, box office grosses and album sales, and they had the option to write in their favorites. Knowledge Networks picks these people by calling them and gives a Web TV and Internet access to people without Internet access so they can see what other people think.\nThe nominees for the 2010 People's Choice Awards were determined by media research company Visible Measures, which specializes in measuring Internet Video audience behavior. They used a program called True Reach to find out people's reactions to online videos.\nKids' Choice Awards.\nIn 1988, Nickelodeon created the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards, a children's version of the People's Choice Awards. Though they have similar names, the two shows are owned by different companies. Also similar but unrelated is the Teen Choice Awards."}

{"id": "127607", "revid": "795348", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=127607", "title": "Polarization", "text": "Polarization (also polarisation) is a property of some types of waves. Some waves have motion in another direction as well as the direction of the wave. In water, for instance, the wave will move across the water, but the wave will also move water up and down on the surface. Light waves are similarly transverse waves though they are also particles. Sound waves do not have polarization, since they are longitudinal waves.\nLight.\nLight reflected by shiny transparent materials is partly or fully polarized, except when the light is perpendicular to the surface. Polarization was first discovered in 1808 by the mathematician . A polarizing filter, such as a pair of polarizing sunglasses, can be used to observe this effect by rotating the filter while looking through it at the reflection off of a distant horizontal surface. At certain rotation angles, the reflected light will be reduced or eliminated. Polarizing filters remove light polarized at 90\u00b0 to the filter's polarization axis. If two polarizers are placed atop one another at 90\u00b0 angles to one another, very little light can pass through both.\nPolarization by scattering is observed as light passes through the atmosphere. The scattered light produces the brightness and color in clear skies. This partial polarization of scattered light can be used to darken the sky in photographs, increasing the contrast. This effect is easiest to observe at sunset, on the horizon at a 90\u00b0 angle from the setting sun. Another easily observed effect is the drastic reduction in brightness of images of the sky and clouds reflected from horizontal surfaces. This is why polarizing filters are often used in sunglasses. Polarizing sunglasses also show rainbow-like patterns caused by color-dependent birefringent effects, for example in toughened glass (e.g., car windows) or items made from transparent plastics. The role played by polarization in the operation of liquid crystal displays (LCDs) is also frequently apparent to the wearer of polarizing sunglasses, which may reduce the contrast or even make the display unreadable.\nPolarization filter.\nPolarization of light is useful, after it has been filtered. A filter will separate light with one type of polarization from other types. Most daylight, or light from a light bulb, has a mix of polarizations (lasers are an exception). The filter works much like trying to put a playing card through a comb - only if the card is turned the right direction will it fit. Light that is turned a different way will be blocked by the filter. Liquid crystal displays (LCDs) use this to block light to make letters or numbers on a display. Glasses that have different polarization filters for each eye can separate light meant for the left eye and for the right eye. This is a common way to make 3D movies and 3D television.\nIn nature sometimes light that bounces off of a surface has the same polarization - this is called 'glare' from a window or water. A polarization filter on a camera will remove this glare to help see through the window or water (or can increase the glare, depending on how it is turned).\nThe photograph on the right was taken through polarizing sunglasses and through the rear window of a car. Light from the sky is reflected by the windshield of the other car at an angle, making it mostly horizontally polarized. The rear window is made of tempered glass. Stress from heat treatment of the glass alters the polarization of light passing through it, like a wave plate. Without this effect, the sunglasses would block the horizontally polarized light reflected from the other car's window. The stress in the rear window, however, changes some of the horizontally polarized light into vertically polarized light that can pass through the glasses. As a result, the regular pattern of the heat treatment becomes visible.\nElectromagnetic.\nOther electromagnetic waves also have polarization, but it can happen in different ways.\nGeneral polarization: Some waves can be described by having the electric field perpendicular to the direction of the wave, and these are called TE (transverse electric) waves. Others have the magnetic field perpendicular to the direction of the wave, and these are called TM (transverse magnetic) waves. These are the most general types of wave polarization. They can also be called vertical or horizontal polarized waves. If both the electric field and magnetic field are perpendicular to the direction of the wave, the wave is called TEM (transverse electromagnetic). Linear, circular, and elliptical polarizations are specific cases of TEM polarization.\nLinear, circular, and elliptical polarizations are three specific types of TEM polarization. They cannot be measured close to an antenna. Far away from an antenna the fields are TEM, so these can be used. They are easy to imagine if you look from at the wave straight on."}

He spent his childhood in Shimla and received his early education at the Bishop Cotton School in Shimla. He was born just six years after the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The rebellion was a war that had been fought by some Indians to end British rule. It had been defeated by the British but had created segregation, suspicion and fear between the British and the Indians. Although he had been born after the rebellion had ended, the effects had affected Dyer's life.\nDyer went to Midleton College, County Cork between 1875 and 1881. In 1885 after his time at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst he joined the Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey) as a Lieutenant, and served in riot control duties in Belfast (1886) and the Third Burmese War (1886\u201387). He then joined the British Indian Army. First joining the Bengal Staff Corps as a Lieutenant in 1887 and being part of the 39th Bengal Infantry, and then joining the 29th Punjabis.\nDuring his time with the 29th Punjabis he fought in the Black Mountain campaign of 1888, the relief (battle) of Chitral in 1895. And was promoted to Captain in 1896. In 1901 he became Deputy Assistant Adjutant General. and then fought in the Mahsud blockade between 1901 and 1902.\nDyer then joined the 25th Punjabis where he served in the Zakha Khel Expedition (1908). He was in charge of the 25th Punjabis in India and Hong Kong and was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel in 1910.\nDuring World War I (1914\u201318), he was in charge of the Seistan Force. and made a Companion of the Bath (CB). He was promoted Colonel in 1915, and was made a temporary Brigadier-General in 1916.\nIn 1919, about a month after the Amritsar killings, in the Third Anglo-Afghan War, his Brigade relieved the garrison of Thal. He retired on 17 July 1920, having become a Colonel.\nBackground.\nIn 1919 the British population of Punjab feared a plot by the Indians to overthrow British rule. There was talk of mutiny and of death threats to Europeans. Sir Michael O'Dwyer, the Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab, decided to deport Indians from Punjab who were leading protests against the British.\nOne person who was targeted was Dr. Satyapal, who was in the Army Medical Services during World War I. He was in favour of non-violent civil disobedience and was stopped from speaking in public. Another person was Dr. Kitchlew, a Muslim barrister who wanted political change and was non-violent. The Deputy Commissioner, Miles Irving, did not know much about these two people. Both men were arrested because Irving suspected them of trying to rebel against the British.\nTheir arrest led to demonstrations by the people of Punjab. Crowds gathered in all public places demanding a release of the two men. Army troops panicked and opened fire on a bridge across a railway line, causing several deaths. This resulted in a mob which returned to the city centre. More army troops arrived to stop more demonstrations.\nThe mobs sought out Europeans in the city. On April 9 1919, Miss Marcella Sherwood, who worked at the Mission Day School for Girls was bicycling round the city to close her schools. She was attacked by the mob in a narrow street and was beaten and left wounded. She was rescued by local Indians who hid her from the mob and moved her to the fort. This attack on a lady angered Dyer, who was in command of troops in Jullundur.\nJallianwala Bagh Massacre.\nBrigadier Dyer is infamous for the orders which he gave on April 13 1919 in Amritsar. It was under his command that 90 troops, made up of 25 Gurkhas, 25 Pathans and Baluch, all armed with .303 Lee-Enfield rifles and the Gurkhas who were with \"khukris\" opened fire on a gathering of unarmed civilians, including women and children gathered at the Jallianwalla Bagh in what came to be later known as the Jallianwala Bagh massacre.\nThe civilians had arrived at Jallianwala Bagh to join the yearly Baisakhi celebrations which are both a religious as well as a cultural festival of the Punjabis. The Bagh had an area of 6\u20137 acres and had walls all around. The walls had ever small entrances which only a few people could go through.\nDyer ordered the troops to fire directly at the crowd of people; they kept shooting until they ran out of bullets (1650 rounds). The shooting lasted for about 10 minutes.\nDuring the ten minutes of shooting, Dyer kept checking how the troops were shooting. He ordered the soldiers to shoot where most of the people were. He did this not because the crowd was slow to leave, but because he wanted to \"punish them\" for being there.\nSome of the soldiers at first fired in the air instead of at the people. When they did this General Dyer shouted: \"Fire low. What have you been brought here for?.\"\nLater Dyer's himself was to admit that the crowd was not given any warning to leave. He said he did not feel sorry for ordering his troops to fire.\nInjured and dead.\nThe British army reported 379 dead say it over 1000 dead. According to a Home Political Deposit report, the number was over 1,000, with more than 1,200 wounded. Dr. Smith, a British civil surgeon at Amritsar, said there were over 1800 casualties. Because of the large numbers of people killed and injured, general Dyer became known as \"The Butcher of Amritsar\" in India.\nCrawling Order.\nBrigadier Dyer sent soldiers to the area where Miss Marcella Sherwood was beaten. He ordered that any Indians wishing to travel through the street (150 yards) had to crawl on all fours. This order also included the people who had rescued her.\nBecause of this order the street was closed, the houses had no back doors and the people could not go out without climbing down from their roofs. No doctor or supplier was allowed in, resulting in the sick being untended. The order was enforced by a flogging booth set up in the middle of the street.\nDeath.\nAfter the Amritsar massacre, Dyer's health failed and in 1921 he suffered paralysis. He never recovered. He died at Long Ashton, near Bristol, on July 23 1927.\nThe Morning Post remembered him in articles titled, \"The Man Who Saved India\" and \"He did his Duty\". The Westminster Gazette wrote a contrary opinion, \"No British action, during the whole course of our history in India, has struck a severer blow to Indian faith in British justice than the massacre at Amritsar, and the attitude of official Anglo-India to it.\""}

{"id": "127777", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=127777", "title": "Didgeridoo", "text": "The \"didgeridoo\" (sometimes didjeridu) is an Australian Aboriginal wind musical instrument. They were used by the Yolgnu people of Arnhem Land. They can be quite long, anywhere from long. Most are around long. The longer the instrument, the lower the pitch or key of the instrument. They are a hollow wooden tube, which can be either cylindrical or conical in shape. It is best described as being a wooden trumpet or drone. Musicologists say it is a brass aerophone.\nIt is difficult to know when didgeridoos were first used. Studies of rock art in Arnhem Land show that it has been in use for more than 1,500 years. A rock painting in Ginga Wardelirrhmeng, on the northern edge of the Arnhem Land plateau, dates from the freshwater period. It shows a didgeridoo player and two singers playing in a ceremony.\nThe word.\n\"Didgeridoo\" is said to be a word invented in the West, not an Aboriginal word. It may come from the Irish words \"d\u00fadaire\" or \"d\u00faidire\". This means 'trumpeter; constant smoker, puffer; long-necked person, eavesdropper; hummer, crooner' and \"dubh\", meaning \"black\" (or \"duth\", meaning \"native\"). However, this theory is not widely accepted.\nThe earliest examples of the word in print was in a 1919 issue of Smith's Weekly where it was called an \"\"infernal didjerry\" which \"produced but one sound - (which sounded like) didjerry, didjerry, didjerry and so on\"\". It was also used the 1919 \"Australian National Dictionary\", \"The Bulletin\" in 1924 and the writings of Herbert Basedow in 1926. There are more than 45 names for this instrument among the Aboriginal people of northern Australia including \"Yirdaki\". \"Yirdaki\", also sometimes spelt \"yidaki\", is for the instrument made and used by the Yolngu people of north-east Arnhem Land.\nMaking a didgeridoo.\nAboriginal didgeridoos are made in the traditional communities in Northern Australia or by makers who travel to Central and Northern Australia to get the materials. They are usually made from hardwoods, usually eucalyptus species that are native to the area. Sometimes a native bamboo, such as \"Bambusa arnhemica\", or pandanus is used. The main trunk of the tree is used, though a big branch may be used instead. Aboriginal makers spend a lot of time looking for a tree that has been hollowed out by termites. If the hollow is too big or too small, it will make a poor quality instrument.\nWhen a tree is found and cut down, the part of trunk or branch that will be made into a didgeridoo is cut out. The bark is taken off, the ends are trimmed, and there is some shaping of the outside. It may be painted or left natural. A rim of beeswax may be put on to the mouthpiece end. Traditional instruments made by Aboriginals in Arnhem Land are sometimes fitted with a 'sugarbag' mouthpiece. This is black beeswax from wild bees and has a its own special smell.\nDidgeridoos can also be made from PVC pipes, non-native hard woods (which are split, hollowed and rejoined), fiberglass, metal, agave, clay, hemp (a bioplastic named zelfo), and even carbon fiber. These didgeridoos usually have an upper inside diameter of around 1.25\" down to a bell end of anywhere between two to eight inches and have a length made to the needed key. The mouthpiece can be made of beeswax, hardwood or simply sanded and sized by the craftsman. In PVC, rubber stopper with a hole cut into it can be used.\nModern didgeridoo designs are different from the traditional Australian Aboriginal didgeridoo. They are recognized as being a separate instrument. Didgeridoo design changes started in the late 20th century using new materials and different shapes.\nPlaying.\nA didgeridoo is usually played sitting down because they are so long. It is played with continuously vibrating lips to make the drone while using a special way of breathing called circular breathing. This means a player breathes in through the nose at the same time as pushing air out of the mouth. A skilled player can refill the air in their lungs. With practice, the player can keep a note playing for as long as desired. There are recordings of modern didgeridoo players playing without stopping for more than 40\u00a0minutes; Mark Atkins on \"Didgeridoo Concerto\" (1994) plays for over 50\u00a0minutes continuously.\nThe rhythm of the circular breathing, gives the instrument its readily recognizable sound. Other changes in the didgeridoo's sound can be made by adding vocal sounds to the drone. Most of the sounds are related to the sounds of Australian animals, such as the dingo or the kookaburra. To make these sounds, the players simply have to use their voice to make the sounds of the animals whilst continuing to blow air through the instrument. The results range from very high-pitched sounds to very low sounds. Adding vocal sounds increases the complexity of the playing.\nAnthony Baines wrote that the didgeridoo is like \"...an aural kaleidoscope of timbres\". He also said that the virtuoso skills used by the best performers were unlike those needed on any other instrument.\nUse of the didgeridoo.\nThe didgeridoo was mainly played for ceremonial dancing and singing. It was also common for didgeridoos to be played for entertainment outside of ceremonial life. In northern Australia, the didgeridoo is still a very important as it plays for singers and dancers in surviving cultural ceremonies. Today, most didgeridoo playing is for entertainment in both Indigenous Australian communities and elsewhere around the world.\nPair sticks, sometimes called \"clapsticks\" or \"bilma\", set the beat for the songs during ceremonies. The rhythm of the didgeridoo and the beat of the clapsticks use patterns that have been handed down for many generations. Traditionally, only men play the didgeridoo and sing during ceremonies, but both men and women may dance. There were female didgeridoo players, but they did not play in ceremonies and it was not encouraged. Linda Barwick, an ethnomusicologist, says that traditionally women have not played the didgeridoo in ceremony, but in informal situations there is no prohibition in the Dreaming Law. On September 3, 2008, the publisher Harper Collins issued a public apology for its book \"The Daring Book for Girls\", scheduled to be published in October, which openly encouraged girls to play the instrument.\nDidgeridoo in popular culture.\nThe didgeridoo is now often used as an instrument in the experimental and avant-garde music scene. Industrial music bands like Test Department- used sounds from this instrument in their performances, linking ecology to industry, influenced by ethnic music and culture.\nIt has also been an instrument used for the fusion of tribal rhythms with a black metal sound. A music project called Naakhum used the paganism of the Australian tribes and many others as an approach.\nSouvenir didgeridoos.\nMost didgeridoos made today are for souvenir purposes. It is common to find didgeridoos made of non-native timbers, decorated incorrectly by non-indigenous artists with colourful designs or copied dot patterns. These decorations do not use traditional dreamtime stories or designs. These didgeridoos also often vary widely in size and shape, many being thinner and straighter. As a result of the inadequate wood types, shapes and lengths, souvenir didgeridoos can rarely be used as musical instruments.\nDecoration of souvenir didgeridoos is often seen by Aboriginal communities as offensive, inappropriate, inadequate, inaccurate and in many cases, misleading. The copying of traditional artwork is also used to sell these didgeridoos to unsuspecting tourists.\nHealth benefits.\nA 2005 study in the British Medical Journal found that learning and playing the didgeridoo helped reduce snoring and sleep apnea. It does this by making muscles in the upper airway stronger, and this helps them stay open during sleep. This strengthening happens after the player has learned the circular breathing technique."}

Trench warfare made them more useful again, and the German army began using them in 1915. Flamethrowers were used during World War 2 as a bunker clearing device. Many Axis troops used pillboxes and other small fortifications in Northern France, Germany, and on Pacific Ocean islands. Small fire squads used these weapons to draw them out. Although flamethrowers project flames, burning was not the most common form of death associated with these weapons. Rather, smoke released as a byproduct of combustion presented soldiers with the grim ultimatum between death by smoke inhalation or leaving the trench and facing enemy gunfire.\nDue to advancements in ballistic technologies and modern warfare tactics, flamethrowers are much less common in modern theatres. Presently, these weapons have been converted for civilian use for clearing old crops, domestic defense and even landscaping. In 2018, the Boring Company headed by Elon Musk developed a civilian flamethrower in a limited production of 20,000 units. With the prominence of Musk in contemporary culture, these flamethrowers were sold quickly yielding 10 million dollars for the Boring Company in gross revenue."}

It is used to indicate the number of chromosome sets in a cell. Most eukaryotes have either one set (called haploid) or two sets (called diploid). Some other organisms are polyploid, they have more than two sets of chromosomes. Some amphibians are triploid, with three sets. The endosperm cells in the seeds of many plants are also triploid. Some kinds of trout or salmon have four sets (\"tetraploid\"). Other examples:\nSex cells (gametes) are almost always haploid. If the reproductive stage (adult) is polyploid, then the gametes will have half the ploidy number of chromosomes. \nThere are some variations of ploidy which are not discussed here. Some plant species with certain types of polyploidy do not use sexual reproduction, but survive with asexual methods.\nPolyploidy.\nPolyploidy occurs in cells and organisms when there are more than two paired (homologous) sets of chromosomes.\nMost organisms are normally diploid, meaning they have two sets of chromosomes \u2014 one set inherited from each parent. Polyploidy may occur due to abnormal cell division. It is most commonly found in plants, but it does sometimes happen in animals. Some estimates suggest that 30-80% of living plant species are polyploid, and many lineages show evidence of ancient polyploidy (paleopolyploidy) in their genomes. Huge increases in angiosperm (flowering plants) diversity have coincided with the timing of ancient genome duplications shared by many species. 15% of angiosperm and 31% of fern speciation events are accompanied by ploidy increase.\nPolyploid plants arise spontaneously in nature. Many polyploids are fitter than their parental species, and may display novel variation or morphologies that contribute to speciation and eco-niche exploitation. \nPolyploidy may occur in one generation, and is an exception to the principle that evolution occurs gradually. There may, however, be many genetic changes in the species after polyploidy has taken place. \nGametes.\nThe gametes of polyploids are unusual, because they may carry several sets of chromosomes. For example, common wheat is a polyploid with six sets of chromosomes, two sets coming originally from each of three different species. So there are six sets of chromosomes in most cells, and three sets of chromosomes in the gametes."}

These things do not need to be directly related to having sex. Rather, they are done to sexually arouse people, to make them want each other more, Examples of things that can be used in foreplay differ among people, Most people prefer simple things that make them feel nice such as a person talking softly, a compliment, a Hug, or by being Tickled by a person they like, or even sharing similar hobbies, such as white water rafting, rocky mountain climbing or even how flexible you both are at Yoga,\nNot all of these acts are physical, some can also be psychological. Common things done in foreplay include kissing, touching each other, hugging, and stimulating the others erogenous zones.\nForeplay has a well-defined function - it lowers inhibitions and makes people feel better at ease.\nForeplay has been mentioned in historic works. The Ancient Indian work \"Kama Sutra\" mentions different types of embracing, kissing, and marking with nails and teeth. It also mentions BDSM activities such as slapping and moaning as \"play.\"\nBased on age, religious and political background, what people do as foreplay can be quite different. Many people think that women demand more foreplay and require more time to become aroused. Recent scientific research has show that this is false, though. Scientists from McGill University Health Centre in Montreal, Canada used the method of thermal imaging to record baseline temperature change in the genital area as the definition of the time necessary for sexual arousal. Researchers studied the time required for an individual to reach the peak of sexual arousal and concluded that, on average, women and men spend almost the same time for sexual arousal \u2014 around 10 minutes."}

It comes in the introduction to a long poem called \"Milton: a Poem\" (1804). Today it is best known as the hymn Jerusalem, sung to music written by C. Hubert H. Parry in 1916, more than a century after Blake had written the poem. \nThe words of the poem.\n&lt;poem&gt;\nAnd did those feet in ancient time\nWalk upon England's mountains green?\nAnd was the holy Lamb of God\nOn England's pleasant pastures seen?\nAnd did the Countenance Divine\nShine forth upon our clouded hills?\nAnd was Jerusalem builded here\nAmong these dark satanic mills?\nBring me my bow of burning gold!\nBring me my arrows of desire!\nBring me my spear! O clouds, unfold!\nBring me my chariot of fire!\nI will not cease from mental fight,\nNor shall my sword sleep in my hand,\nTill we have built Jerusalem\nIn England's green and pleasant land. \n&lt;/poem&gt;\nWhat the poem is about.\nThere is a legend that the young Jesus went to England with his uncle, Joseph of Arimathea, to England and visited Glastonbury. The poem connects this legend to an idea in the Book of Revelation ( 3:12 and 21:2) describing a Second Coming in which Jesus builds a new Jerusalem. Some Christians thought that a new Jerusalem would be like Heaven, somewhere of love and peace. The poem asks if Jesus visited England and if Heaven was created in England. Blake lived in the time of the early Industrial Revolution when there was a lot of poverty and misery. Many people think the \u201cdark Satanic mills\u201d were the factories where many people worked in horrible conditions. This contrasts with the country with its beauty and clean air: \u201cEngland\u2019s green and pleasant Land\u201d. The second half of Blake's poem says people should try to establish \"Jerusalem\" once more.\nParry composes the music.\nBlake\u2019s poem was not very well known during the 19th century, but in 1916 a collection of poems was published which included \u201cJerusalem\u201d. Britain was fighting a terrible war (the First World War), and so the people needed some strong, patriotic music to give them courage. Robert Bridges, the Poet Laureate asked Parry to put it to music at a Fight for Right campaign meeting in London's Queen's Hall. He wanted Parry to write a tune that the audience would be able to sing easily. At first Parry wanted verse one to be sung by a solo female voice, but the version sung nowadays is the arrangement for orchestra made in 1922 by Sir Edward Elgar. When King George V heard it for the first time he said that he preferred \"Jerusalem\" to \"God Save the King\", the National Anthem. \nEngland (as distinct from Britain) does not have an official anthem and so the British National Anthem \"God Save the Queen\" is used for national occasions, for example before English international football matches or at the Last Night of the Proms. The song is also the unofficial anthem of the British Women's Institute. It is often sung as a hymn in churches, although people in some churches think it is not a hymn. It is also sung in many schools."}

His music influenced other English composers such as Elgar and Vaughan Williams. Parry wrote a great deal of music, but by far the best known piece he wrote is the song \"Jerusalem\". Another piece which is often sung is the anthem \"I was glad\" written for the coronation of Edward VII.\nHis early life.\nParry was born into a rich family. He went to school in Eton and got his music degree while he was still there. He then went to Oxford to study. He learned from the English-born composer Henry Hugo Pierson in Stuttgart, and with William Sterndale Bennett and the pianist Edward Dannreuther in London. He started to compose a lot of chamber music which was first performed at Dannreuther\u2019s house. He became famous in 1880 when Dannreuther played his piano concerto and his choral work \"Prometheus Unbound\" was performed at the Gloucester Festival. Other choirs started to ask him to write music for them. One of his best choral pieces was the ode \"Blest Pair of Sirens\" (1887). Other choral works include \"Ode on Saint Cecilia's Day\" (1889), the oratorios \"Judith\" (1888) and \"Job\" (1892). \u201cJudith\u201d includes a tune which became a well-loved hymn tune called \u201cRepton\u201d sung in churches to the words \u201cDear Lord and Father of Mankind\u201d.\nHis orchestral works from this period include four symphonies, a set of Symphonic Variations in E minor, the \"Overture to an Unwritten Tragedy\" (1893) and the \"Elegy for Brahms\" (1897). He also wrote for the Greek play 'The Birds' by Aristophanes.\nMid career.\nAs Parry became more famous he got many invitations to important jobs. He started teaching at the Royal College of Music in 1884 and became its director in 1894, a post he held until his death. In 1900 he succeeded John Stainer as professor of music at Oxford University. In 1908 his doctor advised him to resign from his Oxford job.\nLater years.\nDuring the last decade of his life he wrote some of his best works, including the \"Symphonic Fantasia '1912\"' (also called \"Symphony No. 5\"), the \"Ode on the Nativity\" (1912), \"Jerusalem\" (1916) and the \"Songs of Farewell\" which includes the song \u201cMy Soul, there is a Country\u201d. These were songs about the needless suffering in the war. He died of influenza in Rustington, Sussex.\nHis influence.\nParry had a lot of influence on English music in the 20th century. This was not just because of his music, but also through his teaching and his writings about music. The composers he liked best and who influenced his style were Bach and Brahms. His music is firmly tonal (always in clear major or minor keys), and Elgar and Vaughan Williams learned a lot from studying his music.\nParry was a man who always liked to help people, and so he took on a great deal of work, which did not do his health much good. When he had free time he enjoyed driving fast cars and sailing.\nHe was made a knight, and the first Baronet of Highnam in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom in 1902.\nThe house in Richmond Hill, Bournemouth where he was born is marked with a blue plaque.\nReferences.\nThe New Grove Dictionary of Music &amp; Musicians ed Stanley Sadie (1980) "}

It was founded in 1848 by Louis Brandt in La Chaux-de-Fonds (Switzerland). There are many famous people that promote Omega SA including Michael Schuhmacher, George Clooney, Cindy Crawford and Nicole Kidman.\nHistory.\nThe beginning of Omega was 1848 in La Chaux-de-Fonds. Louis Brandt opened a factory that produced watches. The watches made there carried the name Louis Brandt. After the death of Brandt, his sons transferred the production to Biel/Bienne (Switzerland). There, they started to produce their watches industrially. In 1898, \"Louis Brandt &amp; fr\u00e8res\" employed more than 500 workers.\nIn 1894 they changed their name to Omega, named after their first watch.\nIn 1904, the Brandt brothers died, and the company came into the hands of their children. In the following years, Omega became a highly prestigious watch manufacturer. In 1925, Omega started to work with Tissot, another watch manufacturer.\nToday Omega belongs to the Swatch Group.\nAdvertising.\nJames Bond.\nMany filmmakers have Omega watches in their movies. For example, Pierce Brosnan wore an Omega Seamaster Quartz Professional in \"James Bond\" movies starting with the movie \"Golden Eye\". In all later movies, Brosnan wore an Omega Seamaster Professional Chronometer.\nDaniel Craig also wears Omega in his \"James Bond\" movies. He even mentions the watch manufacturer by name in the movie.\nSports.\nAt the moment, Omega SA is the official timekeeper for the Olympic Games. Their first time was 1932 at Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. They were the timekeeper in the 2006 Winter Olympics, and in the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.\nAs a sponsor for the Emirates Team New Zealand, Omega introduced the Seamaster NZL-32 chronograph in 2007. The name is the same as the name of the boat that won the America's Cup in 1995."}

Globi is one of the most famous cartoon figures in the Swiss-German part of Switzerland. It was created in 1932 by the Globus department store chain for advertising. It is a blue human-like parrot with a black beret and trousers in black and red. It was so much liked by the children in Switzerland that it got published independently in 1944. There are a many Globi cartoon books and tapes in Switzerland today. Its appearance has changed several times since his development.\nHistory.\nGlobi was created in 1932 by the Globus stores as a media vehicle for children. They wanted to address Globi to children. First, the figure was named \"Kimbukku\". Because the people of the canton of Bale named the Globus warehouse \"Globi\", they thought would be a better name than Kimbukku. The figure was well liked by the young customers from the beginning. First \"Globi\" appeared as a comic strip in the magazine \"der Globi\". In 1935, the first book \"Globi the Childfriend\" appeared. This book has sold over a million copies. It was only really successful in Switzerland. Until today, 79 illustrated classic books have been published. The Globi books were always successful, but in the 1970s they were criticized because of the racism, sexism and violence in books of the 1940s and 1950s. Today, Globi is seen as politically correct. It started to be interested in ecology and animal protection and became more of a role model. For example, in a newer volume, Globi goes with the small rhino named Najma to Africa. The readers learn about the problems of life in the savanna of Africa for rhinos. There was also a movie with Globi in the cinemas in 2005.\nPublisher.\nBecause of the big success of Globi, the costs for the warehouse became too big. Because of this, Globi Publisher AG was founded in 1944. Since 1 January 2007, the Globi Publisher AG has been owned by Orell F\u00fcssli Publisher. The publisher is active in the Swiss market. In addition to books, they sell other Globi merchandise. These include dishes, cutlery, watches and alarm clocks, plush toys, drapery, lamps, card games and foods. There are also tourist attractions such as Globi hotel, a trail and a bus. In December 2008, a Globi winter park was built in Engelberg. In addition to Globi, other characters including Papa-Moll and Gl\u00f6beli exist. Yearly, over 80,000 Globi comic books, 40,000 educational Globi books, between 25,000 and 30,000 Papa-Moll books and 100,000 cassettes are sold.\nToday Globi Publisher employs 4 permanent employee, 2 exponents, 3-4 graphic artists and bookkeepers and about 10-12 illustrators and writers."}

The Apostles Creed and the Nicene Creed state that \"Christ will come again\". This coming is to judge the living and the dead. Throughout history, there have been different ideas about the details of this event. These disagreements are related to the Millennium which is described in the Book of Revelation as a 1000 year reign of Christ on the earth. Some Christians, called Amillennialists, think the 1,000 years refers only to the eventual triumph of the Gospel. Others, called Postmillennialists think that Jesus will return physically to earth. This will happen only after Christianity has been predominant for the 1,000 years. This may be a real 1,000 years or an indefinitely long time. In recent times, many Christians, especially in the United States, have believed that there will be a Rapture of the Christians. This means that at a certain time all Christians will go up to heaven to be with Jesus. After seven years of trouble on earth, Jesus will return with all the Christians to defeat the Antichrist and rule on earth for 1,000 literal years. Others who believe in the rapture put it at in the middle or at the end of the seven years. These different views come mainly from the Book of Revelation, but other Old Testament and New Testament books are also used to develop the different views. Since the Book of Revelation uses highly symbolic language, it can be understood in different ways. What virtually all Christians agree on is that in some way, Jesus will someday destroy all evil from the earth and bring goodness and peace."}

{"id": "127988", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=127988", "title": "Premature birth", "text": "Premature birth is when a baby is born before the normal end of pregnancy. In humans, a pregnancy normally lasts for about nine months. On average, a pregnancy lasts for 266 days.\nBabies who are born before 37 complete weeks of pregnancy (calculated from the last menstrual period) are said to be \"premature\". In the United States, about twelve percent of the babies are born prematurely (that is about one in every eight babies). In 2003, there were over 490,000 premature births. \nWorldwide rates of prematurity are more difficult to get. In developing countries, there is often no professional medical care for these babies. This makes it difficult to tell how far along the pregnancy really was. For this reason, the World Health Organization tracks rates of low birth weight instead. In 2000, 16.5 percent of babies born in developing countries were of low birth weight. It is estimated that one-third of these low birth weight deliveries are due to premature delivery.\nComplications.\nThe risk of having a problem (called a \"complication\") is higher in shorter pregnancies. Babies born prematurely die more often in their first year of life than others. Most such deaths occur in the first month of life, which is called \"neonatal mortality\". \nWorldwide, prematurity causes ten percent of neonatal mortality, or around 500,000 deaths per year. In the U.S., where many infections and other causes of neonatal death have been markedly reduced, prematurity is the leading cause of neonatal mortality at 25%. Prematurely born infants are also at greater risk of developing serious health problems, such as cerebral palsy, chronic lung disease, gastrointestinal problems, mental retardation, vision loss, or hearing loss. They are also more likely to have depression as teenagers.\nNearly half of all premature births have no known cause. When conditions permit, doctors may attempt to stop premature labor, so that the pregnancy can have a chance to continue to full term. This will increase the baby's chances of health and survival. \nIn the United States, the rate of preterm births has increased 30% in the past two decades.\nSpecial care for babies born early.\nIn developed countries, many hospitals have special facilities for prematurely born infants. This type of hospital unit is usually called a \"neonatal intensive care unit\" (NICU, pronounced \"NICK-you\"). In the NICU, premature babies are kept warm in incubators or other warming machines. They are enclosed in plastic with climate control equipment which keeps them warm and keeps germs away from them. \nModern neonatal intensive care involves sophisticated measurement of temperature, respiration, heart function, oxygen supply, and brain activity. Treatments may include fluids and nutrition given through intravenous catheters; oxygen, breathing support; and medications. \nIn developing countries, where advanced equipment may not be available or reliable, simple measures such as \"kangaroo care\" (skin-to-skin warming), encouraging breastfeeding, and basic infection control measures help reduce death rate and illness.\nChances of survival.\nThe earliest time in the pregnancy where the infant has at least a 50% chance of survival is called the \"limit of viability\". In countries with good health care, viability has been reduced to about 24 weeks. Rare survivors have been documented as early as 21 weeks, but this date is controversial because the pregnancy was measured from the date of conception rather than the date of her mother's last menstrual period. This makes gestation appear 2 weeks less than if calculated by the more common method. Risk of brain damage and developmental delay is significant at that early time. Even if the infant lives, there are ethical controversies over the care given to such infants. The limit of viability has also become a factor in the abortion debate."}

When they quit, they will get withdrawal symptoms. Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) is there to reduce the dependency symptoms. This is usually done by delivering nicotine (or a substance very similar to it) in other ways. Common methods include \"nicotine patches\" and chewing gums with nicotine in them.\nCigarettes are responsible for the deaths of about 5 million people each year. These people are not killed by the nicotine in the cigarette, but by other substances in tobacco smoke such as carbon monoxide and tars. \nNRT delivers nicotine to the smoker's brain in a much slower way than cigarettes do. It helps to damp down the urges to smoke that most smokers have in the early days and weeks after quitting, rather than remove them totally. It gives the smoker the chance to break smoking cues in their daily lives, and might provide a more comfortable exit from the smoking habit. NRT however is best used with some form of support, ideally from someone who knows something about smoking cessation.\nIn 2005 the Committee on the Safety of Medicines recommended that NRT be given to pregnant smokers and also to adolescent smokers. \nFindings from a recent Cochrane review of controlled trials testing NRT products (Stead et al. 2008) indicated that smokers using NRT were 1.5 to 2 times more likely to be abstinent from smoking at followup than those in the placebo or control treatment condition. \nCriticism.\nNicotine is the addictive drug in tobacco products, so there is a chance when using NRT products, to become addicted to those products in place of the tobacco habit. Generally it is argued that NRT products are safer then smoking tobacco. NRT products are generally expensive, sometimes even more so then cigarettes, so a minority of people may become addicted to the NRT product and turn back to tobacco products to save money.\nTypes.\nElectronic cigarette.\nAn electronic cigarette is an electronic item used instead of cigarettes. It gives a little nicotine, propylene glycol, and sometimes flavours, when you breathe through it. It was invented in China.\nThe electronic cigarette cannot be classed as an NRT as no recognized tests or studies have taken place. Furthermore WHO (World Health Organisation) has advised that any manufacturer or seller who is marketing the electronic cigarette as an NRT should halt unproven therapy claims. Currently most sellers who adhere to this guideline are marketing the device as a tobacco alternative."}

Usually it is expressed in a number of failures per time period, like failures per hour. It is often written as the Greek letter \u03bb (lambda) and is important in reliability theory. In practice, the closely related Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) is more commonly expressed and used for high quality components or systems.\nFailure rate is usually time dependent, and an intuitive corollary is that the rate changes over time versus the expected life cycle of a system. For example, as an automobile grows older, the failure rate in its fifth year of service may be many times greater than its failure rate during its first year of service\u2013one simply does not expect to replace an exhaust pipe, overhaul the brakes, or have major transmission problems in a new vehicle. \nMean Time Between Failures (MTBF) is closely related to failure rate. In the special case when the likelihood of failure remains constant with respect to time (for example, in some product like a brick or protected steel beam), and ignoring the time to recover from failure, failure rate is simply the inverse of the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF). MTBF is an important specification parameter in all aspects of high importance engineering design\u2013such as naval architecture, aerospace engineering, automotive design, etc.\u2013in short, any task where failure in a key part or of the whole of a system needs be minimized and severely curtailed, particularly where lives might be lost if such factors are not taken into account. These factors account for many safety and maintenance practices in engineering and industry practices and government regulations, such as how often certain inspections and overhauls are required on an aircraft.\nA similar ratio used in the transport industries, especially in railways and trucking is 'Mean Distance Between Failure', a variation which attempts to correlate actual loaded distances to similar reliability needs and practices.\nFailure rates are important factors in insurance, business, and regulation practices as well as fundamental to design of safe systems throughout a national or international economy."}

It broadcasts a wide variety of programming including news, sport, music, the arts, comedy, drama, history and lifestyle. It replaced the Scottish opt-out part of BBC Radio 4 in November 1978.\nHistory.\nBBC Radio Scotland was founded as a full-time radio network in 1978, although the name had been used since 1974 for the Scottish opt-out parts of BBC Radio 4. The creation of a separate network was made possible when Radio 4 became a fully national network and moved from medium wave to long wave.\nOpt-out stations were established in Inverness and Aberdeen in 1976, followed by Orkney and Shetland in 1977, and Selkirk and Dumfries in 1983. Previously planned opt-outs in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Dundee were never realised.\nProgrammes.\nThe station broadcasts a wide range of programming including news, debate, music and sport commentaries.\nNews and Current Affairs.\nNews and current affairs programming has always constituted the dominant part of BBC Radio Scotland's schedules, especially on weekdays. In addition to regular news bulletins (usually hourly), the station broadcasts a wide range of longer in-depth news and current affairs programmes.\nGood Morning Scotland (weekdays, 0600-0900) is Scotland's longest-running radio programme and one of the most popular in the country. It provides regular news, sport, business, travel and weather bulletins along with interviews and in-depth reports. It is similar to BBC Radio 4's \"Today\" programme, but from a Scottish perspective. It also includes the daily religious slot \"Thought for the Day\", again similar to that broadcast on Radio 4's \"Today\" programme.\nThe other daily news and current affairs strands are the \"Morning Extra\" phone-in (0905-1000), \"Scotland Live\" (1200-1245), \"Newsdrive\" (1600-1800) and the political news programme \"Scotland At Ten\" (2205-2230).\nWeekend programmes include \"Newsweek Scotland\" (Sat, 0800-0900), \"Shereen\" (Sun, 0900-1000) and \"The Business\" (Sun, 1000-1030).\nSport.\nLike Radio 5 Live, BBC Radio Scotland covers most of the major sporting events in Scotland. It holds exclusive rights to the Scottish Premier League and operates its Sportsound programme on a multitude of frequencies on Saturdays when games are being played. Other sporting events that can be heard on Radio Scotland include both of Scotland's domestic football cup competitions, Scotland football internationals and European games affecting Scottish teams and the rugby union Six Nations championships. Alongside the live action sports programmes, Radio Scotland also produces popular sporting shows such as football fanzine Off the Ball, phone-in forum \"Your Call with Jim Traynor\" and the multi-sports programme \"Sports Weekly\", presented by former Scotland rugby player, John Beattie.\nLocal opt-outs.\nOrkney and Shetland each have a half hour daily news programme \u2014 \"Around Orkney\" (0730-0800) and \"Good Evening Shetland\" (1730-1800). During the winter months, this is supplemented for both areas by an hour long programme, broadcast Monday-Friday, between 1805-1900. Local bulletins are broadcast from Selkirk, Dumfries, Aberdeen and Inverness throughout the day.\nHeads of Radio, Scotland.\nControllers of BBC Radio Scotland hold the title \"Head of Radio, BBC Scotland\" on account of BBC Scotland's radio productions for other BBC networks."}

It was founded on 2 November 1903.\nHistory.\n20th century.\nThe \"Daily Mirror\" was launched on 2 November 1903 by Alfred Harmsworth (later Lord Northcliffe) as a newspaper for women, run by women. Hence the name: he said, \"I intend it to be really a mirror of feminine life as well on its grave as on its lighter sides...to be entertaining without being frivolous, and serious without being dull\", and also invited men to read it. It cost one penny.\nIt was not an immediate success. In 1904, he decided to turn it into a pictore newspaper, changing the masthead to \"The Daily Illustrated Mirror\" and made Hamilton Fyfe editor who then fired all the women journalists. This name ran from 26 January to 27 April 1904 (issues 72 to 150), then reverted to \"The Daily Mirror\". The first issue did not have advertisements on the front page as previously, but instead news text and engraved pictures (of a traitor and an actress), with the promise of photographs inside. Two days later, the price was dropped to one halfpenny and to the masthead was added: \"A paper for men and women\". This combination was more successful: by issue 92, the guaranteed circulation was 120,000 copies and by issue 269, it had grown to 200,000:\nHarmsworth sold the newspaper to his brother Harold Harmsworth (from 1914 Lord Rothermere) in 1913. In 1917, the price was increased to one penny. Circulation continued to grow: in 1919, some issues sold more than 1 million copies a day, making it the largest daily picture paper.\nBy the mid 1930s, the \"Mirror\" was struggling \u2013 it and the \"Mail\" were the main casualties of the early 1930s circulation war that saw the \"Daily Herald\" and the \"Daily Express\" establish circulations of more than two million, and Rothermere decided to sell his shares in it.\nIn the late 1930s the paper moved from being a conservative, middle-class newspaper into a left-wing paper for the working class. The \"Mirror\" was the first UK paper to adopt the look of the New York tabloids. By 1939, it was selling 1.4 million copies a day.\nIt was threatened with closure in World War II because Churchill thought a cartoon made fun of the navy. The cartoon showed a sailor clinging to a piece of wreckage. It attacked the waste of petrol, and other goods, that sailors were trying to bring across the Atlantic and avoid being killed by German submarines.\nThe \"Mirror\"'s mass working-class readership had made it the United Kingdom's best-selling daily tabloid newspaper. In 1960, it bought the \"Daily Herald\" (the popular daily of the labour movement) when it bought Odhams, in one of a series of takeovers which created the International Publishing Corporation (IPC). The \"Mirror\" management did not want the \"Herald\" competing with the \"Mirror\" for readers, and in 1964, relaunched it as a mid-market paper, now named the \"Sun\". When it failed to win readers, the \"Sun\" was sold to Rupert Murdoch \u2014 who immediately relaunched it as a more populist and sensationalist tabloid as a direct competitor to the \"Mirror\". In 1978, \"The Sun\" overtook the \"Mirror\" in circulation, and in 1984 the \"Mirror\" was sold to Robert Maxwell.\nAfter Maxwell's death in 1991, the \"Mirror\" went through a protracted crisis before merging with the regional newspaper group Trinity to form Trinity Mirror in 1999. In recent years, the paper's circulation has also been overtaken by that of the \"Daily Mail\".\nThe Daily and Sunday Mirror are now printed at Watford and Oldham by Trinity Mirror.\n21st century.\nIn 2002, the \"Mirror\" changed its masthead logo from red to black, because the term \"red top\" is a name for a sensationalist mass-market tabloid. Sometimes it was blue. On 6 April 2005, the red top came back.\nUnder then-editor Piers Morgan, it opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and ran many front pages critical of the war. It also gave financial support to the 15 February 2003 anti-war protest, paying for a large screen and providing thousands of placards.\nThe \"Mirror\"'s front page on 4 November 2004, after the re-election of George W. Bush as U.S. President, read \"How can 59,054,087 people be so DUMB?\". It gave a list of states and their average IQ, showing the Bush states all below average intelligence (except for Virginia), and all Kerry states at or above average intelligence. The source for this table was \"The Economist\", though it was a hoax. Richard Wallace became editor in 2004.\nEditors.\nSource: \"Tabloid Nation\" p.\u00a0248."}

This genus was made for the species \"\"Daboia Russelii\", also known as the \"Russell's Viper\". It was named after Patrick Russell (1726-1805). Patrick Russell was a Scottish\nherpetologist, who studied many Indian snakes. The name, Daboia, is a Hindi (the main language of India) word meaing \"that lies hid\"\". The Russell's Viper is not only one of the four most venomous snakes in India, but it also causes the most deaths out of all the venomous snakes. There is currently one subspecies found, not including the nominate subspecies.\nDescription.\nRussell's Vipers can grow up to the length of 166 centimeters (5.5\u00a0ft), but they are usually around the length of 120 centimeters (4\u00a0ft). The Russell's Viper is usually dark yellow or brown in color with many black spots.\nWhere they live.\nThe Russell's Viper is found in India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, China (Guangxi, Guangdong), Taiwan, Indonesia (Endeh, Flores, east Java, Komodo, Lomblen). But some say it is also found in Vietnam, Laos, and the Indonesian island of Sumatra.\nHabitat.\nThe Russell's Viper is found in open grassy and bushy areas, farmlands, coastal lowlands, plains and hills. \nBehavior.\nThe Russell's Viper is Terrestrial (lives on the ground) and is usually nocturnal, but in cool weathers it is diurnal. When threaten it raises its head and makes a hissing noise which is said to be louder than other snakes. Their bite may sometimes be a simple snap, or sometimes the jaws hang on to the enemy for a few seconds. Adults are said to be slow and sluggish but when disturbed they become aggressive. Since of its aggressiveness and venom many animals and people are scared of this snake. That is why another snake, Rough-scaled Sand Boa, mimics the color pattern of the Russell's Viper so it looks like the Russell's Viper, but it is actually harmless. Adult's venom glands hold around 21\u2013268\u00a0mg of venom, while young one's venom glands hold around 8\u201379\u00a0mg of venom.\nFeeding.\nThe Russell's Viper eats just about everything; it eats rodents like rats, mice, and squirrels, land crabs, lizards, shrews, scorpions and other arthropods. Young Russell's Vipers are said to be cannibals, meaning they eat each other.\nReproduction.\nThe Russell's Viper is viviparous, meaning they give live birth. They mate early in the year and a female is pregnant for around six months before giving birth to her young in May to November, but usually in June or July. A female gives birth to around 20-40 young at a time, and the young are around 215-260 millimeters long when they are born. A Russell's Viper becomes mature after around 2\u20133 years.\nSubspecies.\nNot including the nominate subspecies, the Indian Russell's Viper (\"D. r. russelii\"), there is only one subspecies, the Eastern Russell's Viper (\"D. r. siamensis\")."}

It works by oversampling a polynomial constructed from the data. The polynomial is evaluated at several points, and these values are sent or recorded. Sampling the polynomial more often than is necessary makes the polynomial over-determined. As long as it receives \"many\" of the points correctly, the receiver can recover the original polynomial even in the presence of a \"few\" bad points. \nReed-Solomon codes are used in many different kinds of commercial applications, for example in CDs, DVDs and Blu-ray Discs, in data transmission technologies such as DSL &amp; WiMAX, and broadcast systems such as DVB and ATSC.\nOverview.\nReed-Solomon codes are block codes. This means that a fixed block of input data is processed\ninto a fixed block of output data. In the case of the most commonly used R-S code (255, 223) \u2013 223 Reed-Solomon input symbols (each eight bits long) are encoded into 255 output symbols.\nThe Reed-Solomon code, like the convolutional code, is a transparent code. This means that if\nthe channel symbols have been inverted somewhere along the line, the decoders will still\noperate. The result will be the complement of the original data. However, the Reed-Solomon\ncode loses its transparency if virtual zero fill is used. For this reason it is mandatory that the\nsense of the data (i.e., true or complemented) be resolved before Reed-Solomon decoding.\nIn the case of the Voyager program R-S codes reach near optimal performance when concatenated with the (7, 1/2) convolutional (Viterbi) inner code. Since two check symbols are required for each error to be corrected, this results in a total of 32 check symbols and 223 information symbols per codeword.\nIn addition, the Reed-Solomon codewords can be interleaved on a symbol basis before being\nconvolutionally encoded. Since this separates the symbols in a codeword, it becomes less likely\nthat a burst from the Viterbi decoder disturbs more than one Reed-Solomon symbol in any one\ncodeword.\nBasic idea.\nThe key idea behind a Reed-Solomon code is that the data encoded is first visualized as a polynomial. The code relies on a theorem from algebra that states that any \"k\" distinct points \"uniquely\" determine a polynomial of degree at most \"k\"-1. \nThe sender determines a degree formula_1 polynomial, over a finite field, that represents the formula_2 data points. The polynomial is then \"encoded\" by its evaluation at various points, and these values are what is actually sent. During transmission, some of these values may become corrupted. Therefore, more than \"k\" points are actually sent. As long as enough values are received correctly, the receiver can deduce what the original polynomial was, and decode the original data.\nIn the same sense that one can correct a curve by interpolating past a gap, a Reed-Solomon code can bridge a series of errors in a block of data to recover the coefficients of the polynomial that drew the original curve.\nHistory.\nThe code was invented in 1960 by Irving S. Reed and Gustave Solomon, who were then members of MIT Lincoln Laboratory. Their seminal article was entitled \"Polynomial Codes over Certain Finite Fields.\" When it was written, digital technology was not advanced enough to implement the concept. The first application, in 1982, of RS codes in mass-produced products was the compact disc, where two interleaved RS codes are used. An efficient decoding algorithm for large-distance RS codes was developed by Elwyn Berlekamp and James Massey in 1969. Today RS codes are used in hard disk drive, DVD, telecommunication, and digital broadcast protocols."}
