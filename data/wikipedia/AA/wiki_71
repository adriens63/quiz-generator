He was the founder of one of the world's top fashion houses, the \"House of Dior\" (now \"Christian Dior\").\nCareer.\nDuring the German occupation of France in World War II, Christian Dior dressed the wives of Nazi officers and French collaborators. On 8 October 1946 he founded his own fashion house, backed by Marcel Boussac, the cotton-fabric magnate.\nThe New Look.\nFor his first collection, in early 1947, the phrase \"The New Look\" was coined by \"Harper's Bazaar\", the fashion monthly. Dior's designs were more voluptuous than the economy shapes of World War II, when fabric was rationed. \nDior was a master at creating shapes and silhouettes; he said \"I have designed flower women\". His look employed fabrics lined with percale (a closely woven plain-weave fabric), boned, bustier-style bodices, hip padding, wasp-waisted corsets and petticoats. This made his dresses flare out from the waist, giving his models a very curvaceous form. \nSome women protested, because his designs covered up their legs, which they did not during wartime. There was also criticism of Dior's designs, which used a lot of fabric. Opposition ceased as soon as wartime shortages ended. The New Look revolutionized women's dress and reestablished Paris as the center of the fashion world.\nA-line.\nThe term was first used by Dior as the label for his collection of spring 1955. The A-Line collection's feature item, then the \"most wanted silhouette in Paris\", was a \"fingertip-length flared jacket worn over a dress with a very full, pleated skirt\". Evening dresses at this time were always worn with petticoats.\nAlthough an A-shape, this silhouette was not identical to what is now understood to embody the A-line idea. That idea was given its definitive expression and popularized by Dior\u2019s successor, Yves Saint Laurent, with his \"Trapeze Line\" of spring 1958, which featured dresses flaring out dramatically from a fitted shoulder line. \nA-line clothes remained popular in the 1960s and 70s, disappeared from fashion almost completely by the early 1980s and were revived by the retro trend of the late 1990s. By that time, 'A-line' was used more loosely to describe any dress wider at the hips than at the bust or waist, as well as a number of flared skirt styles. 'True' A-line shapes on the pattern of Dior and Saint Laurent saw a revival in the early 2000s."}

It is in the north east corner of the territory and is about 500km from the territory capital Darwin. It has an area of 97,000 km\u00b2. This area includes Kakadu National Park. About 16,230 people live in Arnhem Land. It was named by Matthew Flinders after the Dutch ship \"Arnhem\", which explored the coast in 1623. \nGeography.\nArnhem Land goes from Port Roper on the Gulf of Carpentaria around the coast to the East Alligator River where it joins Kakadu National Park. The major towns are Jabiru on the Kakadu National Park border, Maningrida on the Liverpool River mouth, and Nhulunbuy (also known as Gove) in the far north east, on the Gove Peninsula. Gove is the site of large bauxite mine with an alumina refinery. Its administrative centre is the town of Nhulunbuy, the fourth largest town in the Northern Territory.\nThe climate of Arnhem Land is tropical monsoon with a wet and dry season. Temperatures do not vary much during the year. It can get as cold as 15 degrees Celsius during nights in the dry season (April to September). In the wet season (October to March) the days can be as hot as 33 degrees Celsius.\n \nThe people.\nArnhem Land became an Aboriginal Reserve in 1931. It is still one of the largest Aboriginal Reserves in Australia. It is best known for its remoteness, its art, and the strong continuing traditions of its people. North east Arnhem Land is home to the Yolngu people, one of the largest indigenous groups in Australia. They have been able to keep their traditional indigenous culture. The Malays and Macassans are believed to have had contact with the coastal Aboriginal groups and traded with them prior to European settlement of Australia.\nThe 2006 movie \"Ten Canoes\" shows life in Arnhem land with a story that uses old Aboriginal stories. It was co-directed by one of the cast members. The movie and also the movie about how it was made, \"The Balano and the Bark Canoes\", shows the great struggle the indigenous people have made to keep their culture alive. \nArt.\nThe Aboriginal town of Yirrkala, just outside Nhulunbuy, is famous throughout the world. This is because of its bark paintings, and its role in supporting the rights of Indigenous Australians. It is also the place where the Yidaki, or Didgeridoo, came from. The town of Gunbalanya, once called Oenpelli, in Western Arnhem Land is also famous for its bark painting. \nArnhem Land is famous for its Aboriginal rock art. Some of the best art can be found at Ubirr Rock, Injalak Hill, and in the Canon Hill area. Some of these show early visits by Europeans, sometimes in such detail that Martini-Henry rifles can be identified. Other paintings show axes, aircraft and ships. In one rock shelter, hundreds of kilometres from Darwin, there is a painting the wharf at Darwin. It shows buildings and boats, the Europeans with their hats and pipes. Some are shown without hands, which they have in their pockets. There is a painting, near the East Alligator River crossing, which shows a man with a gun and long pigtails down his back. This would be one of the Chinese workers brought to Darwin in the late 19th century. The people also make ritual sand sculptures which do not last.\nOne Yolngu stone arrangement, at Maccasans Beach near Yirrkala, shows the layout of the Macassan praus (ships) used for Trepang fishing. The Yolngu traded with the people of Makassar on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. This trading was happening 200 years before European settlement."}

Banks was President of the Royal Society 1778\u20131820; baronet 1781; Privy Counsellor 1797. His collections were given to the British Museum.\nBanks took part in Captain James Cook's first great voyage from 1768 to 1771. He inherited a large fortune, and was able to hire his own team to help collect, package and transport his finds. Banks discovered and collected \"Eucalyptus\", \"Acacia\", \"Mimosa\", and \"Banksia\". About 80 species of plants are named after Banks.\nEducation.\nBanks was educated at Harrow School, Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford.\nExploration.\nNewfoundland and Labrador.\nIn 1766 Banks was elected to the Royal Society, and in the same year he accompanied Phipps to Newfoundland and Labrador to study their natural history. He made his name by publishing the first Linnean descriptions of the plants and animals of Newfoundland and Labrador.\n\"Endeavour\" voyage.\nBanks was promptly appointed to a joint Royal Navy/Royal Society scientific expedition to the south Pacific Ocean on \"HMS Endeavour\", 1768\u20131771. This was the first of James Cook's voyages of discovery in that region. Banks joined the ship with a staff of eight: Daniel Solander and H.D. Sp\u00f6ring, naturalists; Alexander Buchan and Sydney Parkinson, artists; James Roberts and Peter Briscoe, tenants from Revesby; Thomas Richmond and George Dorlton (Dollin), negro servants. Only four of this party survived the voyage, Banks himself, Solander and the two Revesby men.\nThis voyage went first to Brazil, where Banks made the first scientific description of a now common garden plant, \"Bougainvillea\" (named after Cook's French counterpart, Louis Antoine de Bougainville), and to other parts of South America.\nThe voyage then went to Tahiti (where the transit of Venus was observed, the purpose of the mission), to New Zealand and to the east coast of Australia, where Cook mapped the coastline and made landfall at Botany Bay and at Endeavour River (near modern Cooktown) in Queensland, where they spent seven weeks ashore while the ship was repaired after damage on the Great Barrier Reef.\nWhile they were in Australia Banks, Solander and Sp\u00f6ring made the first collection of Australian plants, describing many that were new to science. Almost 800 specimens were illustrated by the artist Sydney Parkinson and appear in \"Banks' Florilegium\", finally published in 35 volumes between 1980 and 1990.\nBanks arrived back in England on 12 July 1771 and immediately became famous.\nBanks in popular culture.\nThere are many things in Australia named after Banks. These include the Division of Banks, a Federal Electoral Division for the Australian House of Representatives in the state of New South Wales. The species Banksia is named after him."}

Think of it as a skirt underneath a regular skirt. The purpose is possibly insulation, and certainly to make the skirt fly out in an attractive way. \nPetticoats which are starched, with ruffles, or made with stiff fabric, can support a wider skirt. The ultimate in this trend is the crinoline, which is a petticoat structure which includes hoops of whalebone. Crinolines are not worn today, but petticoats are sometimes worn with ballgowns.\nPetticoats in the 20th century.\nFor most of the first half of the 20th century, with a few exceptions, petticoats were out of fashion. Certainly \"multiple\" petticoats were not needed for the narrow skirts and dresses which were fashionable. Some evening gowns needed petticoats, but they were finished off by WWII wartime rationing and shortages.\nPetticoats were revived by Christian Dior in his full-skirted \"New Look\" of 1947. Tiered, ruffled, stiffened petticoats remained extremely popular during the 1950s, especially with teenage girls. Typically, at least three single petticoats were worn, until manufacturers began making double and triple layer petticoats. A narrow slip was usually worn under the petticoats, especially the crinoline type, because they tended to be 'scratchy'.\nDior continued this theme with his \"A-Line\" collection of Spring 1955, which featured the \"most wanted silhouette in Paris\". This was a \"fingertip-length flared jacket worn over a dress with a very full, pleated skirt\".

It is one of the most popular pieces of music for cello and orchestra.\nTchaikovsky never composed a cello concerto, but he did write this work, which is a tune with a set of variations. It is called \"Rococo\" because the music is based on the style that was popular in the late 18th century, the period during the Classical period known as Rococo, the time of composers such as Mozart. The main theme is an original theme by Tchaikovsky, not a theme that had been composed by someone else in the 18th century.\nTchaikovsky wrote this piece for Wilhelm Fitzenhagen to play. He was a German cellist who lived in Russia. Like Tchaikovsky, he was a professor at the Moscow Conservatory. Fitzenhagen gave the first performance of the work in Moscow on 30 November 1877. Nikolai Rubinstein was the conductor.\nFitzhagen makes changes to the piece.\nWhat happened to the work after that first performance is an interesting story. Tchaikovsky himself had not been at the first performance because he was in Switzerland trying to calm himself down after a very short, disastrous marriage. He wanted to prepare the work so that it could be published. He sent Fitzhagen a short score (this is similar to an arrangement for the piano). He asked Fitzhagen to make any necessary changes to the cello part. Meanwhile, Tchaikovsky got on with the job of orchestrating the music (showing exactly what is played by each instrument).\nHowever, Fitzhagen did not only make changes to the solo cello part. He made other changes as well. He left one of the variations out, and changed the order of some of the others. When the music was about to be published, Tchaikovsky saw what Fitzhagen had done. Tchaikovsky was very cross, but he decided to let the publishers print it like that anyway.\nWhen it was published there was nothing in the score which said that Fitzhagen had made lots of changes. It was not until about 70 years later that people realized that Tchaikovsky\u2019s original version had been different. Some cellists, such as Steven Isserlis, now choose to play Tchaikovsky\u2019s original version. However, most cellists still prefer to play Fitzhagen\u2019s version. It is hard to tell which one Tchaikovsky would have preferred. Maybe he let it be printed because he realized that Fitzhagen had improved it. We cannot tell. Musicians still argue about which version ought to be played.\nOrchestration.\nThe piece is written for an orchestra which is smaller than Tchaikovsky\u2019s usual Romantic orchestral. It is like the ones from the time of Mozart. There are just two of each woodwind instrument, two horns, and strings.\nStructure of the work.\nThe piece, which is about 20 minutes long, consists of a theme and seven variations (eight in Tchaikovsky's original version).\nThe work is occasionally played by other solo instruments. Maxim Rysanov plays it on the viola. He played it at the Last Night of the Proms in 2010."}

Although electrically neutral atoms from interstellar volume can pass through this bubble, almost all of the material in the heliosphere comes from the Sun itself. \nFor the first ten billion kilometres of its radius, the solar wind travels at over a million kilometres per hour. As it begins to drop out with the interstellar medium, it slows down before finally stopping altogether. The point where the solar wind slows down is the termination shock; the point where the interstellar medium and solar wind pressures balance is called the heliopause; the point where the interstellar medium, travelling in the opposite direction, slows down as it collides with the heliosphere is the bow shock. \nSolar wind.\nThe solar wind is made of particles, charged(ionized) atoms from the solar corona, and fields, in particular magnetic fields. As the Sun rotates once in about 27 days, the magnetic field transported by the solar wind gets wrapped into a spiral. Differences in the Sun's magnetic field are carried outward by the solar wind and can produce magnetic storms in the Earth's magnetosphere.\nIn March 2005, measurements by the Solar Wind Anisotropies (SWAN) instrument onboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) have shown that the heliosphere, the solar wind-filled volume which prevents the solar system from becoming embedded in the local (ambient) interstellar medium, is not axisymmetrical, but is distorted, very likely under the effect of the local galactic magnetic field."}

At first Stanford wanted to perform another work by Parry: \"The Glories of Our Blood and State\". However, the performance was going to be part of Queen Victoria\u2019s Golden Jubilee celebrations. The words of \"The Glories of Our Blood and State\" were about Death coming to kings and queens, so it was not thought to be appropriate, and so Stanford asked Parry to write a new work for the occasion. George Grove suggested Milton\u2019s \"Ode at a Solemn Music\" would be a good poem for Parry to set.\nThe first performance of \"Blest Pair of Sirens\" at St James\u2019s Hall took place on 17 May 1887. It is very well written for choir with music that excellently fits Milton\u2019s powerful words. The choir divides into eight parts. The words are about man\u2019s desire to join the heavenly music of the spheres.\n\"Blest Pair of Sirens\" was sung by the choirs of Westminster Abbey and the Chapel Royal at the Royal Wedding of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Kate Middleton on 29 April 2011.

Nippur was one of the most ancient of all the Sumerian cities. It was the special seat of the worship of the Sumerian god, \"Enlil\", ruler of the cosmos (universe), and subject to \"An\" alone.\nNippur was always part of a larger empire. Its control was crucial, as it gave overall 'kingship' to monarchs from other city-states. It was a sacred city, important because it had the famous shrine of \"Enlil\".\nLate in the 3rd millennium BC, Nippur was conquered and occupied by the Semitic rulers of Akkad, and their rulers, like Sargon, left gifts at this sanctuary. Another ruler, Naram-Suen, rebuilt the temple and the city walls; in the debris of this ancient site his remains were found. This Akkadian occupation was succeeded by an occupation during the third dynasty of Ur, and the constructions of Ur-Nammu, the great builder of temples, are on top of those of Naram.\nKassite and later history.\nUnder the succeeding Kassite dynasty, shortly after the middle of the 2nd millennium, Nippur was restored once more to its former splendour.\nAfter the middle of the 12th century BC follows a long period of neglect, but after with the conquest of Babylonia by the Assyrian Sargon II, at the close of the 8th century BC, the city revives. Under Ashurbanipal, about the middle of the 7th century BC, we find Ekur restored with a splendour greater than ever before, the ziggurat of that period being 58 by 39\u00a0m.\nAfter that Nippur appears to have gradually fallen into decay, until finally, in the Seleucid period, the ancient temple was turned into a fortress. Huge walls were built at the edges of the ancient terrace, and the courts of the temple were filled with houses and streets. This fortress was occupied and further built upon until the close of the Parthian period, about AD 250.\nUnder the rule of the Sassanids Nippur fell into decay, and the ancient sanctuary became only a little village of mud huts huddled about the ancient ziggurat. The city was the seat of a Christian diocese as late as the 8th century AD.\nArchaeology.\nNippur was situated on both sides of the Shatt-en-Nil canal, one of the earliest courses of the Euphrates. It lies between the present bed of that river and the Tigris, almost 160\u00a0km southeast of Baghdad. It is divided into two main parts by the dry bed of the old Shatt-en-Nil (Arakhat). The highest point of these ruins, a conical hill rising about 30\u00a0m above the level of the surrounding plain, northeast of the canal bed, is called by the Arabs \"Bint el-Amiror\" ('prince's daughter').\nNippur was first excavated, briefly, by Sir Austen Henry Layard in 1851.\nFull scale digging was begun by an expedition from the University of Pennsylvania. The work involved four seasons of excavation between 1889 and 1900. Nippur was also excavated for 19 seasons between 1948 and 1990."}

The immune mechanisms help an organism identify a pathogen, and neutralize its threat.\nThe immune system can detect and identify many different kinds of disease agents. Examples are viruses, bacteria and parasites. The immune system can detect a difference between the body's own healthy cells or tissues, and 'foreign' cells. Detecting an unhealthy intruder is complicated, because intruders can evolve and adapt so that the immune system will no longer detect them.\nOnce a foreign cell or protein is detected, the immune system creates antibodies to fight the intruders, and sends special cells ('phagocytes') to eat them up.\nInnate immune system.\nEven simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess enzyme systems that protect against viral infections. Other basic immune mechanisms appeared in ancient life forms and remain in their modern descendants, such as plants and insects. These mechanisms include antimicrobial peptides (called defensins), phagocytosis, and the complement system. These make up the innate immune system, which defends the host from infections in a non-specific way. The simplest innate system is the cell wall or barrier on the outside to stop intruders getting in. For example, skin stops most outside bacteria getting in.\nHuman Innate Immune System Response\nOur innate immune system responds very fast to anything foreign that enters our body. When something gets past our skin, like through a cut, our immune cells work to find the intruder and to alert each other of the foreign object. Small immune cells bring other cells from all over the body to the site where the foreign object was found. Other immune cells can send out messengers to cells nearby to have them help attack the foreign object. This process can make our skin look red and feel hot. A certain type of cell called a phagocyte eats anything foreign or dangerous that enters your body. This response is called non-specific because it responds the same way to anything foreign that enters your body from germs to a piece of dust.\nAdaptive immune system.\nVertebrates, including humans, have much more sophisticated defense mechanisms. The innate immune system is found in all metazoa, but the adaptive immune system is only found in vertebrates.\nThe adaptive immune response gives the vertebrate immune system the ability to \"recognize and remember specific pathogens\". The system mounts stronger attacks each time the pathogen is encountered. It is adaptive, because the body's immune system prepares itself for future challenges.\nThe typical vertebrate immune system consists of many types of proteins, cells, organs, and tissues that interact in a complex and ever-changing network. This acquired immunity creates a kind of \"immunological memory\".\nThe process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination. Primary response can take 2 days to 2 weeks to develop. After the body gains immunity towards a certain pathogen, if infection by that pathogen occurs again, the immune response is called the \"secondary response\".\nAutoimmune disorders.\nIn some organisms, the immune system has its own problems within itself, called \"disorders\". These result in other diseases, including autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases and possibly even cancer. Immunodeficiency diseases occur when the immune system is less active than normal. Immunodeficiency can either be the result of a genetic (inherited) disease, or an infection, such as the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), that is caused by the retrovirus HIV, or other causes.\nIn contrast, autoimmune diseases result from an immune system that attacks normal tissues as if they were foreign organisms. Common autoimmune diseases include Hashimoto's thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, Type 1 diabetes, and Lupus erythematosus.\nImmunology is the study of all aspects of the immune system. It is very important to health and diseases.\nHistory of immunology.\nImmunology is scientific part of medicine that studies the causes of immunity to disease. For many centuries people have noticed that those who recover from some infectious diseases do not get that illness a second time.\nIn the 18th century, Pierre Louis Maupertuis made experiments with scorpion venom and saw that certain dogs and mice were immune to this venom. This and other observations of acquired immunity led to Louis Pasteur (1822\u20131895) developing vaccination and the germ theory of disease. Pasteur's theory was in direct opposition to contemporary theories of disease, such as the miasma theory. It was not until the proofs Robert Koch (1843\u20131910) published in 1891 (for which he was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1905) that microorganisms were confirmed as the cause of infectious disease. Viruses were confirmed as human pathogens in 1901, when the yellow fever virus was discovered by Walter Reed (1851\u20131902).\nImmunology made a great advance towards the end of the 19th century, through rapid developments, in the study of humoral immunity and cellular immunity. Particularly important was the work of Paul Ehrlich (1854\u20131915), who proposed the side-chain theory to explain the specificity of the antigen-antibody reaction. The Nobel Prize for 1908 was jointly awarded to Ehrlich and the founder of cellular immunology, Ilya Mechnikov (1845\u20131916).\nEvolution.\nThe immune system is extremely ancient, and may go back to single-celled eukaryotes which needed to distinguish between what was food and what was part of themselves."}

Its chemical formula is SF6. It contains sulfur in its +6 oxidation state. It also contains fluoride ions.\nBBC News says \"It's the most powerful greenhouse gas known to humanity, and emissions have risen rapidly in recent years. Sulphur hexafluoride, or SF6, is widely used in the electrical industry to prevent short circuits and accidents. Leaks of the little-known gas in the UK and the rest of the EU in 2017 were the equivalent of putting an extra 1.3 million cars on the road\".\nProperties.\nSulfur hexafluoride is a colorless, odorless gas. It is very heavy for a gas (about 5 times heavier than air). It is non reactive, and hard to find anything that reacts with it. It is a strong greenhouse gas. This has made people put some restrictions on using it.\nPreparation.\nIt is made by reacting sulfur with fluorine. That combination also makes toxic disulfur decafluoride, which has to be removed.\nUses.\nIt is used in electronics and various electrical devices. It can be used in the body since it is not toxic. It can be used as a test gas to look where gas flows in a heater system, for example. It is detected easily. It is used in some torpedoes. Lithium is one of the only things that reacts with sulfur hexafluoride. Sulfur hexafluoride is sprayed on lithium. This makes the lithium very hot. It creates steam from water and shoots the torpedo. It can be breathed in to make the voice deeper. This is the opposite of breathing in helium gas.\nSafety.\nSulfur hexafluoride is not toxic. It can fill up in closed spaces though. A person may suffocate in the closed space if sulfur hexafluoride has pushed out the oxygen from the space.\nGreenhouse gas.\nAccording to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, is the most potent greenhouse gas that it has evaluated, with a global warming potential (GWP) of 22,800 times that of when compared over a 100-year period. Measurements of SF6 show that its global average mixing ratio has increased by about 0.2 ppt per year to over 7 ppt. Sulfur hexafluoride is also extremely long-lived. It is inert in the troposphere and stratosphere. It has an estimated atmospheric lifetime of 800\u20133200 years. is very stable. (For countries reporting their emissions to the UNFCCC, a GWP of 23,900 for was suggested at the third Conference of the Parties: GWP used in Kyoto protocol). Average global SF6 concentrations increased by about seven percent per year during the 1980s and 1990s, mostly as the result of its use in the magnesium production industry, and by electrical utilities and electronics manufacturers. Given the low amounts of SF6 released compared to carbon dioxide, its overall contribution to global warming is estimated to be less than 0.2 percent.\nIn Europe, falls under the F-Gas directive which ban or control its use in several ways. Since 1 January 2006, is banned as a tracer gas and in all applications except high-voltage switchgear.\nRelated pages.\nSalt"}

{"id": "263757", "revid": "68157", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=263757", "title": "Paridae", "text": "The Paridae is a family of tiny birds, the tits (called 'chickadees' or 'titmice' in North America). They are passerine songbirds which are native to the northern hemisphere and Africa. Most of them used to be classified in the genus \"Parus\", which has now been split up.\nThese birds are mainly small stocky woodland species with short stout bills. Some have crests. They range in length from 10 to 22 centimetres. They are adaptable birds, with a mixed diet including seeds and insects. \nMany species will live around human habitation and come readily to bird feeders for nuts or seed, and learn to take other foods. In Britain, great tits and blue tits learned to break through the foil caps sealing bottles of milk on doorsteps, to get at the cream on top. Of course, the change in milk packaging has robbed them of this delicacy.\nThese are hole-nesting birds, typically using trees, although some species build nests on the ground. They lay anything from three to nineteen speckled white eggs, depending on species.\nBehaviour.\nThe tits are active, noisy, social birds. They are territorial during the breeding season. The tits are highly adaptable and, after the corvids (crows and jays) and parrots, amongst the most intelligent of all birds.\nVocalisations.\nThe tits make a variety of calls and songs. They are amongst the most vocal of all birds, calling continuously and loudly. They are only ever silent for reasons such as avoiding predators or when intruding on a rival's territory. Quiet calls are made while feeding to keep contact with others in their social group. Other calls are used for signalling alarm\u2014the most famous of which is the \"Chic-a-dee-dee\" of North American species in the genus \"Poecile\". The call also serves a rallying call to summon others to mob and harass the predator. It has been demonstrated through experiments that the number of \"dee\" syllables at the end of the call increases with the level of danger the predator poses.\nDiet and feeding.\nThe tits are insectivorous, and eat a wide range of small insects and other invertebrates, particularly small leaf-eating caterpillars. They also eat seeds and nuts, especially in winter. A typical activity is \"hanging\", where they inspect a branch or twig and leaves from all angles while hanging upside down to feed. \nIn areas with several species of tit, the different species will forage (search) in different parts of a tree. Larger species search on the ground, medium sized species search on larger branches, and the smallest species on the ends of branches. If they get larger prey or seeds, tits will do 'hold-hammering'. They hold the item with one foot, and hammer it with their bill (beak) until it is open. In this way they can open hazelnuts in 20 minutes. \nMany birds store food in a cache or hiding place. They hoard supplies of food for the winter. These caches are usually of seeds but may be of insects."}

In 1963, she won the \"Sunday Times\" International Fashion Award, and was chosen as \"Woman of the Year\". \nQuant is famous as a designer who invented the miniskirt and hot pants. She was also instrumental in the mod fashion movement, and known for her use of pop art in fashion.\nBorn to Welsh parents in Blackheath, London, Quant went to Blackheath High School, then studied illustration at Goldsmiths College. Her first employment was as a couture milliner (hat maker). \nCareer.\nIn November 1955, she teamed up with her husband, Alexander Plunket Greene, and a former solicitor, Archie McNair, to open a clothes shop on the Kings Road in Chelsea called Bazaar. Bazaar's best sellers were small white plastic collars to brighten up black dresses or t-shirts. Black stretch stockings were also popular.\nMiniskirt.\nSkirts had been getting shorter since about 1958 \u2013 a development Mary Quant thought was practical and liberating, allowing women to run for a bus. The miniskirt, which she is most famous for, became one of the defining fashions of the 1960s. The miniskirt was also developed separately by Andr\u00e9 Courr\u00e8ges and John Bates, and there is disagreement as to who came up with the idea first. Like most fashion, the short- and ever-shorter skirt was evolving already among fashion-minded young women: the designers who adapted it just helped spread the style and, in Quant's case, gave it a name. Mary Quant named the miniskirt after her favourite make of car, the Mini. She loved the car so much, she had one designed especially for her.\nUndergarments and tights.\nQuant's first collection of underwear was designed to be worn with the miniskirt look. She renamed the basics \"booby traps and bacon savers\" (bras and tights), which appealed to her young customers. \nIn addition to the miniskirt, Mary Quant is often credited with inventing the coloured and patterned tights (pantyhose) that often went with the miniskirt. These are also attributed to Cristobal Balenciaga or John Bates. \nTights worn over briefs or bikini panties were an essential accessory to the miniskirt, because the older method of stockings plus suspenders was no longer suitable, and legs need to be covered for most of the year in Britain. Often there would be a second pair of coloured short pants on top of the tights, for show. A range of materials and colours were used for the tights.\nLater career.\nIn the late 1960s, Quant popularised hot pants. Through the 1970s and 1980s she concentrated on household goods and make-up, rather than just her clothing lines. At a talk at the Victoria and Albert Museum in 2007 she claimed to have invented duvet covers.\nShe is a Fellow of the Chartered Society of Designers, and winner of the \"Minerva Medal\", the Society's highest award. In 1963 Quant was the first winner of the 'Dress of the Year' award.\nIn 2000 she resigned as director of \"Mary Quant Ltd.\", her cosmetics company, after a Japanese buy-out. There are over 200 Mary Quant Colour shops in Japan, where Quant fashions continue to enjoy popularity."}

It is 10.5 to 12\u00a0cm (4.2 to 4.8\u00a0inches) long. \nThe blue tit is a widespread and common resident breeder. It lives throughout temperate and subarctic Europe and western Asia in deciduous or mixed woodlands. It is a resident bird; most do not migrate.\nBehaviour.\nBlue and great tits form mixed winter flocks, and the former are perhaps the better gymnasts on the slender twigs. A blue tit will often ascend a trunk in short jerky hops, imitating a treecreeper. As a rule the bird roosts in ivy or evergreens, but in hard weather will shelter in a hole. Blue tits are very agile and can hang from almost anywhere.\nThe blue tit has an average life expectancy of 1.5 years \nDiet.\nThe blue tit is a destroyer of pests. It is fond of young buds of various trees, and may pull them to bits in the hope of finding insects. No species, however, destroys more coccids and aphids, the worst foes of many plants. It also eats leaf miner grubs and green tortrix moths (Tortricidae). Seeds are eaten, as with all this family.\nLearning.\nAn interesting example of culturally transmitted learning in birds was the phenomenon dating from the 1960s of blue tits teaching one another how to open traditional British milk bottles with foil tops, to get at the cream underneath. This behaviour has declined recently because of the replacement of doorstep delivery by supermarket purchases of milk, and by hard-topped containers instead of the old bottles."}

He was made to teach people that forest fires are dangerous and how people can prevent them. An advertising campaign featuring Smokey was started in 1944 with the slogan, \"Smokey Says \u2013 Care Will Prevent 9 out of 10 Forest Fires\". Smokey Bear's later slogan, \"Remember... Only YOU Can Prevent Forest Fires\", was made in 1947 by the Ad Council. In April 2001, the message was changed to \"Only You Can Prevent Wildfires\". According to the Ad Council, Smokey Bear and his message are recognized by 95% of adults and 77% of children in the U.S.\nSmokey's correct name is Smokey Bear. In 1952, the songwriters Steve Nelson and Jack Rollins made a famous song named \"Smokey the Bear\". The pair said that \"the\" was added to Smokey's name to keep the song's rhythm. This small change has made people curious ever since. Smokey's name is spelled differently from the word \"smoky\" on purpose. \nThe fictional character Smokey Bear is run by three groups: the United States Forest Service, the National Association of State Foresters, and the Ad Council. Smokey Bear's name and image are protected by U.S. federal law, the \"Smokey Bear Act of 1952\" (16 U.S.C. 580 (p-2); 18 U.S.C. 711).\nBeginning the campaign.\nThough the US Forest Service fought wildfires long before World War II, the war made doing it even more important. The forest service began using colorful posters to teach Americans about the dangers of forest fires. Since most physically fit men who were able to already were serving in the armed forces, there were few people who could stay back and put them out as a job. The hope was that local communities, educated about the danger of forest fires, could prevent them from starting in the first place. However, Japan saw wildfires as a possible weapon. Forest fires could waste the time of people in the United States who could otherwise be involved in the war. They could also destroy natural resources.\nThe government made advertisements about fire safety. It decided to use a bear in the advertisement. The bear was named \"Smokey\" after \"Smokey\" Joe Martin, a New York City Fire Department hero who suffered burns and blindness during a brave 1922 rescue. \nSmokey's first poster was released on August 9, 1944. It was drawn by Albert Staehle. In the poster, Smokey was wearing jeans and a \"forest ranger's hat\" (a campaign hat), pouring a bucket of water on a campfire. The message underneath reads, \"Smokey says \u2013 Care will prevent 9 out of 10 forest fires!\" \nKnickerbocker Bears got a license to make Smokey bear dolls in 1944. \nAlso in 1944, Forest Service worker Rudy Wendelin became the full time campaign artist; he was considered Smokey Bear's \"caretaker\" until he retired in 1973.\nIn 1947, the saying now associated with Smokey Bear was first said: \"Remember...only YOU can prevent forest fires.\"\nThe living symbol of Smokey.\nThe living symbol of Smokey Bear was an American black bear who, in the spring of 1950, was caught in the Capitan Gap fire, a wildfire that burned in the Capitan Mountains of New Mexico. The cub was in the Lincoln National Forest. Smokey had climbed a tree to get away from the fire, but his paws and hind legs had been burned. He was rescued by a game warden after the fire.\nAt first, he was called \"Hotfoot Teddy,\" but he was later renamed Smokey, after the mascot. A local rancher who had been helping fight the fire took the cub home with him, but he needed care from a veterinarian. New Mexico Department of Game and Fish Ranger Ray Bell took him to Santa Fe. His wife, Ruth, and their children, Don and Judy, took care of the cub. News services around the country wrote stories about the cub, and he became famous. Soon after, Smokey was flown in a Piper Cub airplane to the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., where he lived for 26 years. After he died on November 9, 1976, Smokey's remains were returned by the government to Capitan, New Mexico, and buried at what is now the Smokey Bear Historical Park.\nSmokey as popular character.\nThe character became a big part of American popular culture in the 1950s. He appeared on radio programs, in comic strips and in cartoons.\nIn 1952, Congress passed the Smokey Bear Act, an act of Congress, was passed to remove the character from the public domain and place it under the control of the Secretary of Agriculture. This meant that people had to have permission from the government to use pictures of Smokey.\nIn the 1960s, so many people wanted to write letters to Smokey that the US Postal Service issued him his own ZIP Code. That code is 20252. Parts of those letters have been published online.\nLegacy.\nIn 2004, Smokey's 60th anniversary was celebrated. According to Richard Earle, author of \"The Art of Cause Marketing\", the Smokey Bear campaign is recognized one of the most powerful and lasting of all public service advertising. \"Smokey is simple, strong, straightforward,\" Earle writes. \"He's a denizen of those woods you're visiting, and he cares about preserving them. Anyone who grew up watching \"Bambi\" realizes how terrifying a forest fire can be. But Smokey wouldn't run away. Smokey's strong. He'll stay and fight the fire if necessary, but he'd rather have you douse it and cover it up so he doesn't have to.\"\nIn 2009, new commercials with Smokey made in CGI came out."}

They were designed as a response to the inadequacies of the trailers issued to flood victims by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The homes are designed to attempt to fulfill the needs of their occupants in a more permanent and weather-resistant manner, while addressing the challenges of building and protecting a home in the Gulf Coast region. Some of the homes are elevated, on stilts, particularly in southern Louisiana and Mississippi, where much of the land currently used is near sea level, protected by levees, or prone to flooding by nearby rivers or coastal storm surges or high tides.\nThough designs differ somewhat, the main factor for appearance is that Katrina cottages look like traditional homes in the area, reduced in size to lower costs and ease construction so that multiple units can be built quickly as needed. The Katrina cottages are usually one-bedroom, shotgun-house designs, with a front porch that helps stabilize the house from strong winds. Hence, they tend to be smaller than many house trailers, which have 2 or 3 bedrooms (as in a double wide trailer); however, the cottages are constructed of heavier materials to resist winds that would buckle the light-weight walls of mobile homes.\nThe best-known of these designs are those by Marianne Cusato, whose original \"Katrina Cottage\" made the term popular and received in 2006 the first annual People's Design Award from the Cooper-Hewitt Museum of the U.S. Smithsonian Institution. As Cusato's design and others gained increasing media attention, the number of designs has increased. The home-improvement retailer Lowe's offers pre-packaged Katrina Cottage kits, including plans and all materials needed for construction. A Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) pilot program accommodating 900 Mississippi coast families encountered some opposition from local government officials opposed to permanent small housing units, although Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour urged local officials to accept the cottages as safer than trailers, in high winds or moderate floods."}

A traction motor is used to make rotation torque on a machine. It is usually changed into a straight line motion.\nTraction motors are used in electrically powered rail vehicles such as electric multiple units and electric locomotives. They are also used in electric vehicles, such as electric milk floats, elevators, and conveyors. Vehicles with electrical transmission systems such as Diesel-electric locomotives, electric hybrid vehicles and battery powered electric vehicles. \nTransportation applications.\nRailroad.\nRailroads first used DC motors. These motors usually ran on about 600 volts. High-powered semiconductors were developed to control the switching of AC motors. They have made AC induction motors a better choice. An induction motor does not require contacts inside the motor. These AC motors are simpler, and more reliable than the old DC motors. AC induction motors known as \"asynchronous traction motors\". \nBefore the mid-20th century, a single large motor was often used to drive multiple wheels through connecting rods. This was the same way that steam locomotives would turn their drive wheels. Now, the normal practice is to use one traction motor to drive each axle through a gear drive.\nUsually, the traction motor is mounted between the wheel frame and the driven axle. This is called a \"nose-suspended traction motor\". The problem with this mounting is that some of the motor's weight is on the axle. This causes the track and frame to wear out faster. The \"Bi-Polar\" electric locomotives built by General Electric for the Milwaukee Road had direct drive motors. The rotating shaft of the motor was also the axle for the wheels. \nThe DC motor is made in two parts; the \"rotating armature\" and the \"fixed field windings\". The field windings, also called the \"stator\", surrounds the armature. The field windings are made of tightly wound coils of wire inside the motor case. The armature, also called the \"rotor\", is another set of coils of wire wound round the central shaft. The armature is connected to the field windings through \"brushes\". The brushes are spring loaded contacts pressing against the \"commutator\". The commutator sends the electricity in a circular pattern to armature windings. A \"series-wound\" motor has the armature and the field windings connected in series. A series-wound DC motor has a low electrical resistance. When voltage is applied to the motor, it makes a strong magnetic field inside the motor. This produces a high amount of torque, so it is good for starting a train. If more current than needed is sent to the motor, there would be too much torque and the wheels would spin. If too much current is sent to the motor, it could damage the motor. Resistors are used to limit the current when the motor starts.\nAs the DC motor starts to turn, the magnetic fields inside start to join together. They create an internal voltage. This electromagnetic force (EMF) works against the voltage sent to the motor. The EMF controls the current flow in the motor. As the motor speeds up, the EMF falls. Less current flows into the motor, and it makes less torque. The motor will stop increasing its speed when the torque matches (is the same as) the drag on the train. To accelerate the train, more voltage must be sent to the motor. One or more resistors are removed to increase the voltage. This will increase the current. The torque will increase, and so will the speed of the train. When no resistors are left in the circuit, full line voltage is applied directly to the motor. \nOn an electric train, the train driver originally had to control the speed by changing the resistance manually. By 1914, automatic acceleration was being used. This was achieved by an accelerating relay in the motor circuit. This was often called a \"notching relay\". The relay would watch the fall of current and control the resistance. All the driver had to do was select low, medium or full speed. These speeds are called \"shunt\", \"series\" and \"parallel\" from the way the motors were wired.\nRoad vehicles.\nTraditionally road vehicles (cars, buses and trucks) have used diesel or gasoline engines with a transmission. In the latter part of the 20th century, vehicles with electrical transmission systems began to be developed. These vehicles have a source of electricity from batteries or fuel cells. They may also be powered by an internal combustion engines. \nA benefit from using electric motors is that some types can generate energy. They act as a dynamo during braking. This helps improve the efficiency of the vehicle.\nCooling.\nBecause of the high power levels used by traction motors, they create a lot of heat. They usually require cooling, often with forced air.\nOther websites.\n[[Category:Motors]]\n[[Category:Locomotives]]\n[[Category:Vehicles]]\n[[Category:Electricity]]"}

They are used in groups of 2, as a pair of opening and closing marks. They are used in either of two forms: or .\nDepending on the typeface, the opening and closing quotation marks may be identical in form (called \u201cvertical\u201d or \u201cstraight\u201d or \u201ctypewriter\u201d quotation marks), or they may be distinctly left-handed and right-handed (\u201ctypographic\u201d or, colloquially, \u201ccurly\u201d quotation marks). The closing single quotation mark is identical or similar in form to the apostrophe, and similar to the prime symbol. However, these three characters have quite different purposes. See also: ditto mark.\nUsage.\nQuotations and speech.\nQuotation marks show that part of the text is either a person speaking or a quotation. Double quotation marks are used as a rule in the United States, while both single and double quotation marks are used in the United Kingdom and other commonwealth countries. A publisher\u2019s or author\u2019s style can be considered as more important than national preferences. However, the style of opening and closing quotation marks must be matched:\nFor speech within speech, the other mark is used for inner quotations, within a quotation:\nSometimes, quotations are nested in more than two levels. Nesting levels up to five can be found in some translations of the Bible. In these cases, questions arise about the form (and names) of the quotation marks to be used. The most common way is to simply alternate between the two forms, thus:\nIf such a passage is further quoted in another publication, then all of their forms have to be shifted over by one level.\nIn most cases, quotations which span multiple paragraphs should be set as block quotations, and thus do not require quotation marks. Quotation marks are used for multiple-paragraph quotations in some cases, especially in narratives. The convention in English is to put an opening quotation mark at the first and each subsequent paragraph, but use a closing quotation mark only for the final paragraph of the quotation, as in the following example from the book \"Pride and Prejudice\":\nAs noted below, in some older texts, the quotation mark is repeated every line, rather than every paragraph. The Spanish convention uses closing quotation marks at the beginning of all subsequent paragraphs beyond the first.\nWhen quoted text is interrupted, such as with the phrase \"he said,\" a closing quotation mark is used before the interruption, and an opening quotation mark after. Commas are also often used before and after the interruption, more often for quotations of speech than for quotations of text:\nIt is incorrect to use quotation marks for paraphrased speech. This is because a paraphrase is an indirect quote, and in the course of any composition, it is important to document when one is using a quotation versus when one is using a paraphrased idea.\nIf HAL says: \u201cAll systems are functional,\u201d then:\nHowever, another convention when quoting text in the body of a paragraph or sentence\u2014for example, in an essay\u2014is to recognize double quotation marks as marking an exact quotation, and single quotation marks as marking a paraphrased quotation or a quotation where grammar, pronouns, or plurality have been changed in order to fit the sentence containing the quotation (see reported speech).\nIrony.\nAnother common use of quotation marks is to indicate or call attention to ironic or mis-used words:\nQuotes indicating irony, or other special use, are sometimes called scare quotes. They are sometimes gestured in oral speech using air quotes.\nSignaling unusual usage.\nQuotation marks are also used to indicate that the writer realizes that a word is not being used in its current commonly accepted sense.\nIn addition to conveying a neutral attitude and to call attention to a neologism, or slang, or special terminology (also known as jargon), quoting can also indicate words or phrases that are \"descriptive\" but unusual, colloquial, folksy, startling, humorous, metaphoric, or contain a pun:\nDawkins\u2019s concept of a meme could be described as an \u201cevolving idea\u201d.\nPeople also use quotation marks in this way to:\nThe \"Chicago Manual of Style\" (CMS), 15th edition acknowledges this type of use but cautions against overuse in section 7.58, \u201cQuotation marks are often used to alert readers that a term is used in a nonstandard, ironic, or other special sense [\u2026] They imply \u2018This is not my term,\u2019 or \u2018This is not how the term is \"usually\" applied.\u2019 Like any such device, scare quotes lose their force and irritate readers if overused.\u201d\nUse\u2013mention distinction.\nUsing either quotation marks or italics can emphasize that an instance of a word refers to the word itself, rather than its associated concept.\nA three-way distinction is occasionally made between normal use of a word (no quotation marks), referring to the concept behind the word (single quotation marks), and the word itself (double quotation marks):\nThe logic, for this form, derives from the need to distinguish use forms, coupled with the mandate to retain consistent notation for like use forms. The switching between double and single quotes in nested citation quotes reveals the same literary device for reducing ambiguity.\nBooks about language often use italics for the word itself and single quotation marks for a gloss:\nTitles of artistic works.\nQuotation marks, rather than italics, are generally used for the titles of shorter works. Whether these are single or double is again a matter of style; however, many styles, especially for poetry, prefer the use of single quotation marks.\nAs a rule, a whole publication would be italicised, whereas the titles of minor works (such as poems or short stories inside the collection) would be written with quotation marks.\nNicknames and false titles.\nQuotation marks can also offset a nickname embedded in an actual name, or a false or ironic title embedded in an actual title; for example, Nat \u201cKing\u201d Cole, Miles \u201cTails\u201d Prower, or John \u201cHannibal\u201d Smith.\nEmphasis (incorrect usage).\nQuotes are sometimes used incorrectly for emphasis in lieu of underlining or italics, most commonly on signs or placards. This usage can be confused with ironic or altered-usage quotation, sometimes with unintended humor. For example, \"For sale: \u201cfresh\u201d fish, \u201cfresh\u201d oysters\", could be construed to imply that \"fresh\" is not used with its everyday meaning, or indeed to indicate that the fish or oysters are anything but fresh. And again, \"Cashiers\u2019 desks open until noon for your \u201cconvenience\u201d\" might mean that the convenience was for the bank employees, not the customers.\nTypographical considerations.\nPunctuation.\nWith quotation marks that are next to other punctuation marks, there are two main systems. They are called \u201cAmerican\u201d and \u201cBritish,\u201d but some American writers and organizations use the British style and vice versa. Both systems have the same rules for question marks, exclamation points, colons, and semicolons. They have different rules for periods and commas.\nIn both systems, question marks and exclamation marks are placed inside or outside quoted material depending on whether they are for the whole sentence or just the quoted words, but colons and semicolons always go outside.\nIn American style, commas and periods almost always go inside closing quotation marks. \nThis style of punctuation is common in the U.S., Canada, and it is also used in the U.K. in fiction and journalism.\nIn British style, which is sometimes called logical punctuation, the rule is the same as for question marks and exclamation points: the comma or period goes outside if it is for the whole sentence but inside if it is for just the quoted words. This is called \u201cplacement according to sense.\u201d\nWhen dealing with words-as-words, short-form works like the titles of songs, and sentence fragments, the two systems are different:\nFor quoting direct speech, American rules place periods and commas inside the quotation marks all the time. In fiction, both styles are the same. In non-fiction, British publishers may permit placing punctuation that is not part of the person\u2019s speech inside the quotation marks but prefer that it be placed outside. According to the \"Cambridge Handbook for Editors, Copy-editors and Proofreaders\", periods and commas that \"are\" part of the person\u2019s speech are permitted inside the quotation marks regardless.\nMany American style guides explicitly permit periods and commas outside the quotation marks when the presence of the punctuation mark inside the quotation marks will lead to ambiguity, such as when describing keyboard input:\nIn the first two sentences above, only one punctuation mark is used at the end of each. Regardless of its placement, only one end mark (?, !, or .) can end a sentence in American English. Only the period, however, \"cannot\" end a quoted sentence when it does not also end the enclosing sentence, except for literal text:\nReferences: \"Chicago Manual of Style\", 15th edition; \"Hart\u2019s Rules for Compositors and Readers at the University Press, Oxford\"; \"Merriam-Webster\u2019s Guide to Punctuation and Style\", second edition.\nSpacing.\nIn English, when a quotation follows other writing on a line of text, a space precedes the opening quotation mark unless the preceding symbol, such as a dash, requires that there be no space. When a quotation is followed by other writing on a line of text, a space follows the closing quotation mark unless it is immediately followed by other punctuation within the sentence, such as a colon or closing punctuation. (These exceptions are ignored by some Asian computer systems that systematically display quotation marks with the included spacing, as this spacing is part of the fixed-width characters.)\nThere is generally no space between an opening quotation mark and the following word, or a closing quotation mark and the preceding word. When a double quotation mark or a single quotation mark immediately follows the other, proper spacing for legibility requires that a non-breaking space be inserted.\nNon-language related usage.\nStraight quotation marks (or italicized straight quotation marks) are often used to approximate the prime and double prime. For example, when signifying feet and inches, arcminutes and arcseconds, or minutes and seconds, where the quotation mark symbolises the latter part of the pair. For instance, 5 feet and 6\u00a0inches is often written 5' 6\", and 40 degrees, 20 arcminutes and 50 arcseconds is written 40\u00b0 20' 50\". When available, however, the prime should be used instead (e.\u00a0g., 5\u2032 6\u2033, and 40\u00b0 20\u2032 50\u2033). Prime and double prime are not present in most character sets, including ASCII and Latin-1, but are present in Unicode, as characters U+2032 (dec. 8242) and U+2033 (dec. 8243), and as HTML entities &amp;prime; and &amp;Prime;. Double quotation marks are also often used to represent the ditto mark.\nStraight single and double quotation marks are used in most programming languages to delimit strings or literal characters. In some languages (e.\u00a0g. Pascal) only one type is allowed, in some (e.\u00a0g. C and its derivatives) both are used with different meanings and in others (e.\u00a0g. Python) both are used interchangeably. In some languages, if it is desired to include the same quotation marks used to delimit a string inside the string, the quotation marks are doubled. For example, to represent the string eat 'hot' dogs in Pascal one uses 'eat \"hot\" dogs'. Other languages use an escape character, often the backslash, as in 'eat \\'hot\\' dogs'.\nTyping quotation marks on a computer keyboard.\nStandard English computer keyboard layouts inherited the single and double \u201cstraight\u201d quotation marks from the typewriter (the single quotation mark also doubling as an apostrophe), and they do not include individual keys for left-handed and right-handed typographic quotation marks. However, most computer text-editing programs provide a \u201csmart quotes\u201d feature (see below) to automatically convert \u201cstraight\u201d quote marks into typographic punctuation. Generally, this \u201csmart quote\u201d feature is enabled by default. Some websites do not allow typographic quotation marks or apostrophes in posts (one such example being YouTube). One can skirt these limitations, however, by using the HTML character codes or entities.\nSmart quotes.\nTo make typographic quotation marks easier to enter, publishing software often automatically converts typewriter quotation marks (and apostrophes) to typographic form during text entry (with or without the user being aware of it). This is known as the \u201csmart quotes\u201d feature. Quotation marks that are not automatically altered by computer programs are known as \u201cdumb quotes\u201d. Some implementations incorrectly produce an opening single quotation mark in places where an apostrophe is required, for example, in abbreviated years like \"\u201908\" for \"2008\".\nHistory.\nIn the first centuries of typesetting, writers showed quoted speech by saying who was speaking. Some versions of the Bible still do it this way. During the Renaissance, writers showed quoted speech by using a typeface different from the main body text, like we use italics today. Long quotations were also set this way, at full size and full measure.\nQuotation marks were first cut in metal type during the middle of the sixteenth century, printers were using them a lot by the seventeenth. In some Baroque and Romantic-period books, quotation marks would be repeated at the beginning of every line of a long quotation. When printers stopped doing this, they still kept the empty margin, which is where we get our modern practice of indenting before block quotation.\nIn Early Modern English, quotation marks were used only to denote pithy comments. Writers first began to use them for direct speech in 1714. By 1749, writers were using single quotation marks, or inverted commas, for direct speech."}

It refers to the creation of exclusive custom-fitted clothing. The term refers to: \n\"Haute couture\" is made to order for a specific customer. It is usually made from high-quality, expensive fabric and sewn with extreme attention to detail and finish by the most experienced and capable seamstresses, often using time-consuming, hand-executed techniques. \"Couture\" is a common abbreviation of \"haute couture\".\nIn France, \"haute couture\" is \"une appellation juridiquement prot\u00e9g\u00e9e\" (a legally protected name). It may only be used by firms which meet certain well-defined standards. However, the term is also used to describe all high-fashion custom-fitted clothing in other 'fashion capitals' such as Milan, London, New York, Tokyo and Madrid. \nHistory.\nThe \"couturier\" Charles Frederick Worth (13 October 1826\u201310 March 1895), is widely considered the father of \"haute couture\" as it is known today. Although born in Lincolnshire, England, Worth made his mark in the French fashion industry. He revolutionized how dressmaking was organised. Worth made it so the dressmaker became an \"artist\": a fashion designer. He created one-of-a-kind designs to please his titled or rich customers. More importantly, he prepared designs which were shown on live models at the \"House of Worth\". Clients selected a design, specified colours and fabrics, and had a version tailor-made in Worth's workshop. Worth combined individual tailoring with a standardization more characteristic of the ready-to-wear clothing industry, which was also developing during this period.\n\"Chambre syndicale\".\nTo earn the right to call itself a couture house and to use the term \"haute couture\", members of the \"Chambre syndicale de la haute couture\" must follow these rules:\nMembership is seldom given. Outside the \"Chambre syndicale\" are many successful fashion houses which deal in \"pr\u00eat-\u00e0-porter\" (the French term for ready-to-wear fashion). They have their own \"Chambre syndicale du pr\u00eat-\u00e0-porter\"."}

{"id": "264055", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=264055", "title": "Emoticon", "text": "An emoticon () is a written symbol, often as 2 or 3 punctuation characters, that stands for the writer's mood or facial expression. Some examples are: a smile \":-)\" or wink \";-)\" or frown \":(\" or dog nose \":O\" or le meme arrow \"&gt;\" (see many other examples in text below). Emoticons are often used to tell a reader about the general tone of a statement, and can change or improve the reading of plain writing. Over the years, many kinds of emoticons have been created, and now there are hundreds of known emoticons. The word \"emoticon\" is a blend of the English words \"emotion\" (or \"emote\") and \"icon\". In web forums, instant messengers and online games, text emoticons are often automatically replaced with small pictures, which came to be called \"emoticons\" as well. Certain complex character combinations can only be accomplished in a double-byte language, giving rise to very complex forms, sometimes known by their romanized Japanese name of \"kaomoji\".\nThe use of emoticons can be traced back to the 19th century, and they were commonly used in casual or humorous writing. In 1912, a smiling mouth (or snigger point) was shown in typewriter text as \"\\___/!\". Digital forms of emoticons on the Internet were written in an email during 1982.\nHistory.\nAntecedents.\nIn April 1857, the \"National Telegraphic Review and Operators Guide\" wrote about the use of the number 73 in Morse code to mean \"love and kisses\" (later changed to \"best regards\"). A few years later, \"Dodge's Manual\" talked about a new way to show \"love and kisses\", the number 88.\nA \"New York Times\" transcript of an 1862 speech given by Abraham Lincoln contains \";)\" (now known as a winky-face). There is some debate as to whether it is a typo, a legitimate form of punctuation, or an emoticon.\nTypographical emoticons were published in 1881 by the U.S. satirical magazine \"Puck\". In 1912, Ambrose Bierce created something called a \"snigger point\". \"It is written thus \\___/! and presents a smiling mouth.\"\nEmoticons had already come into use in sci-fi fandom in the 1940s, although there seems to have been a lapse in cultural continuity between the communities.\nIn 1963 the \"smiley face\", a yellow button with two black dots representing eyes and an upturned thick curve representing a mouth, was created by freelance artist Harvey Ball. This smiley probably inspired many later emoticons; the most basic picture that shows this is in fact a small yellow smiley face.\nIn a \"New York Times\" interview in April 1969, Alden Whitman asked writer Vladimir Nabokov: \"How do you rank yourself among writers (living) and of the immediate past?\" Nabokov answered: \"I often think there should exist a special typographical sign for a smile \u2013 some sort of concave mark, a supine round bracket, which I would now like to trace in reply to your question.\"\nPre-1980 emoticons.\nAs early early as 1973 or earlier, teletype machine users used \"emoticons\" to express themselves. Teletypes were limited to the keys of a standard typewriter keyboard plus a few special characters. Teletype operators developed a sort of shorthand to communicate among themselves. These shorthand notations became the foundation of \"emoticons\" as video terminals began to replace teletypes in general use.\nBy the early 1970s, people on the PLATO System were using emoticons. They had many of the advantages of later character-based emoticons because they could be used anywhere that you could type text. They also had many of the advantages of later graphical emoticons because they used character overstriking which created graphical images.\nSeveral Internet websites \u2013such as BT's Connected Earth\u2013 assert that Kevin Mackenzie proposed -) as a joke-marker in April 1979, on the \"MsgGroup\" ARPANET mailing list. The idea was to indicate tongue-in-cheek, with the hyphen represented a tongue, not a nose:\nOthers used :-) for tongue-in-cheek, with the colon representing teeth. Also used was -:) to indicate sticking out your tongue, in derision or anger. Although similar to a sideways smiling face, the intended interpretation was different and this does not appear to have inspired the later smileys.\nIn the late sixties, the APL programming language and timesharing environment, with its rich character set with backspace and overstrike capability provided a fruitful arena for interactive and creative symbol invention. Union-backspace-dieresis (\u222a\u0308) was a recognised and upright smiley in the early seventies.\nCreation of :-) and :-(.\nThe first person documented to have used the emoticons :-) and :-(, with a specific suggestion that they be used to express emotion, was Scott Fahlman in the U.S. at Carnegie Mellon University; the text of his original proposal, posted to the Carnegie Mellon University computer science general board on 19 September 1982 (11:44), was thought to have been lost, but was recovered twenty years later by Jeff Baird from old backup tapes.\nWithin a few months, it had spread to the ARPANET (the early Internet) and \nUsenet. Many variations on the theme were immediately suggested by Scott and others.\nGraphical replacement.\nIn web forums, instant messengers and online games, text emoticons are often automatically replaced with small corresponding images, which also came to be called \"Emoticons.\" Similarly, in some versions of Microsoft Word, the Auto Correct feature replaces basic smileys such as :-) and :-( with a single smiley-like character. Originally, these image emoticons were fairly simple and replaced only the most straightforward and common character sequences, but over time they became so complex that the more specialized emoticons are often input using a menu or popup windows, sometimes listing hundreds of items. Emoticons have also expanded beyond simple cartoon facial expressions to a variety of still or moving images. Some of these graphical emoticons do not actually represent faces or emotions; for example, an \"emoticon\" showing a guitar might be used to represent music. Further, some instant messaging software is designed to play a sound upon receiving certain emoticons.\nMany applications use text codes, which become replaced with a graphical emoticon. For example, :dance: or (dance) could be replaced with a graphical dancing emoticon. A web-forum software package which performed this transformation was Proxicom Forum, developed in 1996.\nAn August 2004 issue of the \"Risks Digest\" (\"comp.risks\" on USENET) pointed out a problem with such features which are not under the sender's control:\nMany sites use GIF or PNG graphic files, because of their transparency and small file size capabilities. Files can be created using a raster graphics editor. Many emoticon artists design their emoticons pixel by pixel. Some emoticons are made in vector format, such as SVG, and automatically processed using a graphics library. This allows SVG files to be automatically rendered as a GIF or PNG file, which is compatible with most browsers, which SVG is not.\nWestern style.\nTraditionally, the emoticon in Western style is written from left to right, the way one reads and writes in most Western cultures. Thus, most commonly, emoticons have the eyes on the left, followed by the nose and mouth. To more easily recognize them, tilt your head toward your left shoulder (or occasionally toward your right shoulder if the \"top\" of the emoticon is toward the right).\nCommon western examples.\nThe most basic emoticons are relatively consistent in form, but each of them can also be transformed by being rotated (making them tiny ambigrams), with or a without hyphen (nose).\nThere are also some possible variations to emoticons to get new definitions, like changing a character to express a new feeling, or slightly change the mood of the emoticon. For example, :( equals sad and :(( equals very sad or weeping. A :\"&gt; blush can be expressed as :\"u blushing for you or a surprised blush, o///o . Others include wink ;) a grin :D smug :-&gt; and tongue out :P for disgust or simply just to stick the tongue out for silliness, such as when blowing a raspberry. An often used combination is also &lt;3 for a heart, and &lt;/3 for a broken heart. A cute and sometimes gamine smile can be expressed like this: :3\nVariation.\nAn equal sign is often used for the eyes in place of the colon, without changing the meaning of the emoticon. In these instances, the hyphen is almost always either omitted or, occasionally, replaced with an 'o' as in =O) . In most circles it has become acceptable to omit the hyphen, whether a colon or an equal sign is used for the eyes, e.g. :) . In some areas of usage, people prefer the larger, more traditional emoticon :-) . In general, similar-looking characters are commonly substituted for one another: for instance, o, O, and 0 can all be used interchangeably, sometimes for subtly different effect. In some cases, one type of character may look better in a certain font and therefore be preferred over another.\nSome variants are also more common in certain countries because of reasons like keyboard layouts, for example the smiley =) is common in Scandinavia where the keys for = and ) are placed right beside each other. Also, sometimes, the user can replace the brackets used for the mouth with other, similar shapes, such as ] and [ instead of ) and ( .\nDiacritical marks are sometimes used. An O or U with an umlaut, \u00d6, \u00dc can be seen as an emoticon, as the upright version of :O (meaning that one is surprised) and :D (meaning that one is very happy). nwn (Meaning one is super happy).\nAsian style.\nUsers from East Asia popularized a style of emoticons that can be understood without tilting one's head to the left. This style arose on ASCII NET of Japan in 1986. Similar looking emoticons were used by Byte Information Exchange (BIX) around the same time.\nThese emoticons are usually found in a format similar to (*_*). The asterisks indicate the eyes; the central character, commonly an underscore, the mouth; and the parentheses, the outline of the face. Two separate studies, in 2007 at Hokkaido University and in 2009 at Glasgow University, showed that Japanese and other East Asians read facial expressions by looking mainly at the eyes, and the researchers noted that this is reflected in East Asian emoticons which put emphasis on the eyes, compared to Western emoticons which emote mainly with the mouth.\nDifferent emotions such as (\")(-_-)(\"), are expressed by changing the character representing the eyes, for example ' T ' can be used to express crying or sadness (T_T). The emphasis on the eyes is reflected in the common usage of emoticons that use only the eyes, e.g. ^^. Looks of stress are represented by the likes of (x_x) while (-_-;) is a generic emote for nervousness, the semicolon indicating sweat that occurs during anxiety. Repeating the /// mark (///) can indicate embarrassment by symbolizing blushing. Characters like hyphens or periods can replace the underscore; the period is often used for a smaller, \"cuter\" mouth or to represent a nose, e.g. (^.^). Alternatively, the mouth/nose can be left out entirely, e.g. (^^). The parentheses also can often be replaced with braces, e.g. {^_^}. Many times, the parentheses are left out completely, e.g. ^^, &gt;.&lt;, o_O, O.O, &lt;.&lt;;, though this is more likely in Western culture. A quotation mark \", apostrophe ', or semicolon ; can be added to the emoticon to imply apprehension or embarrassment, in the same way that a sweat drop is used in anime.\nMicrosoft IME 2002 (Japanese) or later supports the use of both forms of emoticons by enabling Microsoft IME Spoken Language Dictionary. In IME 2007, it was moved to Emoticons dictionary.\nFurther variations of emoticons may be produced by using Combining characters, e.g. \u033c\u2302\u033a\u035b\u1d16\u0332\u033f\u1d25\u0332\u033f\u1d16\u033a\u035b\u2302\u033c and \u0669(\u0361\u0e4f\u032f\u0361\u0e4f)\u06f6 .\nCommon eastern examples.\nAll of these can be used also with [ ] instead of ( ), or without the parentheses at all in some of the cases\nKorean Style.\nIn South Korea, emoticons using Korean Hangul letters have been getting popular lately as well. Korean styles of face emoticons are similar to those of Japan's, but they contain Korean jamos (letters) instead of other characters. There are countless number of emoticons that can be formed with such combinations of Korean jamos, but popular choices include letter \u3145 or \u3142 as the mouth/nose component and \u3147,\u314e,\u314d for the eyes. For example: \u3147\u3145\u3147, \u3147\u3142\u3147, -\u3145-, \u3161\u3161, \u31616\u3161. Faces such as '\u3145', \"\u3145\", '\u3142','\u3147', using quotation marks \" and apostrophes ' are also commonly used combinations. Vowel jamos such as \u315c,\u3160 can be used in substitute to T, when depicting a crying face. Example: //\u3145//, \u315c_\u315c, \u3160_\u3160. Sometimes the underscore is omitted, and the two letters can be mixed together, as in \u315c_\u3160, \u3161^\u315c, \u315c\u3147\u3161 . Also, semicolons are used a lot in Korean emoticons. Example: \u3161\u3161;;;;, \u3147\u3145\u3147;;;, \u3142\u3147\u3142;, \u314e\u3147\u314e;;;;.\n-_-\nSingle or multiple ; (Semicolons) are often used together with faces depicting embarrassment, for an added effect. Also, other characters may be added to indicate hands, similar to the Japanese emoticons; but usually they are only attached on the right. Example: -\u3145-a (scratching one's head), '\u3145'b (Thumbs up), '\u3145'\u3157 (The finger)\nIn some cases, like \u314e_\u314e, the emoticon can mean an emotion even when it is not depicting a face of any specific emotion. Letters \u314e and \u314b are widely used in Korean internet as a sign of laughter (similar to the usage of \"w\" in Japanese Web)for example \u314b\u3147\u314b, \u314e\u3147\u314e, \u314b\u3145\u314b, \u314b-\u314b, \u314e_\u314e; and so the emoticons using those letters as the eye component can be interpreted as a laughing face.\nAlso, \u3147\u3148\u3134 is a Korean version of Orz - although OTL is used more often- depicting a man kneeling down.\nWestern use of East Asian style.\nEnglish-language anime forums adopted those emoticons that could be used with the standard ASCII characters available on western keyboards. Because of this, they are often called \"anime style\" emoticons in the English-speaking Internet. They have since seen use in more mainstream venues, including online gaming, instant-messaging, and other non-anime related forums. Emoticons such as &lt;(^.^)&gt;,&lt;(^_^&lt;),&lt;(o_o&lt;),&lt;( -'.'- )&gt;,&lt;('.'-^),(.\u3145.), which include the parentheses, mouth or nose, and arms (especially those represented by the inequality signs &lt; or &gt;) also are often referred to as \"Kirbies\" in reference to their likeness to Nintendo's video game character, Kirby. The parentheses are usually dropped when used in the English language context, and the underscore of the mouth may be extended as an intensifier, e.g. ^__________^ for very happy. People also use &gt;&lt; or : ). Usually on MSN, people use O.O or : ( \"Screw you\" is represented by a smiley showing middle finger(s) .!._(\u00d2_\u00f3)_.!..\nMixture of Western and East Asian style.\nExposure to both Western and East Asian style emoticons or emoji through web blogs, instant messaging, and forums featuring a blend of Western and Asian pop culture, has given rise to emoticons that have an upright viewing format. The parentheses are similarly dropped in the English language context and the emoticons only use alphanumeric characters and the most commonly used English punctuation marks. Emoticons such as -O-, -3-, -w-, '_', ;_;, T_T, :&gt;, and .V., are used to convey mixed emotions that are more difficult to convey with traditional emoticons. Characters are sometimes added to emoticons to convey an anime or manga-styled sweat drop, for example: ^_^' or !&gt;_&lt;! or ^3^' or v3v; as well as: &lt;@&gt;_________&lt;@&gt;;; ;O; and *u*\nThe equal sign can also be used for closed, anime looking eyes, for example: =0=, =3=, =w=, =A=\nThere are also more faces along those lines like &gt;o&lt;; using the ; as a sweat mark, and the \"o\" as a mouth, and the inequality signs as the eyes, it shows stress, or slight confusion. The amount of emoticons that can be made are limitless, and all have their own meaning.\nIn Brazil, sometimes combining character (accent) are added to emoticons to represent eyebrows, like: \u00f2_\u00f3 or \u00f3_\u00f2 or \u00f5_o or \u00f9_u or o_\u00d4. They can also replace (or add) \"=\" or \":\" by \"&gt;\", example: &gt;D or &gt;=D or &gt;P or &gt;:P or &gt;3 or &gt;:3.\n2channel style.\nThe Japanese language is usually encoded using double-byte character codes. As a result, there is a bigger variety of characters that can be used in emoticons, many of which cannot be reproduced in ASCII. Most kaomoji contain Cyrillic and other foreign letters to create even more complicated expressions analogous to ASCII art's level of complexity. To type such emoticons, the input editor that is used to type Japanese on a user's system has a dictionary of emoticons, after which the user simply types the Japanese word (or something close to it) that represents the desired emoticon to convert the input into such complicated emoticons. Such expressions are known as Shift JIS art.\nUsers of 2channel in particular have developed a wide variety of unique emoticons using obscure characters. Some have taken on a life of their own and become characters in their own right, like Mona.\nPosture emoticons.\nOrz.\nOrz (also seen as Or2, on_, OTZ, OTL, STO, JTO, _no, \uff3f\u5182\u25cb, \u56e7rz, O7Z, _|7O, Sto, and Jto) is a Japanese emoticon representing a kneeling or bowing person, with the \"o\" being the head, the \"r\" being the arms and part of the body, and the \"z\" being part of the body and the legs. This stick figure represents failure and despair. It is also commonly used for representing a great admiration (sometimes with an overtone of sarcasm) for someone else's view or action.\nIt was first used in late 2002 at the forum on Techside, Japanese personal website. At the \"Techside FAQ Forum\" (TECHSIDE\u6559\u3048\u3066\u541bBBS(\u6559\u3048\u3066BBS) ), a poster asked about a cable cover, typing \"\uff3f|\uffe3|\u25cb\" to show a cable and its cover. Others commented that it looked like a kneeling person, and the symbol became popular. These comments were soon deleted as they were considered off-topic. However, one of the first corresponding reactions can be found on the thread on , on December 23, 2002. By 2005, Orz spawned a subculture: blogs have been devoted to the emoticon, and URL shortening services have been named after it. In Taiwan, Orz is associated with the phrase \"nice guy\"\u2013that is, the concept of males being rejected for a date by girls they are pursuing with a phrase like \"You are a nice guy.\"\nOrz should not be confused with m(_\u00a0_)m, which means an apology.\nMultimedia variations.\nA portmanteau of \"emotion\" and \"sound\", an emotisound is a brief sound transmitted and played back during the viewing of a message, typically an IM message or e-mail message. The sound is intended to communicate an emotional subtext. Many instant messaging clients automatically trigger sound effects in response to specific emoticons.\nSome services, such as MuzIcons, combine emoticons and Adobe Flash music player in a widget.\nIn 2004, The Trillian chat application introduced an feature called \"emotiblips\", which allows Trillian users to stream files to their instant message recipients \"as the voice and video equivalent of an emoticon\".\nIn 2007, MTV and Paramount Home Entertainment promoted the \"emoticlip\" as a form of viral marketing for the second season of the show \"The Hills\". The emoticlips were twelve short snippets of dialogue from the show, uploaded to YouTube, which the advertisers hoped would be distributed between web users as a way of expressing feelings in a similar manner to emoticons. The emoticlip concept is credited to the Bradley &amp; Montgomery advertising firm, which hopes they would be widely adopted as \"greeting cards that just happen to be selling something\".\nIn 2008 an emotion-sequence animation tool, called FunIcons was created. The Adobe Flash and Java-based application allows users to create a short animation. Users can then email or save their own animations to use them on similar social utility applications.\nEmoticons and intellectual property rights.\nIn 2000 Despair, Inc. obtained a U.S. trademark registration for the \"frowny\" emoticon :-( when used on \"greeting cards, posters and art prints.\" In 2001, they issued a satirical press release, announcing that they would sue Internet users who typed the frowny; the joke backfired and the company received a storm of protest when its mock release was posted at technology news website Slashdot. They subsequently issued another press release a month later in response to the reaction their claim had generated.\nA number of patent applications have been filed on inventions that assist in communicating with emoticons. A few of these have issued as US patents. U.S. patent 6987991, for example, discloses a method developed in 2001 to send emoticons over a cell phone using a drop down menu. The stated advantage over the prior art was that the user saved on the number of keystrokes though this may not address the obviousness criteria.\nIn Finland, the emoticons :-), =), =(, :) and :( were trademarked in 2006 for use with various products and services. The emoticon :-) was also filed in 2006 and registered in 2008 as a European Community Trademark (CTM).\nIn 2008, Russian entrepreneur Oleg Teterin claimed to have been granted the trademark on the ;-) emoticon. A license would not \"cost that much - tens of thousands of dollars\" for companies, but would be free of charge for individuals.\nIn 2010 in the United Kingdom, the British chocolate company Meltwater Chocolate filed a trademark application for a series of two marks :D and :-D in class 30, covering chocolate and confectionery."}

All maps are grouped, in the manner of a World atlas, into pages stored with the name \"Atlas of...\" for each continent, such as:\nSimilar page titles \"Atlas of...\" cover each nation or region, such as:\nSome of the U.S. states also have Wikiatlas pages, such as:\nSimilarly, hundreds of other Wikiatlas pages are named as \"Atlas of...\" for over 200 nations and over 94 other regions of the World.\nWikiatlas page format.\nMany pages in the Wikiatlas are arranged in a distinctive format: with maps displayed down the left-side of the page, and explanatory text presented to the right-hand side. The description for each nation, territory, or region is written, first, in the official language(s) of the area, followed by other languages, including English.\nBecause the Wikiatlas is a wiki effort, developed by the Wikimedia volunteers, the level of detail and coverage varies, from section to section, of the Wikiatlas. Some groups of maps are very extensive, while other maps are rudimentary, depending on the time spent by volunteer writers.\nHistory of Wikiatlas.\nThe Wikiatlas was designed, during extended discussions on the Wikimedia website, beginning in 2003.\nOriginally, the concept was to have an \"automatic\" map-generator, based on giving coordinates. However, use of maps beyond mere location, led to the current vast collections of maps also showing economic areas, precipitation, average-temperature, political regions, earthquake fault-lines, etc. To show a location was only one way to use maps.\nMany thousands of maps were collected, over the years. However, by June 2005, the Wikiatlas subproject still lacked sufficient structure to be considered viable.\nIn April 2006, the Wikiatlas was mentioned in an archaeology\nconference as a \"nascent\" project.\nFinally, a coherent page-format was generalized during mid-2007, using page layouts stored in MediaWiki template files. Hundreds of Wikimedia and Wikipedia editors worked on various aspects of the page descriptions in over 100 languages, including uploading and modifying the thousands of map images. Some of the maps were transferred from Wikipedia image pages.\nWikimedia readership.\nAlthough readership figures are not specifically available, of the complete grouping of all Wikiatlas pages, the general readership of the Wikimedia website has been based, nearly 50% (in early 2009), within the following: United States 24.5%, Germany 10.7%, India 5.7%, United Kingdom 4.0%, and Italy 3.5%."}

She is known for her strange style, funny voices, colorful wigs and costumes, and characters she uses in her music.\nCareer.\n2009\u201311: Beginnings and \"Pink Friday\".\nIn August 2009, Minaj signed to Young Money Entertainment with distribution from Universal Motown. Her debut album, \"Pink Friday\", was released on November 9, 2010. It climbed to number one on the US \"Billboard\" 200 album chart and contained the singles \"Your Love\", \"Moment 4 Life\" (featuring Canadian rapper Drake), \"Super Bass\", \"Did It on 'Em\", and \"Fly\" (featuring Barbadian singer Rihanna). The first, second, and fifth singles reached the top 20 in the US, while \"Super Bass\" managed to peak at number three on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and peaked in the top ten around the world. The song has been certified 8\u00d7 Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for combined shipments and streams of 8 million copies in the US alone. Minaj was also featured with Kesha on a remix of Britney Spears' song \"Till the World Ends\".\nNicki Minaj has been instrumental in challenging the patriarchal norms of the music industry, as a Black female rapper. Additionally, in Nicki Minaj's early career she used sexuality as a way to gain fans and relate to audiences. She was able to gather a large female and LGBT+ identifying audience through her implying that she was bisexual herself. Through her wigs, costumes, and bold designs she attracted fans from the LGBT+ community, who found themselves to be able to identify with her boldness and expressivity.\n2012\u201313: \"Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded\" and \"The Re-Up\".\nMinaj released a single, \"Starships\", on Valentine's Day of 2012, before releasing her second studio album, \"\", on April 3, 2012. This album contained more pop- and dance-leaning songs, with some songs produced by RedOne (known for working with Jennifer Lopez and Lady Gaga) and Dr. Luke. \"Starships\" reached number one in Scotland and the top five in the US, UK, and Canada. Minaj released two more singles from the album, \"Pound the Alarm\" and \"Va Va Voom\", which both reached the top 25 of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. She was featured on David Guetta's single \"Turn Me On\", which reached the top ten worldwide. Minaj re-released \"Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded\" later in the year as \"Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded \u2013 The Re-Up\" that contained songs like \"Va Va Voom\" and \"Freedom\".\nFrom 2012 to 2013, she was featured as a judge on the music competition series \"American Idol\" alongside Keith Urban, Mariah Carey, and Randy Jackson.\n2014\u201317: \"The Other Woman\", \"The Pinkprint\", and other projects.\nIn 2014, she was featured in the film \"The Other Woman\".

This theorem is named after Thomas Bayes ( or \"bays\") and is often called Bayes' law or Bayes' rule.\nFormula.\nThe equation used is:\nWhere:\nIn many scenarios, P(\"B\") is calculated indirectly using the formula formula_2, which simply states that the probability of \"B\" is the sum of the conditional probabilities based on whether \"A\" has occurred or not.\nExample.\nA simple example is as follows: There is a 40% chance of rain on Sunday. If it rains on Sunday, there is a 10% chance of rain on Monday. If it did not rain on Sunday, then there is an 80% chance that it will rain on Monday.\n\"Raining on Sunday\" is event A, and \"Raining on Monday\" is event B.\nThe first thing we would normally calculate is the probability of it raining on Monday:\nThis would be the sum of the probability of \"Rain on Sunday and rain on Monday\" and \"No rain on Sunday and rain on Monday\":\nHowever, we were asked to calculate the probability that it rained on Sunday, given that it rained on Monday, then this is where Bayes' theorem comes in. It allows us to calculate the probability of an earlier event, given the result of a later event.\nThe equation used is:\nIn our case, \"Rain on Sunday\" is event A, and \"Rain on Monday\" is event B.\nSo, to calculate the probability it rained on Sunday, given that it rained on Monday, we use the formula:\nor:\nIn other words, if it rained on Monday, then there is a 7.69% chance it rained on Sunday.\nIntuitive explanation.\nTo calculate the probability of it having rained on Sunday, given that it rained on Monday, we can take the following steps:\nTherefore,\nAnother way to see this, which shows where Bayes' theorem comes from, is to consider the probability P(AB) that it rains on both Sunday and Monday. This can be calculated in two different ways, which give the same answer for P(AB):\nIn this regard, Bayes' theorem is just another way to write that equation."}

{"id": "264241", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=264241", "title": "Typesetting", "text": "Typesetting is the making of block-printed writing which is formed by using types grouped from sorts.\nTypesetting uses the earlier steps of designing a font and storing it in some manner. Typesetting is the taking of the stored letters (called \"sorts\" in mechanical systems and \"glyphs\" in digital systems) and the ordering of them in the manner of a language's orthography for showing them on a page.\nLetterpress era.\nDuring the letterpress era, moveable type was composed by hand for each page. Cast metal \"sorts\" were grouped into words and lines of text and tightly bound together to make up a page image called a \"forme\". All letter faces were set to the same height, to form an even surface of type. The forme was mounted in a machine press, inked, and an impression made on paper.\nThe diagram at right shows a cast metal sort: a face, b body or shank, c point size, 1 shoulder, 2 nick, 3 groove, 4 foot. Wooden printing sorts were in use for centuries in combination with metal type. \nCopies of formes were cast when expecting later printings of a text, freeing the costly type for other work. In this process, called stereotyping, the entire forme is pressed into a fine matrix such as plaster of Paris or papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 called Flong to create a positive, from which the stereotype forme was cast of type metal. \nHand composing was rendered commercially obsolete by continuous casting or \"hot-metal\" typesetting machines, such as the Linotype machine and Monotype at the end of the 19th century. The Linotype, invented by Ottmar Mergenthaler, enabled one machine operator to do the work of ten hand compositors by automating the selection, use and replacement of sorts, with a keyboard as input. Later advances, such as the typewriter or computer, pushed the state of the art even farther ahead. Still, hand composition and letterpress printing did not fall completely out of use. Since the introduction of digital typesetting, it has seen a renewal as an artisanal pursuit. However, it is a very small niche within the larger typesetting market.\nPhototypesetting.\nPhototypesetting or \"cold type\" systems first appeared in the early 1960s and rapidly displaced continuous casting machines. These devices consisted of glass disks (one per font) that spun in front of a light source which selectively exposed characters onto light-sensitive paper. Originally they were driven by pre-punched paper tapes. Later they were hooked up to computer front ends.\nOne of the earliest electronic photocomposition systems was introduced by Fairchild Semiconductor. The typesetter typed a line of text on a Fairchild keyboard that had no display. To verify correct content of the line it was typed a second time. If the two lines were identical a bell rang and the machine produced a punched paper tape corresponding to the text. With the completion of a block of lines the typesetter fed the corresponding paper tapes into a phototypesetting device which mechanically set type outlines printed on glass sheets into place for exposure onto a negative film. Photosensitive paper was exposed to light through the negative film, resulting in a column of black type on white paper, or a galley. The galley was then cut up and used to create a mechanical drawing or paste up of a whole page. A large film negative of the page is shot and used to make a plates for offset printing.\nDigital era.\nBefore the 1980s, almost all typesetting for publishers and advertisers was done by specialist typesetting companies. These companies performed keyboarding, editing and production of paper or film output, and formed a large component of the graphic arts industry. In the United States, these companies were in rural Pennsylvania, New England or the Midwest where labor was cheap, and paper produced nearby, but still within a few hours' travel time of the major publishing centers.\nIn 1985, desktop publishing became available, starting with the Apple Macintosh, Aldus PageMaker (and later QuarkXPress) and PostScript. Improvements in software and hardware, and rapidly-lowering costs, popularized desktop publishing and enabled very fine control of typeset results at much lower cost than the minicomputer-based systems. At the same time, word processing systems such as Wang and WordPerfect revolutionized office documents. They did not, however, have the typographic ability or flexibility required for complex book layout, graphics, mathematics, or advanced hyphenation and justification rules (\"H and J\").\nBy the year 2000, this industry segment had shrunk because publishers were now capable of integrating typesetting and graphic design on their own in-house computers. Many found that the cost of maintaining high standards of typographic design and technical skill made it more economical to out-source to freelancers and graphic design specialists.\nThe availability of cheap, or free, fonts made the conversion to do-it-yourself easier but also opened up a gap between skilled designers and amateurs. The advent of PostScript, supplemented by the PDF file format, provided a universal method of proofing designs and layouts, readable on major computer and operating systems.\nSCRIPT variants.\nIBM created and inspired a family of typesetting languages with names that were derivatives of the word \"SCRIPT\". Latter versions of SCRIPT included advanced features such as automatic generation of a table of contents and index, multi-column page layout, footnotes, boxes, automatic hyphenation and spelling verification.\nSGML and XML systems.\nSGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) was based upon GML (IBM Generalized Markup Language). GML was a set of macros on top of IBM SCRIPT.\nThe arrival of SGML/XML as the document model made other typesetting engines popular. Such engines include Datalogics Pager, Penta, Miles 33's OASYS, Xyvision's XML Professional Publisher (XPP), FrameMaker, Arbortext, YesLogic's Prince, QuarkXPress and Adobe InDesign. These products allow users to program their typesetting process around the SGML/XML with the help of scripting languages. Some of them, such as Arbortext Editor and XMetaL Author, provide attractive WYSIWYG-ish interfaces with support for XML standards and Unicode to attract a wider spectrum of users.\nTroff and successors.\nDuring the mid-1970s Joseph Ossanna, working at Bell Laboratories, wrote the troff (said as \"tee-roff\") typesetting program to drive a Wang C/A/T phototypesetter owned by the Labs; it was later enhanced by Brian Kernighan to support output to different equipment such as laser printers and the like. While its use has fallen off, it is still included with a number of Unix and Unix-like systems and has been used to typeset a number of high-profile technical and computer books. Some versions, as well as a GNU work-alike called groff, are now open source.\nTeX and LaTeX.\nThe TeX system, developed by Donald E. Knuth at the end of the 1970s, is another widespread and powerful automated typesetting system which has set high standards, especially for typesetting mathematics. "}

It was a period of optimism and hedonism, and a cultural revolution. One catalyst was the recovery of the British economy after post-World War II hard times had lasted through much of the 1950s. Journalist Christopher Booker, a founder of the satirical magazine \"Private Eye\", recalled the \"bewitching\" character of the swinging sixties: \"There seemed to be no one standing outside the bubble, and observing just how odd and shallow and egocentric and even rather horrible it was\".\n\"Swinging London\" was defined by \"Time\" magazine in its issue of 15 April 1966, and celebrated in the name of the pirate radio station, \"Swinging Radio England\", that began shortly afterward. However, \"swinging\" in the sense of hip or fashionable, had been used since the early 1960s. In 1965, Diana Vreeland, editor of \"Vogue\" magazine, said \"London is the most swinging city in the world at the moment\".\nAlthough \"The Beatles\" came from Liverpool, \"The Rolling Stones\", and the rest of the new culture was London-based. Most of the new fashion designers, models and photographers were young, and packed into a small area in Soho around Carnaby Street, W1., and another area round the King's Road, Chelsea.\nFashion &amp; symbols.\nDuring the time of Swinging London, fashion and photography were featured in \"Queen\" magazine, which drew attention to fashion designer Mary Quant.\nThe model Jean Shrimpton was another icon and one of the world's first supermodels. She was the world's highest paid and most photographed model of the time. Shrimpton was called \"The face of the '60s\", in which she has been considered by many as \"the symbol of Swinging London\", and the \"embodiment of the 1960s\". Other popular models of the era included Veruschka, and Twiggy. Twiggy was called \"the Queen of Mod\", a label she shared with others, such as Cathy McGowan, who hosted the television rock show, \"Ready Steady Go!\" from 1964 to 1966.\nMod-related fashions such as the miniskirt stimulated fashionable shopping areas such as Carnaby Street and the Kings Road, Chelsea. The fashion was a symbol of youth culture.\nThe British flag, the Union Flag, became a symbol, assisted by events such as England's home victory in the 1966 World Cup. The Mini car (launched in 1959) was used by a fleet of mini-cab taxis highlighted by advertising which covered their paintwork."}

It was first performed in Rome on January 14, 1900. The libretto was written by Giuseppe Giacosa and Luigi Illica. It was based on Victorien Sardou's play \"La Tosca\". \"Tosca\" was a great success.\nPlot.\nSetting.\nThe story happens in Rome in the year 1800. Some years before, Rome was ruled by the pope. But Napoleon invaded Rome and made it a republic. This republic was ruled by seven men called \"consuls\". But Napoleon had problems with Austria and the French had to leave, so Rome was conquered by people from Naples. Because of that, the new government decided to arrest people from the previous government. In 1800 Napoleon decided to return to Rome because he had just defeated the Austrian army in the north. The battle they fought was called the \"Battle of Marengo\".\nAct 1.\nOn the 17th of June, 1800, Scarpia, general of the secret police, is sending republicans to prison. One of the republicans, Angelotti, flees prison and gets inside the church of Sant' Andrea della Valle. Angelotti used to be one of the consuls. In this church, he meets another republican called Cavaradossi. Cavaradossi hides Angelotti in a secret place.\nLater, Scarpia enters the church. Scarpia can\u2019t find Angelotti, but meets a woman called Tosca there. She is the singer, and Cavaradossi's lover. Scarpia tricks Tosca into going to Cavaradossi\u2019s house, and has his soldiers follow her.\nAct 2.\nScarpia hears that his soldiers can\u2019t find Angelotti, but have arrested Cavaradossi. Scarpia then tortures Cavaradossi, but Cavaradossi doesn\u2019t confess where Angelotti is. So Scarpia calls Tosca, and shows her her lover\u2019s tortured state. Tosca tells him where is the secret place Angelotti was hidden.\nThen, a message comes saying that Napoleon has won the Battle of Marengo. Cavaradossi is happy, because there will be a new republican government. Scarpia is furious and condemns Cavaradossi to death.\nTosca begs Scarpia to save her lover's life. Scarpia demands that Tosca gives herself to him in exchange. As Scarpia goes to touch Tosca, she stabs him to death with a knife from the table.\nAct 3.\nTosca runs to Cavaradossi in the prison at the castle Sant'Angelo. But, the firing squad shoot Cavaradossi. When Scarpia\u2019s soldiers try to arrest Tosca for Scarpia's murder, she kills herself by jumping from the castle."}

{"id": "264285", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=264285", "title": "Kakadu National Park", "text": "Kakadu National Park is in the Northern Territory of Australia, 171\u00a0km southeast of Darwin. It is the second largest national park in the world. It covers an area of . It is about 200\u00a0kilometres from north to south, and more than 100\u00a0kilometres from east to west. It is the size of Slovenia, about one-third the size of Tasmania, or nearly half the size of Switzerland. The Ranger Uranium Mine, one of the biggest Uranium mines in the world, is inside the park.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe name Kakadu comes from \"Gagadju\", the name of an Aboriginal language spoken in the northern part of the Park. Kakadu National Park has many different ecological areas, and many different plant and animal species. The main natural features protected within the National Park include:\nKakadu National Park is famous for the richness of its Aboriginal cultural sites. There are more than 5000 recorded art sites showing Aboriginal culture over thousands of years. The archaeological sites show that Aboriginals have lived here for at least 20 000 and possibly up to 40 000 years.\nThe cultural and natural values of Kakadu National Park were recognised internationally when the Park was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This is an international list of places that are have outstanding cultural or natural values of international significance. Kakadu was listed in three stages: Stage 1 in 1981, Stage 2 in 1987, and the entire Park in 1992.\nAbout half of the land in Kakadu is aboriginal land under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. Most of the remaining land is currently under claim by Aboriginal people. The areas of the Park that are owned by Aboriginal people are leased by the traditional owners to the Director of National Parks to be managed as a national park. The remaining area is Australian Government land controlled by the Director of National Parks. All of Kakadu is declared a national park under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.\nThe Aboriginal traditional owners of the Park are descendants of various clan groups from the Kakadu area. Their lifestyle has changed in recent years, but their traditional customs and beliefs remain very important. About 500 Aboriginal people live in the Park; many of them are traditional owners. All of Kakadu is jointly managed by Aboriginal traditional owners and the Australian Government\u2019s Department of the Environment and Water Resources through a division known as Parks Australia. Park Management is directed by the Kakadu Board of Management.\nEstablishment.\nKakadu was set up at a time when Australians were becoming more interested in national parks for conservation and in recognising the land rights of Aboriginal people. A national park in the Alligator River region was proposed as early as 1965. In 1978 the Australian Government took over the titles of various pieces of land that now makes up Kakadu National Park.\nKakadu National Park was made a park in three stages between 1979 and 1991. Each stage of the Park includes Aboriginal land under the Land Rights Act that is leased to the Director of National Parks or land that is subject to a claim to traditional ownership under the Land Rights Act. Most of the land that was to become part of Stage One of Kakadu was given to the Kakadu Aboriginal Land Trust under the Land Rights Act in August 1978. In November 1978, the Land Trust and the Director signed a lease for the land to be managed as a national park. Stage One of the Park was declared on 5 April 1979.\nStage Two was declared on 28 February 1984. In March 1978, a claim was lodged under the Land Rights Act for the land included in Stage Two of Kakadu. The land claim was partly successful. In 1986, three areas in the eastern part of Stage Two were given to the Jabiluka Aboriginal Land Trust. A lease between the Land Trust and the Director of National parks was signed in March 1991.\nIn 1987, a land claim was made for the land in the Goodparla and Gimbat pastoral leases that were to be included in Stage Three of Kakadu. The other area to be included in Stage Three, the Gimbat Resumption and the Waterfall Creek Reserve, were later added to this land claim. The need to create the park in stages was due to the debate over whether mining should be allowed at Guratba (Coronation Hill) which is located in the middle of the area referred to as Sickness Country. The traditional owners\u2019 wishes were ultimately respected and the Australian National Government decided that there would be no mining at Guratba.\nIn 1996, the land in Stage Three, apart from the former Goodparla pastoral leases, was given to the Gunlom Aboriginal Land Trust and leased to the Director of National Parks to continue being managed as part of Kakadu.\nThe arrival of non Aboriginal people.\nExplorers.\nThe Chinese, Malays and Portuguese all claim to have been the first non-Aboriginal explorers of Australia\u2019s north coast. The first surviving written account comes from the Dutch. In 1623 Jan Carstenz made his way west across the Gulf of Carpentaria to what is believed to be Groote Eylandt. Abel Tasman was the next explorer to visit in 1644. He was the first person to record European contact with Aboriginal people. Almost a century later Matthew Flinders surveyed the Gulf of Carpentaria in 1802 and 1803.\nPhillip Parker King, an English navigator entered the Gulf of Carpentaria between 1818 and 1822. During this time he named the three Alligator Rivers after the large numbers of crocodiles, which he thought were alligators.\nLudwig Leichhardt was the first land-based European explorer to visit the Kakadu region, in 1845 on his way from Moreton Bay in Queensland to Port Essington in the Northern Territory. He followed Jim Jim Creek down from the Arnhem Land escarpment, then went down the South Alligator before crossing to the East Alligator and going north.\nIn 1862 John McDouall Stuart travelled along the south-western boundary of Kakadu but did not see any people.\nThe first non-Aboriginal people to visit and have long term contact with Aboriginal people in northern Australia were the Macassans from Sulawesi and other parts of Indonesia. They travelled to northern Australia every wet season, probably from the last quarter of the 17th century, in sailing boats called praus. They came to harvest trepang (sea cucumber), turtle shell, pearls and other prized items to trade in their homeland. Aboriginal people helped in harvesting and processing the trepang, and in collecting and exchanging the other goods.\nThere is no evidence that the Macassans spent time on the coast of Kakadu. There is evidence of some contact between Macassan culture and Aboriginal people of the Kakadu area. Among the finds from archaeological digs in the Park are glass and metal pieces that probably came from the Macassans, either directly or through trade with the Coburg Peninsula people.\nThe British attempted a number of settlements on the northern Australian coast in the\nearly part of the 19th century: Fort Dundas on Melville Island in 1824; Fort Wellington at Raffles Bay in 1829; and Victoria Settlement (Port Essington) on the Coburg Peninsula in 1838. They wanted to secure the north of Australia before the French or Dutch, who had colonised islands further north. The British settlements all failed for a variety of reasons, such as lack of water and fresh food, sickness and isolation.\nIt is difficult to assess the impact of these settlements on the local Aboriginal people and the type of relationship that developed between them and the British. Certainly, some Aboriginals worked at the settlements. Exposure to new sickness was an ever-present danger. As in other parts of Australia, disease and the disruption it caused to society devastated the local Aboriginal population.\nBuffalo hunters.\nWater buffalo have had a big influence on the Kakadu region as well. By the 1880s the number of buffaloes escaped from early settlements had grown so much that hunting them for skins and horns was economically successful.\nThe industry began on the Adelaide River, close to Darwin, and moved east to the Mary River and Alligator Rivers regions.\nMost of the buffalo hunting and skin curing was done in the dry season, between June and September, when buffaloes gathered around the remaining billabongs. During the wet season hunting stopped because the ground was too muddy to follow the buffalo and the harvested hides would rot. The buffalo hunting industry became an important employer of Aboriginal people during the dry-season months.\nMissionaries.\nMissionaries had a big influence on the Aboriginal people of the Alligator Rivers area. Many of the people lived and went to school at missions. Two missions were set up in the region in the early part of the century. Kapalga Native Industrial Mission was started near the South Alligator River in 1899, but lasted only four years. The Oenpelli Mission began in 1925, when the Church of England Missionary Society accepted an offer from the Northern Territory Administration to take over the area, which had been used as a dairy farm. The Oenpelli Mission operated for 50 years.\nSome writers and anthropologists say that missionaries, in trying to \u2018civilise and institutionalise\u2019 Aboriginal people, forced them to give up their lifestyle, language, religion, ceremonies and change the whole way they lived. Others say that, although they might not have used the best methods to achieve their goal, the missionaries did care about the Aboriginal people at a time when wider Australian society did not.\nPastoralists.\nThe pastoral industry made started slowly in the Top End. Pastoral leases in the Kakadu area were progressively given up from 1889, because the Victoria River and the Barkly Tablelands were better pastoral regions.\nIn southern Kakadu much of Goodparla and Gimbat was claimed in the mid-1870s by three pastoralists, Roderick, Travers and Sergison. The leases were later passed on to a series of owners, who were all unsuccessful. In 1987 both stations were taken back by the Commonwealth and added to Kakadu National Park.\nThere was a sawmill at Nourlangie Camp, begun by Chinese workers, probably before World War I, to cut stands of cypress pine in the area. After World War II there were a number of small-scale activities, including dingo shooting and trapping, brumby shooting, crocodile shooting, tourism and forestry.\nNourlangie Camp was again the site of a sawmill in the 1950s, until the cypress pines were cleared. In 1958 it became a safari camp for tourists. Soon after, a similar camp was started at Patonga and at Muirella Park. People were flown in to hunt buffalo, crocodiles and fishing.\nCrocodile hunters often made use of the bush skills of Aboriginal people. By copying a wallaby\u2019s tail hitting the ground, Aboriginal hunters could attract crocodiles, making it easier to shoot the animals. Using paperbark rafts, they would track the movement of a wounded crocodile and get the carcass for skinning. The skins were then sold to make leather goods. Aboriginal people became less involved in commercial hunting of crocodiles once night spotlight shooting started. Freshwater Crocodiles have been protected by law since 1964 and Saltwater Crocodiles since 1971.\nMining.\nMinerals were found in the Top End during the building of the Australian Overland Telegraph Line line between 1870 and 1872, in the Pine Creek \u2013 Adelaide River area. A number of short mining booms followed.\nThe building of the North Australia Railway line helped the mining camps, and places such as Burrundie and Pine Creek became permanent settlements. The mining camps and new settlements drew many Aboriginal people away from Kakadu. No Aboriginal people are known to have worked in the mines but their access to alcohol and other drugs had a huge impact.\nSmall-scale gold mining began at Imarlkba, near Barramundi Creek, and Mundogie Hill in the 1920s and at Moline (previously called Eureka and Northern Hercules mine), south of the Park, in the 1930s. The mines employed a few local Aboriginal people.\nIn 1953 uranium was discovered in the South Alligator River valley. Thirteen small but rich uranium mines operated in the following decade, at their peak in 1957 employing over 150 workers. No Aboriginal people were employed at any of these mines.\nEarly in the 1970s large uranium deposits were discovered at Ranger, Jabiluka and Koongarra. The Australian Government began an inquiry into land use in the Alligator Rivers region. The Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry (known as the Fox inquiry) recommended that mining begin at the Ranger site. It also said that Jabiluka and Koongarra sites should be developed, and that a town be built to support the mines.(Fox et al. 1976, 1977). The Ranger mine and the service town at Jabiru have had many impacts on Aboriginal people. Aboriginal people have different opinions about mining.\nClimate.\nKakadu is in the tropics, between 12\u00b0 and 14\u00b0 south of the Equator. The climate is monsoonal,\nwith two main seasons: the dry season and the rain season. The 'build up' describes the change between the dry and the rain. During the dry season (from April/May to September), there are dry southerly and easterly trade winds. Humidity is relatively low and rain is unusual. At Jabiru, the average maximum temperature for June-July is 32\u00a0\u00b0C. During the 'build up' (October to December) conditions can be extremely uncomfortable with high temperatures and high humidity. However, 'build up' storms are impressive and with many lightning strikes. At Jabiru the average maximum temperature for October is 37.5\u00a0\u00b0C.\nThe rain season (January to March/April) has warm temperatures and rain. Most of the rain is caused by monsoonal troughs formed over Southeast Asia. Sometimes tropical cyclones cause very heavy rain over small areas. At Jabiru, the average maximum temperature for January is 33\u00a0\u00b0C. Annual rainfall in Kakadu National Park ranges from 1,565\u00a0mm in Jabiru to 1,300\u00a0mm in the Mary River region.\nThe Aboriginal people, the Bininj/Mungguy, named as many as six seasons in the Kakadu region:\nPeriods of torrential rain and long dry spells mean that Kakadu can change its appearance according to the season, so is a place deserving of more than one visit.\nFlora.\nKakadu has more than 2000 plant species, because of the different geological areas, landforms and habitats. Kakadu is also said to be one of the most weed free national parks in the world.\nThe different geographical areas of Kakadu have their own specialised plants. The area called \u2018the Stone Country\u2019 has \u2018resurrection grasses\u2019 that are able to survive extreme heat, and dry conditions followed by periods of heavy rain. Monsoon forests often develop in the cool moist gorges found in the stone country. The southern hills and basins support several endemic plants that are only found in Kakadu such as \"Eucalyptus koolpinensis\" near Jarrangbarnmi (Koolpin Gorge). Lowland areas form a large proportion of Kakadu National Park and are mainly covered in eucalypt-dominated open woodland with the ground layer consisting of a large range of grasses including spear grass, sedges and wildflowers.\nThe floodplains, which are flooded for several months each year, feature sedges such as spike rush as well patches of freshwater mangroves (itchy tree), pandanus and paper bark trees (Melaleuca). Varieties of water lilies, such as the blue, yellow and white snowflake, are commonly found in these areas. Estuaries and tidal flats are populated with varieties of mangroves, in fact 39 of the 47 Northern Territory species of mangrove are found in Kakadu. These are important for preventing erosion of the coast. Mangroves serve as feeding and breeding grounds for many fish species including the barramundi.\nOn the tidal flats behind the mangroves, hardy succulents (samphire), grasses and sedges grow. Isolated pockets of monsoon forest grow along the coast and river banks. These forests contain several impressive trees, among them the banyan fig, which can be recognised by its large, spreading aerial roots, and the kapok tree, which has a spiny trunk, large, waxy red flowers and pods full of cotton-like material.\nFauna.\nThe different areas of Kakadu National Park support a huge number of animals, a number of which have adapted to particular habitats. Some animals in the Park are rare, endangered, vulnerable or endemic. Because of the extreme weather conditions experienced in the Park, many animals are active only at particular times of the day or night or at particular times of the year.\nAbout 62 mammal species have been seen in the Park. Most of them live in the open forest and woodlands and are nocturnal, making it difficult to see them. Others, such as wallabies and kangaroos are active in the cooler parts of the day and are easier to see. The larger mammals are Dingos, Antilopine Kangaroos, Black Wallaroos, Agile Wallabys, and Short-eared Rock Wallabys. Smaller common mammals are northern quolls, brush-tailed phascogales, brown bandicoots, black-footed tree-rats, and black fruit bats. Dugongs are found in the coastal waters. However, recent surveys have shown smaller numbers of nearly all mammals throughout Kakadu. This includes once common and widespread species such as northern quolls.\nKakadu\u2019s many habitats support more than 280 species of birds. This is about one-third of Australia\u2019s bird species. Some birds range over a number of habitats, but many are found in only one environment.\nTo date, 123 species of reptiles have been found in Kakadu. Being cold blooded, these animals need heat from an external source such as the sun to control their body temperature. This is not to say that reptiles are active only during the day; in fact, few snakes can withstand Kakadu\u2019s midday heat and most are active at night.\nTwo species of crocodile live in Kakadu: the Freshwater Crocodile (\"Crocodylus johnstonii\") and the Estuarine, or Saltwater Crocodile (\"C. porosus\"). Freshwater Crocodiles have a narrow snout and a single row of four large boney lumps called \u2018scutes\u2019 immediately behind the head. Estuarine Crocodiles do not have these scutes and their snout is broader. The maximum size for a \u2018freshie\u2019 is 3\u00a0metres, whereas a \u2018saltie\u2019 can exceed 6\u00a0metres.\nKakadu\u2019s 25 frog species are extremely well adapted to the region\u2019s climatic extremes. Many remain dormant during dry times. At the start of the wet season, when the billabongs and swamps start to fill with water, the night air is filled with the sounds of frogs such as the northern bullfrog and the marbled frog. As the water builds up, frogs and tadpoles have plenty of food, such as algae, vegetation, insects, dragonfly nymphs, and other tadpoles. Not all of Kakadu\u2019s frogs are found in the wetlands: many live in the lowland forests.\nFifty-one species of freshwater fish have been found in Kakadu\u2019s waterways; eight of them have a restricted distribution. In the Magela Creek system alone, 32 species have been found. In comparison, the Murray\u2013Darling river system, the most extensive in Australia, now supports only 27 native fish species. Although introduced fish have been found in most Australian waterways, none have been recorded in the Park.\nKakadu supports more than 10,000 species of insect including grasshoppers, beetles, flies, termites, butterflies and moths, bees, wasps, ants, dragonflies and damselflies, caddis flies, non-biting midges and mayflies. The great variety of insects is a result of the varied habitats and relatively high temperatures throughout the year.\nPerhaps the most striking insect-created features in the Park are the termite mounds. The mounds in the southern part of the Park are particularly large and impressive. Leichhardt\u2019s grasshopper, in colours of orange, blue and black, is perhaps the most spectacular insect found in Kakadu. It is also found on the Arnhem Land plateau and in Gregory National Park.\nEnvironmental issues and threats.\nKakadu has seen several invasive species threaten the native habitat, particularly in recent decades. Introduced fauna including the Water Buffalo, wild pig and more recently, the Cane Toad have had major effects on habitat. Invasive weeds include \"Mimosa pigra\", which covers 800\u00a0km\u00b2 of the Top End, including vast areas of Kakadu, invasive paragrass displaces the native food of much of Kakadu's birdlife. \"Salvinia molesta\" has infested the Magela floodplain. Brumbies also inhabit areas of the National Park, including Yellow Water.\nLandforms.\nThere are six main landforms in Kakadu National Park:\nEach landform has its own range of habitats. Kakadu\u2019s varied landscapes and the habitats they contain are features that contributed to its listing as a World Heritage Area.\nMost of Kakadu was under a shallow sea about 140 million years ago, with the escarpment wall formed from sea cliffs and Arnhem Land from a flat plateau above the sea. Currently the escarpment rises 330\u00a0metres above the plateau and stretches 500\u00a0kilometres along the East edge of the park and on into Arnhem Land. The escarpment varies from near vertical cliffs in the Jim Jim Falls area to isolated outliers and stepped cliffs in the North.\nChasms and gorges form a network that cut through the rocky platforms on the plateau. The plateau top is a harsh, dry environment where water drains away quickly and top soil is scarce in most areas. Sparse pockets of open forest and woodlands have developed in these areas. However creeks have carved deep gorges in the escarpment in which tall monsoon forests grow. These areas form microclimates for plants and animals and often serve as a refuge during the dry season. Allosyncarpia ternata, a large shady tree found only in the Kakadu and Arnhem Land, is the main plant species.\nThe outliers are pieces of the Arnhem Land plateau that have become separated from the plateau by erosion. They were islands in the ancient seas that once covered much of Kakadu. The lowland plains stretch over much of the Top End and they make up nearly 70% of the Park. The soils are shallow and often are above large sheets of laterite (ironstone) and a thick profile of strongly leached rocks.\nDuring the wet season, water carried down from the Arnhem Land plateau often overflows from creeks and rivers onto nearby floodplains. Alluvial soils carried in the floodwaters add nutrients to the floodplains. Nutrient-rich soils along with an abundance of water and sunlight make the floodplains an area of prolific plant and animal life. During the dry season the water drains into rivers, creeks and isolated waterholes or billabongs. Kakadu\u2019s wetlands are listed under the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance (the Ramsar Convention) for their outstanding ecological, botanical, zoological and hydrological features.\nThe southern hills and basins cover a large area in the south of the Park, including the headwaters of the South Alligator River. Rocks here have been exposed from beneath the retreating Arnhem escarpment; they are of volcanic origin and are extremely old (2500 million years). This landform is characterised by rugged strike ridges separated by alluvial flats.\nKakadu\u2019s coast and the creeks and river systems under tidal influence (extending about 100\u00a0kilometres inland) make up this landform. The shape of the estuaries and tidal flats varies considerably from the dry season to the wet season. During the dry season tidal action deposits silt along the river beds and banks. During the wet season the river beds are eroded by the floodwaters and large quantities of fresh and saline water flow out across the tidal flats, where silt is deposited. Large silt loads are also carried out to sea, some of the silt being deposited as a nutrient rich layer on the sea floor, contributing to the muddy waters that characterise Kakadu\u2019s coastline.\nThe estuaries and tidal flats are home to many plants and animals adapted to living in the oxygen-deficient saline mud. The dominant habitats are mangrove swamps and samphire flats. Where freshwater springs occur along the coasts and river banks, isolated pockets of coastal monsoon rainforests form.\nAboriginal rock art sites.\nThe art sites of Ubirr, Nourlangie Rock and Nanguluwur are world famous as examples of Aboriginal rock art. These sites are found among the rocks that have given shelter to the Aborigines for thousands of years. The painting in these rock shelters were done for different reasons:\nUbirr is a group of rock outcrops in the northest of the Park, on the edge of the Nadab floodplain. There are several large rock overhangs that would have provided excellent shelter to Aboriginal people over thousands of years. Because it is close to the East Alligator River and Nadab floodplains, it means that there would have been plenty of food. This is shown in much of the rock art here. Animals shown in the main gallery include barramundi, catfish, mullet, goanna, snake-necked turtle, pig-nosed turtle, Rock-haunting Ringtail Possum, and wallaby and thylacine (Tasmanian Tiger).\nThere are also images of the Rainbow Serpent said to have created much of the landscape as well as mischievous Mimi spirits and the story of the Namarrgarn Sisters. Many stories connected to Aboriginal rock are highly complex and linked to other stories. Often the true meanings have been lost, but they all have a purpose which is usually to serve as a lesson or a warning to the young or to those passing through the area.\nNourlangie is located in an outlying formation of the Arnhem Land Escarpment. There are a number of shelters in this large outcrop linked by paths and stairways. The shelters contain several impressive paintings that deal with the Dreamtime. The stories connected to these artworks are known only to certain Aboriginal people and remain secret.\nAnbangbang Billabong lies in the shadow of Nourlangie Rock and is home to a wide range of wildlife which would have sustained traditional Aboriginal people well.\nNanguluwur, a small art site near Nourlangie, has several rock art styles. These include hand stencils, dynamic figures in large head-dresses carrying spears and boomerangs, Namandi spirits and mythical figures, including Alkajko, a female spirit with four arms and horns. There is also an interesting example of \u2018contact art\u2019 showing a two-masted sailing ship with anchor chain and a dinghy trailing behind.\nHuman impacts.\nHumans have made major changes in the area during the 19th and 20th century. Introduction of water buffalo from Southeast Asia caused damage to the fragile floodplains and wetlands. Since then, buffalo have largely been removed from the area so the land is now recovering. Crocodile hunting which has been banned since 1972 made a huge impact on crocodile numbers. Since they have been protected, the crocodiles have recovered so successfully that some think there are now too many.\nMining has made changes to the landscape, but only one uranium mine (Ranger) remains. Mine operators are have to repair and replant the area when the mine closes. Some small scale logging took place in the early part of the 20th century, but little evidence of this remains. Tourism causes big changes to Kakadu National Park with hundreds of thousands of visitors arriving annually. Roads, tracks, signs, shelter, accommodation, telecommunications and other services must be provided to support this activity.\nFire management.\nFire is part of the landscape of Kakadu National Park. The Park has large areas of woodland and grassy plains that are subject to long periods of dry hot weather. The flora of the region has adapted to frequent fires. Fires in northern Australia are less threatening than in southern Australia as many of the trees are largely fire resistant while other plants simply grow back very quickly.\nControlled burning is practiced by the national park in consultation with traditional owners who have used fire as a land management tool for thousands of years. Fire is an important hunting tool for Aboriginal people using it to flush out prey. The other benefit is that once the fire has gone through an area the tender shoots of the fast regenerating grasses attract wallabies into a clearly defined area. Birds of prey such as Whistling Kites also rely on fire to flush out small animals and are usually found in large numbers circling a fire front. Other species such as white-throated grasswrens have declined because of too many fires. Aboriginal people understand that fire is necessary to \u2018clean up\u2019 the landscape and believe that many small fires are preferable to one large fire.\nTourism.\nKakadu National Park is a major tourist attraction in Australia\u2019s north with more than 200,000 visitors a year. Kakadu\u2019s dramatic landscape, Aboriginal cultural significance and diverse and abundant wildlife are what visitors come to see. There are many beautiful waterfalls and gorges within the Park that are popular with visitors such as Maguk, Gunlom, Twin Falls and Jim Jim Falls.\nKakadu National Park has some of the best examples of Aboriginal rock art in Australia. The sites of Nourlangie and Ubirr are among the most visited locations in the Park. It is possible to view some of Kakadu\u2019s diverse wildlife at places like Yellow Water Billabong, Cooinda on board a wildlife cruise or at Mamukala Wetlands or Anbangbang Billabong. The Kakadu region is one of the world\u2019s best for bird watching as about 30% of Australia\u2019s bird species can be seen here.\nLarge saltwater crocodiles are also common at Yellow Water and the East Alligator River. The Crocodile Dundee movies were made here. Visitors need to be careful around crocodiles as they have been responsible for a number of fatal attacks. Fishing is a popular activity inside Kakadu National Park. The main species is Barramundi and the most popular locations are Yellow Water, the South Alligator and the East Alligator River. Hunting is not allowed in Kakadu National Park.\nThere are several places to stay in the Park, mostly found in the town of Jabiru, as well as a range of services to cater to visitor\u2019s needs. Visitors can experience Kakadu National Park with a recognised tour operator or they can drive themselves. Many of the Park\u2019s sites are can be reached by standard two wheel drive vehicles, but areas like Twin and Jim Jim Falls and Gunlom require four wheel drive vehicles. Visitors can experience Kakadu National Park via the Nature\u2019s Way tourism drive which is a loop from Darwin to Jabiru then onto Katherine and back to Darwin covering about 900\u00a0km.\nPark management.\nThe Park is proclaimed under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (the EPBC Act) and is managed through a joint management arrangement between the Aboriginal traditional owners and the Director of National Parks. The Director manages Commonwealth national parks through Parks Australia, which is a part of the Department of the Environment and Water Resources. Title to Aboriginal land in the Park is held by Aboriginal land trusts. The land trusts have leased their land to the Director of National Parks for the purpose of a national park for the enjoyment and benefit of all Australians and international visitors. Traditional owners have also expected that having their land managed as a national park would assist them in looking after their land in the face of growing and competing pressures. They saw a national park as establishing a way to manage the land that could protect their interests and be sympathetic to their aspirations. Parks Australia and the Aboriginal traditional owners of Kakadu are committed to the principle of joint management of the Park and arrangements to help this happen are highlighted in Kakadu\u2019s Plan of Management.\nThe EPBC Act provides for boards of management to be established for parks on Aboriginal land. The Kakadu Board of Management, which has an Aboriginal majority (ten out of fifteen members), representing the Aboriginal traditional owners of land in the Park, was established in 1989. The Board determines policy for managing the Park and is responsible, along with the Director, for preparing plans of management for the Park. The Plan of Management is the main policy document for the Park and strives to balance strategic or long-term goals and tactical or day to day goals.\nDay to day management of Kakadu is carried out by people employed by Parks Australia, which is a branch of the Australian Government\u2019s Department of the Environment and Water Resources. Approximately one-third of the staff in Kakadu are Aboriginal people.\nPark use fee.\nKakadu National Park brought in an entry fee in April 2010. Money raised will help manage the natural and cultural values of the park environment and improve visitor services.\nLike many World Heritage sites around the world, including Yellowstone National Park, Serengeti National Park, Stonehenge, Pompeii and Herculaneum and the Pyramids of Giza - a park use fee will help maintain world-best management practices and facilities for the more than 200,000 visitors who experience Kakadu each year.\nThe $25 fee will apply to all interstate and international visitors aged 16 years and over. It can be used for 14 days. All Northern Territory residents and children under 16 have free entry.\nGeneral facilities.\nKakadu National Park is linked to Darwin by the Arnhem Highway and to Pine Creek and Katherine by the Kakadu Highway. Both roads are sealed all weather roads although may be cut off periodically during periods of heavy rain.\nThe town of Jabiru has several accommodation options, a service station, police, a medical clinic and a shopping centre with a range of outlets. The town was built for the Uranium mine that was established prior to the founding of Kakadu National Park and provides infrastructure for the mine\u2019s workforce as well as the national park activities and tourism. Jabiru has a small airport from which scenic flights operate daily. There are no scheduled air services between Jabiru and Darwin however.\nOther small tourism centres such as Cooinda and South Alligator provide limited facilities. Cooinda, 50\u00a0km south of Jabiru on the Kakadu Highway is the site of Gagudju Lodge Cooinda, Yellow Water Cruises and the Warradjan Cultural Centre. Fuel and limited provisions are available at Cooinda and there is also a small airstrip for scenic flights. South Alligator approximately 40\u00a0km west of Jabiru on the Arnhem Highway includes a hotel and service station. The Border Store near Ubirr Art Site and Cahills Crossing, 50\u00a0km north of Jabiru, is a general store.\nCamp sites.\nThere are a wide variety of designated camping sites throughout the Park. Jabiru, Cooinda and South Alligator all have commercial camping areas and are close to most of the important natural attractions in these areas. Some of the Park\u2019s campsites charge a nominal fee as these have shower and toilet facilities, others are free, however they have limited or no facilities. A list of the sites can be obtained from the Kakadu National Park\u2019s Glenn Murcutt-designed Bowali Visitor Centre or from their website."}

For 1989, it was planned to move the Grand Prix to a new circuit at Belle Isle. However, an agreement could not be reached, and the Grand Prix moved to Phoenix in 1989. Upon the departure of F1, the Detroit race was replaced by an event sanctioned by CART, which was held on the same track except the 18th turn, a chicane, was removed. In 1992, the race was moved to Belle Isle, an island in the Detroit River. Since then, the race has been held at Belle Isle. It was canceled after the 2001 race before being held in 2007 and 2008.

Its chemical formula is CuSO4. It contains copper in its +2 oxidation state. It also contains sulfate ions. It is a blue solid that can kill fungi. It is also used to purify copper metal. It is common in chemistry sets and chemistry demonstrations, and practical lessons at high school.\nProperties.\nPhysical properties.\nCopper(II) sulfate is a blue solid when hydrated (attached to water molecules). It is whitish when anhydrous (not attached to water molecules). When hydrated, it normally has five water molecules attached to it. It can be dehydrated by heating it. When water is added to it, it gets hydrated again. When it is in air, it absorbs water vapor and becomes hydrated, too.\nChemical properties.\nIt is a weak oxidizing agent. It reacts with most metals to make copper and a metal sulfate. For example, it reacts with iron to make copper and iron(II) sulfate. \nIt reacts with sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide to make copper(II) hydroxide. \nIt reacts with sodium carbonate to make copper(II) carbonate.\nIt reacts with ammonia to make a dark blue solution. This solution can dissolve fibers in cotton. \nWhen it is heated to a high temperature, it turns into copper(II) oxide and sulfur trioxide.\nIt makes a blue-green color when it is heated in a flame, like all copper compounds.\nOccurrence.\nCopper(II) sulfate is found in the ground as chalcanthite. Chalcanthite is easily dissolved. It is only found in dry areas. When it is in air, it loses its bright blue color. Some minerals are tested by taste. Chalcanthite has a sweet metal taste. It should only be tasted carefully, as it is poisonous. Its Mohs hardness is 2.5. It is the pentahydrate of copper sulfate. It is blue or green. Many people collecting minerals want it.\nPreparation.\nCopper sulfate is not normally made in a small laboratory, because it is much easier just to buy it. There are some ways to make copper sulfate, however.\nCopper(II) sulfate can be made by electrolysis of a solution of sulfuric acid with copper electrodes. Hydrogen is made, as well as copper sulfate solution. \nIt can also be made by reacting copper(II) oxide or copper(II) hydroxide or copper(II) carbonate with sulfuric acid or by adding copper to heated concentrated sulphuric acid: \nIt can also be made by reacting copper with a mixture of nitric acid and sulfuric acid.\nUses.\nCopper(II) sulfate, as the most common copper compound, has many uses. It can be used to kill algae and fungi. Some fungi can get resistant to copper sulfate, though. Then the copper sulfate does not kill them any more. It can be mixed with lime to make a similar fungi killer. It can be used to treat aquarium fish for infections. It is also used to detect sugars. It turns into red copper(I) oxide when reduced by a sugar. It can be used in organic chemistry as a catalyst and oxidizing agent. It is used to see whether blood is anemic.\nIt is commonly found in chemistry sets. It is used to demonstrate a displacement reaction, where a metal reacts with copper sulfate to make copper and the metal sulfate. It is also used to demonstrated hydrated and anhydrous chemicals. It was used as an emetic in the past. It is seen as too toxic now. \nIt can be used to purify copper. A thin pure piece of copper and a thick impure piece of copper are placed in copper sulfate solution. The thin plate is connected to the negative wire and the thick plate to the positive wire. An electrical current is passed through them. The copper in the thick plate dissolves and plates on the thin plate. All of the impurities fall to the bottom, while the pure copper is made at the negative electrode.\nSomeone covered the walls of their apartment with copper sulfate crystals for decoration.\nSafety.\nCopper sulfate is somewhat toxic to humans. It is very toxic to fish, though. In humans, it irritates skin and eyes. It can cause nausea when eaten. It automatically makes one throw up when it is ingested. If too much is eaten, however, it can get into the stomach and cause many problems."}

It was founded in 1931 by in the city of Kurume, Fukuoka, Fukuoka, Japan. The name Bridgestone comes from a translation \"ishibashi\", meaning \"stone bridge\" in Japanese.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nThe very first Bridgestone tire was produced on April 9, 1930, by the Japanese \"Tabi\" Socks Tyre Division. On March 1, 1931, the founder, Shojiro Ishibashi, made the \"Tabi\" Socks tire Division independent and established the Bridgestone Tire Co., Ltd. in the city of Kurume, Fukuoka Prefecture. \"Bridgestone\" was named after the name of the founder, Shojiro Ishibashi (\"Ishi\" = Stone, \"Bashi\" = Bridge).\nThe Bridgestone tire Co., Ltd. decided to build tires based solely on Japanese technology. The company had many problems in the early days. Improvements were made in quality and the building processes. The business expanded rapidly on both the domestic and overseas markets.\nChallenges during and after World War II.\nWartime regulations sent nearly all of the company's output to the military. After the war, the company was devastated. The Tokyo Headquarters building was destroyed by aerial bombing. All of their overseas assets were lost. The factories in Kurume and Yokohama were not damaged. Production was restarted after the war ended.\nAfter World War II, Bridgestone started manufacturing motorcycles. But its main income was from supplying tires to its rival motorcycle makers such as Honda, Suzuki and Yamaha. Bridgestone later decided to stop building motorcycles.\nTechnological innovation.\nIn 1951, Bridgestone was the first company in Japan to begin selling rayon cord tires. The sale of nylon tires was started in 1959. 1967 saw the sale of first ever radial tire. Bridgestone's first overseas plant since the end of the war was opened in Singapore in 1965. Bridgestone America was started in the United States in 1967 to represent Bridgestone. The \"Super Filler Radial\" went on the market in 1978. In 1979 the company introduced the high-performance \"POTENZA\" radial tire.\nThe company name changed to Bridgestone Corporation in 1984.\nFirestone purchase.\nIn 1988, Bridgestone purchased the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company. Bridgestone invested a lot of money into Firestone. They worked on rebuilding the Firestone company. By 1992, they were making a profit with \"Bridgestone Firestone Europe\". By 1993, they were making a profit with \"Bridgestone Firestone USA\".\nThe Firestone Tire and Rubber Company and Bridgestone Tire Company Ltd USA were merged in 1990 and became Bridgestone Firestone North American Holdings Ltd. To increase the brand awareness, they re-entered the Firestone brand into IndyCar racing in 1995. In 1997, \"Bridgestone Corporation Japan\" entered the Bridgestone brand into Formula One racing.\nBridgestone and Formula One racing.\nBridgestone has supplied tires in Formula One since . They supplied tires on a one race only basis for the and Japanese Grands Prix. These tires were for Japanese teams such as Heros Racing and Kojima.\nBridgestone decided to supply tires for Formula One in 1995. They wanted to improve company's name value in the European market. Their main competitor was Michelin.\nTheir first title was acquired in by Mika H\u00e4kkinen and McLaren-Mercedes. Bridgestone users took five Drivers' championship titles and five Constructors' championship titles during the years that had more than one tire available. For (\u2013), they competed with Goodyear. For (\u2013), they competed with Michelin.\nMichelin chose to end its Formula One tire program after the season. All teams have used Bridgestone tires from the season to the season. On November 2, 2009 Bridgestone announced that they will end their contract to supply tires to Formula One teams after 2010. The company said it was \"addressing the impact of the continuing evolution of the business environment\" \nDiversified products.\nBridgestone makes many other products than tires. The list includes: automotive components, industrial products, polyurethane foam products, construction materials, parts and materials for electronic equipment, bicycles and sporting goods.\nBandag.\nOn December 5, 2006, Bridgestone America and Bandag Inc. announced a merger. Bandag was a leading company in the tire re-treading business. Tire re-treading is the process of putting a new tread on a used tire. This will extend the life of the tire and save money. This process is mostly done on large truck tires. The name of new company has become \"Bridgestone Bandag, LLC\".\nBicycles.\nThe Bridgestone Cycle Co Ltd started in 1949. It offers bicycles under its own brand and under the \"Anchor brand\".\nBridgestone Aircraft tire.\n\"Bridgestone Aircraft tire (USA)\" builds aircraft tires and provides re-tread services.\nGolf Products.\n\"Precept Golf\" is a division of Bridgestone. They sell the Bridgestone Golfing Products. Bridgestone has been producing golf-related products since 1935. The Golf division of Bridgestone currently produces both clubs, balls and accessories."}

{"id": "264559", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=264559", "title": "Abstraction", "text": "An Abstraction keeps only the most important information about something in order to make it easier to reuse.\nAbstraction concerns the ways by which higher, less \"real\" concepts are derived from the usage and classification of literal (\"real\" or \"concrete\") data or other information.\nAbstractions may be formed by reducing the information content of a concept or a phenomenon as viewed, often to keep only the information which is needed for a particular purpose. For example, abstracting a leather soccer ball to the more general idea of a ball will keep only the information on general ball attributes and behavior, leaving out the traits of that particular ball. Compare with word: \"generalizing\". The opposite of the adjective \"abstract\" is commonly the word \"concrete\".\nOrigins.\nThe first symbols of abstract thinking in humans can be traced to fossil objects dating between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago in Africa.\nThought process.\nIn philosophical terminology, \"abstraction\" is the thought process wherein ideas are distanced from objects.\nAbstraction uses a strategy of simplification, where formerly concrete details are left ambiguous, vague, or undefined; thus effective communication about things in the abstract requires an intuitive or common experience between the communicator and the communication recipient.\nFor example, many different things can be the color red. Likewise, many things sit on surfaces (as in \"picture 1\", to the right). The property of \"redness\" and the relation \"sitting-on\" are therefore abstractions of those objects. Specifically, the conceptual diagram \"graph 1\" identifies only three boxes, two ellipses, and four arrows (and their six labels), whereas the \"picture 1\" shows much more pictorial detail, with the scores of implied relationships as implicit in the picture rather than with the nine explicit details in the graph.\n\"Graph 1\" details some explicit relationships between the objects of the diagram. For example, the arrow between the \"agent\" and \"CAT:Elsie\" depicts an example of an \"is-a\" relationship, as does the arrow between the \"location\" and the \"MAT\". The arrows between the gerund \"SITTING\" and the nouns \"agent\" and \"location\" express the diagram's basic relationship; \"agent is SITTING on location\"; \"Elsie\" is an instance of \"CAT\".\nAlthough the description \"sitting-on\" (graph 1) is more abstract than the graphic image of a cat sitting on a mat (picture 1), the delineation of abstract things from concrete things is somewhat ambiguous; this ambiguity or vagueness is characteristic of abstraction. Thus something as simple as a newspaper might be specified to six levels, as in Douglas Hofstadter's illustration of that ambiguity, with a progression from abstract to concrete in \"G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach\" (1979):\nAn abstraction can thus encapsulate each of these levels of detail with no loss of generality. But perhaps a detective or philosopher/scientist/engineer might seek to learn about some thing, at progressively deeper levels of detail, to solve a crime or a puzzle.\nReferents.\nAbstractions sometimes have ambiguous referents; for example, \"happiness\" (when used as an abstraction) can refer to as many things as there are people and events or states of being which make them happy. Likewise, \"architecture\" refers not only to the design of safe, functional buildings, but also to elements of creation and innovation which aim at elegant solutions to construction problems, to the use of space, and to the attempt to evoke an emotional response in the builders, owners, viewers and users of the building.\nInstantiation.\nThings that do not exist at any particular place and time are often considered abstract. By contrast, instances, or members, of such an abstract thing might exist in many different places and times. Those abstract things are then said to be \"multiply instantiated\", in the sense of \"picture 1\", \"picture 2\", etc., shown above.\nIt is not sufficient, however, to define \"abstract\" ideas as those that can be instantiated and to define \"abstraction\" as the movement in the opposite direction to instantiation. Doing so would make the concepts \"cat\" and \"telephone\" abstract ideas since despite their varying appearances, a particular cat or a particular telephone is an instance of the concept \"cat\" or the concept \"telephone\". Although the concepts \"cat\" and \"telephone\" are \"abstractions\", they are not \"abstract\" in the sense of the objects in \"graph 1\" above.\nWe might look at other graphs, in a progression from \"cat\" to \"mammal\" to \"animal\", and see that \"animal\" is more abstract than \"mammal\"; but on the other hand \"mammal\" is a harder idea to express, certainly in relation to \"marsupial\" or \"monotreme\".\nPhysicality.\nA physical object (a possible referent of a concept or word) is considered \"concrete\" (not abstract) if it is a \"particular individual\" that occupies a particular place and time.\nAbstract things are sometimes defined as those things that do not exist in reality or exist only as sensory experiences, like the color red. That definition, however, suffers from the difficulty of deciding which things are real (i.e. which things exist in reality). For example, it is difficult to agree to whether concepts like \"God\", \"the number three\", and \"goodness\" are real, abstract, or both.\nAn approach to resolving such difficulty is to use \"predicates\" as a general term for whether things are variously real, abstract, concrete, or of a particular property (e.g. \"good\"). Questions about the properties of things are then propositions about predicates, which propositions remain to be evaluated by the investigator. In the \"graph 1\" above, the graphical relationships like the arrows joining boxes and ellipses might denote predicates. Different levels of abstraction might be denoted by a progression of arrows joining boxes or ellipses in multiple rows, where the arrows point from one row to another, in a series of other graphs, say graph 2, etc.\nAbstraction used in philosophy.\nAbstraction in philosophy is the process (or, to some, the alleged process) in concept-formation of recognizing some set of common features in individuals, and on that basis forming a concept of that feature. The notion of abstraction is important to understanding some philosophical controversies surrounding empiricism and the problem of universals. It has also recently become popular in formal logic under predicate abstraction. Another philosophical tool for discussion of abstraction is thought space.\nOntological status.\nThe way in which physical objects, like rocks and trees, have \"being\" differs from the way that properties of abstract concepts or relations have \"being\". For example, the way the concrete, particular, individuals pictured in \"picture 1\" exist differs from the way the concepts illustrated in \"graph 1\" exist. That difference accounts for the ontological usefulness of the word \"abstract\". The word applies to properties and relations to mark the fact that, if they exist, they do not exist in space or time, but that instances of them can exist, potentially in many different places and times.\nPerhaps confusingly, some philosophies refer to \"tropes\" (instances of properties) as \"abstract particulars\". E.g., the particular redness of a particular apple is an \"abstract particular\". Akin to qualia and sumbebekos.\nIn linguistics.\nIf an abstract concept, such as \"society\" or \"technology\" is treated as if it were a concrete object, that is a fallacy (an error). In linguistics, it may happen that abstract concepts are used as if they were nouns that signify concrete objects:\nThis is called \"metonymy\". It can blur the distinction between abstract and concrete things.\nCompression.\nAn abstraction can be seen as a process of mapping multiple different pieces of constituent data to a single piece of abstract data based on similarities in the constituent data, for example many different physical cats map to the abstraction \"CAT\". This conceptual scheme emphasizes the inherent equality of both constituent and abstract data, thus avoiding problems arising from the distinction between \"abstract\" and \"concrete\". In this sense the process of abstraction entails the identification of similarities between objects and the process of associating these objects with an abstraction (which is itself an object).\nChains of abstractions can therefore be constructed moving from neural impulses arising from sensory perception to basic abstractions such as color or shape to experiential abstractions such as a specific cat to semantic abstractions such as the \"idea\" of a CAT to classes of objects such as \"mammals\" and even categories such as \"object\" as opposed to \"action\".\nThis conceptual scheme entails no specific hierarchical taxonomy (such as the one mentioned involving cats and mammals), only a progressive exclusion of detail.\nThe neurology of abstraction.\nA recent meta-analysis suggests that the verbal system has greater engagement for abstract concepts when the perceptual system is more engaged for processing of concrete concepts. This is because abstract concepts cause greater brain activity in the inferior frontal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus, compared to concrete concepts when concrete concepts cause greater activity in the posterior cingulate, precuneus, fusiform gyrus, and parahippocampal gyrus.\nOther research into the human brain suggests that the left and right hemispheres, of the brain, differ in their handling of abstraction. For example, one meta-analysis reviewing human brain lesions has shown a left hemisphere bias during tool usage.\nAbstraction in art.\nTypically, \"abstraction\" is used in the arts as a synonym for abstract art in general. Strictly speaking, it refers to art unconcerned with the literal depiction of things from the visible world\u2014it can, however, refer to an object or image which has been distilled from the real world, or indeed, another work of art. Artwork that reshapes the natural world for expressive purposes is called abstract; that which derives from, but does not imitate a recognizable subject is called nonobjective abstraction. In the 20th century the trend toward abstraction coincided with advances in science, technology, and changes in urban life, eventually reflecting an interest in psychoanalytic theory. Later still, abstraction was manifest in more purely formal terms, such as color, freed from objective context, and a reduction of form to basic geometric designs.\nIn music, the term \"abstraction\" can be used to describe improvisatory approaches to interpretation, and may sometimes indicate abandonment of tonality. Atonal music has no key signature, and is characterized the exploration of internal numeric relationships.\nAbstraction in psychology.\nCarl Jung's definition of abstraction broadened its scope beyond the thinking process to include exactly four mutually exclusive, opposing complementary psychological functions: sensation, intuition, feeling, and thinking. Together they form a structural totality of the differentiating abstraction process. Abstraction operates in one of these opposing functions when it excludes the simultaneous influence of the other functions and other irrelevancies, such as emotion. Abstraction requires selective use of this structural split of abilities in the psyche. The opposite of abstraction is concretism. \"Abstraction\" is one of Jung's 57 definitions in Chapter XI of \"Psychological Types\".\nThere is an abstract \"thinking\", just as there is abstract \"feeling\", \"sensation\" and \"intuition\". Abstract thinking singles out the rational, logical qualities ... Abstract feeling does the same with ... its feeling-values. ... I put abstract feelings on the same level as abstract thoughts. ... Abstract sensation would be aesthetic as opposed to sensuous \"sensation\" and abstract intuition would be symbolic as opposed to fantastic \"intuition\". (Jung, [1921] (1971):par. 678).\nAbstraction in computer science.\nComputer scientists use abstraction to understand and solve problems, such as organizing data to be stored in a database.\nAbstraction in mathematics.\nAbstraction in mathematics is the process of extracting the underlying essence of a mathematical concept, removing any dependence on real-world objects with which it might originally have been connected, and generalizing it so that it has wider applications or matching among other abstract descriptions of equivalent phenomena.\nThe advantages of abstraction in mathematics are:\nThe main disadvantage of abstraction is that highly abstract concepts are more difficult to learn, and require a degree of mathematical maturity and experience before they can be assimilated."}

It is mostly used by females, and by stage performers of all types. Eye makeup is an important part of the fashion and cosmetic industries.\nThe idea can be taken much further. The colour of the eye can be altered by using contact lenses. Glitter and other \"appliqu\u00e9s\" can be stuck on near the eye. Fake eyelashes or eyelash extensions are possible.\nMascara.\nMascara is a cosmetic used to darken, colour, thicken, lengthen, or define eyelashes. Historically, it was (and still is) usually black, but now it also comes in many colours and tints. Mascara comes in three forms: liquid, cake, and cream. It is available in tubes with wand applicators. Ingredients in mascara include water, wax thickeners, film-formers, and preservatives.\nEye shadow.\nEye shadow is a cosmetic that is applied on the eyelids and under the eyebrows. The average distance between eyelashes and eyebrows is twice as big in women as in men. Pale eye shadow visually enlarges this area and has a feminising effect.\nEye shadow can be applied in a variety of ways depending upon the desired look. Typically application is done using sponges, fingers, and/or brushes. The most important aspect of applying eye shadow, and makeup in general, is blending well.\nTo remove eye shadow, a commercial eye makeup remover may be used, though a face wash will usually remove all traces of colour. Generally it is easy to remove, and simple water and soap can be used. Eye shadow, eyeliner, and mascara may also be removed using baby oil or olive oil. There are also makeup wipes that may be used.\nEye liner.\nEye liner is a cosmetic used to define the eyes. It is applied around the contours of the eye, along and above the edges of the eyelids where the eyelashes grow. Often applied just on the outer half of the eye.\nTypes.\nDepending on its texture, eyeliner can be softly smudged or clearly defined. There are six main types available on the market: \nKohl.\nKohl is an ancient black eye pigment which survives to the present day in the Mediterranean, the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent. It was a dark-colored powder made of crushed galena (lead sulfide) and/or antimony, burnt almonds, lead, cupric oxide, ochre, ash, malachite, or any combination of them. It may be used as an eye liner, mascara or eyeshadow.\nThe upper and lower eyelids were painted in a line that extended to the sides of the face for an almond effect. In addition to reducing sun glare, it was believed that kohl eyeliner could restore good eyesight and reduce eye infection. Kohl was kept in a small, flat-bottomed pot with a wide, tiny rim and a flat, disk-shaped lid.\nAccording to images of the time, the use of makeup was not limited to women. Highly polished silver and copper mirrors aided the application of makeup."}

The League sanctions three racing series. The premier IZOD IndyCar Series (ICS), the two developmental series; Firestone Indy Lights and the U.S. F2000 National Championship. ICS is sometimes considered the same as the Indy Racing League. The Indy Racing League's centerpiece race is the Indianapolis 500.\nThe IRL is owned by Hulman and Co., which also owns the Indianapolis Motor Speedway complex and the Clabber Girl brand.\nOn September 10, 2010, the IRL announced that effective January 1, 2011, the Indy Racing League will simply be known as \"IndyCar\".\nSanctioned series.\nIZOD IndyCar Series.\nThe \"IndyCar Series\" is the series name for the premier series sanctioned by the IRL. The name started being used in 2003. Izod was announced as the IndyCar Series title sponsor in 2010. The deal is expected to run for at least five years.\nAt first IndyCar only raced on oval tracks. In 2005, the series started adding road and street course events.\nSupport series.\n\"Firestone Indy Lights\" is the development series for the Izod Indycar series. It started in 2002, as the \"IRL Infiniti Pro Series\". \"USF2000\" is a series the IRL started sanctioning in 2010. It started in 1991 and ended in 2006. It then restarted in 2010.\nHistory.\nIndy car name.\n\"Indy car\" is sometimes used as a name for any open-wheel auto racing in the United States. The Indy car name derived as a result of the link to the Indianapolis 500 Mile Race (often called to as the \"Indy 500\").\nBeginning in 1980, the term Indy car was used for the race cars in CART races. CART had become the main governing body for open-wheel racing in the United States. The Indianapolis 500 was not controlled by CART. It remained sanctioned by USAC. CART recognized the Indy 500 on its schedule, and awarded points for finishers in the race from 1980 to 1995 despite not sanctioning it. The two entities operated separately, but used the same equipment.\nIn 1992, the Indianapolis Motor Speedway tradmarked the \"IndyCar\". They licensed CART to use the name. CART renamed its championship the \"IndyCar World Series\". The name \"CART\" was no longer used. The series did not want fans to think they were go-karts.\nSplit with CART.\nThe IRL was founded in 1994 by Tony George and began racing in 1996. George designed the IRL as a lower-cost open-wheel alternative to CART. CART was dominated by a few rich multi-car teams, much like Formula One. The split between IRL and CART was very unfriendly. Both series greatly suffered because of it.\nJoining with Champ Car.\nIn February 2008, Indy Racing League founder and CEO Tony George and owners of the Champ Car World Series completed an agreement to join the sport for 2008. The Champ Car World Series was suspended except for the Long Beach Grand Prix. Many of the former Champ Car teams moved to the IndyCar Series using equipment provided by the League.\nDriver safety.\nDriver safety has also been a major concern. A number of drivers injured, mostly in the early years of the series. Several of those injuries were serious or fatal. Unlike road racing, the higher speed and lack of runoff areas on oval tracks, allowed for less margin for error. Car design was a leading cause of early injuries.The series made improvements to chassis design to address those safety concerns.\nThe IRL was also the first race series to adopt the new SAFER barrier soft wall safety system. First at the Indianapolis 500 and now installed at almost all major oval racing circuits."}

Other names include formula car, single-seater car in British English, or Indy car in the United States. Open-wheel cars are different from street cars, sports cars, stock cars, and touring cars. These car have their wheels below or inside the body or fenders. Open-wheel cars are usually built just for racing. Often, they have a higher amount of technological sophistication than in other forms of motor racing.\nDesign.\nA typical open-wheeler has a small cockpit. It is only large enough for the driver's body. The head is exposed to the air. In modern cars the engine is often located directly behind the driver, and drives the rear wheels. Depending on the rules of the class, many types of open-wheelers have spoilers or wings. They are very low and have an almost flat bottom. These help add aerodynamic downforce. This pushes the car on to the road and makes it handle better.\nSome races, such as the Monaco Grand Prix are held on temporary street circuits. Most open-wheel races are on dedicated road courses, such as the N\u00fcrburgring in Germany. In the United States some top-level open wheel events are held on ovals, both short track and superspeedways. The most famous the annual Indianapolis 500 (Indy 500) \nDriving.\nDriving an open-wheel car is very different from driving a car with fenders. Open-wheel vehicles, are light weight, have good aerodynamics, and powerful engines. Wheel-to-wheel contact is dangerous. If the forward edge of one tire contacts the rear of another tire, the vehicle my be flipped into the air and upside down. "}

A person using a semi-automatic shotgun has to load the first shell themselves. The rest of the shells are loaded by the gun using part of the energy used to fire each shell. \nSome shotguns can work as semi-automatic, pump-action, or fully automatic. The SPAS-12, for example, can fire in semi-automatic mode or it can use a pump action. Pump action allows less deadly projectiles such as bean bags or gas canisters to be used. Some shotguns, such as the AA-12, can be fully automatic or it can be switched to semi-automatic mode.\nSemi-automatic shotguns are commonly used by special forces, military, and for other uses where shells need to be fired quickly, without reloading."}

The current series was founded by Indianapolis Motor Speedway owner Tony George. It began in 1996 as a competitor to CART known as the Indy Racing League (IRL). In 2008, the IndyCar Series merged with the Champ Car World Series (formerly CART). The series continues to be sanctioned by the Indy Racing League, which has taken the name IndyCar. In 2019, the series was purchased by Roger Penske.\nOverview.\nSeries name.\nThe IRL was unable to utilize the name \"IndyCar\" until the beginning of the 2003 for legal reasons. For 1996-1997, the series was simply called the \"USAC Indy Racing League\". For 1998-1999, the series received its first title sponsor, and was known as the \"Pep Boys Indy Racing League\". In 2000, the series sponsor became the Internet search engine Northern Light. The series was named the \"Indy Racing Northern Light Series\". This only lasted two of the planed five year contract.\nThe league went back to the \"Indy Racing League\" name for the 2002 season. The IndyCar Series name was adopted in 2003. For the 2008 season, DirecTV served as a presenting sponsor, and the series was briefly advertised as the \"IndyCar Series in DIRECTV HD\".\nIZOD was announced as the series title sponsor beginning on November 5, 2009. The contrace runs for at least 5 years. In 2014, Verizon replaced IZOD as the series sponsor.\nCar History and current specifications.\nThe IndyCar Series is not an open formula, where teams build their own cars. Chassis and engine manufacturers provided products only to the league in three-year cycles. Currently, Dallara provides the chassis to all teams and Honda is the sole engine supplier. The series basically a one-make or \"spec\" series.\nChassis.\nIn the series' first season in 1996 used older CART chassis. Any chassis built by Lola and Reynard from 1992 to 1995 could be used. The current Indycar started in 1997. Tony George defined rules for less expensive cars and production-based engines. This outlawed the CART chassis and turbocharged engines. These had been the type of race car used at the Indianapolis 500 since the late 1960s. \nDallara began producing Indycars for the 1997 season. The G Force chassis was introduced in 1997. It won the 1997 and 2000 Indy 500 races. In 2002, \u00c9lan Motorsport Technologies bought G Force. The chassis was re-named \"Panoz G Force\", and then shortened to \"Panoz\" in 2005.\nRiley &amp; Scott produced IndyCar chassis from 1997-2000.\nFrom the outside, IndyCars resemble those of other open-wheeled formula racing cars. They have front and rear wings and large air intakes.\nFuel.\nMethanol.\nAt its inception, the IRL used methanol racing fuel. Methanol has been the standard choice in American open wheel racing since a fiery crash at the 1964 Indianapolis 500. Methanol provided a safer alternative to gasoline. It does not start burning as quickly as gasoline. A methanol fire can be put out with water. A methanol fire cannot be seen in daylight, which is a problem. Material was added to the fuel so it would burn with a color.\nEthanol.\nFor the 2006 season, the fuel was a 90%/10% mixture of methanol and ethanol. Starting in 2007, the league advertised using 100% Fuel Grade Ethanol. The mixture was actually 98% ethanol and 2% gasoline. The additives satisfied the U.S. government's requirement that the alcohol be unfit for human consumption. It also adds a visible color in case of a fire.\nEngines.\nFor the 1996 season, the old CART specification engines were used. They were also used for the first two races of the 1996-97 season. They were V8 engines with 45\u00a0inches of turbocharger boost. The Menard-Buick V6 engine was used in 1996 with 55\u00a0inches of boost was also used.\nFord-Cosworth provided support to teams running their older-spec engines. The Ilmor Mercedes V8 engine, was allowed. It was only used once at the 1996 Indy 500.\nStarting in 1997, IRL cars were powered by 4.0\u00a0L V8, methanol burning engines. They were production-based and normally-aspirated engines. They were produced by Oldsmobile under the Aurora label, and Nissan under the Infiniti label. They produced around 700 horsepower. The engine rules changed in 2000. The displacement was dropped from 4.0L to 3.5L. The block no longer needed to be production-based. In 2004, the displacement was further reduced to 3.0L to curb top speeds.\nWhen General Motors' ended the Oldsmobile name, the engine label was changed to Chevrolet starting with the 2002 season. In August 2003, Chevrolet announced its \"Gen IV\" motor, a rebadged Cosworth motor for competition. At the time, Cosworth was owned by Ford. On November 4, 2004, Chevrolet stated that it would be ending its IRL engine program at the end of the 2005 season.\nIn 2003, Toyota came to the IRL. In November 2005, Toyota company officials announced the company's withdrawal from American open-wheel racing and the immediate discontinuation of its IRL program. This was the same time they entered into NASCAR's Craftsman Truck Series.\nHonda also came to the IRL in 2003. By 2005 was clearly the dominant engine manufacturer. Starting in 2006, they became the only engine manufacturer in the IndyCar Series, and will continue in that capacity until 2010. The Honda engine is designed and produced by Ilmor Engineering, which is part owned by Roger Penske.\nIndyCar Series engines are rev-limited to 10,300 Revolutions per minute (rpm) and produce approximately 650 hp. The valve train is a dual overhead camshaft configuration with four valves per cylinder. The crankshaft is made of alloy steel, with five main bearing caps. The pistons are forged aluminum alloy, while the connecting rods are machined alloy steel. The electronic engine management system is supplied by Motorola, firing a Capacitor discharge ignition (CDI) ignition system. The engine lubrication is a dry sump type, cooled by a single water pump.\nSeasons.\nFollowing the merger of CART/Champ Car into the Indy Racing League in 2008, the IRL acquired all intellectual property and historic records.\n1996: Scott Sharp and Buzz Calkins were tied in the final standings, and were declared co-champions. Calkins had one win, as opposed to Sharp being winless, but no tiebreakers were in place.\n2006: Sam Hornish, Jr. and Dan Wheldon tied in the final standings for first place. Hornish clinched the championship based on a tiebreaker of most victories during the season.\n2008: Although no report was officially released about it in 2008, IndyCar.com confirmed in 2009 that Danica Patrick being named Most Popular Driver was her \"fifth consecutive\" win of the award."}

The Parisien \"Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture\" was his conception. It has the legal authority to decide who may use the term \"haute couture\".\nCareer.\nWorth made his mark in the French fashion industry. He worked at several prosperous London drapery shops before moving to Paris in 1846. He was hired by Gagelin and Opigez, well-known Parisian drapers. While working in their shop, he married one of the firm's models, Marie Vernet. Worth made a few simple dresses for his wife and customers started to ask for copies of the dresses as well.\nWorth, by now a junior partner in the firm, urged his partners to expand into dressmaking, but they hesitated. Worth found a rich Swede, Otto Bobergh, who was willing to bankroll the venture and opened the dressmaking establishment of Worth and Bobergh in 1858. Worth was soon patronized by the French Empress Eug\u00e9nie, and after that by many titled, rich, and otherwise notable women. He also dressed actresses such as Sarah Bernhardt and singers such as Nellie Melba. Many of his customers travelled to Paris from other countries, coming from as far away as New York and Boston.\nHe removed excessive ruffles and frills and used rich fabrics in simple, but flattering, outlines. He is credited as the first designer to put labels onto the clothing he manufactured.\nWorth gave his customers luxurious materials and exact fit. Rather than let the customer dictate the design, as had previously been dressmaking practice, four times a year he displayed model dresses at fashion shows. This was the start of the fashion show as we know it.\nHis patronesses would pick a model, which would then be sewn in fabrics of their choice and tailored to their figure. Worth was sufficiently fashionable that he had to turn away customers. This only added to his fame. He completely revolutionized the business of dressmaking. He was the first of the couturiers, dressmakers considered artists rather than mere artisans.\nWorth and Bobergh shut down during the Franco-Prussian War and re-opened in 1871, without Bobergh, as the House of Worth. Worth took his sons, Gaston and Jean-Philippe, into his business and the couture house continued to flourish after his death in 1895.\nThe great fashion dynasty finally came to an end in 1952 when Charles Frederick Worth's great-grandson, Jean-Charles (1881\u20131962), retired from the family business. In 1954, the House merged with Paquin. Then in 1956 it was closed.\nPerfume.\nWorth was one of the first couture houses to give its name to a luxury perfume. In 1924 Les Parfums Worth launched the first fragrance, \"Dans La Nuit\" and Rene Lalique, the world renowned glass-maker, designed the bottle. Between the wars, the House produced five perfumes: \"Dans La Nuit\" (1924), \"Vers le Jours\" (1925), \"Sans Adieu\" (1929), \"Je Reviens\" (1932), and \"Vers Toi\" (1934).\n\"Je Reviens\" remains the most famous of Worth's perfumes. The perfume became a favoured gift from soldiers to their sweethearts during WWII. The top London store Harrods offers the perfume in its classic blue ridged bottle, which dates back to the perfume\u2019s original launch.\nRevival of the House of Worth.\nThe House of Worth has re-emerged. Dilesh Mehta (perfumes) and Martin McCarthy (fashion) recently combined their intellectual properties for Worth perfume and apparel. This meant, for the first time since the 1920s, the House is reunited and restored.\nThe House of Worth resumed in January 2010 with a revival couture collection by Giovanni Bedin. The spring/summer collection was unveiled in Paris at \"Les Salons France-Am\u00eariques\" and the winter collection in Milan. Bedin's exquisite corsets and tutus with clouds of tulle and antique lace echo Worth's ideas. Customers include Scarlett Johansson, Kylie Minogue and Charlize Theron.\nLe Pr\u00eat-a-Porter.\nThe spectacle of couture is just one aspect of the restored House of Worth. Complementing this is a presentation of \"Le Pr\u00eat-a-Porter\" (ready-to-wear). Worth\u2019s \"Je Reviens\" perfume will be relaunched, followed in 2011 by the House of Worth\u2019s lingerie and accessories, such as couture jewelry and made-to-measure gloves."}

{"id": "264716", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=264716", "title": "Firestone Tire and Rubber Company", "text": "The Firestone Tire and Rubber Company is a tire company founded by Harvey Firestone in 1900. They supplied air filled tires for wagons, buggies, and other forms of wheeled vehicles common at the time. Firestone soon saw the possibility for increasing sales by making tires for automobiles. The company was a early leader in the mass production of tires. Firestone become the original equipment supplier of Ford Motor Company automobiles. They also sold a lot of replacement tires.\nIn 1988, the company was sold to the Japanese Bridgestone Corporation. It is now known as Bridgestone Firestone.\nHistory.\nEarly/Mid 20th century.\nFirestone was originally based in Akron, Ohio. That was also the home of its rival, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. The company initiated operations in 1900 with 12 employees. Together, Firestone and Goodyear were the largest suppliers of automotive tires in North America for over three-quarters of a century. In 1906 Firestone was chosen by Henry Ford for the Model T.\nAt one point, the company had a rubber plantation in Liberia that covered more than 4,000 square kilometers (1 million acres).\nDuring World War II the company make artillery shells, aluminum kegs for food transport and other rubberized military products. In the 1940s, Firestone was given a defense contract to produce plastic helmet liners. \nIn 1951, Firestone was given the defense contract for the MGM-5 Corporal missile. In 1961, Firestone acquired the Dayton Tire division from the Dayco Corporation.\nRestructuring and sale to Bridgestone.\nIn late 1979, Firestone brought in John Nevin as president. He was the former head of Zenith Electronics. Firestone was more than a billion dollars in debt at the time, and losing 250 million dollars a year. Nevin closed nine of the company's seventeen manufacturing plants. He moved the company from Akron to Chicago. He split the non-tire related businesses from the main company. In 1988 Nevin negotiated the sale of the company to the Japanese company Bridgestone. Bridgestone Corporation Japan was able to buy the company for much less than it had been worth a decade and a half earlier. The combined Bridgestone Firestone North American operations are now based in Nashville, Tennessee.\nRacing.\nFormula One.\nFirestone has been a major tire supplier for Formula One teams. From to they supplied tires to a number of teams, including Ferrari, Team Lotus, and Honda. They had 121 cars start the race on their tires, winning 49 of those races. They were on the winning car of every Indianapolis 500 race from 1950 to 1960. These years, the Indy 500 was part of the Formula One world championship series. Their last win came in the 1972 Italian Grand Prix. Firestone has four Drivers World Championships and three Constructors World Championships with teams using their tires.\nCorporate troubles.\nGreat American streetcar scandal.\nIn 1950, Firestone along with General Motors and Standard Oil were charged and convicted of criminal conspiracy for their part in the \"Great American streetcar scandal\". The scandal included buying streetcar systems all across the United States. They would shut them down, and replacing them with buses.\nFirestone 500 tread separation problem.\nRadial tires were introduced to the US market by rivals Goodrich and Michelin in the late 1960s. Firestone lacked a radial. The first radial tire design and built by Firestone was the Firestone 500 Radial. Manufacturing of the new tire was done on equipment designed to build bias-ply tires. \nDuring the 1970s, Firestone had major problems with the Firestone 500 radial. At high speeds, the steel-belted radials started showing signs that the tread was coming apart from the tire. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) investigation found that the tread separation problem was most likely a design defect affecting all Firestone 500's. \nIn 1977 Firestone recalled of 400,000 tires produced at the Decatur plant. Firestone blamed the problems on the consumer. They said the problems were caused by under inflation and poor maintenance. On October 20, 1978, Firestone recalled over 7 million Firestone 500 tires. Congressional hearings took place in 1978. The tire was found to be defective and the cause of 34 deaths. In May 1980 NHTSA fined Firestone $500,000 USD. At that time was the largest fine imposed on any U.S. corporation. Several lawsuits were settled out of court. The bad publicity hurt the company's sales and share price badly.\nLiberian rubber plant.\nIn 1926, Firestone opened one of the world's biggest rubber plantations in Liberia, West Africa. The International Labor Rights Fund said about Firestone, Firestone's management denied these claims. They said the corporation provided employment, pensions, and health care to thousands of Liberians. The company also provides education and training opportunities to employees and their children.\nIn May 2006, the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) released a report on the state of human rights on Liberia's rubber plantations. According to the report, Firestone did not monitor child labor very well. UNMIL found that several problems. They included pressure to meet company quotas, incentive to support the family financially, and lack of access to basic education. The report also said that the workers' housing provided by Firestone has not been renovated. They had been built in the 1920s and 1930s.\nDan Adomitis, President of Firestone Natural Rubber Company, talked to CNN about the production quotas and child labor. He said that a worker will tap about 650 trees a day, and spend a couple of minutes at each tree. CNN pointed out the 650 trees, at two minutes per tree, is 1,300 minutes. That is more than 21 hours of work a day.\nIn response to the claims, Dan Adomitis said:\nFord Explorer rollover problem.\nIn 1996, several state agencies in Arizona began having big problems with Firestone tires on Ford Explorers. Firestone conducted an investigation of the complaints, tested the tires and asserted that the tires had been abused or under-inflated.\nAccording to Joan Claybrook of the group Public Citizen, Ford also played a large part. They said Ford told Firestone to add a nylon ply to the tires it manufactured in Venezuela for additional strength. Ford changed the suspension to Explorers available in Venezuela. Ford did not ask for the nylon ply for U.S.-made Firestone tires. And they did it change the Explorer suspension on US models.\nThere was a very high failure rate in Firestone's \"Wilderness AT\", \"Firestone ATX\", and \"ATX II\" tires. Several lawsuits were filed. There was a mandatory recall of the tires. In 2001 Bridgestone Firestone stopped working with Ford because they did not trust Ford. They said Ford had not listened to warnings by Bridgestone Firestone about the design of the Ford Explorer. In 2006, Firestone announced a new effort to recall the same tires recalled in 2000.

They are an intermediate between standard heels and \"stiletto heels\", which are from 4 to 10 inches. The extreme heels are made of steel, and very narrow at the base: 0.4 inches or less. These have been widely criticised for the health risks regular wear would bring. They have also been criticised by feminists.

It is obvious that the higher the heel, the riskier the shoe. The more sensible versions are quite safe; the extreme versions seen on fashion show catwalks are not for everyday wear. A lot depends on their use. Nurses tend to wear flat shoes; office staff may prefer high heels. Despite the critics, high heels have been around for a long time, and are probably going to stay."}

The two main types of gangrene are dry gangrene and wet gangrene. A third less common type is a form of wet gangrene known as gas gangrene. A very rare type which affects the internal organs is known as internal gangrene. \nDry gangrene is usually caused by a loss of blood supply to the affected area, such as may happen following an injury which damages the blood vessels to the affected area. Wet gangrene usually occurs when a wound becomes infected with various types of bacteria. Gas gangrene is usually caused by \"clostridium\" bacteria and mainly affects the muscles. Internal gangrene affects the internal organs, usually the intestines, gallbladder, or appendix.\nThere are a number of risk factors which increase a person's chances of getting gangrene.

Attached inside the top of the follicle are sebaceous glands, which are tiny sebum-producing glands in almost all skin except on the palms, lips and soles of the feet. The thicker the hair, the more the number of sebaceous glands there are.\nAlso attached to the follicle is a tiny bundle of muscle fiber, called the \"arrector pili\", which is responsible for causing the follicle lissis to become more upright the surface of the skin. The muscle area can also cause the follicle to stick up slightly above the nearby skin (piloerection) with a pore incased with skin oil. This process results in goose bumps (or goose flesh). Stem cells are at the junction of the arrector and the follicle, and are principally responsible for the ongoing hair production during a process known as the Anagen stage.\nThe average growth rate of healthy hair follicles on the scalp is nearly per month.\nStructure.\nPapilla.\nAt the base of the follicle is a structure that is called the papilla. The papilla is made up mainly of connective tissue and a capillary loop. Cell division in the papilla is either rare or non-existent.\nMatrix.\nAround the papilla is the hair matrix, a collection of epithelial cells often mixed with the pigment-producing (color) cells, known as melanocytes. Cell division in the hair matrix is responsible for the cells that will form the major structures of the hair fiber and the inner root sheath. The hair matrix epithelium is one of the fastest-growing cell areas in the human body, which is why some forms of chemotherapy which kill dividing cells or radiotherapy may lead to temporary hair loss. The papilla is usually oval or pear-shaped, with the matrix wrapped almost totally around it, except for a short stalk-like connection to the surrounding connective tissue that provides access for the capillary.\nRoot sheath.\nThe root sheath is composed of an external (outside) and internal (inside) root sheath. The external root sheath appears empty with cuboid cells when stained with H&amp;E stain. The internal root sheath is composed of three layers, Henle's layer, Huxley's layer, and an internal cuticle that is continuous with the outer layer of the hair fiber.\nHair fiber.\nThe hair fiber is composed of a cuticle that is continuous with the root sheath, an intermediate cortex, and an inner medulla.\nBulge.\nThe bulge is in the outer root sheath at the insertion point of the arrector pili muscle. It houses several types of stem cells, which supply the entire hair follicle with new cells, and take part in healing the epidermis after a wound.\nOther structures.\nOther structures associated with the hair follicle include arrector pili muscles, sebaceous glands and apocrine sweat glands. Hair follicle nerve receptors sense the position of the hairs.\nMorphogenesis (origin of form).\nBefore a baby is born, the epithelium and underlying mesenchyma interact to form hair follicles.\nHair-follicle cycling.\nHair grows in cycles of various phases: anagen is the growth phase; catagen is the involuting or regressing phase; and telogen, the resting or quiescent (still) phase. Each phase has several morphologically and histologically distinguishable sub-phases. Prior to the start of cycling is a phase of follicular morphogenesis (formation of the follicle). There is also a shedding phase, or exogen, that is independent of anagen and telogen in which one of several hairs that might arise from a single follicle exits. Normally up to 90% of the hair follicles are in anagen phase while, 10\u201314% are in telogen and 1\u20132% in catagen phase. The cycle's length varies on different parts of the body. For eyebrows, the cycle is completed in around 4 months, while it takes the scalp 3\u20134 years to finish; this is the reason eyebrow hairs have a much shorter length limit compared to hairs on the head. Growth cycles are controlled by a chemical signal like epidermal growth factor.\nAnagen phase.\nAnagen is the color phase of hair follicles. The color of your hair will start to fade because the cell only last a couple months. \nCatagen phase.\nThe catagen phase is a short transition stage that occurs at the end of the anagen phase. It signals the end of the active growth of a hair. This phase lasts for about 2\u20133 weeks while a club hair is formed.\nTelogen phase.\nThe telogen phase is the resting phase of the hair follicle. The club hair is the final product of a hair follicle in the telogen stage, and is a dead, fully keratinized hair. Fifty to one-hundred club hairs are shed daily from a normal scalp."}

It is the oldest university in the state of Western Australia. The law that set up the university was the University of Western Australia Act 1911. The Act sets out how the university is to be managed by a Senate, which can make rules and regulations. These are included in the University Calendar.\nOne of the best and most respected universities in Australia, UWA is also highly ranked internationally. To date UWA has close to 100 Rhodes Scholars and one Nobel Prize winner, Barry Marshall. The university joined the \"Matariki Network of Universities\" as the youngest member, being the only established university from the 20th century.\nHistory.\nThe university was first set up in Irwin Street, in the centre of Perth. It was housed in several buildings between Hay Street and St George's Terrace. Irwin Street was also known as \"Tin Pan Alley\" because many of the buildings had corrugated iron roofing. These buildings were the university campus until 1932, when the campus moved to its present-day site in Crawley ().\nIn the 1910s the founding Chancellor, Sir John Winthrop Hackett, gave over \u00a3425,000 to the university. This allowed the building of its magnificent main buildings at the present-day campus. Many buildings and landmarks within the university are named after him, including Winthrop Hall and Hackett Hall.\nA part of the original buildings is still in use, called the \"Irwin Street Building\". In the 1930s it was moved to the new campus. In 1987 it was repaired and moved to James Oval. Recently, the building was the Senate meeting room and is now used as a cricket pavilion and storage space for the University Archives. The building has been heritage-listed by both the National Trust and the Australian Heritage Commission.\nFaculties.\nThe university has nine Faculties:\nCampus.\nUWA is one of the largest landowners in Perth, though government grants and private gifts. Recent developments include the $22 million University Club, opened in June 2005, the UWA Watersports Complex, opened in August 2005, the $64 million Molecular and Chemical Sciences building opened in September 2005 and a $30 million Business School building opened in May 2009. A new $360 million medical research facility is due to begin in early 2009 and be completed by the end of 2011.\nAttractions.\nThe 65-hectare Crawley campus is next to the Swan River, and located 5\u00a0km from the Perth central business district. Many of the buildings are made from limestone, including the Winthrop Hall with its Romanesque architecture. These buildings are built amongst large lawns and thickets of trees such as the Sunken Garden and the Tropical Grove. The beauty of the grounds and rich history of the campus make it a popular spot for weddings.\nThe Arts Faculty building includes the New Fortune Theatre . This is a copy of the original Elizabethan Fortune Theatre and the only one of its kind in the southern hemisphere. Since 1995 the open air theatre has had regular performances of Shakespeare's plays, put on by the Graduate Dramatic Society and the University Dramatic Society. The theatre is also home to a family of peafowl given to the university by the Perth Zoo. \nThe Berndt Museum of Anthropology, on the ground floor of the Social Sciences Building, holds the finest collection of Aboriginal art in the world according to the Collections Australia Network (CAN). Its Asian and Melanesian collections are also of strong interest. Begun in 1976 by Ronald and Catherine Berndt, it works in close collaboration with Aboriginal communities.\nLibraries.\nThe University of Western Australia has seven main subject libraries on campus. This includes the architecturally recognised Reid Library building, the largest library on campus with four publicly accessible levels. Five of the libraries are located on campus, with the other two being located within walking distance.\nResidential colleges.\nSeveral residential colleges are located close to the campus, including Currie Hall, St George's College, St Catherine's College, Trinity and St Thomas More College.\nOffsite locations.\nThe university started a UWA Albany Centre in 1999 to meet rural education needs. In 2005, Curtin University of Technology joined UWA in Albany to offer extra courses. UWA Albany has postgraduate coursework and research programs through the Institute for Regional Development and the Centre of Excellence in Natural Resource Management. The UWA Rural Clinical School sends fifth-year medical students to study for a year in Albany, Derby, Broome, Port Hedland, Karratha, Geraldton, Bunbury, Narrogin, Esperance, or Kalgoorlie. The university is also involved in the Combined Universities Centre for Rural Health in Geraldton.\nThe university has other buildings across Stirling Highway in Nedlands. These are linked by pedestrian underpasses beneath the highway, and paths in front of the residential colleges. The university also has buildings in Claremont, purchased in 2005 from Edith Cowan University. The university calls this \"UWA Claremont\". The university remains a single campus institution. UWA Claremont is approximately 5\u00a0km west of the main Crawley campus. Further west still, the university also has staff in central Claremont.\nOverseas, the university has links with institutions in Malaysia and Singapore, where students can study for The University of Western Australia qualifications.\nStudents.\nUWA's students are mainly from Western Australia, and mostly from Perth. In recent years, numbers of full-fee paying foreign students, mainly from Southeast Asia, have grown. In 2008, the university had 3,958 international students, part of a total of 19,000 students.\nInternationalisation.\nThe University of Western Australia has formal agreements with 44 international institutions. It encourages staff and student exchanges, collaborative research and exchange of teaching materials and methods. The university also teaches several of its programmes in Singapore, Indonesia and the Philippines.\nIn May 2010 University joined the Matariki Network of Universities (MNU) together with Dartmouth College (USA), Durham University (UK), Queen\u2019s University (Canada), University of Otago (New Zealand), University of T\u00fcbingen (Germany) and Uppsala University (Sweden).\nResearch strengths.\nThe university has over 80 research centres, including the Crime Research Centre, the Centre for Forensic Science, the Centre for Water Research and the Centre for Oil and Gas Engineering.\nA new project is the Zadko Telescope. A local businessman, James Zadko, and his family gave money to buy a robotically controlled 1-metre modified Ritchey-Chr\u00e9tien telescope (F/4 equatorially mounted flat field). The telescope will built at the UWA's Gravity Discovery Centre and Southern Cross Cosmos Centre 70\u00a0km north of Perth on Wallingup Plain, near the town of Gingin. Working together with the European Union's satellites, it will be used to find major supernovas.\nThe University of Western Australia, with $20 million from the state government, will build an international radio astronomy research centre on UWA's Perth campus. UWA is behind Australia's bid to be the site of the Square Kilometer Array, a very large internationally funded radio astronomy installation capable of seeing the early stages of the formation of galaxies, stars and planets.\nStudent Guild.\nThe UWA Student Guild is the main student group on campus. It is part of the National Union of Students. The Guild provides many services to students, including running cafes and financial help. There are also over 80 clubs and societies paid for by the Guild. The Guild publishes the student newspaper, Pelican, as well as several other publications.\nSport.\nUWA Sports has a recreation centre, a fitness centre, aquatic centre (Human Movement) as well as a watersports complex (on the Swan River), a boat shed, a sports shop and physiotherapy. Off campus they run the UWA Sports Park (MacGillivray Oval) with athletics, baseball, cricket, football, hockey, rugby, soccer and ultimate frisbee fields. The UWA Tennis Centre is next to Challenge Stadium &amp; UWA Sports Park. UWA Shenton Recreation Park also has a gym, indoor sports hall, tennis courts and a hockey turf.\nFamous students.\nUWA has many famous students, particularly in politics and government. The list includes many premiers of Western Australia including Geoff Gallop, Richard Court and Alan Carpenter; former Deputy Prime Minister Kim Beazley, and his father Kim Edward Beazley, and 23rd Prime Minister of Australia Bob Hawke.\nThe university also many famous science and medicine students, including Nobel prize winner Barry Marshall, the Australian of the Year for 2003 Fiona Stanley and the Australian of the Year for 2005 Fiona Wood.\nThe former head of Ansett Airlines and British Airways, Sir Rod Eddington, is a graduate of the UWA School of Engineering.\nSports alumni include former Kookaburras Captain and Hockeyroos Coach Ric Charlesworth.\nPress.\nUWA set up a publishing section in 1935, when the university was the only university in Western Australia.\nPresence in Second Life.\nUWA started a Second Life project in mid-2009. (Second Life is a 3D online virtual world open to the public, free of charge.) By early 2010 it was the most active Second Life project of any Australian university. The UWA site covers three islands (projected to expand), with several models of historic buildings from the Crawley campus, a virtual lecture hall which is used to run real lectures, and a facility where the capabilities of Second Life are being explored for use in scientific visualisation research. During 2009-2010, UWA in Second Life is running a monthly art contest, attracting around 70 artists and many visitors from around the world. Every month a new set of artworks are submitted and the community, together with a judging panel, select winners in a number of categories, who are then awarded cash prizes."}

He is one of the most successful drivers in the history of the Champ Car World Series. He won four championships in a row, from 2004 to 2007.\nHe drove in Formula One for the Toro Rosso team during the 2008 and 2009 seasons. He was unable to repeat his past successes. Bourdais currently drives for Peugeot Sport in the Le Mans Series and for French football club Olympique Lyonnais in the Superleague Formula series.\nEarly years.\nBorn into a racing family, Bourdais began his racing career at age 10 in kart racing. Bourdais progressed to single-seater racing in 1995, finishing 9th in the Formula Campus Championship. He then spent two years in the French Formula Renault Championship. He finished second in points in 1997. In 1998, he won five races to become Rookie of the Year (6th overall) in French F3. He won the series outright in 1999, with eight wins and three poles.\nIn 2000, Bourdais joined the Prost Junior Team in the International F3000 Championship. He finished ninth in the series. In 2001, he moved to the DAMS team and took his first win in the series. He changed teams again for 2002, joing Super Nova Racing. Bordais had three victories and seven pole positions. He won the championship by two points.\nChamp Car career.\nBourdais moved to Champ Car racing in the United States. He and joined Newman-Haas Racing for the 2003 CART World Series season. At St. Petersburg, Florida, Bourdais became the first rookie since Nigel Mansell to claim pole position for his first race. His first Champ Car victory came at Brands Hatch.\nFor 2004, Bourdais dominated the Champ Car series. He had seven wins and eight poles in his Lola. His won his first championship. Bourdais won a fourth consecutive Champ Car title in 2007 with victory at Lexmark Indy 300 on October 21.\nFormula One career.\nToro Rosso.\nOn 16 March 2008 Bourdais competed in his first Formula One Championship race, the Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne. He finished the year in 17th place with four points.\nBourdais tested for the Toro Rosso team during the winter. On 6 February 2009 he was confirmed as a Toro Rosso driver for a second year. He had two points finishes in at the Australian Grand Prix and the Monaco Grand Prix.\nOn 16 July 2009, Toro Rosso announced that Bourdais would no longer be driving for the team. It was reported that Bourdais was thinking about sueing Toro Rosso, claiming that the team breached his contract. It was then reported that Toro Rosso paid him $2.1 million to avoid legal action.\n24 Hours of Le Mans.\nBourdais has frequently raced the famous 24 Hours of Le Mans. He entering for the first time in 1999, at the aged of 20. He drove a Porsche 911 GT2 run by Larbre Competition. He returned in 2000, finishing fourth with Emmanuel Clerico and Olivier Grouillard for the Pescarolo team behind the three dominant Audis.\nHis next three appearances did not go so well. In 2001 his car retired after 271 laps. The next year, he finished ninth in the LMP900 class. He missed the 2003 race and returned in 2004, but his car retired after 282 laps.\nBourdais' next race at Le Mans would come in 2007. He drove a factory-backed Peugeot 908. The car he shared with St\u00e9phane Sarrazin and Pedro Lamy finished the race second. In 2009 he drovr for the Peugeot factory team again. He finished in second place, one lap behind the winning Peugeot. Bourdais was to drive the pole-winning #3 Peugeot in 2010. A suspension failure halted the car before Bourdais could turn a lap in the race\nSuperleague Formula.\nAfter leaving Formula One, Bourdais signed up to drive the Sevilla FC car in the Superleague Formula series. He won on his debut weekend at the 2009 Estoril round in the Super Final. Bourdais won again at the next round, winning race 1 of the 2009 Monza round. He returned for the 2010 season racing for Olympique Lyonnais.\nSports and stock car racing career.\nBourdais made several appearances in other championships.

It is used by holding the free end of the string (usually by inserting one finger in a slip knot) and pulling at it so as to cause the spool to turn while it is hanging in mid-air, either winding or unwinding the string. It first became popular in the 1920s.\nIn the simplest play, the string is wound on the spool by hand. The yo-yo is then thrown downwards, so that it goes down and unwinds the string. It then (by inertia) climbs back, winding the string up. Finally the yo-yo is grabbed, ready to be thrown again. Many other trick plays exist, most based on the basic \"sleeper\" trick.\nOne of the most famous tricks on the yoyo is \"walk the dog\". This is done by throwing a strong sleeper and allowing the yoyo to roll across the floor.\nEnglish historical names for the yo-yo include \"bandalore\" (from French) and \"quiz\". French historical terms include \"bandalore\", \"incroyable\", \"de Coblenz\", \"emigrette\", and \"joujou de Normandie\" (\"joujou\" meaning little toy).\nHistory.\nThe earliest surviving yo-yo dates to 500 BC and was made using terra cotta (clay) disks. A Greek vase painting from this date shows a boy playing yo-yo(see right). Greek records from this time describe toys made out of wood, metal, or painted terra cotta. The terra cotta disks were used to ceremonially offer the toys of youth to certain gods when a child came of age. Disks of other materials were used for actual play. \nPhilippine historical records show that 16th century hunters hiding in trees used a rock tied to a string up to 20 feet in length to throw at wild animals beneath them. The string meant they could get the rock back without having to come down from the tree."}

{"id": "264834", "revid": "966595", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=264834", "title": "Government of Australia", "text": "The Commonwealth of Australia is a federal constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary democracy. The Commonwealth of Australia was formed in 1901 when the six self-governing British colonies, agreed to join together as one nation. These colonies became the six states of Australia. The written agreement is the Australian Constitution. This was written at a Constitutional Convention and voted for by the people of the colonies. \nThe way the Australian Government is organized can be looked at in two ways. The first is federalism which organizes the way powers are distributed between the Australian Government and the state governments. The second is separation of powers into legislative, executive and judiciary branches of government. The Constitution supports the separation of powers in the way it sets out the roles of the branches of government. \nThe Federal Government.\nSection 1 of the Australian Constitution sets up a democratic legislature, the bicameral Parliament of Australia. This is the Queen and two houses, the Senate and the House of Representatives. Section 51 of the Constitution sets out the Commonwealth Government's legislative powers and gives certain powers and responsibilities (known as \"heads of power\") to the federal government. All remaining responsibilities are kept by the six States. Each State has its own constitution, so that Australia has seven sovereign Parliaments, none of which can take over the powers of any other. The High Court of Australia rules on any arguments between the Commonwealth and the States, or among the States, about their powers.\nThe Commonwealth Parliament can propose changes to the Constitution. To become law, the proposals must be put to a referendum of all Australians of voting age. The changes must get a \"double majority\": a majority of all votes, and a majority of votes in a majority of States.\nThe Commonwealth Constitution also says that the States can agree to give any of their powers to the Commonwealth. This can be done by an amendment to the Constitution through a referendum. More commonly, if all the states agree, then all state and Commonwealth parliaments pass laws to allow the transfer. These \"transfer\" laws may have a \"sunset clause\". This is a part of the law that means the law is only in place for a certain time. After this, the original division of powers is put back.\nAustralia has several territories, three of which are self-governing: the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), the Northern Territory (NT) and Norfolk Island. The legislatures of these territories have powers given to them by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth Parliament keeps the power to overturn territorial legislation and to give or take powers. While Australian citizens living in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory are represented in the Commonwealth Parliament, Norfolk Islanders are not.\nAustralia's other territories, (Jervis Bay, Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands) are not self-governing. Instead, these territories are governed by federal laws, with Christmas Island and the Cocos Islands also having local governments. The largely uninhabited Coral Sea Islands was set up as a Territory of the Commonwealth in 1969. The Ashmore and Cartier Islands has been a territory since 1933 run under the laws of the Northern Territory.\nThe federal nature of the Commonwealth and the structure of the Parliament of Australia were the subject of long negotiations among the colonies. The House of Representatives is elected on a basis which shows the different sized populations of the States. So New South Wales has 50 members while Tasmania has only five. But the Senate is elected on a basis of equality among the States: all States have 12 Senators, regardless of population. This was so the Senators of the smaller States could form a majority and change or even reject laws from the House of Representatives. The ACT and the NT elect two senators each.\nThe third level of government after Commonwealth and State/Territory is Local government. These are organized as shires, towns or cities. Local governments are made up of elected representatives (known as either councilor or alderman depending on the State), usually serving on a part-time basis.\nGovernment is undertaken by three inter-connected arms of government:\nThe \"Separation of powers\" is the principle whereby the three arms of government do their activities separate from each other:\nBefore the Australia Act 1986, and matching legislation in the parliament of the United Kingdom, some Australian cases could be sent to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council for final appeal. Australian law is now only decided on in Australia, and the High Court of Australia is the highest court of appeal. The possibility of the British Parliament making laws to overturn the Australian Constitution was also removed.\nLegislature.\nThe Legislature makes the laws, and supervises the activities of the other two arms with a view to changing the laws if needed. The Australian Parliament is bicameral, made up of the Queen, a 76-member Senate and a 150-member House of Representatives. Twelve Senators from each state are elected for six-year terms, using proportional representation and the single transferable vote (known in Australia as \"preferential voting\", with half elected every three years.\nThere are also two senators elected by voters from the Northern Territory (and including the Indian Ocean Territories, Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands). Another two senators are elected by the voters of the Australian Capital Territory (including the Jervis Bay Territory). Senators from the territories are also elected using preferential voting, however, their term of office is not fixed: it starts on the day of a general election for the House of Representatives and ends the day before the next such election day.\nThe members of the House of Representatives are elected by preferential voting from single-member areas spread among the states and territories roughly in proportion to population. In ordinary legislation, the two chambers have the same powers, but all laws for spending money or charging taxes must come from the House of Representatives. In the Westminster system, the leader of the political party or group of parties that holds the support of a majority of the members in the House of Representatives is asked to form a government and is named Prime Minister.\nThe Prime Minister and the Cabinet are responsible to the Parliament, of which they must be members. General elections are held at least once every three years. The Prime Minister can advise the Governor-General to call an election for the House of Representatives at any time, but Senate elections can only be held within certain periods set out in the Constitution. The most recent general election was on 21 August 2010.\nThe Commonwealth Parliament and all the state and territory legislatures use the Westminster system. They have a recognised Leader of the Opposition, usually the leader of the largest party outside the government. There is also a Shadow Cabinet of Opposition members who \"shadow\" each member of the Ministry, asking questions on matters about the Minister's responsibilities. The government, because it has a majority of members in the lower house of the legislature, can usually pass its legislation and control the workings of the house. The Opposition can slow down the process and obstruct government business if it chooses. The day-to-day business of the house is usually worked out between a senior Minister, who holds the title Leader of the House, and an Opposition frontbencher known as the Manager of Opposition Business.\nExecutive.\nHead of state.\nThe Australian Constitution was written in 1901, when the Dominions of the British Empire were not independent countries, and does not use the words \"head of state\". In practice, the role of head of state of Australia is divided between two people, the Queen of Australia and the Governor-General of Australia. The Governor- General is appointed by the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister of Australia. Though in many respects the Governor-General is the Queen's representative, and exercises various constitutional powers in her name, they are also independently vested with many important constitutional powers by the Constitution.\nThe Sovereign of Australia is currently Queen Elizabeth II. She is also the Sovereign of fifteen other Commonwealth Realms including the United Kingdom. Like the other Dominions, Australia gained legislative independence from the Parliament of the United Kingdom through the Statute of Westminster 1931. This came into force in Australia in 1942, but back dated to 3 September 1939. With the Royal Style and Titles Act 1953, the Australian Parliament gave the Queen the title Queen of Australia. In 1973 her Australian title no longer included her status as Queen of the United Kingdom and Defender of the Faith.\nSection 61 of the Constitution says that 'The executive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Queen and is exercisable by the Governor\u2011General as the Queen\u2019s representative, and extends to the execution and maintenance of this Constitution, and of the laws of the Commonwealth'. Section 2 of the Australian Constitution says that a Governor-General shall represent the Queen in Australia. In practice, the Governor-General carries out all the tasks usually done by a head of state, without asking the Queen.\nThe question of whether the Queen is Australia's head of state became a political one during the 1999 Australian republic referendum, when opponents of the move to make Australia a republic claimed that Australia already had an Australian as head of state in the person of the Governor-General, who since 1965 has invariably been an Australian citizen. The former Governor-General, Major General Michael Jeffery, said in 2004: \"Her Majesty is Australia's head of state but I am her representative and to all intents and purposes I carry out the full role.\" However, in 2005, he declined to name the Queen as head of state, instead saying in response to a direct question, \"The Queen is the Monarch and I represent her, and I carry out all the functions of head of state.\" The Governor-General represents Australia internationally, making and receiving State visits.\nIn 2009 Prime Minister Kevin Rudd called the Governor-General the Australian head of state. He said an overseas visit by Quentin Bryce \"...to Africa of this scale by Australia's Head of State will express the seriousness of Australia's commitment\".\nUnder the Westminster system the Governor-General's powers are almost always used on the advice of the Prime Minister or other ministers. The Governor-General retains reserve powers similar to those possessed by the Queen in the United Kingdom. These are rarely exercised, but during the Australian constitutional crisis of 1975 Governor-General Sir John Kerr used them independently of the Queen and the Prime Minister.\nSeveral times people in Australia have wanted to remove the monarchy. In a 1999 referendum, the Australian people voted on a proposal to change the Constitution. The proposal would have removed the Queen from the Constitution and replaced the Governor-General with a President nominated by the Prime Minister, but needing the approval of a two-thirds majority of both Houses of the Parliament. The proposal was defeated. The Australian Republican Movement continues to call for an end to the monarchy in Australia, opposed by Australians for Constitutional Monarchy.\nExecutive Council.\nThe Federal Executive Council consists of the Governor-General, the Prime Minister and Ministers. It is a formal body which exists to give legal effect to decisions made by the Cabinet, and to carry out various other functions. Members of the Executive Council are entitled to be styled \"The Honourable\", a title which they retain for life. The Governor-General usually presides at Council meetings, but a Minister with the title Vice-President of the Executive Council serves as the link between the government and the Council.\nCabinet.\nThe Constitution of Australia does not mention the Cabinet, and its decisions have no legal force. All members of the ministry must be sworn as members of the Federal Executive Council. This council is chaired by the Governor-General and which meets solely to approve and give legal force to decisions already made by the Cabinet. That is why there is always a member of the ministry holding the title Vice-President of the Executive Council.\nUntil 1956 all members of the ministry were members of the Cabinet. With more ministers added in the 1940s and 1950s this made the cabinet too big. In 1956 Robert Menzies created a two level ministry, with only senior ministers in the Cabinet. These are known as the front bench because the sit on the front bench seats in the Parliament. This practice has been continued by all governments except the Whitlam Government.\nWhen the non-Labor parties have been in power, the Prime Minister has made all Cabinet and ministerial appointments. When the Liberal Party and its predecessors (the Nationalist Party and the United Australia Party) have been in coalition with the National Party or its predecessor the Country Party, the leader of the junior Coalition party has had the right decide his party's members of the Coalition ministry, and to work with the Prime Minister to give them their responsibilities.\nWhen the Labor first held office under Chris Watson, Watson used the right to choose members of his Cabinet. In 1907, however, the party decided that future Labor Cabinets would be elected by the members of the Parliamentary Labor Party, the Caucus. The Prime Minister would allocate their responsibilities. The Labor Prime Ministers had a lot of influence over who was elected to Labor ministries, although the leaders small groups inside the party also had a lot of power. Prior to the 2007 general election, Kevin Rudd, said that he and he alone would choose the ministry if he become Prime Minister. His party won the election and he chose the ministry, as he said he would.\nThe cabinet meets not only in Canberra but also in other Australian state capitals, most often Sydney and Melbourne. Kevin Rudd said he wanted the Cabinet to meet in other places, such as major regional cities. The Commonwealth Parliament Offices in Sydney are located in Phillip Street.\nCaretaker governments.\nThere are times when the government acts in a \"caretaker\" capacity, principally in the period prior to and immediately following a general election.\nJudiciary.\nThe Judiciary interprets the laws, using as a basis the laws as enacted and what was said in the Legislature while the laws were being passed.\nReferences.\nFootnotes.\n Before 1931, the junior status of dominions was shown in the fact that it was British ministers who advised the King, with dominion ministers, if they met the King at all, escorted by the constitutionally superior British minister. After 1931 all dominion ministers met the King as \"His\" ministers as of right, equal in Commonwealth status to Britain's ministers, meaning that there was no longer either a requirement for, or an acceptance of, the presence of British ministers. The first state to exercise this both symbolic and real independence was the Irish Free State. Australia and other dominions soon followed."}

{"id": "264838", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=264838", "title": "Statistical process control", "text": "Statistical process control (SPC) is the use of statistical methods to assess the stability of a process and the quality of its outputs. For example, consider a bottling plant. The entire system of production that produces filled bottles is termed a \"process\". Suppose the weight of liquid content added to a bottle is critical for cost control and customer satisfaction. The content should weigh 250 grams, but it is acceptable if the actual weight is between 245 and 255 grams. \"Monitoring\" means that the weight of every bottle is measured and recorded; sampling means that only a few bottles (say one in a thousand) are actually weighed (analysis to determine the rate of sampling and to assess sample representativeness is a well-established part of SPC.)\nSPC relies on quantitative and graphic analysis of measurements to evaluate observed variation. If the attributes of interest (content weight in this example) vary within an acceptable range, a process is said to be \"in control,\" \"in statistical control,\" or \"stable.\" When unacceptable variation is noted, actions are typically taken to determine and correct their cause. In the bottling example, suppose too many bottles are filled with less than 245 grams. Checking the plant equipment reveals that one of ten filler valves is malfunctioning.\nSPC has had broad application in manufacturing since its introduction in the 1920s and in many other kinds of repetitive activities.\nMuch of the power of SPC lies in the ability to examine a process, for the sources of variation in that process, by using tools which give weight to objective analysis over subjective opinions and which allow the strength of each source to be determined numerically. Variations in the process, which might affect the quality of the end-product or service can be detected and corrected, thus reducing waste as well as the likelihood that problems will be passed on to the customer. With its emphasis on early detection and prevention of problems, SPC has a distinct advantage over other quality methods, such as inspection, which apply resources to detecting and correcting problems after they have occurred.\nIn addition to reducing waste, SPC can lead to a reduction in the time required to produce the product or service from end-to-end. This is partially due to a reduced likelihood that the final product will have to be reworked, but it may also result from using SPC data to identify bottlenecks, wait times, and other sources of delays within the process. Process cycle time reductions, coupled with improvements in yield, have made SPC a valuable tool from both a cost-reduction and a customer-satisfaction standpoint.\nHistory.\nStatistical process control was pioneered by Walter A. Shewhart in the early 1920s. Shewhart created the basis for the control chart and the concept of a state of \"statistical control\" by carefully designed experiments. While Dr. Shewhart drew from pure mathematical statistical theories, he understood that data from physical processes seldom produces a \"normal distribution curve\" (a Gaussian distribution, also commonly referred to as a \"bell curve\"). He discovered how the observed variation in manufacturing data did not always behave the same way as data in nature (for example, Brownian motion of particles). Dr. Shewhart concluded that while every process displays variation, some processes display controlled variation that is natural to the process (common causes of variation), while others display uncontrolled variation that is not present in the process causal system at all times (special causes of variation). Uncontrolled variation is often associated with defective products, providing a data-driven means to identify problems and improve quality.\nW. Edwards Deming later applied SPC methods in the U.S. during World War II, thereby successfully improving quality in the manufacture of munitions and other strategically important products. After the war ended, he was instrumental in introducing SPC methods to Japanese industry. Deming's approach of using SPC with related management practices came to be known as a quality management system.\nApplication.\nThe following description relates to manufacturing rather than to the service industry, although the principles of SPC can be successfully applied to either. For a description and example of how SPC applies to a service environment, refer to Roberts (2005). Selden describes how to use SPC in the fields of sales, marketing, and customer service, using Deming's famous Red Bead Experiment as an easy to follow demonstration.\nIn mass-manufacturing, the quality of the finished article was traditionally achieved through post-manufacturing inspection of the product; accepting or rejecting each article (or samples from a production lot) based on how well it met its design specifications. In contrast, Statistical Process Control uses statistical tools to observe the performance of the production process in order to predict significant deviations that may later result in rejected product.\nTwo kinds of variation occur in all manufacturing processes: both these types of process variation cause subsequent variation in the final product. The first is known as natural or common cause variation and consists of the variation inherent in the process as it is designed. Common cause variation may include variations in temperature, properties of raw materials, strength of an electrical current etc. The second kind of variation is known as special cause variation, or assignable-cause variation, and happens less frequently than the first. With sufficient investigation, a specific cause, such as abnormal raw material or incorrect set-up parameters, can be found for special cause variations.\nFor example, a breakfast cereal packaging line may be designed to fill each cereal box with 500\u00a0grams of product, but some boxes will have slightly more than 500\u00a0grams, and some will have slightly less, in accordance with a distribution of net weights. If the production process, its inputs, or its environment changes (for example, the machines doing the manufacture begin to wear) this distribution can change. For example, as its cams and pulleys wear out, the cereal filling machine may start putting more cereal into each box than specified. If this change is allowed to continue unchecked, more and more product will be produced that fall outside the tolerances of the manufacturer or consumer, resulting in waste. While in this case, the waste is in the form of \"free\" product for the consumer, typically waste consists of rework or scrap.\nBy observing at the right time what happened in the process that led to a change, the quality engineer or any member of the team responsible for the production line can troubleshoot the root cause of the variation that has crept in to the process and correct the problem.\nSPC indicates when an action should be taken in a process, but it also indicates when NO action should be taken. An example is a person who would like to maintain a constant body weight and takes weight measurements weekly. A person who does not understand SPC concepts might start dieting every time his or her weight increased, or eat more every time his or her weight decreased. This type of action could be harmful and possibly generate even more variation in body weight. SPC would account for normal weight variation and better indicate when the person is in fact gaining or losing weight.\nBasic Steps of SPC.\nStatistical Process Control may be broadly broken down into three sets of activities: understanding the process; understanding the causes of variation; and elimination of the sources of special cause variation. Key tools in SPC are control charts, a focus on continuous improvement and designed experiments.\nIn understanding a process, the process is typically mapped out and the process is monitored using control charts. Control charts are used to identify variation that may be due to special causes, and to free the user from concern over variation due to common causes. This is a continuous, ongoing activity. When a process is stable and does not trigger any of the detection rules for a control chart, a process-capability analysis may also be performed to predict the ability of the current process to produce conforming (i.e. within specification) product in the future.\nWhen excessive variation is identified by the control-chart detection rules, or the process capability is found lacking, additional effort is exerted to determine causes of that variance. The tools used include Ishikawa diagrams, designed experiments and Pareto charts. Designed experiments are critical to this phase of SPC, as they are the only means of objectively quantifying the relative importance of the many potential causes of variation.\nOnce the causes of variation have been quantified, effort is spent in eliminating those causes that are both statistically and practically significant (i.e. a cause that has only a small but statistically significant effect may not be considered cost-effective to fix; however, a cause that is not statistically significant can never be considered practically significant). Generally, this includes development of standard work, error-proofing and training. Additional process changes may be required to reduce variation or align the process with the desired target, especially if there is a problem with process capability.\nSPC and Software Quality.\nIn 1989, the Software Engineering Institute introduced the notion that SPC can be usefully applied to non-manufacturing processes, such as software-engineering processes, in the Capability Maturity Model (CMM). This idea exists today within the Level 4 and Level 5 practices of the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI). However, this notion that SPC is a useful tool when applied to non-repetitive, knowledge-intensive processes, such as engineering processes, has encountered much skepticism, and remains controversial today. The problem lies in numerous areas of software which are not repetitive, but instead are one-time or one-off aspects of quality, rather than being observed for repeated performance over a long-term view."}

A consultant usually works for a consultancy firm or is self-employed, and engages with multiple and changing clients. Thus, clients have access to deeper levels of expertise than would be feasible for them to retain in-house, and may purchase only as much service from the outside consultant as desired.\n'Consultant' is also the term used to denote the most senior medical position in the United Kingdom, Australia and Ireland (e.g., a consultant surgeon).\nWays in which consultants work.\nSome consultants are employed by a consult staffing company, a company that provides consultants to clients. This is particularly common in the technology sector. Consultants are often called contractors in the technology sector in reference to their employment contract.\nStrategy consultants are common in upper management in many industries.

It is at the mouth of the Gascoyne River on the Indian Ocean. The popular Shark Bay World Heritage Site lies to the south of the town. In 2006, there were 5,283 people living in Carnarvon.\nHistory.\nThe town began in 1883, as a port and supply centre for the surrounding region. It is the administrative centre for the Shire of Carnarvon, the town site was officially listed on 4 June 1891. It was named after Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon, Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies.\nTramways.\nCarnarvon has had three tramways.\nClimate.\nCarnarvon has a warm to hot dry climate. Average yearly rainfall is with the rainiest months being in May and June. Occasionally tropical cyclones will influence Carnarvon and bring very heavy rain, high temperatures and strong winds. Apart from possible cyclones, summers are usually dry. Temperatures range from an average maximum of in February to in July. Average minimums are and respectively.\nMain industries.\nMain industries of the area include:\nDuring the 1960s, NASA set up the Carnarvon Tracking Station to support the Gemini and Apollo space program.

All postcodes in Australia have four numerals and are placed at the end of the address. Australian postcodes are managed by Australia Post.\nPostcodes are published in small books that can be collected from your nearest post offices, or online at the Australia Post website.\nOn envelopes and postcards there are often four square boxes printed in orange ink at the bottom right for the postcode numerals. These are used when addressing mail by hand.\nHistory.\nPostcodes were started in Australia in 1967 by the Postmaster-General's Department (PMG), now called Australia Post. They replaced earlier postal sorting systems, such as Melbourne's letter and number codes (e.g., \"N3\", \"E5\") and a similar system once used in rural and regional New South Wales.\nFormat.\nAustralian Postcodes are four digits, and written after the name of the city, suburb, or town, and the state or territory:\nWhen writing an address by hand, a row of four boxes (pre-printed on the lower right hand corner of many envelopes) is usually used.\nGeography.\nAustralian postcodes are sorting information. They are often linked with one area (e.g. 6160 belongs only to Fremantle, Western Australia). But sometimes they can be quite complex, especially in country areas (e.g. 2570 belongs to twenty-two towns and suburbs around Camden, New South Wales). The south-western Victoria 3221 postcode of the Geelong Mail Centre also includes twenty places around Geelong with very few people. This means that mail for these places is not fully sorted until it gets to Geelong. Some postcodes cover large populations (e.g., postcode 4350 serving some 100,000 people in the City of Toowoomba), while other postcodes have much smaller populations, even in urban areas. The postcode numbers range from as low as 0200 (for the Australian National University) to 9729 (mail addressed to the Gold Coast City Council).\nSome towns and suburbs have two postcodes\u2014one for street deliveries and one for [post office box]es. For instance, a street address in the Sydney suburb of Parramatta would be written like this:\nBut mail sent to a PO Box in Parramatta would be addressed:\nMany big businesses, government departments and other institutions receive large volumes of mail. They can have their own postcode as a Large Volume Receiver (\"LVR\"), e.g. the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital has the postcode 4029. More postcode ranges were made available for LVRs in the 1990s.\nAllocation.\nAustralia States and territories.\nThe first one or two numerals usually show the state or territory to which the postcode belongs\nSometimes near the state and territory borders, Australia Post finds it easier to send mail through a nearby post office that is across the border:\nThese are postcodes that do not follow the above rule. \n3691\nSome or all of the postcodes above may cover two states. For example postcode 2620 covers both a suburb in NSW (\"Gundaroo\") as well as a suburb in the ACT (\"Hume\") - the postcode is within the ACT range.\nJervis Bay Territory, once an exclave of the ACT but now a separate territory, is geographically located on the coast of NSW. It is just south of the towns of Vincentia and Huskisson, with which it shares a postcode. Mail to the Jervis Bay Territory is still addressed to the ACT.\nThe numerals used to show the state on each radio callsign in Australia are the same numerals as the first numerals for postcodes in that state, e.g. \"2xx\" in New South Wales, \"3xx\" in Victoria, etc. Radio callsigns pre-date postcodes in Australia by more than 40 years.\nExternal territories.\nAustralia's external territories are also included in Australia Post's postcode system. While these territories do not belong to any state, they are addressed as such for mail sorting:\nThree scientific bases in Antarctica operated by the Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions share a postcode with the isolated sub-Antarctic island of Macquarie Island (part of Tasmania):\nState and territory capital cities.\nEach state's capital city ends with three zeroes, while territorial capital cities end with two zeroes. Capital city postcodes were the lowest postcodes in their state or territory range, before new ranges for LVRs and PO Boxes were made available. The last numeral can usually be changed from \"0\" to \"1\" to get the postcode for General Post Office boxes in any capital city (though Perth now uses a different range of postcodes for its GPO Boxes):\nAllocation within states.\nWhile the first numeral of a postcode usually shows the state or territory, the second numeral usually shows a region within the state. However, postcodes with the same second numeral are not always next to each othera. As an example, postcodes in the range 2200\u20130001 are split between the southern suburbs of Sydney and the Central Coast of New South Wales.\nPostcodes with a second numeral of \"0\" or \"1\" are almost always located within the metropolitan area of the state's capital city. Postcodes with higher second numerals are usually located in rural and regional areas. Common exceptions are where towns were rural when postcodes were first introduced in 1967, but have since been suburbanised and incorporated into metropolitan areas, e.g. Penrith, New South Wales has the postcode 2750 and Petrie, Queensland has the postcode 4502.\nWithin each region with the same second numeral, postcodes usually get bigger the further one travels from the state's capital city along major highways and railways. For instance, heading north on the North Coast railway in New South Wales away from Sydney:\nMajor towns and cities.\nMajor towns and cities tend to have \"0\" as the last numeral or last two numerals, e.g. Rockhampton, Queensland has the postcode 4700 and Ballarat, Victoria has the postcode 3350. There are exceptions; the major town of Ipswich, Queensland has the postcode 4305, while Goodna, a relatively unimportant suburb of Ipswich, is allocated 4300.\nPostcode squares.\nPost Office Preferred envelopes sold in Australia have four boxes in the bottom right corner of the front of the envelope. These boxes or squares, which by Australia Post calls \"postcode squares\", have the postcode for hand-addressed mail. This is for the purpose of Australia Post's automated mail-sorting equipment, which uses optical character recognition software. Postcode squares were introduced in 1990.\nAustralia Post says that postcode squares should not be used for machine-addressed mail, or mail going overseas.\nOther uses.\nMany other organisations now use postcodes. Insurance companies often use postcodes when working out the cost of car and house insurance. The NSW Ministry of Transport uses postcodes to give specific numbers for each bus stop in Greater Sydney. The stop number is five to seven numbers: the first four are the postcode, and the others show the bus stop (sometimes written with a space in between, e.g. \"2000 108\"). Many companies that produce metropolitan street maps also list the postcodes for each suburb, both in indexes on the maps themselves.\nMechanised sorting.\nTo improve mechanised sorting, each address now has a sorting number which is printed on the letter as an orange coloured barcode. This number might be 12 numbers long. This system enables the post office to place items in delivery order."}

The profession exists in both the private and public sectors. The core of that work is to measure, interpret, and describe some events in the world and spot patterns within them. The field shares much common history with social science, but often with a greater view on complex mathematical methods. Statisticians commonly have higher college degrees or other credentials as proof that they are qualified for the job.\nIt is common to combine statistical knowledge with expertise in other subjects. The applications are varied. Statisticians apply their knowledge to production, research, finance, medicine, insurance, census-taking, government, etc. They often are employed to support managerial decisions or to supervise quality control in manufacturing. \nNature of the work.\nAccording to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of 2008, there were 22,600 jobs listed as \"statistician\" in the United States. Of these people, approximately 30% worked for governments (federal, state, or local). Additionally, there are substantial numbers of persons who use statistics in their work but have job titles other than \"statistician\". The job of statistician is considered a profession. Most statisticians work in offices and have regular working hours and can therefore be considered to be white-collar workers. A lower number of statisticians are self-employed as statistical consultants.\nMost employment as a statistician requires a minimum of a masters degree in statistics or a related field. Many professional statisticians have a PhD.\nHistory.\nCivilizations have used the work of statisticians for thousands of years. Statistics was employed in ancient Egypt in censuses of population and cattle.

A sequel to 2008's \"Kung Fu Panda\", Jack Black reprised his role. In the movie, Po is now the Dragon Warrior, and is fighting with his fellow kung fu masters, the Furious Five: Tigress, Viper, Monkey, Mantis and Crane. They go on a quest in Gong-men City to stop Lord Shen, an evil albino peacock from using a weapon to destroy kung fu. The film is directed by Jennifer Yuh Nelson, who previously worked as a storyboard artist in \"Kung Fu Panda 1\". It received critical acclaim and is the highest-grossing movie to be directed by a woman.\nPlot.\nPo (voiced by Jack Black) is now the Dragon Warrior and a Kung Fu master protecting the Valley of Peace together with his friends, the Furious Five, but must now find inner peace. Master Shifu (voiced by Dustin Hoffman) then sends him on a journey with the Furious Five to Gongmen City and stop Lord Shen (voiced by Gary Oldman), an evil albino peacock who has made a new weapon that can stop Kung Fu. Po has trouble on his journey because he's worried about what happened to his real parents. An old soothsayer (voiced by Michelle Yeoh) helps Po remember that his parents sent Po away as a baby to protect him when their village was attacked by Lord Shen many years ago because Shen learned he would be defeated by Po, the foretold warrior of black and white. Now knowing where he came from, Po finds inner peace, destroys Shen's cannons by throwing the cannonballs back at them, defeats Shen (who also gets killed and crushed by his own cannon), and accepts Mr. Ping (voiced by James Hong) as his dad.\nReception.\nCritical Response.\n\"Kung Fu Panda 2\" was acclaimed by critics. It holds a rating of 85% in Rotten Tomatoes and a rating of 7 out of 10.

The experiment ran from 15-21 August 1971, led by Dr Philip Zimbardo at Stanford University. In the experiment, 24 student volunteers were assigned to be either a \u2018guard\u2019 or a \u2018prisoner\u2019 in a fake prison at the flip of a coin, and Zimbardo was the . They were paid 15$ a day. The experiment was intended to run for 2 weeks, but some of the guards quickly became authoritarian and began psychologically torturing the prisoners, and the experiment had to be stopped after only 6 days. 5 prisoners left the experiment early, after having severe psychological stress. Zimbardo concluded that certain situations can cause good people to behave in a way that they normally would not have predicted. \nThe Stanford Prison Experiment is used in many introductory psychology textbooks to show the impact of power and authority on human behaviour. The experiment is controversial for a few reasons: , which causes the participants to behave in the way they think the researcher wants them to behave. There are other ethical issues with the SPE, and Zimbardo has been criticised for interpreting the results to fit his previous expectations. \nPsychological themes.\nThe experiment also had certain problems:\nMethods.\nZimbardo and his colleagues made an advert in the Palo Alto City newspaper for a study of the psychological effects of prison life on college students. The participants were to be paid 15$ a day. They did psychological tests and interviews to make sure that the participants were psychologically healthy, with no history of crime or drug abuse or any medical disabilities. The 24 participants were randomly assigned to either be a \u2018guard\u2019 or a \u2018prisoner\u2019 based on a coin flip. \nThey made the fake prison in the basement of the Stanford Psychology Department building. There was a closet which they called \u2018the hole\u2019, which served as solitary confinement. There were no windows or clocks, which meant the 'prisoners' had time-altering experiences. Three 'prisoners' were in each of the three cells (offices). \nThe \u2018prisoners\u2019 were arrested and held in the detention cells of the Palo Alto Police Department, then escorted to the \u2018Stanford County Jail\u2019. Upon arrival, they were stripped naked, deloused, and given a uniform. The uniform was a dress with no underclothes, a chain around their ankle, stocking caps to mimic a prisoner\u2019s shaved head, and they were each assigned a prison number which became their new 'name'. The 'guards' had a uniform of khaki, a baton, reflective sunglasses (to make them more anonymous), and a whistle around their neck.\nThe 'guards' worked on eight hour shifts, with three 'guards' working at any one time. The 'prisoners' had to perform 'counts' several times a day and night, where they had to call their prison number out loud, to enforce the feeling of authority from the guards. The experiment was intended to run for two weeks, but after 6 days had to be abandoned because the guards became more abusive towards the prisoners.\nCriticism and response.\nDemand characteristics.\nThe SPE has been criticised for having strong , which is where participants act the way they think the researchers want them to act. In an experiment to test the extent of the demand characteristics in the SPE, Banauzzi and Mohavedi asked 150 students to predict the results of the SPE, and 89.9% predicted that the 'guards' would act in an oppressive, hostile nature towards the 'prisoners'. So, the participants in the experiment could also have predicted how they were supposed to act, and act in this way, to please the researchers. \nIn his book, , Zimbardo explained that he told the participants how they were supposed to behave:We can create boredom. We can create a sense of frustration. We can create fear in them, to some degree. We can create a notion of the arbitrariness that governs their lives, which are totally controlled by us, by the system, by you, me.\u2026They\u2019ll have no privacy at all, there will be constant surveillance\u2014nothing they do will go unobserved. They will have no freedom of action. They will be able to do nothing and say nothing that we don\u2019t permit. We\u2019re going to take away their individuality in various ways.\u2026In general, what all this should create in them is a sense of powerlessness. We have total power in the situation. They have none. (pp. 55)The fact that Zimbardo was both the head researcher and the prison superintendent added to the demand characteristics because the 'guards' wanted to please the 'superintendent', and the overlap between the superintendent and the head psychologist means the participants would have have followed demand characteristics more strongly.\nPeter Gray publicly stated why he hasn\u2019t included the SPE in his introductory psychology textbooks, explaining that by remaining silent when the guards abused the prisoners, Zimbardo was approving of their methods of intimidation. And the guards who were less assertive were instructed to be \u2018tougher\u2019- For example, Warden Jaffe (one of Zimbardo\u2019s student research associates) said to one of the \u2018nicer\u2019 guards,\u201cThe guards have to know that every guard has to be what we call a \u2018tough guard.\u2019 The success of this experiment rides on the behavior of the guards to make it seem as realistic as possible\u201d (pp. 65)There was direct instruction to behave more assertively, and approval of the behaviour of the 'tough guards'. \nSituationist interpretation of results.\nAbout a third of the guards became , authoritarian guards. 2/3 of the 11 guards acted in a humane way, which critics argue goes against Zimbardo's interpretation of the results that good people can turn evil in the right environment.\nMovies about the events.\nThere has been a lot of interest for the events in the media.

It was created by Ross Bagdasarian, Sr. in 1958. The group is made up of three animated chipmunks who sing and talk. They are Alvin, Simon and Theodore. The trio is managed by a fictional man named Dave Seville, who adopted the chipmunks. In reality, \"David Seville\" was Bagdasarian's stage name, and the chipmunks themselves are named after the executives of their original record label. The characters became a success, and were recreated in animated cartoons and eventually movies.\nThe voices of the group were all done by Bagdasarian. He recorded his voice and then sped up the playback to create high-pitched voices. It was so unusual and well-done that it earned the record two Grammy Awards for musical engineering. Bagdasarian, performing as the Chipmunks, released a long series of albums and singles. Bagdasarian died in 1972. The characters were revived in the 1980s and 1990s, with the voices being performed by Ross Bagdasarian, Jr. and his wife Janice Karman.\nA computer-animated movie based on the characters was released in 2007, called \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\". It had three sequels: , and . The actors Justin Long, Matthew Gray Gubler and Jesse McCartney performed the talking voices of the Chipmunks. Bagdasarian, Jr. and Karman performed the singing voices for Alvin, Theodore and the Chipettes, but Steve Vining does Simon's singing voice. The project has earned five Grammy Awards, an American Music Award, a Golden Reel Award, and three Kids' Choice Awards, and has been nominated for three Emmy awards."}

The team was founded by former F1 driver Aguri Suzuki. They were based in Tokyo, Japan. They operated from the former Arrows factory in Leafield, UK. The cars were called Super Aguri-Honda because they used Honda engines. The team was, to some degree, an unofficial Honda second-team. In Japan, public pressure convinced Honda to help its former driver Takuma Sato to continue in Formula One. This lead to the start of Super Aguri F1, and the engine supply from Honda. The team competed two full years, and part of the third year. After four races in the season, the team withdrew due to financial problems.\nTeam creation.\nThe team started in September 2005. on 1 November 2005, the team told the FIA its wanted to enter the Formula One World Championship. The FIA did not approved Super Aguri's entry. It was reported that the team failed to give the required $48 million entry bond on time. Super Aguri applied for entry again in 2006. Because they missed the initial registration, the team needed the existing ten teams to agree to its entry. The other teams gave the required unanimous agreement. Super Aguri was confirmed by the FIA on 26 January 2006.\nRacing History.\nIn 2006, the chassis, Super Aguri SA05, was based on the 2002 Arrows A23. The Arrows chassis was bought from ex-Minardi principal Paul Stoddart.Stoddart had bought them when the Arrows team went bankrupt. Super Aguri updated their old chassis to become the Super Aguri SA06. They were used from the German Grand Prix to the end of the year.\nTakuma Sato and Yuji Ide were the initial race drivers for the team in the 2006 season. Franck Montagny as the third driver. On 4 May, after four races, the team announced that Montagny would be replacing Ide as race driver. Ide's Super Licence had been revoked after a clash with Christijan Albers.\nFor , Super Aguri announced Takuma Sato and Anthony Davidson would be driving for the team.\nWhen the new SA07 car was first tested by the FIA, it failed the crash test. It was less than 48 hours before the first practice session for the Australian Grand Prix that the SA07 chassis was ready. At the Spanish Grand Prix the team scored its first point. Takuma Sato finished in 8th place. At the Canadian Grand Prix, the team scored its highest finish. Sato finishing in sixth place and earned three points.\nFor , Super Aguri kept their drivers Takuma Sato and Anthony Davidson following the acquisition of an unspecified portion of the team by the Magma Group became a part owner of the team. The team did not attend the final pre-season tests. Not all the parts had arrived. Magma canceled their proposed purchase, leaving Super Aguri's future in doubt. Super Aguri's equipment was denied entry to Istanbul Park for the Turkish Grand Prix. Honda Racing's CEO Nick Fry reportedly told the race organizers that Super Aguri would not be taking part. On 6 May 2008, team founder and principal Aguri Suzuki announced that they were withdrawing from the 2008 World Championship due to financial problems. He said the breach of contract by \"SS United Group Oil &amp; Gas Company\" resulting in the loss of financial backing. The team was in financial difficulties.\nA team of corporate recovery partners were appointed to seek a buyer for Super Aguri. The team's assets were bought by a German businessman named Franz Hilmer. Hilmer unsuccessfully to enter the season under the Brabham name.\nComplete Formula One results.\n Team withdrew from championship after race 4.

In arguments, \"compromise\" is a concept of finding agreement through communication, through a mutual acceptance of terms, while often involving variations from an original goal or desire. \nExtremism is often considered as antonym to compromise, which, depending on context, may be associated with concepts of balance or tolerance. In the negative connotation, compromise may be referred to as \"capitulation\", referring to a \"surrender\" of objectives, principles, or material, in the process of negotiating an agreement. In human relationships, \"compromise\" is frequently said to be an agreement that no party is happy with, this is because the parties involved often feel that they either gave away too much or that they received too little.\nFrom cultural background and influences, the meaning and perception of the word \"compromise\" may be different: In the UK, Ireland and Commonwealth countries, the word \"compromise\" has a positive meaning (as a consent, an agreement where both parties win something); in the U.S., it can have rather negative connotations, as in \"compromising principles\" as a sell-out of basic beliefs.\nStudies in compromise.\nDefining and finding the best possible compromise is an important problem in fields like game theory and the voting system.\nResearch has indicated that less-than-optimal compromises are often the result of negotiators failing to realize when they have interests that are completely compatible with those of the other party, and hence, they settle for suboptimal agreements. Mutually-better outcomes can often be found by careful study of both parties' interests, especially if done early in negotiations. "}

For some groups, this can involve the supernatural or use of mind-altering drugs.\nA visionary state can be achieved via meditation, drugs, lucid dreams, daydreams, or art. One example is Hildegard of Bingen, a 12th century artist/visionary and Catholic saint. Other visionaries in religion are Mohammed (who had a vision of and communed with the Angel Gabriel), St. Bernadette (who had a vision of contact with the Blessed Virgin), and Joseph Smith (who had a vision of contact with the Angel Moroni).\nExtended meanings.\nA \"vision\" can be political, religious, environmental, social, or technological in nature. By extension, a \"visionary\" can also be a person with a clear, distinctive and specific (in some details) vision of the future, usually connected with advances in technology or social/political arrangements. For example, Ted Nelson or U.S. Vice President Al Gore is referred to as a visionary in connection with the Internet.\nOther visionaries simply imagine what does not yet exist but might some day, as some forms of \"visioning\" (or gazing) can provide a glimpse into the possible future. Therefore, visioning can mean seeing in a utopian way what does not yet exist on earth, but might exist in another realm, such as the ideal or perfect realm as imagined or thought. Examples are Buckminster Fuller in architecture and design, and some of the pioneers of personal computing such as Steve Wozniak. Some people use mathematics to make visionary discoveries in the nature of the universe. In that sense, a visionary may also function as a secular prophet. Some visionaries emphasize communication, and some assume a figurehead role in organizing a social group.\nIn art.\nArtists may produce work loosely categorized as visionary art for its luminous content and/or for its use of artistic techniques that call for the use of extended powers of perception in the viewer: (e.g. Gustave Moreau, Samuel Palmer, Jean Delville, Ernst Fuchs, the French Symbolist Odilon Redon, Brion Gysin, Max Ernst, Stanley Spencer, Edward Burne Jones, Adolf Wolfli, Fred Sandback, William Blake, Hieronymus Bosch, and Henry Darger).\nVisionary art can be incorrectly defined as a category of primitive art (art of those not formally trained) rather than describing people who have used their visions (or dreams) to create their paintings. Salvador Dali is one artist who would exemplify visionary art that is neither religious nor primitive."}

He coined the terms \"hypertext\" and \"hypermedia\" in 1963 and published it in 1965. He also is credited with first use of the words \"transclusion\", \"virtuality\", \"intertwingularity\" and \"teledildonics\". The main thrust of his work has been to make computers easily accessible to ordinary people. His motto is: \"A user interface should be so simple that a beginner in an emergency can understand it within ten seconds.\" However, he is known for inventing many new words (neologisms) which few other people understand (such as \"intertwingularity\"), and his remarks contain humor to entertain rather than just inform. Consequently, some of his ideas have been met with negative reactions.\nFrom a pessimist viewpoint, Ted Nelson promotes four maxims: \"most people are fools, most authority is malignant, God does not exist, and everything is wrong\".\nCareer.\nNelson started Project Xanadu in 1960. He wanted to create a new computer network that was easy to use and easy to understand. He wrote about the project in his books \"Computer Lib/Dream Machines\" (1974) and \"Literary Machines\" (1981). He has spent much of his adult life working on Project Xanadu and telling people about its benefits.\nThe Xanadu project was not very successful. There were many reasons, but not everyone agrees why the project did not go well. Journalist Gary Wolf published an unflattering history, \"The Curse of Xanadu\", on Nelson and his project in the June 1995 issue of \"Wired\". Nelson expressed his disgust on his website, referring to Wolf as a \"Gory Jackal\", and threatened to sue him. He also outlined his objections in a letter to \"Wired\", and released a detailed rebuttal of the article.\nNelson says that Tim Berners-Lee made some ideas from Xanadu become true by inventing the World Wide Web. But, Nelson dislikes the World Wide Web, XML, and all embedded markup. Nelson thinks that Berners-Lee's work is a much too simple way of doing his original plan:\nHTML is precisely what we were trying to PREVENT\u2013 ever-breaking links, links going outward only, quotes you can't follow to their origins, no version management, no rights management. \u2013 Ted Nelson (Ted Nelson one-liners )\nNelson co-founded Itty bitty machine company, or \"IBM\", which was a small computer retail store operating from 1977 to 1980 in Evanston, Illinois. The Itty bitty machine company was one of the few retail stores to sell the original Apple I computer. In 1978 he had a significant impact upon IBM's thinking when he outlined his vision of the potential of personal computing to the team that three years later launched the IBM PC.\nTed Nelson is currently working on a new information structure, ZigZag. More information about ZigZag is on the Xanadu project website. That website also has two versions of the Xanadu code that visitors can download. He is also currently developing XanaduSpace - a system for the exploration of connected parallel documents (an early version of this software may be freely downloaded from . He is a visiting fellow at Oxford University - based at the Oxford Internet Institute - where he works in the fields of information, computers, and human-machine interfaces.\nEducation and awards.\nNelson earned a Bachelor's degree in philosophy from Swarthmore College in 1959, a Master's degree in sociology from Harvard University in 1963 and a Doctorate in Media and Governance from Keio University in 2002.\nIn 1998, at the Seventh WWW Conference in Brisbane, Australia, Ted Nelson was awarded the Yuri Rubinsky Memorial Award. He told the audience that it was the first award that he had ever received for his work.\nIn 2001 he was knighted by France as \"Officier des Arts et Lettres\". In 2004 he was appointed as a Fellow of Wadham College, Oxford, and associated with the Oxford Internet Institute, where he is currently conducting his research.\nIn 2007 he celebrated his 70th birthday by giving an invited birthday lecture at the University of Southampton.\nPersonal life.\nHe is the son of the late Emmy Award-winning director Ralph Nelson and the Academy Award-winning actress Celeste Holm.\nHis parents' marriage was brief, and he was mostly raised by his grandparents in Greenwich Village, with relatively little contact with his parents. He is partly of Norwegian descent.\nPopular culture.\nThe anime \"Serial Experiments Lain\" cites Project Xanadu as a precursor to The Wired (a fictional internet-like communications network and augmented reality system) and mentions Nelson as the originator of hypertext.\nPopulitism.\n\"Populitism\" (\"pop-u-leet-ism\") is another neologism coined by Nelson, as a combination of the word \"populism\" with \"elite\". It refers to treating the general populace with the privileges of elitism. The word suggests the society-of-text envisioned by theorists like Shoshana Zuboff and Jay David Bolter, a writing space in which traces of authority persist only as local and contingent effects, the social equivalent of the deconstructed author-function. A \"populite\" culture might mark the first step toward realization of Jean-Francois Lyotard's \"game of perfect information\" where all have equal access to the world of data, and where \"[g]iven equal competence (no longer in the acquisition of knowledge, but in its production), what extra performativity depends on in the final analysis is 'imagination,' which allows one either to make a new move or change the rules of the game.\" This is the utopia of information-in-process, the ultimate wetware dream of the clerisy: discourse converted with 100 percent efficiency into capital, the mechanism of that magical process being nomology or rule-making\u2014admittedly a rather specialized form of \"imagination.\""}

The word is based on the idea of using a gunny sack (burlap bag) storing a number of items.\nA typical example might occur in a marriage facing occasional difficulty. Partners may have small grievances or annoyances, which by themselves are not critical. However, over time one partner gets less happy and more annoyed. Then some incident occurs, and a full-blown argument follows. By analogy, this is the gunny sack bursting, with an 'overblown reaction'.\nThe term may also refer to bringing up past grievances when trying to resolve some present problem in a relationship. In which case, gunnysacking (as a tactic) has the dual effect of raising additional problems (in what is typically already a volatile, difficult situation) and presents a side-track obstacle to dealing with the current issues. Additionally, once the practice becomes a familiar pattern used by one person in a relationship, other persons may avoid reporting new issues or problems for the sake of avoiding a repeat of the gunnysacking behavior."}
{"id": "264944", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=264944", "title": "Conflict resolution", "text": "Conflict resolution is a set of ideas and ways to reduce sources of conflict. The term \"conflict resolution\" is sometimes used interchangeably with the term \"dispute resolution\". The terms \"conflict\" and \"dispute\" overlap. As a term, conflict is broader than dispute, more concerned with physical action, and less concerned with verbal arguments.\nProcesses of conflict resolution generally include negotiation, mediation, and diplomacy. The processes of arbitration, litigation, and formal complaint processes such as ombudsman processes, are usually described with the term dispute resolution, although some refer to them as \"conflict resolution\".\nCulture-based.\nConflict resolution as both a professional practice and academic field is highly sensitive to cultural background. In Western cultural contexts, such as Canada and the United States, successful conflict resolution usually involves fostering communication among disputants and problem solving that meet their underlying needs. In these situations, conflict resolvers often talk about finding the \"win-win\" solution, or mutually satisfying scenario, for everyone involved (see Fisher and Ury (1981), \"Getting to Yes\"). \nIn many non-Western cultural contexts, such as Afghanistan, Vietnam, and China, it is also important to find \"win-win\" solutions; however, getting there can be very different. In these contexts, direct communication between disputants that explicitly addresses the issues at stake in the conflict can be perceived as very rude, making the conflict worse and delaying resolution. Rather, it can make sense to involve religious, tribal or community leaders, communicate difficult truths indirectly through a third party, and make suggestions through stories (see David Augsberger (1992), \"Conflict Mediation Across Cultures\"). Intercultural conflicts are often the most difficult to resolve because the expectations of the disputants can be very different, and there is much occasion for misunderstanding.\nIn animals.\nConflict resolution has also been studied in non-humans, like dogs, cats, monkeys, snakes, elephants, and primates (see Frans de Waal, 2000). Aggression is more common among animal relatives and within a group, than between groups. Instead of creating a distance between the individuals, however, the primates were more intimate in the period after the aggressive incident. These intimacies consisted of grooming and various forms of body contact. Stress responses, like an increased heart rate, usually decrease after these reconciliatory signals. Different types of primates, as well as many other species who are living in groups, show different types of conciliatory behaviour. Resolving conflicts that threaten the interaction between individuals in a group is necessary for survival, hence has a strong evolutionary value. These findings contradicted previous existing theories about the general function of aggression, i.e. creating space between individuals (first proposed by Konrad Lorenz), which seems to be more the case in conflicts between groups than it is within groups.\nIn addition to research in primates, biologists are beginning to explore reconciliation in other animals. Up until recently, the literature dealing with reconciliation in non-primates have consisted of anecdotal observations and very little quantitative data. Although peaceful, post-conflict behavior had been documented going back to the 1960s, it was not until 1993 that Rowell made the first explicit mention of reconciliation in feral sheep. Reconciliation has since been documented in spotted hyenas, lions, dolphins, dwarf mongooses, domestic goats, and domestic dogs.\nCareers.\nConflict resolution is an expanding field of professional practice, both in the U.S. and around the world. The escalating costs of conflict have increased use of third parties who may serve as arbitrators, mediators, facilitators, and ombudsmen or conflict specialists to resolve conflicts. In fact, relief and development organizations have added peace-building specialists to their teams. Also, many of the major international NGOs have seen a growing need to hire practitioners trained in conflict analysis and resolution. Furthermore, this expansion of the field has resulted in the need for conflict resolution practitioners to work in a variety of settings such as in businesses, court systems, government agencies nonprofit organizations, government agencies and educational institutions serving throughout the world.\nEducation.\nUniversities worldwide offer programs of study pertaining to conflict research, analysis, and practice. The Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations (ILR) houses the Scheinman Institute on Conflict Resolution, which offers undergraduate, graduate, and professional training on conflict resolution. Additional graduate programs are offered at Georgetown University, Eastern Mennonite University and Trinity College Dublin. George Mason University\u2019s Institute of Conflict Analysis and Resolution offers undergraduate, certificate and masters programs in Conflict Analysis and Resolution and a Ph.D. program in The Philosophy in Conflict and Conflict Resolution.\n Many students completing a doctoral program enter the field as researchers, theorists, analysts, policy makers and professors in higher education.\nFurthermore, the Pax Ludens Foundation based in the Netherlands is an organization that puts together conflict resolution simulations set in an International Relations scenario to help students learn about the intricacies of where conflict emerges in the world of international politics.\nConflict resolution is a growing area of interest in UK pedagogy, with teachers and students both encouraged to learn about mechanisms that lead to aggressive action, and those that lead to peaceful resolution. \nIn many schools in the UK, conflict resolution has now become an integral part of the SEAL (Social and Emotional Aspects of Learning) programme, chiming,as it does, with the SEAL principles of developing social skills and an understanding of ones own feelings.\nIn India, masters in conflict analysis and peace building is offered by Nelson Mandela Centre for Peace, in Jamia Millia Islamia university in New Delhi."}

He won three Interzonal tournaments: Amsterdam 1964, Sousse 1967, and Biel 1976. Larsen won several dozen major international tournaments during his career, and was awarded the first Chess Oscar in 1967. At his best he was rated (FIDE rating list) fourth in the world.\nLarsen was the strongest chess player born in Denmark, and the strongest Scandinavian until the emergence of Magnus Carlsen. From the early 1970s, he lived for part of the year in Las Palmas, and in Buenos Aires, with his Argentinian-born wife.\nOlympiad performances.\nBent represented Denmark six times in Chess Olympiads, always on first board, and compiled an aggregate score of 75/109 (+61 =28 \u221220), for 68.8%, according to olimpbase.org. He always played a very high number of games, almost all of the rounds, and won three board medals, one gold and two bronze.\nDisaster in Denver.\nThe worst result of his career was his 6\u20130 defeat by Bobby Fischer in the semi-finals of the Candidates matches in 1971. The match was played in Denver, Colorado. Larsen later claimed in a Kasparov.com interview (1998) that his one-sided loss to Fischer was due in part to his condition during the match: \"The organizers chose the wrong time for this match. I was languid with the heat and Fischer was better prepared for such exceptional circumstances... I saw chess pieces through a mist and, thus, my level of playing was not good\". Fischer was the great player of the day, and went on to beat Spassky in 1972 for the World Championship."}

Google search was originally developed by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 1997, based on earlier search-engine designs.\nGoogle Search provides at least 22 special features beyond the original word-search capability. These include synonyms, weather forecasts, time zones, stock quotes, maps, earthquake data, movie showtimes, airports, home listings, and sports results. (\"see below:\" Special features).

Google Search provides many options for customized search (\"see below:\" Search options), using Boolean operators such as: exclusion (\"-xx\"), inclusion (\"+xx\"), alternatives (\"xx OR yy\"), and wildcard (\"x * x\").\nSearch engine.\nPageRank.\nGoogle's rise to success was in large part due to a patented algorithm called PageRank that helps rank web pages that match a given search string.\nPrevious keyword-based methods of ranking search results, used by many search engines that were once more popular than Google, would rank pages by how often the search terms occurred in the page, or how strongly associated the search terms were within each resulting page.\nThe PageRank algorithm instead analyses human-generated links, assuming that web pages linked from many important pages are themselves likely to be important. The algorithm computes a recursive score for pages, based on the weighted sum of the PageRanks of the pages linking to them. PageRank is thought to correlate well with human concepts of importance.\nIn addition to PageRank, Google over the years has added many other secret criteria for determining the ranking of pages on result lists, reported to be over 200 different indicators. The details are kept secret due to spammers and in order to maintain an advantage over Google's competitors.\nSearch results.\nThe exact percentage of the total of web pages that Google indexes is not known, as it is very hard to actually calculate.\nGoogle not only indexes and caches web pages but also takes \"snapshots\" of other file types, which include PDF, Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, Flash SWF, plain text files, and so on. Except in the case of text and SWF files, the cached version is a conversion to (X)HTML, allowing those without the corresponding viewer application to read the file.\nUsers can customize the search engine, by setting a default language, using the \"SafeSearch\" filtering technology and set the number of results shown on each page. Google has been criticized for placing long-term cookies on users' machines to store these preferences, a tactic which also enables them to track a user's search terms and retain the data for more than a year. For any query, up to the first 1000 results can be shown with a maximum of 100 displayed per page. The ability to specify the number of results is available only if \"Instant Search\" is not enabled. If \"Instant Search\" is enabled, only 10 results are displayed, regardless of this setting.\nNon-indexable data.\nDespite its immense index, there is also a considerable amount of data available in online databases which are accessible by means of queries but not by links. This so-called invisible or deep Web is minimally covered by Google and other search engines. The deep Web contains library catalogs, official legislative documents of governments, phone books, and other content which is dynamically prepared to respond to a query.\nPrivacy in some countries forbids the showing of some links. For instance in Switzerland any individual can force Google Inc. to delete a link which contains their name.\nGoogle optimization.\nSince Google is the most popular search engine, many webmasters have become eager to influence their website's Google rankings. An industry of consultants has arisen to help websites increase their rankings on Google and on other search engines. This field, called search engine optimization, attempts to discern patterns in search engine listings, and then develop a methodology for improving rankings to draw more searchers to their client's sites.\nSearch engine optimization encompasses both \"on page\" factors (like body copy, title elements, H1 heading elements and image alt attribute values) and Off Page Optimization factors (like anchor text and PageRank). The general idea is to affect Google's relevance algorithm by incorporating the keywords being targeted in various places \"on page\", in particular the title element and the body copy (note: the higher up in the page, presumably the better its keyword prominence and thus the ranking). Too many occurrences of the keyword, however, cause the page to look suspect to Google's spam checking algorithms.\nGoogle has published guidelines for website owners who would like to raise their rankings when using legitimate optimization consultants.\nFunctionality.\nGoogle search consists of a series of localized websites. The largest of those, the google.com site, is the top most-visited website in the world. Some of its features include a definition link for most searches including dictionary words, the number of results you got on your search, links to other searches (e.g. for words that Google believes to be misspelled, it provides a link to the search results using its proposed spelling), and many more.\nSearch syntax.\nGoogle's search engine normally accepts queries as a simple text, and breaks up the user's text into a sequence of search terms, which will usually be words that are to occur in the results, but one can also use Boolean operators, such as: quotations marks (\") for a phrase, a prefix such as \"+\", \"-\" for qualified terms, or one of several advanced operators, such as \"site:\". The webpages of \"Google Search Basics\" describe each of these additional queries and options (\"see below:\" Search options).\nGoogle's Advanced Search web form gives several additional fields which may be used to qualify searches by such criteria as date of first retrieval. All advanced queries transform to regular queries, usually with additional qualified terms.\nQuery expansion.\nGoogle applies query expansion to the submitted search query, transforming it into the query that will actually be used to retrieve results. As with page ranking, the exact details of the algorithm Google uses are deliberately obscure, but certainly the following transformations are among those that occur:\n\"I'm Feeling Lucky\".\nGoogle's homepage includes a button labeled \"I'm Feeling Lucky\". When a user clicks on the button the user will be taken directly to the first search result, bypassing the search engine results page. The thought is that if a user is \"feeling lucky\", the search engine will return the perfect match the first time without having to page through the search results. According to a study by Tom Chavez of \"Rapt\", this feature costs Google $110 million a year as 1% of all searches use this feature and bypass all advertising.\nOn October 30, 2009, for some users, the \"I'm Feeling Lucky\" button was removed from Google's main page, along with the regular search button. Both buttons were replaced with a field that reads, \"This space intentionally left blank.\" This text faded out when the mouse was moved on the page, and normal search functionality is achieved by filling in the search field with the desired terms and pressing enter. A Google spokesperson explains, \"This is just a test, and a way for us to gauge whether our users will like an even simpler search interface.\" Personalized Google homepages retained both buttons and their normal functions.\nOn May 21, 2010, the 30th anniversary of Pac-Man, the \"I'm Feeling Lucky\" button was replaced with a button reading the words \"Insert Coin\". After pressing the button, the user would begin a Google-themed game of Pac-Man in the area where the Google logo would normally be. Pressing the button a second time would begin a two-player version of the same game that includes Ms. Pacman for player 2. This version can be accessed at http://www.google.com/pacman as a permanent link to the page.\nRich Snippets.\nOn 12 May 2009, Google announced that they would be parsing the hCard, hReview, and hProduct microformats and using them to populate search result pages with what they called \"Rich Snippets\".\nSpecial features.\nBesides the main search-engine feature of searching for text, Google Search has more than 22 \"special features\" (activated by entering any of dozens of \"trigger words\") when searching:\nSearch options.\nThe webpages maintained by the Google Help Center have text describing more than 15 various search options.\nThe Google operators:\nSome of the query options are as follows:\nThe page-display options (or query types) are:\nNote that Google searches the HTML coding inside a webpage, not the screen appearance: the words displayed on a screen might not be listed in the same order in the HTML coding.\nError messages.\nSome searches will give a 403 Forbidden error with the text\n\"We're sorry...\n... but your query looks similar to automated requests from a computer virus or spyware application. To protect our users, we can't process your request right now.\nWe'll restore your access as quickly as possible, so try again soon. In the meantime, if you suspect that your computer or network has been infected, you might want to run a virus checker or spyware remover to make sure that your systems are free of viruses and other spurious software.\nWe apologise for the inconvenience, and hope we'll see you again from all of the team here at Google.\"\nsometimes followed by a CAPTCHA prompt.\nThe screen was first reported in 2005, and was a response to the heavy use of Google by search engine optimization companies to check on ranks of sites they were optimizing. The message is triggered by high volumes of requests from a single IP address. Google apparently uses the Google cookie as part of its determination of refusing service.\nIn June 2009, after the death of pop superstar Michael Jackson, this message appeared to many internet users who were searching Google for news stories related to the singer, and was assumed by Google to be a DDoS attack, although many queries were submitted by legitimate searchers.\nJanuary 2009 malware bug.\nGoogle flags search results with the message \"This site may harm your computer\" if the site is known to install malicious software in the background or otherwise surreptitiously. Google does this to protect users against visiting sites that could harm their computers. For approximately 40\u00a0minutes on January 31, 2009, \"all\" search results were mistakenly classified as malware and could therefore not be clicked; instead a warning message was displayed and the user was required to enter the requested URL manually. The bug was caused by human error.\u00a0The URL of \"/\" (which expands to all URLs) was mistakenly added to the malware patterns file.\nDoodle for Google.\nOn certain occasions, the logo on Google's webpage will change to a special version, known as a \"Google Doodle\". Clicking on the Doodle links to a string of Google search results about the topic. The first was a reference to the Burning Man Festival in 1998, and others have been produced for the birthdays of notable people like Albert Einstein, historical events like the interlocking Lego block's 50th anniversary and holidays like Valentine's Day.\nGoogle Caffeine.\nIn August 2009, Google announced the rollout of a new search architecture, codenamed \"Caffeine\".\nThe new architecture was designed to return results faster and to better deal with rapidly updated information from services including Facebook and Twitter.\nGoogle developers noted that most users would notice little immediate change, but invited developers to test the new search in its sandbox.\nDifferences noted for their impact upon search engine optimization included heavier keyword weighting and the importance of the domain's age.\nThe move was interpreted in some quarters as a response to Microsoft's recent release of an upgraded version of its own search service, renamed Bing.\nGoogle announced completion of Caffeine on 8 June 2010, claiming 50% fresher results due to continuous updating of its index.\nWith Caffeine, Google moved its back-end indexing system away from MapReduce and onto BigTable, the company's distributed database platform. Caffeine is also based on Colossus, or GFS2, an overhaul of the GFS distributed file system.\nEncrypted Search.\nIn May 2010 Google rolled out SSL-encrypted web search. The encrypted search can be accessed at: https://encrypted.google.com \nInstant Search.\nGoogle Instant, an enhancement that displays suggested results while the user types, was introduced in the United States starting on September 8, 2010. One concern is that people might select one of the suggested results instead of finishing their request, and that such a practice could cause bias toward familiar businesses or other search terms. Pornographic or otherwise offensive search terms are excluded from the suggested results. The instant feature appears only on the basic Google site and not specialized iGoogle pages. Google expects Google Instant to save users 2 to 5\u00a0seconds in every search, which they say will be collectively 11 million seconds per hour. Search engine marketing pundits speculated that Google Instant would have a great impact on local and paid search.\nIn concert with the Google Instant launch, Google disabled the ability of users to choose to see more than 10 search results per page. Instant Search can be disabled via Google's \"preferences\" menu, but autocomplete-style search suggestions now cannot be disabled. A Google representative stated, \"It's in keeping with our vision of a unified Google search experience to make popular, useful features part of the default experience, rather than maintain different versions of Google. As Autocomplete quality has improved, we felt it was appropriate to have it always on for all of our users.\"\nInternational.\nGoogle is available in many languages and has been localized for many countries.\nLanguages.\nThe interface has also been made available in some languages for humorous purpose:\nDomain names.\nIn addition to the main URL Google.com, Google Inc. owns 160 domain names for each of the countries/regions in which it has been localized. As Google is an American company, the main domain name can be considered as the U.S. one.\nSome domain names unregistered by Google are currently squatted, such as \"Google.ua\" (for Ukraine, where the correct URL is \"google.com.ua\").\nSearch products.\nIn addition to its tool for searching webpages, Google also provides services for searching images, Usenet newsgroups, news websites, videos, searching by locality, maps, and items for sale online. In 2006, Google has indexed over 25 billion web pages, 400 million queries per day, 1.3 billion images, and over one billion Usenet messages. It also caches much of the content that it indexes. Google operates other tools and services including Google News, Google Suggest, Google Product Search, Google Maps, Google Co-op, Google Earth, Google Docs, Picasa, Panoramio, YouTube, Google Translate, Google Blog Search and Google Desktop Search.\nThere are also products available from Google that are not directly search-related. Gmail, for example, is a webmail application, but still includes search features; Google Browser Sync does not offer any search facilities, although it aims to organize your browsing time.\nAlso Google starts many new beta products, like Google Social Search or Google Image Swirl.\nIn 2017 the USPTO issued Microsoft a patent describing a methodology that could serve as an alternative to Google's Instant Search.\nEnergy consumption.\nGoogle claims that a search query requires altogether about 1 kJ or 0.0003 kW\u00b7h."}

{"id": "264977", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=264977", "title": "Fade (audio engineering)", "text": "In audio engineering, a fade is a gradual increase (fade-in) or decrease (fade-out) in the level of an audio signal. The term can also be used for film cinematography or theatre lighting, in much the same way (see: fade (filmmaking)).\nA recorded song may be gradually reduced to silence at its end (\"fade-out\"), or may gradually increase from silence at the beginning (\"fade-in\"). For example, the songs \"Bitter Sweet Symphony\" by The Verve and \"Turn to Stone\" by Electric Light Orchestra fade in from the beginning, while the songs \"Born to Be Wild\" by Steppenwolf, \"Boogie Oogie Oogie\" by A Taste of Honey, and \"Hey Jude\" by The Beatles fade out. However, \"Born to be Wild\" and \"Boogie Oogie Oogie\" fade out in a matter of seconds, whereas \"Hey Jude\" takes over 2 minutes to completely fade out. \"Goodbye Stranger\" by Supertramp takes about a minute to fade out. Fading-out can serve as a recording solution for pieces of music that contain no obvious ending.\nThough relatively rare, songs can fade out, then fade back in. Some examples of this are \"Helter Skelter\" by The Beatles, \"Suspicious Minds\" by Elvis Presley, \"Thank You\" by Led Zeppelin or \"Undercover of the Night\" by The Rolling Stones.\nThe term \"fade\" is also used in multi-speaker audio systems to describe the balancing of power between front and rear channels.\nOrigins and early examples.\n\"Neptune\", part of the orchestral suite, \"The Planets\", by Gustav Holst, was an early piece of music to have a fade-out ending. Holst stipulates that the women's choruses are \"to be placed in an adjoining room, the door of which is to be left open until the last bar of the piece, when it is to be slowly and silently closed\", and that the final bar (scored for choruses alone) is \"to be repeated until the sound is lost in the distance\". Although commonplace today, the effect bewitched audiences in the era before widespread recorded sound\u2014after the initial 1918 run-through, Holst's daughter, Imogen (in addition to watching the charwomen dancing in the aisles during \"Jupiter\") remarked that the ending was \"unforgettable, with its hidden chorus of women's voices growing fainter and fainter... until the imagination knew no difference between sound and silence\".\nThe technique of ending a spoken or musical recording by fading out the sound goes back to the earliest days of recording. In the era of mechanical (pre-electrical) recording, this could only be achieved by either moving the sound source away from the recording horn, or by gradually reducing the volume at which the performers were singing, playing or speaking. With the advent of electrical recording, smooth and controllable fadeout effects could be easily achieved by simply reducing the input volume from the microphones using the fader on the mixing desk.\nNo single recording can be reliably identified as \"the first\" to use the technique. In 2003, on the (now-defunct) website \"Stupid Question\" , John Ruch listed the following recordings as possible contenders:\nFader.\nA fader is any device used for fading, especially when it is a knob or button that \"slides\" along a track or slot. A knob which \"rotates\" is usually not considered a fader, although it is electrically and functionally equivalent. A fader can be either analogue, directly controlling the resistance or impedance to the source (e.g. a Potentiometer); or digital, numerically controlling a digital signal processor (DSP). Digital faders are also referred to as \"virtual\" faders, since they can be viewed on the screen of a digital audio workstation. Modern high-end digital mixers often have piezo-electric actuators attached to the faders such that they can be multi-use and will jump to the correct position for the selected function and/or saved setting.\nCrossfading.\nA crossfader on a dj mixer essentially functions like two faders connected side-by-side, but in opposite directions. It allows a DJ to fade one source out while fading another source in at the same time. This is extremely useful when beatmatching two phonograph records or compact discs.\nThe technique of crossfading is also used in audio engineering as a mixing technique, particularly with instrumental solos. A mix engineer will often record two or more takes of a vocal or instrumental part and create a final version which is a composite of the best passages of these takes by crossfading between each track.\nIn the perfect case the crossfader would keep constant output level. However, there's no standard how this should be achieved. Many DJ equipment manufacturers offer different mixers for different purposes (e.g. scratching, beatmixing, cut mixing, etc.). High-end mixers often have crossfade curve switches allowing the DJ to select the type of crossfade necessary. Experienced DJs are also able to crossfade between tracks using the channel faders.\nThere are many software applications that feature virtual crossfaders. For instance, burning-software for the recording of audio-CDs.\nPre-fader, post-fader.\nOn a mixer with auxiliary send mixes, the send mixes are configured pre-fader or post-fader.\nIf a send mix is configured pre-fader, then changes to the main channel strip fader does not affect the send mix. This is useful for stage monitor mixes where changes in the Front of House channel levels would distract the musicians.\nIf a send mix is configured post-fader, then the level sent to the send mix follows changes to the main channel strip fader. This is useful for reverberation and other signal processor effects."}

{"id": "264986", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=264986", "title": "Backspace", "text": "Backspace is the keyboard key (sometimes labeled as: \u2190 ) that originally pushed the typewriter carriage one position backwards, and for modern computer screens, moves the cursor one position backwards, deletes the preceding character, and shifts back the text after it by one position.\nIn typewriters, a typist would, for example, type a lowercase letter \"a\" with acute accent (\u00e1) by typing a lowercase letter \"a\" then backspace, and then the acute accent key (also known as overstrike). This is the basis for such spacing modifiers in computer character sets such as the ASCII caret (^, for the circumflex accent). Backspace composition no longer works with digital displays or typesetting systems. It has to some degree been replaced with the combining diacritical marks mechanism of Unicode, though such characters do not work well with many fonts, and precomposed characters continue to be used. Some software like TeX or Microsoft Windows use the opposite method for diacritical marks, namely positioning the accent first, and then placing the base letter at that position.\nPressing the backspace key on a computer terminal would generate the ASCII code 08, BS or Backspace, a control code which would delete the preceding character. That control code could also be accessed by pressing Control-H, as H is the eighth letter of the Latin alphabet. Terminals which did not have the backspace code mapped to the function of moving the cursor backwards and deleting the preceding character would display the symbols ^H (caret, H \u2013 see Caret notation) when the backspace key was pressed. This sequence is still used humorously for epanorthosis by computer literates, denoting the deletion of a pretended blunder, much like a strikethrough.\nExample:\n My slave-dri^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hboss decided to stall the project.\nA more concise alternative sometimes seen is ^W, which is the shortcut to delete the previous word in the Berkeley Unix terminal line discipline. One ^W can replace a whole string of ^H's. This shortcut has also made it into the Vi text editor. For really embarrassing blunders, ^U (kill line) can outdo a series of ^W.\nThe backspace is distinct from the delete key, which in paper media for computers would punch out all the holes to strike out a character, and in modern computers deletes text \"following\" it. Also, the delete key often works as a generic command to remove an object (such as an image inside a document, or a file in a file manager), while backspace usually has no effect.\nIn modern systems, the backspace key is often mapped to the delete character (0x7f in ASCII or Unicode), although the backspace key's function of deleting the character before the cursor remains.\nIn a mainframe environment, \"to backspace\" means to move a magnetic tape backwards, typically to the previous block.\nThe backspace key is commonly used to go back a page when exploring folders in graphical environments, or when browsing the Web in web browsers.\nAlthough the term \"backspace\" is the standard name of the key which deletes the character to the left of the cursor, the actual key may be labelled in a variety of ways, for example \"delete\", \"Erase\" (for example in XO-1, One Laptop Per Child), or with a left pointing arrow."}

{"id": "265001", "revid": "1125877", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=265001", "title": "Quatour pour la fin du temps", "text": "Quatuor pour la fin du temps is a piece of chamber music by the French composer Olivier Messiaen. In English -speaking countries it is often called by the English title Quartet for the End of Time. The piece is written for an unusual combination of four instruments: clarinet (in B-flat), violin, cello, and piano. There are 8 movements. It takes about 50 minutes to perform. The work was first performed in unusual circumstances in 1941. It is a very important work in the history of 20th century classical music.\nComposition and first performance.\nThere was a special reason why Messiaen wrote this work for an unusual combination of instruments. In 1940, when World War II was being fought, Germany invaded France. Messiaen was captured by the German army and he was held as a prisoner of war. While being taken to the prisoner of war camp, Messiaen talked to another prisoner, Henri Akoka, who was a clarinettist. Messiaen showed him the sketches for a clarinet piece he was writing called \"Ab\u00eeme des oiseaux\". Two other professional musicians were also among the prisoners: Jean le Boulaire, a violinist and \u00c9tienne Pasquier, a cellist. Messiaen composed the \"Quatuor\" for these three musicians with himself at the piano. The combination of these four instruments is unusual, although Paul Hindemith had written a work for the same combination in 1938.\nThe quartet was given its first performance in G\u00f6rlitz, Germany (now called Zgorzelec in Poland) on 15 January 1941. The audience consisted of about four hundred prisoners of war. There were German prison officers sitting in front. The music must have seemed strange to the audience, but they all listened politely. Shortly after this Messiaen was released from prison and went back to France.\nInspiration.\nMessiaen was inspired by the words in the Bible where the angel says \u201cThere shall be time no longer\u201d. These words have another meaning in relation to the music, because Messiaen does not write music with a regular number of beats in a bar. Like The Rite of Spring, the length of the bars keep changing. Messiaen had heard enough of soldiers marching to a regular one-two-three-four-one-two-three-four during the war. His rhythms in this music develop from little tiny rhythmic patterns\nStructure.\nThe work is in eight movements.\nThe first movement is called \u201cLiturgie de cristal\u201d (\u201cChyrstal liturgy\u201d) and describes the birds waking up. All four instruments play this movement.\nThe second movement is \u201cVocalise, pour l'Ange qui annonce la fin du Temps\n\u201cSong for the Angel who announces the end of time\u201d. It is played by the full quartet, although the clarinet does not play in the central section.\nThe third movement is called \u201cAb\u00eeme des oiseaux\u201d (\u201cAbyss of birds\u201d) and is just played by the clarinet. It is extremely slow and the clarinettist needs a lot of breath control.\nThe fourth movement is \u201cInterm\u00e8de\u201d (\u201cInterlude\u201d) and is played by the violin, cello, and clarinet.). It is fast and lively.\nThe fifth movement is \u201cLouange \u00e0 l'\u00c9ternit\u00e9 de J\u00e9sus (\u201cPraise to the eternity of Jesus\"). It is played by the cello accompanied by the piano who just plays chords. It is again extremely slow and the cellist needs good bow control.\nThe sixth movement is called \u201cDanse de la fureur, pour les sept trompettes\u201c (\u201cDance of the Fury, for the seven trumpets\u201d), played on all four instruments. They play in unison (the same notes) nearly all the way through.\nThe seventh movement is called \u201cFouillis d'arcs-en-ciel, pour l'Ange qui annonce la fin du Temps\" (\u201cTangle of rainbows, for the Angel who announces the end of time\u201d), played by the full quartet. Some of the music from the second movement is repeated. We hear the angel being covered by the rainbow.\nThe eighth movement is \u201cLouange \u00e0 l'Immortalit\u00e9 de J\u00e9sus\" (\u201cPraise to the immortality of Jesus\"), for violin and piano. We hear the ascent of man to his god. The violin finishes on a very high harmonic note.\nIn the long preface at the front of the score Messiaen writes a short introduction to the music theory theory of his music. He describes the rhythms he uses and how they relate to one another. However, at the end, he says that it is not necessary to read all about his theory in order to perform the piece.\nReferences.\nhttps://newzspy.com/police-determine-4-our-bodies-in-california-helicopter-crash/"}

These are popular among tourists, with 30% of tourists visiting at least one national park during their stay in New Zealand. While the national parks contain some of New Zealand's most beautiful scenery, the first few that were created were all focused on mountains. Since the 1980s more different kinds of New Zealand landscapes have been included in the national parks. New Zealand's national parks are all important to preserve both nature and culture, and some are also historically important. Tongariro National Park is one of 27 World Heritage Sites that is of both cultural and natural significance, and four of the South Island national parks form Te Wahipounamu, another World Heritage Site.\nNational Parks Act.\nThe National Parks Act of 1980 was written to record what national parks are for, and how they would be chosen and looked after. It begins by explaining what a national park is:\nThe National Parks Act goes on to say that the public will be allowed to enter and use the parks freely, but with rules to avoid destroying the native plants and animals or the parks. Access to specially protected areas (550\u00a0km\u00b2) as noted under the act is only allowed with special permits.\nNational parks are soil, water and forest conservation areas, and should be kept as natural as possible. Native plants and animals are to be looked after and other plants and animals removed if they harm the natural wildlife. Development in what the act calls \"wilderness areas\" is only foot tracks and huts used for wild animal control or scientific research. \nServices available for public use.\nThe Act allows the Department of Conservation to provide hostels, huts, camping grounds, ski tows and other services, parking areas, roading and tracks within the parks. As well as these, the department also provides some accommodation, transport and other services at entry points to the parks, but these are also offered by others. Other services within the parks, such as guided walks and skiing tutorials, are provided by other companies, sometimes with help from the department.\nProposed national park.\nThe area around Waipoua Forest, north of Dargaville, was suggested to become a new Kauri National Park. The area contains most of New Zealand's remaining kauri, including the largest known kauri, T\u0101ne Mahuta. These stands of kauri are also important because they are homes for many endangered species including the North Island brown kiwi. This proposal is currently being considered by the Department of Conservation.\nMining concerns.\nIn 2010 the New Zealand Government proposed removing some national park and conservation areas from Schedule 4 protection of the Crown Minerals Act which means that mining is not allowed in those areas. In July the government decided against the proposal after receiving a large number of submissions, most of which were against mining."}

He is one of the founders of the cyberpunk literary movement. He writes both fiction and non-fiction books and articles. He is best known for the novels in the Ware Tetralogy (series of four books). The first two books (\"Software\" and \"Wetware\") both won Philip K. Dick Awards. Now he edits the science fiction webzine called \"Flurb\".\nEarly life.\nRucker is the great-great-great-grandson of the philosopher Georg Hegel.\nRucker attended St. Xavier High School. Then he completed a B.A. in mathematics from Swarthmore College. Next, earned Master's and Ph.D. degrees in mathematics from Rutgers University.\nCareer.\nHe taught at the State University of New York at Geneseo from 1972 to 1978. He got a grant (money to support scholarship) from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, so he went to teach math at the Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg from 1978 to 1980. He then taught at Randolph-Macon Women's College in Lynchburg, Virginia from 1980 to 1982. Next, he tried being as a full-time author for four years. Inspired by an interview with Stephen Wolfram, Rucker became a computer science professor at San Jos\u00e9 State University in 1986. He retired from SJSU in 2004. He is a mathematician who is also interested in philosophy. He has written books connecting these two areas, for example: \"The Fourth Dimension\"; \"Geometry, Relativity and the Fourth Dimension\"; and \"Infinity and the Mind\". Princeton University Press published new editions of \"Infinity and the Mind\" in 1995 and in 2005, both with new prefaces; the first edition is cited with fair frequency in academic literature.\nAs his \"own alternative to cyberpunk,\" Rucker developed a writing style he calls Transrealism. He gave a brief explanation of Transrealism in his 1983 essay, \"The Transrealist Manifesto\". It is science fiction based on the author's own life and immediate perceptions, mixed with fantastic elements that symbolize psychological change. Many of Rucker's novels and short stories apply these ideas. One example of Rucker's Transrealist works is \"Saucer Wisdom\", a novel in which the main character is abducted by aliens. Rucker and his publisher marketed the book as non-fiction as a kind of joke.\nRucker wrote his first Transrealist novel, \"White Light,\" while he was at Heidelberg. This Transrealist novel is based on his experiences at SUNY Geneseo.\nRucker often uses his novels to explore scientific or mathematical ideas. For example, \"White Light\" examines the concept of infinity. Parts of the Ware Tetralogy (written from 1982 through 2000) are an explanation of using natural selection to develop computer software (a subject also developed in his \"The Hacker and the Ants\", written in 1994). His novels also show a mystical philosophy. Rucker explained this philosophy in an essay called \"The Central Teachings of Mysticism\". There may be some irony in this tiitle (The essay is included in \"Seek!\", 1999).\nHe recently published a book called \"The Lifebox, the Seashell, and the Soul: What Gnarly Computation Taught Me About Ultimate Reality, the Meaning Of Life, and How To Be Happy\". This book summarizes the various philosophies he's believed over the years. It ends with the tentative conclusion that people might get some benefit by thinking about the world as made of computations. His final remark in the book is, \"perhaps this universe is perfect.\"\nWorks.\nNon-fiction.\nList on Rucker's SJSU web page. With links to each book's web page."}

They are the only species within the family. There are 47 species of tinamou in Central and South America. They are one of the most ancient living groups of bird, and are related to the ratites. Generally ground dwelling, they are found in a range of habitats.\nTaxonomy and evolution.\nOf Gondwanan origin, tinamous are related to the ratites. Although the fossil record in South America is poor, the known tinamiform fossil record goes back 10 million years. Together with the ratites, they make up Palaeognathae (\"old jaws\"), while all other living birds are members of Neognathae (\"new jaws\"). Unlike the other palaeognaths, tinamous do have a keeled sternum. Like the other palaeognaths, they also have a distinctive palate (thin bony plate at top of mouth).\nRecent phylogenetic studies place tinamids as the sister group of Australasian/Oceanian ratites. Those are the (cassowaries, emus, and kiwi). South American ratites (rheas) and African ratites (ostriches) are also related, but more distantly. Tinamous themselves are monophyletic."}

A false premise is an untrue proposition that forms part of the basis of a \"logical syllogism\". Since the premise (assumption) is not correct, the conclusion drawn may also be wrong. \nHowever, it should be noted that whether or not an argument is \"valid\" does not depend on whether its premises are true. It rather depends on whether the conclusion follows from them, which is to say, on whether \"under the assumption\" that the premises are true, the conclusion must be true as well.\nFor example, consider this syllogism:\nThis argument is logically valid. But its premises are not always true. The first premise can be false \u2013 someone could have hosed down the streets, a street cleaner could have passed, the local river could have flooded, and so on. A simple logical analysis will not reveal the error in this argument, since that analysis assumes that all the argument's premises are true. For this reason, an argument based on false premises can be much more difficult to refute, or even discuss, than one featuring a normal logical error, as the truth of its premises must be established to the satisfaction of all parties.\nAnother feature of an argument based on false premises that can bedevil critics, is that its conclusion can in fact be true. Consider the above example again. It may well be that it has recently rained, and that the streets are wet. This of course does nothing to prove the first premise, but can make its claims more difficult to refute.\nA false premise can also be a premise that is poorly defined, which makes the conclusion questionable. The following joke from \"Plato and a Platypus Walk Into a Bar\" illustrates the point: \"An old cowboy goes into a bar and orders a drink. As he sits there sipping his whiskey, a young lady sits down next to him. ... She says, 'I'm a lesbian. I spend my whole day thinking about women. ...' A little while later, a couple sits down next to the old cowboy and asks him, 'Are you a real cowboy?' He replies, 'I always thought I was, but I just found out I'm a lesbian'.\" The mistake the cowboy makes is that he assumes that the definition of a lesbian is somebody who spends the \"whole day thinking about women\", without including the fact that a lesbian is a homosexual female. The cowboy is neither homosexual nor female; therefore, he is not a lesbian."}

Jonathan is a member of the Ijaw ethnic group.\nEarly political career.\nBayelsa State governorship.\nJonathan began his career in politics in 1998, having joined the People's Democratic Party (PDP) in 1998.\nJonathan, who had been the Deputy Governor of Bayelsa State, succeeded Governor Diepreye Alamieyeseigha, who was impeached by the Bayelsa State Assembly after being charged with money laundering in the United Kingdom. In September 2006, Jonathan's wife was indicted by the nation's anti-crime agency, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), for crimes related to money laundering.\nPresidential race.\nIn December 2006, Jonathan was chosen as running mate to Umaru Yar'Adua for the PDP presidential ticket in the April 2007 election. On 20 April 2007, shortly before the presidential election, there was a violent attack from militants. The police said that people had tried to kill Jonathan. However, this did not end up happening.\nVice Presidency.\nFollowing the PDP's election win, which some people did not think was fair, militants blew up Jonathan's country house in Otu-Eke, Bayelsa State on 16 May; two policemen were killed in the attack. Jonathan was not there at the time.\nActing President.\nPresident Umaru Yar'Adua left Nigeria on 23 November 2009 for medical treatment. He did not make plans for anyone to take over his duties. On 13 January 2010, a federal court handed Vice-President Jonathan the power to carry out state affairs in the president's continued absence. On 22 January 2010, the Supreme Court of Nigeria ruled that the Federal Executive Council (FEC) had 14 days to decide whether President Yar'Adua \"is incapable of discharging the functions of his office\".\nIn a nationwide address in February 2010, Jonathan called on all Nigerians to set aside religious and ethnic differences to work together for the common good.\nJonathan said \"The events of the recent past have put to a test our collective resolve as a democratic nation,\"\n\"I am delighted to know that our nation has demonstrated resilience and unity of purpose.\nOn 9 February 2010, the Senate decided that presidential power should be given to the Vice President. He was appointed to serve as Acting President, with all the accompanying powers, until when and if Yar'Adua returned to full health. The power transfer was called a \"coup without the word\" by opposition lawyers and lawmakers. The Nigerian Constitution requires a written letter from the President stating he is unable to serve or that the cabinet sends a medical team to examine him but this provision has not apparently been fulfilled leaving some doubts as to the constitutionality of the action.\nPresidency.\nYar'Adua died on 5 May 2010. Jonathan was sworn in as Yar'Adua's replacement on 6 May 2010, becoming Nigeria's 14th Head of State. He will serve as President until the next election. Upon taking office, Jonathan cited anti-corruption, power and electoral reform were what he wanted to focus on as President. He stated that he came to office under \"very sad and unusual circumstances.\"\nOn 18 May 2010, the National Assembly approved President Goodluck Jonathan's nomination of former Kaduna State governor, Namadi Sambo, an architect, for the position of Vice President.\nWorld Cup controversy.\nAfter the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, in which the Nigerian side failed to advance beyond group stage, Jonathan said that the national team could no longer play international matches. FIFA objected to the president's decision and threatened to kick Nigeria out of the association. After this, Jonathan ended the ban.\nRe-election.\nJonathan was re-elected in April 2011 in an election that some experts said may have been the most fair election in Nigerian history."}

The language developed when the Sandinist government of Nicaragua created the first (elementary) school for deaf people, in the 1970s. The language is of special interest to linguists, because it allows them to study how languages develop.\nIn the 1970s, the deaf people of Nicaragua rarely met. They lived isolated lives and used simple gestures to communicate with their friends and family. In 1977, a special programme for the deaf was started in a suburb of Managua. At first, fifty children took part. When the Sandinist came to power, the number of pupils rose to hundred. In 1980, a vocational school for deaf people was opened in another part of Managua. In 1983, both schools together had about 400 pupils.\nThe teaching was centered on lip reading and the use of a hand alphabet. This was mostly unsuccessful, because most pupils had trouble spelling words in this way. The children were cut off from their teachers, and used recreational breaks, and free time spent together to create a system that allowed them to communicate with each other. Gestures and signs used at home were used to create a pidgin. Later the pidgin developed into a Creole language. The first step, that is to say the pidgin is called \"Lenguaje de Signos Nicarag\u00fcense\" (LSN) today. Pupils who left the school before the creole language was created, continue to use the pidgin.\nThe staff of the school missed the fact that a language was developing before their eyes. All they saw were some mimics, and the failure to learn Spanish. As they did not know what the pupils were saying, they asked for help. In 1986, Judi Kegl, an expert on the topic of American Sign Language was asked to help. When she analysed the language, she found out that the pidgin NSL had been made more complex by the younger pupils \u2014 it now included a fixed grammar, and the arrangement of verbs. Today, this extended form is known as \"ISN\"."}

Each year the festival is held in one of those three cathedrals in turn.\nThe Three Choirs Festival is one of the oldest festivals of classical music. It has its roots in the 18th century. Many famous musicians have performed in the festival. Concerts have been conducted by Samuel Sebastian Wesley, Edward Elgar, Ralph Vaughan Williams and many others. Music has been composed for the festival by Frederick Delius, Zoltan Kodaly Holst, Arthur Sullivan, Herbert Howells, Gerald Finzi, William Walton, Arthur Bliss and Benjamin Britten, Lennox Berkeley, John McCabe, William Mathias, Paul Patterson and James MacMillan. As well as the cathedral choirs there is also a choir called the Festival Chorus which takes part, usually singing large-scale works with orchestra. Many ensembles and international soloists perform at the festival."}

It stands on a bank overlooking the River Severn. It is the seat of the Anglican Bishop of Worcester. Its official name is The Cathedral Church of Christ and the Blessed Mary the Virgin of Worcester. It was built between 1084 and 1504, so therefore there are many different kinds of architecture, from Norman to Perpendicular Gothic. It is famous for its Norman crypt and the unusual chapter house.\nHistory.\nThe Cathedral was founded in 680 with Bishop Bosel as its head. Most of the cathedral we see today dates from the 12th and 13th centuries.\nMonks and nuns had been at the Cathedral since the seventh century. The monastery became Benedictine in the second half of the tenth century. The Benedictine monks were driven out in 1540 and replaced by secular (non-religious) canons.\nAfter the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the building became a cathedral of secular clergy again. The cathedral often had restoration work done, especially by Sir George Gilbert Scott and A. E. Perkins in the 1860s. Both men are buried at the cathedral.\nIn the chancel of the cathedral is the tomb of King John. The cathedral has a memorial, Prince Arthur's Chantry, to the young prince Arthur Tudor, who is buried here. Arthur's younger brother and next in line for the throne was Henry VIII. Worcester Cathedral was not destroyed by Henry VIII during the English Reformation because of his brother's chantry in the cathedral.\nOther famous burials include Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin (1867\u20131947), Bishop of Worcester John Gauden (1605\u20131662) and Richard Edes (d.1604), a chaplain to Elizabeth I and James I.\nBells.\nThe tower has a ring of twelve bells plus three semitone bells and a non-swinging bourdon. They are some of the most beautiful church bells ever made. There is a teaching centre with eight special training bells, linked to computers.\nMusic.\nWorcester Cathedral has three choirs: the Worcester Cathedral Choir (the main choir which has both a boys' and a girls' treble line, which normally work separately), Worcester Cathedral Chamber Choir, and the Worcester Cathedral Voluntary Choir. Since the 18th century, Worcester Cathedral Choir has taken part in the Three Choirs Festival, the oldest music festival in the world.\nThe composer Edward Elgar spent most of his life in Worcestershire. The first performance of his Enigma Variations took place at the cathedral during the 1899 festival. There is a stained glass window which contains his portrait.\nWorcester Cathedral has a long history of organs dating back to at least 1417. Until recently there was a large four-manual organ, originally built by Hope Jones. Most of this organ was removed in 2006 in order to make way for a new instrument by Kenneth Tickell, which was completed in the summer of 2008.\nFamous organists at Worcester have included Thomas Tomkins (from 1596), Hugh Blair (from 1895), Ivor Atkins (from 1897) and David Willcocks (from 1950). Today the organist (from 1996) is Adrian Lucas."}

The Grand Prix takes place over an entire weekend. There are two practice sessions on Friday. On Saturday, there is one more practice session and then the qualifying session. The race takes place on Sunday. \nFormula One Grand Prix are run under the rules and control of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). Typically, a FIA support series, such as the Formula Two, also runs during the weekend.\nPractice.\nAll days of the week and times given are local. \nThe event usually begins on Friday with two practice sessions. The first session, called Practice 1, runs from 10:00 to 11:30. The second session, called Practice 2, runs from 14:00 to 15:30 (or 2:00 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. in the 12-hour clock). \nThe practice sessions allow the drivers to learn the circuit and the teams to test their cars. Teams may test new parts on their cars. The car's wings and suspension settings may be changed to make the car faster. The teams may also allow one of their test drivers to drive the practice session.\nThe practice sessions have become more important starting in . With the FIA ban on testing during the season, the Friday sessions are the only time a team has to test new car parts.\nThe last practice session, called Practice 3, takes place on Saturday from 11:00 to 12:00. This allows the teams a final tune-up before qualifying starts.\nSpecial races.\nThe Monaco Grand Prix has a special schedule. The practice sessions that normally take place on Friday are moved to Thursday. The F1 teams do not have any sessions scheduled on Friday.\nThe Singapore Grand Prix, Bahrain Grand Prix and Abu Dhabi Grand Prix are the only night races in the Formula One calendar. Because of this, the session times are changed. Practice 1 runs from 18:00 to 19:30, and practice 2 runs from 21:30 to 23:00. The practice 3 session runs from 19:00 to 20:00.\nQualifying.\nOn Saturday at 14:00 the qualifying session takes place. This session will determine the running order at the beginning of the race. This is often called \"setting the grid\". The qualifying session is split into three parts, called Q1, Q2, and Q3. Q1 is 18 minutes long, followed by a seven minute break. Q2 is 15 minutes long, followed by an eight minute break. Q3 is 12 minutes long. During each part of qualifying, the fastest lap time set by a car is recorded. Drivers may run as many or as few laps as they wish.\nAfter Q1 is complete, the five slowest cars are eliminated (removed) from the qualifying session. This would include any cars that did not set a qualifying time. The remaining 15 car advance (move on) to Q2. The five cars eliminated are placed in the last five start positions, based on their fastest time from Q1. The procedure is repeated for Q2. The five slowest cars from Q2 are placed in the 11 through 15 starting positions on the grid.\nThe top ten cars remain for Q3. After this final part of qualifying, the top ten starting positions on the grid are set. The fastest qualifier is placed in the first position, which is known as the pole position. This car will have an advantage at the start, because they do not need to follow any other cars.\nDriving a qualifying lap.\nGenerally, a driver will leave the pits and drive around the track back to the start/finish line. This is called the \"out-lap\", and is not a timed lap. This lap often starts out at a slower pace to warm up the tyres. They will be up to full speed by the time they reach the start line. When they cross the line, they will try to drive the quickest time they can around the circuit. This is called a \"flying lap\" or a \"hot lap\". A driver may run several hot laps in a row. The fastest of these hot laps is used in setting the grid position. Finally, the driver will slow down and drive around the track. They re-enter the pit-lane on this \"in-lap\". If there is still time left, they may put on fresh tyres and try to set a faster hot lap.\nDNQ.\nIn the past, there were more cars entered for each race than the track had available space. When this would happen, not all cars would qualify. The slowest cars would not able to race and would be list as \"Did not Qualify\" (DNQ) in race results.\nPre-qualifying.\nIn the late 1980s and early 1990s the number of cars attempting to enter each race was as high as 39. It was too dangerous to have that many cars on the track at the same time. A \"pre-qualifying\" session was used. The teams with the worst record over the last six months would need to pre-qualify. This including all new teams. Only the four fastest cars from this session were then allowed to the main qualifying session. The slowest cars from the pre-qualifying session were listed in race results as \"Did Not Pre-Qualify\" (DNPQ). Pre-qualifying was ended after when many of the small teams left the sport.\n107% rule.\nAs the number of cars entered fell below 26, a new problem started. All cars entered would automatically qualify for the race. Some cars were much slower than most of the other cars. The 107% rule was introduced in . If the qualifying time of a car was not within 107% of the pole time, the car would not qualify for the race. For example, if the pole time was 1m 30s, the slowest a car could go to qualify would be 1m 36s. The race stewards could allow a slow car to race if they thought there was a good reason for it being slow. For example, rain may have slowed down the qualifying session.\nThis rule returned for the F1 season.\nRace.\nThe race itself is held on Sunday afternoon (Sunday night in Singapore, Bahrain and Abu Dhabi). Thirty minutes before race time, the cars take to the track. They may run several warm-up laps if they wish. When they are ready, they line up on the starting grid in the order they qualified. At race time, a green turns on to start the formation lap. The formation lap is a slow lap around the circuit. The cars warm up the engines and tyres, and all systems are checked. The cars return to their assigned grid spot and stop. The start is called a \"standing start\". \nThe starting light system is a set of five red lights mounted above the start/finish line. The red lights turn on one at a time, until all five red lights are on. Then there is a short delay of several seconds. Then the red lights turn off the race starts. The delay is different each time to keep the drivers from guessing when the race will start.\nThe length of the race is at least 305 kilometers. The fewest laps needed to race at least 305\u00a0km is determined for each circuit. The one race that is different is Monaco. There, the race is set at 78 laps for 206.5\u00a0km.\nThe time of the race can not exceed two hours. After two hours, the race is ended the next time the lead car passes the finish line. The race can also be stopped short of the full distance for safety reasons if conditions are bad.\nPit stops.\nAny time the car needs to be serviced, the driver must make a pit stop. The pit lane is next to the main straight with the start/finish line. The driver must enter the pit lane using the marked entrance road and select the pit limiter button, speeds vary from race to race. If they do flaunt the limit, they will receive a penalty. The driver stops the car in the team's pit box. Each team has one pit box to service both of their cars. After the work is done, the driver reenters the pit lane. At the end of the pit lane, they enter the pit exit road. Here they speed up the car to race speed. The driver may not cross the white line, until the end of the pit exit lane, otherwise they will recieve a penalty. \nPit stops are usually completed in a few seconds.\nDry weather tyres.\nTeams are supplied with tyres from Pirelli. They receive two different types of slick (tyres that have no tread) dry weather tyre compounds. The prime tyres and the option tyre. The prime tyre is made from harder rubber and will last longer. The option tyre is made from softer rubber. It will provide more traction in the corners, but will not last as long as the prime tyre. Each car is required to use at least one set of prime and one set of option tyres during the race.\nThe drivers who qualify in the first ten positions must start the race with the same tyres they qualified on. The remaining drivers may start the race on the tyre of their choice.\nWet weather tyres.\nTeams are supplied with two different types of wet weather tyres. The intermediate and wet tyre. Intermediate tyres are used when the track surface is damp or during a light rain. Wet tyres (sometimes called \"full wets\" tyres) are used when the track surface is very wet.\nWhenever wet weather tyres are used, the requirement to use both types of dry tyres is dropped. \nFuel.\nTeams are no longer allowed to refuel their cars during the race. The cars must start the race with enough fuel to complete the full race distance. \nIn the past, refueling was allowed. The amount of fuel a team would add to the car was part of the race strategy. Less fuel would make the car lighter so it would go faster. But more pit stops would be required to add fuel.\nRace end.\nWhen the leader completes the last lap of the race, and crosses the finish line, the race ends. Any remaining cars on the circuit race to the finish line and complete the lap they are on. If they are also on the lead lap, they are scored as being so many seconds behind the leader. If they are not on the lead lap, they are scored as being so many laps behind the leader. Any cars not still running are normally scored as \"retired\" (Ret). If they have completed 90% of the race distance, they scored with a finishing position.\nThe first three finishing positions are called a \"podium finish\". The three drivers take their places on a podium. They stand as the national anthem of the race winner's home country and that of his team are played. Dignitaries from the country hosting the race then present trophies to the drivers. A constructor's trophy is presented to a representative from the winner's team.\nPoints system.\nPoints are awarded to drivers and teams based on their finishing order. The winner receives 25 points, the second place finisher 18 points, with 15, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2 and 1 points for positions 3 through 10 and a bonus point for setting the fastest lap for any driver who finishes in a points scoring position. If a race is stopped before 75% of the scheduled race distance has been completed, the points awarded are cut in half. If two or more drivers tie for a position, prizes and points are added together and shared equally for all those drivers who tie. Constructors receive points as well as drivers. Each constructor receives the same amount of points that their two drivers earned. \nThe winner of the annual Driver's Championship is the driver with the most points. The same hold true for the Constructors' Championship. If two or more drivers (or constructors) have the same number of points, a tie breaker system is used. The one with the most wins is ranked higher. If the number of wins are the same, it goes to the one with the most second places and so on.\nIn the past, other point systems were used. Also, there were not as many races during the season as today. In the early years, there were seasons with as few as seven races. When F1 started in , only eight points were awarded to the winner. For the first decade of F1, an additional point was awarded for the fastest lap. For many years, only the best number of results would count toward the championship. \nIn Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna were the drivers for McLaren. They were the best two drivers of that year. There were 16 races that year, but only the best 11 results counted towards the championship. Prost won seven races and finished seven races in second place. He scored a total of 105 points, but only 87 of them counted for the championship. Senna won eight races and finished second in three, giving him 90 points for the championship and 94 for the season. This resulted in the strange event where Prost took a record number of points, yet Senna won the champion."}

{"id": "265415", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=265415", "title": "Beau Brummell", "text": "Beau Brummell, (born George Bryan Brummell, London 7 June 1778 \u2013 died Caen, France 30 March 1840), was the leader of men's fashion in Regency England. He was a friend of the Prince Regent, the future King George IV, and started the fashion for men to wear tailored clothes that were tasteful and fitted well.\nThe style.\nBrummell once said: \"If John Bull turns around to look at you, you are not well dressed; but either too stiff, too tight, or too fashionable\". This hardly suggests a dandy whose cravats alone were a peacock display.\nNo doubt Brummell wore various styles, but one in particular seems to have been his favourite. The style included dark coats and full-length trousers, with an elaborately-knotted cravat. \nThe coat was cut away at the front, and double-breasted. If worn open, it had a double-breasted waistcoat underneath. The tails of the coat were not long, ending above the back of the knees. They were cut square. The collar of the coat was a 'stand-up': it stood higher at the back of the neck.\nBeau Brummell is credited with introducing and establishing as fashion the modern man's suit, worn with a tie. The modern tie is a descendant of the cravat. \nIt is said that Brummell believed in cut rather than colour. In the illustration his clothes are well-fitted, but also quite colourful by our standards. \nHe claimed to take five hours to dress. He recommended using champagne to clean boots and make them shine. His style of dress is often referred to as dandyism, Brummell would not have agreed with that description.\nPersonal grooming.\nBrummell's personal grooming was very modern. He kept himself clean, which most people did not in his day. \nThis kind of care is quite modern, and a part of celebrity culture today. He was a perfectionist in his choice of clothes. There's a story of someone who visited him, and met his valet coming out of the room carrying a tray full of cravats. \"These, Sir, are our failures\"! said the valet. Brummell said of himself \"I have no talents other than to dress; my genius is in the wearing of clothes\".\nLife.\nHis father died in 1794, leaving him an inheritance of more than \u00a320,000 pounds. He was educated at Eton and at Oriel College, Oxford University. He later joined the 10th Hussars, where he came to the attention of George, Prince of Wales. Through the influence of the Prince, Brummell was promoted to captain by 1796. When his regiment was sent from London to Manchester he resigned his commission.\nFor a time, Brummell avoided extravagance and gambling. For example, he kept horses but no carriages. He was included in Prince George's circle. Here, he made an impression with his elegant manner of dress, and his clever remarks. His attention to cleaning his teeth, shaving and bathing daily became popular. \nHowever he did spend money on his appearance. When asked how much it would cost to keep a single man in clothes, he was alleged to have replied: \"Why, with tolerable economy, I think it might be done with \u00a3800\".\nBrummell was influenced by his wealthy friends. He began spending and gambling as though his fortune were as great as theirs. This was not a problem while he could still get credit, but that did not last. Brummel could borrow money based on his closeness to the Prince. But in 1811, the Prince became Regent and began abandoning all his old Whig friends.\nDownfall.\nBrummell, Lord Alvanley, Henry Mildmay and Henry Pierrepoint were the prime movers of \"Watier's\", called \"the Dandy Club\" by Byron. They were also the four hosts of the masquerade ball in July 1813. There an event occurred which ruined Brummel. The Prince Regent greeted Alvanley and Pierrepoint, but then \"cut\" Brummell and Mildmay by snubbing them, staring them in the face but not speaking to them. This provoked Brummell's remark, which became famous: \"Alvanley, who's your fat friend?\". This widened the rift between them. \nNormally, the loss of royal favour to a favourite was doom, but Brummell had the approval and friendship of other leading people. He became a favourite without a patron, still in charge of fashion and courted by large segments of society.\nHowever, his debts spun out of control and, when he tried to recover by various schemes, that only dug the hole deeper. In 1816, he fled to France to escape debtor's prison. Payment was demanded of thousands of pounds sterling owed by him. Usually, Brummell's gambling debts, as \"debts of honour\", were always paid immediately. The one exception to this was the final wager recorded for him in White's betting book. Recorded March, 1815, the debt was marked \"not paid, 20th January, 1816\". \nHe lived the remainder of his life in France. In the reign of William IV he got an appointment at Caen by the influence of Lord Alvanley and the Marquess of Worcester. This gave him a small annuity. His final comment to a visiting friend was \"My wallpaper and I are fighting a battle to the death. One of us has to go!\" He died penniless and insane from strokes in Caen in 1840.\nA statue of Brummell by Irena Sedlecka was erected on London's Jermyn Street in 2002."}

He studied architecture as an apprentice to Sir Robert Taylor for nine years.\nFrom 1810, Nash would take very few private commissions. He was a dedicated Whig and was a friend of Charles James Fox, who was Foreign Secretary in 1806. Perhaps through Fox, Nash came to the attention of the Prince Regent (later King George IV). For the rest of his career he would largely work for the Prince. His first major commissions in 1811 from the Prince was Regent Street and the development of an area then known as Marylebone Park.\nWith the Regent's backing Nash created a master plan for the area, put into action from 1818 onwards, which stretched from St James\u2019s northwards and included Regent Street, Regent's Park and its neighbouring streets, terraces and crescents of elegant town houses and villas. Nash did not complete all the detailed designs himself; in some instances, completion was left in the hands of other architects. Nash was employed by the Prince to develop his Ocean Pavilion Palace in Brighton, originally designed by Henry Holland. By 1822 Nash had finished his work on the Ocean Pavilion, which was now transformed into the Royal Pavilion.\nHis works.\nExamples of his work include:\nEngland &amp; Wales.\nJohn Pattisons house.

Even though the numbers may be similar, the source of the problem is different. In Sub-saharan Africa the main problem is high child mortality rates, and a large number of people who cannot meet their energy requirements. In South Asia, the main problem is the high number of malnurished children under the age of five. This may also be a consequence of the fact that women have a poorer education, and baby girls are not fed as well as baby boys."}

GP2 was started in 2005 after the Formula 3000 was stopped. The format was conceived by Bernie Ecclestone and Flavio Briatore, while Ecclestone also has the rights to the name GP1. In 2010 the GP3 Series class was launched, as a feeder class for the GP2 series.\nGP2 was designed to be an affordable racing series and a training series for Formula One. GP2 requires all of the teams to use the same chassis, engine and tyre supplier. Almost all races have taken place as support races on Formula One race weekends. Many drivers have used GP2 as a stepping stone into Formula One.\nGP2 Series cars.\nThe GP2 Series car is used by all of the teams, and features a Dallara chassis powered by a V8 Renault engine and Bridgestone tyres.\nThe 4\u00a0L Renault V8 engine features design and software upgrades designed to improve performance and fuel consumption. The engine produces about 620 bhp (432.5\u00a0kW). GP2 Series engines are rev-limited to 10,000 rpm.\nBridgestone supplying three slick tyre compounds for racing on dry (soft, medium and hard). They also provide a wet weather tyre. The choice of tyre to be raced is made by the Bridgestone and the GP2 Series organizers prior to each event.\nBrembo supplies the brakes.\nRace weekend.\nOn Friday, drivers have a 30-minute practice session and a 30-minute qualifying session. The qualifying session decides the grid order for Saturday's race which has a length of 180\u00a0kilometers.\nDuring Saturday's race, each driver has to make a pit stop in which at least two tyres have to be changed.\nOn Sunday there is a sprint race of 120\u00a0km. The grid is decided by the Saturday result with top 8 being reversed, so the driver who finished 8th on Saturday will start from pole position and the winner will start from 8th place.\nPoint system.\n2005-2011\nWith this points system, the most number of points anyone can score in one round is 20 by claiming pole position, winning both races with the fastest lap in each race. This has only been achieved twice in GP2 Racing's short history.

The person may be waiting for this care or may be receiving it or may have already received it. There is considerable lack of agreement about the precise meaning of the term \"patient.\" From the Latin verb \"patior\" meaning \"to suffer\" both in the sense of feeling pain and in the sense of forbearance. Thus, the two uses of the word \"patient\" -- as a noun denoting \"someone who suffers\" and as an adjective meaning \"to bear with forbearance\" -- stem from the same origin.\nPatient centered care is the hallmark of quality health care. This approach encourages respectful and responsive collaboration between health care professionals and patients and takes into consideration patients\u2019 preferences, needs and values. Understanding patient experience is a key step in moving toward patient-centered care. By looking at various aspects of patient experience, one can assess the extent to which patients are receiving care that is respectful of and responsive to individual patient.\nInpatient and Outpatient.\nInpatient care requires overnight hospitalization. Patients must stay at the medical facility where their procedure was done for at least one night. During this time, they remain under the supervision of a nurse or doctor.\nPatients receiving outpatient care don\u2019t need to spend a night in a hospital. They're free to leave the doctor\u2019s office, outpatient clinic or hospital once the procedure is over. Sometimes, they need to wait while anesthesia wears off or to make sure there aren\u2019t any complications. As long as there aren\u2019t any serious complications, though, patients don\u2019t have to spend the night being supervised."}

It served as a feeder series to Formula One. In 1985 it was replaced by Formula 3000. In 2008 the FIA announced that Formula Two would return for 2009 season in the form of the FIA Formula Two Championship. The goal is to develop a low-cost series to allow young drivers a chance to compete in the highest levels of motor racing.\nHistory.\nFormula One is generally regarded as the top open-wheeled auto racing series. Because of the high performance and expense of the cars, a lower level racing series was needed for developing drivers and teams. For much of the history of F1, Formula Two was that step in the racing ladder.\nPre-war.\nBefore the Second World War, there was a division of racing cars smaller and less powerful than the Grand Prix racers. This division was usually called voiturette (\"small car\") racing. It provided a place for amateur or less experienced drivers and smaller team to prove themselves.\nOfficial beginnings (post war\u20131953).\nIn 1946, Formula A (later known at Formula 1) was introduced. The old 1.5\u00a0L voiturette formula was replaced with 3.0\u00a0L supercharged cars.\nFormula Two (first known as Formula B) was first formally defined in 1948 by the FIA as a smaller and cheaper racers to complement to the Grand Prix cars of the era.\nThe engines 2.0\u00a0L normally aspirated or 750\u00a0cc supercharged. The 750\u00a0cc engines were rarely used. This brought new manufactures, such as Cooper to move up to Formula Two. Formula One in its early years was very expensive. There were so few cars entered for the 1952 and 1953 that the World Championship Grand Prix races were run to Formula Two rules.\nFormula Two development.\nF2 started to decline with the arrival of the 2.5\u00a0L Formula One in 1954. A new format of Formula Two was introduced for 1957 with 1.5\u00a0L engines. This became dominated by rear-engined Coopers and \"Bobtail\" sports car. Porsches cars based on their RSK sports cars enjoying some success. Ferrari originally developed their 'Sharknose' Dino 156 as an F2 car. The dominant engine was the Coventry-Climax FPF four cylinder.\nFormula Junior was introduced in 1959. It tried to replace F3 and F2. It was realised that it needed to be split up. F2 and F3 were reintroduced for the 1964 season. F2 cars had a 1.0\u00a0L engine. Many F1 stars drove in the F2 series on their \"off-days\". \nBy the late 1960s, many felt the gap between F1 and F2 too wide. A new 1.6\u00a0L production-based engine formula for F2 was introduced. This brought the series back to a feeder series for F1. The most popular engine was the Cosworth FVA. \nIn 1967, the FIA introduced the European Formula Two Championship. Jacky Ickx, driving a Matra MS5, won the first championship. \nIn 1972, the formula was changed to increase power. 2.0\u00a0L production-based engines were allowed. Cosworth BDs and BMW four-cylinder engines dominated the early years. BMW-powered Marches slowly gained the lead. For 1976, race only engines were permitted.\nFormula 3000.\nAfter the 1984 season, Formula Two was upgraded to Formula 3000. This was an attempt to merge F2-style chassis with the normally-aspirated 3000cc Cosworth DFV V8 engines. These engines were now obsolete in the all-turbocharged Formula One.\nGP2 Series.\nF3000 was replaced by the GP2 Series in 2005. To save money, standard 4000cc V8 engines are used. They provided 580\u00a0hp at low a cost. \nRevival of F2 (2008-present).\nThe Formula Two name returned in 2009, following an FIA announcement on 25 June 2008.\nMotorSport Vision (MSV) won the contract to supply chassis and engines for the new FIA Formula Two Championship. MSV is also the promoter of the Championship as well as the operating entity for all of the cars.\nThe cars were designed by Williams Grand Prix Engineering Ltd and prepared by MotorSport Vision (MSV). The open wheel chassis is powered by a 1.8L turbocharged Audi engine developed by Mountune Racing. The new F2 cars are aimed to fall between F1 and F3 in performance. MSV, owned by former Formula One driver, Jonathan Palmer. The first championship was won by Andy Soucek. The season was marred by the death of Henry Surtees during Round 4 at Brands Hatch.\nOther Formula Two series.\nA number of other Formula Two series have existed around the world. They include Japanese Formula Two (now known as Formula Nippon), Australian Formula 2 (since 1964). Other national Formula Two series include Mexican, Brazilian, Argentina, and South American. The British Formula 3000 series was briefly known as Formula Two."}

Nakajima also served as Williams' test driver, completing 7,000\u00a0km of testing for the team.\nNakajima's first year in GP2 finished with no wins, but five consecutive podiums and ended the year as top rookie.\nFormula One.\nIt was announced on 9 October 2007 that following the retirement of Alexander Wurz, Nakajima would race for Williams in the season finale in Brazilian Grand Prix. Nakajima finished tenth in the race. He set the fifth fastest lap \u2013 quicker than his team-mate Nico Rosberg, who finished fourth. \nOn 7 November it was confirmed by Williams that Nakajima would partner Rosberg at the Williams team for the season. He had a successful start to 2008 at the Australian Grand Prix. He finishing seventh but promoted to sixth after Rubens Barrichello was disqualified. He then finished seventh in the Spanish Grand Prix. Nakajima scored two points at Monaco. He was the first Japanese Formula One driver to scored a point at Monaco. Nakajima scored again at the British Grand Prix. In Singapore, Nakajima made it to the third qualifying round for the first time. He qualifyed 10th and finish eighth and scored a point.\nNakajima was retained by Williams for the season. At the Australian Grand Prix he crashed into the wall at turn six, putting him out of the race. Nakajima also retired at Bahrain. He crashed two laps from the end of the Monaco Grand Prix whilst running in 10th place. At the British Grand Prix, Nakajima qualifying in an fifth place, hi highest starting spot. Nakajima finished the season without scoring a single point.\nWilliams signed Rubens Barrichello and Nico H\u00fclkenberg for 2010, leaving Nakajima without a seat. Stefan GP announced on 19 February 2010 that Nakajima was one of the team's drivers. Strefan GP was built from the remains of the Toyota F1 team. Toyota had withdrawn from F1 in late 2009. Stefan GP did not have an entry to the 2010 Formula One season. The FIA ruled that Stefan GP could not be entered for the season at such a late stage. That left Nakajima with no ride in Formula One for 2010."}

Rhenock had the first police out post in the state, which is the historical event.\nHistory.\nRhenock was covered with dense forest in and around the 13th century. The Lepchas were the early settlers about six to five hundred years ago. After the Lepchas, Bhutias settled in the villages presently known as Kyongsa, Aritar &amp; Chalisey. The people who settled here after 16th century were mostly from Nepali ethnic group such as Newars, Bahuns (Adhikari, Paudel, Gautam, Dahal, Bhandari and Achaarja), Chhetri (Subedi, Khatiwada &amp; Bista), Gurung, Rai and Limboo.\nPeople.\nRhenock is inhabited by the people of different ethnic groups such as Lepchas, Bhutias, Nepalis (Gorkhas), Biharis and Marwaris.

They usually eat shellfishes that are found on beaches and mud. The Eurasian Oystercatcher uses its sharp bill to open the shells of oysters and mussels. It cuts the muscle between the two halves of the shell together, or it crashes the shell against a rock and eats the oyster inside.\nLifestyle and adaptations.\nThe oystercatcher has the heaviest bill (= beak) of any living wader. They have \"resource polymorphism\": they have some different beak types, and each type is used for a different kind of feeding. Unusually, the polymorphism is not genetically determined. It seems individuals are able to change their beak to suit their food. They do, of course, inherit an ability to adapt their feeding behaviour.\n\"Stabbers\" work by jabbing their bill tips between the valves of a mussel's shell. \"Hammerers\" open mussel shells by banging down on them; some hammerers only break the dorsal side, others only break the ventral side. Still others feed on worms, and they have narrow, tweezer-like bill tips.\nThe bird's bills grow at 0.4\u00a0mm per day, which is four times as fast as human fingernails. Individuals forced to switch from mussel-eating to worm-eating were able to change their bill shape in 10 days.\nWith bills like that, oystercatchers are dangerous opponents for other birds. They can fight off predators, and often raid other birds to steal their catches. \"They attack other birds at an average of five-minute intervals during low tide\". They get as much as 60% of their food by theft.\nOystercatchers may live to 35 years."}

It uses small, open, four-wheeled vehicles called karts, go-karts, or gearbox/shifter karts depending on the design. They are usually raced on scaled-down kart circuits. Karting is commonly seen as the stepping stone to the higher and more expensive ranks of motorsports.\nKarts vary widely in speed. Some known as Superkarts can reach speeds exceeding . Go-karts for the general public used for fun may be limited to speeds of . \nHistory.\nArt Ingels is generally accepted to be the father of karting. He was a long time hot rodder and a race car builder at Kurtis Kraft. He built the first kart in Southern California in 1956. \nComponents.\nChassis.\nThe chassis are made of steel tube. There is no suspension. The chassis must flex enough to work as the suspension. \nBraking is achieved by a disc brake mounted on the rear axle. Front disc brakes are becoming popular. Some classes do not allow them.\nEngines.\nAmusement park go-karts can be powered by 4-stroke engines or electric motors. Racing karts use small 2-stroke or 4-stroke engines.\nTransmission.\nKarts do not have a differential. Both rear wheels turn at the same speed. Because of this, one rear tire must slide while cornering. \nPower is transmitted from the engine to the rear axle by way of a chain.\nTires.\nWheels and tires are much smaller than those used on a normal car. \nLike other motorsports, karts use different tires for the track conditions. Slicks are used for dry weather. Rain tires or \"wets\" are used for wet weather. Slicks with grooves cut into them are used for dirt tracks. Spiked tires are used for ice. \nRacing.\nKart racing is generally accepted as the most economic form of motorsport available. As a fun pastime, it can be performed by almost anybody. As a motorsport, it is regulated by FIA (under the name of Commission Internationale de Karting (CIK).\nIn the USA, many organizations regulate racing, such as the International Kart Federation (IKF), World Karting Association (WKA), Karters of America Racing Triad (KART), and Stars of Karting presented by the Indy Racing League. In the UK, the Motor Sports Association (MSA) regulate Karting. In Australia, kart racing is administered by the Australian Karting Association on the behalf of FIA and Confederation of Australian Motor Sport (CAMS).\nKarting as a learning tool.\nKart racing is usually used as a low-cost and relatively safe way to introduce drivers to motor racing. Many people think it is for young drivers, but adults are also very active in karting. Karting is considered a first step in a racer's career. It can help develop quick reflexes, precision car control, and decision-making skills. \nRecreational, concession and indoor karts.\nBesides traditional kart racing, many commercial enterprises offer karts for rent, often called \"recreational\" or \"concession\" karts. The tracks can be indoor or outdoor. Karts are rented by sessions (10 to 15 minutes usually), they use sturdy chassis completed with bodywork for driver safety. \nOutdoor tracks can offer low speed karts strictly for amusement, or faster, more powerful karts similar to a racing kart. Typically, these outdoor tracks may also be used for traditional kart races.\nOther websites.\nGoverning Bodies:"}

Its chemical formula is BaCO3. It contains barium and carbonate ions.\nProperties.\nBarium carbonate is a white solid. It does not dissolve in water. It reacts with acids to make barium salts. It turns into barium oxide and carbon dioxide when heated. It reacts with sulfuric acid to make barium sulfate though.\nOccurrence.\nBarium carbonate occurs as witherite. Witherite is the main source of barium salts. It is more easily turned into other barium compounds than barium sulfate, barite. It is heavily mined in Northumberland. It turns into barium sulfate when water containing sulfates flows through it.\nPreparation.\nIt can be purified from the natural ore, or it can be made by reacting barium sulfide with sodium carbonate. It can also be made by reacting barium sulfide with a mixture of carbon dioxide and water.\nUses.\nBarium carbonate is used to poison rats. It is also used in making bricks. It is also used to glaze ceramics. This glaze can make different colors.\nSafety.\nBarium carbonate can dissolve in stomach acid, so it is toxic. There is a controversy over whether it should be used as a glaze."}

In 1960, he wrote \"The Conscience of a Conservative\". The book was a best seller. In 1964, he was the Republican candidate for President. He ran against Lyndon Johnson. Goldwater's most famous quote (which he said in July 1964 in San Francisco) was \"Extremism in the Defense of Liberty is no vice, and Moderation in the Pursuit of Justice is no virtue.\" He meant that people should always do what was necessary to make the world freer and more just even if it was hard or made them unpopular. Goldwater lost to Johnson by a large number of votes.\nGoldwater went back to the Senate after losing the election. His run for president helped start the conservative movement of today, which agrees with many of Goldwater's ideas. He didn't agree with the social conservatives who were against abortion and gay rights. Goldwater stayed in the Senate until 1987. He helped Sandra Day O'Connor get on the Supreme Court. He passed a military reform law. Goldwater retired to Arizona after being in the Senate. He died in Arizona in 1998.\nPersonal.\nGoldwater enjoyed photography, airplanes, and radio. He collected Native American Kachina Dolls, which are made by the Native Americans of Arizona. He donated his collection to a museum. Goldwater had four children."}

Because of injuries, he did not get to play as much as he could have. In 22 games, he rushed 91 times for 534 yards and 4 touchdowns. He also had 23 kickoff returns, averaging 22.8 yards. In August 2009, Ivory was kicked off the Washington State team.\nIvory then went to Tiffin, a Division II school in Tiffin, Ohio, whose team was coached by Dave Walkosky. Walkosky had been a Washington State assistant coach. In Ivory's final year of college football, he had 39 rushes for 223 yards in five games before hurting his knee, which ended his season. Walkosky tried to get a medical redshirt exemption for Ivory, which would have let Ivory play another year, but he did not get one. Even though he did not play much at Tiffin, some NFL scouts saw Ivory's performance and speed, and some people thought he could become the first Tiffin player to be picked in the NFL Draft.

For example, the first stage he came up with is called the \"sensorimotor stage\". He believed that, from birth to two years old, children would learn that they are different from objects, and that even if the child left a room, things that were in the room would still be there.

It contains stars, gas, dust, dark matter and a supermassive black hole at its centre.\nGalaxies were long thought to be nebulae. The spiral nebula as a type was first described by Edwin Hubble in his 1936 work \"The Realm of the Nebulae\". They are now listed as galaxies, and are named after their shape.\nThe barred spiral galaxy is an important and common type of spiral galaxy. There are three other kinds of spiral galaxies. \"Grand-design\" spiral galaxies have two well-shaped and well-defined arms. \"Multiple-arm\" spiral galaxies have more arms. In \"flocculent\" spiral galaxies, it is hard to see the arms at all, as they are choppy and are ill-defined.\nAbout 60% of galaxies in the universe near us (the 'local universe') are spiral and irregular galaxies. They are mostly found in low-density parts of the universe, and are rare in the centers of galaxy clusters.\nSpiral arms.\nSpiral arms are regions in spiral galaxies. They often contain dust,gas and star clusters of young ,hot and massive stars. They extend from the central bulge area of spiral and barred spiral galaxies. The young, hot and massive stars are why the arms are brighter than the center of the galaxy. Some spiral galaxies have yellow, 'fossil' arms of older stars.\nMilky Way.\nOur own Milky Way was found to be a spiral galaxy in the early 20th century. In the 1990s it was found to be a barred spiral galaxy. The bar is difficult to see from our position in the Galactic disk. The most convincing evidence for its existence comes from a survey, performed by the Spitzer Space Telescope, of stars in the Galactic center."}

Hubble's findings changed the scientific view of the universe.\nIn 1925 he showed that there are galaxies beyond our own, the Milky Way. Also, he developed a method for classifying galaxies.\nThen he proved the galaxies were moving away from each other. Hubble found the degree of Doppler effect (redshift) from a galaxy increased in proportion to its distance from Earth. Doppler effect is the change in pitch or colour when an object or sound comes in (higher pitch, brighter color) or moves away (lower and darker). Redshift is observed in the light spectrum\nIn 1929 Hubble formulated what is called Hubble's law. The law states that the greater the distance between any two galaxies, the greater their relative speed of separation. Georges Lema\u00eetre, a Belgian priest and astronomer, had published the idea two years before in an obscure journal. Nevertheless, the idea bears Hubble's name to this day.\nToday, the 'apparent velocities' of galaxies are understood as an increase in proper distance which occurs due to the expansion of space. Light traveling through stretching space experiences a Hubble-type redshift.\nThis work helped to establish that the universe is expanding. Some have incorrectly said that Hubble discovered the Doppler shift in the spectra of galaxies, but this had already been observed earlier by Vesto Slipher, whose data Hubble used.\nThe Hubble Space Telescope was named after Hubble.\nFour major achievements.\nAccording to Sandage, Hubble achieved four main things:\nHubble's personal opinion on the data.\nHubble himself did not see his 1929 data as evidence for an expanding Universe. Even six years later, Hubble wrote:\nInflation as an explanation for expansion.\nHubble's words were forgotten, and the notion of the expansion of the universe became the consensus. Until the theoretical developments in the 1980s no one had an explanation for why this seemed to be the case. The question \"why is the universe expanding?\" is now answered by understanding the details of what happened in the first inflationary epoch (10\u221232 seconds) of the existence of our universe."}

It is the home of the Indianapolis 500 race and the Brickyard 400 race.\nIt was built in 1909. It is the original \"Speedway\", the first racing facility to use the word Speedway. IMS has permanent seating for more than 257,000 people. The infield raises capacity to approximately 400,000. It is the largest and highest-capacity sporting facility in the world.\nThe Speedway is considered relatively flat by American standards but high-banked by Europeans. It is a two and a half mile, nearly rectangular oval. Each of the four turns are 1/4 mile. Two 5/8 mile long straight connect turns 2 to 3 and turns 4 to 1. Two 1/8 mile short straights, termed \"short chutes\", connect turns 1 to 2 and turns 3 to 4.\nA modern infield road course was constructed between 1998 and 2000. It used part of the oval and the infield to create a track. In 2008, the road course was changed to add another infield section. This is used for motorcycle racing, and is a course.\nOn the grounds of the Speedway is the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame Museum, which opened in 1956. It is also the home of the Brickyard Crossing Golf Resort, which originally opened as the Speedway Golf Course in 1929.\nIndianapolis Motor Speedway was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1987.\nIn addition to the Indianapolis 500, the Speedway also hosts NASCAR's Brickyard 400. The Speedway also hosted the United States Grand Prix for Formula One from 2000 to 2007. In 2008, the Speedway added the Indianapolis motorcycle Grand Prix.\nAfter winning his fifth United States Grand Prix at Indianapolis in , Formula One driver Michael Schumacher holds the record for most victories with the Forumula One version of the road course. A.J. Foyt, Al Unser and Rick Mears each won the Indianapolis 500 four times on the traditional oval. Jeff Gordon has also won four times on the oval in the Brickyard 400. Johnny Aitken holds the record for total wins at the track, with 15 victories (all on the oval), during the 1909, 1910 and 1916 seasons.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe first motorsports event at the track consisted of 7 motorcycle races, sanctioned by the Federation of American Motorcyclists (FAM), on August 14, 1909.\nThe first weekend of automobile races took place August 19\u201321, 1909. It was 16 races sanctioned by the American Automobile Association (AAA). The event almost turned into a disaster because of the surface of crushed stone and tar. There were several accidents and five fatalities. The final race of the weekend was halted after of its originally-scheduled 300 miles.\nCarl G. Fisher, was an Indiana native, and both a former race car driver and one of the owners of the track. He led the work to make the track safer for the drivers and spectators. The track surface was paved with 3.2 million paving bricks. This gave the track its popular nickname \"The Brickyard\". Today, (one yard) of the original bricks remain at the start/finish line., still giving meaning to the 'brick yard'. The final brick added to the roadway was a gold plated brick and laid by Governor Thomas R. Marshall on December 17, 1909.\nThe Speedway reopened in 1910. Sixty-six automobile races were held during three holiday weekends (Memorial Day, Fourth of July and Labor Day). Each weekend featured two or three races of to distance. Several shorter contests were also held. Each race was its own event and earned its own trophy. All races were sanctioned by the AAA. In 1911, a change in marketing focus led to holding only one race per year.\nAn estimated 80,000 spectators came to the first Indianapolis 500 Mile Race on Memorial Day May 30, 1911. Admission was one dollar. Ray Harroun won the race at the average speed of 74.602\u00a0mph (120.060\u00a0km/h).\nThe next five Indianapolis 500 were held from 1912\u20131916. Three of the Indy 500 winners were Europeans. These races drew worldwide attention to the Speedway. More international drivers began to enter.\nThe 1916 race was shortened to 120 laps for . Several things caused the race to be shortened . There was a lack of entries from Europe and a lack of oil. Another reason was out of respect for the war in Europe.\nOn September 9, 1916, the Speedway hosted a day of short racing events. These were called the Harvest Classic. There were three races held at 20, 50 and distances. Johnny Aitken, in a Peugeot, won all three events, his final victories at the track. After the Harvest Classic, no race other than the Indianapolis 500 to be held on the grounds for seventy-eight years.\nRacing was interrupted in 1917\u20131918 by World War I. The facility served as a military center for repairs.\nRacing resumed in 1919. Speeds quickly increased. In 1925 Peter DePaolo became the first to average 100\u00a0mph (160\u00a0km/h) for the race.\nBy the early 1930s, the increasing speeds began to make the track more dangerous. In the period 1931\u20131935 there were 15 fatalities. Part of the bricks were replaced with tarmac (a tar covered macadam or small stones). During the 1935\u20131936 seasons a number of changes were made. The inside wall was removed in the corners. The outside wall angle was changed to help keep cars inside the track. Hard crash helmets became required. The first yellow lights were installed around the track.\n1940s: Start of the Hulman Era.\nAt the beginning of the 1940s, the track needed more improvement. In 1941, half of the garage area, known as \"Gasoline Alley\", burned down before the race. When the United States joined World War II, the 1942 race was canceled. In 1942 all auto racing was banned. The 500-Mile Race was canceled for the years 1942\u20131945. The track mostly abandoned during the war years.\nOn November 29, 1944, three-time 500 winner Wilbur Shaw came back to do a tire test for Firestone. The test was approved by the government. Shaw found the track to be in very bad condition. He contacted the owner, Eddie Rickenbacker, and found that the Speedway was for sale. Shaw tried to find a buyer that would keep the Speedway as a race track. He found Indiana businessman Tony Hulman. The Speedway was purchased on November 14, 1945.\nMajor renovations and repairs were made to the Speedway. It opened in time for the 1946 race. Many improvements have been made since 1946.\nThe 500-Mile Race became part of the Formula One World Championship for 11 years (1950\u20131960). None of the regular Indy drivers raced in Formula One. Alberto Ascari from Ferrari was the only F1 driver to race in the 500 during this time.\nIn October 1961, the final remaining brick sections of the track were paved over with asphalt, with the exception of a distinct three-foot-wide line of bricks at the start/finish line. The \"Brickyard\" thus became known for its \"Yard of Bricks\".\nNASCAR IROC and Indy Lights at Indy.\nFrom 1919 to 1993, the 500 was the only race run at the Brickyard. Tony George (Hulman's grandson) inherited the track. He brought more racing to the Speedway. NASCAR started racing in 1994 with the Brickyard 400. The International Race of Champions (IROC) event was added in 1998. The last IROC at Indy race was held in 2003.\nIn 2003, the Firestone Indy Lights Series, a minor league series of the Indy Racing League, started racing at the Speedway. They were the first series to race in May other than the 500 since 1910.\nFormula One and road course racing.\nIn 1998, Tony George made a deal to bring Formula One back to the United States. The last time F1 raced in the US was 1991. A new Indy-based road course using part of the oval track, and part of the infield was built in two years. The first United States Grand Prix held at the Speedway was in 2000. The 2001 event reported 185,000 fans were reported in attendance. The success was even more important with the race. The race was held on September 30, 2001. It was the largest international sporting event held in the United States after September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.\nUnlike the oval track, the Grand Prix road course is raced in a clockwise direction. This follows the general practice of Formula One, in where most circuits run clockwise.\nOn July 12, 2007, it was announced that Formula One would not return to the Speedway for . Tony George said there were problems meeting the demands of Bernie Ecclestone to continue hosting the event. On May 25, 2010 it was announced that Formula One would return to the United States in 2012 at a new purpose-built track in Austin, Texas.\nTire problems.\nIn 2005, there was a big problem with some of the Formula One tires. During practice, there was a big crash at turn 13. This part of the F1 circuit is the turn 1 of the oval track. This is also the only banked corner on the F1 calendar. Michelin realized their tires could not handle the banking. They would fail after a few laps. The cars using Bridgestone tires did not have the problem.\nThe Michelin teams could not solve the problem. Michelin wanted to add a chicane before the turn. The FIA would not allow the track to be modified. Everyone involved tried to fix the problem right up to race. Michelin told their teams the tires were not safe to race with.\nThe Michelin teams lined up on the starting grid. They drove around the track for the slow parade lap. At the end of the lap, they pulled into the pits and parked their cars. This left only the three Bridgestone teams (six race cars) to run the race. The two Ferrari cars were the only cars on the lead lap at the end of the race.\nMotorcycle racing and a new road course.\nOn July 16, 2007, the Speedway announced that it would host a round of Grand Prix motorcycle racing beginning in 2008. The race was backed by Red Bull and known as the \"Red Bull Indianapolis GP\". This was the first motorcycle racing event at the facility since its first month of operation, in August 1909.\nModifications approved by the FIA and FIM were made to the former Formula One circuit. The new circuit now has 16 turns. The motorcycle course runs counter-clockwise, the same direction as the oval track. It bypass the banking of the oval with a new infield section inside Turn 1. Also, the double-hairpin at the Hulman Straight was replaced with traditional S-turns. The construction was finished before the opening day of the 2008 Indianapolis 500.\nOther sporting events.\nThe city of Indianapolis has hosted a half-marathon. It includes one lap around the Speedway.\nThe Speedway Golf Course has hosted a PGA Tour event and an LPGA event. A Champions Tour event was hosted there from 1994\u20131999.\nAt the 1987 Pan American Games, the speedway hosted opening ceremonies and the speed roller skating competition.\nIMS will be used to host events when Indianapolis hosts Super Bowl XLVI in February 2012.\nSpeed records.\nIndianapolis 500\nBrickyard 400\nUnited States Grand Prix\nRed Bull Indianapolis GP"}

Mao had thought that a bigger population resulted in a stronger country, but of course, they faced a lot more problems. China had gone above carrying capacity and there were not enough resources for everyone. After the Second World War, the Chinese population grew quickly. In 1979, the one-child policy was introduced. The policy was introduced to control population growth and declares that Chinese families should only have one child. There are a few exceptions to this rule.\nBeyond the exceptions, if a couple wanted to have more than one child, they must pay money to the government. In some places in China, couples were able to get a permit so they would not have to pay the fee. Because most families would not be able to afford the fee, women were often forced to have an abortion. There were punishments for those who had a second child. However, if the first child were to be a female, the couple could try to have a second child, in hopes of a male child. Since it was started in 1979, the policy has prevented 400 million births from happening. About 36% of the Chinese population is affected by the rule. The policy does not apply in some areas, such as Hong Kong, Macau or Tibet.\nAfter more than 30 years of the one-child policy, China started to face a population ageing problem. And as the Chinese economy developed rapidly in recent years, the workforce also became tight. In 2015, it was decided that the one-child policy was to be removed and instead allowed couples to have two children for the first time in thirty years. Effective from January 2016, the one-child policy was replaced by a two-child policy, allowing each couple to have two children.\nEven before the policy was introduced, China took many steps to encourage families to have fewer children. These steps included messages preaching the importance of family planning. There was one such of these messages that was a sign put up in Tang Shan that read, 'For a prosperous and powerful nation and a happy family, please use birth planning'. There were also incentives and rewards for those who only had one child, which continued through the one-child policy. Some of these included access to government services, better employment opportunities, higher wages, longer maternity leave, quality childcare, and better housing."}

It starred several well-known British actors including Arthur Lowe, John Le Mesurier, John Laurie Bill Pertwee, and Clive Dunn.\nIt was written by Jimmy Perry and David Croft based partly on Jimmy Croft's experience in the Home Guard but also on the work of comedians such as Will Hay.\nPlot.\nThe Home Guard were set up in 1940 to protect Britain in the case of invasion. Because most young men were in the regular army, Home Guard platoons were usually made up of older people. The show followed the Walmington-on-Sea platoon, led by Captain Mainwaring (pronounced \"Mannering\"), a bank manager who appoints himself leader.\nHis platoon is made up of his posh sergeant, Wilson, elderly butcher Lance Corporal Jones, several senior citizens (Privates Godfrey and Frazer), as well as a \"spiv\" (Private Walker) and a mother's boy (Private Pike), as well as other men who don't say much. The humour is derived from their antics, as well as the relationship between Mainwaring and his upper-class sergeant.\nIn early episodes, the humour was based on the difficulty of starting the platoon without any weapons. In later episodes, the comedy was often based on the characters. Because the platoon rarely encountered the Nazis, their enemy was usually the grumpy ARP Warden Hodges, played by Bill Pertwee."}

{"id": "265977", "revid": "70336", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=265977", "title": "History of astronomy", "text": "The history of astronomy describes the ideas of earlier civilisations. It also discusses the beginnings of modern astronomy.\nEarly history.\nBabylonian astronomers viewed the sky as a celestial sphere, far above the Earth. This sphere had shiny stars on it. Like earlier astronomers, they organized and named constellations. They took special interest in the seven bright stars that did not stay in a particular constellation. These were the Star of the Day (Sun), the Star of the Night (Moon) and the five planets. These stars wandered around the celestial sphere, in an area now called the Zodiac, and the astronomers carefully recorded their travels.\nAncient Greece.\nGreek philosophers, seeing the movement of heavenly bodies, developed models of the Universe based more on empirical evidence. The first model was proposed by Eudoxus of Cnidos. According to this model, space and time are infinite and eternal, the Earth is spherical and stationary, and all other matter is confined to rotating concentric spheres.\nThis model was brought into agreement with astronomical observations by Ptolemy of Alexandria, in the second century AD. His \"Syntaxis mathematica\", known as the \"Almagest\", was translated from Greek to Arabic, and from Arabic to Latin. It was first printed in 1515, with another edition in 1528.\nHowever, not all Greek scientists accepted the geocentric (Earth-centered) model of the Universe. The Pythagorean philosopher Philolaus thought the center of the Universe was a \"central fire\" around which the Earth, Sun, Moon and Planets revolved in uniform circular motion.\nThe Greek astronomer Aristarchus of Samos was the first person to propose a heliocentric (Sun-centered) model of the universe. Though the original text has been lost, a reference in Archimedes' book \"The Sand Reckoner\" describes Aristarchus' heliocentric theory. Archimedes wrote: (translated into English)\nYou King Gelon are aware the 'Universe' is the name given by most astronomers to the sphere the center of which is the center of the Earth, while its radius is equal to the straight line between the center of the Sun and the center of the Earth. This is the common account as you have heard from astronomers. But Aristarchus has brought out a book consisting of certain hypotheses, wherein it appears, as a consequence of the assumptions made, that the universe is many times greater than the 'Universe' just mentioned. His hypotheses are that the fixed stars and the Sun remain unmoved, that the Earth revolves about the Sun on the circumference of a circle, the Sun lying in the middle of the orbit, and that the sphere of fixed stars, situated about the same center as the Sun, is so great that the circle in which he supposes the Earth to revolve bears such a proportion to the distance of the fixed stars as the center of the sphere bears to its surface.\nAristarchus thus believed the stars to be very far away, and saw this as the reason why there was no visible parallax, that is, an observed movement of the stars relative to each other as the Earth moved around the Sun. The stars are in fact much farther away than was generally assumed in ancient times, which is why stellar parallax is only detectable with telescopes. The rejection of the heliocentric view was apparently quite strong, as the following passage from Plutarch suggests (\"On the apparent face in the orb of the Moon\"):\nCleanthes [a contemporary of Aristarchus and head of the Stoics] thought it was the duty of the Greeks to indict Aristarchus of Samos on the charge of impiety for putting in motion the Hearth of the universe [i.e. the Earth], . . . supposing the heaven to remain at rest and the earth to revolve in an oblique circle, while it rotates, at the same time, about its own axis. \nThe only other astronomer from antiquity known by name who supported Aristarchus' heliocentric model was Seleucus of Seleucia. He was a Babylonian astronomer a century after Aristarchus. According to Plutarch, Seleucus was the first to prove the heliocentric system through reasoning, but it is not known what arguments he used. Seleucus' arguments for a heliocentric theory were probably related to the phenomenon of tides. According to Strabo (1.1.9), Seleucus was the first to state that the tides are due to the attraction of the Moon, and that the height of the tides depends on the Moon's position relative to the Sun.\nCopernicus.\nThe geocentric model was accepted in the Western world for about two thousand years, until Copernicus revived Aristarchus' theory that the sun was placed at the center of the Solar System.\nAs noted by Copernicus himself, the suggestion that the Earth rotates (goes round on its axis) was very old, dating at least to Philolaus (c. 450 BC). About a century before Copernicus, Nicholas of Cusa also proposed that the Earth rotates on its axis in his book, \"On Learned Ignorance\" (1440).p754\nThe first empirical evidence for the Earth's rotation on its axis, using the phenomenon of comets, was given by Tusi (1201\u20131274).\nCopernicus' heliocentric model allowed the stars to be placed uniformly through the (infinite) space surrounding the planets, as first proposed by Thomas Digges in his \"Perfit Description of the Caelestiall Orbes according to the most aunciente doctrine of the Pythagoreans, latelye revived by Copernicus and by Geometricall Demonstrations approved\" (1576). Giordano Bruno accepted the idea that space was infinite and filled with solar systems similar to our own. n; for the publication of his various beliefs, he was burnt at the stake in Rome on 17 February 1600.\nThis cosmology was accepted provisionally by Isaac Newton, Christiaan Huygens and later scientists, but it had several paradoxes which were resolved only with general relativity. The first paradox was that it assumed that space and time were infinite, and that the stars in the universe had been burning forever; however, since stars are constantly radiating energy, a finite star seems inconsistent with the radiation of infinite energy. Secondly, Edmund Halley (1720) noted that an infinite space filled uniformly with stars would lead to the prediction that the nighttime sky would be as bright as the sun itself; this became known as Olbers' paradox in the 19th century. Third, Newton himself showed that an infinite space uniformly filled with matter would cause infinite forces and instabilities crushing matter inwards inwards under gravity. This instability was later clarified in 1902.\n18th century.\nAs observations on the Solar System progressed, some basic facts appeared. All planets go round the Sun in the same direction, and their planes of revolution are very similar. Likewise, most satellites go round planets in nearly the same planes. The planets revolve around their own axes in the same sense in which they orbit the Sun. These regularities cannot be a chance coincidence.\nMany were at work trying to use the ideas of Newton and Kepler to explain the observational astronomy provided by the new, larger, telescopes.\nA significant astronomical advance of the 18th century was the realization by Thomas Wright (1711\u20131786) that the \"fixed stars\" were not scattered at random, but concentrated in what we now call the \"galactic plane\", our view of the Milky Way. What is even more remarkable is his idea that very faint nebulae, in which \"no one star... can possibly be distinguished\" might be extremely distant groups of the same kind.p83/4\nKant (1724\u20131804), known today for his philosophy, made some important discoveries about the nature of the Earth's rotation. He showed the frictional resistance against tidal currents on the Earth's surface must cause a very gradual slowing of the earth's rotation. The days have grown longer as time has passed. Also, he laid out a nebular hypothesis, in which he deduced that the Solar System formed from a large cloud of gas, a nebula. Following Wright, Kant also thought the Milky Way was a large disk of stars formed from a (much larger) spinning cloud of gas.\nThe greatest theoretician of the 18th century was Laplace (1749\u20131827), who worked on the mechanics of the planets and Solar System. His massive 5-volume work on the mechanics of the Solar System explained many of the regularities which observations had discovered. Laplace made good use of another Frenchman's mathematics: Lagrange (1736\u20131813).\nLaplace is also noteworthy for his nebular hypothesis of the evolution of the Solar System. As it happens, the details of Laplace's theory do not quite work out for planetary systems, but they are the basis of how we understand stars condense out of a nebula.\nThe 18th century was also a century of great observers. William Herschel (1738\u20131822), helped by his sister Caroline (1750\u20131848) built the biggest telescope of the day (40-foot), but did his best work on a 20-foot telescope. There were problems with the mirror of the large one. The discovery of Uranus put his career on the way: he got a salary of \u00a3200 a year as \"King's Astronomer\". He got a rough idea of where we are in the galaxy, and could see other spiral galaxies. He called them \"island universes\" like the Milky Way. Also he began to work out the motions of different stars. He discovered double stars, and published catalogues of them.p113/120 Herschel's observations brought astronomy into the modern era.\nModern era.\nThe modern era of physical cosmology began in 1917, when Albert Einstein first applied his general theory of relativity to model the structure and dynamics of the universe.\nTwo great discoveries changed our picture of the Universe. Both were made by Edwin Hubble in the 1920s. Before then, it was thought that our galaxy, the Milky Way, was the whole universe. Hubble first showed that the Andromeda galaxy was a separate galaxy and similar. Many more galaxies were soon discovered. Later in the 1920s he showed that all distant galaxies were moving away from each other in a general expansion of the universe. He did this by discovering the red shift of spectroscopic light from distant galaxies. That does not apply to galaxies that are clustered together, such as Andromeda which, along with our galaxy, is part of the Local Group in the Virgo Supercluster."}

He was a driver for the Toro Rosso Formula One team. He made his first F1 race start at the 2006 Bahrain Grand Prix. He was the first American to race in F1 since Michael Andretti in 1993. In 2008, Speed started racing in NASCAR. For 2009 and 2001, he drove the Red Bull Toyota Camry full time in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. Speed attempted to qualify for the 2011 Indianapolis 500, but did not make the race.\nEarly years.\nSpeed started kart racing at the age of 10. He moved up to Formula series in 2001. He was a champion in \"US Formula Russell\". He drove in both the \"US Barber Formula Dodge\" and \"US Star Mazda Series\". Speed won the 'Red Bull Driver Search' program. In 2003 he drove for the ADR team in \"British Formula Three\". During that year he fell ill with ulcerative colitis, a form of inflammatory bowel disease. He returned to the United States for treatment.\n2004 saw two championship titles for Speed. He won the \"Formula Renault 2000 Eurocup\" and later \"German Formula Renault\". This was despite his worsening colitis. This performance earned him a drive in the first season of GP2 Series for 2005. He ended the season third place in the driver championship standings behind Nico Rosberg and Heikki Kovalainen.\nAt the end of 2005, Speed drove the first three races of the new A1 Grand Prix series for \"A1 Team USA\".\nFormula One.\nIn 2005 at the Canadian Grand Prix, Speed took part as a test driver for Red Bull Racing; becoming the first American driver to participate in a Formula One event since Michael Andretti's 1993 stint. He was also the test driver for the United States Grand Prix.\nAfter the purchase of Minardi, Red Bull Racing announced the team would become Scuderia Toro Rosso. Speed and Vitantonio Liuzzi would be the drivers for the 2006 season.\nIn , Speed's first race was the Bahrain Grand Prix. His best finish of the season was a ninth place at the Australian Grand Prix. He would have finished Australia in the points, but had 25 seconds added to his race time for overtaking under yellow flags. At the United States Grand Prix he qualified a career best 13th. He was taken out of the race in a first-lap collision.\nScott Speed's season was disappointing. He had equipment breakdowns and several crashes. He spun off the circuit in wet conditions at the European Grand Prix. That turned out to be his last race for the team. After the race, it was reported that he was involved in a physical altercation with team principal Franz Tost. Tost has since denied this. Speed also said that they wanted to get rid of both him and Liuzzi. Before the next race at Hungary, the team announced that he had been replaced by Sebastian Vettel.\nARCA/REMAX Series.\nTo get ready for racing in NASCAR, Speed raced in the Automobile Racing Club of America (ARCA) series. he enter several races in 2007, and a full season in 2008. He drove the Red Bull-sponsored Toyota for Eddie Sharp Racing. Speed finished 5th in the points in 2008.\nDuring the finale of the 2008 ARCA season, Ricky Stenhouse Jr. hit Speed and sent him into the wall. This ended Speed chance at a good finish, and possibly a Championship. After repairs, Speed intentially ran his car into Stenhouse, sending both cars into the wall. Neither driver was injured. ARCA officials parked Speed for the day.\nNASCAR.\nSpeed made his Craftsman Truck Series debut at Atlanta Motor Speedway on March 7, 2008. He drove the Morgan-Dollar Motorsports #46 Cheverolet truck with Red Bull sponsorship. In his second race, he recorded his first Top 10 finish at Martinsville Speedway. He won his first career race on May 30 at Dover with Bill Davis Racing in a Toyota. On Sunday October 19, 2008, Scott Speed started his first Sprint Cup Series event at Martinsville Speedway. He finished in 30th place. He finished the Cup season in the #84 Red Bull Toyota Camry for the Red Bull Racing Team.\nFor the 2009 Sprint Cup season, Speed's car number was changed to #82. He won his first Rookie of the Race honor at the Daytona 500. Speed won the pole for the Sam\u2019s Town 300 in his Nationwide Series debut on February 28, 2009. He also broke the track record with a speed of 182.45\u00a0mph and a lap time of 29.42 seconds.\nFor the 2010 Sprint Cup season, Speed was still in the #82 car. He had a disappointing season, with only two top ten finishes. At the end of the year, Red Bull Racing release Speed from his contract. This move was to make room for the return of Brian Vickers and the addition of Kasey Kahne. Vickers was returning after heart surgery. Kahne was signed for a one-year deal.\nRed Bull Racing Lawsuit.\nWithin two weeks of leaving Red Bull Racing (RBR), Speed filed a lawsuit against the team for breach of contract. Breach of contract means that one person or group in the contract (RBR in this case) did not do the things they should have done. Speed is asking for $6.5 million US$ in the lawsuit. Speed alleges (says) that Red Bull significantly reduced its financial commitment to Speed's race team and was unable and/or unwilling to provide [Speed] with 'supporting equipment' satisfactory for a driver of [his] skill to [be] effective [to] compete in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Speed is claiming that Red Bull did not give his race team enough money or himself good enough race cars. Without the best race cars, it is hard to race at the same level as the top teams.\nOn July 28, 2011, Speed place a lien on RBR's property in Mooresville, North Carolina. The lien is for the race shop and the land it sits on. A lien is a legal tool to keep RBR from selling the property. The property can be used to ensure a debt is paid. RBR purchased the property for about $3.3 million US$.\nIndyCar.\nSpeed attempted to qualify for the 2011 Indianapolis 500. He drove a car entered by Dragon Racing. He was having trouble finding enough speed in the car to qualify. Dragon Racing put Patrick Carpentier in the car to test it. Carpentier spun and crashed the car. Dragon did not have another car for Speed to use. Speed was unable to qualify for the race.\nRacing record.\nCareer summary.\n\u2194 Competed in less that 75% of the races. Not eligible to score championship points.\n\u2020 Team results.\nPersonal information.\nSpeed currently resides in Mt.

This method is sometimes called making \"test tube babies\".\nHe began work on his ideas in the 1950s, and the first test tube baby, Louise Brown, was born on 25 July 1978. His research partner from 1968 was Patrick Steptoe (1913\u20131988). By 2010, more than 4 million babies had been born using the IVF method.\nEarly life.\nEdwards served in the military in World War II. In 1948, after the war, Edwards went to study at the University of Wales, then to the University of Edinburgh in 1951, where he completed his PhD. His studies had been on how embyros developed in mice. He had a research position at the California Institute of Technology in 1957. In 1958 he returned to England and began work for the National Institute of Medical Research. While at the Institute he began to study human fertilisation. In 1962, he took a up a new job at the University of Glasgow, but in 1963 went to Cambridge University. In 1965 he went back to the US where he was a visiting scientist at Johns Hopkins University and later at the University of North Carolina. he returned to Cambridge and taught physiology from 1969.\nIVF.\nWhile scientists had some success in fertilising rabbit eggs in a laboratory, Edwards soon discovered that the process for humans was quite different and much more complex. He spent many years studying the human egg, and how it could best be fertilised by sperm outside the body. He succeeded in fertilising an egg in 1969, but they did not develop. Patrick Steptoe was a British gynecologist who had done a lot of work using a laparoscope to investigate the ovaries. Using the laparoscope he was able to take eggs directly from the ovaries. Edwards was able to use these eggs and successfully fertilize them in a test tube, actually a cell culture dish. This discovery caused a lot of debate and discussions about whether this sort of study should be allowed to continue.\nFamily.\nHis wife was Ruth Fowler Edwards, the granddaughter of physicist Ernest Rutherford and daughter of physicist Ralph Fowler. He has 5 daughters and 12 grandchildren.\nDeath.\nEdwards died on 10 April 2013 after a long lung illness in England, aged 87."}

Prose writing tells a story, but rhythmic writing is often poetry. His prose text would fit into a standard poetry rhythm, or meter. This made subtle shift in mood. Usually the reader would not notice how the timing of the words changed their feeling.\nHis most famous novel is \"More Than Human\" (1953).\nBiography.\nSturgeon was born Edward Hamilton Waldo in Staten Island, New York City in 1918. His name was legally changed at age eleven after his mother's divorce and remarriage to William Dicky (\"Argylle\") Sturgeon. \"Theodore Sturgeon\" is occasionally misidentified as a pseudonym; it was in fact his legal name.\nHe sold his first story in 1938 to the McClure Syndicate, which bought much of his early (non-fantastic) work; his first genre appearance was \"Ether Breather\" in \"Astounding Science Fiction\" a year later. At first he wrote mainly short stories, primarily for genre magazines such as \"Astounding\" and \"Unknown\", but also for general-interest publications such as \"Argosy Magazine\". He used the pen name \"E. Waldo Hunter\" when two of his stories ran in the same issue of \"Astounding\". A few of his early stories were signed \"Theodore H. Sturgeon.\"\nSturgeon ghost-wrote an Ellery Queen mystery novel, \"The Player on the Other Side\" (Random House, 1963). This novel gained critical praise from critic H.R.F. Keating, who \"had almost finished writing \"Crime and Mystery: the 100 Best Books\", in which I had included \"The Player on the Other Side\" ... placing the book squarely in the Queen canon\" when he learned that it had been written by Sturgeon. Similarly, \"William DeAndrea, author and ... winner of Mystery Writers of America awards, selecting his ten favorite mystery novels for the magazine \"Armchair Detective\", picked \"The Player on the Other Side\" as one of them. He said: 'This book changed my life ... and made a raving mystery fan (and therefore ultimately a mystery writer) out of me. ... The book must be 'one of the most skilful pastiches in the history of literature. An amazing piece of work, whomever did it'.\"\nSturgeon wrote the screenplays for the ' episodes \"Shore Leave\" (1966) and \"Amok Time\" (1967, later published as a \"Fotonovel\" in 1978). The latter is known for his invention of the pon farr, the Vulcan mating ritual, the first use of the sentence \"Live long and prosper\" and the first use of the Vulcan hand symbol. Sturgeon also wrote several episodes of ' that were never produced. One of these was notable for having first introduced the Prime Directive. He also wrote an episode of the Saturday morning show \"Land of the Lost\", \"The Pylon Express\", in 1975. Two of Sturgeon's stories were adapted for The New Twilight Zone. One, \"A Saucer of Loneliness\", was broadcast in 1986 and was dedicated to his memory. Another short story, \"Yesterday was Monday\", was the inspiration for The New Twilight Zone episode A Matter of Minutes. His 1944 novella \"Killdozer!\" was the inspiration for the 1970s made-for-TV movie, Marvel comic book, and alternative rock band of the same name.\nAlthough Sturgeon is well-known among readers of classic science-fiction anthologies (at the height of his popularity in the 1950s he was the most anthologized author alive) and much respected by critics (John Clute writes in \"The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction\": \"His influence upon writers like Harlan Ellison and Samuel R. Delany was seminal, and in his life and work he was a powerful and generally liberating influence in post-WWII US sf\"), he is not much known among the general public and won comparatively few awards (though it must be noted that his best work was published before the establishment and consolidation of the leading genre awards, while his later production was scarcer and weaker). He was listed as a primary influence of the much more famous Ray Bradbury. Kurt Vonnegut based his character Kilgore Trout on Theodore Sturgeon.\nSturgeon died on May 8, 1985, of lung fibrosis, in Eugene, Oregon. Sturgeon lived for several years in the neighboring city of Springfield.\nSturgeon's Law.\nIn 1951, Sturgeon said something that is now known as Sturgeon's Law. He said, \"Ninety percent of SF [science fiction] is crud, but then, ninety percent of \"everything\" is crud.\" At first, this was called Sturgeon's Revelation. Sturgeon has said that \"Sturgeon's Law\" was originally \"Nothing is always absolutely so.\" However, the former statement is now widely referred to as Sturgeon's Law. He is also known for his strong support of critical thinking and challenging all normative assumptions: \"Ask the next question.\" He represented this credo by the symbol of a Q with an arrow through it, an example of which he wore around his neck and used as part of his signature in the last 15 years of his life.\nNovels.\nNovelizations.\nMovie producers hired Sturgeon under his own name to write novelisations of these movies based on their scripts:\nShort stories.\nSturgeon published numerous short story collections during his lifetime, many drawing on his most prolific writing years of the 1940s and 1950s. \nNote that some reprints of these titles (especially paperback editions) may cut one or two stories from the line-up. Statistics herein refer to the original editions only. \nCollections published during Sturgeon's lifetime.\nThe following table includes sixteen volumes (one of them collecting western stories) where up to three stories (representing no more than half the book) were previously published in a Sturgeon collection.\nThe following 6 collections consisted entirely of reprints of previously collected material:\nComplete short stories.\nNorth Atlantic Books has been releasing the chronologically assembled \"The Complete Short Stories of Theodore Sturgeon\", edited by Paul Williams, since 1994.

I expect the Battle of Britain is about to begin...\"\nThe Battle of Britain was the first major campaign to be fought only by air forces, and it was also the largest and longest aerial bombing campaign until then.\nPart I: Strategic targets.\nIn July 1940, coastal shipping convoys and shipping centres, such as Portsmouth, began to be the main targets. A month later, the \"Luftwaffe\" shifted its attacks to RAF airfields and infrastructure, which were other useful war targets. As the battle progressed the \"Luftwaffe\" also targeted aircraft factories and ground infrastructure.\nCoastal radar stations were bombed and so for a time, only one radar mast was standing. The British used a backup system of human observers to get information to the headquarters of Fighter Command. Most historians agree that part of the campaign went into Germany's favour.\nPart II: Civilian targets.\nEventually the Germans switched to attacking population centres, such as towns and cities, as well as factories. After the RAF bombed Berlin, and German air force bases in France, Hitler cancelled his orders not to bomb population centres and ordered attacks on British cities.p305 The attacks on civilians were terror bombing tactics designed to cause panic and damage morale.\nOn 7 September 1940, a massive series of raids with nearly 400 bombers and more than 600 fighters targeted docks on the Thames in London day and night.\nThe RAF 11 Group rose to meet them in greater numbers than the \"Luftwaffe\" expected; 12 Group's Big Wing took 20 min to gain formation and missed its intended target, but it came across another formation of bombers while it was still climbing. It returned, felt sorry about their limited success and blamed the delay on being requested too late.\nThe \"Luftwaffe\" began to abandon its morning raids, with attacks on London starting late in the afternoon for 57 nights of attacks in a row.\nFighter Command had been suffering low morale since it was short of men and machines, and the break from airfield attacks allowed it to recover and so week by week, the defenders were getting stronger, and the losses suffered by the \"Luftwaffe\" were growing.\nOn 15 September, two massive waves of German attacks were prevented by the RAF, with every aircraft of 11 Group being used that day. The total casualties on that important day were 60 German and 26 RAF aircraft shot down. The German defeat caused Hitler to order two days later a delay of the preparations for the invasion of Britain. In the face of increasing losses in men, aircraft and the lack of good replacements, the \"Luftwaffe\" later switched from daylight to night-time bombing.\nOn 27 September, a Junkers Ju 88 returning from a raid on London was shot down in Kent. The German airmen survived to fight a battle against British troops stationed locally. That was said to be the first time in nearly 300 years that armed invaders had fought with British soldiers on British soil.\nDowding system.\nThe keystone of the British defence was the detection, command, and control, which ran the battle. It was called the 'Dowding System', after its chief architect, Air Chief Marshal Sir Hugh Dowding, the leader of RAF Fighter Command.\nThe core of the system was the use of Radio Direction Finding (RDF, later called radar, for radio detection and ranging). Its use, as we as by information by the Royal Observer Corps, was crucial and allowed the RAF to intercept the incoming German aircraft.\nRadar operators were linked via telephone, whose wires were laid deep underground with concrete anti-bomb protection,p47 to an operational centre. The centre was Fighter Command Control at Bentley Priory. During the battle, several Coastal Command and Fleet Air Arm units came under Fighter Command control.\nFighters.\nThe Germans' Messerschmitt Bf 109E and 110C squared up against the British workhorse Hawker Hurricane Mk I and the less numerous Supermarine Spitfire Mk I. The Bf 109E had a better climb rate and was 10 to 30\u00a0mph faster than the Hurricane, depending on the altitude.p266 In September 1940, the more powerful Mk IIa series 1 Hurricane started entering service but only in small numbers. That version was capable of a maximum speed of 342\u00a0 mph, 25 to 30\u00a0 mph faster than the Mk I.\nThe performance of the Spitfire during the Dunkirk evacuation came as a surprise although the German pilots retained a strong belief that their 109 was the superior fighter. However, the Bf 109E had a much larger turning circle than either the Hurricane or the Spitfire. The two British fighters had eight Browning 303 machine guns, but most Bf 109Es had two machine guns and two wing cannons. The Bf 109E and the Spitfire were superior to each other in key areas. For instance, at some altitudes, the Bf 109 could outclimb the British fighter.\nAftermath.\nThe failure of Germany to achieve its objectives of destroying Britain's air defences or forcing Britain to negotiate an armistice or an outright surrender is considered to be its first major defeat and one of the crucial turning points in the war.p388\nIf Germany had gained air superiority, Adolf Hitler might have launched Operation Sea Lion, a planned amphibious and airborne invasion of Britain."}

It is not an explosive material, but can burn very fast and very hot.\nIt is made of an oxide of a less reactive metal mixed with a more reactive metal. One of the most common mixtures is iron(III) oxide-aluminium. The iron(III) oxide oxidizes the aluminium, being reduced to iron in the process. The aluminium is oxidized to aluminium oxide.\nMany other metal oxides and metals can be used for thermite. Some metals that can be used are boron, magnesium, calcium, titanium, zinc, or silicon. Some metal oxides that can be used are copper(II) oxide, chromium(III) oxide, iron(II,III) oxide, manganese(IV) oxide, silicon dioxide, boron trioxide, or lead(II,IV) oxide. A metal cannot be used with its metal oxide. The metal has to be more reactive than the metal in the oxide, or the thermite will not work.\nReaction and ignition.\nThe reaction for an aluminium-iron(III) oxide thermite is this:\nIt is difficult to ignite thermite. It needs to be very hot. Ribbons of magnesium metal are used. A mixture of potassium permanganate and glycerin can be used to ignite thermite. It can be ignited by a flint lighter or a child's sparkler. It can be mixed with sulfur to make thermate, which makes it easier to melt the iron.\nContrary to popular opinion, metals can burn. Common metals need to be powdered, though, or they will conduct the heat away too fast to start a fire.\nHistory.\nThe thermite (\"thermit\") reaction was discovered in 1893. German chemist Hans Goldschmidt patented it in 1895. People called it the \"Goldschmidt reaction\" or \"Goldschmidt process\". Goldschmidt was trying to make very pure metals without the use of carbon in smelting. He soon discovered the value of thermite in welding. It started to be used in the early 1900s to weld train tracks.\nUses.\nThermite is used for its original purpose, welding railroad rails together. It is also used to weld wires. Thermite is also used to make some metals. Chromium can be made by a thermite reaction between chromium(III) oxide and aluminium. The first uranium was made by a thermite. Thermite may also be used in fireworks to ignite other incendiaries.\nThermite was used in the military as an incendiary weapon. It is mainly used to destroy buildings and equipment as it melts the metal easily. Barium nitrate can be added to thermite to make an easier-burning mixture. Especially during World War II, militaries dropped thousands of bombs containing thermite on cities, starting fires everywhere.\nSafety.\nThermite is not safe to make at home. It releases ultraviolet light which can damage the eyes. It also makes a very hot flame that can melt iron. It is extremely difficult to extinguish. Streams of molten iron can flow out of a thermite mixture, igniting everything it touches. Some metals can boil and burst into flames when placed in thermite, such as zinc. If it is preheated then ignited, thermite can burn very fast, releasing a huge amount of heat and light. If it is dropped in water it can boil water very fast, making an explosion. Dropping it on ice can make the ice explode, however it is safe to drop it into a three-liter beaker filled with lightly moist sand."}

It is the county seat of Boulder County. Boulder is in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. The city's height is . It is northwest of Denver. In 2011, there were 98,889 people living the City of Boulder. The Boulder Metropolitan Statistical Area has 294,567 people living in it.\nBoulder is famous for its history and its Western traditions. In the late 1960s, lots of hippies moved to Boulder. The main campus of the University of Colorado, the University of Colorado at Boulder, is also here. CU Boulder is the biggest university in Colorado. The city is thought to be one of the best cities for health, well-being, quality of life, education, and art.\nHistory.\nOn November 7, 1861, the government decided to build a university in Boulder. The legislature decided that the university would be run by the state. The first building was built in 1875. The cornerstone for the Old Main Building was laid on September 20, 1875. The university was officially opened on September 5, 1877.\nIn 1907, the city of Boulder passed an anti-saloon ordinance. This law said that saloons and bars could not do business in the city, and that people could not drink alcohol. In 1916, the entire state of Colorado started prohibition. In US History, the \"Prohibition Era\" was a time when all alcohol was illegal. People could not make, drink, buy, sell, or serve alcohol. Prohibition ended in 1933, when the Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution was passed by Congress.\nDemographics.\nThe 2010 United States Census said there are 94,673 people living in the City of Boulder. These people make up 16,788 families and 39,596 households. The population density was 3,884.1 people per square mile (1,499.9 people/km\u00b2). Boulder's population density is higher than Denver's, and the third highest in the state. (Englewood and Northglenn have higher population densities.) According to the census, the people living in Boulder are 88.3% White, 1.2% black or African-American, 0.48% Native American, 4.02% Asian, 0.05% Pacific Islander, 3.5% of another race, and 2.4% of two or more races. 8.9% of the population are Hispanic or Latino of any race. In December 2009, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated that the population of Boulder was 98,889 people.\nGeography.\nThe City of Boulder is in Boulder Valley. This is a place where the Rocky Mountain meet the Great Plains. To the West of the city are some rock formations called the Flatirons. These are large flat pieces of sedimentary stone that are tilted up on the foothills. The Flatirons are famous as a symbol of Boulder.\nBoulder Creek flows through the City. Boulder Creek was named a long time before the city was built. It was named after the big granite boulders that have fallen into the creek over the years. Historians think that Boulder City was named after Boulder Creek. The water in Boulder Creek comes from melting mountain snow and small rivers West of the city. Boulder Creek is a tributary of the South Platte River.\nBoulder covers according to the U.S. Census Bureau. This includes of land and (3.94%) of water.\nThe 40th parallel (40 degrees north latitude) runs through Boulder. Baseline Road runs along the parallel today.\nFlagstaff Mountain overlooks Boulder. The city is a few miles east of the Continental Divide and about northwest of Denver. Denver International Airport is about southeast of Boulder. The city gets its water from Arapahoe Glacier and Boulder Creek.\nClimate.\nBoulder has a dry climate. (Much of Colorado is dry.) It has many sunny or mostly sunny days every year. According to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, the city's climate is \"semi-arid\" (K\u00f6ppen \"BSk\"). Winters are cool, but sometimes can get very cold. During the winter, the high temperature is usually in the mid- to upper- 40s\u00b0F (7\u20139 \u00b0C). The low temperature in winter can be below \u221210 \u00b0F (\u221223 \u00b0C) on a few nights. Usually it does not stay below 0 \u00b0F (\u221218 \u00b0C) for many days at a time. \nEven though it is cold in the winter, Boulder does not get as much snow as the mountains. This is because of something called orographic lift. This means that the mountains in the west dry out the air as it passes over the Front Range. By the time the air gets to Boulder, most of the water and snow has been removed. Sometimes there are heavy snow storms, but not too often. The average amount of snow in Boulder is per season, total. Usually only a few inches fall at a time. Because Boulder is so high up, the sun is very strong and hot, so the snow melts quickly. Sometimes Chinook Winds will make the temperature go up quickly and have the snow melt even faster.\nSummer in Boulder is hot and dry. Usually there are 27 days during the summer that reach or above. It is much cooler at night because of how high up the city is. The hottest temperature ever was on June 23, 1954 and July 11, 1954. On those days it was . The coldest temperature was in February 1989 and December 1990, when it was .\nPolitics and government.\nBoulder is a Home Rule Municipality. In Colorado, this means that Boulder's government was formed according to three different legal documents. These documents are: Article XX of the Constitution of the State of Colorado; Title 31, Article 1, Section 202 of the Colorado Revised Statutes; and Boulder's own Home Rule Charter. \nBoulder is very liberal and very Democratic. , registered voters in Boulder County were 41% Democrat, 20% Republican, 1% other parties, and 38% unaffiliated (not any specific party.) Boulder county includes the conservative suburbs of Boulder City. Boulder is sometimes called the \"People's Republic of Boulder\" or \"25 square miles surrounded by reality.\" This is a lot like nicknames given to other liberal cities that have more conservative areas surrounding them, like Columbia, Missouri, Madison, Wisconsin, and Austin, Texas.\nBoulder was the first city in Colorado to pass a law that made it illegal to discriminate against people because of their sexual orientation. This law was passed by the Boulder City Council in 1974. The law was repealed (cancelled) by the voters that same year. In 1975, Boulder became the second city to ever grant a same-sex marriage license. The license was given by Boulder County Clerk Clela Rorex. Soon after a law was passed that said that marriage licenses could not be given to people of the same gender. In 1987, the people of Boulder voted again to make it illegal to discriminate against people because of their sexual orientation. This was passed by popular vote. Boulder became the first city in the United States that had this kind of a law that was passed by a direct vote of the people.\nSister cities.\nBoulder has seven official sister cities:\nThere are several landmarks in Boulder in honor of the sister cities. The Sister City Plaza was dedicated in May 17, 2007. It is on the east lawn of Boulder's Municipal Building. The plaza was built in honor of Boulder's relationships with its sister cities."}

The Curitiba, Brazil in January 2006 was cancelled. Nelson Piquet, Jr. won the inaugural race of the series for A1 Team Brazil. A1 Team France were crowned the first-ever A1 Grand Prix world champions with 172 points. Switzerland were second with 121 points and A1 Team Great Britain third with 97 points.\nThe 2006\u201307 season started on 1 October 2006 at Circuit Park Zandvoort, and the last race at Brands Hatch on 29 April 2007. Team Germany won it with 128 points, 35 points lead ahead of Team New Zealand. \nThe 2008\u201309 season saw the new \"Powered by Ferrari\" A1GP car. \nThe opening of the 2009-10 season was canceled five days before practice was due to begin. Due to the series' financial problems, none of the scheduled races take place. The cars and series infrastructure were tied up in London. No comment was coming from A1GP. More races were cancelled. An announcement made on 5 November 2009 stating that the races in China and Malaysia would not be taking place.\nThe last race that was to be held in the season was the Dutch round. That race was change to a Superleague Formula race. This ended the hopes the season would start and also put the future of the series in doubt.\nTeams.\nEach A1 Grand Prix team represented a nation. Drivers must have the same nationality as the team they drove for. The team car should also represent the country. The team owner, principal and crew, however, did not need to have the same nationality as the team.\nTwenty-nine nations started one race in A1GP\nRace weekend.\nA1 Grands Prix of Nations took place over a three-day period, from Friday to Sunday. A two-hour qualifying session took place on Saturday afternoon, and two races took place on Sunday. The driver selected for qualifying or for one of the races was required to have taken part in at least one practice session.\nA1 Grand Prix qualifying determined the grid lineup for Sunday's races, the Sprint Race and the Main Race. The grid for the Sprint Race was set based on the cars' fastest time from either the first or the second session. The grid for the Feature Race was based on sessions three and four. \nThe Sprint Race was held in the early afternoon. The race began from a rolling start, and it was a maximum of 24 minutes plus one additional lap.&lt;ref name=\"New 08/09 Rules\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Each team had to make one mandatory pit stop. \nThe Feature Race was held mid-afternoon. The race began from a standing start, and was approximately 180 kilometres. The maximum time limit of 69 minutes plus one lap. Teams had to make two mandatory pit stops during the Feature Race.\nDuring the pit stop, all four tires on the car had to be changed. Fuel was not allowed to be added to the car.\nDrivers did not score points for themselves. The points earned went their national team. Teams could change drivers between rounds and still accumulate points to their score.\nPoints and cash prizes were awarded for the first ten places. In addition, one point was awarded to the team that set the fastest single lap time in either the Sprint or Main Race.\nChassis and engines.\nThe A1GP formula provided a single \"spec\" car for each team. Each car was mechanically identical. It was designed to limit performance, reduce running costs, and prevent any one or number of teams gaining an advantage through better equipment. This provided field in which driver skill and team effort should become the primary factor for success. \nThe cars were based on the Formula One Ferrari F2004 chassis. They used slick tyres from Michelin. The 4.5-litre Ferrari/Maserati V8 engine produced up to in \"PowerBoost\" mode."}

Naismith invented the sport of basketball in 1891. He is also said to have introduced the first football helmet. Naismith wrote the original basketball rulebook and started the University of Kansas basketball program. He lived to see basketball become an Olympic demonstration sport in 1904 and an official event at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin.\nHe taught at the University of Kansas (KU) and was a part-time basketball coach from 1898 to 1907. He was also the Athletic Director for the Kansas Jayhawks, the sports teams at KU.\nNaismith has been made a member of the Canadian Basketball Hall of Fame, the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame, the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame, the Ontario Sports Legends Hall of Fame, the Ottawa Sports Hall of Fame, the McGill University Sports Hall of Fame, the Kansas State Sports Hall of Fame and the FIBA Hall of Fame. The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame was named after him.\nEarly years.\nDr. Naismith was born in 1861 in Ramsay Township (now Almonte, Ontario). His parents were both from Scotland. They met and married in Lanark County, Canada. Naismith was not good at school, but enjoyed farm work. He usually spent his days outside playing catch, hide and seek, or duck on a rock. This is old game in which a person guards a large stone from other players, who try to knock it down by throwing smaller stones at it. Naismith soon found that a soft lobbing throw was often much better than a straight hard throw in this game. This thought was later very important when he invented basketball. When he was nine, his parents died from typhoid fever. Naismith lived with his grandmother and his uncle for many years. He went to grade school at Bennies Corners near Almonte, then Almonte High School, and graduated in 1883.\nMcGill University.\nIn the same year, Naismith entered McGill University in Montreal. He was described as quite thin, 5 foot 10 \u00bd inches tall and weighing 168 pounds. He was a talented and quick-moving athlete who played for McGill in Canadian football, soccer and gymnastics. He also played center on the football team, where he wore the first football helmet. Naismith won many Wicksteed medals for outstanding gymnastics performances. Naismith earned a BA in Physical Education (1888) and a Diploma at the Presbyterian College in Montreal (1890). From 1891 on, Naismith taught physical education and became the first McGill director of athletics. He left Montreal to become a physical education teacher at the YMCA International Training School in Springfield, Massachusetts. Naismith is also a member of the Sigma Phi Epsilon Fraternity.\nSpringfield College: Invention of \"Basket Ball\".\nAt Springfield YMCA, Naismith found teaching difficult. His class was restless and irritable because they had to stay inside in the winter. Dr. Luther Gulick, leader of the Springfield YMCA Physical Education, told Naismith to make up a game that could be played inside which would be a good \"athletic distraction\" in 14 days. Gulick said that it should not need too much room, help the athletes keep healthy, and was \"fair for all players and not too rough.\"\nNaismith was guided by three main thoughts. Firstly, he studied the most popular games of those times (rugby, lacrosse, soccer, football, hockey and baseball). He saw the danger of a small fast ball and decided that the big soft soccer ball was safest. Secondly, he saw that most physical contact happened while running with the ball, dribbling or hitting it. He decided that passing was the only legal option. Finally, Naismith further reduced body contact by making the goal unguardable, by putting it high above the player's heads. To score goals, he made players throw a soft lobbing shot that he had used in his old favorite game \"duck on a rock\". Naismith called this new game \"Basket Ball\" and put wrote down the 13 basic rules.\nThe first game of \"Basket Ball\" was played in December 1891. The teams had nine players, and used a soccer ball. The goals were a pair of peach baskets: \"When Mr. Stubbins brot [sic] up the peach baskets to the gym I secured them on the inside of the railing of the gallery. This was about 10 feet from the floor, one at each end of the gymnasium. I then put the 13 rules on the bulletin board just behind the instructor's platform, secured a soccer ball and awaited the arrival of the class... The class did not show much enthusiasm but followed my lead... I then explained what they had to do to make goals, tossed the ball up between the two center men &amp; tried to keep them somewhat near the rules. Most of the fouls were called for running with the ball, though tackling the man with the ball was not uncommon.\"\nThe first rules did not include what is now called dribbling. Since the ball could only be moved up the court with a pass, early players tossed the ball over their heads as they ran up court. Also, following each \"goal\" a jump ball was taken in the middle of the court. Both practices are no longer used in the rules of modern basketball.\nBy 1892, basketball had grown so popular on campus that Dennis Horkenbach (editor-in-chief of \"The Triangle\", the Springfield college newspaper) featured it in an article called \"A New Game\". There were calls to name the new game \"Naismith Ball\", but Naismith refused. By 1893, basketball was introduced in other countries by the YMCA movement. From Springfield, Naismith went to Denver where he studied for a medical degree and in 1898 he joined the University of Kansas faculty at Lawrence, Kansas.\nUniversity of Kansas.\nThe University of Kansas started a men's basketball program in 1898, following Naismith's arrival. This was only six years after Naismith had invented the game. Naismith was employed as chapel director and physical education instructor. In these early days, most basketball games were played against nearby YMCA teams. The YMCA's across the nation played a very important part in the birth of basketball. Other common opponents were Haskell Indian Nations University and William Jewell College. With Naismith as coach, the team played only three current Big 12 schools: Nebraska (six times), Missouri (twice), and Kansas State (once). Naismith was, ironically, the only coach in the program's history to have a losing record (55\u201360). However, Naismith coached Forrest \"Phog\" Allen, who took over as coach at Kansas. Allen was also added to the Basketball Hall of Fame. When Allen became a coach himself and told him that he was going to coach basketball at Baker University in 1904, Naismith said to him: \"You can't coach basketball; you just play it.\" Allen began a coaching career that would lead him to be known as \"the Father of Basketball Coaching.\" During his time at Kansas, Allen coached Dean Smith (1952 National Championship team) and Adolph Rupp (1922 Helms Foundation National Championship team). When Dean Smith retired as head Basketball coach at North Carolina he had the most wins in college basketball history, second was Adolph Rupp (Kentucky) and third was Allen. The three coaches have joined Naismith as members of the Basketball Hall of Fame.\nBy the turn of the century, there were enough college teams in the east of the U.S. that the first games between different colleges could be played. Although his sport continuously grew, Naismith long regarded his game as a curiosity and preferred gymnastics and wrestling as better forms of physical education. However, basketball became a demonstration sport at the 1904 Games in St. Louis, USA. As the Basketball Hall of Fame reports, Naismith was not interested in self-promotion nor in the glory of competitive sports. Instead, he was more interested in his physical education career, receiving an honorary PE Masters degree in 1910, patrolled the Mexican border for four months in 1916 during World War I, travelled to France, published two books (\"A Modern College\" in 1911 and \"Essence of a Healthy Life\" in 1918) and became an American citizen in 1925.\nIn 1935, the National Association of Basketball Coaches (created by Naismith's pupil Phog Allen) collected money so that the 74-year old Naismith could witness the introduction of basketball into the official Olympic sports program of the 1936 Summer Olympic Games. There, Naismith handed out the medals to three North American teams; United States, for the Gold Medal, Canada, for the Silver Medal, and Mexico, for their Bronze medal win. During the Olympics, he was named the Honorary President of the International Basketball Federation. When Naismith returned he commented that seeing the game played by many nations was the greatest compensation he could have received for his invention. In 1937, Naismith played a role in the formation of the National Association of Intercollegiate Basketball, which later became the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA).\nIn his later years, Naismith became Professor Emeritus in Kansas and retired in 1937 at the age of 76. Including his years as coach, Naismith served as athletic director and faculty at the school for a total of almost 40 years. Naismith died in 1939 after he suffered a fatal brain hemorrhage and was buried in Lawrence, Kansas. Posthumously, his masterwork \"Basketball\u00a0\u2014 its Origins and Development\" was published in 1941. In Lawrence, Kansas, James Naismith has a road named in his honor, Naismith Drive, which runs in front of Allen Fieldhouse (the official address of Allen Fieldhouse is 1700 Naismith Drive), Kansas University's basketball arena. It is a separated, four-lane road that runs north and south from University Drive south to its end at 24th street, just south of the KU campus. The university also named the court in Allen Fieldhouse, \"James Naismith Court\" in his honor. Naismith Hall, a college residential dormitory, is located on the northeastern edge of 19th Street and Naismith Drive.\nCoaching record.\nIn 1898, Naismith became the first college basketball coach of the University of Kansas basketball team. His record of 55 wins and 60 losses, means he became the only Kansas coach to have a losing record. Nevertheless, Naismith has one of the greatest coaching legacies in basketball history, as he coached Basketball Hall of Fame coach Phog Allen, who himself coached Hall of Fame coaches Dean Smith, Adolph Rupp, and Ralph Miller at the University of Kansas.\nLegacy.\nThe Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame in Springfield, Massachusetts, is named in Naismith's honor. He was the first member in 1959. The National Collegiate Athletic Association rewards its best players and coaches annually with the Naismith Awards, among them the Naismith College Player of the Year, the Naismith College Coach of the Year and the Naismith Prep Player of the Year. Women's basketball became an Olympic event in Montreal during the 1976 Summer Olympics. Naismith was also inducted into the Canadian Basketball Hall of Fame, the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame, the Canadian Sports Hall of Fame, the Ontario Sports Legends Hall of Fame, the Ottawa Sports Hall of Fame, the McGill University Sports Hall of Fame, the Kansas State Sports Hall of Fame and the FIBA Hall of Fame.\nBasketball is today played by more than 300 million people worldwide, making it one of the most popular team sports. In North America, basketball has produced some of the most-admired athletes of the 20th century. Polls conducted by ESPN and the Associated Press named basketball player Michael Jordan respectively first and second greatest North American athlete of the 20th century, and both polls featured fellow basketballers Wilt Chamberlain (of KU, like Naismith) and Bill Russell in the Top 20.\nPersonal life.\nOn June 20, 1894, Naismith married Maude E. Sherman from Springfield. The couple had five children: Margaret Mason (1895), Helen Carolyn (1897), John Edwin (1900), Maude Ann (1904) and James Sherman (1913). He was a member of the Pi Gamma Mu and Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternities, and regarding his spiritual beliefs, Naismith is remembered as a Freemason. Maude Naismith died in 1937, and on June 11, 1939, he married his second wife Florence Kincaid. Naismith suffered a major brain hemorrhage on November 19 the same year and died nine days later in his home in Lawrence, Kansas. Naismith was 78 years old. Naismith is buried in Memorial Park Cemetery in Lawrence, KS.\nDuring his lifetime, Naismith's education and academic positions held were as follows:"}

Other names for the war are the French Indochina War, Anti-French War, Franco-Vietnamese War, Franco-Vietminh War, Indochina War, Dirty War in France, and Anti-French Resistance War in contemporary Vietnam. The war was fought between the French Union's French Far East Expeditionary Corps, led by France and supported by Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i's Vietnamese National Army on one side, and the Vi\u1ec7t Minh, led by H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh and V\u00f5 Nguy\u00ean Gi\u00e1p on the other. Most of the fighting took place in Tonkin in Northern Vietnam, but the conflict spread over the entire country and also extended into the neighboring French Indochina protectorates of Laos and Cambodia.\nThe French reoccupied Indochina after the Second World War after the territory had been part of the Empire of Japan. The Vi\u1ec7t Minh launched a rebellion against the French authority. The first few years of the war involved a low-level rural insurgency against French authority. However, after the Chinese communistshad reached the Northern border of Vietnam in 1949, the conflict turned into a conventional war between two armies, which had modern weapons supplied by the United States and the Soviet Union.\nFrench Union forces included colonial troops from the whole former empire (Moroccan, Algerian, Tunisian, Laotian, Cambodian, Vietnamese and Vietnamese ethnic minorities), French professional troops and units of the French Foreign Legion. The use of metropolitan recruits was forbidden by the governments to prevent the war from becoming even more unpopular at home. It was called the \"dirty war\" (\"la sale guerre\") by supporters of the Left in France and intellectuals (including Sartre) during the Henri Martin Affair in 1950.\nThe French had the strategy of pushing Vi\u1ec7t Minh into attacking a well defended base in a remote part of the country at the end of the logistical trail. This strategy was validated at the Battle of Na San. The big problem of the war was the lack of construction materials (especially concrete). Because of difficult terrain without roads, tanks could not be used, and providing air cover was difficult. That made it almost impossible to defend the area effictively.\nAfter the war, the Geneva Conference on July 21, 1954 made a provisional division of Vietnam at the 17th parallel. The Vi\u1ec7t Minh received control over the north in a territory called Democratic Republic of Vietnam, under H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh. The area south of the 17th parallel was turned into State of Vietnam, under Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i, to prevent H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh from gaining control of the entire country. A year later, B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i would be deposed by his prime minister, Ng\u00f4 \u0110\u00ecnh Di\u1ec7m, creating the Republic of Vietnam. Diem's refusal to enter into negotiations with North Vietnam on holding nationwide elections in 1956, as had been suggested by the Geneva Conference, would lead to the war breaking out again in South Vietnam in 1959, the Second Indochina War."}

He is the son of three-time Formula One world champion Nelson Piquet, one of Brazil's most successful F1 drivers. Piquet Junior currently drives part-time in the Camping World Truck Series for Red Horse Racing.\nPiquet Jr. raced in the GP2 Series in 2005 and 2006. He drove for the Renault Formula One team for the , before being dropped midway through the season. After losing his ride, it was revealed that he had crashed on purpose at the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix. The crash helped his team-mate, Fernando Alonso, win the race.\nPersonal Details.\nPiquet's parents separated soon after he was born. He lived in Monaco with his Dutch mother, Sylvia Tamsma, until he was eight years old. He then moved to Brazil with his father. \"They kind of swapped me. My mother wanted me to get to know my father, she wanted me to know Brazil and the language, and she realised life in Brazil would be better for a child.\" Piquet has two sisters, Kelly and Julia, and four brothers, Geraldo, Laszlo, Pedro and Marco. He lived in Bras\u00edlia and attended the American School of Bras\u00edlia. When he was 16 years old, he decided to pursue his racing career full-time.\nBefore F1.\nPiquet's racing career started in 1993 in Brazilian karting. In 2001 when he moved to Formula Three Sudamericana. He raced in part of the 2001 season, and won the 2002 championship. In 2002 he also entered one race of the Brazilian Formula Renault series.\nIn 2003, Piquet moved to the UK and joined the British Formula Three Championship. He went on to finish the championship in third place with six wins, five podiums and eight pole positions. A test with the Williams Formula One team followed.\nIn 2004, Piquet won the British Formula Three Championship. He became the youngest driver to win the championship, at 19 years and 2 months.\nIn 2005, Piquet took part in the A1 Grand Prix for A1 Team Brazil. He won both the Sprint and Main races at the 2005-06 A1 Grand Prix of Nations, Great Britain, the first ever A1 race. He also set the fastest lap. He drove in the GP2 Series, winning his first race at Spa Francorchamps in Belgium, and tested for the BAR-Honda Formula 1 team.\nIn 2006, Piquet was second in the GP2 championship to Lewis Hamilton.\nThroughout hes eary careet, Piquet was able to race for his own team. His father purchased the teams he raced for.\nFormula One.\nDuring the 2007 season he was the official test and reserve driver for the Renault Formula One team. For 2008 season Piquet was promoted to the Renault race team. He drove alongside returning double World Champion Fernando Alonso.\nThe first race of the 2008 season in Australia saw Piquet start 21st and damage his car in a collision on the opening lap. He finally retired on lap 31. This was exactly the same result as his father achieved in his first race at the German Grand Prix. Piquet qualified in 10th for the Spanish Grand Prix his first top 10 qualifying position of his career. Piquet scored his first points in F1 with a 7th-place finish at the French Grand Prix. He passed his team mate Alonso in the last few laps. At the German Grand Prix, finished in second place and his first podium finish.\nRenault singed Piquet to a one-year contract for the season. His first race, in 2009 at Australia ended on lap 24 with brake failure. China was another disappointment. He spun several times, requiring two new nose cones for his car. He finished 16th and last, two laps down, in what team manager Flavio Briatore described as a \"very, very bad race\". His best race of the year was a tenth-place finish at Bahrain.\nOn 3 August 2009 Piquet confirmed that he had been dropped by Renault. He hit out hard at his former manager and team boss Briatore. He called him his 'executioner' and questioned Briatore's Formula One knowledge. Piquet also said the Renault boss favored teammate Fernando Alonso. Renault's test and reserve driver Romain Grosjean replaced Piquet for the rest of the season.\n2009 FIA investigation.\nAfter Piquet left the Renault F1 team, the media started making claims about Piquet. They said that had crashed his car on purpose at the Singapore Grand Prix. They said he did this to benefit team-mate Fernando Alonso. Alonso had made an early pit stop, and was far behind the leaders. Alonso went on to win the race. At the time, Piquet had said the crash as a simple mistake.\nPiquet told the FIA that it had been on purpose. He said had been asked by Renault team principal Flavio Briatore and engineer Pat Symonds to stage the crash. In return for his statement, Piquet was given immunity by the FIA. On 4 September 2009 Renault F1 was charged with conspiracy and race fixing. On 16 September, Renault announced they would not contest the charges, and that Briatore and team engineer Symonds had left the team.\nPiquet has received criticism from many in the F1 community. BBC F1 commentator Martin Brundle suggested that Piquet Jr. was now unemployable in Formula One, saying that no team or sponsor would want to be associated with the Piquet family. Piquet decided to move to NASCAR for 2010.\nNASCAR.\nPiquet made his stock car debut in the ARCA RE/MAX Series at Daytona International Speedway. He has made several races in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series. He drove one race for Red Horse Racing. In his first truck race, Piquet was managed to score a sixth-place effort, the first Brazilian driver to finish in the top ten in the series history.

On 9 August 48 BC at Pharsalus in central Greece, Gaius Julius Caesar and his allies formed up opposite the army of the republic under the command of Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (\"Pompey the Great\"). Pompey had the backing of a majority of senators, and his army significantly outnumbered the experienced Caesarean legions.\nThe build-up.\nAlthough Pompey had a larger army, he knew that Caesar's troops were more experienced, and might win in a pitched battle. Instead, Pompey waited Caesar's troops out, attempting to starve them by cutting off Caesar's supply lines. Caesar made a near disastrous attack on Pompey's camp, and was forced to pull away to regroup.\nPompey did not immediately follow up on his success. An indecisive winter (49\u201348 BC) of blockade and siege followed. Pompey eventually pushed Caesar into Thessaly and, urged on by his senatorial allies, he confronted Caesar near Pharsalus. Pompey's allies disagreed with Pompey over whether to fight at Pharsalus. Pompey, who wanted to starve Caesar's soldiers, had his hand forced by his allies.\nConflict.\nThere was significant distance between the two armies, according to Caesar. Pompey ordered his men not to charge, but to wait until Caesar's legions came into close quarters. The idea was to tire Caesar's men before the battle started.\nSeeing that Pompey's army was not advancing, Caesar's men, without orders, stopped to rest and regroup before continuing the charge. Caesar, in his history of the war, would praise his own men's discipline and experience, and questioned Pompey's decision not to charge.\nWhen the lines joined, Labienus (Pompey's cavalry leader) ordered the cavalry to attack. At first they did well, then Caesar ordered his cavalry to withdraw. Light troops fiercely attacked Pompey's cavalry. The first line of the Pompeiian horse were panicked by the cohort's javelins and caused the entire cavalry to fall into disorder. When the cavalry retreated, Caesar's men slaughtered the light troops who supported them. They attacked Pompey's left flank and, rejoined by their cavalry, were able to get behind and attack Pompey's army from the rear. Caesar raised the pressure further by ordering his as yet uninvolved third line to relieve the front ranks. The remaining Pompeiian soldiers fled and soon the main battle was done.\nPompey retreated to his camp and ordered the garrison to defend it. Caesar urged his men to capture the enemy camp. They furiously attacked the walls. The Thracians and the other auxiliaries who were left in the camp defended bravely, but they were not able to fend off the enemy assault. Pompey fled with a group, claiming that he had been betrayed. Caesar had won his greatest victory, having lost only about 200 soldiers and 30 centurions.\nAftermath.\nPompey fled from Pharsalus to Egypt, where he was assassinated on the order of Pharaoh Ptolemy XIII. Ptolemy XIII sent Pompey's head to Caesar in an effort to win his favor, but Caesar was not pleased with the gift. Pompey was the widower of Caesar's only daughter. Nor did Ptolemy take into account that Caesar was granting amnesty to many of the senators and their men, men who once considered him an enemy.\nThe Battle of Pharsalus ended the wars of the First Triumvirate. The Roman Civil War, however, was not ended. Pompey's two sons and the Pompeian faction led now by Labienus, survived and fought their cause in the name of Pompey the Great. Caesar spent the next few years 'mopping up' remnants of the senatorial faction. After finally completing this task, he was assassinated in a conspiracy arranged by Brutus and Cassius."}

The Second Triumvirate declared this civil war to avenge Julius Caesar's murder.\nThe battle consisted of two engagements in the plain west of the ancient city of Philippi. The first occurred on the first week of October; Brutus faced Octavian, while Antony's forces were up against those of Cassius.\nAt first, Brutus pushed back Octavian and entered his army's camp. But to the south, Cassius was defeated by Antony, and committed suicide after hearing a false report that Brutus had also failed. Brutus rallied Cassius' remaining troops and both sides ordered their army to retreat to their camps with their spoils. The battle was essentially a draw, but for Cassius' suicide. This deprived the Liberatores of their best commander.\nA second encounter, on 23 October, finished off Brutus's forces, and he committed suicide in turn, leaving the triumvirate in control of the Roman Republic. The Battle of Philippi marked the highest point of Antony's career: at that time he was the most famous Roman general and the senior partner of the Second Triumvirate. Antony's life was defined in this moment."}

Inside, there are other containers, usually with other liquids. When the temperature changes, so does the density of the \"container\" liquid. As a consequence, the smaller containers may fall to the floor, or rise to the surface.\nUsually, such thermometers are calibrated, to either 2\u00b0 or 1\u00b0. The temperature is then that of the bulb with the lowest temperature, floating above.\nNow, Galileo thermometers are used mainly for decoration rather than for measuring temperature, although you can still read the temperature off them."}

They formed in New York in May 1975. They were one of the first punk rock bands. One of their most popular songs was called Chinese Rocks. Dee Dee Ramone and Richard Hell wrote this song about heroin in 1976.\nEarly History and the UK.\nJohnny Thunders (vocals/guitar) and Jerry Nolan (drums) had quit the New York Dolls. That same week Richard Hell (vocals/bass) was kicked out of Television. The three musicians joined to make the new band. After a few shows, Walter Lure (vocals/guitar) from a group called The Demons joined the band also. In 1976, Hell left group. He was replaced by Billy Rath. Hell went on to form his own band, The Voidoids.\nThe Heartbreakers came to Europe to tour just as the UK punk scene was growing. The Heartbreakers got many fans by playing in and around London. The Sex Pistols invited them to play first on the Anarchy Tour. Many things went wrong on this tour.\nRecording.\nThey soon signed a contract with Track Records. Their debut\u2014and only\u2014studio album, \" L.A.M.F.\", had all the Heartbreakers' popular live songs. Making and selling this album caused problems for the band. Some band members were angry about the poor quality of the sound. Several members of the band left at this point. The Heartbreakers reformed in 1979 for a few goodbye shows at Max's Kansas City with drummer Ty Stix replacing Nolan. These shows were recorded and became the album \"Live at Max's Kansas City '79\". The Heartbreakers' song, \"London Boys\", insulted the Sex Pistols. This was to answer the Sex Pistols' song \"New York\", that insulted the New York Dolls.\nAfter breaking up and reunions.\nThe band got back together sometimes to play at New York clubs until Johnny Thunders died in 1991. Jerry Nolan died in 1992. These live shows often had songs from the New York Dolls or from Thunders' solo career. Hell rarely plays music live, concentrating instead on writing and spoken-word performances. Lure became a stockbroker on Wall St. but still performs once in a while when he is not working at his regular job. In 2007 Lure went on a short European tour."}

It was named after an international exhibition held in Paris in 1925, but there are some examples dating back to before the First World War. Art Deco followed another design style, Art Nouveau, which was influenced by organic plant-like forms.\nArt Deco was one of the first styles of modern architecture. It was influenced by different styles and movements of the early 20th century, Neoclassical, Constructivism, Cubism, Modernism, and Futurism. Later Art Deco of the mid to late 1930s is also sometimes called Streamline Moderne.\nOne idea behind art deco architecture was to apparently streamline buildings the same way you would streamline a car for aerodynamics. The style was much more common in commercial buildings than in houses; many banks, schools, and libraries were built in this style. Most of the public buildings built by the Works Progress Administration during the Great Depression are in the Art Deco style.\nExamples.\nFamous Art Deco buildings include the Chrysler Building in New York City and the Chicago Board of Trade Building in Chicago. Another is Bullock's Wilshire in Los Angeles. Many art deco buildings have elaborate terra cotta or murals inside them. The towers of the Golden Gate Bridge have an art deco design."}

It is an illness of the brain. Intellectual disability becomes visible in early childhood.\nWhat is an intellectual disability?\nTo have an intellectual disability, a person must: \nTypes of intellectual disabilities.\nThere are two major types of intellectual disability.\nThe first is \"syndromic intellectual disability\". This means that the person has a syndrome that causes intellectual disability, as well as medical issues and other problems. Down syndrome and fetal alcohol syndrome are two examples of syndromic intellectual disabilities.\nThe second is \"non-syndromic intellectual disability\". This means that the intellectual disability is not a part of a syndrome.\nLevels of intellectual disability.\nThere are three levels of intellectual disability, based on how severe a person's disability is:\nMild intellectual disability may not be noticed until a child starts school. Moderate and severe intellectual disability can be seen before a child starts school.\nWhat does intellectual disability look like?\nPeople with syndromic intellectual disabilities may have a \"typical look.\" For example, the picture on the right shows facial features that many people with fetal alcohol syndrome have. People with non-syndromic intellectual disability do not look any different than a person without a disability. The symptoms of intellectual disability are all behavioral.\nPeople with intellectual disability may have some or all of these:\nMost children with intellectual disabilities can learn. However, they usually will not learn things as fast as other children. They may need to be taught things in a certain way in order to learn them and remember them.\nIntellectual disability is different from dementia. In dementia, people forget things, and they lose skills they once had. People with an intellectual disability never learn those skills.\nCauses.\nOften, no-one knows what caused a child's intellectual disability. This happens in between one-third and one-half of all cases of intellectual disability.\nThe top three most common causes of intellectual disability are Down syndrome, DiGeorge syndrome, and Fetal alcohol syndrome.\nGenetic disorders.\nGenetic disorders are caused by problems with a child's genes. Children are born with these disorders.\nProblems during pregnancy.\nSubstances called teratogens can prevent a fetus from developing normally. If a teratogen enters a woman's body while she is pregnant, it can cause developmental problems, like intellectual disabilities.\nExamples of teratogens that can cause intellectual disabilities include:\nProblems during birth.\nFor example, if a child does not get enough oxygen during birth, it can hurt the brain and lead to intellectual disability later.\nDiseases and trauma.\nSome childhood illnesses, like measles and whooping cough, can cause intellectual disability if not treated properly. So can infections that affect the brain, like meningitis and viral encephalitis.\nBrain injuries can cause intellectual disability at any age.\nMalnutrition.\nLack of proper nutrition can lead to intellectual disability over time. \nNot having enough iodine in the body.\nIodine deficiency (not having enough iodine in the body) can lead to several medical issues, including intellectual disability. The most common way to prevent this is by adding iodine to salt. This is a much more common problem in developing countries.\nDiagnosis.\nIn the DSM, there are three requirements a person has to meet in order to be diagnosed with an intellectual disability.\nLow intelligence quotient (IQ).\nFirst, the person must have a low intelligence quotient (IQ). IQ is measured with an IQ test.\nIf the person has an IQ of below 70, they \"may\" have an intellectual disability. However, they must still meet the other two requirements to be diagnosed with an intellectual disability.\nTrouble with daily activities.\nSecond, to qualify for an intellectual disability, a person must have trouble in more than one area of normal daily activities. These activities are often called \"adaptive behaviors\" or \"activities of daily living (ADLs).\" Some examples of adaptive behavior are:\nTo see if a child is having trouble with these, a doctor will talk to people who know the child, and will watch the child's behavior.\nBeginning in childhood.\nThe final requirement is that the symptoms of intellectual disability have to begin in childhood or adolescence. If the issues do not start at a young age, they are probably caused by a different illness of the brain.\nManagement.\nThere is currently no cure for intellectual disability. Those affected can learn to cope and do many things, if they get enough support and are taught well. There are many places around the world for someone with intellectual disability to get help. These places can take care of people with intellectual disabilities, as well as help them find jobs, find a house of their own, or help them take care of their children.\nThere are some different ways for people with intellectual disability and those around them to learn how to help the person with the disability. One kind is psychosocial treatment. This is meant for very young children. Psychosocial treatment helps them learn basic skills and increase learning over their lifetime. Another kind is behavioral treatment. This is meant to help young people, but can be used for adults as well. Behavior treatment helps teach language skills as well as social skills like sharing or following instructions. A third kind of help is cognitive-behavioral treatment. This is a combination of the previous two treatments. Cognitive-behavioral therapy helps children with intellectual disability both learn skills and learn how to plan ahead. Another type of help a person with intellectual disability can get is family-oriented help. Family-oriented help focuses on teaching family members how to help the person in their family with intellectual disability.\nMany people with an intellectual disability have other health problems, for which they will be given specific drugs. As an example, autistic children with developmental delay may use anti-psychotics or mood stabilizers to help with behavior. Giving drugs to intellectually disabled people needs to be monitored; side-effects often occur, and are wrongly diagnosed as problems with behavior or as psychiatric problems.\nHistory.\nPeople have had intellectual disability throughout history. People with intellectual disability have had a lot of trouble in the past. The oldest idea of where intellectual disability came from was in ancient Greece. Hippocrates thought that intellectual disability was caused by an issue with the four humors. For several hundred years in Europe, churches took care of people with intellectual disabilities. In the 17th century, Thomas Willis suggested that intellectual disability was a disease caused by issues with the structure of the brain. In the 18th and 19th centuries, people with intellectual disabilities were put in asylums. The asylums would give them basics like food and shelter, but were not always good to the people in them. In the early 20th century, people with intellectual disability were made to not be able to have children and could not marry. It was thought that this would reduce the amount of intellectual disabilities in the future. This is not done anymore because it does not follow the idea of human rights.\nIn the 1950s, a group called the Civitans started to help people with intellectual disability. In the '70s, many people wanted to remove the stigma around people with intellectual disability. Now, people with intellectual disability are treated as people with something to be fixed instead of less than \u201cnormal\u201d people. There are also fewer people with intellectual disability being sent to asylums.\nWords that were used to describe people with an intellectual disability have changed a lot. The most common words used today are \u201cspecial\u201d, \u201cchallenged\u201d, \"learning disabled\" and \u201cdevelopmentally delayed\u201d. Some previous words to describe people with intellectual disability are \u201ccretin\u201d, \u201cidiot\u201d, \u201cimbecile\u201d, \u201cmoron\u201d, and \u201cretarded\u201d, all of which are now regarded as insulting.\nSociety.\nPeople with intellectual disability are often treated badly by people without disabilities. They are often not allowed to make choices about their own lives and are not considered a full part of society. Their abusers are often people who are supposed to care for them. 39-83% of women with intellectual disability will be sexually abused before they are 18 years old.\nThe dignity and human rights of people with intellectual disability are protected by the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities as well as other disabilities and equally like other persons without disabilities."}

He studied philosophy at Rhodes and became fluent in Greek. He was married to Tertulla, who was a half-sister of his co-conspirator, Brutus. They had one son.\nQuaestorship and Parthia.\nCassius's first office was as quaestor under Marcus Licinius Crassus in 53 BC, and he proved a good military leader. He travelled with Crassus to the province of Syria, and attempted to dissuade him from attacking Parthia, suggesting that they secure a base at the Euphrates. \nCrassus ignored Cassius and led the army into the Battle of Carrhae, during which he also ignored Cassius' plans for strengthening the Roman line. The result was the most famous Roman rout since the Second Punic War.\nCassius managed to save the remnants of the army with the help of Crassus' legate Gaius Octavius. Crassus was killed, but Cassius managed to escape with 500 cavalry and meet up with the surviving legionaries.\nFor two years afterwards, Cassius governed the province of Syria as Proquaestor, defending the border against Parthian incursions until the new proconsul arrived. The last incursion resulted in the death of the Parthian commander Osaces, and split the Parthian troops. Cicero, then governor of Cilicia, sent Cassius a note of congratulations for the victory.\nCivil war.\nCassius returned to Rome two years later. The outbreak of the civil war between Julius Caesar and Pompey the Great saved Cassius from being brought to trial by his enemies for extortion in Syria. Cassius was elected Tribune of the Plebs in 49 BC, and threw in his lot with Pompey, fleeing Italy as Caesar crossed the Rubicon. He met Pompey in Greece, and was made commander of his fleet.\nIn 48 BC, Cassius sailed his ships to Sicilia where he attacked and burned a large part of Caesar's navy. He then proceeded to harass ships off the Italian coast. News of Pompey's defeat at the Battle of Pharsalus caused Cassius to head for the Hellespont. Cassius was overtaken by Caesar en route, and was forced to surrender unconditionally.\nCaesar made Cassius a legate, employing him in the North Africa, but Cassius refused to join in the fight against Cato and Scipio in Africa, choosing instead to retire to Rome.\nConspiracy.\nCassius spent the next two years without office, and apparently tightened his friendship with Cicero. In 44 BC he became \"praetor peregrinus\" with the promise of the Syrian province for the ensuing year. The appointment of his junior, Brutus, as \"praetor urbanus\" deeply offended him.\nAlthough Cassius was \"the moving spirit\" in the plot against Caesar, winning over the chief assassins, Brutus became their leader. On the Ides of March, 44 BC, Cassius urged on his fellow liberators and struck Caesar in the face. He and his fellow conspirators referred to themselves as the \"Liberators\" \"(Liberatores)\".\nAlthough they succeeded in assassinating Caesar, the celebration was short-lived. Mark Antony seized power and turned the public against them. In letters written during 44 BC, Cicero frequently complains that Rome was still subjected to tyranny, because the \"Liberators\" had failed to kill Antony. According to some accounts, Cassius had wanted to kill Antony at the same time as Caesar, but was dissuaded by Brutus.\nPost-assassination.\nCassius's reputation in the East made it easy to amass an army from other governors in the area. By this point the Senate had split with Antony and cast its lot with Cassius, making him as governor of Syria. Cassius was now secure enough to march on Egypt, but on the formation of the triumvirate, Brutus requested his assistance. Cassius quickly joined Brutus in Smyrna with most of his army, leaving his nephew behind to govern Syria.\nThe conspirators decided to attack the triumviri\u2019s allies in Asia. Cassius set upon and sacked Rhodes, while Brutus did the same to Lycia. They regrouped the following year in Sardis, where their armies proclaimed them 'emperor'. They crossed the Hellespont, marched through Thrace, and encamped near Philippi in Macedon. \nOctavian (later known as Augustus) and Mark Antony soon arrived. Cassius planned to starve them out, by using his superior position in the country. However, they were forced into a pair of battles by Antony, in the Battle of Philippi. Brutus was successful against Octavian, and took his camp. Cassius, however, was defeated and overrun by Antony. Cassius, unaware of Brutus' victory, committed suicide. He was mourned by Brutus as \"the Last of the Romans\". Brutus, like Octavian, was not an experienced military commander and, ten days later, Antony completed the victory. Brutus also committed suicide.\nEpicureanism.\n\"Among that select band of philosophers who have managed to change the world,\" writes David Sedley, \"it would be hard to find a pair with a higher public profile than Brutus and Cassius \u2014 brothers-in-law, fellow-assassins, and Shakespearian heroes,\" adding that \"it may not even be widely known that they \"were\" philosophers\".\nCassius converted to the school of thought founded by Epicurus. Arnaldo Momigliano called Cassius' conversion a \"conspicuous date in the history of Roman Epicureanism,\" a choice made not to enjoy the pleasures of the Garden, but to provide a philosophical justification for assassinating a tyrant.\nThe inconsistencies between traditional Epicureanism and an active approach to securing freedom could not be resolved, and during the Empire, the philosophy of political opposition tended to be Stoic. This circumstance, Momigliano argues, helps explain why historians of the Imperial era found Cassius more difficult to understand than Brutus, and less admirable.\nIn literature.\nIn Dante's \"Inferno\", Cassius is one of three people deemed sinful enough to be chewed in one of the three mouths of Satan, in the very center of Hell, for all eternity, as a punishment for killing Julius Caesar. The other two are Brutus, his fellow conspirator, and Judas Iscariot, the Biblical betrayer of Jesus Christ. (Canto XXXIV) In Shakespeare's play \"Julius Caesar\" he is depicted as a ruthless manipulator. Caesar says of him, \"Yon Cassius has a lean and hungry look; He thinks too much: such men are dangerous\". (I. ii. 190-195)"}

{"id": "266591", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=266591", "title": "Marcus Junius Brutus", "text": "Marcus Junius Brutus (early June 85 BC \u2013 late October 42 BC), usually referred to as Brutus, was a politician of the late Roman Republic. He is best known for his leading role in the assassination of Julius Caesar.\nEarly life.\nBrutus' father was killed by Pompey the Great after he had taken part in the rebellion of Lepidus. His mother was the half-sister of Cato the Younger, and later became Julius Caesar's mistress. Some sources refer to the possibility of Caesar being his real father. His uncle adopted him in about 59 BC. \nBrutus held his uncle in high regard. His political career began when he became an assistant to Cato, during his governorship of Cyprus. During this time, Brutus enriched himself by lending money at high rates of interest. He returned to Rome a rich man, where he married Claudia Pulchra. From his first appearance in the Senate, Brutus aligned with the Optimates. This was the conservative faction against the First Triumvirate of Marcus Licinius Crassus, Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus and Gaius Julius Caesar.\nSenate career.\nWhen civil war broke out in 49 BC between Pompey and Caesar, Brutus followed his old enemy and present leader of the Optimates, Pompey. When the Battle of Pharsalus began, Caesar ordered his officers to take him prisoner if he gave himself up voluntarily, and if he persisted in fighting against capture, to let him alone and do him no violence. \nAfter the disaster of the Battle of Pharsalus, Brutus wrote to Caesar with apologies and Caesar immediately forgave him. Caesar then accepted him into his inner circle and made him governor of Gaul when he left for Africa in pursuit of Cato and Scipio. In 45 BC, Caesar nominated Brutus to serve as urban praetor for the following year.\nAlso, in June 45 BC, Brutus divorced his wife and married his first cousin, Porcia Catonis, Cato's daughter. According to Cicero the marriage caused a semi-scandal as Brutus failed to state a valid reason for his divorce from Claudia, except that he wished to marry Porcia. The marriage also caused a rift between Brutus and his mother, who resented the affection Brutus had for Porcia.\nConspiracy to kill Caesar.\nAround this time, many senators began to fear Caesar's growing power after his appointment as Dictator for life. Brutus was persuaded into joining the conspiracy against Caesar. Eventually, Brutus decided to take action against Caesar. His wife was the only woman who knew about the plot.\nThe conspirators planned to kill Caesar on the Ides of March (March 15) that same year. On that day, Caesar was delayed going to the Senate because his wife tried to convince him not to go. The conspirators feared the plot had been found out. Brutus persisted, however, waiting for Caesar at the Senate, and allegedly still chose to remain even when a messenger brought him news that would otherwise have caused him to leave. When Caesar finally did come to the Senate, they attacked him. The conspirators attacked in such numbers that they even wounded one another. Brutus is said to have been wounded in the hand.\nAfter Caesar's assassination.\nAfter the assassination, the Senate passed an amnesty on the assassins. This amnesty was proposed by Caesar's friend and co-consul Mark Antony. Nonetheless, uproar among the people caused Brutus and the conspirators to leave Rome. Brutus settled in Crete from 44 to 42 BC.\nIn 43 BC, after Octavian received his consulship from the Senate, one of his first actions was to have the people that had assassinated Julius Caesar declared murderers and enemies of the state. Cicero, angry at Octavian, wrote a letter to Brutus explaining that the forces of Octavian and Mark Antony were divided. Antony had laid siege to the province of Gaul, where he wanted the governorship. In response to this siege, Octavian rallied his troops and fought a series of battles in which Antony was defeated. Upon hearing that neither Antonius nor Octavian had an army big enough to defend Rome, Brutus rallied his troops, which totalled about 17 legions. \nWhen Octavian heard that Brutus was on his way to Rome, he made peace with Antony. Their armies, which together totaled about 19 legions, marched to meet Brutus and Cassius. The two sides met in two engagements known as the Battle of Philippi. The first was fought on 3 October 42 BC, in which Brutus defeated Octavian's forces. Cassius was defeated by Antony, and committed suicide, because he thought Brutus had also failed. \nThe second engagement was fought on 23 October 42 BC and ended in Brutus' defeat. After the defeat, he fled into the nearby hills with only about four legions. Knowing his army had been defeated and that he would be captured, Brutus committed suicide. \nAntony, as a show of respect, ordered Brutus' body to be wrapped in his most expensive purple mantle, which was later stolen. Antony had the thief executed. Brutus was cremated, and his ashes were sent to his mother.\nLiterature.\nThe well-known phrase \"Et tu, Brute?\" (\"And you, Brutus?\") is famous as Caesar's last utterance in Shakespeare's play \"Julius Caesar\". The reason for the remark was that Caesar had thought him a friend."}

{"id": "266605", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=266605", "title": "Indian rupee", "text": "The Indian rupee () (sign: ; code: INR) is the official currency of the Republic of India. The currency is issued and controlled by the Reserve Bank of India. During the past 15 years, the value has ranged from $1 USD = 35\u201365 INR or 1 euro = 44\u201369 INR (see below: \"Convertibility\").\nThe modern rupee is sub-divided into 100 \"paise\" (singular \"paisa\"). The coins have values and of 5, 10, 20, 25 and 50 paise, as well as 1, 2, 5 and 10 rupees. The bank notes are available in values of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 2000 rupees.\nThe Indian rupee symbol () is an amalgam of both the Devanagari consonant \"\u0930\" (Ra) and the Latin letter \"R\" without the vertical bar. The design was presented to the public by the government of India on 15 July 2010.\nThe current abbreviation \"INR\" started in July 2010. Until then, the abbreviation \"Rs\" (or \"Re\") was used.\nOrigin of name.\nThe word \"rupee\" originates from the Sanskrit word \u0930\u094c\u092a\u094d\u092f(raupya) meaning \"silver\" or \"made of silver\". Many Indian languages use this root word, for example, \u0c30\u0c42\u0c2a\u0c3e\u0c2f\u0c3f (r\u016bp\u0101yi) in Telugu, \u0bb0\u0bc2\u0baa\u0bbe\u0baf\u0bcd (r\u016bb\u0101i) in Tamil, \u0930\u0941\u092a\u092f\u093e (rupay\u0101) in Hindi, \u0ab0\u0ac2\u0aaa\u0abf\u0aaf\u0acb (rupiyo) in Gujarati, \u0cb0\u0cc2\u0caa\u0cbe\u0caf\u0cbf (r\u016bp\u0101yi) in Kannada and Tulu, \u0d30\u0d42\u0d2a (r\u016bp\u0101) in Malayalam and \u0930\u0941\u092a\u092f\u0947 (rupaye) in Marathi.\nHowever, in West Bengal, Tripura, Mizoram, Odisha, and Assam, the Indian rupee is officially known by names derived from the Sanskrit word \u091f\u0919\u094d\u0915 (Tanka) which means money. The rupee is called \u099f\u09be\u0995\u09be (Taka) in Bengali, \u099f\u0995\u09be (t\u00f4ka) in Assamese and \u0b1f\u0b19\u0b4d\u0b15\u0b3e (Tanka) in Odia and is written as such on Indian banknotes.\nSymbol.\nOn March 5, 2009, the Government of India announced a contest to create a symbol for the rupee. During the 2010 Union budget of India, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee mentioned that the proposed symbol would reflect and capture the Indian ethos and culture. Five symbols were shortlisted, and the Cabinet selected the definitive symbol created by D. Udaya Kumar on July 15, 2010. The symbol is derived from a combination of the Devanagari letter \u2018\u0930\u2019 and English letter \u2018R\u2019. The parallel lines at the top (with white space between them) make an allusion to the tricolor and also depict an equality sign which symbolizes the nation's desire to reduce economic disparity. The Indian government has plans to adopt the symbol within six months in the country and globally within 18 to 24 months. Before the adoption of the symbol, the most commonly used symbols for the rupee were Rs, Re or if the text was in an Indian language, then an appropriate abbreviation in that language.\nNumeral system.\nIn Indian English, values at or above a hundred thousand Indian rupees are counted in terms of lakhs (one lakh = hundred thousand) and crores (one crore = ten million). For example, the amount 3,25,84,729.25 is read as three crores, twenty-five lakhs, eighty-four thousand, seven hundred and twenty-nine rupees and twenty-five paise. The use of million or billion, as is standard in American or British English, is not very common.\nHistory.\nUse in India.\nIndia was one of the earliest issuers of coins (circa 6th century BC). The first \"rupee\" is believed to have been introduced by Sher Shah Suri (1486\u20131545), based on a ratio of 40 copper pieces (paisa) per rupee. Among the earliest issues of paper rupees were those by the \"Bank of Hindustan\" (1770\u20131832), the \"General Bank of Bengal and Bihar\" (1773\u201375, established by Warren Hastings) and the \"Bengal Bank\" (1784\u201391), amongst others. Until 1815, the Madras Presidency also issued a currency based on the fanam, with 12 fanams equal to the rupee.\nHistorically, the rupee, derived from the Sanskrit word raupya, which means \"silver\", was a silver coin. This had severe consequences in the nineteenth century, when the strongest economies in the world were on the gold standard. The discovery of vast quantities of silver in the U.S. and various European colonies resulted in a decline in the relative value of silver to gold. Suddenly the standard currency of India could not buy as much from the outside world. This event was known as \"the fall of the rupee\".\nIndia was not affected by the imperial order-in-council of 1825 that attempted to introduce the British sterling coinage to the British colonies. British India at that time was controlled by the British East India Company. The silver rupee continued as the currency of India throughout the entire period of the British Raj and beyond. In 1835, British India set itself firmly upon a mono-metallic silver standard based on the rupee. His decision was influenced by a letter, written in the year 1805, by Lord Liverpool that extolled the virtues of mono-metallism.\nFollowing the Indian Mutiny in 1857, the British government took direct control of British India. Since 1851, gold sovereigns were being produced in large numbers at the Royal Mint branch in Sydney, New South Wales. In the year 1864 in an attempt to make the British gold sovereign become the 'imperial coin', the treasuries in Bombay and Calcutta were instructed to receive gold sovereigns. These gold sovereigns however never left the vaults. As was realized in the previous decade in Canada and the next year in Hong Kong, existing habits are not easy to replace. And just as the British government had finally given up any hopes of replacing the rupee in India with the pound sterling, they simultaneously realized, and for the same reasons, that they could not easily replace the silver dollar in the Straits Settlements with the Indian rupee, as had been the desire of the British East India Company.\nSince the great silver crisis of 1873, a growing number of nations had been adopting the gold standard. In 1898, following the recommendations of the Indian Currency Committee, British India officially adopted the gold exchange standard by pegging the rupee to the British pound sterling at a fixed value of 1 shilling 4 pence (i.e., 15 rupees = 1\u00a0pound). In 1920, the actual silver value of the rupee was increased in value to 2 shillings (10 rupees = 1\u00a0pound). In British East Africa at this time, the decision was made to replace the rupee with a florin. No such opportunity was, however, taken in British India.\nIn 1927, the peg was once more reduced, this time to 18 pence (13\u2153 rupees = 1\u00a0pound). This peg was maintained until 1966, when the rupee was devalued and pegged to the U.S. dollar at a rate of 7.5 rupees = 1 dollar (at the time, the rupee became equal to 11.4 British pence). This peg lasted until the U.S. dollar devalued in 1971.\nThe Indian rupee replaced the Danish Indian rupee in 1845, the French Indian rupee in 1954 and the Portuguese Indian escudo in 1961. Following independence in 1947, the Indian rupee replaced all the currencies of the previously autonomous states. Some of these states had issued rupees equal to those issued by the British (such as the Travancore rupee). Other currencies included the Hyderabad rupee and the Kutch kori. The nominal values during British rule (and the first decade of independence) were:\nIn 1957, decimalisation occurred, and the rupee was divided into 100 \"naye paise\" (Hindi for \"new paise\"). In 1964, the initial \"naye\" was dropped. Many still refer to 25, 50 and 75 paise as 4, 8 and 12 annas, respectively, not unlike the usage of \"bit\" in American English for \u215b dollar.\nThe rupee on the East African coast and South Arabia.\nIn East Africa, Arabia, and Mesopotamia, the Rupee and its related coins were current at various times. The usage of the Rupee in East Africa extended from Somalia in the north, to as far south as Natal. In Mozambique, the British India rupees were overstamped. In Kenya, the British East Africa Company minted the rupee and its fractions as well as pice. The rise in the price of silver, immediately after the First World War, caused the rupee to rise in value to two shillings sterling. In 1920 in British East Africa, the opportunity was then taken to introduce a new florin coin, hence bringing the currency into line with sterling. Shortly after that, the Florin was split into two East African shillings. This assimilation to sterling did not however happen in British India itself. In Somalia the Italian colonial authority minted 'rupia' to exactly the same standard, and called the pice 'besa'.\nThe rupee in the Straits Settlements.\nThe Straits Settlements were originally an outlier of the British East India Company. The Spanish dollar had already taken hold in the Straits Settlements by the time the British arrived in the nineteenth century, however, the East India Company tried to introduce the rupee in its place. These attempts were resisted by the locals, and by 1867 when the British government took over direct control of the Straits Settlements from the East India Company, attempts to introduce the rupee were finally abandoned.\nInternational use.\nWith Partition, the Pakistani rupee came into existence, initially using Indian coins and Indian currency notes simply overstamped with \"Pakistan\". In previous times, the Indian rupee was an official currency of other countries, including Aden, Oman, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the Trucial States, Kenya, Tanganyika, Uganda, the Seychelles, and Mauritius.\nThe Indian government introduced the Gulf rupee, also known as the Persian Gulf rupee (XPGR), as a replacement for the Indian rupee for circulation exclusively outside the country with the Reserve Bank of India [Amendment] Act, 1 May 1959. This creation of a separate currency was an attempt to reduce the strain put on India's foreign reserves by gold smuggling. After India devalued the rupee on 6 June 1966, those countries still using it \u2013 Oman, Qatar, and the Trucial States (which became the United Arab Emirates in 1971) \u2013 replaced the Gulf rupee with their own currencies. Kuwait and Bahrain had already done so in 1961 and 1965 respectively.\nThe Bhutanese ngultrum is pegged at par with the Indian rupee, and both currencies are accepted in Bhutan. The Indian rupee is also accepted in towns in Nepal which lie near the border with India. However, the Indian Rupee denominations of 500 and 1000 are banned in Nepal.\nConvertibility.\nOfficially, the Indian rupee has a market-set exchange rate. However, the RBI trades actively in the USD/INR currency market to impact effective exchange rates. Thus, the currency regime in place for the Indian rupee with respect to the US dollar is a \"de facto\" controlled exchange rate. This is sometimes called a \"managed\" float. Other rates such as the EUR/INR and INR/JPY have volatilities that are typical of floating exchange rates. It should be noted, however, that unlike China, successive administrations (through RBI, the central bank) have not followed a policy of \"pegging\" the INR to a specific foreign currency at a particular exchange rate. RBI intervention in currency markets is solely to deliver low \"volatility\" in the exchange rates, and not to take a \"view\" on the rate or direction of the Indian rupee in relation to other currencies.\nAlso affecting convertibility is a series of customs regulations restricting the import and export of rupees. Legally, foreign nationals are forbidden from importing or exporting rupees, while Indian nationals can import and export only up to 5000 rupees at a time, and the possession of 500 and 1000 rupee notes in Nepal is prohibited.\nRBI also exercises a system of capital controls in addition to the intervention (through active trading) in the currency markets. On the current account, there are no currency conversion restrictions hindering buying or selling foreign exchange (though trade barriers do exist). On the capital account, foreign institutional investors have convertibility to bring money in and out of the country and buy securities (subject to certain quantitative restrictions). Local firms are able to take capital out of the country in order to expand globally. But local households are restricted in their ability to do global diversification. However, owing to an enormous expansion of the current account and the capital account, India is increasingly moving towards \"de facto\" full convertibility.\nThere is some confusion regarding the interchange of the currency with gold, but the system that India follows is that money cannot be exchanged for gold, in any circumstances or any situation. Money cannot be changed into gold by the RBI. This is because it will become difficult to handle it. India follows the same gold-interchange principle as Great Britain and America."}

{"id": "266611", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=266611", "title": "ISO 4217", "text": "ISO 4217 is the international standard describing three-letter codes (also known as the currency code) to define the names of currencies, as established by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The ISO 4217 code list is the common way in banking and business, all over the world, for defining different currencies. In many countries, the codes for the more common currencies are so well-known, by the general public, that exchange rates written in newspapers or posted in banks use only those codes to define the different currencies, instead of translated currency names or currency symbols. ISO 4217 codes are used on airline tickets and international train tickets to remove any uncertainty about the price.\nCode formation.\nThe first two letters of the code are the two letters of ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes (which are also used as the basis for national top-level domains on the Internet). The third letter is usually the initial of the currency itself. So Japan's currency code is JPY, \"JP\" for Japan and \"Y\" for yen. This eliminates the problem caused by the names \"dollar, franc\" and \"pound\" being used in dozens of different countries, each having significantly differing values. Also, if a currency is revalued, the currency code's last letter is changed to distinguish it from the old currency. In some cases, the third letter is the initial for \"new\" in that country's language, to distinguish it from an older currency that was revalued; the code sometimes outlasts the usage of the term \"new\" itself (for example, the code for the Mexican peso is MXN). Other changes can be seen, however; the Russian ruble, for example, changed from RUR to RUB, where the B comes from the third letter in the word \"ruble\".\nThere is also a three-digit code number assigned to each currency, in the same manner as there is also a three-digit code number assigned to each country as part of ISO 3166. This numeric code is usually the same as the ISO 3166-1 numeric code. For example, USD (United States dollar) has code 840 which is also the numeric code for the US (United States).\nThe standard also defines the relationship between the major currency unit and any minor currency unit. Often, the minor currency unit has a value that is 1/100 of the major unit, but 1/1000 is also common. Some currencies do not have any minor currency unit at all. In others, the major currency unit has so little value that the minor unit is no longer generally used (e.g. the Japanese \"sen\", 1/100th of a yen). This is indicated in the standard by the currency exponent. For example, USD has exponent 2, while JPY has exponent 0. Mauritania does not use a decimal division of units, setting 1 ouguiya (UM) = 5 khoums, and Madagascar has 1 ariary = 5 iraimbilanja.\nISO 4217 includes codes not only for currencies, but also for precious metals (gold, silver, palladium and platinum; by definition expressed per one troy ounce, as compared to \"1 USD\") and certain other entities used in international finance, e.g. Special Drawing Rights. There are also special codes allocated for testing purposes (XTS), and to indicate no currency transactions (XXX). These codes all begin with the letter \"X\". The precious metals use \"X\" plus the metal's chemical symbol; silver, for example, is XAG. ISO 3166 never assigns country codes beginning with \"X\", these codes being assigned for privately customized use only (reserved, never for official codes)\u2014for instance, the ISO 3166-based NATO country codes (STANAG 1059, 9th edition) use \"X\" codes for imaginary exercise countries ranging from XXB for \"Brownland\" to XXR for \"Redland\", as well as for major commands such as XXE for SHAPE or XXS for SACLANT. Consequently, ISO 4217 can use \"X\" codes for non-country-specific currencies without risk of clashing with future country codes.\nSupranational currencies, such as the East Caribbean dollar, the CFP franc, the CFA franc BEAC and the CFA franc BCEAO are normally also represented by codes beginning with an \"X\". The euro is represented by the code EUR (EU is included in the ISO 3166-1 reserved codes list to represent the European Union). The predecessor to the euro, the European Currency Unit (ECU), had the code XEU.\nHistory.\nIn 1973, the ISO Technical Committee 68 decided to develop codes for the representation of currencies and funds for use in any application of trade, commerce or banking. At the 17th session (February 1978) of the related UN/ECE Group of Experts agreed that the three-letter alphabetic codes for International Standard ISO 4217, \"Codes for the representation of currencies and funds\", would be suitable for use in international trade.\nOver time, new currencies are created and old currencies are discontinued. Frequently, these changes are due to new governments (through war or a new constitution), treaties between countries standardizing on a currency, or revaluation of the currency due to excessive inflation. As a result, the list of codes must be updated from time to time. The ISO 4217 maintenance agency (MA), SIX Interbank Clearing, is responsible for maintaining the list of codes.\nActive codes.\nOfficial codes.\nThe following is a list of active codes of official ISO 4217 currency names.\nUnofficial codes.\nThe following is a list of active, unofficial codes that emulate the ISO 4217 format.\nExplanation of USD/USS/USN.\nThe US dollar actually has three codes assigned: USD, USS (same day) and USN (next day). According to UN/CEFACT recommendation 9, paragraphs 8-9 ECE/TRADE/203, 1996, available online :\nWithout currency code.\nA number of territories are not included in ISO 4217, because their currencies are: (a) not \"per se\" an independent currency but a variant of another currency, (b) a legal tender only issued as commemorative banknotes and/or coinage, or (c) a currency of an unrecognized or partially recognized state. These currencies are:\nThe following non-ISO codes are, however, sometimes used commercially:\nObsolete currency codes.\nA number of currencies were official ISO 4217 currency codes and currency names until their replacement by the euro or other currencies.\nNote that the currency names used below may not match the currency names used in the ISO standard itself, but the codes do match."}

On 8 December 2008, police stopped Liu and held him because of his work with Charter 08. He was not actually arrested until 23 June 2009. The government accused him of encouraging people to turn against the state. He had a trial on 23 December 2009. On 25 December 2009, the court decided he must go to prison for eleven years. The court also took away his political rights for two years.\nHe won the Nobel Peace Prize on 8 October 2010, for \"his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China.\" This was during the fourth time Liu was in prison.\nHe is the first Chinese person to win a Nobel Prize while living in China. He is also the third person to win the Nobel Peace Prize while in prison or detention. The others were Germany's Carl von Ossietzky in 1935 and Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi in 1991. \nOn 26 June 2017, he was granted medical parole after being diagnosed with terminal liver cancer. He died a few weeks later on 13 July 2017.\nEarly life and education.\nLiu was born in 1955 in Changchun, Jilin to an intellectual family. His father took him to the Inner Mongolia from 1969 to 1973 during the Down to the Countryside Movement. He worked in a village in Jilin province when he was 19 years old. He worked at a construction company after that.\nIn 1976, he studied at Jilin University and got a B.A. degree in literature in 1982. He earned an M.A. degree in 1984 from Beijing Normal University. Liu joined the faculty at Beijing Normal University after he graduated. He also received a Ph.D. degree there in 1988.\nIn the 1980s, his most important essays, \"Critique on Choices - Dialogue with Le Zehou\" and \"Aesthetics and Human Freedom\"' earned him fame in the academic field. The essay criticised a prominent Chinese thinker Li Zehou's philosophy.\nBetween 1988 and 1989, he was a visiting scholar at several universities outside of China, including Columbia University, the University of Oslo and the University of Hawaii.\nDuring the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests he was in the United States but decided to go back to China to join the movement. He was later named as one of the \"Four Junzis of Tiananman Square\" by many Hong Kong- and Taiwan-based Chinese media.\nHuman rights activities.\nLiu Xiaobo works to increase human rights. He has asked the Chinese government to be more open and honest about its actions. The Chinese government has brought him to police stations, arrested him, and sent him to prison many times for his peaceful political activities. The first time was for his actions in the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Organizations outside China have noticed Liu's human rights work and given him awards. In 2004, Reporters Without Borders honored Liu's human rights work, awarding him the Fondation de France Prize as a defender of press freedom.\nTime in prison.\nIn January 1991, Liu Xiaobo was convicted of \"counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement.\" However, the government did not give him any punishment as a criminal. In October 1996, he was ordered to serve three years of labour for \"disturbing public order\" by criticizing the Communist Party of China. In 2007, police took Liu for a short time and asked him about articles he had written. The articles were posted on websites hosted outside China.\n\"Charter 08\".\nWriting the Charter and making it well-known.\nLiu Xiaobo actively participated in the writing of Charter 08. Then, along with more than three hundred Chinese citizens, he signed \"Charter 08\". This was a manifesto, or statement of beliefs and principles. It was released on the 60th anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (10 December 2008). They wrote it in the style of the Czechoslovak Charter 77 calling for greater freedom of expression, human rights, and free elections. As of May 2009, the Charter has collected over 8,600 signatures from Chinese of various walks of life.\nArrest.\nPolice took Liu Xiaobo away from his home late in the evening of 8 December 2008. This was two days before the official release of the Charter. Police also took away Zhang Zuhua at that time. He is another scholar who signed Charter 08. According to Zhang, the two men were taken by police because they thought Liu and Zhang were trying to get more people to sign the Charter. While Liu was kept alone in solitary confinement, he was not allowed to meet with his lawyer or family. He was allowed to eat lunch with his wife, Liu Xia, and two policemen on New Year's Day 2009. On 23 June 2009, an officer of the government in Beijing (the procuratorate) approved Liu Xiaobo's arrest on charges of \"suspicion of inciting subversion of state power.\" This is a crime under Article 105 of the Law of the People's Republic of China. The Beijing Public Security Bureau (PSB) said in a press release that Liu had incited the subversion of state power and the overturn of the socialist system through methods such as spreading rumors and slander, using almost the exact words of Article 105. The Beijing PSB also said that Liu had \"fully confessed.\"\nTrial.\nOn 1 December 2009, Beijing police transferred Liu's case to the procuratorate for investigation and processing; on 10 December, the procuratorate formally indicted Liu on charges of \"inciting subversion of state power\" and sent his lawyers, Shang Baojun and Ding Xikui, the indictment document. He was tried at Beijing No. 1 Intermediate Court on 23 December 2009. His wife was not permitted to watch the trial, but his brother-in-law was there. Diplomats from more than 12 countries \u2013 including the U.S., Britain, Canada, Sweden, Australia and New Zealand \u2013 were not allowed in the court. They could not watch the trial. Some diplomats stood outside the court during the whole trial. Gregory May, political officer at the U.S. Embassy, and Nicholas Weeks, first secretary of the Swedish Embassy were among the diplomats who waited outside.\nSentence and imprisonment.\nOn 25 December, Liu Xiaobo was sentenced to eleven years' imprisonment and two years' deprivation of political rights by the Beijing No. 2 Intermediate Court on charges of \"inciting subversion of state power.\" According to Liu's family and counsel, he plans to fight this and ask for a new trial. The court said that Charter 08 was part of the evidence supporting his conviction.\nInternational response.\nMany individuals, states, and organizations around the world asked the Chinese government to release Liu. The Chinese government said no and told people outside China not to become involved. \nOn 11 December 2008, the United States Department of State called for Liu's release.\nOn 22 December 2008, an organization of scholars, writers, lawyers, and human rights workers wrote an open letter to ask the government to let Liu out of prison. On 21 January 2009, 300 international writers, including Salman Rushdie, Margaret Atwood, Ha Jin and Jung Chang, called for Liu's release in a statement put out through PEN. In March 2009 Liu Xiaobo was awarded with the Homo Homini Award by the One World Film Festival, organized by the People in Need foundation, for promoting freedom of speech, democratic principles and human rights.\nIn December 2009, the European Union and United States both officially asked the Chinese government to release of Liu Xiaobo without any special rules or conditions.\nBefore the court decision, China said that other nations should \"respect China's judicial sovereignty and to not do things that will interfere in China's internal affairs.\"\nResponding to the result in court, United Nations Human Rights Commissioner Navanethem Pillay expressed concern political rights in China becoming worse. German Chancellor Angela Merkel strongly criticized the verdict, stating \"despite the great progress in other areas in the expression of views, I regret that the Chinese government still massively restricts press freedom.\" Canada and Switzerland also condemned the verdict. Taiwan President Ma Ying-jeou called on Beijing to \"tolerate dissent\". On 6 January 2010, former Czech president V\u00e1clav Havel joined with other communist-era dissidents at the Chinese embassy in Prague to present a petition calling for Liu's release. On 22 January 2010, European Association for Chinese Studies sent an open letter to Hu Jintao on behalf of over 800 scholars from 36 countries calling for Liu's release.\nNobel Peace Prize.\nEvents leading up to the prize.\nOn 18 January 2010, Liu was named by many people as a nominee (possible winner) of the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize. These included V\u00e1clav Havel, the 14th Dalai Lama, Andr\u00e9 Glucksmann, Vartan Gregorian, and Desmond Tutu. China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ma Zhaoxu said that awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to Liu would be \"totally wrong\". Geir Lundestad, a secretary of the Nobel Committee, stated the award would not be influenced by Beijing's opposition. On 25 September 2010, \"The New York Times\" reported that a petition in support of the Nobel nomination was being circulated in China.\nIn September 2010 V\u00e1clav Havel, Dana N\u011bmcov\u00e1, and V\u00e1clav Mal\u00fd published an open letter in \"The International Herald Tribune\" calling for the award to be given to Liu. All three had been leaders of Czechoslovakia's Velvet Revolution. Soon after, people began signing a petition.\nFreedom Now is a non-governmental organization and works as a lawyer for Liu Xiaobo outside China. On 6 October 2010, they publicly released a letter from 30 U.S. Members of Congress to President Barack Obama (the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner). This letter strongly asked President Obama to talk directly to Chinese President Hu Jintao at the G-20 Summit in November 2010. They wanted Obama to talk about Liu Xiaobo and another political prisoner named Gao Zhisheng .\nPrize announcement.\nOn 8 October 2010 the Nobel Committee awarded Liu the Prize \"for his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China\". The Norwegian Nobel Committee president Thorbj\u00f8rn Jagland said the choice of Liu as the recipient of the prize had become clear early on in the process. The Chinese foreign ministry had already warned the Nobel committee not to give Liu the prize. They said that it would be against Nobel principles.\nAll news about the announcement of the award was immediately censored in China. Foreign news broadcasters including CNN and the BBC were immediately blocked after mentioning the award in China. Web searches for Liu Xiabo were immediately deleted and no information can be searched about him in China. The Chinese Foreign Ministry issued a statement that said, \"The Nobel Peace Prize is meant to award individuals who promote international harmony and friendship, peace and disarmament. Liu Xiaobo is a criminal who has been sentenced by Chinese judicial departments for violating Chinese law. Awarding the peace to Liu runs completely counter to the principle of the award and is also a desecration of the Peace Prize.\" The state-run Xinhua News Agency later carried a report saying that awarding Liu Xiaobo the prize \u201cdefiles\u201d (\u4eb5\u6e0e) Alfred Nobel's purpose of creating this prize and \"may harm China-Norway relations\". The spokesperson added that Liu had broken Chinese law and his \"actions run contrary to the purpose of the Nobel Peace Prize.\"\nResponses from world leaders.\nMany world leaders congratulated Liu for the award. These included Jose Manuel Barroso, President of the European Commission, The British Foreign Secretary William Hague, US President Barack Obama, and The Dalai Lama.\nOfficial Chinese government response.\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry called the Norwegian ambassador to the People's Republic of China to the ministry on 8 October 2010. The Chinese gave the ambassador an official complaint against awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to Liu Xiaobo. The Norwegian foreign minister replied that the Chinese government complaint was not needed because the group of people who decide the Nobel Prize is independent from the Norwegian government. However, the Norwegian Nobel Committee that gives the peace prize is appointed by the Norwegian parliament.\nPersonal life.\nHe is married to Liu Xia, who lives in the couple's apartment in Beijing.\nHealth and death.\nIn May 2017, Liu was diagnosed with terminal liver cancer. On 10 July 2017, Liu was listed in critical condition in hospital in Shenyang.\nLiu died at a hospital in Shenyang, Liaoning, China on 13 July 2017 of multiple organ failure as a set of complications of the disease at the age of 61."}

It says, \"A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\"\nBackground.\nWhen America was being colonized by European countries, firearms were very important to colonists. When Europeans came to America, they brought with them the idea of land ownership by an individual. They received this right from their king through land grants. This was completely foreign to Native Americans who considered a particular territory belonged to the tribe. Colonists defended their claims against Native Americans and other Europeans whose kings may have granted them the same lands. They also needed firearms for hunting. In many towns and villages, men were required to own firearms for the defense of the community. Most colonists coming to America in the 17th century had no experience as soldiers. The British kept few soldiers in the colonies, and colonists soon found they needed to establish militias. \nColonies had militia laws that required every able-bodied white man to be available for militia duty and to provide his own arms. In 1774 and 1775, the British government, which now had a larger presence, attempted to disarm American colonists. This caused the colonists to form private militias, independent of any control by the governors appointed by the British government. The Minutemen who fought the British Army at the Battles of Lexington and Concord were an independent militia. \nAfter the American Revolutionary War, the framers of the Constitution, like most Americans of the time, distrusted standing (permanent) armies and trusted militias. After the Revolutionary War, Americans trusted state militias to defend the country. The Articles of Confederation, the new nation's first constitution, called for each state to maintain a well-armed militia. Congress could call up the militias to defend the country against any foreign power. However, Congress could only form a standing army if nine of the thirteen states approved. This was one of the weaknesses that led to the Constitutional Convention of 1787 and a new constitution. \nIn the 18th century, the word \"army\" meant mercenaries. Americans distrusted standing armies and were afraid they could be used to take over the country. People still remembered Oliver Cromwell and his military dictatorship in England. \nState constitutions.\nVirginia was one of the first colonies to adopt a state constitution. They included the words: \"a well regulated Militia, composed of the body of the people, trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defence of a free State.\" Other states followed with similar wording in their own constitutions. Pennsylvania declared: \"the people have a right to bear arms for the defence of themselves and the state; and as standing armies in the time of peace are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be kept up; And that the military should be kept under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power.\" \nIn 1781 the Continental Congress approved the Articles of Confederation. This recognized that the thirteen original states had the power to govern themselves. They acted collectively to have a congress, but did not provide any money to run it. There was no president and no court system. This confederation of states proved to be a very poor form of central government.\nPhiladelphia Convention of 1787.\nThe Constitutional Convention met in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania from May 25 to September 17, 1787. The purpose of the Convention was to revise the Articles of Confederation. But it became clear that many of its members, including James Madison and Alexander Hamilton, wanted to create a new government rather than fix the existing one. The delegates elected George Washington to preside over the Convention. They eventually agreed on agreed on Madison's Virginia Plan and began to make changes. The result was the Constitution of the United States and the present form of government.\nBill of Rights.\nThe constitution debate at Philadelphia caused two groups to form: the Federalists and the Anti-federalists. The federalists wanted a strong central government. The anti-federalists wanted the state governments to have more power. The vote on the new Constitution was passed on a promise by federalists to support a Bill of Rights to be added to the Constitution. \nOriginally, Congress suggested 12 amendments to the states. However, the states only ratified ten. The Bill of Rights, as the first 10 amendments came to be called, originally applied to the national government rather than to states. Many states already had their own Bill of Rights. The Bill of Rights was ratified and went into effect in 1791.\nDifferent interpretations.\nThe Second Amendment was a result of several proposals being combined and simplified into just 27 words. This simplification has caused many debates over gun ownership and individual rights. Historians, judges and others have repeatedly looked for the intended meaning by the 18th century writers of this amendment. Different interpretations of the Second Amendment still cause public debates about firearm regulations and gun control.\nCapitalization and punctuation.\nIn 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit heard a case called \"Heller v. District of Columbia\". At the time, it was illegal for regular Americans to have a gun in Washington, D.C. To decide whether this was against the Second Amendment, the court looked very closely at capitalization and punctuation in the Amendment to try to figure out exactly what the framers meant.\nJudge Laurence H. Silberman wrote the Court's decision. It made the ban on guns by the District of Columbia invalid. The decision was based on the second comma (after the word \"state\") as proof that the Second Amendment allows individuals the right to carry a gun. This is in addition to state's rights to maintain militias.\nThe Second Amendment ratified by the States and approved by the Secretary of State, Thomas Jefferson, said:\nThe version passed by Congress and signed by President George Washington (but never ratified by the States) said:\nOn June 25, 2008, the Supreme Court agreed with the Court of Appeals' decision. (In the Supreme Court, the case was called \"District of Columbia v. Heller\".)"}

Other examples of foods eaten with couscous are fish, shrimp, and chicken.\nCouscous is sold in most supermarkets across Europe and the United States and has been pre-steamed and dried; the package directions are usually to add 1.5 measures of \"boiling\" water or stock and butter to each measure of couscous and to cover tightly for five minutes. The couscous swells and within a few minutes it is ready to fluff with a fork and serve. Pre-steamed couscous takes less time to prepare than regular couscous."}

Elephant guns were first made to be used by big-game hunters who were hunting elephants and other large animals.\nEarly use.\nAs people from Europe began exploring Africa in the early 1800s, guns were made to handle the very large animals that people saw. This was for people to protect themselves, to shoot animals for food, and later, and most commonly, sport. The first guns were the simple shotgun designs already used for birds. They were loaded with solid balls of lead that could shoot large animals. Because they did not kill large animals very easily (some writers said that it could take up to 35 shots to kill one elephant), elephant guns were soon made into larger caliber black powder smoothbores. The caliber was still measured in bore or gauge - or the guns were named by how much the projectiles (what was shot out of the guns) weighed in ounces. The projectiles were lead round balls or short slugs shaped like cones. Sometimes, antimony was put in them to make them harder.\nThese very large and heavy firearms were the first to be known as the elephant guns of the black powder era (1850\u20131890). They were not only used to kill elephants. They were also used to kill dangerous animals such as the rhinoceros, the hippopotamus and the cape buffalo. Because black powder and lead cannot go faster than about - the only way to make the projectiles go deeper into the animals' skins was to make a larger gun. Although they were very powerful, the short slugs (a type of projectile), which did not go very fast, still had problems going fully into their targets. This was especially hard for the toughest shot of all - going through the bone when an elephant's head was shot around the brain area. \nNitro Express rifles.\nNitro Express elephant guns were first made around 1895. They used smokeless powder, which was new at the time. With smaller metal-cased bullets with sizes from .400 to .620 and speeds around , they had a much better trajectory and penetration over the black powder guns. In a few years the big bore guns disappeared from the gamefields. Early 20th century rifles came out in single shot, bolt action, and double rifle ways and were used until ivory hunting died off in the mid 20th century. Then the guns switched roles to tools for game wardens and as backup firearms for professional hunters guiding international hunters.\nThe American gun market made several famous dangerous gun cartridges around this time, such as the .458 Winchester Magnum, .378 Weatherby Magnum and .460 Weatherby Magnum. Many of these were 'wildcatted' (to modify an existing case and rifle to fire a different caliber bullet). The rest of the old Nitro express calibers faded to obscurity until people starting safari hunting in the 1970s and 1980s. Then elephant guns like the .416 Weatherby Magnum and the .416 Remington Magnum were made again. The .700 Nitro Express (made in the 1980's and 1990's) and the new brass manufacturers made even more powerful elephant guns such as the .585 Nyati by Ross Seyfried, .577 Tyrannosaur by Colonel Art Alphin and .585 Gehringer by Karl Gehringer to be made by wildcatters. The .600 Overkill made by Rob Garnick shows the biggest power that could come from a standard hunting action. Other wildcats based on the heavy machine gun .50 BMG and similar anti-materiel rounds have been devised which are much more powerful, though they are not generally useful hunting arms because they are heavier than .\nFeatures.\nAll elephant guns have one idea in common: to have enough stopping power to prevent harm to the hunter in the case of charging game. The necessities for the gun are not only very high power (any big gun could do that), but that it can be carried for long periods, shot from any position, and be well balanced enough to track on rapidly moving animals. It is really no more than a very big hunting rifle with the same use as any hunting rifle.\nUse in war.\nDuring World War I, both the British and Germans used elephant guns taken from their African colonies when they tried to break the stalemate in the trenches. The British used elephant guns against the German tactic of having their snipers advance towards Allied lines under the cover of a large, 6-10 millimeter (0.24-0.4\u00a0inch) thick steel plate. Ordinary infantry rifles didn't do anything to the plate, but elephant guns were able to punch through it. Likewise, the Germans used a mass-produced anti-tank rifle, the Mauser 1918 TuF Gewehr, to knock out lightly armored British tanks.\nDuring the North African Campaign in 1941, the Italians in East Africa fought against the British. The Commander - The Duke of Aosta - gave his personal collection of elephant guns to his Italian soldiers to shoot armored cars because they didn't have enough anti-tank guns.\nThe Finnish 20\u00a0mm antitank gun Lahti L-39 had the nickname \"Norsupyssy\" (Elephant Gun) during the Winter War because of its stopping power. It is not a true elephant gun, though, since it was not made for elephant hunting but as a military weapon."}

In the sixteenth century Sedan was a safe place for Protestants escaping from the Wars of Religion.\nUntil 1651, the Principality of Sedan belonged to the La Tour d'Auvergne family. It was independent. The most famous member of the family, Marshal Turenne, was born at Sedan on 11 September 1611. With help from the Holy Roman Empire, Sedan defeated France at the Battle of La Marf\u00e9e. Immediately after that it was surrounded, and its prince, Frederic, surrendered to France. Only a year after that, it became part of France in return for sparing Frederic's life after he was in a plot against France.\nDuring the Franco-Prussian War, on 2 September 1870 the French emperor Napoleon III was taken prisoner with 100,000 of his soldiers at the Battle of Sedan.\nBecause of this major victory, which also made the \"Second Reich\" of Germany possible, 2 September was declared \"Sedan Day\" (\"Sedantag\") and a national German holiday in 1871. It remained a holiday until 1919.\nIn World War II the German army invaded neutral Belgium and crossed the Meuse River in Sedan.

The finals of the tournament usually takes place in De Kuip, and has been held there every season since 1988. The winners of the cup compete against the winners of the Eredivisie for the Johan Cruijff Shield, which is the first game of the following season.\nHistory.\nThe competition was created during a board meeting of the Dutch National Football Association, in the Hague, on 19 January 1898. The tournament began the following season, 1898\u20131899. The first final was played on 9 May 1899 between RAP Amsterdam and HVV Den Haag. In 1946, the trophy was changed to one made out of silver, which was very rare in after World War II.\nName changes.\nLike many national cup competitions, the name of the tournament has changed with sponsorship. From 1995, the competition went from being the KNVB Cup Tournament to being known as the Amstel Cup after the then sponsor Amstel. On 16 August 2005, the name was changed to the Gatorade Cup after the drinks company Gatorade. In 2006, the name returned to being the KNVB Cup Tournament with Gatorade remaining as the principal sponsor.\nEuropean competition.\nUp until 1998, the winner of the cup entered into the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, but with the abandonment of that tournament, the winner now goes into the UEFA Europa League. If the winning team has won the Eredivisie and thus entry into the UEFA Champions League, then the beaten KNVB Cup finalist will take the place in the UEFA Europa League.\nIn 1998, both teams in the KNVB final, Ajax and PSV, had won places into the Champions League.

{"id": "267113", "revid": "373511", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=267113", "title": "Fuji Speedway", "text": " is a race track standing in the foothills of Mount Fuji, in Oyama, Sunt\u014d District, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan. It was built in the early 1960s and hosted the first Formula One race in Japan in 1976. In the 1980s, Fuji Speedway was used for the FIA World Sportscar Championship and national racing. When it first opened, it was managed by Mitsubishi. Fuji Speedway was purchased by Toyota Motor Corporation in 2000. Fuji Speedway is known for having one of the longest straights in motorsport tracks, at in length.\nHistory.\nF1 launches in Japan.\nFuji Speedway Corporation was established in 1963, as Japan NASCAR Corporation. At first, the circuit was planned to hold NASCAR-style races in Japan. The track was designed to be a high-banked superspeedway. There was not enough money to complete the project and only one of the banked turns was ever designed. Mitsubishi Estate Co. (a part of Mitsubishi) invested in the circuit. They took over the management rights in October 1965.\nThe track was converted to a road course. Fuji speedway opened in December 1965. The banked turn was somewhat dangerous, and caused several major accidents. According to Vic Elford \"The reason that banking was so horrific, was that at the end of the straight we went over a blind crest at around 190/200 mph and \"dropped into\" the banking. At other tracks (Daytona, Monthlery, etc.) you climb up the banking.\"\nA new part of track was built to fix the problem. The new course was more successful. In 1966, the track hosted a USAC Indy Car non-championship race, won by Jackie Stewart. The speedway brought the first Formula One race to Japan at the end of the season. Mario Andretti won the race, and James Hunt earned enough points to win the world championship title.\nIn Gilles Villeneuve was involved in a crash that killed two spectators on the side of the track. Formula One stopped racing at the speedway and Japan. When Japan was added back to the F1 schedule ten years later, it went to Suzuka instead. F1 didn't return to Fuji until .\nNational racing venue.\nFuji remained a popular sports car racing venue. FIA World Sportscar Championship visited the track between 1982 and 1988. Fuji was often used for national races. Two chicanes were added to the track to slow down the speeds. Even with these changes, the main feature of the track remained its long straight, one of the longest in all of motorsports.\nThe long pit straight has also been used for drag racing. NHRA exhibitions were run in 1989. Local drag races are common on the circuit.\nThe track is still used for Japanese national races. In 2000 the majority of the shares of stock were bought by Toyota. Toyota was making plans for future motor racing.\nRenovations.\nIn 2003 the circuit was closed to for a major reprofiling of the track. A new design from Hermann Tilke was used. The circuit reopened on 10 April 2005. It hosted its first Formula One championship event in 29 years on 30 September 2007. The race won by Lewis Hamilton.\nThe circuit hosts the NISMO Festival for historic Nissan racers. Toyota also hosts its own historic event a week before the NISMO called Toyota Motorsports Festival. Nearby is a drifting course, which was built as part of the refurbishment.\nThe only time the circuit is run on a reverse direction is during the D1 Grand Prix drifting round. The series has hosted its rounds since 2003, with the exception of the 2004 closure. The circuit became the first to take place on an international level racetrack and the first of the three to take place on an F1 circuit.\nAs part of the 2003 renovations, most of the old banked section of track was removed. Only a small section remains.\nFollowing both poor ticket sales and bad weather it was decided by FOM that the Japanese Grand Prix would be shared between Fuji Speedway and Suzuka on alternate years. Suzuka would hold the next race on 4 October 2009. After the global recession and its own financial problems, Toyota decided to stop hosting of Japanese Grand Prix.\nFuji Speedway in video games.\nThe Fuji circuit is known to fans of the arcade racing game Pole Position, as cars raced on the circuit.\nFuji is also featured in a number of video games including \"Top Gear\", several \"Gran Turismo\" games and \"TOCA Race Driver\".\nFuji Speedway in television.\nThe Fuji circuit is featured prominently in the Japanese television drama \"Engine\" as the main setting for the racing scenes. It is also the home of the (fictional) \"Regulus Cup\"."}

Christians believe that Jesus turned water into wine at a wedding where there was not enough to drink (see the picture at the right). \nThe Bible says that wine was also important at the Last Supper - the last time Jesus ate with his disciples before he was arrested. The Bible's Gospel of Matthew 26:27 says that Jesus held up a cup of wine and told all of his disciples: \n\"Take this [cup] all of you and drink from it. This is the cup of my blood ... My blood will be shed for you and for all so that sins may be forgiven.\"\nSince that time, Roman Catholic church services have always included something called the Eucharist (also called \"Holy Communion\"). A priest holds up a cup of wine and says a prayer. At that point, Catholics believe the wine is turned into Jesus's blood. They believe drinking the wine is a way of remembering that Jesus was willing to die so their sins would be forgiven.\nEarly Christian Beliefs.\nIn the first 1,800 years of church history, Christians often enjoyed alcoholic drinks as a part of their everyday life. At church, during the Eucharist, they almost always used wine.\nEarly Christians believed the Bible and Christian tradition both said alcohol is a gift from God. They taught that this gift made life happier, but that drinking too much alcohol and becoming drunk was a sin. \nProtestant Beliefs.\nIn the early 1500s, the Protestant Church split off from the Roman Catholic Church. Over time, these two Christian churches started to believe some different things.\nBy the mid-1800s, some Protestant Christians moved away from the traditional belief that drinking a moderate (small) amount of wine was not bad. (This belief was sometimes called \"moderationism\"). Some Protestants decided that not drinking wine at all was wisest (this was called \"abstentionism\"). Others decided that drinking any alcohol was sinful (this was called \"prohibitionism\"). \nBeliefs About Alcohol Today.\nToday, there are many different types of Christianity, with many different beliefs. Most people still believe in the traditional position: that drinking some wine is all right, just not too much. Most Christians' opinions about alcohol depend on how they understand what the Bible says about it.\nAlcohol in the Bible.\nThe Bible often mentions alcoholic drinks. Sometimes it talks about real wine. Other times, it uses the word \"wine\" to mean something else. \nThe Bible says that alcohol is a blessing from God that makes people happy, but it can also be dangerously and sinfully used.\nThe Bible uses a few different words for alcoholic drinks. Though prohibitionists and some abstentionists disagree, most people agree that the words were usually meant to be about intoxicating drinks (drinks that can make a person drunk).\nWine was an important and common drink in Biblical times. Because of this, the Bible sometimes uses wine as a symbol to teach about good and bad. Some parts of the Bible use wine as a symbol for good things, like abundance and health. However, the Bible also calls wine a mocker and beer a brawler (a person who fights too much). Other parts of the Bible use drinking a cup of strong wine and getting drunk as a symbol of God's anger."}

The choir has about 140 members at the moment.\nThe choir sings many types of music, including music from these periods: Baroque, Classical and Romantic orchestral works, and also modern New Zealand choral music. The Choir usually sings in about four or five concerts a year, often performing with an orchestra called Southern Sinfonia. Choir practice is held every week in the Crypt of St Paul's Cathedral on the Octagon in the middle of Dunedin.\nRecent Performances.\nThe music in the City of Dunedin Choir's recent concerts include:\nSchubert: Mass in A Flat;\nOrff: Carmina Burmana;\nElgar: Dream of Gerontius;\nBach: A Christmas Oratorio;\nRalph Vaughan Williams: Serenade to Music;\nHandel: The King Shall Rejoice;\nPurcell: Come ye Sons of Art;\nMendelssohn: As the Hart Pants;\nHandel: My Heart is Inditing;\nHaydn: Nelson Mass;\nHandel: Messiah;\nBach: St. John Passion;\nFaure: Cantique de Jean Racine;\nFaure: Requiem and\nAlexander Estrange: Zimbe!\nUpcoming Concerts.\nUpcoming City of Dunedin Choir Concerts include a performance of 'Saint Nicolas' by Benjamin Britten.\nHistory.\nThe City of Dunedin Choir has been making audiences enjoy themselves around the region for nearly 150 years. The choir used to be two choirs, the Musical Union and the Choral Society, which were both made in 1863 and they joined together the following year with George West as conductor.\nThe name of the choir became Dunedin Choral Society Incorporated a few years later. The society stopped existing in 1888 but started existing with the same name as before in 1897 with James Coombs as conductor. It changed its name to Schola Cantorum in 1967, after joining together with the University Union Choir, and then it changed its name to City of Dunedin Choir in 1993, the year it had existed for 130 years. However, through all these \"trading name\" changes, the official name remains Dunedin Choral Society Incorporated.\nVice-Regal Patronage\nThe Choir's immediate past Patron was the Hon. Dame Silvia Cartwright. The choir's archives, which are at the Hocken Library, say that, Mr H.S. Chapman, Supreme Court Judge, was Patron in 1878 and Governor, the Earl of Ranfurly, was Patron in 1898. They also say that Sir Hercules Robinson, Governor from 1879 to 1880, attended several concerts during his time as Governor, but he was not a patron.\nReferences.\nThe archives of the City of Dunedin Choir are in the Hocken Library, Anzac Avenue, Dunedin, New Zealand.\nThe Choir has recently been listed on SOUNZ (http://sounz.org.nz), a submission process which includes details of the Choir's performances of works by New Zealand composers.

Such enzymes, found in bacteria and archaea, probably evolved to provide a defense mechanism against invading viruses. Inside a bacterial host, the restriction enzymes selectively cut up \"foreign\" DNA. Host DNA is modified so it does not get cut up. Together, these two processes are called the restriction modification system. To cut the DNA, a restriction enzyme makes two cuts, once through each sugar-phosphate backbone (i.e. each strand) of the DNA double helix."}

{"id": "267251", "revid": "18539", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=267251", "title": "Peter Scott", "text": "Sir Peter Markham Scott (London, 14 September 1909 \u2013 Bristol, 29 August 1989) was a British ornithologist, conservationist, painter, Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve officer and sportsman.\nScott was knighted in 1973 for his contribution to the conservation of wild animals. He had been a founder of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), a founder of several wetlands bird sactuaries in Britain, and an influence on international conservation. He received the WWF Gold Medal, and the J. Paul Getty Prize for his work.\nEarly life.\nScott was born in London, the only child of Antarctic explorer Robert Falcon Scott (\"Scott of the Antarctic\") and sculptor Kathleen Bruce. He was two years old when his father died. Robert Scott, in a last letter to his wife, advised her to \"make the boy interested in natural history if you can; it is better than games\".\nHe was educated at Oundle School and Trinity College, Cambridge, at first taking Natural Sciences but graduating in the History of Art in 1931. After graduating, he studied art in Germany and London.\nHe had his first exhibition in London in 1933, and sold his first paintings. In 1935 he published \"Morning Flight\", illustrated by himself. As a young man, Scott was not wealthy, and the income from his paintings was the basis of his life. The paintings themselves sold well, but most of the income came from books and reproductions. The reproductions, which were printed by Ankermann of Bond Street, are still selling well. From this 'income stream' Scott was able to keep a family, and buy some of the land he wanted for wildfowl refuges.\nIn the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games, he represented Great Britain at sailing, winning a bronze medal in the smallest class of boat, the O-Jolle or dinghy.\nWorld War II.\nAs war approached, in 1939, he joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. In 1940 he was a in a Destroyer as a Lieutenant. After joining Coastal Forces he rose to Lieutenant-Commander and commanded a flotilla of Motor Gun Boats in the Channel. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross with bar and an MBE (Military Division). In 1944 he was a Staff Officer and in March 1945 he was appointed Captain of the brand new Frigate HMS 'Cardigan Bay'.\nAfter the war.\nIn 1948, he founded the organisation with which he was ever afterwards closely associated, the Severn Wildfowl Trust (now the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust) with its headquarters at Slimbridge in Gloucestershire.\nIn the years that followed, he became a television personality, popularising the study of wildfowl and wetlands. His BBC natural history series, \"Look\", ran from 1955 to 1981 and made him a household name. From 1973 to 1983, Scott was Chancellor of the University of Birmingham.\nHe was the founder President of the Society of Wildlife Artists and President of the Nature in Art Trust, (a role in which Philippa succeeded him)."}

The Royal Navy shortened \"Master and Commander\" to \"Commander\" in 1794; however, the term \"Master and Commander\" remained in common use for many years.

Most were written by Alexander Hamilton or James Madison, though a few were written by John Jay. \nOne of the most famous of the Papers is Federalist No. 10. It was written by Madison and says that the Constitution would keep the United States from being run by small groups called \"factions\". The collection of all papers was also published as a book. \nThe papers were published using a false name, \"Publius\". This name was used in reference to Publius Valerius Publicola, a Roman Consul and one of the aristocrats who overthrew the Roman Kingdom in the 5th century BC. \nThe papers are often thought of as one of the most important works of American political thought.

{"id": "267364", "revid": "532461", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=267364", "title": "Korean Demilitarized Zone", "text": "The Korean Demilitarized Zone () is a piece of land running across the Korean Peninsula that serves as a buffer zone between North and South Korea. The DMZ cuts the Korean Peninsula almost in half, crossing the 38th parallel. The west end of the DMZ is south of the parallel and the east end is to the north of it. It is long, and about wide and is the most highly militarized border in the world. The border between both Koreas in the Yellow Sea and its coastline is known as the Northern Limit Line. Both sides of the Northern Limit Line are also heavily guarded.\nHistory.\nThe 38th parallel north cuts the Korean peninsula roughly in half. The parallel was the original boundary between the US-occupied and Soviet-occupied areas of Korea at the end of World War II. When the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK, informally North Korea) and the Republic of Korea (ROK, informally South Korea) were created in 1948, this line became a de facto international border between the two countries. It was also one of the most tense fronts in the Cold War.\nBoth the North and the South remained heavily dependent on their sponsor states from 1948 to the outbreak of the Korean War. The conflict claimed over three million lives and divided the Korean Peninsula along ideological lines. On June 25, 1950, a Soviet-sponsored DPRK invasion crossed the 38th parallel. The conflict ended three years later. International troops had been deployed and pushed the frontline back to near the 38th parallel. In the ceasefire of July 27, 1953, the DMZ was created. Each side agreed in the armistice to move their troops back from the front line, creating a buffer zone wide. The Military Demarcation Line (MDL) goes down the center of the DMZ and indicates exactly where the front was when the agreement was signed.\nIn theory, this is a stalemate. Neither side won or lost. Because of this, both sides of the conflict are still enemies, and a large number of troops is still stationed along both sides of the line. The armistice agreement explains exactly how many military personnel and what kind of weapons are allowed in the DMZ. Soldiers from both sides may patrol inside the DMZ, but they may not cross the MDL. Sporadic outbreaks of violence due to North Korean hostilities killed over 500 South Korean soldiers and 50 U.S. soldiers along the DMZ between 1953 and 1999.\nTae Sung Dong and Kijong-dong were the only villages allowed by the armistice committee to remain within the boundaries of the DMZ. Residents of Tae Sung Dong are governed and protected by the United Nations Command and are generally required to spend at least 240 nights per year in the village to maintain their residency. In 2008, the village had a population of 218 people. The villagers of Tae Sung Dong are direct descendants of people who owned the land before the 1950-53 Korean War.\nJoint Security Area.\nInside the DMZ, near the western coast of the peninsula, is a place called Panmunjeom. The Joint Security Area (JSA) is located there. Originally, it was the only connection between North and South Korea. In 2007 a Korail train crossed the DMZ to the North on the new Donghae Bukbu Line built on the east coast of Korea.\nThere are several buildings on both sides of the Military Demarcation Line. A few are built right on top of the MDL. The Joint Security Area is the location where all negotiations since 1953 have been held, including statements of Korean solidarity, which have generally amounted to little except a slight decline of tensions. The MDL goes through the conference rooms and down the middle of the conference tables where the North Koreans and the United Nations Command (primarily South Koreans and Americans) meet face to face.\nThough generally calm, the DMZ has been the scene of much saber-rattling between the two Koreas over the years. Several small skirmishes have occurred within the Joint Security Area since 1953. The Axe Murder Incident in August 1976 involved the attempted trimming of a poplar tree which resulted in two deaths (CPT Arthur Bonifas and 1LT Mark Barrett) and Operation Paul Bunyan. Beforehand, the soldiers of both sides were permitted to go back and forth across the MDL inside of the JSA, a privilege since revoked as a result of this incident.\nAnother incident occurred on November 23, 1984, when a Soviet tourist, who was part of an official trip to the JSA (hosted by the North), ran across the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) shouting that he wanted to defect. North Korean troops immediately chased after him opening fire. Border guards on the South Korean side returned fire eventually surrounding the North Koreans as they pursued the Russian national. One South Korean and three North Korean soldiers were killed in the action. The defector was not captured.\nIn late 2009, South Korean forces and the United Nations Command began renovation of its three guard posts and two checkpoint buildings within the JSA compound. Construction was designed to enlarge and modernise the structures. Work was undertaken a year after North Korea finished replacing four JSA guard posts on its side of the MDL.\nSecret tunnels.\nSouth Korea has discovered tunnels that cross the DMZ. To build these tunnels, explosives were used. This left certain traces, called \"blasting lines\". The orientation of these blasting lines shows that the tunnels were built from north to south, North Korea built them. In total, four tunnels have been discovered, the first on November 15, 1974. North Korea claimed that the tunnels were used for coal mining. No coal has been found in the tunnels. All tunnels were dug in a rock called granite. Some of the tunnel walls have been painted black to give the appearance of anthracite.\nIt is believed the tunnels were built to allow a North Korean military invasion. Each tunnel is big enough, so an entire infantry division can pass in one hour, but the tunnels are too small for tanks or other vehicles. All the tunnels run in a north-south direction and do not have branches. Engineering within the tunnels, following each discovery, has become progressively more advanced. For example, the third tunnel sloped slightly upwards as it progressed southward, to prevent water stagnation. Today, visitors may visit the second, third and fourth tunnels through guided tours.\nFirst tunnel.\nThe first of the tunnels was discovered by a South Korean Army patrol, noticing steam rising from the ground. The initial discovery was met with machine gun fire from North Korean soldiers. Five days later, during a subsequent exploration of this tunnel, U.S. Navy Commander Robert M. Ballinger and ROK Marine Corps Major Kim Hah Chul were killed in the tunnel by a North Korean explosive device. The blast also wounded five Americans and one South Korean from the United Nations Command.\nThe tunnel, which was about high by wide, extended more than beyond the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) into South Korea. The tunnel was reinforced with concrete slabs and had electric power and lighting. There were weapons storage and sleeping areas. A narrow gauge railway with carts had also been installed. Estimates based on the tunnel's size, suggest it would have allowed approximately 2,000 KPA soldiers (one regiment) to pass through it per hour.\nSecond tunnel.\nThe second tunnel was discovered on March 19, 1975. It is of similar length to the first tunnel. It is located between below ground, but is larger than the first, approximately .\nThird tunnel.\nThe third tunnel was discovered on October 17, 1978. Unlike the previous two, the third tunnel was discovered following a tip from a North Korean defector. This tunnel is about long and about below ground. Foreign visitors touring the South Korean DMZ may view inside this tunnel using a sloped access shaft.\nFourth tunnel.\nA fourth tunnel was discovered on March 3, 1990 north of Haen town in the former Punchbowl battlefield. The tunnel's dimensions are 2m x 2m and it is 145m underground, the method of construction is almost identical in structure to the second and the third tunnels.\nPropaganda.\nBuildings.\nBoth North and South Korea maintain \"peace villages\" in sight of each other's side of the DMZ. In the South, Daeseong-dong is administered under the terms of the DMZ. Villagers are classed as Republic of Korea citizens, however they are exempt from paying tax and other civic requirements such as military service.\nIn the North, Kijong-dong features a number of brightly painted, poured-concrete multi-story buildings and apartments with electric lighting. These features represented an unheard of level of luxury for rural Koreans, north or south, in the 1950s. The town was oriented so that the bright blue roofs and white sides of the buildings would be the most distinguishing features when viewed from the border. However scrutiny with modern telescopic lenses reveals that the buildings are mere concrete shells lacking window glass or even interior rooms, with the building lights turned on and off at set times and the empty sidewalks swept by a skeleton crew of caretakers in an effort to preserve the illusion of activity.\nUntil 2004, massive loudspeakers mounted on several of the buildings continuously delivered DPRK propaganda broadcasts directed towards the south as well as propaganda radio broadcasts across the border.\nWithin the JSA are a number of U.N. buildings called Conference Row these are used for direct talks between the two Koreas. Facing the UN buildings is DPRK's Panmungak () and ROK's Freedom House. In 1994, North Korea enlarged Panmungak by adding a third floor. In 1998, South Korea built a new Freedom House for its Red Cross staff and to possibly host reunions of families separated by the Korean War. The new building incorporated the old Freedom House Pagoda within its design.\nIn the 1980s, the South Korean government built a flagpole in the village of Daeseong-dong. The North Korean government responded by building a taller one \u2014 the tallest in the world at in Kijong-dong.\nKorean wall.\nThe \"Korean wall\" is a concrete barrier that was allegedly built along the length of the DMZ in South Korea between 1977 and 1979. Dutch journalist and filmmaker Peter Tetteroo shows footage of what he believes (at the prompting of his North Korean guides) to be the Korean Wall. North Korea contends: \nIn the area south of the Military Demarcation Line, which cuts across our country at its waist, there is a concrete wall which [...] stretches more than from east to west, is high, thick at the bottom, and wide in the upper part. It is set with wire entanglements and dotted with gun embrasures, look-outs and varieties of military establishments [...] the South Korean rulers built this wall over a period of many years from 1977.\nIn December 1999, Chu Chang Jun, North Korea's longtime ambassador to China, repeated claims that a \"wall\" divided Korea. He said the south side of the wall is packed with soil, which permits access to the top of the wall and makes it effectively invisible from the south side. He also claimed that it served as a bridgehead for any northward invasion. One clarification in 2007, from an assistant of Mr. Cho at the Korean embassy in WDC, that this is mostly, or at least partly, an artificial cliff cut into the north side of the terrain, and explains this combination semantic and 'blind-men &amp; elephant' issue. At the security passage between the North &amp; South, it is easy to manage the contours and make the cliff invisible from the limited points of view allowed within the security compound. None of the plausible descriptions from the North, South, or USA, contradicts this explanation of the appearance or function of this at least partly one-sided wall.\nAccording to the United States, the wall does not exist, although there are anti-tank barriers along some sections of the DMZ.\nTransportation.\nPanmunjeom is the site where the negotiations that ended the Korean War took place. It is the main centre of human activity in the DMZ today. The village is located on the main highway and near a railroad connecting the two Koreas.\nThe railway, which connects Seoul and Pyongyang, was called the Gyeongui Line before Korea was divided in the 1940s. Currently the South uses the original name, but the North refers to the route as the P'y\u014fngbu Line. Today, the railway is mainly used to carry materials to the industrial complexes at Kaesong. South Korea workers also use it to commute there. When it was reopened in the early 2000s, this was seen as a sign that the relations between both countries were improving. However in November 2008 North Korean authorities closed the railway because of growing tensions with the South. When former South-Korean president Kim Dae-jung had died, a delegation from North Korea also attended his funeral. On that occasion, talks were held with South Korean officials. In September 2009, the Kaesong rail and road crossings were reopened.\nThe road at Panmunjeom, which was known historically as \"Highway One\" in the South, was originally the only access point between the two countries on the Korean Peninsula. Passage is comparable to the strict movements that occurred at Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin at the height of the Cold War. Both North and South Korea's roads end in the Joint Security Area; neither highway meets because there is a concrete line that divides the entire site. People given the permission to cross this border must do so on foot before continuing their journey by road.\nIn 2007, on the east coast of Korea, the first train crossed the DMZ on the new Donghae Bukbu (Tonghae Pukpu) Line. The new rail crossing was built next to the road which took South Koreans to K\u016dmgangsan, a region that has significant cultural importance for all Koreans. More than one million civilian visitors crossed the DMZ until the route was closed after a 53-year-old South Korean tourist was shot in July 2008. The North Korean government did not want that both police forces investigate the shooting together, so the South Korean government stopped offering tours to the resort. Since then the resort, and the Donghae Bukbu Line have effectively been closed by the North.\nNature reserve.\nIn the past half century, the Korean DMZ has been a deadly place for humans, making habitation impossible. Only around the village of Panmunjeom and more recently the Dong Bukbu Line on Korea's east coast have there been regular incursions by people.\nThis natural isolation along the length of the DMZ has created an involuntary park which is now recognised as one of the most well-preserved areas of temperate habitat in the world.\nSeveral endangered animal and plant species now exist among the heavily fortified fences, landmines and listening posts. These include the extremely rare Red-crowned Crane (a staple of Asian art), and the White-naped crane as well as, potentially, the extremely rare Korean Tiger, Amur leopard and Asiatic black bear. Ecologists have identified some 2,900 plant species, 70 types of mammals and 320 kinds of birds within the narrow buffer zone. Additional surveys are now being conducted throughout the region.\nThe DMZ owes its varied biodiversity to its geography which crosses mountains, prairies, swamps, lakes and tidal marshes. Environmentalists hope that by the time reunification occurs, the former DMZ will be conserved as a wildlife refuge, with a well-developed set of objective and management plans vetted and in place. In 2005, CNN founder and media mogul, Ted Turner, on a visit to North Korea, said that he would financially support any plans to turn the DMZ into a peace park and a UN-protected World Heritage Site.\nEscapees from North Korea.\nSince trying to cross the DMZ is extremely dangerous, most North Korean defectors, or people who leave their home country to join an new country in a way the first country claims to be illegal, begin their escape through the border with China. This is because the Chinese-North Korean border is much less heavily guarded, although crossing the Chinese border is not without risks. However, there have been some escapees who have escaped by crossing the DMZ. Most of these people who successfully crossed the DMZ were North Korean soldiers who already had some knowledge of the area. Of the 33,000 North Korean defectors, only 21 North Korean soldiers crossed the DMZ and lived since the North Korean famine in 1996."}

He is widely known as \"Scott of the Antarctic\", the title of a 1948 movie.\nScott led two expeditions to the Antarctic regions: the Discovery Expedition, 1901\u201304, and the ill-fated Terra Nova Expedition, 1910\u201313.\nBefore his appointment to lead the Discovery Expedition, Scott had followed the conventional career of a naval officer in peacetime Victorian Britain, where opportunities for career advancement were keenly sought after by ambitious officers.\nIt was the chance for personal distinction that led Scott to apply for command of the \"Discovery\". His name became associated with the Antarctic, his field of work for the final twelve years of his life.\nTerra Nova Expedition 1910\u20131913.\nDuring this second venture, Scott led a party of five which reached the South Pole on 17 January 1912, only to find that Roald Amundsen's Norwegian expedition had got there first. On the return journey, Scott and his four comrades died from exhaustion, starvation and extreme cold. The tragic fate of his expedition is still remembered throughout the world.\nScott's leadership.\nAfter his death, Scott became a British hero. His reputation suffered from several books written later in the 20th century. Still later, Scott's record was reviewed more favourably. The main cause of the failure of the expedition is now said to be the exceptionally adverse weather at the end of the return from the pole.\nScott took ponies, motorised sleds and ordinary sleds, which he and his men pulled. He thought that the number of animals overworked and killed should be held as low as possible and considered his rival Roald Amundsen's approach as cruel. Amundsen, on the other hand, killed dog after dog to feed himself, the men and the rest of the dogs. He did not feel bad about it. The ponies helped travelling part of the way to the pole, but some of them were so stubborn that the expedition members, especially Lawrence Oates, lost much energy that was needed to get back from the pole. The motorised sleds (which worked well at the start) eventually froze up. The dogs, of which there 36, were left behind on the final attempt on the Pole.\nOne factor which has been re-discovered is that Scott gave the dog driver Meares written orders before leaving for the final attempt on the pole. The order was for dogs to be brought up towards the returning party. This order was supplemented by Scott asking Atkinson to make a similar attempt (Atkinson was one of those not chosen for the final attempt group). In the event, neither of these actions took place."}

The capital city is Chiba City.\nChiba is the sixth most populous prefecture, and 27th largest by land area.\nHistory.\nChiba Prefecture is made from the old province of Awa, Kazusa and Shim\u014dsa.\nGeography.\nChiba borders Ibaraki Prefecture to the north at the Tone River, Tokyo and Saitama Prefecture to the west at the Edo River, the Pacific Ocean to the east and Tokyo Bay around its southern boundary. Most of Chiba lies on the hilly B\u014ds\u014d Peninsula, a rice farming region: the east coast, known as the Ninety-Nine League Plain, is an especially productive area. The most populous zone, in the northwest of the prefecture, is part of the Kant\u014d region that extends into the urban agglomeration of Tokyo and Saitama. The Kuroshio Current flows near Chiba, which keeps it relatively warm in winter and cooler in summer than neighbouring Tokyo.\nCities.\nThere are thirty-six cities in Chiba Prefecture:\n\u2021 Scheduled to be dissolved after mergers.\nTowns and villages.\nThese are the towns and villages in each district:\nNational Parks.\nNational Parks are established in about 6% of the total land area of the prefecture.\nEconomy.\nChiba is one of Japan's biggest industrial areas. This is because it has a long coastline on Tokyo Bay. Chiba was chosen as the place for a major Kawasaki Steel factory in 1950. The prefectural government started a very big land reclamation program. They filled in the water areas to make big, new waterfront properties for factories, warehouses, and docks. Chemical production, petrochemical refining, and machine production are the three main industries in Chiba. They are 45% of Chiba's exports. In recent years, the government has given more than eighty industrial parks money. This is to bring development further inland.\nChiba also has the second-highest farming output in Japan. Only Hokkaid\u014d makes more farm products.Chiba makes more vegetables than Hokkaid\u014d. Seaweed is harvested in big amounts from Tokyo Bay.\nSports.\nTwo major Japanese sport events happen in Chiba each year: the International Chiba Ekiden and the Chiba International Cross Country.\nThese sports teams are based in Chiba.\nTransportation.\nMost Tokyo-bound visitors going to Tokyo arriving on international flights land in Narita International Airport, which is in Narita in the north of the prefecture, and connected to Tokyo by the East Japan Railway's \"Narita Express\" and the Keisei Electric Railway's \"Skyliner\".\nTourism.\nThe Tokyo Disney Resort is in Urayasu near the western border of the prefecture.\nThe Kamogawa Sea World is a large scale comprehensive marine leisure center/museum equivalent facility located between the Tojo coast and the national highway No. 128 in Kamogawa city.\nThere are several tourist sites on the B\u014ds\u014d Peninsula, such as Mount Nokogiri; Kuj\u016bkuri Beach; and Onjuku Beach.\nChiba is linked to Tokyo by several railway lines; the main ones are the Keiyo Line and Sobu Line. The Musashino Line connects Chiba to Saitama and northern Tokyo. Southern Chiba is connected to Kanagawa Prefecture by the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line bridge-tunnel.\nPrefectural symbols.\nChiba is famous for peanuts.

She is known as the \"Queen Of Latin Pop\". Estefan has won multiple Grammy Awards. The singer was a member of Miami Sound Machine in the 1980s. She is in the top 100 best selling music artists with over 100 million albums sold worldwide. Currently, she is the most successful crossover performer in Latin music.\nEarly life.\nShe was born Gloria Fajardo on September 1, 1957, in Havana, Cuba. As a toddler, Estefan fled Cuba with her family when Communist dictator Fidel Castro rose to power. Her father, Jose Manuel Fajardo, had been a Cuban soldier and bodyguard of former President Fulgencio Batista. Her maternal grandfather, Leonardo Garc\u00eda, immigrated to Cuba from Pola de Siero, Asturias, Spain. He married Gloria's maternal grandmother in Pola de Siero, Asturias, Spain. Her maternal grandmother is originally from Logro\u00f1o, Spain.\nAfter coming to the United States, Fajardo was recruited into the 2506 Brigade, a Central Intelligence Agency-funded band of Cuban refugees that was involved in the unsuccessful 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion. After President John F. Kennedy negotiated the release of the captured soldiers, Fajardo rejoined his family. He eventually joined the U.S. Army and served for two years in Vietnam.\nAs a child Estefan liked to write poetry, and though she took classical guitar lessons, she found them tedious. She had no idea that she would some day become a popular music star, but music played a very important role for her as a teenager.\nAfter her father's return from Vietnam, he was diagnosed as having multiple sclerosis, possibly as a result of having been exposed to the herbicide Agent Orange while serving in the army. Estefan's mother, who had been a teacher in Cuba, worked to support the family during the day and attended school at night. Young Gloria was left to take care of her father and younger sister. She had little social life, and because she felt the weight of such responsibilities she turned to music as a release.\n\"When my father was ill, music was my escape,\" Estefan told Washington Post reporter Richard Harrington. \"I would lock myself up in my room for hours and just sing. I wouldn't cry\u2014I refused to cry...Music was the only way I had to just let go, so I sang for fun and for emotional catharsis.\"\nEstefan said in an interview, that she is not affiliated with any political party.\nDiscography.\nAlbums discography.\nStudio albums"}

CP is usually caused by damage done to the brain during early childhood. It is called \"cerebral palsy\" because the part of the brain that is damaged is the cerebrum. CP cannot be cured. It is treated with therapies. \nCP was first identified by an English surgeon called William Little in 1860.\nThere are several types of cerebral palsy. The most common type is spastic cerebral palsy. \nToday, 1 in every 400 children in the UK has cerebral palsy. \nSymptoms.\nPeople with CP often have trouble standing or walking. They may also be partly paralysed. \nWhile the main problem of cerebral palsy is problems with moving, difficulties with having thoughts, learning, feeling, talking and behaviour often come with cerebral palsy.\nOf children with cerebral palsy, 3 out of 4 children have pain, 1 out of 2 have intellectual disability, 1 out of 3 children cannot walk, 1 in 3 have a hip displacement, 1 in 4 cannot talk, 1 out of 4 children have epilepsy, 1 in 4 have behaviour disorders, 1 out of 4 children have trouble controlling their bladder, 1 in 5 have trouble with sleep (sleeping too much or not enough), 1 out of 5 children dribble, 1 out of 10 are blind, 1 out of 15 need to be fed through a tube, and 1 in 25 are deaf.\nMost people with cerebral palsy live for as long as people without CP. 5-10% of children with CP die before growing up.\nTreatment.\nOver time, the way to take care of cerebral palsy has changed from fixing a person's physical problems such as spasticity in one leg or arm. Now, the way to take care of cerebral palsy is about making therapies for the body part of a larger purpose of making the person's quality of life better, helping them have choice and make their own decisions about looking after themselves, and helping them be part of society. Much of children's therapy is about helping them walk better. Roughly 60% of people with CP are able to walk by themselves or with mobility aids when they become grown up.\nMobility aids may help people with CP move around more easily."}
