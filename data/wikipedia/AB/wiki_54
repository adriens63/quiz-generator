He was a juvenile offender sentenced to death at age 16 by the state of Louisiana in 1945. He was found guilty for the murder of Andrew Thomas, a Cajun pharmacy owner in St. Martinville who had once employed Francis. Francis was 17 when he survived the first attempt to execute him because the chair did not work correctly. He tried to appeal his case to the US Supreme Court, but the Supreme Court rejected it. He was executed in 1947 at age 18.\nArrest and trial.\nIn 1944, Andrew Thomas, a pharmacist in St. Martinville, Louisiana, was shot and killed. His murder was unsolved for nine months. However, in August 1945, Willie Francis was arrested in Texas because he was a suspect for an unrelated crime. Police said that he was carrying Thomas' wallet in his pocket, but no evidence of this was given during the trial. \nEven though he wrote two confessions, Francis said he was not guilty. During his trial, the court-chosen defense attorneys had no objections, called no witnesses, and put up no defense. Francis' confessions were not questioned by the defense, although he had no counsel at the time. Two days after the trial began, Francis was quickly convicted of murder. He was sentenced to death by twelve jurors and the judge, even though Francis was 15 years old at the time of the crime.\nExecution attempt, appeal, and second execution.\nOn May 3, 1946, Francis survived an attempt at execution by the electric chair. Witnesses said they heard Francis scream from behind the leather hood, \"Take it off! Take it off! Let me breathe goddammit!\" as the electricity was being used. The electric chair, known as \"Gruesome Gertie,\" was found to have been set up incorrectly by a drunk prison guard and inmate from the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola. The sheriff, E.L. Resweber, later said, \"This boy really got a shock when they turned that machine on.\"\nAfter the failed execution, a young lawyer named Bertrand DeBlanc, decided to take Francis' case. He believed it was cruel and unusual punishment, as prohibited in the Constitution, to have him be executed again. DeBlanc took Francis' case to the Supreme Court in \"Francis v. Resweber\", 329 U.S. 459 (1947). He cited many violations of his Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. These included violations of equal protection, double jeopardy, and cruel and unusual punishment.\nThe US Supreme Court rejected the appeal. Willie Francis was returned to the electric chair on May 9, 1947. He was pronounced dead in the chair at 12:10 p.m. (CST)."}

He previously played for the New York Mets, Cleveland Indians, Los Angeles Angels, Chicago Cubs, and Toronto Blue Jays.\nIt was in December of 2017 he signed a 2-year contract with the Astros.\nNew York Mets.\nSmith first began his career with Brooklyn (A) of the New York\u2013Penn League by allowing two runs, one earned, in one inning of work against the Staten Island Yankees on June 21. He was named one of the top 20 prospects in the New York\u2013Penn League by \"Baseball America\". When Duaner S\u00e1nchez was hurt during a taxi cab incident in 2006, Mets general manager Omar Minaya considered recalling Smith to the Majors. But ultimately, the Mets traded for Roberto Hern\u00e1ndez and \u00d3liver P\u00e9rez to give Smith more time in the minors. On March 24, 2007, after a strong spring training, it was announced Smith would be on the Mets' 25-man roster. On April 1, 2007, Smith made his major league debut. He struck out one (Preston Wilson) and walked one (Albert Pujols). He also gave up a single to David Eckstein. Smith earned his first major league win on April 24, 2007 after coming on in relief in the 12th inning. Smith enjoyed much success in the beginning of 2007, but began to tire and was sent down to the minors at mid year. Smith was with the Mets for all of the 2008 season, enjoying varied success. He went 6\u20133 in 63.3 innings with an ERA of 3.55.\nCleveland Indians.\nOn December 10, 2008, Smith was traded by the Mets to the Cleveland Indians as part of a twelve-player, three-team deal. On January 18, 2013, the Cleveland Indians announced they had avoided arbitration with Smith, signing him to a one-year contract worth $3.15 million.\nSmith became a free agent following the 2013 season, but expressed interest in remaining with the Tribe.\nLos Angeles Angels of Anaheim / Los Angeles Angels.\nOn November 24, 2013, Smith reportedly agreed to a three-year contract for $15 million with the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, pending the completion of a physical. On November 27, 2013, the Angels confirmed that the team and Smith agreed to the terms. On April 25, 2014, Smith was named the Angels' new closer after multiple struggles by former closer Ernesto Frieri. After the Angels traded for San Diego Padres' All-Star closer Huston Street on July 18, 2014, Smith was moved to an eighth-inning setup role. Smith finished with 15 saves in 76 games to the tune of a 1.81 ERA.\nSmith's numbers in 2015 went up as his ERA and WHIP from the previous season. He played uptil June 2016, when he had a hamstring injury.\nChicago Cubs.\nOn August 1, 2016, the Angels traded Smith to the Chicago Cubs for prospect Jesus Castillo. In 16 more appearances with the Cubs to finish 2016, Smith had a 1-1 record and a 2.51 ERA. Overall in 2016, combined with both teams he played for, Smith made 54 total appearances with a 1-4 record and a 3.82 ERA. Smith was a member of the Cubs' 2016 World Series championship team, but did not make any postseason appearances.\nToronto Blue Jays.\nOn February 9, 2017, Smith signed a one-year, $3 million contract with the Toronto Blue Jays. Smith became the Blue Jays setup man early in the season, after Jason Grilli struggled in the role and Joe Biagini was moved to the starting rotation. He was placed on the 10-day disabled list on June 19 with shoulder inflammation. In 38 games, he was 3-0 with a 3.28 ERA in 35 2\u20443 innings.\nBack to the Cleveland Indians.\nOn July 31, 2017, the Blue Jays traded Smith to the Cleveland Indians for Thomas Pannone and Samad Taylor. In 18 1\u20443 innings, he had an ERA of 3.44 for the Indians.\nHouston Astros.\nOn December 13, 2017, Smith signed a two-year contract with the Houston Astros worth $15 million. In his first season in Houston, Smith appeared in 56 games, recording a record of 5-1 in 45 2\u20443 innings with a 3.74 ERA. On December 13 while working out, Smith suffered a ruptured left Achilles tendon. He underwent surgery for it on December 20.\nIn 2019 he was 1-0 with a 1.80 ERA in 28 relief appearances in which he pitched 25.0 innings.\nOn December 16, 2019, Smith resigned with the Astros on a two-year contract worth $8 million."}

He is an anthropomorphic chili dog. Almost everybody wants to eat the Delicious One due to him being a hot dog; his famous trademark is when he runs off screaming.\nHistory.\nIn 1997, Creative Director Courtney Betley and Senior Art Director Julia Cadar set out to create the World's Most Wanted Wiener for Wienerschnitzel, with TDO coming to mind. The character of The Delicious One (or TDO) began as a Claymation character, created and voiced\u00a0by Luke Thomas and\u00a0developed by Loose Moose in London (who was beginning work in the United States)\u00a0in 1999. This early\u00a0version of TDO had misread every situation; somewhat naive, TDO thought everyone always wanted him around due to his delightful personality and charm, only to quickly discover in almost every situation that they wanted to him for more nefarious reasons (i.e. they wanted to eat him). He was constantly on the run, trying to escape the clutches of hungry people.\nShortly after TDO's fame, Wienerschnitzel released\u00a0antennas with TDO holding a small, yellow box with a scared expression. There are alternate versions of this antenna (one with TDO wearing an Uncle Sam hat). TDO was last featured in the advertisements in 2008.\nIn 2011, Wienerschnitzel released\u00a0antennas called the Golden Wienie.\nIn January 2014, following\u00a0public demand,\u00a0Wienerschnitzel re-introduced TDO\u00a0in a 2D-animated version, with Justin Roiland\u00a0taking over from\u00a0Luke Thomas. TDO has only been in this animated form or as a costume. Some Wienerschnitzel fans have made petitions demanding his return in CGI capacity and Thomas' reprisal."}

It was founded in 1950 by the government of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic. The university has 9 faculties and 54 departments, around 1,100 faculty members, including 70 professors and around 6,500 students.\nHistory.\nOn November 14, 1920, the Soviet government decided that the previous technical school \"Baku Polytechnicum\" would be closed and replaced by the \"Baku Polytechnic Institute\". The new school focused on training engineers in such sectors as agriculture, civil engineering, electromechanics, economics, and petroleum. In 1923, the school changed its name to the \"Azerbaijan Polytechnic Institute\". In March 1929 the Communist Party of Azerbaijan decided that the school would be divided into three independent schools covering agriculture, economy, and petroleum.\nHowever, the growing demands of engineers in other areas outside of petroleum led to the expansion of the school curriculum, and the school again changed its name in 1934, this time to the \"Azerbaijan Industrial Institute (AzSI)\", since it was combined with civil engineering. The Second World War put a lot of pressure on the Soviet Union, and schools like AzPI tried to remain open.\nIn 1950, the government established a separate \"Azerbaijan Polytechnic Institute (AzPI)\" and transferred non-petrochemical curricula to a new school so that AzSI could focus on the petroleum industry. (AzSI continued to eventually become the \"Azerbaijan State Oil Academy\".) In 1970, the branch of AzPI was established in Ganja.\nIn 1993, two years after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and independence of Azerbaijan, AzPI changed its status and became the Azerbaijan Technical University."}

A frightening set of tail spikes completed this plant-eater's armour. \nWith one deadly swing of its spiked tail Tuojiangosaurus could hurt the belly of an attacking predator. \nThe Chinese province where Tuojiangosaurus was found is home to the Zigong Dinosaur Park, the first dinosaur museum in Asia."}

It lies about north of the arctic circle, and over north of Krasnoyarsk. There are many ore deposits in the region, especially nickel and copper. Mining ore is always linked to heavy pollution of the environment. Norilsk was founded in 1935 as a site of industry, to be able to mine the ore. In 1939, the decision was taken to also build a city. Norilsk got the statute of a city in 1953.\nNorilsk is the northernmost city with more than 100.000 inhabitants. It is the second largest city within the arctic circle, only Murmansk is larger. Norilsk and Yakutsk are the only large cities built in the continuous permafrost zone. This means that even in summer, the ground remains frozen.\nThe nickel deposits of Norilsk-Talnakh are the largest-known nickel-copper-palladium deposits in the world. The smelting of the nickel ore is directly responsible for severe pollution, which generally comes in the form of acid rain and smog. By some estimates, one percent of global sulfur dioxide emission comes from Norilsk's nickel mines.\nNorilsk is a closed city. This means that a special permit is needed to be able to travel to Norilsk. This permit is issued both by the Russian government, and the local mining comany. Foreigners usually do not get this permit.\nReligion.\nMost people in Norilsk are Christian: They belong to the Russian Orthodox Church. There is a Russian Orthodox Cathedral, and several churches of the Ukranian Orthodox Church. In 1998, a mosque was built for the local Tatar community: It is considered to be the northernmost Muslim prayer house in the world.\nTransportation.\nNorilsk can only be reached by airplane, or by boat.There is a railway line, which connects the city to Dudinka, on the river Yenisei. The airport lies about west of the ciry. Dudinka is about to the west. It is a large port on the river Yenisei. While at first, there was only the railway, a road to Dudinka has been built. The raiway now only handles freight.\nMay 2020 incident.\nOn 29 May 2020 a fuel reservoir collapsed, flooding the nearby Ambarnaya River with 20,000 tonnes of diesel fuel. The reservoir was the property of the local mining company, a Nornickel subsidiary, NTEK. Russian president Vladimir Putin declared a state of emergency. The fuel was a reserve used as a backup for the main gas supply to a power plant. The storage tank was built on permafrost. According to a statement by the company, the permafrost could possibly have melted and become unstable because of climate change. An area of 350 square kilometres (135 square miles) has been contaminated. It will be difficult to clean this because there are no roads and the river is too shallow for boats and barges. Oleg Mitvol estimates that the clean-up will cost about 100 billion rubles (1.5 billion US$) and take 5\u201310 years."}

During Fiscal Year 2018, 396,448 people were in ICE custody: 242,778 of them were detained by CBP and 153,670 by ICE. A daily average of 42,188 immigrants (40,075 adult and 2,113 in families) were held by ICE in that year. More than twelve thousand immigrant children are in buildings that the Office of Refugee Resettlement's program for Unaccompanied Alien Children controls.

The modern form of Bon has its roots in the late 900s and 1000s CE, when the first Bon monasteries were started in Tibet. There are many teachings in Bon that are similar to Buddhist teachings, and so people who study Bon disagree whether it should be called a kind of Buddhism or not. Followers of Bon believe that it was founded by a teacher called Tonpa Shenrab who lived many years ago in a land called Tazig. Some people think that Tazig refers to Persia, Central Asia, or the area around Mount Kailash in western Tibet. According to Tibetans, Bon was popular in Tibet before Buddhism became the main religion of Tibet, but some non-Tibetans like Per Kv\u0153rne say there isn't much connection between religion in Tibet before Buddhism and the living tradition of Bon. After the Chinese army sent troops to Tibet in 1959, some followers of Bon were forced to leave Tibet and many Bon monasteries and temples were shut down. Many of the followers of Bon who left Tibet started Bon centers in cities around the world. Today, most people who believe in Bon are ethnic Tibetans, but a small number of non-Tibetans have started to believe in Bon too. \nThe \"yungdrung\", or left-facing swastika, is a sacred symbol in Bon, and the living tradition of Bon is sometimes called Yungdrung Bon, meaning \"eternal Bon\" in Tibetan. The \"yungdrung\", like the vajra in Tibetan Buddhism, represents eternity because it is said that the \"yungdrung\" cannot be destroyed and lasts forever. \nTibetan Buddhists used to write many bad things about Bon, arguing that Bon had stolen most of its teachings from Buddhism, a view that people studying Bon from Europe and North America sometimes agreed with. The fourteenth Dalai Lama, who is seen as a religious leader by most Tibetans, said that Bon is as much part of Tibetan religion as Buddhism, encouraging people to treat Bon with respect. \nFollowers of Bon are called Bonpos. Bonpos believe in many gods. These gods include the creator god, Sangpo Bumtri, the god of compassion Shenlha \u00d6kar, the goddess of compassion Sherab Chamma, and the founder of Bon Tonpa Shenrab.

Much like with a true vacuum, a false vacuum exists where the energy is minimal. In the case of a true vacuum, this is at a global minimum of the energy function. With a false vaccum, the energy function is only at a local minimum. As is illustrated in the figure, there is a \"peak\" between the local minimum and the global minimum of the energy function. \nThe process by which the system changes its energy state is called bubble nucleation: Somewhere in the universe, a bubble will appear, with a lower energy state inside the bubble. This bubble will then spread and change the energy state of its surroundings.\nAll energy fields are thought to be in a true vacuum state except one, the Higgs field. The Higgs field is thought to be Metastable, where it is only it its local minimum energy and is not in a true vacuum state yet. \nVacuum decay is a theory that, should the Higgs field release its potential energy, it will create a cascade effect where more energy is released over and over again, creating a sphere that destroys everything it interacts with.\nThis would be completely undetectable, and some may exist already (though very unlikely. Close to impossible) Even so, they might never reach Earth due to the expansion of the universe. Current calculations suggest that if this occurs, it will be trillons of years. By that point, the universe will be going through Heat Death."}

The fire stopped after 20 minutes but 146 workers died.\nThe company's owners, Max Blanck and Isaac Harris, who survived the fire by going to the building's roof when the fire started, were indicted on charges of first- and second-degree manslaughter in mid-April; the pair's trial began on December 4, 1911. Max Steuer, counsel for the defendants, managed to destroy the credibility of one of the survivors, Kate Alterman, by asking her to repeat her testimony a number of times, which she did without altering key phrases. Steuer argued to the jury that Alterman and possibly other witnesses had memorized their statements, and might even have been told what to say by the prosecutors. The prosecution charged that the owners knew the exit doors were locked at the time in question. The investigation found that the locks were intended to be locked during working hours based on the findings from the fire, but the defense stressed that the prosecution failed to prove that the owners knew that. The jury acquitted the two men of first- and second-degree manslaughter, but they were found liable of wrongful death during a subsequent civil suit in 1913 in which plaintiffs were awarded compensation in the amount of $75 per deceased victim. The insurance company paid Blanck and Harris about $60,000 more than the reported losses, or about $400 per casualty.In 1913, Blanck was once again arrested for locking the door in his factory during working hours. He was fined $20 which was the minimum amount the fine could be.\nBecause of the lax labor laws at the time, this tragedy paved the way for the rise of factory workers safety protections and the formation of workers Unions such as the International Ladies Garment Union."}

It was also the first tropical cyclone to exist in all the three North Pacific tropical cyclone basins since Dora in 1999. Genevieve formed from a tropical wave well to the south-east of Hawaii on July 25, but weakened quickly into a remnant low due to high wind shear on July 28. The system briefly reformed on July to the south of Hawaii before dissipating once again on July 31. \nSeveral days later, on August 2, Genevieve regenerated. Owing to better conditions for intensification, Genevieve began to rapidly intensify, reaching hurricane strength on August 6 and major hurricane strength on August 7 shortly before crossing the International Date Line into the Western Pacific basin, where Genevieve was reclassified as a typhoon by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA).\nAfter reaching peak intensity as a Category 5 typhoon on August 7 and 8 to the west-southwest , Genevieve began to weaken as conditions worsened. The storm rapidly weakened to severe tropical storm strength on August 10. On August 12, the JMA downgraded Genevieve to a tropical depression, and Genevieve dissipated on August 14.\nMeteorological history.\nOrigin and regeneration.\nThe National Hurricane Center (NHC) began to track a tropical wave associated with a few showers and thunderstorms, moving westward off the coast of northern Central America on July\u00a017. Four days later, thunderstorm activity became stronger; by July\u00a022, the area of low pressure became better organized. On July\u00a023, the NHC noted that the system could become a tropical depression within the next two days; however, they also noted that wind shear could increase within a couple of days. After an ASCAT pass and an increase in convection, the NHC upgraded the storm to Tropical Storm Genevieve on July\u00a025. A few hours later, the system attained its initial peak strength of 45\u00a0mph (75\u00a0km/h).\nShortly afterwards, increased wind shear took its toll on the system, causing Genevieve to lose its organization as it continued westward, under the influence of a subtropical ridge and the Intertropical Convergence Zone. After the low-level circulation center was exposed and became separated from the deep convection, the NHC downgraded Genevieve to a tropical depression on July\u00a026. Although deep convection increased near the center early on the next day, Genevieve continued to fight westerly shear when crossing 140\u00b0W, moving into the waters monitored by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC). Due to the lack of deep convection, the CPHC indicated that Genevieve had become a post-tropical remnant low early on July\u00a028, as only a low-level cloud swirl remained. However, the CPHC noted the possibility of re-development since shear was forecast to decrease.\nRoughly 36 hours later, the remnants of Genevieve regenerated into a tropical depression to the southeast of the main Hawaiian Islands. The system briefly became better organized on July\u00a030, prompting the CPHC to forecast the storm would re-intensify into a tropical storm. However, by the end of the day, the low-level circulation center had become displaced to the east of the deep convection due to increased southeasterly shear and infiltration of dry air. By 21:00\u00a0UTC July\u00a031, the CPHC reported that Genevieve had once again weakened into a remnant low, as only an isolated area of deep convection remained west of the center.\nIntensification and peak intensity.\nThe remnants of Genevieve continued to travel in a generally westward direction, moving into an environment more conducive for tropical development, and on the afternoon of August\u00a02, Genevieve regenerated into a tropical depression, as the storm reacquired deep convection and its outflow improved. By 21:00\u00a0UTC the same day, Genevieve reacquired tropical storm intensity, continuing to travel westward around the subtropical ridge to its north, but only six hours later, the CPHC downgraded Genevieve into a tropical depression. Deep convection near the center increased and decreased several times, but Genevieve failed to re-intensify. After moving south-southwest, Genevieve turned west-northwest on August\u00a04 as it continued to track around the ridge to its north.\nDespite moderate wind shear, convection soon wrapped around the southeastern side of the low-level circulation. By 21:00\u00a0UTC on August 5, the CPHC upgraded the system to a tropical storm, despite continued wind shear. Wind shear quickly decreased, triggering a period of rapid intensification. By the afternoon of August 6, Genevieve intensified to a low-end Category\u00a01 hurricane; the system also developed a central dense overcast and well-organized banding around the newly-developed eye. Passing over very warm ocean temperatures, Genevieve rapidly intensified accelerated that evening. Based on advanced Dvorak technique estimates of as well as the presence of a very well-defined eye surrounded by very cold cloud tops, the CPHC upgraded the hurricane into Category\u00a04 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale early on the next day.\nGenevieve crossed the International Date Line at 06:00 UTC on August 7, entering the area of responsibility of the RSMC Tokyo operated by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). The JMA recognized Genevieve as a typhoon with ten-minute maximum sustained winds at 115\u00a0mph (185\u00a0km/h). The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also upgraded Genevieve to a super typhoon. Only six hours later, the JTWC reported that Genevieve had reached Category\u00a05 status with one-minute sustained winds at 160\u00a0mph (260\u00a0km/h), with a microwave imagery revealing a diameter eyewall with a convective band over the south quadrant. As Genevieve continued to remain in a favorable environment with radial outflow and low vertical wind shear, the JMA indicated that the typhoon about 760\u00a0mi (1220\u00a0km) east-southeast of Wake Island had reached its peak intensity late on August 7, with ten-minute maximum sustained winds at 125\u00a0mph (205\u00a0km/h).\nWeakening and dissipation.\nDuring the morning of August 8, Genevieve started to track northward along the western edge of a subtropical ridge to the east and northeast.That noon, more fragmented deep convective banding revealed that Genevieve had begun a weakening trend. As the result, the JTWC downgraded Genevieve to a typhoon late on the same day, as convection surrounding the system warmed. Early on August 9, Genevieve accelerated north-northeastward, and it began to encounter increasing vertical wind shear of 35\u00a0mph (55\u00a0km/h) with subsidence along the western side and weakening outflow into the TUTT cell. The eye of the typhoon became cloud-filled, while the deepest convection around the core was also became warmer. The system began to track north-northwestward in the afternoon, when the cold dense overcast has decreased in size and become less symmetric.\nGenevieve reformed a eye with more symmetric and organized convection for short time early on August 10, but the eye disappeared very soon as the system elongated further. Upper-level analysis indicated a complex environment\u2014 an anticyclone located to the southeast, a TUTT cell to the west, and a second anticyclone to the north. The TUTT cell and the first anticyclone caused strong upper-level southwestern flow and moderate vertical wind shear over the system, but the issues were offset by the quick speed of the typhoon. Tracking northwestward, Genevieve crossed 30\u00b0N at noon and began to encounter cold sea surface temperatures less than 79\u00a0\u00b0F (26\u00a0\u00b0C) which do not support tropical cyclones. At the same time, a trough expanded the region of subsidence, isolating the core from the tropical moisture along the equatorward periphery. Later, deep convection along the tightly-wrapped low-level circulation center of the typhoon diminished fast as dry air surrounded the system.\nLate on August 10, the JMA downgraded Genevieve to a severe tropical storm about 670\u00a0mi (1,080\u00a0km) west-northwest of Midway Atoll, and the JTWC downgraded it to a tropical storm early on the next day. Dry air, cool ocean temperatures, and weakening link to tropical moisture caused deep convection to nearly completely dissipate. This process was hastened by the disintegration of the TUTT cell which had helped to increase equatorward outflow. Under the combination of many unfavorable\nenvironmental factors, Genevieve weakened to a tropical storm at noon according to the JMA as it started to move west-northwestward and slowed down. As convection had largely dissipated, the JTWC downgraded Genevieve to a tropical depression and stopped warnings late on the same day.\nAfter the JMA downgraded Genevieve to a tropical depression at 06:00\u00a0UTC on August 12, the system drifted westward and then northwestward very slowly until it accelerated northeastward late on August 13. The JMA reported that Genevieve had dissipated as a tropical depression before noon on August 14; however, the Ocean Prediction Center indicated that the remnants of Genevieve crossed the International Date Line and entered the Central North Pacific Ocean again late on the same day. They were eventually absorbed by another extratropical cyclone before noon on August 15."}

The game has some new features, but overall \"BioShock 2\" is very similar to the first game. It takes place 8 years after \"BioShock\". In \"BioShock 2\", the player plays as a Big Daddy, a major enemy from the first game, called Subject Delta. Subject Delta is an early version of the Big Daddy, the Alpha Series.\nStory.\nThe game begins in 1958, two years before the events of \"BioShock.\" At this time, Rapture has not yet fallen into disorder. Subject Delta is responsible for protecting one specific Little Sister (little girls whose job is to collect ADAM, a liquid that gives people powers) named Eleanor. Eleanor is attacked by Splicers (humans that are addicted to ADAM), but Subject Delta kills the Splicers and tries to rescue Eleanor. However, it turned out that her mother, Sofia Lamb, hired the Splicers to take back Eleanor. She then hypnotizes Subject Delta to kill himself.\nTen years, later, eight years after the events of \"BioShock\", Subject Delta mysteriously comes back to life. Since both Andrew Ryan and Frank Fontaine are both dead, Sofia Lamb took over Rapture. Instead of being a society based on objectivism, a philosophy that believes people should only do things based their own self-interest, Rapture is now a collectivist society, or a society where people can only do things that help others. Sofia Lamb does experiments to figure out how to turn her now-teenage daughter, Eleanor, and everyone else in Rapture into the perfect humans. This is so that Rapture can become the perfect society, since Sofia believed a perfect society was not possible unless its people were also perfect. Subject Delta wants to rescue Eleanor before Sofia finishes her experiments.\nAlong the way, Subject Delta gets the help of a businessman named Augustus Sinclair to help find Eleanor.\nGameplay.\nWhile the gameplay is very similar to that of \"BioShock\", some new features were added to the sequel. First, the player can use both plasmids (powers gotten from ADAM) and weapons at the same time. In addition, the player has a new weapon called the Hack Tool. This allows the player to hack machines from faraway by shooting Hack Darts at it. Instead of playing a Pipe Dream-like minigame every time the player hacks a machine, the player plays a timing-based minigame that happens as the game is still happening. The player can also use the Hack Tool to drop Mini-turrets. Instead of the wrench, the player's main melee weapon is the Drill. The Drill has a powerful drilling attack that can drain an enemy's health very quickly, but this attack will stop if the player runs out of Drill Fuel. The Drill also has a weaker melee attack that does not use Drill Fuel. \nAlso, if the player chooses to adopt the Little Sisters rather than harvest them, then the player will need to get ADAM by protecting the Little Sisters when they get ADAM from dead Splicers. However, the player can take the time to get resources and set up traps because the player can choose the time when the Little Sister gets ADAM. After the player rescues all the little sisters in a level, the player will then fight a Big Sister, a Little Sister who grew into an adult. Big Sisters are difficult to kill because they have a lot of health, they can kill the player quickly, and they can use plasmids to fight the player. However, the player will get a lot of ADAM if they kill the Big Sister."}

Some people called it a country. It was in Seattle, which is a big city in Washington. It was 6 city blocks in size. A city block is a group of buildings with a street next to it. It started on June 8, 2020 because all police left the area.\nThey wanted the United States of America to lower costs of rent, destroy expensive buildings near cheap buildings, make medicine and hospitals free, make all people who have been seen destroying things while in groups be let out of jail, and to lay off all police officers. Lay off means to make someone stop working.\nSome people liked the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. Some people did not like the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. Donald Trump and Ted Cruz did not like the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. The mayor of Seattle Jenny Durkan thinks that it is party, not a real country.\nSome people who live in Seattle are suing the city because they say they should move people out of the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone.\nBackground.\nCapitol Hill is a place in Seattle. Sometimes, it has lots of people who gathered to talk about problems.\nOn May 29, 2020, many people gathered to talk about the killing of George Floyd. Some people fought police and soldiers, but nobody died. Some people stood around a building with police inside. Police used pepper spray to get the people to go away, but it did not work. Then, police covered the windows in the building with wood. Then, police went away and did not lock the doors in the building. The people who stood around the building then said that the area with and near the building was a new country, and was not in the United States of America anymore.\nGeography.\nNear the middle of the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone is a building that was used by police. There are many kitchens on the street in the area, as well as a park. The park has a large screen that plays movies outside.\nThere are walls on the streets that keep people from entering without permission, near the edges of the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. There is also lots of paint put on walls.\nThere are homes in the area. There are also restaurants and small businesses.\nGovernment.\nThere were no paid police officers in the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. There were many people who had guns in the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. No one outside of the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone knows who the leaders in their government were. Some people think their leader was a singer named Raz Simone. Raz Simone likes to sing rap. Some people think their leader was Nikkita Oliver. Nikkita Oliver wants to be the mayor of Seattle, but lost the election. The leader puts things that they want people to do on paper, and then put the paper on walls.\nServices.\nTents were built for people to live in. Water, food, and soap was given to people for free. The United States Government gave toilets to the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone and cleaned up their trash. The United States Government said that it would have put out any fires that started in the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone.\nThe Government of the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone made shields that can be used to fight, and gave them to it's citizens.\nProblems.\nThe Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone did not allow police officers from Seattle to come into the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. Seattle has said that it would not try to put police into the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, unless someone has killed someone else, or is about to.\nShootings.\nOn June 7, 2020, a man drove his car into the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. Some people say he tried to run into people to hurt them. A person that the man did not know tried to get into his car. The person driving the car shot the person that tried to get into the car, but they did not die.\nOn June 20, 2020, two men were shot. One of them was Horace Anderson, and he was 19 years old. He died because he was shot. The other man was named DeJuan Young, who was 33 years old, but he did not die. DeJuan Young says that he was shot because he was black. When police heard gunshots, they tried to come into the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, but the protesters did not want them to. The people in the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone pushed police out of the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone.\nOn June 21, 2020, a man that was 17 years old was shot in his arm. He did not die. Police who solve crimes tried to ask him why he was shot, but he did not want to talk to them.\nOn June 23, 2020, a man that was about 30 years old was shot. He was shot in the morning, around 5 a.m.. He did not die.\nSexual assault.\nOn June 18, 2020, a man sexually assaulted a woman. The woman was deaf, and could not talk. The man pretended to give her some food. The woman walked to him to get the food, but the man grabbed her. He then started to take off her clothes, and started touching her body. A person who is able to cure injuries saw this happening, and stopped the man. The police found the man later, and he was put in jail.\nReporters.\nThe government of the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone said that people who work for Fox News are not allowed into the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. Sometimes reporters from Fox News went into the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. If they were found by people in the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, they would be asked to leave, or be attacked.\nShut Down.\nDonald Trump said that the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone is not a country. On June 22, 2020, the City of Seattle said that the people in the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone had to leave. People in the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone have said that they are a country that is not in the United States of America, but the United States of America says that they are not, and that if they keep saying this, police will arrest them.\nThis is because the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone declared independence. Sometimes when people declare independence, they start a civil war. Civil wars happen whenever people declare independence, and start fighting. The United States does not want a civil war to happen, but they do want to get rid of the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone.\nOn June 24, 2020, someone who said they are in the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone said that a lot of people left, and that no one thinks it is a country anymore. Other people say that nobody left, and that people still say it a country. Omari Salisbury is a journalist. He says that the person who said that a lot of people left is lying.\nA United States Postal Service Truck was seen in the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. This means that a mailman who works for the United States of America was in the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. They usually do not work outside of the United States. "}

The city was built at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean so that no government could find it. Rapture is a city based on the ideas of objectivism, the philosophy that believes everything people do should be based on logic (rather than emotion) and for their own self-interest. \nRapture was built by a man named Andrew Ryan. Andrew Ryan believed that the governments and religions above the ocean wanted to take away the wealth from people who worked hard for it and to give it to so-called \"parasites\", people who take away things from people who worked for it. He wanted Rapture to be a place where people could become anything or do anything they wanted if they worked hard for it, a place where science could develop quickly because religions could not enforce morality to slow down or stop scientific research, a place where artists could make any art they wanted because governments could not censor their ideas, a place where rich and powerful people would not be forced to give anything to poor and powerless people.\nDue to not having laws that slowed down or stopped scientific research, many intelligent scientists from above the ocean moved to Rapture and made many new discoveries. This allowed Rapture to develop very quickly. The most important discovery is the discovery of ADAM. ADAM is a liquid that comes from sea slugs that can rewrite a person's genetic code. This allows people to have special powers like shooting lighting bolts, shooting fire, and lifting objects without touching them. However, ADAM was also extremely addictive, and if users of ADAM went through long periods of time without it, they would suffer serious health problems and go insane. People who got withdrawals from ADAM would turn into Splicers. Unfortunately, many people in Rapture also became addicted to ADAM, and ADAM became something everyone in Rapture wanted and needed. Since ADAM had such a high demand and low supply, young girls called Little Sisters were raised to collect ADAM from dead Splicers. As Splicers would try to kill Little Sisters to take the ADAM they collected, Big Daddies were created to protect the Little Sisters. Big Daddies would kill anyone who attacked a Little Sister.\nHowever, when the wealth gap between the rich and poor people of Rapture became too wide, Frank Fontaine, also known as Atlas, sold ADAM and made charities to help the poor people of Rapture. Also, since the economy of Rapture is based on laissez-faire captalism (an economy where governments make as little changes to the economy as possible), businesses could sell ADAM to people without any laws stopping it. Since Atlas was giving help and selling ADAM to the poor people of Rapture, they would become loyal to him. Since Atlas was gaining power and tried to control Rapture, Ryan betrayed the values he built Rapture on and became a dictator. Eventually, a civil war in Rapture was fought between people who supported Ryan and people who supported Atlas. This made Rapture a very dangerous place. Many people left Rapture to go back to the surface world. Most of the people who stayed in Rapture became Splicers."}

Estimates for the composition of its earliest core vary widely. The early 20th-century Indian scholar Dikshitar dated the Brahmanda to 4th-century BCE. Most later scholarship places this text to be from centuries later, in the 4th- to 6th-century BCE. The text is generally assumed, states Ludo Rocher, to have achieved its current structure about 1000 CE.\nThe text was often changed after the 10th-century, and new sections probably replaced older ones. The 13th-century Yadava dynasty scholar Hemadri quoted large parts of the then existing \"Brahmanda Purana\", but these parts are not found in currently surviving versions of the same text. This suggests that the 13th-century version of this Purana was different in many respects than extant manuscripts.\nThe \"Adhyatma-ramayana\", the most important embedded set of chapters in the extant versions of the Purana, is considered to have been composed centuries later, possibly in the 15th-century, and is attributed to Ramananda \u2013 the Advaita scholar and the founder of the Ramanandi Sampradaya, the largest monastic group in Hinduism and in Asia in modern times. The \"Adhyatma-ramayana\" thus was added to this Purana later, and it is an important document to the Rama-related tradition within Hinduism.\nA Javanese Brahmanda palm-leaf manuscript was discovered in Indonesia in the mid-19th century by colonial-era Dutch scholars, along with other Puranas. The Sanskrit originals of these are either lost or yet to be discovered. The \"Javanese Brahmanda\" was translated by the Dutch Sanskrit scholar Jan Gonda and compared to Sanskrit texts found in India."}

Female adult frogs can be 6.5 to 10.8\u00a0cm long. These frogs are green with bronze spots. They have black stripes from their noses over their ears and down their bodies. Their bellies are white and parts of their legs can be bright blue. These frogs have teeth.\nGreen and golden bell frogs do not climb well. They like to live near permanent bodies of water and temporary bodies of water that have no fish in them. Adult frogs eat anything they can, even other green and golden bell frogs.\nThe frogs lay 3000-10,000 eggs at a time. At first, the eggs float together on top of the water, but then they sink. The tadpoles eat algae, bacteria and dead things.\nThere used to be so many green and golden bell frogs that people would catch them to feed to snakes or to use in school dissection classes. By the 1990s, there were fewer green and golden bell frogs. Scientists say this is because of habitat fragmentation, which means people building things in between places where the frogs live, and because of invasive species such as the mosquito fish that eat green and golden bell frog tadpoles.\nIn 2000, people building tennis courts for the 2000 Summer Olympics saw green and golden bell frogs nearby, so they stopped building.\nThis frog is an invasive specie in New Zealand. In the 1860s, the Auckland Acclimatisation Society released the frog in New Zealand on purpose. The frogs on the South Island all died because the weather was not good for them. Today, it lives on New Zealand's North Island."}

The brand is owned by the Fiskars Group Ltd. The company was started in 1947 in Waterford.\nIn January 2009, the main Waterford Crystal base was closed due to the lack of funds of Waterford Wedgwood PLC. In June 2010, Waterford Crystal relocated to The Mall in Waterford city centre and the business restarted. This new location is now home to a factory that melts over 750 tons of crystal a year, although most Waterford Crystal is now produced outside Ireland. This new facility offers visitors the opportunity to take guided tours of the factory and also offers a retail store, showcasing the world's largest collection of Waterford Crystal.\nHistory.\nEarly crystal production.\nThe first crystal glass production in Waterford dates back to 1783 when George Penrose and his nephew William Penrose started their business. It produced very fine flint glass that became world famous. Their Waterford company closed in 1851, and re-opened 100 years later.\nFoundation of 1947.\nIn 1947, Czech immigrant Charles Bacik, grandfather of Irish senator Ivana Bacik, established a glassworks in the city. Skilled crystal glass workers were not available in Ireland so continental Europeans were used. Assisted by fellow countryman and designer Miroslav Havel, the company started operations in a depressed Ireland. By the early 1950s it had been taken over as a subsidiary of the Irish Glass Bottle company, owned by Joseph McGrath (Irish politician), Richard Duggan and Spencer Freeman of the Irish Hospitals' Sweepstake, who were heavy investors in Irish business at that time.\nIn 1970 John Aynsley and Sons was taken over by Waterford and renamed Aynsley China Ltd.\n1990s onward.\nJasper Conran began designing his signature range of crystal for Waterford in 1999. The endeavour has evolved into four unique lines for Waterford and a complementary tableware collection in fine bone china for Wedgwood in 2001. The Chinese fashion designer John Rocha started designing a range of cut crystal stemware and vases in collaboration with glass designer Marcus Notley in 2001.\nAcquisition by Fiskars.\nOn 11 May 2015 in a deal that happened in July 2015, the Fiskars Corporation, a Finnish maker of products for the home, agreed to buy 100% of the holdings of WWRD. On 2 July 2015 the purchase of WWRD by Fiskars Corporation was completed including brands Waterford, Wedgwood, Royal Doulton, Royal Albert, and Roga\u0161ka. This was approved by the US antitrust authorities.\nProducts.\nMost Waterford crystal glass is now produced outside Ireland in countries such as Slovenia, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Germany. Waterford produces many patterns of lead crystal glass stemware, including lines such as \"Adare, Alana, Colleen, Kincora, Lismore, Maeve, Tramore\", and many others.\nIn 1966 Waterford's chandeliers were installed in Westminster Abbey, London, England for the 900th anniversary of the dedication of the abbey after Christoper Hildyard, a minor canon of the abbey for 45 years, convinced the Guinness family to pay for them. Chandeliers hang in other notable buildings, such as Windsor Castle, and the Kennedy Center, Washington, D.C. Waterford Crystal made the 2,688 crystals for the famous New Year's Eve Ball that is dropped each year in New York City's Times Square. The ball is an geodesic orb, in diameter and is lit by 32,256 Lumileds Luxeon Rebel LEDs.\nOne of the most popular products in their collection is the \"Apprentice Bowl\". It requires 600 precision cuts, all done by hand. Cutters would set out to complete this bowl in their fifth and final year of apprenticeship. They were only permitted three attempts, where the cutter would then be graded and if they passed it would receive the Waterford Crystal watermark.\nTrophies.\nSporting trophies are also crafted by Waterford, such as the Masters Series crystal shield trophies that are awarded to the winner of each of the nine men's professional tennis Masters Series tournaments, the AFCA National Championship Trophy that is awarded to the US college football team which finishes the season at the top of the Coaches Poll, and a representation of the Ashes urn that is presented to the winners of the Test cricket series between England and Australia. The trophy for the Masters snooker championship is also made by Waterford Crystal, as is the Scottish Open snooker championship trophy.\nAlso crafted by Waterford are the winning trophies for the French, Belgian and German Grand Prix in Formula One, a bat and ball trophy presented at the final game at Yankee Stadium to Derek Jeter and a glass tennis racket for Boris Becker. They also design the trophies for the People's Choice Awards."}

Most often, gar\u00faa is used to refer to the moist cold fog that occurs on the coasts of Peru, southern Ecuador, and northern Chile, during the winter months. Gar\u00faa is called Camanchaca in Chile. \nThese coastal regions in Peru, Ecuador and Chile have a desert climate. There's almost no rain during the year. Gar\u00faa brings mild temperatures and high humidity. It also provides moisture from fog and mist to a nearly-rainless region. The places where there's often fog also have more vegetation. They are called fog oases, or lomas. \nFog and drizzle are common on the coast, and near lakes. In the case of gar\u00f9a, its impact on the climate is unique. \nHow it forms.\nThe Humboldt Current runs along the coast. It brings cold waters. It is responsible for both the desert-like climate and the gar\u00f9a. The area covers the coasts of Peru and Chile from latitudes 5\u00b0 to 30\u00b0 South, a north-south distance of roughly . The Humboldt Current brings mild temperatures and high humidity to a very arid region. The cold waters create an inversion: the air near the ocean surface is cooler than the air above, contrary to most climatic situations. The trade winds blow the cool air and fog eastward over coastal areas, where the fog transforms into drizzle and mist, the gar\u00faa.\nGar\u00faa is a dense fog that does not produce rain. The water droplets in the fog measure between 1 and 40 microns across, too fine to form rain.\nImpact on climate.\nThe impact of the Humboldt Current and the gar\u00faa it produces is substantial. Lima, Peru is near sea level. The city is located at 12\u00b0 south latitude. It is in the tropics and would in most climatic situations have average temperatures of or higher in every month of the year. By contrast, Lima has monthly average temperatures that range from (January through March) in the warmest months and in the coolest months of July through September, the months in which the gar\u00faa is most frequent.\nThe impact on sunshine is even more important. Only 34 percent of daylight hours in Lima have sunshine every year. On average, July and August receive less than one hour a day of sunshine. Lima receives only 1,230 hours of sunshine per year. By contrast, London, notoriously cloudy and foggy, gets 1,573 hours of sunshine annually and New York City receives 2,535 hours of sunshine annually. The climate of Lima is typical of the coasts of Peru and northern Chile.\nNineteenth-century American author, Herman Melville called Lima \u201cthe strangest, saddest city thou cans\u2019t see.\", because of the gar\u00f9a clouds and mist in winter. Twenty-first century Lima, on the oher hand, has a flourishing tourist trade and has been described as having a \"hidden loveliness.\"\nThe desert coast on the 1700 mile north south stretch is very dry: On average, it gets less than of precipitation per year. Some areas may go without rain for many years. Only the moisture condensed from the gar\u00f9a clouds -- plus occasional El Ni\u00f1o events -- enables islands of vegetation to be present in the lomas dotted up and down the Peruvian and Chilean coasts. Except for the lomas and river valleys draining the higher and more humid Andes the coastal desert has almost no vegetation.\nThe gar\u00faa extends only a few kilometers inland. It dissipates over land especially where it coalesces against mountain slopes at elevations of to , the altitudes at which the vegetated lomas are found.\nFog collection.\nIn the area, water is scarce, and scientis have found a way to collect water from from the moisture-laden gar\u00faa.\nIn Chile, in 1985, scientists devised a fog collection system: They used nets to capture the water droplets in the fog. These nets are made of a special material, polyolefin. That way, it is possible to produce running water for villages in these otherwise desert areas. The Camanchacas Project installed 50 large fog-collecting nets on a mountain ridge, which captured some 2% of the water in the fog.\nIn 2005, another installation of panels of produced per square meter per day.\nIn Peru there is an effort to preserve the fragile ecosystem of the gar\u00faa-watered lomas. Conservation groups have installed fog-catching nets in the Atiquipa District to capture water and help the 80 families who live within the area to expand agriculture, primarily of olives."}

He wrestled on the ground with two police officers, one of whom tased him. Brooks stole a taser from one of the officers, then fired the taser at one of them as he ran away. The same officer then shot Brooks in the back with his sidearm.\nVideo of the incident went viral. Atlanta chief of police Erika Shields resigned the next day. \nProtesters later burned down the Wendy's where the shooting had taken place.\nOne of the officers, Garrett Rolfe, was placed on administrative duty, meaning office work instead of going out into public spaces, and later fired. In mid-June, Rolfe was charged with eleven crimes, including felony murder and aggravated assault. If a jury convicts him, Rolfe could spend life in prison or even be executed. The other officer, Devin Brosnan, was charged with aggravated assault. The court issued arrest warrants for both men. They were told to turn themselves in by Thursday night, June 18. Brosnan and Rolfe both came to court. Brosnan was charged and then released on bail. The judge said Rolfe's crime was too serious for him to grant bail right away, so Rolfe was put in Gwinnett County Jail, and his bail hearing was scheduled for Tuesday, June 23.\nEvent.\nAccording to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, around 10:35 p.m., officers were called to the Wendy's because Brooks had fallen asleep in his car in the drive-though lane so that people had to drive around him. The officers gave Brooks a test to see if he was drunk. He failed the test, and the officers tried to arrest him. Brooks stole a taser from one officer and ran off. The GBI said Brooks fired the taser at the officer, narrowly missing him. The officer then shot Brooks. The GBI promised to release video footage of the shooting to the public. These details are confirmed from the footage of the incident recorded by the camera on Wendy's.\nThe lawyers for Garrett Rolfe and for the prosecution said different things. Rolfe's lawyers, the LoRusso Law Firm, said that Rolfe heard a gunshot noise and saw a flash of light and thought Brooks had a real weapon. They said he fired his gun thinking he was protecting himself and the people at the Wendy's. Rolfe's lawyers said Rolfe immediately called for an ambulance and immediately tried to help Brooks. According to the county district attorney, Rolfe kicked Brooks after shooting him, and neither of the two police officers tried to help Brooks for two minutes.\nAccording to the GBI and district attorneys, Brooks and the police talked peacefully for a over forty minutes before they tried to arrest him. They said he claimed he was not too drunk to drive and then offered to walk to his sister's house nearby instead of driving.\nBrooks was taken to a hospital where doctors performed surgery, but he died.\nLaw.\nIn Georgia, police are allowed to shoot someone if that person poses an immediate threat to any other person.\nBackground.\nThe shooting occurred two weeks into the George Floyd protests and several months into the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.\nAftermath.\nThere were protests outside the Wendy's where Brooks was killed. \nOn June 13, someone set the Wendy's on fire and it burned almost completely. On June 24, Rayshard Brooks' girlfriend, Natalie White, was charged with arson for this crime. Her lawyer said she did not do it."}

She then married the author called Francis Blake Atkinson. The couple had children called Dorothy Blake (b. 1892) and Frances Eleanor (b. 1899).\nCareer.\nShe taught in schools in both Indianapolis and Chicago. She wrote for the \"Chicago Tribune\" under the name Nora Marks from 1888 to 1890. She then became publisher of the Little Chronicle Publishing Company. The Little Chronicle Publishing Company published some of her own work, other educational books and the \"Little Chronicle. The Little Chronicle\" was an newspaper for young children with pictures. She wrote both story books and fact books. The story books were mostly love stories and the fact books were mostly educational books.\nEleanor Atkinson is best known for her 1912 story book called \"Greyfriars Bobby\". This popular book told the well known story of the dog called \"Greyfriars Bobby.\" It is set in Edinburgh, in Scotland\".\" New versions of the story copy some the story that Eleanor Atkinson wrote. Many details of the book, such as the details of the dog's master are wrong. It was thought that Eleanor Atkinson didn't visit Edinburgh. It seems like she used the basic story and added parts from her own imagination. The story is very detailed, but the descriptions of the geography are sometimes wrong. Eleanor Atkinson tried to get names correct, and to get across the atmosphere of the city.\nUnusually for someone with who had not been to the country or had no family from Scotland, her knowledge of the local accent was good. So Eleanor Stackhouse may have been told the story by Scottish immigrants to the Midwest, USA.\nThe book is often considered a classic, especially for children. It has been reprinted several times. The book was the basis for the films called \"Challenge to Lassie\" (MGM, 1949) and \"Greyfriars Bobby\" (Disney, 1961). These films were made after her death. Both films starred Donald Crisp.\nPersonal life.\nBlake's daughter, Eleanor Blake, wrote a detective story called \"Death Down East\" (1942). Eleanor Blake's son, who is Eleanor Atkinson's grandson, was the movie and television actor Wally Cox."}

Locksley and Marian declare their affection before departing.\nAct II.\nScene 1: The Trysting tree in the Greenwood.\nDeep in Sherwood forest, by the trysting tree in moonlight, the Merrie Men relax after their toils, with a fat deer roasting. Robin appears to tell Little John of the Sompnour\u2019s expected journey through the forest. They prepare to entrap him: the outlaws conceal themselves while Robin, John and Much, the miller\u2019s son, disguise themselves as shepherds and tend to the fire. The Sompnour appears and tells his guards to arrest the shepherds for stealing the King\u2019s venison. With affected humility they plead for mercy. When this is sternly refused Robin throws off his disguise and sounds his horn. The Sheriff\u2019s men flee, leaving the Sompnour to be captured. Much proposes that he be hanged, but merciful Robin invites the Sompnour to supper. Yet he must pay generously for it. To escape the hanging he must dance for the outlaws\u2019 amusement.\nScene 2: Marian\u2019s bower.\nMarian watches the dawn break, imploring Heaven to assist her lover\u2019s marksmanship and gain her father\u2019s approval. The Sheriff appears and gives encouragement. Much reveals to the Sheriff that Robin Hood will be at the fair and asks for the reward, but the Sompnour recognises him from the forest and he is taken away. In the guise of a friar the Sompnour promises to find Robin and claim the reward himself. To this the Sheriff agrees.\nScene 3: The Fair outside Nottingham.\nWe discover a scene of sport, dancing and games. Robin, as Locksley, recognises the Sompnour and tells Allan to get rid of him. After a dance Allan has the Sompnour blindfolded to play a game of \u2018Hoodman Blind\u2019. The archery match commences and Locksley proves his skill, enabling him to claim Marian\u2019s hand. The Sompnour returns, recognises Locksley, and denounces him as the infamous Robin Hood. Amidst turmoil Robin is seized by the Sheriff\u2019s men and led away.\nAct III.\nScene 1: The Castle garden.\nAllan and Alice lament the execution of Robin, to take place on the following day. Alice informs the Sheriff that Marian has escaped from her apartment. The Sompnour arrives to claim his reward, but is first told to go to the King for a warrant for Robin Hood\u2019s execution.\nScene 2: The Greenwood at noon.\nMarian appears, dressed as a boy, to tell the outlaws that Robin is to be executed. She leads them to the castle.\nScene 3: Prison cell.\nIn isolation, a distraught Robin awaits his fate. He then hears Marian with his Merrie Men singing outside. This renews his hopes.\nScene 4: The Courtyard of the Castle.\nRobin is brought from the castle and given time to confess his sins. With his arm freed, he then blows his horn to signal his faithful followers. They appear, led by Marian, to release him but are overpowered. However, the document assumed to be the death warrant is in fact a pardon, given on the understanding that they enter the service of the King. The Sheriff once again consents to the union of Robin and Marian, for which there is general rejoicing."}

She was born as a slave in North Carolina, but learned to read and escaped to the North in the 1842.\nWhen she was still a girl, her master wanted to start a sexual relationship with her. She refused and entered into a relationship with Samuel Tredwell Sawyer. Sawyer was a lawyer and had some power to protect her. He became the father of her two children, Joseph and Louisa Matilda. Still, the law gave a master absolute power over a slave. Jacobs's master wanted to sell her children away from her. In 1835, she decided to hide in a small room in her grandmother's house. That room was so small that she could not stand up. She had to stay there for seven years. Because she could neither stand nor walk, she was suffering from leg problems for many years afterwards. In 1842, she was finally able to escape to Philadelphia by boat. From Philadelphia, she went to New York where she found work as a nanny for the children of Nathaniel Parker Willis. Also her brother John S. Jacobs and her children were able to escape from slavery.\nWhile she was still working as nanny for the Willis children during the day, at night she wrote down her experiences. In January 1861, her experiences were finally published as a book called \"Incidents in the Life of Slave Girl, written by herself.\" After the American Civil War had started in April 1861, she went to Alexandria, Virginia. There she helped black people who had just escaped from slavery. She spent her last years in Washington, D.C. where she lived together with her daughter.\nAfter the Civil War, the slaves were set free. The people of the United States lost interest in slavery and forgot Jacobs and her book. But in the second half of the 20th century, people began to show new interest in the history of slavery. Professor Jean Fagan Yellin did a lot of research work and wrote the book \"Harriet Jacobs. A Life. The Remarkable Adventures of the Woman who Wrote Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl\". Today, people call Jacobs's book an \"American classic\", meaning that it is one of the most important books written in the United States of America. "}

{"id": "767656", "revid": "495413", "url": "https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=767656", "title": "Andrew Ryan (BioShock)", "text": "Andrew Ryan is a fictional character and an important villain from the video game \"BioShock.\" He is the creator of Rapture, the city where \"BioShock\" takes place. He is based on the real-life author Ayn Rand. Like Ayn Rand, Andrew Ryan is an atheist and an objectivist. Objectivism is the belief that everything people do should only be done if it helps their own self-interest. Andrew Ryan hates people whom he calls \"parasites\", or people who take away the money or the goods that other people worked hard to make.\nBiography.\nAndrew Ryan was born as Andrei Rayanovskiy in the Russian Empire. He was a boy when the Russian Revolution happened. After the revolution, the Bolsheviks took away his family business and killed his family. This made him hate communism because he believed that it was a government and economic system made by \"parasites\". \nA few years after the revolution, he fled to America. He really liked capitalism because it was an economic system where people could keep the money and goods they worked for. However, during the Great Depression, President Franklin D. Roosevelt made a lot of government programs to help poor people. Andrew Ryan hated this because he did not like that people would be forced to give away money and goods to poor people who did not work for it.\nDuring the New Deal, Andrew Ryan felt that there was no good place on Earth where people could keep all the money and goods they worked hard for. Since he could not find such a place, he decided to make such a place himself. In 1946, he began building the underwater city of Rapture. In 1951, the city was completed. Andrew Ryan looked for smart and talented people who did not like the governments or religions on the surface and allowed them to live in Rapture. People came to Rapture because Andrew Ryan made it to be a place where people could do or become anything they wanted if they worked hard for it. \nAt first, Rapture developed very quickly because there were many smart scientists who could do any research they wanted. However, after a few years the wealth gap between rich and poor became very wide. This allowed Frank Fontaine to help the poor so that he could begin to control Rapture. Afraid that Fontaine was become too powerful, Ryan took away many rights the people of Rapture had before and became a dictator. By doing this, Andrew Ryan betrayed the same values he built Rapture on. Later, there was a civil war between the rich people (who supported Ryan) and the poor (who supported Fontaine). After the war, Rapture became too dangerous to live in. As a result, most people who could do so left Rapture and returned to the surface world.\nBefore the civil war, Andrew Ryan had sex with a prostitute named Jasmine Jolene and she became pregnant with a son. Since she needed money, she sold the embryo of her son to Fontaine. Fontaine hired scientists Yi Suchong and Brigid Tenenbaum to experiment on the child, Jack, so that he could learn and grow into a fully-capable adult in less than four years. They also programmed him to obey certain commands without him knowing it. Specifically, he would obey any command he hears if he also hears the phrase \"would you kindly\". Suchong and Tenenbaum also gave him false memories so that he would never learn of his true purpose, to kill Andrew Ryan.\nIn 1960, while Jack was sitting on a plane flying over the Atlantic Ocean, he reads a letter that he thought was written by his parents. Actually, they were instructions for him to steal the plane and crash it just outside Rapture. He obeyed the instructions because the phrase \"would you kindly\" was written on it. Not knowing what happened, Jack though the plane crashed. After the plane crashed, Jack would swim to a nearby lighthouse. This lighthouse happened to be the entrance for Rapture.\nAfter Jack arrives in Rapture, Fontaine, pretending to be an Irishman named Atlas, tells Jack he can help him if Jack helps Atlas rescue his wife and son (which he does not really have). After Ryan blows up the submarine that Atlas said his wife and son were on, he tells Jack to get revenge on Ryan by killing him.\nAt first Ryan thought that Jack was a CIA or KGB agent sent to destroy Rapture. However, right when Jack was outside Ryan's office, Ryan realizes that Jack is his son and he chooses not to hurt or attack Jack. When Jack waits outside Ryan's office, Ryan tells Jack that he was being controlled by Atlas his whole life so Jack could kill Ryan. Ryan gives Jack his golf club and commands Jack to kill him. Jack could not refuse to kill Ryan because Ryan said the phrase, \"would you kindly.\" Ryan did this to show that he was a man and Jack was a slave, because \"a man chooses, a slave obeys\"."}

Since 5 May 2020, Chinese and Indian troops have reportedly engaged in aggressive actions, face-offs, and other kinds of intense military action at locations along the Sino-Indian border.\nHand-to-hand combat on 16 June 2020 resulted in the death of 20 Indian soldiers (including an officer), Indian media sources have so far claimed that at least 43 Chinese soldiers were either dead or injured (including the death of an officer) while US intelligence sources reportedly believe that 35 Chinese soldiers are dead, including a senior officer.\nIncidents have taken place near the Pangong Lake in Ladakh and the Nathu La pass in Sikkim. In addition, face-offs are ongoing at locations in eastern Ladakh, along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) which was the result of the 1962 Sino-Indian War.\nAccording to some reports, China captured 60\u00a0km2. of Indian-patrolled territory between May and June 2020. However, China has denied capturing any territory and both countries agreed to disengage by June 2020.\nBetween this clash, the Indian government hasn't admitted publicly to Indian citizens that Chinese PLA troops have trangressed their territory. On 6 August 2020 one such document was published in Ministry of Defense website of India claiming that the current clash is expected to be prolonged. This document was taken down by the official website.\nAccording to S Jaishankar, the External Affairs Minister of India, the ongoing military standoff is a result of Beijing not following the existing agreements."}

People thought these frogs were extinct, but then scientists found some in 2009.\nThere used to be two groups of yellow-spotted bell frogs, one in the north on the New England Tableland and one in the south near Canberra. Some scientists said these should count as two different species of frogs. The northern frogs lived between 1000 and 1500 meters above sea level and the southern frogs lived between 700 and 800 meters above sea level. Both groups of frogs lived in permanent bodies of water, like swamps, lagoons, and the parts of rivers where the water flows slowly.\nPeople thought these frogs all died from a fungus disease in the 1970s, but in 2009 some were found alive in the Southern Tablelands. At first, the scientists did not tell anyone where they found the frog. They were worried that frog fans would come to take photographs of them, try to catch them, or scare them away. The scientists took some of the frogs and tadpoles to the Taronga Zoo. The scientists left the other yellow-spotted tree frogs where they were. The person who owned the land where the frogs were living agreed to help protect them.\nSometime after that, the wild frogs all died. In 2018, scientists took some of the frogs they had raised at the Taronga Zoo and set them free in another part of the Southern Tablelands. The scientists asked any person who thought they'd heard the frogs to make a recording of their calls with their phones.\nThe largest yellow-spotted tree frogs are 8 cm long. They have yellow or white spots on their legs and bellies. Their feet are completely webbed. Their backs are green with bronze and black spots. Their voices sound like a car engine failing to start.\nThese frogs look for food at night and like to sit in the sun during the day. They lay their eggs on underwater plants. During the winter, these frogs hide under stones, logs, or plants.\nThe government of Australia has made programs to protect these frogs. They are in danger from feral cats that like to eat them and from a fungus that causes a disease called chytridiomycosis. Scientists think that invasive species of fish and more ultraviolet radiation may also be killing these frogs. Too much ultraviolet light can stop their eggs from hatching."}

When he wakes up, even though he knows Hell is a dangerous place, he decides to go to Hell, wanting to make a harem of demon girls in the real world.\nGameplay.\nThe player plays a series of puzzle stages, in which the player pushes stones and skeleton soldiers around a two-dimensional top-down grid, like in \"Sokoban\", while having a limited amount of turns, avoiding spike traps and collecting key items. After reaching the goal, the player reaches the demon girl of that stage, who will ask the player a question, of which the correct answer is based on her personality. If the player guesses the answer correctly, the demon girl becomes part of the player's demon harem. If the player guesses the answer incorrectly, a bad ending, such as death, will happen, taking the player back to the start of the stage.\nThe final boss level, which features the demon \"Judgement, the High Prosecutor\", includes phased bullet hell-like mechanics with chains across the screen.\nDevelopment.\n\u0141ukasz Piskorz, who is known on Twitter as \"vanripper\", developed the whole game by himself over an estimated time of one year, and was the game's artistic director.

The hypothetical chain of events leads to a significant (usually negative) result. So unintended consequences follow the first step in the chain of events. \nAn example of this is the domino effect theory. During the Vietnam War, many people in the United States believed that if Vietnam were to unite and become communist, then the rest of Southeast Asia would eventually become communist too, unless the United States got involved in actively stopping communism.\nA slippery slope argument can also be a slippery slope fallacy. Fallacies are statements that sound reasonable but are actually logically flawed or sometimes even dishonest. Whether or not a slippery slope argument is a fallacy depends on whether it becomes true \"necessarily\" or just in practice. In many cases it just acts as a warning, and readers have to use common sense as to its truth value. So, strictly speaking, these are fallacies only in the sense that they pretend certain consequences will follow, when in reality the consequences merely may follow.\nA more specific example is the argument that:\nIf any of the steps is unsound, then the whole argument is unsound.

The name comes from an example made up by Anthony Flew.\n\"No true Scotsman puts brown sugar on his porridge. The fact that Angus MacGregor puts brown sugar on his porridge just proves that he's no \"true\" Scotsman!\"\nThe word \"Scotsman\" can really be replaced with any group a person is talking about.\nAnother example is, \"Any Chinese who cannot make dumplings is not \"really\" Chinese,\" or \"You could not be from the South. No Southernern I know would \"ever\" turn down a glass of sweet tea.\"\nFor the argument to not be a fallacy, the thing being talked about must have a trait that excludes themselves from the category.\nOne argument that is not a no true Scotsman fallacy is \"Janice is not really a vegetarian because I saw her eat a chicken sandwich yesterday.\" Vegetarians, by definition, are people who do not eat meat. Since Janice ate a chicken sandwich, a meal that has meat in it, Janice is therefore not a vegetarian.\nAnother argument that is not a fallacy is \"Jim is not an atheist because he believes that there could be a god or gods\". Since the definition of an atheist is someone who full believes that there is no god or gods, Jim therefore cannot be an atheist because he does not fully believe that god or gods do not exist. However, Jim could be an agnostic, someone who is does not know for sure whether or not god or gods exist.\nAnother argument that is a fallacy is \"Darcy is not really a Democrat because she is against abortion.\" Even though most Democrats are for some levels of abortion, not all people who vote for Democrats are for abortion. Darcy might agree with the Democratic Party on other issues, like having a higher minimum wage or spending less money on the military, but disagreeing on one issue does not automatically make her not a Democrat. In fact, most people who vote for certain political parties will not agree with their party on every issue, but they will agree on the issues that are most important to themselves. \nOn the other side, saying \"to be Christian is to be Republican\" is also a fallacy. Although in America, a higher number of Christians vote for Republicans, there are also many Christians who vote for Democrats. There are also many non-Christians such as atheists, Muslims, Hindus, Jews, etc., who vote for Republicans."}

He became rich, was highly extravagant, and lost and gained fortunes several times over.\nCulbertson was a brilliant publicist; he played several famous challenge matches and won them all. Two were played in the U.S., against teams led by Sidney Lenz in 1931\u201332 (the so-called \"Bridge Battle of the Century\") and by P. Hal Sims in 1935, the latter between the married couples Culbertson and Sims. \nFour team matches were played in London. These matches had big publicity in newspapers, on radio and on cinema newsreels. The hands became the subject of intense discussion on bidding methods.\nCulbertson was finally beaten in Budapest, June 1937, in the final match of the first world championship teams tournament, by the 6-man Austria team led by Dr. Paul Stern. It was his last appearance in a tournament or match.\nCulbertson founded and edited \"The Bridge World\" magazine, which is still published today, and wrote many newspaper articles and books on bridge. He owned the first firm of playing card manufacturers to develop plastic cards, Kem Cards, and developed and owned a chain of bridge schools with teachers qualified in the Culbertson bidding system. He continued to play high-stakes rubber bridge for many years, but gave up tournament and match competition in 1938 to write and work for world peace.\nAnglo-American matches after World War II, of which there were a number, did not involve Culbertson."}

These parties can be affected by the decision positively or negatively, but this influence is involuntary. This is known as an externality, or an external effect. The problem with externalities is that no one pays for the cost of these effects. Usually, they are not part of the decision process. Externalities are often a form of market failure. In many cases, actors like states need to become active. \nAn example of an externality is pollution. One way to solve this is to introduce taxes on the goods that cause the pollution, for example carbon dioxide, which is the one of the causes of global warming. With concepts such as emissions trading, these externalities can again become part of the market system (and are no longer external)."}

For this reason, it is often called principle of least action. Maupertuis gives a way to determine equations of motion when looking at the action of a mechanical system.\nHistory.\nOne of the first to formulate this was Pierre de Fermat. In the 1600s, he wrote: \"light travels between two given points along the path of shortest time\".\nMaupertuis wrote: \"The laws of movement and of rest deduced from this principle being precisely the same as those observed in nature, we can admire the application of it to all phenomena.
